    "summary": "<p>On April 20, 2020, ten individuals held at the Philadelphia Department of Prisons brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Represented by the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, the ACLU of Pennsylvania, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (\"PDP\") under 22 U.S.C. &sect; 2241, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, and 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2201-2202, seeking relief based on deprivations of their Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights. Specifically, they alleged that because the plaintiffs were at higher risk for serious illness or death from COVID-19 due to their medical conditions or ages, the conditions of the facilities and their continued detention was unconstitutional. The case was assigned to Judge Berle M. Schiller.</p>\r\n<p>Simultaneous with their complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, seeking to certify a class of \"all people held in custody within PDP,\" which included 2 subclasses: (1) Medically Vulnerable Subclass, and (2) Disability Subclass.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order, seeking to obtain conditions that complied with the health and safety standards necessary to protect them. In the alternative, if such conditions were not possible, they requested the court issue writs of habeas corpus to release a sufficient number of inmates so that the facilities could adhere appropriately to the health and safety standards suggested. The defendants opposed both the motion and class certification.</p>\r\n<p>After various telephone conferences held throughout the month of May, Judge Schiller entered a consent order of partial settlement on June 3, 2020. The settlement agreement included terms regarding protective equipment, disinfectant, monitoring, and reporting. The agreement also stated that the parties would continue to discuss and work toward a separate settlement agreement regarding issues of social distancing and cohorting upon the completion of COVID-19 testing. 2020 WL 7549880.</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued to have telephone conferences with the court and submit joint status reports. On December 18, 2020, the court ordered that the June 3 partial settlement remain in full effect, adding requirements for one-time testing of all staff by January 15, 2021 and testing of all detained individuals with a goal of finishing testing by the same date. 2020 WL 7549941. Judge Schiller also ordered the defendants to provide weekly certifications regarding compliance with the June 3 order. On December 28, 2020, the defendants moved for reconsideration of the December 18 order.</p>\r\n<p>On December 30, 2020, the court ordered that the defendants prepare and submit to the court and plaintiffs an operations and management plan to improve out-of-cell time and also ordered testing of incarcerated people to be completed by January 13, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On January 12, 2021, the parties attended a hearing before Judge Schiller, and the following day, the court ordered that the cohort size for out-of-cell time could be increased to allow for more out-of-cell time for incarcerated individuals. On January 28, the court issued another order, stating that the prison must steadily increase its cohort sizes to provide additional out-of-cell time, increasing to 3 hours per day by February 24. The court also dismissed the defendants' motion for reconsideration as moot.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt and sanctions against the defendants in May 2021, reporting that the defendants had repeatedly refused to comply with terms of the consent order by failing to give incarcerated people in defendants&rsquo; facilities their court-mandated daily out-of-cell time. After the court found grounds to hold the City in contempt, Judge Schiller ordered that the defendants provide the plaintiffs with regular formal reports of compliance with the court order, and postponed deciding on whether to hold the defendants in contempt or to order sanctions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties reached a settlement agreement to resolve these contempt issues in late June 2021. This settlement agreement required the City to make a one-time payment of $125,000 to split between two local bail funds: the Philadelphia Bail Fund and the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund. Judge Schiller approved the settlement on June 23, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2021, Judge Schiller issued an order declaring what ongoing prison conditions should look like, and that facilities should return to their pre-COVID operations by early 2022, including eight hours of out-of-cell time, absent extenuating circumstances. 2021 WL 4269171.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in mid-October 2021. This new complaint included requests for injunctive relief in light of the plaintiffs&rsquo; concerns about out-of-cell time. On December 9, 2021, Judge Schiller denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; initial request for class certification as moot in light of the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint, and they filed a new request for class certification on December 21, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed another motion for contempt and sanctions in December 2021. Judge Schiller approved another settlement agreement between the parties on January 31, 2022, and the plaintiffs withdrew their motion for contempt. Under the settlement agreement, the City agreed to make an additional $125,000 payment to the Philadelphia Bail Fund.</p>\r\n<p>On January 28, 2022, the plaintiffs asked the court for leave to file a third amended complaint and filed an amended motion to certify the class. The court granted the motion for leave and the plaintiffs filed a third amended class action complaint on February 22, 2022. The amended complaint added six additional plaintiffs incarcerated in PDP and asserted four claims for relief, three pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and one pursuant to the ADA. Count I alleged that the defendants violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by failing to provide &ldquo;for the[ir] reasonable health and safety&rdquo; and &ldquo;humane conditions of confinement.&rdquo; Count II alleged unconstitutional lack of access to courts and counsel arising under the First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Count III asserted that the defendants' use of punitive or administrative segregation and imposition of financial assessments violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Count IV alleged that the \"Disability Subclass\" was denied reasonable accommodations, adequate out-of-cell time, and adequate medical and mental health treatment in violation of the ADA.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on March 11, the court certified a class of \"All persons who are currently or will be in the future confined in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons, and are or will be subjected to illegal or unconstitutional conditions of confinement as a result of policies and restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PDP&rsquo;s staffing shortage.\" The court further defined a subclass of those with \"physical and/or psychiatric impairments that substantially limit one or more of their major life activities.\" 2022 WL 742707.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2022, the parties filed, and the court approved, a preliminary class action settlement.&nbsp;Under the terms of the preliminary agreement, the City of Philadelphia would: address hiring and retention practices; provide minimum out-of-cell time; increase capacity for in-person visits; ensure adequate medical and mental health treatment; ensure compliance with due process rights during disciplinary hearings; expand access to phones and tablets; continue implementation of a lock replacement program; continue to follow COVID-19 protocols; and continue use-of-force refresher training. The preliminary agreement left open the discussion on payments for plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys&rsquo; fees, and proposed that the court retain jurisdiction over the agreement for two years. The parties also stipulated that the settlement was not an admission of defendants&rsquo; wrongdoing.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the motion on May 25, 2022, and, at the parties&rsquo; recommendation, appointed a monitor to oversee implementation of the terms of the agreement.&nbsp;Fifty-six class members filed objections to the preliminary settlement agreement, which were reviewed by the parties but ultimately did not warrant disruption of the final settlement terms. Objections primarily referenced dissatisfaction with prison conditions that the settlement was designed to address and disappointment with the lack of monetary damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties filed a joint motion for approval of the class action settlement on June 22, 2022. The court approved the agreement the following month, on July 12. The agreement did not significantly deviate from the terms of the preliminary agreement, and the parties settled the claim for attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs for $340,000. As part of the agreement, the monitor would continue to observe PDP facilities for two years unless the oversight period was shortened or extended. The court also dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction as moot following approval of the settlement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The monitor submitted the first report on November 4, 2022 and the second report on March 3, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>The third report was submitted seven months later, on October 12. It noted that the defendants had not yet resumed normal operations regarding programming, visits, and other services, as required by the terms of the settlement agreement. The monitor found that defendants had only achieved partial compliance with conditions of the agreement requiring sufficient staffing of correctional officers, out-of-cell time for incarcerated individuals, adequate healthcare, and a method of addressing the backlog of individuals seeking healthcare. The monitor observed improvements in the prisons&rsquo; visiting and discipline procedures, and found substantial compliance with COVID-testing and quarantine requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned from Judge Schiller to Judge Gerald A. McHugh on December 20, 2023. On December 22, after reviewing the settlement agreement and the monitor&rsquo;s reports, Judge McHugh ordered that the conditions of the agreement be extended to April 30, 2025. The court highlighted the monitor&rsquo;s findings that defendants were not yet in substantial compliance with the settlement terms, except with regard to provisions governing COVID-19 testing and quarantine protocols.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 4, 2024, the parties stipulated to extending the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement another year, until April 30, 2026.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The fourth monitor's report was filed on March 29, 2024. In it, the monitor indicated that the defendants were not compliant with many of the consent decree's provisions, in part due to staffing shortages. The monitor determined that the defendants \"ha[d] pursued a course of half measures steeped in bureaucratic and political rigidity with devastating consequences for Class Members and [prison] staff.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The following month, on April 8, the plaintiffs moved to hold the defendants in contempt based on alleged noncompliance with the consent decree. The plaintiffs pointed to various issues that had occurred throughout the years as well as several findings from the most recent monitor's report, including an increase in deaths of class members, staffing shortages, a lack of out-of-cell time, a medical appointment backlog, a lack of law library access, and sanitation problems.</p>\r\n<p>The court granted the motion for contempt later that year, on July 12, after several hearings. The court held that the defendants were noncompliant at least as to staffing levels and out-of-cell time. A month later, on August 16, the court entered an injunction based on the contempt finding. The injunction required the defendants to take various measures related to 1) hiring new staff, 2) medical care funding and access, 3) law library access and programming opportunities, 4) facility maintenance and security, 5) relocating incarcerated people to address population issues, and 6) hiring an internal compliance monitor. The court also ordered Philadelphia to pay $25 million, which would be used for the city to meet the order's requirements.</p>\r\n<p>As of September 9, 2024, the case is ongoing.</p>",

The plaintiffs sought relief on behalf of all those within PDP through a TRO and preliminary injunction, but before the court ruled on these motions, the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement. After the plaintiffs filed multiple motions for contempt alleging that the defendants had failed to comply with court orders, the parties entered into two additional settlement agreements—one requiring the defendants to pay $125,000 to two local bail funds. In early March 2022, the court certified the class and a disability subclass. Before the court heard the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which was finalized on July 12, 2022. Following the court-appointed monitor’s third report in October 2023 showing partial compliance in a number of areas, the court ordered the extension of the agreement until April 2025. On January 4, 2024, the parties stipulated to extending the conditions of the settlement until April 30, 2026. The court found the defendants in contempt based on noncompliance on July 12, 2024, and ordered various policy changes to be made. The case is ongoing as of September 2024.",

The Monitor prepared this report as the fourth of \nregular reports to be filed of record through the second settlement term ending April 30, \n2026.  Subsequent reports will be filed according to the following schedule:  \n \nMonitor’s Fifth Report    September 30, 2024   \nMonitor’s Sixth Report    March 31, 2025  \nMonitor’s Seventh Report    September 30, 2025 \nMonitor’s Final Report    March 30, 2026  \n   \nI am available to answer any questions the Court may have regarding this report and \nDefendants’ compliance with the Agreement at such times as are convenient for the Court.   \n \nDATED:  March 29, 2024               Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \nBy: /s/ Cathleen Beltz   \nMonitor\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 2 of 69\n \nThe Agreement between Plaintiffs Thomas Remick, et al., on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated (Plaintiffs), and the City of Philadelphia (City) and Blanche Carney, in her \nofficial capacity as Commissioner of Prisons (Commissioner), in Thomas Remick et al., v. City of \nPhiladelphia, Case No. CV 01959-BMS (Action), requires system-wide reform of the \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons (PDP) as prescribed in 18 substantive provisions.  The two-\nyear Agreement was scheduled to terminate on April 12, 2024.  In the initial settlement term, \nDefendants met the requirements for substantial compliance with Substantive Provision 15—\nCOVID-19 Testing and Substantive Provision 16—Quarantine.  Defendants also substantially \ncomplied with sub-provisions 12.3 and 12.5 (Substantive Provision 12—Locks) and 13.1 and \n13.3 (Substantive Provision 13—Visiting).  On January 4, 2024, the parties stipulated to a two-\nyear extension with a new Agreement termination date of April 30, 2026.1 \n \nThe Agreement provides that the Monitor issue “regular reports to counsel and the Court” that \nassess Defendants’ compliance with each substantive provision of the Agreement.  The Monitor \nwill address Defendants’ implementation progress and issue “Substantial Compliance,” “Partial \nCompliance,” or “Non-compliance” findings for each substantive provision.  Where necessary, \nthe Monitor will make specific recommendations to improve Defendants’ compliance with the \nAgreement.  A “Substantial Compliance” finding means Defendants “have and are reasonably \nexpected to continue to substantially satisfy” the requirements of an Agreement provision.  A \n“Partial Compliance” finding means that PDP has successfully completed some of the discrete \ntasks outlined in a substantive provision and continues to demonstrate progress toward \nsubstantial compliance.  A “Non-compliance” finding means that Defendants have “not \nsubstantially satisfied” Agreement requirements by failing to complete the discrete tasks outlined \nin a substantive provision.  Defendants will not be found in non-compliance based on “isolated \nor minor instances of failure [to substantially comply]” or “omissions of a technical or trivial \nnature.”   \n \nWhere substantial compliance requires the revision of existing policies or promulgation of new \nones, Defendants’ compliance will be assessed based on policy language and substance, \nnotification and training of personnel, and policy implementation and adherence.  Finally, the \nMonitor and Parties agree that successful reform is ultimately measured by sustained \nimprovements to living conditions for Class Members.  In issuing compliance findings, the \nMonitor will consider whether reforms implemented pursuant to the Agreement are durable and \ntheir benefits are expected to outlive the Agreement’s April 30, 2026, termination date. In this \nreporting period, the Monitoring Team utilized data tracked through December 31, 2023, and \nadditional information received through February 28, 2024. \n \nThe Agreement requires the Monitor to conduct site inspections “at least once every three \nmonths.” In addition to at least one quarterly site visit, the Monitoring Team conducts periodic \nsite visits with little advance notice to PDP.  During site visits, the Monitor has access to conduct \nconfidential interviews with personnel and Class Members.  The Monitor also has access to all \nrecords, files, electronic files, videos, and other materials, including personnel records and \n \n1 On January 4, 2024, upon the agreement of the Parties, the Remick Court issued an order extending the Agreement \nthrough April 30, 2026.  Stipulated Order, Remick v. City of Philadelphia, No. 2:20-cv-01959-GAM, Dkt. 197 (E.D. \nPa.

PDP remained collaborative in identifying solutions to \ndeficiencies that impede compliance with the Agreement.  On March 25, 2024, the \nCommissioner announced her retirement effective April 5, 2024.  The Monitoring Team thanks \nthe Commissioner for her service and for her commitment to systemic reform despite persistent \nbarriers.   \n \nThe Remick Monitoring Agreement and Protocol requires the Monitor to “establish means of \ncommunication to enable Class Members, their families, and advocates to provide information \nrelated to implementation of and compliance with the Agreement.”2  In this reporting period, \nDeputy Monitor Grosso (Deputy Monitor) has continued to conduct site visits at least once per \nmonth to speak with Class Members on PDP housing units.  Following site visits, the Deputy \nMonitor schedules weekly confidential virtual meetings with Class Members if more privacy is \nrequired.  Since weekly two-hour tablet meetings commenced December 6, 2022, the Deputy \nMonitor has interviewed 247 Class Members across PDP facilities.  The Monitoring Team also \nutilizes information provided during tablet meetings to connect with Class Members’ family \nmembers who are willing to communicate with the Monitoring Team.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team periodically receives complaints from Plaintiffs’ co-counsel detailing \nspecific allegations and systemic issues communicated by Plaintiffs to co-counsel.  With prior \nauthorization from Class Members, co-counsel provides the Monitoring Team with Class \nMembers’ identifying information, and the Monitoring Team follows up with individual Class \nMembers as necessary.  With prior authorization from Class Members, select complaints and \nsystemic issues are forwarded to PDP for response or investigation, which the Monitoring Team \ntracks and reviews.  Conditions observed and information received via these interviews and \nprotocols are consistent with Remick filings and reports by PDP staff and others who work in or \ninspect PDP facilities.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team also receives information via published reports and communications with \noversight agencies, reform advocates, Plaintiffs’ co-counsel, criminal defense attorneys, and \nothers independent of PDP.  This information augments the Monitoring Team’s direct \nobservations and helps shape recommendations that the Monitoring Team hopes will produce the \nmost durable reforms.  The Monitoring Team thanks these oversight partners for their continued \ncontributions and commitment. \n       \nIn this reporting period, members of the Monitoring Team completed six site visits to all PDP \nfacilities, including Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF), The Detention Center (DC) \nand the Prison Health Services Wing (PHSW), Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center \n(PICC), the Alternative and Special Detention Central Unit (ASD-CU and MOD 3), and \n \n2 Monitoring Agreement and Protocol, Remick v. City of Philadelphia, No. 2:20-cv-01959-BMS, Dkt. 169 at 4 (E.D. \nPa. May 25, 2022). \n  2 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 4 of 69\nRiverside (RCF).3  During each site visit, the Monitoring Team spoke with Class Members and \npersonnel in every area visited regarding Agreement requirements and conditions inside PDP \nfacilities.   \n \nThe Agreement requires the Monitor to “provide to the parties those documents and reports that \nare secured by her office which, in her judgment, should be shared to effectuate the terms and \nconditions of the Agreement.”  The Monitor has determined that documentation provided by \nDefendants and utilized by the Monitoring Team in making compliance determinations will \ngenerally be shared with Plaintiffs’ co-counsel.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team has consistently reported that PDP will be unable to achieve compliance \nwith the Agreement while its staffing deficit persists.4  Personnel vacancies remain the largest \nfactor in incidence of non-compliance; nearly every substantive provision requires additional \nsecurity personnel to implement.  The Monitor’s First Report detailed 11 initial \nrecommendations for immediate action that the Monitoring Team believes would begin to \naddress staff vacancies and some of the associated deficiencies.5  The City authorized PDP to \nimplement some of the recommendations, which has resulted in some improvements.  For other \nrecommendations, the City appears to have taken little or no action, without explanation, over \nthree reporting periods.   \n \nIn December 2023, the City committed to take additional action on some of the Monitoring \nTeam’s recommendations but cited legal barriers to others.  Despite progress in some areas over \nfour reporting periods and nearly two years of compliance monitoring, the City’s efforts to \nreduce PDP’s dangerously high vacancy rates have failed.  PDP facilities remain unsafe for both \nstaff and Class Members.  Frequent staff assaults, fights, stabbings, rampant contraband and \nextortion, and security breaches have been made possible or exacerbated by the staffing shortage.  \nAny recruitment or hiring gains are negated by attrition and an expanding incarcerated \npopulation.  PDP staff make noble efforts to correct deficiencies but have clearly reached their \ncapacity, and the Monitoring Team does not anticipate additional meaningful progress without a \ndramatic influx of new staff.    \n \nPhiladelphia is neither alone in its challenges to staff its law enforcement agencies amid a \nnational staffing crisis nor is it ignoring its obligations under the Agreement.  Its efforts, \nhowever, do not reflect the urgency and enormity of its problem and the life-threatening \nconditions it breeds.  PDP has not received the support necessary to reach the lowest \nconstitutional baseline, let alone the cultural transformation that sustaining any reform will \nrequire.  The City has instead pursued a course of half measures steeped in bureaucratic and \npolitical rigidity with devastating consequences for Class Members and PDP staff.      \n \n \n3 Site visits were conducted July 28, 2023, August 30, 2023, September 27, 2023, October 27, 2023, November 6-9, \n2023, and December 18, 2023. \n4 See Monitor’s First Report, Remick v.

Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 7 of 69\nCompliance Findings \n \nSome of the Agreement’s 18 substantive provisions contain related but discrete action items that \nmust be completed for PDP to achieve substantial compliance with each provision.  The \nMonitoring Team created sub-provisions for some of the 18 substantive provisions based on \nthese discrete action items and issues separate compliance findings for each enumerated sub-\nprovision.  This provides additional clarity for Defendants as they work to implement required \nchanges and greater specificity for the Court and Parties in distinguishing between action items \nthat are being successfully implemented and those that require additional attention.  To achieve \nsubstantial compliance with each substantive provision, PDP must first achieve substantial \ncompliance with every sub-provision.   \n \nFrom the Agreement’s 18 substantive provisions, 37 sub-provisions were created.  In the \nprevious reporting period, the Monitor determined that PDP had achieved substantial compliance \nwith 9 sub-provisions, partial compliance with 21 sub-provisions, and remained in non-\ncompliance with 7 sub-provisions.  In this reporting period, PDP has achieved substantial \ncompliance with 11 sub-provisions, partial compliance with 19 sub-provisions, and remained in \nnon-compliance with 7 sub-provisions. \n \nThe table below reflects all provisions and current compliance ratings for each: \n \nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n1  Staffing  PC \n1.1  No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, including but  PC \nnot limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the hiring of correctional \nofficers. \n1.2  No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, including but  PC \nnot limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the retention of correctional \nofficers. . . \n1.3  Ensure that there are sufficient number of correctional officers to cover all posts,  NC \naccording to PDP post plans on each shift at each facility. \n1.4  These measures [1.1-1.3] will continue until achieved and thereafter to maintain the  NC \nproper number of correctional officers. \n \n2  Out-of-Cell Time  PC \n2.1  Upon the entry of this Agreement, and no later than May 15, 2022, Defendants shall  PC \nensure that each incarcerated person at the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (PDP), \nwith the exception of those who are housed in a designated segregation unit, shall be \nprovided the following out-of-cell times for the following periods: (a) no later than \nMay 15, 2022, no less than four hours of out-of-cell time each day; and (b) no later \nthan August 1, 2022, no less than five hours of out-of-cell time each day. \n  6 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 8 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n2.2  The parties agree that out-of-cell times under normal operations of the PDP have  NC \nranged from 8-10 hours a day and increases of out-of-cell time should continue to be \nmade beyond the August 1, 2022 standard, with a presumptive expected increase to \nsix hours by October 15, 2022.  The parties agree that this next step shall be based on \nthe recommendations of the Court appointed Monitor, infra, para. 19, as to scope and \ntiming. Accordingly, the Monitor shall provide recommendations to the Court, based \non the Monitor’s analysis of all relevant factors and proposals by the parties, on the \nnext increase in out-of-cell time no later than October 1, 2022, and thereafter on a \nquarterly basis.  See also para. 4, infra. \n3  Out-of-Cell/Segregation  PC \n3.1  Defendants shall ensure that persons on segregation units shall be provided: (a) no  NC \nlater than May 1, 2022, thirty minutes out-of-cell time on a daily basis and (b) no \nlater than July 1, 2022, no less than one hour each day.       \n3.2  Defendants further agree that they will continue their practice of not placing  PC \nincarcerated people in segregation units due to the lack of space or staffing on other \nunits. \n4  Resume Normal Operations  NC \n   \nBy November 1, 2022, based on discussions between the parties and the Court-\nappointed Monitor, the parties and the Monitor shall submit to the Court a plan for a \nreturn to normal operations of the PDP (regarding out-of-cell time, programming, \nvisits, and other services).  During the period that precedes a return to normal \noperations, if the Monitor determines that the Defendants are not providing the \nagreed-upon out-of-cell time, Defendants must provide specific reasons for non-\ncompliance to the Plaintiffs and the Monitor.  The parties and the Monitor shall then \nengage in discussions to resolve the issues in dispute.  If no agreement is reached, \nDefendants may move for the amendment or modification of these provisions, but \nonly upon good cause shown, and the Plaintiffs may move for appropriate \ni ntervention by the Court, including possible contempt of court sanctions. \n5  Healthcare  PC \n   \nThe Defendants shall provide adequate and timely medical and mental health \ntreatment to all incarcerated persons.  The Defendants agree to institute the programs \nand measures (referred to as “the Backlog Plan”) set forth by Bruce Herdman, PDP \nChief of Medical Operations, at his deposition of March 21, 2022, to address the \nexisting backlog.  The “Backlog Plan” is a new, three-month effort to see backlogged \npatients as soon as possible.  The City has allocated substantial funding to allow \nCorizon Health services to engage additional agency staff to augment its full-time \nstaff to further reduce backlogs.  Four agencies are contracted to provide staff \ntowards this end. Agencies will provide additional providers, including MD/DOs, \nNPs, LCSWs, and RNs for this effort.  Based on these programs and measures, the \nDefendants agree to substantially eliminate the existing backlog by August 1, 2022, \nand thereafter to continue addressing any remaining backlog consistent with these \nprograms and measures.  Substantial elimination shall mean reduction to a backlog of \nn o more than ten to fifteen percent of the current backlog. \n6  Behavioral Health in Segregation  PC \n   \nBy September 30, 2022, the PDP and [YesCare] shall re-establish a mental health \nprogram for persons who are in segregation units. \n7  Law Library Access  PC \n  7 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 9 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \n  Sta tus \nPDP will continue to provide law library access for all incarcerated individuals.  The \nMonitor and the parties will discuss access and scheduling matters and the Monitor \nshall make any recommendations on these matters by August 1, 2022. \n8  Discipline  PC \n8.1  All future disciplinary proceedings at the PDP shall be held in accord with established  PC \ndue process rights, including the presence of the incarcerated person who is the \nsubject of the proceeding.  See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563–66 (1974); \nKanu v. Lindsey, 739 F. App’x 111, 116 (3d Cir. 2018); Stevenson v. Carroll, 495 \nF.3d 62, 70–71 (3d Cir. 2007). \n8.2  The PDP shall expunge the disciplinary records for all persons who were not  SC \npresent at their disciplinary hearings for the period March 2020 to the current date \n[April 12, 2022]. . . \n8.3  [PDP shall] release from segregation all incarcerated persons who were not present at  SC \ntheir disciplinary hearings but who are [on April 12, 2022] still serving a disciplinary \nsentence, or who are in administrative segregation following a disciplinary sentence \nimposed without a hearing. . . \n8.4  [PDP shall] cancel sanctions [imposed in hearing held between March 2020 and   SC \nApril 12, 2022] that require payments for damage to property or other restitution, \nand/or return payments made by persons who were required to pay for damage to \nproperty or other harms.  Provided, however, the PDP may seek to conduct due \nprocess hearings for individuals covered by this provision who are still in segregation, \nbut only: (a) if there is a small and discrete number of such cases, and (b) upon first \nproviding counsel for Plaintiffs the names of those persons, the disciplinary charges, \nand information related to the length of placement in segregation.  Nothing in this \nsection prohibits persons subject to the disciplinary process set forth above from \nasserting individual legal challenges to the discipline.  Defendants shall provide to \ncounsel for plaintiffs a list of individuals and disciplinary matters subject to this \nexception by April 15, 2022. \n9  Tablets  PC \n9.1  PDP has undertaken expansion efforts to increase the number of tablets available  PC \nwithin the PDP facilities by adding eighty (80) additional tablets, according to \noperational capabilities and housing designs.  The expansion of tablets is as follows: \nfrom four (4) to six (6) tablets on each housing unit at CFCF for a total of fifty-six \n(56) additional tablets; and, at RCF, expanding from six (6) to eight (8) tablets on the \n[first floor] (4 housing units) and expanding from eight (8) to twelve (12) tablets on \nthe [2nd and 3rd floors] of RCF (4 larger units) for a total of twenty-four (24) \nadditional tablets at RCF.  This expansion process will be completed by May 1, 2022. \n9.2  The parties and the Monitor will discuss any future increases in the number of tablets  PC \nbased on all relevant factors, including operational feasibility and physical capacity. \nFurther, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies and practices \nare necessary to address equitable and fair individual access to available tablets, and \nif so, the PDP shall implement agreed upon practices. \n10  Phone Calls  PC \n  8 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 10 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n10.1  PDP agrees to maintain 15 minutes of free phone calls on a daily basis for the PDP  PC \npopulation.  Further, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies \nand practices are necessary to address equitable and fair individual access to phones \nand, if so, the PDP shall implement agreed upon practices. \n10.2  Upon a return to normal operations, the PDP will revert to the provision of 10  NC \nminutes of free phone calls. \n11  PICC Emergency Call Systems  PC \n  The Monitor and the parties shall discuss the issues unique to PICC regarding  PC \nemergency call systems and access to phones and/or tablets and determine whether \nany policies and practices are necessary to address this matter considering all relevant \nfactors, including operational feasibility and physical capacity. \n12  Locks  PC \n12.1  PDP initiated the lock replacement program for PICC. . . which will be completed by  SC \nJune 30, 2022. \n12.2   PDP initiated the lock replacement program for. . .RCF, which will be completed by  SC \nJune 30, 2022. \n12.3  For the repair of call button devices in existing facilities, PDP will conduct a one-time  SC \ntest of all call buttons and make any necessary repairs by August 1, 2022. \n12.4  Any future complaints related to the operation of call buttons shall be addressed  PC \nthrough work orders, which will be addressed and completed by Defendants in a \ntimely manner. \n12.5  PDP will provide refresher training before June 1, 2022, to correctional staff on PDP  SC \npractices with respect to responses to the emergency call button system. \n13  Visiting  PC \n13.1  As of March 7, 2022, PDP reinstituted in-person visitation for all vaccinated  SC \nincarcerated persons with family members. PDP is in the process of increasing \ncapacity for in-person visits by increasing the number of visits that can be \naccommodated during the current hourly schedule.  At a minimum, current CFCF \nvisiting shall be increased by 8 slots, PICC increased by 4 slots, and RCF increased \nby 2 slots. \n13.2  Further, the parties and Monitor shall discuss all matters related to visitation, and the  PC \nmonitor shall issue recommendations on these issues. \n13.3  PDP reaffirms that it will acknowledge and record the vaccination status of those  SC \nindividuals who provide information that they were vaccinated. \n14  Attorney Visiting  PC \n14.1  PDP shall continue to follow a policy of providing attorneys with access to their  PC \nclients within 45 minutes of their scheduled visit. \n14.2  For remote legal visits (in all formats), the PDP shall continue to ensure that the client  PC \nis on the call/computer/video within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time of the \nappointment. \n  9 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 11 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n14.3  For these time frames, PDP will not be responsible for delays caused by the  NC \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, but where a delay is caused by the \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, PDP will inform the attorney of the \ndelay. \n15  COVID-19 Testing  SC \n   \nThe PDP shall continue the present policy regarding testing of persons who are \nscheduled for court.  Those who are housed on “green blocks” are either fully \nvaccinated or are not considered to have been exposed to COVID-19.  They will be \nrapid-tested the night before court, and they will be brought to court if they receive \nnegative test results.  Those housed on a “yellow block” may have been exposed to a \nCOVID-19-positive individual, and they will be rapid-tested twice, the night before \ncourt and the morning of court.  They will be transported to court if both tests are \nnegative.  Those housed on a “red block” are COVID-19 positive and will be isolated \nfor ten days and not brought to court during that time frame.  These protocols will be \nmaintained subject to continued cooperation from criminal justice partners and on the \nadvice of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.  Provided, however, that the \nDefendants shall not unilaterally change the protocols and they shall timely notify \nP  laintiffs’ counsel of any change or proposed change in these protocols. \n16  Quarantine  SC \n \nIf there becomes a need in the future for use of quarantine housing areas at PDP,     \nCDC guidelines shall continue to be followed for those who have been exposed to \nCOVID-19.  Under current policy, see Interim Guidance on Management for \nCorrectional and Detention Centers, June 9, 2021, for persons who are vaccinated \nand are exposed to a person with COVID-19, but test negative, they shall not be \nquarantined; for those who have been exposed to COVID-19, but who have not been \nvaccinated, and test negative, they shall be quarantined for a period of ten days and \nreleased at that time if they test negative. \n17  Sanitation  PC \n17.1  Defendants agree to continue conducting the weekly General Inspection (“GI”)  PC \ncleaning days with supplies provided by officers to clean cells and housing areas. \n17.2  [Defendants agree] to provide regular laundry services under current PDP policies.  PC \n18  Use-of-Force  PC \n   \nPDP policies and training address correctional staff’s use of force, use of pepper \nspray, de-escalation measures, and an incarcerated person’s non-compliance with \nverbal commands.  The parties agree that correctional officers should follow de-\nescalation measures provided in PDP policies.  The Monitor shall review these issues \nand make recommendations based on a review of all relevant material and factors.  In \nthe interim, PDP shall advise and re-train correctional officers on the proper \napplication of the Use of Force and Restraints Policy, 3.A.8, and with respect to de-\nescalation requirements in accordance with the PDP policy which in part states: \n“Force is only used when necessary and only to the degree required to control the \ninmate(s) or restore order…The use of pepper spray is justifiable when the Officer’s \npresence and verbal command options have been exhausted and the inmate remains \nnon-compliant or the inmate’s level of resistance has escalated….Staff will not use \npepper spray as a means of punishment, personal abuse, or harassment.” \n  \n  10 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 12 of 69\nSubstantive Provision 1—Staffing   \n \nSub-provision 1.1--No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, \nincluding but not limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the hiring of correctional \nofficers. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n  \nPDP’s correctional officer vacancies increased by 79 positions or 4 percent from June 2023 to \nDecember 2023.

Since \nDecember 2022, hiring yields have decreased from 8.3 percent to 7.5 percent, representing a 10 \npercent decrease.7  Of 3,007 applicants from 2020 through early 2023, only 227 were hired.  This \nsuggests PDP would have needed approximately 9,000 more applicants to fill the existing 893 \nsecurity vacancies, and 1,500 additional applicants to address the annual attrition of 160 security \nstaff.  The current efforts are not keeping up with attrition as reflected by the increase in total \n \n6 The number of filled security positions decreased from 1,120 to 1,033 or 8 percent from December 2022 to \nDecember 2023.  \n7 See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 13. \n  12 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 14 of 69\ncustody vacancies between June 2023 and December 2023, and the problem is compounded as \nthe incarcerated population increases.  \n \nAcademies and Retention \n \nPDP successfully increased the number of academies in 2023 over 2021 and 2022, however, \nretention rates remain low.

For new staff who graduated from an academy in \n2023, the retention rate as of December 2023 was 84 percent.  The Monitoring Team will revisit \nrates at the end of 2024 to determine whether one-year retention of the 2023 graduates improved \nover the 40 percent one-year retention of 2022 graduates.   \n \nTo improve internal monitoring of critical issues, including staff hiring and retention, the City \nhas authorized PDP to create a six-person data analysis unit.  The analyst team can also evaluate \nPDP’s use of segregation, out-of-cell time, access to care, grievances, use of force, and other \nAgreement requirements.  The team is also expected to analyze outcomes of PDP’s various \npolicy changes. \n  13 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 15 of 69\n \nSub-provision 1.2--No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, \nincluding but not limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the retention of \ncorrectional officers. . . \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nIn 2019 and 2020, PDP lost averages of 10 and 11 officers per month respectively.  In 2021 and \nthe first eight months of 2022, average separations more than doubled to 24 and 23 per month \nrespectively.  In the last four months of 2022, after salary increases and retention bonuses went \ninto effect, monthly average severances reduced to 11 per month.  In 2023, the number of \naverage employee separations per month increased to 13 but remained lower than 2021, \nsuggesting salary incentives had a positive effect.

Without additional personnel, however, PDP will be unable to \nimplement a meaningful employee wellness program as recommended.  Improving staff morale \nand employee retention initially requires a safe working environment, which PDP does not \ncurrently offer.   \n \nSub-provision 1.3--Ensure that there are sufficient numbers of correctional officers to cover all \nposts, according to PDP post plans on each shift at each facility. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n \nIn this reporting period, PDP finalized its new system to track the number of required posts for \neach shift at each facility and the number of vacant posts due to staffing shortages.  This was a \ncomplex project and an important accomplishment for PDP.   \n \nThe following tables depict monthly average percentages of vacant posts at each facility and \nposts filled with overtime staff for September through December 2023:8 \n \n \n \n \n8 Some posts may have been filled for a portion of some shifts. \n  14 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 16 of 69\nPercentage of Posts Left Vacant Due to Staffing Shortage \nSeptember – December 2023 \n  \nDate  September  October  November  December  Average \nRCF  42%  39%  30%  36%  37% \nPICC  42%  45%  35%  42%  41% \nCFCF  45%  46%  34%  41%  42% \nAverage  43%  43%  33%  40%  40% \n \nPercentage of Posts Filled with Overtime Staff \nSeptember – December 2023 \n  \nFacility  September  October  November  December  Average \nRCF  25%  24%  21%  23%  23% \nPICC  25%  27%  30%  30%  28% \nCFCF  27%  22%  22%  24%  24% \nAverage  26%  24%  24%  26%  25% \n \nAs anticipated, the number of vacant posts is unacceptably high, and would be higher without the \nuse of significant voluntary and involuntary overtime.  From September through December 2023, \nan average of 40 percent of posts remained vacant and an average of 25 percent of posts were \nfilled with overtime staff.  This suggests PDP is only able to fill an average of 35 percent of \nnecessary posts with regularly scheduled shifts.   \n \nPDP has also initiated improvements to its transportation and medical guarding of Class Member \npatients at outside hospitals.  PDP coordinated with other local law enforcement to share \nguarding responsibilities for Class Members who are at outside hospitals and have not yet been \nprocessed into the jail.  PDP reports it is also in contract negotiations to re-establish a secure unit \nat an outside hospital, which will allow PDP patients to be housed together in a single hospital \nwing.  These improvements will reduce the number of personnel being redirected from jail posts \nto outside hospitals. \n \nSub-provision 1.4--These measures will continue until achieved and thereafter to maintain the \nproper number of correctional officers. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance   \n \nA partial or substantial compliance rating with sub-provision 1.4 first requires PDP to achieve \ncompliance with sub-provision 1.3.  \n     \nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 1—Staffing, from the Monitor’s First \nReport (November 2022): \n   \n  15 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 17 of 69\n1.  Expand existing contracts to correct maintenance vacancies that severely impact conditions \nof confinement at ASD-CU and MOD 3, DC, and PICC.  \nThe City has partially addressed this recommendation.  In December 2023, the City \nreported it had accepted this recommendation and is in the process of expanding the \ncurrent maintenance contract to include routine and emergency maintenance not \ncurrently being performed as a result of City maintenance vacancies.  As previously \nreported and discussed in more detail below under Substantive Provision 17—Sanitation, \nthe contract was temporarily expanded in April 2023, and improvements were noticeable \nduring subsequent site visits.   \n \nPDP reports that maintenance contract expansion included the new, more effective \nvector control program at PICC but did not include enhanced vector control at \nDC/PHSW or MOD 3.  These facilities continue to be managed under the City’s existing, \nless effective vector control contract.  PDP reports it has requested that the City’s \nexisting contractor increase the frequency of scheduled treatments in DC/PHSW and \nMOD 3, but the contractor reported it lacks capacity to scale up.  PDP reports it does \nnot have the authority to further expand the maintenance contract to include all PDP \nfacilities outside of the City’s current procurement process and must instead wait for the \nCity’s existing contract to expire. \n \nPDP also reports the planned maintenance contract expansion does not include the \ncompletion of capital projects.  A few of PDP’s outstanding capital projects in populated \nhousing units include the replacement of antiquated cell doors in some segregation units, \nHVAC upgrades, repair of windows and vents that cannot be secured to reduce entry \nports for rodents or during inclement weather, and the construction of dayroom tables for \nClass Members to use during out-of-cell time.   \n \nAs a result of these remaining contract and procurement issues, rodent and insect \ninfestations are still regularly observable in some facilities, doors in some segregation \nunits lack food ports necessary for staff safety, some units lack furniture for Class \nMembers to sit on when not confined to their cells, and cold winter air blows through ill-\nfitting windows in at least two units that house elderly Class Members.  The Monitoring \nTeam, therefore, makes additional recommendations 12 and 13 below for immediate \naction.    \n2.  Determine whether the current salary and benefits structures pursuant to the arbitration award \nand other efforts by Defendants are sufficiently competitive with other jurisdictions and \nagencies to attract applicants, and if not, supplement benefits accordingly. \nThe City has partially addressed this recommendation.  In December 2023, the City \nprovided documentation of a comparison of correctional officer salaries in local \njurisdictions.  The City cited this comparison as the basis for determining that PDP \ncompensation is competitive.  The City also indicated that it was conducting a Citywide \ncompensation study with results expected in January 2024.  The Monitoring Team has \nnot received the study for review.  Documentation provided gives no indication that that \nCity also evaluated benefits structures (including pensions and other forms of \ncompensation), whether current salary and benefits are sufficient to attract enough \ncandidates, or whether current salary and benefits should be supplemented.  This work \n  16 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 18 of 69\nmay have been more appropriately performed by an outside firm with more time and \nspecific expertise as initially recommended in the Monitor’s First Report and restated \nunder recommendation 3 below.9       \n3.  Retain a qualified recruitment firm to assist in guiding the City’s efforts, which should \ninclude salary surveys in support of the previous recommendation, and other validated \nrecruitment and retention strategies.   \nIn December 2023, the City indicated that it would accept this recommendation and \npursue additional recruitment support from a firm currently under contract with the City.  \nThe City also indicated that it intends to expand a second existing contract with another \nrecruitment firm to include recruitment of correctional peace officers.     \n4.  Engage an independent staffing analysis to determine true staffing needs for each facility.  \nThe analysis should be completed by someone with specific expertise in jail staffing studies. \nPDP reports that the anticipated staffing study was completed and a report was received \nby PDP in January 2024.  The City shared the report March 7, 2024. \n5.  Evaluate which PDP functions currently performed by sworn personnel can be performed by \ncivilians (information technology, records, intake and release, cashier, etc.) and identify or \nexpand civilian employees or contracted services accordingly. \n  PDP reports that two arbitration hearings were scheduled in December, a third in \n  January, and a fourth in February, all of which were canceled.    \n6.  Simplify the City’s lengthy hiring and onboarding processes that reportedly create delays in \nrecruits reporting to PDP academies.   \nIn December 2023, the City reported that it had reduced its hiring timeframe from two \nmonths to approximately one month, beginning in 2021.  This reported change, which \noccurred before compliance monitoring began in 2022, is positive.  The City did not \nindicate whether it has taken any action pursuant to this recommendation, or whether the \nprocess is now as efficient as possible or requires further refinement.   \n7.  Establish continuous-fill civil service hiring lists during the staffing crisis. \nThe City has implemented back-to-back hiring lists, which essentially provides for the \ncontinuous-fill process as recommended. \n8.  Assess the impact of Philadelphia’s employee residency requirements on PDP’s hiring \noutcomes and consider whether permanent exemptions or modifications are appropriate. \nIn December 2023, the City reported that it retained a firm to complete an internal \nassessment of the residency requirement.  The City did not indicate when the assessment \nwas initiated or completed but reports, “[t]he assessment provided various data points \nand recommendations when considering changes to the residency requirements.”  The \nCity asserts it cannot unilaterally change the requirement citing City of Philadelphia \nHome Rule Charter and collective bargaining requirements.  The City did not address \nwhether it has considered temporary modifications to or suspension of the requirements \nand did not provide or share findings or recommendations from the assessment.      \n9.  PDP should implement strategies for employee retention and a robust employee wellness \nprogram.   \n \n9 See Monitor’s First Report, supra note 4, at 20.  \n  17 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 19 of 69\nPDP has partially addressed this recommendation.  PDP reports it initiated employee \nwellness training in 2023 and is in the process of hiring a manager to serve as the \nemployee wellness lead.   \n10. The City should implement a return-to-work strategy that is tailored to the needs of PDP \nemployees who are out on long-term leave or work-related illness.   \nThe City has partially addressed this recommendation.  In December 2023, the City \nreported it initiated discussions with PDP to enhance return-to-work strategies in \nJanuary 2023.  Strategies reportedly included prioritizing PDP’s worker’s compensation \nclaims and increasing involvement of healthcare staff in the review process.  The City \nalso reportedly changed the medical panel provider and worked with PDP to develop a \nlocal light duty return-to-work strategy.  The City reported that when the project began \nin early 2023, there were approximately 100 employees off work due to work-related \ninjuries.  That number reportedly reduced to 40 by November 2023, and another 44 \nemployees on long-term leave were separated from PDP service.  The City should ensure \nit makes every effort to return injured employees to work as soon as possible, if only to \nlight duty assignments.  The City should also ensure that well-trained return-to-work \nspecialists are engaging off-work employees quickly and frequently.  The Departments of \nRisk Management and Human Resources should also ensure they are evaluating \nemployee injuries to improve PDP’s employee safety program.    \n11. Retain an expert to build internal capacity to manage systems, coding, and budgetary processes \nassociated with staffing allocations.  The expert should assist PDP in identifying and retaining \nonly the most useful database reports and discontinuing the use of non-essential or inaccurate \nreports.   \nPDP implemented this recommendation, increased internal capacity, and developed \ntransparent systems designed to maximize limited staffing resources. \n \nAdditional recommendations for immediate action: \n \n12. The City should authorize PDP to immediately implement an effective vector control \nprogram at DC/PHSW and MOD 3.   \n13. The City should expand its maintenance contract or redeploy City personnel to expedite the \ncompletion of capital projects.  PDP should prioritize projects that pose health and safety \nrisks in populated housing units.             \n14. Immediately authorize additional double-time pay each day of the week as necessary to staff \nall vacant shifts. \nIn December 2023, the City reported it consistently authorizes double-time pay to cover \nnecessary posts.  However, data provided by the City to support this assertion suggests \ndouble-time pay is routinely offered Thursdays and Sundays, but not Fridays and \nSaturdays, which consistently have higher post vacancy rates.  The City suggests that \nemployees may be rejecting additional double-time opportunities but this assertion is not \nsupported by documentation provided.  The City and PDP should immediately evaluate \nwhether additional double-time pay would reduce post vacancies and authorize \nadditional double-time pay and other incentives as needed to cover as many PDP posts \nas possible. \n  18 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 20 of 69\n15. The City should establish a well-resourced team to assist with recruitment, application \nprocessing, onboarding, and supporting new staff.  The team should conduct meaningful exit \ninterviews of staff leaving PDP to determine what is needed to improve retention.     \n \n \nSubstantive Provision 2—Out-of-Cell Time  \n \nSub-provision 2.1--Upon the entry of this Agreement, and no later than May 15, 2022, \nDefendants shall ensure that each incarcerated person at the Philadelphia Department of \nPrisons (PDP), with the exception of those who are housed in a designated segregation unit, \nshall be provided the following out-of-cell times for the following periods: (a) no later than  \nMay 15, 2022, no less than four hours of out-of-cell time each day; and (b) no later than  \nAugust 1, 2022, no less than five hours of out-of-cell time each day. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nIn this reporting period, PDP offered additional training in the proper documentation of out-of-\ncell time.  The training appears to have improved tracking of group out-of-cell time in general \npopulation housing units.  Out-of-cell trackers in this reporting period generally appear to reflect \nmore accurate timeframes and more often denote when no out-of-cell time is offered.  Although \ntrackers are being completed more consistently, the only method of verifying reported data \nremains CCTV review.   \n \nIn this reporting period, the Monitoring Team reviewed general population housing unit out-of-\ncell trackers for one week per month, July through December 2023.  As previously reported, \nClass Members with different security classifications are often housed together in single housing \nunits because of bed space and staffing limitations.10  Class Members with different security \nclassifications, however, are not permitted to recreate together and are instead divided into \nsmaller recreation groups.  The numbers and sizes of recreation groups differ in each housing \nunit and may fluctuate significantly based on security and other operational needs.   \n \nThe following tables depict average out-of-cell time that CFCF general population recreation \ngroups received daily for one week of each month, April through June 2023, and July through \nDecember 2023: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 19.  \n  19 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 21 of 69\nGeneral Population Average Out-of-Cell Time \nHours Per Day  \nCFCF, Three One-Week Periods* \nApril – Ju ne 202311 \n \n  Monthly Average \nHours  Groups  Percent (%) \n0 to .9   32  26% \n1 to 4.9  67  54% \n≥ 5, < 6  25  20% \nTotal CFCF Groups  124  100% \n                        *Weeks reviewed include: April 3-9, May 1-7, and June 5-11.   \n \nGeneral Population Average Out-of-Cell Time Per Day Reported for CFCF,  \nSix One-Week Periods* \nJuly – December 2023 \n \n  July-Sept 2023   Oct-Dec 2023  Monthly Average \nHours**  Groups  %  Groups  %  Groups  % \n0 to .9   35  19%  45  16 %  13  17% \n1 to 4.9  118  63%  229  81%  58  74% \n≥ 5, < 6  33  18%  10  3%  7  9% \nTotal CFCF   \nGroups  186  100%  284  100%  78  100% \n*Weeks reviewed include: July 10-16, August 7-13, September 4-10, October 9-15, November 13-19, \nand December 18-24.

In the first two \nreporting periods, Class Members were regularly held in administrative segregation without \nhearings beyond 30, 60, and 90 days at all three facilities.16  In this reporting period, none of the \nfacilities on dates reviewed held Class Members in administrative segregation without hearings \nbeyond 60 or 90 days, and hearings exceeding 30 days were limited to CFCF and reduced by an \naverage of 80 percent.  Eleven of 13 delayed hearings at CFCF occurred in the months of \nNovember and December 2023. \n \n15 Percentages were calculated based on monthly averages for two six-month periods, July-December 2022 and July-\nDecember 2023, as reported in the Philadelphia Prison Population Reports.

Their work could also include \ntrend analysis or address variables such as reasons for placement, population increases, \ndemographic changes, system-wide violence and violent segregation commitment offenses, the \nexpansion of transitional units, and enhanced programming. \n \nPDP has permanently discontinued the automatic placement of state sentenced Class Members \ninto administrative segregation based solely on their state commitments.17  The Monitoring Team \ncontinues to recommend additional policy revisions to reduce automatic placements of Class \nMembers in administrative segregation based solely on static factors such as “no bail/high bail” \nand “change in custody level.”   \n  \nOn December 29, 2023, eight Class Members remained in administrative segregation beyond 90 \ndays.  Three of the eight had been removed from segregation by mid-January 2024. Three Class \nMembers who remained in administrative segregation as of mid-January 2024 were determined \nto have committed serious assaults and additional misconduct while in segregation or a serious \nescape attempt.  One Class Member was in segregation based on protective custody status and \nwas no longer in PDP custody as of mid-January 2024.  One Class Member was in segregation at \nCFCF for 227 days as of December 29, 2023, for on-going disciplinary actions.  This Class \nMember is on the Behavioral Health caseload.  In the next reporting period, the Monitoring \nTeam will evaluate behavioral healthcare records for a sample of patients on the behavioral \nhealth caseload who are in segregation.    \n \nThe following tables depict total punitive segregation placements and average lengths of stay in \npunitive segregation for sample dates, July through December 2022, January through June 2023, \nand July through December 2023:         \n \nClass Members in Punitive Segregation: Total Placements and Average Lengths of Stay  \nJuly – December 2022 \n   \nCFCF  PICC  RCF  Total \n \nTotal  Average Days  Total  Average Days  Total  Average Days  Total in  Average Days \nPunitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive \nSegregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation \n \nAverage  61  63  49  65  45  37  154  55 \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n17 PDP continues to periodically segregate a small number of state sentenced Class Members for short periods while \nthey await movement to their designated housing unit.

The total average number of Class Members in \npunitive segregation reduced by four percent, from 154 to 148, in the same period.   \n \nDespite overall reductions in PDP’s use of punitive segregation from 2022 to 2023, both punitive \nsegregation placements and lengths of stay increased at CFCF and RCF from the first half of \n2023 to the second half of the year.  Also, the total average number of Class Members in punitive \nsegregation increased by six percent and lengths of stay increased by eleven percent.  PICC, \nhowever, has consistently reduced its use of punitive segregation since 2022.   \n \nPDP’s efforts to reduce its reliance on administrative and punitive segregation must remain a \npriority given the risks associated with isolation and PDP’s non-compliance with out-of-cell \n  28 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 30 of 69\nrequirements.  The Monitoring Team reiterates the following recommendations from the \nMonitor’s Second Report regarding out-of-cell time in segregation units:18 \n \n1.  Provide daily out-of-cell time for all Class Members, even if Agreement requirements cannot \nbe met.  PDP should reevaluate the current requirement that three officers must be present to \nprovide out-of-cell time.    \n2.  Ensure that current out-of-cell schedules are feasible for personnel to implement, that Class \nMembers receive schedules in advance, and that schedules are consistently adhered to.  \n3.  Use currently available information, including anecdotal reports from staff, supervisors, and \nClass Members, to identify and attend to housing units that are struggling to offer out-of-cell \ntime. \n4.  Document the reasons for any failures to offer out-of-cell time.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team has made the following recommendations over the course of \nimplementation monitoring to assist PDP in reducing its reliance on punitive segregation:  \n \n5.  Increase educational, therapeutic, and other positive programming in general population \nunits. \n6.  Utilize sanctions that do not require isolation, such as creating loss of privilege tiers where \nClass Members receive out-of-cell time but access to commissary, tablets, and phones is \nlimited or restricted. \n7.  Expand Therapeutic Housing Units, discussed below under Substantive Provision 6—\nBehavioral Health in Segregation, and develop accompanying disciplinary policies that limit \nthe placement of patients in isolation.   \n8.  Improve systems for behavioral health input in the disciplinary process, discussed below \nunder sub-provision 8.1. \n9.  Establish an interdisciplinary committee to create behavior management plans for Class \nMembers who cycle in and out of segregation.   \n10. Develop programming for Class Members in segregation units to address behavior and assist \nwith the transition back to general population.  \n11. Direct the new data analysis unit to analyze punitive segregation practices and trends. \n12. Revise classification policies and procedures to ensure they are designed to maximize \nprogramming and reserve segregation for those with the most serious behavioral issues for \nthe shortest possible durations. \n \nPDP has accepted the Monitoring Team’s recommendations and makes efforts in some areas but \nhas consistently reported it is unable to implement them with current staffing.       \n \nSubstantive Provision 4—Resume Normal Operations \n \nBy November 1, 2022, based on discussions between the parties and the Court-appointed \nMonitor, the parties and the Monitor shall submit to the Court a plan for a return to normal \noperations of the PDP (regarding out-of-cell time, programming, visits, and other services).  \nDuring the period that precedes a return to normal operations, if the Monitor determines that the \n \n18 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 22; Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 20.  \n  29 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 31 of 69\nDefendants are not providing the agreed-upon out-of-cell time, Defendants must provide specific \nreasons for non-compliance to the Plaintiffs and the Monitor.  The parties and the Monitor shall \nthen engage in discussions to resolve the issues in dispute.  If no agreement is reached, \nDefendants may move for the amendment or modification of these provisions, but only upon \ngood cause shown, and the Plaintiffs may move for appropriate intervention by the Court, \nincluding possible contempt of court sanctions. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n \nThe Monitor has continued to meet with the Parties regarding areas of non-compliance.  In this \nreporting period, meetings were held on the following dates:  October 16, 2023, November 6, \n2023, December 15, 2023, and February 5, 2024.  Multiple deficiencies have been discussed \nincluding out-of-cell time, segregation, facility sanitation and maintenance, and use of force.  \nThe primary focus of the meetings, however, remains the City’s insufficient efforts to address \nPDP’s staffing crisis, which is the root cause of persistent non-compliance.  The Parties have \nengaged in good faith exchanges, which have resulted in creative solutions to some operational \nchallenges, and meetings will continue in the next reporting period.   \n \nPDP’s only conceivable pathways to compliance remain some combination of population \nreduction and increased staffing, neither of which is within PDP’s unilateral control.  Absent \nimmediate solutions to PDP’s staffing crisis, the City should initiate a coordinated effort among \nlocal justice partners to pursue all opportunities for population reduction.  Initial efforts should \ninclude identifying and correcting inefficiencies in Philadelphia’s criminal justice process that \nprolong criminal cases and pre-trial detention.    \n   \nAs expected, PDP continues to report that it is not prepared to submit a plan for a return to \nnormal operations that includes out-of-cell time and access to services and programs required by \nthe Agreement.19  Due to PDP’s staffing deficiencies, the Monitoring Team has consistently \nrecommended that PDP prioritize reforms that:  (1) can be initiated with existing personnel and \n(2) are most likely to improve the daily experiences of Class Members.   \n \nAs recommendations were issued, it was unclear how much progress was possible and whether \nand for how long any progress achieved could be sustained.  PDP acknowledged that \nmonumental efforts were necessary given the conditions Class Members must endure and \nprogress has exceeded expectations in several areas.  Incremental improvements have been \nmade, but PDP is far from returning to its pre-COVID-19 operations or redefining “normal \noperations” based on the most current evidence-based practices.  Any projected timeframes for \nimplementation of this provision would be conjecture.     \n \nAs stated previously, PDP appears to have reached its capacity for interim change and will be \nunlikely to make additional progress or sustain improvements made thus far.  If so, PDP \nconditions will descend further into constitutional inadequacy and Class Members’ health and \nsafety will continue to decline.  Staff will remain in acute fear and the indignity of their working \n \n19 The Monitoring Team is working with PDP to ensure that “normal operations” is defined according to evidence-\nbased best practices at the time PDP is prepared to implement them.   \n  30 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 32 of 69\nconditions will remain a cultural bar to humane treatment of the 4,700 people confined in PDP \nfacilities. \n \nRestorative and Transitional Services \n \nClinical and other professional staff assigned to the Restorative and Transitional Services \nDivision (RTS) perform case management, release planning, counseling, and other important \nprograms and services.  Based on RTS staff vacancies and reported lapses in the provision of \nservices in the previous reporting period, the Monitoring Team recommended that PDP review \nRTS job descriptions to ensure it has allocated sufficient positions to offer all services consistent \nwith policy.20  In this reporting period, PDP reports it reclassified some existing RTS positions to \nbetter align with current staffing needs.

In addition to programs and services \ndescribed above, in 2023, RTS led the development of a behavioral modification unit \nrecommended by the Monitoring Team.  The goal of the behavioral modification unit is to offer \nindividual behavior modification plans and programming for a small subset of patients who \nexhibit extreme maladaptive behaviors.  These patients often spend extended periods in \nsegregation, are frequently hospitalized, and require substantial security and clinical resources.  \nGiven the increase in RTS staff vacancies, the Monitoring Team reiterates its recommendation to \nanalyze the work required of this division and the staffing needed to complete required tasks.   \n \nSubstantive Provision 5—Healthcare \n \nThe Defendants shall provide adequate and timely medical and mental health treatment to all \nincarcerated persons. The Defendants agree to institute the programs and measures (referred to \nas “the Backlog Plan”) set forth by Bruce Herdman, PDP Chief of Medical Operations, at his \ndeposition of March 21, 2022, to address the existing backlog. The “Backlog Plan” is a new, \nthree-month effort to see backlogged patients as soon as possible. The City has allocated \nsubstantial funding to allow Corizon Health services to engage additional agency staff to \naugment its full-time staff to further reduce backlogs.  Four agencies are contracted to provide \nstaff towards this end. Agencies will provide additional providers, including MD/DOs, NPs, \nLCSWs, and RNs for this effort. Based on these programs and measures, the Defendants agree to \nsubstantially eliminate the existing backlog by August 1, 2022, and thereafter to continue \naddressing any remaining backlog consistent with these programs and measures. Substantial \nelimination shall mean reduction to a backlog of no more than ten to fifteen percent of the \ncurrent backlog. \n \n  Compliance Rating: Partial Compliance  \n \nHealthcare staffing has continued to improve in this reporting period.  PDP has made efforts to \nreduce its appointment backlogs, but reductions have been largely temporary based on data \nthrough December 2023.  PDP reports the Access to Care Committee has continued to meet \nsince it was convened in November 2022, but has been unsuccessful in reducing overall backlogs \nto a level approaching compliance with this provision.  PDP reports in recent months delayed \nfacility counts, which can interfere with Class Members attending scheduled appointments, have \nposed new challenges to the provision of healthcare services.   \n \nThe table below compares on-site appointment backlogs for two four-week periods in May/June \n2023, and November/December 2023:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  32 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 34 of 69\nOn-Site Appointment Backlogs for General Medical and Behavioral Healthcare \nWeekly Averages, Four-week Comparison \nMay/June 2023 and November/December 2023 \n \nWeekly Average Backlogged \n     \nAppointments** \nBacklog Report Four- Percent Change \nMay-June 2023  Nov-Dec 2023  Change \nweek Period  (+/-) \nBH Initial Psychiatric Eval.  40  82  +42  +105% \nBH Medication Evaluation  42  73  +31  +74% \nBH Social Work Sick Call  15  25  +10  * \nBH SW SCTR  1  0  -1  * \nChronic Care Follow-up  171  268  +97  +57% \nChronic Care Initial  129  121  -8  -6% \nMAT  181  129  -52  -29% \nMAT Follow-up  1  0  -1  * \nProvider Sick Call  66  204  +138  +209% \nRN Sick Call  60  42  -18  * \nRe-Entry Planning  14  46  +32  * \nTotal Backlog  720  989  +269  +37% \n*Average percent change not calculated for average appointments <50. \n**Weeks reviewed include: 5/30/23 to 6/20/23 and 11/29/23 to 12/21/23. \n \nPDP’s average four-week on-site backlog (excluding reentry planning) was 944 in \nNovember/December 2023, which exceeded the 920 average backlog reported in \nOctober/November 2022.22  Despite hiring successes and a reported increase in healthcare staff, \nPDP’s average four-week backlog increased by 269 appointments, or 37 percent, between \nMay/June and November/December 2023.   \n \nWeekly backlog data for September 2023 reflects a spike to an average of 1402 backlogged \nappointments.  PDP reports the increase was caused in part by a fire at an off-site data center that \nhouses PDP’s electronic medical records, which blocked PDP’s access for more than one week.   \nDespite poor compliance reflected in data for this reporting period, PDP reports that the recent \ninflux of additional healthcare staff reduced the September 2023 spike by approximately 400 \nappointments to the average 989 reported in November/December 2023.  Preliminary data for \nFebruary 2024 shows the backlog was further reduced to 559 appointments as a result of staff \nadditions.  This is a significant improvement in a short period of time and PDP anticipates it will \nsustain improvements through the next reporting period. \n \nIn November 2023, PDP initiated a pilot program offering some types of primary and chronic \ncare appointments inside housing units rather than relying on security personnel to escort \npatients to on-site medical clinics.  The housing unit spaces being used for patient care are not \n \n22 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 26.   \n  33 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 35 of 69\nideal and are not designated clinical spaces.  As such, healthcare services offered in the housing \nunits are limited to sick call triage, behavioral health sick call appointments, and other services \nthat do not require physical contact with patients.  The pilot is currently limited to CFCF and \nRCF because other PDP facilities reportedly lack space for clinical care.   \n \nOn-Site Specialty Care \n \nOn-site specialty appointments represent nine percent of the overall backlog.23  The on-site \nspecialty backlog decreased by 25 percent, from 189 appointments in the previous reporting \nperiod to 141 in this reporting period.  As previously reported, a single provider absence in June \n2023 resulted in a backlog of 126 pap test and gynecology appointments, or 67 percent of the \ntotal on-site backlog at that time.24  In this reporting period, that backlog reduced to 13 \nappointments, or nine percent of the total backlog.  In this reporting period, provider \nunavailability has resulted in an increase in backlogged podiatry appointments, from 15 in June \n2023 to 54 in December 2023.   \n \nPDP reports it has begun to offer on-site specialty care appointments at facility clinics rather than \nrequiring patients to be escorted to the main clinic at DC/PHSW.  Changes like this reduce \nreliance on security escorts but also reduce the efficiency of providers who must now move \nbetween facilities across PDP’s compound to see patients.   \n \nOff-Site Specialty Care \n \nDeficiencies in off-site specialty care are worsening.  In December 2022, PDP’s off-site \nappointment backlog was 172 scheduled appointments and 50 awaiting scheduling.  In June \n2023, the backlog was 187 scheduled appointments and 43 awaiting scheduling, reflecting little \nchange.  In December 2023, the backlog had grown to 375 scheduled appointments with 116 \npending scheduling.  The following table depicts off-site specialty appointments scheduled and \nattended from July through December 2023:  \n \n23 PDP offers on-site specialty services in obstetrics, gynecology, optometry, pap testing, podiatry, physical therapy, \nultrasound, and x-ray. For on-site specialty appointments, specialty providers come to PDP and treat patients on-site.  \nThe on-site specialty backlog is sensitive to minor staffing changes or provider absences. \n24 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 30.  \n  34 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 36 of 69\nOff-Site Specialty Appointment Summary  \nJuly – December 2023 \n \nMonth  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec  Total \n# Scheduled  340  402  339  439  499  419  2438 \nOut of Custody  16  24  10  24  21  20  115 \nOut of Jurisdiction/Open Ward  7  7  3  4  10  6  37 \nCancel Prior to Transport  17  12  10  23  7  21  90 \nCOVID-19 Isolation  0  3  0  1  0  0  4 \nTotal Ineligible  40  46  23  52  38  47  199 \n# Eligible to Attend Appointment  300  356  316  387  461  372  2192 \nRefused  28  25  30  38  46  44  211 \nC/O Shortage  76  132  122  160  220  193  903 \nCancelled at Office  3  3  0  1  4  0  11 \nScheduling Error  6  2  0  3  4  1  16 \nCourt  6  4  5  2  1  4  22 \nLate to Appointment  12  3  5  8  5  6  39 \nOther  3  13  5  6  19  4  50 \nTotal NOT Seen  134  182  169  218  299  252  1254 \nTotal Seen  166  174  147  169  162  120  938 \n% of Eligible Patients Seen  55%  49%  47%  44%  35%  32%  43% \n \nPDP improved patient attendance at off-site appointments from 56 percent attendance in 2022 to \n62 percent attendance in the first half of 2023.  Over the last six months of 2023, total patient \nattendance decreased to 43 percent from 62 percent attendance in the first six months of 2023.25  \nThe number of scheduled appointments in the last six months of 2023 increased by an average of \nalmost 20 appointments per month, although the percentage of patients who made it to their \nappointments reduced from 55 percent to 32 percent in the same period.  When patients no-show \nfor appointments, the next available appointments are often months later, further increasing the \nbacklog.  Extended delays occur not only for patients who require routine or preventive specialty \ncare, but also for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions.     \n \nSince monitoring began in 2022, PDP has made efforts to reduce its off-site specialty backlog.  \nEfforts have included adjusting appointment times for greater uniformity in scheduling, batching \npatients together to reduce the numbers of patient transports, and seeking providers who can \noffer evening appointments.  None of these efforts were successful.  PDP data reflects security \nstaff shortages remain the largest factor in missed appointments.  In the first half of 2023, \ncorrectional officer shortages explained a monthly average of 58 missed appointments.26  In the \nlast six months of 2023, correctional officer shortages accounted for a monthly average of 151 \nmissed appointments, or a 160 percent increase.   \n \nPDP has thus far reported limited success in attracting more specialty care physicians to offer \nservices at PDP.  Although PDP currently pays commercial rates for healthcare services, it \nshould evaluate pay scales for both on-site and off-site specialty services and increase incentives \n \n25 Id. at 31.  \n26 Ibid.  \n  35 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 37 of 69\nfor providers to offer more specialty care on-site rather than transporting patients to off-site \nfacilities.  Some incentives may include:  (1) offering outside providers reimbursement for travel \nto PDP facilities; (2) guaranteed pay for all scheduled appointments, whether patients attend or \nnot; and (3) reimbursing off-site specialty care providers at higher rates to provide care on site \nrather than in their community offices.   \n \nAn effective off-site specialty care program requires a dedicated healthcare escort and \ntransportation unit.  As previously reported, Class Members have cited excessive wait times for \ntransportation as the most common reason for refusing to attend off-site medical appointments.27  \nBecause canceled appointments due to Class Member refusals and insufficient transportation \nstaff often occur on the day of scheduled appointments, some providers have voiced frustration, \nwhich could further reduce the number of providers willing to treat PDP patients.  PDP reports it \nhas made efforts to reduce wait times for transportation to medical appointments that contributed \nto high refusal rates.  In the first six months of 2023, an average of 48 patients per month refused \noff-site medical appointments.28  Patient refusals reduced to an average 35 patients per month in \nthe last six months of 2023, reflecting a 27 percent decrease.  A total of 286 patient refusals in \nthe first half of 2023 reduced to 211 patient refusals in the second half of the year.29  PDP’s \noverall physical healthcare backlog remains substantially higher than the required 238 total \nbacklogged appointments.30   \n \nIntake Screenings \n \nPDP remains unable to meet policy guidelines for completing patient intake screenings within \nfour hours of arrival at PDP.

See Monitor’s First Report, supra note 4, at 18.  \n  36 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 38 of 69\nanother area of poor interdisciplinary coordination.  Intake policy compliance is an \ninterdisciplinary process that the Access to Care Committee, or another interdisciplinary group \nof healthcare and security staff should address.  Once intake screenings are completed, within \nany timeframe, movement of Class Members from intake to housing units is also frequently \ndelayed due to staffing shortages.  Housing delays may be reduced with more focused attention \nbut will not likely be corrected without more staff.  \n      \nMortality Information  \n \nFourteen Class Member’s died while in PDP custody in 2023.  Two of the 14 deaths were ruled \nsuicides and one was ruled a homicide.  Two deaths were ruled accidental secondary to \nsubstance overdose and seven deaths were reportedly due to natural causes.  Two deaths are \npending causes from the medical examiner.   \n \nIn September 2022, PDP implemented a process for reviewing deaths that occur in PDP custody \nas recommended by the Monitoring Team.31  The Monitoring Team observed all reviews that \noccurred in this reporting period.  Circumstances of each death and emergency responses of \nhealthcare and security staff were evaluated during the reviews.  Reviews were interdisciplinary \nand attended by PDP’s executive management team, security and healthcare managers, and other \npersonnel who interacted with or treated the Class Members who died.  Discussions were \ntransparent and identified areas for corrective action.  PDP reports that it intends to formalize \nreviews in PDP policy.  The Monitoring Team has recommended that PDP also develop a \nprocess for ensuring that all corrective action is implemented and tracked, including any \ndisciplinary action taken against individual personnel.     \n \nBehavioral Healthcare \n \nPDP remains out of compliance with required timeframes for behavioral health referrals.32  In \nthis reporting period, the behavioral health appointments backlog increased and now comprises \n18 percent of the entire on-site non-specialist appointment backlog.  Average appointment \nbacklog totals for initial psychiatric and medication evaluations for weeks reviewed increased by \n105 percent and 74 percent respectively.  The following tables depict PDP’s compliance with \npolicy timeframes for behavioral health referrals, social worker sick calls, and 14-day patient \nevaluations for the last six months of 2023:     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n31 See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 28-29.  \n32 PDP behavioral healthcare policy prescribes the following timeframes for responding to behavioral health patient \nreferrals:  emergency referrals, within four hours; urgent referrals, within 24-hours; and routine referrals, within five \ndays. \n  37 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 39 of 69\nPercent Compliance with Behavioral Health Referral Timeframes  \nJuly – December 2023 \n \nTotal Referrals   Emergency   Emergency  Urgent   Urgent  Routine \nTotal  Completed  Referrals  Referrals  Referrals  Referrals  Referrals \nMonth  Completed  within  Completed  Completed  Completed  Completed  Completed \nReferrals  Timeframes  within 4  within 24  within 24  within 48  within 5 \n(%)  hours (%)  hours (%)  hours (%)  hours (%)  days (%) \nJuly  529  56%  70%  91%  22%  34%  46% \nAugust  609  59%  78%  100%  24%  34%  55% \nSeptember  584  57%  73%  100%  22%  35%  44% \nOctober  686  53%  62%  100%  20%  31%  60% \nNovember  675  55%  64%  100%  25%  42%  54% \nDecember  622  58%  71%  100%  23%  36%  49% \n*Expectation: emergent within 4 hours, urgent within 24 hours, routine within 5 days.  \n \nSocial Worker Sick Calls \nJuly – December 2023 \n \nMonth  Number Completed  Completed within 24 hours (%) \nJuly  457  69% \nAugust  452  72% \nSeptember  449  70% \nOctober  495  68% \nNovember  531  66% \nDecember  467  58% \n \nCompliance with 14-Day Patient Evaluations  \nJuly – December 2023 \n \nMonth  Number Completed  Completed within 14 Days (%) \nJuly  677  86% \nAugust  849  93% \nSeptember  790  96% \nOctober  732  96% \nNovember  655  91% \nDecember  592  91% \n \nDespite salary increases averaging 13 percent for behavioral health personnel, there has been no \nsignificant increase in behavioral health staffing in this reporting period and little change in \nPDP’s ability to comply with required referral timeframes since the previous reporting period.  \nLike physical healthcare providers, clinicians have begun providing some services on or near \n  38 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 40 of 69\nhousing units to reduce the need for custody escorts.  PDP cites lack of behavioral health staff, \ndelayed institutional counts, and lack of patient movement and security escorts among primary \nbarriers to more timely responses.   \n \nIn this reporting period, behavioral health staff referrals were completed within required \ntimeframes less than 60 percent of the time.  Compliance with four-hour emergency referral \ntimeframes ranged from 62 percent to 78 percent in the second half of 2023, reduced from the 76 \npercent to 88 percent range in the previous reporting period.33  Patients who receive emergency \nreferrals are observed one-on-one by security personnel until they are seen by clinicians.  One-\non-one observation is necessary for patient safety but further strains security staff resources.   \n \nUrgent and routine referrals improved slightly but not significantly in this reporting period, \ntypically occurring within required timeframes less than 25 percent and 60 percent of the time \nrespectively.  Now that some services are being offered on housing units, PDP anticipates \nimprovements in the next reporting period.  Social work sick call requests are patient initiated \nand require face-to-face triaging of patients within 24 hours of receipt.  Data for this reporting \nperiod shows PDP met this goal an average of 67 percent of the time, similar to the 69 percent \ncompliance rate in the previous reporting period.34   \n \nAll Class Members entering PDP are referred for a 14-day evaluation by behavioral health staff.  \nPDP has increased compliance with required timeframes over the course of monitoring, reaching \nan average of 97 percent compliance in the previous reporting period.35  In this reporting period, \n14-day evaluations were completed an average of 92 percent of the time.   \n \nHealthcare Staffing \n  \nAs stated above, PDP healthcare staffing has improved since the previous reporting period.  \nCorrectional healthcare staff vacancy rates are analyzed based on the number of vacant and filled \npositions for a “staff vacancy” rate and a “functional vacancy” rate.  The functional vacancy rate \nincludes shifts that are filled by overtime and temporary agency hires and accounts for \npermanent staff who are out on leave and not reporting for duty.  As previously reported, PDP \nand its healthcare contractor, YesCare, reviewed salaries and compensation packages and offered \nan average 13 percent pay increases for most healthcare positions.36  Increases took effect in \nmid-2023 and improved healthcare staffing as a result.   \n \nPDP’s healthcare staff vacancy rates from August 2022 through May 2023 were approximately \n33 percent.  In this reporting period, PDP reduced the healthcare staff vacancy rate by more than \nhalf to 16 percent.  The functional vacancy rate has also reduced slightly from six percent in the \nprevious reporting period to five percent in this reporting period.  The following tables depict \nhealthcare new hires and separations for each classification in this reporting period, July through \nDecember 2023, and total healthcare vacancies for May and December 2023: \n \n \n33 See Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 33.  \n34 Id. at 34.  \n35 Ibid. \n36 Id. at 36.  \n  39 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 41 of 69\nHealthcare Personnel New Hires and Separations by Job Classification \n July – December 2023 \n  \nJob Classification  New Hires   Separations  Net (+/-) \nAdministration  2  0  +2 \nAdministrative Assistant  1  1  0 \nBehavioral Health Nurse Practitioner  1  1  0 \nBehavioral Health Aide  1  0  +1 \nCertified Nursing Assistant  2.4  .4  +2 \nLicensed Practical Nurse  18.2  2.2  +16 \nMedical Assistant  6.0  1.4  +4.6 \nMedical Records Clerk  4.8  0  +4.8 \nNurse Practitioner  1  1  0 \nPhysician  0  1  -1 \nRadiology Technician  1  0  +1 \nRe-Entry Coordinator  0  1  -1 \nRegistered Nurse  12.6  3.2  +9.4 \nScheduler  1  0  +1 \nSocial Worker  2  0  +2 \nTotal   54  12.2  41.8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  40 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 42 of 69\n                                                 Healthcare Vacancy Report \n                                                     May and December 2023 \n \nUnfilled  Vacancy  Unfilled  Vacancy \nFunctional \nAllocated  Positions  Rate  Positions  Rate \nPosition Category  Vacancy \nPositions  May  May  December  December \nRate \n2023  2023  2023  2023 \nAdministration  49.0  1.0  2%  0.0  0%  6% \nBehavioral Health Aide  8.4  1.8  21%  0.0  0%  -18%* \nBehavioral Health Clinicians: \n24.0  16.6  69%  10.0  42%  45% \nSocial Worker/Psychologist \nBehavioral Health Prescribers: \n15.4  6.5  42%  5.4  35%  36% \nPsychiatrist, NP \nBehavioral Health Professionals: \n15.0  0.0  0%  1.0  7%  29% \nBH Coun./Activity Th. \nCertified Nursing Assistant  2.8  2.4  86%  0.4  14%  23% \nDialysis RN and Dialysis \n1.6  0.8  50%  0.0  0%  7% \nTechnician \nInfectious Disease Physician  2.0  0.0  0%  0.0  0%  34% \nLicense Practical Nurse: All LPNs  68.2  27.2  40%  12.2  18%  -18% \nMedical Assistant  17.0  8.8  52%  1.0  6%  1% \nMedical Records Clerk  14.8  4.8  32%  0.4  3%  -3% \nOB/GYN Physician  0.8  0.0  0%  0.0  0%  54% \nPhysical Health Clinicians: \n18.0  1.6  9%  3.6  20%  28% \nPhysician, NP, PA \nPhysical Therapist/Therapist \n3.0  0.0  0%  0.0  0.0%  32% \nAssistant \nTelehealth Coordinators  3.0  2.0  67%  1.0  33%  75% \nRadiology Technician  2.4  1.4  58%  0.4  17%  26% \nRegistered Nurse: All RNs  68.8  28.1  41%  15.0  22%  -7% \nTotal  314.2  103.00  33%  50.40  16%  5% \n*For this total, a negative functional vacancy rate reflects over-staffing in one classification in efforts to reduce the impact of vacancies \nin others. \n \nPDP improved its staffing from a net gain of 11.4 full-time positions to 41.8 positions for a 267 \npercent increase since the previous reporting period.  The influx of new staff should continue to \nreduce backlogs in the next reporting period.  Unfortunately, salary increases have not yet \nimproved hiring across behavioral health classifications.  PDP should consider whether raises \napplied to behavioral health classifications are enough to attract candidates and make appropriate \nadjustments.  Functional vacancy rates for clinicians increased from 40 percent in the previous \nreporting period to 45 percent in this reporting period and decreased only slightly for prescribers \nfrom 37 percent to 36 percent.   \n  \n  41 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 43 of 69\nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 5—Healthcare, from the Monitor’s \nFirst Report: \n \n1.  Defendants should engage an independent salary survey to assist PDP in identifying \nsalaries and benefits that are sufficiently competitive to attract and retain full-time \nhealthcare staff. \nPDP has instituted 13 percent raises on average for almost all healthcare \nclassifications, which has improved recruitment and retention in several \nclassifications.  A more focused recruitment strategy, which may include additional \ncompensation increases, is necessary to reduce vacancies among behavioral health \nclassifications.  \n2.  Continue to explore options to provide both on and off-site appointment services via \ntelehealth. \nPDP reports that YesCare remains unsuccessful in identifying providers who are \nwilling to provide telehealth, with the exception of limited cardiology services.  In \nresponse, Subject Matter Expert (SME), Dr. Belavich, has recommended \nimprovements to YesCare’s current engagement strategy, including salary \nincentives described above, that YesCare should implement to increase the \nlikelihood of success.   \n3.  Create an internal interdisciplinary workgroup to evaluate reasons for missed off-site \nappointments and develop procedures to increase efficiency in arranging and ensuring \nscheduled appointments occur. \nThe Access to Care Committee continues to meet, but some issues, such as timely \nintake assessments, have reportedly not been addressed in weekly meetings.  Some \nproblems will not be resolved without additional security or healthcare staff.  The \ncommittee should, however, analyze new or more complex problems as they arise to \nensure:  (1) current operations are as efficient as possible with existing resources, \nand (2) plans are in place to improve operations as resources increase.   \n \nAdditional recommendations for immediate action:   \n \n4.  PDP should evaluate reimbursement rates for both on-site and off-site specialty services \nand make increases sufficient to attract necessary providers.   \n5.  PDP should increase incentives for providers to offer specialty care on-site rather than \ntransporting patients to off-site facilities.  Some incentives may include:  (1) offering \noutside providers reimbursement for travel time to PDP facilities; (2) guaranteed \nreimbursement for all scheduled appointments, whether patients attend or not; and (3) \nreimbursement of off-site specialty care providers at higher rates to provide care on site.   \n6.  The City should explore contracting with outside law enforcement or private security \nagencies to establish a team dedicated to off-site transport details.   \n \nSubstantive Provision 6—Behavioral Health in Segregation \n \nBy September 30, 2022, the PDP and Corizon shall re-establish a mental health program for \npersons who are in segregation status.  \n \n  42 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 44 of 69\n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nTo achieve substantial compliance with this substantive provision, PDP must, at a minimum:  (1) \nresume the provision of daily medical/physical health rounds for each Class Member patient \nplaced on punitive or administrative segregation status; (2) ensure that behavioral health \nclearances are completed consistent with PDP policy for each Class Member patient placed on \nsegregation status; (3) resume the provision of weekly behavioral health rounds for each Class \nMember patient on segregation status who is navigating serious mental illness (SMI); (4) resume \nthe provision of group services for no fewer than 10 hours per week for each Class Member \npatient on segregation status; (5) establish a reliable mechanism to identify all Class Member \npatients on segregation status who are not housed in identified segregation units; (6) safely \ndiscontinue the use of segregation for Class Member patients due to lack of sufficient Transition \nUnit (TU) housing; and (7) significantly reduce the use of segregation for Class Member patients \nwho require placement on the Behavioral Health caseload.     \n \nRequirements 1 and 3:  Resume the provision of daily medical/physical health rounds for each \nClass Member patient placed on punitive or administrative segregation status and resume the \nprovision of weekly behavioral health rounds for each Class Member patient on segregation \nstatus who is navigating SMI. \n \nAs previously reported, PDP completes audits of physical and behavioral healthcare rounds with \npatients in segregation.37  Due to ongoing discrepancies in PDP’s healthcare and security \nsegregation data, also discussed below under Requirement 2, Requirement 5, and Substantive \nProvision 8—Discipline, audit findings are useful for comparison purposes but not for \ncompliance determinations.   \n \nThe most recent data from an October 2023 audit shows 94 percent of required daily physical \nhealth rounds occurred and every facility achieved at least 90 percent compliance.  This marks a \nsignificant improvement from the March 2023 audit results reflecting 22 percent compliance \nwith required physical health rounds.  PDP attributes improvements to enhanced training and \ninternal compliance monitoring.   \n \nAs with other behavioral health markers reported above, compliance with behavioral health daily \nrounding has decreased from 96 percent compliance in March 2023 to 85 percent compliance in \nOctober 2023.38  Both March and October compliance rates mark improvement from the 75 \npercent compliance rate reported in September 2022.   \n \nAn essential part of rounding is identifying patients who show signs of decline or poor coping in \nsegregation housing and making timely referrals for additional services or recommend removal \nfrom segregation.  Behavioral healthcare staff who complete rounds in segregation housing \nreport that they may request evaluations from higher level clinicians as needed but PDP does not \ncurrently track referrals for further assessment or recommendations for removal.  The \nMonitoring Team has recommended that PDP begin to track this information both for quality \nimprovement and to establish compliance with this requirement.   \n \n37 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 39.  \n38 Id. at 38.  \n  43 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 45 of 69\n \nRequirement 2:  Ensure that behavioral health clearances are completed consistent with PDP \npolicy for each Class Member patient placed on segregation status. \n \nHealthcare clearances are required for all Class Members being considered for placement on \nsegregation status. This requires a face-to-face evaluation by a physical healthcare provider and \nfor those in Behavioral Health programs, a behavioral health clinician.  Patients designated SMI \nare required to have a behavioral health clearance performed within four hours of placement in \nsegregation.  Patients who are on the Behavioral Health caseload but not identified as SMI are to \nreceive a behavioral health clearance within 24-hours of placement.  \n \nA review of 24 physical and behavioral healthcare clearance forms (PDP 86-733) from \nSeptember and October 2023 suggest that physical health sections of the clearances are still \nbeing completed consistently, as previously reported.39  Issues with behavioral health clearances \nidentified in the previous reporting period were also present in the sample reviewed in this \nreporting period.  In multiple instances, patients on the Behavioral Health caseload, some of \nwhom were also SMI, were not designated as such and therefore did not receive clearance \nevaluations.  In some instances, SMI patients were mis-identified as being on the Behavioral \nHealth caseload only.  These patients would have received behavioral health clearances based on \nthe 24-hour policy timeframe rather than the 4-hour timeframe required for SMI patients.   \n \nPDP developed a pilot project to improve the quality of mental health clinical input in \ndisciplinary hearings and dispositions, accurate identification of the SMI populations, and \nensuring staff assistant support is provided and documented.  The pilot is scheduled for \nimplementation at PICC in the next reporting period.  As previously reported, the Monitoring \nTeam determined that the threshold for diverting patients from segregation is too high and some \npatients are unsafe in the isolated environment.  Currently, the only available alternative to \nsegregation is inpatient hospitalization, and many patients do not meet inpatient criteria.  The \nPICC pilot includes the option of diversion from segregation to TUs, which is the more \nappropriate level of care for many patients.         \n \nRequirement 4:  Resume the provision of group services for no fewer than 10 hours per week for \neach Class Member patient on segregation status. \n \nAs previously reported, PDP developed “Positive Change/Positive Outcomes” (PC/PO), a \nbehavioral health group treatment program for patients in segregation.40  The program is \ndesigned to deliver group treatment for two hours, five days per week, for a total of 10 possible \ntreatment hours each week for every program participant.  PDP has begun tracking PC/PO \ntreatment hours based on healthcare staff projections, which is now part of PDP’s monthly \nperformance indicator report.  The following table reflects total PC/PO group treatment hours \npossible with current Healthcare staffing versus hours offered to segregated patients from July \nthrough December 2023:   \n \n \n39 Ibid.  \n40 Id. at 40.  \n  44 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 46 of 69\nPC/PO Structured Group Treatment Hours in Segregation \nJuly – December 2023 \n \nTreatment Hours  Treatment Hours \nMonth  Percent (%) \nPossible  Offered \nJuly  210  78  37% \nAugust  260  114  44% \nSeptember  234  56  24% \nOctober  240  60  25% \nNovember  472*  68  14% \nDecember  462  54  11% \n*Through October, Treatment Hours Possible were measured based on both security and healthcare staffing \nprojections.  Beginning in November, Possible Hours reflect healthcare staffing projections only, which is a more \naccurate measure. \n     \nIn the previous reporting period, preliminary data suggested that only 19 percent of available \nPC/PO group hours were being offered.  Newer data suggests more group hours were offered \nmost months in this reporting period, but far fewer than are possible with available healthcare \npersonnel.  PDP does not currently have a way to track the number of patients who are eligible \nfor and participate in PC/PO groups but reports it is in the process of refining its eligibility \ncriteria.  \n \nRequirement 5:  Establish a reliable mechanism to identify all Class Member patients on \nsegregation status who are not housed in identified segregation units. \n \nPreviously reported discrepancies in security and healthcare tracking of total patients cleared for \nsegregation versus total patients placed in segregation persisted in this reporting period.41  PDP \npreviously reported it was completing audits to ensure no Class Members were on segregation \nstatus outside of designated segregation areas and all patients in segregation were receiving \nrequired healthcare rounds.  Audits reportedly identified the sources of some discrepancies, such \nas insufficient tracking and communication when housing units are converted to or from \nsegregation units based on population fluctuations.  \n \nDespite assurances that PDP had resolved discrepancies, segregation data from December 2023 \nrevealed the same previously reported inconsistencies.  The Monitoring Team has met with PDP \nabout this issue multiple times since 2022.  The problem is convoluted but not intractable and \nshould have been resolved sooner.  PDP’s failure to identify the specific sources of data \ndiscrepancies reflects poor interdisciplinary communication.   \n \nIn recent months, the Monitoring Team directly facilitated discussions between security and \nhealthcare managers.  Additional solutions were identified, and January 2024 data now appears \nconsistently collected across disciplines.  Until PDP implements a new automated Jail \nManagement System (JMS), PDP’s segregation and other data must be tracked and reconciled \nmanually.  Given PDP’s staffing crisis, data accuracy is not a top priority.  The number of \n \n41 Id. at 39; Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 34.  \n  45 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 47 of 69\npatients impacted by poor segregation tracking is likely small; however, potential consequences \nfor those who do not receive required behavioral health clearances and clinical contacts are great.   \n \nRequirement 6:  Safely discontinue the use of segregation for Class Member patients due to lack \nof sufficient Transition Unit housing.  \n \nDr. Belavich maintains that PDP should reduce its dependence on segregation for all Class \nMembers, especially those on the Behavioral Health caseload, and discontinue its use altogether \nfor SMI patients unless no alternatives exist.42  PDP’s TU housing provides an alternative to \nsegregation housing in a more therapeutic setting for the mentally ill.  Pre-COVID-19, PDP \nreserved 128 TU beds for women and 200 for men.  During the COVID-19 lockdown, PDP \nreduced its available TU beds and, by August 2022, 134 beds remained including 22 for women \nand 112 for men. \n \nThe women’s TU currently has 19 patients enrolled in a 34-patient program.  The women’s TU \nis housed in PICC D-unit, which has a 128-bed capacity.  As previously reported, women with \nvarious security classifications are also housed in the unit, which limits out-of-cell and \ntherapeutic programming time.43  PDP acknowledges that current TU space is inappropriate for \nthis program and has committed to activating a 100-bed women’s TU.  The City initially \ncommitted to expansion by March 2024, however, that has not occurred.       \n \nIn February 2023, PDP moved the men’s TU to a larger, 128-bed unit at RCF.  As of June 2023, \napproximately 50 patients resided in the TU.  PDP reported it was having difficulty identifying \neligible patients to fill the program and, in October 2023, moved the program to a smaller 64-bed \nunit.  Dr. Belavich generally supports the idea of smaller units as more effective therapeutically.  \nHowever, as of January 2024, only 51 patients resided in the 64-bed TU.  PDP’s population \nconsists of approximately 1,600 patients on the Behavioral Health caseload, 340 of whom \nexperience SMI.  PDP has not finalized a sound interdisciplinary process for patient referrals to \nthe TU or appropriate eligibility criteria.  PDP recognizes it is implausible that only 51 of 1,600 \npatients can benefit from the program and is working with Dr. Belavich on formalized, less \nrestrictive eligibility criteria and an effective referral process.   \n \nThe small TU patient population has consistently reported to the Monitoring Team during site \nvisits in February 2023, November 2023, and January 2024 that they are benefitting from \ntreatment offered and enjoy several hours of out-of-cell time daily.  PDP confirms its goal is to \nimprove care for the mentally ill by diverting as many patients as possible from segregation to \nTUs and offering at least 10 hours of PC/PO group treatment for patients in segregation.  There \nis, however, no definitive plan in the near term to expand TUs or increase PC/PO group hours.   \n \nRequirement 7:  Significantly reduce the use of segregation for Class Member patients who \nrequire placement on the behavioral health caseload. \n \nBehavioral Health patients have been consistently overrepresented in segregation over three \nreporting periods. Segregation data from select dates in December 2022, June 2023, and January \n \n42 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 40.  \n43 Id. at 40; Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 37.  \n  46 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 48 of 69\n2024, shows that patients on the Behavioral Health caseload totaled between 35 and 37 percent \nof PDP’s overall population yet represented 44 percent of the segregation population in 2022, 38 \npercent in June 2023, and 40 percent in January of 2024.44   \n \nSMI patients have reduced from 12 percent of PDP’s total population in 2022 to 10 percent in \nJune 2023 to 8 percent in January 2024.  SMI patients are not overrepresented in segregation and \nPDP has successfully reduced their percentages of the total segregation population in each \nreporting period from 12 percent in 2022 to 8 percent in June 2023 to 5 percent in January 2024.  \nThis data is reflected in the following table, which depicts SMI and Behavioral Health patients in \nsegregation housing on specific dates in December 2022, June 2023, and January 2024.45 \n \nSMI and Behavioral Health Class Members in Segregation \nDecember 30, 2022, June 9, 2023, and January 12, 2024 \n \n  December 30, 2022  June 9, 2023  January 12, 2024 \nPercent of  Percent of  Percent of \nCount  PDP  Count  PDP  Count  PDP \nPopulation  Population  Population \nPDP Census  4401  100%  4565  100%  4455  100% \nNumber of SMI  516  12%  439  10%  342  8% \nNumber on BH \n1546  35%  1653  36%  1633  37% \nCaseload \nNumber in \n311  7%  268  6%  280  6% \nSegregation \n  Percent of  Percent of  Percent of \n  Segregation    Segregation    Segregation \nPopulation  Population  Population \nNumber of SMI in \n36  12%  21  8%  15  5% \nSegregation \nNumber of BH in \n138  44%  102  38%  113  40% \nSegregation \n \nPDP continues to report that it has not finalized a system to track when patients are diverted from \nsegregation to PHSW or a TU.  Once PDP develops and implements recommended policies to \ndivert those on the Behavioral Health caseload or with SMI to TUs, the number of mentally ill in \nsegregation should reduce.     \n     \nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 6—Behavioral Health in Segregation, \nfrom the Monitor’s Second Report:   \n \n1.  PDP should reexamine its behavioral health policies and practices for segregation clearances \nand rounding, with particular focus on thresholds for diversion or removal from segregation \nbased on patient acuity. \n \n44 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 37; Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 41.  \n45 As discussed above under Requirement 5, PDP’s December 2023 data contained inconsistencies.  Dr. Belavich \nwas able to verify PDP had reconciled the data by January 12, 2024 and, therefore, selected that date for analysis.   \n  47 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 49 of 69\nPDP reports it is piloting a new procedure at PICC in the next reporting period, which \nwill improve practices for segregation clearances.   \n2.  PDP should make additional progress in identifying custody personnel to staff Positive \nChange, Positive Outcome treatment groups and fill Transition Units with only Transition \nUnit patients or others who can safely program in common spaces with them. \n  PDP reports it is unable to implement this recommendation without additional security \n  staff.   \n \nSubstantive Provision 7—Law Library Access \n \nPDP will continue to provide law library access for all incarcerated individuals. The Monitor \nand the parties will discuss access and scheduling matters and the Monitor shall make any \nrecommendations on these matters by August 1, 2022. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP remains unable to provide consistent law library access.  PDP has attempted to implement \nan equitable rotation schedule but evaluating compliance with the schedule was not possible in \nthis reporting period because documentation is incomplete.   \n \nAs recommended, PDP maintains a law library schedule for all non-segregation housing units \nthat provides for access at varying times each week.  Also as recommended, PDP instituted a \nsign-up process that tracks who requests access, whether Class Members attend, and durations \nof time spent in the law library.  The schedule and roster were intended to serve as interim \ncompliance tools for PDP executives and the Monitoring Team until a computerized system \ncan be implemented.   \n \nToo many sign-up sheets are missing from documentation provided for randomly sampled \nweeks from July through December 2023 to measure compliance.46  In the previous reporting \nperiod, an estimated 32 percent of scheduled law library timeslots were filled.47  Limited \ndocumentation for sampled weeks suggests that system-wide compliance reduced in this \nreporting period, but this cannot be verified without more complete documentation.  In this \nreporting period, PICC’s documentation was more complete than other facilities and it, \ntherefore, appears to have achieved greater compliance, but this also cannot be verified.   \n \nLaw library access in segregation units remains highly restricted largely because Class \nMembers frequently spend entire days inside their cells.  PDP’s goals of ensuring law library \naccess and effectively tracking access will not likely be met without more staff.   \n \nIn November 2023, PDP assigned a sergeant to conduct monthly audits of law library access.  \nAudits track whether law libraries are open as scheduled, schedules are posted on housing \n \n46 The weeks reviewed were as follows:  July 17-23, 2023; August 14-20, 2023; September 18-24, 2023; October \n16-22, 2023; November 13-19, 2023; and December 11-17, 2023. \n47 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 43.  \n  48 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 50 of 69\nunits, and sign-up sheets are being used.48  Law library documentation appears to have \nimproved in November and December as a result of internal monitoring.  However, it is \nunlikely that PDP supervisors will be able to monitor and ensure consistent documentation of \nlaw library access in the next reporting period.   \n \nBased on out-of-cell data, Class Member complaints, and reports from housing unit personnel \nand supervisors, PDP is far from substantial compliance with this provision.  Class Member \ngrievances submitted via tablets in this reporting period frequently cite insufficient staff as \nrationales provided for law library closures.   \n \nPDP tracks maintenance of law library printers and computers via monthly audits.  Audits in \nthis reporting period reflect no issues for dates sampled as depicted in the following table: \n \nPDP Internal Law Library Equipment Audit \nJuly – December 2023  \n   \nTotal Issues  Housing Unit  Repairs \nMonth  Equipment  CFCF  DC  PICC  RCF \nDocumented  Audit Dates  Completed \nJul  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  7/18/23, \nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  7/31/23, 8/1/23 \nAug  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  8/8/23, 8/16/23, \nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  8/22/23 \nSept  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  9/26/23-\nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  9/27/23 \nOct  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  10/23/23-\nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  10/31/23 \nNov  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  11/16/23-\nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  11/28/23 \nDec  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  12/15/23-\nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  12/21/23 \n   \n   Total  0  0  0  0  0 \n                 \nNumerous tablet grievances filed in December 2023 reported a broken printer at PICC.

PDP remains in compliance \nwith this aspect of the sub-provision. \n \nIn the second reporting period, the Monitoring Team recommended that PDP revise its \ndisciplinary policies, hearing documentation, and training materials to comply with due process \nand Agreement requirements.51  The 24 completed disciplinary cases reviewed in this reporting \nperiod revealed no meaningful improvements from the previous reporting period.  Challenges \nidentified previously continued through this reporting period.  Some examples include failure to \ndocument when interpreters are provided for non-English speaking Class Members and staff \nassistants for Class Members with disabilities, inconsistent documentation of the behavioral \nhealth and SMI population, and inadequate input from the clinical personnel regarding \nbehavioral health Class Members.   \n   \nDisciplinary actions reviewed in this reporting period showed little improvement in the quality of \nmental health assessments in the disciplinary process or the accuracy by which Class Members \nwere designated SMI.52  As previously reported, Behavioral Health staff are required to complete \nan assessment form (PDP 86-733) prior to placement of each Class Member into a segregated \nsetting.53  The form contains a section for treating clinicians to note any behavioral health \ncontraindication to placement in segregation and to document whether a Class Member is able to \nparticipate in the hearing process and present a defense.  It also denotes whether a Class \nMember’s mental illness should be considered a mitigating factor in any discipline imposed.  \n \n \n51 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 39-40.  \n52 PDP reported that deficiencies noted in the September/October samples were not corrected by December 31, \n2024, so the review was not replicated later in the reporting period.         \n53 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 46.  Also discussed in the Substantive Provision 6—Behavioral Health in \nSegregation section of this report, infra at 41. \n \n  51 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 53 of 69\nHowever, in addition to frequent misidentification of patients’ mental health status, hearing \nofficers have not begun to document consideration of notes from the mental health assessment \nform (PDP 86-733) in their findings.   \n \nCorrectly identifying Class Members with SMI or on the Behavioral Health caseload and \nconsideration of those factors in disciplinary hearings is critical to ensuring Class Members’ \nrights are protected.  PDP’s pilot project discussed above under Substantive Provision 6—\nBehavioral Health in Segregation, Requirement 2, will begin to address these issues and some of \nthe Monitoring Team’s other recommendations.   \n \nSub-provision 8.2--The PDP shall expunge the disciplinary records for all persons who were not \npresent at their disciplinary hearings for the period March 2020 to the current date [April 12, \n2022]. . .  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \ndiscontinued)  \n \nSub-provision 8.3--[PDP shall] release from segregation all incarcerated persons who were not \npresent at their disciplinary hearings but who are [on April 12, 2022] still serving a disciplinary \nsentence, or who are in administrative segregation following a disciplinary sentence imposed \nwithout a hearing. . . \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (October 12, 2023, monitoring \ndiscontinued) \n \nSub-provision 8.4--[PDP shall] cancel sanctions [imposed in hearing held between March 2020 \nand April 12, 2022] that require payments for damage to property or other restitution, and/or \nreturn payments made by persons who were required to pay for damage to property or other \nharms.  Provided, however, the PDP may seek to conduct due process hearings for individuals \ncovered by this provision who are still in segregation, but only: (a) if there is a small and \ndiscrete number of such cases, and (b) upon first providing counsel for Plaintiffs the names of \nthose persons, the disciplinary charges, and information related to the length of placement in \nsegregation.  Nothing in this section prohibits persons subject to the disciplinary process set \nforth above from asserting individual legal challenges to the discipline.  Defendants shall \nprovide to counsel for plaintiffs a list of individuals and disciplinary matters subject to this \nexception by April 15, 2022. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \ndiscontinued)  \n \nSubstantive Provision 9—Tablets \n \nSub-provision 9.1--PDP has undertaken expansion efforts to increase the number of tablets \navailable within the PDP facilities by adding eighty (80) additional tablets, according to \noperational capabilities and housing designs. The expansion of tablets is as follows: from four \n(4) to six (6) tablets on each housing unit at CFCF for a total of fifty-six (56) additional tablets; \n  52 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 54 of 69\nand, at RCF, expanding from six (6) to eight (8) tablets on the [first floor] (4 housing units) and \nexpanding from eight (8) to twelve (12) tablets on the [2nd and 3rd floors] of RCF (4 larger \nunits) for a total of twenty-four (24) additional tablets at RCF. This expansion process will be \ncompleted by May 1, 2022.54  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP reports that it continues to maintain an inventory of tablets consistent with this sub-\nprovision. PDP’s total tablet inventory meets Agreement requirements but Class Member access \nto tablets does not.   \n \nPDP previously miscalculated, and the Monitor erroneously reported, that PDP maintained 421 \ntablets in populated housing units in June 2023.55  The reported 421 included tablets reserved for \nattorney visiting and other purposes that are not contemplated in this Agreement provision.  The \ncorrect number of tablets issued to housing units in June 2023 was 368.  PDP’s inventory for \nJanuary 2024 reflects 392 tablets were issued to housing units.  In the previous reporting period, \nPDP reserved an additional 187 tablets for educational programming.  That number reduced to \n113 in this reporting period.  PDP reports that it redirected 74 underutilized tablets to housing \nunits to replace broken or missing tablets.  The following table reflects current tablet totals at \neach PDP facility based on documentation provided:  \n \nTablet Availability at Each PDP Facility \nJune 2023 and January 2024 \n  \nTotal \nTotal \nFacility/Housing  Tablets \nTablets  Difference \nUnit  January   \nJune 2023 \n2024 \n \n \nASD Total*  12  0  -12 \n \nMOD 3 Total  12  12  0 \n \nCFCF Total  159  188  +29 \n \nDC Total  51  52  +1 \n \nPICC Total  50  61  +11 \n \nRCF Total  84  79  -5 \n \nTotal  368  392  +24 \n            *ASD was closed and the 12 remaining tablets were reportedly redistributed.   \n \n54 The Agreement, as written, requires the expansion of tablets at RCF “from six (6) to eight (8) tablets on the 2nd \nand 3rd floor (4 housing units) and expanding from eight (8) to twelve (12) tablets on the 1st floor of RCF (4 larger \nunits) . . .”.   In fact, RCF’s larger units are located on the 2nd and 3rd floors and the smaller units are located on the \n1st floor, suggesting that the numbers of tablets required were inadvertently reversed.  To correct this small oversight \nin the Agreement’s drafting, PDP must instead increase tablets from eight to twelve on the second and third floor \nhousing units and from six to eight on the first-floor housing units in order to achieve substantial compliance with \nthis aspect of the substantive provision.   \n55 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 49.  Previously, PDP likewise erroneously reported that there were 427 \ntablets in populated housing units in December 2022.  See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 44.  \n  53 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 55 of 69\n \nDuring the November 2023 site visit, the Monitoring Team frequently observed units with empty \ndocking stations, and staff and Class Members continue to report that tablets are frequently \nbroken, not charged, or otherwise not issued for use.  There were seven grievances filed via the \ntablet grievance system in this reporting period alleging limited tablet access.   \n \nIn this reporting period, PDP provided additional staff training, reiterated expectations, updated \npost orders regarding tablet access, and, in November 2023, dispatched a team to complete \ninternal tablet audits.  Initial audit results cannot be verified due to poor or inconsistent audit \nmethods, but findings generally confirm that some tablets listed on PDP inventories were not \navailable for use in housing units on audit days.   \n \nAs previously reported, PDP has committed to the use of tablets for Class Members to initiate \nsick call requests.56  PDP reports it has procured 170 tablets for this purpose, but patient \nconfidentiality issues are creating unanticipated delays to its initial December 2023 pilot date.    \n   \nDespite PDP’s best efforts, it is unlikely to achieve substantial compliance with this substantive \nprovision without more staff to monitor functionality of and access to tablets.   \n \nSub-provision 9.2--The parties and the Monitor will discuss any future increases in the number \nof tablets based on all relevant factors, including operational feasibility and physical capacity. \nFurther, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies and practices are \nnecessary to address equitable and fair individual access to available tablets, and if so, the PDP \nshall implement agreed upon practices. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP continues to report that it plans to provide tablets to all eligible Class Members as part of its \nnext telephone contract procurement.  This is positive, but due to the City’s complex \nprocurement process and necessary physical plant infrastructure changes, it is not likely tablets \nwill be issued to Class Members until at least mid-2025. \n \nPDP’s pilot initiative to allow for the filing of grievances on tablets was expanded to all PDP \nfacilities by September 2023.  An average of 801 grievances were filed by Class Members via \ntablet each month from September to December, the majority of which relate to commissary and \nfood items purchased through a third-party vendor.  Smaller numbers of grievances were filed \nregarding access to medical and mental healthcare, allegations against staff, and out-of-cell time.  \nThe following table depicts total monthly and average grievances for the two largest categories \nof complaints and “others” submitted via tablet for the period September through December \n2023:   \n   \n \n \n \n \n56 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 50; Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 46.  \n  54 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 56 of 69\nMonthly Tablet Grievances \nSeptember – December 2023 \n \n \nMonth  September  October  November  December  Average \nCommissary  426  420  632  449  482 \nFood Vendor  63  100  124  185  118 \nOther  234  192  302  75  201 \nTotal  723  712  1058  709  801 \n \nAs anticipated, the challenge for PDP going forward will be providing timely and meaningful \nresponses to significant increases in requests and grievances.  PDP will need mechanisms for \ntriaging emergent grievances and requests, as well as managing administrative issues like \nduplicate requests.  PDP will also need to ensure Class Members are able to obtain evidence of \ntheir filed grievances, appeals, and any responses.  Finally, PDP should ensure all Class \nMembers have access to paper grievance forms at all times, and that they may choose the \nmethods by which grievances are submitted.  The Monitoring Team has recommended that PDP \nmanagement and executives regularly review grievance information to identify and address areas \nof non-compliance and will work with PDP in the next reporting period to improve data analysis \nof grievances filed both in paper form and via tablets.  Grievance analysis is another key area for \nthe new data analysis unit to explore when it is established.  Much can be learned from reviewing \ngrievances as trends emerge that warrant executive support to resolve. \nSubstantive Provision 10—Phone Calls \n \nSub-provision 10.1--PDP agrees to maintain 15 minutes of free phone calls on a daily basis for \nthe PDP population.  Further, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies and \npractices are necessary to address equitable and fair individual access to phones and, if so, the \nPDP shall implement agreed upon practices.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nWhen Class Members in general population units have access to dayrooms, PDP continues to \nprovide free 15-minute phone calls.  However, during site visits in this reporting period, Class \nMembers continued to report to the Monitoring Team that restricted phone access continues to \nexacerbate housing unit tension and, at times, causes fights.  As a result, phone time remains a \nform of dangerous jail currency, which ensures inequitable access.  PDP is unlikely to achieve \nsubstantial compliance with this substantive provision without additional staff.    \n   \nSub-provision 10.2--Upon a return to normal operations, the PDP will revert to the provision of \n10 minutes of free phone calls. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n \n  55 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 57 of 69\nAs reported above under Substantive Provision 4—Return to Normal Operations, PDP does not \nhave a plan for the return to normal operations and therefore remains in non-compliance with \nthis sub-provision.  \nSubstantive Provision 11—PICC Emergency Call Systems \n  \nThe Monitor and the parties shall discuss the issues unique to PICC regarding emergency call \nsystems and access to tablets and/or phones and determine whether any policies and practices \nare necessary to address these matters considering all relevant factors, including operational \nfeasibility and physical capacity. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nThe Monitoring Team continues to recommend against the expansion of a call button system at \nPICC and instead recommends significant improvements to security check protocols and \naccountability.   \n \nIn the previous reporting period, PDP attempted to use CCTV to assess the quality and timeliness \nof security checks at PICC, but outdated technology, excessive download times, and limited \nstaffing reportedly prevented a thorough review.57  In July 2022, the Monitoring Team \nrecommended that PDP install a unified CCTV system that will give supervisors, managers, and \nexecutives direct terminal access to real-time and historical CCTV footage.  In December 2023, \nthe City reported it is exploring procurement options and developing a project plan consistent \nwith this recommendation.  The City has not provided subsequent updates or project timelines, \nbut upgrades will not likely be introduced in 2024.   \n \nAs previously reported, physical plant limitations prevent PICC from installing additional phones \nand tablet docking stations.58  PDP’s plan to provide every eligible Class Member with a tablet \nwould be an appropriate alternative if implemented.  In December 2023, the City indicated its \ngoal is to issue tablets to Class Members in fiscal year 2025.  The Monitoring Team recommends \nthat PDP prioritize PICC for tablet issuance if it does not interfere with other aspects of the \nproject timeline.  \n \nRegarding the May 2023 escape from PICC, PDP reports that it received the final security \nassessment completed by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections in December 2023.  In \nJanuary 2024, the Monitoring Team toured PDP’s compound and observed several security \nupgrades pursuant to its findings.  The Monitoring Team has consistently requested the final \nreport for review.  To date, neither the report nor a summary of its findings or recommendations \nhave been provided.  The City’s failure to promptly produce requested documentation that \ndirectly intersects with Agreement provisions marks an unfortunate deviation from the \ntransparency Defendants demonstrated through most of the initial settlement term.           \n \n57 See Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 52.  \n58 See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 48.   \n  56 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 58 of 69\n \n \nSubstantive Provision 12—Locks \n \nSub-provision 12.1--PDP initiated the lock replacement program for PICC. . . which will be \ncompleted by June 30, 2022.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance  \n \nPDP initiated the lock replacement project at PICC and RCF in 2022.  In June 2023, PDP \nreported approximately 95 percent of the locks at PICC had been replaced.59  The remaining \nlocks needing replacement were in cells that required additional renovation.  Those cells were \ndecommissioned pending renovation and lock replacement.  PDP reports as of January 2024, all \nrequired locks were replaced.  PDP has completed additional training on requirements to conduct \nlock safety checks when officers assume their posts and to immediately notify a supervisor of \nany lock malfunctions.  Finally, PICC updated staff post orders to include direction on lock \ninspections, as well as the responsibility to deactivate cells and submit work orders for \ninoperable locks.  PDP has, therefore, achieved substantial compliance with this sub-provision, \nand the Monitoring Team will discontinue monitoring this aspect of the substantive provision.   \n   \nSub-provision 12.2--PDP initiated the lock replacement program for. . .RCF, which will be \ncompleted by June 30, 2022. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance \n \nAs previously reported, lock replacement and initial staff training at RCF were completed in \nMay 2022.60  PDP provided additional training on lock security and updated post orders in this \nreporting period.  PDP has, therefore, achieved substantial compliance with this sub-provision, \nand the Monitoring Team will discontinue monitoring this aspect of the substantive provision.   \n \nThough not subject to the Agreement, PDP reports all locks at CFCF have now also been \nreplaced.   \n \nSub-provision 12.3--For the repair of call button devices in existing facilities, PDP will conduct \na one-time test of all call buttons and make any necessary repairs by August 1, 2022. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \n \nSub-provision 12.4--Any future complaints related to the operation of call buttons shall be \naddressed through work orders, which will be addressed and completed by Defendants in a \ntimely manner.  \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \n59 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 52.  \n60 Monitor’s First Report, supra note 4, at 28-29. \n  57 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 59 of 69\n \nPDP provided copies of 37 call-button work orders completed at CFCF and RCF from July \nthrough December 2023.  Twenty-nine or 78 percent of repairs were documented as completed \nwithin one working day.  Remaining work orders were documented as completed within an \naverage of one week.  PDP’s efficient maintenance contractor also completed tamper-proof \nupgrades to call-button plates in the cells at CFCF in this reporting period.61  The Monitoring \nTeam will review work orders in the next reporting period to verify consistency in timeliness of \nrepairs and determine whether the call-button upgrades at CFCF reduced the volume of required \nrepairs.    \n \nAs recommended, PDP updated its post orders in this reporting period to include requirements to \nsubmit work orders and ensure quality security checks if call buttons are inoperable, and to \ndepopulate cells if damage to the call-button systems becomes dangerous (with exposed wires, \nfor example). \n \nSub-provision 12.5--PDP will provide refresher training before June 1, 2022, to correctional \nstaff on PDP practices with respect to responses to the emergency call button system. \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \n \nSubstantive Provision 13—Visiting \n  \nSub-provision 13.1--As of March 7, 2022, PDP reinstituted in-person visitation for all \nvaccinated incarcerated persons with family members. PDP is in the process of increasing \ncapacity for in-person visits by increasing the number of visits that can be accommodated during \nthe current hourly schedule.  At a minimum, current CFCF visiting shall be increased by 8 slots, \nPICC increased by 4 slots, and RCF increased by 2 slots.  \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \ndiscontinued)  \n \nSub-provision 13.2--Further, the parties and Monitor shall discuss all matters related to \nvisitation, and the monitor shall issue recommendations on these issues.  \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP acknowledges previously reported weaknesses in its visiting program and reports it has not \nmade meaningful progress in this reporting period.  PDP made initial progress in the previous \nreporting period by soliciting feedback from visitors and Class Members.62  PDP reports it \nintends to incorporate feedback into a visiting improvement plan scheduled for completion in the \nnext reporting period but is currently unable to commit to changes based on specific feedback \nreceived.     \n \n61 The four-person temporary cells were not included in the upgrade.  PDP will assess future renovation needs based \non the outcome of the current project. \n62 See Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 54.  \n  58 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 60 of 69\n \nThe Monitoring Team remains unable to make informed recommendations for new or additional \nvisiting timeslots without a reliable baseline of scheduled, attended, canceled, and refused visits.  \nPDP reports it will be unable to augment its current visiting schedule without additional staff.  \nThe Monitoring Team previously made interim recommendations for improvement based on \nanecdotal information and observations during site visits, including:  (1) analyzing filled versus \nunfilled in-person visiting timeslots and making any necessary scheduling adjustments \n(consistent with the evening visiting request above); (2) ensuring family visiting spaces in all \nfacilities are regularly sanitized; and (3) ensuring family visiting areas are stocked with age and \nculturally appropriate activities for youth.63   \n \nSub-provision 13.3--PDP reaffirms that it will acknowledge and record the vaccination status of \nthose individuals who provide information that they were vaccinated. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (October 12, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \nSubstantive Provision 14—Attorney Visiting  \n \nSub-provision 14.1--PDP shall continue to follow a policy of providing attorneys with access to \ntheir clients within 45 minutes of their scheduled visit. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs in previous reporting periods, the requirement that attorneys receive access to their clients \nwithin 45 minutes of scheduled visits was not possible to measure because attorney visits are not \nscheduled and current systems are not designed to track attorney arrival and wait times.64  \nBecause data is limited, the Monitoring Team has relied largely on reports from PDP, Class \nMembers, the Defender Association of Philadelphia (Defender Association), members of the \nprivate bar, and Remick class counsel in assessing deficiencies.  By all accounts, delays in \nofficial visiting continue but have reduced both in frequency and duration since 2022.  \n \nDelayed population counts, institutional lockdowns, and other operational emergencies have \nbeen the most common reasons cited for visiting delays or cancelations.  Attorneys have also \nreported lengthy delays between clients during back-to-back visits and that visiting rooms are \nleft unoccupied during high-traffic hours.   \n \nIn the third reporting period, the Monitor requested that PDP Deputy Commissioner of \nAdministration and the Warden of CFCF work directly with the Defender Association to \nstrategize mutually agreeable solutions to official visiting delays.  As a result of these efforts, \nPDP has instituted or agreed to the following changes: \n \n•  On September 18, 2023, PDP adjusted tablet visiting schedules at CFCF to begin at 12 \npm rather than during morning high-traffic hours.  Tablet visits occur in the same rooms \n \n63 Id. at 55; Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 51-52; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 4, at 29-30. \n64 See Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 55; See also Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 52-53.  \n  59 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 61 of 69\nas in-person visits, so this schedule change increased available space for in-person visits \nduring peak hours. \n•  In October 2023, PDP modified institutional count times at CFCF to reduce the \nlikelihood that clearance delays will interfere with peak official visiting hours.    \n•  In November 2023, PDP began utilizing two additional rooms for official visits with all \nClass Members that had previously been reserved exclusively for visits with Class \nMembers in segregation or protective custody at CFCF.  The Defender Association has \nalso agreed to allow afternoon official visits to take place in a room typically reserved for \nDefender Association personnel only. \n•  In March 2024, PDP reported it began utilizing an additional room for official visits that \nhad previously been reserved exclusively for First Judicial District of Pennsylvania \nhearings.  This room is reportedly available for visits each day when proceedings \nadjourn, typically in the early afternoon. \n•  PDP has agreed to permit the use of City-issued internet hotspots in the visiting area.  \n \nThe Monitoring Team is still awaiting determinations regarding additional proposals, but PDP’s \nproactivity in this reporting period has resulted in marked improvements.  PDP reports that \nstaffing deficiencies continue to cause delays with some frequency, which is consistent with \nongoing issues reported by the Defender Association and other counsel. PDP’s efforts to improve \nefficiency and Class Members’ access to counsel are commendable; however, PDP will be \nunlikely to comply with all policy revisions without additional personnel.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team will track the durability of improvements in the next reporting period and \nincorporate findings into policy recommendations that PDP will use as the basis for policy \nchanges in subsequent reporting periods.  Compliance with Substantive Provision 14—Visiting \nwill then be measured based on PDP’s compliance with its revised policies.   \n \nSub-provision 14.2--For remote legal visits (in all formats), the PDP shall continue to ensure \nthat the client is on the call/computer/video within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time of the \nappointment.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nPDP reports it is not approaching compliance with the 15-minute requirement for remote legal \nvisits due to staffing shortages.  This is consistent with delays tracked by the Monitoring Team.  \nAs previously reported, PDP tracks delays for completed calls but does not track calls that are \nscheduled but not completed, which will pose methodological challenges once PDP is ready for a \ncompliance audit.  For now, the Monitoring Team will continue to use its own tablet visiting data \nto assess progress.  \n \nFrom September 1, 2023, through December 31, 2023, 63 of 77 or 82 percent of the Deputy \nMonitor’s scheduled tablet visits were attended by Class Members.  This reflects a good \nattendance rate and is consistent with the second and third reporting periods.  However, 14 of the \n77 visits were no-shows and another 18 were delayed beyond the 15-minute compliance window, \nsuggesting a 58 percent compliance rate for sub-provision 14.2 in this reporting period.   \n \n  60 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 62 of 69\nCurrently, all tablet meetings are scheduled in one-hour time slots.  The Monitoring Team \npreviously recommended that PDP increase efficiency by also offering 30-minute time slots for \ntablet visits.65  In February 2024, PDP confirmed with the third-party vendor that it is capable of \noffering 30-minute time slots.  As a result, PDP reports that it anticipates implementing a pilot \nprogram when operationally feasible in the next reporting period.  However, like in-person visits, \ndelays and problems are likely to persist without additional staff.  \n \nSub-provision 14.3--For these time frames, PDP will not be responsible for delays caused by the \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, but where a delay is caused by the \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, PDP will inform the attorney of the delay. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n  \nAs previously reported, PDP’s current policy does not require notification to attorneys when \nvisits are delayed or canceled, and PDP has not issued an interim directive regarding this \nrequirement.66  Personnel have been instructed to notify attorneys of delays, cancelations, or \nrefusals; however, they may not be held accountable for failures to comply until policies and post \norders have been revised and personnel have been trained.  The Monitoring Team does not \nanticipate meaningful progress toward implementation of this sub-provision in the next reporting \nperiod.   \nSubstantive Provision 15—COVID-19 Testing \n \nThe PDP shall continue the present policy regarding testing of persons who are scheduled for \ncourt.  Those who are housed on “green blocks” are either fully vaccinated or are not \nconsidered to have been exposed to COVID-19.  They will be rapid-tested the night before court, \nand they will be brought to court if they receive negative test results. Those housed on a “yellow \nblock” may have been exposed to a COVID-19-positive individual, and they will be rapid-tested \ntwice, the night before court and the morning of court.  They will be transported to court if both \ntests are negative.  Those housed on a “red block” are COVID-19 positive and will be isolated \nfor ten days and not brought to court during that time frame.  These protocols will be maintained \nsubject to continued cooperation from criminal justice partners and on the advice of the \nPhiladelphia Department of Public Health. Provided, however, that the Defendants shall not \nunilaterally change the protocols and they shall timely notify Plaintiffs’ counsel of any change or \nproposed change in these protocols. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (October 12, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \n \nSubstantive Provision 16—Quarantine  \n \nIf there becomes a need in the future for use of quarantine housing areas at PDP, CDC \nguidelines shall continue to be followed for those who have been exposed to COVID-19. Under \n \n65 Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 57.  \n66 Id. at 57; Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 54. \n  61 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 63 of 69\ncurrent policy, see Interim Guidance on Management for Correctional and Detention Centers, \nJune 9, 2021, for persons who are vaccinated and are exposed to a person with COVID-19, but \ntest negative, they shall not be quarantined; for those who have been exposed to COVID-19, but \nwho have not been vaccinated, and test negative, they shall be quarantined for a period of ten \ndays and released at that time if they test negative. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (October 12, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \n \nSubstantive Provision 17—Sanitation \n \nSub-provision 17.1--Defendants agree to continue conducting the weekly General Inspection \n(“GI”) cleaning days with supplies provided by officers to clean cells and housing areas. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs with previous reporting periods, sanitation quality in this reporting period varied among PDP \nfacilities and housing units.  Facility wardens and staff remain responsive to issues brought to \ntheir attention and make noticeable efforts to improve between site visits.  Despite incremental \nsystemic improvements and intermittent unit-specific improvements, nearly every sanitation \nissue reported in the first three reporting periods persisted to an unacceptable degree in this \nreporting period.  \n \nIn November 2023, the Commissioner implemented internal sanitation inspections consistent \nwith some of the Monitoring Team’s recommendations.  Initial audits included 10 inspections in \nNovember 2023.  Findings were provided for review and largely mirror deficiencies observed by \nthe Monitoring Team.  Examples include: \n \n•  An initial inspection at CFCF identified units lacked cleaning supplies.  At that time, \ntrash was noted as routinely collected but showers required deep cleaning.67  Although \nsample sizes were not noted, an estimated 80 to 90 percent of Class Members interviewed \nreported they do not consistently receive clean clothing and linen.  Thirty percent of those \ninterviewed reported not having a second set of outer wear, 50 percent reported not \nconsistently receiving soap, and 30 percent reported not having toilet paper.  Follow-up \ninspections completed later in November 2023, again, noted a lack of cleaning supplies, \nunsatisfactory shower cleaning, inadequate clothing/linen exchange, and inconsistent \ndistribution of cleaning supplies.  Also, trash was uncollected and overflowing at the time \nof the follow-up inspection.68 \n•  At RCF and DC housing units, auditors noted serious facility maintenance issues, vector \ncontrol concerns, and lack of access to cleaning supplies and clean clothing.69 \n \n67 PDP Audit – CFCF – November 6, 2023. \n68 PDP Audit – CFCF – November 20, 2023. \n69 PDP Audit RCF Detention Facility – November 13, 2023. \n  62 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 64 of 69\n•  At PHSW, auditors noted unresolved maintenance issues and damaged, inoperable \ncells.70 \n•  At RCF-Main Facility, the findings were generally more positive, which is consistent \nwith conditions observed during site visits.71 \n•  At MOD 3, youth reported access to laundry, cleaning supplies, and linen.  The unit was \ndetermined to be in satisfactory condition.72 \n•  In PICC units, Class Members reported having sufficient access to cleaning supplies, and \nmost units were noted as being in acceptable condition.  No vector control issues were \nnoted, and Class Members interviewed stated they were generally receiving clean \nclothing.  An estimated 20 percent of Class Members interviewed reported only one set \nof outerwear.  Approximately 50 percent of Class Members interviewed raised issues \nwith insufficient supplies of toilet paper and/or soap.73  The auditors conducted a follow-\nup review at PICC later in the month and reported improved compliance with outer wear \nbut new complaints regarding clean linens.  In general, the follow-up review found that \ntrash was collected, showers were clean, vector control was sustained, and Class \nMembers interviewed reported adequate access to toilet paper, soap, and cleaning \nsupplies.74 \n \nAudit reporting methods were not consistent across facilities and will require refinement in the \nnext reporting period.  It appears that small samples of Class Members were interviewed, so \npercentages reported may be misleading; however, findings reflect critical, transparent self-\nassessment and internal audits should continue.  Additional improvements were observable \nduring subsequent site visits in January and February, presumably resulting from closer internal \nmonitoring.   \n \nInitial expansion of PDP’s maintenance contract resulted in the completion of nearly 80 projects \nat PICC and an apparent reversal of that facility’s extreme rodent and insect infestations.   \nIn previous reporting periods, PICC was inappropriately restricting Class Members’ access to \nfeminine hygiene products.75  In September 2023, PICC’s leadership team met with Class \nMembers who reportedly requested a set distribution schedule for feminine hygiene products.  In \nresponse, the Warden directed facility lieutenants to ensure each Class Member received packets \nthree times per week containing two rolls of toilet paper, eight sanitary pads, four tampons, and \none bar of soap.  During site visits in November 2023 and January 2024, the Warden reported \nthat staffing shortages were impacting compliance with the schedule and Class Members, again, \nreported inconsistent supplies.  In February 2023, the Warden reported improved compliance \nwith the feminine hygiene distribution schedule.  On March 26, 2023, PDP installed dispensers \nin all women’s housing units, which provide Class Members with direct access to tampons free \nof charge.  This reported change is consistent with the Monitoring Team’s recommendations and \n \n70 PDP Audit RCF PHSW – November 13, 2023. \n71 PDP Audit RCF Main – November 13, 2023. \n72 PDP Audit RCF MOD 3 – November 15, 2023.  Mod 3 is an old unit and the housing environment and program \nofferings do not meet current youth confinement standards.    \n73 PDP Audit – PICC – November 9, 2023. \n74 PDP Audit – PICC – November 24, 2023. \n75 See Monitor’s Third Report, supra note 4, at 62.  \n  63 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 65 of 69\nmarks important progress for a facility that struggled more than others through most of the initial \nsettlement term.     \n \nMany managers and staff in all PDP facilities are also committed to higher cleanliness standards \nand should be acknowledged for their efforts.  However, PDP’s sanitation issues are long \nstanding, progressive, and deeply systemic.  They intersect with dilapidated facilities and \ninconsistent maintenance and vector control programs that have rendered some neglected units \nunlivable.  Class Members simply cannot be forced to reside in unsanitary, poorly maintained 7-\nby-13-foot spaces with only periodic relief during limited out-of-cell time.  Conditions will not \nbe corrected system-wide with less than half of necessary security staff and require immediate, \nfocused intervention.   \n \nSub-provision 17.2--[Defendants agree] to provide regular laundry services under current PDP \npolicies. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance   \n \nThere have been no reported improvements in laundry distribution in this reporting period.   \n \nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 17—Sanitation, from the Monitor’s \nThird Report: \n   \n1.  PDP should modify schedules to increase the frequency of deep cleaning rounds. \nPDP reports it was unable to implement this recommendation due to insufficient  \n        staffing.  The Monitoring Team therefore makes additional recommendation 7 below  \n        for immediate action. \n2.  PDP should provide Class Members with secure, rodent-proof containers for their \nbelongings. \nPDP has not implemented this recommendation. \n3.  PDP should expedite procurement of sufficient undergarments to meet the needs of all \nClass Members.        \nIn January 2024, PDP reported it has procured a consistent supply of undergarments \nfor all female Class Members.  This should be expanded to include the provision of \nundergarments to all Class Members. \n4.  PDP jail managers should conduct thorough assessments in every facility to identify \nspecific deficiencies in the areas of general sanitation and vector control, clothing and \nlinen exchange, and issuance of hygiene supplies.   \nInternal audits are being completed and PDP has committed to refining the audit \nprocess in the next reporting period. \n5.  PDP should revise its post orders to reflect operational nuances at each facility.  Post \norders should account for the needs of unique populations, such as women, youth, and \nthose navigating mental illness or other disabilities. \n        PDP reports revisions are in progress.   \n6.  PDP executives and facility leadership should develop plans to increase guidance for unit \npersonnel in meeting expectations for general sanitation and vector control, clothing and \n  64 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 66 of 69\nlinen exchange, and the issuance of cleaning and hygiene supplies.  Plans should include \neffective monitoring via audits or other modes of verification and specific \nacknowledgement of personnel who meet expectations and support or discipline, as \nappropriate, of those who do not.  \nInternal audits have been initiated but this recommendation is unlikely to be fully \nimplemented with current staff.   \n \nAdditional recommendation for immediate action: \n \n7.  The City should authorize the emergency procurement of outside contractors to deep \nclean housing units on a regular schedule, similar to its approach in medical and mental \nhealth housing units, which have shown improvement as a result.  The contract should \ninclude entire housing units, showers, and all biohazardous cells prior to re-occupancy.  \n \nSubstantive Provision 18—Use-of-Force \n \nPDP policies and training address correctional staff’s use of force, use of pepper spray, de-\nescalation measures, and an incarcerated person’s non-compliance with verbal commands.  The \nparties agree that correctional officers should follow de-escalation measures provided in PDP \npolicies.  The Monitor shall review these issues and make recommendations based on a review of \nall relevant material and factors.  In the interim, PDP shall advise and re-train correctional \nofficers on the proper application of the Use of Force and Restraints Policy, 3.A.8, and with \nrespect to de-escalation requirements in accordance with the PDP policy which in part states: \n“Force is only used when necessary and only to the degree required to control the inmate(s) or \nrestore order…The use of pepper spray is justifiable when the Officer’s presence and verbal \ncommand options have been exhausted and the inmate remains non-compliant or the inmate’s \nlevel of resistance has escalated….Staff will not use pepper spray as a means of punishment, \npersonal abuse, or harassment.” \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs anticipated, deficiencies with PDP’s use of force policies and practices outlined in the \nMonitor’s second and third reports persisted in this reporting period.76  Procurement of \ntechnology-based upgrades such as an early warning system, body-worn cameras, and unified \nCCTV is slow and upgrades are not anticipated in 2024.  Procurement delays notwithstanding, \nimplementation of these technologies would require personnel resources that PDP does not \ncurrently have.  Insufficient staff at all security levels remains PDP’s greatest barrier to \ncorrecting deficiencies and PDP appears to lack internal capacity to manage a use of force \nreform project of this scope and complexity.  Until additional staff are hired and trained, and \npolicies are updated and implemented, PDP’s use of force practices will continue to pose high \nrisk for injury and abuse with limited compliance and accountability.     \n \nIn the previous reporting period, the Commissioner reiterated her expectations for use of force \nreporting and established a Use of Force Review Team (UFRT) by redirecting one captain, two \n \n76 See Id. at 64; See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 61-62.  \n  65 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 67 of 69\nlieutenants, and one analyst to assess designated incidents.  The Commissioner correctly \npredicted the five-person team would be too small to spur meaningful change and that any \nchange would be slow.  Findings in this reporting period generally support this prediction and \nconfirm negative findings from previous reporting periods.  PDP has shown improvement in this \nreporting period in the area of critical use of force analysis.  Because unconstitutional use of \nforce practices are so destructive, and because each small improvement lays the foundation for \nreform, efforts to improve should be acknowledged and must continue.  PDP’s staffing crisis \ncontinues to prevent timely, quality completion and review of use of force cases at every step in \nPDP’s chain of command, and many policy and training issues identified remain unaddressed.   \n \nIn this reporting period, SME Terri McDonald (SME McDonald) focused on establishing the \nMonitoring Team’s expectations for quality reviews of use of force incidents.  She sampled 49 \nuse of force cases from July and August 2023, notified PDP which cases would be reviewed, and \nscheduled frequent technical support meetings with the UFRT and/or facility wardens and PDP \nexecutives throughout the reporting period.  By September 2023, the UFRT had reviewed 14 of \nthe 49 sampled cases.  SME McDonald highlighted deficiencies in initial reviews, reemphasized \nexpectations for warden and UFRT-level reviews, and encouraged the UFRT to focus on \ncorrecting previously highlighted deficiencies in the remaining 35 cases.  The quality of \nsubsequent UFRT reviews improved and, by January 2024, the UFRT had completed another 22 \nreviews, for a total of 36 of 49 cases reviewed in this reporting period.   \n \nThe quality of UFRT and warden-level reviews showed improvement in this reporting period.  \nExamples include:   \n \n•  The UFRT identified failures to de-escalate and employ planning procedures during non-\nemergent incidents, such as requesting assistance from mental health staff and video \nrecording of pre-force interactions.   \n•  The UFRT identified canned, conflicting, or otherwise poor report writing.   \n•  The UFRT identified and is tracking gaps in CCTV coverage. \n•  The UFRT flagged reports and reviews that were not completed within required \ntimeframes.   \n•  Every UFRT review identified the need for additional training. \n \nUFRT reviews typically occur after warden-level reviews and many of the issues identified \nabove were not captured in warden-level reviews in this reporting period.  There were, however, \nimprovements noted in warden-level reviews as well.  In previous reporting periods, warden-\nlevel reviews consistently failed to document training issues, policy violations, or unnecessary or \nexcessive uses of force.77  In this reporting period, multiple warden-level reviews documented \none or more of these issues.  PICC’s reviews, for example, are more thorough and show a \nmarked improvement from previous reporting periods.  PICC’s warden-level reviews were also \ncompleted within required timeframes more consistently, resulting in more timely UFRT \nreviews.   \n \n \n77 See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 4, at 62.  \n  66 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 68 of 69\nPDP reports increased efforts in issuing internal corrective action, which may have supported the \nfollowing additional improvements noted in SME McDonald’s review:   \n \n•  The sample contained fewer incidents of unnecessary force against Class Members who \nrefuse to follow orders but do not present an immediate threat.    \n•  Sampled cases showed more correctional officers sought assistance from supervisors \nbefore using force. \n•  The sample contained examples of effective post-force restraint of combative Class \nMembers, which decreases the likelihood of additional or more serious force during \nincidents.   \n•  Sampled cases reflect slight improvements in report quality.   \n•  CCTV of sampled cases suggests staff are more frequently maintaining radios on their \nperson and using them when backup is needed.  The Monitoring Team has recommended \npersonal alarm devices to rapidly summon back-up to critical incidents.78  This \nrecommendation is particularly important given PDP’s dangerous staffing crisis.     \n \nDespite important progress noted above, sample cases reflect the following ongoing issues, some \nof which were identified in PDP’s internal reviews:   \n \n•  Use of force reports continue to lack specificity and information necessary to evaluate \ndecision making of involved personnel. \n•  Correctional officers and supervisors too frequently use force prematurely, with \ninsufficient effort to de-escalate, against Class Members who are secured behind locked \ndoors or otherwise pose little immediate threat.   \n•  PDP staff and supervisors too often fail to request assistance from mental health \npersonnel in efforts to de-escalate and prevent force. \n•  In some cases, it appears that Class Members attempt to comply with commands but are \nnot given the opportunity before force is used against them.   \n•  Some cases that should have been referred for investigation for inappropriate or excessive \nforce are not, and some disciplinary action does not reflect the seriousness of the \nmisconduct.   \n \nPDP’s staffing shortage results in overcrowding, delayed and withheld services, and extended \nperiods of cell confinement and is too often the root cause of force incidents.  The staffing \nshortage often increases the length and size of disturbances, the severity of force used, and \nresulting injury to Class Members and staff.  PDP supervisors and managers are generally not \nexposed to evolving national standards for jail use of force and some lack the skills necessary to \nproperly mentor their staff.  They are unlikely to receive additional training as long as PDP lacks \ncoverage to relieve them from their posts.   \n \nPDP requires additional managers to identify necessary policy revisions, thoroughly review \nincidents, and issue appropriate corrective action, it requires additional supervisors to guide and \ninstruct staff during use of force incidents and in after-action reviews, and it requires enough \n \n78 Id. at 64.  \n  67 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 69 of 69\nline-level staff to ensure coverage in all housing units to meet basic safety standards.  PDP \ncannot be expected to correct deficiencies through force review, briefings, and discipline alone \nand will require additional staff to achieve substantial compliance with this substantive \nprovision.   \n  68 \n      ",

INTRODUCTION \n \n1.     The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) is a consumer protection statute, \nthe purpose of which is “to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors \n. . .” Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 559 U.S. 573, 602 (2010) \n(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1692(e)). Congress created the FDCPA in response to the “abundant \nevidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many \ndebt collectors.” 15 U.S.C. § 1692(a). \n2.     Section 1692e(8) of the FDCPA provides that a debt collector may not use false or \nmisleading representations in connection with the attempt to collect a debt, namely, a \ndebt collector may not communicate or threaten to communicate “credit information \nwhich is known or should be known to be false, including the failure to communicate that \na disputed debt is disputed.” 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(8). \nII.  FACTS \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 2 of 8\n3.     Debt Collector is reporXng on a past due debt owed to Progressive In Co in the \namount of $92. PlainXﬀ called and disputed. \nIII.  FDCPA \n \n \n4.     In enacting The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692 et seq. \n(“FDCPA”),  Congress  recognized  the  universal  agreement  among  scholars,  law \nenforcement officials, and even debt collectors that the number of persons who willfully \nrefuse to pay just debts is minuscule [sic]. . . . [T]he vast majority of consumers who obtain \ncredit fully intend to repay their debts. When default occurs, it is nearly always due to an \nunforeseen  event  such  as  unemployment,  overextension,  serious  illness,  or  marital \ndifficulties or divorce. S. Rep. No. 382, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1977), reprinted in 1977 \nUSCCAN 1695, 1697. The FDCPA states that its purpose, in part, is \"to eliminate abusive \ndebt collection practices by debt collectors.\" 15 U.S.C. §1692(e). The Act is designed to \nprotect consumers from unscrupulous collectors, whether or not there is a valid debt. \nMace v. Van Ru Credit Corp., 109 F.3d 338 (7th Cir. 1997); Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, \n594 (7th Cir. 1998); The FDCPA broadly prohibits unfair or unconscionable collection \nmethods;  conduct  which  harasses,  oppresses  or  abuses  any  debtor;  and  any  false, \ndeceptive or misleading statements, in connection with the collection of a debt. \n5.     The [Consumer Credit Protection] Act is remedial in nature, designed to remedy \nwhat  Congressional  hearings  revealed  to  be  unscrupulous  and  predatory  creditor \npractices throughout the nation. Since the statute is remedial in nature, its terms must be \nconstrued in liberal fashion if the underlying Congressional purpose is to be effectuated. \nN.C. Freed Co. v. Board of Governors, 473 F.2d 1210, 1214 (2nd Cir. 1973). Statutory \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 3 of 8\ndamages are recoverable for violations, whether or not the consumer proves actual \ndamages. Bartlett v. Heibl, 128 F.3d 497, 499 (7th Cir.1997). \n6.     Plaintiff need not prove intent, bad faith or negligence in an FDCPA case. Gearing \nv. Check Brokerage Corp., 233 F.3d 469, 472 (7th Cir.2000). The \"FDCPA is a strict liability \nstatute,\" and \"proof of one violation is sufficient to support summary judgment for the \nplaintiff.\" Cacace v. Lucas, 775 F. Supp. 502, 505 (D. Conn. 1990); Turner v. J.V.D.B. & \nAssociates, Inc., 330 F.3d 991, 995 (7th Cir. 2003); Reich v. Van Ru Credit Corp., No. 4-15- \nCV-2. (E.D. Texas, June 8, 2016). \n7.     RMS  violated  15  U.S.C  §§  1692e  and  1692e(8)  of  the  FDCPA,  by  failing  to \ncommunicate  that  Plaintiff  had  disputed  his  debt,  when  RMS  communicated  other \ninformation to the consumer reporting agencies. §1692e(8) of the FDCPA is very clear; if \nRMS knew or should have known that Plaintiff disputed the alleged debt, it should have \ncommunicated the disputed status to any third parties, including the consumer reporting \nagencies, if RMS chose to continue to communicate information about the alleged debt. \n8.     RMS attempts to escape liability under the FDCPA by claiming that it did not realize \nthat  Plaintiff  was  disputing  a  debt.  However,  this  argument  falls  flat,  as  Plaintiff’s \nstatement “Yeah, you were kind of breaking up there, but, uh, basically, um, I seen an \naccount reported on my credit report. I was just calling to double check and verify \neverything, and the balance seems to be a little off. But as of right now, I wanted to \nknow who the creditor name was.“ Multiples federal district courts have found that the \nconsumer can the “validity of the debt, any portion therefore” In Emerson v. Fid. Capital \nHoldings, Inc., the court found, in denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, that “[A] \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 4 of 8\nstatement that ‘the amount reported is not accurate’ evinces the intention to dispute the \nvalidity of at least a portion of the purported debt.” Emerson v. Fid. Capital Holdings, Inc., \nNo. 15 C 3416, 2015 WL 5086458, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 14, 2015). Also see Rodriguez v. I.Q. \nData International, 15-cv-383 pg. 3-4 (N.D.Ill November 4, 2015). \n \nIV.  DEFENDANT VIOLATED §§ 1692e and 1692e(8) BY  \nFAILING TO COMMUNICATE THAT PLAINTIFF HAD DISPUTED HIS DEBT \n \n \n9.     Section 1692e(8) of the FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from making false or \nmisleading representations in connection with the collection of any debt: \nFalse or misleading representations \n \nA debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or \nmeans in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general \napplication of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section: \n \n. . . (8) Communicating or threatening to communicate to any person credit \ninformation which is known or which should be known to be false, including the \nfailure to communicate that a disputed debt is disputed. . . . \n \n10.    This section of the FDCPA is clear; if a debt collector knows, or should know, that \na specific debt is disputed, it must communicate that fact if it elects to communicate other \ninformation  regarding  that  debt.  This  includes  communications  to  credit  reporting \nbureaus, like TransUnion. A dispute can be made for any reason and “a debt collector \ncannot require a consumer to have a valid reason or to submit particular types of \ndocumentation in order to dispute a debt.” Hudspeth v. Capital Mgmt. Servs., L.P., No. \n11-CV-03148-PAB-MEH, 2013 WL 674019, at *7 (D. Colo. Feb. 25, 2013) (citing DeSantis \nv. Computer Credit, Inc., 269 F.3d 159, 162 (2d Cir. 2001). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 5 of 8\n11.    In Hudspeth the court held, citing DeSantis that “[t]he consumer’s right to take \nthe position . . . that the debt is disputed does not depend on whether the consumer has \na valid reason not to pay. The consumer, for example, may not recognize the name of the \ncreditor, may not know whether he incurred the debt, may have a question whether the \ndebt (or part of it) has been paid, or may be unsure of the amount. . . .” Id. Furthermore, \n“[t]here is no requirement that any dispute be ‘valid’ for this statute to apply; only that \nthere be a dispute.” Hoffman v. Partners in Collections, Inc., No. 93 C 4182, 1993 WL \n358158, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 14, 1993). \n12.    The term “dispute” is not speciﬁcally deﬁned in the FDCPA nor does it gives \nconsumer procedure for consumer to follow to dispute their debt. “But the ordinary \nmeaning of “dispute” is clear. See Dispute, Mer12 Nos. 17-1773, 17-1860, 17-1866, 17-\n2622,  17-2756,  18-1734  riam-Webster  DicXonary,  hqp://www.merriam-webster. \ncom/dicXonary/dispute (last visited March 27, 2024) (deﬁning “dispute” as “to call into \nquesXon or cast doubt upon”). Evans v Porsolio Recovery Associates (7th Cir. Appeals \nMay. 2, 2018). The ordinary meaning of “to dispute” something “ordinarily means ‘to call \ninto quesXon,’ or ‘to oppose.’” Dixon v. RJM AcquisiXons, LLC, No. 13-CV-02436-MSK-MJW, \n2015 WL 729388, at *3 (D. Col. Feb. 17, 2015) (ciXng Merriam- Webster’s Collegiate \nDicXonary 335 (10th ed. 2001); see also Carter v. Credit Bureau of Carbon County, No. , \n2015 WL 4450698, at *3 (D. Colo. July 20, 2015) (ﬁnding that the statement “insurance \nshould have paid the debt” was consistent with “the plain meaning of ‘dispute,’ (‘to argue \nabout’ or ‘to call into quesXon’)”). In Emerson v. Fid. Capital Holdings, Inc., the exact same \nstatement, “the amount reported is not accurate,” was found to consXtute a dispute \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 6 of 8\nbecause it “evinces the intenXon to dispute the validity of at least a porXon of the \npurported debt.” No. 15 C 3416, 2015 WL 5086458, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 14, 2015). Also see \nRodriguez v. I.Q. Data InternaXonal, 15-cv-383 pg. 3-4 (N.D.IL November 4, 2015). \n13.    Regardless  of  the  validity  of  the  amount  reported,  Plaintiff’s  statement \nconstituted a dispute because it “called into question”, or “evinced the intention to \ndispute” the alleged debt. Even more so, Plaintiff clearly stated what he disputed about \nthis debt; the balance seems a little bit off.  \n14.    After receiving this call RMS elected to communicate credit information to the \nconsumer reporting agencies without informing them of the dispute. Because RMS \ncommunicated this credit information, including the alleged balance, date of delinquency \nand account number, RMS was also required to communicate Plaintiff’s dispute to the \nconsumer reporting agencies as well. But even though RMS had received Plaintiff’s call, \nRMS  failed  to  communicate  the  debt’s  disputed  status  to  the  consumer  reporting \nagencies. \n15.    RMS  communications  with  the  TransUnion,  Equifax,  and  Experian  consumer \nreporting agencies are considered communications in connection with the collection of a \ndebt, since credit reporting by a debt collector can be considered a form of debt \ncollection. Akalwadi v. Risk Management Alternatives, Inc., 336 F.Supp.2d 492, at 503 \n(D.Md. 2004) (stating that \"reporting the status of a consumer debt to a credit reporting \nagency is an activity that would certainly appear to meet the statute's requirement that \nthe false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means be \"in connection with\" the \ncollection of a debt.\"). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 7 of 8\n16.    Additionally, this was a material violation of the FDCPA because it was a direct \nviolation of a specifically enumerated section of the FDCPA, and whether an individual \ndisputes a debt is by its own nature material. In fact, the Eighth Circuit held that whether \nor not a debt is disputed is “a piece of information that is always material” and that “if a \ndebt collector elects to communicate \"credit information\" about a consumer” it must \ncommunicate the dispute if a consumer made the dispute. Wilhelm v. Credico, Inc., 519 \nF.3d 416, at 418 (8th Cir., 2008); also see Baker v. I.Q. Data Int'l, Inc., 14-cv-0114-WJM-\nMEH (D. Colo., 2015). \n17.    Thus, Defendant RMS failed to communicate that Plaintiff’s alleged debt was \ndisputed, even though it knew or should have known Plaintiff disputed the alleged debt, \nwhen  it  communicated  other  credit  information  regarding  the  alleged  debt  to  the \nconsumer reporting agencies, in clear violation of § 1692e(8). Defendant Motion to \nDismiss should not be granted. \n \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n \n \nDated: March 27th, 2024         By: _____________________ \n \n              Thomas Lawson - Pro Se Plaintiff \n              5911 Loretto Avenue \n              Philadelphia, PA 19149 \n              (267) 304-8122 \n              Butterlawson23@gmail.com \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 204   Filed 03/29/24   Page 8 of 8\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \nI certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing document has been forwarded via \nCM/ECF system to all parties entitled to notice of the same on March 27th, 2024: \n \nChristopher A.

To the extent the hiring of services \ncontemplated by the provision of this Order is a mandatory subject of bargaining, \nthe  contract  with  the  company  capable  of  the  services  contemplated  by  this \nparagraph shall remain in place consistent with any terms negotiated through \nbargaining, subject to final approval by the Court. \ne.  The City shall immediately authorize PDP to offer additional double-time pay for \nany day of the week as necessary to staff all vacant shifts.  \nf.  To assist with employee retention, the City shall, within 150 days of the date of this \nOrder, fund an adequate employee wellness program.  Within 90 days of the date \nof this Order, the PDP shall appoint a Wellness Coordinator to oversee the PDP’s \nemployee wellness program.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 222   Filed 08/16/24   Page 3 of 9\n \ng.

REMEDY  \na.  As an equitable remedy imposed under this Court’s contempt power, the City of \nPhiladelphia is ordered to pay the sum of 25 million dollars9 into the Registry of \nthis Court.  These funds will be held by the Court solely as the prerequisite for a \nfurther order directing the Clerk of Court to disburse said funds to the City of \nPhiladelphia Grants Fund.  The funds are to be designated for use exclusively to \ncomply with the terms of this Order, with the City required to submit periodic \nreports to the Court as to all disbursements.  Upon further notice from the Court, \nthe appropriate City representative shall execute Form AO-213P, with an original, \nnon-electronic signature, to facilitate the disbursement via an electronic funds \ntransfer.    The  City  is  prohibited  from  reducing  funds  currently  budgeted  or \nprojected for future fiscal years for the operation of the PDP because of its \nobligation to comply with this or any other provision of this Order.  \n8.  COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \na.  To the extent the expansion or hiring of services or civilianization of positions \ncontemplated by the provisions of this Order are mandatory subjects of bargaining, \n \n9 The spreadsheets submitted by the City, in a sworn declaration by the PDP Commissioner, show that from \nfiscal years 2020 to 2023 (July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2023), the City of Philadelphia saved $19,304,126 by \nunderspending its PDP budget, largely due to understaffing.  See ECF 216, Exs. A-C.  This action was \ncommenced in April 2020, and the spreadsheets from which this total was extracted date back several \nmonths before.  It should be noted, however, that if fiscal year 2020 were excluded from the calculations, \nthe shortfall in City spending on the prisons is even greater, totaling $25,119,265.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 222   Filed 08/16/24   Page 9 of 9\n \nincluding  but  not  limited  to  the  positions  recommended  by  the  Monitor  for \ncivilianization pursuant to provision 1.c, the City shall initiate bargaining and/or \nprovide notice to the applicable union of its intention to expand or hire services or \ncivilianize any positions within 45 days from the date of this Order.   \nb.  The City shall, as required to comply with the mandates of this Order and the \nSettlement  Agreement,  hire  or  contract  with  a  permanent  full-time  internal \nCompliance Coordinator within 120 days of the date of this Order with sufficient \nsupport  staff  to  facilitate  implementation  of  this  Order  and  the  Settlement \nAgreement.  In the meantime, the City shall remain responsible for compliance with \nall provisions of this Order and the Settlement Agreement. \ni.  Within 60 days of appointment, the Compliance Coordinator shall submit a \nstaffing plan to the Court via the Monitor for approval.  Remaining team \nmembers shall be appointed within 90 days following Court approval of the \nstaffing plan.  \nii.  Within 180 days of the date of this Order, Defendants shall submit a written \nstatus  report  on  their  progress  toward  implementation  of  this  Order.  \nSubsequent status reports shall be submitted on the first day of each quarter \nuntil otherwise directed by the Court.  \nc.  The Monitor shall continue to provide the Court with biannual status reports.   \nThe Court retains jurisdiction over any matter which may arise in connection with the \nadministration of this Order and may revise or order additional equitable relief or sanctions against \nthe Defendants pending information provided to the Court in conjunction with this Order.  \n  /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh   \nUnited States District Judge \n9 \n ",

Plaintiffs-Petitioners (“Plaintiffs”) are ten individuals held at the Philadelphia \nDepartment of Prisons (“PDP”) who, as a result of the policies, practices, and actions adopted and \nundertaken by Defendants-Respondents (“Defendants”), are at significant risk of contracting \nCOVID-19 (also known as the Coronavirus) and suffering from severe disease and possible death. \nThe current conditions of confinement at PDP’s facilities create a heightened and unreasonable \nrisk of COVID-19 for any confined person, and a substantial risk of severe illness or death for \nthose who are elderly and/or medically vulnerable to COVID-19.  The named Plaintiffs, on their \nown behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated, seek immediate changes in the conditions \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 2 of 24\nof their confinement to protect them from this clear and present danger of disease and death, and \nto ensure humane living conditions, as required by the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek \ninjunctive relief that would require, among other things, Defendants to comply with recognized \npublic health and safety measures, as adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(“CDC”), to prevent the spread of the virus for those confined at jails and prisons.  \n2.  Absent the implementation of and strict adherence to emergency measures that \ncomply with these recommended public health and safety measures, Plaintiffs seek the release of \nindividuals 55 and older and those with medical conditions that place them at heightened risk of \nsevere illness or death from COVID-19, as these individuals face heightened risks of life-\nthreatening conditions, and their removal from PDP would facilitate the quarantine and social \ndistancing measures recommended by the CDC and other public health officials. \n3.  Prisons and jails have become epicenters of COVID-19 in cities throughout the \ncountry.  In the PDP, on April 16, the city reported that a cumulative total of 100 incarcerated \npeople had tested positive for the virus.1  The next day, Philadelphia Commissioner of Public \nHealth Dr. Thomas Farley reported an additional thirteen new cases within the PDP.2  By Sunday, \nApril 19, the number of total reported cases rose to over 120.3  These numbers will continue to rise \n                                                 \n1 On Thursday, April 16, 2020, Philadelphia Managing Director Brian Abernathy provided this \ninformation during an April 16th, 2020 press conference.  See Philadelphia Department of Public \nHealth, Update on COVID-19 Coronavirus Response in Philadelphia, Facebook (April 16, \n2020), https://www.facebook.com/phillyhealth/videos/175556743555021 (Managing Director \nAbernathy noting that 100 incarcerated individual tested positive at approximately the 26 minute \nmark). \n2 See Philadelphia Department of Public Health, Update on COVID-19 Coronavirus Response in \nPhiladelphia, Facebook (April 17, 2020), https://www.facebook.com/phillyhealth/videos/ \n2975919772519206/ (Dr. Farley noting the increase at approximately the 12 minute mark). \n3 See Max Marin & Aaron Moselle, ‘Scared for Their Lives’: Inside the Coronavirus Outbreak in \nPhiladelphia’s Jails, WHYY (April 19, 2020), https://whyy.org/articles/scared-for-their-lives-\ninside-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-philadelphias-jails/. \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 24\nexponentially.  The population within PDP is uniquely vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19 due \nto the congregate nature of jails, exacerbated by unnecessary crowding, inadequate sanitation, \ndenial of hygiene products, and inadequate quarantine procedures.  The current conditions within \nPDP’s facilities create an extreme risk for the rapid, uncontrollable spread of COVID-19 among \nthe incarcerated population, correctional officers, health care workers, and beyond jail walls to the \nlarger Philadelphia community. \n4.  To  comply  with  basic  Constitutional  guarantees  against  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment and due process of law, conditions must be substantially improved to adhere to CDC \nguidelines for social distancing and enhanced sanitation and hygiene practices.  Defendants must \nimplement  adequate  quarantine  and  social  distancing  protocols;  provide  adequate  hygiene \nsupplies; ensure that sanitation practices conform to CDC standards; conduct recreation and meal \nservice in a manner that allows for appropriate social distancing; and require the use of Personal \nProtective Equipment (“PPE”) for staff and those incarcerated. \nI.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  Plaintiffs bring this putative class action pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 2241, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et \nseq. (“ADA”), for relief from both detention and conditions of confinement that violate their \nFourteenth Amendment and/or Eighth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. \n6.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act), 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a) (civil rights \njurisdiction), and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).  \n7.  This Court is the appropriate venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \nevents and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 24\nII.  PARTIES \n8.  Thomas Remick, Nadiyah Walker, Jay Diaz, Michael Alejandro, Michael Dantzler, \nRobert Hinton, Joseph Weiss, Joseph Skinner, Saddam Abdullah and James Bethea are all adult \nindividuals currently incarcerated at a PDP facility and are at a heightened risk for more severe \nsymptoms and potential death from COVID-19 due to their age and/or underlying medical \nconditions.  They sue for injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of themselves and on behalf \nof those who currently are or will in the future be subject to these unconstitutional conditions of \nconfinement within the PDP. \n9.  Defendant City of Philadelphia is a political subdivision organized and existing \nunder the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The City of Philadelphia funds, controls, \nand operates the Philadelphia Department of Prisons.  The City of Philadelphia currently has \nimmediate custody over Plaintiffs and all other putative class members.  \n10.  Defendant  Blanche Carney is  the Commissioner of PDP.  Defendant  Carney \ncurrently has immediate custody over Plaintiffs and all other putative class members.  Defendant \nCarney is a policymaker for the City of Philadelphia, and she is sued in her official capacity. \n11.  Defendant City of Philadelphia and Carney have at all relevant times acted under \ncolor of state law. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 24\nIII.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n  COVID-19 Poses a Significant Risk of Illness, Injury, and Death. \n12.  We are in the midst of the most significant pandemic in generations.  As of April \n20, 2020, there were 32,284 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania and 1,112 deaths.4,5  \nIn the City of Philadelphia, there have been 8,764 cases and 240 deaths as of April 20.6  These \nnumbers likely underestimate the impact and spread of the virus, given the lack of testing.7  \n13.  The  virus  spreads  from  person  to  person  through  respiratory  droplets,  close \npersonal contact, and from contact with contaminated surfaces and objects.8  There is no vaccine \nagainst COVID-19, and there is no known medication to prevent or treat infection.9  Social \ndistancing (deliberately keeping at least six feet of space between persons10) and a vigilant hygiene \nregimen, including washing hands frequently with soap and water, are the only known measures \n                                                 \n4 See Exhibit A, Expert Declaration of Dr. Joseph Amon, Ph.D. MSPH, ¶ 5 (“Amon Decl.”).  Dr. \nAmon is an infectious disease epidemiologist, Director of Global Health and Clinical Professor in \nthe department of Community Health and Prevention at the Drexel Dornsife School of Public \nHealth with past experience as an epidemiologist in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the U.S. \nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention. \n5 COVID-19 Data for Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Department of Health (April 2020), \nhttps://cutt.ly/Tt1J66h.  \n6 Id. \n7 See Exhibit B, Expert Declaration of Robert L.

The older a person is, the greater their risk of serious illness or death from COVID-\n19.13  A February 29, 2020 preliminary report found that individuals age 50-59 had an overall \nmortality rate of 1.3%; 60-69-year-olds had an overall 3.6% mortality rate, and those 70-79 years \nold had an 8% mortality rate.14  \n15.  People of any age are also at an elevated risk if they suffer from certain underlying \nmedical  conditions,  including  lung  disease,  heart  disease,  chronic  liver  or  kidney  disease \n(including hepatitis and dialysis patients), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, compromised immune \nsystems (such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune disease), blood disorders (including sickle cell \ndisease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, developmental delay, or asthma.15  An early report \nfrom the World Health Organization (“WHO”) estimated the mortality rate of 13.2% for COVID-\n19 patients with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic \nrespiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer.16 \n                                                 \n11 Amon Decl. ¶ 22-24; Cohen Decl. ¶ 9. \n12 Cohen Decl. ¶ 12. \n13 Amon Decl. ¶ 9 (observing that “those ≥54 years could be considered high risk for severe disease \nand death.”); Cohen Decl. ¶ 36. \n14 Age, Sex, Existing Conditions of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Chart, https://cutt.ly/ytEimUQ \n(data analysis based on WHO China Joint Mission Report). \n15 Amon Decl. ¶ 8; Cohen Decl. ¶ 43. \n16 Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), World \nHealth  Organization  (Feb.  28,  2020),  at  12,  https://www.who.int/docs/default-\nsource/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf \n  6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 24\n16.  The need for care, including intensive care, and the likelihood of death, is much \nhigher from COVID-19 infection than from influenza.17  According to recent estimates, the fatality \nrate of people infected with COVID-19 is about ten times higher than a severe seasonal influenza, \neven in advanced countries with highly effective health care systems.18  For people in the highest \nrisk populations, the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection can be greater than 13 percent.19  Patients \nwho do not die from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged recovery periods, including \nextensive rehabilitation from neurological damage, loss of digits, and loss of respiratory capacity.20 \n  COVID-19 Poses an Increased Risk of Serious Harm or Death in \nCorrectional Settings, Including the PDP. \n17.  People in congregate environments—places where people live, eat, and sleep in \nclose proximity—face increased danger of coronavirus infection and COVID-19, as already \nevidenced by the rapid spread of the virus in cruise ships and nursing homes.21  It is extremely \ndifficult, and at times impossible, for people who are confined in prisons, jails, and detention \ncenters to engage in the necessary social distancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of \ntransmission of the disease.22  \n                                                 \n17 House Oversight and Reform Committee Hearing on Coronavirus Response, Day 1, C-SPAN \n(March 11, 2020), https://www.c-span.org/video/?470224-1/dr-fauci-warns-congress-\ncoronavirus-outbreak-worse. \n18 How the Novel Coronavirus and the Flu are Alike...and Different, NPR (March 20, 2020), \nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/20/815408287/how-the-novel-coronavirus-\nand-the-flu-are-alike-and-different. \n19 Cohen Decl. ¶ 44. \n20  Y.

Correctional settings further increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 because of \nthe concentration of people with chronic, often untreated, illnesses in a setting with minimal levels \nof sanitation, limited access to personal hygiene, limited access to medical care, presence of many \nhigh-contact surfaces, and no possibility of staying at a distance from others.23  \n19.  Incarcerated people are dying, including a recent death of an incarcerated person at \nthe Riverside Correctional Facility (“RCF”), the women’s prison within the PDP.24  At the Chicago \nCook County Jail and at New York City Rikers Island, the transmission rates for COVID-19 are \nestimated to be the highest in the world.25  \n20.

The  higher  rate  of  COVID-19  infections  in  the  PDP  exacerbates  the \ndisproportionate impact the virus has had on people of color, both nationally and in Philadelphia.39 \nIn Philadelphia, Black people make up 44 percent of the City’s total population, yet as of February, \nover 69 percent of the incarcerated people in the PDP were Black, and almost 19 percent were \nLatinx, with racial minorities totaling over 88 percent of the incarcerated population.40 \n24.  Staff as well as incarcerated people are being infected with COVID-19.  Defendants \nhave adopted a policy of not disclosing the number of correctional officers who have tested \npositive, but as of April 16, 2020, 43 officers self-reported positive tests.41  \n25.  Risk mitigation is the only viable strategy to combat the spread of COVID-19 and \nprevent serious harm or death to class members.42  This requires creating and implementing a \ncomprehensive plan to address the spread of COVID-19 in PDP.  Given the current population \nnumbers and the housing structures within PDP, risk mitigation also requires the release of \nindividuals who are at high risk of severe disease if infected with COVID-19.43  Release of the \nmedically vulnerable population protects them from transmission of COVID-19, limits the burden \n                                                 \n39 Ryan Briggs, Nina Feldman, African Americans Lead Coronavirus Deaths In Philadelphia, \nWHYY (April 8, 2020), https://whyy.org/articles/african-americans-lead-coronavirus-deaths-in-\nphiladelphia/; see also CBS News, Philadelphia’s Black Communities Disproportionately Hit By \nCity’s Coronavirus Pandemic (April 10, 2020), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-\npandemic-philadelphia-black-communities-disproportionately-hit/. \n40 Philadelphia Jail Report: July 2016 – February 2020, \nhttps://www.phila.gov/media/20200320153910/Full-Public-Jail-Report-February-2020-1.pdf. \n41 Prisoners Being Released from City, State Prisons Are Not Being Tested for COVID-19, NBC \nPhiladelphia (April 16, 2020), https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/investigators/prisoners-being-\nreleased-from-city-state-prisons-are-not-being-tested-for-covid-19/2365885/. \n42 See Amon Decl. ¶ 60; Cohen Decl. ¶ 9. \n43 Amon Decl. ¶ 60; Cohen Decl. ¶ 43. \n  10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 11 of 24\non the region’s health care infrastructure by reducing the number of people who will become \nseriously ill from COVID-19, and facilitates other risk mitigation measures.44  \n26.  Defendants have failed to respond to and manage the continued risk of harm posed \nby the COVID-19 outbreak by not following public health guidance from the CDC for correctional \nfacilities.  The guidelines require: (a) providing all incarcerated persons a six-foot radius or more \nof  distance  from  any  other  persons,  including  during  meals,  transportation,  court  sessions, \nrecreation, counts, and all other activities; (b) instituting a safety plan to prevent a COVID-19 \noutbreak in PDP’s facilities in accordance with CDC guidelines; (c) making sanitation solutions \nreadily and freely available for the purposes of cleaning cells, dormitories, laundry, and eating \nareas, including sufficient antibacterial soap, and lifting any ban on alcohol-based hygiene supplies \n(e.g. hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes); (d) providing adequate and appropriate COVID-19 testing \nfor  incarcerated  persons,  jail  staff,  and  visitors;  (e)  waiving  all  medical  co-pays  for  those \nexperiencing  COVID-19  like  symptoms;  and  (f)  providing  sufficient  personal  protective \nequipment, particularly masks, and to all staff and incarcerated people.45  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n44 Amon Decl. ¶ 51, 60; Cohen Decl. ¶ 10, 43. \n45 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities,  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html. \n  11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 12 of 24\n  The Current Conditions of Confinement at PDP’s Facilities Fail to Comply \nwith CDC Guidelines and Exacerbate the Extreme and Imminent Danger \nFaced by Class Members of Contracting and Possibly Dying from COVID-\n19. \n27.  Defendants have failed to implement the necessary safeguards outlined above, thus \ncreating  extreme  risk  to  all  incarcerated  individuals  in  the  PDP,  and  imminent  danger  to \nPlaintiffs.46 \n28.  Defendants fail to allow for adequate social distancing consistent with all public \nhealth guidelines. \na.  The  Detention  Center  (“DC”)  contains  both  dormitory-style  housing \n(“dorms”) as well as several cellblocks.  Individuals housed in dorms sleep in bunk beds less than \n6 feet apart.  The dorms, in some circumstances, house more than 30 individuals in a unit.  One \nblock is comprised of multiple dorm units, each a cage-like structure, with only metal fencing \nseparating each unit such that air flows between each block, allowing the transmission of COVID-\n19 between units.  Social distancing is not possible in this setting.  \nb.  Many people incarcerated in PDP are double-celled.  In Curran-Fromhold \nCorrectional Facility (“CFCF”), up to four people may be housed in a quarantine cell.  Due to the \nsize of the typical PDP cell, which contains bunk beds, a toilet, a sink, and sometimes a desk, it is \ndifficult or impossible for cellmates to remain six feet apart at all times. \nc.  Phone  usage  is  vital  during  the  pandemic  for  people  to  contact  their \nattorneys as well as friends and family who are not permitted to visit.  Because of the way phones \n                                                 \n46 The named Plaintiffs have provided Declarations outlining their experiences in PDP’s \nfacilities.  See Exhibit C.  Plaintiffs’ experts’ Declarations review the concerning patterns and \ntrends identified in those Declarations.  See Amon Decl. ¶ 33; Cohen Decl. ¶ 24. \n  12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 13 of 24\nare positioned, using phones requires standing within two feet of other people for extended periods \nof time.  \n29.  Defendants have failed to adequately and consistently provide necessary hygiene \nproducts for incarcerated people in PDP.  \na.  Soap is not available for all incarcerated people at all times, especially for \nthose who cannot  buy  soap from  the  commissary.  Some  who have  requested soap  from \ncorrectional officers were told that no free soap is available.  \nb.  At least one named Plaintiff went without soap for four days.  \nc.  Plaintiffs are unable to consistently wash their hands.  \nd.  PDP does not provide any hand sanitizer to those incarcerated within their \nfacilities. \n30.  Defendants have failed to provide for adequate cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting \nof all spaces. \na.  Cleaning and disinfectant supplies are inadequate for regular and necessary \ncleaning of living areas, including cells.  PDP failed to provide plaintiffs with the bleach and \ndisinfectant necessary to clean their cells on a regular basis.  Some Plaintiffs have gone for a month \nwithout being able to clean and disinfect their cells. \nb.  People at all PDP facilities must share phones that are not disinfected \nbetween uses. \nc.  People at all PDP facilities must share showers, sinks, and toilets that are \nnot cleaned or disinfected between each use. \nd.  No toilets in PDP facilities have lids.  Many toilets fail to adequately flush, \nallowing waste matter to remain. \n  13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 14 of 24\n31.  Defendants have failed to provide and mandate the use of adequate personal \nprotective equipment. \na.  Correctional officers, and even prison medical staff, inconsistently use \nmasks and often interact with people without wearing masks.  These same correctional officers \nmove between different areas of PDP’s facilities. \nb.  Although PDP has distributed cloth face masks to incarcerated people, PDP \ndoes not clean or exchange these cloth face masks on an adequate basis, and Plaintiffs have been \nrequired to wear the same mask for multiple days or weeks.  Nor does PDP instruct people how to \nwear the masks. \n32.   Defendants have failed to provide for adequate isolation or quarantine measures.  \na.  Upon entry to the PDP, incarcerated people are placed into a “quarantine” \nunit.  This is a standard prison practice for new admissions to jail facilities at all times.  Due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the need for a quarantine unit is enhanced—and requires placement for a \nminimum of 14 days.  In PDP facilities, however, people newly admitted are not always held in \nquarantine for a full 14 days before transfer to general population. \nb.  When an incarcerated person displays symptoms of COVID-19, he or she \nis frequently neither isolated nor tested for COVID-19. \nc.  Even if someone has tested positive for COVID-19 and is taken to another \nlocation, he or she is often returned to general population without testing to ensure that COVID-\n19 is no longer present or contagious. \n33.  PDP relies on near 24-hour lockdowns. \na.  People are let out of their cells for a mere 15 minutes, occasionally once a \nday, but many PDP facilities do not let people out for days on end. \n  14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 15 of 24\nb.  In these circumstances, people are unable to bathe or shower for multiple \ndays. \nc.  For those in single or double cells, these conditions constitute solitary \nconfinement, causing and exacerbating mental illness and mental distress. \nd.  People detained in these conditions suffer serious physical harms without \nthe ability to exercise for prolonged periods of times. \ne.  With people locked in their cells for prolonged periods, access to medical \ncare for chronic conditions and acute illnesses unrelated to COVID-19 has been severely limited. \n34.  PDP’s measures have improperly interfered with the right to counsel. \na.  Given the PDP’s failure to take adequate risk mitigation measures, in-\nperson legal visits pose an unreasonable medical risk to all involved. \nb.  Further, PDP administrators have not undertaken efforts to arrange legal \ncalls between counsel and incarcerated clients, and any such efforts have resulted in a laborious \nand time-consuming process.  \n  The Named Plaintiffs are at Heightened Risk due to the Unsafe and \nInhumane Conditions of Confinement at PDP’s Facilities.  \n35.  Plaintiffs are at a heightened risk for serious illness and death due to medical \nvulnerabilities and/or age.  These risks are exacerbated—thus further increasing the risk of serious \nillness or death—because Plaintiffs are incarcerated under the conditions described above. \n36.

Because he did not have a fever, he was not tested for \nCOVID-19 and was not medically isolated. \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n46.  Plaintiffs Remick, Walker, Diaz, Alejandro, Dantzler, Hinton, Weiss, Skinner, \nAbdullah, and Bethea bring this action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \non behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals.  \n47.  Plaintiffs Remick, Walker, Diaz, Alejandro, Dantzler, Hinton, Weiss, Skinner, \nAbdullah, and Bethea seek to represent a class of all current and future detainees held in custody \nat PDP’s facilities (“Class”), including two subclasses: (1) persons who, by reason of age or \nmedical condition, are particularly vulnerable to injury or death if they were to contract COVID-\n19 (“Medically-Vulnerable Subclass”), and (2) persons who, by reason of their disability, are \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  injury  or  death  if  they  were  to  contract  COVID-19  (“Disability \nSubclass”). \n48.  The “Medically Vulnerable Subclass” is defined as all current and future persons \nin the custody of the Philadelphia Department of Prisons who are 55 or older,47 as well as all \ncurrent and future persons held of any age who have a medical condition that places them at \nincreased risk of COVID-19 illness, injury, or death, including but not limited to: (a) lung disease, \nincluding asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis or emphysema), or other \nchronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital \nheart disease, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney \ndisease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) \nepilepsy; (f) hypertension; (g) compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt \n                                                 \n47 Amon Decl. ¶ 9; Cohen Decl. ¶ 43. \n  17 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 18 of 24\nof an organ or bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune \ndisease); (h) blood disorders (including sickle cell disease); (i) inherited metabolic disorders; (j) \nhistory of stroke; (k) a developmental disability; and/or (l) a current or recent (last two weeks) \npregnancy.  All Plaintiffs represent the Medically Vulnerable Subclass. \n49.  The “Disability Subclass” is defined as all current and future persons in the custody \nof the Philadelphia Department of Prisons who have an impairment that substantially limits one or \nmore of their major life activities and who are at increased risk of COVID-19 illness, injury, or \ndeath due to their disability or any medical treatment necessary to treat their disability, including \nbut  not  limited to  those who  have: (a) lung disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis or emphysema), or other chronic conditions associated with \nimpaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, \nor coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis \npatients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) epilepsy; (f) hypertension; (g) compromised \nimmune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant, as a \nside  effect  of  medication,  or  other  autoimmune  disease);  (h)  blood  disorders  and/or  (i) \ndevelopmental disability.48  All Plaintiffs represent the Disability Subclass. \n50.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action as \nit satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements for maintaining a \nclass action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n51.  Joinder is impracticable because (1) the class members are numerous; (2) the \nclasses  include  unidentifiable  future  members;  and  (3)  the  class  members  are  incarcerated, \n                                                 \n48 The disability subclass is separate and apart from the medically vulnerable class as age, and \nsome conditions within the medically vulnerable class, such as pregnancy, are not factors that place \na person under the ambit of the ADA’s protections. \n  18 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 19 of 24\nrendering their ability to institute individual lawsuits limited, particularly in light of the court \nclosures in the City of Philadelphia. \n52.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the proposed classes: \nAll have the right to receive adequate COVID-19 prevention, testing, and treatment.  \n53.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the class because Plaintiffs and all \nclass members are injured by the same wrongful acts, omissions, policies, and practices of \nDefendants-Respondents as described in this Complaint.  Plaintiffs’ claims arise from the same \npractices, policies, and conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, and are based \non the same legal theories. \n54.  Plaintiffs Remick, Walker, Diaz, Alejandro, Dantzler, Hinton, Weiss, Skinner, \nAbdullah, and Bethea have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this action and will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  They have no interests adverse to the \ninterests of the proposed class.  They retained pro bono counsel with experience and success in \nthe prosecution of civil rights litigation.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among \nproposed class members or between counsel and proposed class members. \n55.  Defendants  have  acted  on grounds  generally applicable to  all proposed class \nmembers, and this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs therefore seek class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n56.  In  the  alternative,  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(b)(1)  are  satisfied,  because \nprosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with \nrespect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of contact for the \nparty opposing the proposed classes. \n \n  19 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 20 of 24\nV.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation of the  \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983/28 U.S.C. § 2241  \n \nClass & Medically Vulnerable Subclass versus All Defendants \n57.  Under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, corrections officials are required to \nprovide for the reasonable health and safety of persons, whether sentenced or in pretrial detention, \nand they must provide humane conditions of confinement.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 \n(1994); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315–16, 324 (1982).  Correctional officials have an \naffirmative obligation to protect persons in their custody from infectious disease.  Correctional \nofficials also have an obligation not to place persons in their custody in oppressive conditions \ninvolving  prolonged  lockdowns  and  solitary  confinement.    Officials  violate  the  rights  of \nincarcerated individuals when they are either deliberately indifferent to conditions of confinement \nthat are likely to cause them serious illness and that pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage \nto their future health, Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 (1993), or if their acts are \nobjectively unreasonable. Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2470 (2015). \n58.  PDP’s facilities, as currently operated, are unable to comply with public health \nguidelines to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19, and Defendants have not and cannot provide for \nthe  safety  of  the  Class,  nor  have  they  been  providing  humane  conditions  of  confinement. \nDefendants have not taken appropriate steps to test for, treat, or prevent COVID-19 outbreaks, and \nDefendants are unable to protect the Medically Vulnerable Subclass from serious harm caused by \nCOVID-19,  in  violation  of  their  constitutional  obligation  to  provide  humane  conditions  of \nconfinement for the Class and Medically Vulnerable Subclass. \n  20 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 21 of 24\n59.  Absent the immediate implementation of the CDC-mandated health and safety \nmeasures, further relief in the form of releases of highly vulnerable inmates will be necessary. \n60.  Defendants have violated the rights of the Class under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nViolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq \nDisability Subclass versus Defendant City of Philadelphia \n \n61.  Title  II  of  the  ADA  requires  public  entities,  such  as  PDP,  to  reasonably \naccommodate  people  with  disabilities  in  all  programs  and  services  for  which  people  with \ndisabilities are otherwise qualified. \n62.  Plaintiffs, and other members of the Class, are qualified individuals with a disability \nunder the meaning of the ADA. \n63.  Access to medical treatment and safe conditions of confinement are programs or \nservices that PDP’s facilities must provide to incarcerated people for purposes of the ADA. \n64.  Defendants  intentionally  discriminate  against  people  with  disabilities  by \nintentionally denying them reasonable accommodations in accordance with CDC guidelines and \nnecessary to protect themselves from COVID-19. \n65.  If the population is reduced to allow for adequate social distancing, reasonable \naccommodations  in  accordance  with  CDC  guidelines  are  necessary  to  protect  people  with \ndisabilities including, but not limited to: single celling, provision of cleaning supplies, access to \nsoap to facilitate handwashing, and staggered dining and recreation times in numbers that permit \nsocial distancing. \n  21 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 22 of 24\n66.  Failing to provide these reasonable accommodations is illegal discrimination under \nthe ADA entitling Plaintiffs and members of the Disability Subclass to injunctive and declaratory \nrelief. \nVI.  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n67.  Plaintiffs Thomas Remick, Nadiyah Walker, Jay Diaz, Michael Alejandro, Michael \nDantzler, Robert Hinton, Joseph Weiss, Joseph Skinner, Saddam Abdullah, and James Bethea and \nClass Members respectfully request that the Court order the following: \na.  Certification of this case as a Class Action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \nb.  Injunctive relief ordering Defendants to immediately mitigate the serious risk \nof illness, death, and harm from COVID-19 and to provide humane conditions \nof confinement to those who are incarcerated or detained in the PDP; \nc.  A preliminary injunction directing Defendants to submit a plan to the Court \nwithin five days, to be overseen by a qualified public health expert pursuant to \nFed. R. Evid. 706, which outlines specific mitigation efforts, in line with CDC \nguidelines, to significantly reduce the risk of contraction of COVID-19 by all \nClass Members;  \nd.  In the absence of immediate and effective compliance with paragraphs b and c, \ninjunctive relief and/or writs of habeas corpus requiring Defendants to: \n(i.)  Release the Medically Vulnerable Subclass Members; \n(ii.)  Provide these individuals with educational resources on COVID-19, \nincluding  instructions  that  they  should  self-isolate  for  the  CDC-\nrecommended period of time (currently 14 days) following release; \n  22 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1   Filed 04/20/20   Page 23 of 24\n(iii.)

Amon, Ph.D. MSPH \n \nI, Joseph J. Amon, declare as follows: \n \nBackground and Expertise \n1.  I am an infectious disease epidemiologist, Director of Global Health and Clinical \nProfessor in the department of Community Health and Prevention at the Drexel \nDornsife School of Public Health. I also hold an appointment as an Associate in the \ndepartment of epidemiology of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of \nPublic Health. My Ph.D. is from the Uniformed Services University of the Health \nSciences in Bethesda, Maryland and my Master of Science in Public Health \n(MSPH) degree in Tropical Medicine is from the Tulane University School of \nPublic Health and Tropical Medicine.  \n2.  Prior to my current position, I have worked for a range of non-governmental \norganizations and as an epidemiologist in the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the \nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 2010 and 2018, I was a \nVisiting Lecturer at Princeton University, teaching courses on epidemiology and \nglobal health. I currently serve on advisory boards for UNAIDS and the Global \nFund against HIV, TB and Malaria and have previously served on advisory \ncommittees for the World Health Organization.  \n3.  I have published 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and more than 100 book \nchapters, letters, commentaries and opinion articles on issues related to public \nhealth and health policy. \n4.  One of my main areas of research focus relates to infectious disease control, clinical \ncare, and obligations of government related to individuals in detention settings, in \nwhich I have published a number of reports assessing health issues in prison and \ndetention settings and more than a dozen peer-reviewed articles. In 2015-2016, I \nwas a co-editor of a special issue of the British journal, “The Lancet,” on HIV, TB \nand hepatitis in prisons. I also serve on the editorial boards of two public health \njournals. My resume is attached as Exhibit A. \nInformation on COVID-19 and Vulnerable Populations \n5.  COVID-19 is a coronavirus disease that has reached pandemic status. As of today \n(4/19), according to the World Health Organization 2,245,872 confirmed cases have \nbeen diagnosed in 213 countries or territories around the world and more than \n152,707 deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported.1 In the United States, which \nhas the highest number of reported cases in the world, 695,353 confirmed cases \nhave been reported with the disease and 32,427 people have died thus far,2 though \n                                                      \n1 See https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 accessed April 19, 2020. \n2 See https://covid19.who.int/region/amro/country/us accessed April 19, 2020 \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 20\nthese numbers likely underreport the actual infections and deaths.3 In Pennsylvania, \nas of 12:00 pm on April 18, 2020, there were 31, 069 confirmed cases and 836 \ndeaths reported by the state department of health.4 In Philadelphia alone, as of April \n17, 2020 there were a total of 8,563 cases and 298 deaths. Friday, April 17th, saw a \none-day increase in the city of 518 new cases and 24 deaths.5 Since March 6, there \nhave been 2,618 individuals hospitalized due to COVID-19, with 99% of those \ncases occurring in individuals age 25 years or older.6 There has been an exponential \nincrease in cases in Philadelphia since March 12 with the number of people infected \nincreasing, on average, by 20% every day7: \n \nNumber of Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in Philadelphia, PA\nMarch 17 - April 17, 2020\n9000\n8000\ne) 7000\nv\nti\na 6000\nul\nm\nu 5000\nC\n(\ns  4000\ne\ns\nCa 3000\nf \no\n#   2000\n1000\n0\n3/17 3/21 3/25 3/29 4/2 4/6 4/10 4/14 4/18\nDate\n \n \n6.  COVID-19 is a serious disease, ranging from no symptoms or mild ones for people \nat low risk, to respiratory failure and death. There is no vaccine to prevent COVID-\n19. There is no known cure or proven anti-viral treatment for COVID-19 at this \ntime. The specific mechanism of mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is \n                                                      \n3 See https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-deaths-from-coronavirus-top-1000-amid-incomplete-\nreporting-from-authorities-and-anguish-from-those-left-behind/2020/03/26/2c487ba2-6ad0-11ea-9923-\n57073adce27c_story.html accessed April 3, 2020.  \n4 See  https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx  accessed April 17, 2020;  \n5 See Update on COVID-19 Coronavirus Response in Philadelphia, available at \nhttps://www.facebook.com/phillyhealth/videos/2975919772519206/.(As reported by Dr. Thomas Farley, \nPhiladelphia’s Commissioner of Public Health). \n6 Ibid; https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85054b06472e4208b02285b8557f24cf accessed \nApril 17, 2020.  \n7 See http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/  accessed April 12, 2020 \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 20\nuncertain but may be related to virus-induced acute lung injury, inflammatory \nresponse, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections. \n7.  The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies individuals at highest risk to \ninclude those over 60 years of age and those with cardiovascular disease, \ndiabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.8 The WHO further states that the \nrisk of severe disease  increases with age starting from around 40 years. \n8.  The US CDC identifies “older adults [65 and older] and people of any age who have \nserious underlying medical conditions” as at higher risk of severe disease and \ndeath.9 The CDC identifies underlying medical conditions to include: blood \ndisorders, chronic kidney or liver disease, compromised immune system, endocrine \ndisorders, including diabetes, metabolic disorders, heart and lung disease \n(“including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [chronic bronchitis or \nemphysema] or other chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function”), \nneurological and neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions “[including \ndisorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle such as cerebral \npalsy, epilepsy (seizure disorders), stroke, intellectual disability…”], and current or \nrecent pregnancy.10 The CDC also identifies individuals with a body mass index \n(BMI) greater than 40 to be at higher risk for severe illness.11 According to the CDC, \nhypertension has been associated with increased illness severity and outcomes.12 \nHypertension is the most common underlying condition, either alone or in \ncombination with others, for people hospitalized for COVID-19.13 Based upon \nreports of a high proportion of ICU patients with cerebrovascular disease and \ndiabetes, some researchers have speculated that increased risk of severe illness may \nbe associated with common medicines (ACE2-stimulating drugs) prescribed for \nhypertension and diabetes.14 \n9.  Data from US COVID-19 cases published by the CDC on March 19, 2020, found \nthat hospitalization rates and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were nearly \nidentical for individuals aged 45-54 and individuals aged 55-64 (between \napproximately 20-30% for both groups for hospitalization and between 5-11% for \n                                                      \n8 See https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid- \n19. pdf?sfvrsn=1ba62e57_4 accessed March 21, 2020 \n9 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html accessed March 21, \n2020 \n10 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf accessed March \n21, 2020 \n11 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html accessed \nApril 3, 2020 \n12 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html April 14, 2020.  \n13 See https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm?s_cid=mm6915e3_w accessed April 13, 2020. \nHypertension may be an indicator of heart disease. It is a stronger indicator when coupled with high cholesterol.  \n14 See https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30116-\n8/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR2oRXHweQuw3CLmgJuAh7q556SJ83lnw4m8_G9LK8GtppeAPUtwGG1Fn9o accessed \nApril 3, 2020 \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 20\nboth groups for ICU admission).15 This suggests that individuals >45 years could be \nconsidered high risk for severe disease while those ≥54 years could be considered \nhigh risk for severe disease and death.  In a recent CDC Morbidity and Mortality \nWeekly Report, 89% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 had at least one \nunderlying health condition. The most frequently reported underlying health \nconditions included hypertension (50%), obesity (48%), chronic metabolic disease, \nincluding diabetes (36%), chronic lung disease, including asthma and COPD (35%), \ncardiovascular disease (28%), neurological disease (14%), renal disease (13%), \nimmunosuppressive conditions (10%), and gastrointestinal and liver disease (7%).16 \nWhile these findings do not demonstrate causality, the association of these \nconditions with individuals with severe illness is broadly consistent with other \nknowledge of the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and other types of \ncoronaviruses. \n \nHealth profile of plaintiffs \n \n10. I have reviewed the declarations of the following individuals: Michael Alejandro, \nJoseph Skinner, Robert Hinton, Joseph Weiss, Jay Diaz (birth-name Jessica Garcia), \nThomas Remick, Michael Dantzler, James Bethea, Saddam Abdullah, and Nadiyah \nWalker. \n \n11. Michael Alejandro is a 27-year-old man held at the Detention Center in Philadelphia \nwho reports having asthma. This condition puts him at increased risk for severe \nsymptoms and death from COVID-19 if infected. \n \n12. Joseph Skinner is 38-year-old man currently held at Curran Fromhold Correctional \nFacility (CFCF) facility in Philadelphia. Mr. Skinner reports having asthma, which in \nthe past required hospitalization and intubation. This condition puts him at increased \nrisk for severe symptoms and death from COVID-19 if infected. \n \n13. Robert Hinton is a 63-year-old man held at CFCF. He reports having hepatitis C \nwhich previously caused damage to his liver. His age and medical condition puts him \nat increased risk for severe symptoms and death from COVID-19 if infected. \n \n14. Joseph Weiss is a 57-year-old man held at CFCF. His age puts him at increased risk \nfor severe symptoms and may put him at increased risk of death from COVID if \ninfected. \n \n15. Jay Diaz is a 30-year-old individual, held at Riverside Correctional Facility.  He \nreports having asthma and stage 3 cervical and ovarian cancer. His medical \nconditions puts him at increased risk for severe symptoms and death from COVID-19 \n                                                      \n15 See https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm, accessed March 21, 2020 \n16 See https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm, accessed April 19, 2020. \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 6 of 20\nif infected. \n \n16. Thomas Remick is a 30-year-old man, held at the Detention Center. He reports being \ndiagnosed with aggressive sarcoma. His medical condition puts him at increased risk \nfor severe symptoms and death from COVID-19 if infected. \n \n17. Michael Dantzler is a 45-year-old man, held in the medical unit at the Detention \nCenter. He reports having a vascular disease that makes him prone to blood clots and \nreports undergoing emergency surgery on February 20, 2020 to remove a pulmonary \nembolism, during that operation the doctor lacerated his kidney, and he must receive \nperiodic imaging and medication to ensure the kidney heals properly. His medical \nconditions put him at increased risk for severe symptoms and death from COVID-19 \nif infected. \n \n18. James Bethea is a 53-year-old man held at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional \nCenter (PICC). He reports having asthma, being a regular smoker, having diabetes, \nand a prior diagnosis of hepatitis C. In addition, he reports suffering from \nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder. His medical condition puts him at increased risk \nfor severe symptoms and death from COVID-19 if infected. \n \n19. Saddam Abdullah is a 29-year-old man held at PICC. He reports having severe \nasthma. His medical condition puts him at increased risk for severe symptoms and \ndeath from COVID-19 if infected. He also reports having symptoms consistent with \nthose of COVID-19, including difficulty breathing, chills, and loss of smell and taste. \nHe reports that despite being examined by medical staff, he was neither tested for \nCOVID-19 or isolated from other patients and treated as a “suspect case”. If detention \nstaff do not take immediate steps to isolate individuals reporting these types of \nsymptoms, with or without accompanying fever, they are putting at risk everyone \nwho comes in close contact (as defined by CDC as within six feet) with such \nindividuals.  \n \n20. Nadiyah Walker is a 43-year-old woman held at RCF. She reports having epilepsy, \ndiabetes, and asthma. Her medical condition puts her at increased risk for severe \nsymptoms and death from COVID-19 if infected.  \n \nUnderstanding of COVID-19 Transmission \n \n21. According to the US CDC, the disease is transmitted mainly between people who are \nin close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets \nproduced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.17 It may be possible that a \nperson can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and \nthen touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to \n                                                      \n17 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html accessed March 21, 2020 \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 20\nbe the main way the virus spreads.18 New data examining the potential for air and \nsurface contamination, conducted in a hospital setting, suggests that the transmission \ndistance of COVID-19 may extend to 4 meters or about 13 feet.19 This same study \nfound that half the samples taken from the soles of the shoes of hospital staff were \npositive for SARS-CoV-2 virus.  \n22. People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the \nsickest), however there is increasing evidence of asymptomatic20 and presymptomatic \ntransmission, and there remain unclear dynamics around “super spreader” events \nwhere large numbers of people become infected from one source. Speech and other \nvocal activities such as shouting or singing have been shown to generate air particles \nwhich could transmit the virus responsible for COVID-19, with the rate of emission \ncorresponding to voice loudness. News outlets have reported that during a choir \npractice in Washington on March 10, presymptomatic transmission likely played a \nrole in SARS-CoV-2 transmission to approximately 40 of 60 choir members.21 A \nrecent report by the CDC of presymptomatic transmission in Singapore identified \nseven clusters of COVID-19 in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred, \naccounting for 6.4% of locally acquired cases examined.22 These findings are similar \nto research outside of Hubei province, China, which found that 12.6% of \ntransmissions could have occurred before symptom onset in the source patient.23 In a \nrecent report from a Boston homeless shelter, of 397 people tested, 146 (37%) tested \npositive for the coronavirus. All reported no symptoms.24 In some studies, up to half \nof individuals testing positive for the coronavirus reported no or mild symptoms.25 \nWhile the degree of asymptomatic transmission remains uncertain, a CDC MMWR \nstated that, “Because persons with asymptomatic and mild disease…are likely playing \na role in transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the community, social distancing \nand everyday preventive behaviors are recommended for persons of all ages to slow \nthe spread of the virus, protect the health care system from being overloaded, and \nprotect older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical \nconditions.”26  \n                                                      \n18 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html accessed March 21, 2020 \n19 See https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article accessed April 13, 2020/  \n20 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html accessed March 21, 2020; See also: Bai Y, Yao L, \nWei T, et al.

The understanding of direct transmission as the most likely means of SARS-\nCoV-2 coronavirus transmission combined with evidence of asymptomatic and \npresymptomatic transmission suggests that, while hand washing and disinfecting \nsurfaces is advisable, the main strategy for limiting disease transmission is social \ndistancing and that for such distancing to be effective it must occur before \nindividuals display symptoms.  \n24. Because of the risk of airborne spread, the CDC now recommends that everyone who \nis coming into contact with the air that others may breathe covers their face, though \nthe CDC recognizes that a face covering is not a substitute for social distancing.27 On \nApril 16, 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Health called for everyone to wear \nmasks in public spaces. The CDC guidance recommends washing these masks after \nuse. The CDC further recommends that individuals not to touch their eyes, nose, and \nmouth when removing their face covering and, after removal, immediately wash their \nhands.28 \n25. Recognizing the importance of social distancing, public health officials have \nrecommended extraordinary measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. Schools, \ncourts, collegiate and professional sports, theater and other congregate settings have \nbeen closed as part of risk mitigation strategy. 50 states, 7 territories, and the District \nof Columbia have taken some type of formal executive action in response to the \nCOVID-19 outbreak.29 Through one form or another, these jurisdictions have \ndeclared, proclaimed, or ordered a state of emergency, public health emergency, or \nother preparedness and response activity for the outbreak. Earlier this month \nPennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, declared a state of emergency, which he \nbuttressed on March 19 with an order closing non-essential businesses.30 On April 1, \nGovernor Wolf extended county-by-county stay at home orders to cover the entire \nstate of Pennsylvania.31 These kinds of orders are quickly spreading nationwide, after \nbeginning in California on March 19. As of April 7, at least 316 million people in at \nleast 42 states, 3 counties, 9 cities, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico are \nbeing directed to stay home.32 \n26. These public health measures aim to “flatten the curve” of the rates of infection so \nthat those most vulnerable to serious complications from infection will be least likely \nto be exposed and, if they are the numbers of infected individuals will be low enough \nthat medical facilities will have enough beds, masks, and ventilators for those who \nneed them. \n                                                      \n27 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html \n28 See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html \n29 See https://www.astho.org/COVID-19/ accessed March 21, 2020 \n30 See https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20200319-TWW-COVID-19-business-closure- \norder.pdf \n31See  https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-sec-of-health-pennsylvania-on-statewide-stay-\nat-home-order-beginning-at-8-pm-tonight-most-prudent-option-to-stop-the-spread/ accessed April 2, \n2020.  \n32 See https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html accessed April 14, 2020. \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 9 of 20\n27. US cities are starting to see the level of COVID-19 cases seen in previous global \nhotspots. On Thursday, March 26, Governor Cuomo announced that 100 people had \ndied of the coronavirus between Wednesday and Thursday morning. 33 As of Friday, \nMarch 27, the cumulative death toll in the state stood at 450.34 In response, the city’s \nhealth commissioner again urged all New Yorkers to follow the stay at home order, \nemphasizing the impact on the city’s already strained health system.35 As of April 18, \n2020, New York City’s death toll had reached 12,712.36 Pennsylvania is roughly 10 \ndays behind New York City, following a similar trendline of cases and deaths.37  \n \nRisk of COVID-19 in Jail Facilities \n \n28. The conditions of jail facilities pose a heightened public health risk to the spread of \nCOVID-19, even greater than other non-carceral institutions. \n29. Jails are enclosed environments. These kinds of enclosed environments, like cruise \nships and nursing homes, have seen higher rates of COVID-19 infection than the \ngeneral population.  Jails have even greater risk of COVID-19 transmission than other \nenclosed environments because of crowding within the facility, limited access to \nhygiene, and structural limitations. People in jails are housed in crowded spaces of \nlimited size and are subjected to security measures that force them into close contact \nwith guards. They cannot practice the “social distancing” necessary to effectively \nprevent the spread of COVID-19. Bathrooms facilities—toilets, showers, and sinks— \nphones, and other common areas are shared, without adequate surface disinfection \nbetween users. Food preparation and distribution without proper precautions also \npresents a further site for the virus to spread. Infectious spread presents a particular \nchallenge in these facilities where the population often is disproportionately \nvulnerable, while facilities provide limited medical care.38 \n30. CDC guidance on correctional and detention facilities,39 posted March 23, 2020, \nspecifically recommends implementing social distancing strategies to increase the \n                                                      \n33 See https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/coronavirus-\nnews.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-\ncoronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storyline_menu?action=click&pgtype=Article&st\nate=default&module=styln-coronavirus&variant=show&region=TOP_BANNER&context=storyline_menu#link-\n18cce12f accessed March 26, 2020. \n34 https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/another-84-people-killed-by-coronavirus-in-new-york-city/ accessed March 28, \n2020.  \n35 See https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/de-blasio-warns-half-of-all-new-yorkers-will-get-covid-19/ accessed March \n26, 2020.  \n36 See https://nypost.com/2020/04/18/nyc-coronavirus-deaths-near-13000-but-daily-toll-is-going-down/ accessed \nApril 19, 2020. \n37 See https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-coronavirus-cases-over-time-chart-2020-3 accessed March \n26, 2020.  \n38 https://www.prisonpolicy.org/health.html accessed March 26, 2020. \n39 See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional- \ndetention.html accessed March 23, 2020 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 10 of 20\nphysical space between incarcerated/detained persons “ideally 6 feet between all \nindividuals, regardless of the presence of symptoms” including: 1) increased space \nbetween individuals in holding cells, as well as in lines and waiting areas such as \nintake; stagger time in recreation spaces; restrict recreation space usage to a single \nhousing unit per space; stagger meals; rearrange seating in the dining hall so that \nthere is more space between individuals (e.g., remove every other chair and use only \none side of the table); provide meals inside housing units or cells; limit the size of \ngroup activities; reassign bunks to provide more space between individuals, ideally 6 \nfeet or more in all directions. \n31. The CDC guidance also describes necessary disinfection procedures including to \nthoroughly clean and disinfect all areas where a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 \ncase spent time.40 \n32. The CDC guidance also recommends that correctional facilities provide a no-cost \nsupply of soap, preferably liquid soap, sufficient to allow frequent hand washing. \n33. Based upon the declarations I reviewed (paragraph 10 above), the Philadelphia \nDepartment of Prisons (PDP) does not appear to be adopting the procedures necessary \nto prevent COVID-19 transmission. The physical infrastructure and routine practice \nof Philadelphia jails raise significant challenges to maintaining distancing between \ndetainees and preventative hygiene by those within the facilities.  These challenges, \nwhich are typical of most detention centers, include \na)  People housed in PDP facilities either live in a dormitory setting (such as \nthose described by plaintiffs housed in the Detention Center where \napproximately 30 men live in the same room and sleep within 6 feet of each \nother) or are routinely double-celled. People at all PDP facilities share \nshowers, sinks and toilets. In addition, large groups of people share the same \nphones. Using the phones requires standing within two feet of other people \nfor extended periods. As a result, no one held within PDP facilities can \npractice social distancing to the extent required by CDC necessary to prevent \nthe spread of COVID-19.   \nb)  Access to soap is limited, with many people in the PDP going days without \nthe use of soap to wash their hands. Nor does PDP provide hand sanitizer to \nthose incarcerated with its facilities. \nc)  Correctional officers inconsistently use masks and often interact with \nincarcerated people without masks.   \nd)  Though PDP distributed cloth-face-coverings to incarcerated people, people \nin PDP facilities are not able to clean or wash their face coverings.  Nor did \nPDP provide people with additional coverings to allow for alternating and \ncleaning their masks. \n                                                      \n40 Ibid \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 11 of 20\ne)  Facilities used by multiple people, including toilets, showers, and telephones \nare not cleaned or disinfected on a regular basis. \nf)  People incarcerated within PDP have no regular access to cleaning materials \nto clean and disinfect their cells or living quarters. \ng)  PDP has adopted inconsistent practices for quarantining people newly \nadmitted to PDP facilities. \nh)  People who display symptoms of COVID-19 within the facilities have not \nbeen tested or isolated from others and remain in general population. PDP \nmedical staff appear not to be testing all people who exhibit symptoms of \nCOVID-19.  \ni)  As is true in detention facilities generally, communal bathroom facilities \npose a risk of transmission and it is not usually possible for an incarcerated \nperson to move throughout PDP without coming into contact with many \nother people.  \nj)  Access to medical care is inadequate at PDP. There are delays in \nindividuals’ ability to access care. \n34. Based upon the information provided to me, and my prior knowledge of detention \nfacilities, I am concerned that the Philadelphia Department of Prisons does not have \nthe ability to implement the critically important principle of social distancing, such as \nmaintaining six feet of separation at all times between detainees, including at meals \nand with the location of beds. Where detention facilities house detained individuals in \ndormitory style arrangements or small cells where they are crowded and bunked \ntogether and must share phones, bathrooms, and showers, these facilities will not be \nable to prevent or slow COVID-19 transmission.  \n35. Nor am I aware of the necessary measures being taken at the PDP to identify and \nproperly quarantine individuals at high risk, those with potential exposure  to \nsuspected or confirmed cases or to isolate those with symptoms consistent with \nCOVID-19. These steps are essential to preventing transmission of COVID-19.  \n36. Introduction of new people into detention facilities who have had contact with the \ncommunity outside the facility—be it correctional officers and other staff, new \nindividuals coming into custody, people on work release, or individuals serving \nintermediate sentences—creates a link from transmission occurring in the community \nto those who are detained. The possibility of asymptomatic transmission means that \nmonitoring fever of staff or detainees is inadequate for identifying all who may be \ninfected and preventing transmission. This is also true because not all individuals \ninfected with COVID-19 report fever in early stages of infection.  \n37. The alternative is to test all staff and detainees entering the facility. However, this \nwould require frequent (daily) tests, implemented at multiple times a day as staff and \ndetainees entered the facility. In addition to the cost and labor required to implement \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 12 of 20\nthis approach, the United States is currently facing a shortage of COVID-19 tests that \nmake such a solution impracticable: In a survey of U.S. cities (that included \nPhiladelphia, Pittsburgh, Erie, and Easton), 92.1% of cities reported that they do not \nhave an adequate supply of test kits.41 Shortages are likely to become more severe \nover the next three to four weeks when there will be a major shortage of chemical \nreagents for COVID-19 testing and enormous increases in demand.42  Given the \nshortage of COVID-19 testing in the United States, it is likely that jails are and will \ncontinue to be unable to conduct aggressive, widespread testing to identify all \npositive cases of COVID-19. The lack of widespread testing in communities and the \ncurrent presence of COVID-19 in all 50 states means that it is impractical to ask \ndetainees about their travel history– all communities should be assumed to have \ncommunity transmission which is why statewide and national restrictions on \nmovement and gatherings have been put in place.  \n \nHeightened Rates of COVID-19 Infection and Spread Within Detention Facilities \n38. The rates of spread in the facilities that have been testing for COVID-19 illustrates \nthe dangers the conditions in these facilities pose to those who are detained there, and \nto the broader community. In Cook County Jail, Chicago in a matter of two days, the \nnumber of individuals infected jumped from 38 inmates43 to 89 inmates and 12 staff \nmembers.44 As of April 1, there were 167 confirmed cases among detained \nindividuals, even after the jail released 400 individuals.45 At Rikers Island in New \nYork, on Saturday March 21, a jail oversight agency indicated that 21 inmates and 17 \nemployees tested positive.46 Four days later, on Wednesday, March 26, 75 inmates \nand 37 employees tested positive.47 As of Tuesday, March 31, 141 staff and 180 \nindividuals in custody had tested positive at Rikers and city jails in New York City.48 \nThe Legal Aid Society in New York recently reported that the infection rate for \nCOVID-19 at local jails is more than seven times higher than the rate citywide \nand 87 times higher than the country at large.49   \n39. On Friday, March 27, 2020, the first incarcerated person in PDP tested positive for \nCOVID-19.50 Since that time, the number of infections within Philadelphia’s jails has \n                                                      \n41 https://www.usmayors.org/issues/covid-19/equipment-survey/ accessed March 28, 2020. \n42 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html accessed March 28, \n2020. \n43 See https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/cook-county-jail-says-17-inmates-have-tested-positive-for-\ncoronavirus/2244652/ accessed March 26, 2020. \n44 See https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/29/federal-prison-first-coronavirus-death-153387 accessed March \n29, 2020.  \n45 See https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/167-cook-county-jail-detainees-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19-\nofficials-say/2248892/ accessed April 2, 2020.  \n46 https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/21-inmates-17-employees-test-positive-for-covid-19-on-rikers-\nisland-officials/2338242/ accessed March 23, 2020.  \n47 See https://nypost.com/2020/03/25/new-coronavirus-cases-in-nyc-jails-outpacing-rest-of-the-city/ accessed March \n26, 2020 \n48 See https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-coronavirus-public-health-disaster \naccessed April 2, 2020.   \n49 See: https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-rikers-island/ accessed March 26, 2020 \n50 https://www.phila.gov/2020-03-27-city-provides-update-on-covid-19-for-friday-march-27-2020/ \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 13 of 20\nrisen exponentially. Over the past week, each day between 1 and 13 new people test \npositive for the virus within PDP. On April Thursday 16, 2020, the City reported \napproximately a total 100 of incarcerated people tested positive for the virus within \nPDP.51 On Friday, Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Thomas Farley reported 13 \nadditional new cases incarcerated people with the virus within PDP.52  \n40. On April 14, 2020 a woman in her forties held at Riverside Correctional Facility, was \nthe first incarcerated person to die as a result of COVID19.53 It was reported that she \nhad underlying medical conditions but the city government did not specify what \nconditions she had.  \n41. In addition to the incarcerated people, the rate of infection among correctional \nofficers has risen exponentially. Although PDP’s Commissioner, Blanche Carney, \ndeclined to report the total number of correctional employees who contracted the \nvirus, the prison’s labor union business agent, Eric Hill informed reporters that as of \nTuesday, April 14th, 43 officers tested positive. Hill warned this was only a self-\nreported number and the true number of prison employees who contracted the virus \ncould be higher.54  \n42. The data above confirms high rates of infection among correctional officers and other \nstaff. These individuals all face an increased risk of COVID-19 exposure as they are \nless able to practice the recommended strategy of social distancing in carrying out \ntheir official duties. If corrections officers are significantly affected by COVID-19, \nwhether through being infected, exposed by detainees, their fellow officers or in the \ncommunity, large numbers will be unavailable to work due to self-quarantine or \nisolation, at the same time that large numbers of detainees who are potentially \nexposed will need to be put into individual isolation or transferred to advanced \nmedical care, putting tremendous stress on detention facilities. \nInfrastructure in Detention Facilities Will Likely Be Insufficient to Address Needs of \nCOVID-19 Patients  \n43. Once COVID-19 enters into detention facilities, these facilities will likely be unable \nto address the infectious spread and the needs of infected individuals due to lack of \ntesting and insufficient physical and medical infrastructure.   \n44. In cases where there are confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, the CDC \nrecommends medical isolation, defined by the CDC confining the case “ideally to a \nsingle cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes” to prevent contact with others \n                                                      \n51 Philadelphia’s Managing Director Brian Abernathy provided this information during Mayor Kenney’s April 16th, \n2020 press conference at approximately the 25 minute mark.

Individuals in isolation should also be provided \ntheir own bathroom space.55  \n45. Individuals in close contact of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case - defined by \nthe CDC as having been within approximately 6 feet of the individual for a prolonged \nperiod of time or having had direct contact with secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., \nhave been coughed on) – should be quarantined for a period of 14 days. The same \nprecautions should be taken for housing someone in quarantine as for someone who is \na confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case put in isolation.56  \n46. The CDC guidance recognizes that housing detainees in isolation and quarantine \nindividually, while “preferred”, may not be feasible in all county jail settings and \ndiscusses the practice of “cohorting” when individual space is limited. The term \n“cohorting” refers to the practice of isolating multiple laboratory-confirmed COVID-\n19 cases together as a group or quarantining close contacts of a particular case \ntogether as a group. The guidance states specifically that \"Cohorting should only be \npracticed if there are no other available options” and exhorts correctional officials: \n“Do not cohort confirmed cases with suspected cases or case contacts.” [emphasis \nin original]. Individuals who are close contacts of different cases should also not be \nkept together. \n47. The CDC guidance also says that detention facilities should “Ensure that cohorted \ncases wear face masks at all times.”57 This is critical because not all close contacts \nmay be infected and those not infected must be protected from those who are if \nindividuals are cohorted. In a survey of United States cities, 91.5% of the cities \nreported that they do not have an adequate supply of face masks for their first \nresponders and medical personnel.58 There are also widespread shortages of personal \nprotective equipment — particularly N-95 masks — sufficient to provide even for \nhealth care workers, in our nation’s hospitals, let alone medical providers and other \nindividuals coming into contact with the virus in county jails .59 Many public health \nleaders are calling for masks to be reserved for health care staff, who face increased \nrisk and are vitally needed to sustain emergency care. Hospitals in the New York City \narea, unable to access masks locally, are reportedly turning to a private distributor to \nairlift millions of protective masks out of China.60  \n48. Cloth face masks, like the ones provided to those within PDP, are not considered by \nthe Pennsylvania Health department as personal protective equipment.61 However, the \n                                                      \n55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid \n57 Ibid \n58 https://www.usmayors.org/issues/covid-19/equipment-survey/ accessed March 28, 2020.  \n59 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-testing-shortages.html accessed \nMarch 28, 2020. \n60 See: https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/hospital-suppliers-take-to-the-skies-to-combat-dire-\nshortages/article_0830ffb0-6f89-11ea-89ed-bbd859186614.html    accessed March 26, 2020 \n61 https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/ \nHomemade%20Mask%20Guidance.pdf \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 15 of 20\nhealth department recognizes that homemade masks can be an effective complement \nto handwashing, social-distancing and other mitigation measures. Nonetheless, they \nare effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with \nalcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. To properly clean and sanitize masks, \naccording to the CDC, they should be washed with a washing machine.62 Detainees \nshould be instructed in how to properly put on and take off masks, including cleaning \ntheir hands every time they touch the mask, covering the mouth and nose with the \nmask and making sure there are no gaps, avoiding touching the mask while using it; \nand replacing the mask with a new one if it becomes damp (e.g., from sneezing) and \nnot to re-use single-use masks. For those wearing the cloth masks on a continuous \nbasis, the masks should be replaced and washed daily. There are times when \ndetainees will necessarily not be able to wear masks, if available. For example, during \nmeals. In these instances, detainees should eat individually or with proper distancing \nfrom others. \n49. Where individual rooms are not available, the CDC guidance describes a hierarchy of \nnext best options for cohorting, which in order from lesser risk to greater risk includes \nhousing individuals under medical isolation: 1) in a large, well-ventilated cell with \nsolid walls and a solid door that closes fully; 2) in a large, well-ventilated cell with \nsolid walls but without a solid door; 3) in single cells without solid walls or solid \ndoors (i.e., cells enclosed entirely with bars), preferably with an empty cell between \noccupied cells; 4) in multi-person cells without solid walls or solid doors (i.e., cells \nenclosed entirely with bars), preferably with an empty cell between occupied cells.63 \n50. Many jails and prisons also lack adequate medical care infrastructure to address the \nspread of infectious disease and treatment of high-risk people in detention. As \nexamples, jails often use practical nurses who practice beyond the scope of their \nlicenses; have part-time physicians who have limited availability to be on-site; and \nfacilities with no formal linkages with local health departments or hospitals. \n51. According to Commissioner of Health Dr. Thomas Farley, as of April 17, 2020, 33% \nof Philadelphia’s hospital beds and ICU beds were still available.64 In other public \ndata, as of April 19, 2020 the City of Philadelphia reports having only 252 remaining \nICU beds available.65 Large numbers of ill detainees and corrections staff will strain \nPhiladelphia’s medical infrastructure. If infection spreads throughout Philadelphia’s \njails, overwhelming the facilities own limited resources, the burden of caring for these \nindividuals will shift to local medical facilities. The few facilities will likely not be \nable to provide care to all infected individuals with serious cases, increasing the \nlikelihood that these individuals will die.66  \n                                                      \n62 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html \n63 Ibid \n64 See Update on COVID-19 Coronavirus Response in Philadelphia, available at \nhttps://www.facebook.com/phillyhealth/videos/2975919772519206/. \n65 See https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85054b06472e4208b02285b8557f24cf (accessed \nApril 19, 2020). \n66 See https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/20/Rural-counties-in-Pennsylvania-struggle-on-their-\nown-as-COVID-19-spreads/stories/202003180034 accessed March 23, 2002. Even in regions with highly developed \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 16 of 20\nExisting Protocols Will Not Prevent Introduction of COVID-19 \n52. I have reviewed the PDP Response to COVID-1967 released on April 13, 2020 and \nPDP’s COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions.  \n53. Based on my training and decades of professional experience in public health, the \nprocedures described therein are entirely inadequate to prevent or mitigate the rapid \ntransmission of COVID-19 in Philadelphia’s jails. I am unaware of any \nepidemiologist or any public health expert who would consider these procedures to be \nsufficient preventive measures. The protocols do not sufficiently implement any of \nthe preventative measures outlined below. The lack of specific attention to date in \nPDP’s guidance on COVID-19 indicates that they do not plan to establish special \nprotections for high-risk patients, instead waiting for them to become symptomatic. \nThis will lead to unnecessary illness and death for the people most vulnerable to this \ndisease.  \n54. Social distancing: Although PDP recognizes that social distancing is an important \npreventive measure, its guidance remains woefully inadequate. The PDP Response to \nCOVID-19 document refers to inmate social distancing only in the context of \nofficial/legal visits. Nothing is stated in reference to how social distancing among \ninmates will be carried out.  \na)  The PDP protocol notes that inmates will be “housed shelter-in-place” and only \nhave limited movement outside of their cells for showers and phone calls. The \nProtocol further notes “to allow for increased social distancing” certain staff will \nbe working on a rotational basis, one week on and one week off.  The protocol \nonly notes that “social distancing” will occur during official and legal visits. \nWhile PDP correctly recognizes the importance of social distancing, these \nsuggested steps fall woefully short of what is necessary to prevent transmission \nof COVID-19 and say nothing about crowding in housing units.  \nb)  While the prison population has declined approximately 13 percent in the last \nmonth,68 this population decrease provides no indication that to believe that \nsocial distancing within dormitories and cells will be possible when the facilities \nare operating at close to normal capacity. To the contrary, according to two of \nthe plaintiffs, when the population of jails increase, staff consolidate the \nremaining people into limited sections of the units. The plaintiffs report most \npeople remain double-celled. Nor is there any indication that social distancing \nwill be possible where bathrooms and phones are shared by many individuals.  \nc)  Nor has PDP made any functional attempt to improve social distancing within \nthe facilities. No Plaintiffs reported beds moved to accommodate more space \n                                                                                                                                                                           \nhealth systems, COVID-19 is straining ability to care, creating cause for alarm for less-equipped health care systems \nin regions that do not act to mitigate risk of infection.

Screening Measures: PDP’s protocols do not address how the facilities will account \nfor the large number of people who have already been exposed to COVID-19. This \nincludes not only new detainees, but also staff, vendors and other individuals who go \nin and out of detention facilities. Screening measures will not be sufficient to identify \ninfected individuals who come into PDP facilities because of presymptomatic and \nasymptomatic transmission and community spread, which make temperature checks \ninsufficient. Facilities would also need increased physical space to isolate those who \nmay be infected upon entry.  \na)  The FAQ states that “Before entry, every employee/vendor/attorney/etc. will \nbe screened at each point of entry, every time he/she enters a PDP facility. \nWhen entering a PDP facility, employees will be asked to tell medical \npersonnel if they have a fever, dry cough or shortness of breath- the \nsignificant symptoms of COVID-19.” These are “significant symptoms” of \nCOVID-19 but individuals with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or \npresymptomatic and other symptoms are also associated with COVID-19. \nThe FAQ goes on to state that employees, attorneys, and non-PDP City staff \nwill not be permitted entry if they are symptomatic. Again, this is \ninsufficient. At a minimum, staff and vendors answering affirmative to any \nof the following questions should be told to isolate or quarantine themselves \nand seek medical clearance before returning to work: \n  Have you experienced any symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, shortness \nof breath, sore throat, cough, temperature, loss of smell, loss of taste, \nmyalgia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea) since your last screening? \n  Have you had any close contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-\n19? \n  Have you had any close contact with anyone displaying symptoms of \nCOVID-19 (shortness of breath, cough, temperature, loss of smell, loss \nof taste, fatigue, sore throat, myalgia, nausea, and diarrhea)? \n  Have you been in close contact with anyone who has been told to self-\nquarantine themselves? \n \nb)  PDP Protocol states that newly admitted people will be quarantined for 14 \ndays and kept separate from the general population until cleared. \nIndividuals are quarantined in cohorts (groups), however they are not given \nmasks upon entering quarantine, are unable to maintain social distancing, \nand do not have consistent access to soap and disinfecting agents. \nMoreover, one plaintiff reported being transferred into general population \nwithin a couple days after sharing a cell with someone exhibiting COVID \nsymptoms, violating the basic purpose of quarantine. It is difficult to \nmanage the quarantining of all new intakes as each cohort must be \nquarantined for 14 days without admitting anyone new. If a new person is \nadded to the cohort the period of quarantine must restart.   \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 18 of 20\n56. Isolation: The CDC recommends medical isolation of confirmed or suspected cases. \nA range of strategies are presented for isolation depending upon the infrastructure of \nthe facility, however what is recommended as the most effective approach is \nconfining confirmed and suspected cases individually “to a single cell with solid \nwalls and a solid door that closes” to prevent contact with others and to reduce the \nrisk of transmission. Individuals in isolation should also be provided their own \nbathroom space.69  \na)  PDP protocol notes that “inmate exhibiting symptoms or self-reporting \nexposure will be removed from the standard intake quarantine area and \nhoused separate on another facility or campus for presumed or possible \ncases.” The PDP protocol does not require isolation of confirmed or \nsuspected cases, the protocol only that “housing units” may be isolated and \nthose people who require COVID-19 assessment may be together in a \nfacility with 100 beds. Such protocols will do nothing to mitigate the spread \nof this virus. \nb)  Moreover, several plaintiffs reporting seeing or hearing multiple people on \ntheir unit who displayed symptoms of the virus. These symptomatic people \nremained on their unit in general population and in close proximity to others. \nPlaintiff Saddam Abdullah reports experiencing symptoms consistent with \nCOVID-19 for over one week, yet the staff has not acted to test or isolate \nMr. Abdullah from the rest of the men incarcerated in PICC. Allowing these \nsymptomatic individuals to remain in general population endangers the \nhealth and safety of all those inside PDP facilities. \nc)  The PDP protocol in general lacks a clear understanding of the difference \nbetween isolation and quarantine. Medical isolation refers to confining a \nconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 case to prevent contact with others and to \nreduce the risk of transmission. Quarantine involves separating and \nrestricting the movement of people who were close contacts of an individual \nwho is sick with a contagious disease. The document refers to isolation, \n“quarantine” and “self-quarantine” only briefly and inappropriately. \n \n57. Failure to Comply with Its Own Protocol: Even where PDP states that it is \naddressing this source of infection, discrepancies between the stated policies and the \ndeclarations of the plaintiffs provide a basis for concerns that ideal response plans are \nnot being implemented. \na)  PDP states that staff will supply inmates with cleaning products and soap. \nPlaintiffs report not receiving either cleaning supplies or hand sanitizer or \neven a sufficient amount of soap to allow for hand cleaning. The lack of \nsoap is such that several plaintiffs report being without soap for days. \nMoreover, all plaintiffs report that in order to obtain sufficient soap they \nmust have access to money and purchase it from the commissary.  \nb)  Moreover, as noted above, it does not appear that PDP is following it’s own \nprotocol when it comes to quarantining those coming into the prison or even \ntesting and isolating symptomatic individuals. \n                                                      \n69 Ibid. \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 19 of 20\n58. PPE: The CDC recognizes that masks are not a substitute for social distancing. \nTherefore, even when masks are worn, it is still important for facilities to practice \nsocial distancing. This is especially true where the masks are only cloth masks, not \nthe medical grade N-95 masks that are being used in hospitals to prevent spread of \nCOVID-19 between workers who come into close contact with the virus.  \na)  Plaintiffs report receiving one cloth-face-coverings per person, they have \nno ability to wash or clean these coverings and no ability to receive new \nmasks. They report wearing the same mask without interruption for days or \nweeks. The distribution of one face-covering to each incarcerated person \nwithout providing a concomitant ability for the person to wash that \ncovering will do nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus. \n \n \nConclusions \n \n59. CDC guidance on correctional and detention facilities,70 posted March 23, 2020 \nreiterates many of the points previously made in this declaration, including: 1) \nIncarcerated/detained persons are at “heightened” risk for COVID-19 infection once the \nvirus is introduced; 2) There are many opportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced \ninto a correctional or detention facility, including from staff and transfer of \nincarcerated/detained persons; 3) Options for medical isolation of COVID-19 cases are \nlimited; 4) Incarcerated/detained persons and staff may have medical conditions that \nincrease their risk of severe disease from COVID-19; 5) The ability of \nincarcerated/detained persons to exercise disease prevention measures (e.g., frequent \nhandwashing) may be limited and many facilities restrict access to soap and paper \ntowels and prohibit alcohol-based hand sanitizer and many disinfectants; and 6) \nIncarcerated persons may hesitate to report symptoms of COVID-19 or seek medical \ncare due to co-pay requirements and fear of isolation.  \n \n60. The only viable public health strategy available is risk mitigation. Even with the best-\nlaid plans to address the spread of COVID-19 in detention facilities, the release of \nindividuals who can be considered at high-risk of severe disease if infected with \nCOVID-19 is a key part of a risk mitigation strategy. In my opinion, the public health \nrecommendation is to release high-risk people from detention, given the heightened \nrisks to their health and safety, especially given the lack of a viable vaccine for \nprevention or effective treatment at this stage.  \n \n61. To the extent that vulnerable detainees have had exposure to known cases with \nlaboratory-confirmed infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, they should be \ntested immediately in concert with the local health department. Those who test negative \nshould be released to home quarantine for 14 days. Where there is not a suitable location \nfor home quarantine available, these individuals could be released to housing identified \nby the county or state Department of Health.  \n                                                      \n70 See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.html  accessed March 23, 2020 \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-4   Filed 04/20/20   Page 20 of 20\n \n62. Other individuals who may not be identified as high risk should also be considered for \nrelease. Reducing the overall number of individuals in detention facilities will facilitate \nsocial distancing for remaining detainees and lessen the burden of ensuring the safety of \ndetainees and corrections officers. \n \n63. Given the physical infrastructure of facilities, the challenges of providing security \nwithout close contact, and the lack of proper equipment (such as masks) to prevent \ntransmission, I do not believe detention facilities are equipped to ensure the safety of \nthose in their custody. Releasing individuals at highest risk who can then self-isolate – \neither in their homes or in facilities arranged by the local department of health – \nprovides a significantly better likelihood of preventing infection, disease spread and \ndeath, both in the facility and in the community at large. \n \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \n \nExecuted this 19th day of April 2020 in Princeton, New Jersey. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJoseph J.

I am an internist with expertise in correctional health care and the management of \nhealth care delivery systems in the correctional setting. I received my M.D. degree from Rush \nMedical College at Rush University.  I have worked as a physician, administrator, and expert in \nthe care of prisoners and persons with HIV infection for more than thirty years. I was Director of \nthe Montefiore Rikers Island Health Services from 1981 to 1986. In 1986, I was Vice President \nfor Medical Operations of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. In 1989, I was \nappointed Director of the AIDS Center of St. Vincent’s Hospital. I represented the American \nPublic Health Association (APHA) on the Board of the National Commission for Correctional \nHealth Care for 17 years. I have served as a federal court monitor overseeing efforts to improve \nmedical care for prisoners in Florida, Ohio, New York State, and Michigan. I have served as a \ntestifying expert in numerous prior cases concerning medical care issues in the Philadelphia \nDepartment of Prisons (formerly known as the Philadelphia Prison System).1  I have been \nappointed to oversee the care of all prisoners living with AIDS in Connecticut, and I also serve \non the nine-member New York City Board of Corrections.  \nCoronavirus of 2019 Poses a Significant Threat in the PDP \n2.  Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by \na novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for which there is no established curative medical treatment \n                                                 \n1 My work in Philadelphia has included expert testimony on behalf of the plaintiff classes in \nBowers v. City of Philadelphia, No. 06-cv-3229, and Williams v. City of Philadelphia, No. 08-\ncv-1979.  Additionally, the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas appointed me to monitor the \nPhiladelphia jail medical care system in 1991 in the Jackson v. Hendrick matter. \n  1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 22\nand no vaccine. UpToDate2 reports an overall case mortality rate from the disease of 2.3 percent, \nthough the rate ranges in different geographical regions. \n3.  The numbers of COVID-19 cases in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania are rising \nrapidly, resulting in a public health crisis. Pennsylvania was declared a major disaster area due to \nCOVID-19 on March 30, 2020. Cases in the City of Philadelphia increased from the first positive \ntests on or about March 16, 2020 to 8,045 as of April 16, 2020.3 As of April 16, 2020, there were \n27,735 cases in Pennsylvania.4   \n4.  The current conditions in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (PDP) create a \nhigh risk of contributing to an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19. Jails and prisons are long \nknown to rapidly spread air-borne respiratory infection because they house a large number of \npersons held in cramped conditions with inadequate airflow. Tuberculosis, for example, is a \nrespiratorally transmitted disease that is significantly less transmissible than COVID-19, yet it \nhas been responsible for numerous outbreaks of illness in prisons and jails over the years. For \nthis reason, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend screening for \ntuberculosis in all jails and prisons. Everyone is at risk for COVID-19 infection, and, given the \ndanger of transmission presented by COVID-19, jails and prisons require more intense screening \nand testing than conducted for tuberculosis. \n5.  Everyone who lives and works in a jail is at high risk of contracting the disease. \n                                                 \n2  UpToDate  is  an  online  medical  reference  resource  widely  used  in  hospitals  and  health \norganizations and by private physicians. The 2.3 percent figure is from an update on April 4, \n2020. \n3 City of Philadelphia, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), \nhttps://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/testing-and-data/#covid-19-\npositive-test-results  \n4 Pennsylvania Department of Health, COVID-19 Data for Pennsylvania, \nhttps://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx  \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 22\nJails promote the spread of respiratory illnesses because large groups of people are forced \nsuddenly into crowded congregate housing arrangements. Normal civilian recommendations that \nare made with the expectation that individuals can safely shelter in place are not relevant to a jail \nwhere congregate living is forced on all who enter. This situation is complicated by the fact that \ncustody and other personnel who care for detainees live in the community and can carry the virus \ninto the facility with them and, just as concerning, out into the community at large.  \n6.  At a time when (a) the President’s task force on COVID-19 recommends limiting \ngatherings to no more than 10 persons, (b) the President has declared a national emergency, (c) \nCDC recommends wearing a face mask in public settings where social distancing is difficult to \nmaintain, and (d) there is a stay-at-home order in Pennsylvania through at least April 30, 2020, \nthe City of Philadelphia has nearly 4,000 people residing in congregate living conditions in the \nPDP with a continuing influx of new admissions every day. Because of the structure of PDP’s \nfacilities and manner in which daily activities occur in those facilities, incarcerated persons \nintermingle, and it is not possible to limit gatherings to less than 10 individuals or engage in \nsocial distancing required by public health guidance. The conditions in the PDP’s facilities are \ncontrary to current public health recommendations. These circumstances have already, and will \ncontinue to, result in the spread of disease both within the PDP and to the broader community.  \n7.  Indeed, there are already large numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the \nPDP.  On Friday, March 27, 2020, the first incarcerated person in PDP tested positive for \nCOVID-19.5 Since that time, the number of infections within Philadelphia’s jails rose \nexponentially. Over the past week, each day between 1 and 9 new people test positive for the \nvirus within PDP. As of April 16, 2020 at 1pm, in total approximately 100 incarcerated people \n                                                 \n5 https://www.phila.gov/2020-03-27-city-provides-update-on-covid-19-for-friday-march-27-\n2020/ \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 22\nhave tested positive for the virus within PDP.6 Within PDP, the infection rate appears to be more \nthan double the rate of infection of the City as a whole.7  On April 17, 2020, at the City’s daily \nUpdate on COVID-19 Response in Philadelphia, Dr. Thomas Farley, Commissioner of Public \nHealth, announced that there were 13 new cases in PDP.8   \n8.   The PDP’s Commissioner has adopted a policy of not disclosing the number of \ncorrectional officers who have tested positive, but as of April 16, 2020, 43 officers had self-\nreported positive tests.9  Full disclosure of the quantitative metrics of the COVID-19 pandemic in \nthe PDP is critical to provide those who work and live there, and those to whom they come \nhome, full and up-to-date understanding of this evolving medical crisis.  Critically, infection \nrates can identify preventive actions which are succeeding, and more importantly, prevention \nstrategies which are not working.   \n9.  Medical care for COVID-19 focuses on prevention, which emphasizes physical \ndistancing, handwashing, respiratory hygiene, and the wearing of masks. Paper masks should be \nreplaced daily, cloth masks can be washed and re-used, but must be washed on a daily basis. \nImproper use of masks can transfer the virus.10   \n                                                 \n6 Philadelphia’s Managing Director Brian Abernathy provided this information during Mayor \nKenney’s April 16th, 2020 press conference at approximately the 25 minute mark.

Currently, severe cases of the disease can be treated only with supportive care \nincluding respiratory isolation, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation. In cities with widespread \ndisease, hospitals are anticipating a lack of ventilation equipment to handle the expected cases.  \n11.  COVID-19 is transmitted by infected people when they sneeze or cough. Droplets \nof respiratory secretions infected with the virus can survive as an aerosol for up to three hours.11 \nDroplets can be directly transmitted by inhalation to other individuals in close proximity. \nDroplets can land on surfaces and be picked up by the hands of another person who can then \nbecome infected by contacting a mucous membrane (eyes, mouth, or nose) with their hand. \nInfected droplets can remain viable on surfaces for variable lengths of time, ranging from up to \nthree hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard, and two to three days on plastic and stainless \nsteel.12  \n12.  COVID-19 can be transmitted by asymptomatic individuals, and it is estimated \nthat approximately six percent of infections are transmitted by asymptomatic persons.13 This is \ncritical in a jail because persons coming into the jail or already in jail and newly infected may be \nasymptomatic, are confined in close quarters, and are passing the infection without outward signs \nof illness. \n13.  Infected individuals become symptomatic in a range of 2.5 to 11.5 days with 97.5 \npercent of infected individuals becoming symptomatic within 11.5 days. Typically, an infected \nindividual becomes symptomatic around day five of their infection. The total incubation period is \n                                                 \n11 National Institute of Health (available at https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-\ncoronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces). \n12 Id. \n13  Wycliffe  Wei,  Zongbin  Li,  Calvin  Chiew,  Sarah  Yong,  Matthias  Toh,  and  Vernon  Lee, \nPresymptomatic  Transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  Singapore,  January  23-March  16,  2020, \nMorbidity  and  Mortality  Weekly  Report,  Vol.  69,  April  1,  2020  (available  at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm).  \n  5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 22\nthought to extend up to 14 days.14 Thus, persons coming into jails can be asymptomatic at intake \nscreening only to become symptomatic later during incarceration. For that reason, a \ncomprehensive correctional intake screening test for COVID-19, including COVID-19 testing, is \nessential. No person whose COVID-19 status is unknown should be admitted into the general \npopulation of PDP without being tested for the presence of virus.  With the rapid testing now \navailable, results can be available in less than an hour, and certainly within one day.  COVID-19 \ntesting of new admissions to the jail is the appropriate strategy for mitigating spread of the \ndisease.    \nDespite Some Appropriate Policy Measures Taken to Address COVID-19 in the PDP, \nConsiderably More Must be Done to Protect Incarcerated Persons and the Community \n \n14.  I have reviewed the PDP’s published explanation of measures it has declared it \nwill pursue to respond to COVID-19.15  Although some of the measures outlined in PDP’s public \nstatement are appropriate, there are significant omissions which indicate that PDP is not taking \nsufficient action to limit the spread of COVID-19.  I note that, for purposes of my commentary \non these measures (paragraphs 15-22), I have assumed that PDP is actually implementing the \nmeasures it has described in its public statements.  As discussed below (starting at paragraph 23), \nit appears that PDP is not appropriately implementing the measures it describes. \n15.  PDP’s policy is to quarantine all new admissions for 14 days.  It would be more \nappropriate to test all new admissions, and then place them in the appropriate setting in the jails \nwhen results are available.  Removing infected persons from the intake quarantine group as \nquickly as possible will reduce the likelihood of spread within the new intake population.  \n                                                 \n14 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-\npatients.html#Asymptomatic \n15 PDP Response to COVID-19, https://www.phila.gov/media/20200413152258/PDP-Response-\nCOVID-19.pdf \n  6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 8 of 22\nMaintenance of a “new admission quarantine” group is difficult, and persons living in the jail \nhave reported that PDP does not keep this group together for 14 days, with some people sent to \ngeneral population after as little as 7 days.   \n16.  PDP’s plan to quarantine symptomatic patients is appropriate, but the plan must \ninclude testing these persons for COVID-19.  PDP’s plan states that symptomatic patients should \nbe “assessed accordingly.”  If “assessed accordingly” means testing for COVID-19, that is \nappropriate.  If not, the plan should be revised to include testing of all symptomatic patients.  \nSymptomatic persons and persons with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses should be cohorted \nseparately.  \n17.  PDP describes a 100-bed facility for housing symptomatic and COVID-19 \nconfirmed patients.  The population of PDP is approximately 4,000.  This 100-person facility \nwill be filled very quickly.  In New York City’s Jails, which also house a population of \napproximately 4,000, there are currently 362 persons who are confirmed COVID-19 positive.  \n143 more are under observation and may be COVID-10 positive.  \n18.  The charts below show the scope of the epidemic in New York City’s jails, which \nas of April 19, 2020, had a population of 4,078 incarcerated people.  The charts below show that \nas of Sunday, April 19, there were cumulatively 775 Department of Correction staff with \nconfirmed COVID-19.   123 staff of the Correctional Health Services had confirmed COVID-19.  \n  7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 9 of 22\n \n  8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 10 of 22\n \n \n  9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 11 of 22\n19.  PDP states that it will provide incarcerated people with masks, but this is not \nsufficient. If paper masks are provided, a new one must be provided every day.  If cloth masks \nare provided, people who receive them should be given an opportunity to wash them at least \nonce daily. Training on putting on masks, and training on the safe removal of masks must be \nprovided by health staff.   \n20.  A program of health education, provided by health trained professionals, not PDP \nsecurity staff, must be provided, in addition to posting appropriate printed material encouraging \nphysical distancing, handwashing, mask wearing, intensive surface cleaning, and hygienic \ncoughing procedures, and showing the videos mentioned in the PDP Response document.   \n21.  The PDP Response document makes no mention of physical distancing except for \na section on counsel visits.  Distancing should take place in every aspect of life within PDP \nfacilities.  For example, sleeping arrangements must allow for six feet of separation between \nbeds in dormitory areas.  When people housed in cells are permitted to leave their cells, \ndistancing must be required.  Distancing is not optional.  It is essential for individuals to be able \nto separate six feet to prevent them from getting infected.   \n22.  The PDP response essentially places the entire jail population in solitary \nconfinement.  There is no provision for at least four hours of day of out of cell time, which \nallows for at least two hours of large muscle recreation out of doors.   \nAccounts Provided by Persons Incarcerated in PDP Facilities Show Deeply Concerning \nTrends Which Indicate that PDP is Placing the Incarcerated Population, and Especially the \nMedically Vulnerable Population, at Great Risk. \n \n23.  I have reviewed the Declarations of Saddam Abdullah, Michael Alejandro, James \nBethea, Michael Dantzler, Jay Garcia, Robert Hinton, Thomas Remick, Joseph Skinner, Nadiyah \nWalker, and Joseph Weiss.  Based upon this review, and assuming the truth of the statements \n  10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 12 of 22\nmade in these Declarations, there are significant problems in the manner in which PDP is \naddressing COVID-19 in its facilities. \n24.  In summary, those Declarations establish the following patterns: \na.  People housed in PDP facilities either live in a dormitory setting, where more \nthan 30 people sleep within 6 feet of each other, or are routinely double-\ncelled. People at all PDP facilities share showers, sinks and toilets. In \naddition, people share the phones, which are located less than 2 feet apart \nfrom each other. Using the phones requires standing within two feet of other \npeople for extended periods of time. As a result, no one held within PDP \nfacilities can practice social distancing to the extent required by CDC \nguidance necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \nb.  Many people incarcerated in PDP are double celled.   \nc.  Access to soap is limited, with many people incarcerated in the PDP going \ndays without the use of soap to wash their hands. Nor does PDP provide hand \nsanitizer to those incarcerated with its facilities. \nd.  Correctional officers inconsistently use masks and often interact with \nincarcerated people without masks.   \ne.  Though PDP has distributed cloth face coverings to incarcerated people, \npeople in PDP facilities are not able to clean or wash their face coverings.  \nNor did PDP provide people with additional coverings to allow for alternating \nand cleaning their masks. \nf.  Facilities used by multiple people, including toilets, showers, and telephones \nare not cleaned or disinfected on a regular basis. \n  11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 13 of 22\ng.  People incarcerated within PDP have no regular access to cleaning materials \nto clean and disinfect their cells or living quarters. \nh.  PDP has adopted inconsistent practices for quarantining people newly \nadmitted to PDP facilities. \ni.  People who display symptoms of COVID-19 within the facilities have not \nbeen tested or isolated from others and remain in general population. PDP \nmedical staff appear not to be testing all people who exhibit symptoms of \nCOVID-19. Moreover, when incarcerated people do test positive for COVID-\n19, PDP does not quarantine them for a sufficient length of time to ensure \nthey are no longer contagious. \n25.  These patterns are deeply problematic.  They demonstrate a failure to properly \nprotect persons incarcerated in the PDP from the spread of COVID-19 and result in a substantial \nrisk that the disease will be spread throughout the PDP’s facilities.  The risk of spread within \nPDP’s facilities likewise presents a significant risk to the entire community given that \ncorrectional staff enter and exit PDP facilities every day.  With significant spread of disease \namong people incarcerated in the PDP’s facilities, there is an enhanced likelihood of spread of \nthe disease in the communities where correctional staff members live. \n26.  In review of the declarations referenced in paragraph 23, I have observed that \nseveral of these incarcerated persons have underlying medical conditions or illness that make \nthem especially vulnerable to complications or death should they contract COVID-19.  \n27.  Joseph Skinner has severe asthma, and required intubation in the past.  He is 38 \nyears old.  COVID-19 presents as an upper respiratory illness, and progresses over several days \n  12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 14 of 22\nto lower respiratory disease, and often severe pneumonia.  Mr. Skinner is at high risk of serious \ncomplications and death should he become infected. \n28.  Robert Hinton is a 63 year old man with chronic Hepatitis C, and according to his \ndescription, cirrhosis.  His age and his chronic liver disease with cirrhosis places him at high risk \nof serious complications and death should he become infected.  \n29.  Joseph Weiss is 57 years old.  He describes being exposed to an incarcerated \nperson with a high fever.  Because of his age, he is at high risk for becoming seriously ill and \ndying should he become infected. \n30.  Jay Diaz is 30 years old.  He has two serious medical problems, asthma and \novarian cancer, which place him at high risk of serious complications and death should be \nbecome infected and develop COVID-19.   \n31.  Thomas Remick is a 30-year-old man with a history of sarcoma, a cancer.  For \nthis reason he is at high risk for developing serious complications and death should be become \ninfected with the coronavirus. \n32.  Michael Dantzler is a 45 year old.  He has vascular disease and has had life \nthreatening complications of his disease.  Two months ago, on February 20, a blood clot caused a \npulmonary embolism and he received emergency surgery.  The surgery was complicated by a \nlaceration of his kidney.  Mr. Dantzler has serious underlying vascular disease which means he is \nat increased risk for serious complications and death should he become sick with COVID-19. \n33.  James Bethea is 53 years old.  He has multiple medical problems including \nhepatitis C and diabetes.  He also has serious mental illness for which he has been treated with \nanti-psychotic medications.  Because of his age, his liver disease, his diabetes, and his serious \n  13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 15 of 22\nmental illness, James Bethea is at increased risk of becoming seriously ill and dying should he \ncontract COVID-19.  \n34.  Saddam Abdullah is a 29 year old man.  He has severe asthma.  He had four \nasthma attacks in April which were not responsive to his inhaler.  In these circumstances he \nrequires a nebulizer to provide him with aerosolized medication.  PDP Medical staff  refused to \nprovide Mr. Abdulla with his required nebulizer treatment because they were concerned that the \nnebulized might spread coronavirus treatment.  The medical staff’s concern is not without merit, \nbut Mr. Abdulla requires treatment for his asthma.  He is at high risk for serious complications \nand death should he become infected.  \n35.  Nadiyah Walker is a 43-year-old woman.  She has epilepsy, asthma, diabetes and \nanemia.  She has not been provided with the inhaler she uses to treat her asthma.  Because of her \nasthma, she is at high risk for complications and death from COVID-19 infection.  Patients with \nasthma and diabetes are a very high risk for complications and death from COVID-19 infection.    \n36.  These medical issues are representative of what I would expect to see in a large \nurban jail.  There is a high prevalence of serious chronic disease.  Persons older than 50 are \nlikely to have multiple chronic medical conditions and be receiving multiple medications.  For \nthese reasons, I expect that large portions of the PDP population are at risk of severe \ncomplications or death from COVID-19.  This underscores the urgent need for PDP to engage in \nappropriate measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 among the incarcerated population in its \nfacilities. \nRecommendations for Safe Management of COVID-19 in PDP \n37.  Incarcerated persons in quarantine or in isolation for suspicion or known infection \nmust be monitored. Persons in quarantine should be monitored daily for symptoms and \n  14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 16 of 22\ntemperature. Individuals in isolation require multiple daily temperature checks and monitoring of \nblood oxygen levels to ensure stability. The required monitoring has had an effect – severely \nstressing or overwhelming – on staffing in facilities with significant infections. The COVID-19 \npandemic has had a similar effect on staffing in most hospital settings. \n38.  All persons newly admitted to PDP should be tested for COVID-19. \n39.  Most persons being discharged from the PDP have uncertain COVID-19 status.  \nAll persons living and working in the jails are at very high risk of COVID-19 infection.  Data \npublished by the Philadelphia Defender Association suggest that rates within the PDP’s jails are \nclose to three times the rates in the general population of Philadelphia.16   By comparison, the \ninfection rates for persons living in New York City’s jails is more than 8,000 per 100,000, with \n686 correctional officers having become infected as of April 16, 2020.17  If a person of unknown \nCOVID-19 status is discharged from the jail quarantine, they have a significant likelihood of \nbeing infected, and they can infect persons they come into contact with in the community. For \nthis reason, persons being discharged from PDP who have uncertain status need to be tested with \na rapid COVID-19 test prior to discharge and given appropriate instructions on protecting \nthemselves and others. Testing should not be used to delay release. Additionally, homeless \npersons who are COVID-19 positive and symptomatic should be provided a hotel room on \nrelease from jail until their condition has stabilized.  \n40.  The current CDC recommendations for social distancing and frequent \nhandwashing measures, which are the only measures available to protect against infection, are \nextremely unlikely to be adequately enforced in the current correctional environment at the PDP.  \nThe mandatory cleaning and sanitizing of all surfaces multiple times each day, in bathrooms, \n                                                 \n16 https://www.philadefender.org/covid-philly-jails/.  \n17 https://www1.nyc.gov/site/boc/covid-19.page \n  15 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 17 of 22\ntoilets, showers, tables, and all surfaces will be extremely difficult to ensure, as evidenced by the \ninformation provided in the above-referenced declarations.  Adequate cleaning supplies and \nnecessary personal protective equipment for all persons must be provided, including a daily \ndisposable mask or a means to clean cloth masks.  Alcohol based hand sanitizer should also be \nprovided.  \n41.  A large number of employees work in jails and prisons. These individuals have \nfrequent contact with incarcerated persons, which often requires them to violate the \nrecommended CDC guidelines for social distancing.18 Frequent handwashing is not easily \navailable for inmates or staff. Their risk is considerable. As noted, at least 40 employees of the \nPDP self reported that they tested positive for COVID-19 as of April 16, 2020, and the number \nof infected employees will undoubtedly be larger when this Declaration is filed. These \nemployees return to their homes and can and will transmit the infection to others in their families \nand community. In this sense, jails act as incubators of respiratory infectious disease. COVID-19 \nis experiencing a rapid and dramatic spread within the PDP and this ongoing outbreak is \ninevitably resulting in spread to the community.  All staff entering the jail should be screened \ndaily for temperature and symptoms, and should be sent home if they cannot pass the screen.   \nOpinions and Conclusions \n42.  It is my opinion that at this time, testing for COVID-19 must be expanded to all \npersons admitted to PDP, all symptomatic persons, and all persons about to be discharged. These \ntests need to be done as rapidly as possible due to problems with potential for transmission in the \nquarantined population and the need to discharge people quickly. Rapid COVID-19 testing also \n                                                 \n18 CDC, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities (available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html) \n  16 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 18 of 22\nneeds to be expanded for as many people as possible because of the ongoing continuing rise in \ncases and continuing transmission within PDP’s jails. Implementation of this measure is \nnecessary to protect both the population of incarcerated people and the civilian population who \nwill be exposed to employees who work within the jails. \n43.  It is my opinion that—to the extent, for any reason, they are not immediately \nreleased—any incarcerated person over 50 and, certainly anyone over 55, or with severe mental \nillness, or a medical vulnerability as set forth below, along with all persons in quarantine or who \nhave potentially been exposed to the virus should, immediately, have a daily symptom and \ntemperature screening. An individual’s immune system is the primary defense against this \ninfection. As a result, people over 55 years of age and persons with impaired immunity, \nincluding chronic diseases, have a higher probability of death if they are infected. It is important \nto note that the older a person is, the higher the likelihood of death; this is thought to be due to \nimpaired immunity with aging. Persons of any age with a number of health conditions including \nlung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis \npatients), diabetes, hypertension, compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or \nautoimmune disease), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic \ndisorders, stroke, developmental delay, severe obesity, and asthma, also have an elevated risk.19 \n44.  Early reports estimate that the mortality rate for those with cardiovascular disease \nwas 13.2%, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and \n                                                 \n19 World Health Organization, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: Myth \nbusters  (available  at  https://cutt.ly/dtEiCyc)  (“Older  people,  and  people  with  pre-existing \nmedical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to \nbecoming severely ill with the virus.”); see CDC, “Groups at Higher Risk of Severe Illness” \n(available  at  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-\nhigher-risk.html) . \n \n  17 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 19 of 22\n7.6% for cancer.20 Persons with severe mental illness in jails and prisons are also, in my opinion, \nat increased risk of acquiring and transmitting infection because of likely inability or impaired \nability to communicate their symptoms and their difficulty in accessing care.  \n45.  Any positive symptom or temperature should require respiratory isolation and \ntesting for COVID-19. All symptomatic persons under investigation and known COVID-19 \npositive detainees need to have clinical monitoring every shift including vital signs (pulse, \ntemperature, respirations) and pulse oximeter testing to determine respiratory status.  This \ninformation is essential to identify patients who cannot be cared for in the jails who require \nhospitalization. \n46.  It is my opinion that all persons whom PDP anticipates discharging who have \nuncertain COVID-19 status need to be tested with a rapid COVID-19 test prior to discharge.   \n47.  All symptomatic persons requiring discharge planning services to assure safe \ntransition back to their community must have access to these services, including temporary \nhousing.    \n48.  Maintaining physical distance of six feet between incarcerated persons would not \nbe possible in two person cells, which have a footprint of approximately 6’ by 9’.  The bunk beds \ntake up a large part of the available space, as does the sink and the toilet in these rooms.  I have \nvisited many two-person cells in PDP.  They do not allow for maintenance of six feet of distance \nbetween persons.  Similarly, dormitory housing at more than 50% utilization does not allow for \nmaintenance of six feet distance between persons because beds are fixed to the floor much closer \nthan six feet apart. \n                                                 \n \n  18 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 20 of 22\n49.  COVID-19 is present in fecal matter.  Persons sharing toilets which are not \nsterilized after each use may place persons at risk for infection by COVID-19 via fecal oral \ntransmission.21 22 \n50.  It is my opinion, consistent with CDC recommendations, that all incarcerated \npersons and staff should wear a facemask—and a facemask that is clean. Employees interacting \nwith potentially positive people (most incarcerated people at this time) must wear CDC \nrecommended personal protective equipment.  \n51.  It is my opinion that all inmates in the PDP’s jails should receive full and free \naccess to sanitation supplies (including soap, cleaning supplies, paper supplies and sanitizer with \nat least 60 percent alcohol) and adequate advice, orally and in writing, by appropriately trained \nhealth personnel, regarding the relevant symptoms to look for, the urgency of the social \ndistancing, and appropriate use of PPE.  \n52.  Free and unlimited phone calls should be available to mitigate the extreme stress \nof the prolonged solitary confinement status now operating at PDP facilities, and the banning of \nvisits from family and friend. Alcohol or bleach wipes should be provided to each person before \nthey make a phone call to allow them to sterilize the phone, both the handpiece and the phone’s \nkeyboard.   Adequate phones should be available to allow for increased use, and they should be \nspaced six feet apart.   \n53.  PDP administration should document that cleaning supplies are available to \npersons working and living in the jail, that all surfaces in all housing and living areas are cleaned \nat least three/four times a day.  This information should be published. \n                                                 \n21 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-020-0295-7 \n22 https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508520302821 \n  19 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-5   Filed 04/20/20   Page 21 of 22\n54.  It is my opinion that all persons housed in the Jail should receive information, \nboth verbally and in writing, about the latest CDC and public health guidance about the COVID-\n19 disease, including best practices and updated protocols as they emerge. \n55.  It is my opinion that all persons housed in the PDP should receive clean, \nlaundered sheets and clothing at least twice a week, and showers with soap once per day, and at \nleast two hours daily of large muscle recreation. \n56.  It is my opinion that sufficient physical distancing must be implemented \nthroughout the PDP jails, including allowing for six feet of distance between inmates, in addition \nto the measures outlined above for those who are positive or symptomatic, pending test results.  \n57.  It is my opinion that inmates must continue to have access to timely and \nemergency medical and mental health care as this virus continues to spread.  \n58.  It is my opinion that statistics reflecting the state of the pandemic in PDP be \npublished daily and provided to the community, including those who live and work in the jails.  \nThis data is essential to assure that current pandemic management plans are working, and to \nprovide timely evidence if they are not, so that plans can be changed.

I am a 30-year-old man serving a sentence of 11 ½ to 23 months of incarceration for \nrobbery and burglary. I have been in custody since May 2019. I am held at the Detention \nCenter (DC) in Philadelphia.  \n2.  I was diagnosed with sarcoma in 2015, and had a tumor removed from my leg in 2016. The \ndoctor told me my tumor was an aggressive type of cancer that commonly spreads to the \nlungs.  As  part  of  my  medical  care,  I  am  supposed  to  have  chest  x-rays  every  6 \nmonths.  When I arrived at PDP a little over a year ago, I received one x-ray.  I had a second \nx-ray in March, after my public defender complained to the prison.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 36\n3.  As a result of this medical condition, I understand that I am at heightened risk of severe \nsymptoms and death due to COVID-19. \n4.  I have already filed grievances seeking assistance due to my medical condition. \n5.  In addition to my sarcoma condition, I have a broken kneecap as a result of a car accident \nthat occurred before my incarceration. While I was housed at CFCF, I wore a brace. When \nI entered DC, they took this brace away from me. \n6.  I also suffer from headaches and allergies. When I reported this to the medical staff, I was \ninstructed to buy Tylenol from the commissary.  \n7.  I am currently housed in Q dorm with 20 other people, though the dorm normally holds 48 \npeople. This is a large open space with bunk beds, shared toilets, and sinks. However, even \nwith fewer people, the beds in the dorm are still close together and we all sleep within 3 \nfeet of other people. It is impossible for all of us to stay six feet apart from every other \nperson while in the dorm.  \n8.  Previously, I was housed in D Dorm, where there were mice on the bunks. \n9.  Most of the time, several people in Q dorm are coughing.   \n10. Two weeks ago, a man in Q Dorm became very ill, and started urinating and defecating on \nhimself. The officers removed him from the dorm.  \n11. Recently, three new people were transferred to our block from E&D annex because the \nprison was planning on closing the annex and was spreading people out among the other \ndorms. However, the new people only stayed for lunch and then were moved back to their \noriginal dorm. I later learned that someone on the E&D annex had been sent to the hospital.  \nThe hospital tested him for COVID-19, the test came back positive, and that is why the \nprison returned everyone to E&D annex.   \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 36\n12. One officer who works the 7 am to 3 pm shifts gives us cleaning supplies and lets us clean \nour dorm every three hours. When this officer is not on duty, the other officers keep the \ncleaning supplies locked up and refuse to give us access to them. As a result, we can only \nclean our dorms when this one specific officer is on duty.  \n13. We received face masks last week. We are supposed to be allowed to change them every \nTuesday.   \n14. Not all of the people in my dorm wear their masks all the time. The officers told us that we \nhave to wear the masks when we leave the dorm, but they do not make us wear them while \nin the dorm. \n15. While I see officers with masks on when they are coming into or leaving our dorm, officers \nwill sometimes remove their masks once they are on our dorm and are staying for a shift.   \n16. Someone came onto our block from the quarantine unit and told us he had been there for \nbetween 7 and 10 days. I thought people were supposed to be quarantined for 14 days when \nthey arrived at the prison.  \n17. The officers hand out soap and toilet paper once per week. If you run out of soap, you have \nto wait until the following week or buy it from the commissary. If you do not have money \nor access to the commissary, you will not have enough soap to wash yourself.  \n18. The officers have a hand sanitizer pump for their own use in their enclosed officers’ station. \nMost of the officers prohibit us from using the hand sanitizer, though one officer lets me \nhave some hand sanitizer when I help hand out the food.  \n19. I understand that the food trays are prepared and assembled at a central location in CFCF \nthen distributed to all the other facilities.  \n20. I am scared that I will get sick.  \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 36\n \nI, Susan Lin, certify that Thomas Remick relayed the above information to me over the phone on \nApril 16, 2020 and that he gave me permission to relay this information in a declaration signed on \nhis behalf.

I am a 30-year-old man. I have been held at Riverside Correctional Facility (RCF) since \nNovember 9, 2019. I am being held on $10,000 cash bail for an open possession with intent \nto deliver controlled substances charge.  I also have a probation detainer that holds me in \ncustody.  \n2.  I have asthma, and I normally use an inhaler. Since being incarcerated, I have not had \naccess to an inhaler. In addition, I sometimes need “breathing treatments” but I have not \nreceived those while in custody. I currently have to take deep breaths when I talk. I have \nasked a nurse for breathing treatments but have not received any. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 36\n3.  In addition, I have stage 3 cervical and ovarian cancer. I was diagnosed in December 2018, \nand before my incarceration I was receiving treatment at Temple Hospital. My oncologist \ntold me that the cancer made me more susceptible to infections. I was scheduled to have a \nhysterectomy in May followed by radiation and chemotherapy. I am currently experiencing \nabdominal pain, difficulty holding urine, lower back pain and frequent feeling that I need \nto urinate. Since being incarcerated, I have not had any treatment for this cancer. I was \nsupposed to go for a medical visit on March 27, 2020 but was not sent to this visit. \n4.  I filed a grievance a week or so ago about the lack of access to medical care and my \nsituation but received no response.  \n5.  As a result of my asthma and cancer, I understand that I am at heightened risk of severe \nsymptoms and risk of death due to COVID-19. \n6.  I am currently housed in E Unit with about 60 other people. While the unit is less than half \nfull, the staff has condensed us into the bottom tier of the unit, leaving the top tier empty. \nThough I do not have a cellmate, many people on the unit are double-celled.  \n7.  We eat our meals in our cells. \n8.  We are on lockdown and generally get out of our cells for about 15-20 minutes, sometimes \nonce a day, sometimes twice. It has been weeks since we have been let into the yard. \n9.  When we are let out of our cells, 10-20 people are let out at a time to use the phones, \nshowers, and to get water. \n10. Some staff try to enforce social distancing but others do not. There are distance markers on \nthe floor but no instructions on how to use them.  \n11. While most of us try to abide by social distancing, it is impossible do so when using the \nphones as they are less than 2 feet apart. When we use the phones we must stand elbow to \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 8 of 36\nelbow. We generally try to clean the phones after every use with disinfectant that staff gives \nus. The staff do not require that we clean the phones, nor does the staff clean the phones \nfor us, but we do it on our own initiative. I am the block representative and I make sure the \nphones are cleaned. \n12. We share the showers, which are separate stalls. Showers are cleaned twice a day, but not \nafter every use. \n13. On April 1, I received a cloth mask, but no instructions on whether or how often to clean \nit. We all wear masks whenever we leave our cells.  \n14. Some staff wear masks and others do not. Multiple sergeants have visited our unit without \nmasks.  \n15. At least four people on my unit have had symptoms of COVID-19, including loss of sense \nof taste, burning nostrils, and waking up in sweats. None of those people have been \nmedically isolated or tested. \n16. I was supposed to have a court date on March 17, where I understood I was to plead guilty \nand receive a sentence of 11 ½ to 23 months of incarceration with immediate parole. This \nmeant I would have been released from jail. I did not get into court on March 17th and have \nnot heard anything about my case since February. I do not know when my next court date \nis. \n17. I fear for my life if I am kept in jail. \n \nI, Matthew A.

I am a 43-year-old woman currently held at the Riverside Correctional Facility (RCF). I \nhave been in custody since September 1, 2019. I am held on $150,000 bail for an open \nrobbery charge. I also have probation detainers holding me as a result of this open charge. \n2.  I have epilepsy and suffer from seizures. My last seizure occurred in February. In addition, \nI also have diabetes, asthma, and anemia.   \n3.  I have not received any medical treatment for my asthma. A few days ago, I had an asthma \nattack and the staff refused to give me a pump. They told me I was “hyperventilating.” \n4.  I filed a grievance on or around April 11, 2020 and received no response. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 11 of 36\n5.  I understand that as a result of my medical conditions, I am at heightened risk of severe \nsymptoms and death due to COVID-19.  \n6.  I am currently housed on E-Unit at RCF with approximately 60 other women.  Although \nthe unit is less than half full, they closed the top tier, so the remaining women are mostly \ndouble-celled on the bottom tier. I do not have a cellmate, though many others do. \n7.  We all share showers and phones.  \n8.  My toilet has no lid and low water pressure; it does not flush properly and waste comes up \nafter I flush.  \n9.  We are on lockdown and only let out of our cells for about 15-20 minutes in the morning \nand 15-20 minutes most nights. The guards generally let 10-20 people out of their cells at \na time to shower, use the phones, and get water.  \n10. We cannot social distance when we use the phones because the phones are spaced less than \n2 feet apart.  \n11. The shower is cleaned twice a day, not after every use. \n12. I received one cloth mask around April 9. I try to wash my mask in my sink every night \nwith soap that I purchased from the commissary. The staff do not provide additional masks \nor soap for washing masks.  \n13. I have to purchase soap because the staff do not provide soap sufficient for us to wash our \nhands frequently.  \n14. I see the staff use hand sanitizer but they have not provided any for us.  \n15. I heard that an RCF staff member who sometimes worked on my unit died from the virus. \n16. I know that two women on my unit had fevers but the staff did not take them off the unit. \nInstead, they were just told to stay in their cells. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 12 of 36\n17.

I am a plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am a 27-year-old man currently held at the Detention \nCenter (DC) in Philadelphia. I have been in custody since February 25, 2020.  \n2.  I am being held as a pretrial detainee charged with aggravated assault. My bail on these \ncharges is set at 10% of $25,000. \n3.  I am also being held pursuant to a probation detainer, as my new charges would constitute \na violation of probation if I am found guilty of them. \n4.  I suffer from asthma, which I understand places me at heightened risk for more severe \nsymptoms and potential death from COVID-19.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 14 of 36\n5.  I am currently housed with 31 other inmates in a dorm, which is approximately the size \nof half of a basketball court (approximately 2,350 square feet). We sleep in bunkbeds, \napproximately 2 to 3 feet apart.  \n6.  We all eat together in this one large room. \n7.  It is impossible to stay 6 feet apart from each other while in this jail.  \n8.  All 32 of us share 1 shower, 2 urinals, and 1 toilet. The toilet does not have a lid. \n9.  The showers and toilets are only cleaned once a day in the morning.  \n10. All of the inmates use the same phones. These phones are spaced less than 2 feet apart. \nThe phones are cleaned only once per day in the morning, and the phones are not cleaned \nafter each use. \n11. The block itself is cleaned once per day in the morning, but the bunks are not cleaned, \nbecause people are often sleeping in their bunks during cleaning. \n12.  While we are told that everyone is supposed to get soap once a week on Monday, we do \nnot actually receive soap. I asked a correctional officer whether I could get soap, and was \ntold they did not have any to give out. In order to get soap to wash my hands and body, I \nhave to purchase it from the commissary with my personal money.  \n13. We are not given hand sanitizer, disinfectant, or cleaning materials. In order to obtain \ndisinfectants, people have to sneak it from staff and block workers, who will occasionally \nlook the other way. \n14. Two weeks ago, the prison staff gave the inmates cloth masks, made of what appeared to \nbe bedsheet-like material and elastic. We cannot wash these masks. We had one \nopportunity to switch out our mask and receive a fresh mask. I chose not to switch mine \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 15 of 36\nout. In order to get a new mask, you had to be without a mask for a couple of hours while \nyou waited for a new one.  \n15. The correctional officers wear masks. \n16. We do not have gloves.  \n17. I hear a lot of coughing in my unit and think at least 3 people may be sick. I have not seen \nor heard anything about the medical department evaluating them.  \n18. I have not been tested for COVID-19 and I have not seen nor heard that anyone else in \nmy unit has been tested either.  \n19. We have been locked down in this dorm for almost one month.  \nI, Susan Lin, certify that Michael Alejandro relayed the above information to me over the phone \non April 15, 2020 and that he gave me permission to relay this information in a declaration signed \non his behalf.

I am a 45-year-old man currently incarcerated at the Detention Center (DC). I am held \npretrial on $150,000 cash bail in an open case where the main charge is the unlawful \npossession of firearms. I was arrested on September 20, 2018, and have been held in \ncustody since that time.  \n2.  I have a vascular disease that makes me prone to blot clots. On February 20, 2020, I had \nemergency surgery to remove a pulmonary embolism. During the surgery, the doctors \nlacerated my kidney by accident. I take medication to help the laceration heal and receive \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 17 of 36\nperiodic imaging to ensure it is healing properly. I lost 50 pounds in the two months since \nmy surgery.  \n3.  I understand that, because of my medical condition, I am at heightened risk of severe \nsymptoms and death due to COVID-19. \n4.  I filed a grievance challenging the conditions at this jail and asking to be released. I have \nnot received an answer to my grievance. \n5.  I am currently housed in a cell by myself on the medical unit at DC along with two other \npeople.  \n6.  In the whole time I have been here, no one has ever cleaned my cell. I do not have access \nto any cleaning products so I cannot clean the cell myself.  \n7.  Block workers clean the hallways and other areas outside of the cells.  \n8.  The officers have never given me any soap. I have had to buy all my soap from the \ncommissary.  \n9.  I am on lockdown and in my cell for at least 23 hours a day. I am allowed out of my cell \nonly to use the shower and phone. I am worried that not moving around will lead to another \nblood clot.  \n10. A doctor comes to my cell every week. The doctor does not always wear a mask. \n11. The officers are supposed to wear masks but do not always do so. The officers do not wear \ngloves. \n12. I was first given a mask about 2 weeks ago. It was made out of white fabric. I was not able \nto clean or change my mask. I wore that same mask for 14 days before I was given a second \nmask.  \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 18 of 36\n13.

I am 63-years-old and currently held at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF) in \nPhiladelphia. I have been in custody since my arrest on April 7, 2020. I was admitted to \nCFCF on April 8, 2020. \n2.  I am being held as a pretrial detainee charged with aggravated assault. My bail is set at \n$200,000. \n3.  I have Hepatitis C, which caused damage to and scarring of my liver. I understand that as \na result of my age and medical condition I am at heightened risk for more severe symptoms \nand death due to COVID-19, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 20 of 36\n4.  I am currently experiencing pain on the side of my abdomen.  \n5.  I have been in “quarantine” since I arrived at CFCF on April 8th. This “quarantine” means \nthat I have been housed in a small “multipurpose room” with 2 other people. There are 2 \nbunk beds, and we all share one toilet and one sink. It is impossible to keep 6 feet away \nfrom the other people given the size of the room. \n6.  Once a day, I am released from the multipurpose room for 20 minutes to use the phone and \nshower. The showers are not being cleaned with disinfectant and I have no shower shoes, \nso I must walk barefoot in these showers. \n7.  When I arrived at CFCF, I received some soap. It did not last long. I used up all of this \nsoap a few days ago. I have been begging officers to give me more. I have had to go without \nsoap for several days. \n8.  I clean the cell when I can. I ask the correctional officers for a spray bottle of cleaner and \nsometimes the officers will give it to me; sometimes the officers refuse.  \n9.  All meals are brought to our cell. The officers do not always collect the trays after meals. \nIn the late afternoon on April 16, my breakfast and lunch trays were still on the floor and \nthere were cockroaches in the cell.  \n10. The officers gave me a single mask made out of cloth when I arrived. Because I do not \nhave consistent access to soap, I am not able to wash or clean this mask. I have not received \na replacement mask in the eight days that I have been at CFCF.  \n11. I do not have access to gloves or hand sanitizer.  \n12. The officers wear masks most of the time but there have been occasions when I have seen \nthem interacting with incarcerated people while not wearing masks. \n13. Someone takes my temperature two or three times a day.  \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 21 of 36\n14.

I am 57-years-old. I am an Army veteran, having served for 10 years. I was wounded in \ncombat, and as a result have a metal rod and pins in my femur. I walk with a cane.  \n2.  I have been in custody since my arrest on April 3, 2020. I have been held at Curran-\nFromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF) since April 4, 2020.  \n3.  I am being held pretrial at CFCF on $75,000 bail for an open aggravated assault charge.  \n4.  I understand that I am at heightened risk of severe symptoms and death due to COVID-19 \nbecause of my age. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 23 of 36\n5.  Upon arriving at CFCF, I was placed in a “quarantine” cell. It is a converted multipurpose \nroom. It is only a couple of feet bigger than a normal cell. This multipurpose room has two \nbunk beds, and a shared sink and toilet. \n6.  In  the  quarantine  multipurpose  room,  I  was  housed  with  two  other  people.  It  was \nimpossible to stay 6 feet away from the other people. \n7.  Someone checked our temperatures three times a day. \n8.  I did not receive a mask when I arrived. I only received one several days after my arrival. \n9.  I do not have access to gloves.  \n10. The correctional officers are wearing gloves and masks. \n11. On April 7, 2020, one of the other men in the multipurpose room with me ran a 103 degree \nfever and the officers removed him from the multipurpose room. The next day the \ncorrectional officers gave us spray bottles of bleach and told us to clean down the room.  \n12. I was later transferred to a regular cell within CFCF. I am currently by myself in the cell. \nSince being transferred to the cell, the officers check my temperature twice a day. \n13. I did not have access to any soap for the first four days of my time at CFCF. I did not \nreceive any soap until I was transferred out of the multipurpose room to a regular cell.  \n14. No one cleans our cells and we do not have access to cleaning products.  \n15.

I am a plaintiff in this lawsuit. I am a 38-year-old man currently held at the Curran-\nFromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF) in Philadelphia.  I have been in custody since July \n2, 2019. \n2.  I suffer from severe asthma. I use an inhaler daily. In the past, I have been hospitalized 4 \nor 5 times and have been intubated due to my asthma. The last time I was hospitalized was \nin 2015. I understand that my medical condition places me at heightened risk for more \nsevere symptoms and potential death from COVID-19.   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 26 of 36\n3.  I am being held as a pretrial detainee charged with possession with intent to deliver drugs. \nMy bail on these charges is set at $20,000 \n4.  I am also being held pursuant to a probation detainer, as my new charges would constitute \na violation of probation if I am found guilty of them.  \n5.  I am housed in a cell on a block with over 70 people in it.  \n6.  Most people on this block are double-celled. I shared my cell with someone until the \nmorning of April 15th. I expect to have a new cellmate shortly.  \n7.  The cell, which is roughly the same size as the inside of a standard SUV,  contains a set of \nbunk beds, a chair, as well as a toilet and sink which we both share.  The toilet does not \nhave a lid. There is no way to maintain a distance of six feet apart from your cellmate at all \ntimes. \n8.  We have been on lockdown for the past month. We were told we would be let out twice a \nday for 15 minutes each time. This does not happen daily because there have been too few \ncorrectional officers showing up for work.  \n9.  I receive food in my cell and eat while in my cell.  \n10. The phones are approximately 1 foot apart from each other. Because we only have limited \nopportunities to use the phones, every time you use the phones, you are within six feet of \nanother inmate. The phones are not cleaned between each use; the block workers clean \nthem approximately 2 to 4 times per day.  \n11. The block workers clean the block 2 to 4 times per day. \n12. I received one mask a week ago. I cannot wash this mask. I have been using the same mask \nfor a week without cleaning it.  \n13. The correctional officers have been wearing masks and gloves for the past two weeks.   \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 27 of 36\n14. None of the inmates have gloves except for the block workers who get them to clean.   \n15. The jail is not giving us soap – not even “county soap” (the soap everyone is supposed to \nget for free).  When we ask the officers for it, the officers say they do not have any.  In \norder to get soap to wash my hands and body, I have to purchase it from commissary with \nmy own money.  \n16. Nor do I have access to hand sanitizer.  \n17. There are 8 showers on the block, and they are shared among 70 people. These showers \nare only cleaned once per week. The showers are not cleaned after each use.  \n18. Before the lockdown began, we could clean our cell one time per week. Now, if you want \nto clean your cell, you have to ask an officer for cleaning material – some officers will give \nit to you and some refuse.  They will give you a broom, a mop, bleach, and disinfectant.  I \nhave cleaned my cell once per week since the lockdown began. \n19. The officers continually bring newly admitted people onto my block. I had heard that the \njail would keep people in the quarantine unit for 14 days after they were admitted to the \njail,  but  officers  brought  8  new  people  onto  my  block  after  only  7  days  of  being \nquarantined.  \nI, Susan Lin, certify that Joseph Skinner relayed the above information to me over the phone \non April 15, 2020 and that he gave me permission to relay this information in a declaration \nsigned on his behalf.  Due to restrictions on communication between counsel and those \nincarcerated in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons, the finished declaration has not been \nreviewed with Mr. Skinner.   \n          /s/ Susan M.

I am a 29-year-old man currently held pretrial at Philadelphia Industrial Correctional \nCenter (PICC). I am being held on $1,000,000 cash bail as a result of a third degree \nhomicide charge. \n2.  I have asthma, and had four asthma attacks during the week of April 6, 2020 alone. My \ninhaler is not working.  After one of my asthma attacks, medical staff came and checked \nme but refused to give me a breathing treatment. They told me the droplets from the \nbreathing treatment could spread the virus. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 30 of 36\n3.  I understand that as a result of my medical condition, I am at heightened risk for severe \nsymptoms and death due to COVID-19. \n4.  Last week, I had chills. I could not taste or smell and had difficulty breathing.  I put in a \nsick call request detailing my symptoms. Medical staff came and checked my temperature, \nbut told me I did not have a fever. The staff offered me Tylenol and Robitussin, but I \ndeclined.  \n5.  I filed an emergency grievance, but have not yet received any response. \n6.  I was not tested for the coronavirus nor was I medically isolated in any way.  \n7.  I am currently on H-1 unit with approximately 100 other people on the unit.  The unit is \nmostly full and generally, we are all double-celled.  \n8.  I am in a cell approximately 6’ x 9’ with a cellmate. It is impossible to stay 6 feet apart \nfrom my cellmate when we are in the cell. \n9.  We share a toilet and sink. The toilet does not have a lid and when the people in the cell \nnext to mine flush their toilet, some of the material they flushed comes up in my toilet, and \nvice versa. \n10. We have been on lockdown for several weeks. We are only allowed out of our cells for 15-\n20 minutes once every 3-4 days.  \n11. When people are let out of their cells, the officers let eight people out at a time, sometimes \nfewer than that.  \n12. From approximately March 31 through April 15, 2020, I did not have any toilet paper.  \n13. I have one bar of soap that I purchased from commissary but no hand soap.  The officers \nare supposed to give out soap every week but they do not do so. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 31 of 36\n14. I received one cloth mask made out of bedsheet material. I received that mask on March \n23. I received no instructions on how to clean this mask.  \n15. I have not been able to clean my cell for the entire time I have been on lockdown. I received \nno cleaning supplies for my cell.  \n16. When we are out of our cells, there is no enforcement of social distancing.  \n17. The phones are very close together, close enough that when I am standing in front of one \nphone, I can touch the phone next to it. Whenever I use the phone, I am within 2 feet of \nanother person.  \n18. Last week, approximately six or seven people on my unit had symptoms of the virus, \nincluding coughing and fever. They were all left on the unit. To my knowledge, the staff \ndid not test or isolate any of those people.  \n19. Staff sometimes, but not always, wear masks. Some staff approach and talk to inmates \nwithout masks on. \n20. On April 15, while I was on the phone, a Major approached me without a mask on. He got \nright in my face, close enough to touch me, and told me to get off the phone. The guard \nthen threatened me, saying “I’m gonna put you in the hospital.” \n21. I know one inmate who was transferred to our unit after being quarantined in the COVID \ntrailers for only 14 days. He had tested positive for coronavirus and staff moved him to our \nunit without a second test to confirm that he was virus-free. \n22. I fear that my life is in jeopardy if I remain in custody.  \n \nI, Matthew A.

I am a 53-year-old man currently housed at Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center \n(PICC). I am serving a sentence for a technical violation of parole. In March 2018, Judge \nCoyle sentenced me to time-in to 23 months of incarceration, followed by probation, for a \nmisdemeanor simple assault and resisting arrest. On September 24, 2018, Judge Coyle \nrevoked my parole as a result of a technical violation and I was taken into custody. For my \ntechnical violation, I was sentenced to serve my back-time.  I understand that I will not be \nreleased until July 2020. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 34 of 36\n2.  I am also facing charges for contraband, but was ordered released on own recognizance, so \nthis charge is not holding me in custody.  \n3.  I have asthma and use albuterol daily. When out of custody, I smoke daily.  I have been \ntreated for Hepatitis C and suffer from arthritis. In addition, I have been diagnosed with \nschizophrenia and bipolar disorder and was previously prescribed zyprexa. I have also been \ndiagnosed as borderline diabetic and was previously prescribed metformin.  \n4.  I understand that as a result of my medical condition, I am at heightened risk for serious \nsymptoms and death due to COVID-19. \n5.  I have asked to go to medical, but those requests have been denied. I understand that the \nmedical staff have stopped taking all sick calls.  \n6.  Officers come around twice a day to check everyone’s temperature.  \n7.  I am currently held in the punitive segregation unit because I was caught with a cigarette. \nI have been here for 63 days.  \n8.  I share an 8’ x 10’ cell with a cellmate. It is impossible to stay 6 feet apart from each other \nat all times. We share a sink, toilet, one chair, and a desk. \n9.  There are approximately 50 men on the block and we share 5 phones and 4 showers. \n10. Most of the people on the block are double-celled. \n11. Before the lockdown began, about a month ago, we were able to clean our cell once every \nweek. For the past month we have not been able to clean our cells. I asked the officers for \nbleach and disinfectant and they refused to give any to me.  \n12. There is a significant staffing shortage. Due to this shortage, there are many days on which \nthe officers have not let us out of our cells at all. I last showered 4 days ago.  I last used the \nphone 2 or 3 days ago.   \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 35 of 36\n13. When there are enough officers, we are allowed out 5 cells at a time but only for about an \nhour.   \n14. Phones are cleaned only once per day.  They are not cleaned between each usage.  When \nyou use the phone, you are locked in a cage with the phone.  You are about three feet away \nfrom the person next to you who is in his own cage with a phone. Every time you use the \nphone, you are within 6 feet of another inmate. \n15. The showers are cleaned only once per day and not between each usage.  \n16. In order to have soap, I have to buy it from the commissary.  Over the past two months, I \nhave run out of soap 2 to 3 times.  When that happened, I asked officers for soap but they \nsaid they did not have any.  I had to wait for my family to put money on my books before \nI could get soap.  During those times, I had to use just water to clean myself.  \n17. The officers never provided me with hand sanitizer. \n18. I received one cloth mask about three weeks ago. I have not received a replacement.  I have \nwashed the mask as best I can in the sink in my cell. \n19. I have never been given gloves. \n20. On April 16, 2020, the officers took 3 men off the block on stretchers and took 4 men off \nthe block in wheelchairs. They all looked really sick. They were brought back onto the \nblock after a few hours. I have no idea if they were tested for coronavirus and no one has \ntold us anything about whether these men were tested. \n21. Two  men  on  the  block  said  that  they  had  been  tested  and  tested  positive  for  the \ncoronavirus.  They are still on my block and come out of their cells with others. \n22. I hear men and officers on my block coughing and sneezing. \n23. I have not received any information on how to stay safe from the coronavirus. \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 1-6   Filed 04/20/20   Page 36 of 36\n24. I am scared I am going to get the virus and die from it. \n \nI, Susan Lin, certify that James Bethea relayed the above information to me over the phone on \nApril 17, 2020 and that he gave me permission to relay this information in a declaration signed on \nhis behalf.

July 12, 2022 \nBefore the Court is the parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement \n(the “Joint Motion”). (ECF No. 173.) Following more than two years of litigation, Plaintiffs—a \nclass of persons who are currently or will in the future be confined in the Philadelphia Department \nof Prisons (“PDP”)—and Defendants—the City of Philadelphia (“City”) and Commissioner of \nPrisons Blanche Carney—entered into arm’s length settlement negotiations that resulted in the \nexecution of a global settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”). The Court previously \ngranted preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement on April 13, 2022. (ECF No. 166.) \nAfter providing notice of the Settlement Agreement to class members, only one legitimate \nobjection was submitted. A fairness hearing was held on July 6, 2022, at which counsel for both \nparties appeared and no further objections were made. For the reasons that follow, the Joint Motion \nis granted and the Settlement Agreement is approved. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Court previously recounted the facts of this case in considerable detail and therefore \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 2 of 14\nwill not repeat them here. See Remick v. City of Phila., Civ. A. No. 20-1959, 2022 WL 742707, at \n*1-3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 11, 2022). In brief, on April 20, 2020, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants \nto compel them “to protect individuals incarcerated in the PDP from the risks of serious harm they \nface from the twin dangers of COVID-19 and prolonged isolation in their cells.” (ECF No. 132 at \n6 (citing ECF No. 1).) Over the ensuing two years, inter alia, the Court issued numerous orders \nrelating to the PDP’s COVID-19 protocols and jail conditions, (see, e.g., ECF Nos. 35, 55, 58, 59, \n62, 63, 70, 74, 92, 93); Plaintiffs filed two contested motions for contempt, (ECF Nos. 71, 73, 113, \n119, 124), both of which were resolved via settlement; and Defendants filed a contested motion to \nvacate one of the Court’s orders, (ECF Nos. 118, 127), which was also resolved via settlement. All \nthe while, the Court and the parties held biweekly status conferences, and the parties regularly \nsubmitted status reports, declarations from incarcerated persons, certifications from prison staff, \nand information relating to COVID-19 infection and vaccination rates at PDP facilities.  \nMore recently, on January 7, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n(ECF No. 128.) Plaintiffs thereafter filed their Third Amended Motion to Certify Class on January \n28, 2022, (ECF No. 132), and Third Amended Complaint on February 22, 2022. (ECF No. 147.) \nDefendants moved to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint on February 25, 2022. (ECF No. \n148.) On March 11, 2022, the Court certified a 23(b)(2) class. (ECF Nos. 152-53.) The class \ncomprises “[a]ll persons who are currently or will be in the future confined in the [PDP], and are \nor will be subjected to illegal or unconstitutional conditions of confinement as a result of policies \nand restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PDP’s staffing \nshortage.”  Remick,  2022  WL  742707,  at  *5.  The  Court  scheduled  a  hearing  on  Plaintiffs’ \npreliminary injunction motion for March 29, 2022.   \nWhile  these  motions  were  pending,  the  parties  entered  into  arm’s  length  settlement \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 3 of 14\nnegotiations. On March 28, 2022, the Court rescheduled the preliminary injunction hearing for \nApril 25 after the parties informed the Court of their initial successes. (ECF No. 164.) Two weeks \nlater, on April 12, 2022, the parties submitted a joint motion for the preliminary approval of the \nSettlement  Agreement.  (ECF  No.  165.)  The  Court  preliminarily  approved  the  Settlement \nAgreement on April 13, 2022 and scheduled a fairness hearing for July 6, 2022. (ECF No. 166.) \nDuring the fairness hearing, counsel for both Plaintiffs and Defendants further voiced their \napproval of the Settlement Agreement. \nUnder the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the City will: (1) implement measures to \nenhance the hiring and retention of correctional officers, including by issuing signing and retention \nbonuses; (2) provide incarcerated persons with greater amounts of out-of-cell time on a schedule \nwith graduated increases; (3) increase capacity for in-person visits and develop a plan for return to \npre-pandemic programming; (4) continue to ensure adequate and timely medical and mental health \ntreatment, including by expanding mental health programming and reducing backlogs for medical \nappointments; (5) ensure compliance with individuals’ due process rights during disciplinary \nproceedings; (6) expand phone and tablet access; (7) continue the implementation of a lock \nreplacement program and implement refresher training on the emergency call button system; (8) \ncontinue to follow COVID-19-related protocols to ensure incarcerated persons are available for \ncourt  and  meetings  with  attorneys,  including  by  testing  incarcerated  persons  before  court \nappearances; and (9) provide refresher training on the PDP’s use of force policy. (ECF No. 173 \nEx. A.) Defendants also agreed to withdraw their Petition for Permission to Appeal this Court’s \nClass Certification Order, which is currently pending in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. (Id.) \nThe Settlement Agreement further provides for the Court’s appointment of a monitor (the \n“Monitor”) to assist the Court and the parties in implementing the Settlement Agreement for a \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 4 of 14\nperiod of two years. (Id.) The parties recommended, and the Court approved and appointed, \nCathleen Beltz as the Monitor on May 25, 2022. (ECF No. 169.) \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nThe law encourages the settlement of civil actions—particularly class actions—in federal \ncourts. In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 535 (3d Cir. 2004); see also In re \nGen. Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 784 (3d Cir. 1995) \n(“[T]he law favors settlement, particularly in  class actions and other  complex cases  where \nsubstantial judicial resources can be conserved by avoiding formal litigation.”). Nevertheless, the \ndecision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action is left to the sound discretion \nof the district court. Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153, 156 (3d Cir. 1975). “Under [Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e)] the district court acts as a fiduciary who must serve as a guardian of the rights of absent \nclass members.” Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 785. “The claims, issues, or defenses of a certified \nclass . . . may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s approval.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). A court may only issue its approval upon a finding that the settlement \nagreement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). \nTo guide district courts considering approval of class action settlements, the Third Circuit \nhas adopted a nine-factor test, referred to as the Girsh test. Under the Girsh test, the Court \nconsiders: (1) the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the \nclass to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; \n(4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of \nmaintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater \nsettlement; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best possible recovery; \nand (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 5 of 14\nGirsh, 521 F.2d at 157. \nThe Third Circuit subsequently expanded upon the Girsh factors to enumerate several \npermissive factors, known as the Prudential factors, including: (1) the maturity of the underlying \nsubstantive  issues;  (2)  the  existence  and  probable  outcome  of  claims  by  other  classes  and \nsubclasses; (3) the comparison between the results achieved by the settlement for individual class \nor subclass members and the results achieved—or likely to be achieved—for other claimants; (4) \nwhether class or subclass members are accorded the right to opt out of the settlement; (5) whether \nany provisions for attorneys’ fees are reasonable; and (6) whether the procedure for processing \nindividual claims under the settlement is fair and reasonable. In re Prudential Ins. Co., 148 F.3d \n283, 323 (3d Cir. 1998). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nHere, the Court finds that the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. It \naddresses the relevant Girsh and Prudential factors in turn. \nA.  Presumption of Fairness \nAt the outset, the Court will afford the Settlement Agreement a presumption of fairness. \nThe Third Circuit applies “an initial presumption of fairness in reviewing a class settlement when: \n(1) the negotiations occurred at arms [sic] length; (2) there was sufficient discovery; (3) the \nproponents of the settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small fraction of \nthe class objected.” In re Nat’l Football League Players Concussion Injury Litig., 821 F.3d 410, \n436 (3d Cir. 2016). The Settlement Agreement fulfills all four factors. \nFirst, the parties engaged in arm’s length negotiations. The Court was apprised of the \nparties’ settlement progress during several of its biweekly conference calls with the parties. \nInformal  settlement  discussions  occurred  between  the  parties  throughout  the  course  of  the \n5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 6 of 14\nlitigation. Progress accelerated in February and March 2022 as the preliminary injunction hearing \napproached. Between then and mid-April 2022, the parties partook in frequent meetings, reaching \n95% completion of a settlement agreement by the end of March and hammering out the remaining \ndetails over the ensuing weeks. \nSecond, there was sufficient discovery. The parties have engaged in significant informal \nand formal discovery, including: Defendants providing Plaintiffs and the Court with weekly \nreports concerning, e.g., staff absenteeism, out-of-cell time, incarcerated persons’ access to court \nhearings, COVID-19 positivity rates among both staff and incarcerated persons, and vaccination \nrates among both staff and incarcerated persons; the parties engaging in document production; and \nPlaintiffs deposing the PDP’s Chief of Medical Operations. \nThird, both parties are represented by reasonable counsel possessing significant experience \nin prisoner rights litigation and class actions. Class counsel in particular consists of two non-profit \norganizations, the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project and the Abolitionist Law Center, in \naddition to the law firm Kairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg & Lin LLP, all of which are \nregularly on the forefront of the most pressing civil rights issues in both our state and nation. The \nclass is also represented by Dechert LLP, a highly revered global law firm based in Philadelphia \nwith extensive complex litigation experience. \nFourth,  and  as  discussed  further  below,  counsel  only  received  one  objection  to  the \nSettlement Agreement. \nThe Court therefore concludes that a presumption of fairness is warranted here. \nB.  The Girsh Factors \nThe Court finds that the relevant Girsh factors, taken together, weigh in favor of approval \nof the Settlement Agreement. \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 7 of 14\n1.  The complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation \nThe Court finds that the first Girsh factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. The first \nGirsh factor “captures the probable costs, in both time and money, of continued litigation.” \nWarfarin, 391 F.3d at 535-36. Here, the litigation has already spanned more than two years; were \nthe claims in this case to proceed (notwithstanding the Court’s decision on Defendants’ pending \nmotion to dismiss), the parties would be required to conduct full-scale, exhaustive, and costly \nmerits discovery. Further, the size of the class, the underlying claims addressing complex issues \nsuch as medical care—necessitating expert witnesses—and the extent of the injunctive relief \nsought all contribute to the complexity of this case. Courts in this Circuit have historically found \ncomparable litigation addressing prison policies and procedures to be sufficiently complex to \nweigh in favor of settlement approval. See, e.g., Woods v. Marler, Civ. A. No. 17-4443, 2018 WL \n11355449, at *2 n.3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 24, 2018); Williams v. City of Phila., Civ. A. No. 08-1979, \n2011 WL 3471261, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 8, 2011); Inmates of Northumberland Cnty. Prison v. \nReish, Civ. A. No. 08-345, 2011 WL 1627951, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 29, 2011). \nThus, the first factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. \n2.  The reaction of the class to the settlement \nThe Court finds that the second Girsh factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. The \nsecond Girsh factor calls for the Court to “attempt[] to gauge whether members of the class support \nthe settlement by considering the number of objectors . . . and the substance of any objection.” \nSullivan v. DB Inves., Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 321 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting Prudential, 148 F.3d at 318) \n(quotation marks omitted). Here, counsel for the parties received letters regarding the Settlement \nAgreement from fifty-six of the approximately 4,100 persons incarcerated at PDP facilities. \nFollowing a review of the letters, the Court has determined that only one constitutes an actual \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 8 of 14\nobjection to the Settlement Agreement. The author of this letter felt as though litigation might \nachieve  longer-lasting  change  at  PDP  than  settlement.  The  author,  however,  justified  this \ncontention by citing to issues that are already addressed by the Settlement Agreement. \nThe remainder of the letters discussed what the authors asserted is the ongoing state of \ndisrepair and unlivable conditions at PDP facilities, which the Settlement Agreement is designed \nto ameliorate. Some of those letters also expressed disappointment at not receiving monetary \ndamages, but a Rule 23(b)(2) class is not the appropriate vehicle to pursue those damages. A low \nnumber  of  objectors  compared  to  the  potential  number  of  class  members  creates  a  strong \npresumption in favor of approving a settlement. See Inmates of Northumberland Cnty. Prison, \n2011 WL 1627951, at *3 (approving settlement agreement where four comments were received \nout of 200 class members and where none of the four objected to the terms of the settlement); \nBoone v. City of Phila., 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 712 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (approving settlement agreement \nwhere three objections were received from a potential class of 37,000 members). \nThus, the second factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. \n3.  The stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed \nThe Court finds that the third Girsh factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. The third \nGirsh factor “captures the degree of case development that class counsel have accomplished prior \nto  settlement.  Through  this  lens,  courts  can  determine  whether  counsel  had  an  adequate \nappreciation of the merits of the case before negotiating.” Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 813. \nHere, the extensiveness of discovery and motion practice, coupled with the protracted \npretrial stage of these proceedings, demonstrates a well-informed decision to settle this action. \nThis case has developed considerably over the past two years. The parties engaged in significant \ndiscovery, both in connection with Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction and Court orders \n8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 9 of 14\nmandating the weekly exchange of data and reports on PDP conditions. The parties have also \nengaged in extensive motion practice, filing and responding to multiple motions for preliminary \ninjunctions, motions for class certification, and motions for contempt, as well as a motion to \ndismiss and a motion to compel. See Pack v. Beyer, Civ. A. No. 91-3709, 1995 WL 775360, at *4 \n(D.N.J. Dec. 22, 1995) (finding that the “substantial discovery and motion practice . . . conducted” \nsignifies that “the parties have a clear understanding of the facts underlying this case, as well as \nthe strengths and weaknesses of the arguments” and “that the settlement has been fully and fairly \nnegotiated”). \nThus, the third factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. \n4.  The risks of establishing liability \nThe Court finds that the fourth Girsh factor weighs slightly in favor of settlement approval. \nIn examining this factor, the Court “give[s] credence to the estimation of the probability of success \nproffered by class counsel, who are experienced with the underlying case, and the possible \ndefenses which may be raised to their causes of action.” Lachance v. Harrington, 965 F. Supp. \n630, 638 (E.D. Pa. 1997). “By evaluating the risks of establishing liability, the district court can \nexamine what the potential rewards (or downside) of litigation might have been had class counsel \nelected to litigate the claims rather than settle them.” Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 814.  \nHere, the Court finds that Settlement Agreement’s comprehensiveness in providing relief \nto class members does away with many of the risks inherent in a complex prison civil rights \nlitigation of this sort. Although, in weighing acceptance of the Settlement Agreement with the \nprospect of litigation, “there is no assurance that the relief would be greater or different than the \nrelief provided by [the proposed agreement],” Harris v. Reeves, 761 F. Supp. 382, 401 (E.D. Pa. \n1991), the Court joins the general sentiment of Judge Surrick, who expressed that “[i]f one were \n9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 10 of 14\nto look at the 40-year history of prison litigation involving conditions in the [Philadelphia prison \nsystem], one could conclude that Plaintiffs face no risk in establishing liability.” Williams, 2011 \nWL 3471261, at *4. In any event, the Settlement Agreement provides relief for all of the issues \ndiscussed by the parties and the Court over the long course of this litigation.1  \nThus, the fourth factor weighs slightly in favor of settlement approval. \n5.  The risk of establishing damages \nThe Court finds that the fifth Girsh factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. Pursuant \nthis factor, the Court balances “the potential damage award if the case were taken to trial against \nthe benefits of an immediate settlement.” Prudential, 148 F.3d at 319. Although this class does not \nseek  monetary  damages,  courts  considering  this  Girsh  factor  in  connection  with  proposed \nsettlements for 23(b)(2) classes have noted that “the risks inherent in seeking injunctive relief are \nalways significant.” Williams, 2011 WL 3471261, at *4; see also Inmates of Northumberland Cnty. \nPrison, 2011 WL 1627951, at *3 (“With respect to the fifth factor, the risks of establishing \ndamages, we note that the parties do not seek damages but rather seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief. The risks of demonstrating the propriety of an injunction—especially an injunction of such \na grand scale as would be necessary here (and is reflected in the Proposed Settlement)—are \ngreat.”). \nThus, the fifth factor weighs in favor of settlement approval.  \n6.  The risks of maintaining the class action through trial \nThe Court finds that the sixth Girsh factor is neutral with respect to settlement approval. \n \n1 The Court also acknowledges that Defendants have reason to avoid the uncertainties of \nlitigation:  if  Plaintiffs  succeeded  in  establishing  liability,  the  Court  would  have  significant \ndiscretion in fashioning injunctive relief. The Settlement Agreement affords Defendants greater \ncontrol in determining what terms they feel are most appropriate to manage PDP facilities. \n10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 11 of 14\nThe sixth Girsh factor considers the risks of maintaining a class action throughout the litigation. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23 allows district courts to “decertify or modify a class at any time during the \nlitigation if it proves to be unmanageable.” Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321. Thus, “[t]here will always \nbe a ‘risk’ or possibility of decertification.” Id. But beyond the invariable risk of decertification, \nand  absent  a  decision  by  the  Third  Circuit  on  Defendants’  petition  appealing  this  Court’s \ncertification decision, neither party points to any specific reason that decertification is likely to \noccur here. To the extent individuals continuously enter and leave PDP custody, the fluidity of the \nclass weighs in favor of settlement approval. Overall, however, the Court agrees with the parties \nthat this factor is neutral. \n7.  The seventh, eighth, and ninth Girsh factors \nThis action was certified pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief only. The \nseventh, eighth, and ninth Girsh factors involve monetary judgments and settlement funds. They \ntherefore do not apply here. See Inmates of Northumberland Cnty. Prison, 2011 WL 1627951, at \n*3. \nThus, the totality of the Girsh factors weigh in favor of the Court’s approval of the \nSettlement Agreement. \nC.  The Prudential Factors \nThe  Court  finds  that  the  applicable  Prudential  factors  weigh  in  favor  of  settlement \napproval. The factors “identified in Prudential are illustrative of additional inquiries that in many \ninstances will be useful for a thoroughgoing analysis of a settlement’s terms.” In re Pet Food \nProds. Liab. Litig., 629 F.3d 333, 350 (3d Cir. 2010). Since this class does not seek monetary \ndamages, only two factors are relevant here: the maturity of the underlying substantive issues, and \nwhether any provisions for attorneys’ fees are reasonable. First, at the time the Settlement \n11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 12 of 14\nAgreement was executed, and as discussed above, extensive discovery and motion practice had \nbeen completed, meaning that the “underlying substantive issues” were “matur[e]” and class \ncounsel had a strong “ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits.” See \nPrudential, 148 F.3d at 323. \nSecond, the attorneys’ fees and costs provided for in the Settlement Agreement are fair and \nreasonable. The parties have settled their claim for attorneys’ fees and costs for $340,000.00. The \nCivil Rights Attorneys’ Fees Awards Act of 1976 (“Fees Act”) provides that prevailing plaintiffs \nare entitled to claim reasonable attorneys’ fees in civil rights cases, and “strong federal policy \nembodied in the Fees Act normally requires an award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights \nactions, including those who have prevailed through settlement.” Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, \n724-25 (1986); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1988. “The initial estimate of a reasonable attorney’s fee is \nproperly calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation \ntimes a reasonable hourly rate.” Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 94 (1989) (quoting Blum v. \nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 888 (1984)) (quotation marks omitted). The parties both represent that, \n“[e]ven with attorney rates limited by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, the agreed-upon figure is \na significant reduction in attorneys’ fees compared to the fees that could be assessed through a fee \npetition due to the significant number of hours expended in the litigation.” (ECF No. 173 at 17.) \nFurther, the attorneys’ fees here are comparable to attorneys’ fees agreed upon and approved in \nother analogous class action suits. See Inmates of Northumberland Cnty. Prison, 2011 WL \n1627951, at *3 (finding attorneys’ fees of $300,000 to be fair and reasonable). \nTherefore, the totality of the relevant Prudential factors weighs in favor of the Court’s \napproval of the Settlement Agreement. \n \n12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 13 of 14\nD.  Notice to Class Members \nFinally, the Court finds that notice of the Settlement Agreement provided to class members \nwas adequate. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) requires that notice of settlement be afforded to class members. \nThe court has broad discretion in determining the timing and manner of the notice. Harris, 761 F. \nSupp. at 393. Here, notice was provided to class members by posting information regarding the \nSettlement Agreement in all PDP housing areas, at the law libraries, and on PDP tablets. (See ECF \nNo. 173 Exs. B-C.) Plaintiffs’ counsel also provided class members with copies of the Settlement \nAgreement upon request. This method of providing notice comports with that approved by courts \nin analogous litigations. The Court acknowledges the impractical nature of providing individual \nnotice to class members, since the class comprises many thousands of members, as well as many \nunidentifiable members, i.e., individuals who will be incarcerated at PDP facilities in the future. \nSee Harris, 761 F. Supp. at 393. Accordingly, courts in this Circuit have widely recognized that \nposting notices at prison facilities is the best way to inform class members of a pending settlement \nagreement. See, e.g., id.; Woods v. Marler, Civ. A. No. 17-4443, 2018 WL 11355449, at *1-2 (E.D. \nPa. Sept. 24, 2018); Inmates of Northumberland Cnty. Prison, 2011 WL 1627951, at *2. That was \ndone here. \nTherefore, adequate notice was provided to class members pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e). \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn sum, the Court finds that a balancing of the relevant Girsh and Prudential factors weighs \nheavily in favor of approval of the Settlement Agreement. It is a vast understatement to say that \nthis litigation was toilsome and trying—both in terms of workload and emotional taxation, given \nthe gravity of the issues facing class members—forcing counsel to navigate through uncharted and \n13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 175   Filed 07/12/22   Page 14 of 14\nunprecedented times as the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the PDP. While it is certainly too soon \nto declare the COVID-19 pandemic “over,” the Court genuinely applauds counsel and their \ndexterous work at bringing the formal components of this litigation to a close. It is apparent that \nthe parties have a plan in place to confront the, at times, unfathomably harrowing conditions at the \nPDP. The Court is further comforted by the appointment of Ms. Beltz—as skillful and experienced \nas they come—as the Monitor, and the Court looks forward to working with her to implement the \nSettlement Agreement and actively keep tabs on the PDP over the next few years. The Settlement \nAgreement also provides an avenue for Plaintiffs to return to this Court should conditions at PDP \nstagnate or deteriorate.  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court is satisfied that the Settlement Agreement is fair, \nreasonable, and adequate. The Court therefore grants the Joint Motion and approves the Settlement \nAgreement. An Order consistent with this Memorandum will be docketed separately.   \n14 ",

Staff Testing  \nThe Philadelphia Department of Prisons (“PDP”) is directed to perform one-time COVID-\n19 testing of all staff, including correctional officers and supervisors.  PDP is also directed to \nperform one-time COVID-19 testing of all contractors who have routine access to the PDP \nfacilities.  PDP is permitted to schedule this testing in a manner that is consistent with safety and \nsecurity operational needs, but the one-time testing shall be completed by January 15, 2021.  The \nPDP shall report the results of staff testing to the Court and parties immediately upon its receipt of \nthe results.  The results of staff testing shall remain sealed until January 25, 2021, after which the \nresults shall be unsealed.  The parties may agree to release the results of the staff testing prior to \nJanuary 25, 2021. To the extent any party seeks to publicize the results, they shall first advise the \nopposing party of their intention and any objection to publication shall be raised with the Court. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 55   Filed 12/18/20   Page 2 of 4\nBased on the results of these tests, and other relevant conditions at the PDP relating to COVID-\n19, and after considering further submissions by the parties, the Court may consider the issue of \nfurther testing of staff on a periodic basis. \n2.  Access to Counsel:  \nPDP shall provide means for lawyers to access their clients by electronic communications \non a system that allows the attorney to share documents for the client’s review through March 31, \n2021, at which time the parties and the Court may review access to counsel issues and consider \nextending or modifying this provision. \n3.  Universal testing of all incarcerated people for COVID-19. \nPDP shall immediately begin testing all incarcerated persons at PDP facilities for COVID-\n19 with the goal of completing that testing no later than January 15, 2021, and shall thereafter \nreport to Plaintiffs’ counsel and the Court the results of these tests by the housing areas in all \nfacilities of the PDP, including, for each housing unit, the total number of people tested and the \nnumbers of positive and negative results.  Based on the results of these tests, and other relevant \nconditions at the PDP relating to COVID-19, and after considering any further submissions by the \nparties, the Court may consider the issue of further testing of incarcerated persons on a periodic \nbasis. \n4.  Ensuring adequate out-of-cell time for all incarcerated people:  \na.  While PDP  facilities remain in  “shelter-in-place”,  and pending the  results of \nuniversal testing required under ¶¶ 1 and 3, the PDP shall ensure that all incarcerated persons are \npermitted a daily minimum of forty-five (45) minutes of time out of their cells for showering, \nphone calls, and exercise, subject to further court order increasing out-of-cell time at the point \nwhen shelter-in-place is no longer in effect.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 55   Filed 12/18/20   Page 3 of 4\nb.  PDP shall, no later than December 28, 2020, submit to Plaintiffs’ counsel and the \nCourt an operational plan for each facility and housing area demonstrating the necessary staffing \nand other logistical support to ensure compliance with this Order and the Court’s Consent Order \nof June 3, 2020 (ECF No. 35). \n5.  Written certification from Deputy Wardens to ensure compliance: \na.  Beginning no later than the week of December 28, 2020, on a weekly basis, the \nPDP shall provide to Plaintiffs’ counsel signed certifications by a Deputy Warden for each facility \nwithin the PDP, certifying that: \ni.  All unit managers in their respective facilities have directly informed the \nDeputy Warden of the time, place, and manner of compliance with all relevant sections of this \nOrder and the Court’s Consent Order of June 3, 2020 (ECF No. 35), regarding delivery of soap, \nmasks, and cleaning agents, and provision of out-of-cell time to all incarcerated persons in their \nhousing units;  \nii.  All unit managers have been informed that this protocol is required by a \nfederal court Order, and that any false reporting is subject to potential sanctions by the Court; and   \niii.  The Deputy Warden has visited at least one housing area, chosen on a \nrandom basis each week, and discussed directly with incarcerated persons housed on that area \ncompliance with this Order and the Court’s June 3, 2020 Order.  \nb.  The parties shall report to the Court one month after the provisions of this paragraph \nhave been implemented on whether this certification process has been successful in improving \ncompliance with Court-ordered measures. If, after implementation of the certification process, the \nCourt again receives conflicting and unverifiable reports of compliance levels from the parties, the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 55   Filed 12/18/20   Page 4 of 4\nCourt may consider whether to appoint an Independent Monitor to ensure substantial compliance \nwith the Court’s Orders. \nBY THE COURT: \n/s/ Berle M.

Dkt. 1. That same day, Plaintiffs filed a \nmotion for class certification (“Motion”). Dkt. 2. In their Motion, Plaintiffs seek to have the Court \nenter  an  order  certifying  their  proposed  class  (“Class”),  as  well  as  two  subclasses  (the \n“Subclasses”), including the Medically-Vulnerable Subclass. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 3 of 13\nFor the following reasons, Defendants, the City of Philadelphia and Commissioner Blanch \nCarney (“Defendants”), oppose the certification of the Class and both the Medically-Vulnerable \nand Disability Subclasses.  \nI.  ARGUMENT \nDefendants have filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining order. \nDkt. 22 (“Opposition”). For the sake of brevity, the Defendants incorporate these facts by reference \nand rely upon them as if restated herein. \nThe requirements for  class certification are outlined  in Rule 23(a). Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; \nAmchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613–14 (1997). “Unless each requirement of Rule \n23 is actually met, a class cannot be certified.” In re Schering Plough Corp. ERISA Litig., 589 F.3d \n585, 596 (3d Cir.2009). “As a result, ‘[a]n overlap between a class certification requirement and \nthe merits of a claim is no reason to decline to resolve relevant disputes when necessary to \ndetermine whether a class certification requirement is met.’” Id. (quoting Beck v. Maximus, 457 \nF.3d 291, 301 (3d Cir.2006)). The Court must therefore conduct a “rigorous analysis” to determine \nwhether the prerequisites of Rule 23 have been satisfied, going beyond the pleadings if necessary. \nId.; Williams v. City of Philadelphia, 270 F.R.D. 208, 213 (E.D. Pa. 2010). \nRule 23(a) requires that the movant demonstrate the following for certification: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class, and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass. \n \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Because Plaintiffs seek class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), they must \nalso establish that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 4 of 13\ngenerally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). \nA “decision to certify a class calls for findings by the court, not merely a ‘threshold \nshowing’ by a party, that each requirement of Rule 23 is met.” In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust \nLitig., 552 F.3d 305, 307 (3d Cir. 2008). Rather, “[t]he party seeking certification bears the burden \nof establishing each element of Rule 23 by a preponderance of the evidence” and “actual, not \npresumed, conformance with Rule 23 requirements is essential.” Marcus v. BMW of N. Am., LLC, \n687 F.3d 583, 591 (3d Cir. 2012) (internal quotations omitted). “To determine whether there is \nactual conformance with Rule 23, a district court must conduct a ‘rigorous analysis’ of the evidence \nand arguments put forth.” Id.  \nIndeed, “[a] class certification decision requires a thorough examination of the factual and \nlegal allegations” contained in the complaint, and “it may be necessary for the court to probe \nbehind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.” Newton v. Merrill Lynch, \nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 166 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., \n161 F.3d 127, 140 (3d Cir. 1998); General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 \n(1982)).  In  essence,  “the  task  for  plaintiffs  at  class  certification  is  to  demonstrate  [by  a \npreponderance of the evidence] that the elements of their claims are capable of proof at trial \nthrough evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members.” Stanford v. \nFoamex, 263 F.R.D. 156, 163 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (quoting In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., \n552 F.3d at 317 (internal marks omitted)). The Third Circuit has made clear that Rule 23 gives no \nlicense to shy away from making factual findings that are necessary to determine whether the \nRule’s requirements have been met.” Marcus, 687 F.3d at 591.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 5 of 13\n  As to the Class, Defendants do not challenge that Plaintiffs have satisfied the elements of \nnumerosity and typicality. However, Plaintiffs are unable to establish the elements of commonality \nand  representation.  Nor  are  Plaintiffs’  able  to  satisfy  the  elements  of  commonality  or \nrepresentation  as  to  the  Medically-Vulnerable  or  Disability  Subclasses.  Finally,  denial  of \nPlaintiffs’ Motion is warranted because Plaintiffs have failed to establish that Defendants acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the Class.  \nA.  Plaintiff Fails to Establish Elements Necessary to Certify the Class \n \nPlaintiffs cannot establish either the elements of commonality or representation as to the Class. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Fail to Establish Commonality as to the Class \n \nPlaintiff asserts the following common questions of law and fact: \n•  whether PDP’s facilities are properly equipped to house all Class members safely \nand quarantine all Class members who exhibit symptoms for COVID-19;  \n•  whether denial of adequate testing, cleaning supplies, and the right to practice social \ndistancing  in  accordance with CDC guidelines will cause injury to the Class \nmembers, including unnecessary pain and suffering, and even death; and  \n•  whether  PDP’s  current  practices  and  procedures  violate  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, the Eighth Amendment, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nMotion at ¶6. Because these issues require individualized analysis as to each purported class \nmember, Plaintiffs cannot establish the element of commonality. \nAs an initial matter,  Plaintiffs have sought relief for  alleged  Fourteenth  and Eighth \nAmendments violations pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. However, Section 2241 is the appropriate \nmechanism by which a pre-trial detainee may challenge state custody. Paladino v. King, Civ. No. \n07–370, 2008 WL 1820666, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2008) (Schiller, J., adopting Report and \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 6 of 13\nRecommendation of Restrepo, M.J.). Title 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is actually the appropriate mechanism \nby which an individual “in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court” may seek relief. Id. \n(internal citation omitted). Plaintiff fails to assert a claim under Section 2254, thus any putative \nClass members who have already been convicted, such as Plaintiffs Remick and Bethea, must seek \nrelief under Section 2254, not Section 2241.  \nFurther, Plaintiffs allege that that there is a common question of law or fact including \nwhether PPD facilities are properly equipped to safely handle all class member who exhibit \nsymptoms;  whether  the  denial  of  testing,  cleaning  or  social  distancing;  etc.  amount  to  a \nconstitutional violation. While Plaintiffs attempt to assert a blanket challenge under the Eighth \nAmendment concerning an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19, Plaintiffs’ claims do not \nactually concern a single, unified policy or issue. Rather, Plaintiffs have identified a plethora of \npolicies and practices that they assert all touch on the issue of infection in some degree including, \nbut not limited to, facility population, quarantine policies, social distancing policies, provision of \nsoap and/or cleaning materials, and provision of personal protective equipment. Compare Stewart \nv. Winter, 669 F.2d 328, 338 (5th Cir. 1982) (declining to find a common question of fact or law \nas to eight (8) plaintiffs spread across different facilities); with, Baby Neal for & by Kanter v. \nCasey, 43 F.3d 48, 62 (3d Cir. 1994) (allowing claims to proceed where conditions concerned \nunified  system  and  statutory  standards  unlike  individualized  Eighth  Amendment  analysis); \nWilliams,  270  F.R.D.  at  215  (assessing  whether  single  issue  of  overcrowding  in  facilities \nconstituted violation). Additionally, there are significant variances within each of the four (4) PDP \nfacilities at issue that preclude a blanket analysis of Plaintiffs’ claims: from layout (individual cells \nv. dorms; personal sinks or toilets; types of showers), to facility capacity and population, to security \nlevels and inmate disciplinary issues.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 7 of 13\nAs recognized by the very Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) guidelines Plaintiffs rely \nupon, specific practices “may need to be adapted based on individual facilities’ physical space, \nstaffing,  population,  operations,  and  other  resources  and  conditions.”1  Further,  the  CDC \nacknowledged that administrators and agencies “should adapt these guiding principles to the \nspecific needs of their facilities.” Id. at p.3. Compliance with CDC guidelines or general best \npractices for a correctional facility is an inherently individualized and fact specific assessment.  \nAs such, the issue here of whether an individual is being subject to conditions that violate \nthe Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments is specific if not to each inmate, at a minimum to each \nfacility. The Court is unable to make a determination as to the PDP in general, but must make a \n“separate inquiry into the ‘totality’ of conditions in each jail.” Stewart, 669 F.2d at 338.  \n2.  Plaintiffs are Not Adequate Class Representatives \nNor have Plaintiffs established that they are adequate class representatives. In a conditions \nof confinement case, a plaintiff who has been released from confinement within the subject facility \nis  not  an  adequate  class  representative.  Parsons  v.  Ryan,  289  F.R.D.  513,  524  (D.  Ariz. \n2013), aff'd, 754  F.3d  657  (9th  Cir.  2014)  (holding  that  plaintiff’s  release  “undermines  his \nadequacy as a Class representative and he will be dismissed”). Plaintiffs have failed to make any \nshowing as to the adequacy of the Plaintiffs as representative of the class. Defendants are aware \nthat at least one Plaintiff, Michael Dantzler, has been released. See Criminal Docket, Inmate \nLocater Results, attached respectively as Exhibits A & B. Plaintiff Dantzler is therefore no longer \nan adequate Class representative. To the extent additional Plaintiffs have been released, they are \n \n1Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and \nDetention  Facilities  at  p.1,  3  (emphasis  not  included),  available \nathttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html (last viewed Apr. 30, 2020). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 8 of 13\nsimilarly no longer adequate class representatives. Given that Plaintiffs have failed to make a \nshowing that the individual Plaintiffs are adequate class representatives, Plaintiffs’ Motion must \nfail. See Stanford, 263 F.R.D. at 163. \nB.  Plaintiff Fails to Establish Elements Necessary to Certify the Subclasses \n \nPlaintiff  also  seeks to  certify  two (2) Subclasses. The first  subclass (the Medically-\nVulnerable Subclass) includes the following categories of individuals: \nAll current and future persons in the custody of the Philadelphia Department of \nPrisons who are 55 or older, as well as all current and future persons held of any \nage who have a medical condition that places them at increased risk of COVID-19 \nillness, injury, or death, including but not limited to: (a) lung disease, including \nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis or emphysema), or \nother chronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, \nsuch  as  congenital  heart  disease,  congestive  heart  failure,  or  coronary  artery \ndisease;  (c)  chronic  liver  or  kidney  disease  (including  hepatitis  and  dialysis \npatients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) epilepsy; (f) hypertension; \n(g) compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ \nor bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune \ndisease); (h) blood disorders (including sickle cell disease); (i) inherited metabolic \ndisorders; (j) history of stroke; (k) a developmental disability; and/or (l) a current \nor recent (last two weeks) pregnancy. \n \nMotion at ¶2. \n  The  second  subclass  (the  Disability  Subclass)  includes  the  following  categories  of \nindividuals: \nAll current and future persons in the custody of the Philadelphia Department of \nPrisons who have an impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major \nlife activities and who are at increased risk of COVID-19 illness, injury, or death \ndue to their disability or any medical treatment necessary to treat their disability, \nincluding but not limited to those who have: (a) lung disease, including asthma, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis or emphysema), or other \nchronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such \nas congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease; (c) \nchronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) \ndiabetes  or  other  endocrine  disorders;  (e)  epilepsy;  (f)  hypertension;  (g) \ncompromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or \nbone marrow transplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune \ndisease); (h) blood disorders and/or (i) developmental disability. \n \nMotion at ¶3. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 9 of 13\nFor the same reasons articulated above that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy commonality as to the \nClass, Plaintiffs also fail to satisfy commonality as to the Subclasses. Further, even if the Court \nwere to certify subclasses for Plaintiff’s condition of confinement claim, the Court should deny \ncertification of the Medically-Vulnerable Subclass to the extent Plaintiffs seek the relief of release \nas Plaintiffs cannot meet the commonality element of this subclass. Cmplt. at ¶67(d)(i). Further, \nPlaintiffs fail to establish that they are adequate representative as to either Subclass. \n1.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established Commonality as to the Medically-\nVulnerable Subclass \n \n  Commonality requires at least one question common to all of the class members, the answer \nto which is “apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 350 (2011). While multiple questions might bear on the claims asserted by the individuals \ncomprising the Medically-Vulnerable Subclass, the only question is whether the individual, by \nvirtue of their medical issues, is entitled to release given the threat of infection. When an inmate \nis seeking release through injunctive relief “the public interest—which must be taken into account \nwhen considering a TRO or preliminary injunction—mandates individualized consideration of any \ninmate’s suitability for release and on what conditions, for the safety of the inmate, the inmate’s \nfamily, and the public at large.” Money v. Pritzker, No. 20-CV-2093, 2020 WL 1820660, at *14 \n(N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020).  \n“By its very nature, the process would entail a highly individualized inquiry that is ill-\nsuited to class treatment. Simply put, there is no way to decide which inmates should stay, and \nwhich inmates should go, without diving into an inmate-specific inquiry.” Id. at *15. For instance, \nmultiple Plaintiffs are awaiting trial for or are serving sentences for a variety of violent crimes \nincluding, but not limited to, carjacking/robbery, aggravated assault, strangulation, and third-\ndegree murder. Releasing individuals accused of and even convicted of similar charges could \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 10 of 13\npresent a threat to the population at large. Id. at *20. Similarly, release of individuals who may \nhave been exposed during incarceration would present a potential risk to the public. Id. at *19. \nOnly an individual analysis of each class member could determine if release is warranted.  \nFurther, because Plaintiffs seek relief under Section 2241, each member of the subclass \nwould need to establish that they had met the exhaustion requirements of Section 2241. This Court \nhas recognized “habeas corpus petitions brought under § 2241 are subject to the Rules Governing \n§ 2254 cases in the United States District Courts pursuant to Rule 1(b) of the habeas rules.” O'Neal \nv. Levi, 551 F. Supp. 2d 379, 387 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (citations omitted). Therefore, all plaintiffs – \nregardless  of  whether  a  pre-trial  or  convicted  –  are  subject  to  the  state  court  exhaustion \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A). See Coady v. Vaughn, 251 F.3d 480, 488 (3d. Cir. \n2001) (“While exhaustion is mandated by Section 2254, it ‘has developed through decisional law \n. . . as to claims brought under 20 U.S.C. § 2241.’”) (quoting Schandelmeier v. Cunningham, 819 \nF.2d 52, 53 (3d Cir. 1986)); Moore v. DeYoung, 515 F.2d 437, 441-42 (3d Cir. 1975) (no \ndistinction between § 2254 and § 2241 “insofar as the exhaustion requirement is concerned”); Ross \nv. McCafferty, No. CV 19-4663, 2019 WL 7756074, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 13, 2019), report and \nrecommendation adopted sub nom. Ross v. McCaffery, No. CV 19-4663, 2020 WL 419467 (E.D. \nPa. Jan. 24, 2020) (“The exhaustion requirement applies equally to petitions filed pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 2241.”).  \nMoreover, any such mass release of prisoners based upon conditions of confinement – \nabsent the employment of appropriate procedure, including, but not limited to, a three-judge panel \n– would be violative of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”). See generally, 18 U.S.C. § \n3626. The PLRA incorporates the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3626. Pursuant to Section 3626, \nPlaintiffs would first have to seek an order for less intrusive relief and provide Defendants a \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 11 of 13\nreasonable amount of time to comply such order. Even if Defendants failed to comply with this \nless intrusive order, only a three-judge panel could consider a prisoner release order, and Plaintiffs \nwould have to prove by clear and convincing evidence that “crowding is the primary cause of the \nviolation  of  a  Federal  right”  and  “no  other  relief  will  remedy  the  violation.”  18  U.S.C. \n§3626(a)(3)(E)(i)-(ii); Brown v Plata, 563 US 493, 512 (2011). \n2.  Plaintiffs Are Not Adequate Medically-Vulnerable Subclass \nRepresentatives \n \nFor the same reasons, Plaintiffs have not established that they are adequate \nrepresentatives for the Medically-Vulnerable Subclass to the extent they seek release. In addition \nto the fact that Plaintiffs Remick and Bethea cannot proceed under Rule 2241, Plaintiffs have \nfurther not alleged nor proffered evidence to support that they have exhausted their state court \nremedies and/or satisfied the requisites of the PLRA. \nAs such, Plaintiffs cannot establish commonality as to the Medically-Vulnerable Subclass \nin seeking release. Defendants note that the same arguments apply as to the proposed Disability \nSubclass to the extent that subclass also seeks release. \nC.  Plaintiffs Fail to Show that Defendants Have Refused to Act on Grounds \nGenerally Applicable to the Alleged Class \n \nBecause they are seeking class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs must \nestablish that the “party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). For the reasons asserted in \nDefendants’ Opposition, Plaintiffs’ have failed to meet this bar. As such, Plaintiffs’ Motion fails. \nGordon v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 467 F.2d 717, 720–21 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (affirming dismissal of \nportion of complaint seeking to commence a class action). \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 24   Filed 05/04/20   Page 12 of 13\nII.

The parties agree to the terms outlined in this \nAgreement and to the entry of a Court Order approving this Agreement, as follows: \n1.  The Plaintiffs hereby withdraw the pending Plaintiffs’ Motion for Contempt and \nSanctions (ECF No. 71). \n2.  The Defendants hereby agree to make a one-time payment of $125,000, in equal \namounts of $62,500 to the Philadelphia Bail Fund and the Philadelphia Community \nBail Fund, as a non-contempt sanction for the violations of the Court's Orders on out-\nof-cell time.  \n3.  For the period of time between the date of a Court Order approving this Agreement \nand July 12, 2021, the Defendants shall make all reasonable efforts to increase out-of-\ncell times beyond those required by current Court Orders, with the ultimate goal of a \nnew schedule that would provide out-of-cell time: (a) for all vaccinated units, in the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 81-1   Filed 06/23/21   Page 2 of 3\nrange of 4.5-5.0 hours/day; (b) for other general housing units, 3.5 hours/day; (c) for \nquarantined housing units, 3 hours/day; and (d) for segregation units, 1 hour/day.  By \nJuly 6, 2021, the Defendants shall provide to Plaintiffs a report detailing all efforts \nmade to increase out-of-cell time.  \n4.  By July 12, 2021, the parties will report to the Court whether there is an agreement on \na new schedule for out-of-cell time. Any new schedule would be subject to the \n“operational” exceptions provided by current Court Orders and to Court-approved \nmodifications based on changes in infection rates.  \n5.  If the parties do not reach an agreement on a new schedule for out-of-cell time by \nJuly 12, 2021, the Court, on motion by the Plaintiffs, and after considering the \nrelevant factors, may enter an updated Order on out-of-cell time.  In the meantime, \nthe Defendants shall continue to provide to the Court and the Plaintiffs reports on \ninfection and vaccination rates and the reports of the Deputy Wardens on out-of-cell \ntime required under current Court Orders and Plaintiffs reserve the right to move for \ncontempt of court and sanctions if there is not full compliance with current Court \nOrders. \n6.  By July 20, 2021, the Defendants shall prepare a report setting forth plans for a \ngraduated return to pre-pandemic operations based on projected infection and \nvaccination rates.  Thereafter, the parties shall discuss further court orders on out-of-\ncell time, family visitation policies, and related COVID-19 policies and practices.   \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 81-1   Filed 06/23/21   Page 3 of 3\nIT IS SO AGREED: \n \n/s/ David Rudovsky      /s/ Craig M.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nPlaintiffs-Petitioners seek immediate injunctive relief due to the urgent need to remedy the \nperilous conditions of confinement in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons, which expose all \nthose incarcerated in Philadelphia’s jails to grave and unjustified risks of serious illness or death \nfrom  COVID-19.  The  extraordinary  challenges  presented  by  COVID-19  are  even  more \nextraordinary in prisons and jails. Incarcerated persons and all those who work within these \nfacilities are subject to environments that have become the unfortunate epicenters of the pandemic. \nIn the face of immediate, severe risks to the health and safety of the people within these institutions, \nthe courts must ensure that incarcerated people—many of whom are presumed innocent and \nawaiting trial or are serving short sentences for minor offenses, and are highly vulnerable to the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 2 of 27\nrisk of serious complications or death from COVID-19 due to age and/or medical conditions—are \nnot subjected to unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  \nAs this Court is aware, in the United States, there have been hundreds of thousands of \ndocumented cases of COVID-19, and tens of thousands of deaths. Compl. Ex. A, Decl. of Dr. \nJoseph J. Amon (“Amon Decl.”) (ECF 1-4) ¶ 5. Not surprisingly, given the way the virus infects \nand endangers all people, jails like those in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia have already \nbecome rife with COVID-19. Id. ¶¶ 38–39. As of the filing of Plaintiffs’ Complaint on April 20, \n2020, the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (PDP) reported that more than 120 inmates had been \ninfected with  COVID-19. Compl. (ECF 1) ¶  21.  If  additional preventive measures are not \nimplemented, the exponential increase in infections will only continue.  \nPlaintiffs and the class they seek to  represent have been  subjected to conditions  of \nconfinement which prevent them from availing themselves of the basic social distancing and \nhygiene practices which are not only critical to their health and safety, but which have been \nmandated by Defendant City of Philadelphia for everyone else in our community. The putative \nclass, consisting of all current and future persons held in custody within PDP, face ongoing \nuntenable threats to their health and safety under the present conditions. Because these conditions \nof confinement pose an imminent threat of serious disease and death for incarcerated people held \nwithin PDP’s facilities (as well as correctional officers, health workers, and other staff at PDP),1 \n                                                 \n1 Those working within the jails have also raised concerns regarding conditions within PDP's \nfacilities. Three unions, representing thousands of workers at Philadelphia jails called for judges \nto reduce the jail population as a \"common-sense measure\" to protect workers and the broader \ncommunity. Juliana Feliciano Reyes, Philly jail workers want judges to release more inmates \nbecause  of  coronavirus,  The  Philadelphia  Inquirer,  \nhttps://www.inquirer.com/jobs/labor/coronavirus-philadelphia-prisons-reduce-jail-population-\nunions-20200422.html  (April 22,2020). \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 3 of 27\nPlaintiffs are entitled to preliminary relief. In short, judicial intervention is necessary to protect \ntheir health and their lives.  \nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the virus presents difficult challenges in the jail setting, but we \nare not asking the Court to hold the defendants to an impossible bar. The standards Plaintiffs \npropose come from medical and correctional experts, including Dr. Robert L. Cohen and Dr. \nJoseph A. Amon, whose declarations have been provided to the Court.2 They in turn have consulted \nand incorporated relevant guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nThis  guidance  is  recognized  as  the  minimum  standard  for  protecting  incarcerated  persons. \nPlaintiffs’  request  for  preliminary  relief  to  remedy  Defendants’  constitutional  and  statutory \nviolations is fully consistent with the public health standards articulated by Drs. Cohen and Amon. \nImportantly, the requests for specific measures are consistent with those recently ordered by \nfederal courts in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Michigan.3 \n                                                 \n2 Dr. Cohen has served as a prison and jail medical-conditions monitor for several courts, including for the \nPhiladelphia Court of Common Pleas in the Jackson v. Hendrick class action lawsuit that concerned \nconditions of confinement in the PDP for the period 1971-2002. He was also the plaintiffs’ expert in Bowers \nv. City of Philadelphia, No. 06-cv-3229, 2007 WL 219651 (Jan. 25, 2007), and Williams v. City of \nPhiladelphia, No. 08-cv-1979. He was the Medical Director at Rikers Island in New York City from 1981 \nto 1986. Compl., Ex. B, Decl. of Dr. Robert L. Cohen (“Cohen Decl.”) (ECF 1-5), ¶ 1. Dr. Amon is an \ninfectious disease epidemiologist, Director of Global Health and Clinical Professor in the department of \nCommunity Health and Prevention at the Drexel Dornsife School of Public Health, and he has specifically \nstudied infectious disease in detention centers. Amon Decl. ¶ 1. \n3 See Banks v. Booth, 2020 WL 1914896, at *1 (D.D.C.

Plaintiffs ask \nthis Court to order the Defendants to ensure that conditions of confinement at PDP comply with \nthe health and safety standards necessary to protect the plaintiff class, and to provide humane \nconditions of confinement.  \nSecond, if Defendants do not or cannot comply with such a directive, Plaintiffs request that \nthe Court, pursuant to its jurisdiction under the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, \nand/or its injunctive powers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, order the release of a sufficient number of \nincarcerated persons to fully protect the rights of the plaintiff class to be free from unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement.  \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Characteristics of COVID-19 \nThe devastating effects of COVID-19 are well documented. Compl. ¶¶ 12–16. As of April \n20, 2020, 695,353 cases have been confirmed in the United States. Amon Decl. ¶ 5. Over 32,427 \nAmericans have died. Id. Philadelphia County has reported 8,764 of the Commonwealth’s 32,284 \ncases of COVID-19, and 240 of its 1,112 deaths. Compl. ¶ 12. In Philadelphia, the number of \npeople infected with COVID-19 grows by 20% every day, on average. Amon Decl. ¶ 5. Indeed, \non Wednesday April 22, Philadelphia reported 615 new COVID-19 cases bringing the total \nnumber of infections within the city to 10,643. 4 These numbers likely underestimate the virus’s \nimpact, given the lack of testing.  \n                                                 \n4 See NBC 10 Staff, The Peak Might Be Higher: More than 135,000 Cases, 6,700 Deaths in Pa., NJ, and \nDel, https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/coronavirus/where-coronavirus-cases-have-been-reported-in-\nthe-philly-area/2318340/ (April 22, 2020). \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 5 of 27\nThe rate of infection in the PDP far exceeds the infection rate overall in the City of \nPhiladelphia. Over the past two months, it has been reported that 120 prisoners in the PDP have \ncontracted the virus—more than double the rate of infection of the City as a whole. Cohen Decl. ¶ \n7. Moreover, without adequate testing, it is impossible to know exactly how many individuals in \nPDP facilities are actually infected. \nCOVID-19  spreads  through  a  population  in  close  contact  with  each  other  through \nrespiratory droplets produced when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or speaks. These droplets \ncan travel up to six feet or more through the air to infect another person. Amon Decl. ¶ 21; Cohen \nDecl. ¶ 11. The virus is also contracted when people touch surfaces and objects contaminated by \nthose same respiratory droplets and then touch their own mouth, nose, or eyes. Id. The virus has a \npotent life span and can survive on surfaces for hours or even days, depending on the material. \nCohen Decl. ¶ 11. Symptomatic persons spread the disease, but so too can asymptomatic persons. \nAmon Decl. ¶ 22; Cohen Decl. ¶ 5. For this reason, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and \nthe CDC have recommended persons wear masks any time they leave their homes and recently \nmandated that people wear masks when patronizing essential businesses.5 \nSymptoms of infection span a range of reactions, from no symptoms to respiratory failure \nand death. Amon Decl. ¶ 6. COVID-19 can severely damage lung tissue, which requires an \nextensive period of rehabilitation, and in some cases, can cause permanent and widespread damage \nto the lungs, heart, and other organs and bodily functions. Compl. ¶ 16.  \n                                                 \n5 Amon Decl. ¶ 24; see also Order of the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Health Directing \nPublic  Health  Safety  Measures  for  Businesses  Permitted  to  Maintain  In-person  Operations \nhttps://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20200415-SOH-worker-safety-order.pdf \n(April 19, 2020). \n5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 6 of 27\nFor persons over the age of 55 or with certain preexisting medical conditions, COVID-19 \ninfection presents a greater risk of serious symptoms and death. Cohen Decl. ¶ 43. Persons with \nlung disease, heart disease, chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis \npatients), diabetes, compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, or autoimmune \ndisease), blood disorders (including sickle cell disease), inherited metabolic disorders, stroke, and \ndevelopmental delay are all at a heightened risk of serious illness and death should they become \ninfected with COVID-19. Cohen Decl. ¶ 43; Amon Decl. ¶ 8.  \nThe most effective strategy for limiting the spread of the disease is social distancing—\ndeliberately keeping at least six feet of space between persons to avoid spreading the illness—\ncombined with a vigilant hygiene regimen, including washing hands frequently and thoroughly \nwith soap and water, and disinfecting surfaces. Amon Decl. ¶¶ 23–25 ; Cohen Decl. ¶ 6. Following \nthe recommendation of public health experts, government officials across the country have taken \nextraordinary measures to implement social distancing to minimize the spread of the disease, \nincluding shutting down schools, non-essential businesses, and courts. Id. The goal of these efforts \nis to “flatten the curve” by spreading the rate of infection across a longer period to avoid \noverwhelming the healthcare facilities that need to treat the most serious cases of COVID-19 \ninfection. Amon Decl. ¶ 26.  \nB.  COVID-19 in the PDP’s Facilities \nThe CDC has issued guidance for limiting the spread of COVID-19 in correctional facilities \nand these standards reflect universally accepted medical and safety measures for jails and prisons.6 \nThe guidelines recommend, at a minimum, (a) provide all incarcerated persons a six-foot radius or \n                                                 \n6 See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities  (Mar.  23,  2020)  available  at \nhttps://bit.ly/2UKYGES; see also Amon Decl. ¶¶ 30–33, 44–49, 58–59; Cohen Decl. ¶¶ 24(a), 40–41, 50 \n(discussing CDC guidance). \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 7 of 27\nmore of distance from any other persons, including during meals, recreation, housing, group \nactivities, medical treatments, and all other activities; (b) instituting a safety plan to prevent a \nCOVID-19  outbreak  in  PDP’s  facilities  in  accordance  with  CDC  guidelines;  (c)  providing \nincarcerated persons no-cost access to liquid soap, paper towels, running water, tissues and \nconsider providing alcohol-based sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol) readily available; (d) \nensuring that all common areas and frequently touched surfaces (including: doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, kiosks, and telephones) are cleaned and \ndisinfected several times per day; (e) providing adequate and appropriate COVID-19 testing for \nincarcerated persons, jail staff, and visitors; (f) waiving all medical co-pays for those experiencing \nCOVID-19  like  symptoms;  and  (g)  providing  sufficient  personal  protective  equipment, \nparticularly masks, to all staff and incarcerated people.  Id.  As we detail below, courts have relied \non these standards as well as other measures urged by medical and correctional experts in ordering \njails and prisons to implement adequate health and safety measures for incarcerated people. The \nCDC guidance for detention facilities specifically contemplate the continuation of recreation for \ndetained individuals and, in case of cancellation of group activities, notes the importance of \nidentifying alternative forms of activity that support the mental health of detained individuals.7    \nThis case is before this Court because the defendants have failed to implement these \nguidelines or the other measures necessary to protect the plaintiff class. As the Declarations of the \nPlaintiffs and Drs. Cohen and Amon demonstrate: \n  Defendants fail to provide for and enforce social distancing protections. Compl. ¶ \n28. In virtually all aspects of their daily lives, including when eating, sleeping, using \nthe bathroom, or talking on the phones with their families, incarcerated persons in the \n                                                 \n7 CDC Interim Guidance, at 12. \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 8 of 27\nPDP are unable to maintain a six-foot distance from others.

Id.; see also Remick Decl. ¶ 12; Dantzler Decl. ¶ 6; Hinton Decl. ¶ \n8; Weiss Decl. ¶¶ 11, 13; Skinner Decl. ¶ 18 . Some plaintiffs have been unable to clean \ntheir shared cell for weeks at a time. Abdullah Decl. ¶ 15; Bethea Decl. ¶ 11.  \n  Defendants fail to provide and mandate the use of adequate personal protective \nequipment.

Those who have tested \npositive  for  COVID-19  and  temporarily  isolated  are  often  returned  to  general \n9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 10 of 27\npopulation without subsequent testing to ensure they are no longer contagious to others. \nCompl. ¶ 32; see also Abdullah Decl. ¶ 21; Bethea Decl. ¶ 21. \nPlaintiffs expect that Defendants will assert that the PDP has implemented the CDC \nguidelines, but as Drs. Cohen and Amon make clear, their findings and opinions are based both \non: (1) the significant gaps between what the guidelines (and their own expert experience) demand \nin terms of protective measures and the policies adopted by the PDP,8 and (2) the significant gaps \nbetween what the policies state and the actual day-to-day implementation of these policies as \nevidenced by the consistent Declarations of the diverse set of Plaintiffs. In sum, neither the policies \nnor the practices of the PDP are constitutionally adequate. \nAs a result of Defendants’ practices, the plaintiff class is without the health and safety \nprotections  necessary  to  protect  them  from  infection.  Further,  Defendants  have  adopted  an \nunconstitutional practice of prolonged lockdowns, with severely limited out-of-cell time. Compl. \n¶ 33; Diaz Decl. ¶ 8; Walker Decl. ¶ 9; Alejandro Decl. ¶ 19; Hinton Decl. ¶ 6; Skinner Decl. ¶ 8; \nDantzler Decl. ¶ 9; Skinner Decl. ¶ 8; Abdullah Decl. ¶ 10; Bethea Decl. ¶¶ 11–13. The lockdowns \nprevent adequate exercise and shower time. See id. For those in cells, these conditions constitute \nsolitary confinement,9 widely known to cause and exacerbate mental illness and mental distress. \n                                                 \n8 For instance, Dr. Amon has described PDP’s guidance on social distancing as “woefully inadequate,” as \nthe written guidance only contemplates social distancing in the context of legal and official visits. Amon \nDecl. ¶ 54; see also Cohen Decl. ¶ 21 (noting that “[d]istancing is not optional”). The policies do not \nmention how social distancing amongst inmates is to be carried out. Id. Likewise, while PDP protocol \naccounts for the provision of masks, it does not address regular replacement and/or cleaning of masks, \nwhich is “not sufficient.” See Cohen Decl. ¶ 19.  \n9 Even for those with cellmates, these conditions still constitute solitary confinement. See Alison Shames, \nJessa Wilcox, Ram Subramian, Solitary Confinement: Common Misconceptions and Emerging Safe \nAlternatives,  VERA  INSTITUTE  OF  JUSTICE  (May  2015),  pp.  4-5,  available  at \nhttps://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/solitary-confinement-misconceptions-safe-alternatives-\nreport_1.pdf (defining solitary confinement as “confinement in an isolated cell (alone or with a cellmate) \nfor an average of 23 hours a day, with limited human interaction, little constructive activity, and in an \nenvironment that ensures maximum control over the individual”). \n10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 11 of 27\nSee Cohen Decl. ¶ 52 (emphasizing need to mitigate “extreme stress” caused by “the prolonged \nsolitary confinement status now operating at PDP facilities”). Lockdown conditions have also \nlimited access to medical care for chronic conditions and acute illness. See Diaz Decl. ¶¶ 3–4; \nWalker Decl. ¶ 3; Abdullah Decl. ¶ 2; Bethea Decl. ¶ 5.  \nIII. ARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs and Members of the Proposed Class Are Entitled to Equitable Relief \nto Prevent Infection, Illness or Death From COVID-19. \nPlaintiffs request immediate equitable relief due to the extraordinary and urgent situation \nhere, seeking both a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and a preliminary injunction. Courts \napply the same standard in assessing requests for interim injunctive relief, regardless of whether a \npetitioner requests a TRO or preliminary injunction. See Ellakkany v. Common Pleas Ct. of \nMontgomery Cnty., 658 F. App’x 25, 27 (3d Cir. 2016) (applying one standard to a motion for \nboth a TRO and preliminary injunction). The plaintiffs “must establish that they are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claims, they are likely to suffer irreparable harm without relief, the \nbalance of harms favors them, and relief is in the public interest.” Issa v. Sch. Dist. of Lancaster, \n847 F.3d 121, 131 (3d Cir. 2017). In lawsuits brought by incarcerated people challenging the \nconditions of their confinement, preliminary injunctive relief is permitted so long as it is “narrowly \ndrawn, extend[s] no further than necessary to correct the harm . . . and [is] the least intrusive means \nnecessary to correct that harm.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2). Before entering a preliminary injunction, \nthe Court must make \"specific findings with respect to the[se] needs-narrowness-intrusiveness \ncriteria.” Victory v. Berks Cty., 789 F. App'x 328, 334 (3d Cir. 2019). These findings, “at a \nminimum . . . must be ‘sufficient to allow a clear understanding of the ruling.’” Id. at 333-34 \n(quoting Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1070 (9th Cir. 2010)). \n11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 12 of 27\nCourts have broad power to fashion equitable remedies to address constitutional violations \nin prisons, Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 687 n.9 (1978), including orders “placing limits on a \nprison’s population, “[w]hen necessary to ensure compliance with a constitutional mandate.” \nBrown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011). Courts “must not shrink from their obligation to enforce \nthe constitutional rights of all persons, including prisoners” and “may not allow constitutional \nviolations to continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison \nadministration.” Id. at 511 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). \n  1.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on The Merits. \nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \nand the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that the conditions of confinement in PDP present \na clear and present danger to their health and safety and that the defendants have failed to provide \nnecessary health measures to protect them from immediate risks of infection, illness, and death.10  \na.  Plaintiffs and the class are likely to succeed on their constitutional claims. \nThe United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit have made clear that inhumane conditions of confinement and/or the failure to implement \nrecognized community standards of care for serious medical conditions establish claims under the \nEighth Amendment for sentenced prisoners and under the Fourteenth Amendment for pretrial \ndetainees.  \nThe Eighth Amendment protects incarcerated people serving criminal sentences from cruel \nand unusual punishment, and it requires jails and prison officials to protect people in their custody \n                                                 \n10 Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification (ECF 2), and if this motion is contested by Defendants, \nit can be litigated in due course. However, this Court has “general equity powers allowing it to grant \ntemporary or preliminary injunctive relief to a conditional class.” Mays v. Dart, 2020 WL 1812381, at *3 \n(N.D. Ill. April 9, 2020). \n12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 13 of 27\nfrom known risks of serious harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 285, 834 (1994). To prevail on \nclaim alleging that conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment, plaintiffs must meet \ntwo requirements: (1) “the deprivation alleged must be, objectively, ‘sufficiently serious,’” and (2) \n“the  ‘prison  official  must  have  a  sufficiently  culpable  state  of  mind,’”  such  as  “deliberate \nindifference to the inmate’s health or safety.” See Thomas v. Tice, 948 F.3d 133, 138 (3d Cir. 2020) \n(quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834). \nLeaving those in custody in the path of an infectious disease easily satisfies the first prong. \nThe Supreme Court held in Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993), that the government violates \nthe Eighth Amendment when it crowds prisoners into cells with others who have “infectious \nmaladies” or otherwise exposes prisoners “to a serious, communicable disease.” 509 U.S. at 33 \n(citing Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 682 (1978)). Importantly, a high risk of harm—even without \nproof of a current and ongoing harm—is sufficient to establish the constitutional violation and \njustify court intervention. Id. (“[A] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic event.”). \nPlaintiffs also satisfy the second prong because Defendants are undeniably aware of the \nserious risk that COVID-19 poses to Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed class. The PDP \nwebsite, in a post written by Defendant Carney, reports the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases \nin PDP facilities, and outlines screening steps purportedly taken “to be proactive in safeguarding \nthe welfare of everyone at the PDP.”11 The PDP deems it important to issue personal protective \nequipment “to staff,” id., but not those held in PDP facilities. The PDP claims to conduct \nassessment tracing of anyone within 6 feet of a staff member who tests positive, in accordance \nwith “CDC guidelines,” id., but has not adopted other CDC social distancing, hygiene, and medical \n                                                 \n11  See  “How  Philadelphia  Department  of  Prisons  is  responding  to  COVID-19,”  available  at \nhttps://www.phila.gov/2020-03-30-how-philadelphia-department-of-prisons-is-responding-to-covid-19/. \n13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 14 of 27\ncare guidelines critical to slow the spread of the virus. The “PDP Response to COVID-19”12 does \nnot satisfy Defendants’ constitutional obligation to provide safe conditions. Rather, it underscores \nthat Defendants: (1) knew of the grave risks of COVID-19 in PDP, and (2) nonetheless failed to \ntake appropriate steps to create a response plan that complied with CDC guidelines. Amon Decl. \n¶ 53. Worse, the evidence establishes that PDP is not even complying with its own inadequate \nresponse plan. Id. at ¶ 57.  As a result, plaintiffs are not receiving adequate hygiene or cleaning \nsupplies, id., and staff and inmates are not consistently getting or using personal protective \nequipment. Id. at ¶ 33, 53.   \nConditions that violate the Eighth Amendment necessarily also violate pretrial detainees’ \ndue process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr. Facility, \n318 F.3d 575, 581 (3d Cir. 2003) (explaining that the “Fourteenth Amendment affords pretrial \ndetainees protections ‘at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a \nconvicted prisoner’”) (quoting City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983)). \nBecause Defendants’ conduct clearly violates the Eighth Amendment, the Court need not analyze \nplaintiffs’ claim separately under the Fourteenth Amendment.13 \nb.  Plaintiffs and the Disability Subclass are likely to succeed on the ADA \nclaims. \n                                                 \n12 Available at https://www.phila.gov/media/20200413152258/PDP-Response-COVID-19.pdf \n13 Plaintiffs note, however, that the Fourteenth Amendment also protects pretrial detainees from being held \nin conditions that amount to punishment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979). When “a \ncondition of confinement is [not] reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, [courts] may \ninfer ‘that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not be constitutionally inflicted \nupon detainees qua detainees.’” E.D. v. Sharkey, 928 F.3d 299, 307 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting Hubbard v. \nTaylor, 538 F.3d 229, 232 (3d Cir. 2008)); see also Darnell v. Pineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2017) \n(holding that defendants can be liable under the Due Process Clause even when they did not have subjective \nawareness that their acts or omissions subjected pretrial detainees to a substantial risk of harm) (citing \nKingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 (2015)). \n14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 15 of 27\nThe ADA provides additional and alternative grounds for injunctive relief. The ADA is “a \nremedial statute, designed to eliminate discrimination against the disabled in all facets of society” \nand “must be broadly construed to effectuate its purposes.” Schorr v. Borough of Lemoyne, 243 F. \nSupp. 2d 232, 235 (M.D. Pa. 2003) (citing Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 335 (1967)). To \nestablish a claim for relief under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., a plaintiff must \nestablish “that he is a qualified individual with a disability, who was precluded from participating \nin a program, service, or activity, or otherwise was subject to discrimination, by reason of his \ndisability.” Furgess v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 933 F.3d 285, 288-89 (3d Cir. 2019)); see also Bowers \nv. NCAA, 475 F.3d 524, 553 n.32 (3d Cir. 2007). The ADA prohibits public entities, including \ncounty jails, from discriminating on the basis of disability. See Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 \nU.S. 206, 209–10 (1998) (finding ADA protections apply to activities of correctional institutions); \nChisolm v. McManimon, 275 F.3d 315, 325 (3d Cir. 2001) (“Title II of the ADA applies to services, \nprograms  and  activities  provided  within  correctional  institutions.”).  Discrimination  includes \nfailing to make reasonable accommodations that would allow a person with a disability to \nparticipate in a service, program or activity. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. \n509,  531  (2004)  (noting  Congress  recognized  “that  failure  to  accommodate  persons  with \ndisabilities often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion” or discrimination).  \n  The  ADA  defines  disability  as  an  impairment  that  substantially  limits  “major  life \nactivities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). “Major life activities” include “the operation of a major bodily \nfunction, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, \ndigestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive \nfunctions.” Id. Each of the named plaintiffs has a physical impairment that constitutes a disability \nunder the ADA. Compl. ¶¶ 36–45. The same is true of each member of the Disability Subclass, \n15 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 16 of 27\nwho is at increased risk of COVID-19 illness, injury, or death due to their disability or any medical \ntreatment necessary to treat their disability.14  \n  Plaintiffs and members of the Disability Subclass are precluded from safely participating \nin PDP’s services, programs, and activities. “Services, programs, and activities” under the ADA \n“encompass virtually everything that a public entity does.” Haberle v. Troxell, 885 F.3d 171, 180 \n(3d Cir. 2018) (internal quotations omitted); see also Furgess, 933 F.3d at 289 (“We have \nconfirmed these terms’ broad meaning, calling them ‘all-encompassing.’”). Due to the unique \nnature of detention, in which facility staff control nearly all aspects of detained individuals’ daily \nlives, this includes “virtually all [] prison programs,” including those involving “mobility, hygiene, \n[and] medical care.” Furgess, 933 F.3d at 290 (citing United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 \n(2006)). By virtue of their incarceration, members of the Disability Subclass qualify for the \n“services, programs, and activities” of PDP, including the safe care PDP has a duty to provide for \nthose in its custody. Conditions in PDP’s facilities deny Plaintiffs and the members of the \nDisability Subclass that safety. Defendants have neglected their ADA obligations by failing to \nprovide  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  Disability  Subclass  with  adequate  means  to  protect \nthemselves against COVID-19 and its serious complications. \nThe conditions of confinement at PDP violate the constitutional and statutory rights of all \nmembers of the plaintiff class as they place them at a significant and unreasonable risk of \n                                                 \n14 Members of the Disability Subclass have diagnoses including but not limited to the following: (a) lung \ndisease, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis or emphysema), or other \nchronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital heart \ndisease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including \nhepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) epilepsy; (f) hypertension; (g) \ncompromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant, \nas a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune disease); (h) blood disorders and/or (i) developmental \ndisability.

Plaintiffs  cannot  get  sufficient  soap,  hand  sanitizer,  cleaning  and \ndisinfecting products, or personal protective equipment. Amon Decl. ¶ 33, 59; Cohen Decl. ¶ 40, \n41. Plaintiffs do not get adequate testing, and there is insufficient quarantine, separation, and \nmedical care for those who enter the PDP, those who are symptomatic or test positive, or those \nwho are medically vulnerable. Amon Decl. ¶ 53; Cohen Decl. ¶ 37. Moreover, PDP’s inadequate \nattempt  to  impose  social  distancing  has  led  to  additional  violations,  as  plaintiffs  have  a \nsignificantly reduced ability to shower, exercise, or have necessary communications with their \nfamilies or lawyers. Cohen Decl. ¶ 22, 52. \n As the comprehensive declarations of Drs. Amon and Cohen establish, the PDP has failed \nto comply with the nationally recognized health and safety standards and as a result, at this time, \nthe class members face a grave risk of illness and death. Courts considering similar conditions \nhave found plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs in this case, to have established a likelihood of success on \nthe merits of their constitutional and statutory claims, whether brought under the Eighth or \nFourteenth Amendments. See, e.g., Banks v. Booth, No. CV 20-849(CKK), 2020 WL 1914896, at \n*11 (D.D.C. April 19, 2020) (granting TRO with respect to conditions in D.C. jails); Mays v.

See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33, 35 (noting \nthat a prisoner “could successfully complain about demonstrably unsafe drinking water without \nwaiting for an attack of dysentery” and holding that exposure to second-hand smoke in prison \nstated a constitutional claim); Padilla v.

See, \ne.g., Wilson v. Williams, No. 4:20-cv-00794, slip op. at 15-19 (N.D. Ohio, Apr. 22, 2020) (granting \npreliminary injunctive relief in class action habeas petition for prisoners, ordering the Bureau of \nPrisons to identify individuals who are at heightened risk and transfer them to home confinement \nor a facility where social distancing is possible).15 \nIndeed, several courts have also ordered the immediate release of detainees facing the \nimminent threat of COVID-19. See, e.g., Bent v. Barr, No. 19-cv-06123-DMR, 2020 WL 1812850, \nat *6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2020) (allowing for release of detainee who had “at least two high-risk \nconditions and ha[d] therefore established that he [was] at heightened risk because of COVID-\n19”); Vazquez Barrera v.

The Balance of Equities Favors Granting Relief to the Proposed Class. \n \nThe balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of granting the requested injunctive relief. \nThe preliminary injunction Plaintiffs request will not substantially injure other interested parties. \nSee Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 526 (3d Cir. 2018) (preliminary injunction \nwarranted where relief “will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party”). Rather, \ngiven the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in general, not issuing preliminary relief would cause \nsignificant injury to the parties and the public at large. Beyond the fact that “[t]he balance of the \nequities tips sharply” in favor of Plaintiffs and the proposed class, given the threat of “irreparable \nharm to their constitutional rights and health,” Castillo v. Barr, No. 20-00605, 2020 WL 1502864, \nat *6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2020); see also Am. Freedom Def. Initiative v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., 92 \nF. Supp. 3d 314, (E.D. Pa. 2015) (same), the public interest favors granting preliminary relief as \nwell.  \nAs outlined below, Plaintiffs have requested remedial measures that go no further than \nnecessary  to  protect  their  basic  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  to  humane  conditions  of \nconfinement by ensuring compliance with the views of medical and correctional experts in line \nwith but not necessarily limited by CDC guidelines and standards. Under this remedial scheme, \nthe Defendants continue to hold the keys to the PDP and are required only to do what the \nConstitution requires.  \n4.  Injunctive Relief Promotes the Public Interest.   \nThere is a strong public interest in minimizing the spread of COVID-19 to staff in the PDP \nand, once carried out unknowingly by staff members, to the broader Philadelphia community. In \n20 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 21 of 27\nthe first instance, uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 within the PDP’s facilities increases the risk \nof infection to PDP staff members who return to their communities at the end of each workday, \nand, therefore, poses a direct threat to the entire surrounding community. Further, a large-scale \ninfection within PDP will tax supporting hospitals and increase in the number of sick individuals \nin the community needing prompt and critical medical care. The public interest is best served by \ntaking all necessary steps to reduce infection, slow the spread of the virus, and provide all \nnecessary and available support to protect against undue pressures on Philadelphia hospitals. \nCourts have consistently found a weighty public interest favoring injunctive relief where \nprisoners face similarly serious threats to their health. At bottom, “[t]he public has a critical interest \nin preventing the further spread of the coronavirus.” Castillo v. Barr, No. 20-00605, 2020 WL \n1502864, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 27, 2020); see also Thakker, 2020 WL 1671563, at *9 (finding \n“[e]fforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and promote public health are clearly in the public’s \nbest interest”).  Further escalation of the already substantial outbreak within PDP, like the \ndetention center in Castillo, would “endanger all of us—detainees, employees, residents [of the \nsurrounding community], residents of the State . . . , and our nation as a whole,” Castillo, 2020 \nWL 1502864, at *6; and would “quickly overwhelm the already strained health infrastructure \nwithin the facility . . . which would then place strain on the surrounding community hospitals.” \nCoronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *7.  \nB.  Requests for Injunctive Relief \nPlaintiffs  request  a  TRO  and  a  preliminary  injunction  for  immediate  relief  for  all \nincarcerated people held in the PDP, because with each day that passes, the risk of severe harm \ngrows exponentially for each person. Plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class (“Class”) consisting \nof: \n21 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 22 of 27\nAll  current  and  future  persons  held  in  custody  within  the \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons. \n \nSee Compl. ¶ 47; Pls.’ Mot. for Class Certification (ECF 2) ¶1.16  \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to bring the PDP into compliance with \nnationally recognized health and safety standards. The necessary measures are alleged in the \nComplaint, ¶¶ 26–34, detailed in the reports of Drs. Cohen and Amon, and outlined below. \nFurther, Plaintiffs request that Defendants be ordered to submit a plan to the Court within \nfive (5) days, to be overseen by a qualified public health expert pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 706, \nwhich outlines specific mitigation efforts. \nMore  specifically,  Plaintiffs  request  injunctive  relief  that  addresses  the  following \nrequirements and standards: \n1.  Ensuring proper social distancing by: \na.  Allowing no less than six-feet of distance between incarcerated persons held in \ncustody  at  the Philadelphia Department  of Prisons when sleeping, eating, \nwashing, recreating, using phones, and traveling between different areas of PDP \nfacilities. \n \n2.  Ensuring enhanced personal hygiene by: \na.  Providing unrestricted free access to hand soap and disposable hand towels to \nfacilitate handwashing. \n \nb.  Providing unrestricted free access to hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% \nalcohol. \n \nc.  Providing the opportunity to shower daily, without forcing incarcerated people \nto choose between showers and other activities. \n \n3.  Ensuring clean and hygienic living spaces by: \na.  Providing ready access to cleaning supplies, including bleach-based cleaning \nagents and CDC-recommended disinfectants in sufficient quantities to facilitate \nfrequent cleaning and disinfecting of floors and all surfaces in cells and housing \nareas. \n                                                 \n16 Plaintiffs also seek certification of two subclasses, in addition to the Class defined above. One subclass \nis the “Medically Vulnerable Subclass,” and the other subclass is the “Disability Subclass.” See Compl. ¶ \n48; Mot. for Class Cert. ¶¶ 2-3. \n22 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 23 of 27\n \nb.  Requiring and ensuring that all common areas and frequently touched surfaces \n, including common-use items such as but not limited to toilets, sinks, showers, \ntelevisions  controls,  books,  door  handles,  light  switches,  and  recreational \nequipment  are  cleaned  at  regular intervals  repeatedly  throughout  the  day.  \nPhones should be cleaned after each use.  \n \nc.  Increasing regular cleaning and disinfecting of all common areas and surfaces, \nincluding common-use items such as television controls, books, and gym and \nsports equipment. \n \nd.  Providing new gloves and masks daily to those who are cleaning or performing \njanitorial services. \n \ne.  Providing clean sheets and clothing twice per week. \n \n4.  Ensuring consistent usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) by: \na.  Providing all incarcerated people and prison staff members with masks that are \nlaundered and/or exchanged on a daily basis; and  \n \nb.  Mandating that prison staff wear masks at all times while working, and that \nincarcerated people wear masks at all times when leaving their cell (except if \nshowering, eating, or for medical reasons). \n \n5.  Implementing testing and medical isolation by: \na.  Testing all incarcerated people in PDP, including those newly admitted, for \nCOVID-19, prioritizing those in the medically vulnerable sub-class.  \n \nb.  Ensuring that any incarcerated person who tests positive or displays symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19 is medically isolated and remains medically isolated \nuntil they test negative to prevent the infection of others. Individuals in isolation \nshould have multiple daily temperature checks and monitoring of blood oxygen \nlevels to ensure stability.  \n \nc.  Testing all staff who enter PDP facilities, and for any staff that tests positive, \nrequiring that they medically isolate themselves and test negative prior to re-\nentering a PDP facility.  \n \n6.  Alternatively,  implementing  screening,  medical  isolation,  and  quarantine  if  mass \ntesting is not available by:  \na.  Immediately medically isolating all those who display symptoms of COVID-\n19. Individuals in isolation should have multiple daily temperature checks and \nmonitoring of blood oxygen levels to ensure stability. \n \nb.  Quarantining all new admissions to PDP facilities for a full 14 days. Those in \nquarantine should be monitored daily for symptoms and temperature.  \n23 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 24 of 27\n \nc.  Quarantining all people who have been exposed to individuals who have tested \npositive for COVID-19 or displayed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 for \na full 14 days. Those in quarantine should be monitored daily for symptoms and \ntemperature.  \n \nd.  Screening  everyone  entering  PDP  facilities  daily  for  temperature  and \nsymptoms. Those who cannot pass the screen should be sent home.  \n \n7.  Ensuring access to necessary services by: \na.  Providing at least four hours of daily out-of-cell time for showering, cleaning, \nrecreation, and making phone calls. Two of these hours must be permitted for \nlarge-muscle recreation out of doors. Such out-of-cell time should be provided \non a staggered basis to allow for social distancing.  \n \nb.  Providing medical care for non-COVID-19-related medical and mental health \nneeds. \n \nc.  Maintaining no-cost medical service and medication delivery and, if applicable, \nwaiving co-pays. \n \nd.  Providing unlimited and free calls to families or loved ones. \ne.  Providing free, unrecorded, and confidential phone calls to legal counsel.  \n8.  Ensuring education, transparency, and information dissemination by: \na.  Providing all incarcerated people with (i) general updates and information about \nthe COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) information on how incarcerated people can \nprotect themselves from contracting COVID-19; and (iii) instructions on how \nto properly wash hands.  \n \na.  Providing a daily public report on the current and cumulative numbers of: \ni.  incarcerated people and correctional and health staff who have confirmed \nCOVID-19;  \nii.  those who have been tested;  \niii.  incarcerated people over the age of 55;  \niv.  people in infirmary status;  \nv.  pregnant women in custody;  \nvi.  those in  quarantine and medical isolation status;  \nvii.  incarcerated people awaiting test results;  \nviii.  COVID-19 positive persons in cohorted housing;  \nix.  incarcerated  people  hospitalized  (including  daily  hospital  admissions, \ndischarges, and number of people on ventilators); \nx.  deaths of incarcerated people. \n \n24 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 18-1   Filed 04/23/20   Page 25 of 27\nC.  Release of Plaintiffs and Members of the Class Is Necessary and Warranted if \nDefendants do not Provide Constitutional Conditions of Confinement \n \nIf Defendants do not provide these constitutionally and statutorily required minimum \nprotections, this Court has the power to issue writs of habeas corpus releasing class members. 28 \nU.S.C. § 2241 provides relief for incarcerated people who allege violations of the Constitution that \nmake the fact of their confinement illegal. See Preiser v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 475, 494 (1973) \n(habeas corpus permits prisoners to attack “the fact or length of confinement” and seek “immediate \nor more speedy release”); Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 432 F.3d 235, 242–44 (3d Cir. 2005) \n(Becker, J.) (habeas corpus permits prisoners to attack “execution” of their sentence, which \nincludes manner and method of detention); Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 540 (3d Cir. 2002) \n(habeas corpus review available “where the deprivation of rights is such that it necessarily impacts \nthe fact or length of detention”).  \nWrits of habeas corpus ordering release may be the only means to protect certain class \nmembers from constitutionally deficient conditions that place them at a severe risk of illness or \ndeath from COVID-19. If the PDP fails to adopt basic mitigation policies—such as social \ndistancing, personal hygiene, and proper medical testing and care—class members and especially \nmembers of the Medically Vulnerable Subclass are entitled to judicial consideration for release.  \nIn  adopting  appropriate  social  distancing  practices,  however,  PDP  cannot  substitute  one \nunconstitutional practice for another and mandate facility-wide lockdowns.  See Cohen Decl. ¶ 52 \nDiaz Decl. ¶¶ 3–4; Walker Decl. ¶ 3; Abdullah Decl. ¶ 2; Bethea Decl. ¶ 5. \nIn these circumstances, which are controlled, and therefore can be prevented by the \nDefendants, the Medically Vulnerable Subclass’ claims come “within the ‘core of habeas’ and \nrequire sooner release if resolved in [their] favor.” Leamer, 288 F.3d at 544; see also Woodall v. \nFed.

While \nDefendants deserve credit for taking some steps to address the COVID-19 health crises in PDP \nfacilities, a number of those actions came after counsel for the Philadelphia Department of Prisons \n(“PDP”) was on notice that Plaintiffs would initiate this action.  In any event, Defendants’ actions \nare  far from  sufficient  to  resolve the ongoing  violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional  rights.  \nDefendants’ arguments are based in large part on documents that are not fully reflective of the \ncurrent conditions in PDP facilities.  As Plaintiffs will show by additional and updated evidence, \nthere is a large gap between PDP’s stated policies and PDP’s actual practices.  Absent a negotiated \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 31\nresolution or ruling on the record presently before the Court, Plaintiffs request that the Court \nschedule a hearing to resolve factual disputes and to order appropriate relief.    \nAs multiple federal and state courts have recognized in recent rulings in similar cases \nseeking to safeguard prison populations facing the unprecedented risks of COVID-19, the health \nand lives of the plaintiff class and others hang in balance, and further action is required.   \nI.  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and for a Preliminary Injunction \n(“Motion”) on April 23, 2020.  Defendants filed a Response (ECF 22), and Plaintiffs file this Reply \nto address the arguments submitted by Defendants.   \nIn the April 24, 2020 Court conference call, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they had \nserved Defendants with discovery requests that were targeted to the issues presented by the \nMotion, but had agreed to provide Defendants with a narrower request limited to priority items.  \nDefendants agreed to produce the relevant documents and information during the week of April \n27, 2020.  As of this filing, Plaintiffs have received one production that did not nearly provide the \nnecessary information, notwithstanding a follow-up request for the relevant documents.  Ex. D, \nEmail from Plaintiffs re: Discovery, May 1, 2020.1  In a follow up telephone conference between \ncounsel on May 4, 2020, the parties agreed to advise the Court of discovery status in a conference \ncall scheduled for May 7, 2020. \nIn  the  Motion,  Plaintiffs  sought  injunctive  relief  to  remedy  perilous  conditions  of \nconfinement in the PDP due to COVID-19.  The Motion was supported by twelve declarations \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs reference their three previous Exhibits by ECF Number and new exhibits beginning \nwith Exhibit D.  Plaintiffs have also attached an index of each Exhibit for the Court’s convenience. \nSee Ex. AA. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 3 of 31\nappended to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, one from each of the ten Plaintiffs, and two from Plaintiffs’ \nexperts in the fields of public health and correctional health care, Dr. Joseph J. Amon, and Dr. \nRobert L. Cohen.  The Motion was further supported by a Memorandum of Law that addressed \nthe legal claims in the Complaint and Plaintiffs’ entitlement to preliminary relief.  Plaintiffs sought \nrelief narrowly tailored to ensure constitutional conditions of confinement, with the claim for \nreleases under either 28 U.S.C. § 2241 or 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to be considered only if Defendants \ndid not comply with court orders regarding conditions of confinement. \nIn this Reply, Plaintiffs first address the current state of the factual record.  Plaintiffs then \naddress the legal claims to demonstrate why Plaintiffs continue to be entitled to relief.   \nII.  UPDATED FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nIn Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Support of the Motion, Plaintiffs detailed the effects of \nCOVID-19.  As of May 4, 2020, 1,152,372 cases had been confirmed in the United States, and \nover 67,456 Americans had died.2  Philadelphia County has reported 13,316 of the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania’s 50,092 cases of COVID-19, and 424 of its 2,458 deaths, with the number of \npeople infected with COVID-19 growing by 20% every day.3  As all experts have acknowledged, \nthese numbers underestimate the impact of the virus, given the lack of testing.  The rate of infection \nin the PDP far exceeds the infection rate overall in the City of Philadelphia.  Over the past two \nmonths, 192 prisoners in the PDP have contracted the virus—more than five times the rate of \ninfection in Philadelphia as a whole.4   \n                                                 \n2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Cases in the US (last updated May 4, 2020), \navailable at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html. \n3 Pennsylvania Department of Health (PA DOH), COVID-19 Data for Pennsylvania (May 4, \n2020), available at https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx. \n4 The infection rate in the PDP is discussed below.  See infra § II.A. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 4 of 31\nThe most effective strategy for limiting the spread of the disease is social distancing—\ndeliberately keeping at least six feet of space between persons to avoid spreading the illness—\ncombined with a vigilant hygiene regimen, including washing hands frequently and thoroughly \nwith soap and water, and disinfecting surfaces.  Amon Dec., ECF 1-4, ¶¶ 23–25; Cohen Dec., ECF \n1-5, ¶ 6.  Following the recommendation of public health experts, government officials across the \ncountry have taken extraordinary measures to implement social distancing.   \nThe CDC has issued guidance for limiting the spread of COVID-19 in correctional facilities \nwhich reflect safety measures for jails and prisons.5  At the heart of the Motion was the claim, \nsupported by declarations, that Defendants had failed to adequately implement these guidelines, \nand had also had failed to take other measures necessary to protect the plaintiff class, including:  \n  Failing to provide for and enforce social distancing protections; \n  Failing to adequately, consistently, and freely provide necessary hygiene products \nto incarcerated people in PDP, leaving some without soap for days at a time;  \n  Failing to provide for adequate cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting of shared \ncommon areas including toilets, sinks, showers, and phones;  \n  Failing to provide and mandate the use of adequate personal protective equipment, \nwith prison staff inconsistently using masks and often interacting with people, \nincluding those in “quarantine,” without wearing masks; and  \n  Failing to provide for adequate isolation or quarantine measures.  \n                                                 \n5  See  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  Interim  Guidance  on  Management  of \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020) \navailable at https://bit.ly/2UKYGES; see also Amon Dec., ECF 1-4, ¶¶ 30–33, 44–49, 58–59; \nCohen Dec., ECF 1-5, ¶¶ 24(a), 40–41, 50 (discussing CDC guidance). \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 5 of 31\nDefendants' Response takes issue with these factual allegations, claims that all necessary \nprotective measures have been adopted and are being implemented at the PDP, and argues that, \nunder the relevant law, their actions eliminate the necessity for injunctive and declaratory relief. \nPlaintiffs set  forth  their legal  response below,  but,  at  the outset, highlight  four points that \ndemonstrate how Defendants’ submissions do not rebut Plaintiffs’ claims.   \nFirst,  the  rate  of  infection  at  PDP  facilities  and  the  continued  threat  of  COVID-19 \ntransmission remains a critical issue, with constitutional implications.  Second, even taking the \nprotocols that have been adopted by Defendants at face value, there remain substantial gaps \nbetween the policies and what is needed in terms of protective measures.  Third, and of great legal \nsignificance, most of the policies directed towards incarcerated people, which Defendants rely \nupon to claim adherence to CDC recommendations, were promulgated or implemented after \nDefendants received notice of Plaintiff’s intent to file this lawsuit.  And fourth, Defendants’ \ncontention that they have in fact successfully employed necessary protective measures on a \nsystem-wide basis is far from persuasive, as the evidence suggests that implementation has been, \nat best, uneven and inconsistent. \nA.  PDP’s Rate of Infection and the Continued Threat of COVID in PDP Facilities \n  Defendants assert that their actions have resulted in reduced COVID-19 transmission rates \nwithin  their  facilities.    Defs.’  Resp.  at  5.    The  data  belies  this  assertion.    Despite  testing \napproximately only 7 percent of the total population, a cumulative total of 192 people have tested \npositive for COVID-19; in other words, 75 percent of those tested were positive for the virus.6  \n                                                 \n6 Max Marin, Over 75% of people tested in Philly jails are positive for COVID-19, BillyPenn (May \n4, 2020), https://billypenn.com/2020/05/04/over-75-of-people-tested-in-philly-jails-are-positive-\nfor-covid-19/. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 6 of 31\nThus, PDP’s infection rate is 5.47 times greater than the infection rate in Philadelphia, and 13.95 \ntimes greater than Pennsylvania’s infection rate as a whole.  See Ex. E.   \n  Even when compared with other Pennsylvania correctional facilities, PDP’s infection rate \nis troubling. The rate of infection within PDP facilities is 3.12 times greater than the rate in SCI \nPhoenix, the state correctional facility with the largest reported number of cases.  When compared \nwith the infection rate at all SCI facilities,7 the rate of infection in PDP facilities is 31.18 times \ngreater.  See id.8 \n  Even if Defendants tested all symptomatic people within their facilities, a slight dip in new \ninfections over two days does not mean the infection is under control.  While PDP reported only \none positive test on May 1, 2020 and zero positive tests the following day, this is, as shown in the \nfollowing chart, consistent with an established pattern over the past month, with the number of \npositive test results rising and falling on a daily basis: \n                                                 \n7 The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, unlike PDP, publishes a daily log with the \ncumulative  number  of  COVID19  test  results  for  both  inmates  and  employees.    See \nhttps://www.cor.pa.gov/Pages/COVID-19.aspx (last accessed May 3, 2020).  \n8 As noted below, the reported infection rate in PDP likely dramatically undercounts the number \nof actual infections.  See infra § II.B. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 7 of 31\n \nThe absence of an established downward trend is confirmed by the City’s report on May \n3, of four new positive results.9  Defendants’ reliance on a narrow snapshot of positive test results \nfails to accurately reflect what is actually occurring in PDP’s facilities: the continued spread of \nCOVID-19 among the incarcerated population. \nB.  PDP’s Policies are Not Adequate to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 \n  Defendants contend that the protocols they have put in place demonstrate their effective \nsatisfaction  of  their  constitutional  obligations.    Putting  aside  serious  questions  about  the \nimplementation of these policies, see infra § II.D, there are significant deficiencies in PDP’s \npractices.  See Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F.  Those deficiencies fall into three categories. \n                                                 \n9 City Provides Update on COVID-19 for Sunday, May 3, 2020, City of Philadelphia (May 3, \n2020),  https://www.phila.gov/2020-05-03-city-provides-update-on-covid-19-for-sunday-may-3-\n2020/ (last accessed May 5, 2020). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 8 of 31\n  First, Defendants’ policies do not provide for sufficient COVID-19 testing.  Current \npractice in the PDP calls for very limited testing, and only where an incarcerated person presents \nwith a small set of symptoms.  Herdman Dec., ECF 22-1, at 4-5, ¶¶ 34, 41.  As Dr. Cohen states, \nthese practices are “not sufficient to protect the staff and residents of PDP from the spread of \nCOVID-19.”  Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F, ¶ 2.  In short, because asymptomatic people transmit \nCOVID-19 to others, it is difficult, if not impossible, to develop an effective plan to limit the spread \nof COVID-19 without mass testing of incarcerated people and PDP staff.  Id. ¶ 8.  PDP’s protocols \nare resulting in significant gaps in protective measures with no testing of all new admissions and \nwith no testing before removing people who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 from \nisolation.  Id. ¶¶ 3-4. \nTesting conducted to date in PDP facilities has almost certainly resulted in a severe \nundercount of the actual rate of infection.  Id. ¶ 7.  Experience in testing of entire jail populations \nin other jurisdictions indicates that mass testing can be expected to show infection rates far greater \nthan what is shown without such testing.  For example, testing of the entire population of \nincarcerated people at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility showed an infection rate 30 \ntimes greater than that identified before testing began.  Id.  Indeed, statistics just publicized on \nMay 4 show an extremely high positive rate in PDP facilities, with 75% of those tested found (or \npresumed) positive.10   \nFor this reason, an adequate prevention protocol requires testing of all people newly \nadmitted to PDP’s facilities, and, ultimately, the entire population.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 5.  While such \nmeasures are time consuming, they can and should be done by prioritizing vulnerable populations, \n                                                 \n10 Max Marin, Over 75% of people tested in Philly jails are positive for COVID-19, BillyPenn \n(May  4,  2020),  https://billypenn.com/2020/05/04/over-75-of-people-tested-in-philly-jails-are-\npositive-for-covid-19/. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 9 of 31\nincluding all persons over the age of 50.  Id. ¶¶ 5-6.11  Testing data—including data concerning \ncorrectional and medical staff—should be publicized so that the effectiveness of PDP’s measures \ncan be assessed.  Id. ¶ 9.  And, critically, PDP must address a significant gap in its handling of \nthose who have tested positive for COVID-19.  Current practices merely require an assessment of \nsymptoms before removing someone who has tested positive from isolation.  Id. ¶ 4.  This practice \nresults in a substantial risk that people who are still infected and contagious are returned to areas \nof PDP’s facilities where they can infect other people.  To counter this risk, PDP should be required \nto adopt a two negative COVID-19 test protocol before removal from isolation.  Id. \n  Second, the parties are in full agreement that social distancing is the most important \ncomponent of a prevention plan.  See ECF 18-1 at ¶ 13; ECF 22 at 2.  Yet Defendants do not \nmandate  sufficient  social  distancing.    In  particular,  Defendants  have  allowed  numerous \nincarcerated people housed in PDP’s Detention Center facility to continue residing in dormitory \nsettings where they sleep in close proximity to others.  While Defendants have instituted “head-\nto-toe” sleeping arrangements in those facilities, these practices are not sufficiently protective.  \nCohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F,  ¶ 10.  As Dr. Cohen states, there is “no scientific study which has shown \nthat these arrangements prevent respiratory spread of disease.”  Id.  PDP also engages in double \ncelling of incarcerated people.12  It is not possible to engage in required social distancing in such \n                                                 \n11  Data  from  other  jurisdictions,  including  New  York  City,  demonstrate  that  the  need  for \nhospitalization increases dramatically with age.  Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F ¶ 6. \n12 See Williams Dec., ECF 22-6, at 2, ¶ 8 (reporting that most cells hold two people to identify any \nphysical or mental health concerns); compare Vetter Dec., ECF No. 22-4, at 2, ¶ 11 (noting that \ndouble cells may be used to prevent self-harm and help address medical emergencies) with Doyle \nDec., Ex. G, ¶ 3 (most men on B-unit at CFCF are double-celled), Skinner Dec., ECF 1-6, at 25, ¶ \n6 (most people on block at CFCF are double-celled).  It is also true at the women’s facility, \nRCF.  Compare McCants Dec. ECF 22-7, ¶ 10 (single celling as much as possible) with Diaz Dec., \nECF 1-6, at 6, ¶ 6,  Walker Dec., ECF No. 1-6, at 10, ¶ 6 (reporting many people on the unit are \ndouble-celled). \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 10 of 31\narrangements.  Id. ¶ 11.  Cells in PDP facilities are simply too cramped to allow for social \ndistancing when people are double-celled:13  \n                         \nPhoto of cell at CFCF    Photo of cell at RCF \nThe failure to implement appropriate social distancing results in increased risk of infection and \nundermines all other efforts to prevent the spread of infection.  Id. ¶ 11. \n  Third, PDP’s stated efforts to streamline the availability of medical services to focus on \nthe prevention of COVID-19 transmission are likely to have the opposite effect.  PDP’s protocols \nnote that, for medical complaints, “only urgent services should be conducted,” with the degree of \nurgency to be determined at the discretion of a medical provider.  COVID-19 Need to Know Intake \nProcedure, Apr. 14, 2020, Ex. H.  This stark limitation on medical services will result in medical \nproviders not responding to conditions and illnesses that, at first blush, might appear benign, such \nas minor cold symptoms or skin infections.  Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F, at ¶ 12.  But, based on \nemerging developments and understanding of COVID-19 symptoms, all medical complaints—\n                                                 \n13 The photographs were taken as part of the discovery process pursuant to F.R.C.P. 34(a)(2) in \nBaur v. Laughinghouse, No. 16-cv-2281 (E.D. Pa.) (CFCF photo taken on September 13, 2017), \nand I.Z. v. Philadelphia, No. 17-cv-1517 (RCF photo taken on August 14, 2018). \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 11 of 31\nfever, fatigue, sore throat, rash, loss of taste or smell, cough, shortness of breath—are potential \nsymptoms of COVID-19 and must be treated as such.  Id.14   \n  C.  PDP’s Current Policies and Practices are in Response to this Litigation \n  PDP’s current policies and practices, in large part, have been adopted in response to this \nlitigation.  On April 14, 2020, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent Defendants’ counsel an email informing \nthem that they had received and were investigating complaints from people incarcerated in PDP \nfacilities about the unsafe conditions and health risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Email \nfrom Plaintiffs’ Counsel, Apr. 14, 2020, Ex. I.  On April 16, 2020, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed \nDefendants’ counsel of an intent to sue, and Plaintiffs’ Complaint was filed on April 20, 2020.  \nThe evidence submitted with Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Motion shows that many of \nPDP’s efforts to address the spread of COVID-19—increasing social distancing, enforcing and \nmonitoring of previously adopted policies, and documenting cleaning and hygiene practices—\noccurred or were implemented after this date.15 \n  First, Dr. Kristen Feemster of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health toured PDP \nfacilities and recommended several policy revisions on April 24, 2020—four days after Plaintiffs \nfiled  their  complaint.    Dr.  Feemster  Email,  Apr.  24,  2020,  ECF  22-38,  at  4.    These \nrecommendations included the “increase[d] presence of hand hygiene supplies” and “faster case \nidentification through adoption of the point of care testing platform.”  Id.  Notably, Dr. Feemster \nalso recommended PDP should limit “one inmate per bunk bed to increase social distancing.”  Id.  \n                                                 \n14 Further, and self-evidently, PDP’s medical providers’ stated plans not to provide medical care \nin all situations except for those subjectively deemed urgent, will have the impact of limiting the \nadequacy of care for all incarcerated people and result in negative health (and mental health) \noutcomes for the incarcerated population.  Cohen Supp. Dec. ¶ 12. \n15 A chronological timeline of PDP’s practices and policies based on the limited document \ndiscovery produced by Defendants is attached hereto as Exhibit J.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 12 of 31\nDespite Dr. Feemster’s recommendation, as described above, supra § II.B, PDP has maintained \nits practice of, among other things, double-celling, making it impossible for Plaintiffs to maintain \na distance of six feet from all other persons at all times.16  Moreover, it appears that Dr. Feemster’s \nconclusory comments regarding PDP policies were not informed by any discussions with any of \nthose incarcerated at PDP, and it is not even clear if she had the ability to determine whether \nprotocols and policies were being implemented throughout the PDP, as she appeared to tour only \nisolation and quarantine units. \nSecond, PDP began enforcing its own COVID-19 policies only after Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nwas filed.  For example, on April 28, 2020, a Detention Center correctional officer received a \nwritten warning for failing to hand out cleaning supplies.  ECF 22-20.  Based on the entirety of \nDefendants’ production, this was the first time PDP documented and enforced any of its COVID-\n19 related policies. \nFinally, Plaintiffs have not received documentation that PDP’s current practice of logging \nand documenting its compliance with its COVID-19 related policies was in place prior to receiving \nnotice of impending litigation.  To date, Defendants have produced one log from one unit—out of \n64 total PDP units—that documented cleaning of any kind prior to April 14, 2020.  See ECF 22-\n17.17  Other produced logs recorded other activity, such as laundry service, but failed to document \ncleaning cells, telephones, tables, or any other surfaces frequently touched by Plaintiffs.  See, e.g., \nECF 22-25 (logs from April 9 and April 14 documenting laundry service). \n                                                 \n16 Further, while Plaintiffs maintain that “head-to-toe” sleeping arrangements do not constitute \nappropriate social distancing, Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F ¶ 10, it is notable that this practice was not \nadopted before Plaintiffs initiated this action.  Maj. McCants Announcement, Apr. 23, 2020, ECF \n22-27. \n17 Prior to that date, of course, Plaintiffs’ unrebutted evidence shows a near uniform lack of \nnecessary cleaning.  ECF 18-1 at 8-9. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 13 of 31\n  D.  PDP has Failed to Ensure System-Wide Implementation of its Stated Policies  \n  Defendants have submitted logs and records purporting to show a concerted effort to \nimplement protocols to protect the incarcerated population.  Those materials, however, provide \nonly a superficial view of current conditions.  Defendants have provided information and logs from \njust  ten  of  PDP’s  64  housing  units,  less  than  16  percent.    Further,  and  more  concerning, \nDefendants’ evidence, in tandem with evidence produced by Plaintiffs, shows that Defendants’ \nimplementation is, at best, uneven—a situation that is deeply problematic, as it undermines the \nability of a COVID-19 prevention program to succeed.  Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F ¶ 13.   \n  Plaintiffs have conducted a comprehensive review of Defendants’ evidence, including the \ndeclarations of City employees and PDP administrators and the documentary support cited in those \ndeclarations, and have contrasted the assertions of Defendants’ witnesses with other evidence.  \nCharts illustrating inconsistencies between the declarations of PDP’s deputy wardens and current \nconditions in PDP facilities are provided at Ex. K, and a chart illustrating inconsistences between \nthe declarations of PDP’s medical supervisory staff and current conditions is provided at Ex. L.  \nBelow, Plaintiffs highlight a selection of the most significant and problematic disparities between \nstated practices and the reality in PDP facilities:  \nThe availability of soap.  PDP reports that free bar soap is available to incarcerated persons \nupon request.18  However, multiple incarcerated people still do not have free access to soap.19  On \nApril 30, 2020, an incarcerated person with no money in his prison account reported:  \nI asked CO’s for soap and they told me that only people who have \nno money on their books can get free soap.  They told me I had to \nask  a  sergeant  or  lieutenant  for  soap  and  that  the  sergeant  or \nlieutenant would then check to see whether I had money on my \n                                                 \n18 See Vetter Dec., ECF 22-4, at 5, ¶ 40; Lacombe Dec., ECF 22-5, at 5, ¶ 35; Williams Dec., ECF \n22-6, at 5, ¶ 44; McCants Dec., ECF 22-7, at 5, ¶¶ 34-35.  \n19 See Doyle Dec., Ex. G, ¶ 5; Remick Dec., Ex. P, ¶ 3; Abdullah Dec., Ex. R, ¶ 4.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 14 of 31\nbooks.  I asked a sergeant or lieutenant for soap and he told me he \nwould check my books, but I never heard back from him. I still have \nno soap.  \n   \nDoyle Dec., Ex. G, ¶ 5.  This person had been without soap for two days.  Id.  This observation is \nconsistent with the observation of Dr. Feemster’s discussed above, supra § II.C, that PDP required \nthe “increase[d] presence of hand hygiene supplies.”20 \n  The cleaning of individual cells and common areas.  PDP states that individuals are able \nto clean and disinfect their cells daily or routinely21 and that common areas are cleaned multiple \ntimes per day, with phones and showers cleaned between each usage.22  Yet, there are multiple \nreports of persons not being able to clean their cells on a regular basis, having requested and been \ndenied cleaning supplies,23 and only daily cleanings of common areas.24  Indeed, the logs which \nPDP claims show thorough cleaning practices, also reflect violations of PDP policies.  An April \n21, 2020, cleaning log from the Prison Health Services Wing in the Detention Center that \nsupposedly showed the cleaning of cells every shift actually showed that only  “desk, keys, \ncomputer, [and] door knobs” (all areas used by staff) were cleaned and that no showers, phones, \nor cells (areas used by incarcerated people) were cleaned.25  Another log purporting to document \nthe cleaning of “showers, phones, toilets, and sinks” in the Detention Center dormitories showed \nonly the cleaning of bars, rails, floors, the correctional officers’ station, and the correctional \n                                                 \n20 See Feemster email, Apr. 24, 2020, ECF 22-38, at 3-4. \n21 See Vetter Dec., ECF 22-4, at 3, ¶ 20; Lacombe Dec., ECF 22-5, at 3, ¶ 16; Williams Dec., ECF \n22-6, at 3, ¶ 24. \n22 See Vetter Dec., ECF 22-4, at 3, ¶ 22; Williams Dec., ECF 22-6, at 3, ¶ 22; McCants Dec., ECF \n22-7, at 3, ¶ 16; Lacombe Dec., ECF 22-5, at 3, ¶ 17. \n23 See, e.g., Weiss Dec., Ex.

PDP claims that it has taken \nadvantage of a decrease in  population  to increase physical  distancing between incarcerated \npeople.28  In the first instance, while Defendants note that PDP population is at historically low \nlevels, the Philadelphia Police Department has announced practices which are likely to reverse this \ndownward trend.29  Further, defendants have not provided the Court with information about \nhousing unit capacity and detailed population of all housing units, limiting the ability to evaluate \nthe implementation of social distancing.  In any event, Plaintiffs’ declarations establish that social \ndistancing has not been fully implemented.  They report sharing of cells with up to three other \npeople, double-celling even when there are empty cells available for single-celling, consolidation \nof incarcerated people on a bottom tier to facilitate the closing of a top tier, transfer from a more \nsparsely populated dorm to a more densely populated dorm, and being housed in a unit that is at \nfull capacity.30   \n  Implementation of out-of-cell time.  PDP states that it is attempting to increase social \ndistancing by imposing “shelter-in-place” conditions that greatly limit everyone’s total out-of-cell \n                                                 \n26 See Lacombe Dec., ECF 22-5, at 3, ¶ 17; Cleaning Log, Apr. 12-16, ECF 22-17, at 1. \n27 Id. \n28 See Vetter Dec., ECF 22-4, at 2, ¶¶ 9-11; Lacombe Dec., ECF 22-5, at 3, ¶ 21. \n29 See Ellie Rushing & Robert Moran, Philly police resume pre-coronavirus arrest procedures for \nsome  non-violent  crimes,  Philadelphia  Inquirer  (May  1,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/coronavirus-philadelphia-police-arrests-theft-\nburglary-covid-19-20200501.html  (stating  that  Philadelphia  police  will  “immediately  end” \npractice of scaled-back arrests put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic). \n30 See Weiss Dec., Ex.

PDP asserts that \nincarcerated people with COVID-19 symptoms are to be placed in quarantine or isolation and are \ntested,35 and that individuals who have tested positive are not to return to general population until \nthe symptoms abate.36  However, those living within the PDP attest to a different picture, such as \ndeveloping COVID-19 symptoms and not being isolated or tested for nine days,37 or developing \nsymptoms and not being tested at all.38  One person who tested positive said she was returned to \n                                                 \n31 See Vetter Dec., ECF 22-4, at 3, ¶ 20; Williams Dec., ECF 22-6, at 3, ¶ 21; Lacombe Dec., ECF \n22-5, at 2, ¶ 13. \n32 See, e.g., Diaz Dec., ECF 1-6, at 6, ¶ 8; Walker Dec., ECF 1-6, at 10, ¶ 9.  \n33 See, e.g., Matthews Dec., Ex.

ARGUMENT \nA.  Plaintiffs and Members of the Proposed Class Are Entitled to Equitable Relief \nto Prevent Infection, Illness or Death From COVID-19 \nPlaintiffs have previously set forth the standards for the issuance of a temporary restraining \norder or preliminary injunction, ECF 18-1 at 11, and Defendants do not dispute the standards \ndiscussed as established by the Supreme Court and Third Circuit.  Courts have broad power to \nfashion equitable remedies to address constitutional violations in prisons.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 \nU.S. 678, 687 n.9 (1978); Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011).  The parties agree that the \nEighth Amendment protects those serving criminal sentences from cruel and unusual punishment \nand requires jails and prison officials to protect people in their custody from known risks of serious \nharm.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 285, 834 (1994).40  \nWith respect to the governing standards under the Fourteenth Amendment for pretrial \ndetainees, Plaintiffs take this opportunity to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment affords \nthese detainees even greater protection from dangerous conditions of confinement than the Eighth \nAmendment affords to sentenced prisoners.  See Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473-\n74 (2015) (for pretrial detainees challenging their conditions of confinement, requiring “only \nobjective evidence that the challenged governmental action is not rationally related to a legitimate \ngovernmental objective” rather than “proof of intent (or motive) to punish”); see also Hubbard v. \n                                                 \n39 See Benn Dec., Ex. S, ¶¶ 4-7, 9; see also Matthews Dec., Ex. Q, ¶ 12 (reporting that after he \ntested positive, he was removed from isolation without an additional test and while still coughing).  \n40 There is also no disagreement between the parties with respect to the standards under the ADA \nand for that reason Plaintiffs rest on their previous arguments.  The parties disagree whether \napplication of those standards mandate relief in this case. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 18 of 31\nTaylor, 399 F.3d 150, 166-67 (3d Cir. 2005) (“Hubbard I”) (reversing and remanding because the \ndistrict court wrongly analyzed pretrial detainees’ conditions-of-confinement claim under the \nEighth Amendment deliberate indifference standard).  In contrast to convicted prisoners, who only \nhave a right not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, pretrial detainees are protected  by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment from being punished at all, including by being held in conditions that \namount to punishment.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979).  When “a condition of \nconfinement is [not] reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, [courts] may infer \n‘that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not be constitutionally \ninflicted upon detainees qua detainees.’”  E.D. v. Sharkey, 928 F.3d 299, 307 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Hubbard v. Taylor, 538 F.3d 229, 232 (3d Cir. 2008) (“Hubbard II”)). \nMost significantly, the Supreme Court has ruled that there are substantive differences in \nthe way the two Amendments operate in the jail and prison contexts.  In Kingsley, the Supreme \nCourt ruled that claims for excessive force made by pretrial inmates are to be judged by a purely \nobjective standard and a plaintiff need not prove malicious intent or a similar subjective state of \nmind of the defendant official.  Kingsley, 135 S. Ct. at 2473-74 (2015).  The same is true for other \nclaims of unconstitutional conditions of confinement, including those alleged here, which center \non Defendants’ duty to protect the plaintiff class from the risk of a communicable disease.  See \nAruanno v. Corzine, 687 F. App’x 226, 230 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing Kingsley for the governing \nstandard for a Fourteenth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim); Hardeman v.

County of Los Angeles, 833 \nF.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that Kingsley’s objective standard applies to pretrial \ndetainees’ failure-to-protect claims).   \nJust this past week, in Mays v. Dart, Case No. 620 C 2134, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73230, \n2020 WL 1987007 (N.D. Ill. April 27, 2020), where the plaintiffs have challenged conditions of \nconfinement in the Cook County Jail with claims mirroring those raised by Plaintiffs in this case, \nthe court ruled in an 87-page opinion that Kingsley mandated a test of “objective reasonableness” \nin assessing the constitutionality of conditions.41  As the court stated:  \n[B]ecause this is a case involving persons detained prior to an adjudication of their \nguilt or innocence, the Sheriff's good intentions are not dispositive of the plaintiffs’ \nclaims. There is a critical difference between a claim regarding conditions of \nconfinement brought by pretrial detainees like the plaintiffs and one brought by a \nconvicted prisoner under the Eighth Amendment who unlike a pretrial detainee can \nconstitutionally be subjected to punishment. . . . The standard by which a court \nevaluates a claim by a pretrial detainee like the plaintiffs “is solely an objective \none.” Kingsley, 135 S.Ct. at 2473.  The plaintiffs are not required to show that the \nSheriff had an intent to punish or to harm them, id.; indeed, they need not show any \nsort of malicious or bad intent at all. Rather, what they are required to show—\nactually, on a preliminary injunction, simply establish a reasonable likelihood of \nshowing—is that the Sheriff's conduct with respect to the particular condition has \nbeen objectively unreasonable in one or more respects. . . .  In applying this \nstandard, a court “focus[es] on the totality of facts and circumstances” the defendant \nfaced “to gauge objectively—without regard to any subjective belief held by the \n[defendant]—whether the response [to the conditions] was reasonable.” \n \n                                                 \n41 Defendants fail to cite to Kingsley, and while it cites to the earlier ruling in Mays v. Dart, 2020 \nWL 1812381, at *8 (N.D. Ill, April 9, 2020) (issuance of TRO on claim of unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement in Cook County jail), it does not cite or discuss this latest and far more \ncomprehensive opinion. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 20 of 31\nMays, 2020 WL 1987007 at *25 (quoting McCann v. Ogle Cty., 909 F. 3d 881, 886 (7th Cir. \n2018)).  The court ruled that the failure of jail officials to provide sufficient protective measures \nof social distancing and testing, and their failure to eliminate unnecessary double celling and \ndormitory housing violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id. at *27.  The court also ordered a \ncontinuation of other policies put into effect as a result of the earlier TRO.  Id. at *29.   Other \ncourts have applied similar standards in granting preliminary relief to persons in jails on COVID-\n19 issues.  See Banks v. Booth, No. CV 20-849 (CKK), 2020 WL 1914896, at *11 (D.D.C. April \n19, 2020) (granting TRO with respect to conditions in D.C. jails); see also Gayle v. Meade, No. \n20-21553-Civ, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76040, at *18 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 30, 2020) (finding that \nconditions in three Florida immigration detention facilities violated detainees’ due process rights \nand granting injunctive relief).42 \nApplying the governing standards under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs are entitled \nto preliminary relief.43  On the central issue of whether they are likely to prevail on the merits of \nthese claims, the question is whether the policies and the practices of Defendants with respect to \nnecessary protective measures at the PDP are “objectively reasonable.”  The record on this Motion \nincludes evidence that: (1) PDP’s official policies are insufficient to protect the rights of the \nplaintiff class as they fail to provide sufficient safeguards from the deadly consequences of \n                                                 \n42 Defendants cite to the few cases denying preliminary relief, see Defs.’ Resp. at 10, 17-19, but \nall of them involved sentenced inmates and therefore were decided on the far more demanding \nstandard of “cruel and unusual” punishment.  See Plata v. Newsom, No. 01-CV-01351-JST, 2020 \nWL 1908776, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2020);  Nellson v. Barnhart, No. 20-CV-00756-PAB, 2020 \nWL 1890670, at *6 (D. Colo. Apr. 16, 2020); Money v.

Apr. 8, 2020). \n43 As Plaintiffs argued in the Motion, the Eighth Amendment also protects the rights of those in \nthe plaintiff class who are serving county prison sentences, but since relief under the Fourteenth \nAmendment for the large majority of pre-trial inmates at PDP would provide protections for the \nsentenced inmates as well, Plaintiffs rest on our earlier Eighth Amendment arguments. \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 21 of 31\nCOVID-19; (2) to the extent that policies are currently sufficient, most of them were adopted—or \nat least implemented—in response to this lawsuit, and therefore this Court has the power to order \nDefendants to continue to enforce and implement these policies; and (3) in practice, several of \nthese policies have not been properly implemented or enforced, thereby denying the plaintiff class \nthe necessary protective measures they were intended to provide. \n1.  The Current Policies and Protocols Do Not Provide the Protections Necessary \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment \n \nWhile Plaintiffs credit Defendants with responding to some of the claims set forth in the \nComplaint and Motion through its changes in protocols and policies, several are still deficient.44  \nSpecifically, PDP’s policies fail to provide for adequate social distancing or to provide adequate \ntesting of class members. \nWith respect to social distancing, Defendants still house people in dorms in numbers that \nprevent them from maintaining six feet of distance and Defendants still practice routine double-\ncelling.  In Mays, the court was faced with a similar challenge and found that policies regarding \nsocial distancing did not adequately address housing configurations.  Similar to what Defendants \nassert here, the prison officials in Mays argued that their policies were in line with CDC guidelines \nand thus passed constitutional muster.  However, the court found that while the CDC guidelines \nare an important piece of evidence to consider in assessing defendants’ conduct, they are not \n                                                 \n44 It is important to note that there are gaps in the record that are due to Defendants’ failure to \nprovide documents and other information critical to the resolution of the Motion, as agreed to at \nthe conference with the Court on April 24, 2020.  At that time, Plaintiffs had served comprehensive \ndiscovery requests (Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions, and Requests for Production of \nDocuments), but had agreed to narrow the request to “priority” information.  Plaintiffs immediately \nprovided Defendants with these requests, Ex. W, and Defendants agreed to provide the documents \nduring the week of April 27, 2020. Yet, Defendants provided only one set of documents and \nnotwithstanding a follow-up demand, Ex. D, and have not provided any additional documents or \nresponses, though they did rely on documentation not provided earlier in its Response to the \nMotion for TRO.  Defendants have stated that they will continue with production starting May 5.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 22 of 31\ndispositive.  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73230 at *86.  The court looked specifically at social \ndistancing as a critical issue, finding that the current policies and practices relating to housing \nmade social distancing “impossible or unduly difficult.”  Id. at *87.  Accordingly, the court ruled \nthat “plaintiffs are reasonably likely to succeed on their contention that group housing or double \ncelling of detained persons is objectively unreasonable given the immediate and significant risk to \ntheir life and health from transmission of coronavirus.”45  Id. at *89 (emphasis added). \nFinally, and of significant consequence, one change in policy, has the risk of increased \nharm to the plaintiff class.  As Exhibit H shows, PDP has recently limited medical care for all \nillnesses and injuries to so-called “urgent” circumstances.  That standard for access to medical \ncare, whether COVID-19 related or for any other medical condition, fails to provide the care \nmandated by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.46  The settled standard requires medical care \nfor any illness or injury that has been diagnosed by a doctor or that a lay person would easily \nrecognize as warranting medical attention.  See Monmouth Cty. Corr. Institutional Inmates v. \nLanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 347 (3d Cir. 1987).  PDP policies have long adhered to this standard \n(though of course there has been litigation in cases where incarcerated people have claimed lack \nof care), and a new policy of proving only “urgent care” is a deviation from required standards of \ncare necessitating injunctive relief.  \nIn addition to social distancing, and as described above, supra § II.B, PDP’s protocols for \nCOVID-19 testing have resulted in a situation where incarcerated people and staff remain at \n                                                 \n45 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs “cannot have it both ways” in seeking both social distancing \nand out-of-cell time to enable access to necessary service.  Defs.’ Resp. at 14 n.9.  Defendants \njustify  the  lockdown  solitary  confinement  conditions  as  the  only  way  to  implement  social \ndistancing, but there is no evidence that staggering of out of cell times is not possible; indeed, the \nPDP protocols permit just such movements.    \n46 This policy also is likely to have the opposite effect of its intentions, resulting in the failure to \naddress potential COVID-19 symptoms.

In light of current conditions in PDP, mass testing of the incarcerated \npopulation is a necessary component of an infection prevention program.  For exactly this reason, \nprisons and jails across the country are engaging in large scale testing.  The following is a non-\nexhaustive list of locations where such mass testing has occurred or will take place:   \n  The Tennessee Department of Corrections announced that it would begin testing of all \nincarcerated people and staff after 1,299 of 2,444 inmates tested positive at one prison \nin the state.47 \n  New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has announced that the New Jersey Department of \nCorrections will being universal testing for all staff and incarcerated people.48 \n  The Ohio Department of Corrections tested, or plans to test, all staff and incarcerated \npeople at three of its facilities.49  After testing all inmates at one facility, 73% of the \npopulation tested positive.50 \n  A federal facility in California tested all 1,055 incarcerated people in the facility and \nfound 570 to be positive.51   \n                                                 \n47 John Matisse, 1,299 inmates test positive for virus at Tennessee prison, AP News (May 1, 2020), \nhttps://apnews.com/5d0dde8eaa0385c9fd97e1545a5857da (last visited May 5, 2020). \n48 New Jersey Department of Corrections to Begin Universal COVID-19 Testing and Launches \nNon-Congegreate Housing Program for First Responders, Official Site of the State of New Jersey \n(May 1, 2020), https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200501a.shtml. \n49 COVID-19 Inmate Testing, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction (Apr. 19, 2020); \nhttps://drc.ohio.gov/Portals/0/DRC%20COVID-19%20Information%2004-19-\n2020%20%201305.pdf. \n50 Bill Chappell, 73% Of Inmates At An Ohio Prison Test Positive For Coronavirus, NPR (Apr. \n20, 2020), https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/20/838943211/73-of-\ninmates-at-an-ohio-prison-test-positive-for-coronavirus. \n51 Miriam Hernandez, COVID-19 infects more than half of inmates at Terminal Island prison in \nSan Pedro, ABC (Apr. 29, 2020), https://abc7.com/terminal-island-prison-coronavirus-covid19-\nbureau-of-prisons/6138903/. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 24 of 31\n  The Vermont Department of Corrections has completed at least two rounds of mass \ntesting at one of its facilities.  It embarked on its first round of mass testing after a single \nincarcerated person tested positive.52 \n  Individual facilities in Arkansas, North Carolina, and Michigan have also conducted \nmass testing.53 \nThese examples, as well as the example of Montgomery County Correctional Facility, see \nsupra § II.B (citing Cohen Supp. Dec., Ex. F, at ¶ 7), demonstrate that large scale testing is both \nfeasible and highly informative.  In most cases, testing shows larger infection rates than what \nprison officials previously anticipated and, therefore, provided key information to effectively \nisolate and quarantine individuals and prevent further spread.  Without such testing, PDP will not \nbe able to provide (as it claims it already has) safe conditions of confinement for the Plaintiff class. \n2.  The Policies Currently in Effect Were Adopted in Response to This Lawsuit \nand Therefore This Court has the Authority to Order Continued Application \nand Enforcement of the Policies \n \nIt has long been settled that a federal court has the power to grant injunctive relief even \nafter the defendant ceases its unlawful conduct, where the defendant may otherwise reverse course.  \nUnited States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953).  “[I]t is well established that the \nvoluntary cessation of a challenged practice will not automatically render a case moot.”  United \nStates v.

Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), \nInc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000). \nNumerous courts have echoed these principles.  See DeJohn v. Temple Univ., 537 F.3d \n301,  309  (3d  Cir.  2008)  (“The  burden  for  the  party  alleging  mootness  [i]s  heavy,  even \nformidable.”) (quotation marks and citation omitted); United Air Lines, Inc. v.

Dep’t of Corr., 544 F.3d 279, 284 (3d Cir. 2008); Mays, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73230, *94-\n95; Inmates of the Northumberland Cty. Prison v. Reish, No. 08-cv-345, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n126479, at *48-51 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 17, 2009) (a lawsuit alleging violations of prisoners’ \nconstitutional rights is “a quintessential instance where a court should employ the voluntary \ncessation exception”); Bowers v.

Berks Cty., No. 18-5170, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6528, at *50-67 (E.D. Pa. Jan. \n15, 2020) (entering a permanent injunction against a county jail despite prison policy changes \nafter finding no assurances that the alleged violations would not recur). \nPlaintiffs have detailed above, supra § II.C, the relevant chronology of events, including \nchanges in protocols and practices (even in the absence of the necessary discovery requested by \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 26 of 31\nplaintiffs) that demonstrate beyond reasonable question, that the current policies were adopted in \nlarge part in response to notice of this litigation, the allegations in the Complaint, and the pending \nMotion.  These include policies regarding quarantine, isolation, cleaning agents, and access to soap \nand other personal hygiene supplies.  As in Mays, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73230 at *94-95, where \nthe court issued a preliminary injunction after finding that defendants’ compliance with the original \nTRO with respect to sanitation, soap and cleaning supplies, facemasks and virus testing was not \n“entirely voluntary,”54 this Court should similarly enter a TRO or preliminary injunction to protect \nthe plaintiffs from suffering further harm. \n3.  Inconsistent Implementation of PDP Protocols Warrants Injunctive Relief \n \nEven if Defendants’ policies at this time are in compliance with constitutional standards \n(they are not), Plaintiffs would be entitled to injunctive relief if the practices “on the ground” \ndemonstrate that the policies are not being adequately applied and enforced.  See Mays v. Dart, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73230 at *76, 88-89.  Plaintiffs have summarized above, supra § II.D, and \nhave provided detailed accounting in attached exhibits, Ex. K, Ex. L, that current conditions in \nPDP’s  facilities  depart  significantly  from  what  Defendants’  policies  appear  to  require  and, \nimportantly, from what Defendants’ witnesses claim to have observed.  In short, conditions “on \nthe ground” demonstrate that Plaintiffs are exposed to a continued and ongoing threat of harm \nfrom COVID-19. \n                                                 \n54 The Mays court also had no trouble in finding that in these circumstances the plaintiffs had \nsatisfied the requirements  of showing irreparable harm, no adequate  remedy at  law,  and a \npromotion of the public interest in protecting the health and lives of the plaintiff class.  2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 73230 at *113-14.  Plaintiffs need not establish that they have suffered injury, as \nopposed to likelihood of serious illness, to establish irreparable harm.  See Helling, 509 U.S. at 33. \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 27 of 31\nAt a minimum, there are substantial and material factual disputes which the Court may \nassess through a review of the documentary evidence or at a hearing before issuing injunctive \nrelief. \n4.  The Balance of Equities and the Public Interest Favors Granting Relief to the \nProposed Class \n \nThe balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of granting the requested injunctive relief. \nThe preliminary injunction Plaintiffs request will not substantially injure other interested parties. \nSee Doe v. Boyertown Area Sch. Dist., 897 F.3d 518, 526 (3d Cir. 2018) (preliminary injunction \nwarranted where relief “will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party”).  Given the \nnature of the COVID-19 pandemic, not issuing preliminary relief would cause significant injury \nto the parties and the public at large.  There is also a strong public interest in minimizing the spread \nof COVID-19 and courts have consistently ordered injunctive relief where prisoners face serious \nthreats to their health.  See, e.g., Castillo v. Barr, No. 20-00605, 2020 WL 1502864, at *6 (C.D. \nCal. Mar. 27, 2020).  \n5.  Release of Plaintiffs and Members of the Class Is Necessary if Defendants do \nnot Provide Constitutional Conditions of Confinement \n \nAs noted earlier, the issue of release of any incarcerated persons at the PDP is not before \nthe Court at this juncture and therefore Plaintiffs do not address Defendants’ arguments regarding \nthis Court’s powers to order release under  28 U.S.C. § 2241 or its equitable powers under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 and the PLRA.  Plaintiffs rely on our previous submissions on these issues, and \nreserve the right to supplement those arguments at the appropriate time. \n \n \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 28 of 31\nB.  Requests for Injunctive Relief  \nPlaintiffs request a TRO and a preliminary injunction for current and future persons held \nin custody within the PDP, as follows:55 \n1.  Ensuring proper social distancing by: \na.  Implementing a program of six-foot separation of class members in their daily \nactivities at PDP, including in their access to showers, phones, and recreation \nand in their interactions with correctional officers and other staff, except where \nsuch  interactions  necessitate  closer  proximity  or  physical  contact,  e.g., \nprovision of health care services. \n \nb.  Limiting double-celling to situations in which having two persons sleeping in \nthe same cell is required by the health or mental health needs of these persons \nor other safety reasons. \n \nc.  Limiting  dormitory  populations  to  ensure  six-foot  separation  at  all  times, \nincluding sleeping hours. \n \n2.  Ensuring enhanced personal hygiene by: \na.  Providing unrestricted, free access to soap and disposable hand towels to \nfacilitate hand washing. \n \nb.  Providing the opportunity to shower daily, without forcing a choice between \nshowers and other activities. \n \n3.  Ensuring clean and hygienic living spaces by: \na.  Providing ready access to cleaning supplies, including bleach-based cleaning \nagents and CDC-recommended disinfectants in quantities sufficient to facilitate \ncleaning and disinfecting of floors and all surfaces in cells and housing areas as \ncurrently required by PDP protocols. \n \nb.  Requiring and ensuring that all common areas and frequently touched surfaces, \nincluding common-use items such as toilets, sinks, showers, phones television \ncontrols, books, door handles, light switches, and recreational equipment are \ncleaned at regular intervals throughout the day, as currently required by PDP \nprotocols.  Phones should be cleaned after each use. \n \n                                                 \n55 The injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs has been slightly modified, and therefore is listed here \nfor clarification. \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 29 of 31\nc.  Providing gloves and masks on a daily basis to those who are cleaning, cooking, \nor performing janitorial or other services. \n \nd.  Providing clean sheets and clothing twice per week. \n \n4.  Ensuring consistent usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) by: \na.  Providing all class members and prison staff members with masks that are \ncleaned and/or exchanged on a daily basis. \n \nb.  Mandating that prison staff wear masks while working, and that class \nmembers wear masks outside of their cells (except when showering, eating, or \nfor medical or other safety reasons). \n \n5.  Implementing testing and medical isolation by:56 \na.  Testing all class members, including those newly admitted, for COVID-19, \nprioritizing those who are medically vulnerable.   \n \nb.  Ensuring that any incarcerated person who tests positive or displays symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19 is medically isolated and remains medically \nisolated until they test negative.  Individuals in isolation should have multiple \ndaily temperature checks and monitoring of blood oxygen levels to ensure \nstability in accord with current PDP protocols.  \n \nc.  On a daily basis, testing of staff who enter PDP facilities, and requiring any \nstaff member who tests positive to medically isolate themselves and to test \nnegative prior to entering a PDP facility.   \n \n6.  Ensuring access to necessary services by: \n \na.  Providing four hours of out-of-cell time on a daily basis for showering, \ncleaning, recreation, and phone calls.  Two of these hours should be permitted \nfor large-muscle recreation.  Out-of-cell time should be provided on a \nstaggered basis to allow for social distancing.   \n \nb.  Providing medical care for non-COVID-19-related medical and mental health \nneeds based on prevailing community standards as provided by PDP protocols \n                                                 \n56 The term “medical isolation” is defined in the CDC’s Interim Guidance on Management of \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities Medical (March \n23, 2020) (“CDC Guidance for Detention Facilities”).  Medical isolation refers to confining a \nconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 case (ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door \nthat closes), to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission.  In this context, \nisolation does NOT refer to punitive isolation for behavioral infractions within the custodial \nsetting.  Staff are encouraged to use the term “medical isolation” to avoid confusion. \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 30 of 31\nand directives in effect, pre COVID-19.

Providing all incarcerated people with (i) general updates and information about \nthe COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) information on how incarcerated people can \nprotect themselves from contracting COVID-19; and (iii) instructions on how \nto properly wash hands, in accordance with current PDP protocols or practices.  \n \nb.  Providing a daily public report on the current and cumulative numbers of: \n  class  members  and  correctional  and  health  staff  who  have  confirmed \nCOVID-19;  \n  those who have been tested;  \n  those over the age of 55;  \n  people in infirmary status;  \n  pregnant women in custody;  \n  those in quarantine and medical isolation status;  \n  those awaiting test results;  \n  COVID-19 positives in cohorted housing;  \n  those hospitalized; \n  those who have died from COVID-19. \n \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant Plaintiffs-Petitioners’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order \nand Preliminary Injunction, and order that Defendants immediately enact policies implementing \nmitigation efforts within the PDP to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n   \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26   Filed 05/05/20   Page 31 of 31\nRespectfully submitted,   \n   \n/s/ Su Ming Yeh      /s/ David Rudovsky     \nSu Ming Yeh (PA 95111)  David Rudovsky (PA 15168) \n/s/ Matthew A.

Unfortunately, the\ninitial production was inadequate and we did not receive the supplemental production you promised us last\nevening.  We agreed to informal discovery and to a submission of only priority documents to enable the\nparties to see if a settlement was possible.  The most important discovery gaps which must be immediately\naddressed are outlined below: \n·       COVID Testing and Tracking: We received no COVID data or tracking information, including the\nnumber of tests administered at each facility, the results of these tests, or daily logs tracking suspected\nor confirmed COVID-cases.\n·       Quarantine and Isolation Units:  We received no information on each facility’s designated\nquarantine and isolation space, including capacity, physical size, and population.\n·       Information Provided to Incarcerated Persons:  We received no information, memos, handouts,\nor otherwise, regarding information that PDP provided to incarcerated persons. \n·       Guidelines and Policies:  We received several policies and guidelines with no effective date, no\ntime stamp, and no indication to whom they were distributed. \n·       Dr. Herdman Recommendations:  We were not provided any communications between Dr.\nHerdman and specific PDP facilities related to his recommendations.  We also have not received any\nother data or information on which PDP relied in creating its COVID policies.\n·       Facility Information:  We received no information on the physical dimensions of housing areas in\neach facility, the number of double-celled occupancy at each facility, the rated capacity of each of the\ndorm rooms and the spacing between the bunk beds, and the number of bunk beds where both beds\nare occupied, all of which is necessary to assess social distancing protocols.  To the extent our request\nwas not sufficiently detailed on these housing issues, please provide the additional information.\n·       Vulnerable Population:  We received no information on the number of incarcerated persons that\nare medically vulnerable and where those individuals are located within PDP.\nBeyond these gaps in production, the documents reference other documents that are necessary at this\nphase of the case:\n1.     Bates 12 refers to protocols on handwashing and robust cleaning.  If not in the produced documents,\nplease provide.\n \n2.     Provide any additional protocols or directives relating to social distancing.\n \n3.     There were references to quarantine areas in some of the facilities but not for the D.C. Please update.\n \n4.     Bates 95-96.  As we read these documents, inmates who test positive can be released from isolation\nwithout additional testing.  Please confirm if this is true, and also provide the number of inmates who have\nbeen placed in isolation and how many have been released without new testing.\n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-2   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 3\n5.     Bates 103-107 refers to health care services only for “urgent” conditions.  State who authorized this\nlimitation on health care and provide all documents that define or explain “urgent.”  Please also provide the\neffective date of these policies.\n \n6.     Bates 108-109 reference cleaning procedures and state that for each shift in each housing area requires\nan entry in a Sanitation Book in “RED” documenting that the required cleaning has been completed.  Please\nclarify the date of creation of each of the documents and which facilities each policy refers to.  For each\nhousing area in each facility provide the Sanitation Books for the following days: April 16, 19, 22, 25, 29.\n \n7.     Aside from the Sanitation Books we did not see any references to internal audits or monitoring of other\nprotocols.  Please state whether there are any and provide samples.\n \n8.     You provided a few emails in Bates 114-118. Please provide all emails from March 1, 2020 to present.\n9.   For each redacted document please provide the basis for the redaction.  For documents withheld\nin whole or in part because of the attorney-client privilege, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nrequire a privilege log sufficient to allow us to test the privilege claimed. \n \n10. Document D-0027 links to a Google drive link that is no longer accessible; please provide the\ndocument referenced in the link.   \n \nWe trust that that City will remedy these discovery deficiencies as soon as possible.  Please let us know when you\nwill do so and provide any supplemental document productions.  If the City is unable to complete its production of\ndocuments responsive to the above categories, please provide an explanation as to why this information is not\nbeing provided.  If no explanation is provided, we will assume that we currently possess all of Defendants’\nresponsive documents that exist for the specific categories set out in our discovery requests.\n \nThank you in advance for your immediate attention to these issues. \n \n-Nick\n \n \nNicolas A.

My last declaration concerning my opinions and conclusions as an expert in correctional \nhealth was given on April 20, 2020 and was attached as Exhibit B to Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint. Since that time, I have reviewed materials provided by the Defendants to \nPlaintiffs’counsel in discovery and materials filed with the Defendants’ May 1, 2020, \nsubmission to the Court.  I provide this supplemental declaration to offer opinions based \non my review of these materials and also based on the national and local experience \nwhich has accumulated over the past several weeks related to COVID-19. \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 9\nCOVID-19 Testing \n2.  It appears that PDP is only conducting limited testing for COVID-19 based upon \nevaluation of a small set of symptoms and self-reporting of recent contact with a person \nwho has tested positive for COVID-19.  This practice is not sufficient to protect the staff \nand residents of PDP from the spread of COVID-19. \n3.  All persons newly admitted to the PDP’s jails should be tested for the presence of \nCOVID-19.  Persons performing the swab tests should have PPE training, including N-95 \nfit test, and be provided with a face screen, surgical mask over N-95 mask, gown, gloves, \nand booties.  Gloves should be replaced between each  test.  All patients should still be \nquarantined for 14 days except those found positive, who should be isolated according to \ncurrent procedures.  I understand that the Philadelphia Police Department has announced \nthat it is retracting the practice it put into place to reduce arrests due to the pandemic.1  If \nthis change in practice results in increased admissions to PDP facilities, it will be even \nmore important to conduct comprehensive testing on newly admitted people. \n4.  For those individuals already admitted to PDP facilities who have tested positive for \nCOVID-19 infection and are placed in isolation, the PDP employs a symptom-based \nstrategy, as opposed to a test-based strategy, to end isolation for these individuals. The \nCDC has expressed a clear preference for test-based strategies as “Practical application of \na symptom-based strategy cannot prevent all infection.” 2 While a symptom-based \n                                                 \n1 Ellie Rushing & Robert Moran, Philly police resume pre-coronavirus arrest procedures for \nsome non-violent crimes, Philadelphia Inquirer (May 1, 2020), \nhttps://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/coronavirus-philadelphia-police-arrests-theft-\nburglary-covid-19-20200501.html \n \n2 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/strategy-discontinue-isolation.html \n(last visited May 3, 2020). \n \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 3 of 9\nstrategy for ending isolation may be appropriate for many recovered persons who are not \nincarcerated, a test-based strategy should be employed for those who may transmit \ninfections to high-risk individuals, those who are immunocompromised, and those who \nreside in congregate living facilities, including correctional/detention facilities.3 The \nPDP should not release incarcerated individuals from isolation without two negative \nCOVID-19 tests for viral shedding. \n5.  Beyond testing at the time of intake and for people who have previously tested positve, \ntesting should be expanded to include all persons in the PDP’s facilities.   This is of \ncourse a time-consuming process, but a schedule of testing should be established and \npresented.  Medically vulnerable persons, including all persons over 50 should be \nprioritized, along with persons in quarantine status who have been exposed to someone \nwith COVID-19. \n6.  The testing of all persons over 50 is essential due to the fact that vulnerability to \nhospitalization and death increases dramatically with age.  CDC data from 12 states \npublished on April 17, 2020 showed the rate of hospitalization for persons age 50-64 was \nthree times the rate of those 18-49.4 \n \n \n                                                 \n3 Id.  \n \n4 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 4 of 9\n \n \nMore striking is New York City Department of Health data published May 1, 2020, \nwhich shows that between March 3, 2020 and May 5, 2020,  the rate of hospitalization \nfor persons aged 45-64 was 726 per 100,000, four times the rate of hospitalization  for \nthose 18-44.  Critically, the death rate for the population 45-64 was 150 per 100,000, nine \ntimes higher than the death rate of 16 per 100,000 for those under 45.5  Based on New \nYork City data, age greater than 50 is a substantial risk factor for hospitalization and \ndeath from COVID-19 infection: \n \n \n                                                 \n5 https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page accessed 5/5/2020 \n  4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 5 of 9\n  \n \n7.  A number of jails and prisons across the country have conducted testing of all \nincarcerated persons in their facilities, including in Arkansas, North Carolina, Ohio and \nVirginia,6 and, locally, at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility.7  These tests \nhave shown that current estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and incidence are \nundercounted.  Testing in Montgomery County showed that of the 948 incarcerated \npeople tested, 177 (18%) tested positive, resulting in an infection rate 30 times greater \nthan that identified before testing was begun.  These high positivity rates are themselves \n                                                 \n6 Linda So & Grant Smith, In four U.S. state prisons, nearly 3,300 inmates test positive for \ncoronavirus -- 96% without symptoms, Reuters (April 25, 2020), \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-prisons-testing-in/in-four-u-s-state-\nprisons-nearly-3300-inmates-test-positive-for-coronavirus-96-without-symptoms-\nidUSKCN2270RX . \n \n7 Jeremy Roebuck & Allison Steele, Montgomery County’s jail tested every inmate for COVID-\n19 — and found 30 times more cases than previously known, The Philadelphia Inquirer (April \n28, 2020), https://www.inquirer.com/news/coronavirus-testing-montgomery-county-jail-\nasymptomatic-philadelphia-prisons-20200428.html  \n \n  5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 6 of 9\nundercounts, because, as recent reports have shown, the current COVID-19 \nnasopharyngeal testing may have significant number of false negative tests.8 9  \n8.  Because of the fact that asymptomatic people transmit COVID-19 to others, it is difficult, \nif not impossible, for a jail to develop an effective plan to protect incarcerated people and \nstaff members from the spread of COVID-19 without mass testing as there is no way to \nensure proper quarantine and isolation practices.  Mass testing will allow facilities to \nisolate individuals who are COVID-19 positive and asymptomatic until they are ready to \nbe discharged or readmitted to the general population,  and to quarantine people exposed \nto them. CDC guidance specifically recognizes the special case of jails, and recommends, \nwith regard to discharging persons from COVID-19 isolation status, “more stringent” \ncriteria for “people normally residing in congregate living facilities (e.g., \ncorrectional/detention facilities, retirement communities, ships) where there might be \nincreased risk of rapid spread and morbidity or mortality if spread were to occur.”10  The \nCDC in this instance recognizes that the likelihood of viral spread in a jail is extremely \nhigh, and the need for isolating infectious persons is critical.   CDC states specifically in \nan FAQ answering the the question of an incarcerated person “Do I have a greater chance \nof getting COVID-10?” by stating: “People in correctional and detention facilities are at \ngreater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of close living arrangements \n                                                 \n8 https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/21/838794281/study-raises-questions-about-\nfalse-negatives-from-quick-covid-19-test \n \n9 West CP, Montori VM, Sampathkumar P.

For the testing that it has conducted, PDP has not provided sufficient information to the \npublic.  For instance, the PDP has not explained the breakdown of positive tests by \nfacility.  Further, the PDP has continued to decline any public reporting on positive tests \namong correctional staff and jail health workers—a practice inconsistent with many jail \nfacilities around the country.12  Without reports on this important data, it is not possible \nto assess whether the spread of COVID-19 infection has been effectively addressed. \nSocial Distancing \n10.  I have reviewed documents provided by the defendants describing “head-to-toe” sleeping \narrangements in dormitory facilities.  Although these practices are referenced in CDC \nGuidance materials, they are deeply problematic.  Such sleeping arrangements do not \nprovide the physical distancing required to prevent respiratory transmission of \ncoronavirus.  Training models mention head-to-toe positioning to maximize separation \nbetween patients’ heads, but this recommendation is made when physical distancing of \nsix feet is “not possible.”  Such practices condemn incarcerated persons to high risk of \nexposure by allowing facilities to ignore the critical element of physical distancing in the \nprevention of COVID-19 infection.  I know of no scientific study which has shown that \nthese arrangements prevent respiratory transfer, and indeed, common sense predicts the \nopposite give movement during sleep and at the time of waking.   These \nrecommendations, in line with the general tone of the CDC guidance, assume that the \n                                                 \n11 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/faq.html \n \n12 The Federal Bureau of Prisons reports all staff infections on its website.  See \nhttps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.  The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections does the same.  \nSee https://www.cor.pa.gov/Pages/COVID-19.aspx  \n  7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 8 of 9\nactual conditions within jails will not allow adequate physical distancing, including \nseparation of beds, and suggests unproven alternatives.  Head to toe sleeping is “better \nthan nothing,” but that cannot be the standard when we know that physical distancing \ndoes prevent contagion with this virus.  PDP should eliminate the need for head-to-toe \nsleeping in all cases.   \n11.  It is my understanding based on review of PDP’s materials that PDP is continuing to \nhouse incarcerated people in double cells.  As I have explained before, it is not possible \nto engage in mandatory social distancing in such housing arrangements.  This is of \nspecial concern in situations, explained in some of the declarations I have reviewed, \nwhere a single person has had numerous cellmates rotated in and out of the cell.  Such \npractices are counterproductive to social distancing efforts. \nImplementation of PDP’s Stated Policies \n12.  Based upon the declarations of incarcerated persons at PDP, I have great concern that \nCorizon medical staff are not responding to complaints which are consistent with \nsymptoms of COVID-19 illness because they have declared that “only urgent services \nshould be conducted” at the provider’s discretion. During this pandemic, all complaints \nof fever, fatigue, sore throat, rash, loss of taste/smell, cough, shortness of breath must be \ndiscussed urgently with a health professional and vital signs and appropriate physical \nexamination, including pulse oximetry, must be obtained.   Hospitals are routinely \nreporting serious infection without the presence of fever, and severe pneumonia with \nrespiratory failure without complaints of shortness of breath.13 14  Further, given the \n                                                 \n13 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765184?guestAccessKey=906e474e-0b94-\n4e0e-8eaa-\n606ddf0224f5&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links\n&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=042220;  \n  8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-4   Filed 05/05/20   Page 9 of 9\nresponsibility of jail medical professionals to provide adequate health care to all \nincarcerated people, there is significant risk that limiting access to medical care will \nresult in negative health (including mental health) outcomes for the incarcerated \npopulation. \n13.  I understand that PDP has stated that it has made comprehensive efforts to address the \nspread of COVID-19 through ensuring that incarcerated people have access to, among \nother things, soap, cleaning supplies, and cloth masks.  I have, however, observed from \nthe declarations provided by people incarcerated in PDP that there are very serious gaps \nin the implementation of these practices.  Such uneven application of COVID-19 \nprevention measures prevents a serious problem as any prevention program can only be \nsuccessful if its proper implementation is ensured. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \n \n Executed this 5th day of May, 2020 in New York, New York. \n \n             \n \n                                                                                                                                                           \n14https://www.google.com/search?q=hypoxia+covid&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS867US867&oq=hypo\nxia+covid&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.5894j0j7&sourceidf=chrome&ie=UTF-8 \n  9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-5   Filed 05/05/20   Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA  \n \n  :  \nTHOMAS REMICK, NADIYAH WALKER,  :  \nJAY DIAZ, MICHAEL ALEJANDRO,  : Civil Action No. 20-1959  \nMICAHEL DANTZLER, ROBERT  :  \nHINTON, JOSEPH WEISS, JOSEPH  :     (Schiller, J.) \nSKINNER, SADDAM ABDULLAH, and  : \nJAMES BETHEA, on behalf of themselves  :  \nand all others similarly situated,  :  Filed Via ECF \n  :   \n  Plaintiffs-Petitioners,  :   \n  :   \n  v.  : \n  : \nCITY OF PHILADELPHIA; and BLANCHE    : \nCARNEY, in her official capacity as  : \nCommissioner of Prisons,    : \n  : \nDefendants-Respondents.  : \n \n \nDECLARATION OF DON DOYLE OF APRIL 30, 2020 \n \n  DON DOYLE hereby declares that the following is true and correct to the best of his \nknowledge and belief: \n1.  I am fifty-seven years old and have been incarcerated at the Curran-Fromhold \nCorrectional Facility (“CFCF”) for approximately six months. \n2.  I am being held as a pretrial detainee because I cannot afford to pay my bail.  \n3.  I am currently housed on Unit B-1-1, along with approximately 57 other men. Most of \nthe men on my unit are in cells with one other person. I had a cellmate until a few days \nago, when my cellmate was released. There are a couple empty cells on the unit. \n4.  Staff are telling people with cellmates to sleep on their bunk beds in the opposite \ndirection of their cellmates. \n5.  I have had no soap since April 28, 2020. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-5   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 3\n6.  I have no money on my books, so I cannot purchase soap from commissary. \n7.  I asked CO’s for soap and they told me that only people who have no money on their \nbooks can get free soap. They told me I had to ask a sergeant or a lieutenant for soap and \nthat the sergeant or lieutenant would then check to see whether I had money on my \nbooks. I asked a sergeant or lieutenant for soap and he told me he would check my books, \nbut I never heard back from him. I still have no soap. \n8.  There is a sink in the dayroom, but there is no soap at that sink. \n9.  We generally get out of our cells once a day, for 15-30 minutes. Fifteen people are \nreleased from their cells at a time. \n10. There are 7 phones, all right next to each other, and we are permitted to use all of them at \nthe same time. The phones are so close that you have to stand sideways to avoid touching \nthe person using the phone next to you. \n11. Inmates wipe the phones down with bleach between each group being released from their \ncells but not between each use. \n12. The showers are not bleached or disinfected between uses. \n13. I was given a mask approximately 3 weeks ago, and I received a second mask on or \naround April 23, 2020. \n14. We were told to wear our masks when we are out of our cells, but once we are out, staff \ndo not enforce mask-wearing. Men sit on chairs right next to each other without masks \non, playing cards or watching television. \n15. Staff are generally wearing masks or bandanas on their faces. \n16. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, we are given a spray bottle and a mop to clean our cells \nwith. We all use the same mop, with the same handle, and we do not have gloves. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-5   Filed 05/05/20   Page 3 of 3\n17. Staff come to do temperature checks once a week, but they do not check everyone’s \ntemperature. The last time they checked temperatures was April 26, 2020, but they only \nchecked people on the bottom tier. The last time my temperature was taken was about a \nmonth ago. \n \nI, Matthew A.

As part of those efforts, we have attempted to schedule legal phone calls with a number of prisoners.  These\nattempts, however, have been frustrated by a mixture of unresponsiveness and advisories that it is not possible for prison\nstaff to arrange confidential attorney-client calls.  We write to request your assistance in ensuring that people incarcerated\nin the City’s prisons are provided with appropriate access to counsel.\nOver the past several days attorneys from each of our organizations have sent prison administrative staff multiple emails\nin attempts to schedule phone calls.  We have been told that the calls will not be confidential in that social workers will be\nmonitoring the calls and will be able to hear either one or both sides of the conversation.  Out of the approximately 15\ncalls that we have requested so far, none has been scheduled. \nWhile we understand that the prisons are technically “open” for legal visits, it is unreasonable to expect that attorney-\nclient communications take place in person when doing so would violate CDC guidance and state and local stay-at-home\norders.  Additionally, while we understand that the administration requires some notice in order to set up phone calls, our\nfirst attempts to schedule calls were made last week and we still have not had confidential calls with the individuals\nrequested.   \nThe recent death of a female prisoner from RCF has increased the urgency of our efforts.

My last declaration was given on April 16, 2020, from the Curran-Fromhold Correctional \nFacility.  I give this declaration as an update to my earlier declaration. \n2.  I spent seventeen days in quarantine. The first several days of quarantine, I was in a \nmultipurpose room with two other men. After one of the other men ran a fever, I was \ntransferred to a cell by myself.  \n3.  After seventeen days, I was moved into general population. I was initially housed in a \nmultipurpose room on a top tier with three other men. The other men had been in that \nmultipurpose room for about week before I got there. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-11   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 2\n4.  I complained about being on the top tier because of my injured leg and mobility issues. \nAfter about four or five days, I was moved to a cell on the bottom tier. I have one \ncellmate.  \n5.  No one has talked to me about maintaining distance from other people. I spend most of \nmy time on my bunk because of my leg. My cellmate spends most of the day sitting at the \ndesk. The desk is about three feet away from my bunk.  \n6.  We have not been given any supplies for cleaning our cell.  \n7.  We are let out of our cells most days. We are usually let out for about fifteen minutes but \ntoday we were let out for almost twenty-five minutes.  \n8.  They generally let out six people at a time. There are six phones and they are about a foot \napart. Everyone rushes to use the phones to make sure that they have enough time to call \ntheir families. Sometimes all six phones are in use and that means that six people are \nstanding right next to each other.  \nI, Hayden Nelson-Major, certify that Joseph Weiss relayed the above information to me over the \nphone on April 30, 2020 and that he gave me permission to relay this information in a declaration \nsigned on his behalf.

I \neven had to wash my underwear in the sink in my cell using the same bar soap that I bought \nfrom commissary. \n5.  As of the date of my release, I had not cleaned my cell in approximately two months.  I \nasked if I could have cleaning supplies and clean my cell, but was told that I could not \nbecause there were not enough guards.   \n6.  As of the date of my release, the people on my block were getting out-of-cell time for only \n20 minutes per day and that did not occur every day due to staffing shortages (so we were \ntold).  We had to choose between using the shower and using the phone. \n7.  As of the date of my release, there were approximately 20 people on my unit who said they \nhad tested positive for COVID-19.

My last declaration was given on April 16, 2020, from the Detention Center (“DC”).  I give \nthis declaration as an update to that declaration.   \n2.  Shortly after giving my declaration of April 16, 2020, I received a second face mask.   \n3.  The week of April 16, 2020, staff handed out free soap on two separate days.  The following \nweek, the week of April 20, 2020, staff handed out free soap once.  On the Friday of that \nweek, I heard another person ask a staff member for more free soap and the staff member \nrefused.

I-dorm normally holds approximately 60 people.  I am unable to stay six \nfeet away from everyone else in I-dorm.   \n5.  I was told by an inmate in I-dorm that at least three people there were feeling sick and \nlosing their sense of smell and taste.  This inmate went to medical but he was not tested \nbecause he did not have a fever.  This inmate went home recently. \n6.  This past Saturday I started coughing and experiencing chills, headache and fatigue.  I \ncould not get out of bed on Sunday.  I was told that I could not get tested because I do not \nhave a fever.  At least two other people in my dorm are suffering from chills. \n7.  I-dorm, including the toilets and showers, is only cleaned once in the morning. I have asked \nthe staff for bleach and disinfectant, but I was told that I could not have it because I am not \nan I-dorm block worker.  The phones are only cleaned one or two times per day. \n8.  We are supposed to be able to get clean laundry (including clean sheets) once a week.  I do \nnot always change my sheets because the fresh sheets are still dirty.

I am thirty years old and am currently incarcerated at the Philadelphia Industrial \nCorrectional Center (“PICC”). I have asthma. \n2.  I am being held as a pretrial detainee because I cannot afford to pay my bail.  \n3.  I am currently housed on K-Block, which is a mental health unit. \n4.  I have diagnoses of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and \nAnxiety Disorder. \n5.  I contracted coronavirus (COVID-19) at PICC. \n6.  In mid-April, I began experiencing symptoms including body aches, coughing, and fever. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-15   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 3\n7.  After my body temperature was measured at approximately 102 degrees, I was moved \nfrom K-Block to another housing unit, which was being used as an isolation unit. \n8.  I was tested for coronavirus later that day or the next day. \n9.  On the isolation unit, the medical staff wore full-body protective gear and had their faces \nfully covered with masks, but some of the non-medical staff had only cloth masks and no \nother personal protective equipment. \n10. I continued to have a fever for the first few days I was in isolation. \n11. I did not receive any medicine while I was on the isolation unit. \n12. On April 28, 2020, after 14 days on the isolation unit, I was transferred back to K-Block. \nAt this time, I was still coughing and experiencing some body soreness. I was not re-\ntested for coronavirus before being transferred out of the isolation unit. \n13. The cell I was transferred into on K-Block was filthy, and the walls were very dirty. I was \ngiven a small amount of disinfectant spray and some paper towels to clean it with. I asked \nstaff members for additional materials to clean my cell with but was not given anything \nelse. \n14. Prior to going to isolation and since returning from isolation, we are generally let out of \nour cells for 20-30 minutes twice a day, but sometimes we are only let out once a day. Six \npeople are let out of their cells at a time. \n15. When we use the phones, we are required to leave an empty phone between us, but we \nare still only about 2 feet apart from each other. \n16. We are supposed to wear masks when we leave our cells. I received a second mask on \nApril 29, 2020. \n17. There is a sink in the dayroom, but there is no soap at this sink. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-15   Filed 05/05/20   Page 3 of 3\n18. I have enough soap for my own use because I purchase it from commissary. \n19. I have a cellmate and staff have instructed us to sleep on our bunk bed in opposite \ndirections from each other, as a means of social distancing. \n20. Being locked in my cell for more than 23 hours a day is making things much worse for \nme. I feel depressed, and I feel like I am jumping out of my skin. \n21. I am very concerned about my physical health and my mental health if I remain at PICC. \n \nI, Matthew A.

My bail on these charges is \nset at 10% of $4,000. I am also being held on a probation detainer, as my new charges \nwould constitute a violation of probation if I am found guilty of them.  \n3.

Then I started having \ntrouble breathing. I was very sick and scared. I put in five or six sick call requests but no \none took me seriously.  \n5.  On April 3, 2020, someone finally came and took my temperature. They moved me and \nseveral other women off the block to a different unit because we were all running \ntemperatures.

The diagnosis I received in December 2018 was for “pre-cancer stage 3” on my cervix \nand ovaries, not “stage 3 cervical and ovarian cancer.” A LEEP procedure was performed \nto remove abnormal cells from my cervix. \n3.  A few days ago, I began experiencing extreme pain in my lower back and thighs, pain \nand hardness around my bladder, and blood in my stool. I was alarmed and told multiple \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-18   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 2\nstaff members about these symptoms. A correctional officer told a nurse, and the nurse \ntold me, “There’s nothing we can do for you.” \n4.  Finally, today, in the afternoon, I was seen by a doctor. I was tested for a bladder \ninfection and a urinary tract infection and was told I did not have either. Despite still \nexperiencing pain, I was not given any treatment. \n5.  I am still in a cell by myself, but almost everyone else on my unit has a cellmate. They \nare being told to sleep in opposite directions on their bunk beds. \n6.  Within the last week or two, I was given a second mask. \n7.  Some staff members are still not wearing masks.

Less than a week ago, I was given an asthma pump and started getting Dilantin for \nepilepsy. I was not receiving either of these medications at the time I gave my previous \ndeclaration. \n3.

I was released from quarantine about five days ago. I was not seen by a doctor or \nmedically evaluated before being transferred out of quarantine.  \n3.  I am currently housed on the C-2 unit. The unit is full and there are two people to every \ncell.  \n4.  I am let out of my cell for fifteen to thirty minutes most days. They are letting six or \nseven people out at a time. Everybody wants to use the phones as soon as they are let out \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-20   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 2\nto make sure they have time to make a call. We have to stand right next to each other \nwhen we make calls.  \n5.  Common areas and phones are cleaned once a day. The phones are not cleaned between \nuses.  \n6.  Every couple of days, the guards pass out spray bottles so that we can clean our cells.  \n7.  We are given one bar of soap a week. It is a small bar and it does not last a week.  \n8.  I am still having a lot of pain on the side of my abdomen. I have put in three sick call \nrequests. I stopped putting in slips because I did not get a response.  \n9.  A nurse comes by every day to pass out medications. When the nurse comes around, I tell \nthe nurse about the pain and they say someone will come see me.

We requested the City to review the protective measures we proposed in the Settlement Proposal\nand inform us (a) which of the general measures listed the City agrees in principle should be in force at\nPDP; (b) which of these measures have been adopted by the City as official policy (and as noted\nbelow, send copies of policies), and (c) which have not been adopted, the reasons and what substitute\nmeasures have been implemented, if any.  This will allow us to consult with our experts on this issue.\n \n2. Discovery Issues.\nThe City agreed to preserve all electronically stored data and communications.\n \nPlaintiffs’ priorities for discovery:\nAll written policies and protocols related to COVID-19, all implementation memorandum and emails to\nstaff, and all audits or reviews of implementation  (RFP 2, 3)  \nHousing unit population for the 4 jails (dorm or cells; double or single cell occupancy) (Rog 5)\nQuarantine and Isolation Units: where, capacity, current population (Rog 6, 7)\nList of vulnerable population, with PP number\nDr. Herdman’s and the City's Health Commissioner's recommendations on COVID-19 (RFP\n14).  This relates to a larger and very important issue that we discussed briefly: decision-\nmaking regarding placements in quarantine or isolation, who decides and on what criteria when\npeople are released from quarantine and isolation, who decides on testing and under what\ncriteria, and related health measures.  You mentioned that Corizon controls or has input on a\nnumber of these matters, and that breakdown of responsibility should be provided. Presumably,\nall of these health related protocols are in policy form, or in protocols adopted by PDP and/or\nCorizon and therefore covered by our request as to all protocols and policies. \nGiven the short time frame that the Court ordered in terms of reporting back on our progress\nand the need to provide health and safety measures, we will need the above described\ndiscovery as soon as possible, and no later than Tuesday of next week.  Let us know if that is\nnot possible.\n Discovery scope: The City should inform us by early next week which of the other discovery\nrequests the City will not agree to provide and, for those requests that will be provided, a time\nframe for later disclosure.\n \nWe further discussed the need for effective means of ensuring and evaluating implementation of\npolicies and compliance and we will provide suggestions for the monitoring process by early next\nweek.\n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 26-21   Filed 05/05/20   Page 2 of 2\nWe also discussed your request for no press contacts during this settlement negotiation\nprocess and we agree and will not contact the media and, if asked about the case, we will refer\nthem to what has been filed in court.\nThanks for your cooperation and let me know if you have questions about any of the above\nissues.\nDavid\n ",

Because the current conditions of confinement within the Philadelphia Department \nof Prisons (“PDP”) facilities create an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 that may result \nin substantial risk of severe illness or death, and because PDP is currently holding Plaintiffs in \ninhumane conditions of confinement, Plaintiffs seek to represent a Class for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief of all people held in custody within PDP, including two Subclasses:  (1) persons \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 2 of 9\nwho, by reason of age or medical condition, are particularly vulnerable to injury or death if they \nwere to contract COVID-19 (“Medically-Vulnerable Subclass”), and (2) persons who, by reason \nof their disability, are particularly vulnerable to injury or death if they were to contract COVID-\n19 (“Disability Subclass”).   \n2.  All Plaintiffs represent the Medically-Vulnerable Subclass, which is defined as:  \nAll  current  and  future  persons  in  the  custody  of  the  Philadelphia \nDepartment of Prisons who are 55 or older, as well as all current and future \npersons held of any age who have a medical condition that places them at \nincreased risk of COVID-19 illness, injury, or death, including but not \nlimited  to:  (a)  lung  disease,  including  asthma,  chronic  obstructive \npulmonary  disease  (e.g.  bronchitis  or  emphysema),  or  other  chronic \nconditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such \nas congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery \ndisease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis \npatients);  (d)  diabetes  or  other  endocrine  disorders;  (e)  epilepsy;  (f) \nhypertension; (g) compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, \nHIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of \nmedication, or other autoimmune disease); (h) blood disorders (including \nsickle cell disease); (i) inherited metabolic disorders; (j) history of stroke; \n(k) a developmental disability; and/or (l) a current or recent (last two \nweeks) pregnancy.   \n \n3.  All Plaintiffs represent the Disability Subclass, which is defined as: \nAll  current  and  future  persons  in  the  custody  of  the  Philadelphia \nDepartment of Prisons who have an impairment that substantially limits \none or more of their major life activities and who are at increased risk of \nCOVID-19 illness, injury, or death due to their disability or any medical \ntreatment necessary to treat their disability, including but not limited to \nthose who have:  (a) lung disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive \npulmonary  disease  (e.g.  bronchitis  or  emphysema),  or  other  chronic \nconditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such \nas congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery \ndisease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis \npatients);  (d)  diabetes  or  other  endocrine  disorders;  (e)  epilepsy;  (f) \nhypertension; (g) compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, \nHIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of \nmedication, or other autoimmune disease); (h) blood disorders and/or (i) \ndevelopmental disability. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 3 of 9\n4.  This case satisfies all of the prerequisites for maintaining a class action under Rule \n23, which include:   \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties \non behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder \nof all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative \nparties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)–(b).   \n5.  First, joinder is impracticable because the Class and Subclasses are numerous; they \ninclude  unidentifiable  future  members;  and  the  members  of  the  Class  and  Subclasses  are \nincarcerated, rendering their ability to institute individual lawsuits limited.  While there is “[n]o \nminimum number of plaintiffs [that] is required to maintain a suit as a class action[,] generally if \nthe named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong \nof Rule 23(a) has been met.”  Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226–27 (3d Cir. 2001).  The \nnumerosity  requirement  is  easily  satisfied  here.    Currently  there  are  approximately  3,900 \nindividuals held in the custody of PDP.  The information as to the exact size of the Class and \nSubclasses, and the identity of those individuals, are in the exclusive control of the Defendants.  \nHowever, while the current class size of individuals who are 55 or over or who have certain \nmedical  conditions  is  not  exactly  known  currently,  prison  populations  tend  to  have  high \nproportions of individuals with chronic medical conditions, and the number of individuals in the \ncustody  of  PDP  that  would  qualify  for  the  proposed  classes  would  exceed  40  individuals.  \nFurthermore, joinder among this many individuals, as well as the attendant challenges in bringing \njoint cases among a transient population, would be impractical.  Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied the \nnumerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1).  See, e.g., Williams v. City of Philadelphia, 270 F.R.D. \n208, 222 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (collecting cases showing that “Rule 23(b)(2) is an appropriate vehicle \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 4 of 9\nin actions challenging prison conditions”); Death Row Prisoners of Pa. v. Ridge, 169 F.R.D. 618, \n621 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (finding 185 detainees satisfied numerosity). \n6.  Second, common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the proposed \nClass and Subclasses.  Injunctive actions like this one, “by their very nature, often present common \nquestions satisfying Rule 23(a)(2) . . . because they do not [] involve an individualized inquiry for \nthe determination of damage awards.”  Baby Neal for & by Kanter v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 57 (3d \nCir. 1994) (internal citation omitted).  Here, the proposed Class members are all individuals held \nin custody at PDP facilities.  They are all subject to the policies and practices promulgated by PDP \nand implemented within those facilities, and they all have the right to receive adequate COVID-\n19 prevention, testing, and treatment, and to be held in humane conditions of confinement.  \nBecause of these circumstances, common questions of fact and law to the Class include, among \nother things, whether PDP’s facilities are properly equipped to house all Class members safely and \nquarantine all Class members who exhibit symptoms for COVID-19; whether denial of adequate \ntesting, cleaning supplies, and the right to practice social distancing in accordance with CDC \nguidelines will cause injury to the Class members, including unnecessary pain and suffering, and \neven  death;  and  whether  PDP’s  current  practices  and  procedures  violate  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, the Eighth Amendment, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).  See, e.g., id. at 56 (“[B]ecause the \n[commonality] requirement may be satisfied by a single common issue, it is easily met[.]”). \n7.  Third, Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the Class and Subclasses.  \nCourts have found typicality so long as the named plaintiffs’ “claim arises from the same event or \npractice or course of conduct that gives rise to claims of the class members, and if it is based on \nthe same legal theory.”  Clarke v. Lane, 267 F.R.D. 180, 197 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (quoting Beck v. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 5 of 9\nMaximus, Inc., 457 F.3d 291, 296 (3d Cir. 2006)).  Plaintiffs and all Class members here are injured \nby the same wrongful acts, omissions, policies, and practices of Defendants as described in the \nComplaint.  For example, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants fail to provide sufficient access to \ncleaning supplies, soap, and hand sanitizer; that Defendants fail to enforce social distancing and \nPlaintiffs are commonly housed in a cell with another individual or in dorms, or use communal \nphones, that do not permit adequate social distancing; that Defendants do not adequately isolate or \ntest individuals that have COVID-19 symptoms; that Defendants keep Plaintiffs in near-constant \nlockdown conditions that also prevent people from showering on a regular basis; that correctional \nofficers employed by Defendants do not consistently wear masks when interacting with those who \nare incarcerated; among other things.  Because Plaintiffs’ claims arise from PDP’s same practices \nand courses of conduct that give rise to the claims of all Class members, and because they are \nbased on the same legal theories, Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement of Rule \n23(a)(3).  See, e.g., id. at 197 (finding typicality met when all putative class members suffered \n“constitutional violations under a uniform system”).   \n8.  Fourth, Plaintiffs Remick, Walker, Diaz, Alejandro, Dantzler, Hinton, Weiss, \nSkinner, Abdullah, and Bethea have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this action to \nsatisfy Rule 23 and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  See New Directions \nTreatment Servs. v. City of Reading, 490 F.3d 293, 313 (3d Cir. 2007).  Plaintiffs do not have \ninterests that are adverse to the interests of the proposed Class.  Rather, Plaintiffs’ interests directly \ncoincide  with  those  of  Class  members  to  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  to  require \nDefendants to comply with recommended safety and health measures to prevent the spread of the \nvirus for those confined within PDP’s facilities, and to release certain individuals at heightened \nrisk of severe illness or death from COVID-19.    \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 6 of 9\n9.  In addition, Plaintiffs are also represented by public interest law organizations and \nlaw firms that have decades of experience of both civil rights and prison litigation experience, \nincluding litigation relating to the Philadelphia Prisons, as well as extensive class action litigation \nexperience.  These include the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, the ACLU of Pennsylvania, \nKairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg & Lin LLP, and Dechert LLP.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know \nof no conflicts among proposed Class members or between counsel and proposed Class members.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have satisfied the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4).  See, e.g., \nWilliams, 270 F.R.D. at 216 (finding that counsel for the class were qualified to prosecute the \naction and that named plaintiffs “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class” because \nthere were no “unique defenses that would consume a disproportionate amount of time and \nattention”).  \n10.  Finally, Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to all proposed \nmembers of the Class and Subclasses, and this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  \nPlaintiffs therefore seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which is especially appropriate for \nprisoners’ civil rights actions like this one because of the potential for common resolution through \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  See id. at 222 (“Numerous courts have held that Rule 23(b)(2) \nis an appropriate vehicle in actions challenging prison conditions.”).  Indeed, the Third Circuit has \na long history of using Rule 23(b)(2) to adjudicate claims involving treatment of prisoners.  See, \ne.g., id. (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class of inmates); see also Death Row Prisoners of Pa., 169 \nF.R.D. at 623 (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class of death-row detainees).   \nTherefore, because Defendants’ actions and policies apply generally to all members of the \nClass and Subclasses who seek declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs meet the requirements \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 7 of 9\nof  Rule  23(b)(2),  and  the  Court  should  grant  Plaintiffs’  Motion  and  certify  the  Class  and \nSubclasses.  \n \n \n   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 2   Filed 04/20/20   Page 8 of 9\n \n  Respectfully submitted,   \n   \n/s/ Su Ming Yeh      /s/ David Rudovsky     \nSu Ming Yeh (PA 95111)  David Rudovsky (PA 15168) \n/s/ Matthew A.

As a result of the policies, practices, and actions adopted and undertaken by \nDefendants since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaintiffs, who are incarcerated at the \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons (“PDP”), are being held in conditions of confinement that \nviolate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Under current \nconditions, which include extended periods of total lockdown, Plaintiffs—the vast majority of \nwhom are pretrial detainees—are denied timely and adequate medical care, protection from \nphysical and mental harm, access to legal counsel, access to timely legal mail, and due process in \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 2 of 19\ndisciplinary proceedings.  These conditions have led to a high death rate and rampant assaults, and \nthey severely threaten Plaintiffs’ physical and mental health. \n2.  The named Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly \nsituated, seek changes in the conditions of their confinement to both protect them from the clear \nand present danger of disease and death from COVID-19 and to ensure humane living conditions, \nas required by the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief that would require \nDefendants to comply with recognized public health and safety measures to prevent the spread of \nthe virus for those confined at jails and prisons, and to ensure adequate out-of-cell time; proper \nmedical care; access to the courts; access to counsel, legal mail, and law libraries; due process in \ndisciplinary  proceedings;  and  protection  from  violence  from  correctional  officers  and  other \nincarcerated persons.  In the alternative, and should such relief not ameliorate the ongoing \nconstitutional violations in PDP, Plaintiffs seek an order requiring that the City reduce the \npopulation of PDP facilities to a level sufficient to allow the City to satisfy its constitutional \nobligations. \n3.  Prisons and jails have become epicenters of COVID-19 throughout the United \nStates.  The population within PDP is vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19 due to the congregate \nnature of jails, exacerbated by unnecessary crowding, inadequate sanitation, denial of hygiene \nproducts, and inadequate staffing and procedures for delivery of essential services.   \n4.  To comply with basic Constitutional guarantees and to protect against COVID-19 \ninfections,  Defendants  must  provide  adequate  sanitation  and  hygiene  practices  and  proper \nquarantine and social distancing protocols that conform to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (“CDC”) standards.  They have failed to do so. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 3 of 19\n5.  At the same time, Defendants must provide adequate out-of-cell time to allow for \nessential services such as medical care, access to counsel, family visits, law libraries, showers, \nphone calls, and physical exercise.  Defendants must also continue to ensure that there is due \nprocess for people placed in disciplinary or administrative segregation; adequate and timely \nprovision  of  medications;  and  protection  from  violence  by  correctional  officers  and  other \nincarcerated persons.  The dearth of opportunity to engage in constructive activities creates \noppressive conditions that foster abuse and violence without ensuring adequate protections to \nmaintain a stable environment. \n6.  It  is  of  paramount  importance  that  Defendants  ensure  a  sufficient  staff  of \ncorrectional officers, social workers, medical personnel, and other service providers proportional \nto the number of incarcerated persons to ensure the timely delivery of essential services and the \nprotection of the plaintiff class (“Plaintiffs”).  They have failed, and Plaintiffs continue to suffer. \nI.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Plaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, \n2202; and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. (“ADA”). \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1343(a) (civil rights jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).  \n9.  This Court is the appropriate venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \nevents and omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \nII.  PARTIES \n10.  Thomas Remick, Nadiyah Walker, Jay Diaz, Michael Alejandro, Michael Dantzler, \nRobert Hinton, Joseph Weiss, Joseph Skinner, Saddam Abdullah and James Bethea are all adult \nindividuals who were incarcerated at a PDP facility at the time of the filing of the original \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 4 of 19\nComplaint in this case, who were at a heightened risk for more severe symptoms and potential \ndeath from COVID-19 due to their age and/or underlying medical conditions, and who are or have \nbeen denied essential constitutionally mandated services.  They seek injunctive and declaratory \nrelief on behalf of themselves and on behalf of those who currently are or will in the future be \nsubjected to unconstitutional conditions of confinement within the PDP. \n11.  Defendant City of Philadelphia is a political subdivision organized and existing \nunder the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  The City of Philadelphia funds, controls, \nand operates the Philadelphia Department of Prisons.  The City of Philadelphia currently has \nimmediate custody over Plaintiffs.  \n12.  Defendant Blanche Carney is the Commissioner of PDP.  Defendant Carney \ncurrently has immediate custody over Plaintiffs.  Defendant Carney is a final policymaker for the \nCity of Philadelphia, and she is sued in her official capacity. \n13.  All defendants have acted under color of state law. \nIII.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n14.  The City of Philadelphia is still plagued by the most significant pandemic in \ngenerations.   \n15.

Correctional staff are also at risk of COVID-19 infections.  As of September 13, \n2021, only slightly more than one-half of PDP correctional staff is confirmed to have received \neven a single dose of any of the three available COVID-19 vaccines.  \n20.  CDC guidelines recommend:  (a) providing all incarcerated persons a six-foot \nradius or more of distance from any other persons, including during meals, transportation, court \nsessions, recreation, counts, and all other activities; (b) instituting a safety plan to prevent a \nCOVID-19 outbreak in PDP’s facilities in accordance with CDC guidelines; (c) making sanitation \nsolutions readily and freely available for the purposes of cleaning cells, dormitories, laundry, and \neating areas, including sufficient antibacterial soap, and lifting any ban on alcohol-based hygiene \nsupplies (e.g. hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes); (d) providing adequate and appropriate COVID-19 \nvaccinations and testing for incarcerated persons, jail staff, and visitors; (e) waiving all medical \nco-pays for those experiencing COVID-19 like symptoms; (f) providing sufficient personal \nprotective equipment, particularly masks, and to all staff and incarcerated people; (g) coordinating \nwith local law enforcement and court officials to identify legally acceptable alternatives to in-\nperson  court  appearances  and  options  to  prevent  overcrowding,  including  alternatives  to \n \n13 Letter from Faculty at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and Bloomberg \nSchool  of  Public  Health  to  Hon.

Defendants  have  failed  to  consistently  implement  the  above-described \nrecommendations for reducing the risk of COVID-19 pandemic.  \n22.  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, staffing levels at the PDP have become \ngrossly deficient.  According to City Controller Rebecca Rhynhart, the PDP was  short-staffed at \nthe start of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as of mid-September 2021, was 479 people short of the \n1,884 needed to fully staff the jails.16   Between April and August 2021, staffing levels dropped \nby 101.  \n23.  Further exacerbating the staffing shortage is the high rate of absenteeism among \nPDP staff members.  The average absentee rate among corrections officers is more than 25% per \nshift.  On weekends, it is not uncommon for more than 40% of scheduled corrections officers to \nfail to report for their shifts. There is also a shortage of other prison staff, including social workers, \nnurses, and psychiatrists. \n24.  As a result of restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe chronic and critical staffing shortage, significant numbers of class member-Plaintiffs, the vast \n \n15 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus \nDisease  2019  (COVID-19)  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-\ncorrectional-detention.html (last visited Sept. 13, 2021). \n16 Samantha Melamed, Philly prison ‘crisis’ now includes a grand jury investigation and more \ncourt-ordered  reforms,  The  Philadelphia  Inquirer  (Sept.  20,  2021),  available  at \nhttps://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-prisons-grand-jury-investigation-riot-disturbance-\n20210920.html  (last visited Sept. 22, 2021); Maggie Kent, Philadelphia's prison guard shortages \nlead to dangerous conditions for inmates, staff, 6 ABC News (Sept. 17, 2021), available at \nhttps://6abc.com/prison-guard-shortage-philadelphia-system-inmates-safety/11027878/  (last \nvisited Sept. 19, 2021). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 8 of 19\nmajority  of  whom  are  pretrial  detainees,  are  being  held  in  unconstitutional  conditions  of \nconfinement, as described below: \na.  Class member-Plaintiffs are denied adequate out-of-cell time (including \ntime out of cell that Defendants had agreed to provide, and which has been ordered by the Court) \nto  protect  both  their  physical  and  mental  health  and  to  provide  access  to  essential  and \nconstitutionally mandated services.  This lack of out-of-cell time results in significant numbers of \nPlaintiffs being unable to access showers and,  to place phone calls to family and legal counsel. \nThese solitary confinement and extreme isolation conditions  have caused and exacerbated mental \nillness and mental distress for class member Plaintiffs, and in particular persons with mental health \ndisabilities.  Plaintiffs detained in these conditions also suffer physical harm due to the lack of \nexercise for prolonged periods of times, and the harmful effects are exacerbated for those with \nchronic medical conditions that require exercise.    \nb.  Class  member-Plaintiffs  have  been  denied  timely  access  to  necessary \nmedical care and medications.  Insufficient staffing levels result in a lack of timely responses and \nmedical treatment for those seeking medical care by sick call requests, medications not being \ndispensed according to the medically prescribed schedules, and the cancellation of appointments \nwith outside medical providers.   \nc.  Class member-Plaintiffs suffering from medical emergencies in their cells \nare not provided necessary medical care and treatment and have been forced to wait for prolonged \nperiods for assistance from medical staff, exacerbating their condition and putting them at risk of \nillness, injury and death.  Emergency call buttons in the cells either do not function properly or are \nignored by staff.  Staffing levels are not proportional to the number of incarcerated people, leaving \nthose suffering from medical emergencies without necessary care. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 9 of 19\nd.  Class member-Plaintiffs have not had in-person family visits since March \n2020, regardless of vaccination status.  Access to families through phones or tablets has been \ngreatly  limited  due  to  the  lack  of  a  sufficient  number  of  working  tablets  and/or  phones, \ntechnological difficulties within the virtual visit application, lack of staff , lack of out-of-cell time \nto access the phones, and the cost of virtual visits.  \ne.  The delivery and the sending of legal mail has been subject to long delays.   \nLegal mail received by the PDP is not promptly delivereds, with delays extending to more than a \nweek.  \nf.  Class member-Plaintiffs do not have regular  access to the law library. \ng.  Class member-Plaintiffs housed on segregation units have not had access to \ncommissary, which means they often have no access to paper, writing implements, or postage, \nitems needed to write legal letters and/or filings. \nh.  Visits with attorneys, both in-person and remote, are often cancelled due to \nlack of staff and/or COVID-19 quarantine restrictions.  Entire housing units are at times denied \naccess to their attorneys due to lack of staffing and other PDP administrative restrictions..  \ni.  On some occasions, Plaintiffs have not been transported to remote (via \nvideo) and in-person court proceedings, risking additional months of delay in their cases and \nprolonging their incarceration. \nj.  Plaintiffs have been subjected to discipline, including being held in punitive \nor administrative segregation housing, without disciplinary hearings or proceedings, sometimes \nfor several months. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 10 of 19\nk.  Plaintiffs have been subjected to an increased danger of violence and death. \nThere have been at least 14 deaths in the PDP this year.17   The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports \nin 2019, the most recent year for which data is available, the national mortality rate for local jails \nwas 163.37 per 100,000.18 The mortality rate for PDP facilities in the same period was 215.19 per \n100,000.  The mortality rate for PDP facilities for 2021 is approximately 300 per 100,000, almost \ndouble the national rate for 2019.  Between August 2020 and April 2021, five or six incarcerated \nindividuals in the PDP were killed.19  These numbers represent a homicide rate that is significantly \nhigher than the national average in jails.  According to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \nthe local jail homicide mortality rate for 2018, the most recently available year, is 4 deaths per \n100,000.20  The homicide rate at PDP facilities is approximately 114.90 or 137.89 per 100,000 for \nthe period between August 2020 and April 2021, roughly thirty times the national average.  \nl.  The risk of violence is exacerbated by the lockdown conditions, which lead \nto disputes and fights over phones during the limited time when people are out of their cells, and \n \n17 Samantha Melamed, ‘We need help’: Video, reports depict violence and ‘riots’ at Philadelphia \njails,  The  Philadelphia  Inquirer  (Aug.  26,  2021),  available  at \nhttps://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-prison-riot-cfcf-assault-20210826.html (last visited \nSept. 13, 2021). \n18 Bureau of Justice Statistics, Suicide in Local Jails and State and Federal Prisons, 2000-2019, \nStatistical  Table  1,  (October  2021),  available \nat https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/sljsfp0019st.pdf (last  visited \nOctober 13, 2021); Bureau of Justice Statistics, Correctional Populations in the United States, \n2019,  (July  2021),  available  at \nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/media/document/cpus19st.pdf  (last  visited \nOctober 13, 2021).   \n19 Samantha Melamed, Another assault at Philly jail leaves a man on life support and staff and \nprisoners  warning  of  a  crisis,  The  Philadelphia  Inquirer  (Apr.  23,  2021),  available  at \nhttps://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-jail-murder-christopher-hinkle-armani-faison-\n20210423.html (last visited Sept. 13, 2021). \n \n20 Bureau of Justice Statistics, Mortality in Local Jails, 2000-2018 – Statistical Tables,  (April \n2021), (last visited September 19, 2021).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 11 of 19\nby the staff shortage, which leads to housing units being left unattended by corrections officers for \nhours at a time.  The risk of violence and resulting serious injury or death is further exacerbated \nby the fact that emergency call buttons in cells either do not function properly or are ignored. \nm.  Locking mechanisms on cell doors are easily disabled, thereby allowing \nsome incarcerated individuals to leave their cells and attack others.  Instead of repairing the locks, \nPDP has installed bolt locks on the cell doors on some housing units, which can only be unlocked \nmanually, one by one, thereby exposing Plaintiffs to an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death \nshould a fire or other emergency occur. \nn.  There has been an increase in the use of unreasonable force by corrections \nofficers against incarcerated individuals, including but not limited to the frequent use of pepper \nspray to enforce PDP’s lockdown practices.  PDP correctional officers routinely use pepper spray \nand other force in response to verbal provocations or minor rule violations, rather than to protect \nthemselves or others from physical harm.  Individuals merely in the vicinity of conflicts with \nofficers or other persons are subjected to pepper spray without warning.  Defendants have failed \nto adequately train or supervise officers in the proper use of pepper spray, causing inmates to be \nsprayed in sensitive areas or sprayed with prolonged sprays instead of short bursts.  When pepper \nspray is used, Plaintiffs have been denied needed medical care to ameliorate its effects.  Pepper \nspray and other force are frequently used without any regard for the victims’ physical or psychiatric \ndisabilities, which place them at greater risk of injury or death from such force. PDP staff used \npepper spray on incarcerated people 554 times in 2020, a 9% increase compared to the previous \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 12 of 19\nyear, despite a 6% decrease in the average monthly population. In 2020, pepper spray was used \nmore at PICC than in all but two of the county jails in Pennsylvania on a per capita basis.21   \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n25.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals, and they seek to \nrepresent a class of all individuals who are now or in the future will be held in custody at PDP’s \nfacilities (“Class”). \n24.   The proposed class includes two subclasses: (1) persons who, by reason of age or \nmedical condition, are particularly vulnerable to injury or death if they were to contract COVID-\n19 (“Medically-Vulnerable Subclass”), and (2) persons who, by reason of their disability, are \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  injury  or  death  if  they  were  to  contract  COVID-19  (“Disability \nSubclass”). \n26.  The “Medically Vulnerable Subclass” is defined as all current and future persons \nin the custody of the Philadelphia Department of Prisons who are 55 or older, as well as all current \nand future persons held of any age who have a medical condition that places them at increased risk \nof COVID-19 illness, injury, or death, including but not limited to: (a) lung disease, including \nasthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., bronchitis or emphysema), or other chronic \nconditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital heart \ndisease, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease \n \n21 Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (2020). 2020 County Prisons Extraordinary \nOccurrences Report (EOR) Data, 2020, available at \nhttps://www.cor.pa.gov/Facilities/CountyPrisons/Pages/Inspection-Schedule,-Statistics-And-\nGeneral-Info.aspx.; Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (2019). 2019 County Prisons \nExtraordinary Occurrences Report (EOR) Data, 2019, available at \nhttps://www.cor.pa.gov/Facilities/CountyPrisons/Pages/Inspection-Schedule,-Statistics-And-\nGeneral-Info.aspx. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 13 of 19\n(including hepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) epilepsy; \n(f) hypertension; (g) compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ \nor bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune disease); (h) blood \ndisorders (including sickle cell disease); (i) inherited metabolic disorders; (j) history of stroke; (k) \na developmental disability; and/or (l) a current or recent (last two weeks) pregnancy.  All named \nPlaintiffs represent the Medically Vulnerable Subclass. \n27.  The “Disability Subclass” is defined as all current and future persons in the custody \nof the Philadelphia Department of Prisons who have an impairment, including a mental illness, \nthat substantially limits one or more of their major life activities and who are at increased risk of \nCOVID-19 illness, injury, or death due to their disability or any medical treatment necessary to \ntreat their disability, or who are at greater risk of harm from the current conditions in the PDP due \nto their disability.  This subclass includes but is not limited to those who have: (a) lung disease, \nincluding asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., bronchitis or emphysema), or other \nchronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital \nheart disease, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney \ndisease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) \nepilepsy; (f) hypertension; (g) compromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt \nof an organ or bone marrow transplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune \ndisease); (h) blood disorders and/or (i) developmental disability.22  All named Plaintiffs represent \nthe Disability Subclass. \n \n22 The disability subclass is separate and apart from the medically vulnerable class as age, and \nsome conditions within the medically vulnerable class, such as pregnancy, are not factors that place \na person under the ambit of the ADA’s protections. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 14 of 19\n28.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action as \nit satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements for maintaining a \nclass action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n29.  Joinder is impracticable because (1) the class members are numerous; (2) the \nclasses  include  unidentifiable  future  members;  and  (3)  the  class  members  are  incarcerated, \nreducing their ability to institute individual lawsuits. \n30.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the proposed classes; \nall have the right to receive adequate COVID-19 prevention, testing, and treatment; and all have \nthe right to humane conditions of confinement.  \n31.  The named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the class because the \nnamed Plaintiffs and all class members are injured by the same wrongful acts, omissions, policies, \nand practices of Defendantsas described in this Complaint.  The named Plaintiffs’ claims arise \nfrom the same practices, policies, and conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, \nand they are based on the same legal theories. \n32.  The named Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of this \naction and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  They have no interests \nadverse to the interests of the proposed class.  They retained pro bono counsel with experience and \nsuccess in the prosecution of civil rights litigation.  Counsel for Plaintiffs know of no conflicts \namong proposed class members or between counsel and proposed class members. \n33.  Defendants have  acted  on grounds generally applicable to all proposed class \nmembers, and this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs therefore seek class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2).   \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 15 of 19\n34.  In  the  alternative,  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(b)(1)  are  satisfied,  because \nprosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with \nrespect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of contact for the \nparty opposing the proposed classes. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation of the  \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983  \n35.  Under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, corrections officials are required to \nprovide for the reasonable health and safety of persons, whether sentenced or in pretrial detention, \nand they must provide humane conditions of confinement.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 \n(1994); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315–16, 324 (1982).  Correctional officials have an \naffirmative obligation to protect persons in their custody from infectious disease.  Correctional \nofficials also have an obligation not to place persons in their custody in oppressive conditions, \nincluding prolonged lockdowns and solitary confinement.  Correctional officials must provide \nadequate access to medical care, must protect incarcerated individuals from violence from others, \nand may not use unreasonable or excessive force against incarcerated individuals.  Officials violate \nthe rights of incarcerated individuals when they are either deliberately indifferent to conditions of \nconfinement that are likely to cause them serious harm and that pose an unreasonable risk of \nserious damage to their future health, Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 (1993), or if their \nacts are objectively unreasonable.  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 397–98 (2015). \n36.  PDP’s facilities, as currently operated, deny the Plaintiff class the protections of the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 16 of 19\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nDeprivation of Right of Access to Courts and Counsel in Violation of the  \nFirst, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n37.  The First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution provide that \nall incarcerated individuals must be provided with access to a law library, access to the materials \nnecessary to petition the court, and the ability to have privileged, timely communications with both \ncriminal and civil counsel.   \n38.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Sixth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments by cancelling both remote and in-person legal visits, delaying legal mail, failing to \nprovide access to the law library, failing to transport Plaintiffs to, or cancelling, remote and in-\nperson court appearances, and failing to provide Plaintiffs with materials necessary to write to the \ncourts or their lawyers. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nDeprivation of Due Process Rights in Violation of the  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n39.  Under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  pretrial \ndetainees have a liberty interest in not being detained indefinitely in more restrictive conditions \nthan the general prison population.   \n40.  The Due Process Clause requires that pretrial detainees placed in restrictive housing \nfor administrative reasons be provided an explanation of the reason for their transfer and an \nopportunity to respond.   \n41.  The Due Process Clause requires that pretrial detainees placed in restrictive housing \nas punishment for disciplinary infractions be provided written notice of the charges against them, \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 17 of 19\nan opportunity to defend themselves against the charges, and a written statement of the evidence \nrelied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.    \n42.  Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ due process rights by placing and keeping them \nin punitive or administrative segregation without due process. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nViolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. \n \n43.  Title II of the ADA bars public entities, such as PDP, from excluding qualified \nindividuals with disabilities from its services, programs, or activities, or otherwise subjecting them \nto discrimination, and requires public entities to make reasonable accommodations for individuals’ \ndisabilities. \n44.  Plaintiffs, and other members of the Disability Subclass, are qualified individuals \nwith disabilities under the meaning of the ADA. \n45.  Access to medical treatment and safe conditions of confinement are programs or \nservices that PDP’s facilities must provide to incarcerated people for purposes of the ADA. \n46.  Defendants  discriminate  against  people  with  disabilities  by  denying  them \nreasonable  accommodations  in  accordance  with  CDC  guidelines  and  necessary  to  protect \nthemselves from COVID-19. \n47.  Defendants also discriminate against people with psychiatric disabilities by failing \nto provide adequate out-of-cell time and mental health treatment. \nV.  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n48.  Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court order the following: \na.  Certification of this case as a Class Action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 100   Filed 10/14/21   Page 18 of 19\nb.  Injunctive relief ordering Defendants to mitigate the serious risk of illness, \ndeath, and harm from COVID-19 and to provide constitutional conditions of \nconfinement,  access  to  counsel  and  courts,  and  due  process  to  those  in \ndisciplinary or administrative segregation in the PDP; \nc.  A declaration that Defendants’ policies and practices violate the First, Sixth, \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments and that Defendants’ policies and practices \nviolate the Americans with Disabilities Act with respect to the Disability \nSubclass. \nd.  An award of Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs; and \ne.

The Monitor prepared this report as the third of regular \nreports to be filed of record.  The Monitor’s fourth and final report in the initial settlement \nterm will be filed March 29, 2024.   \n \nI am available to answer any questions the Court may have regarding this report and \nDefendants’ compliance with the Agreement at such times as are convenient for the Court.   \n \nDATED:  October 12, 2023              Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \nBy: /s/ Cathleen Beltz   \nMonitor\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 2 of 69\nThe Agreement between Plaintiffs Thomas Remick, et al., (Plaintiffs), on behalf of themselves \nand all others similarly situated, and the City of Philadelphia (City) and Blanche Carney, in her \nofficial capacity as Commissioner of Prisons (Defendants), in Thomas Remick et al., v. City of \nPhiladelphia, Case No. CV 01959-BMS (Action), requires system-wide reform of the \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons (PDP) as prescribed in 18 substantive provisions.  \n \nThe Agreement further provides that the Monitor issue “regular reports to counsel and the Court” \nthat assess Defendants’ compliance with each substantive provision of the Agreement.  The \nMonitor will address Defendants’ implementation progress and issue “Substantial Compliance,” \n“Partial Compliance,” or “Non-compliance” findings for each substantive provision.  Where \nnecessary, the Monitor will make specific recommendations to improve Defendants’ compliance \nwith the Agreement.  A “Substantial Compliance” finding means that Defendants “have and are \nreasonably expected to continue to substantially satisfy” the requirements of an Agreement \nprovision.  A “Partial Compliance” finding means that PDP has successfully completed some of \nthe discrete tasks outlined in a substantive provision and continues to demonstrate progress \ntoward substantial compliance.  A “Non-compliance” finding means that Defendants have “not \nsubstantially satisfied” Agreement requirements by failing to complete discrete tasks outlined in \na substantive provision.  Defendants will not be found in non-compliance based on “isolated or \nminor instances of failure [to substantially comply]” or “omissions of a technical or trivial \nnature.”   \n \nWhere substantial compliance requires the revision of existing policies or promulgation of new \nones, Defendants’ compliance will be assessed based on policy language and substance, \nnotification and training of personnel, and policy implementation and adherence.  Finally, the \nMonitor and Parties agree that successful reform is ultimately measured by sustained \nimprovements to living conditions for Class Members.  As such, in issuing compliance findings, \nthe Monitor will consider whether reforms implemented pursuant to the Agreement are durable \nand their benefits are expected to outlive the Agreement’s April 12, 2024, termination date.  In \nthis reporting period, the Monitoring Team utilized data and information tracked through  \nJune 30, 2023. \n \nThe Agreement requires the Monitor to conduct site inspections “at least once every three \nmonths,” during which the Monitor has access to conduct confidential interviews with personnel \nand Class Members.  In addition to at least one quarterly site visit, the Monitoring Team \nconducts periodic site visits with little advance notice to PDP.  The Monitor also has access to all \nrecords, files, electronic files, videos, and other materials, including personnel records and \npatient protected health information, as necessary to measure Defendants’ compliance with the \nAgreement.   \n \nThe Remick Monitoring Agreement and Protocol requires the Monitor to “establish means of \ncommunication to enable Class Members, their families, and advocates to provide information \nrelated to implementation of and compliance with the Agreement.”1  In this reporting period, \nDeputy Monitor Ryan Grosso has continued to conduct site visits at least once per month to \nspeak with Class Members on PDP housing units.  Following site visits, the Deputy Monitor \n \n1 Monitoring Agreement and Protocol, Remick v. City of Philadelphia, No. 2:20-cv-01959-BMS, Dkt. 169 at 4 (E.D. \nPa. May 25, 2022). \n  1 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 3 of 69\nschedules weekly confidential tablet meetings with Class Members if more privacy is required.  \nSince weekly two-hour tablet meetings commenced on December 6, 2022, the Deputy Monitor \nhas interviewed 162 Class Members across all PDP facilities.  The Monitoring Team has also \nutilized information provided during tablet meetings to connect with Class Members’ family \nmembers who are willing to communicate with the Monitoring Team.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team has periodically received memoranda from Plaintiffs’ co-counsel detailing \nspecific allegations and systemic issues communicated by Plaintiffs to co-counsel.  With prior \nauthorization from Class Members, co-counsel provides the Monitoring Team with Class \nMembers’ identifying information, and the Monitoring Team follows up with individual Class \nMembers as necessary.  With prior authorization from Class Members, select complaints and \nsystemic issues are forwarded to PDP for response or investigation, which the Monitoring Team \ntracks and reviews.  \n \nConditions observed and information received via these interviews and protocols are consistent \nwith the improvements and deficiencies detailed in Remick filings and in reports by PDP staff \nand others who work in or inspect PDP facilities.  Information that the Monitor obtains via \nreports by and communications with oversight agencies, reform advocates, Plaintiffs’  \nco-counsel, and others independent of PDP provides valuable context for PDP’s current \nconditions.  It augments the Monitoring Team’s direct observations and helps shape \nrecommendations that the Monitoring Team hopes will produce the most durable reforms.  The \nMonitoring Team thanks these oversight partners for their contributions and commitment. \n       \nIn this reporting period, members of the Monitoring Team completed seven site visits to all PDP \nfacilities, including Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (CFCF), The Detention Center (DC) \nand the Prison Health Services Wing (PHSW), Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center \n(PICC), the Alternative and Special Detention Central Unit (ASD-CU and MOD 3), and \nRiverside (RCF).2  During each site visit, the Monitoring Team spoke with Class Members and \npersonnel in every area visited regarding Agreement requirements and conditions inside PDP \nfacilities.   \n \nThe Agreement requires the Monitor to “provide to the parties those documents and reports that \nare secured by her office which, in her judgment, should be shared to effectuate the terms and \nconditions of the Agreement.”  The Monitor has determined that documentation provided by \nDefendants and utilized by the Monitoring Team in making compliance determinations will \ngenerally be shared with Plaintiffs’ co-counsel.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team continues to meet regularly with PDP Commissioner Blanche Carney \n(Commissioner) and her staff and receives full access to facilities, documentation, personnel, and \nClass Members.  PDP remains transparent in providing information and collaborative in \nidentifying solutions to deficiencies that impede compliance with the Agreement.  The \nMonitoring Team thanks the Commissioner and PDP staff for their contribution to this report. \n \n \n2 Site visits were conducted January 6, 2023, February 20-23, 2023, March 24, 2023, April 25, 2023, May 8-9, 2023, \nMay 23, 2023, and June 22, 2023. \n  2 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 4 of 69\nThe Monitoring Team consistently observes PDP staff and leadership exerting significant effort \nto implement Agreement requirements.  As the Monitoring Team analyzes PDP operations and \nissues recommendations to correct deficiencies, PDP continues to draft corresponding policies \nand new personnel directives to implement them.  Unfortunately, PDP’s efforts to change are \nhampered by the same dearth of personnel resources that existed when settlement monitoring \nbegan more than a year ago.  As new policies and directives increase while resources to \noperationalize them do not, each successive reform directive leeches staff, time, and attention \nfrom others. \n \nPDP staff report experiencing demoralization, and the Commissioner has communicated to the \nMonitor her ongoing concerns that PDP’s conditions remain unsafe for Class Members and staff.  \nThe Commissioner also maintains that without a large influx of new staff or a significant \npopulation reduction to no more than 3,500 Class Members, PDP will be unable to implement \nmany Agreement requirements and will struggle to sustain changes implemented thus far.     \n \nPDP’s population continues to increase, and in mid-August, exceeded 4,700.  The City has \nimplemented some but not all of the Monitoring Team’s initial recommendations to manage \nPDP’s personnel vacancies.  Given the national law enforcement staffing crisis and the City’s \nefforts to date, PDP does not stand to attract new staff sufficient to implement the Agreement in \nthe near term.  Neither is it likely that PDP’s population will be reduced to manageable levels \nwithout a highly coordinated effort among local and state justice partners to curtail pre-trial \ndetention and expedite criminal cases.   \n \nThe Monitor has discussed with the Parties a third option for population management that \ninvolves suspending intake for specified groups of new arrestees until PDP’s count decreases to a \nmanageable level.  Suspending intake may require police agencies in the City to modify their \npractices to avoid new arrestees being detained for longer periods in station lockups, community \nplacements, and hospitals, which may be ill-equipped to meet their needs.  While suspending \nintake would yield more expeditious results for PDP in managing its Class Member population, \nnew arrestees would likely be exposed to other constitutional violations at earlier stages in the \ncriminal justice process.   \n \nUnconstitutional conditions inside PDP facilities do not occur in a vacuum.  Rather, they occur at \nthe end of a long criminal justice pipeline, which suffers greater deficiencies at its various stages \nthan can be remedied through this Action--or through changes to this jail system--alone.  PDP is \nplagued by acute and deeply problematic operational and cultural issues, many of which must be \nresolved internally.  This Agreement and implementation monitoring were designed to address \nsome of these issues and change is occurring slowly, as detailed below.  However, broad \nsystemic reform will require the creative reimagination of Philadelphia’s criminal justice and \ndetention practices, including a combination of options addressed above and perhaps others not \nyet identified.  \n \nIn the meantime, the trauma experienced by Class Members is profound and clearly observable \nto all who work in, enter, or reside in PDP facilities.  Exposure to extended periods of isolation, \ninstitutional violence, squalor, and neglect breach all standards for humane confinement and is \ncertain to have lifelong effects for many.  For this reason, small changes that result in \n  3 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 5 of 69\nincremental improvements to the daily experiences of some Class Members should not be \ndiscounted and efforts must continue.

Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 8 of 69\nCompliance Findings  \n \nSome of the Agreement’s 18 substantive provisions contain related but discrete action items that \nmust be completed for PDP to achieve substantial compliance with each provision.  The \nMonitoring Team created sub-provisions for some of the 18 substantive provisions based on \nthese discrete action items and issues separate compliance findings for each enumerated sub-\nprovision.  This will provide additional clarity for Defendants as they work to implement \nrequired changes and greater specificity for the Court and Parties in distinguishing between \naction items that are being successfully implemented and those that require additional attention.  \nTo achieve substantial compliance with each substantive provision, PDP must first achieve \nsubstantial compliance with every sub-provision.   \n \nFrom the Agreement’s 18 substantive provisions, 37 sub-provisions were created.  In the \nprevious reporting period, the Monitor determined that PDP had achieved substantial compliance \nwith 5 sub-provisions, partial compliance with 25 sub-provisions, and remained in non-\ncompliance with 7 sub-provisions.  In this reporting period, PDP has achieved substantial \ncompliance with 9 sub-provisions, partial compliance with 21 sub-provisions, and remained in \nnon-compliance with 7 sub-provisions. \n \nThe table below reflects all provisions and current compliance ratings for each: \n \nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n1  Staffing  PC \n1.1  No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, including but  PC \nnot limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the hiring of correctional \nofficers. \n1.2  No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, including but  PC \nnot limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the retention of correctional \nofficers. . . \n1.3  Ensure that there are sufficient number of correctional officers to cover all posts,  NC \naccording to PDP post plans on each shift at each facility. \n1.4  These measures [1.1-1.3] will continue until achieved and thereafter to maintain the  NC \nproper number of correctional officers. \n \n2  Out-of-Cell Time  PC \n2.1  Upon the entry of this Agreement, and no later than May 15, 2022, Defendants shall  PC \nensure that each incarcerated person at the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (PDP), \nwith the exception of those who are housed in a designated segregation unit, shall be \nprovided the following out-of-cell times for the following periods: (a) no later than \nMay 15, 2022, no less than four hours of out-of-cell time each day; and (b) no later \nthan August 1, 2022, no less than five hours of out-of-cell time each day. \n  7 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 9 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n2.2  The parties agree that out-of-cell times under normal operations of the PDP have  NC \nranged from 8-10 hours a day and increases of out-of-cell time should continue to be \nmade beyond the August 1, 2022 standard, with a presumptive expected increase to \nsix hours by October 15, 2022.  The parties agree that this next step shall be based on \nthe recommendations of the Court appointed Monitor, infra, para. 19, as to scope and \ntiming. Accordingly, the Monitor shall provide recommendations to the Court, based \non the Monitor’s analysis of all relevant factors and proposals by the parties, on the \nnext increase in out-of-cell time no later than October 1, 2022, and thereafter on a \nquarterly basis.  See also para. 4, infra. \n3  Out-of-Cell/Segregation  PC \n3.1  Defendants shall ensure that persons on segregation units shall be provided: (a) no  NC \nlater than May 1, 2022, thirty minutes out-of-cell time on a daily basis and (b) no \nlater than July 1, 2022, no less than one hour each day.       \n3.2  Defendants further agree that they will continue their practice of not placing  PC \nincarcerated people in segregation units due to the lack of space or staffing on other \nunits. \n4  Resume Normal Operations  NC \n   \nBy November 1, 2022, based on discussions between the parties and the Court-\nappointed Monitor, the parties and the Monitor shall submit to the Court a plan for a \nreturn to normal operations of the PDP (regarding out-of-cell time, programming, \nvisits, and other services).  During the period that precedes a return to normal \noperations, if the Monitor determines that the Defendants are not providing the \nagreed-upon out-of-cell time, Defendants must provide specific reasons for non-\ncompliance to the Plaintiffs and the Monitor.  The parties and the Monitor shall then \nengage in discussions to resolve the issues in dispute.  If no agreement is reached, \nDefendants may move for the amendment or modification of these provisions, but \nonly upon good cause shown, and the Plaintiffs may move for appropriate \ni ntervention by the Court, including possible contempt of court sanctions. \n5  Healthcare  PC \n   \nThe Defendants shall provide adequate and timely medical and mental health \ntreatment to all incarcerated persons.  The Defendants agree to institute the programs \nand measures (referred to as “the Backlog Plan”) set forth by Bruce Herdman, PDP \nChief of Medical Operations, at his deposition of March 21, 2022, to address the \nexisting backlog.  The “Backlog Plan” is a new, three-month effort to see backlogged \npatients as soon as possible.  The City has allocated substantial funding to allow \nCorizon Health services to engage additional agency staff to augment its full-time \nstaff to further reduce backlogs.  Four agencies are contracted to provide staff \ntowards this end. Agencies will provide additional providers, including MD/DOs, \nNPs, LCSWs, and RNs for this effort.  Based on these programs and measures, the \nDefendants agree to substantially eliminate the existing backlog by August 1, 2022, \nand thereafter to continue addressing any remaining backlog consistent with these \nprograms and measures.  Substantial elimination shall mean reduction to a backlog of \nn o more than ten to fifteen percent of the current backlog. \n6  Behavioral Health in Segregation  PC \n   \nBy September 30, 2022, the PDP and [YesCare] shall re-establish a mental health \nprogram for persons who are in segregation units. \n7  Law Library Access  PC \n  8 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 10 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \n  Sta tus \nPDP will continue to provide law library access for all incarcerated individuals.  The \nMonitor and the parties will discuss access and scheduling matters and the Monitor \nshall make any recommendations on these matters by August 1, 2022. \n8  Discipline  PC \n8.1  All future disciplinary proceedings at the PDP shall be held in accord with established  PC \ndue process rights, including the presence of the incarcerated person who is the \nsubject of the proceeding.

Carroll, 495 \nF.3d 62, 70–71 (3d Cir. 2007). \n8.2  The PDP shall expunge the disciplinary records for all persons who were not  SC \npresent at their disciplinary hearings for the period March 2020 to the current date \n[April 12, 2022]. . . \n8.3  [PDP shall] release from segregation all incarcerated persons who were not present at  SC \ntheir disciplinary hearings but who are [on April 12, 2022] still serving a disciplinary \nsentence, or who are in administrative segregation following a disciplinary sentence \nimposed without a hearing. . . \n8.4  [PDP shall] cancel sanctions [imposed in hearing held between March 2020 and   SC \nApril 12, 2022] that require payments for damage to property or other restitution, \nand/or return payments made by persons who were required to pay for damage to \nproperty or other harms.  Provided, however, the PDP may seek to conduct due \nprocess hearings for individuals covered by this provision who are still in segregation, \nbut only: (a) if there is a small and discrete number of such cases, and (b) upon first \nproviding counsel for Plaintiffs the names of those persons, the disciplinary charges, \nand information related to the length of placement in segregation.  Nothing in this \nsection prohibits persons subject to the disciplinary process set forth above from \nasserting individual legal challenges to the discipline.  Defendants shall provide to \ncounsel for plaintiffs a list of individuals and disciplinary matters subject to this \nexception by April 15, 2022. \n9  Tablets  PC \n9.1  PDP has undertaken expansion efforts to increase the number of tablets available  PC \nwithin the PDP facilities by adding eighty (80) additional tablets, according to \noperational capabilities and housing designs.  The expansion of tablets is as follows: \nfrom four (4) to six (6) tablets on each housing unit at CFCF for a total of fifty-six \n(56) additional tablets; and, at RCF, expanding from six (6) to eight (8) tablets on the \n[first floor] (4 housing units) and expanding from eight (8) to twelve (12) tablets on \nthe [2nd and 3rd floors] of RCF (4 larger units) for a total of twenty-four (24) \nadditional tablets at RCF.  This expansion process will be completed by May 1, 2022. \n9.2  The parties and the Monitor will discuss any future increases in the number of tablets  PC \nbased on all relevant factors, including operational feasibility and physical capacity. \nFurther, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies and practices \nare necessary to address equitable and fair individual access to available tablets, and \nif so, the PDP shall implement agreed upon practices. \n10  Phone Calls  PC \n  9 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 11 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n10.1  PDP agrees to maintain 15 minutes of free phone calls on a daily basis for the PDP  PC \npopulation.  Further, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies \nand practices are necessary to address equitable and fair individual access to phones \nand, if so, the PDP shall implement agreed upon practices. \n10.2  Upon a return to normal operations, the PDP will revert to the provision of 10  NC \nminutes of free phone calls. \n11  PICC Emergency Call Systems  PC \n  The Monitor and the parties shall discuss the issues unique to PICC regarding  PC \nemergency call systems and access to phones and/or tablets and determine whether \nany policies and practices are necessary to address this matter considering all relevant \nfactors, including operational feasibility and physical capacity. \n12  Locks  PC \n12.1  PDP initiated the lock replacement program for PICC. . . which will be completed by  PC \nJune 30, 2022. \n12.2   PDP initiated the lock replacement program for. . .RCF, which will be completed by  PC \nJune 30, 2022. \n12.3  For the repair of call button devices in existing facilities, PDP will conduct a one-time  SC \ntest of all call buttons and make any necessary repairs by August 1, 2022. \n12.4  Any future complaints related to the operation of call buttons shall be addressed  PC \nthrough work orders, which will be addressed and completed by Defendants in a \ntimely manner. \n12.5  PDP will provide refresher training before June 1, 2022, to correctional staff on PDP  SC \npractices with respect to responses to the emergency call button system. \n13  Visiting  PC \n13.1  As of March 7, 2022, PDP reinstituted in-person visitation for all vaccinated  SC \nincarcerated persons with family members. PDP is in the process of increasing \ncapacity for in-person visits by increasing the number of visits that can be \naccommodated during the current hourly schedule.  At a minimum, current CFCF \nvisiting shall be increased by 8 slots, PICC increased by 4 slots, and RCF increased \nby 2 slots. \n13.2  Further, the parties and Monitor shall discuss all matters related to visitation, and the  PC \nmonitor shall issue recommendations on these issues. \n13.3  PDP reaffirms that it will acknowledge and record the vaccination status of those  SC \nindividuals who provide information that they were vaccinated. \n14  Attorney Visiting  PC \n14.1  PDP shall continue to follow a policy of providing attorneys with access to their  PC \nclients within 45 minutes of their scheduled visit. \n14.2  For remote legal visits (in all formats), the PDP shall continue to ensure that the client  PC \nis on the call/computer/video within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time of the \nappointment. \n  10 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 12 of 69\nProvision  Requirements  Compliance \nStatus \n14.3  For these time frames, PDP will not be responsible for delays caused by the  NC \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, but where a delay is caused by the \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, PDP will inform the attorney of the \ndelay. \n15  COVID-19 Testing  SC \n   \nThe PDP shall continue the present policy regarding testing of persons who are \nscheduled for court.  Those who are housed on “green blocks” are either fully \nvaccinated or are not considered to have been exposed to COVID-19.  They will be \nrapid-tested the night before court, and they will be brought to court if they receive \nnegative test results.  Those housed on a “yellow block” may have been exposed to a \nCOVID-19-positive individual, and they will be rapid-tested twice, the night before \ncourt and the morning of court.  They will be transported to court if both tests are \nnegative.  Those housed on a “red block” are COVID-19 positive and will be isolated \nfor ten days and not brought to court during that time frame.  These protocols will be \nmaintained subject to continued cooperation from criminal justice partners and on the \nadvice of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.  Provided, however, that the \nDefendants shall not unilaterally change the protocols and they shall timely notify \nP  laintiffs’ counsel of any change or proposed change in these protocols. \n16  Quarantine  SC \n \nIf there becomes a need in the future for use of quarantine housing areas at PDP,     \nCDC guidelines shall continue to be followed for those who have been exposed to \nCOVID-19.  Under current policy, see Interim Guidance on Management for \nCorrectional and Detention Centers, June 9, 2021, for persons who are vaccinated \nand are exposed to a person with COVID-19, but test negative, they shall not be \nquarantined; for those who have been exposed to COVID-19, but who have not been \nvaccinated, and test negative, they shall be quarantined for a period of ten days and \nreleased at that time if they test negative. \n17  Sanitation  PC \n17.1  Defendants agree to continue conducting the weekly General Inspection (“GI”)  PC \ncleaning days with supplies provided by officers to clean cells and housing areas. \n17.2  [Defendants agree] to provide regular laundry services under current PDP policies.  PC \n18  Use-of-Force  PC \n   \nPDP policies and training address correctional staff’s use of force, use of pepper \nspray, de-escalation measures, and an incarcerated person’s non-compliance with \nverbal commands.  The parties agree that correctional officers should follow de-\nescalation measures provided in PDP policies.  The Monitor shall review these issues \nand make recommendations based on a review of all relevant material and factors.  In \nthe interim, PDP shall advise and re-train correctional officers on the proper \napplication of the Use of Force and Restraints Policy, 3.A.8, and with respect to de-\nescalation requirements in accordance with the PDP policy which in part states: \n“Force is only used when necessary and only to the degree required to control the \ninmate(s) or restore order…The use of pepper spray is justifiable when the Officer’s \npresence and verbal command options have been exhausted and the inmate remains \nnon-compliant or the inmate’s level of resistance has escalated….  Staff will not use \npepper spray as a means of punishment, personal abuse, or harassment.” \n  \n  11 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 13 of 69\nSubstantive Provision 1—Staffing   \n \nSub-provision 1.1--No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, \nincluding but not limited to signing and retention bonuses, to enhance the hiring of correctional \nofficers. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nSome measures to increase recruitment, hiring, and retention have been implemented, but there \nhas been no improvement in staffing levels for critical positions in this reporting period.  The \nfollowing table reflects changes in security, maintenance, and human resources vacancies since \nthe last reporting period:  \n \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons Vacancy Report \nDecember 2022 and June 2023 \n                 \n         \nDecember 2022  June 2023 \n \nChange in  Current Vacancy \nPosition \nBudgeted  Filled  Vacant  Filled  Vacant  Vacancies  Rate \nClassification \n(+/ -)  (+/- change) \n  Officers  1719  973  746  967  752  +6  44% (+1%) \n \nSergeants  129  77  52  73  56  +4  43% (+3%) \n \nSworn Staff  Lieutenants  56  46  10  52  4  -6  7% (-11%) \nCaptains  31  24  7  20  11  +4  35% (+12%) \nCustody Total  1935  1120  815  1112  823  +8  43% (+1%) \n  Trades Worker I  8  5  3  4  4  +1  50% (+12%) \n \nTrades Worker II  23  8  15  8  15  0  65% (0) \n \nMaintenance  HVAC Mechanic  3  2  1  2  2  +1  67% (+34%) \nStaff \nBuilding Engineer  1  0  1  2  1  0  100% (0) \nMaintenance Group \n1  0  1  1  1  0  100% (0) \nLeader \nTotal Maintenance  36  15  21  17  23  +2  64% (+6%) \n  HR Professional  2  0  2  2  0  -2  0 (-100%) \nHuman \nHR Program Admin  2  2  0  2  0  0  0% (0) \nResources \nHR Manager 3  1  1  0  1  0  0  0% (0) \n(HR) Staff \nHR Total  5  3  2  5  0  -2  0% (-40%) \nPDP TOTAL  All Positions  2186  1321  865  1311  875  +10  40% (0) \n \nPDP filled two human resources positions, however, sworn and maintenance personnel vacancies \ncontinued to increase in this reporting period.  \n \nPDP reports that the City’s Human Resources department is increasing engagement with \nemployees who are out on long-term sick leave and is preparing a status report of off-duty staff \nengagement for the Monitoring Team’s review in the next reporting period.   \n  12 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 14 of 69\nHiring bonuses, salary increases, and attendance incentives following the various arbitration \nawards were designed to attract new candidates and are now being included in recruitment \nadvertising.3  Also supporting recruitment, the City has modified its practice of limiting \napplication periods for new recruits.  The City’s new process essentially provides for continuous- \nfill applications consistent with the Monitoring Team’s recommendation.  It is premature to \ndetermine whether new application protocols and the other incentives will improve hiring yields, \nhowever, the efforts are positive steps. \n   \nPDP has successfully increased the number of academies and new hires in 2023, but the retention \nrate of new hires remains low.

In the first six months of 2023, PDP held five academies yielding a total of 101 new \ncadets, marking a 40 percent increase in new hires in the first half of 2023.  Despite the \nincreases, PDP is not retaining enough new hires to address its staffing crisis.  In the last \nreporting period, the average retention rate of cadets who graduated from academy classes 21-04, \n21-05, and 22-01 in the first half of 2022 was 61 percent.  As of June 2023, the average retention \nrate for those three academy classes decreased to 43 percent.  To improve overall vacancies, new \nhires and employee retention must both increase. \n   \nAvailable data on recruitment yields is depicted in the following table: \n \nPhiladelphia Department of Prisons Average Recruitment Yields  \nfor New Hires after January 1, 2021 \n  \nCertification List  Total Applicants  Total Hired  Rate (%)  List Status \n2020-0210  228  36  15.8  Closed \n2021-0906  758  50  6.6  Closed \n2022-0221  298  16  5.4  Closed \n2022-0516  245  25  10.2  Closed \n2022-0905  493  34  6.9  Closed \n \nTotal Closed  2022  161  9 \n2022-1212  422  34  NA  In Process \n2023-0306  563  11  NA  In Process \n \nTotal Open  985  45  NA \n \nAlso positive, PDP appears on target to accept twice as many applications in 2023 as it received \nin the same periods in 2021 and 2022 and achieved a slight increase in new hires in this rating \nperiod.  \n \nOn May 8, 2023, PDP reported the escape of two Class Members from PICC.  The investigation \nis pending, however, the Commissioner anticipates that staff negligence, as well as insufficient \nstaffing were contributing factors.  Generally, PDP does not have enough personnel at the ranks \nof lieutenant and sergeant to maintain a consistent supervisory presence inside facilities and \nmonitor all housing units.  PDP also identified inadequate housing unit supervision during the \nreview of at least one Class Member death in this reporting period.  Crucial custody transport \nand emergency backfill positions that support housing units also remain unfilled.  PDP’s internal \ncritical incident review processes have greatly improved in the last year.  Difficult and \ntransparent discussions among involved or witness personnel, facility leadership, and executives \nreveal specific areas in need of corrective action.  PDP reports that it is in the process of \npromoting 10 new sergeants and 10 new lieutenants, which should assist PDP in implementing \nAgreement requirements.  The Monitoring Team is not confident, however, that PDP can \nremediate all identified deficiencies, including recommendations from a forthcoming post-escape \nsecurity analysis, with limited personnel.  Working conditions in PDP facilities are seeing some \n  14 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 16 of 69\nimprovements but remain unsafe, and the staffing crisis is an absolute barrier to compliance.  \nThe situation is dire, and PDP should expect more critical incidents as long as it persists.     \n \nSub-provision 1.2--No later than April 20, 2022, the Defendants shall implement measures, \nincluding but not limited to hiring and retention bonuses, to enhance the retention of \ncorrectional officers. . . \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nThere are preliminary signs that measures taken may be raising retention rates. \n \nA January 27, 2023, Supplemental Arbitration Award provides for attendance incentives for \nemployees assigned to a 12-hour shift, among other incentives.4  PDP has made progress in \nimplementing its Twelve-hour Shift Initiative in all facilities.  The incentives appear to have \nattracted a high percentage of PDP employees to volunteer for the 12-hour shift, which now \nconstitute the large majority of PDP’s overall posts.  The other benefits pursuant to the \narbitration awards may also support employee retention.5   \n \nIn the four-month period immediately following the August 12, 2022, arbitration award (which \nfacilitated step-based salary increases, retention bonuses, longevity pay, and other positive \nsteps), average monthly voluntary separations reduced from 22.75 in the period January through \nAugust 2022 to 10.75, or pre-pandemic levels.  In the first six months of 2023, average monthly \nvoluntary separations were higher than the same periods in 2019 and 2020 but remain lower than \n2021.  The following table depicts the average number per month of PDP employees who \nvoluntarily separated pre-retirement from January 2022 through June 2023: \n \nAverage Voluntary Separations by PDP Employees \n  Pre-Arbitration Award  Post-Arbitration Award \n \n2019  2020  2021   Jan-Aug 2022  Sep-Dec 2022   Jan-June 2023 \nMonthly \n10  11  24.25  22.75  10.75  14.8 \nAverage \n   \nShort term retention rates have risen since the August 12, 2022, arbitration award.  It will be \nimportant to track retention of those new hires to see if those increases hold. \n \nPDP held an employee recognition week in May 2023, which some staff reported was well \nreceived.  PDP also created and, in September 2023, filled an Employee Wellness Coordinator \nposition.  However, the City has not initiated a robust employee wellness program to support \nretention of PDP personnel.  PDP’s work environment remains uniquely stressful for employees \n \n4 In the Matter of Arbitration Between AFSCME District Council 33, Local 159, and Local 1673 and City of \nPhiladelphia at 2-3 (decision date, January 27, 2023) Supplemental Interest Arbitration Award, City and AFSCME \nDC 33, Local 159, Local 1637 | Department of Labor | City of Philadelphia. \n5 See awards cited infra note 3. \n  15 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 17 of 69\nand is exacerbated by forced overtime shifts.  Greater staff recognition is meaningful and may \ngive at least a short-term boost to morale, but it is insufficient to equip even the most dedicated \nand experienced personnel with the tools necessary to persevere in the current work \nenvironment. \n   \nSub-provision 1.3--Ensure that there are sufficient number of correctional officers to cover all \nposts, according to PDP post plans on each shift at each facility. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n \nWith a 44 percent vacancy rate for correctional officers as of June 30, 2023, PDP is simply \nunable to cover all posts in its post plans consistent with this sub-provision.   \n \nAs previously reported, PDP’s systems for tracking posts and the staff required to fill them were \ninadequate to measure compliance with this sub-provision.6  In the last reporting period, the \nMonitor retained an expert to provide technical support and training, and to update PDP’s post \nand personnel tracking systems.  As with all carceral systems, PDP’s post plans are dynamic and \nrequire regular updates based on population and operational changes.  For example, PDP’s \ntransition from an 8-hour to a 12-hour shift model required broad changes to the post plans that \nwere referenced during settlement negotiations. \n   \nPDP’s staffing rosters now reflect nearly every position identified in its current post plan, and \npersonnel now possess the expertise to reconcile and maintain rosters as plans adjust.  If progress \ncontinues as planned, PDP should be able to generate reports in the next reporting period that \nmeasure the number of unfilled posts at each facility and the reasons for each post vacancy.  \nImprovements should allow the Monitoring Team to verify the accuracy of personnel \ninformation reported and optimally measure compliance with this sub-provision. \n  \nPDP’s anticipated staffing analysis, now reportedly being completed by the end of 2023, will not \nresolve PDP’s staffing crisis.  It will, however, assist PDP in gaining an up-to-date understanding \nof current staffing needs, developing a roadmap for a return to normal operations, and identifying \nareas for interim relief.  For example, the Monitoring Team recommended that PDP redirect at \nleast 70 peace officers who are currently performing non-peace officer functions, such as \nmaintaining records and issuing and replacing computers.  A staffing analysis will identify how \nto transition those functions to civilian personnel and reserve peace officers for critical peace \nofficer roles.   \n \nThere are also functions within the jails that do not require direct contact with Class Members, \nbut which are being performed by sworn personnel, such as control booth operators.  These posts \nmay also be converted to alternative classifications.  The Monitoring Team is hopeful that PDP’s \nstaffing analysis will support efficient reorganization of PDP’s current resources, facilitate \npartnerships with labor, and offer some relief as PDP works to reduce vacancies. \n     \n \n6 Monitor’s Second Report, Remick v. City of Philadelphia, No. 2:20-cv-01959-BMS, Dkt. 185 at 16 (Mar. 3, 2023). \n  16 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 18 of 69\nUltimately, the staffing crisis can only be addressed through aggressive hiring, effective retention \nstrategies, and collaboration with employees on long-term leave to return them to work in \nfunctions they are able to perform.  Defendants have made improvements but have not yet met \nthe requirements of this provision or initiated the comprehensive return-to-work strategy \nrecommended by the Monitoring Team.   \n \nSub-provision 1.4--These measures [1.1-1.3] will continue until achieved and thereafter to \nmaintain the proper number of correctional officers. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance   \n \nA partial or substantial compliance rating first requires PDP to achieve compliance with sub-\nprovision 1.3.  \n   \nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 1—Staffing, from the Monitor’s First Report: \n   \n1.  Expand existing contracts to correct maintenance vacancies that severely impact conditions \nof confinement at ASD-CU and MOD 3, DC, and PICC.  \nPDP’s maintenance contract has been expanded to allow contractors to perform all \nrepairs and maintenance at PICC and DC when City maintenance employees are unable \nto meet demands.     \n2.  Determine whether the current salary and benefits structures pursuant to the arbitration award \nand other efforts by Defendants are sufficiently competitive with other jurisdictions and \nagencies to attract applicants, and if not, supplement benefits accordingly. \nPDP reports that it is still in the process of implementing this recommendation. \n3.  Retain a qualified recruitment firm to assist in guiding the City’s efforts, which should \ninclude salary surveys in support of the previous recommendation, and other validated \nrecruitment and retention strategies.   \nAs of the filing of this report, Defendants have not implemented this recommendation.   \n4.  Engage an independent staffing analysis to determine true staffing needs for each facility.  \nThe analysis should be completed by someone with specific expertise in jail staffing studies. \nPDP reports that a staffing analysis will be completed by the end of 2023.   \n5.  Evaluate which PDP functions currently performed by sworn personnel can be performed by \ncivilians (information technology, records, intake and release, cashier, etc.) and identify or \nexpand civilian employees or contracted services accordingly.  \nPDP reports that it is attempting to implement this recommendation.  The matter will be \naddressed in an initial arbitration hearing scheduled for November 2023.   \n6.  Simplify the City’s lengthy hiring and onboarding processes that reportedly create delays in \nrecruits reporting to PDP academies.   \nAs of the filing of this report, Defendants have not implemented this recommendation. \n7.  Establish continuous-fill civil service hiring lists during the staffing crisis. \nThe City reports that the newly structured back-to-back hiring lists function as the \ncontinuous-fill lists recommended here.  It is too soon to measure any success of the new \nhiring protocols, but it is positive that the City has taken steps to implement this \nrecommendation.   \n  17 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 19 of 69\n8.  Assess the impact of Philadelphia’s employee residency requirements on PDP’s hiring \noutcomes and consider whether permanent exemptions or modifications are appropriate. \nThe City has not disclosed to the Monitoring Team whether it intends or has taken any \nsteps to implement this recommendation.   \n9.  PDP should implement strategies for employee retention and a robust employee wellness \nprogram.   \nPDP is making efforts to recognize employees, however, a comprehensive employee \nwellness program has not been developed. \n10. The City should implement a return-to-work strategy that is tailored to the needs of PDP \nemployees who are out on long-term leave or work-related illness.   \nPDP reports the City has increased communication with employees on long-term leave.  \nThe City has separated 38 employees who had been on leave since April 2022 and could \nno longer perform necessary duties.  The Monitoring Team awaits additional details \nregarding the City’s efforts.   \n11. Retain an expert to build internal capacity to manage systems, coding, and budgetary processes \nassociated with staffing allocations.  The expert should assist PDP in identifying and retaining \nonly the most useful database reports and discontinuing the use of non-essential or inaccurate \nreports.   \nThis recommendation is currently being implemented.     \nSubstantive Provision 2—Out-of-Cell Time \n   \nSub-provision 2.1--Upon the entry of this Agreement, and no later than May 15, 2022, \nDefendants shall ensure that each incarcerated person at the Philadelphia Department of \nPrisons (PDP), with the exception of those who are housed in a designated segregation unit, \nshall be provided the following out-of-cell times for the following periods: (a) no later than  \nMay 15, 2022, no less than four hours of out-of-cell time each day; and (b) no later than  \nAugust 1, 2022, no less than five hours of out-of-cell time each day. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nThe Monitoring Team previously reported that out-of-cell data generated from Deputy Warden \nReports is unreliable and the Monitoring Team was therefore unable to establish an accurate \nbaseline of out-of-cell opportunities for Class Members.7  PDP reports that it is finalizing \nprocurement of a radio frequency identification (RFID) system, which will improve accuracy in \ntracking Class Member movement and out-of-cell time.  PDP reports that it will finalize \nprocurement and begin RFID implementation in the next reporting period.  In the meantime, \nPDP has replaced its Deputy Warden Report tracking system with a spreadsheet tracking system \nrecommended by the Monitoring Team.8  The spreadsheet tracker was implemented systemwide \nin April 2023 and tracks individual out-of-cell time in segregation units and group out-of-cell \ntime in non-segregation units. \n       \n \n7 Id. at 18; Monitor’s First Report, Remick v. City of Philadelphia, No. 2:20-cv-01959-BMS, Dkt. 181 at 11-12 \n(Nov. 4, 2022). \n8 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 19.  \n  18 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 20 of 69\nInitial results of the spreadsheet tracker suggest that additional staff training is necessary to \nimprove out-of-cell reporting accuracy.  For example, like the Deputy Warden Report tracking \nsystem, some personnel continue to document out-of-cell opportunities as being offered exactly \non the hour or half hour.  Jail operational needs, such as unlocking each cell door individually, \nmake such precise start times implausible.  The Monitoring Team has recommended that \npersonnel receive additional training in proper out-of-cell documentation, as well as the \nconsequences for falsification of records.  Despite persisting documentation and tracking issues, \nthe spreadsheet system is standardized across PDP housing units, which will allow PDP and the \nMonitoring Team to verify accuracy via CCTV for sample dates in the next reporting period.  \nPDP’s implementation of a simplified, consistent, and verifiable tracking system reflects a \ncommitment to increase and accurately track out-of-cell opportunities for Class Members.   \n \nData from initial tracking reports for general population units confirms that some units in each \nfacility are attempting to offer some out-of-cell time more than once per day.  It also confirms \nthat not all Class Members are offered out-of-cell time every day, let alone the requisite hours.  \nFinally, when out-of-cell time is offered, durations do not consistently meet minimum \nAgreement requirements.  This is, in part, because bed space and staffing limitations require \nmost general population units to house Class Members with various security classifications \ntogether in single housing units.  Class Members with different security classifications are not \npermitted to recreate together and are instead divided into smaller recreation groups.  The \nnumber and size of recreation groups in each unit changes based on bed space, staffing, and \npopulation dynamics.  Generally, the more groups that reside in the same housing unit, the fewer \nout-of-cell opportunities each group receives.  The following table depicts out-of-cell time \nreported for three one-week periods in April, May, and June 2023 based on total recreation \ngroups in each facility:   \n \nGeneral Population Average Out-of-Cell Time Per Day Reported for  \nThree One-W eek Periods* \n \n    April 2023  May 2023  June 2023 \n \nHours  Groups  %  Groups  %  Groups  % \nZero   34  27%  58  47%  4  3% \n1 to 4.9   68  55%  17  14%  116  94% \nCFCF \n5 or more  22  18%  49  40%  4  3% \nTotal CFCF Groups  124  100%  124  100%  124  100% \nZero   NA  NA  21  27%  2  3% \n1 to 4.9   NA  NA  21  27%  61  77% \nPICC \n5 or more   NA  NA  37  47%  16  20% \nTotal PICC Groups  NA**  NA  79  100%  79  100% \nZero   3  3%  5  5%  2  2% \n1 to 4.9   29  29%  34  34%  45  45% \nRCF \n5 or more   69  68%  62  61%  54  53% \nTotal RCF Groups  101  100%  101  100%  101  100% \n*The weeks were: 4/3-4/9, 5/1-5/7, and 6/5-6/11. \n**Tracking system not yet implemented at PICC. \n  19 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 21 of 69\n   \nInitial data suggests that RCF met the five-hour Agreement benchmark most consistently over \nthe three weeks reviewed.  Between 53 and 68 percent of all RCF groups reportedly received \nfive or more hours of out-of-cell time each day in the weeks reviewed.  CFCF and PICC varied \nfrom week to week, but data reflects that higher percentages of Class Member groups, up to 47 \npercent in one of the weeks documented, remained locked down for the week.  These lockdowns \nare reportedly due to inadequate security coverage and are worse on weekends and holidays.   \n \nDocumentation shows that some CFCF housing units often approach five hours of out-of-cell \ntime daily, and, at times, all three facilities provide out-of-cell time to some Class Members more \nthan once per day.  This represents improvement and efforts should continue. \n \nPDP has made notable progress since the Monitoring Team initiated its review in May 2022.  \nClass Members consistently report to the Monitoring Team that they receive more out-of-cell \ntime today than they have received since COVID-19 lockdown protocols were instituted \nnationwide more than three years ago.  Improvements that PDP is making, its receptivity to the \nMonitoring Team’s recommendations, and its acknowledgement of active failures are all \ncommendable.  It is also true that ongoing failures to offer all Class Members time outside of \ntheir cells every day constitutes one of the most harmful conditions detailed in this Action.  The \ninjury inflicted on Class Members as they endure hours, days, or weeks in isolation is \nimmeasurable and is compounded each day that non-compliance persists.  \n \nSub-provision 2.2--The parties agree that out-of-cell times under normal operations of the PDP \nhave ranged from 8-10 hours a day and increases in out-of-cell time should continue to be made \nbeyond the August 1, 2022, standard, with a presumptive expected increase to six hours by \nOctober 15, 2022.  The parties agree that this next step shall be based on the recommendations \nof the Court appointed Monitor, infra, para. 19, as to scope and timing. Accordingly, the \nMonitor shall provide recommendations to the Court, based on the Monitor’s analysis of all \nrelevant factors and proposals by the parties, on the next increase in out-of-cell time no later \nthan October 1, 2022, and thereafter on a quarterly basis. See also para. 4, infra. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance \nSubstantive Provision 3—Out-of-Cell/Segregation \n \nSub-provision 3.1--Defendants shall ensure that persons on segregation units shall be \nprovided: (a) no later than May 1, 2022, thirty minutes out-of-cell time on a daily basis and \n(b) no later than July 1, 2022, no less than one hour each day.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance  \n \nPDP’s initial efforts to improve out-of-cell tracking and increase out-of-cell opportunities for \nClass Members on segregation units warranted a rating of Partial Compliance in previous \nreporting periods.9  Because initial out-of-cell data reflects such low compliance, PDP’s \ncompliance rating in this reporting period is reduced to Non-compliance. \n \n9 Id. at 19; Monitor’s Frist Report, supra note 7, at 10.  \n  20 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 22 of 69\n \nPDP’s new spreadsheet tracking system was implemented in segregation units systemwide in \nJune 2023.  In this reporting period, the Monitoring Team reviewed tracking reports for the \nweek of June 5, 2023, which revealed that only 38 percent of Class Members on segregation \nunits received daily out-of-cell opportunities.

This is \nreportedly a result of increased vigilance by managers in monitoring out-of-cell time and \nensuring that sufficient personnel or supervisors are assigned or redirected to its segregation unit \nfor this purpose.  CFCF and PICC each have unique personnel and operational issues that will \nrequire a more focused approach by PDP leadership to address.   \n \n  21 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 23 of 69\nData reported above is consistent with feedback the Monitoring Team received from Class \nMembers and PDP personnel and executives throughout this reporting period.  As with out-of-\ncell reports for general population units, out-of-cell data for segregation units requires validation \nvia sample CCTV review.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team reiterates the following recommendations from the previous reporting \nperiod:  \n  \n1.  PDP leadership should reevaluate the current practice requiring the presence of three \ncorrectional officers on segregation units if a single Class Member is outside of a cell \nfor any reason.  Generally, two officers may be necessary to escort the most \nbehaviorally challenging Class Members.  PDP’s current policy and practice that \nmandates the presence of three or four correctional officers during any movement on a \nunit is outside of standard corrections segregation protocols.  As previously reported, \nthis requirement appears to be a primary barrier to compliance and should be \nreevaluated with support from PDP’s consulting team as it completes PDP’s \nforthcoming staffing analysis.10 \n2.  If a facility determines that it has insufficient personnel on post to offer a full hour out-\nof-cell, all Class Members should at least be provided time out-of-cell to shower, use \nthe phone, or access the law library.  CFCF reported using this approach during two \nshifts in the week reviewed, and while not sufficient, it was preferable to total isolation \non those days. \n3.  PDP leadership should ensure that out-of-cell schedules are feasible for personnel to \nimplement and that schedules are consistently adhered to.  Personnel and Class \nMembers in CFCF and PICC segregation units continue to report that they do not feel \nconfident that these units follow consistent recreation, shower, phone, and other out-of-\ncell protocols.      \n \nPDP leadership should continue to refine its new tracking system and utilize available \ninformation to focus on units during specific days and shifts that consistently struggle to provide \nout-of-cell opportunities.  The Monitoring Team is confident that PDP can significantly improve \nits out-of-cell compliance in segregation units in the next reporting period if it implements the \nMonitoring Team’s recommendations.   \n   \nSub-provision 3.2--Defendants further agree that they will continue their practice of not \nplacing incarcerated people in segregation units due to the lack of space or staffing on other \nunits. \n  \n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs previously reported, PDP’s segregation documentation does not identify a lack of housing \nspace or insufficient staffing as rationales for placement or retention of Class Members in \nadministrative segregation.11  However, PDP asserts that the staffing shortage contributed to \nlengthy delays in reviewing cases for retention of Class Members in administrative segregation.  \n \n10 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 20.  \n11 Id. at 21.   \n  22 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 24 of 69\nIn the first reporting period, reviews were not consistently occurring at 30-day intervals as \nrequired by PDP policy, and many were exceeding 60 and 90 days.12  These delays contributed \nto excessive lengths of stay in administrative segregation in violation of this sub-provision.13 \nPunitive segregation placements were also exceeding allowable timeframes in the first reporting \nperiod.14   \n \nIn the second reporting period, PDP made improvements in reducing the timeframes for \nadministrative segregation reviews, as well as lengths of stay in both administrative and punitive \nsegregation.15  Improvements in these areas continued in this reporting period.  Data for select \ndates suggests that PDP reduced its reliance on both punitive and administrative segregation, \nwith fewer administrative and punitive segregation placements and shorter lengths of stay in \nsegregation housing.   \n \nThe following tables depict total and average Class Members in administrative segregation, \nretention reviews exceeding 30, 60, and 90-day timeframes, and average lengths of stay in \nadministrative segregation for sample dates in two periods, July through December 2022, and \nJanuary through June 2023: \n \nReviews for Retention on Administrative Segregation  \nExceeding 60 and 90 Days and Average Lengths of Stay  \nJuly 2022 – December 2022 \n    \nCFCF  PICC  RCF*  Total \n  \nAverage  Average  Average  Average \nTotal  > 60   > 90  % > 60  Total  > 60  > 90  % > 60  Total \nDays in  Days in  Days in  Total  Days in \nAd-Seg  Days  Days  Days  Ad-Seg  Days  Days  Days  Ad-Seg \nAd-Seg  Ad-Seg  Ad-Seg  Ad-Seg \n7-1-22  60  20  27  78%  133  76  6  2  11%  78  17  71  153  94 \n8-5-22  80  0  8  10%  127  60  1  5  10%  88  19  89  159  101 \n9-2-22  99  12  4  16%  102  73  1  4  7%  66  23  55  195  74 \n10-7-22  89  16  7  26%  93  102  1  2  3%  49  18  75  209  72 \n11-4-22  115  8  16  21%  89  89  1  1  2%  52  20  58  224  66 \n12-2-22  124  1  8  7%  99  67  0  0  0%  53  28  50  219  67 \nAverage  95  10  12  26%  107  78  2  2  6%    64    21    66    193    79 \n*RCF reviews were all completed within policy according to documentation reviewed.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 14.  \n13 RCF has consistently demonstrated compliance with timely reviews of administrative segregation placements. \n14 Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 14. \n15 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 21-23.  \n  23 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 25 of 69\nReviews for Retention on Administrative Segregation  \nExceeding 30 and 60 Days and Average Lengths of Stay \nJanuary – June 2023 \n \n   \nCFCF  PICC  RCF*  Total \n \nAverage  Average  Average  Average \nTotal  > 30  > 60  % > 60  Total  > 30  > 60  % > 60  Total \nDays in  Days in  Days in  Total  Days in \nAd-Seg  Days  Days  Days  Ad-Seg  Days  Days  Days  Ad-Seg \nAd-Seg  Ad-Seg  Ad-Seg  Ad-Seg \n1-13-23  109  32  11  10%  115  69  7  0  0  45  22  53  200  71 \n2-3-23  83  8  1  1%  68  65  3  0  0  49  16  89  164  69 \n3-3-23  60  14  0  0%  74  49  0  0  0  28  15  92  124  65 \n4-14-22  70  2  4  6%  64  22  0  0  0  26  12  104  104  65 \n5-5-23  33  0  0  0  61  25  0  0  0  29  14  105  72  65 \n6-3-23  47  2  0  0  46  36  0  0  0  38  6  204  89  96 \nAverage  67  10  3  3%  71  44  2  0  0%  36  14  108  126  72 \nDifference, \nQs 3 & 4 \n2022 and   -29%  N/A  -70%  -88%  -34%  -44%  NA  -100%  -100%  -44%  -33%  +64%  -35%  -9% \nQs 1 & 2 \n2023 \n*RCF reviews were all completed within policy according to documentation reviewed.  \n \nCFCF data for select dates shows that the percentage of reviews for retention on administrative \nsegregation that exceeded 60 days reduced from an average of 10 cases in the period July \nthrough December 2022 to an average of 3 cases in the first 6 months of 2023.  May and June \n2023 data shows that CFCF had zero retention reviews that exceeded 60 days.  The same data for \nPICC shows that zero administrative segregation retention reviews exceeded 60 days in the first \nsix months of 2023.  This marks notable improvement at both facilities.  RCF continued to meet \npolicy timeframes for days reviewed in this reporting period. \n     \nData for select dates also shows that the average lengths of stay in administrative segregation \ndecreased by 36 days on average, or 34 percent, at CFCF and by 28 days on average, or 44 \npercent, at PICC for select dates in 2022 and 2023.  RCF data shows a large increase in average \nlengths of stay from 66 to 108 days on average since the previous reporting period.  This increase \nis driven by the long-term retention of a single Class Member based on an alleged in-custody \nhomicide.  The Monitoring Team is working with PDP to identify possible alternatives to \nsegregation for this Class Member.   \n \nBased on data reviewed, PDP is making excellent progress in reducing lengths of stay in \nadministrative segregation, including effectively addressing long-term placements.   \n \nAs recommended in previous reports, PDP discontinued the automatic placement of state \nsentenced Class Members into administrative segregation based solely on their state commitment \nstatus.16  On June 3, 2022, administrative segregation reports listed 36 state sentenced Class \n \n16 Id. at 23. \n  24 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 26 of 69\nMembers in administrative segregation.  A year later, on June 2, 2023, there were zero Class \nMembers in administrative segregation pending state placement.17   \n \nOn July 3, 2022, there were 44 Class Members in administrative segregation longer than 90 days.  \nEleven months later, on June 2, 2023, five Class Members remained in administrative \nsegregation beyond 90 days, representing an 89 percent reduction in long-term administrative \nsegregation placements.  By the end of June 2023, three of those five Class Members remained \nin segregation.  Two of the five are deemed long-term segregation placements, one for the \nalleged in-cell homicide mentioned above and the other for an alleged in-custody sexual assault.  \nThe third was referred for placement in the new Transition Unit for SMI and was subsequently \nremoved from administrative segregation.   \n \nIssues remain with the overrepresentation of Class Members on the Behavioral Health caseload \nin segregation, as discussed below under Substantive Provision 6—Behavioral Health in \nSegregation.  The Monitoring Team also continues to recommend further modifications to the \npolicy for placements of Class Members in segregation based solely on high bail and other static \nfactors. \n \nThe following tables depicts total numbers of Class Members and average lengths of stay in \npunitive segregation for sample dates, July through December 2022, and January through June \n2023:         \n \nPunitive Segregation: Total Placements and Average Lengths of Stay  \nJuly – December 2022 \n   \nCFCF  PICC  RCF  Total \n \nTotal  Average Days  Total  Average Days  Total  Average Days  Total in  Average Days \nPunitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive \nSegregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation \n \n7-1-22  100  89  24  110  27  34  151  78 \n8-5-22  65  98  34  89  36  44  135  77 \n9-2-22  58  87  56  71  65  34  179  64 \n10-7-22  56  37  50  53  64  32  170  41 \n11-4-22  52  38  71  39  39  59  162  45 \n12-2-22  33  30  59  27  36  18  128  25 \nAverage  61  63  49  65  45  37  154  55 \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 PDP continues to periodically segregate a small number of state sentenced Class Members for short periods while \nthey await movement to their designated housing unit.     \n  25 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 27 of 69\nPunitive Segregation: Total Placements and Average Lengths of Stay \nJanuary – June 2023 \n  \nCFCF  PICC  RCF  Total \n \nTotal  Average Days  Total  Average Days  Total  Average Days  Total in  Average Days \nPunitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive  Punitive  in Punitive \nSegregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation  Segregation \n \n1-13-23  32  27  38  31  29  18  99  25 \n2-3-23  55  16  43  9  34  21  132  15 \n3-3-23  69  16  56  20  24  11  149  16 \n4-14-23  72  25  52  28  16  15  140  23 \n5-5-23  64  23  56  25  19  9  139  19 \n6-3-23  90  19  54  24  31  10  175  18 \nAverage  64  21  50  23  26  14  139  19 \nDifference, Qs \n3 & 4 2022 and   +5%  -67%  +2%  -65%  -42%  -62%  -10%  -65% \nQs 1 & 2 2023 \n \nData for select dates suggests that average lengths of stay in punitive segregation in the three \nfacilities was reduced by approximately 65 percent from the previous reporting period with each \nfacility showing similar progress.  PDP has retrained hearing officers who preside over \ndisciplinary hearings in all three facilities, which has improved consistency.  This change has \nincreased consistency and contributed to successful reductions in this reporting period.   \n \nRCF also reduced the average number of Class Members placed in punitive segregation from 45 \nfor select dates in the second half of 2022 to 26 in the first half of 2023.  In this reporting period, \nPDP is segregating approximately seven percent of its population, down from 10 percent in the \nlast reporting period.18  With sustained efforts to reduce the punitive segregation of behavioral \nhealth patients, as well as those with non-violent institutional misconduct, PDP should be able to \nreduce its segregated Class Member population to at least the national average of no more than \nsix percent of its total population.   \nSubstantive Provision 4—Resume Normal Operations \n \nBy November 1, 2022, based on discussions between the parties and the Court-appointed \nMonitor, the parties and the Monitor shall submit to the Court a plan for a return to normal \noperations of the PDP (regarding out-of-cell time, programming, visits, and other services).  \nDuring the period that precedes a return to normal operations, if the Monitor determines that the \nDefendants are not providing the agreed-upon out-of-cell time, Defendants must provide specific \nreasons for non-compliance to the Plaintiffs and the Monitor.  The parties and the Monitor shall \nthen engage in discussions to resolve the issues in dispute.  If no agreement is reached, \nDefendants may move for the amendment or modification of these provisions, but only upon \ngood cause shown, and the Plaintiffs may move for appropriate intervention by the Court, \nincluding possible contempt of court sanctions. \n \n18 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 22.  \n  26 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 28 of 69\n \nCompliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n \nPDP continues to report that it is not prepared to submit a plan for a return to normal operations \nthat includes all required out-of-cell time and access to other services and programs as required \nby the Agreement.19  PDP reports that while it is able to make some operational improvements \nwith existing staffing resources, it cannot provide a date by which it will be able to return to \nnormal operations.  As previously reported, short staffing is the primary reason articulated by \nPDP for its failure to comply with several Agreement provisions, including those related to out-\nof-cell time.20   \n \nIn this reporting period, the Monitor requested that the Parties begin to meet regularly to discuss \nareas of non-compliance with the Agreement.  Goals of the meetings include: (1) increased \ntransparency regarding PDP’s systemic deficiencies and the disclosure of specific reasons for \ncompliance failures, and (2) identification of any available solutions, including potential \nintervention by the Court.  The first meeting of the Parties was held on June 23, 2023, during \nwhich the Parties discussed several pressing issues, including out-of-cell time and RFID \nprocurement, staffing and security, use of force, administrative segregation and discipline, and \nfacility maintenance.  The confidential discussions were transparent and collaborative, and the \nParties strategized potential solutions.  The Parties have scheduled a follow-up discussion from \nthe initial meeting that will occur in October 2023, and the second meeting of the Parties is \nscheduled for November 6, 2023.  Areas of specific progress related to meeting agenda items are \naddressed in discussions of each substantive provision throughout this report.    \n \nAs part of PDP’s eventual plan to return to normal operations, additional personnel vacancies in \nPDP’s Restorative and Transitional Services (RTS) Division must also be filled.  RTS consists of \nclinicians and other professionals whose services are among the most important to Class \nMembers.  Commencing within the first five days of confinement, RTS personnel initiate case \nmanagement protocols, including Class Member orientation, individual assessments, and \ndischarge planning.  Among other services, they offer new intake orientations and facilitate town \nhall meetings, refer for services inside PDP and in the community, provide short-term and \ninformational counseling, and liaise with Class Members’ family and friends.  The Monitoring \nTeam has received feedback from RTS personnel and Class Members that some important \nservices are not being offered consistent with PDP policy.  Lapses are reportedly due to \ninsufficient RTS personnel.  RTS vacancies as of June 2023 are depicted in the table below:    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 The Monitoring Team is working with PDP to ensure that “normal operations” is defined according to evidence-\nbased best practices at the time PDP is prepared to implement them.   \n20 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 24; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 15-16. \n  27 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 29 of 69\nRestorative and Transitional Services Division Staffing \nJune 2023 \n  \nAllocated  Filled  Unfilled  Vacancy \nPosition Category \nPositions  Positions  Positions  Rate \nInstructor  5  4  1  20% \nVolunteer Services Director  1  1  0  0% \nPsychologist  4  2  2  50% \nPrison Psychologist Supervisor  0  1  -1  0% \nSocial Work Services Manager I  0  1  -1  0% \nSocial Work Services Manager II  53  42  11  21% \nSocial Work Supervisor  13  12  1  8% \nHuman Services Program Administrator  2  2  0  0% \nSocial Services/Housing Program Analyst  0  1  -1  0% \nPrison Closed Circuit TV Specialist  1  1  0  0% \nInmate Computer-Based Education \n7  6  1  14% \nInstructor \nInmate Computer-Based Education \n1  1  0  0% \nSupervisor \nCorrectional Industries Assistant Director  1  1  0  0% \nCorrectional Industries Director  1  0  1  100% \nIndustries Shop Supervisor  14  16  -2  0% \nEducation Director  1  0  1  100% \nTotal  104  91  18  17% \n \nSeventeen percent total vacancies is problematic, and hiring and retention efforts should \ncontinue.  RTS services improve the daily lives of Class Members and support security, \nbehavioral health, and all PDP operations.  Without them, the harm experienced by Class \nMembers in PDP’s current conditions is exacerbated.  Given the current population of more than \n4,700 Class Members, RTS caseloads may be unmanageable, even with a full complement of \nRTS staff.  The Monitoring Team has recommended that PDP review RTS job descriptions and \nduties to ensure it has allocated sufficient positions to perform all tasks consistent with policy.    \nSubstantive Provision 5—Healthcare \n \nThe Defendants shall provide adequate and timely medical and mental health treatment to all \nincarcerated persons.  The Defendants agree to institute the programs and measures (referred to \nas “the Backlog Plan”) set forth by Bruce Herdman, PDP Chief of Medical Operations, at his \ndeposition of March 21, 2022, to address the existing backlog.  The “Backlog Plan” is a new, \nthree-month effort to see backlogged patients as soon as possible.  The City has allocated \nsubstantial funding to allow Corizon Health services to engage additional agency staff to \naugment its full-time staff to further reduce backlogs.  Four agencies are contracted to provide \n  28 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 30 of 69\nstaff towards this end.  Agencies will provide additional providers, including MD/DOs, NPs, \nLCSWs, and RNs for this effort.  Based on these programs and measures, the Defendants agree \nto substantially eliminate the existing backlog by August 1, 2022, and thereafter to continue \naddressing any remaining backlog consistent with these programs and measures.  Substantial \nelimination shall mean reduction to a backlog of no more than ten to fifteen percent of the \ncurrent backlog. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nThe reduction of both on-site care and off-site specialty care backlogs remains a primary focus \nfor PDP Healthcare, and security and healthcare staff shortages remain the greatest barriers to \ncompliance.  PDP has successfully reduced its on-site care appointment backlog in the last two \nreporting periods.  The off-site specialty appointment backlog, however, has not significantly \ndecreased since the previous reporting period.  PDP’s overall appointment backlog remains far \nhigher than the 238-appointment backlog required for Agreement compliance.   \n \nPDP Healthcare and security executives and staff continue to report that weekly Access to Care \nCommittee meetings are ongoing and beneficial.21  They report, for example, that all operational \nsolutions implemented in this reporting period were identified during workgroup meetings.  \nPDP’s progress in creating and sustaining this collaborative workgroup is commendable, and \nimprovements are certain to continue despite little relief from existing staffing and operational \nbarriers.   \n \nThe table below compares on-site appointment backlogs for two four-week periods in \nNovember/December 2022 and May/June 2023: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n21 Meetings were initiated in November 2022.

Combined with reductions in the previous reporting period of nearly 400 \nappointments, PDP’s backlog has been reduced by more than 1,100 appointments.22  Backlogs in \nsome areas have been eliminated.  With the addition of new personnel and focused attention, \nPDP’s re-entry planning appointments were reduced by 98 percent, from 719 to a remaining \nbacklog of only 14 appointments.  This marks commendable progress and efforts should \ncontinue.  It is noteworthy that the backlog for some types of services has increased and that, \nexcluding re-entry planning successes, the overall on-site backlog is largely unchanged from the \nprevious reporting period.  However, the improvements from the last reporting period were not \ndriven solely by a reduction in the re-entry backlog and the data shows an overall improvement \nsince October 2022. \n \nOn-site specialty appointments continue to represent a small percentage of the overall backlog \nand totals are sensitive to small staffing fluctuations such as single provider absences.23  For \ninstance, in this reporting period, PDP’s pap test and gynecology backlog tripled to 189 \nappointments with the loss of one provider.  PDP reports that it is continuing to seek additional \nproviders for these services to maintain consistent care.  Efforts continue to address the off-site \n \n22 See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 25-26.  \n23 PDP offers on-site specialty services in optometry, pap testing, podiatry, physical therapy, ultrasound, and x-ray. \nFor on-site specialty appointments, community provider/specialists come to PDP and treat patients on-site.  PT staff \nand x-ray techs are YCC employees. \n  30 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 32 of 69\nspecialty appointments backlog, but progress is limited.  PDP’s off-site specialty appointment \nbacklog remains largely unchanged in this reporting period despite the completion of \napproximately 200 monthly appointments.  In December 2022, PDP’s off-site backlog was 172 \nscheduled off-site appointments and 50 appointments awaiting scheduling.  On June 19, 2023, \nthe backlog was 187 scheduled appointments and 43 pending scheduling. \n \nOff-site specialty appointments require more coordination between security and healthcare \npersonnel, and more security personnel for patient guarding and transports.  As previously \nreported, PDP has been seeking providers who are willing to provide specialty care on-site rather \nthan in ideal, but less efficient, community settings.24  PDP found a cardiologist to treat patients \non-site commencing July 2023, but has not had success securing other specialty providers.  PDP \nalso hoped to distribute off-site appointments more evenly across weekdays to reduce \ntransportation burdens, but limitations with off-site provider offices have prevented \nimplementation.  Off-site providers are reportedly also unwilling to offer evening appointments, \nwhich PDP hoped would help reduce the backlog.

Patients have consistently reported to the Monitoring Team that excessive \nwait times in holding cells for transportation to appointments is a primary reason for their \n \n24 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 26. \n  31 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 33 of 69\nrefusals.25  PDP reports that it has made some operational changes that have improved patient \nwait times, which is positive.  Even with operational changes and improved wait times, without \nsufficient security personnel to transport patients, there remains a high number of same-day \nappointment cancellations.  As a result, some providers are discontinuing relationships with PDP \npatients due to excessive last-minute cancellations.   \n \nPDP reports that it is renewing focus on security scheduling for medical transports in hopes of \nfurther reducing the backlog to levels that will allow healthcare to achieve and maintain \ncompliance while managing ongoing referrals.  Despite these barriers, PDP has improved from \naverages of 56 percent to 65 percent of patients attending their appointments.  The average 65 \npercent success rate has remained consistent since the previous reporting period and may mark a \nnew threshold for appointment attendance.26   \n \nPDP continues to struggle to meet policy guidelines for completing patient intake screenings \nwithin four hours of arrival at PDP.  The following table depicts PDP’s reported compliance with \nfour-hour timeframes for each month in the first half of 2023:     \n \nPercentage of Intake Screenings \nWithin Four Hours   \nMonthly Averages 2023 \n  \nJanuary  30% \nFebruary  48% \nMarch  37% \nApril  40% \nMay  31% \nJune  24% \n \nPDP reports that it typically has adequate healthcare staffing to meet the four-hour requirement \nbut that security staff availability to deliver patients for screenings remains challenging.  The \nMonitoring Team has recommended that the Access to Care Committee retain this issue on its \nagenda for further consideration. \n \nIn this reporting period, PDP initiated the recommended critical incident review process \nfollowing Class Member deaths.  Six Class Member patients died while in PDP custody in the \nfirst six months of 2023.  Manners of death for two patients include one suicide and one \nhomicide.  PDP is awaiting final medical examiner reports for the four remaining patients.  The \nMonitoring Team has observed each review, which are consistently presided over by the \nCommissioner and attended by PDP’s entire healthcare and security executive management \nteams, the security and healthcare teams, and assisting and witness personnel.  The reviews are \nheld in the days immediately following a Class Member death, so information discussed is \npreliminary.  All known facts and circumstances related to each death are discussed, including \nmovement and operational timelines leading up to, during, and after each death.

Reviews \nthus far have been transparent, and discussions have been thorough and self-critical.  Every \nreview has yielded identification of necessary corrective action, for which the Commissioner \nissued corresponding directives or requested additional information and follow-up.  As with the \nAccess to Care Committee, the death review process is among the more significant, systemically \nimpactful changes PDP has achieved thus far.  The Monitoring Team will continue to work with \nPDP to refine its corrective action planning and implementation and improve its finalized death \ninvestigations.   \n \nBehavioral Healthcare \n \nPDP has continued to collect data regarding the frequency and timeliness of healthcare delivery. \nPDP’s Performance Indicator Report reflects continued challenges in completing behavioral \nhealth referrals within required timeframes.27  The behavioral health appointments backlog \ncomprises 14 percent of the entire on-site appointment backlog and has not changed significantly \nsince the last reporting period.  However, patients are not receiving care within policy timelines.  \nDelays are reportedly due to healthcare and custody staffing deficiencies, and they continue \ndespite efforts to improve service delivery in this reporting period (such as delivering services \ndirectly on housing units rather than the national best practice of delivering patients to a central \nclinic with space for confidential communication).  The following tables depict PDP’s \ncompliance with policy timeframes for behavioral health referrals, social worker sick calls, and \n14-day patient evaluations for the first six months of 2023:     \n \nPercent Compliance with Behavioral Health Referral Timeframes \nJanuary – June 2023 \n  \n% All  %  % \n% Urgent  % Routine \nReferrals  Emergency  Emergency \nTotal  Referrals  Referrals \nCompleted  Referrals  Referrals \nMonth  Completed  Completed  Completed \nWithin  Completed  Completed \nReferrals  Within 24  Within 5 \nPolicy  Within 4  Within 24 \nHours  Days \nTimeframes  Hours  Hours \nJanuary  621  54%  76%  Unavailable  21%  38% \nFebruary  611  63%  81%  Unavailable  22%  59% \nMarch  757  59%  84%  100%  17%  43% \nApril  658  65%  88%  100%  22%  52% \nMay  766  64%  86%  100%  25%  38% \nJune  650  61%  87%  100%  18%  34% \n*Expectation: emergent within 4 hours, urgent within 24 hours, routine within 5 days. \n \n \n \n27 PDP behavioral healthcare policy prescribes the following timeframes for responding to behavioral health patient \nreferrals: emergency referrals, within four hours; urgent referrals, within 24-hours; and routine referrals, within five \ndays. \n  33 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 35 of 69\nSocial Worker Sick Calls 2023 \n January 2023 – June 2023 \n  \nMonth  Number Completed  % Completed within 14 Days \nJanuary  413  70% \nFebruary  454  67% \nMarch  393  69% \nApril  355  70% \nMay  363  69% \nJune  380  69% \n \nCompliance with 14-Day Evaluations \n January 2023 – June 2023 \n  \nMonth  Number Completed  % Completed within 14 Days \nJanuary  654  97% \nFebruary  667  98% \nMarch  685  99% \nApril  774  99% \nMay  795  95% \nJune  780  96% \n \nBehavioral health referrals were completed within required timeframes less than 70 percent of \nthe time.  PDP has made improvements in recent months but still has difficulty responding to \nemergency referrals within the required four-hour time frame.  Behavioral Health was always \nable to complete emergency referrals within 24 hours.  This was likely at the expense of urgent \nreferrals, which were completed within required 24-hour timeframes less than 25 percent of the \ntime, and routine referrals, which were completed within six-day timeframes less than 50 percent \nof the time.  \n \nPolicy requires that social worker sick calls, or Class Member initiated requests, are responded to \nby a Behavioral Health clinician face-to-face within 24-hours of receipt.  PDP data shows that \ntimeframes were met between 67 to 70 percent of the time from January through June 2023.  \nThis reflects a decrease from 75 to 86 percent compliance since the previous reporting period.28  \n \nFinally, all Class Members entering PDP are referred for a 14-day evaluation to be completed by \nBehavioral Health staff.  As previously reported, PDP achieved increased compliance in the last \nthree months of 2022, meeting policy guidelines more than 90 percent of the time.29  Progress \nhas continued and PDP is close to 100 percent compliance in this reporting period.   \n \n \n \n \n28 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 30. \n29 Id. at 30-31.  \n  34 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 36 of 69\nHealthcare Staffing \n \nCorrectional healthcare staff vacancy rates are analyzed based on the number of vacant and filled \npositions, or a “staff vacancy” rate and a “functional vacancy” rate, which accounts for shifts \nfilled by overtime or temporary agency staff.  In the first reporting period, PDP reported a staff \nvacancy rate of 33 percent and a functional vacancy rate of 14 percent.30  In this reporting period, \nPDP reports a similar staff vacancy rate but a lower functional vacancy rate of six percent.   \nFunctional vacancy rates tend to fluctuate depending on need and availability of overtime and \nregistry staff.  Hiring and retaining permanent staff is the best way to ensure consistently high \nstaffing levels and control for fluctuations in functional staffing.  Behavioral health \nclassifications continue to show a high functional vacancy rate of 40 percent for clinicians and \n37 percent for prescribers.  At these rates, PDP cannot meet requirements for the provision of \ntimely and adequate behavioral healthcare. \n \nDespite persisting vacancies, data in this reporting period suggests improvements in hiring and \nretention, which saw little progress in previous reporting periods.31  In the first six months of \n2023, PDP was able to fill 26.35 positions.  In the same period, PDP lost 14.95 full time \npositions/employees.

PDP made adjustments \nto some positions, and following negotiations with the correctional healthcare labor unions, has \nincreased compensation for many positions up to 13 percent.  Increases were made effective  \nJuly 28, 2023, with a retroactive date of April 1, 2023.  This is positive news and PDP is now \nbetter positioned to attract more candidates in the competitive market.     \n \nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 5—Healthcare, from the Monitor’s First \nReport: \n \n  36 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 38 of 69\n1.  Defendants should engage an independent salary survey to assist PDP in identifying salaries \nand benefits that are sufficiently competitive to attract and retain full-time healthcare staff. \nIn the previous reporting period, PDP reported that it was planning to offer up to eight \npercent salary increases for many healthcare positions.32  Following additional review, \nPDP elected to offer a more significant 13 percent increase, as described above.  PDP’s \nimplementation of this recommendation reflects significant progress.   \n2.  Continue to explore options to provide both on and off-site appointment services via \ntelehealth.  \nPDP reports that YesCare has engaged a cardiology group that is willing to provide \ntelehealth services, which began in July 2023, but has been otherwise unsuccessful in \nthese efforts.   \n3.  Create an internal interdisciplinary workgroup to evaluate reasons for missed off-site \nappointments and develop procedures to increase efficiency in arranging and ensuring that \nscheduled appointments occur. \nThe Access to Care Committee was formed in November 2022 to address on-site and off-\nsite appointment issues.  As discussed above, the workgroup has been successful in \nidentifying and correcting deficiencies and continues to meet weekly.   \nSubstantive Provision 6—Behavioral Health in Segregation \n \nBy September 30, 2022, the PDP and Corizon shall re-establish a mental health program for \npersons who are in segregation status.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nIn order to achieve substantial compliance with this substantive provision, PDP must, at a \nminimum:  (1) resume the provision of daily medical/physical health rounds for each Class \nMember patient placed on punitive or administrative segregation status; (2) ensure that \nbehavioral health clearances are completed consistent with PDP policy for each Class Member \npatient placed on administrative or punitive segregation status; (3) resume the provision of \nweekly behavioral health rounds for each Class Member patient on segregation status who is \nnavigating serious mental illness (SMI); (4) resume the provision of group services for no fewer \nthan 10 hours per week for each Class Member patient on segregation status; (5) establish a \nreliable mechanism to identify all Class Member patients on segregation status who are not \nhoused in identified segregation units; (6) safely discontinue the use of segregation for Class \nMember patients due to lack of sufficient Transition Unit housing; and (7) significantly reduce \nthe use of segregation for Class Member patients who require placement on the behavioral health \ncaseload.     \n \nRequirements 1 and 3:  Resume the provision of daily medical/physical health rounds for each \nClass Member patient placed on punitive or administrative segregation status and resume the \nprovision of weekly behavioral health rounds for each Class Member patient on segregation \nstatus who is navigating SMI. \n  \n \n32 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 33. \n  37 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 39 of 69\nAs discussed in prior reports, daily physical healthcare rounds and weekly behavioral healthcare \nrounds are essential to patients in segregated settings.33  Rounds allow healthcare staff to assess \npatients and monitor for signs of physical or mental health distress or decline.  Rounds also offer \npatients opportunities to express their healthcare needs with consistency, and providers may seek \nthe removal of at-risk patients from segregation housing.  \n   \nRecent audit results reflect a significant reduction and low compliance with required physical \nhealthcare rounding.  A previous PDP Healthcare audit from September 2022 revealed that \nrequired medical rounds were occurring 84 percent of the time.34  The March 2023 audit reflects \nthat only 22 percent of required rounds were occurring, and in two of three facilities, did not \noccur at all on some days.  PDP Healthcare reports it is increasing training and monitoring of \nhealthcare rounding in hopes of improving compliance.   \n \nPDP has shown improvement, however, in weekly behavioral health rounds from 75 percent \ncompliance in September 2022 to 96 percent compliance in March 2023.  This is a notable \naccomplishment given the behavioral health vacancies discussed above under Substantive \nProvision 5—Healthcare.  \n \nPDP does not currently track when clinicians initiate the removal of patients from segregation \nhousing due to physical or mental health deterioration while in isolation.  The Monitoring Team \nhas received reports from individual healthcare providers that patients are periodically removed \nor that additional services are requested.  The Monitoring Team has recommended that PDP \nHealthcare track these occurrences and is working with PDP to develop a system.   \n \nRequirement 2:  Ensure that behavioral health clearances are completed consistent with PDP \npolicy for each Class Member patient placed on segregation status. \n \nHealthcare clearances are required for all Class Members being considered for placement on \nsegregation status.  This requires a face-to-face evaluation by a physical healthcare provider, and \nfor those on the Behavioral Health caseload, a Behavioral Health clinician.  Patients designated \nSMI require behavioral health clearances within four hours of placement.  Patients who are on \nthe Behavioral Health caseload but not designated SMI require behavioral health clearances \nwithin 24 hours of placement in segregation.   \n \nThe subject matter experts reviewed a sample of physical and behavioral healthcare clearance \ndocumentation, which suggests that physical health clearances are continuing to be documented \nconsistently prior to patients’ placements in segregated housing.  Dr. Belavich has determined \nthat physical health clearances are completed using a sound practice, which sees each patient \ndelivered to a medical clinic for physical health evaluations prior to transport to segregation \nunits. \n \nAs discussed in more detail under Substantive Provision 8—Discipline below, behavioral health \nclearances are not being documented consistently.  This is due in part to discrepancies in security \nand healthcare documentation.  Other issues may include failures to identify patients as SMI or \n \n33 Id. at 34; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 22.  \n34 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 34.   \n  38 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 40 of 69\non the Behavioral Health caseload, or failures to notify behavioral health staff of patients \npending segregation placement.  The Monitoring Team has also observed that some Behavioral \nHealth clinicians are documenting clearances in the electronic medical record, which security \npersonnel do not have access to, but not on PDP’s required disciplinary forms.  Disciplinary \nforms are shared with and used by security hearing officers to make segregation determinations \nand must be completed for each patient.  PDP is revising its process for completing and \ndocumenting behavioral health clearances and improvements will be addressed in future reports.   \n \nRequirement 4:  Resume the provision of group services for no fewer than 10 hours per week for \neach Class Member patient on segregation status. \n \nPDP reported previously that it had developed “Positive Change/Positive Outcomes” (PC/PO), a \nbehavioral health group treatment program for patients in isolation.  The program is designed \nand staffed with 13 providers for robust delivery five days per week for two hours, or a total of \n52 groups per day or 10 possible treatment hours for each segregated patient every week.  \nHowever, documentation in this reporting period reflects that only 19 percent of total groups are \nbeing offered, largely due to security staffing shortages.  In this reporting period, PDP developed \na system to track which patients are eligible for the PC/PO program, which patients are offered \nparticipation but refuse, and how much time patients in the PC/PO program spend doing \nprogram-related treatment.  PDP began tracking the information in early 2023 and are \ndeveloping a better understanding of specific program needs and patient participation.   \n \nDr. Belavich indicates that without treatment programming, Class Member patients in \nsegregation are more likely to psychiatrically decompensate or commit additional infractions in \nresponse to their isolated conditions.  He opines that patients with SMI or mental health \ndiagnoses accompanied by acute symptoms should not be exposed to isolation.  If no alternatives \nexist and these patients require placement in segregation, then they must receive close \nobservation, frequent clinical contacts, and increased therapeutic programming.   \n \nRequirement 5:  Establish a reliable mechanism to identify all Class Member patients on \nsegregation status who are not housed in identified segregation units. \n \nAs previously reported, PDP’s tracking of behavioral health and SMI patients on segregation \nstatus was unreliable.35  PDP was unable to reconcile security and healthcare documentation and \nprove that Class Members were not “segregating in place” or serving a segregation sentence in \nnon-segregation housing.  Segregating in place prevents healthcare staff from completing proper \nrounding and providing necessary care for vulnerable behavioral health patients.  PDP reports \nthat it has corrected tracking discrepancies and issued a directive that prohibits segregating in \nplace.  PDP Healthcare reports that audits are now being conducted to verify reconciled \ndocumentation and ensure (1) patients on segregation status are all housed in segregation \nhousing units; and (2) clinical personnel are able to round on all segregated patients.  Results will \nbe discussed in the next reporting period.   \n \n \n \n35 Ibid.  \n  39 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 41 of 69\nRequirement 6:  Safely discontinue the use of segregation for Class Member patients due to lack \nof sufficient Transition Unit housing.  \n \nDr. Belavich maintains that PDP should reduce its dependence on segregation for all Class \nMembers and discontinue its use altogether for SMI patients unless no alternatives exist.  Many \ncorrectional systems are now implementing Therapeutic Housing Units as alternative settings for \nthe mentally ill.  As previously reported, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, PDP had three \ntherapeutic housing or “Transition Units” (TU), which by August 2022 had reduced from 64 to \n11 cells for women and from 100 to 56 cells for men.36  The re-establishment of TUs and the \ncreation of a new TU for patients engaging in self-harm, or other dangerous behaviors in lieu of \nplacement in segregation, are crucial for this population.   \n \nPDP has agreed to implement the Monitoring Team’s recommendations for TU expansion. \nDuring the Monitoring Team’s October 2022 tour, one unit at PICC housed 66 male TU Class \nMembers and some general population Class Members as well.  In February 2023, PDP \nexpanded housing for male Class Members by transferring its TU to a unit at RCF with a 128-\npatient capacity.  The entire 128-bed unit is reserved for patients on the Behavioral Health \ncaseload, which allows for more programming and recreation time for the population.  \nUnfortunately, in June 2023, the RCF TU housed only 49 patients.  PDP must immediately \nreevaluate its TU placement criteria, increase the current TU population, and dedicate some of its \ncurrent bed space to behavioral health patients who should be diverted from segregation.   \n \nThe female TU remains at PICC and TU patients must share the unit with Class Members of \nvarious security classifications, including general population and pregnant Class Members.  PDP \nhas reserved 17 of 64 two-person cells for TU patients for a total occupancy of 34 Class \nMembers.  The inability to mix Class Members of different security classifications results in TU \npatients receiving limited out-of-cell programming.  PDP acknowledges that current \nprogramming for women generally, and TU patients specifically, remains unacceptable.  Among \nother recommendations for improved conditions for women, the Monitoring Team has \nrecommended that PDP reevaluate the structure of the female TU, reserve additional beds for TU \npatients, and then utilize pre-COVID-19 thresholds to identify more TU patients to fill them.   \n \nPDP Healthcare is developing a procedure to allow SMI Class Members to remain in TUs \nthroughout their disciplinary terms and the imposition of any accompanying sanctions rather than \nbe transferred to segregation housing.  This alternative to traditional punitive segregation would \nallow patients to reside in familiar settings and maintain continuity of clinical contacts and TU \nservices and programs.  If patients’ behavior becomes severely disruptive to TU programming, \npatients will be moved to segregation housing but will still receive at least 10 hours per week of \ngroup programming through the PC/PO program.  Patients will also receive appropriate \ntreatment planning to address identified behaviors with the goal of reintegrating patients to either \na TU or general population setting.    \n \nOnce implemented, these changes should reduce the presence of SMI and Behavioral Health \ncaseload Class Members in segregation.  For PDP to meet this requirement, it will need to \n \n36 Id. at 36; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 23. \n  40 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 42 of 69\nreserve sufficient bedspace to accommodate all Class Member patients who are eligible for the \nTU program and maintain sufficient security and healthcare personnel to operate the units.   \n \nRequirement 7:  Significantly reduce the use of segregation for Class Member patients who \nrequire placement on the behavioral health caseload. \n \nOn December 30, 2022, PDP’s total census was 4,401 Class Members.  Thirty-five percent of \nClass Members were on the Behavioral Health caseload and 12 percent were designated SMI.37  \nThere were a total of 311 Class Members on segregation status.38  Of the segregation population, \n44 percent were part of the Behavioral Health caseload and 12 percent were SMI.39  This \nreflected significant overrepresentation of behavioral health patients in segregation.40  On  \nJune 9, 2023, PDP’s census was 4,565 Class Members.  Thirty-six percent of the population was \non the Behavioral Health caseload and 10 percent were designated SMI.  There were 268 Class \nMembers on segregation status, reflecting an overall reduction of 43 individuals.  Of the \nsegregation population, 38 percent were part of the Behavioral Health caseload and eight percent \nwere SMI, reflecting a 10 percent reduction in SMI and behavioral health Class Members in \nsegregation.  Overrepresentation of the mentally ill in segregation persists, but the reduction, \ndespite PDP’s census increase, is a positive development and efforts should continue.  The \nfollowing table depicts SMI and Behavioral Health patients in segregation housing on  \nDecember 30, 2022, and June 9, 2023: \n \nSMI and Behavioral Health Class Members in Segregation \nDecember 30, 2022 and June 9, 2023 \n  \nDecember 30, 2022  June 9, 2023 \n  \nPercent of  Percent of \nCount  Count \nPopulation  Population \nPDP Census  4401  100%  4565  100% \nNumber of SMI  516  12%  439  10% \nNumber on BH \n1546  35%  1653  36% \nCaseload \nNumber in \n311  7%  268  6% \nSegregation \nPercent of  Percent of \n     \nSegregation  Segregation \nPopulation  Population \nNumber of SMI in \n36  12%  21  8% \nSegregation \nNumber of BH in \n138  44%  102  38% \nSegregation \n \n \n \n37 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 37.  \n38 Ibid. \n39 Ibid.  \n40 Ibid.  \n  41 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 43 of 69\nUntil TU policies are in place, clinicians’ only option for diversion of SMI and behavioral health \npatients from segregation is placement in PDP’s Mental Health inpatient unit at PHSW.  Hospital \nplacement criteria are rigid and require high acuity with severe symptoms.  The Monitoring \nTeam has recommended that PDP Healthcare issue an interim directive authorizing diversion to \nthe TUs, which will give clinicians another option with a lower placement threshold than the \nhospital.  PDP may then have to contend with insufficient TU bed space until expansion is \ncompleted, but the risk to behavioral health patients in isolation warrants interim action.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team also continues to observe patients in segregation settings whom  \nDr. Belavich flags as inappropriate for placement or whose conditions deteriorated while in \nisolation.  PDP’s Behavioral Health clinicians and leadership face unique challenges in \nmanaging their patient population with current staffing shortages and fewer options for \nincreasingly ill patients.  These providers’ dedication despite PDP’s current conditions is rare \nand admirable.  However, PDP’s current thresholds for isolating people with SMI or severe \nmental health symptoms, and retaining them on segregation status, remain outdated and must \nend.     \n \nPDP does not currently track when individuals are diverted from segregation and where they \nmay be appropriately placed instead.  PDP reports it is developing a tracking system that will \nproduce monthly reports of patient diversions from segregation to TUs or PHSW.  Tracking will \nalso assist with identifying TU needs and trends in patient acuity.  \n \nStatus of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 6—Behavioral Health in Segregation, from \nthe Monitor’s Second Report:   \n \n1.  PDP should reexamine its behavioral health policies and practices for segregation clearances \nand rounding, with particular focus on thresholds for diversion or removal from segregation \nbased on patient acuity. \nIn consultation with the Monitoring Team, PDP is in the process of implementing this \nrecommendation.   \n2.  PDP should make additional progress in identifying personnel to staff Positive \nChange/Positive Outcome treatment groups and fill Transition Units with only Transition \nUnit patients or others who can safely program in common spaces with them. \nDiscussed above, the PC/PO program is staffed to deliver more than 50 groups per day, \nbut security staff shortages reportedly prevent it.  The men’s TU contains only single \nsecurity classification TU patients, but the women’s TU continues to house Class \nMembers of various classifications, including general population and pregnant women.  \nSubstantive Provision 7—Law Library Access \n \nPDP will continue to provide law library access for all incarcerated individuals. The Monitor \nand the parties will discuss access and scheduling matters and the Monitor shall make any \nrecommendations on these matters by August 1, 2022. \n \n \n \n  42 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 44 of 69\nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nIn this reporting period, PDP created a new rotating law library schedule and standardized the \nClass Member sign-up process for general population housing units.  During site visits, Class \nMembers have reported some improvements to the Monitoring Team regarding access to law \nlibraries and properly functioning equipment.  Larger issues with out-of-cell time and staffing, \nwhich limit law library access, are ongoing.   \nA standardized sign-up process and formalized schedule for general population units allow \nPDP executives and the Monitoring Team to begin tracking law library access.  Beginning in \nApril 2023, all PDP facilities were required to implement the new law library processes.41  The \nrotating schedule provides multiple days and time slots each week for all general population \nhousing units.  The rotation was designed to accommodate Class Member court appearances, \nmedical appointments, visiting, work, and program assignments.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team reviewed a one-week sample of rosters in each of April, May, and June \n2023.  Some of the rosters for some housing units were missing, so the Monitoring Team has \nrecommended additional training for housing unit and law library officers to ensure all schedules \nare retained.  The sample comparison of sign-up rosters against the law library schedules \nsuggests that only 32 percent of the scheduled slots were documented as filled.  It is unclear \nwhether any of the remaining 68 percent of slots were offered but not documented or \ndocumentation was not retained.  It also appears that law libraries were not always open during \nscheduled times due to insufficient security personnel.  PDP’s new law library documentation is \nnot yet reliable and requires improvements, which PDP has committed to implementing in the \nnext reporting period.  With some improvements, PDP’s system for tracking access to the law \nlibrary in general population housing units will be useful to PDP management and the \nMonitoring Team in measuring compliance.   \nIn restricted housing environments, law library access is offered during out-of-cell time but is not \ntracked individually.  As reported above, out-of-cell, and therefore law library, opportunities in \nsegregation are more limited and PDP will be unable to achieve Substantial Compliance with this \nprovision until access improves.   \nPDP continues to document monthly audits of law library equipment.  The following table \nreflects equipment issues identified at each facility during equipment audits between January and \nJune 2023 and dates by which repairs were completed: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n41 CFCF did not implement the new law library process but reportedly will in the next monitoring period.   \n  43 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 45 of 69\n \nPDP Internal Law Library Equipment Audit \nJanuary – June 2023 \n \n \nHousing \nTotal Issues  Repairs \nMonth  Equipment  CFCF  DC  PICC  RCF  Unit Audit \nDocumented  Completed \nDates \nJan  Computers  0  1  0  0  1  1/19/23-\n1/24/23 \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  1/20-23 \nFeb  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  2/22/23-\nNA \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  2/28/23 \nMar  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  3/21/23-\n3/22/23 \n2023  Printers  0  0  1  0  1  3/27/23 \nApr  Computers  0  0  0  1  1  4/20/23-\n4/28/23 \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  1  1  4/27/23 \nMay  Computers  0  0  0  242  2  5/23/23-\n6/5/23 \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  5/24/23 \nJune  Computers  0  0  0  0  0  6/23/23-\nN/A \n2023  Printers  0  0  0  0  0  6/30/23 \nTotal  0  1  1  4  6 \n     \n \nSubstantive Provision 8—Discipline \n \nSub-provision 8.1--All future disciplinary proceedings at the PDP shall be held in accord with \nestablished due process rights, including the presence of the incarcerated person who is the \nsubject of the proceeding.

Of 1,815 total \ndisciplinary hearings documented from January through June 2023, 54 Class Members \nreportedly refused to participate, reflecting a relatively low three percent refusal rate.  PDP \npolicy and practice now appear to be aligned, and PDP is in compliance with this aspect of the \nsub-provision.   \n \nAs previously reported, the Monitoring Team recommended that PDP revise its disciplinary \npolicies and hearing documentation to comply with due process and Agreement requirements.45    \nIn this reporting period, PDP initiated a review of its disciplinary policies, forms, and training \nmaterials to ensure: (1) staff assistants are assigned to support Class Members throughout the \nhearing process whenever necessary and assignments are documented; (2) communication is \nfacilitated for non-English speaking Class Members, those with developmental or learning \ndisabilities, hearing or vision impairments, or other needs; (3) consistent identification and \ndocumentation of SMI and behavioral health Class Members; and (4) input from clinical \n \n43 Monthly totals included in the Monitor’s Second Report.  See Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 40.  \n44 SMI data was incomplete in the previous reporting period when this average was calculated, and the table was \ngenerated.  See Id. at 40-41.    \n45 Id. at 39-41; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 25.    \n  45 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 47 of 69\npersonnel regarding behavioral health or SMI Class Members subject to discipline.  New forms \nwill provide additional guidance for hearing officers in ensuring Class Members’ legal rights are \nprotected and they are able to understand the proceedings and present a defense.  \n \nIn this reporting period, the Monitoring Team expanded its review of disciplinary actions to \ninclude 25 completed disciplinary cases involving Class Members who were designated SMI.  \nAs previously reported, security and behavioral health documentation is inconsistent, so the \nreview included cases where SMI designations are present in at least one documentation \nsource.46  The expanded review confirmed discrepancies in security and healthcare \ndocumentation of Class Members experiencing SMI.  It also revealed: (1) failures to document if \nhearing officers seek or receive clinical feedback about subject SMI Class Members and whether \nthey should be held accountable for the alleged behavior; (2) whether clinical indications should \nlimit any sanctions imposed; (3) failures in behavioral health documentation and communication \nof Class Members’ SMI status to hearing officers; and (4) insufficient clinical assessment or \ndocumentation regarding SMI Class Members’ fitness for segregation and the presence of \nmitigating clinical indications.  \n \nBehavioral Health staff are required to complete an assessment form (PDP 86-733) prior to \nplacement of each Class Member into a segregated setting.  The form contains a section for \ntreating clinicians to note any behavioral health contraindication to placement in segregation.  It \nalso contains sections to document whether a Class Member is able participate in the hearing \nprocess and present a defense, and whether a Class Member’s mental illness should be \nconsidered a mitigating factor in any discipline imposed.  Every time a hearing officer is aware \nthat a Class Member may be SMI, this information must be considered before a hearing may \nproceed.  This requirement is consistent with PDP’s disciplinary philosophy, but its policies, \ndocumentation, and practices do not currently align.   \n \nOf 24 cases reviewed, only six Class Members were correctly documented as SMI for \ndisciplinary hearings.  In cases where SMI documentation was ambiguous, hearings should not \nhave proceeded without clarification.  Of six cases in which Class Members’ SMIs were properly \ndocumented, only one contained completed documentation of mitigating clinical indications that \nthe hearing officer should have considered in issuing sanctions.  For some SMI Class Members \nsubject to discipline, clinicians enter appropriate notes in the electronic medical record but fail to \ncomplete 86-733 forms.  Because hearing officers do not have access to patient electronic \nmedical records and rely largely on 86-733 forms, these Class Members’ mental illnesses were \nnot likely considered in their disciplinary hearings.  If they were considered, they were not \ndocumented.   \n \nHuman error and documentation omissions are expected and will likely continue even after \nimprovements are implemented, particularly given PDP’s staffing shortages.  However, PDP \ncontinues to discipline a high number of patients with acute mental illness whose symptoms may \nbe severe and contribute to or cause their institutional misconduct.  Dr. Belavich opines that \nthese patients may be unable to control their behavior or understand that it violates rules, or they \nmay lack capacity to understand the rule they violated or be deterred from future misconduct.  \nPlacement of these individuals into segregation must be avoided whenever possible, and PDP \n \n46 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 40.  \n  46 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 48 of 69\nexecutives agree that policies and practices should be revised accordingly.  They also correctly \nobserve that staffing and other barriers limit current options for meeting this population’s unique \nneeds.  PDP anticipates it will begin piloting new disciplinary forms in the next reporting period. \n \nSub-provision 8.2--The PDP shall expunge the disciplinary records for all persons who were not \npresent at their disciplinary hearings for the period March 2020 to the current date [April 12, \n2022]. . .  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \ndiscontinued)  \n \nSub-provision 8.3--[PDP shall] release from segregation all incarcerated persons who were not \npresent at their disciplinary hearings but who are [on April 12, 2022] still serving a disciplinary \nsentence, or who are in administrative segregation following a disciplinary sentence imposed \nwithout a hearing. . . \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance  \n \nIn December 2022, 12 Class Members remained in administrative segregation since at least the \nApril 15, 2022, Agreement compliance date despite having at least one disciplinary disposition \nreversed and their records expunged.47  If these Class Members’ retention in administrative \nsegregation was related to their expunged cases, they would require removal pursuant to this sub-\nprovision.  If, however, they received new disciplinary dispositions, or posed other legitimate \nsecurity risks, their retention in segregation may have been appropriate.  In this reporting period, \nthe Monitoring Team evaluated additional Jail Management System and classification committee \ndocumentation for these 12 cases.   \n \nOf the 12 cases requiring additional review, four of the Class Members had been released from \nsegregation consistent with this provision and subsequently received additional infractions before \nbeing retained on administrative segregation.  Of the remaining eight Class Members who had \nremained in segregation for more than eight months as of December 2022, none had received a \nsubsequent disciplinary report, classification committee actions were overdue, and \ndocumentation failed to articulate the classification committee’s decisions to retain them.  Four \nof the eight Class Members were released from segregation in January 2023, nine months from \nthe April 15, 2022, compliance date.  Three were released in February 2023, or 10 months later, \nand the final Class Member was released in March 2023, after at least 11 months in segregation. \n   \nAlthough the classification timelines were not met and committee decisions were poorly \ndocumented throughout the Class Members’ protracted periods of isolation, some of the Class \nMembers may have required administrative segregation.  For example, one Class Member was \ndetermined to have committed a serious assault on another Class Member with a weapon and \ncontinued to commit gang-related infractions while in segregation.  Had this and other issues \nbeen properly documented, prolonged segregation may have been justified.  Because they were \nnot, these Class Members’ retention on segregation was inappropriate.   \n \n \n47 Id. at 42.   \n  47 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 49 of 69\nBy mid-March 2023, no Class Members remained in segregation in violation of this sub-\nprovision and PDP has now achieved substantial compliance.  PDP’s practices are improving, \nincluding classification committee timeliness and documentation.  The Monitoring Team \ncontinues to review segregation placements, documentation, and practices pursuant to other \nAgreement provisions.   \n \nThe Monitor has consistently reported that there are several Agreement provisions that cannot be \nfully implemented with PDP’s existing resources.  It is important to note that this sub-provision \nwas not one of them.  PDP incorrectly certified to the Monitoring Team in August 2022, and \nagain in October 2022, that no Class Members remained in segregation in violation of this sub-\nprovision.48  Had PDP exercised more care in reviewing its own documentation prior to offering \nassurances that the deficiency was corrected, several Class Members might have been spared \nmonths of additional isolation.  Instead, this easily correctible yet highly consequential systemic \nfailure persisted nearly one year into Agreement implementation and unnecessarily exposed \nClass Members to harm as a result. \n \nIt does not appear that PDP failed to correct this issue for lack of will to comply with this Court’s \norder, and its negligence in doing so is uncharacteristic of its approach to the Agreement as a \nwhole.  PDP executives were admonished to the potential consequences of the failure to correct, \nyet certify that a deficiency was corrected.  They expressed regret for the error and have \ncommitted to greater vigilance going forward.  Finally, PDP acknowledges the many harms \nClass Members must endure inside PDP facilities in violation of this Agreement and their \nconstitutional rights.  PDP correctly observes that without support from its Co-Defendants and \nPhiladelphia’s other criminal justice partners, it will not be able to protect Class Members from \nevery harm they face.  However, this bleak and dangerous reality in no way absolves PDP of its \nresponsibility to protect Class Members wherever possible, and it failed to do so in this instance.   \n \nSub-provision 8.4--[PDP shall] cancel sanctions [imposed in hearing held between March 2020 \nand April 12, 2022] that require payments for damage to property or other restitution, and/or \nreturn payments made by persons who were required to pay for damage to property or other \nharms.  Provided, however, the PDP may seek to conduct due process hearings for individuals \ncovered by this provision who are still in segregation, but only: (a) if there is a small and \ndiscrete number of such cases, and (b) upon first providing counsel for Plaintiffs the names of \nthose persons, the disciplinary charges, and information related to the length of placement in \nsegregation.  Nothing in this section prohibits persons subject to the disciplinary process set \nforth above from asserting individual legal challenges to the discipline.  Defendants shall \nprovide to counsel for plaintiffs a list of individuals and disciplinary matters subject to this \nexception by April 15, 2022. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring  \ndiscontinued)  \n \nSubstantive Provision 9—Tablets \n \n \n48 Id. at 42; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 25.  \n  48 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 50 of 69\nSub-provision 9.1--PDP has undertaken expansion efforts to increase the number of tablets \navailable within the PDP facilities by adding eighty (80) additional tablets, according to \noperational capabilities and housing designs. The expansion of tablets is as follows: from four \n(4) to six (6) tablets on each housing unit at CFCF for a total of fifty-six (56) additional tablets; \nand, at RCF, expanding from six (6) to eight (8) tablets on the [first floor] (4 housing units) and \nexpanding from eight (8) to twelve (12) tablets on the [2nd and 3rd floors] of RCF (4 larger \nunits) for a total of twenty-four (24) additional tablets at RCF. This expansion process will be \ncompleted by May 1, 2022.49  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP reports that it continues to maintain an inventory of tablets, consistent with this sub-\nprovision, with no significant change since the last reporting period.  In addition to the 421 \ntablets maintained in housing units, PDP reports that it has reserved an additional 187 tablets for \neducational programming, which is consistent with previously reported availability.50  PDP \nreports that it will also be activating additional tablets in the next reporting period designated for \nsick call requests.  Future reports will include outcomes from that project in Substantive \nProvision 5–Healthcare.  The following table reflects current tablet totals at each PDP facility \nbased on documentation provided:  \n \nTablet Availability at Each PDP Facility \nDecember 2022 and June 2023 \n  \nTotal \nTotal \nFacility/Housing  Tablets \nTablets  Difference \nUnit  December   \nJune 2023 \n2022 \n \n \nASD Total  12  12  0 \n \nMOD 3 Total  12  12  0 \n \nCFCF Total  198  184  -14 \n \nDC Total  60  63  3 \n \nPICC Total  60  66  6 \n \nRCF Total  85  84  -1 \n \nTotal  427  421  -6 \n \n \n49 The Agreement, as written, requires the expansion of tablets at RCF “from six (6) to eight (8) tablets on the 2nd \nand 3rd floor (4 housing units) and expanding from eight (8) to twelve (12) tablets on the 1st floor of RCF (4 larger \nunits) . . .”.   In fact, RCF’s larger units are located on the 2nd and 3rd floors and the smaller units are located on the \n1st floor, suggesting that the numbers of tablets required were inadvertently reversed.  To correct this small oversight \nin the Agreement’s drafting, PDP must instead increase tablets from eight to twelve on the second and third floor \nhousing units and from six to eight on the first-floor housing units in order to achieve substantial compliance with \nthis aspect of the substantive provision.   \n50 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 44.  \n  49 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 51 of 69\nPDP leadership acknowledges ongoing failures to ensure that tablets are charged, operational, \nand available to Class Members consistent with this sub-provision.  In April 2023, PDP issued a \ndirective reiterating expectations that housing unit personnel charge tablets overnight, reissue \nthem each morning, and follow protocol for any broken tablets.  The written directive and \nexpectations were reportedly discussed with staff during briefings at all three jails between  \nApril 12 and April 19, 2023.  In May 2023, despite the April directive, the Monitoring Team \nobserved that some housing units did not have required numbers of tablets available.  Feedback \nfrom Class Members regarding tablet availability continues to vary.  Some Class Members report \nconsistent access and others report receiving limited or inconsistent access.  The Monitoring \nTeam continues to recommend that PDP consider utilizing PDP’s internal auditing team to \nconduct quarterly audits of tablet availability.   \n \nSub-provision 9.2--The parties and the Monitor will discuss any future increases in the number \nof tablets based on all relevant factors, including operational feasibility and physical capacity. \nFurther, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies and practices are \nnecessary to address equitable and fair individual access to available tablets, and if so, the PDP \nshall implement agreed upon practices. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP reports that it plans to provide tablets to all eligible Class Members as part of its next \ntelephone contract procurement.  Procurement is anticipated to begin in the spring of 2024 when \nthe existing telephone contract expires.  This is a positive development, though procurement will \nnot likely be completed until late 2024.  With all required infrastructure upgrades that must be \ncompleted first, tablets may not be issued to Class Members until mid-2025.   \n \nPDP’s tablet expansion to include sick call requests should be piloted by the end of 2023.  PDP \nhas begun implementation of its plan to expand capabilities to include the submission of \ngrievances and other requests.  The grievance pilot was initiated in May 2023.  In June 2023, 320 \ngrievances were filed via tablets and an additional 225 requests for services were received via \ntablets.  As anticipated, the challenge for PDP going forward will be providing timely and \nmeaningful responses to significant increases in requests and grievances.  PDP will need \nmechanisms for triaging emergent grievances and requests, as well as managing administrative \nissues like duplicate requests.  PDP has developed a training video for Class Members in English \nand Spanish, which was made available to Class Members systemwide in July 2023.   \n   \nOnce the tablet expansion for grievances and requests is finalized, the Monitoring Team will be \nable to consider them in making compliance determinations.  Previously, access to PDP’s \ngrievance system was inadequate and data was therefore unreliable.  A review of grievances in \nthis reporting period demonstrated that no grievances were logged regarding lack of access to \ntablets from January through May 2023, prior to the tablet grievance pilot.  In June 2023, 14 \ngrievances were submitted alleging limited access to tablets, eight of which were duplicate \nfilings by the same person and six of which were new grievances.  All grievances were filed in \nthe same housing unit, which is valuable information that should be utilized by PDP \nmanagement in correcting problems.  The Monitoring Team has recommended that PDP \n  50 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 52 of 69\nmanagement and executives regularly review grievance information to identify and address areas \nof non-compliance.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team has considered recommending that PDP pilot a tablet sign-up process to \nensure more equitable access for Class Members.  This recommendation will be revisited in the \nfuture, but given PDP’s current staffing levels, a tablet sign-up would not likely be successful.  \nPDP should instead continue to focus on ensuring staff are following existing tablet protocols, \nexpansion, and enhanced tablet functionality.  \nSubstantive Provision 10—Phone Calls \n \nSub-provision 10.1--PDP agrees to maintain 15 minutes of free phone calls on a daily basis for \nthe PDP population.  Further, the Monitor and the parties shall discuss whether any policies and \npractices are necessary to address equitable and fair individual access to phones and, if so, the \nPDP shall implement agreed upon practices.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nPDP reports that it continues to provide 15 minutes of free phone calls on a daily basis in all but \nits punitive segregation units.  The greatest barrier to compliance remains critical staff vacancies, \nwhich limit out-of-cell time, and eliminate access to phones.  Other barriers that impede Class \nMembers’ access to phones may include housing unit dynamics that result in more assertive \nClass Members controlling phone access.     \n \nPDP is able to generate a “zero-usage report” that allows PDP to determine whether a given \nphone is operational and identifies any Class Member who did not utilize the phone system in a \ngiven time frame.  In the next reporting period, the Monitoring Team will use the zero-usage \nreport to attempt to audit phone access for a sample of Class Members to determine whether they \nchose not to use the phone or were otherwise prevented from making a call.   \n \nSub-provision 10.2--Upon a return to normal operations, the PDP will revert to the provision of \n10 minutes of free phone calls. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n \nAs reported above under Substantive Provision 4—Return to Normal Operations, PDP does not \nyet have a plan for the return to normal operations and, therefore, remains in non-compliance \nwith this sub-provision. \n  \nSubstantive Provision 11—PICC Emergency Call Systems \n  \nThe Monitor and the parties shall discuss the issues unique to PICC regarding emergency call \nsystems and access to tablets and/or phones and determine whether any policies and practices \nare necessary to address these matters considering all relevant factors, including operational \nfeasibility and physical capacity. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n  51 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 53 of 69\n \nAs previously reported, the Monitoring Team has discussed cell-based emergency call systems \nand tablet and phone expansion at PICC with PDP executive and maintenance teams.51  The \nMonitoring Team continues to recommend against the expansion of PICC’s current call button \nsystem and instead recommends consistent adherence to PDP’s security check protocols.  In this \nreporting period, PDP attempted to implement the Monitoring Team’s recommendation to audit \nthe timeliness and quality of PDP’s safety checks.  PDP reports that without an integrated \nsystem, CCTV download times were excessively burdensome and unsustainable.  PDP \nexecutives acknowledge deficiencies in safety check practices, evidenced most recently by the \nMay 2023 escape.  PDP reports that it is awaiting recommendations from the post-escape \nsecurity analysis to determine the best path forward. \n \nThe Monitoring Team will evaluate any proposed strategies in the next reporting period, which \nmay include random audits of housing units by on-duty supervisors or the use of light duty \nsupervisors to assist with independent reviews on-site at PICC.  The Monitoring Team has also \nrecommended upgrades to the CCTV system that would give PDP executives direct terminal \naccess to CCTV from their desktop computers.        \nSubstantive Provision 12—Locks \n \nSub-provision 12.1--PDP initiated the lock replacement program for PICC. . . which will be \ncompleted by June 30, 2022.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nIn the second reporting period, 16 cells at PICC required new door frames before locks could be \nchanged.52  In this reporting period, 11 doors remain.  PDP reports that lock replacement will be \ncompleted by August 2023.  If so, and if PDP also updates post orders to include protocols for \nnonoperational locks, it will achieve substantial compliance with this sub-provision in the next \nreporting period. \n   \nSub-provision 12.2--PDP initiated the lock replacement program for. . .RCF, which will be \ncompleted by June 30, 2022. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs previously reported, staff training on lock inspections and lock replacement at RCF was \ncompleted in May 2022.53  As with sub-provision 12.1, PDP must update post orders to achieve \nsubstantial compliance with this sub-provision.   \n \nThough not subject to the Agreement, PDP reports that it is also replacing locks at CFCF, which \nit anticipates completing in September 2023.   \n \n \n51 Id. at 48. \n52 Ibid. \n53 Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 28-29. \n  52 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 54 of 69\nSub-provision 12.3--For the repair of call button devices in existing facilities, PDP will conduct \na one-time test of all call buttons and make any necessary repairs by August 1, 2022. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \n \nSub-provision 12.4--Any future complaints related to the operation of call buttons shall be \naddressed through work orders, which will be addressed and completed by Defendants in a \ntimely manner.  \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nIn the previous reporting period, PDP had not provided evidence that call button repairs were \noccurring at CFCF.54  In this reporting period, CFCF submitted completed work orders for 42 \ncall button repairs from January through June 2023.  RCF maintenance staff reported there were \nno work orders for call buttons during the period of January through May 2023, which seems \nunusual given patterns of call button damage and repairs in PDP.      \n \nThe average time for call button repairs at CFCF is difficult to ascertain based on the work \norders alone.  Some work orders list several cells requiring call button repairs in one, and some \ninclude single cell call button repairs but list additional repairs needed for the same cell.  Work \norders with limited cells or limited repairs generally occurred within 48 hours.  More extensive \nrepairs or repairs to multiple cells took longer, including up to several days to complete.  The \nMonitoring Team will review a second set of work orders from CFCF in the next reporting \nperiod to verify that work is being completed in a timely manner.    \n \nAs with sub-provisions 12.1 and 12.2, updates to post orders are required to ensure staff are \ninformed of their responsibilities when a call button is nonoperational, which may require \nrehousing the occupant or increasing the frequency of security checks while repairs are pending.   \n \nSub-provision 12.5--PDP will provide refresher training before June 1, 2022, to correctional \nstaff on PDP practices with respect to responses to the emergency call button system. \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \n  discontinued) \nSubstantive Provision 13—Visiting \n  \nSub-provision 13.1--As of March 7, 2022, PDP reinstituted in-person visitation for all \nvaccinated incarcerated persons with family members. PDP is in the process of increasing \ncapacity for in-person visits by increasing the number of visits that can be accommodated during \nthe current hourly schedule.  At a minimum, current CFCF visiting shall be increased by 8 slots, \nPICC increased by 4 slots, and RCF increased by 2 slots.  \n   \n \n54 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 49-50.  \n  53 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 55 of 69\nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance (March 3, 2023, monitoring \ndiscontinued)  \n \nSub-provision 13.2--Further, the parties and Monitor shall discuss all matters related to \nvisitation, and the monitor shall issue recommendations on these issues.  \n   \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance  \n \nAs recommended in the previous reporting period, PDP administered surveys and held focus \ngroups to receive feedback from Class Members, visitors, and visiting personnel regarding the \nquality of PDP’s visiting program.55  PDP also posted signage in the visiting processing areas \nencouraging visitors to reach out to the Office of Community Justice and Outreach to provide \nfeedback.   \n \nPDP reports that it has received the following feedback thus far:   \n•  PDP’s website should include all visiting policies and procedures. \n•  When the visiting website is down for “scheduled maintenance,” visitors are unable to \nschedule visits, and the durations of scheduled maintenance are not clearly communicated \nto users.   \n•  Visitors report that the visiting website’s technical support phone line has excessive wait \ntimes. \n•  Visitors report that they are not notified when scheduled visits are cancelled.  This is \nfrequently true when a Class Member is in punitive segregation at the time of scheduling \nor is placed in punitive segregation after a visit is scheduled.  \n•  Class Members and staff request that Class Members receive the ability to approve or \ndeny visits.  Currently, Class Members are unable to manage visits and do not know who \nis visiting until the day of a visit.  Class Members report that they may want to refuse \nsome visits or prioritize some visitors over others.  Staff report that it would be more \nefficient for them, and helpful in avoiding potential conflict in the visiting area, if Class \nMembers were able to accept or deny scheduled visits.   \n•  Class Members request more support from PDP in visiting with their children.  For \nexample, they have requested that PDP personnel liaise with caregivers and facilitate \nvisits.     \n•  Visitors and Class Members request that PDP allow visitors to resume taking \nphotographs during visits.   \n•  Class Members request additional access to tablet visits generally, and specifically on \nweekends.  They also report that existing tablets are often unavailable and request greater \nconsistency with current tablet visiting.        \n•  Visitors and Class Members request expanded visiting hours to include evenings for \nvisitors who work and children who attend school during the day.   \n \n \n55 Id. at 51.  \n  54 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 56 of 69\nPDP has committed to research the feasibility of implementing improvements consistent with \nthis feedback and will provide updates in the next reporting period.   \n \nThe Monitoring Team made additional recommendations in previous reporting periods that PDP \nhas agreed to include in its visiting improvement plans.56  These include analyzing filled versus \nunfilled in-person visiting timeslots and making any necessary scheduling adjustments \n(consistent with the evening visiting request above), and ensuring that family visiting spaces in \nall facilities are regularly sanitized and consistently stocked with age and culturally appropriate \nactivities for youth and Class Members to have meaningful engagement.   \n \nSub-provision 13.3--PDP reaffirms that it will acknowledge and record the vaccination status of \nthose individuals who provide information that they were vaccinated. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Substantial Compliance \n\t\nIn the previous reporting period, PDP indicated that it utilized Philadelphia’s composite record to \nverify Class Members’ vaccination status when they self-reported being vaccinated outside of \nPDP.57  In February 2023, PDP provided documentation of this practice.  PDP has, therefore, \nachieved substantial compliance with this sub-provision, and the Monitoring Team will \ndiscontinue monitoring this aspect of the substantive provision.   \nSubstantive Provision 14—Attorney Visiting  \n \nSub-provision 14.1--PDP shall continue to follow a policy of providing attorneys with access to \ntheir clients within 45 minutes of their scheduled visit. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs previously reported, the requirement that attorneys receive access to their clients within 45 \nminutes of scheduled visits is not possible to measure because attorney visits are not scheduled \nfor specific times.58  PDP and the Monitoring Team explored different possibilities for defining \n“scheduled visit” and measuring compliance with the 45-minute requirement.  The Monitoring \nTeam determined that the current official visiting protocol and PDP’s tracking system are \ninadequate to accurately measure wait times.   \n \nThe Monitor receives regular updates from counsel from the Defender Association of \nPhiladelphia, the private bar, and Remick class counsel regarding delays in official visiting and \nother issues reported by their Class Member clients.  Visiting issues reported to the Monitoring \nTeam continue to include lengthy delays resulting from failed population counts and other \nsecurity incidents.  Attorneys at times report waiting for hours to see clients.  On two occasions, \nthe Monitor spoke with attorneys in PDP’s visitor waiting area, some of whom reported having \n \n56 Id. at 51-52; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 29-30.  \n57 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 52.   \n58 When COVID-19 testing protocols were instituted, attorneys were required to give advance notice of visits but not \nfor specific timeslots.  In this reporting period, PDP reverted to pre-COVID-19 protocols and attorneys are no longer \nrequired to provide advance notice of visits.  See also Id. at 52-53.   \n  55 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 57 of 69\nwaited more than two hours with no status updates from PDP personnel and were appropriately \nexasperated.  Although most attorneys report that visiting wait times have generally improved \nsince the most rigid COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were removed, the frequency of reported \nexcess wait times remains unacceptable.  This is especially true given PDP’s population \nreduction goals, which require timely access to counsel and the courts.  \n \nFinally, the 45-minute Agreement requirement is too long for counsel to wait for clients in any \ncase absent institutional emergencies.  Therefore, the Monitoring Team requested that PDP \nrevisit its official visiting policies and prioritize changes that are most likely to improve access to \ncounsel by significantly reducing wait times.  PDP’s compliance with this sub-provision will be \nmeasured against the 45-minute wait time negotiated by the Parties; however, revisions should \nbe designed to exceed the Agreement requirement.   \n \nIn this reporting period, the Monitor requested that PDP work directly with the Defender \nAssociation of Philadelphia, which represents the large majority of Class Members in their \npending criminal matters, to strategize mutually agreeable solutions to official visiting delays.  \nTom Innes, Director, Prison Policy and Advocacy, Defender Association of Philadelphia, \ndedicates much time and attention to this issue and, in consultation with a representative from the \nprivate bar, agreed to work with PDP’s Deputy Commissioner of Administration and facility \nwardens to identify solutions.  Options considered included: (1) modifying PDP count times, \nwhich reportedly cause the most frequent delays; (2) adjusting tablet visiting schedules to free up \nspace in tablet visiting rooms for in-person visits during high-traffic hours; and (3) requiring \nattorneys to schedule visits in advance, giving PDP more time to prepare for visits. \n   \nAs a result of this collaboration, versions of all three options were piloted in this reporting \nperiod.  With additional trial and error planned in the next reporting period, PDP anticipates a \nsolution will be finalized before the end of 2023.  The Monitoring Team will then work with the \nParties to revise this sub-provision and identify an appropriate compliance measure.  The \nMonitor thanks Mr. Innes for his assistance in resolving this issue and is hopeful that access to \ncounsel will improve as a result. \n \nSub-provision 14.2--For remote legal visits (in all formats), the PDP shall continue to ensure \nthat the client is on the call/computer/video within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time of the \nappointment.  \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nIn the first reporting period, PDP made progress in providing additional space and opportunities \nfor virtual attorney visits and shortened wait times for Class Member clients.59  As with in-\nperson official visits, PDP’s data is cumbersome and measuring compliance will require \nevaluating information from a combination of sources.  Although in-person official visits remain \nthe source of the most frequent complaints, attorneys also continue to report delays with tablet \nvisits that exceed 15 minutes.  This information is consistent with delays tracked by the \nMonitoring Team.   \n \n \n59 Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 30. \n  56 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 58 of 69\nFrom December 6, 2022, through September 1, 2023, Deputy Monitor Grosso scheduled a total \nof 192 remote tablet meetings.  From February 6, 2023, through September 1, 2023, 119 of 137 \nscheduled tablet visits were attended by Class Members, which is an encouraging attendance \nrate.  The remaining 18 visits were no-shows.  Some visits continue to be delayed beyond the 15-\nminute window provided for in this sub-provision, and, at times, have exceeded 90 minutes.  \nDirect contact with shift commanders when remote meetings are delayed generally improves \nattendance, however, shift commanders did not always answer when called.  PDP explained \ndelays and cancellations as resulting from delayed population counts or other security incidents, \nwhich is consistent with explanations reportedly provided to attorneys.   \n \nCurrently, all tablet meetings are scheduled in one-hour time slots.  The Monitoring Team has \nrecommended that PDP increase efficiency by also offering 30-minute time slots for tablet visits.      \n \nSub-provision 14.3--For these time frames, PDP will not be responsible for delays caused by the \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, but where a delay is caused by the \nincarcerated person or by exigent circumstances, PDP will inform the attorney of the delay. \n \n  Compliance Rating:  Non-compliance \n  \nAs previously reported, PDP’s policy does not require notification to attorneys when visits are \ndelayed or cancelled, and no temporary directives have been issued consistent with this \nrequirement.60  Since February 6, 2023, the Deputy Monitor was not notified in advance of \ndelayed or cancelled tablet meetings, which is consistent with information the Monitoring Team \nreceived from attorneys.   \n \nPDP acknowledges on-going failures to communicate delays and cancellations and has \ncommitted to policy revisions once it finalizes solutions currently being piloted.  PDP executives \nreport that, in the interim, personnel have been instructed to notify attorneys of delays, \ncancellations, and refusals, and personnel have reported to the Monitoring Team that they \nunderstand the requirement.  However, personnel may not be held accountable for failure to \ncomply with the notification requirement until policies and post orders are revised and personnel \nare trained.   \nSubstantive Provision 15—COVID-19 Testing \n \nThe PDP shall continue the present policy regarding testing of persons who are scheduled for \ncourt.  Those who are housed on “green blocks” are either fully vaccinated or are not \nconsidered to have been exposed to COVID-19.  They will be rapid-tested the night before court, \nand they will be brought to court if they receive negative test results. Those housed on a “yellow \nblock” may have been exposed to a COVID-19-positive individual, and they will be rapid-tested \ntwice, the night before court and the morning of court.  They will be transported to court if both \ntests are negative.  Those housed on a “red block” are COVID-19 positive and will be isolated \nfor ten days and not brought to court during that time frame.  These protocols will be maintained \nsubject to continued cooperation from criminal justice partners and on the advice of the \nPhiladelphia Department of Public Health. Provided, however, that the Defendants shall not \n \n60 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 54.  \n  57 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 59 of 69\nunilaterally change the protocols and they shall timely notify Plaintiffs’ counsel of any change or \nproposed change in these protocols. \n \nCompliance Rating: Substantial Compliance  \n \nIn the second reporting period, PDP received guidance from the Philadelphia Department of \nPublic Health (PDPH) to revise the COVID-19 testing and quarantine protocols, and on \nNovember 29, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) amended its guidelines for \ncorrectional facilities.61  Commissioner Carney issued a memorandum on December 6, 2022, \ndirecting PDP Healthcare to administer a single COVID-19 test for all Class Member patients in \nadvance of scheduled court hearings.  In February 2023, the Monitoring Team audited PDP’s \ncompliance with the December 2022, protocols and determined that PDP was in compliance. \n \nIn consultation with PDPH, PDP further reduced testing requirements via a memorandum issued \nby the Commissioner on March 9, 2023.  PDP discontinued COVID-19 testing for Class \nMembers going to court except those housed in quarantine units, who receive tests within 24-\nhours of transport.  In May 2023, the Monitoring Team again audited compliance with the most \nrecent testing protocols and determined that PDP was in compliance.   \n \nChanges to PDP’s COVID-19 testing protocols were made in consultation with PDPH and \npursuant to CDC guidelines.  The Agreement also requires that PDP timely notify plaintiffs’ co-\ncounsel of any changes in testing protocols.  In October 2023, Plaintiffs’ co-counsel reported, \nand PDP confirmed, that PDP had failed to notify plaintiffs’ co-counsel of changes to COVID-19 \ntesting protocols in previous reporting periods.  PDP then established a protocol to ensure \nPlaintiffs’ co-counsel are notified of changes consistent with Agreement requirements and initial \nnotifications were made via email communication dated October 11, 2023.   \n \nPDP has achieved substantial compliance with this substantive provision.  The Monitoring Team \nwill continue to monitor PDP’s protocol for notifying Plaintiffs’ co-counsel of any changes in \nCOVID-19 testing requirements through the next reporting period.  Once this requirement is \nsatisfied, monitoring of this substantive provision will be discontinued.  The Monitoring Team \nwill, however, continue to report any changes in PDP’s testing protocols.   \nSubstantive Provision 16—Quarantine  \n \nIf there becomes a need in the future for use of quarantine housing areas at PDP, CDC \nguidelines shall continue to be followed for those who have been exposed to COVID-19. Under \ncurrent policy, see Interim Guidance on Management for Correctional and Detention Centers, \nJune 9, 2021, for persons who are vaccinated and are exposed to a person with COVID-19, but \ntest negative, they shall not be quarantined; for those who have been exposed to COVID-19, but \nwho have not been vaccinated, and test negative, they shall be quarantined for a period of ten \ndays and released at that time if they test negative. \n \n \n61 Guidance on Management of COVID-19 in Homeless Service Sites and in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n(November 29, 2022) available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/homeless-correctional-\nsettings.html  \n  58 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 60 of 69\nCompliance Rating: Substantial Compliance \n \nAs previously reported, on November 29, 2022, the CDC revised its guidance for managing \nCOVID-19 in correctional facilities, which superseded the May 2022, guidance referenced in this \nsubstantive provision.62  The November 2022 guidance remains in effect and includes the \nfollowing:  \n   \n1.  Recommends enhanced COVID-19 prevention strategies when the COVID-19 \nCommunity Levels are high or when there are facility-specific risks.  \n2.  No longer routinely recommends quarantine after someone is exposed to a person with \nCOVID-19 but continues to provide considerations for facilities that prefer to continue \nimplementing quarantine protocols.  \n3.  Includes an option to end isolation for people with COVID-19 after seven days with a \nnegative viral test.  \n4.  Emphasizes the importance of maximizing access to in-person visitation to promote \ncorrectional and detention facility residents’ mental health and well-being. \n \nPDP reports that it consulted with PDPH, the Court of Common Pleas, the District Attorney’s \nOffice, the Defender Association of Philadelphia, Private Counsel, and the Sheriff’s Department \nand again revised its COVID-19 response protocols via a memorandum issued by the \nCommissioner on March 9, 2023.  PDP agreed to: \n \n1.  Continue requiring masking by everyone when inside PDP facilities. \n2.  Continue use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as recommended by the CDC.  \n3.  Not require vaccination of Class Members for in-person visits. \n4.  Continue testing for COVID-19 at intake. \n5.  Discontinue testing for court transfers for those in non-quarantine areas.  Those in \nquarantine housing areas will be tested once, the day before their scheduled court date. \n6.  Continue to send people to court in masks. \n7.  Discontinue testing for official visits for those in non-quarantine housing areas.  Class \nMembers in quarantine housing will be tested once within 24-hours prior to their visit, \nrequiring the attorney for the Class Member to provide notice of the visit 24-hours prior \nto the requested visit time so that testing may occur. \n8.  Continue the length of intake quarantine to ensure the following is completed: medical \nscreening, a negative COVID-19 PCR test, and negative TB test are received.  This is \nestimated to take 3-5 days. \n9.  COVID-19 isolation will remain at least 10 days in length. \n10. If a housing unit has been exposed to COVID-19, movement will be restricted and the \nhousing unit’s residents will be tested on day 5.  If the residents test negative, movement \nrestrictions will be lifted after day 5.  If on day 5 one or more residents test positive, \nmovement will remain restricted and the residents will be tested after 5 additional days. \n11. Discontinue symptom screening of everyone entering PDP. \n \n \n62 Ibid. \n  59 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 61 of 69\nOn May 11, 2023, the federal public health emergency expired.  Again, in consultation with \nPDPH and based on CDC guidelines, PDP supplemented the March memorandum with the \nfollowing COVID-19 protocols: \n \n1.  Masking due to COVID-19 is no longer required. \n2.  Masks will be used as medically necessary (e.g., infirmary, N95 required for healthcare \nstaff when interacting with COVID-19 positive or suspected COVID-19 positive Class \nMembers). \n3.  Masks may be required if infections recur within PDP or community levels rise. \n4.  Employees and Class Members may wear masks if they wish. \n5.  Healthcare staff are encouraged to wear masks at the request of Class Members during \nhealthcare visits. \n6.  PDP will continue to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to Class Members. \n7.  The healthcare worker mandate is still in effect. \n8.  Frequent handwashing or the use of sanitizer along with routine cleaning of workspaces \nis encouraged.  \n \nOn September 12, 2023, PDP again modified its COVID-19 guidelines based on CDC guidelines \nand PDPH recommendations for managing a spike in COVID-19 cases nationally.  Current \nguidelines include:  \n \na.  Testing of all Class Members at intake.   \nb.  Rapid testing of those who report symptoms either in person or in writing. \nc.  After identification of a positive case, cellmates or those residing in the same dorm \nsection will be screened after 5 days.  \nd.  The entire unit will not be screened. \ne.  Masking is strongly encouraged for Class Members on units where a positive case has \nbeen identified. \nf.  Isolation of COVID-19 positive Class Members for 10 days. \ng.  No movement restriction except for those in isolation.  \nh.  There will be no testing for the following: courts, official visits, family visits, and \nprograms. \n \nDuring site visits, the Monitoring Team noted that some staff were unaware which housing units \nwere on quarantine and which were under isolation and observed some staff working in these \nunits without appropriate PPE.  The Monitoring Team recommended that PDP use signage to \ninform staff and visitors of housing unit quarantine and isolation status.63  PDP has implemented \nthis recommendation, and all staff interviewed during site visits in this reporting period were \naware of COVID-19 status of all housing units.  Periodically, personnel were observed with \ninadequate or improperly donned PPE despite reporting awareness of a unit’s COVID-19 status.     \nThis issue must be monitored by facility supervisors and addressed individually. \n \n \n63 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 57.  \n  60 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 62 of 69\nPDP has achieved substantial compliance with this substantive provision and compliance \nmonitoring is discontinued.  The Monitoring Team will continue to report any changes in \nCOVID-19 protocols.   \nSubstantive Provision 17—Sanitation \n \nSub-provision 17.1--Defendants agree to continue conducting the weekly General Inspection \n(“GI”) cleaning days with supplies provided by officers to clean cells and housing areas. \n \n  Compliance Rating:   Partial Compliance \n \nIn this reporting period, PDP filled two additional maintenance vacancies and, on April 24, 2023, \ntemporarily expanded its external maintenance contract.  City maintenance personnel now \nprimarily serve DC and other smaller housing units, and contractors have expanding services to \ninclude PICC.  As discussed above under Status of Recommendations, Substantive Provision 1, \ncontract expansion was limited largely to emergency repairs and does not include preventative \nmaintenance necessary for physical plant upkeep, especially of older facilities.  However, \nmaintenance contract expansion marks progress and improvements will be assessed in \nsubsequent reporting periods.   \n \nPDP continues to provide documentation of regular general cleaning inspections (GI) and \nissuance of cleaning supplies.  All staff interviewed during site visits report awareness of GI \nrequirements.  Many units are clean and maintained consistent with industry standards and the \nMonitoring Team has noted improvements in some areas, including medical housing units.  As \nPDP closes units for lock replacement and other maintenance issues, maintenance personnel \nhave been updating them with fresh paint, lighting and tile replacement, deep cleaning of \nshowers, and plumbing repairs.   \n \nUnfortunately, some units remain unacceptably dirty with unabated vector control issues and \ncontinue to require significant maintenance.  In addition to previously reported conditions, \nflooring in some PICC housing units is crumbling, and uncollected trash and food waste are still \nfrequently observed during site visits and on CCTV.  During a site visit in May 2023, the \nMonitoring Team again observed unsanitary conditions in restricted housing units at CFCF.64   \n \nWith population increases, DC has been repopulated with more than 500 Class Members in both \nrenovated and unrenovated housing units.  During a site visit in August 2023, Class Members in \none unrenovated dormitory reported the ongoing frequent presence of rodents and insects.  Many \ndormitory occupants were wearing masks, reportedly not to guard against COVID-19, but to \nprotect them from a perceived risk of respiratory illness from mold visible throughout shower \nareas.  PDP has not addressed weekly deep cleaning needs in cells, showers, and common areas \nin most housing facilities systemwide.  This is especially true in housing units where \nincarcerated workers are not permitted.   \n  \nThe Monitoring Team was encouraged by the appointment of three new wardens, all of whom \nhave made improvements in their respective facilities in their short tenures thus far.  Facility \n \n64 Id. at 57-60; Monitor’s First Report, supra note 7, at 33-35.  \n  61 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 63 of 69\nleadership is responsive to Monitoring Team observations during site visits and acts quickly to \nresolve problems.  For example, DC’s Warden took immediate action when alerted to dormitory \nconditions described above, and all wardens have communicated to the Monitoring Team an \nunderstanding of their leadership obligations in ensuring clean, safe, and habitable living units.  \nFollowing the February 2023 site visits, the Monitoring Team recommended increased rounds by \nwardens and deputy wardens to assess maintenance and sanitation and, reportedly, recommended \nrounds are occurring.   \n \nSome Class Members in this reporting period continued to complain of lack of access to soap \nand toilet paper, and staff have offered inconsistent reports about the frequency of soap and toilet \npaper distribution.  Leaking or non-operational toilet and sink units, showers with no hot water \nor water that is scalding, and personal belongings and commissary items regularly destroyed by \nrodents are among common complaints.   \n \nWomen continue to report unnecessary staff control over and inconsistent supplies of feminine \nhygiene products.  Staff typically report that supplies are unlimited and unrestricted, but \nsimultaneously note that Class Members frequently misuse feminine hygiene products.  Use of \nmaxi pads for cleaning, as toilet seat covers or art supplies, and other purposes is common, \nlargely unavoidable, and in no way reduces jailers’ obligation to provide them for menstruation.  \nClass Members’ efforts to make uncomfortable and unsanitary conditions more livable are never \nappropriate rationales for denying feminine hygiene products.  Unless misuse of pads or tampons \nposes a risk to safety and security, they must be provided upon request, without fail.   \n \nPDP continues to utilize pest and rodent control services for both routine treatments and \nemergencies.  However, deteriorating infrastructure and inadequate food and trash collection are \nideal conditions for rodents to enter PDP facilities and breed at a pace that current efforts fail to \ncorrect.  Inconsistent supplies of such basic yet vital provisions as soap, toilet paper, and \nfeminine hygiene products are due in part to inconsistent staff in PDP housing units.  In a \nproperly functioning direct supervision model, staff are part of the housing unit community and \nare committed to the overall operations of their assigned units, including ensuring the population \nhas necessary supplies to maintain cell sanitation and personal hygiene.  Inconsistent housing \nunit personnel is a function of the staffing crisis and is currently unavoidable in PDP.   \n \nPDP’s extensive and protracted staffing shortages have resulted in collective indifference to \nvarious systemic deficiencies, including unsanitary conditions in some housing units.  Given \nPDP’s shortage of lieutenants and sergeants, correcting the issues requires daily guidance from \ndeputy wardens and wardens to set expectations, ensure sufficient provision of supplies, and \naddress unresolved maintenance problems.  It also requires closer monitoring by and support of \nPDP executives to reinforce expectations and ensure appropriate acknowledgement and \naccountability as needed.     \n \nSub-provision 17.2--[Defendants agree] to provide regular laundry services under current PDP \npolicies. \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance   \n \n  62 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 64 of 69\nThe Monitoring Team continues to receive regular complaints from Class Members about \ninsufficient laundry services.  As previously reported, there are policies and systems in place to \nensure appropriate laundry exchange.65  However, some Class Members in general population \nunits are not consistently receiving two sets of outer clothing, and those in segregation are not \nconsistently receiving a change of clothing during showers.  During site visits, Class Members \nroutinely report to the Monitoring Team having only one set of outer clothing and nothing to \nwear when exchanging clothing or when clothing is taken for laundering.       \n \nAt CFCF, linen exchange is supervised and documented by staff and facility leadership is able to \naudit linen exchange via CCTV.  CCTV does not capture quantity or quality of items issued but \ndepicts exchanges occurring consistent with documentation.  Audits can also verify or disprove \nallegations that items are not received so that managers can target problem areas.  Similar audits \nare more challenging at other facilities where Class Member workers are responsible for \nlaundering and exchanging linens, such as at PICC and RCF, or where camera placement is \nlimited, such as at DC.  PDP policy and post orders have not yet been revised to reflect these \noperational nuances and clarify expectations, as recommended.66    \n \nIn the previous reporting period, PDP executives reported that issues with linen exchange had \nbeen identified and corrected.67  However, members of the Monitoring Team personally \ninspected the cells of some reporting Class Members’ and confirmed the presence of only one set \nof outer wear.  When these types of reports persist with this frequency across housing units \nsystemwide, it is inconceivable that leadership would not take immediate steps to verify and, if \nnecessary, address them. \n \nDespite these issues, PDP has also made improvements in this reporting period.  Consistent with \nthe Monitoring Team’s recommendation, PDP procured and began issuing underclothing to \nClass Members at intake.68  Meeting the needs of the entire population will require additional \norders of large quantities of undergarments, but PDP is making progress in this area.  PDP also \nimplemented the Monitoring Team’s recommendation to revise its policy for issuing blankets \nand cold weather clothing.  Rather than issuing these items on the same date each year, they are \nnow issued based on weather forecasts and the outside temperature, which are more appropriate \nmeasures.   \n \nDefendants should immediately consider the following recommendations: \n   \n1.  PDP should modify schedules to increase the frequency of deep cleaning rounds.   \n2.  PDP should provide Class Members with secure, rodent-proof containers for their \nbelongings. \n3.  PDP should procure sufficient undergarments to meet the needs of all Class Members.        \n4.  PDP jail managers should conduct thorough assessments in every facility to identify \nspecific deficiencies in the areas of general sanitation and vector control, clothing and \nlinen exchange, and issuance of hygiene supplies.   \n \n65 Monitor’s Second Report, supra note 6, at 59.  \n66 Ibid. \n67 Ibid.  \n68 Id. at 60. \n  63 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 65 of 69\n5.  PDP should revise its post orders to reflect operational nuances at each facility.  Post \norders should account for the needs of unique populations, such as women, youth, and \nthose navigating mental illness or other disabilities. \n6.  PDP executives and facility leadership should develop plans to increase guidance for unit \npersonnel in meeting expectations for general sanitation and vector control, clothing and \nlinen exchange, and the issuance of cleaning and hygiene supplies.  Plans should include \neffective monitoring via audits, or other modes of verification, and specific \nacknowledgement of personnel who meet expectations and support or discipline, as \nappropriate, of those who do not.  \nSubstantive Provision 18—Use-of-Force \n \nPDP policies and training address correctional staff’s use of force, use of pepper spray, de-\nescalation measures, and an incarcerated person’s non-compliance with verbal commands.  The \nparties agree that correctional officers should follow de-escalation measures provided in PDP \npolicies.  The Monitor shall review these issues and make recommendations based on a review of \nall relevant material and factors.  In the interim, PDP shall advise and re-train correctional \nofficers on the proper application of the Use of Force and Restraints Policy, 3.A.8, and with \nrespect to de-escalation requirements in accordance with the PDP policy which in part states: \n“Force is only used when necessary and only to the degree required to control the inmate(s) or \nrestore order…The use of pepper spray is justifiable when the Officer’s presence and verbal \ncommand options have been exhausted and the inmate remains non-compliant or the inmate’s \nlevel of resistance has escalated….  Staff will not use pepper spray as a means of punishment, \npersonal abuse, or harassment.” \n \nCompliance Rating:  Partial Compliance \n \nAs previously reported, PDP’s use of force policy is too permissive and lacks clarity.69  It \nemphasizes de-escalation as quoted in this substantive provision but ultimately authorizes use of \nforce for failure to follow verbal commands without accompanying active resistance or \nassaultive behavior.  It is also unclear regarding: (1) when force is authorized for passive \nresistance; (2) protocols for pre-planned versus emergency force; (3) the role of behavioral \nhealth in de-escalation; (4) duty to intervene; and (5) duty to report excessive or unnecessary \nforce, among other issues.  A review of sample use of force incidents in the previous reporting \nperiod revealed frequent violations of PDP’s existing policy, unnecessary and excessive uses of \nforce, inadequate use of force reviews, and poor accountability.70   \n \nPDP's current use of force review practices includes reviews of all use of force incidents in PDP \nfacilities by supervising lieutenants, deputy wardens, and wardens.  More complex cases, or \ncases with serious injuries, are reviewed by deputy commissioners and, at times, the \nCommissioner.  At the time of SME McDonald’s review, all 24 incidents had completed the \nfacility command level of review required of all use of force incidents.  The majority of reviews \nfailed to identify the need for higher levels of review or additional investigation, reporting, \n \n69 Id. at 61-62.  \n70 See Id. at 61-64.  \n  64 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 66 of 69\ntraining, and/or accountability in every case.  Some of the incidents reviewed had reached PDP’s \nexecutive-level review, during which some additional issues were identified and addressed.  \nHowever, serious issues were missed at every completed level of review in all 24 cases.   \n \nBased on these findings, the Commissioner prioritized improving PDP’s use of force review \nprocess in this reporting period.  Larger revisions and updates to PDP’s use of force and \ndiscipline policies will require many months of planning and negotiations to complete.  \nImplementation of any revisions made will not be successful until PDP is able to reduce security \nstaff vacancies.  Ultimately, correcting PDP’s use of force deficiencies requires dramatic cultural \nredirection of personnel at every rank in PDP’s security chain of command.  It requires systems \nfor intensive supervision, instruction, mentorship, support, incentives, and rigid accountability \nthat PDP does not currently possess the capacity to execute.   \n \nDespite these barriers, PDP made progress in this reporting period consistent with the  \nMonitoring Team’s recommendations, including:   \n \n•  On April 27, 2023, the Commissioner issued a memorandum to all staff reiterating her \nexpectations for de-escalation wherever possible and personnel duties to summon a \nsupervisor, intercede if a colleague appears to be acting outside of policy during an \nincident, and accurately report all uses of force.  With this memorandum, the \nCommissioner also established a zero-tolerance policy for abuse and failure to report \nabuse, which should be incorporated into policy. \n•  In May 2023, as a temporary measure until the recommended use of force review team \ncould be established, PDP leadership assigned a small team to review available CCTV of \nall use of force incidents shortly after they occurred.  The goal of the initial reviews was \nto determine whether significant policy violations occurred that required immediate \nintervention, rather than waiting for completion of the lengthy use of force review \nprocess.  In consultation with SME McDonald, the team began reviewing cases and \ndeveloped a system to capture details from incidents going back to January 1, 2023.   \nInformation tracked from the team’s initial reviews informed the creation of a formal use \nof force review team and associated policy. \n•  In June 2023, PDP executives, wardens, and deputy wardens met with SME McDonald to \ncomplete CCTV review of select use of force incidents that occurred in January and \nFebruary 2023.  Discussed in more detail below, the goal of the meeting, and other \nsimilar meetings in this reporting period, was to build internal capacity for critical \nevaluation of use of force incidents, including identifying cases that require referrals for \nadministrative or criminal investigation.     \n•  On July 1, 2023, PDP began piloting new use of force review forms at RCF, with the goal \nof revising PDP’s use of force review policy and initiating associated training in the next \nreporting period.   \n•  In August 2023, the Commissioner issued Executive Order 23-03:  Use of Force Review \nTeam (UFRT).  The UFRT assumed responsibility for CCTV review following use of \nforce incidents and monitoring the quality of PDP’s use of force review process.  The \nUFRT was established by redirecting one captain and two lieutenants, and creating one \nnew analyst position.  PDP recognizes the UFRT requires additional staff to implement \nall recommendations for training, policy updates, and other tasks.  However, UFRT will \n  65 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 67 of 69\nbegin by reviewing designated incidents, managing the force review process, tracking \ntrends, and specifying training needs, which will support change and help identify \nspecific resources needed to implement recommendations from this and prior reports. \n•  PDP has committed to CCTV upgrades, including converting PDP facilities to a single \ncentralized camera system with limited expansion to address gaps in coverage.  Planned \nupgrades will not include audio recording, and it is unclear whether conversion to a \nsingle camera system will fully address server capacity issues that limit remote \nmonitoring, such as those discussed above under Substantive Provision 11–PICC \nEmergency Call Systems.   \n  \nWith the goal of supporting PDP’s efforts to improve its use of force review process, SME \nMcDonald selected 46 completed use of force packages, including available CCTV footage and \ncompleted force investigations, for review and detailed discussions with PDP leadership.  Cases \nwere selected from January and February 2023.  At the time of the review, all reports and chain-\nof-command reviews were completed.  Any referrals for internal administrative or criminal \ninvestigation of formal discipline would have been issued as part of completed reviews.  Specific \ncases from this sample were analyzed in detail with PDP’s jail and executive leadership teams, \nand post-incident reviews at all levels were critiqued.   \n \nThe quality of completed force packages reviewed by SME McDonald in this reporting period \ncontained similar weaknesses to those reviewed in the previous reporting period.71  Some \npackages were incomplete, missing investigative reports or witness statements, or lacked \ncomplete accounts or statements of Class Members, among other issues that should have been \nidentified during the multiple layers of review.   \n \nAll 46, or 100 percent, of use of force incidents warranted additional training for personnel, and \nseveral should have spurred additional investigation into personnel conduct, including potential \nexcessive or unnecessary force.  PDP’s use of force review process identified issues in only 5 of \n46, or 11 percent, of incidents reviewed.  Sample cases contained inappropriate deployment of \nOC spray and failures to follow decontamination protocols that were not identified by reviewers.  \nThey contained significant deviations from standards for basic correctional controls during \ndisturbances that were not identified in reviews despite dangers to Class Members and staff. \nVirtually every staff use of force report was substandard, yet none were returned for clarification \nas is the norm with effective force reviews.   \n \nThe following examples are among those addressed with PDP use of force leadership and \nreviewers:  \n \n•  In an intake unit, a Class Member patient experiencing a mental health crisis is seen \nsmearing feces in a cell.  There is no evidence that medical or mental health staff were \nrequested to assess the patient or assist security in devising a plan.  Instead, a cell \nextraction is initiated and OC spray is deployed under the cell door.  Staff do not \nmaintain a constant presence at cell front to observe, communicate with or encourage the \nClass Member to comply with commands.  Eight minutes later, a second round of OC is \n \n71 Ibid.  \n  66 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 68 of 69\ndeployed, again without communication or direction from staff.  No medical personnel \nare standing by and the Class Member is not removed from the cell for more than 30 \nminutes following the first OC deployment.  Staff neither observe nor record the Class \nMember’s responses for the incident’s duration.  Once removed from the cell, the Class \nMember is not decontaminated or evaluated by medical staff prior to being placed in a \nsafety cell with no running water.  The body weight resistance and positioning of the \nClass Member during placement into the safety cell risked positional asphyxia, yet none \nof the supervisors present throughout the incident interceded with quality direction.  The \npoor tactics, absence of clinical care, and failure to decontaminate are not addressed in \nany of the reviews. \n•  In a housing unit, a sergeant responds with additional staff to address a Class Member \nwho is refusing to enter a cell.  The sergeant uses a significant quantity of OC spray, fully \nexpending his assigned OC canister and then orders another officer to deploy additional \nOC.  The sergeant authors a report that reflects deployment of “a short burst” of OC \ndespite CCTV and the Class Member’s clothing clearly depicting that a significant \namount of OC was deployed to the Class Member’s head area.  Five additional \nresponding staff who were present throughout the incident all author identical reports \ncontaining the same language.  The review failed to address likely over-deployment of \nOC, discrepancies between CCTV and staff accounts, and the authoring of “canned” \nreports. \n•  In a housing unit, an officer deployed OC spray and authored a report stating force was \nnecessary to stop the Class Member from attacking another “unknown” person.  The \ncorresponding incident report notes the reason for OC deployment as, “IP refusing to \nrecall to [IP’s] cell.”  The video file that would have depicted the event was unavailable, \nand the other camera angles did not depict actions that corroborated the officer’s \nstatement.  Post-force, the involved officer is observed escorting the Class Member by \nthe collar of the Class Member’s clothing, an inappropriate practice.  The review does not \nidentify or address these concerns. \n•  In an intake area, a Class Member refused to undress for processing.  A sergeant \nresponded and ordered the deployment of OC spray.  No medical or mental health \nprofessionals were requested to assist pre-force or during the OC deployment.  After the \nClass Member was restrained and decontaminated, staff are seen on CCTV \ninappropriately forcing the Class Member’s head into position for a photograph and then \npulling the Class Member’s clothing during an unprofessional escort.  These issues were \nnot addressed in the review.   \n•  In a housing unit, an officer begins to recall a unit of Class Members to their cells.  When \none Class Member blocks the cell door with his foot, the officer kicks the Class Member, \nwho then exits the cell.  The officer loses control of the unit but is not carrying a radio to \nrequest assistance and does not retreat while awaiting backup, as would be tactically \nappropriate.  The officer is then observed shoving a second Class Member into a cell and \nslapping food trays out of a third Class Member’s hands.  The officer deploys OC spray \non a fourth Class Member who then chases the officer up the housing unit stairs, hitting \nthe officer in the head from behind.  This assault might have been prevented by a second \n  67 \n      \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 193   Filed 10/12/23   Page 69 of 69\nofficer who should have controlled the Class Member post-OC deployment.  Responding \nstaff then took the first Class Member to the floor, but failed to regain control of the \nhousing unit.  The facility warden appropriately requested additional information and \nreview of this incident, yet many clear issues were missed in earlier reviews. \n \nAll use of force issues regarding tactics, safety, investigations, reporting, and reviews discussed \nin previous reports were present in cases reviewed in this reporting period and will not be \nrestated here.72  The Monitoring Team reemphasizes two issues in this reporting period that PDP \nhas committed to address.  First, some staff use more force than others, perhaps as a function of \ntheir post assignments.  However, PDP does not have an early warning system that flags these \npersonnel for additional review and support if necessary.  For example, one officer from the 46 \ncases reviewed failed to use appropriate de-escalation tactics in every use of force incident the \nofficer was involved in.  This officer is assigned to a high stress environment, which can easily \nlead to frustration, poor tactics, and decision making.  An early warning system would have \nflagged this officer for additional support in managing the stress of the officer’s assignment and \npotentially prevented future uses of force.  PDP has committed to implementing the Monitoring \nTeam’s recommendation to procure an early warning system. \n   \nSecond, PDP’s current camera system is inadequate for use of force review.  In the best \ncircumstances with the most advanced technology, use of force review is time consuming.  \nBecause PDP does not have a centralized camera system, incidents from PICC and RCF must be \ndownloaded and copied using separate software systems.  Server capacity is limited, so video \nstorage is insufficient and frames per second are too low, which causes skipping and missed \nfootage.  PDP facilities, especially RCF, have many areas where camera placement leaves gaps \nin coverage, or incidents may occur too far away from fixed cameras to properly assess them.  \nFinally, PDP’s system does not have audio, so statements and other context for use of force \nincidents are missing in most cases.  Audio is particularly important when incidents involve \nconflicting statements or information.  SME McDonald also notes that in 40 to 50 percent of \nincidents reviewed, available video footage fails to capture actions of Class Members and staff to \nallow for proper evaluation of incidents.  In addition to upgrading PDP’s CCTV system, PDP \nreports that it is researching the feasibility of implementing a body worn camera pilot program.   \n \nIt is important to acknowledge two recently completed use of force reviews that illustrate \nsupervisors’ willingness to address policy violations and training issues directly and \nunapologetically.  These supervisors, and others like them, should be commended and perhaps \nconsidered for roles in use of force policy development and revisions.  Additionally, in this \nreporting period, PICC improved its process for ensuring that all involved and witness personnel \nsubmit reports.  PICC’s force packages have improved as a result.   \n \nIncidents reviewed in this reporting period occurred prior to improvements reported above, \nincluding the Commissioner’s April directive and the creation of the UFRT.  Reviews in the next \nreporting period should begin to reveal any progress as a result of these changes. \n \n72 Ibid.  \n  68 \n      ",

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated \nindividuals who are incarcerated in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (“PDP”), alleging \nthat Defendants failed to provide humane conditions and protections against COVID-19 in the \nPhiladelphia jail system in violation of the United States Constitution and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.  Defendants City of Philadelphia and Commissioner Blanche Carney \n(collectively the “City”) have denied these allegations throughout the litigation.   \nThe Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement,” “Settlement,” or “Agreement,” \nattached hereto as Exhibit A), if approved by the Court, will resolve all claims in this matter. \nThe parties’ proposed Notice to the Class (“Notice,” attached hereto as Exhibit B) informed the \nclass members of the Agreement and gave them an opportunity to voice any objections. The \nparties respectfully request that the Court find that the Agreement meets the standards for \napproval of a class action settlement and grant final approval. \n  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 6 of 21\nII.  BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiffs initiated this class action on April 20, 2020, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the \nUnited States Constitution, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, seeking to compel \nDefendants City of Philadelphia and Commissioner Blanche Carney to protect individuals \nincarcerated in the PDP from the risks of serious harm they faced from the twin dangers of \nCOVID-19 and prolonged isolation in their cells.  (See ECF No. 1).  Plaintiffs filed a Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, seeking an order requiring the City to \nprovide humane conditions of confinement in PDP facilities, with a focus on COVID-19 \nprotections and adequate out-of-cell time due to lockdown conditions.  (ECF No. 18).  \nDefendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs’ application for injunctive relief, contending \nthat PDP’s actions were consistent with CDC guidance.  (ECF No. 22).  The parties reached a \npartial settlement agreement, which was approved by the Court and entered as a Consent Order \non Partial Settlement Agreement on June 3, 2020.  (ECF No. 35).   \nThereafter, over the course of nearly two years, the Court held biweekly status \nconferences, and the parties submitted status reports, declarations from incarcerated people, \ncertifications from prison staff, and information relating to COVID-19 infection and vaccination \nrates.  Plaintiffs alleged that the conditions at PDP continued to violate their constitutional rights \nand that staffing shortages (affected by both a lack of employees and absenteeism) caused these \nconditions.  Defendants have denied that the jail conditions, policies, and protocols were \nunconstitutional or unlawful, and have maintained that incarcerated people in PDP were \nadequately protected from COVID-19.  The Court issued a series of interim orders on matters \nsuch as mandatory COVID-19 testing, increased out-of-cell time, and a return to pre-pandemic \nprogramming, among other things.  (See ECF Nos. 35, 55, 58, 59, 62, 70, 74, 92, 93).  Plaintiffs \nfiled two motions for contempt during the case (see ECF Nos. 71, 113), both of which were \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 7 of 21\nresolved through settlement.  Defendants also filed a motion to vacate the Court’s September \n14, 2021 Order under the PLRA, which was, with Plaintiffs’ second motion for contempt, also \nresolved through settlement.  (See ECF No. 118.) \nMore recently, Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint (ECF No. 147), a third \namended Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. 125), and a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction (ECF No. 128).  In response, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, an opposition to \nclass certification, and an opposition to the application for injunctive relief.  (ECF Nos. 148, \n139, 138).  On March 11, 2022, the Court certified this case to proceed as a class action.  (ECF \nNos. 152, 153).  Defendants sought permission to appeal the Court’s class certification order on \nMarch 25, 2021.  \nWhile these motions were pending, the parties entered into arms-length settlement \nnegotiations, as a result of which the parties have executed a global Settlement Agreement.  \nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the City will: (1) implement measures to enhance the hiring \nand retention of correctional officers; (2) provide minimum amounts of out-of-cell time on a \nschedule with presumptive increases; (3) continue to increase capacity for in-person visits by \nfamily and friends, and in conjunction with Plaintiffs and a Court-appointed Monitor, develop a \nplan for return to pre-pandemic programming; (4) continue to ensure adequate and timely \nmedical and mental health treatment along with mental health programming, with benchmarks \nin reducing backlogs for medical appointments; (5) ensure compliance with individuals’ due \nprocess rights at disciplinary hearings; (6) continue the expansion of phone and tablet access for \nincarcerated people; (7) continue the implementation of a lock replacement program and \nimplement refresher training on the emergency call button system; (8) continue to follow \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 8 of 21\nCOVID-19-related protocols to ensure individuals are available for court and for meetings with \nattorneys; and (9) provide refresher training on the PDP’s use of force policy.   \nThe Settlement Agreement also provided for the appointment of a Monitor to assist the \nCourt and the parties in implementing the Agreement and Order, and in the formulation of any \nfuture order(s) as necessary, for a period of two years.  The parties submitted, and the Court \napproved, a protocol detailing the role and functions of the Monitor which will include issues of \naccess to documents, reports, data, PDP personnel, and the PDP facilities, and the ability to \nreceive information from class members, while respecting the safety, security, and privilege \nconcerns of the PDP.  The parties recommended, and the Court approved, the appointment of \nCathleen Beltz as the Monitor.  (ECF No. 169). \nImportantly, the Agreement also (1) addresses standards for relief under the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act, (2) states that the Defendants, by this Agreement, do not admit any fact \nor legal liability, or unlawful conduct, (3) provides for negotiated counsel fees and costs, (4) \nincludes a release of the claims by Plaintiffs made in the Third Amended Complaint, and (5) \nsets termination dates and a process for enforcement, if necessary. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), the settlement of a class action requires \napproval of the Court.  This is a two-step process: first, the Court considers a motion for \npreliminary approval to ensure that no obvious problems exist with the settlement and to \nevaluate the parties’ proposed plan for notifying class members; and, second, the Court \nconsiders a motion for final approval, after the class members have had the opportunity to \nreceive notice and voice any objections.  See Harlan v. Transworld Sys., 302 F.R.D. 319, 324 \n  4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 9 of 21\n(E.D. Pa. 2014).  The standard for granting final approval of a class action settlement is set forth \nin Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d 153 (3d Cir. 1975) and In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice \nLitig. Agent Actions, 278 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 2002), which are discussed below. \nB.  THE NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS WAS ADEQUATE \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires some form of notice of the settlement to \nclass members.  The trial court has broad discretion in determining the timing and manner of the \nnotice.  Harris v. Reeves, 761 F. Supp. 382, 393 (E.D. Pa. 1991).  In class actions involving \nprisons and other institutions, it is frequently impractical to provide individual notice to class \nmembers.  See id.  Instead, posting a notice at the institution is often the best way to inform \nclass members of a pending settlement agreement.  See id; see also Woods v. Marler, No. 17-\n4443, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170225, at *4-5 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 24, 2018) (approving class action \nsettlement where pretrial detainees at the Federal Detention Center sought policies that would \npermit visitation by their minor children, noting the notice posted to the class permitted class \nmembers an opportunity to object); Pastrana v. Lane, No. 08-468, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n23737, at *3, *5 n.4, 10 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 24, 2012) (noting that the court ordered a notice to be \nposted in the housing units to inform halfway house residents about a class action settlement); \nInmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison v. Reish, No. 08-345, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46600, at \n*4-5 (M.D. Pa. April 29, 2011).   \nHere, notice was provided to the class by posting the Notice in all housing areas at PDP, \nat the law libraries in PDP, and on the PDP electronic communications systems (e.g., tablets).  \nSee Exhibit C.  Plaintiffs’ counsel provided copies of the Agreement upon request.  \n \n \n  5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 10 of 21\nC.  THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS FAIR, REASONABLE, AND ADEQUATE \nThe Settlement Agreement meets the standards for final approval.  Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(e) provides that “claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled, \nvoluntarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s approval.”  Prior to final approval, \nRule 23(e) directs that the following procedures apply to a proposed settlement:   \n(1)  The court must provide direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members \nwho would be bound by the proposal. \n(2)  If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a \nhearing and on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n(3)  The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement \nmade in connection with the proposal. \n. . . \n(5)  Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under \nthis subdivision (3); the objection may be withdrawn only with the court’s \napproval. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). \nFinal approval of a class action settlement requires a finding by the Court that the \nsettlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  Ehreart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 592 \n(3d Cir. 2010).  In Girsh, the Third Circuit outlined nine factors for district courts to consider \nwhen determining whether a settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  The factors are:  (1) \nthe complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the \nsettlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks \nof establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the \nclass action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; \n(8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; (9) \nthe range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the \nattendant risks of litigation. Girsh, 521 F.2d at 157 (quoting City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., \n  6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 11 of 21\n495 F.2d 448, 463 (2d Cir. 1974)) (alterations omitted); see also In re NFL Players Concussion \nInjury Litig., 821 F.3d 410, 437 (3d Cir. 2016) (applying Girsh and Prudential factors). \nSubsequently, in In re Prudential Ins. Co., the Third Circuit expanded the criteria in \nassessing a proposed settlement by including the following factors, when appropriate: \n[T]he  maturity  of  the  underlying  substantive  issues,  as  measured  by \nexperience in adjudicating individual actions, the development of scientific \nknowledge, the extent of discovery on the merits, and other factors that bear \non the ability to assess the probable outcome of a trial on the merits of \nliability and individual damages; the existence and probable outcome of \nclaims by other classes and subclasses; the comparison between the results \nachieved by the settlement for individual class or subclass members and the \nresults achieved—or likely to be achieved—for other claimants; whether \nclass or subclass members are accorded the right to opt out of the settlement; \nwhether any provisions for attorneys’ fees are reasonable; and whether the \nprocedure for processing individual claims under the settlement is fair and \nreasonable. \n148 F.3d at 323; see also In re Pet Food Products Liability Litig., 629 F.3d 333, 350-51 (2010). \n1.  The Girsh Factors Weigh In Favor Of Settlement Approval \na.  The complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation \nThe first Girsh factor weighs in favor of settlement approval.  This litigation involves the \nPDP’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and alleged inhumane conditions at the \nPhiladelphia jails arising from a lack of staffing and other complicating factors.  Courts have \nfound litigation addressing policies and procedures at other prisons and jails to be sufficiently \ncomplex to weigh in favor of settlement approval. See, e.g., Woods, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n170225, at *4 at n.3; Williams v. City of Philadelphia, No. 08-1979, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n87467, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 8, 2011); Inmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison, 2011 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 46600, at *2. \nThe litigation commenced over two years ago at the beginning of the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Since then, the parties have engaged in significant informal and formal discovery, \n  7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 12 of 21\nincluding Defendants providing weekly reports on a variety of data, document production, and a \ndeposition of PDP’s chief of medical operations.  Were the claims in this case to proceed, the \nparties would be required to conduct full-blown merits discovery.  Further, the size of the class, \nthe underlying claims addressing complex issues including medical care, and the extent of \ninjunctive relief sought all contribute to the complexity of the case.  Proving the \nunconstitutionality of the practices at issue here would be complex and expensive, requiring \nexpert witnesses.  Therefore, the first factor weighs in favor of settlement approval. \nb.  The reaction of the class to the settlement \nThe Motion for Preliminary Approval of the settlement was filed on April 12, 2022 (ECF \nNo. 165).  Class members were instructed to mail any objections to Plaintiffs’ counsel or \nDefendants’ counsel.  As of June 15, 2022, 4,114 people were incarcerated in PDP facilities.  A \ntotal of 56 class members sent letters concerning the Settlement.  Individuals incarcerated at \nCurran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (“CFCF”) sent most of the individual letters, while one \nletter was sent from an individual housed at Alternative and Special Detention Unit – Central \nUnit (“ASDCU”) on behalf of 20 other incarcerated people, who co-signed the letter.  \nIndividuals from all PDP facilities sent letters: Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center \n(“PICC”), Riverside Correctional Facility (“RCF”), the Detention Center (“DC”), CFCF, \nASDCU, and Mod-3.  See Exhibit D (listing the number of individuals from each facility who \nsubmitted comments or objections and the topics of their comments or objections). \nMany letters addressed what the authors asserted were the ongoing state of disrepair and \nunlivable conditions inside PDP facilities.  Most of the letters, while not explicitly about the \nSettlement Agreement, addressed conditions that the Agreement is designed to ameliorate.  For \nexample, one individual housed at RCF asserted that two tablets—which are “never fully” \n  8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 13 of 21\ncharged— are the only tablets available for the entire facility.  This lack of access leads to \nviolence, because, in the words of this individual, “it’s like throwing a ‘steak’ in a cage full of \nhungry dogs, they’re going to fight for it.”  This issue is specifically addressed in the Settlement \nAgreement.  (ECF No. 165-2 at 2).  Another individual at CFCF shared concerns over staffing, \nexplaining that inadequate staffing is a persistent issue and that it leaves him and others feeling \n“helpless.”  This issue is also addressed by the Agreement.  (ECF No. 165-2 at 1).  \nVery few individuals raised specific objections to the Settlement.  One individual felt that \nthe settlement was “anti-climactic” and “void of accountability,” and that litigation could achieve \nlonger-lasting change at PDP.  Another incarcerated individual at PICC raised objections that are \naddressed by the Agreement—including objections regarding tablet access and call button \nremediations—but objected more generally to the lack of monetary damages.  Finally, one more \nindividual raised an objection regarding access to the law library, an issue that is also included in \nthe Agreement.  \nIt is significant that only 56 incarcerated individuals submitted objections or comments of \nany nature.  A low number of objectors compared to the potential number of class members \ncreates a strong presumption in favor of approving the settlement.  See In re Cendant Corp. \nLitig., 264 F.3d 201, 234-35 (3d Cir. 2001); see also Inmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison, \n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46600, at *9 (approving settlement where four comments were received \nout of 200 prisoners in the class and where none of the four objected to the terms of the \nsettlement); Boone v. City of Philadelphia, 668 F. Supp. 2d 693, 712 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (approving \nsettlement where 3 formal objections were received from a potential class of 37,000).   \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ counsel received at least one letter expressing support for the \nagreement.  An individual who is housed at CFCF wrote that, “the settlement agreement is fair to \n  9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 14 of 21\nall that deserve [sic].”  Although not all the letters explicitly stated support for the settlement \nterms, the majority expressed general appreciation for, and belief in, the work that Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel have done and are doing, in this case.   \nc.   The stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed \nThis factor focuses upon the case development prior to the creation of a settlement \nagreement as a way for courts to examine the thoroughness of counsel’s evaluation of the merits \nof a claim.  In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 235.  The parties engaged in significant \ninformal discovery and formal discovery tied to the hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction prior to the commencement of settlement negotiations.  Post-discovery settlements are \nmore likely to be sufficiently informed about the fairness of a settlement.  Boone, 668 F. Supp. \n2d at 712.  Here, the discovery process was extensive, including the weekly exchange of \ndocuments for over a year, formal discovery resulting in the exchange of hundreds more \ndocuments, an expert report, and the deposition of a PDP medical official.  \nMotion practice can also highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the case facts and \narguments.  See Pack v. Beyer, No. 91-3709, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19542, at *9 (D.N.J. Dec. \n22, 1995).  In this case, motions to dismiss, motions for class certification, and motions for \npreliminary injunctions, were filed and responded to, further highlighting the key issues in the \nlawsuit.  The depth of discovery and motion practice, combined with the protracted pretrial stage \nof these proceedings, demonstrates a well-informed decision to settle this action.  Final approval \nof the Settlement Agreement would also save the expense of a trial.  Courts have held that cost \nsavings weigh in favor of settlement approval.  See Austin v. Penn. Dept. of Corr., 876 F. Supp. \n1437, 1470-71 (E.D. Pa. 1995).  \n  10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 15 of 21\nFinally, courts have recognized that,\"[t]he professional judgment of counsel involved in \nthe litigation is entitled to significant weight.\" Fisher Bros. v. Cambridge-Lee Industries, Inc., \n630 F. Supp. 482, 488 (E.D. Pa. 1985). The post-discovery stage of the proceedings, the \nsignificant economic impact of moving forward with trial, and the two-year pretrial litigation that \nhas already occurred, all support final approval of the Settlement Agreement. \nd.  The risks of establishing liability \nThe risks of liability also weigh in favor of approval, though less strongly than other \nfactors.  Like many prison civil rights cases that focus on conditions of confinement, this case \ninvolves uncertainty as to the relief to which the class would be entitled.  In this context, courts \nhave found an increased the risk for plaintiffs.  See, e.g. Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 710; \nDelandro, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55249, at *31.  As one court stated, “there is no assurance that \nthe relief would be greater or different than the relief provided” in the proposed agreement.  \nHarris v. Reeves, 761 F. Supp. 382, 401 (E.D. Pa. 1991).   \nDefendants also have reason to avoid the uncertainties of litigation.  If Plaintiffs \nsucceeded in establishing unconstitutional conditions, the Court would have significant \n“discretion regarding injunctive relief.”  See Harris v. Pernsley, 654 F. Supp. 1042, 1051 (E.D. \nPa. 1987).  By entering into the Settlement Agreement, Defendants have greater control in \ndetermining what terms they feel are most appropriate to manage PDP facilities.  Furthermore, if \nthe class were to prevail, attorneys’ fees awarded in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 1988 could \nsurpass the amount agreed upon.  See id. at 1052.  Thus, this factor weighs in favor of settlement \napproval. \n \n \n  11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 16 of 21\ne.  The risks of establishing damages \nPlaintiffs here do not seek damages on behalf of the class and instead seek solely \ninjunctive relief.  Nevertheless, the risks of “demonstrating the propriety of an injunction,” \nespecially an injunction of a larger scale addressing an entire institution, are large. Inmates of \nNorthumberland Cty. Prison, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46600, at *8; see also Williams, 2011 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 87467, at *14.  Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of approving the Settlement \nAgreement. \nf.  The risks of maintaining the class action through the trial \nThis factor is neutral, as, absent a decision by the Circuit on Defendant’s petition to \nappeal the class certification decision, there are no indications that the class could not be \nmaintained for the duration of the suit.  See Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d at 712.  Courts in this circuit \nhave continuously held that there is always some risk of decertification in any class action.  In re \nPrudential Ins., 148 F.3d at 321.  Due to this presumption, a risk of decertification that is not any \nmore substantial than the risk in any other class action does not weigh against settlement \napproval.  Boone, 668 F. Supp. at 712.  To the extent that the class is fluid, where individuals are \nentering and leaving the custody of PDP, that weighs in favor of settlement approval.  See \nInmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46600, at *9. \ng.  The seventh, eighth, and ninth Girsh factors do not apply  \nThis action was certified under Rule 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief.  The seventh, eighth, \nand ninth factors articulated in Girsh deal with monetary judgments and settlement funds and \ntherefore do not apply.  See Inmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n46600, at *9-10 (not applying these factors for a class action lawsuit with only injunctive relief \nclaims).  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 17 of 21\nTherefore, the totality of the Girsh factors weighs in favor of the Court’s approval of the \nSettlement Agreement. \n2.  The Prudential Factors Weigh In Favor Of Settlement Approval \nThis is a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief only.  Because the class \ndoes not seek damages, most of the factors set forth in Prudential do not apply.  See Williams, \n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87467, at *14.  The only relevant factor is the reasonableness of the \nprovision for attorneys’ fees.  Id.   \nThe parties have settled the claim for attorneys’ fees and costs at an amount of $340,000, \nwhich is fair and reasonable.  The Civil Rights Attorneys’ Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § \n1988, provides that prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to claim reasonable attorneys’ fees in civil \nrights cases, and “strong federal policy embodied in the Fees Act normally requires an award of \nfees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights actions, including those who have prevailed through \nsettlement.”  Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 724-25 (1986).  The “initial estimate of a reasonable \nattorneys’ fee is properly calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on \nthe litigation times a reasonable hourly rate.”  Id.  Even with attorney rates limited by the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act, the agreed-upon figure is a significant reduction in attorneys’ fees \ncompared to the fees that could be assessed through a fee petition due to the significant number \nof hours expended in the litigation.  This figure is also inclusive of costs.  The attorneys’ fees \nhere are comparable or are less than attorneys’ fees agreed upon and approved in other analogous \nclass action suits.  See, e.g., Inmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n46600 at *9 (approving class action settlement in prison litigation case and finding attorneys’ \nfees of $300,000 to be fair and reasonable).  Furthermore, the fact that attorneys’ fees would be \npaid to Plaintiffs’ counsel was disclosed to the class in the Agreement itself as well as in the \n  13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 18 of 21\nNotice.  Therefore, the Prudential factors point towards the approval of the Settlement \nAgreement. \n3.  The Settlement Agreement Is Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate \nThe Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Upon implementation, it will \nprovide relief to the approximately 4,100 people incarcerated in PDP facilities.  The Agreement \ndoes not provide preferential treatment; all members of the class will benefit equally from the \nchanges that this lawsuit has prompted.  Further, the terms of this agreement will prevent these \nconditions from arising again, benefiting people incarcerated in PDP in the future.  The lawsuit \nsought only injunctive relief, so the absence of monetary damages should not raise any concerns.  \nThe attorneys’ fees are reasonable and do not lessen the relief obtained by class members in any \nway.  \nTherefore, the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and should be approved.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court should grant final approval of the class action \nsettlement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 173   Filed 06/22/22   Page 19 of 21\nRespectfully submitted,   \n   \n/s/ Su Ming Yeh      /s/ David Rudovsky     \nSu Ming Yeh (PA 95111)  David Rudovsky (PA 15168) \n/s/ Matthew A.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated who are \nincarcerated in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons (PDP), alleging that Defendants failed to \nprovide humane conditions and protections against COVID-19 in the Philadelphia jail system in \nviolation of the United States Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Defendants \nCity of Philadelphia and Commissioner Blanche Carney (collectively the “City”) have denied \nthese allegations throughout the litigation.   \nThe Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement” or “Agreement,” attached as \nExhibit 1), if approved by the Court, will resolve all claims in this matter.  The parties’ proposed \nNotice to the Class (“Notice,” attached as Exhibit 2) will inform the class members of the \nAgreement and give them an opportunity to voice any objections.  The parties request that the \nCourt find that the Agreement and Notice meet the standards for approval of a class action \nsettlement and that the Court grant preliminary approval. \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 165   Filed 04/12/22   Page 5 of 12\nII.  BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs initiated this class action on April 20, 2020, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the \nUnited States Constitution, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, seeking to compel \nDefendants City of Philadelphia and Commissioner Blanche Carney to protect individuals \nincarcerated in the PDP from the risks of serious harm they face from the twin dangers of \nCOVID-19 and prolonged isolation in their cells.  (See ECF No. 1).  Plaintiffs filed a Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, seeking an order requiring the City to \nensure that humane conditions of confinement in PDP facilities, with a focus on COVID-19 \nprotections and adequate out-of-cell time due to lockdown conditions.  (ECF No. 18).  \nDefendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs’ application for injunctive relief, contending \nthat PDP was acting consistent with CDC guidance.  (ECF No. 22).  The parties reached a \npartial settlement agreement, which was approved by the Court and entered as a Consent Order \non Partial Settlement Agreement on June 3, 2020.  (ECF No. 35).   \nThereafter, over the course of two years, the Court held biweekly status conferences, and \nthe parties submitted status reports, declarations from incarcerated people, certifications from \nprison staff, and information relating to COVID-19 infection and vaccination rates.  Plaintiffs \nalleged that the conditions at PDP continued to violate their constitutional rights and that \nstaffing shortages (affected by the lack of employees along with absenteeism) caused these \nconditions.  Defendants have denied that the jail conditions, policies, and protocols were \nunconstitutional or unlawful, and have maintained that incarcerated people the PDP were \nadequately protected from COVID-19.  The Court issued several additional interim orders on \nmatters such as mandatory COVID-19 testing, increased out-of-cell time, return to pre-\npandemic programming, among other things.  (See ECF Nos. 35, 55, 58, 59, 62, 70, 74, 92, 93).  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 165   Filed 04/12/22   Page 6 of 12\nPlaintiffs filed two motions for contempt during the case (see ECF Nos. 71, 113), both of which \nwere resolved through settlement.  Defendants also filed a motion to vacate a prior Court order \nunder the PLRA, which motion was also resolved through settlement.  (See ECF No. 118.) \nMore recently, Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint (ECF No. 147), a third \namended Motion for Class Certification (see ECF No. 125), and a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction (ECF No. 128). In response, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, an opposition to \nclass certification, and an opposition to the application for injunctive relief. (ECF Nos. 148, 139, \n138). On March 11, 2022, the Court certified this case to proceed as a class action.  (ECF No. \n152-153).  Defendants appealed the Court’s class certification order on March 25, 2021.  \nWith these motions all pending, the parties entered into arms-length settlement \nnegotiations, as a result of which the parties have executed a Settlement Agreement. Under the \nterms of the Agreement, the City will: (1) implement measures to enhance the hiring and \nretention of correctional officers; (2) provide minimum times for out-of-cell time on a schedule \nwith presumptive increases; (3) continue to increase capacity for in-person visits by family and \nfriends, and in conjunction with Plaintiffs and a Court-appointed Monitor, develop a plan for \nreturn to pre-pandemic programming; (4) continue to ensure adequate and timely medical and \nmental health treatment along with mental health programming, with benchmarks in reducing \nbacklogs for medical appointments; (5) ensure compliance with individuals’ due process rights \nat disciplinary hearings; (6) continue the expansion of phone and tablet access for incarcerated \npeople; (7) continue the implementation of a lock replacement program and implement refresher \ntraining on the emergency call button system; (8) continue to follow Covid-19 related protocols \nto ensure individuals are available for court and for meetings with attorneys; and (9) provide \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 165   Filed 04/12/22   Page 7 of 12\nrefresher training on the policy applicable to deployment of pepper spray by correctional \nofficers.   \nThe Settlement Agreement also provides for the appointment of a Monitor to assist the \nCourt and the parties in implementing the Agreement and Order, and in the formulation of any \nfuture order(s) as necessary, for a period of two years.  The parties will submit to the Court for \nits consideration and approval a protocol detailing the role and functions of the Monitor which \nwill include issues of access to documents, reports, data, PDP personnel, and the PDP facilities, \nand the ability to receive information from class members, while respecting the safety, security, \nand privilege concerns of the PDP.  \nImportantly, the Agreement also (1) addresses standards for relief under the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act, (2) states that the Defendants, by this Agreement, do not admit any fact \nor legal liability, or unlawful conduct, (3) provides for counsel fees and costs, (4) includes a \nrelease of the claims by Plaintiffs made in the Third Amended Complaint, and (5) sets \ntermination dates and a process for enforcement, if necessary. \nIII.   LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), the settlement of a class action requires \napproval of the Court.  The Court first considers a motion for preliminary approval to evaluate \nthe parties’ proposed substantive agreement and to assess the plan for notifying class members. \nSecond, the Court considers a motion for final approval, after the class members have had the \nopportunity to receive notice and voice any objections.  See Harlan v. Transworld Sys., 302 \nF.R.D. 319, 324 (E.D. Pa. 2014).  In determining whether to grant preliminary approval of a \nclass action settlement, the Court should evaluate whether there are any obvious deficiencies \nthat would cast doubt on the proposed settlement’s fairness, whether the settlement negotiations \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 165   Filed 04/12/22   Page 8 of 12\noccurred at arm’s length, whether there was significant investigation of Plaintiffs’ claims, and \nwhether the proposed settlement provides preferential treatment to certain class members.  See \nSilvis v. Ambit Energy, L.P., No. 14-5005, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28392, at *16 (E.D. Pa. Feb. \n22, 2018). \nThe Settlement Agreement meets the standards for preliminary approval, as it is fair to \nboth sides and will improve conditions of confinement for the class members.  Further, the \nAgreement provides for the appointment of a Monitor to ensure compliance with the Agreement \nand any Court orders. \nSecond, the settlement negotiations occurred at arm’s length and after a substantial \nmotions practice and submissions to the Court.  The parties engaged in discovery through the \nexchange of documents, a deposition of the Medical Director at PDP, a tour and inspection of \nthe four jails in the PDP, and plaintiffs’ disclosure of a report from a retained expert.  Each side \nwas able to weigh the factual and legal risks of continuing with the litigation. \nThird, the settlement agreement does not provide preferential treatment, as all class \nmembers will benefit from the changes that this lawsuit has prompted.   \nThe attorneys’ fees and costs reflect prevailing rates and the standards under the PLRA, \nand they do not impact the relief obtained by class members. \nThe Agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and it should be approved. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires notice of the settlement to class members.  \nThe trial court has broad discretion in determining the timing and manner of the notice.  Harris \nv. Reeves, 761 F. Supp. 382, 393 (E.D. Pa. 1991).  In class actions involving prisons and other \ninstitutions, it is frequently impractical to provide individual notice to class members.  See id. at \n393.  Instead, posting a notice at the institution is usually the best way to inform class members \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-GAM   Document 165   Filed 04/12/22   Page 9 of 12\nof a pending settlement agreement.  See id.; see also Woods v. Marler, No. 17-4443, 2018 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 170225, at *4-5 (E.D. Pa. September 24, 2018) (approving class action settlement \nwhere pre-trial detainees at the Federal Detention Center sought policies that would permit \nvisitation by their minor children, noting the notice that was posted to the class that permitted \nclass members an opportunity to object); Pastrana v. Lane, 08-468, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n23737, at *3, 5 n.4, 10 (E.D. Pa. February 24, 2012) (noting that the court ordered a notice to be \nposted in the housing units to inform halfway house residents about a class action settlement); \nInmates of Northumberland Cty. Prison v. Reish, 08-cv-345, 2011 U.S. Dist LEXIS 46600, at \n*4-5 (M.D. Pa. April 29, 2011).   \nHere, notice to the class will be provided through the posting of a proposed Notice and \nthe Agreement in all housing areas at PDP, at the law libraries, and on the PDP electronic \ncommunication system (e.g., tablets), , and by plaintiffs’ counsel in response to requests for \nreview of the Agreement.  The Notices shall be made within one (1) week of the date of \npreliminary approval of the agreement.  Class members may be provided with a letter from \nPlaintiffs’ counsel explaining the Agreement, including the role of the Monitor. (See Exhibit 1 \nfor the Notice).   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed above, the Court should grant preliminary approval of the \nclass action settlement. \n \nRespectfully submitted,   \n   \n/s/ Su Ming Yeh      /s/ David Rudovsky     \nSu Ming Yeh (PA 95111)  David Rudovsky (PA 15168) \n/s/ Matthew A.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1.  Plaintiffs filed this class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, on April 20, 2020, to ensure that Defendants City of Philadelphia \n(“City”) and Commissioner Blanche Carney protect individuals incarcerated in the Philadelphia \nDepartment of Prisons (“PDP”) from the risks of serious harm they face from the twin dangers of \nCovid-19 and prolonged isolation in their cells. (See Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and \nInjunctive Relief and Petition for Writs of Habeas Corpus, ECF No. 1). \n2.  On April 23, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary  Injunction,  seeking  an  order  requiring  Defendants  to  ensure  that  conditions  of \nconfinement in PDP facilities comply with the health and safety standards necessary to protect the \nPlaintiff class from the risks associated with Covid-19 and to provide humane conditions of \nconfinement, including adequate out-of-cell time consistent with constitutional requirements. (See \nECF No. 18). \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 2 of 12\n3.  The parties reached a partial settlement agreement, which was approved by the \nCourt and entered as a Consent Order on Partial Settlement Agreement on June 3, 2020. (ECF No. \n35). \n4.  Along with various measures intended to mitigate the risks of harm from Covid-19 \nand ensure adequate access to counsel for members of the Plaintiff class, the Consent Order \nrequired Defendants to provide a minimum of 45 minutes of daily out-of-cell time for all \nindividuals incarcerated in PPD by June 10, 2020, and to make efforts to increase out-of-cell time \nthereafter, with Plaintiffs reserving the right to seek further relief from the Court regarding out-of-\ncell time, if necessary. (Id. ¶ 4(a)).  \n5.  During  the  summer  and  fall  of  2020,  Plaintiffs  consistently  reported  that \nDefendants were failing to comply with various terms of the Consent Order, including the \nrequirement of 45 minutes of daily out-of-cell time. Plaintiffs expressed their concerns—supported \nby declarations from incarcerated individuals—that the prolonged in-cell confinement to which \nincarcerated people were being subjected was leading to increased tension and adverse mental \nhealth consequences. (See Joint Status Reports, ECF Nos. 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 52, and accompanying \nexhibits).  \n6.  During this period, Defendants acknowledged on several occasions that not all \nincarcerated people in PDP custody were receiving the required 45 minutes of daily out-of-cell \ntime. (See Joint Status Reports, ECF Nos. 44, 45, 46, 48). \n7.  On or around December 5, 2020, in response to an increase in Covid-19 infections \namong incarcerated people, PDP instituted a “shelter-in-place” protocol for all facilities, under \nwhich incarcerated people were permitted out of their cells for at most 20 minutes a day, one cell \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 3 of 12\nat a time, to shower and use the phones. (See Joint Status Report of December 9, 2020, ECF No. \n53). \n8.  Plaintiffs filed multiple declarations with the Court documenting that incarcerated \npeople in some PDP facilities were not getting out of their cells each day under shelter-in-place \nand explaining the harms caused by the shelter-in-place protocol. (See Joint Status Report of \nDecember 24, 2019: Exhibit A, ECF No. 56-1; Joint Status Report of January 12, 2021: Exhibit \nB, ECF No. 61-2). \n9.  On January 13, 2021, based on the record of this case and submissions of the parties, \nthe  Court  entered  an  Interim  Order,  finding  that:  (a)  under  shelter-in-place,  incarcerated \nindividuals were not receiving the 45 minutes of daily out-of-cell time required by the Consent \nOrder; (b) it would be “feasible to permit persons from at least three cells out at a time, in 45-\nminute time frames, to separately shower, use phones, and engage in limited exercise, while still \nmaintaining social distancing”; and (c) “[t]he current shelter-in-place policy . . . keeps incarcerated \npeople in their cells for nearly 24 hours a day, and such prolonged confinement is harmful to the \nmental and physical health of incarcerated individuals.” (ECF No. 62). The Court again ordered \nDefendants to provide all individuals incarcerated in PDP facilities with a minimum of 45 minutes \nof daily out-of-cell time and stated that the Court would consider further orders on out-of-cell time \nafter then-pending universal Covid-19 testing was completed. (Id.). \n10.  On January 28, 2021, after the results of the universal Covid-19 testing were \nsubmitted to the Court, the Court ordered Defendants to increase out-of-cell time and provide all \nindividuals incarcerated in PDP with a minimum of two hours of daily out-of-cell time by February \n10, 2021, and a minimum of three hours of daily out-of-cell time by February 24, 2021, with \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 4 of 12\nexceptions made only for individuals on “a medically necessary quarantine” and when there exist \n“conditions imposed by operational emergencies.” (Order of January 28, 2021, ECF No. 63). \n11.  Defendants have consistently failed to comply with the Court’s Order of January \n28, 2021. The Court found on May 4, 2021 that: \nthere has been a pattern of noncompliance with the January 28, 2021 \nOrder, particularly in the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility. \nThough concentrated at CFCF, reports from class members at each \nof  the  PDP  facilities  that  they  have  regularly  been  denied  the \nrequired amount of out-of-cell time have been filed with the Court \non a regular basis…. The PDP Deputy Wardens (who have been \ndesignated as the City’s monitors for compliance, as required by \nOrder of the Court of December 18, 2020 (ECF No. 55)), and the \nCity, have also reported that staffing shortages and other emergent \nevents have impeded the ability of the facilities to meet or exceed \nthe three hours of recreation time…. [B]ased on a full review of the \nrecord, particularly the Deputy Wardens’ certifications, the \nCourt finds that Defendants have not complied with the Order \nof January 28, 2021.  \n  \n(Interim Order of May 4, 2021, ¶ 3, ECF No. 70) (emphasis added).  \n \n12.  In  addition  to  the  declarations  and  Deputy  Wardens’  certifications  that  have \npreviously been filed with the Court, recent developments provide further compelling evidence of \nDefendants’ noncompliance with the Order of January 28, 2021: \na.  Since the three-hour daily out-of-cell requirement took effect, Defendants, through \nthe Deputy Wardens, have  consistently admitted that there are many housing units \non which individuals have not received the required  out-of-cell time, particularly \nat CFCF. The number of units and facilities listed as noncompliant has steadily \nincreased and, in recent weeks, has included large portions of all four of the men’s \njails operated by PDP (which, together, house approximately 95% of individuals in \nPDP custody). See Exhibit A.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 5 of 12\nb.  On the evening of May 8, 2021, Defendants informed the Court that 64% of \ncorrections officers scheduled to work at CFCF failed to report to work, and that \nCFCF had been put on full lockdown.1 Defendants subsequently informed the Court \nthat the mass absenteeism event continued the next day and did not end until the \nmorning of May 10, 2021, at which point the lockdown at CFCF ended. \nc.  Declarations submitted along with this Motion confirm that Defendants are still \nfailing to provide the Court-ordered amount of out-of-cell time. See Exhibit B. \n13.  In its Interim Order of May 4, 2021, the Court “place[d] Defendants on notice that, \nabsent clear and convincing evidence that Defendants are in compliance with the Court’s Order, \nthe Court will entertain a motion for civil contempt by the Plaintiffs and will strongly consider the \nimposition of monetary sanctions against the Defendants.” (ECF No. 70, ¶ 7). \n14.  In its Interim Order of May 4, 2021, the Court also ordered the City to provide an \nupdate to the Court on the status of its negotiations with the Corrections Officers Union to address \nthe ongoing absenteeism crisis. (Id., ¶ 14). \n15.  During a telephonic status conference held on May 11, 2021, the City, through \ncounsel, informed the Court that no significant progress had been made in its discussions with the \nUnion. The City also informed the Court that its initial discussion with the Union occurred on May \n6, 2021 and was followed two days later by the massive absenteeism event described in paragraph \n12(c) above.  \n16.  Later  on  May  11,  2021,  counsel  for  the  City  advised  the  Court  that,  while \nnegotiations with the Union were continuing and proposals for resolving the disputes were under \n \n1 Defense counsel have informed Plaintiffs that during a “lockdown,” the only services that are \nprovided are food and medical care and that incarcerated individuals are not permitted out of their \ncells for showers, recreation, or phone calls. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 6 of 12\ndiscussion, there was no agreement, and that the City would again report on the status of the \nnegotiations by May 13, 2021. \nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  The Court should hold the City in civil contempt. \nThe Court should hold the City in civil contempt for failing to comply with the requirement \nin the Court’s Order of January 28, 2021 that all individuals incarcerated in PDP facilities be \nprovided with a daily minimum of three hours out of their cells. “There can be no question that \ncourts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt.” \nShillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966). Unlike criminal contempt, which is intended \nto punish the contemnor and vindicate the authority of the court, “the primary purpose of civil \ncontempt is remedial and for the benefit of the complainant.” Roe v. Operation Rescue, 920 F.2d \n213, 216 (3d Cir. 1990).2 “[I]f a person violates a court order requiring in specific and definite \nlanguage that that person do or refrain from doing an act or series of acts,” a finding of civil \ncontempt is appropriate. Cottman Transmissions Sys. v. Melody, 851 F. Supp. 675, 676 (E.D. Pa. \n1994). To hold a party in civil contempt, a court must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that \n(1) a valid court order existed, (2) the party had knowledge of the order, and (3) the party disobeyed \nthe order. John T. v. Del. Cty. Intermediate Unit, 318 F.3d 545, 552 (3d Cir. 2003). \n \n2 The two forms of contempt—civil and criminal—are distinguished by “the ‘character and \npurpose’ of the sanction involved.” Int’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. \n827, 829 (1994) (quoting Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 441 (1911); see \nalso United States v. Pozsgai, 999 F.2d 719, 735 (3d Cir. 1993) (“The purpose and nature of the \nsanction, rather than the label attached to it, determine whether it is civil or criminal.”). Because \ncriminal contempt “is a crime in the ordinary sense,” criminal contempt sanctions can only be \nimposed on a party who has been afforded all the protections that the Constitution requires of \ncriminal proceedings. Int’l Union, 512 U.S. at 826–27. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 7 of 12\nIt is the fact of a party’s failure to comply with a court order—not the party’s state of \nmind—that makes civil contempt appropriate. See Robin Woods Inc. v. Woods, 28 F.3d 396, 399 \n(3d Cir. 1994) (holding that “willfulness is not a necessary element of civil contempt”). “[G]ood \nfaith is not a defense to civil contempt.” Id.; see also Harley-Davidson, Inc. v. Morris, 19 F.3d \n142, 148–49 (3d Cir. 1994) (“Willfulness is not a necessary element of civil contempt. . . . \nAccordingly, evidence . . . regarding . . . good faith does not bar the conclusion . . . that [the \ndefendant] acted in contempt.”).  \nNor  is  impossibility  a  defense  to  civil  contempt—unless  the  alleged  contemnor \ndemonstrates that compliance is “a physical impossibility beyond the[ir] control.” FTC v. Lane \nLabs-USA, 624 F.3d 575, 590 (3d Cir. 2010). To successfully invoke an impossibility defense, the \nalleged contemnor must demonstrate that “compliance is . . . factually impossible.” Id. Compliance \nis factually impossible where, for example, an alleged contemnor is not in possession or control of \ndocuments they have been ordered to produce, see, e.g., id., or demonstrates a financial inability \nto comply with an order to pay sanctions. See, e.g., Egnotovich v. Greenfield Twp. Sewer Auth., \n378 F. App’x 121, 123 (3d Cir. 2010). An alleged contemnor asserting an impossibility defense \nmust “show that it has made . . . all reasonable efforts to comply.” Harris v. City of Philadelphia, \n47 F.3d 1311, 1324 (3d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis \nadded). Neither the high cost nor impracticability of compliance qualifies as impossibility. See id. \nat  1324–25  (rejecting  impossibility  defense  where  compliance  might  have  been  costly  and \nimpractical but was still possible); see also Inmates of Allegheny Cty. Jail v. Wecht, 874 F.2d 147, \n152 (3d Cir. 1989) (rejecting impossibility defense where the defendant county jail warden could \nnot comply with the Court’s Order because county officials “chose to take no steps to provide \n[him] with the wherewithal to comply”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 8 of 12\nThe elements of civil contempt are easily established here, as the Order of January 28, 2021 \nwas a valid court order that the Defendants obviously had knowledge of, and the Court has already \nfound that Defendants are failing to comply with its out-of-cell-time requirement. See supra § I \n(citing ECF No. 70, ¶ 3). Since the Court’s finding of noncompliance, Defendants’ noncompliance \nhas persisted. Further, in light of the pattern of corrections officer non-reporting that dates back to \nthe summer of 2020, almost a full year ago, it can hardly be said that compliance is “factually \nimpossible,” see Lane Labs-USA, 624 F.3d at 590, or that Defendants have made “all reasonable \nefforts to comply.” See Harris, 47 F.3d at 1324.  Indeed, the current negotiations should have been \nstarted  months  ago,  once  the  pattern  of  non-reporting  was  evident  and  when  persistent \nnoncompliance with this Court’s Orders was fully documented.  \nB.  The Court should impose per diem fines until the City comes into compliance. \nTo pressure the City to provide members of the Plaintiff class with a minimum of three \nhours of daily out-of-cell time, as ordered by the Court, and to compensate class members for the \nharm they have suffered as a result of the City’s noncompliance, the Court should impose per diem \nfines on the City until the City demonstrates that it is complying with the Court’s Order. Since \ncivil contempt serves a remedial, rather than punitive, purpose, “civil contempt may be employed \nto coerce the defendant into compliance with the court’s order and to compensate for losses \nsustained by the disobedience.” McDonald’s Corp. v. Victory Inv., 727 F.2d 82, 87 (3d Cir. 1984). \nUpon a finding of civil contempt, “a per diem fine imposed for each day a contemnor fails to \ncomply with an affirmative court order” is appropriate in order to “exert a constant coercive \npressure” on the contemnor to comply with the court’s order. Int’l Union v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, \n829 (1994). The court may also impose sanctions “to make reparation to the injured party and \nrestore the parties to the position they would have held had the [order] been obeyed.” Robin Woods, \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 9 of 12\n28 F.3d at 400 (citation omitted). Upon a finding of civil contempt, “[d]istrict courts . . . are \nafforded broad discretion to fashion a sanction that will achieve full remedial relief.” John T., 318 \nF.3d at 554; see also AngioDynamics, Inc. v. Biolitec AG, 780 F.3d 420, 426 (1st Cir. 2015) (“[In \ncivil contempt proceedings,] the district court enjoys wide latitude in its choice of sanctions.”). \nHere, the Court should impose a per diem fine of $10,000 until the City demonstrates that \nit is complying with the Court’s Order on out-of-cell time. Should the City fail to do so after two \nweeks, the per diem fine should escalate to $20,000 and continue to double after each two-week \nperiod of continued noncompliance. Cf. AngioDynamics, Inc., 780 F.3d at 423, 427–28 (affirming \ncontempt fines that increased in amount each month, despite the total amount ultimately imposed \nfar exceeding the original judgment in the case). \nIn light of the Court’s “broad discretion to fashion a sanction that will achieve full remedial \nrelief,” see John T., 318 F.3d at 554, the Court should order that any contempt fines paid by the \nCity be directed, in equal amounts, to the Philadelphia Community Bail Fund (“PCBF”)3 and the \nPhiladelphia Bail Fund (“PBF”).4 Both bail funds raise money from tax-deductible contributions \nand use the funds to post bail for people in PDP custody who cannot afford to pay bail. In general, \nthe bail funds have slightly different focuses, with PBF focusing on posting bail “at the earliest \npossible moment . . . ideally before [arrestees] are transferred from their holding cell to jail,”5 and \nPCBF posting bail for people who are already incarcerated in PDP jails. During the pandemic, the \nbail funds’ work has had a substantial effect on the PDP population. From March 2020, when the \nCovid-19 pandemic began, through mid-December 2020, PCBF spent approximately $3 million \n \n3 See PHILADELPHIA COMMUNITY BAIL FUND: ABOUT US, https://www.phillybailout.org/about-\nus.html (last visited May 11, 2021). \n4 See PHILADELPHIA BAIL FUND: ABOUT THE FUND, https://www.phillybailfund.org/about-the-fund \n(last visited May 11, 2021). \n5 Id. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01959-BMS   Document 71   Filed 05/14/21   Page 10 of 12\nto bail out nearly 330 people from PDP jails.6 From March 2020 through the present, PBF has \nbailed out 438 people from PDP jails.7 Plaintiffs can provide further information regarding the \nwork of the bail funds at the request of the City or the Court. \nDirecting the contempt sanctions paid by the City to the bail funds will serve two purposes. \nFirst, it may contribute to a decrease in the PDP population, which could aid the City in complying \nwith the Court’s Order and improve conditions for those who remain in jail. And, second, for those \nwhom the bail funds are able to bail out, the sanctions will serve as a form of compensation for the \nharm done to them by the City’s noncompliance. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs move the Court to find the City of Philadelphia in civil \ncontempt and assess sanctions in the amount of $10,000 per day, doubling after each two-week \nperiod of continued noncompliance, until the City demonstrates that it is complying with the \nCourt’s Order of January 28, 2021. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ David Rudovsky           \nDavid Rudovsky (PA 15168)        \n/s/ Jonathan H.
