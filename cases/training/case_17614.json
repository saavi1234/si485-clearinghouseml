Pursuant to that policy, as well as Civil Rule 5.2 and Criminal Rule 49.1, each party's attorney is required to review a transcript for information that should be redacted pursuant to the Judicial Conference's privacy policy which requires that Social Security numbers be redacted to show only the last four digits; birth dates should contain only the year of birth; individuals known to be minors should be referred to with initials; and financial account numbers should be redacted to the last four digits. Additionally, in criminal case files, home addresses should reveal only the city and state of residence.Our records indicate that the 90-day restriction on public access to an electronic transcript(s) in this matter will lapse within 10 days. If a redaction request is required but has not been filed, please do so immediately. Please feel free to contact our office for further guidance on this issue. (re DE# 111 ; release date 10/13/2020) (tlh) (Entered: 10/05/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>Two individuals with medical conditions that rendered them especially vulnerable to COVID-19 filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus on May 20, 2020 against the Shelby County Sheriff's Office in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2241. They sought to represent a class of Shelby County Jail detainees with disabilities or who were medically vulnerable to COVID-19. Represented by lawyers from the ACLU as well as private counsel, they alleged violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 12111 et seq.), and the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. &sect; 701).</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that conditions in the jail, like housing detainees in close proximity to one another, constituted a failure to provide reasonable safety as well as unlawful punishment of pretrial detainees. They also claimed that defendants were violating the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because they had not made reasonable modifications to their policies to avoid discriminating against detainees with disabilities, who were particularly likely to be affected by COVID. Judge Sheryl H. Lipman was assigned the case.</p>\r\n<p>Simultaneously with the initial petition, plaintiffs sought class certification, a temporary restraining order (TRO) or writ of habeas corpus that would immediately release the named plaintiffs, and a TRO, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction and/or writ of habeas corpus that would create a process by which class members could be released. Plaintiffs filed a motion to expedite consideration of the TRO and preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The following day, Judge Lipman granted the motion to expedite consideration of the TRO and preliminary injunction, instructing defendants to file a response by May 26. Defendants did so, filing a motion to dismiss, a response in opposition to the motion for class certification, and a response in opposition to the motion for a temporary restraining order. Defendants' responses indicated that they had a thorough process for dealing with COVID-19 and were trying to decrease the population of the jail.</p>\r\n<p>By June 10, Judge Lipman issued an order denying defendant's motion for dismissal. She explained that habeas relief was properly sought because plaintiffs challenged the \"fact,\" not conditions, of confinement. Judge Lipman also denied in part and granted in part plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification. The court granted class certification but narrowed its scope. The certified class consisted of detainees (1) age 65 or older; or with (2) chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma; (3) serious heart conditions; (4) immunodeficiencies; (5) severe obesity; (6) diabetes; (7) chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis; (8) chronic liver disease; or (9) hemoglobin disorders. The court also certified a subclass defined as \"All persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during the COVID19 pandemic who are at increased risk of COVID-19 complications or death because of disabilities as defined in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\" 2020 WL 3108713.</p>\r\n<p>Two days later, Judge Lipman addressed the motion for a temporary restraining order. She found that the factual record was not developed enough to rule and ordered the parties to agree on an \"Independent Inspector\" who would visit the jail and report back to the court.</p>\r\n<p>A few days later, plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint which added two more named plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, by June 18 the parties had settled on Michael K. Brady as Independent Inspector. The Inspector filed his report on June 30, 2020. He found that the jail was run by \"consummate professionals\" but still needed to make several adjustments to ensure the safety of its detainees, including issuing additional masks, improving sanitation, and sequestering new arrivals and high-risk detainees.</p>\r\n<p>On June 30, defendants submitted another motion to dismiss, this time targeting plaintiffs&rsquo; amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the motion on July 24, 2020. Judge Lipman criticized defendants' \"needless filing\" of a second motion to dismiss. She noted that defendants' arguments either had been raised and rejected in the first motion to dismiss or should have been raised in the earlier motion. Judge Lipman then rejected the new arguments on the merits because (1) pretrial detainees can bring unconstitutional punishment claims; (2) neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act required proof of discriminatory intent; and (3) habeas relief was available for detainees alleging that their continued detention violated the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. 2020 WL 4668756.</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, the court rejected plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and habeas relief. Judge Lipman noted that habeas relief was only available if plaintiffs showed that it was impossible for the jail to detain them in compliance with the Constitution, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act. But she found that \"any shortcomings are remediable,\" while acknowledging continuing concerns about the lack of social distancing, testing, and quarantine at the jail. 2020 WL 4668757.</p>\r\n<p>On September 15, 2020, plaintiffs moved to modify class certification and file a second amended petition for habeas corpus, alleging that defendants had \"temporarily made improvements to certain conditions, apparently in preparation for the inspections by court-appointed inspector,\" but those improvements \"lapsed shortly after the inspections occurred,\" as well as adding additional named plaintiffs, and including a more detailed request for injunctive relief.</p>\r\n<p>After attending mediation, on December 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement, and the parties filed a joint motion to approve the consent judgment on January 22, 2021. This included a signed settlement agreement between the parties and a consent decree. The consent decree stated that the defendants must provide the Inspector and plaintiffs with a monthly report that details the population of the jail, number of COVID-19 tests conducts for detainees and staff, number of staff on leave in the past 30 days due to COVID-19 symptoms, number of detainees who died and exhibited symptoms of or tested positive for COVID-19 prior to death, and type of housing for class and subclass members. The decree also mandated unannounced inspections and reports by the Inspector at least every 90 days and unrestricted communications with the jail's Expeditor. The decree also required the defendants to prove that ventilation and air quality in the jail was safe, perform testing, isolation, and quarantine where applicable, provide masks, heightened laundry and cleaning options, maximize social distancing. The consent decree provided for termination upon a declaration from the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 pandemic was over, or if an FDA approved, COVID-19 vaccine was offered to and administered to detainees.</p>\r\n<p>On January 28, the court preliminarily granted the motion and ordered the parties to notify the class of the terms of the settlement in advance of the final approval hearing on March 5, 2021. About 70 individual detainees sent letters to the court, many objecting to the notice given to class members or the settlement agreement's terms, or stating concern with the defendant's ability to comply. After 2 final approval hearings, the court granted final approval of the settlement on April 12, 2021, noting that none of the objections led them to believe the settlement was unfair, unreasonable or inadequate. The court retained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes.</p>\r\n<p>On May 19, 2021 the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce and modify the consent decree. They stated that only a week after the decree was approved, defendants had informed plaintiffs that the protections in the decree had terminated, since the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been offered to people in the jail. Plaintiffs argued that defendants had not satisfied the requirements of the decree and that class members in the jail were still at great risk. Specifically, plaintiffs sought enforcement of the decree, requiring defendants to: offer educational materials and non-punitive incentives to increase the vaccination rate; make best efforts to adopt the Independent Inspector's recommendations; adopt recommendations of the Ventilation expert; establish a toll-free number to allow class members to report to counsel regarding decree compliance. Plaintiffs also sought modification of the initial decree's terms regarding termination to clarify that a more robust vaccination program and 80% vaccination rate among detainees for a consecutive 3 month period must be achieved before the decree could be terminated.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly thereafter, on June 2, the defendants filed a motion to terminate the consent decree. They argued they had complied with the terms of the decree by offering vaccines, educational materials and non-punitive incentives to detainees in order to encourage detainees to become vaccinated and that the termination provisions regarding vaccines had been met, so the decree should be terminated.</p>\r\n<p>On August 30, 2021 the court denied the defendants' motion to terminate the consent decree. In denying the defendant's request, Judge Lipman stated that \"The Consent Decree did not enshrine mere box-checking. It enshrined meaningful protection for Plaintiffs, a medically vulnerable group\" and pointed to the low vaccination rate in the jail and the rise of the Delta variant as being signs that the decree was still necessary to protect the detainees in the jail.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed the decision on September 3, 2021 and the case remains ongoing.</p>",

Governments have declared states of emergency and issued stay-at-home \norders for good reason. There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19. The only known way \nto mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infections, complications, and death is prevention: \nsocial distancing of at least six feet between people to limit exposure, and hygienic \nmeasures, such as frequent hand-washing, wearing face masks, and sanitization of high-\ntouch surfaces. Particularly in indoor environments, where COVID-19 can further spread \nthrough aerosolized droplets, these measures are essential.5  \n5.  It is impossible for people in jail or prison to comply with these critical \npreventative measures. People in jail live in close, poorly ventilated quarters in small, \ncrowded cells, and cannot “socially distance” by maintaining the recommended six feet \nof distance from other people. Many people in jail have limited access to soap, personal \nprotective equipment (“PPE”), and hand sanitizer. The pretrial detainees at the Jail are no \nexception. \n6.  As a result, prisons and jails have become epicenters of COVID-19.6 As of \nAugust 28, 2020, 231 people held in Shelby County jails had tested positive for COVID-\n                                                 \n3  Tenn.

Defendants are inescapably on notice of the numerous respects in which \nthe conditions at the Jail are unsafe and inadequate: Plaintiffs have sent a demand letter, \nfiled two complaints, and submitted declarations and testimony from several detainees \noutlining the troubling conditions in the Jail during this pandemic. Two expert \ninspectors—one appointed by the Court—have testified and issued reports expressing \nalarm at the methodology employed at the Jail to contain the virus. Most recently, on \nAugust 7, 2020, the Court itself identified multiple “grave areas of concern” regarding \nthe conditions at the Jail and twice urged the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office to \n“improv[e]” its current practices. After expressing “doubts . . . as to whether the \nconditions at the Jail are legally sufficient,” the Court urged the Jail to remedy these \n“public health lapses” in short order.9  \n8.  More than one month has passed since the Court issued its Order. \nRegrettably, Defendants do not appear to have taken the Court’s forceful admonitions to \nheart. While the Jail temporarily made improvements to certain conditions, apparently in \npreparation for the inspections by court-appointed inspector Michael Brady and \nPlaintiffs’ expert Dr. Homer Venters, most of those improvements lapsed shortly after the \ninspections occurred. In many respects—despite the fact that Defendants have had every \n                                                 \nBen Chapman, Rikers Island Jail Guards Are Dying in One of the Worst Coronavirus Outbreaks, \nWALL STREET JOURNAL (Apr. 22, 2020), wsj.com/articles/rikers-island-jail-guards-are-dying-in-one-\nof-the-worst-coronavirus-outbreaks-11587547801. \n7  https://twitter.com/ShelbyTNSheriff/status/1299421926272761860. \n8  Brandon Richard, Shelby County Sees Big Spike in COVID-19 Cases as Testing Expands, WMC \nAction News (Apr. 27, 2020), https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2020/04/27/shelby-county-sees-big-\nspike-covid-cases-testing-expands/. \n9  ECF No. 124 at Pg.ID 2818, 2819, 2821. \n4 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nopportunity and incentive to provide safe conditions for those in their custody—the Jail is \nno safer than it was when Plaintiffs first filed their Complaint several months ago. \n9.  Favian Busby, Russell Leaks, Joseph Nelson, Terric Edwards, Saul \nMolina Martinez, and Mark Phillips (the “Named Plaintiffs”) are individuals held at the \nJail who seek to represent a class of all current and future persons in pretrial custody at \nthe Jail (the “Class”). Mr. Busby, Mr. Leaks, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Phillips \nalso seek to represent a subclass of all current and future medically vulnerable (as defined \nbelow) pretrial detainees held at the Jail who, according to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (the “CDC”), are at high risk of severe infection or death from \nCOVID-19 (the “Medically Vulnerable Subclass”). Mr. Busby, Mr. Leaks, Mr. Edwards, \nMr. Nelson, and Mr. Phillips also seek to represent a subclass of current and future \npretrial detainees who are medically vulnerable and at high risk of severe injury or death \nfrom COVID-19 due to disabilities protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (the “Disability Subclass”). \n10.  Plaintiffs bring this action because the Jail has failed to uphold its \nconstitutional and statutory minimum requirements, putting Plaintiffs—as well as the \nJail’s staff and the community at large—at unacceptable risk of infection from COVID-\n19. People detained at the Jail are forced to live, sleep, and eat in close proximity to each \nother, are not provided with appropriate sanitary and protective measures, and are unable \nto access critical medical resources, placing them at extraordinary risk of infection with a \npotentially fatal disease.  \n5 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.

COVID-19 is an extremely infectious disease that is transmitted from \nperson-to-person. As of September 14, 2020, at least 28,918,900 people worldwide have \ntested positive for the virus and 922,252 people have died.10 In the United States, at least \n6,467,481 people have contracted the virus, and 193,195 people have died from it.11 Data \nis still emerging, but as of September 13, 2020, 3% of COVID-19 diagnoses result in \ndeath in the United States.12 In some other countries, the mortality rate has been \nsubstantially higher.  \n22.  COVID-19 can cause grave injury to multiple organ systems. In many \npeople, COVID-19 causes fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can be severe. It \ncan severely, even fatally, damage lung tissue. COVID-19 may also target the heart \nmuscle, causing a life-threatening medical condition called myocarditis, or inflammation \nof the heart muscle. COVID-19 can further damage tissue in a cytokine-release syndrome \nthat can result in death or widespread damage to other organs, including permanent injury \nto the kidneys and neurologic injury. \n23.  When patients experience these severe consequences of COVID-19, they \nrequire supportive care, including scarce medical equipment and specialized care \n                                                 \n10  World Health Organization, Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Pandemic (2020), https://www.who.int/\nemergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 (last visited Sept. 14, 2020) \n11  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cases and Latest \nUpdates, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_totalcases (last visited Sept. 13, 2020). \n12  Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, Coronavirus Research Center, \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality (last visited Sept. 14, 2020). \n8 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nproviders, such as nurses, respiratory therapists, and intensive care physicians, to monitor \nand implement this care. This level of support can exceed local health-care resources. \nAnd even with this advanced support, many still die. \n24.  Patients who survive severe complications from COVID-19 often require \nextensive, long-term rehabilitation to mitigate neurologic damage and the loss of \nrespiratory capacity.13 Some will likely experience lifelong limitations and disabilities as \na result of severe COVID-19.  \n1.  Impact of COVID-19 on Certain Populations \n25.  Certain groups of people are at higher risk of serious illness and death \nfrom COVID-19 than the general population. Age is a significant risk factor for \ncomplications and death from COVID-19: The CDC reports that 80% of those who have \ndied of COVID-19 in the United States have been 65 or older.14   \n26.  In addition, the CDC has recognized considerable evidence that people \nwith the following underlying medical conditions are, or likely are, at an increased risk of \nsevere illness from COVID-19: cancer, chronic kidney disease; chronic lung disease, \nincluding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and \npulmonary fibrosis; immunocompromised state from organ, blood, or bone marrow \ntransplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, or use of corticosteroids and other immune \nweakening medicines; obesity (body mass index of 30 or higher); serious heart \nconditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and \n                                                 \n13  See Ed Yong, Long-Haulers Are Redefining COVID-19, THE ATLANTIC (Aug. 19, 2020), \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/long-haulers-covid-19-recognition-support-\ngroups-symptoms/615382/. \n14  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Older Adults (updated Sept. 11, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html. \n9 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nhypertension; sickle cell disease; diabetes; moderate-to-severe asthma; cerebrovascular \ndisease; cystic fibrosis; hypertension or high blood pressure; neurologic conditions; liver \ndisease; pulmonary fibrosis; pregnancy; smoking; and thalassemia.15  \n27.  In addition, it is well-documented that African Americans have \nexperienced significantly worse outcomes following infection with coronavirus than \nothers.16 Recent analysis of CDC data shows that the COVID-19 mortality rate among \nAfrican Americans is more than twice that of white Americans.17 On any given day, the \npopulation of the Jail is typically more than 86 percent African American.18 \n2.  Means of Transmission \n28.  Experts agree that the virus is primarily spread through person-to-person \ncontact, via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person breathes out, coughs, \nsneezes, speaks, or even simply clears their throat. Large droplets remain in the air for \nseconds to minutes before they fall to the ground or land on other surfaces. Smaller \ndroplets, on the other hand, are aerosolized and can remain in the air for as long as three \nhours.19 \n29.  Moreover, the fact that COVID-19 droplets are aerosolized means that the \ndroplets travel significantly greater distances—between 7 and 16 feet from infected \n                                                 \n15  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, People with Certain Medical Conditions (updated Sept. \n11, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-\nconditions.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-\nncov%2Fneed-extra-precautions%2Fgroups-at-higher-risk.html. \n16  E.g., Richard A.

Studies from China found that individuals could be infected simply by \nbeing in the same restaurant as a person with COVID-19, despite having had no direct or \nindirect contact with the COVID-positive patron also eating there, and that air-\nconditioned ventilation transmitted the virus and infected others in the restaurant.22 \nLikewise, of the aerosol samples collected in the hospital room of infected patients, \n63.2% of in-room air samples and 58.3% of hallway air samples tested positive for the \nvirus—even though patients had not coughed prior to collection of the samples.23 In \nshort, there is little doubt that the mere exhalation of an infected person indoors can \ngenerate aerosolized droplets that travel more than six feet, linger in the air for hours, and \nhave the potential to infect others. \n3.  The Need for Preventive Measures \n31.  There is no vaccine against COVID-19, nor is there any known medication \nto prevent or treat infection from COVID-19. On March 26, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci—\nhead of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—estimated that a \nvaccine could be developed in 18 months. Other experts have cautioned that the 18-\nmonth estimate is highly optimistic, as vaccines typically take between 8 and 10 years to \n                                                 \n20  Lindsey C.

And, in any event, the effectiveness of any vaccine that is developed and the \nability to administer it broadly in the United States will remain significant wildcards. \n32.  In the absence of a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure, the only known \nmeasure that vulnerable people can take to reduce the risk of severe illness or death from \nCOVID-19 is to prevent exposure to the virus in the first place. Yet asymptomatic \ncarriers of COVID-19, who show no apparent signs of illness, can also transmit the virus. \nThe only known measure to prevent exposure to the virus is social distancing—remaining \nphysically separated from known or potentially infected individuals—and vigilant \nhygiene, including washing hands with soap and water and cleaning and disinfecting \nfrequently touched surfaces. In light of the possibility of asymptomatic transmission and \nin the absence of widely available testing, the only way to protect oneself from \ncontracting the virus is to remain distant from all other people. \n33.  The world, the country, and this state have changed radically in the \nmonths since COVID-19 was first observed, and our lives have been altered in ways that \nwould have been unimaginable mere months ago. These changes are the result of \nattempts to implement widespread social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. \nOfficials have cancelled public events, closed schools and businesses, and issued stay-at-\nhome orders to the general public.  \n34.  In Tennessee—where, as of August 31, 2020, there were over 153,115 \nconfirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 1,700 deaths from COVID-19—Governor Bill \nLee issued Executive Order No. 23 in April 2020, requiring all Tennesseans to stay at \nhome unless they are carrying out essential activities or engaging in essential services. \nThe order also requires individuals who leave their home to adhere to social distancing \n12 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nmeasures recommended by the CDC, including “[m]aintaining a distance of at least six \n(6) feet between themselves and others, except for family or household members.”   \n35.  In his announcement that the state’s stay-at-home order would expire \nApril 30, 2020, Governor Bill Lee stated, “For the good of our state, social distancing \nmust continue.”24 Indeed, the August 28, 2020 Executive Order extending the state of \nemergency in Tennessee provides that “[s]ocial distancing remains imperative.”   \n36.  Shelby County, too, affirmed on August 24, 2020 in a Public Health \nDirective that “[i]ndividuals must practice social distancing” and must wear masks in \npublic. Social distancing is not possible in the Shelby County Jail.  \nB.  People Detained in the Jail Face a Heightened Risk of COVID-19 Transmission \n37.  The conditions at correctional facilities such as the Jail pose a heightened \nrisk for the spread of COVID-19. Other enclosed group environments, such as cruise \nships and nursing homes, have also seen extremely high COVID-19 transmission rates.25 \nIn the United States, no environments have suffered more than prisons and jails: More \nthan 186,000 people in jails and prisons have been infected with the coronavirus, and \nmore than 1,100 incarcerated people and correctional officers have died.26 In fact, of the \n                                                 \n24  Natalie Allison, Gov.

At correctional facilities, such as the Jail, where incarcerated people are \nrequired to live and sleep in close proximity, social distancing is typically impossible. \nPeople at the Jail are generally confined either in small cells with at least one other \nperson, or in dormitory-style pods with dozens of other people. When they are permitted \ninto communal areas, including to receive meals, take medication, or make phone calls, \nthey are regularly in close proximity to others. \n39.  The risk from the inability to safely practice social distancing is \ncompounded by the lack of access to hygiene products necessary to prevent the spread of \nthe disease and the poorly ventilated indoor environment. In previous epidemics and \npandemics, infection rates in jails and prisons have been higher than in the general \npopulation.  \n40.  Notwithstanding the already difficult conditions in the Jail, Defendants \nhave pepper-sprayed detainees on at least two occasions during the coronavirus \npandemic. On April 29, 2020, staff at the Jail pepper-sprayed detainees in medical \nisolation for COVID-19. This exacerbated the difficulty of breathing for many persons \nalready experiencing symptoms, including shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, \ncoughing up blood, fevers, and chills.  \n41.  On May 19, 2020, staff at the Jail forced detainees who had been in \nquarantine for having contracted or been exposed to COVID-19 back into the general \npopulation. Those being moved from medical isolation were not retested for COVID-19 \n                                                 \n27  Id. \n14 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nprior to being moved, nor were they screened for symptoms of COVID-19. Many \ndetainees resisted the move because it put other people in the Jail at risk of increased \nexposure to the virus: as one person in quarantined housing put it, “All we are looking for \nis to be re-tested before we are re-classified and rehoused. . . [I feel] a moral obligation” \nnot to pass the virus to anyone else.28 Jail staff pepper-sprayed those individuals who \nrefused to move out of quarantine. \nC.  Defendants Failed to Adopt or Amend Policies in Response to the COVID-19 \nPandemic \n42.  The Jail has in place a number of standard policies and operating \nprocedures relating to medical care for detainees, but not a single one of these policies or \nprocedures has been updated to reflect the impact of COVID-19.29  \n43.  One of these policies, Policy 199 (“Exposure Control Plan Communicable \nDisease), specifically references Tuberculosis, Hepatitis A, B, and C, and HIV, but makes \nno mention of COVID-19. Several policies have not been revised in years. It is no \nwonder that the Jail has been caught flat-footed in its response to COVID-19.  \nD.  Defendants Have Utterly Failed to Remediate the Unconstitutional Conditions in \nthe Jail \n44.  Notwithstanding the myriad ways in which the deficient conditions in the \nJail have been brought to Defendants’ attention—Plaintiffs’ demand letter, complaints, \ndeclarations, and testimony; the reports and testimony of two expert inspectors; and the \n                                                 \n28  Yolanda Jones, Inmates at 201 Poplar pepper-sprayed over move after COVID quarantine, DAILY \nMEMPHIAN (May 19, 2020), https://dailymemphian.com/article/14169/covid-19-201-poplar-anthony-\nbuckner-shelby-county-sheriffs-office.  \n29  See ECF No. 27-1 Ex.

Indeed, the Court found in its Order that the inadequacies in the conditions \nat the Jail were “remediable in short time” and could be “quickly cure[d].” Nevertheless, \nDefendants have simply failed to remedy the unconstitutional conditions that the Court \nidentified. \n1.  Non-Testing Policy and Inadequacy of Isolation and Quarantine \n46.  Despite concerns raised by the Court about the efficacy of the Jail’s so-\ncalled “timing-out,” non-testing policy in light of blatant failures to quarantine and isolate \nexposed detainees observed by both expert inspectors, the Jail persists in relying on this \nflawed practice. As the Court noted, a “timing out” strategy could theoretically be \neffective if the necessary steps are followed.30 However, the Jail’s quarantine and \nisolation practices are not, and have never been, sufficient to ensure the viability of this \nstrategy. \n47.  The Jail still does not test for COVID-19 upon the intake of new arrestees. \nIf someone displays symptoms of COVID-19, he is booked into the Jail but is escorted to \nan isolation pod. Yet so-called isolation pods regularly receive new detainees, and the \n“timing-out” clock does not restart for detainees previously living in those pods. Thus, \nwhen a detainee moves out of the isolation pod after 14 days, it is possible that he has \nbeen newly exposed to a detainee who has just moved into the isolation pod. Timing-out \n                                                 \n30  ECF No. 124 at Pg.ID 2805. \n16 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \ncannot be an effective strategy against preventing the spread of the virus where, as here, \nquarantine and isolation practices are not properly adhered to. \n48.  Further, the individuals in post-booking “isolation” themselves cannot \nmaintain social distancing from others in their unit, as both Mr. Brady and Dr. Venters \nobserved. Individuals housed in the lower-level units for isolation have cellmates in close \nproximity and have no choice but to be physically near others to use the phone, receive \nmedication, or receive meals. The CDC recommends housing people in individual cells \nwith solid doors, and specifically cautions against the use of cohorting of potential or \nsuspected cases of COVID-19 and the introduction of new people into a quarantine unit \nat any point during the fourteen-day quarantine period.31 The use of the Jail’s \n“quarantine” practice—which allows for multiple people in a cell within six feet of one \nanother, without solid walls or a solid door—appears nowhere on the list of acceptable \nquarantine practices in the CDC’s guidance: Transfer to another facility to enable \nquarantining is preferred.32 \n49.  In light of these shortcomings, the Jail’s poor testing response is rendered \neven more damaging. In flagrant disregard of CDC guidelines, which explicitly caution \nagainst the use of such a “symptom-based strategy,” the Jail limits its testing to \nindividuals whom staff members determine to be symptomatic.33 And even when \ndetainees have requested tests because they suspect they have been infected, their \n                                                 \n31  Centers for Disease Control, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) in Correctional Detention Facilities (updated July 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.html#Quarantine_inside.  \n32  Id. \n33  Centers for Disease Control, Testing in Correctional & Detention Facilities (updated Aug. 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/testing.html \n(“Accumulating evidence supports ending isolation and precautions for persons with COVID-19 using \na symptom-based strategy.”). \n17 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nrequests have been denied. Infected individuals are not retested before they are moved \nback into their original pod. \n50.  Under these circumstances, the timing-out, non-testing policy is \nfundamentally flawed and puts all detainees in the Jail at grave risk of infection. \n2.  Lack of Barriers to Circulation of Infected Air \n51.  Critically, Dr. Venters also observed that cells used for isolation of \ndetainees are open-bar, meaning that air containing potentially infected droplets from \nwithin an isolation pod mingles with air outside that cell, resulting in potential exposure \nfor those outside the cell.34 In light of evidence that infected aerosolized droplets can \ntravel between 7 and 16 feet and linger in the air for hours indoors, this “isolation” \napproach is completely ineffective at preventing infected droplets from being transmitted \nthrough the air to people outside the isolation pod or cell. In addition, detainees on other \nfloors confirm based on vents in their cells that air flow circulates among different cells.  \n52.  In light of the reality of airborne transmission of the coronavirus, the \nopen-bar units used for medical isolation of COVID-19 positive detainees on the second \nfloor is profoundly unsafe—even more so given the detention of many medically \nvulnerable detainees on the second floor near the medical unit. In this respect, too, \nDefendants are evincing grave disregard to the health and safety of Plaintiffs and the \nother detainees in their care. \n3.  Impossibility of Social Distancing \n53.  Social distancing—the cornerstone of the prevention of the spread of \nCOVID-19—is impossible at the Jail and is in any event not encouraged or enforced by \n                                                 \n34  ECF No. 107 ¶ 22. \n18 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nthe staff. Beyond a video about COVID-19 that is played periodically, the Jail provides \nno instruction on social distancing to detainees. Jail staff does not implement or enforce \nsocial distancing practices, nor are there enough staff members to do so. \n54.  The layout of the Jail is as follows: \n•  In the annexes on the lower level, where new detainees are confined \nduring their purported isolation, there are a series of open-bar cells with \ncommon areas. \n•  The second floor has the Jail’s medical unit and several small open-bar \nliving units where certain medically vulnerable detainees live. There is no \ncommon area. \n•  The third and fourth floors are lined with two-person open-bar cells and \nfeature common areas. \n•  The fifth and sixth floors are dormitory-style floors, with units that contain \n64 beds.35 The pods are accessed through a sally port. \n55.  Most detainees live in pods with cells lining an open communal area, as on \nthe third and fourth floors. Every cell has at least one person, and most have two people. \nWhen more than one person is in a cell, it is impossible to maintain a six-foot distance \nfrom one another. Detainees report spending up to 30 to 48 hours at a time in the same \ncell with another person. Class members sleep in bunk beds, with each bed three to four \nfeet from one another. Each cell also has an open toilet area and a sink that is shared by \n                                                 \n35  When asked about housing detainees in dormitory-style pods during the pandemic, Dr. Donna \nRandolph, medical director at the Jail, testified, “I don’t think that would be really a good idea.” (ECF \nNo. 99-1, at Pg.ID 1496.) She cited the fact that “all the beds are stacked together a couple of feet \napart, and there might be, say, 40 beds in one room.” (Id.) \n19 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nboth cellmates. Showers are in the communal area of the pod and are shared by all \nmembers of the pod.  \n56.  Because of staff shortages in the Jail, detainees are receiving no more than \na few hours of “recreation time” per week. During recreation time, all detainees within a \npod may enter the communal area of the pod, where they can eat meals, use the phone, \nshower, sit at a table, or use a touch-screen kiosk to order items from the commissary. \nThis limited recreation time is each detainee’s only opportunity to participate in \nnecessary activities, including communication with family or their lawyer, showering, or \nordering commissary items, including supplemental nutrition and hygiene items. \nDetainees are not staggered in their time to attend to these needs. The jail staff have not \nmoved the phones, tables, or kiosks farther apart, nor have they provided additional \nphones, tables, or kiosks. As a result, the only way to access showers, phones, meals, and \ncommissary is in close contact with dozens of other incarcerated people. It is not possible \nfor detainees to remain six feet away from other detainees while participating in any of \nthose activities. When people eat, four to five men sit at same table, and they are much \ncloser than six feet from one another. \n57.  When detainees go to see the medical provider, others who have \nappointments at the same time stand in line outside the medical unit. Those in line stand \nless than six feet apart and are not instructed to, nor able to, maintain social distance. \n58.  The Jail undertook certain meager measures to promote social distancing \nin anticipation of the inspection by Mr. Brady. These practices have largely lapsed \nfollowing the inspection, and social distancing remains impossible in the Jail. \n20 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n59.  Some detainees in the dorm-style pods received new bunk assignments \nprior to Mr. Brady’s arrival in the Jail, so that every other bunk would be left empty \n(though detainees were still not sleeping six feet apart from others). The week after the \ninspection, detainees were reassigned to their original bunks. Other detainees have not \nobserved any reassignment of bunks in order to increase spacing and have never even \nreceived an instruction to sleep head-to-foot with their bunkmates. \n60.  Tape demarcating six feet of distance was applied to the floor for the pill \ncall line in some pods prior to the inspection, but detainees were never instructed on its \nmeaning and thus did not use it to distance themselves from others. In any case, the tape \nhas come up from the ground and has not been replaced, and social distancing in the pill \ncall line is not possible. \n4.  Increase in Jail Population and Failure to Consider Individuals for Release \n61.  In its Order, the Court found that “[r]educing the Jail’s overall population, \nparticularly those who are medically-vulnerable, better protects those individuals from \nany spread of the virus within the Jail and allows for more social distancing among those \nwho remain detained.” The Court therefore asked the Jail to consider “alternatives to \nconfinement” and observed that “it does not appear that the unique circumstances of the \npandemic are playing the role that they should.”  \n62.  The Court and its independent inspector found that there was “no \nconcentrated and coordinated effort to assemble and present information to the courts \nregarding an inmate’s medical conditions that may make him vulnerable to serious illness \nor death while housed in the jail.” This remains unchanged. \n21 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n63.  Defendants represented in July 2020 that the population in the Jail had \ndeclined since the onset of the pandemic. However, since the conclusion of the \nevidentiary hearing held by the Court that concluded July 13, 2020, the population in the \nJail has increased by approximately 100 people and is currently close to 2000. Detainees \nreport that they have observed no reduction in the number of people living in their pod \n(except for the removal of detainees who test positive for COVID-19). \n64.  Several Named Plaintiffs who are medically vulnerable and disabled have \nheard nothing from anyone at the Jail regarding their medical vulnerability to COVID or \nany precautions that could be taken within the Jail to help prevent infection among this \npopulation. They are aware of no housing reassignments intended to protect them from \nthe high risk of severe illness or death if they are infected with COVID-19, nor are they \naware of any consideration by the Jail of release or alternatives to incarceration. \n65.  This inattention is unfortunately consistent with the Jail’s stated policy for \nmedically vulnerable people in its custody: Medical director Dr. Donna Randolph \ntestified that she did not treat the medically vulnerable in the Jail differently from others \nin the population. Rather, she “just tr[ies] to take care of everybody the same and tr[ies] \nto keep everybody safe, whether they have a chronic condition or they don’t.”36 Dr. \nRandolph likewise testified that she has had no discussions with the Jail expediter about \nthe potential release of any medically vulnerable detainees during the COVID-19 \npandemic, because she believes her patients “are well cared for.”37 \n                                                 \n36  ECF No. 99-1, at Pg.ID 1509. \n37  Id. at Pg.ID 1540–41. \n22 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n66.  The rising population at the Jail, coupled with detainees’ reports that they \nare aware of no efforts to consider release of detainees or any alternatives, or even to \nmeaningfully improve conditions inside the jail to limit the spread of infection, indicates \nthat Defendants have ignored the Court’s plea. \n5.  Unavailability of Video-Conferencing for Court Hearings \n67.  The Court’s independent inspector made the disturbing observation that \ndetainees who were supposedly isolated or quarantined as part of the Jail’s timing-out \npolicy were routinely being transported to and from court for hearings and kept in \nholding cells with dozens of other detainees with no ability to social distance. The \ninspector determined that this practice “completely undermine[d] the integrity and \npurpose” of the timing-out policy. \n68.  In response, Defendants presented testimony at the evidentiary hearing \nthat, as of mid-July, they were finalizing the installation of hardware to permit court \nconferences to be held by video, in order to minimize opportunities for transmission of \nthe virus during transport to and from court.38 While video-conferencing for court \nhearings has apparently been deployed for arraignments, detainees uniformly report that \nthey have never used a video-conferencing system to attend court dates and do not know \nany other individual who has done so.  \n69.  Relatedly, detainees—who have not been adjudicated guilty of a crime, \nand some of whom are medically vulnerable—have waited four to five months between \ncourt dates while they remain confined in an environment in which they are unable to \ntake meaningful precautions to avoid exposure to COVID-19. \n                                                 \n38  ECF No. 111 at Pg.ID 2237–38. \n23 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n70.  Further, jury trials are currently suspended in Shelby County. For \nPlaintiffs and Class members, this reduces their avenues for release to only two: raise \nenough money to post bail from a jail cell, or plead guilty to receive a plea offer without \nan opportunity to exercise their right to trial or advance available defenses. This \nsuspension of the criminal court process will only continue to cause the population in the \njail to balloon. \n6.  Hygiene and Cleaning Supplies \n71.  The Jail implemented certain improvements to the availability of hygiene \nand cleaning supplies in preparation for Mr. Brady’s inspection. These improvements \nwere short-lived. \n72.  For example, filled soap dispensers were placed in bathrooms prior to \nMr. Brady’s arrival. The soap dispensers sat empty and were not refilled for several \nweeks. Following the evidentiary hearing before the Court, certain pods were on \n“lockdown” and had no access to the commissary to purchase soap for a period of two \nweeks. \n73.  An “environmental team” likewise began spraying down showers and \ntoilets before Mr. Brady’s inspection. That practice ceased approximately one week after \nthe inspection. \n74.  And, prior to the inspection, bleach tablets were made available to those \nwith janitorial responsibilities in the pod. Since the inspection, they have received Biovex \nspray alone, with no materials to wipe down showers and toilets. \n75.  Finally, detainees have never had access to hand sanitizer. \n24 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n7.  Ineffective and Inconsistent Use of PPE \n76.  Detainees do not receive gloves, nor do Jail staff wear gloves. While Jail \nstaff wear masks, consistent with Mr. Brady’s findings in his inspection, staff frequently \nlower their masks below their chins when they speak. \n77.  People detained in the Jail report having received masks that are several \nmonths old, which they wash in the laundry or by hand in the sinks in their cells, using \nthe same bars of soap they use to wash their hands. \nE.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n78.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedures on behalf of themselves and classes of similarly situated individuals \nconsisting of all pre-trial detainees in the custody of the Jail (the “Plaintiff Class”) and on \nbehalf of two subclasses (the “Medically Vulnerable Subclass” and the “Disability \nSubclass”). \n79.  The Plaintiff Class is defined as follows: All current and future persons \nheld at the Jail in pretrial custody during the coronavirus pandemic. \n80.  The Medically Vulnerable Subclass is defined as follows: All current and \nfuture persons held at the Jail in pretrial custody during the coronavirus pandemic who \nare aged 65 years and older; have cancer; have chronic kidney disease; have chronic lung \ndisease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, chronic \nbronchitis, and pulmonary fibrosis; are in an immunocompromised state from organ, \nblood, or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, or use of corticosteroids \nand other immune weakening medicines; are obese (body mass index of 30 or higher); \nhave serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, \ncardiomyopathies, and hypertension; have sickle cell disease; have diabetes; have \n25 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nmoderate-to-severe asthma; have cerebrovascular disease; have cystic fibrosis; have \nhypertension or high blood pressure; have neurologic conditions; have liver disease; have \npulmonary fibrosis; are pregnant; smoke; or have thalassemia \n81.  The Disability Subclass is defined as follows: All current and future \npretrial detainees in custody at the Jail during the coronavirus pandemic who are \nmedically vulnerable because of a disability as defined in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct. The Disability Subclass includes people with all conditions listed in paragraph 80, \nexcept those who are medically vulnerable solely because of age, uncomplicated \npregnancy, or BMI. \n82.  Plaintiffs reserve the right to amend the class or subclass definition or \nestablish additional subclasses as appropriate if discovery or further investigation reveals \nthe class should be expanded or otherwise modified. \n83.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class \naction under Federal law. It satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n84.  Joinder is impracticable because (1) the classes are numerous; (2) the \nclasses include future members; and (3) the class members are incarcerated, rendering \ntheir ability to institute individual lawsuits limited, particularly in light of reduced legal \nvisitation and court closures in Shelby County. \n85.  Numerosity:  On information and belief, there are at least 1900 people in \nthe proposed Plaintiff Class. The proposed subclasses each include at least 400 people. \nThe information regarding the exact size of the Plaintiff Class and the subclasses, as well \nas the identity of the members of each are in the exclusive control of the Defendants.  \n26 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n86.  Commonality:  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members \nof the proposed classes and subclasses, including (a) whether and to what extent the Jail \nis failing to provide incarcerated people constitutionally adequate COVID-19 prevention, \ntesting, and treatment; (b) whether Defendants’ social distancing, health, and hygiene \npolicies and procedures, and actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic \nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (c) whether \nDefendants’ policies and practices discriminate against people with disabilities in \nviolation of federal disability rights laws.  \n87.  Typicality:  The claims of Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class as a \nwhole, including because (a) each Plaintiff is currently in Defendants’ custody; and (b) \nPlaintiffs’ and all class members’ claims arise from the same wrongful acts, omissions, \npolicies and practices of Defendants, and are based on the same legal theories.39 \n88.  Adequacy:  Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome of \nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Plaintiffs have \nno interests adverse to the interests of the proposed class. Plaintiffs retained pro bono \ncounsel with experience and success in the prosecution of civil rights litigation. Counsel \nfor Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among proposed class members or between counsel \nand proposed class members. \n89.  Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to all proposed \nclass members, and this action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs therefore \nseek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n                                                 \n39   All Named Plaintiffs except for Mr. Martinez are medically vulnerable and disabled. Mr. Martinez \ndoes not seek to represent the subclasses or bring claims under § 2241, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, or the Rehabilitation Act.  \n27 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \n90.  In the alternative, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) are satisfied because \nprosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications \nwith respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of \ncontact for the party opposing the proposed classes. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution \n28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses Against All Defendants \n91.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set \nforth in full herein. \n92.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, persons in pretrial custody cannot be \npunished as part of their detention. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979). \nPunishment is established if the jailer’s conduct is either not rationally related to a \nlegitimate, nonpunitive government purpose or excessive in relation to that purpose. \n93.  Under general circumstances, Defendants can hold pretrial detainees if, \nafter making individualized findings based on the person’s flight risk and danger to the \ncommunity, and evaluating less restrictive options than jail, it is clear that nothing short \nof detention will mitigate a credible risk of flight or danger. But and as a condition of \nholding persons in pretrial custody, the Jail must provide them with health care services \nand a safe environment, and cannot punish them. Here, Defendants have exposed the \nNamed Plaintiffs and the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclass members to high \nrisk of severe infection or death from COVID-19. Continuing to detain the Named \n28 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nPlaintiffs and the Class members is punitive, not rationally related to a legitimate \npurpose, and/or excessive in relation to any legitimate purpose.  \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Confinement in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution \n28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses Against All Defendants \n94.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set \nforth in full herein. \n95.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, corrections officials are required to \nprovide for the reasonable health and safety of persons in pretrial custody. Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315–16, 324 (1982) (referencing state’s “unquestioned duty” to \nprovide adequate medical care for detained persons).  \n96.  Corrections officials are required to provide for the reasonable health and \nsafety of persons in pretrial custody, including risks of future harm to their health and \nsafety. See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33–34 (1993) (“That the Eighth \nAmendment protects against future harm to inmates is not a novel proposition. . . . [i]t \nwould be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-\nthreatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to \nthem”). \n97.  The relevant constitutional provision for pretrial detainees is not the \nEighth Amendment but is, instead, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. “[T]he due process rights of a person [in pretrial custody] are at least as \ngreat as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner.” City of \nRevere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983) (emphasis added). Indeed, in \n29 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nKingsley v. Hendrickson, the Supreme Court applied a lower standard to a pretrial \ndetainee’s excessive force claim Fourteenth Amendment than that required of convicted \nprisoners. Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015) (holding that the \nappropriate standard for a pretrial detainee’s excessive force claim is “solely an objective \none”). The Sixth Circuit has noted that Kingsley “calls into serious doubt” whether a \npretrial detainee must make the same showing as a convicted prisoner when raising a \nFourteenth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. See Richmond v. Huq, 885 F.3d \n928, 938 n.3 (6th Cir. 2018) (recognizing the “shift in Fourteenth Amendment deliberate \nindifference jurisprudence [that] calls into serious doubt whether [the plaintiff] need even \nshow that the individual defendant-officials were subjectively aware of her serious \nmedical conditions and nonetheless wantonly disregarded them”). \n98.  If the Court concludes that pretrial detainees must make the same showing \nas a convicted person, deliberate indifference to the serious risk COVID-19 poses to \nmembers of the Class violates this right. \n99.  The Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses are at high risk of \nsevere infection from COVID-19. The Jail is rife with confirmed cases of COVID-19. \nClass members, because of their medical conditions and COVID-vulnerability, cannot be \nsafe in the facilities in which they are housed at the Jail. The only way to ensure their \nsafety and protect their constitutional rights is through release. Defendants are aware of \nthe risk to the safety of the Named Plaintiffs and the Subclass members, but they have not \ntaken steps to release them. Defendants are therefore deliberately indifferent to the safety \nof the Named Plaintiffs and the Subclass members. \n30 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Violation of Title II of the ADA \n42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq./28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Disability Subclass Against All Defendants  \n100.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set \nforth in full herein. \n101.  Title II of the ADA requires that public entities refrain from \ndiscriminating against qualified individuals on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nThe regulations implementing Title II of the ADA require that public entities avoid \npolicies, practices, criteria, or methods of administration that have the effect of excluding \nor discriminating against persons with disabilities in the entity’s programs, services, or \nactivities. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), (b)(3), (8). Further, a public entity must “make \nreasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are \nnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can \ndemonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the \nservice, program, or activity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n102.  Plaintiffs Busby, Edwards, Leaks, Nelson, and Phillips, and members of \nthe Disability Subclass are individuals with disabilities for purposes of the ADA. 42 \nU.S.C. § 12102. They are “qualified” for the programs, services, and activities being \nchallenged herein. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n103.  Defendants are violating Title II of the ADA by failing to make the \nreasonable modifications necessary to ensure equal access to adjudication, jail services, \nand release for people with disabilities who face high risk of severe infection or death \nfrom COVID-19. Defendants are further violating the ADA by employing methods of \nadministration that tend to discriminate against people with disabilities.  \n31 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Violation of Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act \n29 U.S.C. § 794/28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Disability Subclass Against All Defendants  \n104.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set \nforth in full herein. \n105.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that “no qualified individual \nwith disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of [] disability, be excluded \nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under \nany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The \nregulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require that entities \nreceiving federal financial assistance avoid unnecessary policies, practices, criteria, or \nmethods of administration that have the effect of discriminating against persons with \ndisabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i). \n106.  Defendants receive “Federal financial assistance” within the meaning of \n28 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n107.  Plaintiffs Busby, Leaks, Edwards, Nelson, and Phillips, and members of \nthe Disability Subclass are individuals with disabilities for the purposes of the \nRehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12012, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B). They are “qualified” for \nthe programs, services, and activities being challenged herein. \n108.  Defendants are violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing \nto make the reasonable modifications necessary to ensure equal access to adjudication, \njail services, and release for people with disabilities who are at high risk of severe \ninfection or death from COVID-19. Defendants are further violating the Section 504 by \n32 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nemploying methods of administration that tend to discriminate against people with \ndisabilities. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution \nAll Plaintiffs Against All Defendants \n42 U.S.C. § 1983  \n109.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set \nforth in full herein. \n110.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, persons in pretrial custody cannot be \npunished as part of their detention. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979). \nPunishment is established if the jailer’s conduct is either not rationally related to a \nlegitimate, nonpunitive government purpose or excessive in relation to that purpose. \n111.  Under normal conditions, pretrial detention may be justified in response to \nan unmitigable risk of flight or danger to others, and if no less restrictive conditions of \nrelease are able to manage said risk. Incarcerating pretrial detainees under circumstances \nin which they are not reasonably safe from a life-threatening disease is excessive in \nrelationship to these narrow government purposes. The Jail is on notice of the deficient \nconditions for its detainees but has nevertheless failed to remedy those conditions. \nContinuing to detain Plaintiff Class members without making the Jail compliant with \nCOVID-19-specific guidance from public health experts is not rationally related to, and is \nexcessive in relation to, that purpose. Because these failures violate Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth \nAmendment rights, Defendants should be enjoined to remedy the failures that cause \nPlaintiffs’ detention to amount to impermissible punishment. To the extent these failures \n33 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \ncannot be remedied, the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclass Members seek \nhabeas relief as noted in Claim One. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution \n42 U.S.C. § 1983   \n112.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set \nforth in full herein. \n113.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, corrections officials are required to \nprovide for the reasonable health and safety of persons in pretrial custody. Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315–16, 324 (1982) (referencing state’s “unquestioned duty” to \nprovide adequate medical care for detained persons).  \n114.  Corrections officials are required to provide for the reasonable health and \nsafety of persons in pretrial custody, including risks of future harm to their health and \nsafety. See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33–34 (1993) (“That the Eighth \nAmendment protects against future harm to inmates is not a novel proposition. . . . [i]t \nwould be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-\nthreatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to \nthem”). \n115.  The relevant constitutional provision for pretrial detainees is not the \nEighth Amendment but is, instead, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. “[T]he due process rights of a person [in pretrial custody] are at least as \ngreat as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner.” City of \nRevere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983) (emphasis added). Indeed, in \nKingsley v. Hendrickson, the Supreme Court applied a lower standard to a pretrial \n34 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \ndetainee’s excessive force claim under the Fourteenth Amendment than that required of \nconvicted prisoners. Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015) (holding that \nthe appropriate standard for a pretrial detainee’s excessive force claim is “solely an \nobjective one”). The Sixth Circuit has noted that Kingsley “calls into serious doubt” \nwhether a pretrial detainee must make the same showing as a convicted prisoner when \nraising a Fourteenth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. See Richmond v. Huq, \n885 F.3d 928, 938 n.3 (6th Cir. 2018) (recognizing the “shift in Fourteenth Amendment \ndeliberate indifference jurisprudence [that] calls into serious doubt whether [the plaintiff] \nneed even show that the individual defendant-officials were subjectively aware of her \nserious medical conditions and nonetheless wantonly disregarded them”). \n116.  If the Court concludes that pretrial detainees must make the same showing \nas a convicted person, deliberate indifference to the serious risk COVID-19 poses to \nmembers of the Class violates this right. \n117.  The Jail has failed to act reasonably in response to the risk to the Plaintiff \nClass posed by COVID-19. It has failed to comply with public health guidelines to \nmanage an outbreak of COVID-19 and cannot provide for the safety of the Plaintiff \nClass. Defendants’ actions and inactions result in the confinement of members of the \nPlaintiff Class in a jail where they failed to test for, prevent, or treat COVID-19 \noutbreaks, in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights to treatment and adequate medical care. \nBecause these failures violate Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment rights, Defendants \nshould be enjoined to remedy the failures that render Plaintiffs’ detention intolerably \nunsafe. To the extent these failures cannot be remedied, the Medically Vulnerable and \nDisability Subclass Members seek habeas relief as noted in Claim Two. \n35 \nDoc#: US1:13845516v14 \n\nPrivileged & Confidential  \nAttorney Work Product \n \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n118.  Plaintiffs and Class Members respectfully request that the Court order the \nfollowing: \n(1)  Certification of this Petition and Complaint as a Class Action; \n(2)  An injunction requiring the Jail to: \n(a)  Eliminate the “critical system failure of the[] timing-out \nstrategy” by implementing a test-based strategy for \ndetecting and preventing the spread of COVID-19, pursuant \nto which new detainees are tested for COVID-19 at intake \nand “periodic testing” is performed throughout the Jail;40 \n(b)  Address the threat of airborne transmission of COVID-19 \nto ensure proper quarantine and isolation of detainees who \nhave been exposed; \n(c)  Ensure the consistent availability of cleaning supplies for \nsanitizing individual and common areas;  \n(d)  Provide fresh masks for all detainees on at least a weekly \nbasis; \n(e)  Provide free soap to all detainees; \n(f)  Maximize social distancing, through strategies to be \noutlined by a qualified expert pursuant to Federal Rule of \nEvidence 706, by addressing at a minimum:   \n(i)  The practices, housing arrangements, and staffing \nand population levels needed to allow for at least \nsix feet of social distancing at all times, taking into \naccount the dimensions of each living unit; distance \nbetween beds; size and location of toilets, showers, \ntables, and phones; size of day rooms and other \ncommonly used facilities; and staffing levels; \n(ii)  The reconfiguration of sleeping arrangements so \nthat detainees sleep at least six feet from one \nanother, including through use of the previously \nvacant sixth floor;

\n(iv)  Strategies to ensure social distancing in the pill call \nline to address the “cruel ask” of “[r]equiring \nmedically-vulnerable detainees to receive their \nmedications by waiting in a crowded line”;41  \n(v)  Whether alternate housing arrangements or \nstructural modifications are necessary to address the \nairborne spread of COVID-19 in the Jail; \n(vi)  Whether alternative practices, housing \narrangements, and staffing and population levels are \nneeded to ensure the safety of medically vulnerable \nand disabled Subclass members during the course of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic; \n(g)  Reduce the Jail population by establishing a systematic \nprocess by which stakeholders, including the Jail’s \nexpediter, must consider release or other alternatives to \ndetention for each medically vulnerable detainee, and \naddress the Court’s “particular concern” by focusing this \nanalysis on “safety or flight risks in the present,” rather \nthan “repeat offenses in the past”; \n(h)  Implement a system to ensure that disabled subclass \nmembers have access to reasonable modifications and \nnondiscriminatory methods of administration to avoid \ndisability discrimination; \n(i)  Permit Mr. Brady to conduct ongoing unannounced \ninspections of the Jail to determine the full extent to which \nthe facility is implementing necessary safety measures;

\n(ii)   any competent evidence that the individual poses a \npresent, serious risk of flight or danger to others; \n(iii)  whether, by clear and convincing evidence, any \npresent risk of flight of danger outweighs the threat \nto the petitioner’s health and safety posed by his \nexposure to COVID-19 in the Jail, after considering \nalternative conditions to manage the risk(s) \npresented;  \n(b)  Granting a preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, \nand/or writ of habeas corpus requiring continued reporting \nas to the future members of the Class and Subclass, and \nrequiring Defendants to divert Class and Subclass members \nfrom incarceration at the Jail, including, but not limited to, \nby exercising their authority under T.C.A. §§ 8-8-221 and \n40-7-120;

For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The Court will address \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order shortly. \nBACKGROUND \nThe world is currently in the midst of a pandemic as a result of the novel coronavirus \nknown as COVID-19.  It has changed our way of life, both globally and in our community, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 2 of 18    PageID 675\nincluding in our detained population.  It is highly contagious1 and potentially deadly.2  There is \nno vaccine at this time, nor an effective treatment protocol, other than basic treatment of the \nsymptoms.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) currently concludes that \ncertain individuals are at “higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19,” 3 including “people \nwho are 65 years and older” as well as those with several “underlying medical conditions.”  \nWe face a world today that we have not previously experienced.  COVID-19 is unlike \nany virus those living today have seen, causing us all to alter our lives, stay distanced from one \nanother and wear protective gear to keep the virus at bay.  Examining how we confine those \naccused of crimes in this environment, particularly those who face a higher risk for a severe \nillness, is as novel as the virus itself, challenging us to apply accepted concepts of law to \nextraordinarily unique questions.  The importance of getting it right cannot be overstated. \nPlaintiff Favian Busby is a pretrial detainee at the Jail who “has diabetes and takes \ninsulin.”  (ECF No. 1, PageID 4.)  Plaintiff Michael Edgington is also a pretrial detainee at the \nJail who is 60 years old.  (Id.)  Named Plaintiffs seek to represent the proposed class, with their \n \n1 “The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly \nthrough respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. . .

(ECF No. 3, PageID 214.)  Plaintiff Busby seeks to \nrepresent the Subclass, with his current counsel serving as counsel to the Subclass.  (Id.) \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn May 20, 2020, named Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2241 and Class Action Complaint for Declaratory Injunctive Relief.  (ECF No. 1.)  \nPlaintiffs seek “urgent habeas and injunctive relief to protect medically vulnerable people and \npeople with disabilities detained” at the Shelby County Jail (“Jail”), located at 201 Poplar \nAvenue in Memphis, Tennessee, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  (Id.)  Concurrently, \nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) (ECF No. 2) and a Motion \nfor Expedited Consideration (ECF No. 3) of the TRO.   \n  The following day, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Expedited Consideration and \nordered Defendants to respond.  (ECF No. 12.)  Defendants timely responded with a Motion to \nDismiss (ECF No. 25) and Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification \n(ECF No. 26) on May 26, 2020.  The Court held a hearing via video teleconference on May 27, \n2020.  (See ECF Nos. 34, 36.)   \n  Following the hearing, Plaintiffs responded to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on \nMay 29, 2020.  (ECF No. 35.)  Defendants replied on June 4, 2020.  (ECF No. 37.)  \nPROPOSED CLASS DEFINITION \nPlaintiffs seek to certify a class defined as: \nAll persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during the \nCOVID19 pandemic who are 55 and older, as well as all persons currently or in \nthe future held at the Jail of any age who have: (a) lung disease, including asthma, \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., bronchitis or emphysema), or other \nchronic conditions associated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such \nas congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease; \n(c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including hepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 4 of 18    PageID 677\ndiabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) hypertension; (f) compromised immune \nsystems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow \ntransplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune disease); (g) blood \ndisorders (including sickle cell disease); (h) inherited metabolic disorders; (i) \nhistory of stroke; (j) neurological or developmental disability; (k) cancer or cancer \ntreatments; (l) a BMI of 40 or more; and/or (m) muscular dystrophy or spinal cord \ninjury. \n \n(ECF No. 3, PageID 214.) \n \nWithin the Class, Plaintiffs seek to certify one subclass (“Subclass.”) \n \nThe proposed Subclass is defined as: \n \nAll persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during the \nCOVID19 pandemic who are at increased risk of COVID-19 complications or \ndeath because of disabilities as defined in the Americans With Disabilities Act \n(ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Subclass includes everyone \nin the Class except those people who are vulnerable solely due to age or BMI. \nPeople with all other conditions listed in paragraph (1) above are people with \ndisabilities as defined under federal law. \n \n(Id.) \nANALYSIS \nI.  Motion to Dismiss \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs’ Petition must be dismissed for three reasons:4 (1) the \nPetition is not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 because it challenges the conditions of \nconfinement rather than the fact or duration of confinement, (2) Plaintiffs have yet to exhaust \nstate law remedies and (3) Plaintiffs’ have failed to comply with the requirements of the Prison \nLitigation Report Act’s (“PLRA”).  In response, Plaintiffs argue that (1) their claims are properly \nbrought under § 2241, (2) there is no available state remedy and (3) the PLRA does not apply to \ntheir habeas claims. \n \n4 In their Reply to Plaintiffs’ Response to the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffs’ claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act must fail.  \n(ECF No. 37, PageID 668.)  However, because Defendants raise this argument for the first time \nin their Reply, it is not well-taken, and not considered here.    \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 5 of 18    PageID 678\nA.  Cognizable as a Habeas Claim \nGenerally, inmates in state custody seeking pretrial habeas relief must bring their claims \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  Atkins v. People of State of Mich., 644 F.2d 543, 546 n.1 (6th Cir. \n1981); Winburn v. Nagy, No. 19-2398, at *2 (6th Cir. Apr. 23, 2020).  Section 2241 provides a \nfederal district court with jurisdiction over petitions for habeas corpus where a petitioner is in \n“custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.”  § 2241(c)(3).  \nSuits challenging the “fact or duration of confinement fall within the traditional scope of habeas \ncorpus and accordingly are not cognizable under § 1983.”  Thomas v. Eby, 481 F.3d 434, 438 \n(6th Cir. 2007.) \nThese claims are cognizable under § 2241.  Plaintiffs are challenging the execution or \nmanner of their pretrial detention.  See Edwards v. Dewalt, 681 F.3d 780, 784 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(“A prisoner can, for instance, use § 2241 to challenge the “execution or manner in which the \nsentence is served.”)  They do not challenge, or seek alteration of, jail conditions.  At the \nhearing, when asked directly if they are seeking a change in jail conditions, Plaintiffs’ counsel \nexplained: \nWe are certainly not asking you, Your Honor, to go in and make changes to the [jail] \nconditions.  But the reason why we're not asking for that is because the challenge that we \nare presenting is to the validity of the confinement . . . . [T]here are no conditions at the \njail under which Petitioners and the class members who are medically vulnerable or at \notherwise at high risk of severe infections or death from COVID-19 can be safe. \n \n(ECF No. 36, PageID 582.)   \nPlaintiffs argue that, regardless of whether conditions improve at the Jail, their challenge \nis to the fact that they are being confined in a community facility such as the Jail.  (ECF No. 1, \nPageID 19–20.)  So long as they are confined at the Jail during the pandemic, Plaintiffs contend \nthat their confinement is unconstitutional.  (ECF No. 2, PageID 53.)  The nature of Plaintiffs’ \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 6 of 18    PageID 679\nchallenge, along with their requested relief— release or enlargement of custody—means that \ntheir claims are properly brought under § 2241.5  See Wilson v. Williams, 2020 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 14291, *4 (6th Cir. 2020) (“Where a petitioner claims no set of conditions would be \nconstitutionally sufficient, we construe the petitioner’s claim as challenging the fact of the \nconfinement”); see also Wilson, Case No. 20-3441, ECF No. 54 (6th Cir. June 9, 2020) (same). \nGiven the facts here, Plaintiffs could have theoretically pled a § 1983 claim, but under \nwhich law they plead is their prerogative.  See Ansfield v. Omnicare, Inc., 769 F.3d 455, 467 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (finding that a plaintiff is the “master of its complaint, which means that it can \nchoose the forum in which to file and the law under which it wishes to seek relief”).  Of course, \nthis does not require the Court to ultimately grant the relief they seek.  But, at a minimum, the \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs’ pleading under § 2241 was proper.    \nB.  Availability of State Remedies \nGenerally, where state inmates seek relief under § 2241, they “must exhaust all available \nstate court remedies before proceeding in federal court.”  Phillips v. Court of Common Pleas, \nHamilton Cty., Ohio, 668 F.3d 804, 810 (6th Cir. 2012).  However, “exhaustion is a problem \nonly if the state still provides a remedy for the habeas petitioner to pursue, thus providing the \nstate courts an opportunity to correct a constitutionally infirm state court conviction.”  Rust v. \n \n5 That part of Plaintiffs’ requested relief is not release from custody but simply “enlargement” of \nthe custody, in a form such as home confinement, does not preclude Plaintiffs from filing under § \n2241.  After all, unlike the other habeas statute, § 2255, there is “no similar requirement in § \n2241 that a petitioner claim release from custody.”  Wagner v. United States, 2020 WL 974894, \nat *6 (6th Cir. Feb. 28, 2020) (emphasis in original).  For this reason, under § 2241, an inmate \ncan bring “challenges to the location where a sentence is served, prison transfers, or a prison’s \nrequirement that a prisoner make restitution payments while confined.”  Id. (citations omitted).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 7 of 18    PageID 680\nZent, 17 F.3d 155, 160 (6th Cir. 1994).  “If no remedy exists, and the substance of a claim has \nnot been presented to the state courts, no exhaustion problem exists.”  Id. \nNo exhaustion problem exists here.  Certainly, state courts have an obligation to uphold \nfederal constitutional law, and they often have procedures in place for people seeking relief for \nconstitutional violations.  See Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 494 (1976).  But given ample \nopportunity, Defendants fail to show that courts in Shelby County have procedures in place for \nthe type of substantive due process grievances Plaintiffs bring to this Court.  That is \nunderstandable.  Pretrial detention should not last long.   \nYet, what we have here are potentially hundreds of medically vulnerable people who seek \nrelease from a county jail amid a pandemic.  The absence in Tennessee law of both a normal and \na proven procedure which provides relief based on these unique medical needs for release means \npretrial inmates in Shelby County have no available state remedies.  See O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, \n526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999) (noting that “state prisoners do not have to invoke extraordinary \nremedies when those remedies are alternatives to the standard review process and where the state \ncourts have not provided relief through those remedies in the past”). \nDefendants cite to various Tennessee statutes, but none provide an avenue for inmates to \nseek the relief requested here.  The Tennessee habeas statute is triggered in only two situations, \nneither of which arise here:  where a conviction is void because the trial court was without \njurisdiction or where a defendant remains confined despite the expiration of his sentence.  See \nState v. Ritchie, 20 S.W.3d 624, 630 (Tenn. 2000);  Benson v. State, 2019 WL 1388195, at *2 \n(Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 26, 2019) (affirming denial of a pretrial inmate's habeas petition because \nit was “premature in that there were no convictions at the time of the . . . petition”) . \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 8 of 18    PageID 681\nNeither do the Tennessee’s pretrial processing statutes cited by Defendants provide an \navailable remedy.  After an arrest, Tennessee courts first consider releasing a “bailable” \ninmate—all pretrial criminal defendants save those charged with capital offenses—on their own \nrecognizance or on an unsecured bond.  See Hill v. Hall, No. 3:19-CV-00452, 2019 WL \n4928915, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 7, 2019).  In deciding whether to release an inmate on their \nown recognizance, courts look to the following factors, none of which require consideration of \nan inmate’s health risks during confinement: \n1.  The defendant's length of residence in the community; \n2.  The defendant's employment status and history, and financial condition; \n3.  The defendant's family ties and relationships; \n4.  The defendant's reputation, character and mental condition; \n5.  The defendant's prior criminal record, including prior releases on recognizance or bail; \n6.  The identity of responsible members of the community who will vouch for defendant's \nreliability; \n7.  The nature of the offense and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely \nsentence, insofar as these factors are relevant to the risk of nonappearance; and \n8.  Any other factors indicating the defendant's ties to the community or bearing on the risk \nof willful failure to appear. \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115. \n \nIf release upon recognizance or on an unsecured bond is not appropriate, the court may \nimpose conditions, such as bail, to help ensure the defendant’s appearance in court.  See id.  And \neven after those conditions are imposed, courts may alter those conditions, an option heavily \nrelied on by Defendants.  Yet, the same agnosticism to an inmate’s medical condition in the \ninitial bail decision process pervades these pretrial processing statutes.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ \n40-11-116, -118.  At none of these pretrial junctures do state courts have to consider an inmate’s \nrequest for release due to health risks.  And because pretrial inmates in Shelby County seek \nexactly that, the various appellate procedures Defendants cite are equally unavailable to inmates.  \nSee Cameron, 2020 WL 2569868, at *14 (E.D. Mich. May 21, 2020). \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 9 of 18    PageID 682\nDefendants also point to recent Tennessee Supreme Court orders relating to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, but unfortunately none address this particular issue.  While the Tennessee Supreme \nCourt has ordered various measures to ensure that critical proceedings continue, none of the \nmeasures in its orders outline a way in which a medically vulnerable pretrial detainee, in any \nstate jail, may seek release based on that status.  See In Re: Covid-19 Pandemic, No. ADM2020-\n00428 (Tenn. March 25, 2020).   \nDefendants attempt to rely on several state court decisions to argue that Tennessee courts \nregularly entertain similar constitutional grievances, but those cases are not on-point.  In none of \nthe cases did the Tennessee courts consider a pretrial inmate’s allegation that her substantive \nright to medical treatment under the Eighth Amendment was violated.  Rather, in the cases cited, \nthe state courts considered inmates’ procedural grievances, unrelated to health concerns, that \narose amid pretrial detention.  See, e.g., State v. Burgins, 464 S.W. 3d 298, 307–08 (considering \nwhether pretrial detention without bond was a procedural due process violation);  State v. Leavy, \n1999 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1296, *7 (finding detention of a pretrial juvenile inmate without \nbond was not a procedural due process violation). \n  Defendants’ reliance on the declarations of Shelby County Criminal Court judges is also \ninapposite.  The declarations, (ECF Nos. 27-3, 27-4), while addressing several important issues, \ndo not point to any instance where a pretrial inmate’s request for release due to medical reasons \nwas heard, and ruled on, based on a state statute or rule of criminal procedure.  Of course, certain \njudges may be discretionarily (and sua sponte) considering pretrial inmates’ health risks.  But \nevidence of even that happening in a particular instance in Shelby County has not been presented \nto this Court.  Moreover, even if that was the case sometimes, it would be among those \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 10 of 18    PageID 683\n“extraordinary” state law remedies that are “technically available to the litigant but not required \nto be exhausted.”   Smith v. Morgan, 371 F. App'x 575, 579 (6th Cir. 2010).      \n  In sum, there is no normal and proven available state remedy by which a medically-\nvulnerable pretrial detainee may challenge his custody or bond based on his medically-\nvulnerable status.  Therefore, exhaustion is not required.  \nC.  Applicability of the PLRA \nGiven that Plaintiffs’ claims are cognizable under § 2241, the PLRA’s requirements do \nnot apply here.  See 18 U.S.C. 3626(g)(2)(noting that the PLRA’s requirements do not apply to \n“habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison”);  Wilson, \n2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14291, *4 (“Petitioners’ proper invocation of § 2241 also forecloses any \nargument that the PLRA applies given its express exclusion of habeas corpus proceedings \nchallenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison from its ambit”) (quotations omitted).  \nEven if this was a § 1983 action, it is unclear whether the PLRA would preclude the Court’s \nconsideration of this matter.  See Cameron, 2020 WL 2569868, at *14 (holding that the PLRA’s \nrequirement that a three-judge panel enter a prison release order due to a constitutional violation \ndoes not apply where overcrowding is not the primary cause of the violation). \n  For these reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.   \nII.  Motion for Class Certification \nThe Court next turns to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.   \n  A.  Class Definition \nPlaintiffs seek to certify a class of detainees who are at a higher risk for severe illness \nfrom COVID-19.  However, the definition offered by Plaintiffs for that proposed Class is much \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 11 of 18    PageID 684\nbroader than the CDC’s list of persons who are at higher risk for adverse reaction should they \ncontract COVID-19.6   \nFirst, the CDC concludes that those age 65 and older, and those with certain underlying \nmedical conditions face a higher risk of severe consequences should they contract COVID-19.  \nAccording to the CDC, the underlying medical conditions include: \n•  People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma \no  Including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including \nemphysema and chronic bronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and \ncystic fibrosis \n•  People who have serious heart conditions \no  Including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, \ncardiomyopathies and pulmonary hypertension \n•  People who are immunocompromised \no  Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including \ncancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune \ndeficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of \ncorticosteroids and other immune weakening medications \n•  People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher) \n•  People with diabetes \n•  People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis \n•  People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis \n•  People with hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia7 \nDespite the CDC’s position on the age of the vulnerable population, Plaintiffs’ proposed \nClass includes all persons who are 55 years of age or older.  Plaintiffs justify this expanded class \ndefinition because “incarcerated patients tend to age faster than non-incarcerated persons.”  (ECF \n \n6 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html \n(last visited June 5, 2020.) \n \n7 Id.; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Groups Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe \nIllness, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-\nrisk.html.  The Court notes that medical information regarding COVID-19 is constantly \nevolving.  Defendants do not contest the legitimacy of any of the medical conditions Plaintiffs \npropose to be used to consider membership in the Class.   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 12 of 18    PageID 685\nNo. 2, PageID 46.)  However, the Court is not persuaded by this argument and declines to depart \nfrom the CDC’s guidelines in this sole area.   \nAs to the “medically vulnerable,” Plaintiffs specifically list hepatitis, endocrine disorders, \nmetabolic disorders, people with a history of stroke and people with muscular dystrophy or a \nspinal cord injury in their list of medically vulnerable class members.  These conditions are not \nlisted on the CDC website, which is the cited source of information in Plaintiffs’ filings.  (See \nECF No. 2, PageID 45 n.4.)  Further, while Plaintiffs list asthma as a condition, the CDC \nconcludes that only “moderate to severe asthma” is a condition which may exacerbate COVID-\n19.8  \nThe Court has “broad discretion to modify class definitions.”  Wilson v. Williams, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 70674, at *15 n.49 (N.D. Ohio April 22, 2020.)  Because both Parties rely on \nthe CDC for guidance regarding health information related to COVID-19, the Court narrows the \nproposed Class to be in conformity with the CDC guidelines.  The Court will consider the \nfollowing to be the definition of the Class:  \n1.  People 65 years and older; \n2.  People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma (including chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic \nbronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis); \n3.  People who have serious heart conditions (including heart failure, coronary artery \ndisease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies and pulmonary hypertension); \n4.  People who are immunocompromised (including cancer treatment, smoking, bone \nmarrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or \nAIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening \nmedications); \n5.  People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher); \n6.  People with diabetes; \n7.  People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis; \n8.  People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis; and  \n9.  People with hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. \n \n8 Id. \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 13 of 18    PageID 686\nB.         Criteria for Class Certification \nRule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) governs class certification.  \nFour requirements must be met for the Court to certify a class:  numerosity (“the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable”); commonality (“there are questions of \nlaw or fact common to the class”); typicality (“the claims and defense of the representative \nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class”); and adequacy of representation (“the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”).  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a).  In addition to these requirements, the class must fall into at least one of the categories \nlisted in FRCP 23(b).  Coleman v. GMAC, 296 F.3d 443, 446 (6th Cir. 2002.)  Plaintiffs carry \nthe burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the class is proper.  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011.)   \n1.  Numerosity \nJoinder of all parties must be impractical to meet the first factor of FRCP 23(a).  While \nthere is no strict minimum number of plaintiffs defined by law, “Courts within the Sixth Circuit \nhave recently stated that the numerosity requirement is fulfilled when the number of class \nmembers exceeds forty.”  In re Wal-Mart ATM Fee Notice Litigation, 2015 WL 6690412, at *7 \n(W.D. Tenn. Nov. 3, 2015) (quotation and citation omitted.)  Here, Plaintiffs, largely using the \nopen-source research that is available to them at this stage of the litigation, estimate that \nmembership of the proposed Class and Subclass “exceeds 300.”9  (ECF No. 3, PageID 218–19.)   \n \n9 Plaintiffs calculate this estimate based on the number of people in the Jail, epidemiologists’ \nestimates on the number of people who have a chronic health condition and publicly available \ndata regarding the age of currently detained individuals at the Jail.  (ECF No. 3, PageID 218–19.)  \nThe Court finds, that, despite its narrowing of the proposed class, it is highly likely that there are \nmore than 40 detainees who fit the modified Class definition.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 14 of 18    PageID 687\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs “have presented no actual evidence about the proposed \nclass.”  (ECF No. 26, PageID 339.)  Notably, while Defendants criticize the strength of \nPlaintiffs’ proof on numerosity, they do not actually contradict any of the data Plaintiffs rely on \nin their estimate, nor do they aver that it is incorrect.  In fact, part of Plaintiffs’ request for data in \nthe TRO is that which would likely be used to satisfy this requirement.  However, Defendants \noppose producing that data.  Defendants’ demanding that Plaintiffs meet their burden while also \nkeeping the information from them smacks of the proverbial “having one’s cake and eating it, \ntoo.”  They cannot have it both ways. \nThe Court finds that, based on the record at this stage and by a preponderance of the \nevidence, joinder is impractical and numerosity is met. \n2.  Commonality \nFRCP 23(a)(2) requires that “there [be] questions of law or fact common to the class.”   \n“What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common ‘questions’—even in \ndroves—but, rather, the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to \ndrive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) \n(citation omitted.) \n  Plaintiffs aver that there are questions of both law and fact which pertain to all members \nof the Class and Subclass and propose three that meet this criteria.  (ECF No. 3, PageID 221.)  \nFirst, “[d]oes COVID-19 present a risk of harm so severe to Class members detained at Shelby \nCounty Jail that the only constitutionally permissible way to protect them is to release them?”  \n(Id. at PageID 222.)  Second, “[h]ave Defendants failed to provide Subclass members reasonable \nmodifications to protect against COVID-19 in violation of disability rights laws?”  (Id.)  Lastly, \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 15 of 18    PageID 688\n“[i]s release of Class and Subclass members from custody in light of the COVID-19 pandemic \nthe only way the Jail can adequately protect vulnerable people from injury or death?”  (Id.) \n  Defendants contest the commonality of the purported Class and Subclass based on the \n“individualized assessment” which would be required prior to the release of any detainee.  (ECF \nNo. 26, PageID 342.)  They contend that an individual assessment must be done to determine \nwhether the Jail can provide proper medical treatment, whether the detainee is a threat to the \nsafety of the community, whether the detainee has a safe place to go should he or she be released \nand whether the detainee might put the public at risk of infection.  (Id.)  Defendants also raise \nissues related to the rights of crime victims, who, under the Tennessee Constitution, have \nenumerated rights which could be impacted by class certification.  See Tenn. Const. art. I § 35.  \nNotably, these rights include the right to be informed of proceedings and release of an accused, \nas well as to be present at all proceedings at which a defendant has the right to be present.  Id. \n  Here, all members of the purported Class and Subclass are allegedly suffering the same \ninjury due to Defendants’ alleged response to COVID-19.  Despite the individual assessments \nthat must occur if Plaintiffs are ultimately successful on the merits of their claims, there are \ncommon questions of fact and law that can be answered for the entire proposed Class to expedite \na resolution.  While Defendants are correct that individual assessments will have to be \nconducted, the commonality requirement does not require that all questions must be the same for \nall class members.  “Even if individualized determinations . . . are necessary, the ‘mere fact that \nquestions peculiar to each individual member of the class remain after the common questions of \nthe defendant’s liability have been resolved does not dictate the conclusion that a class action is \nimpermissible.”  Cameron, 2020 WL 2569868, at *18 (quoting Sterling v. Veliscol Chem. Corp., \n855 F.2d 1188, 1197 (6th Cir. 1998.))   \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 16 of 18    PageID 689\n  Because there are questions of law and fact that are common among the proposed \nmembers of the Class and Subclass, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that \ncommonality has been met.  \n3.  Typicality \n\"A claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that \ngives rise to the claims of other class members, and if [the named plaintiff's] claims are based on \nthe same legal theory.\"  Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 561 (6th Cir. 2007) (quotation \nomitted.)  Here, the purported Class and Subclass have the same claim, that, given their age \nand/or medical status, their current detention is unconstitutional in light of COVID-19.  The legal \ntheories are the same despite the potential for different results after individualized assessments \nlater in litigation. \nThe Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that typicality has been met. \n4.  Adequacy of Representation \nThere are two criteria for determining whether “the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The representative and \nthe unnamed members must have common interests, and it must appear that the representative \nwill vigorously prosecute the interests of the class.  In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, \n1083 (6th Cir. 1996.) \nHere, Defendants did not contest the adequacy of representation.  Named Plaintiffs and \nthe remainder of the purported class have incentive to prosecute the case vigorously because \ntheir interests are identical.  Due to the potential fatal result of contracting COVID-19, their \nincentive is high.  Further, Plaintiffs are represented by several competent counsel and \norganizations that have experience in this area of litigation.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 17 of 18    PageID 690\nC.  FRCP 23(b)(2) \nIn addition to meeting all of the factors under FRCP 23(a), plaintiffs must meet one of the \ncriteria under FRCP 23(b).  Certification under FRCP 23(b)(2) is appropriate where the party \nseeking it shows that \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that \napply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Courts have found that \nthe requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are “almost automatically satisfied in actions primarily seeking \ninjunctive relief.”  Williams v. City of Philadelphia, 270 F.R.D. 208, 222 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (citing \nBaby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 1995)) (additional citation omitted).  \"Numerous \ncourts have held that Rule 23(b)(2) is an appropriate vehicle in actions challenging prison \nconditions.\"  Id. at 222 (citing cases). \nHere, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief that requires Defendants to take specific action to \naddress alleged ongoing constitutional violations of pretrial detainees at the Jail.  This action \nfalls under FRCP 23(b)(2). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED, and Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Class Certification is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  The Court \nconcludes that the modified Class and Subclass meet the requirements for class certification.   \n   The Class consists of all: \n1.  People 65 years and older; \n2.  People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma (including chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic \nbronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis); \n3.  People who have serious heart conditions (including heart failure, coronary artery \ndisease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies and pulmonary hypertension); \n4.  People who are immunocompromised (including cancer treatment, smoking, bone \nmarrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 38   Filed 06/10/20   Page 18 of 18    PageID 691\nAIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening \nmedications); \n5.  People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher); \n6.  People with diabetes; \n7.  People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis; \n8.  People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis; and  \n9.  People with hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. \nThe subclass consists of: \nAll persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during \nthe COVID19 pandemic who are at increased risk of COVID-19 \ncomplications or death because of disabilities as defined in the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The \nSubclass includes everyone in the Class except those people who are \nvulnerable solely due to age or BMI. People with all other conditions listed in \nparagraph (1) above are people with disabilities as defined under federal law. \n \nThe Court ORDERS Defendants to file a list of Class and Subclass members on the \ndocket, no later than noon on Friday, June 12, 2020.  This list shall include:  the detainee’s full \nname, the pod and cell number where the detainee is currently housed at the time of this Order \nand whether the detainee is occupying the cell alone, or the number of cellmates who live with \nthe detainee.  The Court will address the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order shortly and \nwill include a schedule for the next steps in this litigation at that time.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 10th day of June, 2020. \ns/ Sheryl H.

[ECF No. 57.] \nARGUMENT \nA.  Petitioners-Plaintiffs  are  not  automatically  entitled  to  discovery,  much  less \nexpedited discovery. \n \nUnlike a normal civil plaintiff, a habeas petitioner is not entitled to discovery as a matter \nof course, but only upon a fact-specific showing of good cause and in the Court’s exercise of \ndiscretion. USCS Sec. 2254 Cases R 6; Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 117 S. Ct. 1793, 138 L. \nEd. 2d 97 (1997).1 Before determining whether discovery is warranted, the Court must first identify \nthe essential elements of the claim on which discovery is sought.   Id. (citing United States v. \nArmstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996)). The burden of demonstrating \n \n1 Pursuant to Rule 1(b) of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, federal courts apply the Habeas Rules to § 2241 \nproceedings. See White v. Lewis, 874 F.2d 599, 602-03 (9th Cir. 1989) (applying Habeas Rules to a § 2241 petition); \nSettle v. Parris, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104922 (W.D. Tenn. June 16, 2020) (applying Habeas Rules to a § 2241 \npetition); Williams v. Holloway, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32264, at *12 n.2 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 14, 2016) (“The Habeas \nRules apply to petitions brought under § 2241 challenging a prisoner’s detention”). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 2 of 14    PageID 913\nthe materiality of the information requested is on the moving party. Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d \n442 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Murphy v. Johnson, 205 F.3d 809, 813-15 (5th Cir. 2000)). \nUnder Rule 6(b), “a party requesting discovery must provide reasons for the request. The \nrequest must also include any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must \nspecify any documents.”  USCS Sec. 2254 Cases R 6(b). While the Court may afford a habeas \npetitioner the right to conduct discovery, the Court may limit the extent of the discovery. USCS \nSec. 2254 Cases R 6(a). When addressing a motion for discovery, “a habeas court must identify \nthe ‘essential elements’ of the petitioner’s substantive claim . . . [and] evaluate whether ‘specific \nallegations . . . show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be \nable to demonstrate that he is . . . entitled to relief.’” Newton v. Kemna, 354 F.3d 776, 783 (8th \nCir. 2004) (quoting Bracy, 520 U.S. at 904 & 908-09). A petitioner’s factual allegations may not \nbe speculative or conclusory, and “Rule 6 does not authorize fishing expeditions.” Murphy v. \nJohnson, 205 F.3d 809, 814 (5th Cir. 2000). \nHere, Petitioners-Plaintiffs assume that they are entitled to discovery; however, they have \nfailed to undergo the process as set forth by Rule 6 by providing specific reasons for their requests \nso that the Court may set the parameters of the discovery sought. Before the Court allows four (4) \ndays of written discovery, depositions, and an on-site inspection by Petitioners-Plaintiffs, the \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs must provide reasons for their specific requests, and the Court must be given \nthe opportunity to determine the parameters of what, if any, discovery will be allowed in the case \nas a whole. Because Petitioners-Plaintiffs have disregarded Rule 6, their motion for expedited \ndiscovery should be denied. \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 3 of 14    PageID 914\nB.  Petitioners-Plaintiffs have failed to show “good cause” for expedited discovery \nunder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n \nTo the extent the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply to Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ expedited \ndiscovery request, Petitioners-Plaintiffs have failed to show the requisite “good cause” necessary \nto support their motion. Expedited discovery is not the norm. Branch Banking & Trust Co. v. \nJones, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204659, at *20 (E.D. Kent. Dec. 4, 2018); In re Paradise Valley \nHoldings, Inc., 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 2951, at *4 (E.D. Tenn. Bankr. Dec. 29, 2005). Generally, \n“[e]xcept in categories of proceedings exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(E), or \nwhen authorized under these rules or by order or agreement of the parties, a party may not seek \ndiscovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f).” In re \nParadise Valley Holdings, Inc., 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 2951 at *4. Expedited discovery can only be \nappropriate, if at all, to the extent the discovery is necessary to support a plaintiff’s request for an \ninjunction. See Degeeter v. McNeill, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105812, *7-8 (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 21, \n2007). Even then, expedited discovery is appropriate only where discovery of certain facts is \n“unusually difficult or impossible.”  Nellson v. Barnhart, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98112, at *9 (D. \nColo. June 4, 2020) (quoting Pod-Ners, LLC v. N. Feed & Bean of Lucerne Ltd. Liability Co., 204 \nF.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Colo. 2002)). “Courts should not grant leave without some showing of the \nnecessity for expedited discovery. The court must protect defendants from unfairly expedited \ndiscovery.” Waggin’ Train LLC v. Normerica, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110564, *3 (W.D. \nTenn. Aug. 18, 2009) (citing Notaro v. Koch, 95 F.R.D. 403, 405 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)). As such, \nlitigants are entitled to expedited discovery only “upon a showing of good cause.” North Atlantic \nOperating Co. v. Huang, 194 F. Supp. 3d 634, 637 (E.D. Mich. 2016). \n“Good cause may be found where the need for expedited discovery, in consideration of the \nadministration  of  justice,  outweighs  the  prejudice  to  the  responding  party.”  Fabreeka  Int’l \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 4 of 14    PageID 915\nHoldings, Inc. v. Haley, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116007, at *12 (E.D. Mich. Dept. 1, 2015). In \nconsidering whether good case exists, courts examine multiple factors including “[1] the danger \nthat the nonmovant will not preserve the information sought, [2] whether expedited discovery will \nsubstantially contribute to moving the case forward, and [3] the narrow scope of the information \nsought.” Branch Banking & Trust Co., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204659, at *21 (E.D. Ky. Dec. 4, \n2018).  Notably, the party requesting expedited discovery bears the burden of demonstrating good \ncause to abandon the usual discovery process. Id.   \ni.  There is no danger that Respondents-Defendants will not preserve the information \nsought. \n \nRegarding the first factor—the danger of destruction of the evidence— it was not addressed \nby Petitioners-Plaintiffs.  There is, therefore, no allegation or basis to conclude that any relevant \ninformation in Respondents-Defendants’ possession will not be preserved.   \nii.  Expedited discovery will not substantially contribute to the case moving forward. \nExpedited discovery will not substantially contribute to this case moving forward. The \nhearing scheduled for July 1, 2020, is a continuation of the previously conducted hearing on \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order and it is the Petitioners’ burden to \nshow they are entitled to relief. The discovery Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek prior to the hearing is \nlargely irrelevant. Petitioners-Plaintiffs brought a petition for habeas corpus, not a 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 claim.  To be a petition for habeas corpus, their claims must challenge the fact of their \nconfinement, not the past conditions of their confinement.  See e.g., Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. \n637, 643 (2004).  The relief they seek is release, not damages, nor modifications to the Shelby \nCounty Jail’s response to COVID-19. [See ECF No. 50.]  Indeed, this Court has already determined \nthat Petitioners “do not challenge, or seek alteration of, jail conditions.” [ECF No. 38, PageID \n678.] Instead, Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ “challenge is to the fact that they are being confined in a \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 5 of 14    PageID 916\ncommunity facility such as the Jail….and [s]o long as they are confined at the Jail during the \npandemic, Plaintiffs contend that their confinement is unconstitutional.” [ECF No. 38, PageID \n679.]  As Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ counsel explained at the hearing: \nWe are certainly not asking you, Your Honor, to go in and make changes to the \n[jail] conditions. But the reason why we’re not asking for that is because the \nchallenge that we are presenting is to the validity of the confinement . . . . [T]here \nare no conditions at the jail under which Petitioners and the class members who are \nmedically vulnerable or at otherwise at high risk of severe infections or death from \nCOVID-19 can be safe. \n \n[ECF No. 36, PageID 582.] Thus, Petitioners-Plaintiffs do not believe any remedy is available to \nprotect their constitutional rights other than release. See also, Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, \n79, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253 (2005) (explaining that the purpose of a writ of habeas \ncorpus is to obtain release from “unlawful confinement”). \nDespite Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ contention that their claims concern the current fact of their \nconfinement, they demand broad, expedited discovery concerning, not only the current conditions \nof the Shelby County Jail, but also its previous responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. For \nexample, Petitioners seek a copy of “[a]ll written policies adopted or implemented…since March \n12, 2020 regarding management of the COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to the Jail, Detainees, or \nStaff,” all “[d]ocuments reflecting or relating to communications, projections, estimates, studies, \ngraphs, charts, spreadsheets, memos, reports, models, or calculations concerning the actual or \npotential impact of COVID-19,” and “Documents sufficient to show a daily count of the Detainee \npopulation from March 12, 2020 to the date of Your response to these requests.” [ECF No. 57-2.]  \nBased upon these requests, it is also likely that during the depositions they propose to conduct, \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs would question deponents concerning the four-month history of the Shelby \nCounty Jail’s response to COVID-19. While such information could relate to a § 1983 conditions \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 6 of 14    PageID 917\nof confinement claim, it does not relate to the current fact of Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ confinement.  \nAccordingly, such discovery would not contribute to this case moving forward.2  \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs’ proposed expert inspection is likewise well-beyond what is relevant \nfor this matter and would not substantially contribute to the case moving forward. Petitioners-\nPlaintiffs seek permission for their expert to “inspect physical spaces for cleanliness….and to \nassess other issues relevant to the reduction of risk of contracting COVID-19.”  [ECF No. 57-6, \nPageID 893.]  Additionally, they propose their expert be allowed to “assess the adequacy and \naccessibility of cleaning and hygiene supplies…[and] observe and assess the degree to which staff \nimplement the Jail’s policies regarding COVID-19.” [ECF No. 57-6, PageID 893.] Unexplainably, \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs desire to seek whether the jail is “clean,” whether cleaning supplies are \nsupplied, and whether the Jail is following CDC guidelines, when in their own view, the answers \nto those questions are not determinative or relevant to whether their constitutional rights are being \nviolated.  Again, Petitioners-Plaintiffs brought a habeas petition – not a § 1983 claim. Their theory \nis that in light of COVID-19, no conditions in the Jail can satisfy constitutional standards. They \nfail to explain why they now wish to conduct discovery almost solely about the conditions of the \nJail or how such information in any way advances this case.   \nEven if conditions of confinement are relevant to this matter, this case is akin to Nellson v. \nBarnhart, where the District Court of Colorado denied the plaintiffs’ motion for expedited \ndiscovery. In Nellson, the plaintiff, purportedly representing a class of similarly situated inmates, \nalleged that the defendants were not “(1) not screening inmates or staff members for COVID-19, \n \n2 Notably, during the pendency of this case, Petitioners-Plaintiffs have publicly threatened a separate 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nlawsuit against Respondents-Defendants. See https://dailymemphian.com/section/metro/article/14717/aclu-threatens-\nsecond-lawsuit-against-shelby. Petitioners-Plaintiffs should not be allowed to conduct irrelevant discovery in this \nmatter, on an expedited basis, in an attempt to learn information they actually intend to utilize for a future suit. \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 7 of 14    PageID 918\n(2) not testing prisoners for COVID-19, (3) not isolating prisoners who test positive for COVID-\n19, and (4) not preventing infected staff members from working” under the Eighth Amendment. \nNellson, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98112, at *1-2. The plaintiff filed a motion for temporary \nrestraining order and preliminary injunction, requesting the defendants institute screening and \ntesting of inmates and staff. Id. at *2. Subsequently, the plaintiff moved the court for expedited \ndiscovery, seeking, among other requests, communications “between state, regional, and national \nBOP officials on the BOP's response to COVID-19 at [the defendant prison].” Id. at *10-11. The \ncourt denied this request, noting that “[w]hile the facts underlying the[] various requests may be \n‘unusually difficult or impossible’ to obtain without discovery, they are also irrelevant to the \npreliminary matter before the Court….What decisions the BOP could have taken is irrelevant to \nwhether defendants should be required to screen, test, and isolate staff and inmates, or whether \ndefendants are already implementing those measures.” Id. at *11. Here, like in Nellson, Petitioners-\nPlaintiffs’ proposed discovery concerning what steps the Shelby County Jail should or could have \ntaken in response to COVID-19 is irrelevant to the question before the Court – whether the “fact” \nof Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ confinement is constitutional.3 \nFurthermore, to the extent that Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek discovery concerning the current \n“fact” of their confinement or other issues the Court deems relevant to the “fact” of their \nconfinement,  they  have  likewise  failed  to  show  that  expedited  discovery  will  substantially \ncontribute to this case moving forward.  Learning such information would be duplicative in light \nof the Court already appointing Michael Brady to “render an expert opinion on the current health \nand safety of medically vulnerable Plaintiff-detainees at the Shelby County Jail. . . in light of the \n \n3 Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ basis for their contention is that social distancing cannot occur in the Shelby County Jail.  Thus, \neven if the Shelby County Jail fully complied with applicable CDC and other applicable guidelines and standards, \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs’ position is that their constitutional rights would still be violated if social distancing could not \noccur. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 8 of 14    PageID 919\nCOVID-19 pandemic[.]” [ECF No. 56.] Mr. Brady will be granted “unrestricted access to the \nFacility unannounced, and may bring with him laptops or other similar equipment with internet \naccess, cameras, cell phones, writing implements, and any other equipment required to conduct \nhis site visit/s.”  [ECF No. 56, PageID 844.]  He will be permitted to “inspect areas of the facilities \nwithout limitation…[and will] be permitted to review all pertinent Facility and detainee records \nand documents including medical and mental health records, electronic or otherwise, and video \nfootage in connection with his investigation.” [ECF No. 56, PageID 844-45.] He will further be \nallowed to interview “all supervisors and staff…immediately and without undue delay.”  [ECF 56, \n845.] After his inspection, Mr. Brady will prepare a written report and testify before the Court \nconcerning his findings at the upcoming July 1, 2020 hearing.  [ECF No. 56, PageID 845.] \n“Courts should not grant leave without some showing of the necessity for expedited \ndiscovery [as] [t]he court must protect defendants from unfairly expedited discovery.” Waggin’ \nTrain LLC v. Normerica, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110564, *3 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 18, 2009) \n(citing Notaro v. Koch, 95 F.R.D. 403, 405 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)). Here, Petitioners-Plaintiffs fail to \nexplain why expedited discovery is necessary when this Court has already appointed Mr. Brady to \nprovide the Court an opinion on the Jail’s current response to COVID-19. Notably, they fail to \nidentify even a single relevant fact they believe they can discover that Mr. Brady cannot. They \nseek documents, but Mr. Brady will already be allowed access to all relevant documents. They \nseek written interrogatory responses and deposition testimony, but Mr. Brady will already be \nallowed to interview Jail supervisors and staff. They seek to inspect the Jail, but Mr. Brady will \nalready be allowed to do so.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 9 of 14    PageID 920\nPetitioners-Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to show that expedited discovery is \nnecessary to move the case forward even one iota, much less that it is necessary for the case to \nsubstantially move forward. Accordingly, their request for expedited discovery must be denied. \niii.  The discovery sought by Petitioners-Plaintiffs is overly broad, unduly burdensome, \nand prejudicial to Respondents-Defendants. \n \nContrary to Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ assertion, their requests are not narrowly-tailored, and it \nwould in reality be impossible for Respondents-Defendants to fully respond to their requests within \nthe time proposed. In Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ requests for production, Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek \ncountless  documents  generated  since  March  12,  2020,  concerning  Respondents-Defendants \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. [ECF No. 57-2.] For example, Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek \n“[d]ocuments sufficient to show all efforts, measures, or other steps You or the Jail have taken or \nare taking specifically on behalf of Detainees who are ‘high-risk for severe illness from COVID-\n19’ as defined by the CDC.” [ECF No. 57-2, Req. No. 4.] Petitioners-Plaintiffs define “documents” \nbroadly and seek not only hardcopy records, but also “electronic copies of electronic mail [and] \ntext messages….” [ECF No. 57-2, PageID 57-2.] It would be impossible for Respondents-\nDefendants to perform an electronically stored information (“ESI”) search of all Shelby County \nJail custodians’ email accounts and cell phones, identify any potentially responsive documents, \nreview all potentially responsive documents, determine which, if any of said documents would be \nprivileged, prepare any needed privilege log, and then produce to Petitioners-Plaintiffs all of said \nresponsive  documents  within  the  proposed  two-day  time  frame.4  To  the  contrary,  such  an \nundertaking would likely take several weeks, if not longer. \nForcing Respondents-Defendants to participate in a four-day discovery marathon would \n \n4 Petitioners-Plaintiffs propose Respondents-Defendants respond to their proposed written discovery by 5:30 p.m. on \nWednesday, June 24, 2020. [ECF No. 57-1, PageID 861; 57-2, PageID 871.] \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 10 of 14    PageID 921\nlikewise be unduly burdensome on Respondents-Defendants. As addressed at the previous hearing, \nthe Shelby County Jail has two days of extensive COVID-19 testing scheduled during the week of \nJune 22, 2020.  During those two days, in addition to safely operating the Jail, jail staff will devote \nmuch of their time to ensuring detainees can be safely and efficiently tested. Additionally, \ndepending upon the volume of documents Mr. Brady will request from Respondents-Defendants \nand upon the number of interviews that he wishes to conduct, jail staff will also be devoted to \naccommodating Mr. Brady’s requests. Forcing jail staff to additionally participate in written and/or \noral discovery would cause undue burden on the Jail’s ability safely and efficiently operate the \nfacility, provide the scheduled COVID-19 testing, and timely respond to Mr. Brady’s inquiries. \nMoreover, allowing such discovery could likewise interfere with Mr. Brady’s unannounced \ninspection. For example, if Petitioners-Plaintiffs are allowed to conduct depositions, it is likely \nthey would be deposing a witness who at the exact same time Mr. Brady might wish to interview \non-site during his inspection.  \nSimilarly, allowing Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ own expert to conduct his or her own inspection \nof the Jail during the same week that Respondents-Defendants are conducting extensive COVID-\n19 testing and making accommodations for Mr. Brady’s inspection causes an undue burden on \nRespondents-Defendants.  In light of COVID-19, jail staff are already taking numerous additional \nsteps to safely and efficiently operate the jail as well as protect the health of inmates.  Being forced \nto accommodate two separate inspections at the same time that jail staff are already undertaking \nadditional obligations due to COVID-19 would jeopardize jail staff’s ability to efficiently operate \nthe  facility.  Additionally,  because  Mr.  Brady’s  inspection  will  be  unannounced,  allowing \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs access to the Jail via their own expert could result in their expert being present \nduring and interfering with Mr. Brady’s inspection. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 11 of 14    PageID 922\nForcing Respondents-Defendants to arrange for three depositions in addition to preparing \nthe other discovery sought by Petitioners-Plaintiffs would cause an undue burden on Respondents-\nDefendants in other ways. For example, two of the three proposed deponents, Chief Kirk Fields \nand Dr. Donna Randolph, are intricately involved, not only in the day-to-day operations and \nmedical care provided at the Jail, but also in its response to COVID-19.5 Forcing them into \ndepositions with just a few days’ notice creates an undue hardship on Respondents-Defendants to \nensure appropriate staff members are available in their absence.  The third proposed deponent, Dr. \nBruce Randolph, is Shelby County’s Health Officer. Among other many duties, Dr. Randolph \noversees Shelby County, Tennessee’s response to COVID-19.  As part of his duties, Dr. Randolph \nparticipates in regular COVID-19 briefings and advises numerous Shelby County entities on a \ndaily basis. With almost no advanced notice, Petitioners-Plaintiffs seek to depose Dr. Randolph \nwithout regard to his numerous obligations in protecting the health and safety of the citizens of \nShelby County. [See ECF No.  27-5, PageID 476.]  \nIf allowed, Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ discovery will unduly burden Respondents-Defendants \nand will cause them prejudice by affecting Respondents-Defendants’ ability to be fully responsive \nand accommodating to Mr. Brady.  Accordingly, Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ motion must be denied. \niv.  Other  factors  support  denying  Petitioners-Plaintiffs’  request  for  expedited \ndiscovery. \n \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs additionally cite “how far in advance of the typical discovery process \nthe request was made” as a factor for the Court to consider. [ECF No. 57, PageID 853.] While \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs gloss over said factor, it likewise supports denying their motion. This case \nhas been pending since May 20, 2020. [ECF 1.]  When they initially filed their suit, Petitioner-\n \n5 Dr. Donna Randolph is not an employee of Shelby County, Tennessee, and therefore, counsel cannot confirm her \ncurrent ability to even attend the deposition sought by Petitioners-Plaintiffs. \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 12 of 14    PageID 923\nPlaintiffs made no request for expedited discovery. On June 12, 2020, the Court initially set the \ncase for another hearing on Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining order. [ECF \nNo. 45.] Unexplainably, Petitioners-Plaintiffs made no request for expedited discovery until a full \nweek later.  Obviously, in light of the swiftly moving nature of the case, the obligations that have \nbeen imposed on the Respondents, and the continuing obligations on the Respondents and their \ncounsel, a full week is considerable. Had Petitioners-Plaintiffs truly believed that expedited \ndiscovery was necessary, there is no reason they should have waited until Friday, June 19, 2020, \nto file their motion. The effect of such a delay only serves to further burden Respondents-\nDefendants by forcing them to respond to discovery in a much tighter window of time during \nwhich they must also be fully available to accommodate Mr. Brady.6 In light of said delay, \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs cannot support their contention that they are “entitled to expedited discovery \nnow,” and they should not be allowed to force Respondents-Defendants to engage in a four-day \nexpedited discovery process.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Based upon the above and upon the record as a whole, the Court should deny Petitioners-\nPlaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery. \n \n \n \n \n \n6 It is also notable that Petitioners-Plaintiffs did not seek such relief until after they learned counsel, James I. Pentecost, \nhad a family vacation planned beginning on June 24, 2020, the same day they now propose to begin conducting \ndepositions and after they learned counsel, Nathan D. Tilly, had a vacation planned beginning on June 26, 2020, the \nlast day of their proposed depositions. [ECF 47-1; 47-2.]  Additionally, Petitioners-Plaintiffs make their request \nwithout regard to defense counsel’s professional schedules and defense counsel have other matters scheduled this \nweek in other cases.  For example, Mr. Tilly previously scheduled three depositions in another case this week and Mr. \nPentecost as well as Mr. Stokes previously scheduled a mediation in another case this week. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 64   Filed 06/22/20   Page 13 of 14    PageID 924\nRespectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \n      By:   s/Nathan D.

(ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 7-8). Petitioners filed a petition \nfor writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, asking this Court to order them and a \nclass/subclass of other detainees to be released from the Jail because of fear that they may contact \nCOVID-19. (ECF No. 1). Petitioners have also filed a motion for temporary restraining order \nseeking, among other things, “immediate release from incarceration,” and for Respondents to \nproduce within twelve (12) hours of the entry of the Court’s order a list of all Class and Subclass \n \n1 In doing, Respondents rely upon all filings by Respondents, the “Declaration of Kirk Fields,” the “Declaration of the \nHonorable Amy P. Weirich,” the “Declaration of the Honorable John W. Campbell,” the “Declaration of the \nHonorable Christopher Craft,” the “Declaration of Bruce Randolph, M.D., M.P.H.,” the “Declaration of Dr. Donna \nRandolph,” and the entire record of this cause. \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 2 of 21    PageID 347\nmembers as proposed by Petitioners. (ECF No. 2, ¶ 2).  Petitioners further propose that within \ntwenty-four (24) hours, Respondents release all detainees “who are incarcerated solely due to their \ninability to afford a financial condition of release, or solely due to an alleged technical violation \nof probation or parole,” and to “provide a list…noting the basis for any objections to the release \nof the remaining Class and Subclass members.”  (ECF No. 2, ¶¶ 3-4). They recommend that \nRespondents be allowed the opportunity to object to the release of specific detainees based solely \nupon “evidence of a credible risk of pretrial flight or danger to others.”  (ECF No. 2, ¶ 4). \nA.   APPLICABLE POLICIES AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES \n \nAt all times relevant, the Jail has maintained certification by the Tennessee Corrections \nInstitute, as well as accreditation by the American Correctional Association and the National \nCommission on Correctional Health Care. At all relevant times, Respondent adhered to and trained \nits personnel on SCSO’s policies and standard operating procedures concerning “Inmate Medical \nand Mental Healthcare,” “Inmate/Detainee Sick Call,” “Inmate/Detainee Grievance Process,” \n“Inmates Medical Rights,” “Inmates/Detainees Rights,” “Exposure Control Plan Communicable \nDisease,” “Communicable Disease Response,” “Infection Control Program,” “Inmate Medical \nScreening,” and “Inmate Clothing, Bedding, Linen Supplies and Hair Care.” \nB.  RESPONSIBILITY OF MEDICAL TREATMENT \nShelby County contracts with WellPath to provide inmate medical care at its corrections \nfacilities, including the Shelby County Jail.  WellPath personnel are not employees of the SCSO. \nThe contract with WellPath is administered by the Shelby County Health Department.  The Shelby \nCounty Health Department assigns full-time on-site contract monitors at the Shelby County Jail to \nensure WellPath meets it contractual obligations and provides appropriate inmate medical care. \nPer the contract, the Director of Nursing for WellPath oversees all medical care for SCSO facilities \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 3 of 21    PageID 348\nand reports directly to the Shelby County Health Department. \nC.  SCSO’S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 \nIn February of 2020, the SCSO began planning and in March of 2020, the SCSO began \nimplementing procedures in addition to its standard operating procedures and policies to combat \nand prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Jail, which have evolved on an ongoing basis. In \nundertaking such efforts, the SCSO has enhanced its pre-booking screening process for all of its \nfacilities, including the Jail. As such, no detainee is allowed inside a SCSO facility without first \nbeing questioned and screened by a nurse. As part of the enhanced process, the nurse evaluates the \ndetainee, and the detainee’s body temperature is taken. If the individual exhibits COVID-19 \nsymptoms, he must undergo further testing before being admitted into the facility.   \nUpon entrance of a positive/possible positive COVID-19 detainee, all movement in the \nintake area ceases. If it is determined that the detainee is COVID-19 positive, he must proceed to \na separate tent in the sally-port for isolation. All Jail staff in the tent must wear a hazmat suits, \ngloves,  and  masks  before  entering  the  tent.  Officers  in  the  tent  then  undertake  initial \nintake/processing of the COVID-19 positive individual, ensuring that the inmate remains isolated \nfrom all other staff and detainees.  Medical staff must also make a determination as to whether the \ninmate should be hospitalized. If hospitalization is unnecessary, the inmate is escorted to an \nisolation cell away from other inmates or staff. Contact between any known COVID-19 positive \ndetainee and other inmates is strictly prohibited. When leaving the processing area, staff must \nremove the hazmat suit, gloves, and mask for proper disposal. \nAdditionally, upon intake, all inmates are immediately provided a facial mask free of \ncharge and are instructed to wear the mask while in the facility. Inmates are also instructed on \ngeneral CDC guidelines concerning social distancing and other best practices to prevent the spread \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 4 of 21    PageID 349\nof COVID-19. Any inmates who test positive for COVID-19 are immediately isolated from all \nother detainees and housed in a medical cell. Other inmates exposed to an inmate who tests positive \nare also immediately quarantined. Inmates remain in isolation for at least 21-days, if not longer, \ndepending upon their symptoms and whether they continue to test positive for COVID-19. \nTo reinforce the exercise of best practices to prevent and/or mitigate the spread, CDC \nguidance posters are displayed throughout the Jail. These posters provide inmates guidance on best \npractices to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the SCSO televises an informative \nvideo on all televisions throughout the Jail which similarly provides inmates information on \npreventing and mitigating the spread of COVID-19. \nTo that extent, SCSO has also limited movement throughout the Jail and has prohibited \ngroup gatherings. For example, inmates must generally remain in their own housing unit at all \ntimes and cannot generally traverse to and from different areas of the Jail.    \nThe SCSO has also taken steps to prevent the spread by or through its staff. The SCSO has \ndirected its employees to comply with all CDC guidelines concerning combating and preventing \nCOVID-19, including directing staff to practice social distancing by remaining six (6) feet apart \nat all possible times and to wash and sanitize their hands regularly. The SCSO strictly prohibits \nany staff members exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 from coming to work or entering the \nfacility. The SCSO has also strongly discouraged employees from nonessential and personal travel \nand has set a moratorium on all vacation requests and approvals for out-of-town travel purposes \nuntil at least May 31, 2020. Additionally, since March 16, 2020, SCSO employees have been \nallowed to access the facility only through the main entrance of the jail and are no longer allowed \nto enter the facility through the annex door.  All employees must undergo a medical screening \nevery day prior to entering the facility. If an employee exhibits any COVID-19 symptoms, the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 5 of 21    PageID 350\nemployee is prohibited from entering the facility. SCSO has also restricted access in and out of the \nfacility by all employees except for members of management with the Jail Division.   \nThe SCSO has taken further steps to prohibit non-SCSO employees from entering the Jail. \nSince March 27, 2020, the SCSO has suspended all in-person visitations.  Likewise, Jail volunteers \nare no longer allowed access, and attorneys who wish to visit with their clients in the Jail must do \nso via phone, teleconference, or video conference. The SCSO has also suspended all non-essential \nvendors from coming into the Jail except in emergency situations and has limited commissary \ndeliveries to only one day per week.   \nTo further combat and prevent the spread, the SCSO requires all individuals in the Jail to \nwear a facial mask at all times. Any staff who fail to follow said directive are subject to disciplinary \naction, and anyone who is not an employee who refuses to wear a facial mask is denied entry into \nthe facility. Staff who observe an inmate not properly wearing a mask immediately instruct the \ninmate to put his facial mask on.  \nPer the general operating policies and procedures, all inmates have access to medical care \nand can request medical care at any time. In light of COVID-19, inmates are not charged for \nmedical examination if they raise concerns that they are suffering from COVID-related symptoms. \nThe SCSO has also implemented more aggressive cleaning methods within the Jail. \nOfficers disinfect every surface throughout the Jail with BioVex daily. The walking tunnel from \nthe Jail to the courtrooms is also thoroughly cleaned and disinfected daily. Additionally, cleaning \nsupplies are provided for inmates to utilize prior to the use of phones, kiosks, and showers. All \ninmate facial masks are disinfected with BioVex every day immediately after lockdown, and at \nleast once a week, the masks are thoroughly washed by laundry staff.  \nThe SCSO provides all inmates access to hand soap and other hygiene products free of \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 6 of 21    PageID 351\ncharge. Any inmate may ask any officer for more soap or hygiene products at any time, and it is \nimmediately provided to the inmate. The Jail also provides inmates access to disposable gloves in \nfurther effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.   \nIf there is reason to believe a group of detainees in a pod might have been exposed to \nCOVID-19, the Jail will place the entire pod on quarantine. Inmates in a quarantined pod cannot \nleave the pod or traverse through other areas of the facility. Medical staff at the Jail regularly \nmonitor and take the bodily temperatures of all such quarantined detainees multiple times a day.  \nQuarantined pods remain on quarantine for a minimum of fourteen (14) days and until medical \nstaff determine that is reasonably safe to take the pod off of quarantine. \nImportantly, in implementing procedures to combat and prevent the spread of COVID-19, \nthe SCSO has worked closely with its medical contract partner, WellPath, as well as the Shelby \nCounty  Health  Department.  The  senior  leadership  in  the  SCSO,  Shelby  County  Health \nDepartment, and WellPath meet two times per week to obtain updates concerning the COVID-19 \npandemic as it relates specifically to the SCSO’s correctional facilities and to discuss what further \nsteps, if any, the SCSO can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The SCSO has also \nimplemented and follows specific guidelines and procedures recommended by WellPath. \nThe maximum capacity of the Shelby County Jail is 2,800. The  SCSO  detains  criminal \ndefendants as ordered by Tennessee Criminal and General Sessions Judges. Thus, the SCSO has \ncontrol whatsoever over the total number of detainees who are housed in the Jail. Notwithstanding, \nthe SCSO has worked with the District Attorney’s Office and the Public Defender’s Office to \nlower the Jail population. Even before the pandemic, Sheriff Bonner hired Mischelle Best to serve \nas the SCSO’s Expeditor. In her position as Expeditor, Best works with inmates, prosecutors, \npublic defenders, and other outside services to identify detainees with minor charges and/or \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 21    PageID 352\nmedical conditions to expedite their cases and possible releases. \nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, the SCSO has increased its efforts to reduce the Jail \npopulation. During the pandemic, the SCSO has coordinated with law enforcement agencies and \nrequested that, in light of COVID-19, they issue misdemeanor summonses instead of making \nphysical arrests, when possible. The SCSO has received tremendous cooperation from those \nagencies. Additionally, the SCSO, the District Attorney’s Office, the Public Defender’s Office, \nand other agencies have worked together in accelerating the cases for detainees with serious \nmedical issues that are sixty (60) years and older, and those with misdemeanor or Level D & E \nfelonies, in an effort to get those detainees out of Jail quickly. Further, the District Attorney \nGeneral has aggressively worked towards bringing those criminal cases to a resolution to obtain \nthe release of even more detainees.  \nNotably, the population in the Jail has significantly declined since the initial COVID-19 \noutbreak.  On January 1, 2020, the population at the Shelby County Jail was over 2,500.  On April \n1, 2020, the population of the Shelby County Jail was 2,095. As of today, the population at the \nShelby County Jail has decreased to 1,877.  \nSince March, 160 inmates at the Shelby County Jail have tested positive for COVID-19, \nand 154 of those inmates have fully recovered.  The Jail currently has only four (4) detainees who \nare medically isolated from all other detainees while they recover from the virus. None of those \nindividuals require hospitalization.   \nD.  PLAINTIFFS-PETITIONERS \n  i.  Michael Edgington (“Edgington”) \n  Petitioner Edgington is being detained on two (2) Class A felony charges involving \nconspiracy  to  manufacture/deliver/sell  controlled  substance  (cocaine)  and  trafficking  high \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 8 of 21    PageID 353\namounts of cocaine. Edgington is one (1) of thirty-eight (38) individuals indicted in a trafficking \ncase and is accused of distributing a controlled substance within a school zone. Edgington’s bond \nwas set at $500,000.00. Edgington has not requested a bond reduction. \n  Edgington is currently housed on the third floor of the Jail. His assigned pod has the \ncapacity to house forty-three (43) individuals. Thirty-eight (38) individuals are currently housed \nin said pod. No individual housed within Edgington’s assigned pod has tested positive for COVID-\n19. Edgington does not have an assigned cell mate currently. Laundry services are available to the \nindividuals assigned within Edgington’s assigned pod at least two (2) times per week. \n  ii.  Favian Busby (“Busby”) \n  Petitioner Busby is being detained on numerous criminal charges including involving \nmanufacture/delivery/sale  of  cocaine,  ecstasy,  methamphetamine,  oxycodone,  alprazolam, \nmarijuana, and other controlled substances and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Busby’s \nbond was set at $239,000.00 in relation to the drug charges and $25,000.00 in relation to the felon \nin possession charge. Busby has not requested a bond reduction. \nBusby is currently assigned to a pod in the Jail Annex that has the capacity to house sixty-\ntwo (62) individuals. Forty-one (41) individuals are currently housed in said pod. Busby does not \nhave an assigned cell mate and has access to a washer, dryer, and gym within his pod, whereby he \nmaintains the ability to launder his personal items at his discretion. \nSTANDARD \nA temporary restraining order “is an extraordinary remedy designed for the limited purpose \nof preserving the status quo pending further proceedings on the merits….” Cross v. Mnuchin, 2019 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 171703, *1 (W.D. Tenn. Oct. 3, 2019). “The standard for determining whether \nto grant a temporary restraining order is the same as the standard for determining whether to grant \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 9 of 21    PageID 354\na preliminary injunction.” Am. Home Shield Corp. v. Specter, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178465, *2 \n(W.D.  Tenn.  April  3,  2019).  “Generally,  the  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  establishing  his \nentitlement to a preliminary injunction.” Id. (citing Jones v. Caruso, 569 F.3d 258, 265 (6th Cir. \n2009)). Accordingly, when evaluating the merits of a motion for preliminary injunction, the Court \nmust balance: “(1) whether the movant is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the movant \nwill suffer irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction; (3) whether the injunction will cause \nsubstantial harm to others; and (4) whether the injunction will serve the public interest.” Id. (citing \nBradfield v. Perry, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 24358, at *2-3 (6th Cir. Nov. 30, 2017)). \nLAW & ARGUMENT \nA.  PETITIONERS ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \nThe availability of a TRO or preliminary injunction is inextricably intertwined with the \nmerits of the underlying claim. For this reason, one of the principal factors in determining a \nplaintiff’s entitlement to relief is the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits of his \nunderlying claims. See United States v. Contents of Accounts, 629 F.3d 601, 606 (6th Cir. 2011). \nAccordingly, a basic showing necessary for obtaining a temporary restraining order is that there \nmust be some relationship between the conduct giving rise to the claims in the complaint and the \ninjury sought to be prevented. See Colvin v. Caruso, 605 F.3d 282, 299-300 (6th Cir. 2010); \nBeasley v. Westbrooks, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152103, *5 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 9, 2017).  \ni.  Petitioners are not likely to succeed on the merits because their habeas petition is \nimproper. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit has held that when the proponent of the injunctive relief has no chance \nof success on the merits of the claim, the Court may dismiss the motion without considering the \nother three factors. See Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th Cir. 1997). \nFailure to do so is reversible error. See id.; Sandison v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 10 of 21    PageID 355\n64 F.3d 1026, 1037 (6th Cir. 1995). Here, as set forth in Respondents-Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss, the petition is improper because (1) Petitioners failed to exhaust their state law remedies \nprior to bringing suit, and (2) a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is not the proper \nvehicle for a prisoner to challenge his conditions of confinement.   \nMoreover, any attempt by Petitioners to claim state law remedies are unavailable would be \nwithout merit.  In-person court proceedings necessary to protect constitutional rights of criminal \ndefendants including bond-related matters and plea agreements for incarcerated individuals have \nnot been suspended in Tennessee.  Indeed, Criminal Courts in Shelby County have remained open \nand have regularly heard motions, petitions, and requests from pre-trial detainees to be released \nfrom incarceration and/or to modify their bond amounts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Further, \npursuant to Tennessee law, criminal judges possess the authority and discretion to release a pre-\ntrial  detainee  under  certain  conditions,  including  an  inmate’s  medical  condition  and/or \nvulnerability to contracting a serious medical condition while in Jail, if they believe in light of the \ncircumstances such release is appropriate. \nBecause Petitioners’ petition is improper, Petitioners cannot succeed on the merits, and as \na result, this Court should deny Petitioners’ Motion for a temporary restraining order.  \nii.  Petitioners are not likely to succeed on the merits because the Shelby County \nSheriff’s Office has not acted with deliberate indifference.  \n \n“To show a likelihood of prevailing on the merits, the [party seeking the injunction] must \nshow the likely existence of a constitutional violation causally related to the result sought to be \nenjoined.” L.P. Acquisition Co. v. Tyson, 772 F.2d 201, 205 (6th Cir. 1985) (quoting Martin-\nMarietta Corp. v. Bendix Corp., 690 F.2d 558, 565 (6th Cir. 1982)).  Here, Petitioners bring their \nclaims against the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff Floyd Bonner, Jr., in his official \ncapacity.  “Official capacity suits…‘generally represent only another way of pleading an action \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 11 of 21    PageID 356\nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.’” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-68 \n(1985). To show a constitutional violation against a governmental entity, a plaintiff must prove \nthat some “policy or custom” caused the alleged constitutional deprivation. Monell v. New York \nCity Dept. of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978).  \nPetitioners allege that their Fourteenth Amendment rights are being violated due to the \nconditions of their confinement. (ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 52-61). The Fourteenth Amendment’s due process \nclause protects pretrial detainees from cruel and unusual punishments. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n520, 535 n.16 (1979). Fourteenth Amendment due process claims “are analyzed under the same \nrubric as Eighth Amendment claims brought by prisoners.” Richmond v. Huq, 885 F.3d 928, 938 \n(6th Cir. 2018); Villegas v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 709 F.3d 563, 568 (6th Cir. 2013); Cooper \nv. Montgomery Cty., 768 F. App’x. 385, 392 (6th Cir. 2019). In order to state a claim that prison \nconditions violate the Constitution, a pretrial detainee-plaintiff must allege that he has been \nsubjected to deprivations so serious that he was deprived of the “minimal civilized measure of \nlife’s necessities” and that jail officials acted wantonly, with deliberate indifference to his serious \nneeds. Richmond v. Settles, 450 F. App’x 448, 454-55 (6th Cir. 2011). Allegations of temporary \ninconveniences are insufficient to state a claim. Dellis v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 257 F.3d 508, 511 \n(6th Cir. 2001). The Supreme Court has noted that jail conditions may be “restrictive and even \nharsh,” and the “Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons.” Rhodes v Chapman, 452 US \n337, 349 (1981). \nTo raise a cognizable constitutional claim for deliberate indifference to an inmate’s safety, \nan inmate must make a two-part showing: (1) the alleged mistreatment was objectively serious; \nand (2) the defendant subjectively ignored the risk to the inmate’s safety. Farmer v Brennan, 511 \nU.S.  825,  834  (1994).  In  the  context  of  conditions  of  confinement  claims,  only  “extreme \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 12 of 21    PageID 357\ndeprivations” can be characterized as punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Hudson \nv. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1992). \nIn regard to the second element discussed above, the United States Supreme Court has held \nthat in order for a plaintiff to be successful in his deliberate indifference claim, he must show the \nprison official possessed a state of mind “more blameworthy than negligence.” Id. The Farmer \nCourt also noted that “acting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of \nserious harm to a prisoner is the equivalent of recklessly disregarding the risk.” Id. Importantly, \nthe reckless standard is not one of objectivity. Id at 837-38. Instead, a plaintiff must show the \nprison officer “consciously disregarded” a substantial risk of harm. Id at 839. The Sixth Circuit \nhas likewise acknowledged that a plaintiff must show defendant subjectively ignored a risk that \nwas objectively serious. Leary v Livingston County, 528 F.3d 438, 442 (6th Cir. 2008).  The prison \nofficial’s state of mind must evince “deliberateness tantamount to intent to punish.” Miller v. \nCalhoun Cty., 408 F.3d 803, 812-13 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Horn v. Madison County Fiscal Court, \n22 F.3d 653, 660 (6th Cir. 1994)). “[A]n official’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he \nshould have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot under our cases be \ncondemned as the infliction of punishment.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838. Deliberate indifference is \nmore than “mere negligence.” Bowman v Corrections Corp of Am, 350 F.3d 537, 544 (6th Cir. \n2003). It is tantamount to a finding of criminal recklessness. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. In the prison \nsetting, it requires a showing “approaching total unconcern for the prisoner’s welfare.” Rosario v \nBrown, 670 F.3d 816, 821 (7th Cir. 2012). \nIn  Money  v.  Pritzker,  the  Northern  District  of  Illinois  recently  considered  similar \nallegations when it determined that the petitioners had no chance of success: \nClearly Defendants are trying, very hard, to protect inmates against the virus and to \ntreat  those who  have  contracted  it.  The  record  simply  does  not  support  any \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 13 of 21    PageID 358\nsuggestion that Defendants have turned the kind of blind eye and deaf ear to a \nknown problem that would indicate “total unconcern” for the inmates’ welfare. \nRosario, 670 F3d at 821. Nor would the record support any claim that Defendants \nlack  a  plan  for  implementing  exactly  what  Plaintiffs  have  requested  – \nindividualized  decisions  on  release  through  a  panoply  of  vehicles  guided  by \nadministrative discretion. It may not be the plan that the Court would choose, if it \nwere sufficiently informed to offer an opinion on the subject. But the Eighth \nAmendment does not afford litigants and courts an avenue for de novo review of \nthe decisions of prison officials, and the actions of Defendants here in the face of \nthe COVID-19 easily pass constitutional muster.  \n \nMoney v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63599 at *18 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020). \n \nAs outlined above, Respondents have adhered to and trained SCSO personnel on numerous \npolicies and operating procedures including, but not limited to, “Inmate Medical and Mental \nHealthcare,”  “Inmate/Detainee  Sick  Call,”  “Inmate/Detainee  Grievance  Process,”  “Inmates \nMedical Rights,” “Inmates/Detainees Rights,” “Exposure Control Plan Communicable Disease,” \n“Communicable Disease Response,” “Infection Control Program,” “Inmate Medical Screening,” \nand “Inmate Clothing, Bedding, Linen Supplies and Hair Care.” Additionally, Respondents have \nundertaken numerous measures to combat and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Jail \nincluding, but not limited to, enhancing detainee intake screenings, encouraging social distancing, \nminimizing movement in and around the jail, requiring all employees and inmates to wear masks, \nproviding disinfectants through the facility for use by employees and inmates alike, enhancing \ncleaning procedures throughout the jail, suspending in-person visitations, informing inmates on \nbest practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19, quarantining inmates who have come in contact \nwith COVID-19 positively tested inmates, isolating inmates who have tested positive for COVID-\n19, and implementing and following ever changing CDC guidelines concerning the prevention and \nmitigation of the spread of COVID-19. Said policies, protocols, and measures meet the community \nstandard of medical care in a correctional setting, have successfully mitigated its spread, and have \ncreated a safe environment for detainees/inmates to reside in while incarcerated in the Jail in light \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 14 of 21    PageID 359\nof the current COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, Petitioners are not likely to succeed on the \nmerits because they have not and cannot establish that the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office has \nacted with deliberate indifference. \niii.  Petitioners are not likely to succeed on the merits because the Shelby County \nSheriff’s Office has not discriminated against Plaintiffs-Petitioners and/or any \nproposed Class/Subclass members. \n \nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), a disabled individual who otherwise \nis qualified may not be excluded from participating in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to \ndiscrimination under, a public program, because of the individual’s disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \nUnder the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), an individual may not be denied access to or discriminated \nagainst with respect to a federally-funded program or activity “solely by reason of” the individual’s \ndisability. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). “Inmates alleging claims under the ADA and the RA must show \nprison officials took the challenged actions because of the inmate’s alleged disability.” Finfrock \nv. Mohr, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192024 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 5, 2019) (emphasis added)). \nWithin their Petition, Petitioners have outlined the dangers of COVID-19 and have asserted \nthat Respondents have failed to take appropriate measures to mitigate its spread and to protect all \ndetainees/inmates incarcerated within the Jail. (See ECF No. 1). However, Petitioners have failed \nto  allege  sufficient  facts,  much  less  offered  substantive  evidence,  to  establish  that  any  of \nRespondents’ officials took any specific actions against Petitioners because of their proposed \ndisabilities. Accordingly, Petitioners are not likely to succeed on the merits because they have not \nand cannot establish that Respondents discriminated against them in violation of the ADA or RA. \nB.  PETITIONERS CANNOT ESTABLISH IRREPARABLE HARM. \nIn order to obtain an injunction, a “plaintiff must demonstrate, by clear and convincing \nevidence, actual irreparable harm or the existence of an actual threat of injury.” Patio Enclosures, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 15 of 21    PageID 360\nInc. v. Herbst, 39 Fed. App’x 964, 969 (6th Cir. 2002) (internal punctuation omitted). The harm \nmust be actual and imminent, not speculative or unsubstantiated. See Abney v. Amgen, Inc., 443 \nF.3d 540, 552 (6th Cir. 2006). Here, neither Petitioner claims to have COVID-19.  Further, neither \nPetitioner claims that they even have contact with anyone who is positive for COVID-19. They \nsimply  assume  that  they  could  be  in  contact  with  other  detainees  with  COVID-19.  Mere \nassumptions do not meet the clear and convincing standard. \nFurthermore, every detainee in the Shelby County Jail is confined pursuant to a court order \nor judicial findings justifying detention.  Pursuant to Tennessee law, the Sheriff may not and cannot \nrelease them. Only a judge can do that.  Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Judges in Shelby \nCounty, with the assistance of the SCSO, the Shelby County District Attorney’s Office, the Public \nDefender’s Office, and other agencies, have worked together to expedite the release of detainees, \nincluding medically vulnerable detainees.  Neither the SCSO, nor the local judiciary is ignoring \nthe risks posed by COVID-19.  Petitioners have simply elected to forego their state court remedies \nentirely in order to seek an emergency injunction from federal court. Because Petitioners have \navailable remedies and because the SCSO, along with numerous other local agencies, are actively \nengaged in the preventing the spread of COVID-19, Petitioners have not and will not suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. \nC.   PETITIONERS’ REQUESTED RELIEF COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL HARM TO OTHERS \nAND WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. \n \ni.  Ordering the categorical release of the proposed detainees is detrimental to the \npublic interest.  \n \nOrdering categorical release of the proposed detainees, with no regard for their risk to \nsociety upon release, would be detrimental to the public interest. The named Petitioners in this \ncase are both being held on serious felony charges.  Edgington is being detained on two (2) Class \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 16 of 21    PageID 361\nA felony charges involving conspiracy to manufacture/deliver/sell controlled substance (cocaine) \nand trafficking high amounts of cocaine.  Similarly, Busby is being detained on multiple criminal \ncharges, including Class B felonies, involving manufacture/delivery/sale of cocaine, ecstasy, \nmethamphetamine, oxycodone, alprazolam, marijuana, and other controlled substances, and being \na felon in possession of a firearm. The proposed class likewise is in no way limited by the \nseriousness of the proposed class members’ pending criminal charges. \nTennessee  law  provides  that  Tennessee  courts  must  consider  numerous  factors  in \ndetermining whether a pretrial detainee should be released and whether and for what amount bond \nshould be set: \n(1) The defendant’s length of residence in the community; (2) The defendant’s \nemployment status and history, and financial condition; (3) The defendant’s family \nties  and  relationships;  (4)  The  defendant’s  reputation,  character  and  mental \ncondition; (5) The defendant’s prior criminal record, including prior releases on \nrecognizance or bail; (6) The identity of responsible members of the community \nwho will vouch for defendant's reliability; (7) The nature of the offense and the \napparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence, insofar as these factors \nare relevant to the risk of nonappearance; and (8) Any other factors indicating the \ndefendant’s ties to the community or bearing on the risk of willful failure to appear. \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115(b). A court must carefully consider these factors when deciding \nwhether “a release will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.”  Id.  Absent a \nshowing that conditions on a release on recognizance will reasonably assure the appearance of the \ndefendant as required, the magistrate should require bail. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-117. Thus, \nTennessee  law  provides  that  judges  must  make  a  specific,  individualized  assessment  of  a \ndetainee’s flight risk and danger to society in setting their conditions of confinement or conditions \nof release.  This Court should presume that Petitioners, as well as any other potential petitioners-\nplaintiffs, are being detained for a good reason, as state judicial officers have conducted individual \nassessments of them and applied statutory factors in order to set their respective bonds accordingly.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 17 of 21    PageID 362\nA federal court usurping the state courts’ thorough assessment in determining conditions of release \ncertainly goes against the public interest. \nii.  Ordering the categorical release of the proposed detainees violates the rights of \nvictims of violent crimes as secured by the Tennessee Constitution.  \n \nOver the past few decades, many states have amended their constitutions and passed laws \naffording victims various rights during criminal proceedings, including the right to fair and \ncompassionate treatment, the right to be kept informed of the proceeding, and many others. See \nPayton v. State, 266 So. 3d 630, 640-641 (Miss. 2019) (collecting cases).  Tennessee is no \nexception.  In fact, the Tennessee Constitution provides to the victims of crimes certain basic \nconstitutional rights.   Tenn. Const. art. I § 35.  The applicable constitutional provision sets out \neight specific rights for victims, including the right to “[t]he right to be heard, when relevant, at all \ncritical stages of the criminal justice process as defined by the General Assembly,” “the right to be \ninformed of all proceedings, and of the release, transfer or escape of the accused or convicted \nperson,” and “[t]he right to be present at all proceedings where the defendant has the right to be \npresent.” Id.; see also Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-38-101 to 40-38-117; State v. Mutory, 581 S.W.3d \n741, 749 (Tenn. 2019).  \nBy seeking the release of unknown detainees via a temporary restraining order in federal \ncourt, Petitioners attempt to avoid the rights of victims as protected by the Tennessee Constitution.  \nNo victims of the potential class members have been informed of this proceeding and have not had \nthe opportunity to appear.  Indeed, pursuant to the rights afforded victims under the Tennessee \nConstitution, failure to allow victims of the proposed class a voice prior to releasing the proposed \nclass members potentially violates Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (requiring the \njoinder of parties who claim an interest relating the subject of the action when disposing of the \naction in the person’s absence would impair or impede the person’s ability to protect the interest).  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 18 of 21    PageID 363\nMoreover, releasing said class members without any heed to the rights of victims as protected \nunder the Tennessee Constitution certainly goes against the public interest in protecting the rights \nof victims. \niii.  Ordering the categorical release of the proposed detainees violates federalism and \nthe separation of powers.  \n \nGiven the extraordinary nature of the injunctive relief that Petitioners seek, the Court \nshould abstain pursuant to Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976), where the Supreme Court \ninstructed that to obtain injunctive relief on a matter traditionally reserved to the discretion of a \nstate or local government agency, a plaintiff must overcome the steep hurdle set by “the well-\nestablished rule that the Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the \n‘dispatch of its own internal affairs.’” Id. at 378-79. In such cases, federal courts are to issue \ninjunctions “sparingly, and only in a clear and plain case.” Id. at 378. \nThe considerations of federalism and comity underlying Rizzo weigh especially heavily \nwhen considering the administration of a corrections facilities. Federal courts should be hesitant \nto direct states how to operate their state facilities because doing so goes against the public interest \nin allowing the state legislative and executive branches to control their operation. Bell v. Wolfish, \n441 U.S. 520, 548 (1979). Indeed, “the operation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the \nprovince of the Legislative and Executive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.”  Id. \nCourts must accord prison administrators “wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution \nof policies and practices.” Ward v. Dyke, 58 F.3d 271, 273 (6th Cir. 1995). Thus, where a prison \ninmate seeks an order enjoining state prison official, the court should proceed with the utmost care \nand must recognize the unique nature of the prison setting. See Kendrick v. Bland, 740 F.2d 432, \n438, n. 3 (6th Cir. 1984). As recognized by the Supreme Court, “[i]t is difficult to imagine an \nactivity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 19 of 21    PageID 364\nlaws, regulations, and procedures, than the administration of its prisons…Since these internal \nproblems of state prisons involve issues so peculiarly within state authority and expertise, the \nStates have an important interest in not being bypassed in the correction of those problems.” \nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491–92 (1973). \nIn Money, the Court also discussed its concerns over request from petitioners to be released \nfrom incarceration due to the COVID-19 outbreak: \nPlaintiffs’ motion also raises serious concerns under core principles of federalism \nand the separation of powers, especially given their request for sweeping relief in \nthe form of a mandatory injunction. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 51 (1990) \n(“[O]ne of the most important considerations governing the exercise of equitable \npower is a proper respect for the integrity and function of local government \ninstitutions.”). The Supreme Court repeatedly has cautioned that federal courts \nmust tread lightly when it comes to questions of managing prisons, particularly \nstate prisons. The Court has gone so far as to opine that “[i]t is difficult to imagine \nan activity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately \nbound up with state laws, regulations, and procedures, than the administration of \nprisons.” Preiser, 411 U.S. at 492-92; see also Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 85, \n107 S. Ct. 2254, 96 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1987) (“[W]here a state penal system is involved, \nfederal courts have * * * additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate \nprison authorities.”); Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 229, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. \nEd. 2d 451 (1976) (“Federal courts do not sit to supervise state prisons, the \nadministration of which is of acute interest to the States.”). \n \nThere  are  serious  separation  of  powers  concerns,  too,  because  running  and \noverseeing prisons is traditionally the province of the executive and legislative \nbranches. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85 (“Running a prison is an inordinately \ndifficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of \nresources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and \nexecutive branches of government. Prison administration is, moreover, a task that \nhas been committed to the responsibility of those branches, and separation of \npowers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint.”). The judiciary is ill-\nequipped to manage decisions about how best to manage any inmate population—\nlet alone a statewide population of tens of thousands of people scattered across more \nthan a dozen facilities. And the concern about institutional competence is especially \ngreat where, as here, there is an ongoing, fast-moving public health emergency. \n \nMoney, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63599 at *53-55. \nThe SCSO, along with other law enforcement agencies in Shelby County, have taken \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27   Filed 05/26/20   Page 20 of 21    PageID 365\nconsiderable steps to reduce the jail population at the Jail. They have  already focused on \naccelerating the criminal cases of detainees with less serious charges and detainees 60 years old \nand older as ordered by the Tennessee Supreme Court. As a result, the population at the Jail has \ndecreased by nearly 700 inmates since the beginning of this year. As in Money, this Court’s \nintervention would violate core principles of federalism and the separation of powers especially in \nlight of the SCSO and other agencies already proactively taking steps to reduce the jail population.  \nSuch an action is unnecessary and would be detrimental to the public’s interest in allowing the \nState of Tennessee and local County officials to administer their own corrections facilities.    \nCONCLUSION \nRespondents respectfully request that the Court enter an order denying Petitioners’ Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order. \nRespectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \n      By:   s/Nathan D.

Plaintiffs seek entry of an order (a) granting \npreliminary approval of the settlement embodied in the Proposed Consent Decree and the \nSettlement Agreement; (b) approving the forms of notice; (c) establishing a procedure for \nproviding notice of the Settlement and Proposed Consent Decree to members of the Class and \nSubclass and affording them an opportunity to object; and (d) setting a date and time for a \nfairness hearing approximately 5 weeks from the date the Court grants this Motion. \nFor the following reasons, the Motion is GRANTED.  However, the Parties are \ninstructed to note the Court’s addition to the documents to be made available to Class members, \nif requested. \nI.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs brought this case as a class action, seeking declarative and injunctive relief \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 2 of 10    PageID 3233\nand/or a writ of habeas corpus under 48 U.S.C. § 2241 as well Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Rehab Act”).  The case \narises from concerns about Plaintiffs’ safety while detained in the Shelby County Jail (“the Jail”) \nduring the current pandemic caused by COVID-19.  (ECF Nos. 1, 50.)  Defendants filed a \nmotion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety.  (ECF No. 25.)  On June 10, 2020, the Court \ndenied Defendants’ motion and certified a Class and Subclass of medically vulnerable and \ndisabled individuals detained pretrial at the Jail.  (ECF No. 38.)  The Court defined the Class and \nSubclass as follows: \n  The Class consists of all: \n1.  People 65 years and older; \n2.  People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma (including chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic \nbronchitis), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis); \n3.  People who have serious heart conditions (including heart failure, coronary artery \ndisease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies and pulmonary hypertension); \n4.  People who are immunocompromised (including cancer treatment, smoking, bone \nmarrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or \nAIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening \nmedications); \n5.  People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher); \n6.  People with diabetes; \n7.  People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis; \n8.  People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis; and  \n9.  People with hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. \nThe subclass consists of: \nAll persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during \nthe COVID19 pandemic who are at increased risk of COVID-19 \ncomplications or death because of disabilities as defined in the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The \nSubclass includes everyone in the Class except those people who are \nvulnerable solely due to age or BMI. People with all other conditions listed in \nparagraph (1) above are people with disabilities as defined under federal law. \n \n(Id. at PageID 690-91.)   \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 3 of 10    PageID 3234\nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction,1 in which they sought urgent habeas \nand injunctive relief.  Owing to a pronounced gap in the Parties’ descriptions of confinement \nconditions at the Jail, the Court appointed expert Mike Brady as an Independent Inspector.  After \nMr. Brady submitted a report to the Court, about which he testified at a hearing on July 1, 2020, \nand the Parties engaged in expedited discovery, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on July 10 \nand 13, where both Parties presented proof.  (ECF No. 124 at PageID 2804.)  The Court found \nthat, while Plaintiffs demonstrated many failures related to the way in which they were being \nconfined, these failures were capable of being remedied (indeed, some already had been) and the \nlikelihood of success on the merits was not strong.  Therefore, the Motion was denied.  (See id.) \nThe Court then conducted a Scheduling Conference to discuss the next stages of the \nlitigation.  The Parties began their pursuit of more discovery, and Plaintiffs filed a Motion to \nAmend the Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 135), and Motion to Modify Class Certification \nOrder, (ECF No. 136).2   \nOn December 28, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Joint Notice of Settlement.  (ECF No. 160.)  \nFollowing execution of the Release and Settlement Agreement (“the Agreement”), the Parties \nfiled the instant Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Settlement and Permission to Post \nClass Notice.  (ECF No. 161.)  The Agreement integrates the Proposed Consent Decree (“the \nDecree”), which details the Parties’ agreements on specific policies and protocols concerning the \nfollowing: (1) independent inspections and reporting; (2) ventilation; (3) testing, isolation, and \nquarantine for COVID-19; (4) hygiene and personal protective equipment; (5) social distancing; \n \n1 As explained in its August 7, 2020, Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction, the Court construed Plaintiffs’ emergency motion as one for preliminary injunction, \nrather than for temporary restraining order.  (ECF No. 124 at PageID 2801.) \n \n2 Both Motions are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, given this proposed resolution. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 4 of 10    PageID 3235\nand (6) enforcement and modification.  (See ECF No. 161-2.) \nII.  Analysis \nA.  Preliminary Settlement Approval \nThe Parties seek preliminary approval of the Agreement under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23.   Rule 23(e)(1)(B)(i) directs a court to determine, at the preliminary approval \nstage, whether it “will likely be able to ... approve the proposal under Rule 23(e)(2).”  Under \nRule 23(e)(2), a court must review whether the proposed settlement is “fair, reasonable, and \nadequate after considering” the following four factors:   \n(A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class; \n(B) the proposal was negotiated at arm's length; \n(C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account: \n(i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; \n(ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, \nincluding the method of processing class-member claims; \n(iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of \npayment; and \n(iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and \n(D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(A)-(D); Fitzgerald v. P.L. Mktg., Inc., No. 217CV02251SHMCGC, \n2020 WL 7764969, at *11 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 13, 2020) (explaining that, effective December 1, \n2018, Rule 23(e) sets out “a new rubric” of four factors to consider when determining whether to \ngrant preliminary approval of a class action settlement) (quoting Day v. AMC Corp., No. 5:17-\ncv-183, 2019 WL 3977253, at *3 (E.D. Ky. July 26, 2019); Fitzgerald v. P.L. Mktg., Inc., No. \n217CV02251SHMCGC, 2020 WL 3621250, at *4 n.1 (W.D. Tenn. July 2, 2020).  The Court \nconsiders each factor below. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 5 of 10    PageID 3236\n1.  Adequate Representation and Arm’s Length Negotiation \nThe first two factors under Rule 23(e)(2)—adequate representation and whether the \nproposal was negotiated at arm's length—“identify matters that might be described as \n‘procedural’ concerns.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2), 2018 Advisory Committee Notes. Addressing \nthose factors, the Advisory Committee offered the following guidance: \n[T]he focus at this point is on the actual performance of counsel acting on behalf \nof the class. \n \nThe information submitted under Rule 23(e)(1) may provide a useful starting \npoint in assessing these topics. For example, the nature and amount of discovery \nin this or other cases, or the actual outcomes of other cases, may indicate whether \ncounsel negotiating on behalf of the class had an adequate information base. The \npendency of other litigation about the same general subject on behalf of class \nmembers may also be pertinent. The conduct of the negotiations may be important \nas well. For example, the involvement of a neutral or court-affiliated mediator or \nfacilitator in those negotiations may bear on whether they were conducted in a \nmanner that would protect and further the class interests. Particular attention \nmight focus on the treatment of any award of attorney's fees, with respect to both \nthe manner of negotiating the fee award and its terms. \n \nId. \nHere, Class Counsel has adequately represented the Classes.  The Parties engaged in \nexpedited initial discovery, and the Court held numerous hearings involving testimony from the \nIndependent Inspector and six witnesses following that initial discovery.  (ECF No. 161 at \nPageID 3189.)  Following the Court’s ruling on the preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs sought to \nadd another claim, and the Parties were prepared to continue their discovery efforts if settlement \ndiscussions were not fruitful.  (See ECF Nos. 147-155.)   \nIn addition, the Proposed Decree imposes multiple protective measures for Plaintiffs \nmoving forward, which were the focus of this litigation from the beginning.  Specifically:  \nFirst, it requires the Jail to provide regular reporting regarding the population of \nthe Jail and the impact of COVID-19 on the Jail’s population. See Ex. B at ¶¶ 4–\n5. Second, the Decree calls for unannounced inspections at regular intervals by \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 6 of 10    PageID 3237\nthe Court-appointed Independent Inspector. The Independent Inspector is \nempowered to conduct inspections commensurate and in accordance with the \nCourt’s June 18, 2020 Order, ECF No. 56. In addition, the Independent Inspector \nwill monitor the continuing work of the Jail’s Expeditor to evaluate Class and \nSubclass members for consideration of release on less restrictive conditions other \nthan detention. See id. at ¶ 8. Pursuant to the terms of the Decree, Defendants are \nobligated to use their best efforts to implement the recommendations of the \nIndependent Inspector or to provide a written explanation for why, despite using \ntheir best efforts, Defendants are unable to do so. The Independent Inspector will \nopine in subsequent visits whether Defendants have undertaken their best efforts.  \n \nIn addition, the Decree provides machinery to ensure that the ventilation and air \nflow in the Jail is safe, see id. at ¶ 13, provisions to ensure that there is adequate \ntesting for COVID-19 in the Jail, reporting of the results of that testing, and \nappropriate quarantining procedures, see id. at ¶¶ 14–18, and it ensures that Class \nand Subclass members will continue to receive adequate hygiene and personal \nprotective equipment. See id. at ¶ 19. Further, the Decree ensures that the \nIndependent Inspector will pay particular attention to the Jail’s efforts to \nmaximize social distancing. See id. at ¶ 20. \n \nThe parties have also agreed that they will endeavor to resolve any dispute \nregarding the Decree promptly and will only have recourse to the Court in the \nevent of an emergency or if they cannot reach a resolution themselves. \nIndependently, the underlying case will be stayed upon entry of the Decree unless \nand until Plaintiffs seek enforcement of the Decree. This mechanism provides \nfurther comfort to Plaintiffs that Defendants will endeavor in good faith to uphold \ntheir obligations as set forth in the Decree and that, in the event of a dispute, \nPlaintiffs can quickly have recourse to the Court, which is particularly important \nin light of the urgency required to confront the pandemic. \n \n(Id. at PageID 3189-91.)  This relief addresses most, if not all, of Plaintiffs’ alleged deficiencies \nin their confinement in the Jail, given the pandemic, and the Court is not aware of any greater \nsuccesses in similar litigation. \nThe Court additionally finds that the Agreement was negotiated at arm’s length.  It was \nreached after adversarial negotiations that lasted approximately eight (8) months.  (Id. at PageID \n3187.)  It is the product of three mediation sessions with a third-party mediator.  (Id.)  In sum, \nthe Parties’ Agreement is the product of a procedurally fair process.  See Fitzgerald v. P.L. \nMktg., Inc., No. 217CV02251SHMCGC, 2020 WL 7764969, at *11 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 13, 2020) \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 7 of 10    PageID 3238\n(granting preliminary approval of class action settlement where adversarial negotiations lasted \nmore than a year and was the product of two mediation sessions with a third-party mediator). \n2.  Adequate Relief and Equitable Treatment \nUnder Rule 23(e)(2)(C), a court must consider whether “the relief provided for the class \nis adequate, taking into account: (i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the \neffectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, including the method of \nprocessing class-member claims; (iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, \nincluding timing of payment; and (iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule \n23(e)(3).”   \nHere, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented crisis in need of urgent \nresolution—specifically, Plaintiffs’ safety while in pre-trial detention.  The Settlement resolves \npressing concerns regarding the adequacy of safety measures at the Jail, and also provides \nmechanisms to inspect those measures on an ongoing basis and report any issues.  The \nSettlement avoids the costs of continued discovery, which would involve complex scientific \nquestions regarding the spread of COVID-19, not to mention the incalculable costs and risks to \nPlaintiffs of continuing litigation without provisional relief.   \nMoreover, Defendants’ agreement to pay Plaintiffs’ counsel for their costs incurred with \nthis case is reasonable and does not impact the Class’ relief, while each side has agreed to cover \nits own attorney fees, again without impact on the Class itself.  Lastly, the Settlement treats all \nrelevant Class members equally.  Thus, Rule 23(e) is satisfied. \nB.  Approval of Notice and Direction to Effectuate Notice as Modified \nRule 23(e) mandates that the court must “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class \nmembers who would be bound” by a proposed class settlement.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(B).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 8 of 10    PageID 3239\n“The notice should be ‘reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to apprise interested \nparties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’”  \nMeyers v. Dtna Trucks N. Am., LLC, No. 14-2361, 2014 WL 12531121, at *9 (W.D. Tenn. Oct. \n8, 2014) (quoting UAW v. General Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 629-30 (6th Cir. 2007)). \nHere, the Parties propose two forms of Notice, a simpler version (the “Plain Text \nNotice”) and a more complex version (the “Detailed Notice”), attached as Exhibits D and E to \nthe Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Approval.  The Plain Text Notice is written to be \nunderstood by individuals with a fifth grade or lower literacy level.  The Detailed Notice is more \ncomplex and is intended to be understood by individuals who read at a higher literacy level.   \nRegarding the posting and availability of the Plain Text Notice, the Parties describe the \nfollowing program:  \nThe Plain Text Notice will be posted in both English and Spanish to ensure the \nClass members can understand the contents.  The Plain Text Notice will be posted \nin each of the housing units of the Jail. \n \nNext to each posting, there will be a message indicating that the pod counselor \nhas copies of the Detailed Notice, the Consent Decree, and the Court Order \ndefining the Class and Subclass for detainees to review. Each pod counselor will \nretain copies of the English and Spanish versions of the Notices, the Consent \nDecree, and the Court Order defining the Class and Subclass. Each pod counselor \nwill maintain these copies and will provide detainees with access to review these \ncopies upon request. . . .  \n \nThe Notices explain in simple terms that Class and Subclass members can object \nto the terms of the Consent Decree by writing out their objections and mailing \nthem to the Court. The Notices also provide a toll-free phone number that Class \nand Subclass members can call from the Jail to discuss the Settlement with \nPlaintiffs’ counsel. \n \nIn the event the Court enters the Consent Decree, the Jail will modify these \nprocedures. The Jail will post a message in the communal areas that indicates the \nConsent Decree is available for review upon request from a pod counselor. The \nJail will maintain a copy of the Consent Decree with each pod counselor until the \nConsent Decree is no longer in place.  \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 9 of 10    PageID 3240\n(ECF No. 161 at PageID 3195-96.) \nThe Plain Text Notice, which will be posted in each housing unit in both English and \nSpanish, provides detailed information about the class definitions, what the Agreement says and \nrequires, how agreement was reached and likely next steps, and how to ask questions and/or \nobject.  The Parties have also agreed that the other pertinent documents, the Detailed Notice, the \nProposed Consent Decree, and the Court Order defining the Classes, will be available for \ndetainees to review.  The Court further DIRECTS that a copy of this Order be made available to \ndetainees.  In sum, the Notices adequately apprise Class members of the Settlement Agreement \nand afford them an opportunity to object.  Posting the Notices in each housing unit is an adequate \nmeans of providing notice. \nC.  Final Approval Hearing \nThe Court will hold the Final Approval Hearing on March 5, 2021, at 9:30 AM, via \nMicrosoft Teams (unless the Parties request an in-person hearing), to assist the Court in \ndetermining whether to grant Final Approval of the Settlement and consider any objections from \nthe Classes.  At the Hearing, the Court will discuss potential additional information on housing \nto be provided to the Independent Inspector, such as total capacity by pod, to allow proper \nevaluation of the population statistics, and any agreement between the Parties as to the breadth of \nfuture inspections, as well as any other issues raised regarding the Proposed Consent Decree. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Motion is GRANTED. The Court ORDERS that: \n1.  The Settlement is conditionally APPROVED as fair, reasonable, and adequate to the  \nClass members, subject to further consideration at the Final Approval Hearing. \n2.  The Parties are DIRECTED to provide notice of the proposed Settlement \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 162   Filed 01/28/21   Page 10 of 10    PageID 3241\nas provided in this Order and the Settlement Agreement. \n3.  Any person in the Class or Subclass may object to the Settlement.  Any such  \nobjections to the Settlement must be received by the Clerk of the Court by no later than \nMarch 2, 2021, at the address printed in the Notices.   \n4.  The Parties are DIRECTED to modify the Notices to reflect the appropriate dates  \nand times of the Final Approval Hearing and the deadline for objections. \n5.  The Parties are DIRECTED to make a copy of this Order available to detainees. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 28th day of January, 2021. \n  s/ Sheryl H. Lipman   \n  SHERYL H.

On June 10, 2020, the Court certified a \nClass and Subclass of medically vulnerable and disabled individuals detained pre-trial at the \nShelby County Jail who were at increased risk of serious injury or death from COVID-19.  (ECF \nNo. 38.)  On January 22, 2021, the Parties agreed to a Consent Decree that resolved the claims \nand moved for preliminary approval of a class action settlement.  (ECF No. 161.)  The Court \napproved the Consent Decree and granted preliminary approval of the settlement.  (ECF No. \n162.) \nParagraphs 28 and 29 of the Consent Decree set forth the procedures for how the Consent \nDecree may be terminated.  (ECF No. 161-2 at PageID 3210.)  In their Joint Motion, the Parties \nmove to replace Paragraphs 28 and 29 of the Consent Decree with the following language: \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 359     Filed 05/25/23     Page 2 of 2 \nPageID 7149\n28.  This Decree will terminate on October 1, 2023.  Upon termination of this \nDecree pursuant to this Paragraph, the parties shall inform the Court and the Court \nshall enter a final judgment of dismissal.  If any motion timely filed in good faith \nunder Section VIII of the Decree is pending and unresolved by the Court at the time \nof expiration, this Decree shall not expire until such time as the Court resolves the \nmotion.

(ECF No. 209.)  Both parties now seek \nattorneys’ fees for their respective efforts to either enforce the settlement or oppose its \nenforcement.  (ECF Nos. 371, 373.)  Because neither party is entitled to fees under the Decree’s \nnarrow fee provisions, both motions are DENIED. \nBACKGROUND \nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe history of this nearly five-year-old case has been well-documented in many of the \nCourt’s previous orders—only the relevant procedural history is provided here.  The parties \nresolved this case through a Consent Decree outlining the terms of their settlement.  (ECF No. \n161-2.)  After the Court approved the Decree in early 2021, the parties promptly began litigating\nabout how to interpret it and what exactly it required Defendants to do. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 2 of 23 \nPageID 7656\nOn May 19, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their first motion to enforce and modify the Decree.  \n(ECF No. 216-1.)  Two weeks later, Defendants moved to terminate it.  (ECF No. 218.)  The \nCourt first addressed the termination motion and, after two evidentiary hearings, denied it.  (ECF \nNo. 258.)  Defendants quickly appealed (ECF No. 259), and the Sixth Circuit later affirmed \n(ECF No. 337). \nIn the meantime, the Court bifurcated Plaintiffs’ motion and held the modification \nportion in abeyance until the Sixth Circuit addressed the termination question.  (ECF No. 276.)  \nThe Court set a status conference on November 23, 2021, to discuss outstanding compliance \nissues raised in Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce and new compliance issues raised in their motion to \nbifurcate.  (ECF No. 285.)  The Court directed the parties to confer and submit an agreed notice \nlisting all of their unresolved issues (id.), which they did on December 3, 2021 (ECF No. 291).  \nThe parties reconvened for another status conference on December 14, 2021, to discuss whether \na hearing would be necessary.  (ECF No. 294.) \nThe Court denied a portion of the enforcement motion on January 3, 2022 (ECF No. \n297), and the parties engaged in discovery on the remaining issues (ECF Nos. 299, 300, 309).  \nThey attended a third status conference on January 14, 2022, and the Court ordered them to meet \nand confer afterwards about their lingering disagreements.  (ECF No. 302.)  They each filed their \nown updated report on the remaining issues on February 4, 2022 (ECF Nos. 305, 306), and then \nthey filed an updated joint notice on February 25, 2022 (ECF No. 313). The Court decided the \nremainder of Plaintiffs’ enforcement motion without a hearing on March 30, 2022.  (ECF No. \n316.)  It denied all of Plaintiffs’ substantive requests to enforce but granted the motion in part to \nthe extent that Defendants had not produced enough evidence to demonstrate compliance with \nthe Inspector’s recommendations about vaccine education.  (Id. at PageID 5833.)  It therefore \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 23 \nPageID 7657\nordered Defendants to produce discovery about the Jail’s small group meetings and plans for its \npeer education program so that the Court could “evaluate Defendants’ compliance on these \nissues.”  (Id.)  The Court did not order Defendants to change any of their practices—it only \nordered limited document production.  (See ECF No. 316.)  Plaintiffs promptly asked the Court \nto revise its order (ECF No. 319), and it refused to do so on August 4, 2022 (ECF No. 328). \nAfter the Court denied most of Plaintiffs’ first enforcement motion, they filed another one \non March 24, 2023.  (ECF No. 345.)   The parties resolved this dispute on their own and later \nfiled a joint motion to modify the Decree to provide a termination date of October 1, 2023.  (ECF \nNo. 358 at PageID 7143.)  The Court granted the joint motion and denied the second \nenforcement motion as moot.  (ECF No. 359.)  On October 11, 2023, the parties filed a joint \nnotice stating that the Decree had terminated (ECF No. 366), and the Court entered a \nsupplemental judgment a week later (ECF No. 367).  It retained jurisdiction to resolve any \ndisputes about attorneys’ fees.  (Id. at PageID 7225.)  Those disputes are now pending before the \nCourt. \nII.  TERMS OF THE DECREE \nThe Decree provides the sole mechanism for receipt of attorneys’ fees.  (ECF No. 161-3 \nat ¶ 15 (stating that “no fees, attorney fees, or expenses shall be requested or awarded to either \nparty except as provided for in the Consent Decree” (emphasis added)).)  It also eliminates the \npossibility of obtaining fees for work done prior to the date the Decree was entered, specifically \nstating that each party must “bear its own costs, attorneys’ fees, and expenses incurred up to the \ndate of the entry of this Decree.”  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 30.)  It states that neither party “shall be \nconsidered to be the ‘prevailing’ or ‘successful’ party within the meaning of any statute or law as \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 23 \nPageID 7658\na result of this Decree.”  (Id.)  But the Decree does allow for the possibility of obtaining fees \nresulting from certain enforcement efforts. 1  (Id. at ¶ 23.) \nAccording to the provisions governing disagreements about enforcement, if the parties \ndisputed performance or interpretation of the Decree, the parties were to engage in an \nenumerated dispute resolution process.  (Id. at ¶ 22.)  This process required counsel to “notify \nopposing counsel in writing, describing the dispute and clearly identifying that they are invoking \nthe dispute resolution practice.”  (Id.)  The opposing party was required to respond within seven \ndays of receipt.  (Id.)  Within a week of sharing their respective positions, the Decree required \nthe parties to “meet and confer and attempt to resolve the issue” on their own.  (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs were only entitled to seek enforcement of the Decree if (1) the dispute still \nexisted after completing the resolution process and (2) Defendants failed “to comply” with the \nDecree’s terms, which included if Plaintiffs had a “good faith basis” to believe that Defendants \nhad not “engaged best efforts to adopt the recommendations of the Independent Inspector or the \nVentilation Expert.”  (Id. at ¶ 23.)  And Plaintiffs could only “seek an award of the reasonable \n \n1 Paragraph 23 states: \n \nSubsequent to the parties engaging in and completing the dispute resolution process \nas set forth in Paragraph 22, Plaintiffs may seek enforcement of this [D]ecree if \nDefendants fail to comply with any terms of this Decree, including if Plaintiffs have \na good faith basis to believe that Defendants have not engaged best efforts to adopt \nthe recommendations of the Independent Inspector or the Ventilation Expert (if \napplicable pursuant to Paragraph 13).  If Plaintiffs seek enforcement of this Decree \nand obtain relief from the Court as a result of seeking such enforcement, Plaintiffs \nmay seek an award of the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in seeking \nenforcement of this Decree.  Should Plaintiffs elect under such circumstances to \nseek enforcement of this Decree and the Court deny the relief sought on grounds \nthat Plaintiffs’ action is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, Defendants \nmay  seek  an  award  of  the  reasonable  attorneys’  fees  and  costs  incurred  in \nresponding to Plaintiffs’ attempt to seek such enforcement. \n \n(ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 23.) \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 23 \nPageID 7659\nattorneys’ fees and costs incurred in seeking enforcement” if they obtained “relief from the Court \nas a result of seeking such enforcement.”  (Id.)  But Plaintiffs’ decision to seek enforcement \nwould come at a cost.  If the Court denied relief because Plaintiffs’ enforcement efforts were \n“frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, Defendants may seek an award of the \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in responding to Plaintiffs’ attempt to seek such \nenforcement.”  (Id.)    \nBoth parties now invoke their respective fee provisions.  Plaintiffs seek $769,337.80 in \nfees for nearly all of their work performed from April 13, 2021 to March 30, 2022.  (ECF No. \n373-1 at PageID 7358, 7367.)  The tasks performed include preparing their enforcement motion; \nopposing Defendants’ termination motion; “communicating with the Independent Inspector, \nDefendants, and Class members to obtain real time information regarding conditions in the Jail”; \nand “undertaking substantial monitoring and interaction with Defendants in order to effectuate \nthe protections of the Decree.”  (Id. at PageID 7368.)  Defendants request $77,134.00 in fees for \nopposing Plaintiffs’ enforcement motion, the related discovery motions, and their motion for \nrevision, as well as for preparing and filing notices with the Court.  (ECF No. 371-1 at PageID \n7249–50.)  Both parties assert that their respective fees are reasonable and the opposing parties’ \nfees are not.  However, because neither party is entitled to fees in the first place, the Court does \nnot reach the question of reasonableness. \nAPPLICABLE LAW \n  A consent decree is a settlement agreement that is backed by “the power and prestige of \nthe court” and “subject to continued judicial policing.”  Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, \n920 (6th Cir. 1983) (citing Stotts v. Memphis Fire Dept., 679 F.2d 541, 556 (6th Cir. 1982)).  As \na result, it is both a contract and a judicial act.  Stotts, 679 F.2d at 556–57 (citing United States v. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 23 \nPageID 7660\nMotor Vehicles Mfg. Ass’n of U.S., Inc., 643 F.2d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1981)).  Because it is a \ncontract, it “should be strictly construed to preserve the bargained for position of the parties.”  \nWilliams, 720 F.2d at 920 (citing United States v. ITT Cont’l Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 238 \n(1975)).  A court “may not depart from its ‘four corners’ unless its language is ambiguous.”  \nStotts, 679 F.2d at 557 (citing ITT Cont’l, 420 U.S. at 236).   \nFew people “are in a better position to understand the meaning of a consent decree than \nthe district judge who oversaw and approved it.”  Busby v. Bonner, No. 21-5853, 2022 WL \n17661145, at *3 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2022).  The court must “ascertain the intent of the parties at \nthe time of the settlement,” id. (quoting Nat’l Ecological Found. v. Alexander, 496 F.3d 466, 478 \n(6th Cir. 2007)), applying the law of the state in which the parties entered the decree, id. (citing \nJohn B. v. Emkes, 710 F.3d 394, 407 (6th Cir. 2013)).  Here, that state is Tennessee. \nTennessee law requires that a contract be interpreted based on “the usual, natural, and \nordinary meaning” of its language.  Id. (quoting Roger Miller Music, Inc. v. Sony/ATV Publ’g, \nLLC, 477 F.3d 383, 392 (6th Cir. 2007)).  The court is not “a fallback mechanism for parties to \nuse to ‘make a new contract’ if their written contract purportedly fails to serve their ‘true’ \nintentions.”  Id. (quoting Individual Healthcare Specialists, Inc. v. BlueCross BlueShield of \nTenn., Inc., 556 S.W.3d 671, 694 (Tenn. 2019)).  A party who successfully enforces its contract \nrights can only recover attorneys’ fees if that party can demonstrate that the contract provides for \nattorneys’ fees.  Notredan, LLC v. Old Republic Exch. Facilitator Co., No. 11–2987–STA–tmp, \n2012 WL 3049941, at * (W.D. Tenn. July 25, 2012) (quoting Hosier v. Crye-Leike Com., Inc., \nNo. M2000–01182–COA–R3–CV, 2001 WL 799740, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 17, 2001)).  If a \nparty demonstrates the right to fees under a contractual provision, the court must award a \nreasonable fee.  Id. (citing Albright v. Mercer, 945 S.W.2d 749, 751 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996)).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 23 \nPageID 7661\nANALYSIS \nI.  PREVAILING PARTY \nPlaintiffs first argue that they are entitled to attorneys’ fees because they are “‘the \nprevailing party’ under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(d), 42 U.S.C. § 12205, and 29 \nU.S.C. § 794a(b).”2  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7365.)  Defendants assert that this request is \nboth outside of and in contravention of the Decree.  (ECF No. 377 at PageID 7595–96.)  The \nCourt agrees. \nThe parties entered this Decree “after careful negotiation,” and they produced an \nagreement with “precise terms.”  See Evoqua Water Techs., LLC v. M.W. Watermark, LLC, 940 \nF.3d 222, 229 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681 \n(1971)).  One precise settlement term to which Plaintiffs agreed was to not request attorneys’ \nfees “except as provided for in the Consent Decree.”  (ECF No. 161-3 at ¶ 15.)  And the Decree \nonly allows Plaintiffs to seek fees for specific enforcement actions if they “obtain relief from the \nCourt”—it does not allow them to seek “prevailing party” fees under any statute, including § \n1988(b), § 1997e(d), § 12205, or § 794a(b).  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 23.)  If the parties wished to \nprovide for broad prevailing party fees under those statutes, they could have done so, either by \nrecognizing Plaintiffs’ right to seek such relief or by specifically stating that Plaintiffs are to be \nconsidered as prevailing parties under the relevant statutes.  See Binta B. ex rel. S.A. v. Gordon, \n710 F.3d 608, 625 (6th Cir. 2013) (addressing a Decree in which the parties explicitly agreed that \n \n2 Plaintiffs spill a lot of ink discussing their success prior to entry of the Decree and the law \npermitting fee recovery for that work.  (See ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7358–59, 7361, 7365–66, \n7381.)  But the “focus” of their motion is their “entitlement” to fees for post-settlement \nenforcement work.  (Id.)  Indeed, Plaintiffs explicitly agreed not to seek fees for any work \nperformed prior to entry of the Decree.  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 30.)  Thus, no relief is appropriate \nfor Plaintiffs’ work and success pre-settlement.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 23 \nPageID 7662\n“Plaintiffs are prevailing parties for purposes of their entitlement to an award of attorneys’ fees \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1988 for legal services rendered by their counsel in connection with these \nproceedings”).  No such language was included in the Decree. \nThe parties knew how to provide for broad prevailing party fees, or even the right to \npursue them, if they so wished.3  Indeed, Section XII explicitly eliminates prevailing party fees \nunder any statute for work performed prior to the Decree’s formation.4  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 30.)  \nAnd when discussing Defendants’ ability to recover fees should Plaintiffs’ enforcement efforts \nbe denied, the parties explicitly memorialized the traditional prevailing party standard that \nprevents a defendant from recovering fees unless the plaintiffs’ action was “frivolous,” \n“unreasonable,” or “without foundation.”  (Id. at ¶ 23.)  See Christiansburg Garment Co. v. \nEEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421–22 (1978).  If the parties wanted Plaintiffs to be entitled to the entire \nrange of prevailing party fees available under any statute, they would have said so.  But they \nchose to limit the realm of fees recoverable by Plaintiffs to a specific type of prevailing party \nfee—the Decree states that Plaintiffs may only recover “fees and costs incurred in seeking \nenforcement” if they were able to “obtain relief from the Court as a result of seeking such \nenforcement.”  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 23 (emphasis added).)  While Defendants’ fee provision \n \n3 Plaintiffs’ attorneys “possess significant skills and experience in complex civil rights and class \naction litigation.”  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7382–83.)  Indeed, the “ACLU has litigated \ncomplex class actions on behalf of incarcerated people for over half a century.”  (Id. at PageID \n7383.)  There is no question that Plaintiffs’ attorneys knew how to explicitly provide for the right \nto seek prevailing party fees. \n4 Defendants argue that the language in Section XII also prohibits prevailing party fees for work \nperformed after entry of the Decree.  (ECF No. 377 at PageID 7595.)  But that provision merely \nprevents any party from being considered a prevailing party as a result of the Decree’s entry.  \n(See ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 30.)  Indeed, it explicitly states that no party “shall be considered to be \nthe ‘prevailing’ or ‘successful’ party within the meaning of any statute or law as a result of this \nDecree.”  (Id. (emphasis added).)  It goes on to clarify that, because no party can be considered \nthe prevailing party up to entry of the Decree, each party “shall bear its own costs, attorneys’ \nfees, and expenses incurred up to the date of the entry of this Decree.”  (Id. (emphasis added).)   \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 23 \nPageID 7663\nexplicitly tracks the prevailing party standard, Plaintiffs’ provision does not.  Thus, the parties \nsought to limit Plaintiffs’ fee recovery. \nThe Court will not rewrite the Decree—it must construe the Decree “as it is written” and \nnot as Plaintiffs would have written it had they established their claims in litigation.  See Armour \n& Co., 402 U.S. at 682.  Because Plaintiffs agreed that the Decree provides the sole mechanism \nfor obtaining fees, and it does not provide for broad prevailing party fees under any statute, \nPlaintiffs’ first request is DENIED. \nII.  FEES EXPRESSLY LIMITED \nAt the same time that Plaintiffs argue that the Decree’s fee provision contains “very \nnarrow, negotiated language” (ECF No. 378 at PageID 7631), they also broadly seek fees for \neverything that happened after entry of the Decree up to entry of the second order on their \nmotion to enforce (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7367).  This fee request includes miscellaneous \nadministrative tasks, actions to oppose Defendants’ termination motion, efforts to monitor \nDefendants’ compliance, and attempts to modify the Decree.5  (ECF No. 373-4 at PageID 7416–\n7429; ECF No. 373-9 at PageID 7475–7503.)  Defendants argue that the Decree does not permit \nrecovery for any of this work.  While these fees may generally be recoverable for prevailing \nparties under the relevant statutes, Plaintiffs here bargained away their ability to recover them \nwhen they limited their fee recovery to successful enforcement actions. \n \n5 Plaintiffs’ attempts to modify the Decree fall outside the fee provision’s scope—attempting to \nmodify the Decree is different from attempting to enforce it as written.  The Decree also treats \nmodification and enforcement as separate and distinct activities.  (See ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 21 \n(“The Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of modifying or enforcing this \nDecree.” (emphasis added)); id. at ¶ 22, 24, 25 (discussing the terms governing enforcement \nseparately from the terms governing modification).)  Thus, Plaintiffs’ request to recover fees for \npreparing and filing their motion to enforce and modify the Decree is DENIED as to the \nmodification portion. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 23 \nPageID 7664\nA.  Administrative Tasks \nPlaintiffs state that their counsel deleted billing entries that were “unreasonable” to bill to \nDefendants “in the exercise of good billing judgment.”  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7369.)  But \nthat is not the case here.  Many of their entries represent the kinds of requests that “exemplify the \novercompensation some attorneys are apt to seek in litigation of this type.”6  See Binta B., 710 \nF.3d at 608. \nPaul, Weiss seeks fees for unrecoverable tasks like reviewing the press related to the \nsettlement (ECF No. 373-9 at PageID 7475), circulating calendar invites (id. at PageID 7488), \ncalendaring “deadlines and upcoming court ordered dates” (id. at PageID 7500), conversations \nwith local counsel “to ascertain reason for receiving tax form from incarcerated individual at \njail” (id. at PageID 7489), preparing pro hac vice motions (id. at PageID 7476, 7486, 7488, \n7502), conversations with the ACLU about “settlement payment status” (id. at PageID 7479), \nreviewing and creating updates about “costs” (id. at PageID 7481), researching and writing a \nbrief for a “sanctions motion” that the Court denied (id. at PageID 7482, 7483, 7484, 7485, 7486, \n7487, 7495, 7496, 7497, 7499, 7501, 7502), updating the “signature pages” on the same \nsanctions motion (id. at PageID 7495), attending to “payment for ventilation expert” (id. at \nPageID 7484), attending to “payment of vendor invoice” (id. at PageID 7485), onboarding new \n \n6 Plaintiffs’ billing records leave much to be desired.  Some of their entries are cut off such that \nthey are unreadable (ECF No. 373-9 at PageID 7476, 7489), and some are redacted (id. at \nPageID 7478, 7481, 7483).  There are also at least twenty-four instances of the same attorney \ndouble and triple billing for the same task.  (ECF No. 373-4 at PageID 7416, 7417, 7418, 7419, \n7420, 7421, 7423, 7425, 7426, 7427, 7428.)  One task is not described at all.  (Id. at PageID \n7427.)  The Paul, Weiss attorneys sometimes billed more than the ACLU attorneys for attending \nthe same meeting or participating in the same phone call, and vice versa.  (Compare ECF No. \n373-9 at PageID 7495 (showing that Rockoff-Kirk billed 0.60 for a call about the sanctions \nmotion), with ECF No. 373-4 at PageID 7427 (showing that Rosenbloom either double-billed \n0.40 or billed 0.80 for the same call with Rockoff-Kirk about the sanctions motion).) \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 23 \nPageID 7665\njunior associates (id. at PageID 7486, 7488), coordinating with paralegals for purposes of \nonboarding new team members (id. at PageID 7487), reviewing the entire case during the \nonboarding process (id. at PageID 7488), compiling hours worked by attorneys “for purposes of \noffer as to attorney’s fees” (id. at PageID 7487), calls with other attorneys about “distribution of \nprojects” (id. at PageID 7493), creating a “binder” (id. at PageID 7499), summarizing filings to \ncirculate to team members (id. at PageID 7500), client meetings (id. at PageID 7502), conducting \nand summarizing research on local hospitals (id. at PageID 7503), and a call to “discuss possible \nhabeas idea” (id.). \n  The ACLU seeks fees for similarly unrecoverable tasks like saving pleadings to the case \nfile (ECF No. 373-4 at PageID 7416, 7417, 7418, 7419, 7420, 7421, 7422, 7424, 7427, 7428), \ndrafting a pro hac vice motion (id. at PageID 7416), confirming an attorney’s dates of admission \nto different bars for a pro hac vice motion (id. at PageID 7417), filing a pro hac vice motion (id.), \ncompiling attorney fee records (id. at PageID 7422), editing a press release (id.), processing \ninvoices for payment (id.; id. at PageID 7423), following up on an invoice (id. at PageID 7422), \nonboarding two new team members (id. at PageID 7424), reviewing the complaint and the entire \ndocket for purposes of onboarding (id.), drafting, editing, and formatting a motion for sanctions \nthat the Court denied (id. at PageID 7423, 7424, 7426, 7427, 7428), and discussing a document \nreview project with an intern (id.).  \n  These fees are not appropriate for recovery under the Decree’s fee provision.  Most of \nthem do not directly relate to Plaintiffs’ enforcement efforts at all and, to the extent some of them \ndo, they are non-legal, administrative actions.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ request for these fees is \nDENIED.  Plaintiffs’ other requests for more substantive fees similarly fall outside of the \nDecree’s scope. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 23 \nPageID 7666\nB.  Opposing Termination \nPrevailing plaintiffs in similar actions are generally allowed to recover fees for opposing \ntermination of a consent decree.  See Binta B., 710 F.3d at 625 (stating that statutory prevailing \nplaintiffs are sometimes entitled to compensation for post-judgment work like defending a \nconsent decree).  Plaintiffs rely on the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Binta B. to argue they are \nentitled to fees for opposing Defendants’ termination efforts here.  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID \n7367.)  But the consent decree at issue in Binta B. specifically stated that the plaintiffs were \n“prevailing parties for purposes of their entitlement to an award of attorneys’ fees under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 for legal services rendered by their counsel in connection with these proceedings.”  \nBinta B., 710 F.3d at 620.  As a result, those plaintiffs received the benefit of prevailing party \nstatus under § 1988.  That is not the case here. \nPlaintiffs in this case explicitly bargained away their ability to become a statutory \nprevailing party when they agreed to only seek fees as provided for in the Decree.  And, as \ndiscussed, the Decree only allows recovery for “fees and costs incurred in seeking enforcement \nof this Decree.”  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 23 (emphasis added).)  Indeed, it clarifies that an \n“enforcement” action within the meaning of the fee provision is limited to an action taken by \nPlaintiffs when “Defendants fail to comply with any terms of this Decree.”  (Id.)  The \ntermination motion was not an action taken by Plaintiffs, and the Court never held that \nDefendants violated a term of the Decree by moving to terminate it—rather, the termination \nissue was “a narrow question of contract interpretation” to decide “whether Defendants have met \nthe requirements of the termination provision” in the Decree.  (ECF No. 258 at PageID 5064.)  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 13 of 23 \nPageID 7667\nThe Court held that Defendants had not met their burden to show termination as defined by the \nDecree, not that they had failed to comply with it.7  (Id. at PageID 5083.) \nThe Decree also explicitly differentiates between termination and enforcement—the \nsection discussing termination is separate from the section about enforcement.  (See ECF No. \n161-2 at § VIII & XI.)  And the fee recovery provision only appears in the section about \nenforcement, not termination.  (See id.)  Even the case cited by Plaintiffs in support of their fee \nrequest differentiates between defending a consent decree and enforcing it.  See Binta B., 710 \nF.3d at 625 (stating that prevailing party fees are appropriate when a plaintiff takes certain \nactions to “defend or enforce a prior consent decree” (emphasis added)); see also Waste Mgmt. \nof Ohio, Inc. v. City of Dayton, 132 F.3d 1142, 1145 (6th Cir. 1997) (listing separately the \nCourt’s “duty to enforce, interpret, modify, and terminate their consent decrees”). \n  The Decree does not permit Plaintiffs to recover fees for defending it against a \ntermination motion.  While plaintiffs in similar cases are permitted to recover their fees for these \nefforts, Plaintiffs here bargained away that right when they negotiated for a settlement on the \nmerits of their claims.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ request to recover fees for opposing Defendants’ \ntermination motion is DENIED. \nC.  Monitoring Compliance \nIn addition to other fee recovery, statutory prevailing plaintiffs in similar cases are also \nable to recover their fees for certain actions taken to monitor a defendant’s compliance with a \ndecree.  See Gonzalez v. Felker, 964 F. Supp. 251, 254 (N.D. Ohio 1997) (“A reasonable \nattorneys’ fee may include post-judgment monitoring of a consent decree.”) (citing Joseph A. v. \n \n7 Defendants continued to comply with the Decree pending the outcome of their termination \nmotion. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 23 \nPageID 7668\nN.M. Dept. of Hum. Servs., 28 F.3d 1056, 1059 (10th Cir. 1994)).  Plaintiffs seek fees for their \nefforts to monitor for compliance here.  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7362–63.)  But, again, \nPlaintiffs bargained away their ability to recover these fees except when they are connected to \nsuccessful “enforcement” actions.  (See ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 23.)  Thus, it stands to reason that \nthe Decree itself also prevents fees for compliance monitoring when those efforts are not \nconnected to an enforcement action that obtains relief from the Court.   \nBecause the Decree only permits fee recovery when connected to a successful \nenforcement action, fees for compliance monitoring must also be connected to a successful \nenforcement action.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ request for those fees depends on whether they can \nshow they successfully pursued enforcement and obtained relief from the Court.  For the reasons \nstated below, they have not done so.  Thus, their request for fees for compliance monitoring is \nDENIED. \nIII.  ENFORCEMENT AND OPPOSITION \nBoth parties’ respective abilities to recover fees for seeking and opposing enforcement \nare narrow and limited.  Although it appears to the Court that Plaintiffs’ enforcement efforts \nhelped to ensure Defendants’ continued compliance with the Decree, they have not shown that \nthey obtained “relief” from the Court in the form of ordered enforcement.  And Defendants \ncannot establish that any of the important work that Plaintiffs did to enforce the Decree was \nunreasonable, frivolous, or without foundation. \nA.  Enforcement \nAs discussed, Plaintiffs may only recover fees for enforcement work when they “obtain \nrelief from the Court as a result of seeking such enforcement.”  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 23.)  Thus, \nthe Court first must determine the results of Plaintiffs’ enforcement motion.  Then it must \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 23 \nPageID 7669\ndecide whether any of those results constitutes “relief from the Court” for purposes of the \nattorneys’ fees provision.  The Court concludes that none of them do. \n1.  Results \nPlaintiffs argue that they “uncovered substantial violations of the Consent Decree and, \nwithout the cooperation of Defendants on many of them, were required to pursue enforcement \naction to bring Defendants in compliance.”  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7363.)  They state that \ntheir enforcement efforts resulted in improved access to COVID-19 testing, vaccines, education, \nand protective gear; provided incentives for detained people to take vaccines; improved \nisolation practices; and improved evaluation and documentation by the Court Expeditor office \nin its efforts to assess release of detainees.  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7381–82.)  While all of \nthese efforts were important, none of these achievements were the fruits of any order by the \nCourt.8  A review of the docket does not reveal any Court-ordered relief correcting “substantial \nviolations” of the Decree. \nThe Court only entered two orders related to Plaintiffs’ enforcement motion during the \nrelevant period.  The first denied any relief at all.  (ECF No. 297.)  The second denied most of \nPlaintiffs’ requests.  (ECF No. 316.)  However, the second order did instruct Defendants to \nproduce documents about small group meetings and their peer education program to fully assess \nwhether they were in compliance because they had not provided enough information.9  Id.  \n \n8 Plaintiffs also attribute these achievements to their success in opposing termination of the \nDecree.  But, as discussed above, the Decree does not permit recovery for efforts taken to oppose \ntermination—it treats termination separately. \n9 To the extent that the Court found Defendants had not complied with the Decree, it was only \nbecause they had not provided enough information to demonstrate compliance.  (ECF No. 316 at \nPageID 5832–33.)  The Court specifically stated that it will have enough information to truly \n“evaluate Defendants’ compliance” after production of the ordered discovery.  (Id. at PageID \n5833.) \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 23 \nPageID 7670\nThus, Plaintiffs are only eligible to receive fees for the portion of their enforcement motion \nabout small group meetings and the peer education program if Court-ordered discovery qualifies \nas “relief” under the Decree.  To the extent Plaintiffs request fees for any other portion of their \nenforcement action, that request is DENIED. \n2.  Relief \nPlaintiffs do not describe how Court-ordered discovery entitles them to compensation for \ntheir enforcement efforts.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ recitation of the relevant procedural history does \nnot even discuss the order granting in part their motion.  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7363.)  It is \ntrue that their diligent efforts to vindicate the rights they secured in the Decree were vital to \nensuring Defendants’ continued compliance with the Decree.  But Plaintiffs never describe how \ntheir efforts resulted in “relief” from the Court, much less how that relief is compensable under \nthe Decree, even though that is the standard they are required to address to prove they are \nentitled to fees.  Plaintiffs merely assume that they are entitled to fees because the Court granted \ntheir motion in part.10  Meanwhile, Defendants argue that the Court “only ordered limited \ndiscovery,” which would not qualify as relief under the Decree because Plaintiffs requested \nenforcement, not discovery.  (ECF No. 377 at PageID 7598.)  Defendants assert that “relief” has \na narrow definition—it is the “redress or benefit” that “a party asks of a court.”  (Id.)  Both \nparties miss the mark. \n \n10 Plaintiffs only dedicate three paragraphs of their thirty-one-page brief to arguing that they are \nentitled to fees under the terms of the Decree.  (ECF No. 373-1 at PageID 7365–67.)  One of \nthose paragraphs solely discusses their entitlement to fees for work performed prior to the \nDecree’s entry, which they do not request and are not allowed to pursue.  (Id. at PageID 7366.)  \nThe remainder of their brief is wholly dedicated to why their request for $769,337.80 is \nreasonable.  (Id. at PageID 7368–87.)  Plaintiffs never attempt to define “relief,” and they do not \nassert how discovery qualifies as relief. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 17 of 23 \nPageID 7671\nThe type of “relief” required to warrant prevailing party fees is instructive here.11  A \nprevailing party can only recover fees when they have “prevailed on the merits of at least some” \nof their claims.  Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W.V. Dept. of Health & Hum. Res., 532 \nU.S. 598, 604 (2001) (quoting Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758 (1980) (per curiam)).  \nPrevailing on any minor issue is not sufficient to warrant fees—the plaintiffs must specifically \nprevail on the merits.  Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 572 (1992) (“[L]iability on the merits and \nresponsibility for fees go hand in hand; where a defendant has not been prevailed against . . . on \nthe merits, [plaintiffs cannot obtain a prevailing party] fee award against that defendant.” \n(quoting Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985))).   \nTo prevail on the merits, plaintiffs must “succeed on any significant issue in litigation \nwhich achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”  Id. at 572 (quoting \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)).  At the very least, the plaintiffs must obtain a \ncourt-ordered “material alteration” in “the legal relationship” between the parties.  Buckhannon, \n532 U.S. at 604 (quoting Tx. State Tchrs. Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, \n792–93 (1989)).  The court materially alters the legal relationship between the parties when it \ndecides “some dispute which affects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff.”  \nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 110 (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761 (1987)).  The defendant’s \n \n11 Even though the parties eliminated the broad range of fees available to a plaintiff under a \nstatutory prevailing party theory, they relied on prevailing party principles when drafting the \nlanguage of the fee provisions at issue here.  Indeed, Defendants’ fee provision verbatim tracks \nthe prevailing party standard as applied to other defendants, Plaintiffs heavily rely on prevailing \nparty law in their own brief, Plaintiffs state that they only seek fees for enforcement actions on \nwhich they “prevailed” (ECF No. 380 at PageID 7650), and the parties preserved Plaintiffs’ \nability to collect a limited type of prevailing party fee.  Thus, those principles are helpful to \ndetermine the meaning of “relief” as contemplated by the parties. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 23 \nPageID 7672\nchange in behavior must “directly benefit” the plaintiffs, not other individuals or even plaintiffs’ \ncounsel.  Id. at 111 (citing Hewitt, 482 U.S. at 760). \nPlaintiffs assert that the Court’s order changed the legal relationship between the parties \n(ECF No. 378 at PageID 7635), but they do not explain how it did so.  The order was effectively \na pronouncement that Defendants failed to provide proof of compliance with the Decree, but it \nwas not an order on the merits of Plaintiffs’ claim of non-compliance.  See Farrar, 506 U.S. at \n112 (stating that a “judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution, \nunaccompanied by an enforceable judgment on the merits, does not” qualify as relief on the \nmerits).  That is not sufficient to qualify as compensable relief. \nWhile the order required Defendants to act, they were not required to act in a way that \n“materially” changed their relationship with Plaintiffs.  The Court only granted the motion to \nthe extent that Defendants had not produced sufficient information to demonstrate compliance.  \nBecause Defendants had not sufficiently demonstrated compliance, the Court ordered \nDefendants to produce information that would allow it to “evaluate Defendants’ compliance on \nthese issues.”  (ECF No. 316 at PageID 5833.)  The Court did not order Defendants to change \nany of their policies or practices.12  Thus, it did not change the legal relationship between the \nparties because it did not force Defendants to act in a way that directly benefited Plaintiffs \n \n12 It is true that the Court opined that it was “not enough for Defendants to show that the Jail has \nscheduled various Covid-19 events” and that “they must also show that these events are widely \nadvertised, occur on a consistent basis and are made accessible to all detainees” to “demonstrate \nmeaningful compliance with the Inspector’s recommendation.”  (ECF No. 316 at PageID 5832.)  \nHowever, the Court never ordered Defendants to host meetings more frequently and invite more \ndetainees.  Neither the Court nor the Inspector could truly assess whether the meetings were too \ninfrequent to meaningfully comply with the Inspector’s recommendation because Defendants \nhad not produced schedules of the meetings or proof of advanced notice to detainees.  (Id. at \nPageID 5832.)  At the most, the order offered Defendants guidance about what was required, but \nit cannot be construed as an order directing them to act in any particular way—had Defendants \nrefused to comply with that guidance, they could not have been found to be in contempt. \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 23 \nPageID 7673\nthemselves.  And it did not secure Plaintiffs’ initial success in obtaining the Decree because it \ndid not force Defendants to comply with it.  See Binta B., 710 F.3d at 626 (stating that \nprevailing plaintiffs seeking to recover fees for post-judgment work must show that their \nenforcement efforts “at the very least ‘secure[d] [plaintiffs’] initial success in obtaining the \nconsent decree’”13 by forcing defendants to continue complying with its terms (quoting \nDelaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 558–59)).  \nWhile the document production ordered was critical here to assess compliance, by itself, \nit does not materially change the legal relationship between the parties, and it cannot be said to \ndirectly benefit Plaintiffs.  See Rhodes, 488 U.S. at 203 (holding that a declaratory judgment in \nplaintiffs’ favor could not qualify as compensable relief because it did not directly benefit the \nplaintiffs—one plaintiff had been released from custody prior to the order’s entry, and the other \n \n13 Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to fees under the standard articulated in Binta B., but it is \nnot clear if that standard should apply here.  As discussed earlier, the consent decree in that case \nexplicitly enshrined plaintiffs’ status as prevailing parties.  Binta B., 710 F.3d at 620.  The court \nheld that, after the “initial determination” of prevailing party status had been established because \nplaintiffs had received relief on the merits of their claims, the plaintiffs were “not again required \nto establish prevailing party status in the conventional sense” to recover fees for post-judgment \nwork.  Id. at 625 (citing Tx. State Tchrs. Ass’n, 489 U.S. at 792).  Instead, the plaintiffs could \nreceive fees for any enforcement action that (1) was “necessary” to enforce the consent decree \nand (2) resulted in “a subsequent court order or agency determination that at the very least \n‘secure[s] [plaintiffs’] initial success in obtaining the consent decree.’”  Id. (quoting Delaware \nValley, 478 U.S. at 558–59).  Here, however, Plaintiffs do not already have the benefit of \nprevailing party status, and the Decree itself articulates that the specific standard at issue is \n“relief,” which is the same standard required to achieve prevailing party status.  Regardless, \nPlaintiffs have not shown that they should receive fees even if the more lenient Binta B. standard \napplies.  The Binta B. plaintiffs secured their initial success in obtaining the consent decree by \nsuccessfully opposing the modification of its terms.  Id. at 626–27 (“[D]efendants wanted to \ndiscontinue paying for medical services or prescriptions pending an enrollee's appeal for denial \nof prior authorization or coverage (something that the 2003 Consent Decree specifically \nrequired). The court denied this modification as to certain ongoing or unlimited prescriptions, \nstating ‘the State or its contractor must comply with Paragraph C(8) of the 2003 Consent Decree, \nrequiring continuation or reinstatement of benefits pending an appeal.’”).  Court-ordered \ndiscovery is not the same as an order requiring a defendant to continue complying with the \nspecific terms of a consent decree. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 20 of 23 \nPageID 7674\nhad passed away).  It is hard to imagine that any of the incarcerated people at the jail even saw \nthe documents that Defendants produced to the Inspector, and the documents themselves did not \nchange the way Defendants interacted with them.  Court-ordered document production is \nneither success on a “significant issue” nor does it achieve the “benefit” Plaintiffs sought in \nfiling their enforcement motion, even if it is a necessary step to achieving that success and \nsecuring the benefit sought.  See Farrar, 506 U.S. at 572.  The Court’s order is analogous to an \ninterlocutory ruling denying a motion to dismiss or granting a preliminary injunction, neither of \nwhich is sufficient to constitute relief on the merits because they do not conclusively resolve the \nrights of the parties on the merits.  See Lackie v. Stinnie, 145 S.Ct. 659, 667 (2025) (holding \nthat a party who prevails on a motion for a preliminary injunction does not qualify as a \nprevailing party because preliminary injunctions “do not conclusively resolve the rights of the \nparties on the merits”); Hewitt, 482 U.S. at 760 (holding that an order denying a 12(b)(6) \nmotion is “not the stuff of which legal victories are made” because it is not relief on the merits). \nIt is true that the magnitude of relief obtained does not affect eligibility for a fee award.  \nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 413–14 (holding that a nominal damages award qualifies as compensable \nrelief).  And Plaintiffs do not have to show that they obtained the “primary relief” they sought.  \nSee Binta B., 710 F.3d at 620 (quoting McQueary v. Conway, 614 F.3d 591, 603 (6th Cir. \n2010)).  But they must show that they obtained the type of relief contemplated by the Decree.  \nCourt-ordered discovery is not the kind of relief that materially affects the legal relationship \nbetween the parties.   \nThus, Plaintiffs’ request for fees for that portion of their enforcement motion is \nDENIED.  As a result, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any fees under the Decree for their \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 21 of 23 \nPageID 7675\nenforcement efforts.  But because none of Plaintiffs’ enforcement efforts were frivolous, \nunreasonable, or without foundation, Defendants are not entitled to any fees either. \nB.  Opposition to Enforcement \nTo obtain fees for their opposition to Plaintiffs’ enforcement efforts, Defendants must \nshow that Plaintiffs’ actions were “frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.”  (ECF No. \n161-2 at ¶ 23.)  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ enforcement motion was without foundation \nbecause they mostly failed to comply with the dispute resolution process and the Court \nultimately denied all of Plaintiffs’ substantive requests for enforcement as outside the scope of \nthe Decree.  (ECF No. 371-1 at PageID 7252–55.)  Plaintiffs assert that Defendants are not \nentitled to fees because the Court never specifically found that Plaintiffs acted frivolously, \nunreasonably, or without foundation in the Decree.  The Court agrees. \nDefendants are not entitled to fees just because Plaintiffs did not succeed on their motion.  \nSee Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 421.  A court cannot succumb to the “understandable temptation \nto engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not prevail, his action \nmust have been unreasonable or without foundation.”  Id. at 421–22.  “Even when the law or the \nfacts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset, a party may have an entirely reasonable \nground for bringing suit.”  Id. at 422.  Thus, the court must look “into the plaintiffs’ basis for \nbringing suit.”  Smith v. Smythe-Cramer Co., 754 F.2d 180, 183 (6th Cir. 1985).  It should only \naward fees where the plaintiff acted in bad faith, proceeded without any evidence to support their \nposition, or continued to proceed even after it became obvious that they had no basis to proceed.  \nId.  None of these situations exist here. \nDefendants assert that Plaintiffs’ failure to follow the formal dispute resolution process \nrenders their enforcement action unreasonable or without foundation (ECF No. 371-1 at PageID \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 22 of 23 \nPageID 7676\n7253), but this argument is misplaced.  The Court only looks to Plaintiffs’ basis for filing their \nmotion, not whether their dispute was ripe for review.  Even if an issue may not have been \nproperly before the Court because it was unclear whether the parties completed the resolution \nprocess, that does not mean it was unreasonable or frivolous to bring it to the Court.  Moreover, \nDefendants were not prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ alleged failure to follow the dispute resolution \nprocess because the Court ordered the parties to engage in several rounds of meet-and-confers \nwhile the motion was pending.  Both parties attended at least three status conferences in which \nthey discussed the enforcement motion before the Court (ECF Nos. 285, 294, 302), and, after \nconferring amongst themselves, they filed at least four notices that detailed their outstanding \ndisputes (ECF Nos. 277, 291, 305, 306, 313).  Defendants had adequate notice of the issues, and \nthey had plenty of time to address them outside of Court, as contemplated by the dispute \nresolution process. \nDefendants also argue that they are entitled to fees because the Court held that Plaintiffs’ \nenforcement requests were largely not contemplated by the Decree.  (ECF No. 371-1 at PageID \n7254–55.)  But the Court’s ultimate decision that the Decree did not require enforcement on \ncertain issues does not necessarily mean that Plaintiffs had no basis to pursue enforcement in the \nfirst place.  Plaintiffs grounded all of their requests in the Decree’s “provisions to enhance the \nsafety for the medically vulnerable Jail population.”  (ECF No. 378 at PageID 7639.)  Plaintiffs’ \nrequests either closely related to the purpose of the Decree or were directly recommended by the \nInspector.  (ECF No. 378 at PageID 7639–40.)  There is nothing in the record to demonstrate that \nPlaintiffs’ actions were frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.  Thus, Defendants have \nnot shown that they are entitled to fees under the Decree, and their motion is DENIED.  \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc     Document 383     Filed 03/27/25     Page 23 of 23 \nPageID 7677\nCONCLUSION \nThe fee provisions at issue here are narrow.  They permit limited fee recovery for specific \ntypes of work that resulted in specific types of Court orders.  Plaintiffs’ work after entry of the \nDecree was important—it allowed them to closely assess Defendants’ commitment to the \npromises they made.  But the fee provision they bargained for is too limited to authorize \nrecovery for work that did not result in an order on the merits of their enforcement motion.  And \nDefendants cannot recover fees because the Court never denied any of Plaintiffs’ requests as \nfrivolous, without foundation, or unreasonable.  Because neither party has shown that they are \nentitled to attorneys’ fees under the Decree’s narrow fee provisions, both motions are DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 27th day of March, 2025. \ns/ Sheryl H.

Plaintiffs  brought  claims  for \ndeclarative and injunctive relief and/or a writ of habeas corpus under 48 U.S.C. § 2241 as \nwell as discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Rehab Act”). \nPlaintiffs sought, among other things, release from the Jail via a temporary restraining order \nand/or preliminary injunction.  In response, Defendants denied they violated Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional or statutory rights.  Defendants disputed Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning \nPlaintiffs’ safety in the Shelby County Jail (the “Jail”) and asserted that they implemented \nnumerous practices and procedures that appropriately combated and prevented the spread \nof COVID-19 in the Jail. \nBy Order dated June 10, 2020, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss and \ncertified a Class and Subclass of medically vulnerable and disabled individuals detained \npretrial at the Jail who are at high risk of serious injury or death from COVID-19.  See ECF \nNo. 38.  Subsequently, the Court heard proof from the parties as well as an Independent \nInspector concerning the Jail’s response to COVID-19.  After hearing proof, the Court, in \nits August 7, 2020 Order, denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  See \nECF No. 124.  While the Court found that the proof showed “failures with how the Jail \ndetains medically vulnerable detainees amid this pandemic,” the Court concluded that \n“these failures can likely be remedied quickly.”  ECF No. 124, Pg.ID 2814–16.  As a result, \non September 15, 2020, Plaintiffs sought leave to file an amended complaint seeking relief \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 9 of 23    PageID 3186\n \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in addition to habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  See ECF No. \n137.  That motion is sub judice. \nAt different times during these proceedings the parties have endeavored to settle \ntheir dispute.  The Court’s August 7 Order added additional impetus to these efforts.  On \nDecember 16, 18, and 22, 2020, the parties engaged in mediation, which proved successful.  \nThe parties now bring this motion seeking preliminary approval of their class action \nsettlement, which if approved would result in the entry of a Consent Decree, in the form \nattached  hereto  as  Exhibit  B  (the  “Decree”),  as  well  as  a  Release  and  Settlement \nAgreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the “Agreement” and together with \nthe Decree, the “Settlement”). \nThe Decree and Agreement meet the requirements the Court must evaluate in \nconsidering whether to grant the motion seeking preliminary approval because there is no \nrisk of fraud or collusion; the complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation \nfavor settlement; the parties have engaged in sufficient discovery for Plaintiffs to gauge the \nadequacy of settlement; the parties are using settlement to resolve a legitimate legal and \nfactual disagreement; the Class counsel and Class representatives agree that the settlement \nis favorable; Plaintiffs’ counsel is not aware of any objections from absent Class and \nSubclass members; and the settlement serves the public interest. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Preliminary Approval of the Parties’ Settlement \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) requires the “court’s approval” for any settlement of claims \nof a certified class.  The Court may only approve a class settlement after holding a hearing \nto determine whether the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  Does 1-2 v. Déjà \nVu Services, Inc., 925 F.3d 886, 894 (6th Cir. 2019).  The Court makes this determination \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 10 of 23    PageID 3187\n \nafter considering whether: (A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately \nrepresented the class; (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length; (C) the relief \nprovided for the class is adequate; and (D) the proposal treats class members equitably \nrelative to each other.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  The key factors for the Court to \nconsider when undertaking this inquiry include: (1) the risk of fraud or collusion; (2) the \ncomplexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the amount of discovery \nengaged in by the parties; (4) the likelihood of success on the merits; (5) the opinions of \nclass counsel and class representatives; (6) the reaction of absent class members; and (7) \nthe public interest.  See Does 1-2, 925 F.3d 886 at 894–95 (citing Int’l Union, UAW, et al. \nv. General Motors Corp., 497 F.3d 615, 631 (6th Cir. 2007) (hereinafter “UAW”)).  The \nsettlement proposed by the parties satisfies these criteria. \nA.  There is No Risk of Fraud or Collusion \nThere has been no suggestion of any conflicts of interest with respect to the \nnegotiation  of  the  Settlement,  and  there  were  none.    The  proposed  Decree  and  the \nAgreement before this Court were negotiated at arms-length by attorneys with no conflicts \nof interest who vigorously advocated for their respective clients.  At different times in these \nproceedings,  the  parties  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  settle  their  dispute.    Those \nnegotiations  gained  added  impetus  following  the  Court’s  August  7  Order  and  were \nfacilitated by mediation held between the parties on December 16, 18, and 22, 2020.  \nCounsel for the parties also continued to meet and confer while mediation was ongoing.  \nThe parties exchanged multiple drafts of the proposed Decree and the Agreement and both \nsides made compromises to reach consensus.  The arms-length negotiation was ultimately \nsuccessful because the parties were able to arrive at a resolution that promotes safety in the \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 11 of 23    PageID 3188\n \nJail and protects Class and Subclass members from COVID-19, while also allowing \nDefendants flexibility to operate the Jail as required by law.   \nB.  The Complexity, Expense, and Likely Duration of the Litigation Favor \nSettlement \nCombating the novel coronavirus and the worst pandemic in over a century in a \ncongregate setting, such as the Jail, has raised complex factual and legal issues that require \nan urgent resolution that favors settlement.  The Settlement resolves these pressing issues \nquickly and avoids extensive additional discovery which is already underway.  \nThe Settlement resolves concerns regarding the safety of the Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the Class and Subclass and ensures that they will continue to be safe for the \nduration of the pandemic by providing mechanisms for continued reporting and inspections \nby the Court-appointed Independent Inspector.  Absent a determination by the Court, the \nDecree will remain in place for the duration of the pandemic and does not terminate until \nthe pandemic is declared over or a vaccine is offered to all detainees housed at the Jail.  See \nEx. B at ¶¶ 28–29. \nThe  Settlement  also  avoids  extensive  discovery,  including  a  forthcoming \nproduction from Defendants of electronically stored information (ESI) that will include a \nlarge quantity of emails and related documents, and eight depositions, which Plaintiffs have \nalready noticed.  In addition, absent approval of the Settlement, the parties will need to \ncontinue to conduct ongoing expert discovery regarding scientific questions related to the \nspread of COVID-19, including via airborne particles through the ventilation and air \nfiltration systems in the Jail. \nIn addition, the Settlement obviates the need to resolve the appropriate legal \nstandard applicable to Plaintiffs’ claims, which the Court previously declined to reach.  See \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 12 of 23    PageID 3189\n \nECF No. 124, Pg.ID 2821.  If, instead of settling, the parties were obligated to litigate this \nissue, it would impose further on the Court’s time at considerable expense to the parties.  \nFor these reasons, both sides agree that the complexity, expense, and likely duration of this \nlitigation favor settlement. \nC.  The Parties Have Engaged in Sufficient Discovery for Plaintiffs to Gauge the \nAdequacy of Settlement \nWhether the parties have engaged in sufficient discovery for Plaintiffs to gauge the \nadequacy  of  the  Settlement  turns  on  whether  Plaintiffs  have  “obtained  a  sufficient \nunderstanding of the case to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and the \nadequacy of the settlement.”  N.Y. State Teachers' Ret. Sys. v. Gen. Motors Co., 315 F.R.D. \n226, 236 (E.D. Mich. 2016).  Plaintiffs have taken three depositions and served three sets \nof Requests for Production, totaling twenty-four Requests, as well as nine interrogatories.  \nSee ECF No. 57-1– ECF No. 57-5.  Defendants have produced nearly 3,000 pages of \ndocuments.  In addition, the factual record was developed in numerous hearings before the \nCourt, including a hearing involving testimony from the Independent Inspector and another \ntwo-day evidentiary hearing which entailed live testimony from six witnesses.  See ECF \nNo. 108; ECF No. 111.   \nDiscovery is ongoing, but Plaintiffs have had a meaningful opportunity to gauge \nthe strengths and weaknesses of their claims, and they have concluded that a settlement is \nadequate.  The Decree addresses Plaintiffs’ concerns because it imposes numerous fail-\nsafes intended to protect the members of the Class and Subclass from COVID-19.  First, it \nrequires the Jail to provide regular reporting regarding the population of the Jail and the \nimpact of COVID-19 on the Jail’s population.  See Ex. B at ¶¶ 4–5.  Second, the Decree \ncalls for unannounced inspections at regular intervals by the Court-appointed Independent \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 13 of 23    PageID 3190\n \nInspector.  The Independent Inspector is empowered to conduct inspections commensurate \nand in accordance with the Court’s June 18, 2020 Order, ECF No. 56.  In addition, the \nIndependent Inspector will monitor the continuing work of the Jail’s Expeditor to evaluate \nClass and Subclass members for consideration of release on less restrictive conditions other \nthan detention.  See id. at ¶ 8.  Pursuant to the terms of the Decree, Defendants are obligated \nto use their best efforts to implement the recommendations of the Independent Inspector or \nto provide a written explanation for why, despite using their best efforts, Defendants are \nunable to do so.  The Independent Inspector will opine in subsequent visits whether \nDefendants have undertaken their best efforts. \nIn addition, the Decree provides machinery to ensure that the ventilation and air \nflow in the Jail is safe, see id. at ¶ 13, provisions to ensure that there is adequate testing for \nCOVID-19 in the Jail, reporting of the results of that testing, and appropriate quarantining \nprocedures, see id. at ¶¶ 14–18, and it ensures that Class and Subclass members will \ncontinue to receive adequate hygiene and personal protective equipment.  See id. at ¶ 19.  \nFurther, the Decree ensures that the Independent Inspector will pay particular attention to \nthe Jail’s efforts to maximize social distancing.  See id. at ¶ 20. \nThe  parties  have  also  agreed  that  they  will  endeavor  to  resolve  any  dispute \nregarding the Decree promptly and will only have recourse to the Court in the event of an \nemergency or if they cannot reach a resolution themselves.  Independently, the underlying \ncase will be stayed upon entry of the Decree unless and until Plaintiffs seek enforcement \nof the Decree.  This mechanism provides further comfort to Plaintiffs that Defendants will \nendeavor in good faith to uphold their obligations as set forth in the Decree and that, in the \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 14 of 23    PageID 3191\n \nevent of a dispute, Plaintiffs can quickly have recourse to the Court, which is particularly \nimportant in light of the urgency required to confront the pandemic. \nD.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nWhen inquiring into the likelihood of success on the merits for purposes of \napproving the Settlement, the Court “[weighs] the plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the \nmerits against the amount and form of the relief offered in the settlement.”  UAW, 497 F.3d \n615, 631 (quoting Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 (1981)).  The question is \nultimately “whether the parties are using settlement to resolve a legitimate legal and factual \ndisagreement.”  Id at 632. \nThe parties are settling to resolve legitimate factual and legal disagreements.  There \nhave been significant factual disagreements between the parties about the conditions in the \nJail.  Indeed, “[b]ecause of the dramatically different descriptions of the way in which \ndetainees were being confined at the Jail when this matter was filed, the Court allowed the \nfactual record related to [Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order] to be \nfurther developed,” ECF No. 124, Pg.ID 2804, and the Court ordered an independent \ninspection of the Jail.  ECF No. 45, Pg.ID 734.  Based on the Independent Inspector’s \nfindings, the testimony offered at the Court’s evidentiary hearing, and the documents \noffered into evidence, the Court made findings regarding the way in which people are being \ndetained at the Jail.  See ECF No. 124, Pg.ID 2804.  Still, the parties have continued to \ndispute the extent to which Class and Subclass members are safe in the Jail.   \nThe Settlement also resolves difficult and novel legal questions about which the \nparties disagree.  The parties provided the Court with extensive briefing and oral argument \nregarding the legal standard applicable in this case.  Plaintiffs allege that their constitutional \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment and their statutory rights under Title II of the ADA \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 15 of 23    PageID 3192\n \nand Section 504 of the Rehab Act are being violated because of their detention in the Jail \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, Plaintiffs brought four independent claims \nfor release: (i) unconstitutional punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; \n(ii) unconstitutional  confinement  in  violation  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment; \n(iii) discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability  in  violation  of  the  ADA;  and \n(iv) discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of the Rehab Act.  Among other \nthings, the parties disagreed about the standard applicable to pre-trial detainees under the \nFourteenth Amendment as well as the availability of the ADA and Rehab Act for habeas \nrelief. \nThe parties are also relying on the Settlement to ensure a quick and effective \nresolution to their dispute in light of the uncertainty and threat from the ongoing pandemic.  \nTennessee was recently “ground zero” in the nation’s virus surge.1  In light of the thorny \nfactual and legal difficulties that this case presents, absent the Settlement months could \npass before a judgment on the merits might be reached.  The Settlement is the most efficient \nand effective way in which to ensure that Plaintiffs and the Class and Subclass members \nare safe now and for the duration of the pandemic.   \nE.  Class Counsel and Class Representatives Agree that the Settlement Is \nFavorable \nIn their reasoned, professional judgment, counsel for both parties agree that the \nbenefits of the Settlement outweigh the risks of continued litigation.  Plaintiffs’ counsel \n                                                 \n1   Dan Levin and Juliana Kim, “Tennessee Is ‘Ground Zero’ in the Nation’s Virus Surge, and Christmas \nCould Make it Worse, The Governor Warns,” The New York Times (Dec. 22, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/22/world/covid-19-coronavirus/tennessee-is-ground-zero-in-\nthe-nations-virus-surge-and-christmas-could-make-it-worse-the-governor-warns. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 16 of 23    PageID 3193\n \nhave also consulted with the Class representatives, who all agree that the Settlement is \nmore beneficial than the risks of further litigation. \nF.  Reaction of Absent Class and Subclass Members  \nAfter  consulting  with  the  Class  representatives,  Plaintiffs’  counsel  have  no \nknowledge of any objections by absent Class and Subclass members.  Any objecting absent \nClass and Subclass members will have the opportunity to do so throughout the notice-and-\nobjection process explained below. \nG. The Settlement Serves the Public Interest \nThe Settlement resolves the parties’ disputes and provides immediate relief to \nmedically vulnerable people in the Jail who are in danger of severe consequences should \nthey become infected with the novel coronavirus.  The Decree contains detailed, concrete \nsteps that Defendants will undertake to protect against the virus’ spread in the Jail.  There \nis always a risk that jail outbreaks may spill into the community outside the jail as staff, \nvisitors, and incarcerated people cycle in and out of the facility.  The Decree will therefore \nalso help to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in Shelby County and Tennessee more \nbroadly.  This factor weighs strongly in favor of approving the Settlement, particularly in \nlight of the especially difficult public health crisis that the State of Tennessee is currently \nconfronting. \nII.  Reasonable Notice to the Class Requires Posting Notices In the Jail \n“The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who \nwould be bound by the proposal.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1).  Two forms of notice are \nattached hereto as Exhibits D and E.  The first version, Exhibit D, is written in plain text \nand is intended to be understood by individuals with a fifth grade or lower literacy level \n(the “Plain Text Notice”).  The second version, Exhibit E, is slightly more complex, and is \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 17 of 23    PageID 3194\n \nintended to be understood by individuals who read at a higher literacy level (the “Detailed \nNotice” and together with the Plain Text Notice, the “Notices”).   \nThe manner of providing notice is reasonable when it “apprise[s] the . . . members \nof the class of the terms of the proposed settlement so that class members may come to \ntheir own conclusions about whether the settlement serves their interests.”  UAW, 497 F.3d \nat 630 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re Gen. Tire & Rubber Co. Sec. Litig., \n726 F.2d 1075, 1086 (6th Cir. 1984) (upholding notice that “described the terms of the \nsettlement, the reasons for [class representatives’ decision to settle], the legal effect of the \nsettlement and the rights of the [class members] to voice their objections”).  “Due process \ndoes not, however, require actual notice to each party intended to be bound by the \nadjudication of a representative action.”  Fidel v. Farley, 534 F.3d 508, 514 (6th Cir. 2008)  \n(emphasis in original); see also In re S. Ohio Corr. Facility, 173 F.R.D. 205, 211–12 (S.D. \nOhio April 22, 1997) (finding manner of notice reasonable where “[d]efendants posted a \ncopy of the notice in a conspicuous place in the cellblocks of all the Ohio adult male \nprisons”). \nIn UAW, the Sixth Circuit concluded notice was “reasonably calculated, under all \nthe circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford \nthem an opportunity to present their objections” because “[t]he notice . . . clearly explained \nits purpose, discussed the nature of the pending suit and proposed class and accurately \nsummarized the 76-page settlement agreement and incorporated exhibits in a little over \nfour pages.”  UAW, 497 F.3d at 629–30.  Additionally, “enclosed with the notice was a \ncopy of the settlement agreement, ensuring that [class members] would have full access to \nthe very document the district court would examine at the fairness hearing.”  Id. at 630.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 18 of 23    PageID 3195\n \nHere, the substance of the two forms of the notice is adequate.  Like in UAW, the Detailed \nNotice discusses the suit and summarizes the Decree in less than four pages.  The Plain \nText Notice discusses the suit and summarizes the Decree in ten pages that are accessible \nand easy to understand.  Also like in UAW, the Class members will have the opportunity \nto review the full Decree should they choose to do so. \nThe manner of notice is also reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of \nthe Decree and give Class and Subclass members an opportunity to object.  The Parties \nhave prepared two versions of the notice to ensure all Class and Subclass members can \nunderstand the terms of the settlement, irrespective of literacy level, education level, and \nlanguage.  The Plain Text Notice is intended to be understood by individuals with a fifth \ngrade or lower literacy level, while the Detailed Notice is slightly more complex, and is \nintended to be understood by individuals who read at a higher literacy level.  The Plain \nText Notice will be posted in both English and Spanish to ensure all Class and Subclass \nmembers can understand the contents.  The Plain Text Notice will be posted in each of the \nhousing units of the Jail.   \nNext to each posting, there will be a message indicating that the pod counselor has \ncopies of the Detailed Notice, the Consent Decree, and the Court Order defining the Class \nand Subclass for detainees to review.  Each pod counselor will retain copies of the English \nand Spanish versions of the Notices, the Consent Decree, and the Court Order defining the \nClass and Subclass.  Each pod counselor will maintain these copies and will provide \ndetainees with access to review these copies upon request.  In this way, Class and Subclass \nmembers will be able to access the Notices and the Consent Decree, much like the proposed \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 19 of 23    PageID 3196\n \nUAW class members could access the notice and the 76-page settlement agreement that the \nnotice summarized.  \nThe Notices explain in simple terms that Class and Subclass members can object to \nthe terms of the Consent Decree by writing out their objections and mailing them to the \nCourt.  The Notices also provide a toll-free phone number that Class and Subclass members \ncan call from the Jail to discuss the Settlement with Plaintiffs’ counsel. \nIn the event the Court enters the Consent Decree, the Jail will modify these \nprocedures.  The Jail will post a message in the communal areas that indicates the Consent \nDecree is available for review upon request from a pod counselor.  The Jail will maintain \na copy of the Consent Decree with each pod counselor until the Consent Decree is no longer \nin place.  Providing notice in this manner is reasonably calculated to apprise all current and \nfuture members of the Class and Subclass of the terms of the settlement.    \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the parties respectfully request that the Court grant their \njoint Motion. \nDated and jointly and respectfully submitted this 22nd day of January, 2021.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161   Filed 01/22/21   Page 20 of 23    PageID 3197\n \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \nBy:      /s/ Nathan D.

This \npaper talks about an agreement to make changes in the Jail to end the court case. \nThis paper gives general information about the court case and what is happening. \nThere is a longer paper that has all of the details about this case.  You can ask for \nthe longer paper from your pod counselor.  \nIntroduction \nThis paper talks about a court case about COVID-19 in the Shelby County Jail.  \nIn April 2020, lawyers from the ACLU, Just City, \nand other organizations started a court case about \nCOVID-19 in the Shelby County Jail.  Another word \nfor this court case is a “lawsuit.”   \n \nThe lawsuit said that the jail was not safe for \npeople who have medical problems or \ndisabilities because of COVID-19.    \nPeople with things like diabetes, asthma, \ncancer, and HIV are more likely to get very \nsick if they get COVID-19.  People with \nother medical problems are also at high \nrisk.   \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-4   Filed 01/22/21   Page 3 of 11    PageID 3218\n \nThese are just a few examples.  People who are older are also more likely to get \nvery sick if they get COVID-19. \nThe court case was a special kind of case called a “class action.” This means that it \nwas a case trying to make changes for many people.  The court case was trying to \nmake things safer for people who have medical problems or disabilities in the jail.  \nEven if you never talked to any \nlawyers about the case, you might be \npart of it if you have a medical \nproblem or disability.  That is because \na “class action” makes changes for big \ngroups of people.  \nYou are part of this case if you are in \njail and you are at high risk for COVID-\n19.  People who are part of this case \nare called “Class Members”.  The “class” means the group of people in the jail \nwho are part of this case.  You are part of the “class” even if you have never \ntalked to any of the lawyers at the ACLU or Just City.  \nHow Do I Know If I Am Part of the Case? Am I a Class Member?  \nThese people are part of the case: \n•  Everyone who is 65 years old or older \n•  Everyone who is “medically vulnerable”  This means people who have \nmedical problems that make it more dangerous if they get COVID-19. \nPeople with these things are “high risk” if they get COVID-19.  If you have \none of these conditions, you are part of the case:  \no  Heart disease \no  Diabetes \no  High blood pressure \no  Poorly Controlled HIV \no  Cancer (if you have cancer now or if you had it in the past) \no  Moderate to Severe Asthma  \no  Lung disease, like COPD \no  Kidney disease undergoing dialysis \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-4   Filed 01/22/21   Page 4 of 11    PageID 3219\n \no  Autoimmune disorders, like lupus \no  History of organ transplant  \n•  Everyone who is “obese” –have a body mass index of more than 40. \n \nAgreement About This Case \nCourt cases take a very long time.  Since this case started, the lawyers for the \nACLU and the lawyers for the jail have been talking to each other.  They have \nbeen trying to come to an agreement that would be ok with everyone.   \n \n \nNow, the lawyers have an agreement.  The jail \nhas agreed to follow certain procedures to \nprotect people from COVID-19.  \nThe full list of these procedures is available \nfrom your pod counselor.  \n \n \n \nThe jail will make changes to clean the air better to protect people \nfrom COVID-19.  \n \n \nA person from the outside, called an “inspector,” will come to \nthe jail and look at what is happening and see if it is safe.  \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-4   Filed 01/22/21   Page 5 of 11    PageID 3220\n \nPeople who experience symptoms will get tested for \nCOVID-19.  \n \n \nBut, if you are a member of the Class, you can say if you think the agreement on \nthis paper is ok or not.  If you are part of the case, you can say what you think \nabout this agreement. \nYou can ask questions.  You can also say if you disagree, or if you think the case \nshould not end or if you think the agreement is not good.  \nThis paper talks about how to do these things.  \nIf you think this agreement is ok, you do not have to do anything!  But if you have \nquestions, or if you disagree, you can tell the lawyers about them.  Or you can tell \nthe court and the judge about what you think too.  \n \nYou can also call this toll-free \nnumber if you have questions \nor concerns.  You can call 800-\n351-4313 from 9 a.m. to 12 \np.m. if you do not understand \nwhat this paper says. \nWhat is Happening Now \nThe lawyers in this case have an agreement about how to end the case.  This \nagreement is called a “consent decree.”  This is a legal word.  It means an \nagreement that everyone must follow.  It is a long process to do a consent decree. \nHere is how it works. \n•  First, the lawyers agree on how they think the case could end.  The jail \nagreed to follow certain procedures to protect people from COVID.  The \nACLU and Just City lawyers think these procedures are good.  The lawyers \nwrite down what they agree on.  The paper with this agreement is the \n“consent decree.”  \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-4   Filed 01/22/21   Page 6 of 11    PageID 3221\n \nThis already happened. \n•  Then, the people in the jail can say what they think about the “consent \ndecree.”  They can read the plan.  They can ask the lawyers questions.  They \ncan tell the judge if they do not like the agreement.  \nThis is what this paper is about.  This is happening now.  \n•  Then, the judge thinks about the consent decree and makes a decision.  The \njudge reads the consent decree.  The judge reads and thinks about what \npeople in the jail think.  The judge reads and thinks about what the lawyers \nsay.  Then the judge can “approve” the consent decree.  That means that it \nis official.  Or, the judge can tell the lawyers they have to make changes to \nit. \nThe judge will make her decision on _______________. \n•  After the judge “approves” the consent decree, the jail must do what the \nconsent decree says.  They must follow the rules in it.  \n \nWhat the Agreement Says \nThis part talks about what the jail is going to do to protect people from COVID-19. \nThis part says what is in the “consent decree.”  These are the most important \nthings that the jail has agreed to do.  There is a long legal paper called the \n“Consent Decree” that says exactly what the jail has to do.  You can look at the \nwhole consent decree. \nThese are the big things in the consent decree: \nInspecting (Coming to the Jail) \nSomeone from the outside who is not part of this lawsuit \nwill visit the jail.  This person is called an “Independent \nInspector.”  That person does not work for the jail or the \nsheriff’s office.  That person does not work for the ACLU. \nThe person is “independent”.  The Inspector will be \nsomeone who knows about how jails work, and about how \nto keep people safe in jails.  \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-4   Filed 01/22/21   Page 7 of 11    PageID 3222\n \nThe inspector will come at least once every 90 days.  That is once every 3 months. \nThe inspector will not tell the jail before they visit – the visits will be \n“unannounced.”  The inspector can look all around at the jail.  The inspector can \nlook at papers that say how many people are in the jail.  The inspector can learn \nhow many people have been tested for COVID.  \nThe inspector will write reports after each visit.  The reports will say what is \nhappening in the jail about COVID.  The reports will say what the jail should do \ndifferently to protect people from COVID.  The jail must think about those reports. \nThe jail must do what the inspector says, or else say why they cannot do that. \nVentilation (Air Movement) \nThe jail is changing its “ventilation system.”  “Ventilation \nsystem” means how air moves through a building.  The jail \nis making changes to make sure the air is safe.  The jail is \nmaking changes to make sure that COVID does not go from \none cell to another through the ventilation system, like \nthrough heating or air conditioning pipes or ducts.  \nThe jail will show what these changes are.  If the ACLU \nlawyers think these changes are not good enough, and the air is still not safe, then \nan expert will visit the jail.  The expert will look at the ventilation system and say \nwhat the jail should do differently.  \nCOVID Testing  \nAny person who has “COVID symptoms” can get a \nCOVID test.  “COVID symptoms” means the kinds of \nthings that people who have COVID sometimes feel.  \n \n“COVID Symptoms” includes: \n•  Fever \n•  Cough \n•  Chills (feeling very cold and shivery) \n•  Sore throat \n•  Losing sense of taste or smell  \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-4   Filed 01/22/21   Page 8 of 11    PageID 3223\n \n•  Hard to breathe \n•  Headache \n•  Body or muscle aches \n•  Runny nose  \n•  Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) or vomiting (throwing up) \n•  Diarrhea \nAnyone in the jail who has any of these things can get a COVID test.  \nThe jail will tell people if they have COVID as soon as practicable after they get a \ntest.  \nAny person who has been near someone who has COVID can get a test too if \nrecommended by applicable guidelines.  If you have been near someone who has \nCOVID, you may be offered a test even if you don’t feel sick. \nPeople who have COVID \nIf a person has COVID, the jail will do things to \nprotect the person with COVID and to protect \nthe other people in the jail.  \nAny person who tests positive for COVID will be \n“isolated.”  This means the person will be \nseparated from other people.  This helps to stop \nCOVID from spreading. \nPeople who are “isolated” can still have their personal things.  They can still have \nrec time.  They can still get medical care.  \nThe jail will do “contact tracing.”  “Contact tracing” means finding out who a \nperson with COVID has been near.  Anyone who has been close to a person with \nCOVID can get tested if recommended by applicable guidelines.  Anyone who has \nbeen close to a person with COVID will be “quarantined” if recommended by \napplicable guidelines.  This means they are separated from other people to stop \nCOVID from spreading.  \nPeople who are “quarantined” can still have their personal things.  They can still \nhave rec time.

There are 2 kinds of masks. \nSome masks are made of cloth, and they can be washed.  \nSome masks are called “surgical masks,” like doctors wear.  Those are made of a \nspecial kind of paper, and they cannot be washed.   \n \nThe jail will give members of the Class either: \n•  3 “surgical” (paper) masks or \n \n \n•  2 cloth masks \n \n \nFor people who have  “surgical” (paper) masks, the jail \nwill give each person 3 new masks once a week.

The inspector \nwill look at how many people are in the jail and if there is enough room for people \nto be “social distanced.”  \nThe inspector will write in reports about this.  The inspector will say if there are \nthings the jail should do differently.

Lawyers for the Class and \nlawyers for the Sheriff have spent several months attempting to reach an agreement to end this \nlawsuit.  They have reached a proposed settlement agreement in the form of a proposed Consent \nDecree, which is summarized below.  The Consent Decree is also available for your review by \nrequesting it from a pod counselor.  The Court must decide whether to approve the Consent \nDecree.  Before doing so, if you are a member of the Class or Subclass, you have the opportunity \nto submit any objection to the Court if you disagree with the terms of the settlement.  Please be \nadvised that if you fail to follow the exact procedures and deadline for filing objections to the \nproposed settlement, you will lose any opportunity to object to any part of the proposed Consent \nDecree. \n \n  The class action lawsuit dealt with whether people at the highest risk of serious illness if \nthey catch COVID-19 were safe.  You are a member of the “Class” if you are 65 years old or older, \nor if you have a medical condition that puts you at higher risk of serious illness if you get COVID-\n19, such as heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, COPD, are obese with a body mass index (BMI) \nof over 40, as well as other conditions.  Most people in the “Class” are also in the “Subclass,” \n(unless you are in the Class because of your age or BMI).  The Subclass are people with disabilities \nprotected by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  If you are not sure whether you are in the Class \nor Subclass, you can refer to the Court’s order certifying the classes which is attached here and \navailable from each pod counselor or you can call this toll-free number, 800-351-4313, from 9 a.m. \nto 12 p.m. \n \nPROPOSED CONSENT DECREE \n \nTo resolve this case, the lawyers for the parties have agreed to request that the Court enter the \nattached proposed Consent Decree as an Order of the Federal District Court.  This means that the \nJail would need to comply with the terms of the Consent Decree.  If the Court enters the Consent \nDecree, but the Jail does not follow the terms of the Consent Decree, the lawyers for the Class can \ntell the Court that the Jail is violating the agreement.  The Court will ensure all parties follow the \nterms of the agreement.  If the Court enters the Consent Decree, but you feel the Jail is not \nfollowing the terms outlined below, you can call the lawyers for the Class at this toll-free number, \n800-351-4313, from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m.  You can call collect and you will not be recorded.  A \nsummary of the key terms of the proposed Consent Decree is as follows: \n \n  1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-5   Filed 01/22/21   Page 3 of 5    PageID 3229\n \nIndependent Inspections and Reporting \n \n•  The Jail will report COVID-19-related data to an Independent Inspector and to the lawyers \nfor the Class on a periodic basis.  This data will include the total population of the Jail as a \nwhole and by housing unit, the number of COVID-19 tests conducted, and the results of \nthose tests. \n \n•  The Inspector will come at least once every ninety days to inspect the Jail.  The Inspector \nwill make unannounced visits.  The Inspector must be granted unrestricted access to the \nJail. \n \nVentilation \n \n•  The Jail is currently improving the ventilation and air quality.  The Jail will have to prove \nto the lawyers for the Class that the ventilation and air quality are safe.  If the lawyers for \nthe Class still think that either the ventilation or the air quality is unsafe, then an Expert \nwill come to inspect the Jail.  The Expert will make recommendations to the Jail.  The Jail \nwill either implement those recommendations, or will explain why it will not or cannot \nimplement them. \n \nTesting, Isolation, and Quarantine for COVID-19 \n \n•  All individuals who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 shall be offered a test for \nCOVID-19 as soon as practicable. \n \n•  All individuals tested for COVID-19 shall be informed of their test results as soon as \npracticable. \n \n•  When a person tests positive for COVID-19, the Jail will perform contact tracing.  People \nwho come into contact with someone that tests positive for COVID-19 will be offered tests \nand quarantined as recommended by the applicable guidelines from the CDC and/or the \nShelby County Health Department.   \n \n•  Individuals who test positive will be isolated.  Individuals who are isolated will only \nreturn to the general population in accordance with CDC guidance. \n \n•  Individuals who are quarantined or isolated because they have contracted or been exposed \nto COVID-19 will have access to personal items and property, recreation time, and medical \ncare. \n \nHygiene and Personal Protective Equipment \n \n•  In addition to the scheduled cleaning times, Class and Subclass members will be provided \naccess to cleaning products to clean their cells and sleeping areas. \n \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-5   Filed 01/22/21   Page 4 of 5    PageID 3230\n \n•  Individuals of the Class and Subclass will receive three surgical masks that must be \nreplaced every week, or two two-ply cloth masks that the Jail must launder twice a week.  \nThe Jail must replace these cloth masks as needed.  If the Jail does not have enough of \nthese two-ply cloth masks, it may give individuals two cloth masks approved by the \nTennessee Department of Health.  These must also be laundered twice a week and replaced \nas needed.  The Jail must replace these cloth masks with two-ply cloth masks as soon as \npossible.  Two-ply cloth masks have two layers of cloth instead of one. \n \nSocial Distancing \n \n•  The Independent Inspector will review the Jail’s efforts to maximize social distancing and \nmake recommendations for improving social distancing.  The Jail must implement these \nrecommendations, or explain why it will not or cannot implement them. \n•  The Independent Inspector will review whether the population levels of the Jail are safe.  \nThe Independent Inspector will also review the work of the Jail’s Expeditor to evaluate \nClass and Subclass members to determine whether their cases should be presented to the \nDistrict Attorney, criminal defense counsel, and/or the presiding Judge for consideration \nof release on less restriction conditions than detention.   \nREASONS FOR PROPOSING COURT APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT DECREE \n \nCounsel for the parties decided to settle the case because of the risks of litigation and the \nneed for a quick and effective resolution to protect members of the Class and Subclass from \nCOVID-19.  The lawyers cannot control what would happen if the case went to trial.  It would also \ntake many months to litigate the case to trial and to receive a judgment from the Court.  A \nsettlement achieves immediate protections from the pandemic for members of the Class and \nSubclass.  Plaintiffs’ counsel believes that these protections are substantial and that they may \nexceed what could be obtained through litigation.  Counsel for both parties believe the settlement \nis fair and reasonable.   \n \nPROCEDURE AND DEADLINES TO OBJECT TO THE CONSENT DECREE \n \nThe Court has set a hearing to consider whether to approve the proposed Consent Decree.  \nThat hearing is set to occur on ____________ ___, 2021 at the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee. \n \nIf you agree with the proposed Consent Decree, which is available from your respective pod \ncounselor, you do not need to do anything.  Once the Court enters the Consent Decree, everyone \nin the Jail and in the Class and Subclass will benefit from it automatically.  If you are a member \nof the Class or Subclass and wish to object to the terms of the Consent Decree, you must do so in \nwriting no later than ____________ ___, 2021. \n \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-5   Filed 01/22/21   Page 5 of 5    PageID 3231\n \nYour written objections should be addressed as follows: \n \nClerk of the Court \nRE: Busby et. al v.

We are in the midst of the most significant global pandemic in generations.  \nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious and deadly respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus \n(SARS-CoV-2).  The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be at least 2.3 percent, which is \nseveral  times  more  than  the  common  flu  that  kills  thousands  a  year.1    The  World  Health \nOrganization estimates that one in five people who contract the disease requires hospitalization.2  \n2.  This action seeks urgent habeas and injunctive relief to protect medically vulnerable \npeople and people with disabilities detained at Shelby County Jail3 (the “Jail”) who are at high risk \nof severe injury or death from COVID-19.  Favian Busby and Michael Edgington (the “Named \nPlaintiffs”) seek to represent a class of all current and future medically vulnerable (as defined \nbelow) pretrial detainees held at the Jail who, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (the “CDC”), are at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19 (the \n“Class”).  Named Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of current and future pretrial detainees \nwho are medically vulnerable and at high risk of severe injury or death from COVID-19 due to \ndisabilities protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act (the “Subclass”). \n                                                 \n1   The University of Tennessee Health Science Center estimates the fatality rate may be as high \nas 3.4 percent and notes that the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 are “100s of times worse \nthan influenza.” Expert Responses, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, \nhttps://uthsc.edu/coronavirus/expert-responses.php (last visited May 19, 2020).  As of May \n17, 2020, there were 4,651,119 confirmed cases globally, with 312,119 deaths and 1,700,354 \nrecoveries.  Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and \nEngineering at Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, \nhttps://cutt.ly/StEyn2U; see also Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), UpToDate, \nhttps://cutt.ly/GtJYSkj (as of May 15, 2020, estimated overall fatality rate of 2.3 percent \nglobally). \n2   Q&A on Coronaviruses (COVID-19), “Should I Worry About COVID-19?,” World Health \nOrganization, https://cutt.ly/YtEyrxl (last visited May 19, 2020). \n3   For the purposes of this motion, “Shelby County Jail” or the “Jail” refers to the detention \nfacility located at 201 Poplar Ave., Memphis, TN 38103. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 26    PageID 3\n \n3.    COVID-19 has already spread throughout the Jail, infecting hundreds of people, \nyet Defendants continue to detain the members of the Class and Subclass (collectively, the \n“Classes”) despite the fact that they are likely to suffer severe infection or death if they contract \nCOVID-19 and despite the Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ (“Plaintiffs”) high risk of contracting the disease \nby virtue of their housing at the Jail.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek emergency relief from this Court \nprovisionally  certifying  the  Class  and  Subclass  and  compelling  Defendants  to  (a)  release4 \nimmediately Favian Busby and Michael Edgington; (b) promptly identify COVID vulnerable \nindividuals held at the Jail who are members of the Class; and (c) promptly release members of \nthe Class from detention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  Plaintiffs bring this putative class action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and for relief \nfrom both detention that violates their Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution \nand pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. and 29 U.S.C. § 794 for relief from disability \ndiscrimination.  \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas jurisdiction) and Article I, Section 9, \nclause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (the Suspension Clause). \n                                                 \n4   The term “release,” as used throughout this Petition, refers to the discharge of detained \nindividuals from the physical confines of the Shelby County Jail, not necessarily release from \nall forms of custody.  Release options may include, but are not limited to: supervised release \n(including through the use of GPS or other forms of location monitoring), halfway house \nresidential placement, transfer to a hospital or other facility, or diversion to alternative \ncommunity and treatment programs.  Indeed, Shelby County already maintains a Pretrial \nServices Department “offering alternatives to incarceration at every stage of the criminal \njustice system.”  See Shelby Cty. Tenn., Pretrial Services, available at \nhttps://www.shelbycountytn.gov/250/Justice-Initiatives (last visited May 20, 2020). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 26    PageID 4\n \n6.  Venue lies in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, the \njudicial district in which Plaintiffs are currently in custody.  Venue is proper in the Western District \nof Tennessee under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as venue is proper in any district in which a defendant \nresides. \nPARTIES \n7.  Michael Edgington is a pretrial detainee at Shelby County Jail.  He is 60 years old, \nputting him at high risk of serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-19. \n8.  Favian Busby is a pretrial detainee at Shelby County Jail.  He has diabetes and takes \ninsulin.  Additionally, he has developed hypertension as a result of his diabetes.  These conditions \nput him at high risk of serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-19.   \n9.  Respondent-Defendant  Floyd  Bonner,  Jr.  is  the  Sheriff  of  Shelby  County, \nTennessee and may be served with process at 201 Poplar Avenue, 9th Floor, Memphis, Tennessee \n38103.  Defendant Bonner is named in this action in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Shelby \nCounty. \n10.  Respondent-Defendant  Shelby  County  Sheriff’s  Department  is  a  Tennessee \ngovernmental department which, by virtue of its custody of Plaintiffs, is a party defendant to this \nmatter.  Defendant Shelby County Sheriff’s Department may be served with process by serving \nSheriff Floyd Bonner, Jr.   \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 26    PageID 5\n \nFACTS \nA.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members are at High Risk of Severe Injury or Death from \nCOVID-19. \n11.  COVID-19 is an extremely infectious and deadly disease that is transmitted from \nperson to person.  The University of Tennessee Health Science Center indicates COVID-19 may \nbe hundreds of times more fatal than influenza.5   \n12.  On March 12, 2020, Governor Bill Lee declared a state of emergency in Tennessee \nin response to COVID-19.  The Tennessee Department of Health notes that as of May 19, 2020, \n18,378 Tennesseans have been infected with COVID-19, with 1,498 hospitalizations and 305 \ndeaths.  The highest number of deaths to date have occurred in Shelby County, which has the \nsecond highest number of cases.   \n13.  As of May 20, 2020, at least 4,761,559 people worldwide have tested positive for \nthe virus, and 317,559 people have died.6   In the United States, at least 1,504,830 people have \ncontracted the virus, and at least 90,340 people have died from it.7  Early data suggests COVID-\n19’s mortality rate in the U.S. is 1.3 percent, and as high as 3.6 percent in some counties.8 \n14.  COVID-19 can cause grave injury to the lungs and heart, causing myocarditis, or \ninflammation of the heart muscle.  COVID-19 can also result in permanent injury to the kidneys. \n                                                 \n5   University of Tennessee Health Science Center, supra note 1. \n6   Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, World Health Organization  \nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 (last visited May 20, \n2020). \n7   Cases in the U.S., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html (last visited May \n20, 2020). \n8  Anirban Basu, Estimating The Infection Fatality Rate Among Symptomatic COVID-19 Cases \nIn The United States, Health Affairs (May 7, 2020) \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00455. \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 26    PageID 6\n \n15.  Patients who experience severe infections from COVID-19 require supportive care, \nincluding recourse to scarce medical equipment and specialized care providers, who are able to \nmonitor and implement the care these individuals require.  This level of support can exceed local \nhealth-care resources.   \n16.  Patients  who  survive  severe  COVID-19  infections  often  require  extensive \nrehabilitation to mitigate neurologic damage and the loss of respiratory capacity.  Many who suffer \nfrom severe infections will likely experience lifelong limitations and disabilities. \n17.  Age is a significant risk factor for complications and death.  The mortality rate is at \nleast 1-3 percent for those over 55, and less than 1 percent for those under 55.9  Certain underlying \nmedical conditions and disabilities increase the risk of complications or death from COVID-19 \nregardless of age.10  The University of Tennessee Health Science Center notes that medically \n                                                 \n9     Severe Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (Mar. 27, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm. \n10   Known conditions associated with a heightened risk of mortality and complications from \nCOVID-19 include, but are not limited to: blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or the \nuse of blood thinners; chronic kidney disease; chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and \nchronic hepatitis; cancer or cancer treatments; organ or bone marrow transplant; the use of \nimmunosuppressant medications; HIV or AIDS; diabetes; inherited metabolic disorders and \nmitochondrial disorders; heart disease, including coronary artery disease, congenital heart \ndisease, and heart failure; lung disease, including asthma and COPD (chronic bronchitis or \nemphysema); neurological and neurologic development conditions such as cerebral palsy, \nstroke, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury; severe obesity (which is defined as having \na BMI of 40 or higher); intellectual or developmental disability that may inhibit a person’s \nability to understand or act on prevention measures or communicate symptoms, and any other \ncondition or treatment that weakens immune response.  See Harvard Medical School, If you \nare at higher risk: How to reduce risk of infection and what to do if you get sick, Harvard \nHealth Publishing (updated May 6, 2020), https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk; see also High-Risk Conditions, Centers For Disease \nControl And Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/underlying-\nconditions.html (last visited May 16, 2020); University of Tennessee Health Science Center, \nsupra note 1 (“The elderly, persons with chronic respiratory or cardiac diseases, pregnant \nwomen, and immunocompromised persons are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-\n19.”).  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 7 of 26    PageID 7\n \nvulnerable persons—those who are likely to suffer worse outcomes if they were to contract \nCOVID-19—may well need to “stay at home as much as possible” because “the only current \nadvice is to avoid others who might be sick.”11 \n18.  According to the CDC, African Americans are at increased risk for the kinds of \nmedical conditions and disabilities that increase the risk of serious illness or death from COVID-\n19.  The rate of diabetes is 60 percent higher in African Americans than in Caucasian Americans;12 \nthe rate of hypertension is 40 percent higher.13  Recent analysis of CDC data shows that the \nCOVID-19 mortality rate among African Americans is 2.6 times that of white Americans.14  On \nany given day, the population of the Jail is more than 86 percent African American.15  Both the \nNamed Plaintiffs are African American.   \nB.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members are Likely to Contract COVID-19 Unless They Are \nReleased. \n19.  Experts agree that COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that \nare inhaled by people nearby.  Asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 can also transmit it; public \nhealth officials estimate that as many as half of all transmitted cases pass from an infected person \n                                                 \n11   University of Tennessee Health Science Center, supra note 1. \n12   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, Diabetes and \nAfrican Americans (accessed May 18, 2020), \nhttps://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=18. \n13   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, Heart Disease \nand African Americans (accessed May 18, 2020), \nhttps://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=19. \n14   APM Research Lab Staff, Covid-19 Deaths by Races and Ethnicity in the U.S., APM \nResearch Lab (May 12, 2020), https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race. \n15   MacArthur Foundation, Safety + Justice Challenge, “Shelby County, TN,” \nhttp://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/challenge-site/shelby-county/ (last visited May 20, \n2020) \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 8 of 26    PageID 8\n \nwith few or no symptoms.16  Experts at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center stress \nthat people infected with COVID-19 may be infectious for upwards of 2–3 weeks, though any \nsymptoms they experience last for far less time.17 \n20.  There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.  The only known way in which to \nmitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19 is to maintain at least six feet of distance from other \npeople, and to practice vigilant hygiene, including frequent hand-washing, wearing face masks and \ngloves, and frequently sanitizing high-touch surfaces.18  Experts at the University of Tennessee \nHealth Science Center note in particular that social distancing and rigorous hygiene are the “best \nprevention” and “better than even an N95 mask.”19  \n21.  Accordingly, Governor Lee has required all Tennesseans who leave their homes to \nadhere to social distancing measures recommended by the CDC.  Similarly, the Shelby County \nHealth Department has advised all businesses to require that their employees and customers wear \nface masks and keep six feet from one another.20 \n22.  Because it is impossible to practice social distancing in prisons and jails, and \nbecause these facilities are not sanitized on a daily basis and hygiene is generally lacking, prisons \n                                                 \n16   Nathan W.

In \naddition to causing significant harm to those incarcerated, rampant outbreaks of COVID-19 in jails \nbecome the direct cause of additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among jail staff and \nthe surrounding community in which a jail sits.22  \n23.  Across the country, governments and jail staff have recognized the threat that \nCOVID-19 poses to incarcerated people and the surrounding community.  Jail administrators in \nnumerous states, including Alabama, California, Colorado, Ohio, and New Jersey, have concluded \nthat widespread jail release is a necessary and appropriate public health intervention.23 \n24.  Courts have intervened across the country to release COVID-vulnerable detainees \nwho are at high risk of severe infection or death from the disease.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Williams, \nNo. 4:20-cv-00794, 2020 WL 1940882 (N.D.

Across Tennessee, positive tests in correctional facilities continue to rise.26  As \nreported on April 17, 2020, 23 pretrial detainees at the Jail were tested; five were positive for \nCOVID-19.27  The Jail tested 266 pretrial detainees and employees on or about April 25th, and as \nreported on April 29th, seventy-two percent tested positive. 28  In data released on May 15, 151 \npretrial detainees and 66 jail staff tested positive for COVID-19; publicly-available data does not \nyet show how many were tested in arriving at these numbers.29  The true numbers in the Jail are \n                                                 \n24   See also Malam v.

To date, one Shelby County \nJail employee has died from COVID-19.30 \n26.  Dr. Joe Goldenson, a physician with over 33 years of experience in correctional \nhealth care, has explained that conditions at jails prohibit social distancing and “exacerbate the \nspread of infectious diseases, particularly diseases like COVID-19.”  Likewise, Dr. Virginia \nFefferman has explained, “[t]he living conditions within the jail spread disease.  Incarcerated \npeople cannot practice social distancing due to the lack of space, overcrowding, or the requirement \nof constant supervision.  Incarcerated people are moved in groups from jail to court or, where court \nproceedings are halted due to this pandemic, forced to remain in their cells or dorms in close \nproximity to each other.  Incarcerated people often have limited access to products and equipment \nnecessary to practice good personal hygiene, such as soap, or hand sanitizer or cleaning products.”     \n27.  As a result, Dr. Goldenson believes that “medically vulnerable persons at Shelby \nCounty Jail are at grave risk of death or serious illness” and “must be released as soon as possible.”  \nLikewise, Dr. Fefferman has cautioned that “[e]ach additional day the jail system continues under \ncurrent operational standards will cost lives in both the incarcerated population and the broader \ncommunity each jail serves.”   \nC.  The Class Members Are Unsafe and Their Rights Are Being Violated. \n28.  At the Jail, the Named Plaintiffs live in “pods” with cells lining an open communal \narea.  Every cell has at least one person, and most have two people.   \n29.  When more than one person is in a cell, it is impossible to maintain a six-foot \ndistance from one another.  Detainees report spending up to 30 to 48 hours at a time in the same \ncell with another person.  Class members sleep in bunk beds, with one bed three to four feet \n                                                 \n30    Yolanda Jones, Sheriff’s Office Employee Dies From COVID-19,  DAILY MEMPHIAN (Apr. 21, 2020) \nhttps://dailymemphian.com/article/13185/sheriffs-office-employee-dies-from-covid-19.  \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 12 of 26    PageID 12\n \nanother.  Each cell also has an open toilet area and a sink that is shared by both cellmates.  Showers \nare in the communal area of the pod and are shared by all members of the pod.   \n30.  During mealtime, detainees are required to line up inches apart from each other to \nreceive their meal trays from other detainees who distribute meals as part of their work duties.  \nDetainees then sit four men to a table—sometimes squeezing in five or six men if there is not \nenough available seating—to eat their meal.  It is not possible to socially distance in the communal \narea.  People detained in the Jail were provided one mask on or around April 22, 2020.  Most of \nthose who received the masks have not been able to receive replacements.  Detainees use the same \nmetal utensils and cup for each meal and are responsible for maintaining their own utensils and \ncups.  They do not have access to a dishwasher or bleach for cleaning their utensils.   \n31.  Class members must also use, and reuse, the same “high-touch” items, such as \ntelephones and kiosks, and the Jail does not provide disinfectant or other cleaning supplies to \nsanitize these items.  The Jail gives Class members a clean change of clothes only once a week.  \nClass members must purchase soap from commissary, and if they cannot afford commissary soap \nthey must wait several days to get free soap.  The soap available for free is small, and only lasts \nthree or four days.  Class members are only rarely able to clean their cells, relying on staff to offer \ncleaning supplies.  Even when cleaning spray is available, Class members must use unwashed \ntowels to wipe down surfaces.  There is no hand sanitizer available to any Class members. \n32.  The Jail does not test for COVID-19 upon the intake of new arrestees.  If someone \ndisplays symptoms of COVID-19, he is still booked into the Jail but is escorted to an isolation pod.  \nBecause the Jail relies on reported symptoms to decide whom to quarantine, there is no system for \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 13 of 26    PageID 13\n \npreventing spread of COVID-19 among asymptomatic people, even though many infected with \nCOVID-19 may be asymptomatic while still capable of infecting others.31 \n33.  On April 29, 2020, staff at the Jail pepper-sprayed detainees in medical isolation \nfor  COVID-19.    This  exacerbated  the  difficulty  of  breathing  for  many  persons  already \nexperiencing symptoms including shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, coughing up blood, \nfevers, and chills.   \n34.  On May 19, 2020, staff at the Jail forced detainees who had been in quarantine for \nhaving contracted or been exposed to COVID-19 back into the general population.  Those being \nmoved from medical isolation were not retested for COVID-19 prior to being moved, nor were \nthey screened for symptoms of COVID-19.  Many detainees resisted the move because it put other \npeople in the Jail at risk of increased exposure to the virus: as one person in quarantined housing \nput it, “All we are looking for is to be re-tested before we are re-classified and rehoused. . . [I feel] \na moral obligation” not to pass the virus to anyone else.32 Jail staff pepper sprayed those individuals \nwho refused to move out of quarantine. \nD.  Respondent-Defendants Have Discriminated against the Members of the Subclass in \nViolation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n35.  Respondent-Defendants’ actions violate not only Class members’ constitutional \nrights, but also the Subclass members’ rights under disability rights laws.  The Jail has failed, and \ncontinues to fail, to make reasonable modifications to detention to ensure that people with \ndisabilities have an equal opportunity to participate in the adjudication of their criminal cases and \nto access jail services.  For example, the Jail has failed to make modifications to ensure that \n                                                 \n31   See Furukawa, supra note 14. \n32   Yolanda Jones, Inmates at 201 Poplar pepper-sprayed over move after COVID quarantine, \nDAILY MEMPHIAN (May 19, 2020) https://dailymemphian.com/article/14169/covid-19-201-\npoplar-anthony-buckner-shelby-county-sheriffs-office. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 14 of 26    PageID 14\n \nmembers of the Subclass can practice adequate social distancing, and has failed to implement a \nsystem for release as a modification to ensure Subclass members are alive to participate in the \nadjudication of their cases. \n36.  By  continuing  to  detain  Plaintiffs  with  disabilities,  Defendants’  policies  and \npractices violate the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.     \n37.  Plaintiff Favian Busby has been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension, for \nwhich he takes medication daily.  He also recently had surgery to implant a new joint between his \nfemur and hip, from which he is still recovering.  These conditions put Mr. Busby at high risk of \nsevere infection or death from COVID-19. \n38.  Four men in Mr. Busby’s pod tested positive for COVID-19 on April 24.  It is not \npossible for Mr. Busby to socially distance in his pod.  To use a phone or obtain medication, Mr. \nBusby must wait in crowded lines.  Staff do not socially distance and often do not wear masks, \nand Mr. Busby has not seen them wash their hands or use hand sanitizer.    \n39.  He has also seen other people in the pod with COVID-19 symptoms who have \navoided testing for fear of being put in isolation.  Staff also do not always follow quarantine \nprocedures.  Mr. Busby has seen people go into quarantine, return to the pod, exhibit symptoms \nagain, and yet not be sent back into quarantine.   \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n40.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedures on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals consisting of all \npretrial detainees in the custody of the Jail who are medically vulnerable (the “Class”).   \n41.  The Class is defined as follows: all current and future persons held at the Jail in \npretrial custody during the coronavirus pandemic who are aged 55 and older, as well as all current \nand future persons held at the Jail of any age who have: (a) lung disease, including asthma, chronic \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 15 of 26    PageID 15\n \nobstructive pulmonary  disease (e.g.,  bronchitis  or  emphysema),  or  other  chronic  conditions \nassociated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital heart disease, \ncongestive heart failure and coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including \nhepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) hypertension; (f) \ncompromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow \ntransplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune disease); (g) blood disorders \n(including  sickle  cell  disease);  (h)  inherited  metabolic  disorders;  (i)  history  of  stroke;  (j) \nneurological or developmental disability; (k) cancer or cancer treatments; (l) a BMI of 40 or more; \nand/or (m) muscular dystrophy or spinal cord injury. \n42.  Favian Busby also seeks to represent a subclass, consisting of all current and future \npretrial detainees in custody at the Jail who are medically vulnerable because of a disability as \ndefined in the ADA (the “Subclass”).  The Subclass includes people with all conditions listed in \nparagraph 42, except those who are medically vulnerable solely because of age or BMI. \n43.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder federal law.  It satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements \nfor maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n44.  Joinder is impracticable because (1) the Classes are numerous; (2) the Classes \ninclude future members, and (3) the Class members are incarcerated, rendering their ability to \ninstitute individual lawsuits limited, particularly in light of reduced legal visitation and court \nclosures in Shelby County. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 16 of 26    PageID 16\n \n45.  Numerosity:  On information and belief, there are at least 300 people in the \nproposed Class and Subclass.  First, there are currently over 200 people over 55 years old detained \nat the Jail.33  People in jails have higher rates of chronic health conditions than people in the general \npopulation.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it is estimated that 39.8 percent of people \nin jail have a chronic health condition.34  Virtually all of these people will be members of the Class \nand Subclass.  Further, as the below chart illustrates, health conditions that make COVID-19 \nparticularly dangerous are more prevalent in the incarcerated population than in the general \npublic.35  \n46.  Specific information regarding the size of the Class and the Subclass, as well as the \nidentity of the members of each group, is in Defendants’ exclusive control.   \n                                                 \n33   See Shelby Cty.

Commonality:  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the \nproposed Class and Subclass, including: (a) whether Defendants are detaining the members of the \nClass in violation of their constitutional rights; (b) whether Defendants’ policies and practices \ndiscriminate against the members of the Subclass in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct; and (c) whether Defendants are implementing policies and procedures to ensure social \ndistancing, and to provide adequate PPE, or otherwise following CDC guidance to protect Class \nmembers.   \n48.  Typicality:  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the Class as \na whole, including because (a) each Named Plaintiff is currently in Defendants’ custody and (b) \nthe Named Plaintiffs’ and all of the Class members’ claims arise from the same wrongful acts, \nomissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and are based on the same legal theories. \n49.  Adequacy:    The  Named  Plaintiffs  have  the  requisite  personal  interest  in  the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  The Named \nPlaintiffs have no interests adverse to the interests of the proposed Class.  The Named Plaintiffs \nretained pro bono counsel with experience and success in the prosecution of civil rights litigation.  \nCounsel for the Named Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among proposed Class members or between \ncounsel and proposed Class members. \n50.  Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to all proposed Class \nmembers.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs therefore seek Class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n51.  In  the  alternative,  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(b)(1)  are  satisfied  because \nprosecuting separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 18 of 26    PageID 18\n \nrespect to individual Class members that would establish incompatible standards for the party \nopposing the proposed Class. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution \n28 U.S.C. § 2241  \nThe Class Against All Defendants \n \n52.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n53.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, persons in pretrial custody cannot be punished \nas part of their detention.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979).  Punishment is \nestablished if the jailer’s conduct is either not rationally related to a legitimate, non-punitive \ngovernment purpose or excessive in relation to that purpose. \n54.  Under  general  circumstances,  Defendants  can  hold  pretrial  detainees  if,  after \nmaking individualized findings based on the person’s flight risk and danger to the community, and \nevaluating less restrictive options than jail, it is clear that nothing short of detention will mitigate \na credible risk of flight or danger.  But and as a condition of holding persons in pretrial custody, \nthe Jail must provide them with health care services and a safe environment, and cannot punish \nthem.  Here, Defendants have exposed the Named Plaintiffs and the Class members to high risk of \nsevere infection or death from COVID-19.  Continuing to detain the Named Plaintiffs and the \nClass members is punitive, not rationally related to a legitimate purpose, and/or excessive in \nrelation to any legitimate purpose. \n55.  Accordingly, Defendants, as supervisors, direct participants, and policy makers for \nShelby County, have violated the rights of the Named Plaintiffs and the Class members under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 19 of 26    PageID 19\n \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Confinement in Violation of the  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n28 U.S.C. § 2241   \nThe Class Against All Defendants \n \n56.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n57.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, corrections officials are required to provide for \nthe reasonable health and safety of persons in pretrial custody.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. \n307, 315–16, 324 (1982) (the state has an “unquestioned duty” to provide adequate medical care \nfor detained persons). \n58.  Corrections officials are required to provide for the reasonable health and safety of \npersons in pretrial custody, including risks of future harm to their health and safety.  See Helling \nv. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33–34 (1993) (“That the Eighth Amendment protects against future \nharm to inmates is not a novel proposition. . . . [i]t would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates \nwho plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing \nyet had happened to them”).  \n59.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the government must provide incarcerated \npersons with reasonable safety and address serious medical needs that arise in jail to at least the \nsame degree of persons in custody subsequent to a conviction, if not to a higher degree.  Deliberate \nindifference to the serious risk COVID-19 poses to members of the Class violates this right. \n60.  Named Plaintiffs and the members of the Class are at high risk of severe infection \nfrom COVID-19.  The Jail is rife with confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Named Plaintiffs and Class \nmembers, because of their medical conditions and COVID-vulnerability, cannot be safe in the \ndorm-style facilities in which they are housed at the Jail.  The only way to ensure their safety and \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 20 of 26    PageID 20\n \nprotect their constitutional rights is through release.  Defendants are aware of the risk to the safety \nof the Named Plaintiffs and the Class members, but they have not taken steps to release them.  \nDefendants are therefore deliberately indifferent to the safety of the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \nmembers. \n61.  Accordingly, Defendants have violated the rights of the Named Plaintiffs and the \nClass members under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Violation of Title II of the ADA \n42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq./ 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Subclass Against All Defendants \n \n62.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n63.  Title II of the ADA requires that public entities refrain from discriminating against \nqualified individuals on the basis of disability.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The regulations implementing \nTitle II of the ADA require that public entities avoid policies, practices, criteria, or methods of \nadministration that have the effect of excluding or discriminating against persons with disabilities \nin the entity’s programs, services, or activities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), (b)((3), (8).  Further, a \npublic entity must “make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public \nentity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the \nservice, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n64.  Members of the Subclass are individuals with disabilities for purposes of the ADA. \n42 U.S.C. § 12102.  They are “qualified” for the programs, services, and activities being challenged \nherein.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 21 of 26    PageID 21\n \n65.  Defendants are violating Title II of the ADA by failing to make the reasonable \nmodifications necessary to ensure equal access to adjudication, jail services, and release for people \nwith disabilities who face high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19.  Defendants are \nfurther violating the ADA by employing methods of administration (including a policy of non-\nrelease even in the face of the dangers of COVID-19) that tend to discriminate against people with \ndisabilities. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Violation  \nof Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n29 U.S.C. § 794/28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Subclass Against All Defendants \n \n66.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n67.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that “no qualified individual with \ndisability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of [] disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  The regulations implementing \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require that entities receiving federal financial assistance \navoid unnecessary policies, practices, criteria, or methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscriminating against persons with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i). \n68.  Defendants receive “Federal financial assistance” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 794(a). \n69.  Favian Busby is an individual with disabilities for the purposes of the Rehabilitation \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 12012, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B).  He is “qualified” for the programs, services, and \nactivities being challenged herein. \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 22 of 26    PageID 22\n \n70.  Defendants are violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to make \nthe reasonable modifications necessary to ensure equal access to adjudication, jail services, and \nrelease for people with disabilities who are at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-\n19.    Defendants  are  further  violating  the  Rehabilitation  Act  by  employing  methods  of \nadministration (including a policy of non-release even in the face of the dangers of COVID-19) \nthat tend to discriminate against people with disabilities. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n71.

Procedural History   \nAs the history of this case has been detailed in numerous filings, the Court briefly \nsummarizes the relevant procedural history.  On June 10, 2020, the Court certified a Class and \nSubclass of medically vulnerable and disabled individuals detained pre-trial at the Jail who were \nat increased risk of serious injury or death from COVID-19, based on the guidance from the \nCenters for Disease Control.  (ECF No. 38.)  The Parties subsequently agreed to a resolution of \nthe claims and moved for preliminary approval of class action settlement pursuant to Federal \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 209   Filed 04/12/21   Page 2 of 3    PageID 3486\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(e).  (ECF No. 161.)  On January 28, 2021, the Court found that Rule \n23(e) was satisfied and granted preliminary approval.  (ECF No. 162.)  The Court also granted \npermission to post class notice as modified and scheduled a Final Approval hearing for March 5, \n2021.  (ECF No. 162.)   \nDuring the March 5 hearing, the Court notified the Parties that the Independent Inspector, \nappointed by the Court to render an expert opinion on the current health and safety of medically-\nvulnerable Plaintiffs-detainees at the Jail, (ECF No. 56), had raised concerns regarding the \nsufficiency of the Notice of the settlement to class and subclass members in the Jail’s housing \nunits.   (ECF No. 176.)  Given the concerns raised, the Court directed the Parties to devise a new \nplan for distribution of Notice, to include a one-page document to be distributed to all detainees, \nand reset the Final Approval hearing for April 9, 2021.  (ECF No. 177.)  The Parties submitted a \nrevised Plan for Distributing Notice and proposed One-Page Notice of Class Action Settlement \n(“One-Page Notice”), which the Court approved on March 15, 2021.  (ECF No. 181.)   \nII.  Final Approval Hearing \nOn April 9, 2021, the Court held the Final Approval hearing.  As discussed at the hearing, \nthe Court received approximately 70 letters from detainees following distribution of the One-\nPage Notice.  The number of letters received following the revised Notice confirms for the Court \nthat Class members have been adequately apprised of the Settlement Agreement and been \nafforded an opportunity to object.  In total, the Court has received over 80 letters from detainees, \nwhich the Court reviewed for objections to the Settlement.  Though approximately 28 letters \nnominally state “objections,” the Court finds that the so-called objections primarily express \nconcern about the Jail’s compliance with the terms of the Settlement, rather than objections to  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 209   Filed 04/12/21   Page 3 of 3    PageID 3487\nthe Settlement terms themselves.  Thus, the Court does not find any objection causing it to \nconclude that the proposed Settlement is unfair, unreasonable, or inadequate.   \nThus, Final Approval is GRANTED.  Upon entry of judgment, the Court will retain \njurisdiction over this matter for enforcement purposes. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 12th day of April, 2021. \n  s/ Sheryl H. Lipman   \n  SHERYL H.

The Shelby County Jail is no exception.  On \nMay 15, 2020, it was reported that 151 pretrial detainees and 66 staff at the Jail had tested \npositive for COVID-19, and a member of the Jail staff has died from the disease.  But the \nSheriff of Shelby County and the Sheriff’s Office, disregarding the established law of this \nCircuit and the actions of federal judges across the country, argue that this Court is \npowerless to help.  They are wrong.  This Court, like others in this Circuit and across the \ncountry, should refuse to stand idly by in the face of the grave danger to the vulnerable \npopulation at the Jail. \nEstablished law in this Circuit and from across the country, including from the U.S. \nSupreme Court, makes clear that this Court has jurisdiction to grant Mr. Busby, Mr. \nEdgington, and the classes they seek to represent, the relief they require.  Their claims are \nproperly brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, which is the only vehicle available for them to \npursue the necessary relief of release or transfer from the Shelby County Jail.  The Prison \nLitigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) therefore does not apply. There is no impediment to this \nCourt  entertaining  Plaintiffs’  claims  now  regardless  of  the  exaggerated  federalism \narguments Defendants have conjured in a last ditch attempt to avoid their obligations to the \nmedically vulnerable people in their custody.  Defendants cite no authority to the contrary.  \nConversely, the Sixth Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States have blessed \nrulings granting the same relief Messrs. Busby and Edgington seek.  Further, and in answer \nto the Court’s questions during oral argument, the vindication of Plaintiffs’ substantive due \nprocess and federal rights require this Court’s review.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 8 of 27    PageID 517\nFor these reasons, and for the reasons provided below, the Court should deny \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court “construe[s] the complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, accept[s] its allegations as true, and draw[s] all reasonable \ninferences in favor of the plaintiff.”  Handy-Clay v. City of Memphis, Tenn., 695 F.3d 531, \n538 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  A motion to dismiss must be denied if plaintiffs \nallege “facts that ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face’ and that, if accepted as \ntrue, are sufficient to ‘raise a right to relief above the speculative level.’”  Id. (citing Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 570 (2007)). \nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction to Hear Plaintiffs’ Claims. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Properly Brought Under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. \nThe core of Mr. Busby and Mr. Edgington’s claims is that they cannot be safely \nheld at the Jail because social distancing is impossible due to the congregate nature of the \nfacility; therefore, their “release is the only reasonable response.”1  TRO Br. at 15.  This is \nnot a conditions-of-confinement case because there are no conditions of confinement in \nwhich Plaintiffs can be sufficiently safe.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ challenge goes to the validity \nof the fact their confinement.  When “a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or \nduration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is \n                                                 \n1   The term “release” refers to the discharge of detained individuals from the physical \nconfines  of  the  Shelby  County  Jail,  not  necessarily  release  from  all  forms  of \ncustody.  Release options may include, but are not limited to: supervised release \n(including through the use of GPS or other forms of location monitoring), halfway \nhouse residential placement, transfer to a hospital or other facility, or diversion to \nalternative community and treatment programs.  See TRO Br. at 11 n.1. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 9 of 27    PageID 518\nentitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole federal \nremedy is a writ of habeas corpus.”  Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973); \nWershe v. Combs, 763 F.3d 500, 504 (6th Cir. 2014) (same).  As the Sixth Circuit has now \nheld on two separate occasions, “[w]here a petitioner claims no set of conditions would be \nconstitutionally sufficient, we construe the petitioner’s claim as challenging the fact of the \nconfinement.”  Wilson v. Williams, No. 20-1469, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14291, at *4 (6th \nCir. May 4, 2020); Cameron v. Bouchard, No. 20-10949, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 16741, \nat *4 (6th Cir. May 26, 2020) (citing Adams v. Bradshaw, 644 F.3d 481, 483 (6th Cir. \n2011)).   \nBecause Mr. Busby and Mr. Edgington challenge the validity of the fact of their \nconfinement, not the conditions of their confinement, § 2241 is the proper vehicle for their \nclaim.  In Cameron, the district court concluded “that § 2241 is the proper vehicle for \nPlaintiffs to challenge the continued confinement of medically-vulnerable Jail inmates \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Cameron v. Bouchard, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, \nat *34 (E.D. Mich. May 21, 2020).  Likewise, in Wilson the district court found that, \nbecause “the only true effective remedy to stop the spread [of COVID-19] is to separate \nindividuals—a  measure  that  in  our  nation’s  densely  populated  prisons  is  typically \nimpossible  .  .  .  such  actions  ultimately  seek  to  challenge  the  fact  or  duration  of \nconfinement.”  Wilson v. Williams, No. 4:20-cv-00794-JSG, 2020 WL 1940882, at *5 \n(N.D. Ohio, Apr. 22, 2020).  And, the “sole federal remedy” for a challenge to “to the very \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 10 of 27    PageID 519\nfact” of confinement is “a writ of habeas corpus.”  Preiser, 411 U.S. at 500.  Federal courts \naround the country have granted habeas relief on the same basis.2 \nThe Sixth Circuits’ holdings in Wilson and Cameron establish beyond cavil that \nhabeas relief is available to pretrial detainees in precisely these circumstances and renders \nnonsensical  Defendants’  unsupported  and  erroneous  contention  that  the  Circuit  has \n“approved  consideration  of  a  pretrial  §  2241  petition  only  in  three  exceptional \ncircumstances.”  MTD Br. at 8–9 (citing Atkins v. Michigan, 644 F.2d 543, 546–47 (6th \nCir. 1981); Delk v. Atkinson, 665 F.2d 90, 93 (6th Cir. 1981), and Turner v. Tennessee, 858 \nF.2d 1201, 1204 (6th Cir. 1988)).3  In fact, § 2241 extends to any “individual in custody in \nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.”  18 U.S.C. § 2241.  \nBecause  Mr.  Busby  and  Mr.  Edgington  challenge  the  fact  of  their  confinement, \nDefendants’ citations to cases regarding the applicability of § 2241 to conditions-of-\nconfinement claims are irrelevant.  See MTD Br. at 9.4  Mr. Busby and Mr. Edgington, and \n                                                 \n2   See, e.g. Malam v. Adducci, No. 20-10829-JEL, 2020 WL 1672662, at *3 (E.D. Mich. \nApr. 5, 2020); Refunjol v. Adducci, No. 2:20-cv-2099-SDM, 2020 WL 2487119, at *17 \n(S.D. Ohio May 14, 2020); Rafael L.O. v. Tsoukaris, No. 20-cv-3481-JMV, 2020 WL \n1808843 (D.N.J. Apr. 9, 2020); Francisco Hernandez v. Wolf, No. 20-cv-617-THJ, 202 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 71421 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2020); Thakker v. Doll, No. 20-cv-480-JEJ, \n2020 WL 1671563 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2020); Avendano Hernandez v. Decker, No. 20-\ncv-1589-JPO, 2020 WL 1547459 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020); Coronel v. Decker, No. \n20-cv-2472-AJN, 2020 WL 1487274 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020); Basank v. Decker, No. \n20-cv-2518-AT, 2020 WL 1481503 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020); Jovel v. Decker, No. \n12-cv-308-GBD, 2020 WL 1467397 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020). \n3   These cases in fact explain that habeas relief is generally applicable to any person held \nin custody.  Atkins, 644 F.2d 546, n.1 (finding “[p]retrial petitions . . . are properly \nbrought under s. 2241, which applies to persons in custody regardless of whether final \njudgment has been rendered and regardless of the present status of the case pending \nagainst him.”); Delk, 665 F.2d at 93 (holding a person “who has been released on bail \nwhile awaiting trial is in ‘custody’ for the purposes of s. 2241”); Turner, 858 F.2d at \n1204 (same).   \n4   Defendants’ argument that “a writ of habeas corpus is not the proper vehicle to bring a \ndeliberate  indifference  claim,”  MTD  Br.  at  10,  misunderstands  that  “deliberate \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 11 of 27    PageID 520\nother people at high risk of severe infection and/or death from COVID-19 cannot be safely \nhoused at the Jail under any circumstances.  As Plaintiffs’ medical experts have concluded, \nthere is no acceptable alternative but release.  See Goldenson Decl. ¶ 39; Fefferman Decl. \n¶ 8; Griffin Decl. ¶ 13.5  Because there is no acceptable alternative but release, Plaintiffs \nchallenge the validity of the fact of their confinement and their claims are properly brought \nunder § 2241. \nB.  The PLRA Does Not Apply to Plaintiffs’ Claims for Habeas Corpus. \nThe PLRA does not apply to habeas claims.  Defendants’ contention that Plaintiffs \nare subject to 18 U.S.C. § 3626 is wrong.  Mr. Busby and Mr. Edgington’s proper \ninvocation of § 2241 “forecloses any argument that the PLRA applies given its express \nexclusion of ‘habeas corpus proceedings challenging the fact or duration of confinement \nin prison’ from its ambit.’”  Wilson, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14291, at *4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3626(g)(2)); Cameron, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 16741, at *4 (same); see also Martinez-\nBrooks v. Easter, No. 3:20-cv-00569, 2020 WL 2405350, at *16 (D. Conn.

See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828 (1994) \n(“A prison official’s ‘deliberate indifference’ to a substantial risk of serious harm to an \ninmate violates the Eighth Amendment”); see also Wilson, 2020 WL 1940882, at *8 \n(finding  respondents  “deliberately  indifferent”  because  they  “altogether  failed  to \nseparate [their] inmates at least six feet apart”); Cameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n89083, at *66 (finding failure to release petitioners promptly is deliberate indifference). \n5   “Goldenson Decl.” refers to the Declaration of Dr. Joe Goldenson dated May 20, 2020,  \n“Fefferman Decl.” to the Declaration of Dr. Nina H. Fefferman dated May 19, 2020, \nand  “Griffin Decl.” to the Declaration of Dr. Marie Griffin dated May 20, 2020. \n6   Even if this was an action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Defendants’ analysis is \nwrong.  That is because 18 U.S.C. § 3626 does not apply “to an order to transfer \ndetainees out of a prison to correct the violation of a constitutional right where \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 12 of 27    PageID 521\nThe  three  out-of-Circuit  cases  on  which  Defendants  rely  do  not  affect  the \nconclusion  that  the  PLRA  is  inapplicable  here.7    They  certainly  do  not  suggest,  as \nDefendants imply, that § 3626 applies to habeas claims brought under § 2241.  See MTD \nBr. at 12.  Defendants’ error is clear from the language of the PLRA.  To interpret § 3626 \nimproperly to encompass habeas claims “would mean that a court could never order an \ninmate released unless a three-judge panel found by clear and convincing evidence that \novercrowding was the cause of the violation.  In other words, if any other reason caused \nthe violation of an inmate’s constitutional rights, judges could not provide relief by \nreleasing the inmate.”  Cameron, 2020 U.S. Dist LEXIS 89083, at *72–73.  That is not \nwhat Congress intended.  See id. \nC.  This Court May Entertain Plaintiffs’ Claims for Habeas Corpus. \nThe Court may entertain Plaintiffs’ claims for habeas corpus because there is no \navailable and adequate state corrective process to protect Plaintiffs’ rights.  See Fazzini v. \nN.E. Ohio Corr. Ctr., 473 F.3d 229, 236 (6th Cir. 2006) (finding failure to exhaust \n“available state” remedies “may be excused where pursuing such remedies would be futile \n                                                 \novercrowding is not the primary cause of the violation.”  Cameron, 2020 U.S. LEXIS \n89083, at *73; see also Reaves v. Dep’t of Corr., 404 F. Supp. 3d 520, 522–24 (D. \nMass. 2019).  The PLRA also does not work to bar home confinement, which is not \n“release” but a form of pre-release custody.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(g)(2)(A). \n7   Santana, on which Defendants rely, supports Plaintiffs’ position.  The Third Circuit \nheld that the PLRA “explicitly excludes habeas corpus proceedings from its scope” and \nlimits remedies in “conditions cases.”  Santana v. United States, 98 F.3d 752, 754–55 \n(3d Cir. 1996).  In Blair-Bey, the D.C. Circuit held that the “PLRA’s legislative history \nmakes clear that Congress’s principal intent was to reduce frivolous litigation by \nprisoners challenging conditions of their confinement. . . .  Nowhere in the PLRA’s \nlegislative history is there any reference to cases challenging the fact or duration of \nconfinement.”  Blair-Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d 1036, 1040 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Coleman \nwas not a habeas case at all.  It concerned a motion seeking modification of population \nreduction orders entered by three-judge district courts over a decade ago.  Coleman v. \nNewsom, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62575, at *6–11 (E.D. Cal.

Civiletti, 688 F.2d 27, 28–\n29 (6th Cir. 1982) (holding exhaustion is unnecessary if the remedy is “inadequate or \ncannot provide the relief requested”); O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 847–48 (1999) \n(holding exhaustion is not required when  a remedy in state court is “unavailable”).  \n“Exhaustion is based on the assumption that the state remedies available to a prisoner are \nadequate and effective to vindicate federal constitutional rights.  When state remedies \nbecome ineffective or inadequate, the rationale behind exhaustion is undercut.”  Scott v. \nParker, No. 3:09-0252-TC, 2012 WL 1292432, at *1 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 16, 2012).  Even if \nTennessee state remedies were available and adequate, the exhaustion requirement should \nbe waived in light of the unique threat posed by COVID-19.  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. \n509,  515–16  (1982)  (holding  the  exhaustion  requirement  may  be  waived  “where \nexceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist”). \nFirst, whereas the federal habeas statutes permit this Court to review whether \nPlaintiffs are “in custody in violation of the Constitution,” 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241, Tennessee \nlaw  precludes  pretrial  detainees  from  pursuing  habeas  claims  and  therefore  accords \nPlaintiffs no such relief.  “[H]abeas corpus under Tennessee law has always been, and \nremains a very narrow procedure.”  Edwards v. State, 269 S.W.3d 915, 919 (Tenn. 2008) \n(quoting Archer v. State, 851 S.W.2d 157, 162 (Tenn. 1993)).  Under Tennessee law, \nhabeas corpus relief is only available in two circumstances: where “it appears upon the face \nof the judgment or the record of the proceedings upon which the judgment is rendered that \na convicting court was without jurisdiction, or that a defendant’s sentence of imprisonment \nor other restraint has expired.”  Archer, 851 S.W.2d at 164; see also Clark v. Lindamood, \nNo. 3:17-cv-0968(AAT), 2018 WL 346230, at *3 (M.D. Tenn.

App.  Nov. 15, 2004) (finding that a petitioner \ncannot attack the validity of a sentence with a habeas petition if they have not begun serving \nthat sentence).  Indeed, pretrial detainees would not even have the opportunity to be heard \nin state court because the “court may dismiss a habeas corpus petition without a hearing if \nthe petition fails to establish that the challenged judgment is void.”  Hogan v. Mills, 168 \nS.W.3d 753, 755 (Tenn. 2005) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 29–21–109).  Plaintiffs here are \nconsequently in the same constrained position as the plaintiffs in Cameron, who also lacked \nstate habeas remedies, and not in the position of the plaintiffs in Money, who had recourse \nto state based habeas remedies.8  Defendants cite no authority to the contrary.9   \n                                                 \n8   In Cameron, plaintiffs could only bring state habeas claims to challenge “radical \ndefects rendering a judgment or proceeding absolutely void.”  Triplett v.

Apr. 10, 2020), on which Defendants rely (see MTD Br. \nat 5–6), the Illinois-based petitioners had an available state habeas remedy to pursue.  \nSee 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-124 (providing for habeas relief if, “though the \noriginal imprisonment was lawful, nevertheless, by some act, omission or event which \nhas subsequently taken place, the party has become entitled to be discharged”). \n9   The non-Tennessee case law on which Defendants rely is irrelevant and the three \nTennessee cases they cite are inapposite.  Patton v. Bonner, No. 2:19-cv-02344-TLP, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74470 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 28, 2020), involved a pending state \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 15 of 27    PageID 524\nSecond, because Defendants effectively concede that there is no state habeas \nremedy available to Plaintiffs, Defendants hazard that Plaintiffs could move the state trial \ncourt to alter their bond or other conditions of their release, see MTD Br. at 6, but such \nmechanisms  are  wholly  ineffective  and  inadequate  to  protect  the  constitutional  and \nstatutory rights at risk in this case.10  Tennessee’s procedures for setting bail and modifying \nconditions of release are inadequate and ineffective because they do not consider the \nvalidity of the fact of Plaintiffs’ continued confinement in light of their high risk of severe \ninfection and/or death from COVID-19.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-11-115, -118.  The \nprocedures for setting bail and modifying conditions of release do not consider whether the \nfact of Plaintiffs’ continued confinement amounts to unconstitutional punishment; they do \nnot consider whether their continued confinement constitutes an unacceptable risk to \nPlaintiffs’ health and safety; and, they do not consider whether Plaintiffs’ continued \nconfinement constitutes impermissible disability discrimination.  Indeed, the procedures \nfor setting bail and modifying conditions of release do not require any review of whether \nPlaintiffs are “in custody in violation of the Constitution,” as 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 requires.11 \n                                                 \ncriminal prosecution and turned on Younger abstention.  Id. at *4.  The state trial court \nconfirmed that habeas relief in Tennessee is limited to two narrow grounds.  See Patton, \n2019 WL 1111151, at *1.  Neither Burke v. Hall, No. 3:19-cv-1108(AAT), 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 17774 (M.D. Tenn. Feb. 4, 2020), nor Greenwood v. Batts, No. 2:16-cv-\n02867, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115875 (W.D. Tenn. July 12, 2018) concern pre-trial \ndetainees; they are about habeas petitions filed by federal inmates after sentencing.  \n10   Plaintiffs’ proposed relief contemplates weighing the violation to their constitutional \nand federal rights against any established risk of flight or danger to others.  That is one \napproach to vindicating their rights, but consideration of their risk of flight or danger \nto others it is not an avenue to address the constitutional and disability claims raised in \ntheir Petition. \n11   Further, the size of the proposed class numbers in the hundreds, and Defendants have \nnot  even  suggested  that  Tennessee’s  trial  courts  would  be  prepared  to  hear  and \nadjudicate hundreds of individual bail reduction motions taking into account class \nmembers’  medical  vulnerabilities  in  the  urgent  manner  necessary  under  the \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 16 of 27    PageID 525\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court’s Orders of March 13, March 25, and April 24 do \nnot change this analysis, nor does the 30th Judicial District’s response to the Supreme \nCourt’s March 25 Order, as neither modify the procedures for setting bail or modifying \nconditions of release to incorporate the necessary constitutional and federal law analysis \nrequired to address the violation to Plaintiffs’ rights.  See Exs. A, B, C, and D.12  The \nOrders of March 13 and March 25 merely state that bond-related matters can continue to \nbe heard.  See Exs. A and B at 1 (stating that exceptions to the “suspension of in-person \ncourt proceedings include . . . bond-related matters”).  The March 25 Order directed “each \njudicial district” to “develop a written plan to affirmatively address issues regarding the \nincarceration of nonviolent offenders in furtherance of efforts to reduce the jail population, \nincluding but not limited to bond reductions or eliminations, deferred sentences, and \nsuspended sentences. . . . by . . . March 30, 2020,” but provided no further guidance on \nwhat that was to contain, what action was required to address the issues, or what legal \nprinciples that were to inform the efforts to reduce the jail population.  Id.   \nThat the Tennessee Supreme Court’s Orders wrought no meaningful change in the \nmanner in which judges set bail and modify conditions of release is apparent from Judge \nJohn W. Campbell’s cursory letter of March 27, 2020 in response to the Supreme Court’s \nMarch 25 Order.13  That letter makes clear that there is no available and adequate state \n                                                 \ncircumstances.  See McPherson v. Lamont, No. 3:20-cv-534 (JBA), 2020 WL 2198279, \nat *7 (D. Conn. May 6, 2020) (noting that state courts would be unlikely to respond to \nthe volume of emergency petitions required for class members to exhaust state law \nclaims for relief and waiving § 2241 exhaustion requirement). \n12   “Ex. __” refers to the exhibits to the Declaration of Jonathan Silberstein-Loeb dated \nMay 29, 2020. \n13   The 30th Judicial District has not published a plan or any additional materials to the \nTennessee State Courts website.  See https://www.tncourts.gov/Coronavirus. \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 17 of 27    PageID 526\ncorrective  process  in  the  30th  Judicial  District  to  protect  Plaintiffs’  substantive \nconstitutional habeas rights.  See Ex. D.  Indeed, the letter does not set forth any steps that \nthe judiciary is taking to address the constitutional and federal violations of which Plaintiffs \ncomplain.  Rather, it merely outlines steps taken by the District Attorney to “prevent jail \novercrowding during the current health crisis.”  Ex. D.  Overcrowding is not the issue here.  \nThe issue is that Plaintiffs, and other people housed at the Jail who are at high risk of severe \ninfection and/or death from COVID-19, cannot be safe in a congregate facility, particularly \nbecause they cannot practice social distancing.14   \nThird, the exhaustion requirement should be waived in light of the unique threat \nposed by COVID-19.  Even if the Court somehow finds that Plaintiffs could have attempted \nthe futile act of exhausting state-level remedies, Defendants are wrong to contend that this \nrequires dismissal of Plaintiffs’ federal habeas claim.  The requirement “was judicially \ncreated, it is not a statutory requirement and, therefore, not jurisdictional.”  Hernandez v. \nSepanek, No. 12-CV-51-HRW, 2013 WL 556378, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 11, 2013).  Rather, \na court should waive the exhaustion requirement “where exceptional circumstances of \npeculiar urgency are shown to exist.”  Rose, 455 U.S. 515–16. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic is the “quintessential example of when unusual and \nexceptional circumstances exist” and in which “peculiar urgency” is required.  Cameron, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, at *36-37; see also Cameron, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 16741, \n                                                 \n14   In Cameron, the court explicitly noted that Michigan had, by executive order, granted \njudicial officers the authority to suspend or reduce jail sentences in light of the \npandemic, and that the governor had issued an executive order requesting that jails and \nprisons consider actions to lower detainee populations.  See Cameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 89083, at *36.  Nonetheless, the court held that relief obtained via these \nprocesses were “not part of the ‘standard review process,’” and therefore did not need \nto be exhausted.  Id. at *36-37 \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 18 of 27    PageID 527\nat *4 (finding a plaintiff need not exhaust state-court remedies in “unusual circumstances”).  \nYet, Defendants insist that, “[t]o fulfill the exhaustion requirement, a petitioner must have \nfairly presented his federal claims to all levels of the state appellate system, including the \nstate’s highest court.”  MTD Br. at 4.  That is not what the law demands, and it would be \nfutile to require it here.  As the District of Connecticut recently concluded, “§ 2241’s \nexhaustion requirement should be waived in light of the extraordinary circumstances \npresented by the COVID-19 pandemic.”  McPherson, 2020 WL 2198279, at *7.   \nFurther delay in providing relief could mean the difference between life and death \nfor Mr. Busby and Mr. Edgington and for the members of the Class and Subclass.  The \noutbreak of COVID-19 at the Jail, the death of a staff member at the Jail, and the threat \nthat this poses to the well-being of the Shelby County community generally, as documented \nin the declarations of Plaintiffs’ medical experts, establish beyond dispute that the threat of \nsubstantial harm is imminent.  See, e.g. Goldenson Decl. ¶ 28 (“medically vulnerable \npersons at Shelby County Jail are at grave risk of death or serious illness”); Fefferman \nDecl. ¶ 11 (“Cases of infection occurring within a jail cause additional cases of infection, \nhospitalization and deaths in the wider community.”).  Pretrial detention must not be \npermitted to become a death sentence. \nII.  To Vindicate Plaintiffs’ Rights This Court Must Intervene. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Entail Substantive Due Process Violations that Require This \nCourt’s Review. \nPlaintiffs’ continued detention, and that of the members of the Class and Subclass, \nviolates their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and their rights under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act, because there is no safe alternative to their confinement short of \nrelease.  Because the constitutional violation arises from Plaintiffs’ confinement, and not \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 19 of 27    PageID 528\nfrom the procedure that led to their confinement, the Court’s analysis should focus on the \nviolation to Plaintiffs’ substantive due process and federal rights.  See Howard v. Grinage, \n82 F.3d 1343, 1349 (6th Cir. 1996) (distinguishing procedural due process as the right “to \nbe heard in a meaningful manner,” whereas substantive due process relates to preventing \n“governmental power from being ‘used for purposes of oppression’” (citations omitted)).   \nTo conduct this analysis, the Court should first address the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional and federal law claims.  Plaintiffs bring two distinct substantive due process \nFourteenth Amendment claims, either of which may form the basis for the relief they seek.  \nUnder the first claim, the Court must look at whether, because Plaintiffs and members of \nthe Class and Subclass are exclusively pretrial detainees, and because they are at high risk \nof  severe  infection  and/or  death  from  COVID-19,  their  continued  detention  is  not \nreasonably related to a legitimate, non-punitive government purpose  or excessive in \nrelation to that purpose.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 561 (1979); J.H. v. Williamson \nCty., 951 F.3d 709, 717 (6th Cir. 2020) (applying Bell test to pretrial detainee’s claim).15    \nAnd, because Plaintiffs are pretrial detainees, they need not show Defendants subjectively \nperceived facts from which to infer a substantial risk to Plaintiffs.  See Kingsley v. \nHendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 392 (2015).  Rather, it is enough that Plaintiffs are “exposed \nto a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Cameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, at *53 \n(quoting Amick v. Ohio Dep’t of Rehab. & Corr., 521 F. App’x 354, 361 (6th Cir. 2013)).   \nPlaintiffs’ second substantive due process claim is the Fourteenth Amendment \nequivalent of the Eight Amendment’s prohibition against detention conditions that amount \n                                                 \n15   The only two legitimate interests are preventing flight or danger to the community.  See \nStack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 8 (1951); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 744–45 \n(1987). \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 20 of 27    PageID 529\nan unacceptable risk to health and safety.  See Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993) \nUnder that claim, Plaintiffs are exposed to a substantial risk of serious harm because of the \ncongregate nature of the Jail, which houses inmates who share sinks, toilets, and showers, \nas well as eating, sleeping, and living spaces, all of which makes it an ideal environment \nfor the spread of COVID-19.  See id. at *54.  The structure of the facility heightens the risk \nof transmission.  “This, along with the fact that there is an active outbreak of COVID-19 \nat the Jail and the fact that COVID-19 is a highly infectious virus that poses a significant \nrisk of severe illness and death, particularly for the medically vulnerable, renders the \nobjective component easily satisfied.”  Id. (citing Wilson, 2020 WL 1940882, at *8); see \nalso Prieto Refunjol v. Adducci, No. 2:20-CV-2099-SDM, 2020 WL 2487119, at *26 (S.D. \nOhio May 14, 2020) (finding that “where there is a highly infectious disease circulating \nthroughout the jail, the community, the nation, and the world, these poor-quality conditions \nserve no legitimate purpose and have the effect of punishing the detainees, because it \naffords the detainees’ little ability to  protect their own health.”);  Malam, 2020 WL \n1672662, at *12 (explaining that since “petitioner faces significant risk of death due to \nCOVID-19,” “her continued confinement . . . is both unrelated and contrary to the \ngovernment purpose of carrying out her removal proceedings.”). \nIf,  however,  under  the  second  due  process  claim,  the  Court  determines  that \nPlaintiffs, notwithstanding that they are pretrial detainees, must also show that Defendants \nare  subjectively  indifferent  to  Plaintiffs’  safety,  that  requirement  is  still  easily \nsatisfied.  There is no denying that Defendants subjectively perceived facts from which to \ninfer substantial risk to Plaintiffs and there is no denying that Defendants drew that \ninference.  Defendants concede as much and in any event the risk is obvious.  Defendants \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 21 of 27    PageID 530\nhave disregarded this risk to Plaintiffs safety, and that of the members of the Class and \nSubclass, because, knowing of this substantial risk, Defendants have failed to provide an \nalternative to their continued confinement.  For Plaintiffs and other detainees who are at \nhigh risk of severe infection and/or death from COVID-19, release is the only reasonable \nresponse.   \nThe constitutional violation arises out of the fact of Plaintiffs’ confinement, not the \nprocedure that led to their confinement.  As the Cameron court said: “Considering the \nweight of the public health evidence demonstrating the medically-vulnerable population’s \nunique,  specific,  and  life-threatening  susceptibility  to  COVID-19—paired  with  the \ncommunal nature of jail facilities,” “release” is the only “reasonable response.”  Cameron, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, at *63; see also Martinez-Brooks, 2020 WL 2405350, at \n*23.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Sheriff must be permitted to exercise discretion in \nchoosing among equally effective measures to protect inmates from serious risks, but \nchoosing  inevitably  inadequate  measures  to  the  exclusion  of  a  plainly  superior  one \nconstitutes deliberate indifference.  See Martinez-Brooks, 2020 WL 2405350, at *23.  In \nlight of Defendants’ awareness of the deathly risk that COVID-19 poses to the medically-\nvulnerable  population,  Defendants’  failure  to  make  prompter,  broader,  and  more \nmeaningful use of their authority to release medically vulnerable detainees, although it is \nthe only solution capable of adequately protecting them, constitutes deliberate indifference.  \nCameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, at *66. \nSeparately,  and  independent  of  the  analysis  of  Defendants’  constitutional \nviolations, the Court may grant injunctive relief to the Subclass based on Defendant’s \ndiscrimination against disabled detainees.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs “must show \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 22 of 27    PageID 531\nprison officials took the challenged actions because of the inmate’s alleged disability”; that \nis, “because of their disabilities.”  TRO Opp’n Br. at 14.  But “there is nothing to indicate \nthat a plaintiff must ever prove intentional discrimination—or deliberate indifference—\nunder Title II and § 504.”   I.L. through Taylor v. Knox Cty. Bd. of Ed., 257 F. Supp. 3d \n946, 969 (E.D. Tenn. 2017).  Defendants effectively concede that they are treating people \nwith disabilities as they treat everyone else.  Failure to provide reasonable accommodations \nto ensure equal access to people with disabilities is discrimination.  Ability Center of \nGreater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 907 (6th Cir. 2004). \nMr. Busby and the members of the Subclass are individuals protected by the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act impose affirmative \nobligations to make benefits, services, and programs available to people with disabilities, \nincluding by making accommodations to ensure that these programs are equally available \nto disabled people.  The Subclass members are all at high risk of severe injury and/or death \nfrom COVID-19 by virtue of their disabilities.  Absent reasonable “accommodation”—\nnamely, the identification and release of all individuals who are at high risk of severe \ninfection and/or death from COVID-19—they are and will continue to be denied equal \naccess to the benefit of the Jail’s programs and services, including adjudication of their \ncases, safe preparation for these cases, and adequate medical and mental health care while \nin Jail.  Because Defendants have failed to provide these reasonable accommodations, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims. \nB.  Habeas Relief Can be Granted in a Way that Protects the Public. \nGiven the severe and unavoidable risks to Mr. Busby and Mr. Edgington, the Court \ncan and should act quickly to implement a system for ordering their release and/or \n“enlargement”  of  custody  and  that  of  the  members  of  the  Class  and  Subclass.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 23 of 27    PageID 532\n“Enlargement,” a term used only in the context of habeas, is not release.  The person \nremains in custody even as the place of custody is changed and thereby “enlarged” from a \nparticular  prison  to  a  hospital,  halfway  house,  a  person’s  home,  or  other  setting.  \nEnlargement is a provisional remedy that modifies custody by expanding the site in which \nit takes place.  Federal judges have authority to release detainees in this manner while their \nhabeas petitions are pending.  See Lee v. Jabe, 989 F.2d 869, 871 (6th Cir. 1993) (citing \nDotson v. Clark, 900 F.2d 77, 79 (6th Cir. 1990)); see also Cameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 89083, at *34.   \nIn deciding whether to grant this emergency relief, the Court is directed to follow \nthe well-known balancing test that governs preliminary relief, which includes weighing \n“the public interest.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 55 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Malam \nv. Adducci, No. 20-10829-JEL, 2020 WL 1672662, at *6-7 (E.D. Mich Apr. 5, 2020).  \nThus, this Court can weigh the public interest when granting temporary release to Plaintiffs \nand members of the Class and Subclass.  Once the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their constitutional and statutory claims, then it may turn to \nbalancing those violations against the public interest.  For Plaintiffs, and for members of \nthe Class and Subclass, that balancing exercise should lead to the conclusion that they \nshould be released because of the risks to their health from remaining incarcerated and the \nrisks to the public posed by the Jail becoming a source of source of transmission and a \ndrain on public health resources, but if the Court concludes, notwithstanding these risks, \nthat the risk to the public safety from granting temporary release to certain individuals \noutweighs the other factors, the Court could deny them emergency relief. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 24 of 27    PageID 533\nSeveral such systems already exist.  For example, a federal court in the District of \nMassachusetts has released, and continues to release, numerous immigration detainees on \nnon-monetary bond conditions while their class habeas petition is pending.  See Savino v. \nSouza, No. 20-10617-WGY, 2020 WL 1703844, at *8–9 (D. Mass. Apr. 8, 2020).  In \nWilson, the court ordered respondents to “identify, within one (1) day all members of the \n[medically-vulnerable] subclass” and to “evaluate each subclass member’s eligibility for \ntransfer  out  of  Elkton  [prison]  through  any  means,  including  but  not  limited  to \ncompassionate release, parole or community supervision, transfer furlough, or non-transfer \nfurlough within two (2) weeks.”  Wilson, 2020 WL 1940882, at *10.  The court also \ninstructed that, in undertaking this evaluation, “Respondents will prioritize the review by \nthe medical threat level.”  Id.  In Cameron, the court began to implement such a procedure \nby requiring the Oakland County Jail to provide the court and plaintiffs’ counsel with a list \nof medically vulnerable individuals, including inmate identification numbers, ages, any \nhealth vulnerabilities, as well as records detailing the instant charges or convictions and \nany criminal history of the individual.  Cameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, at *85.  \nAs the Cameron court explained, “the purpose of this order is to enable the Court to \nimplement a system for considering the release on bond or other alternatives to detention \nin the Jail for each subclass member.”  Id.  This Court should impose a similar procedure \nhere, and Plaintiffs have set forth such a procedure in their proposed order granting their \nMotion for a Temporary Restraining Order.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons the Court should deny Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nand grant Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. \n   \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35   Filed 05/29/20   Page 25 of 27    PageID 534\nDated:   May 29, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Brice M.

Judges and their staff shall \nensure that social distancing and other such measures are strictly observed.  For purposes \nof implementing procedural matters during this time, the provisions of Rule 18(c) of the \nRules of the Tennessee Supreme Court are suspended to allow judges to issue general \norders.\nJudges  are charged  with the responsibility of  ensuring that core  constitutional \nfunctions and rights are protected.  Additionally, court clerks are charged with ensuring\nthat court functions continue.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 18-1-101 (2009); 18-1-105 (Supp. \n2019).  Nevertheless, all judges and court clerks should minimize in-person contact by \nutilizing available technologies, including alternative means of filing, teleconferencing, \nemail, and video conferencing.  \nAny Tennessee state or local rule, criminal or civil, that impedes a judge’s or court \nclerk’s ability to utilize available technologies to limit in-person contact is suspended \nthroughThursday,April 30, 2020.  See, e.g., Tenn. R. Civ. P. 43.01.  With respect to plea \nagreements for non-incarcerated individuals, this suspension expressly applies to those \nprovisions of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 11 which otherwise would require the proceeding to be in \nperson in open court. See, e.g., Tenn. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1) and (2), 11(c)(2)(A).\nThe presiding judge or the designee of the presiding judge of each judicial district\nshall develop a written plan to affirmatively address issues regarding the incarceration of \nnonviolent offenders in furtherance of efforts to reduce the jail population, including but \nnot  limited  to  bond  reductions  or  eliminations,  deferred  sentences,  and  suspended \nsentences.

If it becomes necessary to \nclose judges’ orcourt clerks’physical offices during the period of suspension, these offices \nshall remain accessible by telephone, email and fax to the extent possible during regular \nbusiness  hours.    If  available,  drop  boxes  should  be  used  for  conventionally  filed \ndocuments.  \nThis  order  expressly  encourages  and  does  not  prohibit court  proceedings  by \ntelephone, video, teleconferencing, email, or other means that do not involve in-person \ncontact. This order does not affect courts’ consideration of matters that can be resolved \nwithout in-person proceedings. Although some non-emergency matters will need to be \nrescheduled, judges are to continue to resolve matters that do not require in-person court \nproceedings. Court clerks are to work cooperatively and at the direction of the presiding \njudge of each judicial district to fulfill the clerks’ obligation to facilitate continuing court \nfunction.   \nDeadlines set forth in court rules, statutes, ordinances, administrative rules, or \notherwise that are set to expire during the period from Friday, March 13, 2020, through\nTuesday, May 5, 2020, are hereby extended through Wednesday, May 6, 2020.  Statutes \nof limitations and statutes of repose that would otherwise expire during the period from\nFriday, March 13, 2020, through Tuesday, May 5, 2020, are hereby extended through \nWednesday, May 6, 2020.

Deadlines, statutes \nof limitations, and statutes of repose that are not set to expire during the period from \nFriday, March 13, 2020, through Tuesday, May 5, 2020, are not extended or tolled by this \norder. \nWith  regard  to  notarizing  documents  at  this  time,  attorneys  and  judges  are \nencouraged to utilize the “Online Notary Public Act,” Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-16-301, et seq., \nand the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State at Sec. of State, Tenn. R. and \nReg.  1360-07-03-.01.

See Tenn. Const. Art. VI, § 1; Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 16-3-501 to 16-3-504 \n(2009); Moore-Pennoyer v. State, 515 S.W.3d 271, 276-77 (Tenn. 2017); Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. \n49.  This state of emergency constitutes a “disaster” for purposes of Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 49 \nand Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-1-116. On March 25, 2020, the Tennessee Supreme Court\ncontinued the suspension of in-person court proceedings and the extension of deadlines.  \nSince that time, the State of Tennesseeand its citizens havemade progressin mitigating the \nrisks associated with COVID-19 and preparing for a re-opening of various aspects of daily \nlife. This includes a modification of the suspension of in-person court proceedings, with \nappropriate safeguards.\nUnder  the  constitutional,  statutory, and  inherent  authority  of  the  Tennessee \nSupreme Court, the prior suspension of in-person proceedings, except for jury trials, in all \nstate and local courts in Tennessee, including but not limited to municipal, juvenile, \ngeneral sessions, trial, and appellate courts, shall be modified as set forth in this order.  \nUnless otherwise noted herein, the provisions of this order shall remain in place through \nSunday, May 31, 2020.   \n1) The suspension of jury trials shall remain in effect through Friday, July 3, 2020. \nAny exceptions must be based on extraordinary circumstances and approved by the Chief \nJustice. \n2) Courts should continue to conduct as much business as possible by means other \nthan in-person court proceedings.  Courts are encouraged to continue and even increase\nthe use of telephone, teleconferencing, email, video conferencing or other means that do \nnot involve in-person contact.  All of these methods should be the preferred option over \nin-person court proceedings. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35-4   Filed 05/29/20   Page 3 of 6    PageID 550\n3) All courts within a judicial district shall continue to operate under the guidelines \nand restrictions set forth in this Court’s March 25, 2020 order until the Chief Justice has \napproved a written plan for the judicial district within which the court is located.    \nThe presiding judge or the designee of the presiding judge of each judicial district, \nin coordination with the designated  judge or  other designee of  the  general sessions, \njuvenile, and municipal courts within each judicial district, shall develop a comprehensive\nwritten plan to gradually begin conducting in-person court proceedings (other than jury \ntrials)  in  some  non-emergency  matters.    Each  plan  should  contain guidelines  and \nrestrictions designed to minimize to the greatest extent possible the risk of the spread of \nCOVID-19 from in-person court proceedings.  The written plans may include different \nguidelines and restrictions for different courts or counties within a judicial district.  The \nwritten plans should include guidelines and restrictions addressing matters including but \nnot limited to admission into the courthouse, limitation of the number of persons in the \ncourtroom, staggering of hearing times,management of social distancing in the courthouse \nand in the courtroom, and handling of witnesses (e.g., having witnesses remain in their \nvehicles or placing them in separate rooms).  The use of personal protection such as face\nmasks, as well as appropriate use of disinfectants, is encouraged in courthouses to protect \ncourt personnel and the public. Screening measures such as touchless thermometers and \nhealth questions relevant to COVID-19 may be used for entry into courthouses.  However, \nfactors such as availability and cost of such measures should be taken into consideration \nbefore inclusion as mandatory requirements in a written plan.  Alternatively, a written \nplan may consist of an election to continue to operate under the guidelines and restrictions \nset forth in this Court’s March 25, 2020 order.  The presiding judge or the designee of the \npresiding judge of each judicial district shall submit its written plan to the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts for approval by the Chief Justice.   \n4) Judges are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that core constitutional \nfunctions and rights are protected.  Additionally, court clerks are charged with ensuring \nthat court functions continue.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 18-1-101 (2009); 18-1-105 (Supp. \n2019).  Court clerks are to work cooperatively and at the direction of the presiding judge \nof  each  judicial  district  to  fulfill the  clerks’  obligation  to  facilitate  continuing  court \nfunction.  Nevertheless, all judges and court clerks should continue to minimize in-person \ncontact  by  utilizing  available  technologies,  including  alternative means  of  filing, \nteleconferencing, email, and video conferencing.  \n5) Any Tennessee state or local rule, criminal or civil, that impedes a judge’s or \ncourt clerk’s ability to utilize available technologies to limit in-person contactis suspended \nthrough Sunday, May 31, 2020.  See, e.g., Tenn. R. Civ. P. 43.01.  With respect to plea \nagreements for non-incarcerated individuals, this suspension expressly applies to those \nprovisions of Tenn. R. Crim. P. 11 which otherwise would require the proceeding to be in \n2\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35-4   Filed 05/29/20   Page 4 of 6    PageID 551\nperson in open court.  See, e.g., Tenn. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1) and (2), 11(c)(2)(A).  For \npurposes of implementing procedural matters during this time, the provisions of Rule 18(c) \nof the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court are suspended to allow judges to issue \ngeneral orders.\n6) Judges’ offices and court clerks’ offices may limit in-person contact with the \npublic during the period of suspension, but must remain open for business.  If it becomes \nnecessary to restrict physical access to judges’ or court clerks’ offices during the period of \nsuspension, these offices shall remain accessible by telephone, email and fax to the extent \npossible during regular business hours.   If  available, drop  boxes  should be  used  for \nconventionally filed documents. \n  \n7) Deadlines set forth in court rules, statutes, ordinances, administrative rules, or \notherwise that are set to expire during the period from Friday, March 13, 2020, through\nSunday May 31, 2020, are hereby extended through Friday, June 5, 2020.

This \nextension does not apply to deadlines set forth in pre-trial scheduling orders, but such \ndeadlines remain subject to extension by the trial courts in their discretion.  Statutes of \nlimitations and statutes of repose that would otherwise expire during the period from\nFriday, March 13, 2020, through Sunday May 31, 2020, are hereby extended through \nFriday, June 5, 2020.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-1-116 (2017).  Deadlines, statutes of \nlimitations, and statutes of repose that are not set to expire during the period from Friday,\nMarch 13, 2020, through Sunday, May 31, 2020, are not extended or tolled by this order. \n8) Attorneys and judges are encouraged to utilize the “Online Notary Public Act,” \nTenn. Code Ann. § 8-16-301, et seq., and the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \nState at Sec. of State, Tenn. R. and Reg. 1360-07-03-.01.  Additionally, Executive Order \nNo. 26 issued by Governor Lee on April 9, 2020, addresses notary issues.  With regard to \ncourt filings, declarations under penalty of perjury may be used as an alternative to a \nnotary. The use of electronic signatures as provided under Rule 5B of the Tennessee \nRules of Civil Procedure and Rules 46 and 46A of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme \nCourt is extended to any pleadings or documents to be filed or served by conventional \nmeans during the time that the state of emergency for the Judicial Branch remains in place.\n9) Given the increasing economic issues caused by this pandemic, no judge, clerk, \nor other court official shall take any action to effectuate an eviction, ejectment, or other \n3\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 35-4   Filed 05/29/20   Page 5 of 6    PageID 552\ndisplacement from a residence during the effective dates of this order based upon the \nfailure to make a rent, loan, or other similar payment absent extraordinary circumstances as \ndetermined by a judge in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Yet, that is not how conditional habeas writs are granted. They are \ngranted with the condition imposed on the state, with an absolute writ being issued if the state fails to meet the \ncondition. See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 775, 107 S.Ct. 2113, 95 L.Ed.2d 724 (1987) (“[C]ourts may delay the \nrelease of a successful habeas petitioner in order to provide the State an opportunity to correct the constitutional \nviolation found by the court”); Gentry v. Deuth, 456 F.3d 687, 692 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he sole distinction between a \nconditional and an absolute grant of the writ of habeas corpus is that the former lies latent unless and until the state \nfails to perform the established condition, at which time the writ springs to life”). Plaintiffs would have it the other \nway around. Against the backdrop of the traditional definition of a conditional writ, recall that this atypical habeas \npetition is legally sound as a “fact of confinement” challenge (rather than a “conditions of confinement” claim) \nsolely because it alleges that the Jail conditions are incurably dire. To grant a conditional writ here, allowing \nDefendants to cure what is supposedly incurable, would improperly be converting this habeas action into essentially \na § 1983 lawsuit. See Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 87, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring) (“Conditional writs are not an all-purpose weapon with which federal habeas courts can extort from the \nrespondent custodian forms of relief short of release, whether a new parole hearing or a new mattress in the \napplicant’s cell.”) \n \n7  Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, \n  CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.ht\nml (last reviewed July 27, 2020).) \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n10 \n ",

Plaintiffs Favian Busby, Russell Leaks, and Joseph Nelson, and the Classes \nof individuals they represent, are pretrial detainees seeking emergency relief finding that \ntheir continued detention at the Shelby County Jail (the “Jail”) violates the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s  protections  from  unconstitutional  punishment  and  unconstitutional \nconfinement and their statutory rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) \nand the Rehabilitation Act.1   \n2.  To resolve Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court evaluates the continued threat that \nCOVID-19 poses to medically vulnerable and disabled detainees, the adequacy of the \ncurrent steps taken by the Jail, and the legal standards applicable to Plaintiffs’ claims. \n3.  COVID-19 continues to create a high risk of irreparable injury to Plaintiffs \nabsent an injunction, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Fourteenth \nAmendment claims and their claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and the \npublic interest favors their release.  \n4.  The only adequate remedy at this time is to order Plaintiffs released from \ndetention on appropriate conditions.2   \n                                                 \n1   Michael Edgington does not meet the Class criteria as defined by the Court.  See \nOrder, ECF No. 38, Pg.ID 691–92.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ counsel no longer seek \nrelief on his behalf.  Russell Leaks is being held pretrial on allegations concerning a \nparole violation and he is therefore still entitled to relief. \n2   The term “release” refers to the discharge of detained individuals from the physical \nconfines of the Shelby County Jail, not necessarily release from all forms of custody. \nRelease options may include, but are not limited to: supervised release (including \nthrough the use of GPS or other forms of location monitoring), enlargement of \ncustody to a halfway house residential placement if one is deemed safe for medically \nvulnerable persons, transfer to a hospital or other facility, or diversion to alternative \ncommunity and treatment programs. Indeed, Shelby County already maintains a \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 6 of 60    PageID 2335\nPROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT \nI.  Procedural Background \n5.  On May 20, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and a class action complaint for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief seeking release from the Jail in light of their medical vulnerabilities and disabilities \nand the threat to their safety at the Jail.3   \n6.  Plaintiffs brought four independent claims for release: (i) unconstitutional \npunishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (ii) unconstitutional confinement \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (iii) discrimination on the basis of disability in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA; and (iv) discrimination on the basis of disability in \nviolation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.4 \n7.  Simultaneously, Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order \nseeking immediate release,5 a motion for class certification,6 and a motion for expedited \nconsideration.7 \n8.  In support of their motion for a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs filed \ndeclarations from Dr. Nina Fefferman, professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville \nin both the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Department of \n                                                 \nPretrial Services Department “offering alternatives to incarceration at every stage of \nthe criminal justice system.” See Pretrial Services, SHELBY CTY.

Schiller, Esq.; Josh Spickler, Esq.; Michael R. Working, \nEsq.; and, Stella Yarbrough, Esq.8 \n9.  On  May  21,  2020,  the  Court  granted  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  expedited \nconsideration and ordered Defendants to file responses to the motions for a temporary \nrestraining order and for class certification by noon on May 26, 2020 and scheduled a \nhearing on those motions on May 27, 2020.9 \n10.  On May 26, 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ petition pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.10  Defendants also filed briefs in \nopposition  to  Plaintiffs’  motions  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  for  class \ncertification.11   \n11.  In  support  of  their  opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  temporary \nrestraining order, Defendants also filed declarations from Chief Jailer Kirk Fields, Shelby \nCounty District Attorney General Amy Weirich, Shelby County Criminal Court Division \nVI  Judge  John  W.  Campbell,  Shelby  County  Criminal  Court  Division  VIII  Judge \nChristopher Craft, Shelby County Health Officer Dr. Bruce Randolph, and Shelby County \nJail Medical Director Dr. Donna Randolph.12 \n                                                 \n8   See ECF Nos. 2-1–9. \n9   See ECF No. 15, Pg.ID 274. \n10   See ECF No. 25. \n11   See ECF Nos. 26 and 27. \n12   See ECF Nos. 27-1–6. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 8 of 60    PageID 2337\n12.  On May 27, 2020, the Court held a hearing and heard oral argument from \nboth parties as well as testimony from Dr. Joe Goldenson, M.D.13 \n13.  On May 29, 2020, Plaintiffs submitted their opposition to Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss and Defendants replied on June 4.14 \n14.  On June 10, the Court entered an Order denying Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss and granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification by \ncertifying a Class and Subclass.15  The Court also ordered Defendants to file a list of Class \nand Subclass members on the docket no later than noon on June 12, 2020.16 \n15.  On June 12, Defendants moved to amend the Court’s prior Order and to \nextend the deadline for filing their list of Class and Subclass members,17 which the Court \ngranted.18 \n16.  On June 12, the Court entered a further Order addressing Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor temporary restraining order.  The Court held its ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \ntemporary restraining order in abeyance and ordered, due to the conflicting facts presented \nby the parties and pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 706, an inspection of the Jail by \nan independent inspector.19 \n                                                 \n13   See ECF No. 36. \n14   See ECF Nos. 35 and 37. \n15   See ECF No. 38. \n16   See id. at Pg.ID 691. \n17   See ECF No. 40. \n18   See ECF No. 42. \n19   See ECF No. 45, Pg.ID 734. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 9 of 60    PageID 2338\n17.  On June 18 the Court held a hearing with the parties to consider the \nappointment of the independent inspector.20  Also on June 18 the Court entered an Order \nappointing Michael K. Brady, an expert witness in the field of jail and prison operations as \nit relates to the prevention and mitigation of the spread of infectious diseases and public \nhealth in the correctional setting, to conduct an inspection of Jail.21  The Court instructed \nMr. Brady to “render an expert opinion on the current health and safety of medically-\nvulnerable  Plaintiff-detainees  at  the  Shelby  County  Jail  in  light  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic, including but not limited to the Facility’s compliance with the pertinent CDC \nand Shelby County Public Health guidelines and other applicable standards.”22 \n18.  On June 19, Plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery and expedited \nbriefing and exhibited thereto a set of interrogatories, requests for production, notices \ncalling for the depositions of Chief Fields, Dr. Bruce Randolph, Dr. Donna Randolph, and \na request to conduct an expert inspection of the Jail.23 \n19.  Defendants responded to the motion for expedited discovery on June 22, \n2020.24 \n20.  On June 23, the Court held a hearing regarding Plaintiffs’ motion for \nexpedited discovery and heard argument from both parties.25  Also on June 23, the Court \ngranted in part and limited in part Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery.  The Court \n                                                 \n20   See ECF No. 66. \n21   See ECF No. 56, Pg.ID 843. \n22   Id. \n23   See ECF Nos. 57, 57-1–6. \n24   See ECF No. 64. \n25   See ECF No. 73. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 10 of 60    PageID 2339\nordered Defendants to produce all written discovery by June 29, to make Chief Fields and \nDrs. Bruce and Donna Randolph available for depositions, and allowed Plaintiffs to \nconduct an independent inspection of the Jail, subject to certain conditions.26  \n21.  On June 30, Mr. Brady submitted his inspection report.27  On July 1, the \nCourt held a further hearing to hear evidence from Mr. Brady and both parties were \nafforded an opportunity to cross examine him.28 \n22.  On July 10 and 13, the Court held an evidentiary hearing.29  On July 10, the \nCourt heard testimony from Plaintiff Russell Leaks, Robert Pigram, a Class member, and \nDr. Homer Venters, who conducted an inspection of the Jail on behalf of Plaintiffs.  On \nJuly 13, the Court heard testimony from Chief Fields, Attorney General Weirich, and Judge \nCampbell.  \nII.  Weighing the Evidence. \n23.  The issues in this case concern the Jail’s operations and the prevention and \nmitigation of the spread of COVID-19.  These are medical and scientific questions.  \nAccordingly, the testimony of the experts in the case, especially those that provided live \ntestimony—Drs. Goldenson and Venters and Mr. Brady—are accorded greater weight than \nthe fact witnesses that presented evidence in this case. \n24.  Dr.  Goldenson  is  an  expert  with  28  years’  experience  working  in \ncorrectional health in the San Francisco County Jail.30  For 23 years, Dr. Goldenson was \n                                                 \n26   See ECF No. 69, Pg.ID 986. \n27   See ECF Nos. 76 and 80. \n28   See ECF No.  \n29   See ECF Nos. 108 and 111. \n30   Hr’g Tr. 75:21-76:4 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 11 of 60    PageID 2340\nthe director and medical director of health services in the San Francisco County Jail.31  Dr. \nGoldenson developed communicable disease policies in his role as medical director in the \njail and oversaw clinical and administrative operations.32  \n25.  Dr. Venters is a physician, internist, and epidemiologist with over a decade \nof experience in correctional health, who has conducted numerous inspections to evaluate \ncorrectional facilities’ responses to COVID-19.33  Since April 2020, Dr. Venters has been \nasked to conduct court-ordered inspections of six other facilities to evaluate their COVID-\n19 responses.34  Dr. Venters has been invited to present COVID-19 guidance to a number \nof organizations including the National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of \nCounties, and the American Medical Association.35  \n26.  Mr. Brady is an expert in prison and jail operations, the ADA, and the \nprevention and mitigation of the spread of infectious disease and public health in the \ncorrectional setting from an operational and non-clinical perspective.36  \n27.  Although they were afforded an opportunity to do so, Defendants neither \nsought to conduct their own expert inspection of the Jail nor did they provide any other \nexpert testimony or evidence concerning the conditions at the Jail.37 \n                                                 \n31   Hr’g Tr. 75:25-76:2 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36. \n32   Hr’g Tr. 76:2–6 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36. \n33   Report of Dr. Homer Venters dated July 9, 2020 (“Venters Report”), ECF No. 107-1, \n¶¶ 1, 5. \n34   Id. at ¶ 5. \n35   Id. at ¶ 6. \n36   Michael K.

Mr. Leaks and Mr. Pigram testified credibly and reliably, and subject to \ncross-examination  despite  concerns  over  retaliation  for  their  testimony,  about  their \nfirsthand knowledge of the conditions of their confinement in the Jail.   \n29.  Chief  Fields’s  testimony  is  unreliable  because  it  is  inconsistent  in \nsignificant and critical respects with the testimony of Dr. Donna Randolph.38  And, \naccording to Mr. Brady, Chief Fields does not spend much time in the Jail’s living units.39 \nIII.  Plaintiffs and the Class and Subclass Members Risk Loss of Health or \nLife from COVID-19 While Confined in the Jail. \n30.  COVID-19  is  a  serious  illness  caused  by  SARS-CoV-2,  a  novel \ncoronavirus.40    In  severe  cases,  COVID-19  can  require  hospitalization  and  lead  to \nrespiratory failure and death.41   COVID-19 is both more infectious and more deadly than \nother serious communicable diseases such as H1N1 or tuberculosis.42    \n31.  Persons infected with COVID-19 can require advanced medical support \nincluding  mechanical  ventilation  and  extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation.43    This \nheightened level of care is extremely resource intensive.  It requires specialized equipment, \nthe supply of which is limited.  It also requires an entire team of healthcare providers, \n                                                 \nDr. Donna Randolph (“D. Randolph Dep.”) (attached hereto as Ex.

Since this lawsuit was filed, the severity of the pandemic in Tennessee \ngenerally and Shelby County specifically has increased dramatically.  As of July 15, 2020, \nthere have been 66,016 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tennessee and 758 deaths.45  In \nShelby County alone there have been 14,804 cases and 229 deaths.46  On May 20, the \naverage number of deaths that week in Tennessee was five.47  On July 13, the weekly \naverage number of deaths was 13.48   \n33.  As of mid-May, around the time Plaintiffs commenced this action, 151 \ndetainees and 66 staff members at the Jail had tested positive.49  As of July 10, according \nto the Sheriff’s Office, 169 detainees had tested positive.50 On July 12, 2020, it was \nreported that a further seven detainees and another eleven staff members at the Jail had \n                                                 \n44   Griffin Decl. ¶ 7. \n45   The New York Times, Tennessee Coronavirus Map and Case Count (last updated \nJuly 15, 2020), available at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/tennessee-\ncoronavirus-cases.html. \n46   Id. \n47   Id. \n48   Id. \n49   Yolanda Jones, West Tennessee Prisons, Shelby County Jail Hit Hard by \nCoronavirus, Daily Memphian (May 18, 2020), available at \nhttps://dailymemphian.com/article/14121/tennessee-departmentof-correction-shelby-\ncounty-jail-covid-19-testing-positive. \n50   Shelby County Sheriff, Weekly Coronavirus/Covid-19 Update (Jul. 10, 2020), \navailable at https://twitter.com/ShelbyTNSheriff. \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 14 of 60    PageID 2343\ntested positive for COVID-19.51  There are currently eleven individuals detained at the Jail \nwho are positive.52  Two detainees have required hospitalization for COVID-19.53 \n34.  There is no vaccine for COVID-19 and no known cure.54  Defendants at all \nrelevant times knew that there is no vaccine or known cure for COVID-19.55  COVID-19 \nis transmitted by air and touch through aerosol droplets created when an infected person \ncoughs, sneezes, or talks.56  COVID-19 is able to move fairly freely from one unit to \nanother in the Jail because the respiratory droplets that transmit the virus can persist and \ntravel in the air.57 \n35.  Maintaining  at  least  six  feet  of  physical  distance  between  individuals \n(“social distancing”) is one of the only known ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.58  \nThis is true because the virus that causes COVID-19 is “highly infectious,” and can be \ntransmitted by people exhibiting few or no symptoms of the disease.59  Vigilant hygiene, \n                                                 \n51   See Sara Mcaraeg, COVID-19 Cases Spike In Shelby County Corrections as Hearings \nContinue In Class-Action Jail Suit, Memphis Commercial Appeal (Jul. 12, 2020), \navailable at https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/health/2020/07/12/covid-\n19-cases-spike-shelby-county-jails-lawsuit-continues/5424075002/. \n52   See Hr’g.

The  CDC  recognizes  that  “[c]orrectional  and  detention  facilities  face \nchallenges in controlling the spread of infectious diseases because of crowded, shared \nenvironments and potential introductions by staff members and new intakes.”61  \n37.

The Jail Does Not Protect the Medically Vulnerable. \n44.  Mr. Brady found that the “Wellpath COVID-19 response plan is inadequate \nto protect the vulnerable inmates housed in the Shelby County Jail.”75  He also found that \nthat “Wellpath leadership needs to be more aggressive and more vocal about protecting the \nvulnerable inmates in their care” and that it should insist that “harmful practices [to their \npatients] be discontinued.”76 \n45.  Prior to the Court’s Order that the Jail produce a list of medically vulnerable \nand disabled detainees, the Jail did not have such a list.  Dr. Donna Randolph, the Shelby \nCounty Jail Medical Director, testified that she was not aware of such a list.77  She stated \nthat she neither reviewed detainees’ medical histories to determine whether they are at high \nrisk from COVID-19 nor did she know if anyone else had.78 \n                                                 \n72   COVID-19 in Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (June 25, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-\nprecautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html (last visited July 14, 2020). \n73   The Color of Coronavirus: COVID-19 Deaths by Races and Ethnicity in the U.S., \nAPM RESEARCH LAB (July 8, 2020), \nhttps://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race.   \n74   Tiffany Ford, et al., Race Gaps in COVID-19 Deaths Are Even Bigger Than They \nAppear, Brookings (June 16, 2020), https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-\nfront/2020/06/16/race-gaps-in-covid-19-deaths-are-even-bigger-than-they-appear/ \n(last visited July 14, 2020).  \n75   Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1187. \n76   Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1189. \n77   D.

Chief Fields testified that he relied on Wellpath to construct the list, but he \ndid not know how it was prepared or if the list was accurate.79 \n47.  Chief Fields testified that not until the Order of this Court did the Jail \ndevelop  a  list  of  detainees  vulnerable  to  COVID-19,80  which  could  explain  why, \nnotwithstanding the Court’s notice on May 27 that, “if I do require you to turn over the list \nat some point, I’m going to want that list turned over immediately,”81 and despite the \nCourt’s “hope” that Defendants were tracking the information “as people are housed,”82 \nDefendants still required an extension of the deadline before filing it with the Court.83 \n48.  Dr. Donna Randolph testified that, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, she \ndid not treat detainees with chronic conditions any differently from the rest of population, \nstating, “I just try to take care of everybody the same and try to keep everybody safe, \nwhether they have a chronic condition or they don’t.”84 \n49.  Instead, according to Mr. Brady, “[t]he vulnerable inmates/ADA inmates . \n. . are scattered throughout the jail in all security levels on all floors.”85  He recommended \nthat the Jail “identify living units where the vulnerable population can be sequestered away \n                                                 \n79   Hr’g Tr. 87:20-88:16 (July 13, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n80   Hr’g Tr. 87:20–88:2 (July 13, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n81   Hr’g Tr. 102:18–103:1 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36. \n82   Id. at 104:12–19. \n83   See Respondents-Defendants’ Motion, ECF No. 40. \n84   D.

Dr. Venters also reported that there is no “plan to cohort or house together \npeople who are medically vulnerable,” which is a “basic approach that allows for increased \nfocus on screening, infection control and social distancing among the most vulnerable \ndetained people.”88 \n51.  Based on his inspection, Dr. Venters observed that there “did not appear to \nbe any specific effort to create a COVID-19 plan for the care of each medically–vulnerable \npatient.”89  For example, Jail staff have never asked Mr. Leaks whether he needed any \nmodifications or accommodations in the 5B pod where he is housed in light of his medical \nconditions and the COVID-19 pandemic.90 \n52.  Dr.  Venters  also  observed  that  there  is  no  daily  screening  of  their \ntemperature or for symptoms of COVID-19.91  And, Dr. Venters noted that there is no plan \nof care for those patients who are recovering from COVID-19.92  Mr. Pigram noted that \npersons quarantined in Pod 6B after testing positive for COVID-19 were not given medical \ncare.93  When persons in quarantine with COVID-19 asked for Tylenol for headaches, they \n                                                 \n86   Id. at Pg.ID 1188. \n87   Id. \n88   Venters Report ¶ 25(a) (emphasis added). \n89   Id. ¶ 25(c). \n90   Hr’g Tr. 29:3–12 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n91   Id. ¶ 25(b) \n92   Id. ¶ 25(d) \n93   Hr’g Tr. 95:8–95:16 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 20 of 60    PageID 2349\nwere told to order Tylenol on commissary.94  However, only ibuprofen was available on \ncommissary, which is not recommended for COVID-19 patients.95  Mr. Pigram put in a \nsick call the day he arrived in 6B, but did not get an answer until one week later.96  \nIndividuals experiencing symptoms were told to put in sick calls, and then told that they \nwere being referred to a physician, but they never saw a physician.97 \nV.  Adequate Social Distancing Is Impossible at the Jail. \n53.  The CDC defines social distancing as “the practice of increasing the space \nbetween individuals and decreasing the frequency of contact to reduce the risk of spreading \na disease (ideally to maintain at least 6 feet between all individuals, even those who are \nasymptomatic).98  Social  distancing  is  the  “cornerstone  of  reducing  transmission  of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID 19.”99  Wearing masks and increasing cleaning, \nalthough helpful, are not substitutes for social distancing.100  According to Mr. Brady, one \n                                                 \n94   Id. at 95:8–20.   \n95   Id. at 95:21–96:5.   \n96   Id. at 96:13–17.   \n97   Id. at 96:13–24. \n98   Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html (last \nreviewed July 15, 2020). \n99   Id.; see also Griffin Decl. ¶ 4 (“One known effective way to reduce the risk of \ninfection is to practice ‘social distancing.’”). \n100  Hr’g Tr. 79:14–80:1 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36  (Q: Can’t [the issue of \nasymptomatic or presymptomatic spread] be addressed with masks, potentially \ngloves, . . . . cleaning supplies . . .?

Detainees testified, and were subject to cross-examination, regarding the \nimpossibility of social distancing in the Jail.  Mr. Pigram testified that cellmates spend 18 \nhours a day in their cells together, that it is impossible to remain six feet apart there, and \nthat they can reach out and touch one another from any place in the cell.102  Mr. Leaks also \ntestified that it is impossible to keep six feet of distance from others in the line for meals \nor when eating at the tables or in their bunks.103  Several detainees reported to Mr. Brady \nthat “social distancing is not possible.”104 \n55.  For example, in H pod, where Plaintiff Favian Busby is assigned, 42 men \nshare a common area which they must use to eat meals, recreate, and receive medication \nat the time this motion was filed.105  Of those 42, 26 had a cellmate.106  During meals and \nwhile watching TV or playing cards, detainees sit at tables four feet in diameter where they \ncannot maintain social distancing.107  Security staff in H pod move throughout the pod in \nclose proximity to incarcerated people.108 \n                                                 \n101  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1173. \n102  Hr’g Tr. 88:17–89:8 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n103  Hr’g Tr. 44:17–45:6 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n104  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1183. \n105  First Spickler Decl. ¶¶ 11, 13, 16. \n106  Id. ¶ 13. \n107  Id. ¶¶ 13, 16. \n108  Id. ¶ 15. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 22 of 60    PageID 2351\n56.  As of July 10, 2020, Mr. Leaks is housed in 5B pod which is an open \ndormitory-style unit with 32 bunk beds.109  The dormitory is approximately 50’ x 160’.110  \nAs of June 10, there were 22 men in 5B.111  Mr. Leaks slept on the lower section of a bunk \npositioned approximately two feet from another bunk bed.112  A detainee at one bunk could \neasily reach out his hands and touch a detainee on a another bunk.113  Bunkbeds are placed \nabout three and a half feet apart.114  The detainees are assigned to a specific bed by \nclassification and cannot change the assignment themselves.115  The detainees spend on \naverage 14 to 15 hours a day at their bunks.116  They are on lock down, for example, from \n9:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. and cannot leave their bunks during that time.117  They have to stay \nin their bunks even if someone is coughing or sick right next to them.118  Detainees in 5B \nshare nine toilets, four showers, and six phones.119   \n57.

The eating area in 5B has seven tables on one side and five tables on the \nother.123  The tables are three and a half feet wide, and as many as five people can sit at the \ntable at a given time.124  A detainee sitting at a table can easily touch the hand of another \nman sitting across him.125  The tables are in close proximity to the telephones, the TV, and \nfive or six bunks.126   \n59.  During meal time, the detainees in 5B line up behind each other to receive \ntheir trays through the bars at the sally port separating the pod and the hallway outside.127  \nIt is impossible to keep a six feet distance from others in the line.128  After they receive \ntheir trays, detainees eat at the tables for 20 minutes before the trays have to be taken out \nof the pod.129  It is impossible to keep a six feet distance from others at the table.130  \nDetainees can also eat at their bunks.131  It is similarly impossible to keep six feet of \ndistance from others while eating at the bunks.132  Mr. Leaks, who is medically vulnerable, \n                                                 \n121  Id. at 38:8‒38:13. \n122 Id.   \n123  Hr’g Tr. 39:4‒39:16 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n124  Id.   \n125  Id. at 43:22‒44:3.   \n126  Id. at 39:18‒39:23.   \n127  Hr’g Tr. 39:25‒40:13 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n128  Id. at 44:17‒44:21.   \n129  Id.   \n130  Id. at 44:17‒44:21. \n131  Id. at 44:4‒44:15. \n132  Id. at 44:17‒45:6.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 24 of 60    PageID 2353\nused to eat at his bunk often.  Right before Mr. Brady’s visit he was moved.  He has since \nstopped eating at his bunk because his new bunk is too close to the restroom.133   \n60.  Detainees in 5B use phones throughout the day.134  The phones are near to \nthe tables, the bathrooms, and some of the bunks.135  When detainees are using the phones, \nit is not possible for them to socially distance from others in the pod.136  The phones are \nalso placed right next to each other, so a detainee on one phone could easily touch another \none on the phone next to him by just bending his elbow a little.137   \n61.  During  pill  call,  detainees  line  up  behind  each  other  to  receive  their \nmedication.138  As of July 10, approximately 16 to 20 people stand in line at a time for pill \ncall.139  During those times, it is impossible to keep six feet of distance from others in the \nline.140   \n62.

Mr. Brady found that “the Shelby County Jail is not maximizing its efforts \nto enforce social distancing in its living units.”161  The “only place” Dr. Venters “really \nsaw social distancing in the whole facility was in the booking area.”162  Dr. Venters \n“observed a lack of social distancing through all areas of the Jail” and concluded that \n“social distancing is not being facilitated or practiced with the rigor required to prevent \ndisease spread.”163  Dr. Venters also testified that there is “very little effort to implement \nsocial distancing, particularly in the common spaces, outside housing areas, also inside the \nhousing areas, both in the sleeping areas as well as the common spaces.”164 \n68.  Although  the  Jail  has  placed  six-foot  markers  to  encourage  social \ndistancing, Dr. Venters observed that even with the markers, people are still brushing up \nagainst each other, and that the “most crucial element” of ensuring social distancing “is the \ntraining and behavior of the security staff.”165 During pill call, social distancing is only \nbeing practiced, said Dr. Venters, “for those four or five seconds” when detainees step to \nthe pill call window to receive medication.166 \n69.  Mr. Brady also concluded that “there is no concentrated and coordinated \neffort to assemble and present information to the courts regarding an inmate’s medical \nconditions that may make him vulnerable to serious illness or death while housed in the \n                                                 \n161  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1189. \n162  Hr’g Tr. 154:18–23 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108.   \n163  Venters Report ¶ 15(a). \n164  H’rg Tr. 119:19–22 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n165  Hr’g Tr. 159:6–14 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n166  Hr’g Tr. 156:3–5 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 28 of 60    PageID 2357\njail.”167  He also found that there is no “consistent multi-disciplinary effort within the jail \nto secure alternative custody venues for vulnerable inmates.”168 \n70.  Dr. Donna Randolph confirmed that, “in the context of the coronavirus,” \nshe had not worked with the Jail’s Special Assistant-Criminal Justice Expediter “about the \npotential release of any detainees” because her “patients are well cared for” and because \nshe “didn’t have anybody that [she] – that even though they fit into [the medically \nvulnerable] categories], that [she] was concerned about.”169 \n71.  According to documents produced by Defendants in this action, for the \nperiod  between  March  12,  when  the  Tennessee  state  governor  declared  a  state  of \nemergency, and June 24, the average population in the Jail was 1,854.  On June 24, the \ntotal population was 1,826.170  As of July 10, the population was 1,857.171  And, there are \nstill 450 medically vulnerably and/or disabled detainees in in the Jail who are members of \nthe Plaintiff Classes.172   \n                                                 \n167  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1193.   \n168  Id. \n169  D.

The Jail Does Not Test Adequately for COVID-19. \nA.  To Track and Contain the Spread of COVID-19, Comprehensive Testing \nis Necessary. \n72.  COVID-19 can be spread by persons not experiencing symptoms, and \nasymptomatic spread of the disease appears to be higher than other illnesses.173 \n73.  On June 13, 2020, the CDC formally recommended testing of all persons in \n“settings that house vulnerable populations in close quarters for extended periods of time,” \nincluding “correctional and detention facilities,” in order to enable “early identification of \nasymptomatic individuals.”174  The CDC further recommends “initial testing of everyone \nresiding and/or working in the setting, [r]egular (e.g., weekly) testing of everyone residing \nand/or working in the setting, and [t]esting of new entrants into the setting and/or those re-\nentering after a prolonged absence (e.g., one or more days).”175   \n74.  Mr. Brady testified that testing is a “much more scientifically sound way to \ndetect the COVID-19 virus in asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic individuals” \nthan “timing out” the virus.176  He agreed that, in fact, the “only definitive way to know \nwho has COVID-19 is through testing.”177 \n                                                 \n173  Hr’g Tr. 138:15–18 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108 ([I]t might be the case that a \nsignificant amount of the virus could be stopped if we did not have asymptomatic \nspread, but unfortunately, with this virus, we have a fair amount of asymptomatic \nspread.); Hr’g Tr. 79:9–13 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36 ([T]here’s no way to ensure \nthat this afternoon, someone was coming on duty for the afternoon or the evening \nshift won’t be asymptomatic or presymptomatic and bring the virus into the jail and \nthereby risk exposing anyone they initially come into contact with.).    \n174  Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/ hcp/testing \noverview.html#asymptomatic_without_exposure (last updated June 13, 2020). \n175  Id. \n176  Hr’g Tr. 17:15–18:12, (July 1, 2020), ECF No. 84. \n177  Id. 18:15–18. \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 30 of 60    PageID 2359\n75.  Defendants  are  aware  that  COVID-19  positive  individuals  may  be \ncontagious even though they are not asymptomatic.178  Dr. Venters testified that it has been \ngeneral knowledge from around mid- to late-March that “COVID-19 can be transmitted \nfrom person to person before somebody develops symptoms.”179 \nB.  The Jail Failed to Test Staff and Detainees for Long Periods of Time. \n76.  The Jail has not tested either staff or detainees for long periods of time, \ndespite knowing that the population contained a number of positive COVID-19 individuals.  \nBetween April 24, 2020 and April 30, 2020, thirty-two staff members were tested on-site \nfor COVID-19, five of whom tested positive.180  The first tests for COVID-19 among \ndetainees took place between March 24, 2020 and April 9, 2020.181  Eighteen tests were \nperformed on eighteen detainees, all of whom tested positive.  Between March 24, 2020 \nand April 30, 2020, of the 334 detainees tested for COVID-19, 157 tested positive.182 \n77.  No testing was conducted on staff between April 30, 2020 and June 12, \n2020.183  As of June 9, 2020, no one in any of the three dormitory-style pods on the 5th \nfloor of the Jail had been tested for COVID-19, despite several people displaying possible \nsymptoms.184  Similarly, no testing was conducted on detainees between April 30, 2020 \n                                                 \n178  B.

Chief Fields testified that, starting in the middle of April the Jail started to \nget notices that there was a shortage of test kits and for most of May the Jail did not have \ntesting kits.186  But Dr. Bruce Randolph, the Health Officer at the Shelby County Health \nDepartment, testified that the Health Department had testing kits for the Jail and has not \ndenied a request by the Jail for testing kits.187   \n79.  Cases continue to climb among the staff and detainee population at the Jail. \nAs of July 10, 2020, the Shelby County Sheriff's Office (“SCSO”) reported an increase of \nseven new detainee cases from the week prior, and among agency employees, SCSO \nreported an increase of 11 cases in the same period.188 \nC.  The Jail’s “Non-Test Based” Approach Is Inadequate. \n80.  Contrary  to  the  CDC’s  recommendation  for  a  “wider  approach  to \nasymptomatic testing” for jails and other congregate settings,189 the Jail employs a “non-\ntest based” approach to COVID-19.190  As Mr. Brady testified, “[a] nontest-based strategy \n                                                 \n185  Id. \n186  Hr’g Tr. 95:14–19 (July 13, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n187  B.

The Jail does not test asymptomatic patients, at intake or otherwise, even \nthough they are aware that asymptomatic patients may be contagious.193  The protocols that \nthe Jail relies on do not include testing asymptomatic patients194 and the Shelby County \nHealth Department does not recommend testing of asymptomatic individuals.195  Both the \nJail’s  protocols  and  the  Health  Department’s  recommendations  contravene  CDC \nguidelines.196 \n82.  Moreover, “given the punitive conditions in which those who test positive \nfor COVID-19 are housed . . . [detainees] are disincentivized from reporting symptoms or \ntaking a COVID-19 test.”197  Dr. Venters testified that people with whom he spoke \ncomplained of being locked up in the medical isolation unit without being allowed out of \ntheir cells and without a health checkup from Friday evening to Monday morning.198   \nDetainees in other parts of the Jail have expressed similar concerns.199  As a result, said Dr. \n                                                 \n191  Hr’g Tr. 3:6–8 (July 1, 2020), ECF No. 84. \n192  Venters Report ¶ 19. \n193  D.

Rather than seek out people who may be contagious, or encourage detainees \nto come forward with their symptoms, Defendants place an “obligation” on detainees to \nreport symptoms.201 \n84.  The testing at the Jail, therefore, is “too limited” particularly in light of the \nconcerning inability to undertake contact tracing, social distancing, and “the lack of ability \nto keep the virus from spreading around outside places like quarantine units, new admission \nunits, [and] the medical isolation unit.”202 \nD.  The Jail Failed to Adhere to Wellpath’s Policy for COVID-19 Testing. \n85.  The Jail at all times lacked a testing policy.203  The Jail also has no plans to \nconduct  initial  and  periodic  testing  of  individuals  in  accordance  with  CDC \nrecommendations.204  Instead, the Jail relied on Wellpath, a third-party medical provider, \nto develop a testing policy. \n86.  Wellpath issued a policy that addressed post-testing management of patients \nwho have tested positive.205  The policy calls for a 21-day quarantine for a patient who has \n                                                 \n200  Hr’g Tr. 120:17–121:1 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n201  Id. at 177:13–178:11 (Q: “Well, I mean, there is an obligation upon someone who \nfeels sick to tell somebody.” A: “[I]n managing outbreaks behind bars . . . and this is \ntrue of basic public health . . . when we want to find a problem, we go look for it.

Dr. Donna Randolph testified under oath that at no time did the Jail ever \nimplement  the  Wellpath  testing  recommendation.    Instead,  after  a  supposed  21-day \nquarantine, detainees who had previously tested positive were released into the general \npopulation without any further testing.207   \n88.  Dr.  Donna  Randolph  also  testified  that  the  Jail  has  never  followed \nWellpath’s recommendation for testing patients at intake, or for testing them again seven \nand ten days after a positive test result.208 \n89.  Mr. Brady confirmed that, if a detainee tests positive for COVID-19 at \nintake, his  temperature  is  taken for 21 days, but  no additional COVID-19 tests  are \nperformed before the detainee is released into general population.209 \n90.  Indeed, Mr. Pigram testified that detainees who had tested positive for \nCOVID-19 and who insisted on being tested before being released back to the general \npopulation were pepper sprayed by Jail staff for refusing to leave their unit without being \ntested—notwithstanding the adverse effects that pepper spraying could have on them while \nthey  were  infected  with  COVID-19—but  they  were  not  tested  before  they  were \nreintroduced to general population.210   \n                                                 \n206  Id. \n207  D.

Despite knowing of this incident,211 from April until the second day of the \nevidentiary hearing in this case on July 13, Chief Fields wrongfully believed that detainees \nwho tested positive had to have two negative tests before they were released back into the \ngeneral population.  That was never happening.  At the July 13 evidentiary hearing, Chief \nFields acknowledged that these detainees, who had tested positive for COVID-19, were \nnot actually re-tested before they were reintroduced to the general population.212 \n92.  Chief Fields admitted on cross examination that failure to test people who \nhad tested positive and letting them back into the general population increased the “risk of \nthe spread of virus throughout [the] entire facility.”213  Indeed, Chief Fields admitted that, \nbecause they were letting people back into the general population without testing them, \nwhatever efforts the Jail had made to contain the spread of the virus “would be for \nnaught.”214  \nVII.  The Jail Has No Effective Medical Isolation or Quarantine. \n93.  According to Dr. Venters, “‘medical isolation’ refers to the practice of \ntaking people who have COVID-19 or have symptoms of COVID-19, separating them from \nother people, and providing them with additional surveillance and care.”215  Medical \nisolation is a critical component of contact tracing: when a new COVID-19 case is \n                                                 \n211  Id. \n212  Hr’g Tr. 94:20–95:5; 97:10–98:3 (July 13, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n213  Hr’g Tr. 80:15–19 (Jul. 10, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n214  Hr’g Tr. at 80:20–25 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n215  Venters Report ¶ 21. \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 36 of 60    PageID 2365\nidentified, the appropriate response is to “find[] all of the known contacts of that person,” \n“identify[] them accurately,” and “put[] them somewhere separate.”216 \n94.  As Dr. Venters explained, absent comprehensive testing, mitigating the \nspread of the disease at the Jail required “rigorous isolation of persons with potential and \nknown exposure to the disease.”217  \nA.  The “Medical Isolation Unit” for COVID-19 Positive Detainees Provides \nNo Isolation. \n95.  At the Jail, the medical isolation unit is on 2A, where people with confirmed \ncases of COVID-19 are detained.  Dr. Venters testified that he had “very grave concerns \nabout the medical isolation practices” because the medical isolation unit on 2A is enclosed \nby bars, rather than a solid door.218  It has “no physical separation” and is not actually \nisolated “because of the open nature and the free flow of air and virus from the people who \nare positive in that unit to the unit across the way. . . the common areas that connect to that \nunit.”219  Again, this is an inherent problem with the structure of the Jail that cannot be \nremedied through a change in procedures.   \n96.  Ensuring that there is “a physical separation between the COVID patients \nand everybody else” is “the most basic thing that the CDC tells us we need,” according to \nDr. Venters.220  Dr. Venters stated that “the open nature of the medical isolation unit \nrepresents  a  deviation  from  CDC  recommendations  and  basic  infection  control \n                                                 \n216  Hr’g Tr. 122:9–19 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n217  Venters Report ¶ 20. \n218  Hr’g Tr. 123:14–21 (July 1, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n219  Id. \n220  Id. at 180:5–11.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 37 of 60    PageID 2366\nprinciples.”221  Dr. Venters opined that the medical isolation unit on 2A “represent[s] a \nthreat to the health of staff and detainees.”222 \nB.  There Is No Isolation Because Detainees Congregate in Advance of Court \nVisits. \n97.  According to Mr. Brady, although the Jail’s stated policy is that post-intake, \ndetainees “must remain in medical isolation for 21 days prior to being released to general \npopulation,”223 in fact detainees are not isolated for the full 21-day period.224  Instead, as \nMr. Brady testified, throughout the 21-day period, detainees “are required to be moved \nfrom their isolation units through the court tunnel and into holding cells for the General \nSessions Courts and the Criminal Courts of Shelby County.  The medically isolated inmates \nare mixed in the Court Division specific holding cells with 20-25 other general population \ninmates from throughout the jail for up to 4 hours . . . in the morning and afternoon multiple \ntimes a week.”225 \n98.  Mr. Brady observed no social distancing in two of the three holding cells.226 \nMr. Leaks testified that the area in which detainees are held from one and a half to five \nhours a day awaiting court is “packed to the limits.”227 \n                                                 \n221  Venters Report ¶ 22. \n222  Id. \n223  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1176. \n224  Hr’g Tr. 30:16–19 (July 1, 2020), ECF No. 84. \n225  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1181; Hr’g Tr. 30:20–31:25 (July 1, 2020), ECF \nNo. 84. \n226  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1181. \n227  Hr’g Tr. 32:23–33:11 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 38 of 60    PageID 2367\n99.  Mr. Brady found that this practice “defeats the whole purpose of medical \nisolation”228 and “undermines the integrity and purpose of the 21-day medical isolation that \nis designed to prevent the introduction of the Covid-19 virus into the jail population.”229 \nAs a consequence, Mr. Brady concluded that the practice “unquestionably puts vulnerable \ninmates and the ADA inmates at an unreasonable risk of harm from potential exposure to \nasymptomatic Covid-19 positive inmates.”230 \n100.  Dr. Venters was “left with the impression that the purported 21-day” period \nwas “not being consistently followed.”231  Dr. Venters asked several times for information \nabout the isolation practices, and was told by leadership that “people might be [in isolation] \nfor short periods of time before going to another spot in the facility.”232   \n101.  In speaking with patients in medical isolation in Unit 2A, Dr. Venters also \nfound that the daily health assessments of the individuals who have tested positive are \ninadequate.  The assessments are conducted through the bars, without any assessments on \nweekends, and no one listens to their lungs.233  \n102.  The leadership at the Jail, including Chief Fields, Assistant Chief Hubbard, \nDr. Donna Randolph, and Mr. Jeremy Sanders, “[a]ll verified that [the movement of \ndetainees out of quarantine on the lower level] was taking place.”234  In an April 28, 2020 \n                                                 \n228  Hr’g Tr. 32:8-12 (July 1, 2020), ECF No. 84 \n229  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1187. \n230  Id. at Pg.ID 1181. \n231  Venters Report ¶ 15(b). \n232  Hr’g Tr. 126:6–9 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108.   \n233  Venters Report, ¶ 26. \n234  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1181. \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 39 of 60    PageID 2368\nemail, Tiffany Ward, Assistant Chief, stated as a matter of policy: “Inmates in quarantine \nmay go to court.  The Court Tunnel will call for the inmate only when the court division is \nready for the inmate.”235 \n103.  Despite knowing that its isolation practices were ineffectual, only after Mr. \nBrady filed his report did the Jail attempt to work with the Shelby County Criminal Courts \nto arrive at a safer procedure for bringing detainees to Court.236  These attempts have \nineffectual because, even if they reduce the amount of traffic in the tunnel between the Jail \nand the courts, detainees are still required to leave isolation and to mix with detainees from \nthe general population.  As of July 13, the Jail still had not implemented sufficient video \nfeeds to allow detainees to appear remotely.237 \nC.  The Jail Does Not Quarantine Detainees Who May Have Been Exposed to \nthe Virus. \n104.  According to Dr. Venters, “[q]uarantine” refers “to separating people who \nmay have been exposed to COVID-19 from everyone else for a period of up to 14 days \nwith daily surveillance for new symptoms.”238 Dr. Venters explained that the rationale \nbehind quarantine, as delineated by the CDC, is that if the Jail wants to “control the \ndisease,” they need to “be able to have some sense of where the next case is coming from,” \nwhich is not possible if “the quarantine group is kind of mixing with other groups.”239 \n                                                 \n235  Emails from T.

But  the  Jail’s  so-called  “quarantine  units,”  like  its  so-called  “medical \nisolation units,” are fronted by open bars where “three units come together in a small shared \nhallway,” allowing “for free movement of air (and virus) into and out of the three units.”240  \nAs Dr. Venters testified, “this is particularly problematic for quarantine” because the \npurpose of quarantine is “to put people who have potentially been exposed to COVID in \none spot and . . . to keep them separate from everybody else.”241 \n106.  Dr. Venters stated that he has “never seen a facility rely on a housing unit \nto serve as an isolation or quarantine unit for the purposes of disease control that has open \nbars and no solid door,” which he opined as a “deeply disturbing practice that. . . is out of \ntouch with basic practices of infection control.”242  As with social distancing generally and \nwith the medical isolation unit, this is a structural problem with the Jail facility. \nVIII.  The Jail Has Not Made Reasonable Modifications for Detainees with \nDisabilities. \n107.  It is undisputed that Plaintiffs, and the members of the Subclass that they \nrepresent, have disabilities within the meaning of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n108.  It is undisputed that if the Subclass becomes infected with COVID-19, their \nchances of serious illness or death is higher than for people who are not medically \nvulnerable.  \n109.  Chief Fields, as director of the Jail, oversees the implementation of the Jail’s \nADA policy.243  He has delegated responsibility for ensuring the Jail’s compliance with the \n                                                 \n240  Venters Report ¶ 21, Hr’g Tr. 126:24–127:6 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n241  Hr’g Tr. 126:24–127:6, (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n242  Venters Report ¶ 28. \n243  Hr’g Tr. 84:14–24 (July 13, 2020), ECF No. 111. \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 41 of 60    PageID 2370\nADA to Wellpath.244  However, Dr. Donna Randolph does not know whether anybody \noversees the Jail’s compliance with the ADA.245  She also does not know to what kinds of \ndisabilities the ADA applies.246 \n110.  Chief Fields is also unfamiliar with the disabilities that are covered by the \nADA and he has never heard of the Rehabilitation Act.247  Chief Fields is unable to say \nwho in the Jail—as a group or a class of people—is protected by the ADA, despite the fact \nthat, under the Jail’s policy for ADA accommodation requests, Chief Fields is the final \narbiter regarding any requests that are in dispute.248  And, during his entire tenure as Chief \nJailer, Chief Fields has not received a single appeal.249 \n111.  Chief  Fields  was  unable  to  estimate  how  many  requests  for \naccommodations under the ADA the Jail receives per month and does not know on what \nthe Jail’s decisions to grant or deny a request for an accommodation are based.250  Chief \nFields is “responsible for reviewing ADA grievances,” but he has never seen a grievance \nform filed relating to a request for an accommodation.251 \n112.  According to Chief Fields, the only accommodation that is being made for \ndisabled detainees who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19 is that they are being \nhoused based on the decisions of the medical staff and they are given more direct attention \n                                                 \n244  Fields Dep.

That is all Chief Fields contends is being done for disabled \ndetainees,252 but even this testimony is disputed by Mr. Leaks and Mr. Pigram.253 \n113.  Conversely, it is undisputed that, other than possible extra “attention” from \nmedical staff, while detained at the Jail people with disabilities who are particularly \nvulnerable to COVID-19 receive no additional protection from infection, no greater access \nto social distancing, no greater access to PPE, and no socially distant way to access food, \nmedical care, or pill call.254 \n114.  Chief Fields testified that releasing detainees would neither have any impact \non his ability to manage the Jail, nor require a fundamental change in the purpose of the \nJail, nor would granting Plaintiffs’ motion require the Jail to take any unreasonable steps \nor actions in terms of the core functions of the Jail.255 \nIX.  Plaintiffs, and the Members of the Classes they Represent, Cannot Be \nMade Safe Now. \n115.  As Dr. Goldenson explained, “there can be no set of conditions that a jail \ncould impose that would make the medically vulnerable reasonably safe,” because “given \nthe nature of confinement . . . there’s not enough space to [social distance]” and because \n                                                 \n252  Id. at 90:18–91:3. \n253  Hr’g Tr. 30:16–20 (Jul. 10, 2020), ECF No. 108 (“Q: Mr. Leaks, I’m just wondering \nif the jail staff have ever asked you if you needed any conditions changed in the pod \ngiven your conditions and the COVID-10 outbreak? . . . A: No, ma’am.”); id. at \n84:14–23 (“Q: Mr. Pigram, since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, have you ever \nbeen offered sort of special care by the jail staff to prevent you from contracting the \nvirus, given your condition? . . .

Tr. 89:6–8 (“I just try to take care \nof everybody the same and try to keep everybody safe, whether they have a chronic \ncondition or they don’t.”) \n255  Id. at 92:1–16. \n38 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 43 of 60    PageID 2372\n“there’s really no way, given the fact that staff, including custody staff and medical staff \nare coming in and out on a daily basis . . . [that] even with the best screening that you can \ndo, there’s no way to ensure that someone is not going to bring the virus into the facility.”256    \n116.  Mr. Brady found that the Jail’s response to COVID-19 “is inadequate to \nprotect the vulnerable inmates housed in the Shelby County Jail” because adequate social \ndistancing among detainees is impossible, there is no adequate medical isolation, the Jail’s \nnon-testing  approach  is  “ineffective  and  useless,”  and  the  Jail  does  not  cluster  the \nvulnerable detainees in housing units together away from the general population.257 \n117.  Dr. Venters  similarly  concluded that, “because the improvements [he] \nrecommend[ed]” could not “occur fast enough to protect medically vulnerable persons \nfrom COVID-19,” it was his “opinion that medically vulnerable people housed in the \nShelby County Jail should be evaluated for release.”258   \n118.  Dr. Venters reached this conclusion based on the “lack of . . . either capacity \nor willingness” to create protections for persons at high risk of serious illness at the Jail,259 \nand because the Jail lacks the facilities “to meet the basic needs for quarantine and medical \nisolation and cohorting of medically vulnerable patients.”260  Accordingly, Dr. Venters \nconcluded that there “are some dynamics in the Jail that cannot be improved, which also \n                                                 \n256  Hr’g Tr. 78:3–25 (May 27, 2020), ECF No. 36. \n257  Brady Report, ECF No. 80, Pg.ID 1187. \n258  Venters Report ¶ 32. \n259  Hr’g Tr. 129:5–9 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n260  Venters Report ¶ 31(a); Hr’g Tr. 130:11–20 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108 (“Q: [D]o \nyou think if all these recommendations were adopted, that people at high risk of \nserious illness if they contract COVID-19 would be sufficiently safe?

Plaintiffs are not safe and they cannot be made sufficiently safe now to \nprevent irreparable constitutional injury. \nPROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nX.  Plaintiffs Have Satisfied the Requirements for Injunctive Relief. \n120.  Plaintiffs applied for a temporary restraining order, see ECF No. 2, but \nbecause Defendants are on notice and the Court allowed time for extensive briefing and \nconducted several hearings, including a two-day evidentiary hearing and a hearing to \nquestion Mr. Brady, the Court should treat Plaintiffs’ motion as one for a preliminary \ninjunction rather than for a temporary restraining order.  See Malam v. Adducci, No. 20-\n10829, 2020 WL 3512850, at *2 (E.D. Mich. June 28, 2020) (citing Perez-Perez v. \nAdducci, No. 20-10833, 2020 WL 2305276, at *3 (E.D. Mich. May 9, 2020)).  Here, the \nlinguistic difference between a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction is \nlargely academic as the same factors apply to both.  See Perez-Perez, 2020 WL 23005276, \nat *3 (citing Ohio Republican Party v. Brunner, 543 F.3d 357, 362 (6th Cir. 2008)).  \n121.  In determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction, courts evaluate \nfour factors: whether (1) the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) \nthe movant would suffer irreparable injury absent an injunction; (3) granting the injunction \nwould cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the public interest would be served by \ngranting the injunction.  Ne. Ohio Coal. for Homeless and Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local \n                                                 \n261 Venters Report, ¶ 31. \n262  Venters Report, ¶ 31(a). Hr’g Tr. 130:11–20 (July 10, 2020), ECF No. 108. \n40 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 45 of 60    PageID 2374\n1199 v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1009 (6th Cir. 2006).  These four factors “are not \nprerequisites that must be met, but are interrelated considerations that must be balanced \ntogether.  For example, the probability of success that must be demonstrated is inversely \nproportional to the amount of irreparable injury the movants will suffer absent the stay.”  \nId. (internal quotations omitted). \n122.  Plaintiffs face a high risk of irreparable injury absent an injunction, they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their Fourteenth Amendment claims and of their ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act claims, and the public interest favors granting the relief they seek. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Demonstrated a Likelihood of Irreparable Harm Absent an \nInjunction. \n123.  Plaintiffs are likely to experience irreparable injury absent an injunction, \nboth in the form of loss of health or life and in the form of an invasion of their constitutional \nrights.  See Malam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *3; Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 \n(6th Cir. 2012) (“When constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury \nis presumed.”). \n124.  In considering the risk of irreparable harm, the Court should consider the \ncurrent severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conditions at the Jail, including the \nextent to which any failure at the Jail to implement precautionary measures increases the \nrisk to Plaintiffs.  See Malam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *3.   \n125.  Population  reduction is significant  only  insofar as it allows detainees, \nincluding those who are asymptomatic but positive, to remain six feet apart at all times.  \nSee id. (finding that “[w]hether the Calhoun County Correctional Facility has a detainee \npopulation of three or 300, it fails to meet public health standards if those detainees cannot \nsocially distance themselves.”). \n41 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 46 of 60    PageID 2375\n126.   “A jail establishing COVID-19 precautions without ensuring adequate \nsocial distancing is the equivalent of ‘a NASCAR driver who spurns a seatbelt and helmet \nbecause she plans not to crash.’”  Malam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *8 (quoting Savino v. \nSouza, Case No. 1:20-10617-WGY (D. Mass. June 18, 2020), ECF No. 225). \n127.  Because Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Fourteenth \nAmendment claims, “no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”  Malam, 2020 \nWL 3512850, at *9 (citing Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir. 1984)). \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Demonstrated a Likelihood of Success on the Merits. \nUnconstitutional Punishment under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. \n128.  The  gravamen  of  Plaintiffs’  claim  is  that  there  are  no  conditions  of \nconfinement that would permit their safe detention.  Accordingly, the Court construes \nPlaintiffs’ lawsuit as challenging whether they can be safe in detention for the duration of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic absent some change in the totality of the circumstances, such as \na vaccine, therapeutic, or other unanticipated technological advancement that diminishes \nthe threat of the pandemic.  See Malam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *10.  \n129.  As pretrial detainees, Plaintiffs are protected by the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979). \n130.  Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, persons in \npretrial custody cannot be punished as part of their detention.  See id. (holding that “under \nthe Due Process Clause, a detained person may not be punished prior to an adjudication of \nguilt in accordance with due process of law.”).   \n131.  “In evaluating the constitutionality of conditions or restrictions of pretrial \ndetention that implicate only the protection against deprivation of liberty without due \n42 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 47 of 60    PageID 2376\nprocess of law . . . the proper inquiry is whether those conditions amount to punishment of \nthe detainee.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n132.  If a restriction or condition “is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal—\nif it is arbitrary or purposeless—a court permissibly may infer that the purpose of the \ngovernmental  action  is  punishment  that  may  not  constitutionally  be  inflicted  upon \ndetainees qua detainees.”  Id. at 539. \n133.  For a claim of unconstitutional punishment, “a pretrial detainee can prevail \nby providing only objective evidence that the challenged governmental action is not \nrationally related to a legitimate [that is, non-punitive] governmental objective or that it is \nexcessive in relation to that purpose.”  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 398 (2015).   \n134.  Defendants  have  only  two  legitimate  interests  in  Plaintiffs’  pretrial \ndetention:  to prevent a credible risk of flight and to prevent a credible, serious risk to public \nsafety.  See Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 8 (1951); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, \n745 (1987).   \n135.  Here, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff’s continued detention is \npunitive because the conditions of their confinement are unconstitutionally unsafe.  The \nSixth Circuit has applied Bell to conditions of confinement claims.  See Gay Inmates of \nShelby Cty. Jail v. Barksdale, 819 F.2d 289, 1987 WL 37565, at *2 (6th Cir. June 1, 1987) \n(holding that ““[t]he conditions of confinement of convicted inmates are evaluated under \nan eighth amendment standard, but a somewhat different standard applies to pretrial \ndetainees because, ‘under the Due Process Clause, a detainee may not be punished prior to \nan adjudication of guilt.’”)  \n43 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 48 of 60    PageID 2377\n136.  The test articulated in Bell is applicable here.  See Malam, 2020 WL \n3512850, at *18; see also Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 398 (finding that “[t]he Bell Court applied \n[an] objective standard to evaluate a variety of . . . conditions, including . . . double bunking.  \nIn doing so, it did not consider the . . . officials’ subjective beliefs about the policy.”).263 \n137.  Plaintiffs  have  rebutted  any  presumption  that  the  conditions  of  their \ncontinued detention provide reasonable care or safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nMalam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *18 (finding that “that Plaintiffs each have a heightened risk \nof a dire outcome from COVID-19; Plaintiffs face a significant risk of COVID-19 infection \nwhile  at  the  Calhoun  County  Correctional  Facility;  and  Defendants’  precautionary \nmeasures, even where followed, do not sufficiently mitigate that risk.”). \n138.  Plaintiffs continued detention at the Jail during the COVID-19 pandemic is \nnot rationally related to either interest and it is excessive in relation to both because \nPlaintiffs are not reasonably safe despite being entitled to “reasonable safety.”  Youngberg, \n457 U.S. at 324.264 \n                                                 \n263  It would be bizarre if the liability standard for pretrial detention was lower for \nexcessive-force allegations than for unconstitutional conditions allegations.  A higher \nliability standard is appropriate in force cases than in other conditions cases because \nof courts’ “appropriate hesitancy to critique in hindsight decisions necessarily made \nin haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second change,” \nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 320 (1986), and because of prison officials’ \n“competing obligations” to “take into account the very real threats . . . unrest presents \nto inmates and prison officials alike, in addition to the possible harms to inmates \nagainst whom force might be used.”  Id.  If excessive force is judged using an \nobjective standard, at least as favorable approach to conditions cases follows a \nfortiori.  Such an approach is consistent with longstanding law respecting other forms \nof detention.  See, e.g. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321–322  (1982) (finding \nthat individuals involuntarily confined because of their intellectual disabilities “are \nentitled to more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals \nwhose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.”). \n264 Further, both pretrial violence and pretrial flight are rare events.  Many systems \nmeasure these risks using proxy variables that are more common: re-arrest (which \n44 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 49 of 60    PageID 2378\n139.   Because Plaintiffs are not reasonably safe at the Jail during the COVID-19 \npandemic their continued detention is punitive.  See Malam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *18 \n(holding that “the finding the Plaintiffs’ current detention constitutes punishment flows \nlogically  from  the  Court’s  finding  that  Plaintiffs  face  irreparable  injury  absent  an \ninjunction.”). \n140.  There are not any conditions of confinement such that Plaintiffs’ continued \ndetention would not be excessive in relation to Defendants’ interest.  Id.  “Accordingly, \nany  conditions  of  confinement  at  the  [Jail],  as  it  exists  today,  are  likely  to  be \nunconstitutionally punitive.”  Id. \nUnconstitutional Confinement in Violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n141.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  also  protects  pretrial  detainees  from \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement.  That protection is at least as expansive as the \nprotection from cruel and unusual punishment accorded to post-conviction prisoners under \nthe Eighth Amendment.  See City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983) \n                                                 \ndoes not necessarily indicate that a person represents a danger to the community) and \nfailures to appear (which occur for innocuous reasons short of flight). See, e.g., \nMcNeil v. Comm. Prob. Services, LLC, 2019 WL 633012 at *14–15 (M.D. Tenn. Feb. \n14, 2019), aff'd, 945 F.3d 991 (6th Cir. 2019) (evaluating and adopting empirical \nevidence that in the District of Columbia, where 93 percent of all arrestees are \nreleased pretrial without money bond conditions, 98 percent are not arrested for \ncrimes of violence during the pendency of their case); Schulz v. State, 330 F.Supp.3d \n1344, 1361–63 (N.D. Ala. 2018) (noting “considerable evidence” that court date \nreminders are effective to reduce failure to appear rates, and that pretrial recidivism \nand missed court dates can both be managed effectively by unsecured bonds); see \nalso Shima Baradaran Baughman, Predicting Violence, 90 Tex. L. R. 497, 527 (2012) \n(evaluating large dataset and noting “even among felony defendants, there is a \nrelatively low level of re-arrest pretrial” with only 1.9 percent of all felony defendants \narrested for a violent felony during the pretrial period).   \n \n45 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 50 of 60    PageID 2379\n(holding that the Due Process Clause protects pretrial detained persons to at least the same \nextent as the Eighth Amendment protects convicted persons).   \n142.  Unconstitutional  confinement  claims  are  assessed  under  a  “deliberate \nindifference”  framework  imported  from  the  analysis  regarding  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment under the Eighth Amendment.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828 \n(1994) (holding that a “prison official’s ‘deliberate indifference’ to a substantial risk of \nserious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment.”).   \n143.  The  Eighth  Amendment’s  deliberate  indifference  analysis,  which  only \napplies to post-conviction prisoners and is inapplicable here, involves an objective and \nsubjective prong.  See Wilson v. Williams, 961 F.3d 829, 840 (6th Cir. 2020).  “To satisfy \nthe objective prong, an individual must show ‘that he is incarcerated under conditions \nposing a substantial risk of serious harm.’  Under the subjective prong, an official must \n“know[ ] of and disregard[ ] an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.’” Id. at 840 \n(omitting citations) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 837). \n144.  It remains an open question in the Sixth Circuit whether the culpable-state-\nof-mind rules applied to post-conviction prisoners apply to pretrial detainees.  See Cameron \nv. Bouchard, No. 20-1469, 2020 WL 3867393, at *5 (6th Cir. July 9, 2020) (finding that \n“[s]ince Kingsley, the circuits have split on whether deliberate indifference claims arising \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment are still governed by Farmer (requiring an objective \ninquiry for an officer’s state of mind) or instead are governed by Kingsley (requiring an \nobjective inquiry for an officer’s state of mind).  We have not ruled on the issue.  We need \nnot resolve the issue today”) (omitting citations).   \n46 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 51 of 60    PageID 2380\n145.  Although it remains an open question in the Sixth Circuit, Kingsley “calls \ninto serious doubt whether [Plaintiffs] need even show that show that the individual \ndefendant-officials were subjectively aware of [the risk to their safety].”  Richmond v. Huq, \n885 F.3d 928, 938 n.3 (6th Cir. 2018).   \n146.  Here, because there is no requirement that a pretrial detainee demonstrate \nthe wanton infliction of pain to establish a constitutional violation, Plaintiffs “can prevail \nby providing only objective evidence[.]”  Kingsley, 576 U.S. at 398.   \n147.  Even if Plaintiffs are required to prove the subjective prong of the deliberate \nindifference analysis, despite the fact that they are pretrial detainees and may not be \npunished at all under the Fourteenth Amendment, the evidence shows that Defendants \nknew that Plaintiffs “face a substantial risk of serious harm,” but Defendants “disregard[ed] \nthat risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847.   \n148.  The facts before the Sixth Circuit in Cameron and Wilson were different.  \nIn Cameron, the Sixth Circuit found that the Oakland County Jail in Michigan took \nnumerous steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including “quarantining any inmate \nexperiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and any inmate who had contact with a symptomatic \ninmate; checking inmates who were in symptomatic quarantine three times a day with a \nfull set of vitals including a temperature check; placing inmates that tested positive in the \npositive COVID-19 cells . . . using prepackaged meals for food service . . . promoting social \ndistancing by reducing cell numbers depending upon inmate classification; and providing \naccess  to  COVID-19 testing to  the entire inmate population.”   Cameron, 2020 WL \n3867393, at *5.   \n47 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 52 of 60    PageID 2381\n149.  In  Wilson,  the  court  found  that  the  federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  had \nimplemented a six-phase plan to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spreading at the Elkton \nPrison and that it had quarantined, isolated, and tested effectively and in accordance with \nCDC guidance.  Wilson, 961 F.3d at 841.  Importantly, however, in Wilson the district court \ndid not hold an evidentiary hearing prior to granting a preliminary injunction and it did not \nattempt to resolve factual discrepancies in the declarations provided by the parties.  Id. at \n843 n.4.  \n150.  The deficiencies at the Jail are more serious, more glaring, and more \ndangerous,  and  they  establish  that  Defendants  “acted  with  reckless  disregard  to  the \nsignificant risk of serious harm” to Plaintiffs.  See Pimentel-Estrada v. Barr, No. C20-495, \n2020 WL 209430, at *16 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 28, 2020) (finding ICE acted with reckless \ndisregard to the significant risk of serious harm to detainee from COVID-19). \nDiscrimination on the basis of disability in violation of Title II of the \nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  29 \nU.S.C. § 794. \n151.  Independent of the merits of their constitutional claims, Plaintiffs are likely \nto obtain the relief they seek on the merits of their statutory claims.  Defendants’ violations \nof the ADA are clearly cognizable under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, which extends the writ of \nhabeas corpus to an individual “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or \ntreaties of the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 2241 (emphasis added); see also Bogovich v. \nSandoval, 189 F.3d 999, 1004 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that, “[i]f an ADA claim challenges \nthe validity or duration of confinement, the prisoner’s sole federal remedy is the writ of \nhabeas corpus.”). \n152.  To establish a case of discrimination under Title II of the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must show “that he (1) is disabled under the statutes, (2) is \n48 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 53 of 60    PageID 2382\n‘otherwise qualified’ for participation in [a state or local government] program, and (3) ‘is \nbeing excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination’ \nbecause of his disability or handicap, and (4) (for the Rehabilitation Act) that the program \nreceives federal financial assistance.”  Hollis v. Howard, No. 16-5115, 2016 WL 9804159, \nat *2 (6th Cir. Dec. 21, 2016) (quoting Gohl v. Livonia Pub. Sch. Dist., 836 F.3d 672, 682 \n(6th Cir. 2016)).   \n153.  Plaintiffs and members of the Subclass are individuals with disabilities for \npurposes of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12102.  They are \n“qualified” for the programs, services, and activities that Plaintiffs challenge.  42 U.S.C. § \n12131(2). \n154.  The Jail is a “public entity,” and it is covered by Title II of the ADA.  See \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1), 12132.  The Jail receives federal financial assistance, and it is \ncovered by the Rehabilitation Act.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n155.  Title II of the ADA requires that public entities refrain from discriminating \nagainst qualified individuals on the basis of disability.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12132.   \n156.  The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA and implementing the \nRehabilitation Act require that public entities avoid policies, practices, criteria, or methods \nof administration that have the effect of excluding or discriminating against persons with \ndisabilities in the entity’s programs, services, or activities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), \n(b)(3), (b)(8).  The regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act impose \nthe same requirements.  See 34 C.F.R. §  104.4(b); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i). \n157.  Further, a public entity must “make reasonable modifications in policies, \npractices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on \n49 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 54 of 60    PageID 2383\nthe  basis  of  disability,  unless  the  public  entity  can  demonstrate  that  making  the \nmodifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n158.  “Title II imposes affirmative obligations on public entities and does not \nmerely require them to refrain from intentionally discriminating against the disabled.”  \nAbility Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 910 (6th Cir. 2004); 28 \nC.F.R. §§ 35-102(a), 35.130(a)-(b); Pierce v. D.C., 128 F. Supp. 3d 250, 269 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(holding that “nothing in the disability discrimination statutes even remotely suggests that \ncovered entities have the option of being passive in their approach to disabled individuals \nas far as the provision of accommodations is concerned.”). \n159.  “[A]dequate social distancing necessary to combat COVID-19 is a service \nprovided  to  incarcerated  individuals”  within  the  meaning  of  the  ADA  and  the \nRehabilitation Act.  See Denbow v. Maine Dept. of Corrections, No. 1:20-cv-00175, 2020 \nWL 3052220, at *22 (D. Me., June 8, 2020). \n160.  If, by reason of a disability, a medically vulnerable detainee needs more \nsocial distancing than others, it is uncontested that providing some measure of such social \ndistance would be a reasonable accommodation within the meaning of the ADA.  See id. \n161.  Other programs, services, and activities to which disabled detainees are \nentitled to equal access and equal benefit within the Jail include: meals, pill call, medical \nand mental health care, adjudication of their criminal cases, and safe housing. See 28 \nC.F.R. App. B, Part 35, “[T]itle II applies to anything a public entity does;”  Fraihat v. U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enf’t, No. EDCV 19-1546 JGB, 2020 WL 1932570, at *26 (C.D. \n50 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 55 of 60    PageID 2384\nCal. Apr. 20, 2020) (in ICE detention, “[t]he programmatic ‘benefit’ in this context . . . is \nbest understood as participation in the removal process.”)  \n162.  The  Jail’s  passive  and  ill-defined  approach  to  providing  reasonable \naccommodations  or  modifications  to  disabled  detainees  fails  to  meet  its  affirmative \nobligations to provide equal access and equal benefits to the Jail’s services, programs, and \nactivities.  Jail officials offered contradictory statements about how—and whether—people \nwith disabilities are being accommodated in the Jail.  Chief Fields has never seen an \naccommodation request form from a detainee, believes that Wellpath is responding to \naccommodations, and believes that he has “delegated” ADA compliance to Wellpath.265  \nWellpath’s medical director testified that she is not aware that Wellpath—or anyone else—\nis responsible for ADA compliance.266 \n163.  In any event, the Jail cannot avoid its obligations under the ADA or Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act “through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements” with \nthird parties.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1).  \n164.  The Jail has failed to meet its affirmative obligations to: provide reasonable \nmodifications;  afford  disabled  detainees  equal  benefit  to  its  services,  programs,  and \nactivities; and, avoid policies, practices, criteria or methods of administration that have the \neffect of excluding or discriminating against people with disabilities.  \n165.  As a result of these failures, continued detention of Subclass members \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic violates their ADA and Rehabilitation Act rights. \n                                                 \n265  Hr’g Tr. 85:20–24, 88:24–89:1; 87:9–19 (July 13, 2020). \n266  D. Randolph Dep. Tr. 124:13–15. \n51 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 56 of 60    PageID 2385\n166.  Because “Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the Jail has failed to make \nreasonable accommodations to allow members of the Disabled Class to participate safely \nin the programs of the Jail, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their \ndisability claim.”  Ahlman v. Barnes, No. SACV 20-835, 2020 WL 2754938, at *12 (C.D. \nCal. May 26, 2020). \nC.  The Balance of the Equities Favors Plaintiffs. \n167.  When the government opposes the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief, \nas Defendants do here, the final two factors—the balance of equities and the public \ninterest—merge, because “the government’s interest is the public interest.”  Pursuing \nAmerica’s  Greatness  v.  Fed.  Election  Comm’n,  831  F.3d  500,  511  (D.C.  Cir. \n2016) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). \n168.  “The public has an interest in preserving Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and \nin protecting public health.”  Malam, 2020 WL 3512850, at *19 (citing G&V Lounge Inc. \nv. Mich. Liquor Control Comm., 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994)). \n169.  The Court must balance these interests against the public’s interest in \npreventing a credible risk of flight and a credible, serious risk to public safety, neither of \nwhich require continued detention.  See Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 8 (1951); United States \nv. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). \n170.  The balance of equities weighs in Plaintiffs favor.  Plaintiffs have tailored \nthe relief sought in their motion to comport with the various factors that must be accounted \nfor to promote the public interest.  The relief Plaintiffs’ seek conditions their release on (a) \ntheir ability to quarantine safely,267 (b) the absence of clear and convincing proof that they \n                                                 \n267  Mr. Busby could safely quarantine at his brother’s house in Memphis.  He would \nhave access to his own room.  See First Spickler Decl., ECF No. 2-7, ¶ 8.  Mr. Nelson \n52 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 57 of 60    PageID 2386\npresent a risk of flight or danger that both (i) outweighs the risk of severe illness or death \npresented by their confinement in the Jail and (ii) cannot be reasonably managed by less \nrestrictive conditions of pretrial release, such that continued detention of the individual is \nreasonable under those circumstances; and (c) the absence of a specific plan by Defendants \nto mitigate the risk Plaintiffs face from continued detention subject to confirmation from \nan Independent Medical Professional that, in light of that plan, Defendants can assure \nPlaintiffs’ reasonable safety.  \nXI. The Remedy Plaintiffs Seek is Within the Court’s Habeas Jurisdiction. \n171.  The only adequate remedy at this time is to order Plaintiffs released from \ndetention on appropriate conditions.  See Pimentel-Estrada, 2020 WL 2092430, at *19 \n(finding that, “although there may be, as a theoretical matter, conditions under which \nPetitioner could be detained that would not violate his constitutional rights, the record in \nthis case provides no reason for the Court to believe Respondents could realistically create \nsuch conditions on an appropriate timeline.”) \n172.  It is well within the Court’s habeas jurisdiction to grant release, broadly \ndefined, subject to conditions.  Indeed, it is the typical relief granted in federal habeas \ncorpus.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 858 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(A writ of habeas corpus may be “styled in the form of a conditional or unconditional \nrelease order.”).  See also Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 403 (1993) (“The typical relief \ngranted in federal habeas corpus is a conditional order of release . . . .”); Chin Yow v. United \n                                                 \ncould safely quarantine with Venessa Retic, his fiancée.  He would have access to his \nown room.  See Dozier Decl., ECF No. 51, ¶ 5.  Mr. Leaks could safely quarantine at \nthe house belonging to his mother and sister.  He would have his own room.  See \nThird Spickler Decl., ECF No. 52, ¶ 5.   \n53 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 114   Filed 07/15/20   Page 58 of 60    PageID 2387\nStates, 208 U.S. 8, 13 (1908) (awarding habeas relief by ordering the release of non-citizen \nif certain conditions were not satisfied). \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant Plaintiffs’ Motion.  \nDated: July 15, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Andrea Woods \nBrice M.

PETITIONERS SHOULD NOT BE EXCUSED FROM EXHAUSTING STATE LAW REMEDIES. \nPetitioners concede that they did not attempt to exhaust state remedies prior to initiating \nthis § 2241 action. However, they argue that they should be excused from this requirement because \n(1) state law remedies are unavailable in Tennessee and (2) the exhaustion requirement should be \nwaived “in light of the unique threat posed by COVID-19.”  (ECF No. 35, PageID 526). Said \narguments are without merit, and dismissal is appropriate. \na.  State law remedies are available under Tennessee Law. \nState courts, like federal courts, are obliged to enforce federal law. O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, \n526 U.S. 838, 844 (1999). “Comity thus dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued \nconfinement…violates federal law, the state courts should have the first opportunity to review this \nclaim and provide any necessary relief.” Id. It is only when state law remedies do not provide the \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 2 of 11    PageID 664\npetitioner the ability to obtain the relief he seeks that state law remedies are considered unavailable. \nSee, e.g., Fazzini v. Ne.Ohio Corr. Ctr., 473 F.3d 229, 236 (6th Cir. 2009). \nContrary to Petitioners’ assertions that state law remedies are unavailable, Tennessee \ncourts regularly entertain motions from pre-trial detainees seeking release from custody on the \nbasis  that  their  federal  constitutional  rights,  including  rights  secured  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, are being violated due to their detention.1 These examples and numerous other \ncriminal cases reveal that as part of the “standard review process,” pre-trial detainees in Tennessee \ncan – and often do –  seek relief, including release, due to alleged violations of their constitutional \nrights during their pre-trial detainment. Nothing prohibits these Petitioners from asserting such a \nclaim in their respective state court proceedings simply because the underlying cause of their \nalleged rights violation is a pandemic. \nMoreover, in response to COVID-19, the Tennessee Supreme Court ordered that as part of \nthis “standard review process,” Tennessee courts must specifically consider the effects of COVID-\n19 in setting or eliminating bond. See In Re: COVID-19 Pandemic, ADM2020-00428 (Tenn. \nMarch 25, 2020) (ordering all judicial districts to implement plans to reduce the jail population \ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic through “bond reductions or eliminations, deferred sentences, and \nsuspended sentences….”). Trial courts are given “very wide latitude” on whether to set bail. See \n \n1 See e.g., State v. Burgins, 464 S.W.3d 298, 307-08 (Tenn. 2015) (considering on appeal pursuant to Rule 8(a) of the \nTennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure whether a pre-trial detainee’s due process rights as secured by the Fourteenth \nAmendment were violated when her bond was revoked); State v. Hill, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 643, *6 (Tenn. \nCrim. App. March 21, 2019) (considering on appeal pursuant to Rule 8(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal \nProcedure whether a pre-trial detainee’s due process rights as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment were violated \nbased upon the trial court’s order concerning the conditions of the detainee’s pre-trial release); State v. Clouse, 2001 \nTenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 504, *11 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 11, 2001) (considering whether pre-trial detainee’s \nconstitutional right to be free from double jeopardy as secured by the Fifth Amendment was being violated); State v. \nClark, 2010 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 249, *14 (Tenn. Crim. App. March 18, 2010) (considering whether convicted \ndefendant’s right to a speedy trial as secured by the Sixth Amendment was violated when trial court denied a motion \nto dismiss for denial of a speedy trial prior to trial); State v. Leavy, 1999 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1296, *7 (Tenn. \nCrim. App. Dec. 21, 1999) (considering whether convicted defendants’ pre-trial detention was “punitive”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 3 of 11    PageID 665\nState v. Melson, 638 S.W.2d 342, 358 (Tenn. 1982). Pursuant to the Tennessee Supreme Court’s \norders, Tennessee judges have and continue to consider a pre-trial detainee’s vulnerability to \ncontracting COVID-19, in addition to other statutory factors, in making determinations on whether \nto reduce bond and/or to release a pre-trial detainee from custody.  \nPetitioners rely heavily upon Cameron v. Bouchard, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083, **36-\n37 (E.D. Mich. May 21, 2020) to argue they should be excused from exhausting state law remedies. \nIn Cameron, the Court found that Michigan did not have adequate state law remedies available for \nthe petitioners to pursue release due to COVID-19 prior to bringing their habeas petition. There, \nthe Court did not excuse exhaustion because there was not a state law remedy that exactly mirrored \na federal habeas petition. The Court excused exhaustion because the Court knew of no Michigan \nlaw which allowed state law judges to release detainees as part of the “standard review process.” \nThe Court explained:  \nDefendants identify four instances where Oakland County Circuit Court judges \nreleased Jail inmates due to the coronavirus. In two cases, the state court did not \nidentify the court rule or state statute on which it was relying to grant relief. In the \nremaining two cases, the court cited Michigan Compiled Laws Section 801.59b, \nwhich is part of Michigan’s County Jail Overcrowding Act. The statute does not \nset forth a remedy for inmates to pursue. Instead, it grants judicial officers the \nauthority to suspend or reduce a jail sentence or modify bond in response to “a \ncounty jail overcrowding state of emergency.” See id.; Mich. Exec Order 2020-29 \n(Mar.  29,  2020).  To  the  extent  prisoners  have  obtained  relief  through  this \nmechanism during the coronavirus pandemic, it is not part of the “standard review \nprocess” and is not a remedy through which state courts have “provided relief ... in \nthe past.” \n \nCameron, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89083 at *36-37.2 Here, unlike in Cameron, Respondents have \n \n2 While Petitioners rely on Cameron to assert that they need not exhaust state law remedies because they are \n“unavailable,” the Eastern District of Michigan’s analysis of remedies available in the state of Michigan has no bearing \non whether remedies are available in Tennessee. Furthermore, federal courts in Michigan are divided on whether state \nlaw remedies in Michigan are available to obtain release in light of COVID-19. See Williams v. Rapelje, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 84609, *3 (E.D. Mich. May 14, 2020) (dismissing a § 2254 petition seeking release due to COVID-19 \nfor failure to exhaust state law remedies); Evil v. Whitmer, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70653, *8 (W.D. Mich. April 22, \n2020) (dismissing a petition seeking release due to COVID-19 because the petitioner failed to exhaust state law \nremedies which were available pursuant to Michigan rules allowing for the modification of pretrial custody orders).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 4 of 11    PageID 666\ndemonstrated that (1) Tennessee courts regularly entertain motions for release from pre-trial \ndetainees based upon allegations that their federal constitutional rights are being violated due to \ntheir detention, (2) in-person “proceedings necessary to protect constitutional rights of criminal \ndefendants,” have never been suspended in Tennessee during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) \nthe Tennessee Supreme Court has specifically directed courts to consider the effects of COVID-\n19 in setting, reducing, and eliminating bonds. Thus, Petitioners possess the means to challenge \ntheir confinement in state courts based upon allegations of constitutional rights violations and \npursuant to the Tennessee Supreme Court’s orders, state courts must consider the effects of \nCOVID-19 in deciding whether to detain or release them. Because state law remedies are available, \nPetitioners cannot be excused from seeking those remedies, and the petition should be dismissed. \nb.  No “exceptional circumstances” exist. \n   \n  Petitioners cite Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 515-16 (1982), for the proposition that \nexhaustion may be excused in “exceptional circumstances.” Notably, the Rose Court provided no \nguidance on what “exceptional circumstances” would justify waiving the exhaustion requirement.  \nSee Rose, 455 U.S. at 515 (“[I]t is a principle controlling all habeas corpus petitions to the federal \ncourts, that those courts will interfere with the administration of justice in the state courts only in \nrare cases where exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist.”).  \nThough not cited by Petitioners, five years after Rose, the Supreme Court clarified when \nsuch  “exceptional  circumstances”  exist.  See  Granberry  v.  Greer,  481  U.S.  129  (1987).  In \nGranberry, the Court found an “exceptional circumstance” existed when the state failed to raise \nthe petitioner’s failure to exhaust at the district court level. Notably, even there, the Court held that \nthe district court must balance the principles of comity and judicial efficiency to determine whether \nexhaustion  should  be  waived  in  such  a  unique  circumstance.  Id.  at  134.  The  Court  again \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 5 of 11    PageID 667\nemphasized, “[I]t is a principle controlling all habeas corpus petitions to the federal courts, that \nthose courts will interfere with the administration of justice in the state courts only in rare cases \nwhere exceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist.”3 Id. \nIndeed,  intrusion  into  state  proceedings  already  underway  is  warranted  only  in \n“extraordinary circumstances.” Atkins v. Michigan, 644 F.2d 543, 546 (6th Cir. 1981). In the prison \ncontext, the Supreme Court has emphasized, “It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State \nhas a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws, regulations, and \nprocedures, than the administration of its prisons.” Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 (1973). \nHere, in determining whether to release a pre-trial detainee due to COVID-19, Tennessee courts \nconsider its effects along with other factors to make an individualized assessment of a detainee’s \nflight risk and danger to society. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115. Said assessment is conducted \nby the state court which is familiar with, among other things, the seriousness of the detainee’s \ncharges, the detainee’s prior criminal record, the detainee’s family-ties, and the strength of the \nprosecution’s case. Id. Notably, this is exactly the type of assessment Petitioners propose this Court \nmake in determining which, if any, detainees should be released from the Shelby County Jail and \nif so, upon what terms they can be released.   \nUnexplainably, Petitioners stress that if this Court does not swiftly remove them from the \nShelby County Jail, they will suffer irreparable harm, yet they have not even attempted to obtain \nthe relief they seek from Tennessee state courts. If Petitioners truly believed their unproven \nassumptions that they will contract COVID-19 and then suffer significant adverse effects as a \n \n3 Other than the narrow example provided for in Granberry, the Supreme Court has provided no other examples of \n“exceptional circumstances,” by which exhaustion should be excused, and other courts have limited their definition \nof “exceptional circumstances” to only situations when “state remedies are inadequate or fail to afford a full and fair \nadjudication of federal claims, or when exhaustion in state court would be futile.” See Victor v. Hopkins, 90 F.3d 276, \n279-80 n.2 (8th Cir. 1996); Doty v. Lund, 78 F. Supp. 2d 898, 901 (N.D. Iowa 1999). \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 6 of 11    PageID 668\nresult, they would have, at minimum, attempted to obtain relief from Tennessee Courts. Notably, \nhad Petitioners filed motions in their state court proceedings seeking an elimination of their bond \ndue to the alleged violation of their constitutional rights, their motions would have likely been \nheard prior to the Court’s hearing on the Petitioners’ motion for temporary restraining order, and \ncertainly prior to the briefing deadlines set by the Court since the hearing. In light of the state law \nremedies available to Petitioners, “exceptional circumstances” do not exist to justify waiving the \nexhaustion requirement and the principles of federalism, comity, and judicial efficiency require \ndismissal of Petitioners’ petition.  \n II.  PETITIONERS HAVE NOT SUFFERED A CONSTITUTIONAL DEPRIVATION.4 \n \nIn their request for injunctive relief, Petitioners have also inappropriately attempted to \ncarve out a separate claim for unconstitutional “punishment” in addition to seeking relief from \nalleged unconstitutional “conditions of confinement” at the Jail. Notwithstanding, the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s due process clause protects pretrial detainees from cruel and unusual punishments. \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979); Richmond v. Huq, 885 F.3d 928, 938 n.3 (6th Cir. \n2018) (explaining that the Sixth Circuit has not determined whether the Kingsley v. Hendrickson \n \n4 Petitioners have likewise failed to state a colorable claim for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (“ADA”) or the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”). As a threshold matter, district courts within the Sixth Circuit have \nrecently explained that alleged violations of the ADA are “inappropriate for a habeas corpus case.” Shaholli v. \nDeangelo-Kipp, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92014, *27 (E.D. Mich. May 27, 2020) (referencing Meyers v. Hedgpeth, \n2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67198, (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2014) (“The ADA is not a federal constitutional provision or \nguarantee.”); see also Cometa v. Warden, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33630, *4 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 27, 2020) (“[T]he Court \nwill not address the merits of these [Eighth Amendment and ADA] claims because they are not proper in a habeas \npetition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.”)). Moreover, “Inmates alleging claims under the ADA and the RA must \nshow prison officials took the challenged actions because of the inmate’s alleged disability.” Finfrock v. Mohr, 2019 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 192024 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 5, 2019) (citing Clayton v. Michigan Dep’t of Corr., 2017 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 27251, **5-6 (6th Cir. Aug. 21, 2017) (explaining that “even accepting as true the inmate’s allegation that \nprison officials denied a request to transfer him to a facility with inpatient mental health treatment, he set forth no \nallegations to suggest that this denial was due to his HIV status.”)). Here, Petitioners have failed to allege sufficient \nfacts or provide substantive evidence to establish that Respondents failed to provide Petitioners with any reasonable \naccommodations – other than immediate release from Jail – or that any specific action was taken against Petitioners \nbecause of their proposed disabilities. Accordingly, Petitioners’ ADA and RA claims must fail. \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 7 of 11    PageID 669\ndecision abrogated the subjective component when evaluating the deliberate indifference claims \nof pretrial detainees); Martin v. Warren Cty., 799 F. App’x 329 (6th Cir. 2020) (determining that \na district court did not inappropriately apply the deliberate indifference standard to a pre-trial \ndetainee’s  failure  to  provide  adequate  medical  care  claim  and  confirming,  “[L]iability  for \nnegligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.”); \nCameron, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 16741 at *22 (Bush, J., dissenting) (“In a deliberate indifference \nclaim challenging the conditions of a prisoner’s confinement, the plaintiff must satisfy both the \nobjective and subjective components of the Eighth Amendment inquiry. The same requirements \napply to a pre-trial detainee’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.”). Fourteenth \nAmendment due process claims “are analyzed under the same rubric as Eighth Amendment claims \nbrought by prisoners.” Huq, 885 F.3d at 938; Villegas v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 709 F.3d 563, \n568 (6th Cir. 2013); Cooper v. Montgomery Cty., 768 F. App’x 385, 392 (6th Cir. 2019); Taylor \nv. Madison Cty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 212614, *4 n.1 (W.D. Tenn. Dec. 10, \n2019) (“Although a pretrial detainee’s claim regarding the conditions of his confinement is \nreviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, the standard is the same.”). “In \nthe context of a conditions-of-confinement claim, only extreme deprivations can be characterized \nas punishment prohibited by the Constitution.” Cox v. Gentry, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 209822, *7 \n(M.D. Tenn. Dec. 5, 2019). \nRespondents have shown that they have adhered to and trained their personnel on numerous \nrelevant policies and operating procedures, as well as continued to implement supplementary \noperational measures in compliance with CDC guidelines, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. \nRespondents have further established that said policies, protocols, and measures, as applied, meet \nthe community standard of medical care in a correctional setting, have successfully mitigated the \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 8 of 11    PageID 670\nspread of COVID-19, and have created a safe environment for detainees to reside.  \nOn the other hand, neither Petitioner has claimed, much less established with actual proof, \nto have personally contracted COVID-19 or even contacted any COVID-19 positive individuals \nwhile housed within the Jail. To that extent, Petitioners’ own expert testified that Tennessee, unlike \nthe other states referenced within his declaration, is not the site of an outbreak and that an \nindividual is not more likely to contract COVID-19 simply because he is a certain age and/or \nsuffers from an underlying medical condition. In reciting general, unsupported assertions, like \n“inmates…share sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as eating, sleeping, and living spaces,” \nPetitioners ultimately take the position that “there is no safe alternative to their confinement short \nof release.” (ECF No. 35, PageID 527, 529) (emphasis added).5 However, Respondents have \nestablished that neither Petitioner has an assigned cellmate and that all Jail detainees/inmates, \nincluding Petitioners, are supplied with masks, cleaning supplies, and adequate hygiene materials. \n  Furthermore,  Respondents  have  shown  that  they,  in  conjunction  with  other  law \nenforcement agencies and local state judicial officials, have engaged in successful efforts to reduce \nthe overall Jail population by accelerating the cases for detainees with serious medical issues, for \ndetainees of advanced age, and for detainees with pending misdemeanor or lesser felony charges. \nWhile  Tennessee  courts  already  consider  numerous  factors  in  determining  whether  pretrial \ndetainees, like Petitioners, should be released and whether and for what amount bail should be set,6 \nthe  Criminal  Court  of  Tennessee,  Thirtieth  Judicial  District  at  Memphis  has  additionally \nimplemented steps “to prevent jail overcrowding during the current health crisis…while not \n \n5 In an attempt to advance this unsupported narrative, Petitioners again rely upon the Sixth Circuit’s recent decision \nin Cameron. Notably, the Court in Cameron, clarified, “And, as yet, the district court has not ordered the release of \nany inmate. If the district court does order the release of a prisoner, that may present a different question.” Cameron, \n2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 16741 at *6. \n6 See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115(b). Courts must also adhere to the Tennessee Constitution, which provides certain \nbasic constitutional rights to the victims of crimes. See Tenn. Const. art. I § 35 \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 9 of 11    PageID 671\nendangering public safety” and policies that have “greatly reduced the jail population.” (See ECF \nNo. 35-5). \nBased upon the above, Respondents have confirmed that Petitioners cannot establish that \nRespondents were deliberately indifferent to their constitutional rights at any time.7 Nevertheless, \nPetitioners are requesting this Court to assume the role of “super-warden” and to allow Petitioners \nto completely disregard the widespread efforts taken by Shelby County, Tennessee, the Sheriff’s \nOffice, and the local state judicial officers to combat this “unprecedent pandemic.” See Swain v. \nJunior, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14301 (11th Cir. May 5, 2020). In doing so, Petitioners have \ntellingly failed to include insight concerning various practical aspects of their request for wholesale \nrelease, including but not limited to: (1) Why is this Court in a better position to evaluate the factors \noutlined within Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115(b) than the local state judicial officers, especially \nconsidering that neither Petitioner has even attempted to request relief in state court; (2) How \nshould the known answers to the factors outlined within Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115(b) be \nbalanced against the possibility of contracting COVID-19 and its unknown consequences for each \ndetainee; (3) How should more immediately dangerous charges, like aggravated domestic violence \noffenses, be evaluated prior to a detainee’s release; (4) Should the victim(s) of crimes have any \ninfluence and/or receive notification of a detainee’s potential release; (5) Should law enforcement \n \n7 Likewise, Petitioners have failed to establish that their detention bears no relation to a legitimate, non-punitive \npurpose. Edgington is being detained on two (2) Class A felony charges involving conspiracy to manufacture/ \ndeliver/sell controlled substance (cocaine) and trafficking high amounts of cocaine. Edgington is one (1) of thirty-\neight (38) individuals indicted in a trafficking case and is accused of distributing a controlled substance within a school \nzone. Edgington’s bond was set at $500,000.00. Busby is being detained on numerous criminal charges including \ninvolving manufacture/delivery/sale of a host of controlled substances and being a felon in possession of a firearm. \nBusby sustained injuries after jumping from the second-floor balcony while attempting to evade arrest for said \noffenses. Busby’s bond was set at $239,000.00 for the drug charges and $25,000.00 for the felon in possession charge. \nPetitioners have failed to provide this Court with actual evidence to warrant an overhaul of the assessment conducted \nby the local state judicial officers that resulted in Petitioners’ respective bond amounts and detainment.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 37   Filed 06/04/20   Page 10 of 11    PageID 672\ncease their efforts to arrest future violators even if said violators pose a threat to the community;8 \n(6) If law enforcement officers are allowed to continue arresting violators, should arrestees be \nbooked in the Jail prior to their ultimate release; (7) How long should arrestees remain within the \nJail before their release; (8) What Court should make the determination(s) concerning future \ndetainee release; (9) Should law enforcement officials be prohibited from arresting any detainee \nthat was previously released if s/he commits a subsequent offense; and (10) What Court or official \nshould maintain the authority to permit the Jail to resume “normal” activities and when should said \nprocesses resume.9 \nCONCLUSION \n  Based upon the above and upon the record as a whole, this Court should grant Respondents’ \nMotion to Dismiss in its entirety, should deny Petitioners’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder, and should deny Petitioners’ Motion for Class Certification. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \n      By:   s/Nathan D.

Since 2006, Shelby County has contracted with WellPath (formerly Correct Care Solutions) to \nprovide inmate medical care at its corrections facilities, including the Shelby County Jail. \nWellPath personnel are not employees of the SCSO. \n16. The contract with WellPath is administered by the Shelby County Health Department.  The \nShelby County Health Department assigns full-time on on-site contract monitors at the Shelby \nCounty Jail to  ensure WellPath meets it contractual obligations and provides appropriate \ninmate medical  care.  Per the contract, the Director of Nursing for WellPath oversees all \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 6 of 98    PageID 372\nmedical care for SCSO facilities and reports directly to the Shelby County Health Department. \nCurrently, WellPath employs 3 medical doctors, 1 psychiatrist, 3 psychologists, 1 dentist, 2 \nnurse practitioners, 18 registered nurses, and 35 licensed practice nurses who provide medical \ncare to incarcerated detainees in SCSO facilities. \nSCSO's Response to COVID-19 \n17. In February of 2020, the SCSO began planning and in March of 2020, the SCSO began \nimplementing procedures in  addition to  its standard operating procedures to  combat and \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities, including the Shelby County Jail.  Since then, \nthese additional procedures have evolved on an ongoing basis. \n18. The SCSO has enhanced its pre-booking screening process for all of its facilities, including the \nShelby County Jail.  Pursuant to the enhanced screening process, no detainee is allowed inside \na SCSO facility without first being questioned and screened by a nurse. As part of the enhanced \nscreening process, the nurse evaluates the detainee and the detainee's body temperature is \ntaken before the detainee is allowed into the facility. If the new arrestee exhibits signs of a \nfever or other COVID-19 symptoms, he must undergo further testing before being admitted \ninto the facility. \n19. Upon entrance of a positive/possible COVID-19 positive detainee, all movement in the intake \narea must cease.  If after testing the inmate, it is determined that he is positive for COVID-19, \nthe inmate must proceed to a separate tent in the Sally-Port for isolation. The tent is staffed \nwith one or more jail staf£  All staff in the tent must wear a hazmat suit, gloves, and mask \nbefore entering the tent.  Officers in the tent then undertake initial intake/processing of the \nCOVID-19 positive inmate, ensuring that the inmate remains isolated from all other staff and \ndetainees.  Medical staff must also make a determination as to whether the inmate should be \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 98    PageID 373\nhospitalized. If medical staff determine the inmate should not be hospitalized, upon completion \nof the booking process, the inmate is escorted by staff to an isolation cell away from any other \ninmates or staff members. Contact between any known COVID-19 positive detainee and other \ninmates is strictly prohibited. When leaving the Processing staff must take off the Hazmat suit, \ngloves and mask that was used to process the inmate to the items can be properly disposed of. \n20. Upon intake, all inmates are immediately provided a facial  mask free  of charge and are \ninstructed to wear the mask while in the facility.  Upon intake, inmates are also instructed on \ngeneral CDC guidelines concerning social distancing and other best practices to prevent the \nspread ofCOVID-19. \n21. Any inmates who test positive for COVID-19 are immediately isolated from all other detainees \nand housed in a medical cell. Other inmates exposed to an inmate who tests positive for \nCOVID-19 are also immediately quarantined.  Inmates remain in isolation for at least 21-days, \nif not longer, depending upon their symptoms and whether they continue to test positive for \nCOVID-19. \n22. To reinforce the exercise of best practices to prevent and/or mitigate the spread of COVID-19, \nCDC guidance posters are posted throughout the Shelby County Jail for inmates to familiarize \nthemselves with. A copy of the guidance poster posted throughout the Shelby County Jail is \nattached as Exhibit B. These posters provide inmates guidance on best practices to mitigate the \nspread ofCOVID-19.  Additionally, two times a day, the SCSO televises an informative video \non  all  televisions  throughout  the  jail  which  similarly  provide  inmates  information  on \npreventing and mitigating the spread ofCOVID-19.  Televisions are located throughout all of \nthe pods in the Shelby County Jail. \n23. To further combat COVID-19, the SCSO has also limited movement throughout the jail and \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 8 of 98    PageID 374\nprohibited group gatherings. For example, inmates must generally remain in their own housing \nunit at all times and cannot generally traverse to and from different areas of the jail. \n24. The SCSO has also taken steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by or through its staff. The \nSCSO has directed its employees to comply with all CDC guidelines concerning combating \nand preventing COVID-19, including directing staff to practice social distancing by remaining \n6 feet apart from other people at all possible times and to wash and sanitize their hands \nregularly.  The SCSO strictly prohibits any staff members exhibiting symptoms ofCOVID-19 \nfrom coming to work or entering the facility. The SCSO has furthermore strongly discouraged \nemployees from nonessential and personal travel and has set a moratorium on all vacation \nrequests  and  approvals  for  out-of-town  travel  purposes  until  at  least  May  31,  2020. \nAdditionally, since March 16, 2020, SCSO employees have only been allowed to access the \nfaqility through the main entrance of the jail and are no longer allowed to enter the facility \nthrough the annex door.  All employees must undergo a medical screening every day prior to \nentering the facility.  If an employee exhibits any COVID-19 symptoms, they are prohibited \nfrom entering the facility.  SCSO has also restricted access in and out of the facility to all \nemployees except for member of management with the Jail Division. \n25. The SCSO has taken further steps to prohibit non-SCSO employees from entering the Shelby \nCounty Jail.  Since March 27, 2020, the SCSO has suspended all in-person visitations.  Since \nthen, no in-person visitations have been allowed in the Shelby County Jail.  Likewise, jail \nvolunteers are no longer allowed access and attorneys who wish to visit with their clients in \nthe Shelby County Jail must do so via phone, teleconference, or video conference.  The SCSO \nhas also suspended all non-essential vendors from coming into the jail except in emergency \nsituations and has limited commissary deliveries to only one day per week. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 9 of 98    PageID 375\n26. The SCSO requires all individuals in the Shelby County Jail, including employees and inmates, \nto wear a facial mask at all times.  Any staff who fail to follow said directive are subject to \ndisciplinary action and anyone who is not an employee who refuses to wear a facial mask is \ndenied entry into the facility. Jail staff who observe an inmate not properly wearing a mask, \nimmediately instruct the inmate to put his facial mask on. \n27. Per the general operating policies and procedures, all inmates have access to medical care and \ncan request medical care at any time.  In light of COVID-19, inmates are not charged for \nmedical  examination if they raise  concerns that  they  are  suffering  from  COVID-related \nsymptoms. \n28. In  further  efforts  to  combat  and prevent the  spread  of COVID-19,  the  SCSO  has  also \nimplemented more aggressive cleaning of the entire jail facility. On a daily basis, officers \ndisinfect every surface throughout the jail with BioVex. The walking tunnel from the jail to \nthe courtrooms are also thoroughly cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis.  Additionally, \ncleaning supplies are provided for inmates to utilize prior to the use of phones, kiosks, and \nshowers.  All inmate facial masks are disinfected with BioV  ex every day immediately after \nlockdown, and at least once a week, the masks are also thoroughly washed by laundry staff. \n29. The SCSO provides all inmates access to hand soap and other hygiene products free of charge. \nAn inmate may ask any jail officer for more soap or hygiene products at any time, and it is \nimmediately provided to the inmate. \n30. The Shelby County Jail also provides inmates access to disposable gloves in further effort to \nprevent the spread ofCOVID-19. \n31. If there is reason to believe a group of detainees in a pod might have been exposed to COVID-\n19, the Shelby County Jail will place entire pod on quarantine.  Inmates in a quarantined pod \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 10 of 98    PageID 376\ncannot leave the pod or traverse through other areas of the facility.  Medical staff at the jail \nregularly monitor and take the bodily temperatures of all such quarantined detainees multiple \ntimes a day.  Quarantined pods remain on quarantine for a minimum of 14 days and until \nmedical staff determine that is reasonably safe to take the pod off of quarantine. \n32. In implementing procedures to combat and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the MCSO has \nworked closely with its medical contract partner, WellPath, as well as the Shelby County \nHealth Department.  The senior leadership in the SCSO, Shelby County Health Department, \nand WellPath meet two times per week to obtain updates concerning the COVID-19 pandemic \nas it relates specifically to the SCSO's correctional facilities and to discuss what further steps, \nif any, the SCSO can take to prevent the spread ofCOVID-19. In addition to the procedures \nimplemented as set forth in this declaration, the SCSO has also implemented and follows \nspecific guidelines and procedures recommended by WellPath, to assist in preparing for spread \nand mitigation ofCOVID-19 in the facility.  A copy of those procedures is attached as Exhibit \nc. \nEfforts to Reduce Jail Population \n33. The maximum capacity of the Shelby County Jail is 2,800. \n34. The SCSO detains criminal defendants as ordered by Tennessee Criminal and General Sessions \nJudges. Thus, the SCSO cannot control the total number of detainees who are housed in the \nShelby County Jail. \n35. Notwithstanding, the SCSO has worked with the local district attorneys' office and the local \npublic defender's office to lower the jail population. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, \nSheriff Bonner hired Mischelle Best to serve as the SCSO's Expeditor.  In her position as \nExpeditor, Ms. Best works with inmates, prosecutors, public defenders, and other outside \nservices to identify detainees with minor charges and to expedite having their cases heard \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 11 of 98    PageID 377\nand/or resolved.  Daily,  she focuses on people with minor charges as well as people with \nmedical issues who would be better served outside of a Jail setting and works towards having \nsaid individuals' cases heard/resolved quickly. \n36. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the SCSO has increased its efforts to reduce the jail \npopulation. During the pandemic, the SCSO has coordinated with law enforcement agencies \nand requested that,  in light of COVID-19, they issue misdemeanor summonses instead of \nmaking physical arrests, when possible. The SCSO has received tremendous cooperation from \nthose  agencies  in  acquiescing  with  said  request.  Additionally,  the  SCSO,  the  District \nAttorney's Office, the Public Defender's Office and other agencies, have worked together in \naccelerating the cases for detainees with serious medical issues, that are 60 years and older, \nthose with misdemeanor or Level D & E felonies in an effort to get those detainees out ofj ail \nquickly.  The local District Attorney General has aggressively worked towards bringing those \ncriminal cases to a resolution to obtain the release of even more detainees. \n37. As a result of the SCSO's and other agencies' efforts, the jail population in the Shelby County \nJail has significantly declined since the initial COVID-19 outbreak.  On January 1, 2020, the \npopulation at the Shelby County Jail was over 2,500.  On Aprill, 2020, the population of the \nShelby County Jail was 2095.  As of today, the population at the Shelby County Jail has \ndecreased to 1877. \nCurrent COVID-19 Statistics \n38.  Since March, one hundred sixty (160) inmates at the Shelby County Jail have tested positive \nfor COVID-19. One hundred fifty-four (154) of those inmates have fully recovered. \n39. The Shelby County Jail currently has only four (4) detainees who are medically isolated from \nall other detainees while they recover from the virus.  None of those four (4) detainees require \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 12 of 98    PageID 378\nhospitalization. \n40. There are no known COVID-19 positive cases at the Jail East facility or Juvenile Court \nDetention Center. \nStatus of Favian Busbv and Michael Edgington \n41. I am familiar with both Favian Busby and Michael Edgington, their current statuses in the \nShelby County Jail, and their current cell assignments.  I have reviewed both of their inmate \nfiles. \n42. Edgington is being detained on two  (2)  Class A felony  charges involving conspiracy to \nmanufacture/deliver/sell  controlled  substance  (cocaine)  and  trafficking  high  amounts  of \ncocaine. Due to his higher classification, which is based upon a host of factors, including but \nnot limited to his pending charges, Edgington is currently housed on the third floor of the \nfacility.  Edgington's assigned pod has the capacity to  house forty-three (43) individuals. \nThirty-eight (38) individuals are currently housed in said pod. No individual housed within \nEdgington's assigned pod has tested positive for COVID-19. Edgington does not have an \nassigned cell mate currently. Laundry services are available to the individuals assigned within \nEdgington's assigned pod at least two (2) times per week. \n43. Busby is being detained on numerous criminal charges involving manufacture/delivery/sale of \ncocaine, ecstasy, methamphetamine, oxycodone, alprazolarn, marijuana, and other controlled \nsubstances and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Due to his classification, which is \nbased upon a host of factors,  including but not limited to  his pending charges, Busby is \ncurrently assigned to a pod in the Jail Annex. Busby's assigned pod has the capacity to house \nsixty-two (62) individuals. Forty-one (41) individuals are currently housed in said pod. Busby \nis assigned to a single-man cell, and thus, Busby does not have an assigned cell mate. Busby \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 13 of 98    PageID 379\nhas access to a washer, dryer, and gym within his pod, and thus, he is capable of laundering \nhis personal items at his discretion. Busby has been offered a COVID-19 test, but Busby \nrefused the test. \nCertification and Accreditation of the Jail \n44. At  all  times  relevant the  Shelby  County  Jail  maintained  certification by  the  Tennessee \nCorrections Institute and maintained accreditation by the American Correctional Association \nand the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. \nEND OF STATEMENT. \nREMAINDER OF PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 14 of 98    PageID 380\nI declare under pena]ty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nc9 (, \nExecuted this the  day of May, 2020. \n~~········ \nKiRK FIELDS, ChiefJ ailer \nShelby County Sheriffs Office \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 15 of 98    PageID 381\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT \n“A” \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 27-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 16 of 98    PageID 382\nRE:  INMATE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTHCARE \nPOLICY tl 838  EFFECTIVE DATE:  09-02.01 \nSUPERCEDE$:  NEXT ANNUAL REVIEW DUE: 8-2020 \nDISTRIBUTION:  ALL PERSONNEL  REVISED:  10-20·04,11·18·05,12-30·10,12-13-11, \n09-20-12,02-18-14,06-02-17,10-02-18,09-24-19 \nEFERENCES: CALEA:  - CROSS REFERENCE: \nEFERENCES:  ACA: 4-ALDF-4C.03, 04, 13, 14, 20, 22,  Correct Care Solution Polic:Jt: J-A-04 \n4, 26, 40, 4D.01, 08, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 6A-09, 7D-25,  Jail SOP #847 Intake Processing, #603 Disposal of \n6, JDF-03, 11, 21, 21·1, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27,33-1, 32, 37,  Solid, Liquid and Toxic Waste. \n42,47,48 \n-\nBulletin:  Forms:  838.10 Inmate Health Service Request Form \n838.00  POLICY AND PURPOSE \nA.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  Plaintiffs originally initiated this case against Defendants as a class action, “challenging \nthe constitutionality and legality of Plaintiffs’ continued detention [in the Shelby County Jail (“the \nJail”)] in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.” (“Consent Decree,” ECF No. 161-2, PageID 3204.) \nIn response to Plaintiffs’ allegations, Defendants denied they violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional or \nstatutory rights. To the contrary, Defendants asserted that they implemented numerous practices \nand procedures to appropriately combat and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the Jail and that \nPlaintiffs’ detention was therefore, lawful. (ECF No 27; ECF No. 161, PageID 3185.) \nFrom the outset of the case, the parties engaged in extensive written and oral discovery. \nNonetheless,  at  the  time  the  parties  entered  into  mediation  in  mid-December,  2020,  much \ndiscovery remained to be undertaken. In an effort to avoid the “burden, expense, and disruption” \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 2 of 15    PageID 3719\nof such “protracted litigation,” the parties reached a resolution of the case after participating in \nthree days of mediation. (ECF No. 161-2, PageID 3204.) Specifically, the parties agreed to the \nentry of a Consent Decree (“the Decree”). (Id.)  \nThe Court preliminarily approved the Decree on January 28, 2021. (ECF No. 162.) On \nMarch 5, 2021, the Court held a hearing on the parties’ motion to approve the class settlement. \nDuring the hearing, the Court voiced concerns over whether notice had been sufficiently provided \nthe class members. (ECF No. 181.) In light of those concerns, the Court ordered a one-page notice \nbe distributed to each individual detainee in the Jail. (ECF No. 177.) The parties subsequently \nsubmitted a revised one-page notice which the Court approved on March 15, 2021. (ECF No. 181.) \nThe Jail then distributed the one-page notice to all detainees in the Jail in accordance with the \nCourt’s March 15, 2021, Order.  \nOn April 9, 2021, the Court held a final approval hearing, found notice had been properly \nafforded the class and sub-class members, and approved the settlement. (ECF No. 209.) The Court \nnoted that it had received “approximately 70 letters from detainees following distribution of the \nOne-Page Notice,” but that none of the objections demonstrated that the settlement was “unfair, \nunreasonable, or inadequate.” (Id.)   \nII.  CONSENT DECREE  \nTo ensure the Decree’s compliance with federal law, the parties specifically noted within \nthe Decree itself that it complied with 18 U.C.S. § 3626(a)(1)(A), which provides: \nProspective relief in any civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend \nno further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular \nplaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief \nunless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than \nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive \nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give \nsubstantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a \ncriminal justice system caused by the relief. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 3 of 15    PageID 3720\n \n(ECF No. 161-2, ¶ 31, PageID 3211; 18 U.C.S. § 3626(a)(1)(A).) Accordingly, the provisions in \nthe Decree were “narrowly drawn” to protect the alleged federal rights violations raised by \nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit. Indeed, any reading of the Decree that would extend the protections \ngranted beyond those necessary to correct the alleged violations of Plaintiffs’ federal rights would \neffectively violate 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).  \nWhen  addressing  alleged  constitutional  deprivations  wherein  plaintiff-inmates  have \nrefused to accept medical care, courts have explained that “the consequences of voluntary conduct” \nnegates a constitutional claim. Musterd v. R.I. Dep’t of Health, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 198422, \n*12 (D.R.I. Aug. 29, 2017) (citing Legate v. Livingston, 822 F.3d 207, 210 (5th Cir. 2016) \n(“[C]ircuits that have addressed the issue have held that a prisoner cannot establish a violation \nwhere he willingly participates in the conduct giving rise to his injury.”). Indeed, it is well-settled \nthat there can be no constitutional deprivation wherein plaintiff-inmates have refused to accept \nmedical care. See Palmer v. Wagner, 3 F. App’x 329, 331 (6th Cir. 2001); see also Meeks v. \nSkipper, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158963, at *24 (W.D. Mich. July 30, 2020).  \nAccordingly, in entering into the Consent Decree, the parties understood that by being \noffered a COVID-19 vaccine, a detainee could no longer assert that his constitutional or other \nstatutory rights were being violated due to being incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In \nsuch an event, any danger posed to him by COVID-19 could be eliminated by his own, personal \nchoice to accept a vaccine. Since the parties entered into the Consent Decree, numerous district \ncourts have confirmed that an inmate-plaintiff cannot sustain a claim seeking release due to \ndangers created by COVID-19 if jail officials have offered him a vaccine. See e.g., United States \nv. Cesario, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102122, *4 (D. Minn. June 1, 2021) (noting, “Courts have \nfound that a risk of serious complications from COVID‐19 is not extraordinary and compelling \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 4 of 15    PageID 3721\nwhen experienced by a vaccinated inmate.”); Harp v. Nagy, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93710, at *22 \n(E.D. Mich. May 18, 2021) (denying a petition for habeas corpus because the prison had begun \noffering COVID-19 vaccines, thus negating the suggestion that the plaintiff was at risk of harm.); \nUnited States v. Jackson, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39807, at *4 (D. Minn. Mar. 3, 2021) (“While \n[an  inmate]  is  within  his  rights  to  refuse  any  treatment  he  wishes  to  forego,  he  cannot \nsimultaneously claim that he must be released because of the risk of complications while refusing \na vaccine that could virtually eliminate that risk.”).  \nImportantly, the question concerning whether a detainee’s constitutional rights are being \nviolated does not turn on whether other detainees accept a COVID-19 vaccination. Though \nPlaintiffs brought this case as a class action, whether a detainee’s constitutional rights are being \nviolated is an individualized inquiry. See e.g., Robertson v. Lucas, 753 F.3d 606, 615 (6th Cir. \n2014). In light of such understanding and in an effort to ensure compliance with 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(1)(A), the parties agreed that the Decree should terminate once detainees were provided \naccess to a COVID-19 vaccine, whether or not they accepted one. Specifically, Paragraph 28 of \nthe Decree states: \nThis Decree will terminate upon the earliest of either (a) a declaration by the CDC \nTennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and/or has \nended, or (b) an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine is offered to and administered \naccording to FDA guidelines to all detainees housed at the Jail for a period of more \nthan fourteen (14) days and who accept a vaccination, along with educational \nmaterials about the vaccine and non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine. Upon \ntermination of this Decree pursuant to this Paragraph, the parties shall inform the \nCourt and the Court shall enter a final judgment of dismissal. \n \n(ECF No. 161-2, PageID 3210, ¶ 28.) Notably, the Decree does not specify a particular kind of \neducational materials or non-punitive incentives that must be offered to detainees, nor does it \nrequire a specific number of detainees accept a vaccine to trigger termination. Such prerequisites \nwould extend protections to Plaintiffs beyond those necessary to correct the alleged violations of \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 5 of 15    PageID 3722\ntheir federal rights and would, therefore, violate 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). As set forth above, \nonce a vaccine is offered to detainee, he can no longer assert his rights are being violated due to \nhis own choice to refuse vaccination. \nAs set forth by Paragraph 28 of the Decree, in the event that the Decree terminates, the \nparties “shall inform the Court and the Court shall enter a final judgment of dismissal.” (Id.)1 \nIII.  GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION \n  Because Defendants have satisfied the provisions of Paragraph 28(b) of the Decree, the \nDecree should be terminated. \n  A.  The Jail has offered and administered and will continue to offer and    \n    administer a COVID-19 vaccine to detainees.  \n \n  To date, every detainee who has been housed at the Jail for longer than fourteen days that \nhas requested a COVID-19 vaccine has been provided a COVID-19 vaccine2 in compliance with \n \n1 Counsel for Defendants previously provided Plaintiffs’ counsel information concerning the vaccine program \nimplemented at the Jail and informed Plaintiffs’ counsel of Defendants’ position that the Decree has terminated. \nCounsel for Defendants have continued to provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with additional information concerning the \nevolution of the Jail’s vaccine program in an effort to reach an agreement concerning termination.  Instead of agreeing \nto inform the Court of the Decree’s termination as contemplated by the Decree, Plaintiffs moved to modify the \ntermination provision of the Decree. (ECF No. 216-1.)  \n2 Within a footnote of their recently-filed Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce and Modify \nthe Consent Decree (ECF No. 216-2, n. 7.), Plaintiffs appear to attempt to avoid termination based upon the COVID-\n19 vaccines provided by the Jail “[s]trickly speaking,” not being “FDA-approved.” As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel has never mentioned, raised, or even referenced any such issue during any of the numerous communications \nbetween the parties at any time. Moreover, when discussing the reason(s) that Plaintiffs’ counsel did not agree with \ntermination during the meet and confer on April 16, 2021, Plaintiffs’ counsel only expressed concern with the \nadministration of the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) being provided, as said vaccine required two (2) \ndoses and as the detainees had only received their first dose as of that date. Additionally, when discussing the reason(s) \nthat Plaintiffs’ counsel did not agree with termination during a subsequent meet and confer on May 6, 2021, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel only expressed concern with the educational materials about the vaccine and the non-punitive incentives to \ntake the vaccine being provided to detainees within the Jail. Furthermore, courts have recognized that the Pfizer-\nBioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the vaccine that was administered initially within the Jail, and the Johnson & \nJohnson/Jansen COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccine that is currently being administered within the Jail, have both been \napproved for use by the FDA. See Williams v. Rodriguez, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96443, *21 (D. Conn May 21, 2021) \n(“At the time of this decision, much more is known about the virus, PPE and testing is both widely available and used, \nand highly effective COVID-19 vaccines have been FDA approved for approximately six months.”); see also Wyckoff \nv. Warden, Belmont Corr. Inst., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45410, *1 (S.D. Ohio March 11, 2021) (“[I]t is well-settled \nthat federal courts may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts of record.”) (citing United States v. Mont, \n723 Fed. Appx. 325, 327 n.3 (6th Cir. 2018)). Any attempt to now “strictly” interpret the Decree’s termination \nprovision to require that the Jail provide a COVID-19 vaccine that has fully undergone the FDA’s formal approval \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 6 of 15    PageID 3723\nFood and Drug Administration (“FDA”) guidelines.3 (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 30.)  \n  Specifically, in mid-April of 2021, the SCSO, in coordination with Wellpath, implemented \na COVID-19 vaccine program whereby all detainees who desire a COVID-19 vaccine are provided \na COVID-19 vaccine in accordance with FDA guidelines, all detainees are provided educational \nmaterials concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, and all detainees are informed of and provided non-\npunitive incentives after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 5.) The Jail’s vaccine \nprogram has continuously evolved since its inception. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 5.) \n  In order to offer the vaccine to each and every detainee in the Jail, during the weeks of \nApril 3, 2021, and April 10, 2021, Jail personnel personally asked each detainee housed in the Jail \nabout whether he desired to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 6.) Specifically, the \nJail provided every detainee a “Shelby County Sheriff’s Office Inmate COVID 19 Testing \nAcknowledgement Form,” whereby each detainee could indicate whether he did or did not want \nto receive a COVID-19 vaccine along with a vaccine announcement. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 6.) \nAdditionally, during the weeks of April 3, 2021, and April 10, 2021, the Jail provided all detainees \naccess to educational materials concerning the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. \n \nprocess is nonsensical and such a reading would result in the Decree violating 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) as outlined \nabove. \n3 All currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. See e.g., CDC, Understanding \nHow  COVID-19  Vaccines  Work  (updated  May  27,  2021)  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html. Further, everyone 12 years of age and older is eligible to get a \nCOVID-19  vaccination.  See  e.g.,  CDC,  Your  COVID-19  Vaccination,  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/vaccines/your-vaccination.html. Per the CDC, once an individual is fully vaccinated, he can “resume activities” \nthat he “did prior to the pandemic.” Id. The first COVID-19 vaccine approved by the FDA for emergency use \nauthorization was the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which was approved December 11, 2020. See Pfizer \nBioNTech  COVIDF-19  Vaccine,  FDA.Gov,  available  at:  https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-\nresponse/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine (last visited May 12, 2021). One week \nlater  to  Moderna  COVID-19  vaccine  was  approved;  Modern  COVID-19  Vaccine,  FDA.Gov,  available  at: \nhttps://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/moderna-covid-19-\nvaccine (last visited May 12, 2021); and then the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, commonly referred to as the Johnson \n& Johnson Vaccine, became available February 27, 2021. Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, FDA.Gov, available at: \nhttps://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/janssen-covid-19-\nvaccine (last visited May 12, 2021). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 7 of 15    PageID 3724\nof Fields, ¶ 6.)  The Jail and WellPath then scheduled those detainees who wished to receive a \nCOVID-19 vaccine, to receive a vaccine on April 15, 2021. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 6.) \n  Since the week of April 10, 2021, all new detainees have been, and moving forward, all \nnew detainees will continue to be, asked at booking if they have been fully vaccinated. (Dec. of \nFields, ¶ 7.) If a new detainee has not been fully vaccinated, he is asked whether he wishes to be \nvaccinated. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 7.) Medical staff schedule any new detainee who expresses a desire \nto be vaccinated for vaccination. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 7.) Said vaccination is scheduled and provided \nas soon as possible and never beyond fourteen (14) days of the detainee’s entry into the Jail. \n(Dec. of Fields, ¶ 7.) \n  Any detainee who initially declines the vaccine, but subsequently desires to become \nvaccinated, is permitted to request the vaccine via a sick call request. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 8.) Upon \nsuch a request, Wellpath will schedule the detainee to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of \nFields, ¶ 8.)  If the vaccine administered to a specific detainee requires two doses, the second \ndose will be scheduled for the detainee immediately upon him receiving the first dose. (Dec. of \nFields, ¶ 8.) If a detainee is released from the Jail prior to receiving the second dose, vaccine \ncards and second dose information are placed in the detainee’s property, which will be provided \nto them upon their release and will allow them to receive the second dose from an outside \nmedical provider. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 8.) \n  Detainees are not charged for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 9.) \nLikewise,  detainees  are  not  charged  for  any  necessary  follow-up  medical  care  related  to \nreceiving the COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 9.) \n  Originally, the Jail intended to offer the Johnson & Johnson/Jansen COVID-19 vaccine \nto detainees who accepted a vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 20.) However, on April 13, 2021, two (2) \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 8 of 15    PageID 3725\ndays prior to the first scheduled administration of COVID-19 vaccines with the Jail, the FDA \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) issued an immediate pause on \nadministering said vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 20.) Accordingly, prior to the first administration \nof COVID-19 vaccines, the Jail transitioned to utilizing the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, \nwhich requires an individual to receive two separate shots at least twenty-one (21) days apart. \n(Dec. of Fields, ¶ 20.) \n  In accordance with the above vaccine program, on April 15, 2021, Wellpath administered \nthe first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine to all detainees that indicated they desired \na COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 21.) On that date, a total of 190 detainees received their \nfirst dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 21.) \n  Since that time, the Jail has continued to offer COVID-19 vaccines to all detainees housed \nin the Jail, and the Jail has continued to coordinate the administration of COVID-19 vaccines to \nall detainees who desire to be vaccinated. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 22.) On April 22, 2021, eighteen (18) \ndetainees who wished to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were provided their first dose of the Pfizer-\nBioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 23.) All of said detainees were provided fresh fruit \nafter accepting the vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 23.) On April 29, 2021, twenty-one (21) detainees \nwho wished to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were provided their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech \nCovid-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 24.) All of said detainees were provided fresh fruit after \naccepting the vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 24.) \n  On May 10, 2021, all detainees who received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-\n19 vaccine on April 15, 2021, and who remained incarcerated in the Jail, received their second \ndose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 25.) Additionally, on May 10, \n2021, eleven (11) detainees who wished to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were provided the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 9 of 15    PageID 3726\nJohnson & Johnson/Jansen COVID-19 vaccine.4 (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 27.) All of said detainees were \nprovided fresh fruit after accepting the vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶¶ 25, 27.) \n  On May 20, 2021, all detainees who received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-\n19 vaccine on April 22, 2021, or on April 29, 2021, and who remained incarcerated in the Jail \nreceived their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 28.) \nAdditionally, on May 20, 2021, eleven (11) detainees who wished to receive a COVID-19 vaccine \nwere provided the Johnson & Johnson/Jansen COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 28.) All of \nsaid detainees were provided fresh fruit after accepting the vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 28.) \n  The Jail will continue to offer and coordinate the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in \ncompliance with FDA guidelines. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 29.) To date, every detainee who has been \nhoused at the Jail for longer than fourteen days that has requested a COVID-19 vaccine has been \nprovided a COVID-19 vaccine in compliance with FDA guidelines. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 30.) \n  B.  The Jail has provided and will continue to provide educational materials  \n    concerning the COVID-19 vaccine to detainees.  \n \n  In its endeavors to administer as many vaccines to detainees as possible, the Jail has \nprovided and will continue to provide all detainees access to a variety of educational materials \nwhich supply detainees with information about the COVID-19 vaccine, including its benefits. \n(Dec. of Fields, ¶ 10.) For example, on April 26, 2021, and on April 27, 2021, the Jail provided \neach and every detainee educational materials explaining the benefits of COVID-19 that were \noriginally provided to the SCSO by the Independent Inspector, Mike Brady. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ \n10.) Specifically, the Jail provided all detainees a copy of materials concerning the COVID-19 \nvaccine produced by Amend, a public health-focused program from the University of California, \n \n4 On April 23, 2021, the FDA and CDC approved resuming the use of the Johnson & Johnson/Jansen COVID-19 \nvaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 26.) \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 10 of 15    PageID\n3727\nSan Francisco. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 10.) The Jail has also posted the Amend educational materials \nin all housing units, and additional copies of the Amend educational materials are available to \ndetainees at guard stations at each of the housing units upon request. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 10.) No \ndetainee has been or will be prohibited from viewing any posted educational materials. (Dec. of \nFields, ¶ 10.) Additionally, since April 27, 2021, all new detainees have been provided a copy of \nthe Amend educational materials upon their entry into the Jail. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 10.) \n  To further educate the detainees about the benefits of accepting a COVID-19 vaccine, \nthe Jail began displaying a video informing detainees generally about COVID-19 within each of \nthe housing units. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 11.) The Jail will continue to display said video within each \nof the housing units at least twice a day. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 11.) Additionally, on May 12, 2021, \nthe Jail began to display within each of the housing units, at least twice a day, a video featuring \nPresident Barack Obama, Shaquille O’Neal, and Charles Barkley encouraging individuals to \naccept a COVID-19 Vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 12.) The Jail will continue to display said video \nwithin each of the housing units at least twice a day. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 12.) \n  On May 17, 2021, the Jail began utilizing regular “town hall” meetings held within the \nJail’s housing units as means to further educate detainees about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine \nand to encourage detainees to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 13.) During these \nmeetings, medical personnel inform detainees about the COVID-19 vaccine as well as the \nimportance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 13.) The attending medical \npersonnel also remain available to answer any questions posed by the detainees concerning the \nCOVID-19 vaccine, its effects, and its benefits. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 13.) The Jail will continue to \nutilize these “town hall” meetings on weekly basis moving forward to continue to educate \ndetainees on the COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 13.) \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 11 of 15    PageID\n3728\n  Anytime a detainee wishes to file a sick call request, commissary request, other inmate \nrequest, and/or a grievance, he must do so through an electronic kiosk. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 14.) \nKiosks are available in each of the housing units. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 14.) On May 21, 2021, the \nJail  uploaded  a  prompt  to  the  kiosks  throughout  the  Jail  that  provides  detainees  further \neducational information concerning COVID-19 vaccines and encourages detainees to accept a \nCOVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 14.) In order to proceed with making any type of \nrequest/filing on a kiosk, detainees now must first sign an acknowledgment that they viewed the \ninformation contained within the prompt on the kiosk. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 14.) \n  In addition to pre-vaccine educational materials, the Jail is also providing detainees who \nreceive  the  vaccination,  post-vaccination  educational  materials.  (Dec.  of  Fields,  ¶  15.)All \ndetainees that have accepted a COVID-19 vaccine have been provided a copy of said post-\nvaccination educational materials. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 15.) \n  C.  The Jail has offered and will continue to offer non-punitive incentives to  \n    detainees who accept the COVID-19 vaccine. \n \n  To encourage detainees to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, the Jail is offering and will \ncontinue to offer detainees non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 16.) On \nApril 26, 2021, and on April 27, 2021, the Jail provided each and every detainee a Vaccine \nAnnouncement. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 16.) As noted within the Vaccine Announcement, no punitive \naction has been or will be taken based upon a detainee’s request to receive a vaccine, a detainee’s \nhousing unit will not be changed based upon vaccination, all detainees who accept a COVID-19 \nvaccine will receive fresh fruit on the day of or on the day following their vaccination, and all \ndetainees will be provided free access to follow-up medical care if they suffer discomfort \nresulting from their COVID-19 vaccination. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 16.) The Jail has also posted the \nVaccine Announcement in all housing units and further copies of the Vaccine Announcement \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 12 of 15    PageID\n3729\nare available to detainees at guard stations at each of the housing units upon request. (Dec. of \nFields, ¶ 16.) No detainee has been or will be prohibited from viewing the posted Vaccine \nAnnouncement. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 16.) Additionally, since May 21, 2021, all new detainees have \nbeen provided a copy of the Vaccine Announcement upon their entry into the Jail. (Dec. of Fields, \n¶ 16.) \n  In May of 2021, the City of Memphis initiated “Shot for Shot” sweepstakes whereby \nShelby County residents who receive a COVID-19 vaccine prior to May 31, 2021, become \neligible to enter the sweepstakes. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 17.) The grand prize is a new Chevrolet \nCamaro, Chevrolet Colorado, Nissan Rogue, Nissan Altima, or any other vehicle of equal value. \n(Dec. of Fields, ¶ 17.) On May 21, 2021, in effort to provide further incentive to detainees at the \nJail to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, the Jail informed all detainees of the sweepstakes via \nannouncements as well as postings throughout the Jail. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 17.) To date, all eligible \ndetainees are entered into the sweepstakes, and the Jail will allow any future detainees who are \neligible to enter the sweepstakes as well. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 17.) \n  The Jail is also providing monetary incentive to detainees to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. \n(Dec. of Fields, ¶ 18.) From June 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021, the Jail is offering each detainee \nwho accepts a COVID-19 vaccine twenty dollars ($20.00). (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 18.) The funds will \nbe placed in each detainee’s commissary account shortly after he receives a COVID-19 vaccine. \n(Dec. of Fields, ¶ 18.) On May 26, 2021, the Jail informed all detainees that they would receive \n$20.00 in their commissary account upon accepting a COVID-19 vaccine via an announcement \nuploaded to the kiosks and posted in each of the housing units. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 18.) The Jail will \nalso retroactively provide each detainee who received a COVID-19 vaccine prior to June 1, 2021, \nand who is still housed in the Jail, twenty dollars ($20.00) in his commissary account. (Dec. of \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 13 of 15    PageID\n3730\nFields, ¶ 18.) The Jail will visibly award the $20.00 credit via paper certificates during a pod’s \nrecreation time to incentivize other detainees to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ \n18.) \n  Furthermore, detainees who suffer post-vaccine discomfort can gain access to any needed \nmedical care via sick call requests and/or by directly engaging with nurses, who enter each \nhousing unit at least one (1) to two (2) times per day. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 19.) Additionally, for a \nperiod of forty-eight (48) hours after detainees receive a vaccine, during their daily housing unit \nvisits, nurses follow-up with each detainee who received a vaccine in-person and inquire whether \nthe detainee is suffering any discomfort. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 19.) If a detainee is suffering any post-\nvaccine discomfort, the nurse assists him by providing him with an appropriate amount of oral \npain relief medication or by affording him any other medically necessary treatment/care free of \ncharge. (Dec. of Fields, ¶ 19.) \n  IV.  CONCLUSION \nThe Court should declare that the Decree has terminated. As set forth above, the Jail has \noffered and administered an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine according to FDA guidelines to \nall detainees housed at the Jail for a period of more than fourteen (14) days and who accept a \nvaccination, along with educational materials about the vaccine and non-punitive incentives to \ntake the vaccine. Thus, the provisions of Paragraph 28 have been satisfied. Additionally, by being \noffered a COVID-19 vaccine, Plaintiffs no longer possess any reasonable basis to assert that their \nconstitutional or statutory rights are being violated. Based upon the overwhelming understanding \nthat COVID-19 vaccines are safe and that they effectively eliminate the risks posed by COVID-\n19, once a detainee accepts a COVID-19 vaccine, the risk posed to him is eliminated. Whether a \ndetainee accepts a vaccine remains his own choice. However, Defendants should no longer be \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 218-1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 14 of 15    PageID\n3731\nbound by the terms of the Consent Decree that was designed to protect alleged constitutional and \nstatutory rights violations Plaintiffs can no longer assert. \nBased upon the above and upon the record as a whole, Defendants respectfully request that \nthis Court find that they have satisfied the provisions of Paragraph 28(b) of the Decree and declare \nthat the Consent Decree (ECF No. 161-2) has terminated. \n        Respectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \n      By:   s/Nathan D.

Specifically, Plaintiffs seek responses to four tailored \ninterrogatories and eight narrow requests for production, see Exs. A and B, focused on the \nJail’s response to COVID-19 and its efforts to protect the Class members in this action.  \nPlaintiffs also seek the Court’s leave to depose Kirk Fields, the Chief Jailer at the Jail, \nBruce Randolph, the County Health Officer with the Shelby County Health Department, \nand Donna Randolph, the Medical Director for the Jail all of whom filed declarations in \nsupport of Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order; \nnamely.  See Exs. C, D, and E.  As allowed for in the Court’s June 18 Inspection Order \n(ECF No. 56), Plaintiffs also seek leave to inspect the Shelby County Jail.  See Ex. F. \nPlaintiffs are entitled to and have good cause for expedited discovery.  Plaintiffs \nseek expedited discovery in connection with their pending motion for temporary injunctive \nrelief and the Court has already ruled that a determination on the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nmotion requires further factual development.  Plaintiffs seek this discovery on an expedited \nbasis prior to the Court’s scheduled hearing on their motion on July 1, 2020.  The discovery \nsought is readily available to Defendants and easily produced, and even allowing for \nexpedited discovery, Defendants have had and will have ample time to review the factual \nrecord.  For these reasons, and for the reasons explained further below, the Court should \ngrant Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited discovery. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 57   Filed 06/19/20   Page 7 of 13    PageID 853\nARGUMENT \nI.  Good Cause Exists to Grant Expedited Discovery. \nPlaintiffs have shown good cause for and they are entitled to expedited discovery.  \nThe Court has already determined that “[h]ere, the lack of a developed factual record \nprevents  the  Court  from  ruling  on  the  merits,”  and  “[c]onsideration  of  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional and statutory allegations requires a detailed examination of the facts.”  Order, \nECF No. 45 at 2.  As the Court has observed, because “[n]o such record is before the \nCourt,” and because “Plaintiffs and Defendants take divergent positions on several critical \nfactual issues,” “the facts require further development to determine the likelihood of \nsuccess on these particular claims.”  Order, ECF No. 45 at 2, 4.  Accordingly, the Court \nhas ordered its own independent inspection of the Jail and left open the possibility that \neither party may hire “its own expert to conduct its own inspection.”  Inspection Order, \nECF No. 56 at 4.  Accordingly, and in order to develop the facts necessary to determine \ntheir likelihood of success on their claims, Plaintiffs seek expedited discovery in the form \nof targeted interrogatories and requests for production, depositions of three of Defendants’ \ndeclarants in this matter, and an expert inspection of the Jail.  \nPlaintiffs have good cause for expedited discovery.  To determine whether good \ncause exists, courts may consider: (1) whether a request for injunctive relief is pending, (2) \nthe breadth of the discovery requests, (3) the purpose of the requests, (4) the burden to \ncomply, and (5) how far in advance of the typical discovery process the request was made.  \nArab Am. Civil Rights League v. Trump, No. 17-10310, 2017 WL 5639928, at *2 (E.D. \nMich. Mar. 31, 2017).  Plaintiffs satisfy all five factors. \nFirst, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order is pending, and the \nCourt has already made clear the need to develop the evidentiary record before the Court \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 57   Filed 06/19/20   Page 8 of 13    PageID 854\ncan rule on the merit of Plaintiffs’ Motion.  Second, Plaintiffs’ discovery requests are \n“narrowly tailored” to obtain the information relevant to this determination.  See 5ith \nElement Creative, LLC v. Kirsch, 2010 WL 4102907, at *2 (E.D. Ky. Oct. 18, 2010).  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs interrogatories, requests for production, and proposed depositions \nare limited to ascertaining information regarding the measures the Jail has taken since \nMarch 12, 2020, the date on which Governor Bill Lee issued Executive Order No. 14 \ndeclaring a state of emergency, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and  to identify and \nprotect the members of the Class (as defined in the Court’s June 10, 2020 Order (see ECF \nNo. 38 at 17–18)).  \nThird, the compelling purpose of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests is to develop the \n“distinct factual record” the Court needs to rule on the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Order, \nECF No. 45 at 2.  The information Plaintiffs seek is necessary to show, for example, \n“whether inmates are socially distanced, whether appropriate cleaning procedures have \nbeen implemented and whether inmates have proper access to hygiene supplies.”  Order, \nECF No. 45 at 3.  Plaintiffs are  entitled to corroborate Defendants’  representations \nregarding the population of the Jail, the extent of the COVID-19 testing undertaken there, \nand the results of that testing, as well as their contention that they have mitigated the risk \nto members of the Class.  See Defs. Opp., ECF No. 27 at 8, 27.  The depositions Plaintiffs \nseek will provide an efficient and effective means in the limited time available to clarify \nthe factual record.  For the reasons in the Court’s Orders of June 12 and 18, the Jail \ninspection that Plaintiffs seek is necessary to develop the factual record required for the \nadjudication of Plaintiffs’ claims. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 57   Filed 06/19/20   Page 9 of 13    PageID 855\nFourth, Defendants can readily comply with Plaintiffs’ requests.  The information \nsought is available and easily produced.  The information and documentation sought are \neither  routinely  created  in  the  course  of  business  or  maintained  in  accordance  with \nreporting requirements and monitoring of COVID-19.  Defendants likely compiled much \nof the information in opposing Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order.  \nLikewise, the three witnesses Plaintiffs seek to depose have already submitted declarations \nin this matter. \nFifth, Defendants have already had adequate time to analyze the relevant facts such \nthat they will not be prejudiced by expedited discovery at this stage.  Indeed, Defendants \nhave already opposed Plaintiffs’ motions for a temporary restraining order and for class \ncertification and they have briefed a motion to dismiss.  Given that they will still have \nfurther and sufficient opportunity to review the facts of the case, expedited discovery may \nbe ordered without prejudice to Defendants.   \nPlaintiffs  are  also  entitled  to  expedited  discovery  now.    Limited  expedited \ndiscovery is appropriate if there is “insufficient evidence to establish whether a Temporary \nRestraining Order should be issued.”  Hanover Am. Ins. Co. v. Tattooed Millionaire \nEntertainment, LLC, 2016 WL 9307506 (W.D. Tenn. Nov. 22, 2016).  Indeed, “[g]ood \ncause is usually found in cases involving requests for injunctive relief, [and] class actions \n. . . .”  Giltnane v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 2009 WL 230594, at *2 (E.D. Tenn. Jan. 30, 2009); \nsee also Advisory Committee Notes to 1993 amendments to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d) (noting \nthat discovery before a Rule 26(f) conference “will be appropriate in some cases, such as \nthose involving requests for a preliminary injunction”); Wilson v. Gordon, 2014 WL \n12788888, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 14, 2014) (collecting cases) (“courts within the Sixth \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 57   Filed 06/19/20   Page 10 of 13    PageID 856\nCircuit have endorsed the view that expedited discovery . . . may be appropriate in cases in \nwhich a preliminary injunction is sought.”). \nII.  The Court Should Order Defendants to Oppose this Motion on an Expedited \nBasis. \nSo Defendants may submit arguments in reply to this motion before the July 1, \n2020 hearing, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court set an expedited briefing \nschedule and order that Defendants file their opposition to this Motion, if any, not later \nthan Monday, June 22, at 12:30 pm. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant \nPlaintiffs’ Motion. \nDated:  June 19, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Brice M.

We are in the midst of the most significant global pandemic in generations.  COVID-\n19 is a highly contagious and deadly respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-\nCoV-2).  The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be at least 2.3 percent, which is several times \nmore than the common flu that kills thousands a year.1  The World Health Organization estimates \nthat one in five people who contract the disease requires hospitalization.2  \n2.  This action seeks urgent habeas and injunctive relief to protect medically vulnerable \npeople and people with disabilities detained at Shelby County Jail3 (the “Jail”) who are at high risk \nof severe injury or death from COVID-19.  Favian Busby, Michael Edgington, Russell Leaks, and \nJoseph Nelson (the “Named Plaintiffs”) seek to represent a class of all current and future medically \nvulnerable (as defined below) pretrial detainees held at the Jail who, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), are at high risk of severe infection or death from \nCOVID-19 (the “Class”).  Named Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of current and future \npretrial detainees who are medically vulnerable and at high risk of severe injury or death from \nCOVID-19 due to disabilities protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (the “Subclass”). \n                                                 \n1   The University of Tennessee Health Science Center estimates the fatality rate may be as high \nas 3.4 percent and notes that the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 are “100s of times worse \nthan influenza.” Expert Responses, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, \nhttps://uthsc.edu/coronavirus/expert-responses.php (last visited May 19, 2020).  As of May \n17, 2020, there were 4,651,119 confirmed cases globally, with 312,119 deaths and 1,700,354 \nrecoveries.  Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and \nEngineering at Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, \nhttps://cutt.ly/StEyn2U; see also Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), UpToDate, \nhttps://cutt.ly/GtJYSkj (as of May 15, 2020, estimated overall fatality rate of 2.3 percent \nglobally). \n2   Q&A on Coronaviruses (COVID-19), “Should I Worry About COVID-19?” World Health \nOrganization, https://cutt.ly/YtEyrxl (last visited May 19, 2020). \n3   For the purposes of this motion, “Shelby County Jail” or the “Jail” refers to the detention \nfacility located at 201 Poplar Ave., Memphis, TN 38103. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 3 of 27    PageID 806\n3.    COVID-19 has already spread throughout the Jail, infecting hundreds of people, yet \nDefendants continue to detain the members of the Class and Subclass (collectively, the “Classes”) \ndespite the fact that they are likely to suffer severe infection or death if they contract COVID-19 \nand despite the Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ (“Plaintiffs”) high risk of contracting the disease by virtue \nof their housing at the Jail.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek emergency relief from this Court \nprovisionally  certifying  the  Class  and  Subclass  and  compelling  Defendants  to  (a)  release4 \nimmediately Favian Busby, Michael Edgington, Russell Leaks, and Joseph Nelson; (b) promptly \nidentify COVID vulnerable individuals held at the Jail who are members of the Class; and (c) \npromptly release members of the Class from detention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  Plaintiffs bring this putative class action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and for relief \nfrom both detention that violates their Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution \nand pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. and 29 U.S.C. § 794 for relief from disability \ndiscrimination.  \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n(federal question jurisdiction), 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas jurisdiction) and Article I, Section 9, \nclause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (the Suspension Clause). \n                                                 \n4   The term “release,” as used throughout this Petition, refers to the discharge of detained \nindividuals from the physical confines of the Shelby County Jail, not necessarily release from \nall forms of custody.  Release options may include, but are not limited to: supervised release \n(including through the use of GPS or other forms of location monitoring), halfway house \nresidential placement, transfer to a hospital or other facility, or diversion to alternative \ncommunity and treatment programs.  Indeed, Shelby County already maintains a Pretrial \nServices Department “offering alternatives to incarceration at every stage of the criminal \njustice system.”  See Shelby Cty. Tenn., Pretrial Services, available at \nhttps://www.shelbycountytn.gov/250/Justice-Initiatives (last visited May 20, 2020). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 4 of 27    PageID 807\n6.  Venue lies in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, the judicial \ndistrict in which Plaintiffs are currently in custody.  Venue is proper in the Western District of \nTennessee under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as venue is proper in any district in which a defendant resides. \nPARTIES \n7.  Michael Edgington is a pretrial detainee at Shelby County Jail.  He is 60 years old, \nputting him at high risk of serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-19. \n8.  Favian Busby is a pretrial detainee at Shelby County Jail.  He has diabetes and takes \ninsulin.  Additionally, he has developed hypertension as a result of his diabetes.  These conditions \nput him at high risk of serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-19.   \n9.  Russell Leaks is a pretrial detainee at Shelby County Jail.  He is 65 years old and \nsuffers from chronic liver disease including hepatitis.  Mr. Leaks also suffers from hypertension, \nan irregular heartbeat, and he previously suffered a heart attack.  He is at high risk of serious illness \nor death if he contracts COVID-19. \n10.  Joseph Nelson is a pretrial detainee at Shelby County Jail.  He has diabetes, which he \nmanages with insulin and Metformin. He has also developed hypertension as a result of diabetes.  \nHe is at high risk of serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-19. \n11.  Respondent-Defendant Floyd Bonner, Jr. is the Sheriff of Shelby County, Tennessee \nand may be served with process at 201 Poplar Avenue, 9th Floor, Memphis, Tennessee 38103.  \nDefendant Bonner is named in this action in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Shelby County. \n12.  Respondent-Defendant  Shelby  County  Sheriff’s  Department  is  a  Tennessee \ngovernmental department which, by virtue of its custody of Plaintiffs, is a party defendant to this \nmatter.  Defendant Shelby County Sheriff’s Department may be served with process by serving \nSheriff Floyd Bonner, Jr.   \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 5 of 27    PageID 808\nFACTS \nA.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members Are at High Risk of Severe Injury or Death from \nCOVID-19. \n13.  COVID-19 is an extremely infectious and deadly disease that is transmitted from \nperson to person.  The University of Tennessee Health Science Center indicates COVID-19 may \nbe hundreds of times more fatal than influenza.5   \n14.  On March 12, 2020, Governor Bill Lee declared a state of emergency in Tennessee in \nresponse to COVID-19.  The Tennessee Department of Health notes that as of May 19, 2020, \n18,378 Tennesseans have been infected with COVID-19, with 1,498 hospitalizations and 305 \ndeaths.  The highest number of deaths to date have occurred in Shelby County, which has the \nsecond highest number of cases.   \n15.  As of May 20, 2020, at least 4,761,559 people worldwide have tested positive for the \nvirus, and 317,559 people have died.6   In the United States, at least 1,504,830 people have \ncontracted the virus, and at least 90,340 people have died from it.7  Early data suggests COVID-\n19’s mortality rate in the U.S. is 1.3 percent, and as high as 3.6 percent in some counties.8 \n16.  COVID-19 can cause grave injury to the lungs and heart, causing myocarditis, or \ninflammation of the heart muscle.  COVID-19 can also result in permanent injury to the kidneys. \n                                                 \n5   University of Tennessee Health Science Center, supra note 1. \n6   Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, World Health Organization  \nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 (last visited May 20, \n2020). \n7   Cases in the U.S., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html (last visited May \n20, 2020). \n8  Anirban Basu, Estimating The Infection Fatality Rate Among Symptomatic COVID-19 Cases \nIn The United States, Health Affairs (May 7, 2020) \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00455. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 6 of 27    PageID 809\n17.  Patients who experience severe infections from COVID-19 require supportive care, \nincluding recourse to scarce medical equipment and specialized care providers, who are able to \nmonitor and implement the care these individuals require.  This level of support can exceed local \nhealth-care resources.   \n18.  Patients  who  survive  severe  COVID-19  infections  often  require  extensive \nrehabilitation to mitigate neurologic damage and the loss of respiratory capacity.  Many who suffer \nfrom severe infections will likely experience lifelong limitations and disabilities. \n19.  Age is a significant risk factor for complications and death.  The mortality rate is at \nleast 1-3 percent for those over 55, and less than 1 percent for those under 55.9  Certain underlying \nmedical conditions and disabilities increase the risk of complications or death from COVID-19 \nregardless of age.10  The University of Tennessee Health Science Center notes that medically \n                                                 \n9     Severe Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19, Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (Mar. 27, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm. \n10   Known conditions associated with a heightened risk of mortality and complications from \nCOVID-19 include, but are not limited to: blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or the \nuse of blood thinners; chronic kidney disease; chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and \nchronic hepatitis; cancer or cancer treatments; organ or bone marrow transplant; the use of \nimmunosuppressant medications; HIV or AIDS; diabetes; inherited metabolic disorders and \nmitochondrial disorders; heart disease, including coronary artery disease, congenital heart \ndisease, and heart failure; lung disease, including asthma and COPD (chronic bronchitis or \nemphysema); neurological and neurologic development conditions such as cerebral palsy, \nstroke, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury; severe obesity (which is defined as having \na BMI of 40 or higher); intellectual or developmental disability that may inhibit a person’s \nability to understand or act on prevention measures or communicate symptoms, and any other \ncondition or treatment that weakens immune response.  See Harvard Medical School, If you \nare at higher risk: How to reduce risk of infection and what to do if you get sick, Harvard \nHealth Publishing (updated May 6, 2020), https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/if-you-are-at-higher-risk; see also High-Risk Conditions, Centers For Disease \nControl And Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/underlying-\nconditions.html (last visited May 16, 2020); University of Tennessee Health Science Center, \nsupra note 1 (“The elderly, persons with chronic respiratory or cardiac diseases, pregnant \nwomen, and immunocompromised persons are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-\n19.”).  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 7 of 27    PageID 810\nvulnerable persons—those who are likely to suffer worse outcomes if they were to contract \nCOVID-19—may well need to “stay at home as much as possible” because “the only current \nadvice is to avoid others who might be sick.”11 \n20.  According to the CDC, African Americans are at increased risk for the kinds of \nmedical conditions and disabilities that increase the risk of serious illness or death from COVID-\n19.  The rate of diabetes is 60 percent higher in African Americans than in Caucasian Americans;12 \nthe rate of hypertension is 40 percent higher.13  Recent analysis of CDC data shows that the \nCOVID-19 mortality rate among African Americans is 2.6 times that of white Americans.14  On \nany given day, the population of the Jail is more than 86 percent African American.15  All of the \nNamed Plaintiffs are African American.   \nB.  Plaintiffs and the Class Members Are Likely to Contract COVID-19 Unless They Are \nReleased. \n21.  Experts agree that COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that are \ninhaled by people nearby.  Asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 can also transmit it; public health \nofficials estimate that as many as half of all transmitted cases pass from an infected person with \n                                                 \n11   University of Tennessee Health Science Center, supra note 1. \n12   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, Diabetes and \nAfrican Americans (accessed May 18, 2020), \nhttps://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=18. \n13   U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, Heart Disease \nand African Americans (accessed May 18, 2020), \nhttps://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=19. \n14   APM Research Lab Staff, Covid-19 Deaths by Races and Ethnicity in the U.S., APM \nResearch Lab (May 12, 2020), https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race. \n15   MacArthur Foundation, Safety + Justice Challenge, “Shelby County, TN,” \nhttp://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/challenge-site/shelby-county/ (last visited May 20, \n2020). \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 8 of 27    PageID 811\nfew or no symptoms.16  Experts at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center stress that \npeople infected with COVID-19 may be infectious for upwards of 2–3 weeks, though any \nsymptoms they experience last for far less time.17 \n22.  There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.  The only known way in which to mitigate \nthe risk of contracting COVID-19 is to maintain at least six feet of distance from other people, and \nto practice vigilant hygiene, including frequent hand-washing, wearing face masks and gloves, and \nfrequently sanitizing high-touch surfaces.18  Experts at the University of Tennessee Health Science \nCenter note in particular that social distancing and rigorous hygiene are the “best prevention” and \n“better than even an N95 mask.”19  \n23.  Accordingly, Governor Lee has required all Tennesseans who leave their homes to \nadhere to social distancing measures recommended by the CDC.  Similarly, the Shelby County \nHealth Department has advised all businesses to require that their employees and customers wear \nface masks and keep six feet from one another.20 \n24.

In addition \nto causing significant harm to those incarcerated, rampant outbreaks of COVID-19 in jails become \nthe direct cause of additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among jail staff and the \nsurrounding community in which a jail sits.22  \n25.  Across the country, governments and jail staff have recognized the threat that COVID-\n19 poses to incarcerated people and the surrounding community.  Jail administrators in numerous \nstates, including Alabama, California, Colorado, Ohio, and New Jersey, have concluded that \nwidespread jail release is a necessary and appropriate public health intervention.23 \n26.  Courts have intervened across the country to release COVID-vulnerable detainees \nwho are at high risk of severe infection or death from the disease.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Williams, \nNo. 4:20-cv-00794, 2020 WL 1940882 (N.D.

Across Tennessee, positive tests in correctional facilities continue to rise.26  As \nreported on April 17, 2020, 23 pretrial detainees at the Jail were tested; five were positive for \nCOVID-19.27  The Jail tested 266 pretrial detainees and employees on or about April 25th, and as \nreported on April 29th, seventy-two percent tested positive. 28  In data released on May 15, 151 \npretrial detainees and 66 jail staff tested positive for COVID-19; publicly-available data does not \nyet show how many were tested in arriving at these numbers.29  The true numbers in the Jail are \n                                                 \n24   See also Malam v.

To date, one Shelby County \nJail employee has died from COVID-19.30 \n28.  Dr. Joe Goldenson, a physician with over 33 years of experience in correctional health \ncare, has explained that conditions at jails prohibit social distancing and “exacerbate the spread of \ninfectious diseases, particularly diseases like COVID-19.”  Likewise, Dr. Virginia Fefferman has \nexplained, “[t]he living conditions within the jail spread disease.  Incarcerated people cannot \npractice social distancing due to the lack of space, overcrowding, or the requirement of constant \nsupervision.    Incarcerated  people  are  moved  in  groups  from  jail  to  court  or,  where  court \nproceedings are halted due to this pandemic, forced to remain in their cells or dorms in close \nproximity to each other.  Incarcerated people often have limited access to products and equipment \nnecessary to practice good personal hygiene, such as soap, or hand sanitizer or cleaning products.”     \n29.  As a result, Dr. Goldenson believes that “medically vulnerable persons at Shelby \nCounty Jail are at grave risk of death or serious illness” and “must be released as soon as possible.”  \nLikewise, Dr. Fefferman has cautioned that “[e]ach additional day the jail system continues under \ncurrent operational standards will cost lives in both the incarcerated population and the broader \ncommunity each jail serves.”   \nC.  The Class Members Are Unsafe and Their Rights Are Being Violated. \n30.  At the Jail, the Named Plaintiffs live in “pods” with cells lining an open communal \narea.  Every cell has at least one person, and most have two people.   \n31.  When more than one person is in a cell, it is impossible to maintain a six-foot distance \nfrom one another.  Detainees report spending up to 30 to 48 hours at a time in the same cell with \nanother person.  Class members sleep in bunk beds, with one bed three to four feet another.  Each \n                                                 \n30    Yolanda Jones, Sheriff’s Office Employee Dies From COVID-19,  DAILY MEMPHIAN (Apr. 21, 2020) \nhttps://dailymemphian.com/article/13185/sheriffs-office-employee-dies-from-covid-19.  \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 12 of 27    PageID 815\ncell also has an open toilet area and a sink that is shared by both cellmates.  Showers are in the \ncommunal area of the pod and are shared by all members of the pod.   \n32.  During mealtime, detainees are required to line up inches apart from each other to \nreceive their meal trays from other detainees who distribute meals as part of their work duties.  \nDetainees then sit four men to a table—sometimes squeezing in five or six men if there is not \nenough available seating—to eat their meal.  It is not possible to socially distance in the communal \narea.  People detained in the Jail were provided one mask on or around April 22, 2020.  Most of \nthose who received the masks have not been able to receive replacements.  Detainees use the same \nmetal utensils and cup for each meal and are responsible for maintaining their own utensils and \ncups.  They do not have access to a dishwasher or bleach for cleaning their utensils.   \n33.  Class members must also use, and reuse, the same “high-touch” items, such as \ntelephones and kiosks, and the Jail does not provide disinfectant or other cleaning supplies to \nsanitize these items.  The Jail gives Class members a clean change of clothes only once a week.  \nClass members must purchase soap from commissary, and if they cannot afford commissary soap \nthey must wait several days to get free soap.  The soap available for free is small, and only lasts \nthree or four days.  Class members are only rarely able to clean their cells, relying on staff to offer \ncleaning supplies.  Even when cleaning spray is available, Class members must use unwashed \ntowels to wipe down surfaces.  There is no hand sanitizer available to any Class members. \n34.  The Jail does not test for COVID-19 upon the intake of new arrestees.  If someone \ndisplays symptoms of COVID-19, he is still booked into the Jail but is escorted to an isolation pod.  \nBecause the Jail relies on reported symptoms to decide whom to quarantine, there is no system for \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 13 of 27    PageID 816\npreventing spread of COVID-19 among asymptomatic people, even though many infected with \nCOVID-19 may be asymptomatic while still capable of infecting others.31 \n35.  On April 29, 2020, staff at the Jail pepper-sprayed detainees in medical isolation for \nCOVID-19.  This exacerbated the difficulty of breathing for many persons already experiencing \nsymptoms including shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, coughing up blood, fevers, and chills.   \n36.  On May 19, 2020, staff at the Jail forced detainees who had been in quarantine for \nhaving contracted or been exposed to COVID-19 back into the general population.  Those being \nmoved from medical isolation were not retested for COVID-19 prior to being moved, nor were \nthey screened for symptoms of COVID-19.  Many detainees resisted the move because it put other \npeople in the Jail at risk of increased exposure to the virus: as one person in quarantined housing \nput it, “All we are looking for is to be re-tested before we are re-classified and rehoused. . . [I feel] \na moral obligation” not to pass the virus to anyone else.32 Jail staff pepper sprayed those \nindividuals who refused to move out of quarantine. \nD.  Respondent-Defendants Have Discriminated Against the Members of the Subclass \nin Violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. \n37.  Respondent-Defendants’  actions  violate  not  only  Class  members’  constitutional \nrights, but also the Subclass members’ rights under disability rights laws.  The Jail has failed, and \ncontinues to fail, to make reasonable modifications to detention to ensure that people with \ndisabilities have an equal opportunity to participate in the adjudication of their criminal cases and \nto access jail services.  For example, the Jail has failed to make modifications to ensure that \nmembers of the Subclass can practice adequate social distancing, and has failed to implement a \n                                                 \n31   See Furukawa, supra note 14. \n32   Yolanda Jones, Inmates at 201 Poplar pepper-sprayed over move after COVID quarantine, \nDAILY MEMPHIAN (May 19, 2020) https://dailymemphian.com/article/14169/covid-19-201-\npoplar-anthony-buckner-shelby-county-sheriffs-office. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 14 of 27    PageID 817\nsystem for release as a modification to ensure Subclass members are alive to participate in the \nadjudication of their cases. \n38.  By continuing to detain Plaintiffs with disabilities, Defendants’ policies and practices \nviolate the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.     \n39.  Plaintiff Favian Busby has been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension, for which \nhe takes medication daily.  He also recently had surgery to implant a new joint between his femur \nand hip, from which he is still recovering.  These conditions put Mr. Busby at high risk of severe \ninfection or death from COVID-19. \n40.  Four men in Mr. Busby’s pod tested positive for COVID-19 on April 24.  It is not \npossible for Mr. Busby to socially distance in his pod.  To use a phone or obtain medication, Mr. \nBusby must wait in crowded lines.  Staff do not socially distance and often do not wear masks, \nand Mr. Busby has not seen them wash their hands or use hand sanitizer.    \n41.  He has also seen other people in the pod with COVID-19 symptoms who have avoided \ntesting for fear of being put in isolation.  Staff also do not always follow quarantine procedures.  \nMr. Busby has seen people go into quarantine, return to the pod, exhibit symptoms again, and yet \nnot be sent back into quarantine.  \n42.  Plaintiff Russell Leaks is 65 years old and suffers from chronic liver disease, including \nhepatitis, hypertension, and an irregular heartbeat—he previously suffered a heart attack.  These \nconditions put Mr. Leaks at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19. \n43.  Mr. Leaks is detained in 5B pod, a dormitory-style pod shared by 21 people sleeping \nin bunks that sit about two feet apart.  The dormitory is an open space with shared bathrooms, \ntoilets, and common use items such as phones and kiosks. It is not possible for Mr. Leaks to social \ndistance in his dormitory when conducting essential activities such as receiving medication, \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 15 of 27    PageID 818\nmaking phone calls, using the shower or toilet, or eating meals.  Mr. Leaks has chosen not to go to \nsick call since the COVID-19 outbreak due to the inability to social distance in the medical unit.  \n44.  A man in Mr. Leaks’ dormitory developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in \nlate April of 2020 but neither was he tested, nor was anyone else in the dorm.  \n45.  Plaintiff Joseph Nelson has been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension, for which \nhe takes medication daily.  In November 2019, he was hospitalized for pancreatitis.  These \nconditions put Mr. Nelson at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19. \n46.  Mr. Nelson is housed in 5B pod, which is a dormitory style unit without individual \ncells. Instead, the pod is shared by 21 people sleeping in bunks.  Since March 2020, Mr. Nelson \nhas had two bunkmates who sleep approximately two feet away from him.  As of June 10, 2020, \nMr. Nelson did not have a bunk mate but someone was sleeping immediately next to him in an \nadjacent bunk.  In 5B pod, there are common spaces with access to showers, toilets, meal service, \neating tables, medication distribution, and phone kiosks.  It is not possible for Mr. Nelson to social \ndistance in the pod. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n47.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedures on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated individuals consisting of all \npretrial detainees in the custody of the Jail who are medically vulnerable (the “Class”).   \n48.  The Class is defined as follows: all current and future persons held at the Jail in \npretrial custody during the coronavirus pandemic who are aged 55 and older, as well as all current \nand future persons held at the Jail of any age who have: (a) lung disease, including asthma, chronic \nobstructive  pulmonary  disease  (e.g.,  bronchitis  or  emphysema),  or  other  chronic  conditions \nassociated with impaired lung function; (b) heart disease, such as congenital heart disease, \ncongestive heart failure and coronary artery disease; (c) chronic liver or kidney disease (including \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 16 of 27    PageID 819\nhepatitis and dialysis patients); (d) diabetes or other endocrine disorders; (e) hypertension; (f) \ncompromised immune systems (such as from cancer, HIV, receipt of an organ or bone marrow \ntransplant, as a side effect of medication, or other autoimmune disease); (g) blood disorders \n(including  sickle  cell  disease);  (h)  inherited  metabolic  disorders;  (i)  history  of  stroke; \n(j) neurological or developmental disability; (k) cancer or cancer treatments; (l) a BMI of 40 or \nmore; and/or (m) muscular dystrophy or spinal cord injury.  \n49.  Favian Busby, Russell Leaks, and Joseph Nelson also seek to represent a subclass, \nconsisting of all current and future pretrial detainees in custody at the Jail who are medically \nvulnerable because of a disability as defined in the ADA (the “Subclass”).  The Subclass includes \npeople with all conditions listed in paragraph 42, except those who are medically vulnerable solely \nbecause of age or BMI. \n50.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under \nfederal law.  It satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements for \nmaintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n51.  Joinder is impracticable because (1) the Classes are numerous; (2) the Classes include \nfuture members, and (3) the Class members are incarcerated, rendering their ability to institute \nindividual lawsuits limited, particularly in light of reduced legal visitation and court closures in \nShelby County. \n52.  Numerosity:  On information and belief, there are at least 300 people in the proposed \nClass and Subclass.  First, there are currently over 200 people over 55 years old detained at the \nJail.33  People in jails have higher rates of chronic health conditions than people in the general \n                                                 \n33   See Shelby Cty. Sherriff’s Office, Who’s In Jail, available at \nhttp://www.shelbysheriff.org/injail.html (last visited May 18, 2020). \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 17 of 27    PageID 820\npopulation.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, it is estimated that 39.8 percent of people \nin jail have a chronic health condition.34  Virtually all of these people will be members of the Class \nand Subclass.  Further, as the below chart illustrates, health conditions that make COVID-19 \nparticularly dangerous are more prevalent in the incarcerated population than in the general \npublic.35  \n53.  Specific information regarding the size of the Class and the Subclass, as well as the \nidentity of the members of each group, is in Defendants’ exclusive control.  As of the filing of this \nAmended Petition, Defendants have identified approximately 450 members of the Class.  See ECF \nNos. 43 and 44.  \n54.  Commonality:  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the \nproposed Class and Subclass, including: (a) whether Defendants are detaining the members of the \nClass in violation of their constitutional rights; (b) whether Defendants’ policies and practices \n                                                 \n34   See Laura M. Maruschack et al., Medical Problems of State and Federal Prisoners and Jail \nInmates, 2011-12, p. 21, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice \nStatistics (Feb. 2015), available at https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mpsfpji1112.pdf.  \n35   Peter Wagner & Emily Widra, No need to wait for pandemics: The public health case for \ncriminal justice reform, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 6, 2020), https://cutt.ly/7tJXmlC. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 18 of 27    PageID 821\ndiscriminate against the members of the Subclass in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct; and (c) whether Defendants are implementing policies and procedures to ensure social \ndistancing, and to provide adequate PPE, or otherwise following CDC guidance to protect Class \nmembers.   \n55.  Typicality:  The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those of the Class as a \nwhole, including because (a) each Named Plaintiff is currently in Defendants’ custody and (b) the \nNamed Plaintiffs’ and all of the Class members’ claims arise from the same wrongful acts, \nomissions, policies, and practices of Defendants, and are based on the same legal theories. \n56.  Adequacy:  The Named Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  The Named Plaintiffs \nhave no interests adverse to the interests of the proposed Class.  The Named Plaintiffs retained pro \nbono counsel with experience and success in the prosecution of civil rights litigation.  Counsel for \nthe Named Plaintiffs know of no conflicts among proposed Class members or between counsel \nand proposed Class members. \n57.  Defendants  have  acted  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to  all  proposed  Class \nmembers.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs therefore seek Class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2). \n58.  In the alternative, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) are satisfied because prosecuting \nseparate actions would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to \nindividual Class members that would establish incompatible standards for the party opposing the \nproposed Class. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 19 of 27    PageID 822\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution \n28 U.S.C. § 2241  \nThe Class Against All Defendants \n \n59.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n60.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, persons in pretrial custody cannot be punished as \npart of their detention.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979).  Punishment is established \nif the jailer’s conduct is either not rationally related to a legitimate, non-punitive government \npurpose or excessive in relation to that purpose. \n61.  Under general circumstances, Defendants can hold pretrial detainees if, after making \nindividualized findings based on the person’s flight risk and danger to the community, and \nevaluating less restrictive options than jail, it is clear that nothing short of detention will mitigate \na credible risk of flight or danger.  But and as a condition of holding persons in pretrial custody, \nthe Jail must provide them with health care services and a safe environment, and cannot punish \nthem.  Here, Defendants have exposed the Named Plaintiffs and the Class members to high risk of \nsevere infection or death from COVID-19.  Continuing to detain the Named Plaintiffs and the \nClass members is punitive, not rationally related to a legitimate purpose, and/or excessive in \nrelation to any legitimate purpose. \n62.  Accordingly, Defendants, as supervisors, direct participants, and policy makers for \nShelby County, have violated the rights of the Named Plaintiffs and the Class members under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 20 of 27    PageID 823\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUnconstitutional Confinement in Violation of the  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n28 U.S.C. § 2241   \nThe Class Against All Defendants \n \n63.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n64.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, corrections officials are required to provide for the \nreasonable health and safety of persons in pretrial custody.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, \n315–16, 324 (1982) (the state has an “unquestioned duty” to provide adequate medical care for \ndetained persons). \n65.  Corrections officials are required to provide for the reasonable health and safety of \npersons in pretrial custody, including risks of future harm to their health and safety.  See Helling \nv. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33–34 (1993) (“That the Eighth Amendment protects against future \nharm to inmates is not a novel proposition. . . . [i]t would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates \nwho plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing \nyet had happened to them”).  \n66.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the government must provide incarcerated persons \nwith reasonable safety and address serious medical needs that arise in jail to at least the same \ndegree of persons in custody subsequent to a conviction, if not to a higher degree.  Deliberate \nindifference to the serious risk COVID-19 poses to members of the Class violates this right. \n67.  Named Plaintiffs and the members of the Class are at high risk of severe infection \nfrom COVID-19.  The Jail is rife with confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Named Plaintiffs and Class \nmembers, because of their medical conditions and COVID-vulnerability, cannot be safe in the \ndorm-style facilities in which they are housed at the Jail.  The only way to ensure their safety and \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 21 of 27    PageID 824\nprotect their constitutional rights is through release.  Defendants are aware of the risk to the safety \nof the Named Plaintiffs and the Class members, but they have not taken steps to release them.  \nDefendants are therefore deliberately indifferent to the safety of the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \nmembers. \n68.  Accordingly, Defendants have violated the rights of the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \nmembers under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Violation of Title II of the ADA \n42 U.S.C. § 12131, et seq./ 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Subclass Against All Defendants \n \n69.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n70.  Title II of the ADA requires that public entities refrain from discriminating against \nqualified individuals on the basis of disability.  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The regulations implementing \nTitle II of the ADA require that public entities avoid policies, practices, criteria, or methods of \nadministration that have the effect of excluding or discriminating against persons with disabilities \nin the entity’s programs, services, or activities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), (b)((3), (8).  Further, a \npublic entity must “make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the \nmodifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public \nentity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the \nservice, program, or activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n71.  Members of the Subclass are individuals with disabilities for purposes of the ADA. 42 \nU.S.C. § 12102.  They are “qualified” for the programs, services, and activities being challenged \nherein.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 22 of 27    PageID 825\n72.  Defendants are violating Title II of the ADA by failing to make the reasonable \nmodifications necessary to ensure equal access to adjudication, jail services, and release for people \nwith disabilities who face high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19.  Defendants are \nfurther violating the ADA by employing methods of administration (including a policy of non-\nrelease even in the face of the dangers of COVID-19) that tend to discriminate against people with \ndisabilities. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nDiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Violation  \nof Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n29 U.S.C. § 794/28 U.S.C. § 2241 \nThe Subclass Against All Defendants \n \n73.  Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege each and every allegation above, as if set forth in full \nherein. \n74.  Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  states  that  “no  qualified  individual  with \ndisability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of [] disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  The regulations implementing \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require that entities receiving federal financial assistance \navoid unnecessary policies, practices, criteria, or methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscriminating against persons with disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i). \n75.  Defendants receive “Federal financial assistance” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § \n794(a). \n76.  Favian Busby, Russell Leaks, and Joseph Nelson are individuals with disabilities for \nthe purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12012, 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B).  They are \n“qualified” for the programs, services, and activities being challenged herein. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 23 of 27    PageID 826\n77.  Defendants are violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to make the \nreasonable modifications necessary to ensure equal access to adjudication, jail services, and release \nfor people with disabilities who are at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19.  \nDefendants are further violating the Rehabilitation Act by employing methods of administration \n(including a policy of non-release even in the face of the dangers of COVID-19) that tend to \ndiscriminate against people with disabilities. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n78.  The Named Plaintiffs and Class members respectfully request that the Court enter an \nOrder: \n1.  certifying this Petition as a Class Action; \n2.  granting a temporary restraining order and/or writ of habeas corpus requiring \nDefendants to release immediately all Named Plaintiffs; \n3.  granting a temporary restraining order and/or writ of habeas corpus requiring \nDefendants to produce promptly a list of all other Class and Subclass members \ndetained at the Jail: \n4.  granting a temporary restraining order and/or writ of habeas corpus and/or order an \nenlargement of custody for all members of the Class and Subclass incarcerated \nsolely due to their inability to afford a financial condition of release, solely due to \nan alleged technical violation of probation or parole, or whose release Defendants \ndo not object to; \n5.  granting a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunction, \nand/or writ of habeas corpus imposing a process—to be determined by the Court—\nto  consider  the  habeas  corpus  release  and/or  enlargement  of  custody  of  all \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 24 of 27    PageID 827\nremaining Class and Subclass members not released pursuant to Paragraph 4 within \ntwo weeks, considering: \ni.  the deprivation of the petitioner’s federal rights posed by the COVID-19 \noutbreak (including the disability discrimination for Subclass members and \nthe necessity of providing modifications including release); \nii.   any competent evidence that the individual poses a serious risk of flight or \ndanger to others; \niii.  whether, by clear and convincing evidence, any present risk of flight of \ndanger outweighs the threat to the petitioner’s health and safety posed by \nhis  exposure  to  COVID-19  in  the  Jail,  after  considering  alternative \nconditions to manage the risk(s) presented; \n6.  granting a preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, and/or writ of habeas \ncorpus requiring continued reporting as to the future members of the Class and \nSubclass, and requiring Defendants to divert Class and Subclass members from \nincarceration at the Shelby County Jail, including but not limited to by exercising \ntheir authority under T.C.A. 40-7-120; \n7.  providing that, if immediate relief is not granted on the basis of this Petition alone, \nthen expedited review of the Petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  2243, including oral \nargument, via telephonic or videoconference if necessary; \n8.   declaring that the Jail’s policies violate the Fourteenth Amendment right against \ncruel and unusual punishment with respect to the Class; \n9.  declaring that the Jail’s policies violate the Fourteenth Amendment right to be free \nfrom punishment prior to conviction with respect to the Class; \n \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 50   Filed 06/16/20   Page 25 of 27    PageID 828\n10.  declaring that the Jail’s policies violate the ADA and Rehabilitation Act with \nrespect to the Subclass; \n11.  awarding Named Plaintiffs’ attorney fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. sec. 1988 and \nother applicable law; and \nAny further relief this Court deems appropriate. \n \n \nDated:   June 16, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Brice M.

For the following reasons, the \nCourt GRANTS IN PART and LIMITS IN PART the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Expedited \nDiscovery. \nBACKGROUND \n \nOn May 20, 2020, named Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2241 and a Class Action Complaint for Declaratory Injunctive Relief.  (ECF No. 1.)  \nPlaintiffs seek “urgent habeas and injunctive relief to protect medically vulnerable people and \npeople with disabilities detained” at the Shelby County Jail (“Jail”), located at 201 Poplar \nAvenue in Memphis, Tennessee, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  (Id.)  Specifically,   \nPlaintiffs allege that their constitutional rights, under the Fourteenth Amendment, and their \nstatutory rights, under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, are being \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 2 of 8    PageID 980\nviolated.  (ECF No. 2 at PageID 53-59.)  Concurrently, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order (“TRO”).  (Id.) \nThis Court certified the Class, (ECF No. 38), but reserved ruling on the TRO Motion, \ngiven the need for further fact-finding, (ECF No. 45).  To that end, the Court appointed its own \nexpert (“Independent Inspector”) to render an opinion to the Court on the current \naccommodations provided to the medically vulnerable inmates in the Jail but noted that the \nInspection Order did not preclude “either party from hiring its own expert to conduct its own \ninspection.”  (ECF No. 56.) \nHere, Plaintiffs seek the answers to four interrogatories and documents responsive to \neight requests for production of documents (“RFPs”).  Additionally, Plaintiffs seek to depose \nthree Shelby County health officials and conduct an inspection of the Jail.  Plaintiffs request the \nCourt’s leave to conduct this discovery on an expedited schedule.  If the Plaintiffs’ expedited \ndiscovery schedule is adopted, the written discovery responses are due on June 24, with the \nShelby County health officials deposed on June 25 and June 26.  Plaintiffs do not provide a date \nas to its desired inspection of the Jail, but aver that it will be at a mutually agreed upon time. \nDefendants oppose the Motion on three grounds:  (1) Plaintiffs, as habeas petitioners, do \nnot show that good cause exists for any discovery, (2) Plaintiffs do not show that good cause \nexists for expedited discovery and (3) the discovery sought is overly broad, unduly burdensome \nand prejudicial to Defendants. \nANALYSIS \n \nThe Court first turns to whether Plaintiffs meet their burden to conduct discovery as \nhabeas petitioners and then to whether they meet their burden to conduct expedited discovery.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 3 of 8    PageID 981\nAfter finding that Plaintiffs largely meet these burdens, the Court limits the scope of certain \noverbroad discovery requests. \nI.  Discovery as Habeas Petitioners \n \nHabeas petitioners are “entitled to invoke the process of discovery available under the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exercise of his \ndiscretion and for good cause shown grants leave to do so.”  Rule 6(a), RULES GOVERNING \nSECTION 2254 CASES.1  Good cause exists where specific allegations show reason to believe that \nthe petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is entitled to \nrelief.  See Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 300 (1969);  Lynott v. Story, 929 F.2d 228, 232 (6th \nCir. 1991).  Petitioner need not show that the additional discovery would definitely lead to relief.  \nSee Payne v. Bell, 89 F. Supp. 2d 967, 970 (W.D. Tenn. 2000).  Rather, he need only show good \ncause that the evidence sought would lead to relevant evidence regarding his petition.  Id.   \nHere, Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery because the evidence sought is directly relevant \nto the essential elements of their Fourteenth Amendment and ADA claims.  Plaintiffs allege that \nthey are being confined in violation of the Constitution, and include affidavits with support for \nthose allegations.  (See, e.g., ECF Nos. 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9.)  Plaintiffs’ discovery requests probe \ninto the health and safety measures implemented at the Jail amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  The \nspecific information that Plaintiffs seek from Defendants—e.g., how inmates are tested, Jail \npolicies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, how inmates are housed—are material to how \nDefendants are addressing the potential spread of the virus within the facility.  The Court has \nreason to believe that if Plaintiffs can uncover sufficient facts through its discovery requests that \n \n1 The Rules Governing Section 2254 cases may also be applied to habeas actions filed under \n§ 2241.  See Rule 1(b), RULES GOVERNING SECTION 2254 CASES. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 4 of 8    PageID 982\nDefendants’ detention measures are “excessive” or that Defendants acted with “deliberate \nindifference” toward Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs may be entitled to relief.  (ECF No. 2 at PageID 53-59.)  \nSee also Payne v. Bell, 89 F. Supp. 2d 967, 970 (2000).    \nRecall why the Court withheld ruling on Plaintiff’s TRO Motion.  Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendants are punishing pretrial inmates through confinement, that Defendants are deliberately \nindifferent to medically vulnerable inmates’ health needs and that Defendants fail to provide \nreasonable accommodations to disabled inmates.  Plaintiffs provided sworn affidavits and \ndeclarations attesting to these allegations.  For instance, Plaintiffs’ declarants stated that Jail staff \nare moving from pod-to-pod without masks, and without regard to the medically vulnerable \ninmates.  (ECF Nos. 2-7, 2-9.)  If some of their graver allegations are true, Plaintiffs may be \nentitled to habeas relief.    \nYet, because Defendants attested to the exact opposite of Plaintiffs’ allegations, i.e. that \nthe Jail’s health measures are aligned with those recommended by the Centers of Disease Control \nand Prevention, the Court reserved ruling on the TRO Motion until it could determine whose \nfactual allegations are accurate.  That the TRO Motion is pending due to an undeveloped factual \nrecord suggests that the Parties do their part, and speedily conduct discovery in the coming days \nand weeks.  While the facts can never be developed enough for the Court to rule on such an \nemergency motion, Plaintiffs’ proposed expedited discovery is a step in the right direction.  This \nhabeas petition is one where discovery is permitted, indeed is necessary.        \nII.  Expedited Discovery \n \nIn some cases, “such as those involving requests for preliminary injunction,” expedited \ndiscovery may be appropriate.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d) 1993 Advisory Committee Notes.  \nCourts look to whether circumstances show “good cause” for expedited discovery.  See Fabreeka \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 5 of 8    PageID 983\nInt'l Holdings, Inc. v. Haley, 2015 WL 5139606, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 1, 2015).  Specifically, \na party seeking discovery “must demonstrate the need to deviate from the normal timing of \ndiscovery.”  Arab Am. Civil Rights League v. Trump, 2017 WL 5639928, at *2 (E.D. Mich. \nMar. 31, 2017).  Some factors courts consider under the good cause standard include whether a \npreliminary injunction is pending, the breadth of the discovery requests, the purpose for the \nrequest, the burden to comply and how far in advance of the typical discovery process the \nrequest was made.  Id. \n  Plaintiffs show a sufficient need to conduct expedited discovery.  Plaintiffs are pretrial \ninmates with an increased risk of significant health issues, even death, if they contract COVID-\n19.  They allege constitutional violations that cannot be remedied if the worst occurs.  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs have a pressing reason to conduct a speedy probe into what health and safety measures \nDefendants are implementing at the Jail, and more generally how the medically vulnerable are \nbeing confined.  \n  Consider how some of the other factors under the good cause standard also favor \nexpedited discovery.  First, a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order is pending here.  See \nDegeeter v. McNeill, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105812, *8, 2007 WL 9706576 (noting that \nexpedited discovery may be appropriate “to the extent the discovery is necessary to support \nplaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction”).  The sole reason it is pending is because of an \nundeveloped factual record.  Second, the burden on Defendants to comply with the requests, with \ncertain exceptions discussed below, is relatively low.  Most of the written discovery Plaintiffs \nseek, such as testing information or Jail policies, should be readily available and easily produced.  \nWhile expedited discovery will undoubtedly burden Jail officials, ultimately, that burden is \ngreatly outweighed by a pressing need of further fact-finding.  See Trump, 2017 WL 5639928, at \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 6 of 8    PageID 984\n*2 (“An important inquiry in determining if good cause exists is whether the need for expedited \ndiscovery, in consideration of the administration of justice, outweighs the prejudice to the \nresponding party.”). \n  Also, the breadth of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests is largely tailored to their immediate \nfact-finding needs.  Interrogatories 1 and 2 relate to testing; the remaining two Interrogatories \nrelate to how inmates exposed to, or infected with, COVID-19 are housed.  RFPs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 \nrelate to the policies and medical measures at the Jail, including those implemented for curbing \nthe spread of COVID-19 in the facility; RFP 6 seeks a daily count of the Jail’s detainee \npopulation;  RFP 8 seeks production of documents that are provided to the Independent \nInspector.   \nWhether Defendants’ detention measures are “excessive”, or that they have been \n“deliberately indifferent” to pretrial inmates’ medical needs, as Plaintiffs allege, can likely be \nuncovered through these discovery requests.  See J.H. v. Williamson County, Tennessee, 951 \nF.3d 709, 717, 720-23 (2020).  Similarly, Plaintiffs’ proposed depositions and inspection of the \nJail also relate directly, with certain exceptions discussed below, to these constitutional and \nstatutory allegations.   \n  That an Independent Inspector will also provide an expert opinion on the current situation \nin the Jail does not preclude Plaintiffs’ discovery.  The Independent Inspector was appointed by \nthe Court, and is the Court’s witness—not either Party’s.  See Fed. R. Evid. 706 (governing the \nprocedure for court-appointed expert witnesses, and noting that “this rule does not limit a party \nin calling its own experts”).  It is with this in mind that the Court expressly stated that nothing \n“precludes either party from hiring its own expert to conduct its own inspection.”  (ECF No. 56.)  \nGiven that Defendants have virtually full access to the Jail, with the opposite being true for \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 7 of 8    PageID 985\nPlaintiffs, that Plaintiffs seek to inspect the Jail via its own expert should raise no eyebrows.  See \nNellson v. Barnhart, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98112, *9 (D. Colo. June 4, 2020) (noting that \nexpedited discovery may be appropriate “where discovery of certain facts is unusually difficult \nor impossible”).           \n  Defendants argue that the discovery requests focus on the conditions of confinement but \nthis petition is about the fact of confinement.  While it is true that Plaintiffs do not seek to alter \nthe conditions at the Jail, the Court must understand the Jail’s current conditions, as well as its \nresponses to the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess whether the fact of confinement violates the \nConstitution or the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Indeed, Plaintiffs must show that the \nconditions at the Jail are so constitutionally deplorable that “no set of conditions would be \nconstitutionally sufficient.”  Wilson v. Williams, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 14291, *4 (6th Cir. \n2020).  If Plaintiffs can prove their allegations through discovery, they may be entitled to release, \nthe relief appropriate for such a fact of confinement suit.  \nIII.  Limitation of Certain Requests \n \nPlaintiffs have good cause to conduct expedited discovery, with the exceptions outlined \nbelow.  See Branch Banking & Trust Co. v. Jones, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 204659, *24, 2018 \nWL 6331684 (E.D. Ky. Dec. 4, 2018) (“Courts may limit the scope of overbroad discovery \nrequests”).  If Defendants have specific objections to certain written discovery requests, e.g., on \nmedical privacy or attorney-client privilege grounds, the Parties must engage in good-faith \nconsultation before asking the Court to resolve any objection.  The Court hereby LIMITS the \nscope of the following discovery requests due to their overbroad nature: \n•  RFP 2’s scope is limited to the documents related to the Jail. \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 69   Filed 06/23/20   Page 8 of 8    PageID 986\n•  Plaintiffs may retain an expert to inspect the Jail, but that expert may not be \naccompanied by counsel during the inspection, nor may the expert take videos or \nphotos during the inspection.  Defendant shall provide the same courtesies and \nsupport to this inspector as they have or will to the Independent Inspector.        \nDefendants shall immediately begin responding to the written discovery, in rolling-\nbatches, until June 26, 2020.  For those requests which Defendants are genuinely unable to \nrespond to by June 26, they are to be responded to by June 29, 2020. \nPlaintiffs’ depositions and the proposed inspection will have to wait until after the July 1 \nhearing.    \nSCHEDULE \n \n  The Court recognizes the need to balance the Parties’ interest in gathering the facts they \nneed with the difficulties presented by the expedited nature of this case.  In that light, the Court \nORDERS the following deadlines: \n•  Defendants Produce Written Discovery:                June 24-29, 2020 \n•  Independent Inspector Hearing: (This hearing will only include the presentation of the \nindependent inspector.  No other proof may be offered.)

(D.E. 1, ¶¶ 7-8). \nPetitioners bring a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28. U.S.C. § 2241, asking this \nCourt to order them and a class of other detainees to be released from jail because of fear that they \nmay contact COVID-19. (D.E. 1).  In making their request, Petitioners allege there are specific \nconditions at the Shelby County Jail that make them susceptible to being infected by COVID-19.  \nFor example, they allege that during mealtimes, detainees are required to “line up inches apart.”  \n(D.E. 1, ¶ 30). They further claim that they must “use and reuse” the same “high-touch” items, \nsuch as telephones and kiosks, but that the jail does not provide disinfectant or other cleaning \nsupplies to sanitize these items. (D.E. 1, ¶ 31).  They also allege that the jail does not test enough \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 2 of 15    PageID 324\nnew arrestees for COVID-19 and worry that asymptomatic detainees could be infecting others. \n(D.E. 1, ¶ 32).  They further claim that on two occasions, detainees who had been exposed to \nCOVID-19 were “pepper sprayed.” (D.E. 1, ¶¶ 33-34).  Petitioners claim that by remaining in the \nShelby County Jail, their constitutional rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment are being \nviolated. (D.E. 1, ¶¶ 52-61).  They also claim that the Shelby County Jail is violating Title II of \nthe ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. (D.E. 1, ¶¶ 62-70).  \nSTANDARD \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must \nplead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Assuming they are true, a \nplaintiff’s allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \nARGUMENT \nA.  Petitioners’ Petition Must Be Dismissed Because Petitioners Have Not Exhausted \nState Law Remedies. \n \nIt is well-settled that “a state prisoner’s federal habeas petition should be dismissed if the \nprisoner has not exhausted available state remedies as to any of his federal claims.” Coleman v. \nThompson,  501  U.S.  722,  731  (1991);  Luedtke  v.  Berkebile,  704  F.3d  465,  466  (6th  Cir. \n2013); Graham v. Snyder, 68 F. App’x 589, 590 (6th Cir. 2003).  Thus, the Sixth Circuit has held \nthat although § 2241 “establishes jurisdiction in the federal courts to consider pretrial habeas \ncorpus petitions, the courts should abstain from the exercise of that jurisdiction if the issues raised \nin  the  petition  may  be  resolved  either  by  trial  on  the  merits  in  the state courts  or  by \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 3 of 15    PageID 325\nother state procedures available to the petitioner.” Atkins v. Michigan, 644 F.2d 543, 546 (6th Cir. \n1981); see  also, Bronston  v.  Sabbatine,  1993  U.S.  App.  LEXIS  29970  (6th  Cir.  Nov.  16, \n1993) (dismissing  § 2241 petition because petitioner had not exhausted his state court remedies \nprior to filing the petition); Martin-Trigona v. Shiff, 702 F.2d 380, 388 (2d Cir. 1983) (“[T]he writ \nof habeas corpus  is  not  a  substitute  for  a  regular  route  of  appeal.”).  The  requirement  that \na habeas petitioner exhaust state-court remedies before seeking relief in federal court “protect[s] \nthe state courts’ opportunity to confront initially and resolve constitutional issues arising within \ntheir jurisdictions and to limit federal judicial interference in state adjudicatory processes.” Atkins, \n644 F.2d at 546. \nImportantly, the petitioner has the burden of showing exhaustion. Rust v. Zent, 17 F.3d \n155, 160 (6th Cir. 1994).  When a petitioner cannot show that he has exhausted his administrative \nremedies, his habeas petition must be dismissed.  See e.g., Patton v. Bonner, 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 74470, *4-5 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 28, 2020) (dismissing a pretrial state detainee’s § 2241 \npetition when he failed to exhaust his state court remedies); Burke v. Hall, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n17774 (M.D. Tenn. Feb. 4. 2020) (denying without prejudice § 2241 habeas petition seeking \nimmediate release because it was “apparent on the face of Burke’s . . . petition that he did not \nexhaust his administrative remedies”); Greenwood v. Batts, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115875, *4 \n(W.D. Tenn. July 12, 2018) (dismissing a federal detainee’s § 2241 petition for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies); Reid v. Mackie, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123596, *7-8 (E.D. Mich. Oct. \n26, 2011) (dismissing a § 2241 petition because the petitioner failed to allege that he exhausted \nstate remedies). \nExhaustion requires a petitioner to “fairly present” federal claims so that state courts have \na “fair opportunity” to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon a petitioner’s \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 4 of 15    PageID 326\nconstitutional claim. O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 848 (1999); see also Picard v. Connor, \n404 U.S. 270, 275-77 (1971); Duncan v. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 365 (1995); Anderson v. Harless, \n459 U.S. 4, 6 (1982). To fulfill the exhaustion requirement, a petitioner must have fairly presented \nhis  federal  claims  to  all  levels  of  the state appellate  system,  including  the state’s  highest \ncourt. O’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845; Wagner v. Smith, 581 F.3d 410, 414 (6th Cir. 2009); Hafley v. \nSowders,  902  F.2d  480,  483  (6th  Cir.  1990). The  district  court  can  and  must  raise \nthe exhaustion issue sua sponte when it clearly appears that habeas claims have not been presented \nto the state courts. See Prather v. Rees, 822 F.2d 1418, 1422 (6th Cir. 1987); Allen v. Perini, 424 \nF.2d 134, 138-39 (6th Cir. 1970). \nIn light of these considerations, numerous District Courts in the Sixth Circuit have already \ndismissed similar habeas petitions in which petitioners sought release from confinement due to the \nCOVID-19 epidemic. See e.g., Williams v. Rapelje, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84609, *3 (E.D. Mich. \nMay 14, 2020) (dismissing § 2254 petition seeking relief based upon COVID-19 because the \npetitioner had not exhausted state law remedies); Makin v. Wainwright, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n76007, *2 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 30, 2020) (dismissing § 2241 petition seeking relief on the basis of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic for failure to exhaust state remedies); Simmons v. Warden, FCI-Ashland, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67855, *6 (E.D. Ky. Apr. 17, 2020) (denying without prejudice defendant’s \nhabeas petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, for immediate release due to COVID-19 for failure \nto exhaust administrative remedies); Petry-Blanchard v. Louis, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57146, *11 \n(W.D. Ky. Apr. 1, 2020) (dismissing § 2241 petition because the petition failed to demonstrate \nexhaustion of administrative remedies).  \nIn Makin, the Court dismissed an Ohio state prisoner’s petition for habeas relief due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic when he failed to plead that he exhausted his state law remedies prior to \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 5 of 15    PageID 327\nbringing suit.  Makin, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76007 at *2-4 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 30, 2020).  The Court \nexplained: \n[W]hether under § 2241 or § 2254, a state prisoner must demonstrate that he has \nexhausted his available state remedies before asserting a federal habeas corpus \nclaim. Collins v. Million, 121 F. App’x 628 (6th Cir. 2005). It is well-established \nthat an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a state prisoner may not be granted \nunless it appears that the petitioner has exhausted all “remedies available in the \ncourts of the State.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A); Hannah v. Conley, 49 F.3d 1193, \n1196 (6th Cir. 1995) (per curiam). “In other words, the state prisoner must give the \nstate courts an opportunity to act on his claims before he presents those claims to a \nfederal court in a habeas petition.” O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842, \n(1999). The requirement that a state prisoner exhaust available state remedies as to \nfederal claims prior to seeking federal habeas corpus relief is grounded in principles \nof comity. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 731, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. \n2d 640 (1991). In the federal system, states should have first opportunity to address \nand correct alleged violations of a state prisoner's federal rights. Id. \n \nIt is clear on the face on the Petition that Petitioner has not exhausted his state \nremedies as to the federal claims he asserts. Although Petitioner contends that \npursuing a grievance in the prison system would be futile (see Doc. No. 1 at ¶ 15), \nhe has not demonstrated that relief as to his claims is unavailable to him in the Ohio \ncourts. Petitioner cannot seek federal habeas corpus relief unless and until he has \nexhausted such relief. The state courts must have the first opportunity to address \nthe federal violations he asserts in connection with his state incarceration. \n \nId.  \nIn Money v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63599 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020), the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois likewise found that the plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust was fatal to their claims.  \nThere, plaintiffs filed a habeas petition in federal court seeking their release from incarceration \nalleging the prison setting made them (and other purported class members) vulnerable to COVID-\n19 and the only way to solve the problem was for release. Id. at *2. The court dismissed plaintiffs’ \nhabeas petition, holding that plaintiffs’ failed to raise their claims in the state courts prior to filing \nsuit in federal court. Id. at *21-22. The court noted that the state courts were available for \nemergency matters. Id at *21. Notably, the court held, “[T]o be sure, exhaustion requirements can \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 6 of 15    PageID 328\n(and should) be waived when relief is truly unavailable. But waiving them here - when state courts \nclearly were available...would turn the habeas system upside down.” Id. at *22.   \nTennessee courts are given explicit authority to release a pretrial detainee by setting certain \nconditions on release.  See Tenn. Code Ann. 40-11-116. Additionally, any time after the trial court \nsets bond, criminal defendants may – and often do – move the trial court to alter their bond or other \nconditions of their release.  Criminal defendants, before or after conviction, likewise have the right \nthe obtain review of an order from the trial court “granting, denying, setting, or altering conditions” \nof the defendant’s release. Tenn. R. App. P. 8(a); see also Tenn. Code Ann. 40-11-144. Habeas \nrelief is also available in Tennessee courts. Tenn. Code Ann. § 29-21-204. Further, while the \nTennessee Supreme Court has suspended most in-person proceedings in all state and local courts \nin Tennessee due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Court has not suspended in-person “proceedings \nnecessary to protect constitutional rights of criminal defendants including bond-related matters \nand plea agreements for incarcerated individuals.” See In re: Covid-19 Pandemic, No. ADM2020-\n00428 (Tenn. March 13, 2020). In fact, not at any time have such proceedings been suspended in \nthe state of Tennessee and they have continued in Shelby County.  Indeed, numerous criminal \npretrial defendants have sought release via motion due to COVID-19.  Additionally, on March 25, \n2020, the Tennessee Supreme Court entered another COVID-19 related order in which the Court \ndirected that each judicial district  \n[S]hall  develop  a  written  plan  to  affirmatively  address  issues  regarding  the \nincarceration of nonviolent offenders in furtherance of efforts to reduce the jail \npopulation, including but not limited to bond reductions or eliminations, deferred \nsentences, and suspended sentences. The presiding judge or the designee of the \npresiding judge of each judicial district shall submit its plan to the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts by the close of business on Monday, March 30, 2020, absent \nan extension granted by the Chief Justice. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 15    PageID 329\nSee In Re: COVID-19 Pandemic, ADM2020-00428 (Tenn. March 25, 2020).  Per the March 25, \n2020 order, each judicial district in Tennessee developed a written jail population reduction plan \nas directed by the Court. See In Re: COVID-19 Pandemic, ADM2020-00428 (Tenn. Apr. 27, \n2020).  As of March 13, 2020, the date of the Tennessee Supreme Court’s first order, the total \npopulation in county jails across the state stood at 27,169. By April 21, 2020, the overall county \njail population in Tennessee had decreased to 19,126. Id.  Said data reveals that state law remedies \nto obtain release from jail due to COVID-19 are available and are being used by criminal \ndefendants across the state of Tennessee. \nAbstention from the exercise of the habeas corpus jurisdiction is justified by the doctrine \nof comity, a recognition of the concurrent jurisdiction created by our federal system of government \nin the separate state and national sovereignties. Intrusion into state proceedings already underway \nis warranted only in extraordinary circumstances. Atkins, 644 F.2d 543 at 546. Importantly, \nSheriffs of Tennessee are not just county employees.  They are Tennessee constitutional officers. \nConstitution of Tennessee, Art. VII § 1; Smith v. Plummer, 834 S.W.2d 311, 313 (Tenn. 1991).  \nThe Sheriff’s duties are prescribed by over 100 Tennessee statutes.  See Ray v. Madison Cty., 536 \nS.W.3d 824, 841 (Tenn. 2017). Pursuant to their constitutional duties and Tennessee law, the \nSheriff must follow all “process and orders of the courts of record of [Tennessee].”  Tenn. Code \nAnn. § 8-8-201.  Sheriffs must also “[t]ake charge and custody of the jail of the sheriff’s county, \nand of the prisoners therein; receive those lawfully committed, and keep them personally, or by \ndeputies or jailer, until discharged by law.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-8-201(a)(3). They similarly have \nthe duty to see that the orders of the courts are enforced. Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-8-201(a)(1); Shorts \nv. Bartholomew, 278 S.W.3d 268, 281 (Tenn. 2009). Failure to obey any court process is grounds \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 8 of 15    PageID 330\nfor the Sheriff to be held in contempt of court and can even lead to civil liability. Tenn. Code Ann. \n§ 8-8-207.   \nHere, Petitioners ask this Court to order the Sheriff of Tennessee to violate his duties under \nthe Tennessee Constitution and Tennessee law by releasing inmates without appropriate orders \nfrom Tennessee Courts.  Such inquiries are clearly within the purview of the Tennessee state \ncourts, which are presiding over the Petitioners’ and proposed class members’ criminal charges, \nand the Shelby County Sheriff has a duty under the Tennessee Constitution and Tennessee law to \nfollow the directives of those courts.  Prior to bringing their Petition, Petitioners did not even \nattempt to begin to pursue any state law remedy, let alone exhaust their state law remedies prior to \nfiling their petition.1  Because Petitioners have failed to exhaust their state law remedies, this Court \nshould decline jurisdiction and the petition must be dismissed. \nB.  Plaintiffs’  Petition  Must  Be  Dismissed  Because  Petitioners  are  Challenging  the \nConditions of Confinement, Not the “Fact or Duration” of Confinement. \n \nA habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is typically “reserved for challenges to \nthe execution of a sentence, such as a computation of parole or sentencing credits....” Velasco v. \nLamanna, 16 F. App’x 311, 314 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Cohen v. United States, 593 F.2d 766, 770-\n71  (6th  Cir.  1979)); see Sullivan  v.  United  States,  90  F.  App’x  862,  863  (6th  Cir.  2004). \nAdditionally,  while  the  Sixth  Circuit  has  long  recognized  that  pretrial  detainees  may \npursue habeas relief under § 2241, pretrial detainees can do so only in rare, “extraordinary” \ninstances. Christian v. Wellington, 739 F.3d 294, 297 (6th Cir. 2014). In fact, the Sixth Circuit has \napproved consideration of a pretrial § 2241 petition only in three exceptional circumstances: (1) \nwhen the petitioner seeks a speedy trial, Atkins 644 F.2d at 546-47; (2) when a petitioner seeks to \n \n1 The Tennessee’s online Public Case History reveals that neither of the named petitioners has ever had a \ncase or motion pending before the Tennessee Court of Appeals.http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/courts/supreme-\ncourt/public-case-history \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 9 of 15    PageID 331\navoid a second trial on double jeopardy grounds, Delk v. Atkinson, 665 F.2d 90, 93 (6th Cir. 1981); \nand (3) when a petitioner faces prejudice from prior ineffective assistance of counsel and due \nprocess violations on retrial, Turner v. Tennessee, 858 F.2d 1201, 1204 (6th Cir. 1988), vacated \non other grounds, 492 U.S. 902, 109 S. Ct. 3208, 106 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1990).  \nWhile habeas corpus relief is available to pretrial detainees in the above-mentioned limited \ncircumstances, habeas corpus is never available to pre- or post-trial prisoners who are complaining \nonly about their conditions of confinement. See e.g., Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004) \n(constitutional claims that merely challenge the conditions of a prisoner’s confinement as opposed \nto the fact of his conviction or the duration of his sentence fall outside the “core” of habeas corpus); \nLuedtke v. Berkebile, 704 F.3d 465, 466 (6th Cir. 2013) (holding that “§ 2241 is not the proper \nvehicle for a prisoner to challenge his conditions of confinement.”); Sullivan v. United States, 90 \nF. App’x 862, 863 (6th Cir. 2004) (concluding, “§ 2241 is a vehicle not for challenging prison \nconditions, but for challenging matters concerning the execution of a sentence such as the \ncomputation of good-time credits.”); Boyce v. Ashcroft, 251 F.3d 911, 914 (10th Cir. 2001) \n(holding that a claim regarding a transfer to higher security prison related to conditions of \nconfinement was not cognizable under Section 2241), vacated as moot, 268 F.3d 953, 954 (10th \nCir. 2001); Schipke v. Van Buren, 239 F. App’x. 85, 86 (5th Cir. 2007) (holding that the petitioner’s \nclaims were outside scope of § 2241 motion where none of the claims raised by petitioner \nchallenged the fact or duration of her confinement and none, if prevailed on, would have entitled \nher to accelerated release). Even when a habeas petitioner alleges that inadequate conditions of \nconfinement create the risk of serious physical injury, illness, or death, a petition for a writ of \nhabeas corpus is not the proper vehicle for such a claim. See, e.g., Spencer v. Bragg, 310 F. App’x \n678, 679 (5th Cir. 2009) (affirming the lower court’s dismissal of petitioner’s habeas \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 10 of 15    PageID 332\nclaim even though he alleged that the conditions of confinement endangered his life). \nFurther, the Sixth Circuit has held that a writ of habeas corpus is not the proper vehicle to \nbring a deliberate indifference claim. Andrews v. Quintana, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 12096, *3 (6th \nCir. May 8, 2018) (finding that the petitioner’s claim that prison officials or employees were \ndeliberately indifferent was not cognizable in a § 2241 habeas petition).  Likewise, in Burton v. \nMcGlasson, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22642 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 24, 2014), the Eastern District of \nMichigan considered whether a petitioner can bring a deliberate indifference claim challenging his \nconditions of confinement. The Court held: \nWhere  a  prisoner  is  challenging  the  very  fact  or  duration  of  his  physical \nimprisonment and the relief that he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to \nimmediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment, his sole federal \nremedy is a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, \n500  (1973).  However,  habeas  corpus  is  not  available  to  prisoners  who  are \ncomplaining only of mistreatment during their legal incarceration. See Lutz v. \nHemingway, 476 F. Supp. 2d 715, 718 (E.D. Mich. 2007). Complaints like the ones \nraised by petitioner which involve conditions of confinement “do not relate to the \nlegality of the petitioner’s confinement, nor do they relate to the legal sufficiency \nof  the  criminal  court  proceedings  which  resulted  in  the  incarceration  of  the \npetitioner.” Id. (quoting Maddux v. Rose, 483 F. Supp. 661, 672 (E.D. Tenn. 1980)). \nA petition for writ of habeas corpus is not the proper vehicle for a prisoner’s claim \nthat prison officials have been deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, because \nrelease from custody is not an available remedy for a deliberate indifference claim. \nSee In re Owens, 525 Fed. App’x 287, 290 (6th Cir. 2013); Glaus v. Anderson,408 \nF. 3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2005); Hamilton v. Gansheimer,536 F. Supp. 2d 825, 841-\n42 (N.D. Ohio 2008). An inmate like petitioner should therefore bring his medical \nindifference claim as a civil rights complaint. Glaus, 408 F. 3d at 386-87. Because \npetitioner challenges only the conditions of his confinement, his claims “fall outside \nof the cognizable core of habeas corpus relief.” See Hodges v. Bell,170 Fed. App'x \n389, 393 (6th Cir. 2006). \n \nBurton, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22642, *1-3 (emphasis added). \nMore specifically, the Northern District Court of Ohio recently considered whether a \nhabeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 could be utilized to request immediate release from \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 11 of 15    PageID 333\nprison due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Barrett v. Carvajal, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84873 (N.D. \nOhio May 14, 2020).  In dismissing the petition, the Court explained: \nHere, Barrett seeks relief on basis of the “deteriorating conditions [at FCI Elkton] \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.” (Pet. at 1, 11.) Although he seeks relief in the \nform  of  immediate  release  from  prison—which  falls  within  the  ambit \nof habeas corpus  relief—the  basis  for  this  relief  is  clearly  grounded  in  his \nconditions of confinement at FCI Elkton and the alleged resulting constitutional \nviolations. Because Barrett does not challenge the execution of his sentence, § \n2241 is not the proper vehicle for his claims. See, e.g., Bolden v. Ponce, No. 2:20-\ncv-03870-JFW-MAA, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77249, 2020 WL 2097751, at *2 \n(C.D. Cal. May 1, 2020) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction § 2241 petition for \nimmediate release due to COVID-19 circumstances). \n \nBarrett, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84873 at *6-7.  \n  Likewise, the Northern District of Texas recently held that habeas was the improper vehicle \nfor pre-trial detainees to seek release from jail due to COVID-19. See Sanchez v. Dallas County, \n2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90667, *39 (N.D. Tex. May 22, 2020).  The Court explained: \nPublic safety concerns aside, habeas is not available to review questions unrelated \nto the cause of detention. Pierre v. U.S., 525 F.2d 933, 935 (5th Cir. 1976). Its sole \nfunction is to grant relief from unlawful imprisonment or custody, and it cannot be \nused properly for any other purpose. Id. at 935-36. An inmate is not entitled to relief \nin a habeas corpus petition based on civil rights claims related to the conditions of \nhis confinement. Cf. Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973). \n \nSanchez v. Dallas County, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90667, *39-40 (N.D. Tex. May 22, 2020). \n \n  Here,  as  in  Barrett  and  Sanchez,  Petitioners  complain  about  their  conditions  of \nconfinement, not the underlying reasons for their detention.  As set forth in their petition, \nPetitioners identify specific practices undertaken at the Shelby County Jail which they assert \nviolate their constitutional rights. (D.E. 1 ¶¶ 28-34). Even if Petitioners’ complaints are true, they \nrelate to conditions at the Shelby County Jail, not that their confinement was procured improperly \nor illegally.  To prove their alleged injuries, they have to show that Respondents acted with \n“deliberate indifference,” not that the underlying reasons for their incarceration are improper or \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 12 of 15    PageID 334\nillegal. Whatever their conditions of confinement, they are not related to Petitioners’ “fact or \nduration” of their respective confinements.  Thus, a habeas corpus petition under § 2241 is not the \nproper vehicle for Petitioners’ to present their claims.  \n  Importantly,  the  Sixth  Circuit  has  held  that  when  a  prisoner  asserts  conditions  of \nconfinement claims in a habeas corpus petition under § 2241, it is not appropriate for the court to \nattempt to re-characterize the claims. Instead, the court should dismiss the petition. Shah v. \nQuintana, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59608 at *3 (E.D. Ky. May 5, 2016) (citing to Martin v. Overton, \n391 F.3d 710, 714-15 (6th Cir. 2004)).  Accordingly, Petitioners’ petition should be dismissed. \nC.  If Petitioner’s Claims Are Cognizable, Then They Are Subject to the Requirements \nfor Relief in 18 U.S.C. § 3626. \n \nIf Petitioners’ claims challenging their conditions of confinement were cognizable in \nhabeas (they are not), then the Prison Litigation Report Act’s (“PLRA”) requirements for prisoner \nrelease orders must apply.  Santana v. United States, 98 F.3d 752, 756 (3d Cir. 1996) (“the PLRA \napplies to special proceedings like habeas corpus” where claims are analogous to typical suits \nbrought under § 1983); see also Blair-Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d 1036, 1040-42 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(where challenges to prison conditions “are permissibly brought in habeas corpus,” they would be \nsubject to the PLRA, “as they are precisely the sort of actions that the PLRA sought to address”), \nmodified by other grounds by reh’g, 151 F.3d 1036 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  “[I]t would defeat the \npurpose of the PLRA if a prisoner could evade its requirements by simply . . .joining it with a \npetition for habeas corpus.” See Blair-Bey, 151 F.3d at 1042. \nA federal court may not enter a prisoner release order unless there has been a prior order \n“for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be \nremedied through the prison release order,” and respondent “has had a reasonable amount of time \nto comply with the previous court order[].” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A). Moreover, only a three-\n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 13 of 15    PageID 335\njudge court may enter a prison release order and can only do so after a prisoner files an appropriate \nrequest.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(3). The three-judge panel may enter such an order “only if the court \nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that—(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of \na Federal right; and (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(3). Here, Petitioners have failed to satisfy obviously not satisfied any of these requirements. \nSee, e.g., Coleman v. Newsom, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62575 (E.D. Cal. April 4, 2020) (three-\njudge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2248 that denied the petitioners’ emergency motion to modify \npopulation reduction order due to COVID-19, noting that (1) prisoners must first go to single \nfederal judge who, if finding constitutional violation, “may order [prison authorities] to take steps \nshort of release necessary to remedy that violation; and (2) if lesser remedy “proves inadequate,” \n[petitioners] may return to convened three-judge panel to determine whether release order is \nappropriate under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)). \nHere,  Petitioners  should  not  be  allowed  to  circumvent  the  PLRA’s  unambiguous \nrequirements to obtain release.  Petitioners plainly complain about the current prison conditions of \nthe Shelby County Jail.  Such complaints fall squarely within the purview of the PLRA.  Because \nPetitioners have failed to comply with the PLRA prior to seeking release, their petition must be \ndismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Based upon the foregoing, the Petition should be dismissed in its entirety. \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 25-1   Filed 05/26/20   Page 14 of 15    PageID 336\nRespectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n      By:   s/Nathan D.

Brady, and I am the Director of the Criminal Justice Division for \nSabot Consulting. I am a nationally recognized expert in prison and jail operations, the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, and the prevention and mitigation of the spread of \ninfectious diseases and public health in the correctional setting from an operational and \nnon-clinical perspective.  \nOn June 18, 2020, in the matter of Busby V Bonner ( No. 2:20-cv-2359-SHL),  pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Evidence 706, United States District Judge For The Western District \nof Tennessee, Western Division, The Honorable  Sheryl H. Lippman, appointed me as the \nneutral  expert  witness  in  the  field  of  jail  and  prison  operations  as  it  relates  to  the \nprevention and mitigation of the spread of infectious diseases and public health in the \ncorrectional setting.  \nThe Inspection Order states in pertinent part: \n“…The appointed expert shall provide information to the Court responsive \nto Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (ECF No. 2) and \nrender an expert opinion on the current health and safety of medically-\nvulnerable Plaintiff-detainees at the Shelby County Jail (“the jail”) in light of \nthe Covd-19 pandemic, including but not limited to the Facility’s compliance \nwith the pertinent CDC and Shelby County Public Health guidelines and \nother applicable standards. The expert’s findings shall include, if warranted, \nrecommendations regarding corrective measures that, in his expert opinion,   \nshould be implemented at the jail, to protect the medically-vulnerable from \nthe COVID-19 virus at the facility….”  (See Inspection Order Filed On June \n18, 2020, attached as Exhibit 1) \nThe medically-vulnerable detainees to which the inspection order applies are defined as \nfollows: \n1.  People 65 years and older \n2.  People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma (including \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema, and \nchronic bronchitis), \n3.  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis; \n4.  People who have serious heart conditions (including heart failure, coronary \nheart disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary \nhypertension); \n5.  People who are immunocompromised (including cancer treatment, smoking, \nbone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled \nHIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune \nweakening medications); \n6.  People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher); \n7.  People with Diabetes; \n8.  People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis; \n  1   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 4 of 35    PageID 1076\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \n9.  People with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis; and \n10. People with hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease and \nthalassemia.    \n11. All persons currently or in the future held at the jail in pretrial custody during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic who are at increased risk of Covid-19 complications \nor death because of disabilities as defined in the Americans With Disabilities \nAct (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nIn order to have a better understanding of the contested facts of this case, I read the \npleadings  and  declarations  submitted  by  both  Petitioner-Plaintiffs  and  Respondent-\nDefendants. \nIn  addition,  I  requested  relevant  documents  from  Petitioner-Plaintiffs’  Counsel, \nRespondent-Defense Counsel, and Wellpath’s Counsel in advance of my unannounced \narrival at the Shelby County Pre-Detention Jail located at 201 Poplar Avenue, Memphis, \nTennessee, 38103.  \nIn  addition  from  0830hrs  until  approximately  2300hrs  for  three  consecutive  days,  I \nconducted multiple in depth interviews with key personnel for the Shelby County Jail,  \nkey personnel with the contract medical provider, WELLPATH , walked the decks on \neach floor of the jail, inspected each of the living units, dayrooms, common areas, \nshowers, toilets, medical clinic, intake/booking/release, interviewed staff and inmates on \nthe first (0600-1400hrs) and second watch (1400hrs-2200hrs), inspected the holding cells, \nthe court tunnel, the upstairs court holding cells, transportation vehicles, and from the \ncontrol center on the lower level observed inmates being escorted through the court  \ntunnel, placed in the holding cells, escorted upstairs to and from the General Sessions \nCourt and Criminal Courts, and back to through the tunnel toward their living units. \nI was very fortunate to have newly promoted Lieutenant Styles as my security escort and \nguide. She is intimately familiar with all aspects of the Shelby County Jail operations and \nwas responsible for the seamless scheduling of staff and inmate interviews, escorting me \nthrough any and all parts of the jail, gathering not only the documents I requested in \nadvance,  but  additional  documents  that  I  needed  as  a  result  of  my  interviews  and \nobservations  throughout  my  three  days  of    inspection.  She  was  my  security  escort, \nscheduler, facilitator, problem solver, and reservoir of knowledge, from 0830 to 2300hrs \nevery day of the three long days of my onsite inspection. We continue to communicate as \nneeded this weekend for any additional documents I may need or questions I need \nanswered as I pen this report. Without her assistance, it would have been impossible for \nme to have achieved the in depth understanding of all aspects of the Shelby County Jail \nOperations necessary to compete this inspection report. Thank you Lt. Styles. \nI also want to acknowledge the Chief  Fields, Assistant Chief Hubbard, Assistant Chief \nWard, Dr. Bruce Randolph, Dr. Judy Martin, Dr. Donna Randolph, Jeremy Sanders, Ms. \nGeeter,  Mischelle Best, and all their respective staff for allowing me to repeatedly take \ntime away from their busy schedules to answer my questions and provide me with the \ndocuments I needed to verify the policies, procedures and practices about which they \n    2   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 5 of 35    PageID 1077\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nspoke were in writing. They are consummate professionals who care deeply about the \ninmates in the Shelby County Jail. \nAt all times of the day or night, I had unrestricted access to key personnel and the jail \nfacility. Shelby County Jail command staff and Wellpath leadership were transparent, \nresponsive and open to new approaches in addressing the opportunities for improvement \nthat I discovered during my court ordered inspection.  \nIt is important to remember that during the course of my inspection, it was necessary for \nme  to  explore  potential  solutions  to  each  area  of  concern  I  identified  during  my \ninspection. Recommending corrective measures to the Court that are not practical or \ndoable would render my recommendations useless, a prolific waste of time, energy, and \nmoney. It was not my intent to usurp the authority of the Court or the interest of the \nparties in exploring those options, but rather to find meaningful, efficient, cost effective, \nand practical solutions to preventing and mitigating the spread of this highly contagious \nand  oftentimes  deadly  virus  among  the  vulnerable  population  housed  in  the  Shelby \nCounty Jail. \n    3   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 6 of 35    PageID 1078\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nTHE JAIL SETTING \nCounty Jail operations have many unique characteristics: \n§  Jails operate continuously, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \n§  Jails provide a wide spectrum of services, activities, and programs for inmates. \n§  Jails are high-risk settings where inmates are often dangerous to themselves and \nothers. \n§  Jail populations have a significant percentage of inmates with chronic diseases \nserious medical conditions, serious mental illness, and disabilities \n§  Jail populations can fluctuate widely throughout the year, and even on a day-to \nday basis.  \n§  Many jail inmates spend only a few hours in jail or a few days especially in light \nof the new bail statutes, pretrial release programs, and other court actions. \n§  Many other inmates remain in jail for months or years because of the serious \nnature of their charges or their inability to make even the lowest bail amount. \n§  Admission and release procedures require much staff effort, but the peak periods \nof admission are often difficult to anticipate (special events, parole/probation \nsweeps, gang sweeps, homeless camp sweeps, demonstrations, DUI checkpoints, \netc.). \n§  Extensive Documentation is required for all activities and procedures at the jail. \n§  Perimeter security and internal movement must be controlled at all times.  \n§  Supervision needs vary for different classifications of inmates.  \n§  Jail staff, administrators, and funding officials can be held liable for \nsubstandard/constitutional deficient jail operations and conditions. \n§  Transportation to and from outside medical appointments, inpatient \nhospitalizations are difficult to anticipate and staff. \n§  Jails now are one of the largest and most challenging mental health treatment \nfacilities in the country. \n§  The provision of quality medical care to an older, sicker, inmate population is \nincredibly expensive and challenging.  \nIn recent years, recruiting and maintaining adequate badge staff has been extremely \ndifficult and current events have exacerbated the problem. Many jails are short staffed \nand have to employ robust mandatory overtime initiatives that are unsustainable. \nCouple  these  challenges  with  the  current  attempts  to  limit  the  spread  of  the  highly \ncontagious and deadly Covid-19 virus in the Shelby County Men’s Pre-Detention Facility \n(hereinafter “the jail”), and it becomes exponentially more difficult. \n    4   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 7 of 35    PageID 1079\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nINSPECTION OBSERVATIONS - JUNE 23, 24, 25, 2020 \nIt goes without saying that these are extraordinarily difficult and dangerous times in \nwhich we find ourselves thrust today. Operating a large county jail such as the Shelby \nCounty Jail is challenging, complex, and labor intensive.  \nAttempting to prevent/mitigate/eradicate the Covid19 virus within the secure perimeter of \nthe  jail,  adds  an  additional  daunting  and  extraordinarily  labor  intensive  layer  of \nmultidisciplinary  work  that  must  be  implemented  with  precision,    armed  with  the \nflexibility to adapt to new discoveries, guidance and directives from the CDC and Public \nHealth in real time, and be monitored with hypervigilance to ensure its effectiveness. \nAs you can imagine, each county jail is unique and there is not a single Covid-19 \noperational response model that is effective for all jails. The core principals of social \ndistancing,  testing,  tracing,  and  isolation  must  be  present,  but  how  those  four  core \nprincipals  are  implemented  are  oftentimes  restricted  because  of  the  physical  plant, \npopulation size, and staffing. Shelby County is no different. \nOn Tuesday morning, June 23, 2020 at approximately 0730hrs, I notified my security \nescort, Lt.  Styles that I would be conducting my inspection of the Shelby County Jail and \nthat I would be arriving at the Shelby County Detention Facility at 0830. The date and \ntime of my inspection was unannounced until one hour prior to my arrival.  Lt. Styles met \nme at a secure parking lot off Washington Street and we entered the jail through the \nemployee entrance. I was wearing a surgical mask, and Lt. Styles was wearing a mask as \nwell. \n    5   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 8 of 35    PageID 1080\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nCOVID-19 SCREENING FOR EMPLOYEES \nImmediately  upon  entering  the  jail  outside  the  secure  perimeter,  there  was  an \nemployee/contractor screening table. I was asked to fill out a “Coronavirus Screening” \nquestionnaire which posed the following questions: \n1.  In the past 14 days, have you been outside of the United States and/or, on a \ncruise or been in contact with anyone who has? Yes_ No_ If so, When___ \nWhere___ \n2.  In the past 14 days have you been in crowded areas, (for example Airports, \nConferences, Concerts, etc.)  YES__NO__ If so, When__ Where__ \n3.  Have you or anyone you have had close contact with been diagnosed with or \nquarantined for Coronavirus? (The incubation period is 2-14 days)  \nYES__NO__ \n4.  Do you have a fever, cough, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, headache, loss of \ntaste or smell or symptoms of lower or upper respiratory illness? YES__ \nNO__ \nMy temperature was taken and recorded on the questionnaire.  \nAt the bottom of the questionnaire, the final statement was “If answered yes to any of the \nquestions above, please see the immediate Supervisor of the area.” \nThe Supervisor of the area cleared me for entry into the secure perimeter of the jail. \nWhile in the employee screening area, I paused and observed several employees enter the \nfacility  through  that  entrance  and  all  were  wearing  face  masks,  filled  out  the \nquestionnaire and had their temperatures taken. I was provided with the temperature logs \nfrom the employee screening area for the last 90 days.  \nThis is the process that was followed each day that I entered the facility at 0830hrs. On \ndays two and three, I was not escorted by Lt. Styles, but I followed the same routine.  Lt. \nStyles was already on the premises and came out from the secure perimeter to get me \neach morning and evening on days two and three. \nEach  day  of  my  inspection,  I  paused  in  the  employee  screening  area  to  observe \nemployees entering the jail. 99.9 percent of the employees who entered the area were \nproperly wearing their masks, had their temperature taken and filled out the questionnaire. \nOn day two of my Inspection, I observed two men in street clothes enter the screening \narea who were not wearing masks, did not practice social distancing, and were not issued \nmasks prior to going in to the secure perimeter of the facility.  The security officer in \ncharge of the secondary screening area did not stop them from entering the facility with \nno masks.  \nOnce inside the secure perimeter of the building, I met with Chief Jailer Fields, and \nAssistant Chief of Security Hubbard to get a better sense of how their jail operated on a \nday to day basis, and to discuss some of the challenges they faced from their perspective \nin combating the spread of the Coronavirus in their facility. I found both Chief Fields and \n    6   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 9 of 35    PageID 1081\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nAssistant Chief Hubbard to be welcoming, transparent, cooperative, and openminded. I \nwas presented with two binders of documents that I had previously requested responsive \nto items 1-15 in the Inspection Order signed by Judge Lipman. At the conclusion of this \nreport I will list the documents that I reviewed as part of this Inspection. \nWe were then joined by Dr. Judy C. Martin, PhD, NP-BC, Chief of Nursing for the \nShelby County Health Department, and Jeremy R. Sanders, MPA, the Health Services \nAdministrator for Wellpath for the Shelby County Jail. I spoke with them and let them \nknow how I intended to conduct my inspection over the next several days. \nAfter I met with the Jail Command Staff, I ask to see the entire jail facility from an \ninmate’s arrival through the Sally Port through release. Over the course of the next \nseveral days, I would meet with and ask questions of a variety of key jail personnel, \nShelby County Health leadership, and Wellpath leadership as well as inspect all parts of \nthe jail in which vulnerable inmates and inmates with disabilities were housed, held or \nmoved to and from (medical, mental health appointments, pill call, and court) \nDr. Martin and Mr. Sanders wished to accompany me on the first day, and I welcomed \nthem because I wanted them to see what I saw in real time, and it was more efficient to \nhave  healthcare  leadership  present  to  answer  any  healthcare  related  questions  about \nwhich Lt. Styles might not be intimately familiar. \n    7   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 10 of 35    PageID 1082\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nINTAKE/BOOKING/RELEASE \nI began my inspection in the Intake/Booking area and the sally port where all law \nenforcement are required to bring arrestees for screening and booking. \n24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year all arresting agencies who enter the sally \nport are required to keep the inmate in the agency vehicle until it is there turn to present \nthe arrestee for a pre-booking Covid19 healthcare screening.  They are asked a series of \nhealthcare  questions  about  any  symptoms  that  they  may  be  experiencing  related  to \nCovid19 and they are administered a temperature strip which is then passed back through \na glass barrier to the nurse on the other side.  \nIf the inmate is asymptomatic, they are issued a mask and placed in a holding cell inside \nthe secure perimeter and they go through the normal booking process. The inmate is \nsearched,  photographed,  fingerprinted,  and  interviewed  by  pretrial  services.  Pretrial \nServices administers a new Public Safety Assessment tool along with the old assessment \nquestionnaire  to  determine  if  the  inmate  is  eligible  for  release  on  his  or  her  own \nrecognizance (ROR) or if he or she will have a bond set by the Commissioner. The bond \nis set within the first 24 hours.  \nIf they are not eligible for ROR, the inmate will be dressed out, processed through \nclassification and housed in a general population isolation unit that is cohorted for 21 \ndays. (Lower Level A-G)   \nIf the inmate is symptomatic, the inmate is escorted immediately over to a tent area on \nthe far end of the Sally Port, and healthcare staff and security staff come out in full \nhazmat PPE and conduct a more in depth healthcare screening to determine if the arrestee \nis suitable for confinement (Not in acute respiratory distress or suffering from some other \nmedical  condition  that  requires  the  inmate  to  be  transferred  to  the  ER  at  Region1 \nMedical).  If the inmate is suitable for confinement, the inmate is placed in full PPE \nincluding a hazmat jumpsuit, booties, facemask and eye protection and escorted to a \nmedical quarantine area where he will remain for 21 days. Inmate is tested immediately \nwith the nasal pharyngeal test for Covid19. The positive inmates’ temperatures are taken \ndaily, for 21 days, but no other Covid19 tests are performed. Wellpath uses a non-test \nbased  strategy  for  asymptomatic  and  symptomatic  inmates.  Inmates  must  remain  in \nmedical isolation for 21 days prior to being released to general population. \nIf an inmate is symptomatic, his clothing is placed in a hazmat bag and disposed of as \nhazardous material.  \nDuring the course of my inspection and multiple observations of the booking area, I \nwitnessed an inmate being booked into the jail who was not wearing a mask and the \narresting officer had his mask down below his nose. The inmate was allowed to enter the \ninterior of the booking area without a mask and was placed in a holding cell. The inmate \nwas without a mask for a significant portion of the booking process. Lt. Styles was \npresent when I made this observation. \n    8   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 11 of 35    PageID 1083\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nMoreover, we observed at least one officer with his mask down around his chin when he \nentered the booking area, and, on another occasion, down below his nose. \nEpisodic violations of the health screening process, and the mask policy for inmates and \nstaff creates an undue risk of harm to the vulnerable inmates who are processed through \nthe booking area.  \nI also inquired about the cleaning process for the intake/booking area and it was learned \nthat while the common areas and phone banks are cleaned every hour, the holding cells \nare only cleaned at the beginning of the shift and one or two additional times. This \npractice while important, is insufficient to protect subsequent vulnerable inmates from an \nunreasonable risk of exposure to the virus as a result of a potentially asymptomatic \npositive inmate contaminating the hard surfaces in the holding cells, the phones, the \ntoilets in the holding cells (we know that there have been at least two studies that suggest \nthat the virus can be shed through stool and urine but further studies are needed).  I do \nwant to note that this jail would be considered very clean in normal times. The floors are \npolished, the walls are clean, the empty cells are free of debris, human waste, and the \ntoilets appear to be clean. It is obvious that the Command Staff go to great lengths to \nkeep this older jail clean.   \n    9   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 12 of 35    PageID 1084\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nMEDICAL \nThe next area I inspected was the medical clinic area. There is no Outpatient Housing \nUnit or Infirmary in the jail. Anyone requiring those services must be transported to an \noutside facility. The Wellpath staff conduct regular sick call and during this time of crisis \nuse Telemedicine for much of their Physician appointments. I observed the clinic area \nand spoke with several nurses. The area was clean and I observed inmates being seen in \nthe  clinic  and  via  telemedicine  including  on  HIV  patient  communicating  with  his \nphysician via telemedicine. All participants were wearing appropriate PPE and were \nproperly social distancing.  I note that during the course of my three-day inspection, I did \nnotice episodic violations of the mask policy by healthcare workers. \nI also observed pill call on the housing units and noticed that there we newly installed \nmarkers for social distancing along the corridor where pill call is conducted. The inmates \non the occasion of my inspection were properly social distanced and were wearing masks. \nWhile I observed some episodic violations of the mask policy by inmates having their \nmasks down below their nose, staff was quick to direct the inmate to put the mask over \ntheir nose. In each case, the inmate complied.  \nWhen asked about outside specialty appointments for Chronic Diseases and Serious \nMedical Conditions, Wellpath’s Medical Director, Dr. Donna Randolph told me that \nRegion1health were not accepting appointments from the jail for several months during \nthe Covid19 pandemic, but they have recently started accepting appointments again. She \nstated  that  it  is  still  a  challenge  to  get  inmates  in  need  of  specialty  care  regular \nappointments because Region1health only accepts appointments for inmates one day a \nweek and that single day must accommodate inmates from the Shelby County Penal Farm \nand the Federal Detention Facility located in Shelby County. There is a dialysis clinic \nthat occurs at the jail regularly and the dialysis patients have not experienced any delays \nin their care.  I spent a considerable amount of time with Dr. Randolph and Mr. Sanders \nand I found them to be well informed and passionate about delivering competent medical \ncare to the inmate population. The care that is delivered by Wellpath is hampered by \nreliance on resources they cannot control and as a result inadequate chronic care and \nspecialty care may be occurring.  \n    10   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 13 of 35    PageID 1085\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nMENTAL HEALTH \nThere is a housing unit for inmates who are suicidal and are on fifteen-minute checks. \nHowever, if any behavioral health inmate would be in need of more intensive care, they \nwould have to be transported to an outside hospital.  One practice that concerns me for \nthis vulnerable population is that all inmates on 15-minute checks are issued suicide \nresistant smocks rather than following the best practice of evaluating the need for a \nsmock on a case by case basis. The blanket policy of issuing smocks to everyone will \ndiscourage  some  inmates  from  revealing  their  suicidality  because  they  don’t  want \neverything taken from them and to be stuck in a smock. Inmates view this as punitive. I \nspoke  with  the  Mental  Health  Director  Ms.  Geeter  regarding  this  issue.  The  SMI \npopulation is part of the vulnerable population as disabled inmates. This population more \noften than not has co-morbid medical conditions that require monitoring and treatment. \nDr. Randolph and Ms. Geeter assured me that the SMI population are getting their labs \ndone in a timely fashion (as I understand it some of the psychotropic medications can \ncause  liver  and  kidney  problems  as  well  as  significant  weight  gain)  Wellpath  has \ncontracted with Lindsay Hayes, a nationally recognized expert on Suicide Prevention, \nand Mr. Hayes was scheduled to return to the jail for a follow up visit, but because of the \nCovid19 he has been unable to return to the jail. \nI was pleased to observe several suicide resistant cells in this unit. These cells have \neliminated the tie off points that are commonly used by inmates who are attempting to \ncommit suicide. 90% of the suicides that take place in a jail setting are by hanging.  The \nMental Health Director, Ms. Geeter, personally trains security staff and non-security staff \non suicide prevention practices. Ms. Geeter also uses Lindsay Hayes’s suicide prevention \nmanual and curriculum. The initial training is between six to eight hours (depending on \nthe number of questions asked during the session) and the refresher training is two hours. \nWellpath does not have a formal structure to their mental health delivery system, but \nWellpath does employ one full time Psychiatrist, one half time Psychiatrist, several \nLMSWs, LPCs, LSWs, and one Psychiatric NP. \nThere  are  about  200  behavioral  health  inmates  on  the  second  floor,  and  there  are \napproximately  150  more  higher  functioning  behavioral  health  inmates  scattered \nthroughout the jail. Many of those inmates are on medication management only, but Ms. \nGeeter’s team does not have a formal treatment program structure, but does deliver basic \nmental health services, special needs services, individual therapy, and crisis management \nand assessment.  \nOne concern that I have is that Wellpath does not employ a Clinical Psychologist to \nformally test for Developmental Disabilities(DD) and Learning Disabilities(LD). The DD \npopulation who are in need of higher adaptive support are subject to victimization (sexual \nassault, other inmates stealing their commissary, carry drugs and weapons for gangs) and \nhave  short  term  memory  problems,  difficulty  understanding  directions,  forgetting  to \nshower, wash their hands, clean their cells, eat, etc.  Ms. Geeter told me that anyone who \nis suspected of being DD is seen by a psychiatrist. The DD population can be as large as \n    11   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 14 of 35    PageID 1086\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \ntwo to four percent of the inmate population (38-76 inmates) with a much smaller number \nbeing profoundly DD requiring high adaptive supports and protection from victimization.   \nThere is no formal testing that occurs for the LD population. Learning Disabled inmates \ndo not want people to know that they cannot read, write, or have trouble understanding \nwords, sentences and documents with which all of us may not struggle. It is important \nthat effective communication is used with this population and that means using simpler \nwords, talking slower, explaining the Covid19 education materials to them, etc. Equally \nimportant for them to have equal access to the programs, services, and activities  in the \njail, Wellpath must screen for and identify this population to make sure that security staff \nand program staff are effectively communicating with them, that they understand the \nCovid19 education materials and that they rules and regulations of the jail.  The LD \npopulation while not medically vulnerable, they are disabled as defined by the ADA, and \nare entitled to accommodations for their disabilities. \nI spoke with Ms. Jackson who oversees the crisis unit where suicidal patients are housed. \nShe is very passionate about her job and has a very good relationship with the inmates in \nher unit. The time constraints around this inspection prevented me from spending more \ntime with her and learning more about her unit.  \nMs. Geeter and Ms. Jackson clearly care about this very vulnerable population and do \ntheir best to ensure the inmates in the Behavioral Health Delivery System are properly \ntreated.  \nMy next area of inspection was the housing units themselves. Lt. Styles, Dr. Martin, Mr. \nSanders and went to all the living units together on the first day, and then Lt. Styles and I \nwent back to the living units to interview inmates from the list of vulnerable inmates and \ninmates with disabilities the following two days. The vulnerable inmates/ADA inmates \nwho are the subject of this Court ordered inspection are scattered throughout the jail in all \nsecurity levels on all floors. \n    12   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 15 of 35    PageID 1087\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nMEDICAL ISOLATION LOWER LEVEL PODS A-K \nIn their Covid-19 response policies, procedures and practices, Wellpath and the jail \nrepresent that asymptomatic newly incarcerated inmates are medically isolated for 21 \ndays  and  then  released  to  general  population  living  units  commensurate  with  their \nsecurity level. \nHowever, I was told by several inmates that I interviewed that these newly incarcerated \ninmates do not remain in medical isolation from the rest of the population for 21 days as \nthe Covid-19 response policy and booking flow chart represents.  \nAllegedly, throughout the 21 days the inmates are intended to be isolated from the rest of \nthe jail population in order to prevent the introduction of the Covid-19 virus into the jail, \nthey are required to be moved from their isolation units through the court tunnel and into \nholding cells for the General Sessions Courts and the Criminal Courts of Shelby County. \nThe medically isolated inmates are mixed in the Division specific holding cells with 20-\n25 other general population inmates from throughout the jail for up to 4 hours. This \noccurs in the morning and afternoon multiple times a week. Most of the time, according \nto the inmates I interviewed, the inmates do not leave the holding cell or they are directed \nto walk up the stairs to the court hallway where they are handed a piece of paper and told \ntheir case has been reset for another date. The inmates then walk back down the stairs \nback through the court tunnel returning to their living units in the jail and the medical \nisolation units on the lower level.  \nIn order to determine that this was actually occurring, during court hours, I went to the \ncontrol booth in the lower level that keeps the court tunnel, the lower level holding cells, \nand the stairs to the courtrooms under constant camera surveillance. While in that control \nbooth with Lt. Styles and the control booth security officer, I could see the constant \ninmate movement through the court tunnel to and from the holding cells. In the holding \ncells there were approximately 20-25 inmates in one, 16 in another, and 6 in another.  I \nobserved some inmates were not wearing their masks. I observed inmates walking up and \ndown the stairs to the courtrooms. I saw that there was no social distancing in two of the \nthree holding cells.  I observed some security staff were not properly wearing their masks \nin the tunnel.  \nOnce I verified this practice, I circled back and spoke with Chief Fields, Assistant Chief \nHubbard, Dr. Donna Randolph, and Mr. Jeremy Sanders. All verified that this was taking \nplace shared my concern about the practice, but felt they had no control over how the \ncourt handles their calendar and appearances.  \nThis  practice  unquestionably  puts  vulnerable  inmates  and  the  ADA  inmates  at  an \nunreasonable risk of harm from potential expose to asymptomatic Covid-19 positive \ninmates. Without an immediate change to this practice, it clearly renders any attempts to \nmedically isolate asymptomatic newly incarcerated inmates from the rest of the jail \npopulation  ineffective  and  of  little  value.  The  risk  of  infecting  other  inmates  and \nintroducing the Covid-19 virus into the general population of the jail is high. \n    13   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 16 of 35    PageID 1088\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nIt should be noted that on the lower level there are two holding cells that have video \nhearing capability for the courts. Those holding areas are LLR and LLS.  \n    14   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 17 of 35    PageID 1089\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nFLOORS 1-6 \nWhile the pleadings and declarations I read in preparation for my inspection imply that \nnothing special is done for the vulnerable inmate population. During my inspection, I \nbecame aware that medical does have several small living units on the 2nd floor where \nthey house medically fragile inmates (2B-2E, 2J, 2K, 2L). These inmates are medically \nfragile/ vulnerable inmates who need more intensive observation and treatment. The \nmedical offices are on this floor.  The ingress and egress to this unit is controlled, and \nmedical has to approve anyone who is to be housed in this area. This area has a limited \nnumber of beds and currently is at capacity. During the course of my inmate interviews \non this floor, several inmates complained that social distancing is not possible and that \nthe living area, showers, and bathroom was dirty.  After my interview with the inmates \nwhich occurred outside the living area for privacy reasons, I went into the living unit with \nLt. Styles and we inspected the area for cleanliness. Lt. Styles and I both observed the \nliving area and the bathroom to be in need of cleaning. Lt. Styles immediately directed \nstaff to clean that living unit and bathroom. It is the policy of the jail that all inmates must \nwear masks and for the most part they were wearing masks, but some did not have masks \non or they had the mask down below their nose.  Individuals with COPD who have \ndifficulty breathing are going to resist wearing these masks all the time because they \nrestrict their breathing even further. \nThe third-floor houses Level 7 inmates and some Level 5 and 6 inmates. Given the \ncurrent population levels in these units, it is not currently possible to property social \ndistance under the current program structure. Most of the Pods have 35-38 inmates in a \nPod with a capacity of 43.  \nThe jail’s current policy directive is that all inmates are to receive free soap and that soap \nis not to be confiscated if the inmates have more than one bar. The vulnerable inmates \nthat I interviewed complained that if they have money on their books, the housing \nofficers will not allow them to have free soap. The inmates complained that it is not \npossible to social distance because the dayroom is crowded with 20 or so inmates at a \ntime. In one of my multiple interviews with Chief Fields across several days, I asked him \nabout this and he told me that they inmates can have free soap by policy. I also noted that \nin these living units, there were hand sanitizer dispensers installed on the walls, but the \ninmates told me they could not access the hand sanitizer because it is behind the officer’s \ndesk which is out of bounds for inmates. The inmates did verify that recently there has \nbeen an increased effort to clean the living units more frequently. During my three days \nof inspection, I did observe a cleaning crew under the direction of Mr. Dwayne Johnson \nwith biovex sprayers on their backs cleaning common areas throughout the jail. The \ninmates stated they were given cleaning supplies but the mops they were given to clean \ntheir cells were mops that everybody else had just used to clean their cells and they were \nconcerned about cross contamination.  \n \nThe fourth-floor houses Level 8 and 9 inmates, high profile inmates, overflow suicide \nwatch, and two program pods. These living units are at or near capacity making social \n    15   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 18 of 35    PageID 1090\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \ndistancing impossible under the current dayroom use policy. At least twenty inmates are \nout in the dayroom area together during dayroom time, and the tables only seat 4 inmates. \nThroughout my inspection tour I observed inmates out in the dayroom and although 99 \npercent were wearing masks, there just is insufficient room to properly social distance. \nThe vulnerable inmates that I interviewed had similar complaints regarding free soap, and \nsocial distancing. The inmates did acknowledge the stepped-up cleaning of the common \nareas in the last several weeks. The hand sanitizer dispensers were located behind the \nsecurity officer’s desk and in an area that is out of bounds for inmates.  \nThe fifth floor is a dormitory floor consisting of three units of 32 bunks totaling 64 beds \neach. 5A houses inmates with security levels of 1-5. 5B is a program dorm of 32 bunks \ntotaling 64 beds. 5C houses security levels 5-6 and has 32 bunks totaling 64 beds. Each of \nthese dormitories were not at capacity. It appeared they were at about 50 – 60 percent of \ncapacity. There was some social distancing in these units but there were two to a bunk, \nand  the  occupied  bunks  did  not  always  have  a  vacant  bunk  in  between  them.  The \nvulnerable inmates I interviewed in these units had similar complaints regarding the \navailability  of  free  soap,  social  distancing,  and  cleaning  supplies.  The  living  units \nappeared to be clean. The inmates acknowledge a recent increase in the frequency of the \ncleaning of the common areas. The inmates told me that the jail had just put in the social \ndistancing markers in the pill call line and on the floors of the living units just last week. I \nobserved the inmates wearing their masks but not universally. The some of the inmates \non all floors complained about their masks falling apart. They acknowledged that the jail \ncleaning crews offered to disinfect their masks with the disinfectant, but they did not \nwant them to do it because of the chemical smell and it takes a while for the mask to dry.  \nThe sixth floor is a dormitory floor that consists of 3 living units of 32 bunks and 64 beds. \nIt is currently empty. This area can house inmates who have security levels from 1-7.  \n    16   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 19 of 35    PageID 1091\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nPOPULATION MANAGEMENT \nAs of June 29, 2020, the inmate population of the Shelby County Jail is 1854 inmates. \nThe jail has a capacity of 2600. The jail currently books 38 inmates a day on average and \nreleases 24 inmates a day on average. The jail is an older jail that was built in the 1980’s \nand as a result, most of the cell doors are open bars are the top and are operated \nelectronically  via  a  control  panel  and  Folger  keys.    Approximately  8  different  law \nenforcement departments within Shelby County book arrestees in the jail. Additionally, \nsurrounding counties will request that the jail take some of their inmates when they reach \ncapacity. The jail also currently houses Tennessee Department of Correction inmates who \ncome back to Shelby County for court matters. \nReducing the population of the jail in these unprecedented times is a challenge. The jail \nas a matter of law cannot refuse to book an arrestee who is medically fit for incarceration \nnor does the Sheriff have the authority to release inmates to alternative forms of custody \nsuch as active GPS, supportive housing in the community, shelters, recovery homes, \nhome detention, work release, etc. The authority to do that rests solely with the Shelby \nCounty Court. Currently the jail has a case expeditor to try and move cases along, but \nfrom my observations during my inspection the current practice of the Shelby County \nCourts and the attorneys representing the inmates is creating a significant backlog that is \ncontributing to the size of the jail population. Cases are being postponed multiple times \nfor lengthy periods of times allegedly without the consent or time waiver of the inmates. \nThe inmates are not being provided their discovery packets until months after their arrest \nand detention. Attorneys are not visiting their clients and discussing their cases. Offers \nare  not  being  made  in  an  effort  to  resolve  cases.  The  vulnerable  inmates  that  I \ninterviewed during my inspection complained about the lack of information. The failure \nof their defense attorneys to visit them. The failure of their attorneys to consult with them \nregarding waiving their constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court allegedly is \nrefusing to release inmates who are committed non-violent crimes and are not a current \nthreat  to  public  safety.  Defense  attorneys  are  allegedly  failing  to  present  medical \nevidence of their client’s serious medical condition to the court that would demonstrate \nthe inmate is not currently a threat to public safety or to argue for placement in alternative \nforms  of  custody.  They  cannot  present  the  evidence  because  they  allegedly  are  not \nmeeting with their clients and gathering the necessary evidence to present to the court.  \nIn addition, the Tennessee Department of Correction is not accepting inmates who have \nbeen convicted and sentenced to prison. The jail houses state prison inmates who are \nback from prison to resolve some outstanding court matters.  \nMoreover, towns in Shelby county bring inmates to the jail when their jail reach capacity, \nand surrounding counties also bring inmates to the jail when their jails are allegedly at \ncapacity.  \nAs a result, the population continues to remain in the mid eighteen-hundreds with little \nroom to enforce social distancing within the living units in the jail.  \n    17   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 20 of 35    PageID 1092\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nSTAFFING SHORTAGES \nCurrently  the  jail  has  157  security  staff  vacancies  and  the  Sheriff’s  Department  is \nexperiencing difficulty in their recruitment efforts to fill those vacancies. In addition, a \nrecent staffing study that was completed found that the actual need for security staff is \nover 300 positions. Having significant staffing shortages like these is a contributing \nfactor to consistently providing routine service to the vulnerable inmates in the jail. \n \n \n \n    18   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 21 of 35    PageID 1093\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nThese findings and recommendations are not in order of importance. \n \n \nFINDING #1 \n \nThe Wellpath Covid-19 response plan is inadequate to protect the vulnerable inmates \nhoused in the Shelby County Jail for the following reasons: \n \n1.  The  newly  booked  inmate  movement  from  medical  isolation  to  the  General \nSession  and  Criminal  Courts  and  then  back  to  the  medical  isolation  unit \ncompletely undermines the integrity and purpose of the 21-day medical isolation \nthat is designed to prevent the introduction of the Covid-19 virus into the jail \npopulation. The medically isolated Inmates are held in holding tanks in large \ngroups with general population inmates for long periods of time (2-4 hours) \nmultiple times in the 21-day isolation period. The medically isolated inmates are \nnot tested at any time during their 21 day stay if they remain asymptomatic, nor \nare the inmates from general population who were already housed in the jail, but \nwho  have  been  exposed  to  a  potentially  positive  asymptomatic  inmate  from \nmedical isolation in the court holding tanks.  This presents an unreasonable risk of \nharm to the medically vulnerable inmates who are held in the holding tanks with \nthe asymptomatic medically isolated inmates.  \n \n2.  Through no fault of Wellpath, their timed out non-testing strategy designed to \nprevent  the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the jail, is rendered ineffective and \nuseless as a result of the Court’s insistence on the presence of the medically \nisolated inmates in court or near court during the newly booked inmate’s 21 day \nmedical isolation. \n \n3.  The jail does not cluster the vulnerable inmates in housing units together away \nfrom the general population. Wellpath does attempt to cluster the most medically \nfragile and vulnerable inmates in the medical area on the second floor, but the \nspace is limited and the number of vulnerable inmates who are considered to be in \na high-risk group is around 300 inmates.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #1 \n \n1.  It is recommended that Wellpath move to 14-day medical isolation with a nasal \npharyngeal test-based strategy for symptomatic and asymptomatic inmates who \nare newly booked in the jail. The tests should occur between day 3 and day 6 for \nthe initial test, and between day 10 and day 12 for the second test. All inmates in \nmedical isolation must be asymptomatic for two consecutive days subsequent to \n    19   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 22 of 35    PageID 1094\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nthe  final  test  results  being  received  before  they  can  be  released  to  general \npopulation.  \n \n2.  It is recommended that Wellpath and the jail command staff identify living units \nwhere the vulnerable population can be sequestered away from the rest of the \ngeneral  population  inmates  without  losing  their  privileges  or  dayroom  time \nconsistent with their security level. The most medically fragile inmates and the \ninmates that are at the highest risk of serious illness or death if they contract the \nCovid-19 virus should be housed near the medical unit in case there is a white \nalarm. Areas that could be considered are the third floor and the Annex. Custody \nmight be able to open the sixth floor living units which have 192 beds for the \nLevel 7 inmates currently housed on the 3rd floor, and move some 3rd floor \ninmates from the third floor to the empty cells in the Annex.  \n \nFINDING #2 \n \n1.  Wellpath and the jail command staff have no authority to compel the court to \ndiscontinue the practice of insisting on inmate’s personal appearances in, at, or \naround the General Sessions Court or Criminal Court for initial appearances or to \nhave their matters set over to another date. This practice increases the risk of \ninmate  exposure  and  court  personnel  to  Covid-19  infection  because  of  the \nclustering of inmates in large holding cells and personal court appearances. \n \nRECOMMENDATION #2 \n \n1.  Consult with Dr. Bruce Randolph, Shelby County Health Officer, to see if he \nwould  be  amenable  to  adding  detention  facilities  to  Shelby  County  Health \nDirective #7 or issuing a separate health directive for detention facilities in Shelby \nCounty. The language in the directive could read that “Any person detained in a \ndetention facility should be isolated from the rest of the inmate population for 14 \ndays if they are not eligible for ROR and cannot make bond. If the detained \nperson is eligible for ROR or can make bond, they should be provided with a copy \nof Shelby County Health Directive #7 dated June 22, 2020 and instructed to \nfollow that directive upon release. Nothing in this directive is intended to delay or \nimpede the release of detained individuals if they are eligible to be released”. This \nis in the best interest of public health, and detained people are members of the \nShelby County community and should be protected from unreasonable risks of \ninfection just like non-detained persons in Shelby County. \n \n2.  Consult with the General Sessions Court and Criminal Court and ask the Judges \nto use the existing video technology located in holding tanks LLR and LLS for \narraignments, bond hearings, and other court proceedings that would not violate \nthe inmate’s 5th or 6th amendment rights.  In March, the Tennessee State Supreme \nCourt issued an emergency order suspending in person court appearances for two \nweeks, but I am unaware of the validity of this order today. Technology such a \n    20   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 23 of 35    PageID 1095\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nSkype, Zoom, Microsoft Team, Webex are also available and could be deployed \nin a cost effective and efficient manner while limiting the exposure of vulnerable \ninmates to infection.  Ms. Best, the Sheriff’s Office Expeditor, is a former Judge \nand an attorney and could be very helpful in explaining the risk of spreading the \nCovd-19 virus among the inmate population if court continues to demand the \ninmates appear in, at or near the Courts in large holding tanks. The use of video \narraignments, bond hearings, and other appearances would go a long way in \nreducing the risk of vulnerable inmates getting infected with the Covid-19 virus.  \n \n3.  Wellpath leadership needs to be more aggressive and more vocal about protecting \nthe vulnerable inmates in their care. There are several practices that take place in \nthe jail that are potentially harmful to their patients, and they should not be \nallowed to continue. I recognize that Wellpath leadership feels powerless to insist \nthat those harmful practices be discontinued, but in my expert opinion, Wellpath \nshould have brought those harmful practices, at a minimum, to the attention of Dr. \nBruce Randolph and documented that those harmful practices were brought to the \nattention of whatever entity they notified including the Court. Judges can be \ndismissive, but it is the responsibility of the medical provider to protect the health \nof the inmates in their charge and to speak up and advocate for the safety of their \npatients. I know this is an uncomfortable recommendation, but it is the right thing \nto do. Doing the right thing is not always easy, but it is always the right thing to \ndo. \n \nFINDING #3  \n \n1.  The Shelby County Jail is not maximizing its efforts to enforce social distancing \nin its living units and should consider rethinking how it programs inmates in all \nareas of the jail.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #3 \n \n1.  Jail Command Staff could consider allowing fewer inmates in the dayroom area at \nthe same time. By reducing the number of inmates in the dayroom at one time \nwhile continuing to enforce the mandatory mask order for staff and inmates who \nare in the dayroom, the risk of infecting others with the Covid-19 virus will be \nreduced. As an example, only allowing 6-8 inmates out in the dayroom at the \nsame time on the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th floors vs allowing 20 inmates out in the \ndayroom at the same time will substantially reduce the risk of person to person \ninfection. In the dormitory living units, staff can put some inmates on bunk status \nuntil it is time for them to program in the dayroom. It is critical that the security \nofficers  enforce  the  directive  that  inmates  properly  wear  masks.  I  did  not \nphysically go into the asymptomatic medical isolation units, but those inmates \nshould only be coming out alone with masks properly worn until their medical \nisolation is lifted.  \n \n    21   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 24 of 35    PageID 1096\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \n \nFINDING #4 \n \n1.  During my jail inspection, it was apparent to me that living unit security officers \nare not following the directive that ALL inmates should be receiving free bars of \nsoap not just the indigent inmates.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #4 \n \n1.  At the daily shift supervisors meeting, jail command staff should issue a directive \nto the floor Sergeants, Lieutenants, and Captains requiring them to direct living \nunit security staff to distribute free soap to the inmates in every unit twice a week \nuntil further notice. Furthermore, living unit security staff should provide each \nnew inmate who enters the living unit with an information sheet that provides the \ninmate with Covid-19 education materials and a statement that they are entitled to \nfree soap twice a week and that they will not be written up if they have more than \none bar of soap in their possession. If security staff do not follow this directive, \nthey should be disciplined.  \n \nFINDING #5 \n \n1.  During my jail inspection, I found that the mops used for cleaning were not \ndisinfected frequently enough and the mop heads changed frequently enough.  \nClean towels for cell cleaning were not available to inmates. In some living units, \nit was obvious that none of the housing officers on any of the three watches were \nensuring the living units, dayroom areas, and the bathrooms were being mopped \nand scrubbed. Spraying Biovex on the toilets and in the bathrooms is inadequate. \nThe floors need to be mopped regularly and the toilets and showers scrubbed \nregularly. This was not the case in every unit, but it was certainly the case in some.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #5 \n \n1.  Twice a week, every living unit in the jail should have a deep cleaning overseen \nby the security officer and the living units should be inspected by the floor \nsergeant. Inmates should have the opportunity to clean their cells every day at a \nspecified time that does not take away from their dayroom time. If the living unit \nis not spic and span, the inmate’s dayroom time should be suspended until such \ntime as the living unit is spic and span. In addition, the living unit security officer \nshould be disciplined for not keeping their living unit clean. Taking pride in your \nwork  area  is  a  fundamental  principal  and  best  practice  for  a  paramilitary \norganization.  \n \n   \n    22   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 25 of 35    PageID 1097\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nFINDING #6 \n \n1.  During my inspection, I did see episodic violations of the mandatory mask policy \nfor staff and inmates. I also witnessed Sergeants and Lieutenants not strictly \nenforcing the mandatory mask directive. I also witnessed security staff that had to \nbe told repeatedly to pull their mask up over their nose. Staff should not have to \nbe told two or three times to properly. In the intake/booking area, I witnessed an \ninmate enter the interior booking area without a mask. He was allowed to walk \naround the booking area without a mask for some time. A Memphis Police Officer \nalso was not wearing his mask correctly.  \n \n2.  In my expert opinion, some floor Sergeants, and Lieutenants are over familiar \nwith their subordinates. By that I mean, they act like friends rather than the \nsupervisor  of  the  rank  and  file  security  staff.  As  a  result,  the  rules  are  not \nrigorously enforced, rank and file security staff are not held accountable and \ndisciplined for not following the Covid-19 directives. In one instance, 3 rank and \nfile security staff were in a Sergeant’s office with the Sergeant and they did not \nhave their masks on and they were not properly social distancing. This should \nnever happen.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #6 \n \n1.  Floor Sergeants, Lieutenants, and Captains need to be hypervigilant in enforcing \nthe mandatory mask directive for staff and inmates. In fact, they need to be \nhypervigilant in enforcing all of the Covid-19 policies, procedures, and practices.  \n \n2.  It  is  critical  that  supervisors  maintain  their  professional  distance  from \nsubordinates. Overfamiliarity breeds contempt and as a result supervisors become \nunwilling to enforce policy and discipline non-compliant subordinates. This will \npoison the well and all the great work that management has done to fight the \nspread of this virus will go for naught, and many of the vulnerable inmates will \nunnecessarily become seriously ill and die.  \n \n3.  I  recommend  that  Chief  Fields  and  Assistant  Chief  Hubbard  increase  their \npresence on the decks and spot check compliance with the Covid-19 policies, \nprocedures, and practice including the cleanliness of the living units, dayrooms, \nand bathrooms.  \n \n4.  I  recommend  that  the  jail  consider  creating  a  compliance  unit  whose  sole \nresponsibility is to audit compliance with department policies, procedures, and \npractices. This unit can develop an internal audit tool and audit the jail quarterly \nfor compliance. A quarterly report then should be filed with command staff and a \ncorrective action plan should be developed to correct any identified deficiencies. \nThis is important to protect the vulnerable inmates from an unreasonable risk of \nharm due to policy violations.  \n    23   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 26 of 35    PageID 1098\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nFINDING #7 \n \n1.  The Covid-19 educational materials are not at a 6th grade reading level. The \nmaterials are posted on the wall, and there is a Covid-19 education cartoon that is \nplayed at 0800 and 1500 hours every day on the living unit TVs. Many inmates in \nthe jail are learning disabled, developmentally disabled, and seriously mentally ill \nand do not understand the word or concepts on the Covid-19 material.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #7 \n \n1.  Create a Covid-19 information sheet that is at a 6th grade reading level. This \ninformation sheet should be provided to every inmate who is booked in the county \njail and again when they reach their assigned housing unit after being taken off \nmedical isolation. It should also be posted on the wall of every living unit, and the \nliving  unit  security  officer  should  make  sure  the  inmate  understands  the \ninformation on the sheet when they orient the inmate to the living unit rules and \nregulations. This information sheet should be available in audio and large print for \nthe visually impaired and blind. \n \nFINDING #8 \n \n1.  Cleaning supplies for high touch surfaces such as telephones and kiosks are \nnot readily available for inmates to use after each inmate uses those high \ntouch items.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #8 \n \n1.  Place an EPA approved cleaning solution in a spray bottle with a supply of paper \ntowels  in  an  area  in  the  living  unit  where  inmates  can  readily  access  it  for \ncleaning the phone, kiosk and other surfaces after every use. The jail is a Direct \nSupervision Jail, and security staff are in the living units and can supervise its use \nor assign a pod worker to that responsibility. Many inmates are indigent and \nassigning inmates with a pay number at .20-.50 cents an hour will allow the \ninmate pod worker job to be attractive. First Watch and Second watch can each \nhave their own pod workers to assist the housing unit security officer with the \nmanagement of the cleaning supplies.  \n \nFINDING #9 \n \n1.  Some inmate masks I observed were in disrepair and were dirty. Inmates only are \nissued a single mask. \n \n   \n    24   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 27 of 35    PageID 1099\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nRECOMMENDATION #9  \n \n1.  Issue the inmate population two cloth masks one of which can be exchanged with \nthe weekly laundry exchange. During laundry, the masks should be inspected and \nreplaced if they are in disrepair. Masks should not be sprayed with Biovex. The \nmanufactures warnings state that Biovex is considered to be a mild irritant and \ncan cause irritation of the eyes, ears and throat. Vulnerable inmates may have an \nadverse reaction to this substance being sprayed on their masks especially those \nwith COPD or moderate to severe asthma.  \n \nFINDING #10 \n \n1.  Wellpath  does  not  test  for  Intellectual  Disabilities  or  Learning  Disabilities. \nCurrently a Psychiatrist interviews inmates who are suspected to be intellectually \ndisabled,  but  there  is  no  testing  for  learning  disabilities.  Identifying  the \nintellectually disabled and the learning disabled is important for informed consent \nas well as effective communication and victimization concerns.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION #10 \n \n1.  Wellpath  may  want  to  consider  hiring  a  Clinical  Psychologist  to  test  for \nintellectual disabilities and learning disabilities. Some experts have found that \nthere may be as many as 2-4% of the inmate population that are intellectually \ndisabled with a much smaller percentage being profoundly intellectually disabled \nneeding high adaptive supports and protection from victimization.  \n \nFINDING #11 \n \n1.  During my inspection and interviews, I came to the conclusion that there is no \nconcentrated and coordinated effort to assemble and present information to the \ncourts regarding an inmate’s medical conditions that may make him vulnerable to \nserious illness or death while housed in the jail. Moreover, while I find Mischelle \nBest, the Court Expeditor, to be hard working and passionate about her job, I am \nconcerned she is spread too thin and has to do the job of a competent criminal \ndefense attorney in addition to her other duties. Nor is there any consistent multi-\ndisciplinary  effort  within  the  jail  to  secure  alternative  custody  venues  for \nvulnerable inmates. I found that a significant number of these inmates had very \nserious charges, but some have been charged with garden variety felonies and, in \nmy expert opinion, because of their medical condition are not a current threat to \npublic safety if they were placed in a structured and supervised environment.  \n \nRECOMMENDATION # 11 \n \n1.  Create  a  multi-disciplinary  task  force  within  the  jail  to  present  the  medical \nconditions of the inmates who along with their non-violent offenses make then \n    25   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 28 of 35    PageID 1100\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \ngood candidates for release to alternative custodial settings. Technology has come \na long way and alternatives custodial environments work well in many other \nstates and jurisdictions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    26   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 29 of 35    PageID 1101\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nDuring the course of my jail inspection, I came to believe that the Shelby County Jail \nleadership team are consummate professionals who do embrace and promote the “care” \ncomponent of the inmates in their custody, care, and control. They repeatedly told me \nthat they were open to making any changes that would improve their operation and \nincrease the health and safety of all the inmate population but especially the vulnerable \ninmate population. Their ability to decrease the size of the inmate population in the jail is \nlimited by their authority to limit the intake of new inmates and by their complete lack of \nauthority to place any inmates in alternative custodial environments. The fact that the \nShelby  County  Jail  is  accredited  by  the  ACA  and  the  National  Commission  on \nCorrectional Health Care is evidence of their desire to have a well-run jail that delivers \npatient centered healthcare. What I found during my inspection were opportunities for \nimprovement in some critical areas that are plagued by episodic violations of well-\nintentioned and well thought out policies procedure and practices designed to maximize \nthe protection of the vulnerable inmate population. \n \nThe  Shelby  County  Jail  medical  provider,  Wellpath,  is  also  dedicated  to  delivering \npatient centered, competent medical care to all the inmates but especially to the medically \nfragile inmates who are the most vulnerable to serious illness or death from the Covid-19 \nvirus. The effort of Wellpath to deliver consistent care to the inmates with chronic \nillnesses and serious medical conditions is hampered by the unwillingness of outside \nhospitals and specialty clinics to treat inmates. I find that deeply offensive and dangerous, \nbut I am hopeful that Dr. Bruce Randolph can assist Wellpath and the Shelby County Jail \nin expanding the medical resources available to them in the community to treat those \ninmates who are in desperate need of treatment of their chronic diseases and serious \nmedical conditions. The inmates in the Shelby County Jail are members of the Shelby \nCounty Community and most of them will return to the community in less than 18 \nmonths. Ironically those same inmates who are currently being refused treatment by \ncommunity providers and hospitals will seek treatment at those very same hospitals \nwithout shackles and will not be refused treatment.  \n \nGiven the reality of what is occurring with the Shelby County Courts and the inability of \nthe jail to reduce its population, the jail and its medical provider must adjust their Covid-\n19  response  strategy  for  the  protection  of  all  inmates  but  especially  the  vulnerable \ninmates.  \n \nThe jail is a high-risk environment for these vulnerable inmates, and I am hopeful that my \nrecommendations will be adopted in order to reduce their risk of infection and serious \nillness or death. \n \nNo jail will ever be perfect in performing its duties, but the Shelby County jail must \nembrace the necessary changes to its Covid-19 response strategy or risk losing control of \n    27   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 30 of 35    PageID 1102\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nits jail to a plethora of class action lawsuits, restraining orders, and/or population caps. \nThe choice is theirs to make. \n \nThank you for the opportunity to work on this very important project.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n    28   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 31 of 35    PageID 1103\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nSignature \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n                 June 29, 2020 \nMike Brady    Date \nDirector \nSabot Consulting \n \n \n \n   \n    29   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 32 of 35    PageID 1104\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \nEXHIBIT 1 – INSPECTION ORDER \n \n    30   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 33 of 35    PageID 1105\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \n \n    31   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 34 of 35    PageID 1106\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \n \n    32   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 76   Filed 06/30/20   Page 35 of 35    PageID 1107\nSHELBY COUNTY MENS JAIL \nCOVID19 INSPECTION \nJUNE 29, 2020 \n \n \n \n    33   ",

R. Civ. P. 651 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241, \n2243, for a Temporary Restraining Order:  \n1. Granting Plaintiffs’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus and directing their immediate\nrelease;\n2. Directing Defendants to produce, within 12 (twelve) hours of the entry of the Order, a\nlist of all other Class and Subclass members, as defined in paragraphs 41 and 42 of\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint, detained at the Jail, including their location, charge, and bond\nstatus;\n1 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(a)(4), explaining that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “apply to \nproceedings for habeas corpus . . . to the extent that the practice proceedings [are] not specified \nin a federal statute, the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, or the Rules Governing Section \n2255 Cases.”  As documented in the Certificate of Service filed herewith, Plaintiffs’ counsel \nprovided notice of the relief sought in this Motion to Defendants in accordance with Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65 and Local Rule 65.1. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 2 of 32    PageID 34\n3.  Directing Defendants to, within twenty-four (24 hours) of the entry of the Order, release \nand/or enlarge the custody pending full adjudication of the habeas petition of all \nmembers of the Class and Subclass who are incarcerated solely due to their inability to \nafford a financial condition of release, or solely due to an alleged technical violation of \nprobation or parole;  \n4.  Directing Defendants to, within twenty-four (24) hours of the entry of the Order, \nprovide a list to the Court and to Counsel for Plaintiffs noting the basis for any \nobjections  to  the  release  of  the  remaining  Class  and  Subclass  members.    Such \nobjections must be limited to evidence of a credible risk of pretrial flight or danger to \nothers; \n5.  Directing Defendants to, within forty-eight (48) hours, release and/or enlarge the \ncustody of any Class and Subclass members whose release Defendants do not note an \nobjection to; \n6.  With respect to any and all remaining Class and Subclass members to whose release \nDefendants object, directing the parties to meet and confer within one or two business \nday(s) of Defendants’ submission to Plaintiffs of the list of objections. \nPlaintiffs further request that the Court conduct a hearing, to consider and rule upon the \nrelief requested in Plaintiff’s motion, considering: \na.  the deprivation of the petitioner’s federal rights posed by the COVID-19 outbreak \n(including the disability discrimination for Subclass members and the necessity of \nproviding modifications including release); \nb.  any competent evidence that the individual poses a serious risk of flight or danger to \nothers; \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 32    PageID 35\nc.  whether, by clear and convincing evidence, any presented risk of flight of danger \noutweighs the threat to the petitioner’s health and safety posed by his exposure to \nCOVID-19 in the Jail, after considering alternative conditions to manage the risk(s) \npresented. \nThe grounds for this motion are set forth in the Brief in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order, filed herewith, and the accompanying Declarations in support.   \n \nDated:   May 20, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Brice M.

Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nrights are being violated because, owing to their vulnerability, they cannot be housed safely at the \nJail.  They cannot be housed safely at the Jail because it is impossible to practice social distancing, \nwhich is compounded by inadequate testing for COVID-19 that precludes any approximation of \nwho among the Jail population is infectious, and because it is impossible to practice vigilant \nhygiene within the Jail.  The Court should order their immediate release.1  Likewise, the Court \nshould order the release of all persons who are currently being or will in the future be held in the \nJail’s custody during the COVID-19 outbreak in Tennessee who are medically vulnerable (the \n“Class”)2 and individuals who are medically vulnerable because of disabilities (the “Subclass”).3 \n                                                 \n1   The term “release” refers to the discharge of detained individuals from the physical confines \nof the Shelby County Jail, not necessarily release from all forms of custody.  Release options \nmay include, but are not limited to: supervised release (including through the use of GPS or \nother forms of location monitoring), halfway house residential placement, transfer to a hospital \nor other facility, or diversion to alternative community and treatment programs.  Indeed, \nShelby County already maintains a Pretrial Services Department “offering alternatives to \nincarceration at every stage of the criminal justice system.”  See Pretrial Services, SHELBY \nCTY.  TENN.,  https://www.shelbycountytn.gov/250/Justice-Initiatives  (last  visited  May  19, \n2020); see also Declaration of Bill Powell (“Powell Decl.”) at ¶ 11. \n2   The Class is defined as follows: all current and future persons held at the Jail in pretrial custody \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic who are 55 and older, as well as all current and future persons \nheld at the Jail during the COVID-19 pandemic of any age who, by virtue of their underlying \nmedical conditions, are at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19.  \n3   The Subclass consists of all current and future pretrial detainees in the Jail who are medically \nvulnerable because of a disability as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) \nand the Rehabilitation Act.  This includes everyone in the Class except those who are medically \nvulnerable solely because of age or a Body Mass Index (BMI) over 40.  \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 12 of 32    PageID 44\nCOVID-19 presents an immediate threat to Plaintiffs and to the Class members they \nrepresent and they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief.  The disease has \nalready infiltrated the Jail and infected a large number of people, and it continues to spread rapidly \namong the incarcerated population and staff.  On April 17, there were only five confirmed cases \nof COVID-19 among detained persons at the Jail.  As of May 20, 2020, 151 individuals housed at \nthe Jail and 66 employees have tested positive for COVID-19.  At least one Shelby County \nSheriff’s Office employee who contracted the virus has died.  The disease is spreading through the \nJail exponentially.  Without intervention, Defendants’ failures will allow COVID-19 to continue \nto wreak havoc not only on the health of people incarcerated at the Shelby County Jail, but also \nthat of Jail staff and members of the broader community. \nPlaintiffs’ release, and that of the Class members, with adequate public health and safety \nmeasures, is in Defendants’ interest and the interest of the public generally.  The Jail is not separate \nfrom the broader community, and the Jail’s failure to manage the COVID-19 threat will cause \nadditional, preventable deaths in the community at large.

The Jail provides cleaning supplies for detained individuals to clean \ntheir own cells through a pod officer, but if a pod officer is not stationed in the pod, individuals \nare not provided with cleaning supplies and cannot clean their cells.  See Yarbrough Decl. at ¶ 9.  \nThere is no hand sanitizer.  See Spickler-Busby Decl. at ¶ 22; Declaration of Michael Working \n(“Working Decl.”) at ¶ 18; Yarbrough Decl. at ¶¶ 17, 53.

See Spickler-Busby Decl. at ¶ 14; Yarbrough Decl. at ¶ 36.  Prior to \nthose positive tests, Mr. Busby reports that the men were frequently in close proximity to other \npeople in detention, they did not have masks, and they shared common surfaces with everyone else \nin H pod.  See Spickler-Busby Decl. at ¶ 14.  None of the individuals who tested positive at the \nend of April displayed symptoms.  See Yarbrough Decl. at ¶ 37.

Immediate Release Is the Only Way to Protect the Medically Vulnerable. \nBecause testing and screening for COVID-19 at the Jail is wholly inadequate, making it \nimpossible to know who is likely to be infectious, the only way medically vulnerable people can \navoid serious illness and death from COVID-19 is to mitigate the likelihood of contracting the \n                                                 \n17  Nearly  200  Detainees  and  Employees  at  201  Poplar  Test  Positive  for  COVID-19, \nWMCACTIONNEWS5 (Apr. 29, 2020), https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2020/04/29/nearly-\ndetainees-employees-poplar-test-positive-covid-/. \n18   Id. \n19   Yolanda Jones, West Tennessee Prisons, Shelby County Jail Hit Hard by Coronavirus, DAILY \nMEMPHIAN (May 18, 2020), https://dailymemphian.com/article/14121/tennessee-department-\nof-correction-shelby-county-jail-covid-19-testing-positive. \n8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 19 of 32    PageID 51\ndisease  by  practicing  social  distancing  and  vigilant  hygiene.    Because  these  measures  are \nimpossible at the Jail, only the immediate release of Plaintiffs and other medically vulnerable \ndetained persons will protect them from contracting COVID-19 and vindicate their constitutional \nand statutory rights.   \nNumerous public health experts have strongly cautioned that people booked into and held \nin jails are likely to face serious, even grave, harm due to the outbreak of COVID-19.20  Because \nof the severity of the threat posed by COVID-19, and its potential to spread rapidly throughout a \ncorrectional setting, public health experts recommend the prompt release from custody of people \nmost vulnerable to COVID-19.21  Release protects people with the greatest vulnerability to \nCOVID-19 from infection, and allows for greater risk mitigation for people held or working in a \njail and the broader community in which it is situated.22  Release of the most vulnerable people \n                                                 \n20   See, e.g., Velesaca v.

As explained below, (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims; (2) they \nare likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their \nfavor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Where plaintiffs demonstrate “irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs \nany potential harm to the defendant,” the “degree of likelihood of success required” is less, and a \nplaintiff need only raise “serious questions going to the merits.”  In re DeLorean Motor Co., 755 \nF.2d 1223, 1229 (6th Cir. 1985). \nIV.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims. \nPlaintiffs are likely to  establish that Defendants violated—and continue to violate—\nPlaintiffs’  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  by  condemning  them,  in  spite  of  their  high \nvulnerability to COVID-19 complications and death, to confined, close quarters, where it is \nimpossible for them to practice social distancing and maintain good hygiene.  So long as Plaintiffs \nremain in the Jail, Defendants cannot adequately mitigate the risk of serious injury or death faced \nby Plaintiffs as a result of COVID-19.  Under even the strictest view of Plaintiffs’ burden, this risk \ndemonstrates a high likelihood of success on the merits.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ continued \ndetention violates their constitutional and federal rights. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Continued Detention, and That of the Class Members, Violates Their \nConstitutional Rights. \nBecause Plaintiffs are individuals  who have not  been  convicted of any  crime, their \ncontinued detention in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic violates their Due Process right to be \nfree from punishment.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979) (“[U]nder the Due Process \nClause, a detained person may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with \n11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 22 of 32    PageID 54\ndue process of law.”).  Punishment is established if the jailer’s conduct is either not rationally \nrelated to a legitimate, non-punitive government purpose or is excessive in relation to that purpose. \nId. at 561; see also J.H. v. Williamson Cty., 951 F.3d 709, 717 (6th Cir. 2020) (applying Bell test \nto pre-trial detained person’s conditions of confinement claim); Turner v. Stumbo, 701 F.2d 567, \n572-73 (6th Cir. 1983) (same).     \nThe Supreme Court has recognized only two legitimate government interests in pretrial \ndetention: to prevent a credible risk of flight, see Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 8 (1951), and to \nprevent a credible, serious risk to public safety, see United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 \n(1987).  Even if Plaintiffs’ and proposed Class members’ pretrial detention were otherwise \njustified as the least restrictive way to mitigate a credible risk of flight or danger in normal times—\nwhich Plaintiffs do not concede to be the case—their confinement in a facility that puts their lives \nin danger is excessive in light of the government’s original interest in detention. \nBy continuing to detain Plaintiffs in an environment that exposes them to an unreasonable \nrisk to their future health, Defendants also run afoul of substantive Due Process protections, which  \nare at least as expansive as the protections of the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual \npunishment.  See City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983) (holding that the \nDue Process Clause protects pretrial detained persons to at least the same extent the Eighth \nAmendment protects convicted prisoners); see also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993) \n(recognizing an Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim based on unwanted exposure to \na future health risk).  While the Eighth Amendment analysis of deliberate indifference claims \ntraditionally involves both an objective and subjective component, the Supreme Court has strongly \nindicated that pretrial detained persons need only show that defendants’ conduct was objectively \nunreasonable.  See Richmond v. Huq, 885 F.3d 928, 938 n.3 (6th Cir. 2018) (recognizing that the \n12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 23 of 32    PageID 55\nSupreme Court’s holding in Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2015), which held \nthat the appropriate standard for a pretrial detained person’s excessive force claim is “solely an \nobjective one,” signaled a “shift in Fourteenth Amendment deliberate indifference jurisprudence \n[that] calls into serious doubt whether [the plaintiff] need even show that the individual defendant-\nofficials were subjectively aware of her serious medical conditions and nonetheless wantonly \ndisregarded them”).  The objective component of a deliberate indifference claim is satisfied by \nshowing that “absent reasonable precautions, an inmate is exposed to a substantial risk of serious \nharm.”  Richko v. Wayne Cty., 819 F.3d 907, 915 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Amick v. Ohio Dep’t of \nRehab. & Corr., 521 F. App’x. 354, 361 (6th Cir. 2013)).   \nThe magnitude of the risk of death or severe illness from COVID-19 to Plaintiffs and other \nmedically vulnerable detained persons is immense, and Defendants are aware of it.  The disease \nhas spread to the Jail and there are hundreds of confirmed infections.  In April, over 70 percent of \nthose tested at the Shelby County Jail tested positive for COVID-19.25  It is likely that other \nindividuals who are asymptomatic and untested are transmitting the disease unwittingly to others.26  \nSee Goldenson Decl. at ¶¶ 13, 36.  Additionally, there have been several reported outbreaks of \nCOVID-19 in correctional facilities throughout Tennessee.27  And, as of May 15, 2020, at least \n                                                 \n25  See Yolanda Jones, More Than 70% Of Inmates, Jailers At 201 Poplar Tested Positive For \nCOVID-19, DAILY MEMPHIAN (Apr. 29, 2020), https://dailymemphian.com/article/13488/201-\npoplar-covid-testing-70-percent-positive.   \n26   Nathan W.

Potential exposure to a future harm is sufficient to state a constitutional claim and \nsupport a finding of irreparable injury.  Helling, 509 U.S. at 33 (finding that “a remedy for unsafe \nconditions need not await a tragic event”). \nAlthough not required to do so, Plaintiffs can also demonstrate that Defendants have been, \nand  continue  to  be,  subjectively  indifferent  to  the  risk  that  COVID-19  poses  to  medically \nvulnerable detained persons.  The subjective component of deliberate indifference is satisfied by \nshowing that “(1) the official being sued subjectively perceived facts from which to infer a \nsubstantial risk to the prisoner, (2) the official did in fact draw the inference, and (3) the official \nthen disregarded that risk.”  Richko, 819 F.3d at 915-16 (quoting Rouster v. Cty. of Saginaw, 749 \nF.3d 437, 446 (6th Cir. 2014)).  “Because government officials do not readily admit the subjective \ncomponent of this test, it may be demonstrated in the usual ways, including inference from \ncircumstantial evidence. . . . ”  Id. at 916 (quoting Dominguez v. Corr. Med. Servs., 555 F.3d 543, \n550 (6th Cir. 2009)).  Additionally, “a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a \nsubstantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. at 825, \n842 (1994). \nIt is plain that Defendants are aware of the risk to Plaintiffs and other medically vulnerable \ndetained persons at high risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19, and their failure to \nimplement precautions specific to medically vulnerable detained persons or to release them \nconstitutes a blatant disregard of that risk.  Defendants know there is an extremely high rate of \ninfection among the Jail population.  Defendants are aware of the age, medical histories, and \n                                                 \n28   See THE MARSHALL PROJECT, supra note 27. \n14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 25 of 32    PageID 57\ncurrent medical conditions of persons in the Jail.  Defendants also know that older individuals and \npeople with certain medical conditions are at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-\n19.  They know that social distancing is the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to \nmedically vulnerable individuals in the Jail and that this measure is not possible in the Jail.  \nBecause the necessary measures to safeguard Plaintiffs’ health, and that of similarly situated \nmedically vulnerable detained persons, cannot be implemented in the Jail, release is the only \nreasonable response to the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.29  See Malam v. Adducci, No. 5:20-cv-\n10829, ECF No. 68, at 46-51 (E.D. Mich. May 12, 2020).   \nB.  Defendants Are Violating the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by \nFailing to Make Modifications for Disabled Subclass Members. \nPlaintiffs are also likely to prevail on their claim that Defendants have denied Mr. Busby \nand the Subclass members the benefits of the services, programs, and/or activities of the Shelby \nCounty Jail by reason of their disabilities in violation of the ADA and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., 29 U.S.C. § 794.  Plaintiffs in the Subclass are \npeople with disabilities protected under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act in addition to their \nconstitutional protections.  42 U.S.C. § 12132 states that: \nno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.  \nThe Jail is a public entity under federal disability rights laws. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(B) \n(“public  entity”  includes  “any  department,  agency,  special  purpose  district,  or  other \ninstrumentality of a State or States or local government”); see also Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, \n524 U.S. 206, 210 (1998).  The ADA  “demands more of public entities than simply refraining \n                                                 \n29   On March 19, 2020, Defendants were also asked by the former director of Shelby County \nPretrial Services to pursue all available options to release vulnerable people from the jail in \nlight of the threat posed by COVID-19.  See Powell Decl. at ¶ 6, Ex. A. \n15 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 26 of 32    PageID 58\nfrom intentionally discriminating against disabled individuals.”  Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. \nCity of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 910 (6th Cir. 2004).  Put another way, public entities have an \naffirmative duty to accommodate disabled individuals.  Id. at 910.  This requires public entities to \ntake affirmative steps to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in all of the entity’s \nprograms, benefits, and services on an equal and equally safe basis as people without disabilities. \n28 C.F.R. §§ 35.102(a), 35.130(a), (b); Pierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d 250, 266, \n269 (D.D.C. 2015).  A failure to make accommodations or modifications necessary to ensure that \npeople with disabilities can participate equally is a type of disability discrimination.  28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7); Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 511 (2004) (noting that Congress recognized \n“that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as \noutright exclusion” or discrimination).  The ADA also prohibits public entities from “utiliz[ing] \ncriteria or methods of administration . . . [t]hat have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals \nwith disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability” or “[t]hat have the purpose or effect \nof defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s \nprogram with respect to individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i)-(ii).  By \ncontinuing to detain Plaintiffs with disabilities, Defendants’ policies and practices violate the \nADA; they have failed in their duty to make modifications so Plaintiffs can benefit on an equal \nbasis from the services, programs, or activities to which they are entitled.   \nMr. Busby and the members of the Subclass are individuals with disabilities.  The ADA \ndefines disability as an impairment that substantially limits “major life activities.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(1)(A).30  They are “qualified” to participate in the Jail’s programs, services, and activities. \n                                                 \n30   “Major life activities” include “the operation of a major bodily function, including but not \nlimited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, \n16 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 27 of 32    PageID 59\nThis means that people in the Jail are entitled to equal access to adjudication of their criminal \ncases, as well as adequate medical care and basic life necessities during incarceration.  \nMr. Busby and other medically vulnerable people with disabilities detained at the Jail are \nfacing exclusion and denial of equal participation in the Jail’s programs, services, and activities, \nincluding the adjudication of their criminal cases, because of the Jail’s violation of disability rights \nlaws.  Subclass members cannot benefit equally from the Jail’s medical care, or provision of food \nand other basic necessities—or even benefit equally in the Jail’s system of ensuring that people \nsurvive in good health to the adjudication of their cases—because of the high risks they face from \nCOVID-19 and the Jail’s failure to make modifications to mitigate those risks.  See 28 C.F.R. Pt. \n35, App. B (“[T]itle II applies to anything a public entity does.”); Fraihat v. U.S. Immigration & \nCustoms Enf’t, No. EDCV 19-1546 JGB (SHKx), 2020 WL 1932570, at *26 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 20, \n2020) (disabled people in ICE detention entitled to reasonable accommodations in order to \nparticipate in the “programmatic ‘benefit’” of the removal process).  Subclass members cannot \naccess these services or any others if they are severely ill, unconscious, or dead.  Placing Plaintiffs \nand Subclass members at an extreme risk of severe illness, injury, or death has “the same practical \neffect of exclusion,” Lane, 541 U.S. at 531, and has the “effect of defeating or substantially \nimpairing  accomplishment  of  the  objectives  of  the  public  entity’s  program  with  respect  to \nindividuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i)-(ii).  Given the fast-moving, life-\nthreatening nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the Subclass, immediate release \nis the only reasonable modification that can bring Defendants into compliance with the ADA and \nSection 504. \n                                                 \nneurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(2).   \n17 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 28 of 32    PageID 60\nV.  Plaintiffs’ Risk of Exposure to COVID-19 Constitutes Irreparable Harm. \nPlaintiffs have experienced, and continue to experience, irreparable injury in the form of \nbeing subjected to substantial and unreasonable risk of harm from COVID-19, in violation of their \nFourteenth Amendment rights.  “When constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable \ninjury is presumed.”  Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012); Overstreet v. \nLexington-Fayette Urban Cty. Gov., 305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Connection Distrib. \nCo. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 288 (6th Cir. 1998)); see also Rhinehart v. Scutt, 509 F. App’x 510, \n514 (6th Cir. 2018) (suggesting that allegations of “continuing violation of . . . Eighth Amendment \nrights” would trigger a finding of irreparable harm).  Because Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their constitutional claims, which themselves stem from exposure to an unacceptable \nrisk of serious illness or death, “no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”  Mitchell \nv. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir. 1984).  Even so, Plaintiffs can show an additional and \nobvious risk of irreparable harm in the form of serious illness or death should they contract \nCOVID-19 and be forced to cope with infection while housed in the Jail. \nVI.  The Balance of Equities and the Public Interest Favor Plaintiffs. \nWhen the government opposes the issuance of a temporary restraining order, the final two \nfactors—the balance of the equities and the public interest—merge.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 435 (2009).  The public has an interest in preserving Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and in \nprotecting public health.  See Neinast v. Bd. of Trs. of the Columbus Metro. Library, 346 F.3d 585, \n594 (6th Cir. 2003) (recognizing public health and safety as legitimate government interests).  The \npublic interest is also “served by the enforcement of the ADA.”  Wilborn ex rel. Wilborn v. Martin, \n965 F. Supp. 2d 834, 848 (M.D. Tenn. 2013).  The public interest thus requires that a TRO be \ngranted in order to effectuate the ADA’s broad “remedial purposes.”  Hostettler v. College of \nWooster, 895 F.3d 844, 853 (6th Cir. 2018). \n18 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 29 of 32    PageID 61\n Significantly,  releasing  vulnerable  individuals  will  reduce  the  burden  on  the  local \ncommunity and health infrastructure and release is clearly in the public interest.  See Goldenson \nDecl. at ¶ 40; Fefferman Decl. at ¶¶ 8-9.   Releasing vulnerable individuals also reduces the degree \nto which the Jail serves as a vector for further infections among others living and working at the \nJail and the communities they return home to.31  Plaintiffs’ release, subject to appropriate public \nhealth and safety precautions, will also promote Defendants’ interest in ensuring the safety of \nothers held at the Jail, as well as the staff there, and the community at large.  See Goldenson Decl. \nat ¶ 41.  In structuring their relief request, Plaintiffs have accounted for the prospect of public \nsafety concerns and suggested a process by which any credible public safety risks may be \naddressed prior to release.32  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ Motion.  \n \nDated:   May 20, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Brice M. Timmons   \n \n                                                 \n31   See Lofgren, supra note 22; Powell Decl. ¶ 17. \n32   As noted further in the Declaration of Bill Powell, there exist a number of alternatives to \nincarceration to mitigate any public safety risk posed by the release of any individual class \nmember.

I am over the age of 18 and I am competent to make this declaration. \n2.  I am a full Professor at the University  of Tennessee, Knoxville  in both the \nDepartment of Ecology  and Evolutionary  Biology  and the Department of Mathematics.  I \nam also the Director of the Mathematical  Modeling  Consulting  Center at the National \nInstitute  for Mathematical  and Biological  Synthesis,  and the Associate Director of the \nUniversity of Tennessee One Health Initiative.   My research focuses on complex adaptive \nsystems, with a focus on the interplay between individual  behavior and infectious  disease \nepidemiology.   Complex  adaptive  systems  are systems  that  have  a large  number  of \ncomponents  that interact and adapt such that the system is more complicated  than its \nvarious parts— for example, living  organisms, economies, or cities.    \n3.  I have worked for the past 16 years as a researcher of the epidemiology, \necology, and evolution  of infectious disease, pandemic preparedness, national biosecurity, \nand  infrastructure  protection.  I hold  a Master’s degree in  mathematics  from  Rutgers \nUniversity and a PhD in Biology  from Tufts University. \n4.  For over a decade, I was one of the primary researchers of the Command, \nControl,  and Interoperability  Center for Advanced Data Analytics, a U.S. Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”)  Center of Excellence, where I ran a research group focusing \non the mathematics of both biosecurity and cybersecurity.  As part of my role in that center, \nI actively contributed models and policy recommendations to DHS and its affiliate agencies \nfor how to manage and mitigate  pandemic  threats from H1N1 2009 flu,  Ebola in West \nAfrica, and Zika  virus.   I have also  consulted  for various  additional  state and federal \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 31    PageID 67\nagencies  and  private  companies,  domestically  and  abroad,  in  the  area of  outbreak \nmanagement since 2004. \n5.  My  C.V.,  attached  as  Exhibit  A,  includes  a  full  list  of  my  honors, \nexperience, and publications. \n6.  I am donating  my time reviewing materials and preparing this report. Any \nlive testimony I provide will  also be provided pro bono. \n7.  I have not previously  testified as an expert at trial or by deposition. \nI.  Opinion \n8.  As an expert in infectious disease dynamics, it is my opinion  that individuals \nwho can safely and appropriately remain in the community  should not be brought into the \nShelby  County  Jail system at this time.  Individuals  who are already in those facilities \nshould be evaluated for release.  A careful evaluation of procedural and housing  guidance \nshould  be created for those who remain  in jail  facilities  until  at least such time as the \nepidemic  in  the  broader community  has been  contained  to the extent  that the  public \nrecommendations relax all measures of social distancing.   \n9.  These steps could substantially  reduce the number of COVID-19 infections \nin both the jail and the surrounding  community,  and reduce the risk that the Shelby County \nhealthcare system becomes overwhelmed. \nII.  Risk of COVID-19 Within Jails and Wider Community  \n10.  The health of persons in jail and the health of the rest of the community  are \ninherently  linked.   The two populations  must  interact,  because jails  constantly  release \npeople into the wider community,  admit new people from the wider community,  and rely \non staff and vendors who regularly  mix with the wider community.   Further, many jails \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 31    PageID 68\nrely  on  local  hospitals  to treat incarcerated persons  requiring  advanced medical  care, \nadding to the burden on the limited  resources of local healthcare systems. \n11.  The  existence  of  jail-driven  disease  dynamics  result  in  worse  health \noutcomes  for  the entire  population.   Cases of  infection  occurring  within  a jail  cause \nadditional  cases of infection,  hospitalization  and deaths in the wider community.1  This is \nnot surprising;  it reflects the features of the jail population  and the jail system itself.  The \nconditions  of incarceration degrade the health of incarcerated people, leaving  them more \nvulnerable to infection and severe outcomes from infection.2  As an epidemiological  result \nof decreasing individual  robustness to disease, the vulnerability  of the whole jail population \nincreases.  \n12.  Jails with disease prevalence higher than the general populations  they serve \nwill  therefore act as sources of infection.   Jails will continue to re-seed infection  into the \nwider  community,  undermining  the wider  community’s  efforts to contain  or  mitigate \noutbreaks,  or  even  introduce  disease  into  non-infected  communities.  This  cannot  be \nresolved by ceasing release of people from jail,  because a substantial number of staff and \nvendors regularly pass between the jails and the wider community. \n \n                                                             \n1     Eric Lofgren, Kristian Lum, Aaron Horowitz, Brooke Madubuonwu, Nina Fefferman, The Epidemiological  \n      Implications of Incarceration Dynamics in Jails for Community, Corrections Officer, and Incarcerated    \n      Population Risks from COVID-19,  MEDRXIV 2020.04.08.20058842,  doi:    \n      https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842 15–16 (May 4, 2020) (submitted for review).  \n2    David C.

Outbreaks  of  disease  in  jails  are  exacerbated by  both  the  continuous \nintroduction  of  potential  new  sources of  infection  (for  example,  as a result  of  new \nadmissions  or  by  staff) and  by  the maintenance  of  higher  rates of  contact  amongst \nsusceptible  incarcerated  people,  due  to  the  density  and  structure  of  jail  housing \narrangements. These dynamics drive the resulting efficacy of any proposed interventions.   \n14.  The living  conditions  within  the jail  spread disease.  Incarcerated people \ncannot practice social distancing due to the lack of space, overcrowding, or the requirement \nof constant supervision.  Incarcerated people are moved in groups  from jail  to court or, \nwhere court proceedings are halted due to this pandemic, forced to remain in their cells or \ndorms in close proximity  to each other.  Incarcerated people often have limited  access to \nproducts and equipment necessary to practice good personal hygiene, such as soap, or hand \nsanitizer or cleaning products.  \n15.  There are strategies that can help to slow the spread of disease and improve \nindividual  health outcomes for people incarcerated within  the jail  system.  For example, \nincreased physical/social  distancing  measures; decreased population  density;  improved \nfacility  sanitation,  access to free personal hygienic  care, such as warm water, soap, free \nhand sanitizer,  and free cleaning  products; increased time spent outside;  better nutrition \nand increased access to free medical care.   \n16.  However, these improvements  are unlikely  to  occur quickly  enough  or \nsignificantly  enough to improve the epidemiological  risks of COVID-19 for people living \nwithin the jail system or the wider community.   \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 31    PageID 70\n17.  Further, it is becoming increasingly  important to deter every single case of \nCOVID-19 infection possible,  including  infected incarcerated people, so that the capacity \nof the local  healthcare system in Shelby County,  including  ICU beds, does not become \noverwhelmed.     \n18.  Tennessee’s Safer at Home order expired  on April  30,  2020  and many \ncounties,  including  Shelby  County,  have commenced  phased reopening  of businesses.3  \nShelby County commenced Phase 1 of its “Back to Business plan” on May 4, 2020, which \nincluded reopening offices, restaurants, hair salons and gym facilities.4   \n19.  As social  distancing  mandates are lifted,  it  is reasonable to assume that \nwithin  weeks the number  of COVID-19 cases in  the Shelby  County  community  will \nincrease  substantially  and  that  the  number  of  serious  COVID-19  cases  requiring \nhospitalization  will  also increase.  It is estimated that Shelby County currently has up to \n480 ICU beds5 for a population  of over 937,166 people.6  As of May 13, 2020, more than \n70% of those ICU beds were occupied.7  An increase in COVID-19 cases could quickly \noverwhelm  the  limited  capacity  of  the  local  healthcare  system,  even  if  the  county \nimplements  some strategies to increase surge capacity.

Conclusion and Recommendations \n20.  It is my professional judgment,  based on the work I have done on mitigation \nand containment  strategies for infectious  disease in  humans,  including  COVID-19 and \nother diseases (such as Zika  virus,  Tuberculousis,  Clostridium difficile (C. diff.),  and \nPandemic flu), that reducing the population  of Shelby County Jail by increasing rates of \nreturn  home  for  individuals  currently  incarcerated  in  the jail  system,  and  decreasing \nadmissions  into  the  jail  system,  will  substantially  reduce  the  number  of  COVID-19 \ninfections in the jail and the community the jail serves.  Successful implementation  of these  \nstrategies will  also clearly yield a reduction in the source of risk to incarcerated people’s \nfamilies and the broader community. \n21.  Corrections officials can increase the rate of release from jails by evaluating \nrelease options or transfer to home confinement for those most vulnerable to serious illness \nor death if they contract COVID-19.  This should  be coupled  with a decreased rate of \nintake,  since only  increasing  release rates can increase infection  risks for incarcerated \npeople,  as well  as the staff who work at the jails  and court systems,  and the broader \ncommunity.    \n22.  Decreasing population  density achieves tremendous benefits. It decreases \nthe probabilities  of disease transmission and supports better health for incarcerated people, \nwhich also helps to protect the health of jail staff and the community  at large.  Decreasing \npopulation  both directly decreases disease exposure, interrupting  transmission  dynamics, \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-1   Filed 05/20/20   Page 8 of 31    PageID 72\nand also facilitates many other interventions.   By reducing transmission,  it also preserves \nthe precious resources of local healthcare systems.  \n23. It is my professional opinion  that these steps are both necessary and urgent.\nEach additional  day the jail system continues under current operational standards will cost \nlives in both the incarcerated population  and the broader community  each jail serves.  \n24. The health of people in jails and prisons, whether incarcerated or employed\nwithin,  is inextricably  linked with community  health. It is essential to protect the health of \nindividuals  who are detained in and work in these facilities,  for their sake and the sake of \nthe wider community.    \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my ability. \nNina H.

As of May 19, 2020, \nthere are 4,731,458  confirmed  cases of COVID-19 worldwide;  COVID-19 has caused 316,169 \ndeaths.1  Outbreaks have occurred within the United States in regions like New York, New Jersey, \nLouisiana,  Michigan,  and Illinois.   As of May 19, 2020,  there are 1,477,516  confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19 and 89,272 COVID-19 related deaths within the United States.2 \n8.  COVID-19 is a serious illness  caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (“the \nvirus”).  In severe cases, COVID-19 can require hospitalization  and lead to respiratory failure and \ndeath.  Symptoms  may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus and may include fever, \ncough, and shortness of breath or difficulty  breathing. While  more than 80% of cases are mild, \noverall  some 20% of cases will  have more severe disease requiring  medical  intervention  and \nsupport. \n9.  Patients  who  suffer  from  serious  disease  may  progress  to  Acute  Respiratory \nDistress Syndrome (ARDS), which is a type of respiratory failure.  Many patients suffering from \nARDS will  require mechanical ventilation.   ARDS has a 30 percent mortality  rate overall,  and a \nhigher mortality  rate in people with other medical conditions.   \n10.  Certain populations  are particularly  vulnerable to severe cases of COVID-19.  The \ncase fatality rate and need for advanced medical intervention  and support increase significantly \nwith advancing  age in people aged over 50 and for people of any age with certain underlying \nmedical conditions  (the “medically  vulnerable”).  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(“CDC”) identified  underlying  medical conditions  that may increase the risk of serious COVID-\n                                              \n1   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Situation Report – 116 14 (May 15, 2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200515-covid-19-sitrep-\n116.pdf?sfvrsn=8dd60956_2. \n2   Id. at 7. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 20    PageID 99\n19 for individuals  regardless of age, including:  blood  disorders, chronic kidney  or liver disease, \ncompromised  immune system, endocrine disorders, diabetes, metabolic disorders, heart and lung \ndisease, neurological  and neurologic  and neurodevelopmental  conditions,  and severe obesity.3   \n11.  At this time, there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and there is no known cure \nor anti-viral  treatment available. \n12.  The virus that causes COVID-19 is highly  infectious.  It is transmitted from person \nto person via airborne droplets.  The droplets are released by infected individuals  when they cough, \nsneeze or talk and can infect other persons in close proximity  (within approximately  six feet).  The \ninfected droplets can survive in the air for up to three hours.  The virus may also be transmitted \nwhen a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their own mouth, \nnose, or possibly  eyes.  Infected droplets can survive on surfaces for varying  time periods. For \nexample, studies suggest that the virus can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard, and for two to \nthree days on plastic or stainless steel.  \n13.  A significant  number of those who are infected with COVID-19 do not exhibit any \nsymptoms.    Similarly,  some  people  may  only  experience  mild  symptoms.  However,  these \nasymptomatic and mildly  symptomatic individuals  can, and do, transmit the virus to others, which \nhas further contributed  to its rapid spread.  Recognizing  the high risk of transmission  posed by \nasymptomatic individuals,  the CDC recommended everyone in the United States wear cloth face \ncoverings when in public settings where social distancing is difficult  to maintain.4 \n                                              \n3   CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness (May, 14 \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html. \n4   CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, Recommendation Regarding the Use of Cloth Face \nCoverings, Especially in Areas of Significant Community-Based Transmission (Last Updated Apr. 3, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 20    PageID 100\n14.  The only known ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are maintaining  six feet \nof  physical  distance  between  individuals  (“social  distancing”),  frequent  and  thorough \nhandwashing,  and frequent decontamination  of surfaces.   \nII.  The Risks of COVID-19 in Detention Facilities \n15.  COVID-19  poses a very  serious  risk  to  detainees,  staff, and  other  visitors  to \ndetention facilities  such as prisons or jails.  It is uncontroversial  that detention facilities,  including \njails  like Shelby County Jail, are associated with high transmission  rates for infectious  diseases, \nincluding  tuberculosis,  multi-drug  resistant  tuberculosis,  MRSA  (methicillin  resistant  staph \naureus), and viral hepatitis.  \n16.  Living  conditions  in prisons and jails  exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases, \nparticularly  diseases like COVID-19 that are transmitted by airborne droplets.  In these facilities, \nlarge  numbers  of  people  are  closely  confined  and  are physically  unable  to  practice  social \ndistancing,  which the CDC has identified  as a “cornerstone of reducing transmission of respiratory \ndiseases such as COVID-19.”5 Further, detainees often have limited  access to hygiene and personal \nprotective equipment such as soap, hand sanitizer, masks, and gloves.  \n17.  People in jails and prisons typically  sleep in close quarters, for example, a single \nroom may contain multiple  bunkbeds with limited  ventilation.   A single  cell can house multiple \npeople.  Detainees are generally  forced to share toilets,  sinks,  and showers without  disinfection \nbetween use.  Common areas are shared by large groups of people. The preparation and distribution \nof food is often centralized, sometimes using a single kitchen or cafeteria for an entire facility.  \n                                              \n5   CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease \n2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities, (Last Updated May 7, 2020) \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-\ndetention.html. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 20    PageID 101\n18.  Additionally,  the likelihood  of exposure is heightened due to the constant “churn” \n(i.e., exit  and entry) of both  staff and detainees in  jails,  and population  mixing  of staff and \ndetainees.    Staff  have  regular  direct  physical  contact  with  detainees,  for  example,  when \nhandcuffing or removing  handcuffs from detainees who are entering or exiting the facility. \n19.  Outbreaks of COVID-19 have occurred in detention facilities  in the United States, \nfor example at the Lompok facility near Los Angeles, California,6  the Marion Correctional Facility \nin Ohio,7 the Bledsoe Prison in Pikeville,  Tennessee8, and the Rikers Island detention facility  in \nNew York City9.  \n20.  Jails  and  prisons  generally  lack  the medical  care infrastructure  and  resources \nrequired to cope with an outbreak of infectious disease.  Some do not have onsite medical facilities \nat all.  Medical facilities within jails and prisons are generally designed and resourced to administer \nmedical care for the ordinary day to day needs of detainees.  They are not designed or equipped to \ncope with an influx  of cases of a highly  infectious  disease like COVID-19, especially in addition \nto the regular case load.  Medical facilities within detention facilities are generally not designed or \nequipped  to administer  the resource-intensive  advanced care required  by patients  with  serious \ncases of COVID-19.   \n                                              \n6   Tyler Hayden, Lompoc Prison Explodes with Active COVID-19 Cases, (May 13, 2020) \nhttps://www.independent.com/2020/05/13/lompoc-prison-explodes-with-active-covid-19-cases/ . \n7   Josiah Bates, Ohio Began Mass Testing Incarcerated People for COVID-19.

Jails  and prisons  often need to rely on  external facilities  such as hospitals  and \nemergency departments to provide  intensive  medical care.  This places additional  strain on the \nresources of those facilities which may already be overwhelmed during a pandemic.   \n22.  During an outbreak, jail staff also become infected and fall ill,  and therefore cannot \nreport to work.  This can result in understaffing  of crucial roles, such as medical staff, cleaning \nstaff and security staff, placing further strain on the facility’s ability  to cope with the outbreak.    \n23.  Prison outbreaks can pose serious risks to communities  beyond the prison.   For \nexample, the tuberculosis  epidemic  that broke out in New York City in the early 1990s began in \njails and was spread to the community  by jail  employees who became infected and then returned \nhome.10  The severe epidemic  of tuberculosis  in prisons in Central Asia and Eastern Europe was \ndemonstrated to increase community  rates of tuberculosis in multiple  states in that region.11 \n24.  Medically  vulnerable  people within  jails  and prisons  are at even higher risk than \nother detainees.  As described herein, compared to the general population,  they are at a higher risk \nof death or severe illness  from COVID-19.  They also require ongoing  medical  care for their \nunderlying  medical conditions.   However, medical units within  detention facilities  may not have \nthe resources to administer  adequate care during  the course of a pandemic.  Failure  to provide \nthose individuals  with adequate medical  care for chronic underlying  health conditions  will  also \nresult in increased risk of morbidity  and mortality  related to those underlying  conditions.   In turn, \nthat results in increased risk  of COVID-19 infection  and increased risk of COVID-19-related \nmorbidity  and mortality  if they do become infected.     \n                                              \n10   LEE B. REICHMAN, EARL S. HERSHFIELD, TUBERCULOSIS: A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNATIONAL APPROACH 650–\n652 (2d ed. 2000). \n11   David Stuckler et al., Mass incarceration can explain population increases in TB and multidrug-resistant TB in \nEuropean and central Asian countries, 105 Proc.

While  jails  and prisons  should  take all measures possible  to reduce exposure to \ninfection in detention, given the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is now likely impossible  to achieve \nand sustain those measures quickly  enough to mitigate the risk of transmission.   It is therefore an \nurgent priority  to reduce the number of persons in detention as quickly as possible.   \n26.  This  is  consistent  with  guidance  from  the  World  Health  Organization,  which \nrecommended that “enhanced consideration should be given to resorting to non-custodial measures \nat all stages of the administration  of criminal justice, including  at the pre-trial, trial and sentencing \nas well as post-sentencing stages.”12  Indeed, the pandemic has prompted the release of prisoners \naround the world.  In California, 3,500 inmates were granted early release.13  France released 5,000 \ninmates.14   Many  cities  and  counties  across the  US,  including  San  Francisco15,  Chicago16, \nCleveland17 and New York18, are also releasing prisoners to reduce the risk of COVID-19. \n                                              \n12   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, Preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in prisons and other \nplaces of detention Interim guidance 4 (Mar. 15, 2020), \nhttp://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/434026/Preparedness-prevention-and-control-of-COVID-\n19-in-prisons.pdf?ua=1. \n13   Robert Burnson and Laurel Brubaker Calkins, California, Texas Plan Wide Release of Inmates as Virus \nSpreads, BLOOMBERG NEWS (Mar. 31, 2020), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/california-\nto-release-up-to-3-500-inmates-in-response-to-virus. \n14   BBC NEWS, Coronavirus: Low-risk prisoners set for early release (Apr. 4, 2020) \nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52165919. \n15    Katie Canales, Nearly half of San Francisco's inmate population has been released to avoid coronavirus \noutbreaks within jails, BUSINESS INSIDER (Apr. 6, 2020), https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-\ninmates-jails-released-coronavirus-2020-4. \n16   Cheryl Corley, To Combat High Infection Rate, Chicago Jail Releases Hundreds, NPR (Apr. 11, 2020), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/04/11/832572950/to-combat-high-infection-rate-chicago-jail-releases-hundreds. \n17   Scott Noll, Cuyahoga County Jail releases hundreds of low-level offenders to prepare for coronavirus \npandemic, THE REBOUND (Mar. 20, 2020), https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/oh-\ncuyahoga/cuyahoga-county-jail-releases-hundreds-of-low-level-offenders-to-prepare-for-coronavirus-pandemic. \n18   Mary Bassett et al., Andrew Cuomo, Stop a Coronavirus Disaster: Release People from Prison, N.Y.

Medically Vulnerable Persons at Shelby County Jail Are at Grave Risk of Death or \nSerious Illness  \n27.  I have reviewed the following  materials regarding the conditions  at Shelby County \nJail: the declarations of Josh Spickler; the declaration of Stella Yarbrough; the declaration of Josie \nHolland; the declaration of Ann Schiller; the declaration of Michael Working. \n28.  Based on my review of these materials, my experience working in public health in \njails and prisons, and my review of the materials above, it is my opinion  that medically  vulnerable \npersons at Shelby County Jail are at grave risk of death or serious illness. To the extent possible, \nRespondent-Defendants must release all medically  vulnerable people to prevent death and serious \nillness. The reasons for this conclusion  are described below.   \n29.  I understand that many detainees at Shelby  County Jail are housed in “pods,”  of \naround 30 to 40 people, comprised of cells which line a communal area.  I understand that on April \n17, 2020, 23 pretrial detainees at the Jail were tested; five were positive  for COVID-19.19   On \nApril  30  the  Jail  tested  266  pretrial  detainees  and  employees.  Seventy-two  percent  tested \npositive.20  The numbers in the Jail today are likely  higher,  as the Jail has neither administered \nuniversal testing nor any testing since April 30, 2020.   To date, one Jail employee has died from \nCOVID-19.21 \n30.  Many detainees at Shelby  County Jail,  including  medically  vulnerable  detainees, \nare not able to practice social distancing.  I understand that many cells are shared by two detainees, \n                                              \n19   Yolanda Jones, Five Inmates Test Positive for COVID at Shelby County Jail as Bonner Takes Safety \nPrecautions, DAILY MEMPHIAN (Apr. 17, 2020) https://dailymemphian.com/article/13074/sheriff-floyd-bonner-\nfive-inmates-positive-coronavirus-shelby-county-jail.  \n20    Yolanda Jones, More Than 70% Of Inmates Tested At 201 Poplar Are Positive For COVID-19, DAILY \n         MEMPHIAN (Apr. 29, 2020) https://dailymemphian.com/article/13488/201-poplar-covid-testing-70-percent-\npositive. \n21    Yolanda Jones, Sheriff’s Office Employee Dies From COVID-19,  DAILY MEMPHIAN (Apr. 21,      \n       2020) https://dailymemphian.com/article/13185/sheriffs-office-employee-dies-from-covid-19.   \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 10 of 20    PageID 105\nand that the cells are not large enough for cell mates to maintain  a distance of six feet apart from \neach other.  Those detainees share a toilet and sink.  \n31.  Detainees also eat meals and share telephone and laundry facilities in the communal \narea.  I understand that communal  areas are not large enough that detainees can practice social \ndistancing.  Detainees must queue in close proximity  to each other to receive any medication they \nrequire, where it is impossible to maintain six-feet distance from each other.  Detainees must queue \nin close proximity  to receive meals, and eat meals at small  shared tables.  Detainees who are \nattending court must wait in a holding  cell with up to 30 or 40 other detainees, and can spend the \nentire day in the holding  cell.  Detainees cannot practice social distancing in any of those situations.   \n32.  I understand that cells are not disinfected regularly. I understand that detainees are \nnot provided with disinfectant or cleaning equipment and that if detainees wish to clean their cells \nthey  must  submit  a request to  use cleaning  solution  spray,  which  is  often  not  available.   I \nunderstand  that detainees share the use of touchscreen kiosks  (used to place orders from  the \ncommissary) and telephones in the communal area that are not disinfected between individual uses.  \nI understand that meals are communally  prepared and delivered to the detainees by other detainees.   \n33.  I understand that detainees are required to purchase soap from the commissary or, \nif they do not have funds, they can request small bars of soap at no cost that can take up to a week \nto arrive.  Detainees do not have access to hand sanitizer or paper towels.  I understand that, while \nmasks were distributed,  many detainees were given only one mask each, which is not cleaned or \nreplaced regularly,  if at all.   I understand that not all  detainees are required  to wear masks in \ncommunal areas.  \n34.  I understand that many staff do not wear masks and when they do wear the masks, \nthey do not wear them adequately so that it covers their mouths at all times when in the presence \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 11 of 20    PageID 106\nof detainees.  Failure to do so places detainees at risk of infection by staff, who often move in close \nproximity  to the people being detained.  Staff do not always practicing social distancing from each \nother. \n35.  I understand that detainees can request medical  attention  by logging  a sick call \nthrough the kiosk  in the communal  area for a fee.  I understand that once the sick call has been \nlogged it can take up to two days to be seen by medical staff.  I understand that some detainees \nwho have displayed COVID-19 symptoms have not been provided with any medical assistance.  \n36.  I understand that people arrested and booked into the Shelby County Jail are not \nconsistently screened for symptoms of COVID-19.    Failure to screen and quarantine new arrivals \nplaces other prisoners at risk of infection from new arrivals who are infected, including  those who \nare asymptomatic  or presymptomatic.   Under the conditions  described herein, detainees cannot \npractice social distancing or good hygiene, nor can they frequently disinfect shared surfaces.  The \ndetainees at Shelby County Jail are unable to take basic steps to protect themselves from the virus.  \nThere is a high  risk  that detainees will  become infected  with  COVID-19, which  means that \nmedically  vulnerable detainees face a grave risk of death or serious illness.  \n37.  I understand that some detainees who tested positive for COVID-19 were removed \nfrom their pods to designated quarantine areas, including  isolation  units.  I also understand some \ndetainees that have exhibited  symptoms  of COVID-19 but  have not tested positive  were also \nplaced in quarantine,  and were housed with detainees that have confirmed  cases of COVID-19.  \nThis practice presents a grave risk that persons who are not infected with COVID-19 will become \ninfected.     \n38.  I understand that some quarantined detainees did not have access to fresh drinking \nwater and had to drink water from the toilet tanks.  I also understand that those detainees placed in \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 12 of 20    PageID 107\nisolation  lost certain privileges (for example, access to a clothes washer and dryer, microwave, and \ntelevision).   The prospect of losing  privileges  tends to discourage detainees from seeking testing \nor reporting symptoms and seeking medical attention.   \n39.  In my opinion,  the only viable course of action is risk mitigation,  and the best form \nof risk mitigation  for medically  vulnerable  people is to release them from detention,  given  the \nheightened  risks to their health and safety.  I understand that there are 155 confirmed  cases of \nCOVID-19 at Shelby County Jail.22  While those detainees have been housed separately, it is likely \nthat there are many unconfirmed cases living  amongst the prison population.    \n40.  Release of the most vulnerable people also reduces the burden on the limited health \ncare infrastructure  within  Shelby  County  Jail,  because the released detainees will  not  require \ntreatment related to COVID-19 infection  and will  no longer  require treatment for underlying \nconditions.  Releasing medically vulnerable detainees also reduces the burden on nearby hospitals, \nwhich will  otherwise need to treat these individuals  when infected, freeing up those resources to \ntreat other members of the public.  \n41.  Releasing  as many  detainees  as possible  is  important  to  protect  the health  of \ndetainees, staff, health care workers at jails and other detention facilities,  and the community  as a \nwhole.  \n42.  To the extent possible,  medically  vulnerable  detainees at Shelby County Jail must \nbe released as soon as possible.   Those detainees should  be released to a place where they can \nmaintain  quarantine  for at least 14 days and receive any necessary healthcare for underlying \nchronic conditions. \n                                              \n22   Yolanda Jones, More Than 70% Of Inmates Tested At 201 Poplar Are Positive For COVID-19, DAILY \nMEMPHIAN (Apr. 29, 2020) https://dailymemphian.com/article/13488/201-poplar-covid-testing-70-percent-\npositive.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 13 of 20    PageID 108\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and \ncorrect. \nExecuted this 20th day in May, 2020 in Alameda County, California. \n \n \n/s/ Joe Goldenson____    \nJoe Goldenson,  M.D. \n1406 CYPRESS STREET \nBERKELEY, CA 94703 \n(510) 557-1086 \njgoldenson@gmail.com \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 14 of 20    PageID 109\nExhibit A \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-2   Filed 05/20/20   Page 15 of 20    PageID 110\nCURRICULUM VITAE \n \nJOE GOLDENSON, MD \n1406 CYPRESS STREET \nBERKELEY, CA 94703 \n(510) 557-1086 \njgoldenson@gmail.com \n \n \nEDUCATION \n \nPost Graduate Training \nFebruary 1992  University of California, San Francisco, CPAT/APEX  \nMini-Residency in HIV Care \n1979-1980  Robert Wood Johnson Fellowship in Family Practice \n1976-1979  University of California, San Francisco \nResidency in Family Practice \n \nMedical School \n1973-1975  Mt.

I over the age of 18 and am competent to make this declaration.  \n2.  I am a Professor of Medicine  and Health Policy  at Vanderbilt  University  in  Nashville, \nTennessee, where I am a specialist in epidemiology  and internal medicine.  I have been elected to \nthe  American  Epidemiology  Society  and  the  American  Association  of  Physicians.    At  the \nVanderbilt University Medical Center, I currently direct the Master of Public Health program and \ndo epidemiologic  research.  I obtained  my medical  degree from Georgetown  University;  my \nmaster’s degree in  public  health  from  Johns Hopkins  University;  and completed  my  medical \nresidency at Emory University.   I trained in epidemiology  at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention  (“CDC”), Johns  Hopkins  University,  and the Mayo  Clinic.   During  my  two-year \nepidemiology  training  at CDC, I served on the New Jersey State Health Department, so I am \nfamiliar  with outbreak  investigations  and public  health  infrastructure.   I am a member of the \nVanderbilt  University  Public Health Advisory  Task Force which is responsible  for advising  the \nUniversity  on its COVID-19 response.  I am also a member of the University’s  Department of \nHealth Policy COVID-19 Advisory Panel, and in that role, I have helped prepare advisory memos \nfor use by public  health  professionals  and officials.   Attached as Exhibit  A is a copy of my \ncurriculum  vitae. \n3.  COVID-19 is an infection caused by SARS-COV-2, a novel zoonotic coronavirus.  SARS-\nCOV-2 originated  in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and caused a viral outbreak.1  On March \n                                              \n1   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, WHO Timeline - COVID-19 (Apr. 27, 2020), https://www.who.int/news-\nroom/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19. \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-3   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 42    PageID 118\n12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a global pandemic.2  As of \nMay 19,  2020,  there are 4,731,458  confirmed  cases of COVID-19 worldwide;  COVID-19 has \ncaused 316,169  deaths.3  Outbreaks have occurred within  the United States in regions like New \nYork, New Jersey, Louisiana,  Michigan,  and Illinois.   As of May 19, 2020, there are 1,477,516 \nconfirmed cases of COVID-19 and 89,272 COVID-19 related deaths within the United States.4 \n4.  There is no vaccine for COVID-19 and no known cure.   There is no  known  effective \nantiviral  medication  currently available  to prevent or treat infection.  The only way to reduce the \nrisk of injury or death from COVID-19 is to prevent individuals  from being infected with the virus \nin the first place.  One known effective way to reduce the risk of infection  is to practice “social \ndistancing” (remaining  physically  separated, approximately  six feet apart from other people), and \ngood hygiene,  including  washing with soap and water and disinfecting  commonly  used surfaces.  \nIn addition,  appropriate public  health measures include  isolating  any person with confirmed  or \nsuspected COVID-19 and using quarantine for close contacts of suspected/confirmed cases and all \npersons with high-risk  exposures. \n5.  COVID-19 can cause flu-like  symptoms including  fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  \nThe virus can cause severe illness  requiring  hospitalization,  the need for mechanical ventilation, \nand death.  Some groups  of people  are particularly  vulnerable  to severe illness  as a result  of \nCOVID-19.  People aged over 50 are at higher risk of severe illness, and those aged over 65 are at \nserious risk.  The CDC lists the following  conditions  that people of any age at high risk for serious \nillness  from  COVID-19:  chronic  lung  disease  or  moderate  to  severe asthma;  serious  heart \n                                              \n2   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, WHO Director-General’s opening remarks at the Mission briefing on \nCOVID-19 (Mar. 12, 2020), https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-\nat-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---12-march-2020.  \n3   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Situation Report – 116 14 (May 15, 2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200515-covid-19-sitrep-\n116.pdf?sfvrsn=8dd60956_2. \n4   Id. at 7. \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-3   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 42    PageID 119\nconditions;  conditions  that can cause a person  to be immunocompromised,  including  cancer \ntreatment, smoking,  bone marrow or organ transplantation,  immune deficiencies, poorly controlled \nHIV or AIDS, and prolonged  use of corticosteroids  and other immune  weakening medications; \nsevere obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 40 or higher); diabetes; chronic kidney disease requiring \ndialysis; and liver disease.5  Pregnancy in the era of COVID-19 also requires special consideration \nbecause of risks of transmission and potential needs for isolation  and quarantine. \n6.  The  case fatality  rate associated  with  COVID-19  infection  is  much  higher  than  that \nassociated with seasonal influenza,  and has been estimated to be about 10-fold higher.  About 15% \nof those with COVID-19 illness are hospitalized,  about 6% require intensive care, and 1% to 5% \ndie. These proportions  may be 2-4 times higher among those with high risk conditions. \n7.  Many people in the vulnerable groups who suffer from severe illness as a result of COVID-\n19 will  require more advanced medical support including  mechanical ventilation  and, in extreme \ncases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  This heightened level of care is extremely resource \nintensive.   It requires specialized  equipment,  the supply  of which is limited.   It also requires an \nentire team of healthcare providers,  including  1:1  or 1:2  nurse to patient  ratios, intensive  care \nphysicians,  and respiratory  therapists.   The level  of support  required  can quickly  exceed the \ncapacity of local healthcare facilities  if many cases occur simultaneously. \n8.  COVID-19 can cause severe damage to lung tissue, which may require an extensive period \nof rehabilitation.   In some cases, it can cause a permanent loss of respiratory capacity.  There is \nevidence that the virus can target the heart muscle, causing myocarditis (inflammation  of the heart \nmuscle).  Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and electrical system, reducing the heart's ability \nto pump.  This can lead to rapid or abnormal heart rhythms in the short term, and heart failure in \n                                              \n5   CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness (May, 14 \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html. \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-3   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 42    PageID 120\nthe longer  term.  Further, there is evidence that the virus can cause cytokine release syndrome, \nwhich is an overproduction  of immune cells and their activating compounds—cytokines—causing \nfurther damage to organs, and in some cases organ shutdown.  \n9.  Vulnerable  patients  who  do  not  die  can undergo  a long  recovery  requiring  intensive \nrehabilitation,  as a result of profound  deconditioning,  loss  of respiratory  capacity,  neurologic \ndamage, and other effects of severe illness. \n10. The period between infection and the development of symptoms is known as the incubation \nperiod.  The incubation period for COVID-19 can range between two and 14 days, and is typically \naround five days.  However, some infected individuals  never develop symptoms at all.  There is \nevidence that the virus  can be transmitted  by infected individuals  who have not yet developed \nsymptoms, and by infected individuals  who never develop symptoms.  Aggressive testing for the \npresence of the virus,  SARS-COV-2,  among  those with  symptoms,  is  required,  especially  in \ninstitutional  settings.  In these settings,  the virus  can spread quickly  and the ability  to isolate \nsuspected cases and quarantine those exposed is needed.  Testing of asymptomatic individuals  may \nbe advised in some situations.   Even if no individuals  within  a community  or institution  have \npresented with symptoms and/or tested positive, asymptomatic infected individuals  may be present \nwithin the community  or institution,  potentially  infecting others on an ongoing  basis. \n11. Congregate settings pose particularly  high risks of virus transmission.  Congregate settings \nare environments  where a large number of people live or gather.  During the pandemic, very high \nperson-to-person transmission rates for COVID-19 have occurred in congregate settings, including \nnursing homes (for example, in New Jersey and Washington),  on cruise ships and, recently, at the \nMarion  Correctional  Facility  in  Ohio.  According  to  the  Department  of  Rehabilitation  and \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-3   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 42    PageID 121\nCorrection, approximately 2,011 inmates tested positive (out of 2,500 total inmates at the facility).6  \n154 employees from a reported staff of about 350 have also tested positive.7   Another outbreak \noccurred at the Rikers Island jail  complex  in New York City.  The number of confirmed cases \namong inmates increased from one to nearly 200 within 12 days.8  At the beginning  of April,  the \nrate of infection  observed  at the Rikers  Island  jail  complex  was over eight  times  the rate of \ninfection  observed in New York City.9  These outbreaks are consistent with the spread of other \nviruses within  populations  in congregate settings.  During  the 2009 H1N1 influenza  epidemic, \nserious viral outbreaks occurred in jails and prisons. \n12. COVID-19 will continue to rapidly spread in prisons and jails.  People who live in prisons \nand jails  cannot take basic measures to protect themselves  from infection.   They do not have \nsufficient  space to engage in social distancing,  and often have limited  ability  to practice proper \nhygiene.   They  cannot protect themselves  from  known  infected  individuals.   Further,  people \nconstantly enter these facilities from the wider community  (for example, new inmates or staff who \nreside outside  the facility),  which  means that there is a constant threat that the virus  is being \nintroduced.   Even where the facility  conducts  symptom  screening,  it  is possible  that infected \nindividuals  who are asymptomatic  or not yet presenting symptoms  will  be allowed to enter and \ninfect others within the facility.   \n13. For the foregoing reasons, it is my opinion  that that people aged over 50 and people of any \nage with certain medical conditions (including  the high risk conditions listed above) who are living \n                                              \n6   New York Times Editorial Board, No One Deserves to Die of Covid-19 in Jail, N.Y.

I have read the declaration of Josh Spickler regarding Favian Busby.  I understand that Mr.\nBusby is currently being treated for diabetes mellitus  and hypertension.   It is my opinion  that he is \nat high  risk of serious illness  from COVID-19.

Identifying those \nopioids with the lowest risk of increasing infections is crucial to informing the selection of analgesics for \nolder adults. Given the high prevalence of opioid use in older adults, determining and quantifying these \nrisks is of great public health interest. \n \nVUMC57393 /HHSF 22301400301T (Griffin) 09/22/2015-09/21/2019  0.60 Calendar \nFDA Mini-Sentinel  $169,750 \nInfrastructure (task order 12) yr 5 \nThe objective of this project is to select and test statistical methods appropriate for use when analyzing \ncross-sectional and longitudinal observational healthcare administrative, claims, and clinical data, with \nspecific attention to clinical laboratory test results data when missing data are expected.

My name is Bill Powell. I am over the age of 18 and I am competent to make this\ndeclaration. \n2. I have lived in Shelby County for 57 years.  Prior to my retirement, I worked in\nthe criminal justice system in Shelby County for 39 years. \n3. I am the former director of Shelby County’s Pretrial Services Department. I also\nserved as the criminal justice coordinator for the Shelby County Government and previously \nserved as a coordinator for a settlement agreement between the Shelby County Government and \nthe U.S. Department of Justice.  \n4. Through each of my capacities described above, I became familiar with the\nShelby County Jail, its design, structure, and administration. \n5. I make this declaration of my personal knowledge.\nI. Concerns Around Shelby County Jail’s Response to COVID-19\n6. On March 19, 2020, I sent an email to Mark Billingsley, Chair of the Shelby\nCounty Board of Commissioners; Lee Harris, Shelby County Mayor; Karen Bartlett, Executive \nAssistant to Sheriff Bonner, and Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner, Jr. A true and correct \ncopy of that email is attached as Exhibit A. \n7. The email expressed my concerns that the severity of the health issue presented\nby COVID-19 in the Shelby County Jail was not being adequately addressed, even in light of \npositive steps taken by local officials including the Sheriff. \n8. I recommended that the Sheriff’s Office devise a plan to release people\nincarcerated in the jail, starting with those only incarcerated for their inability to pay a secured \nbail requirement of $10,000 or less.  \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-5   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 7    PageID 165\n9.  I wrote this email because I was concerned about the significant risk posed to the \nhealth of vulnerable people in the Shelby County Jail, where individuals spend their time in close \nproximity to each other. Many people in the jail have risk factors that render them particularly \nvulnerable to serious illness or death if they contract COVID-19. \nII.  Scope of Sheriff’s Authority to Release Medically-Vulnerable People \n10.  The Sheriff is vested with legal authority to release persons accused of \nmisdemeanors without a judicial order and that this has been the case for 30 years. See Tenn. \nCode Ann. § 40-7-120. \n11.  A Pretrial Services department already exists in Shelby County that could \nsupervise persons in the community while they are awaiting future court dates. I noted in my \nMarch 19, 2020 email that the Pretrial Services could easily undertake a review of an \nindividual’s case file prior to a person’s release, for instance to determine if they have other \nholds. \n12.  I do not believe the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office has done all that it can to \naddress the COVID-19 outbreak or to release vulnerable people from the Jail. \n13.  As just one example, the Sheriff’s Office continues to accept intake via \nmisdemeanor arrests rather than issuing citations and diverting people accused of misdemeanors \nas authorized by statute. \nIII.  Opinion as a Criminal Justice Stakeholder \n14.  I continue to hold the same concerns stated in my March 19, 2020 email today. \n15.  I believe the Shelby County Sheriff’s office should take all steps to release \nmedically-vulnerable persons from the Shelby County Jail and ensure that any necessary \nsupervision of such persons occurs in the community or, if necessary, in a facility (i.e. a \ncommunity treatment program or hospital) where they are housed in a manner that ensures their \nability to follow public health protocols regarding social distancing and hygiene.  \n16.  I believe the release of medically-vulnerable people can be undertaken in a way \nthat ensures public safety for the Shelby County community. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-5   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 7    PageID 166\n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-5   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 7    PageID 167\nExhibit A \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-5   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 7    PageID 168\nFrom: Andrea Woods\nTo: Andrea Woods\nSubject: RE: Letter to Harris, Billingsley, Bonner\nDate: Tuesday, May 19, 2020 2:10:24 PM\nFrom: Bill Powell\nSent: Thursday, March 19, 2020 9:36 AM\nTo: mark.billingsley@shelbycountytn.gov; lee.harris@shelbycountytn.gov; karen.bartlett@shelby-\nsheriff.org; floyd.bonner@shelby-sheriff.org\nSubject: Coronavirus and the Jail\n \nGood morning,\nI read the article in the Daily Memphian this morning about concerns about coronavirus threat to\nthose in custody at the County Jail.  The extreme measures being taken by government, business and\nthe population at large  are indicative of the public health threat we all face.\n \nSheriff Bonner is correct that in most cases, he cannot simply release individuals from custody\nwithout judicial approval.  Having the jail expeditor review cases is a good move but I would suggest\nit is not enough given the level of crisis we face.  I would like to make the following suggestion for\nyour consideration:\n \n1. Prepare a planned response and take to the General Sessions and Criminal Court judges and\nbase the plan on the following factors.\n \n2. The plan would include releasing inmates in custody with bonds of $10,000 or less.  These\nindividuals would be released under the supervision of Shelby County Pretrial Services during\nthe pendency of their case.  The Bond amount is some measure of the risk posed according to\nthe magistrate who set the bond and releasing by bond amount saves a considerable amount\nof time screening and reviewing cases.  Pretrial could do some type of quick review to insure\nthere are no other holds in the case.  If there is concern about releasing these individuals it\nshould be noted they could obtain their own release if they had $1,000 so, in essence, they\nare detained for a lack of money not because of the level of threat.\n \n3. Encourage law enforcement to issue summons whenever possible in all misdemeanor cases. \nThis would slow down the numbers entering the jail facility.\n \n4. The Sheriff actually does have the authority to release misdemeanor offenders without\njudicial authority. This has been the case for 30 years and that authority has historically been\ngranted to Pretrial Services.  There are some exceptions to this such as if a bond has already\nbeen set on a warrant.\n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-5   Filed 05/20/20   Page 7 of 7    PageID 169\nI would strongly encourage a dramatic response to this serious health issue.  The folks in the jail are\nat great risk because of the close proximity to each other while detained and because many of them\nhave other risk factors.  Nearly all of these individuals will return to their family and community and\ntheir time in 201 Poplar should be limited.\n \nOur jail suffered a crisis in 1991 when there was a riot in which use of the 4th floor was lost for some\ntime.  The judges were very helpful in revising current practices to meet that crisis.  I have no doubt\nthey will be eager to work with you on this crisis as well.\n \nThank you for your consideration and for the work you are doing to protect our community.\n \nSincerely,\nBill Powell\nBillpowell55@gmail.com\n \nSent from Mail for Windows 10\n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-6   Filed 05/20/20   Page 1 of 4    PageID 170\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE \nFavian Busby and Michael Edgington,  on \ntheir own behalf and on behalf of those  Case No. _______ \nsimilarly situated; \nPetitioners-Plaintiffs, \nv. \nFloyd Bonner, Jr., in his official capacity, \nShelby County Sheriff, and the Shelby \nCounty Sheriff’s Office, \nRespondents-Defendants. \n DECLARATION OF ANN L. SCHILLER IN SUPPORT OF \n        PETITIONERS-PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-6   Filed 05/20/20   Page 2 of 4    PageID 171\nI, Ann. L. Schiller, certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746: \n1.  My name is Ann L. Schiller. I am over the age of 18 and I am competent to make \nthis Declaration. \n2.  I am an attorney practicing criminal defense in the Shelby County courts. I am \nBoard Certified in Criminal Law. I represent clients at all stages of their criminal prosecution and \nam familiar with the relevant appellate practices that accompany such representation.  \n3.  I have been practicing law for thirteen (13) years, all of them in Shelby County. \n4.  I am a graduate of the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law.  \n5.  I represent clients who are currently incarcerated in the Shelby County Jail at 201 \nPoplar. I have visited clients in the Shelby County Jail dozens of times in the past three (3) years. \n6.  I make this Declaration based on my personal knowledge. \n7.  I  respectfully  submit  this  Declaration  in  support  of  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  a \nTemporary Restraining Order. The purpose of this Declaration is to provide facts that I have \nlearned about the health and safety conditions at the Shelby County Jail, as well as to share \ninformation about the local court system, including the difficulties Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers in this action would have seeking the relief requested in their Motion in the local courts. \nI.  COVID-19 Concerns at the Shelby County Jail \n8.  My clients report that the Shelby County Jail is failing to follow well-known public \nhealth protocols to protect them from becoming infected with COVID-19.  \n9.  For example, detainees are housed in a way that renders social distancing of six feet \nor more at all times impossible. My clients share that they are kept in close proximity to other \ninmates when they want to use certain facilities, including bathrooms, phones, and kiosks.  \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-6   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 4    PageID 172\n10.  Further, the Jail does not test individuals for COVID-19 when they are booked into \ncustody. The Jail also does not test the staff who routinely enter and exit the Jail. \n11.  I have had clients describe people in their unit who exhibit symptoms of COVID-\n19, such as coughing, fever, and general malaise, but who are not able to be seen by medical \nprofessionals. \n12.  The Jail has not provided my clients with reliable access to hand soap so that they \ncan wash their hands. According to my clients, they are required to purchase any soap through the \ncommissary. Otherwise, if they cannot afford it, it is provided only once a week. \n13.  The Jail has not provided my clients with hand sanitizer. \n14.  The Jail has not provided my clients with disinfecting supplies or other cleaning \nsupplies. \nII.  Local Court Practice \n \n15.  In my experience, it takes two weeks for a request for a bond reduction to be heard \nby the court. To request a reduction in a client’s bond or alternate conditions of pretrial release, I \nwould have to file a written motion for bond review, wait for the State to respond, and wait for the \nCourt to set the motion for a hearing. If the Court decided to issue a written ruling on the bond \nrequest, I estimate the process would take approximately one month to six weeks in the local courts \ngiven the current court’s schedule.  \n16.  An appeal of a request for a bond reduction goes to the Tennessee Court of Criminal \nAppeals. This process takes several weeks, and again involves an opportunity for the State to \nrespond, a hearing with argument, and eventually an order from the Court of Criminal Appeals. \nUnder pre-COVID-19 routine circumstances, this process generally took a month to six weeks. \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-6   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 4    PageID 173\n17.  For clients held at the Jail pretrial, the aforementioned is the primary way for them \nto seek release. State court habeas writs are available only where a petitioner raises: (1) a claim of \na void judgment that was facially invalid because the convicting court was without jurisdiction or \nauthority to sentence the defendant; or (2) a claim the defendant’s sentence has expired. Benson v. \nState, 2019 WL 1388195 (Tenn. Ct. Cr. App. 2019) (citing Stephenson v. Carlton, 28 S.W.3d 910, \n911 (Tenn. 2000)) (discussing T.C.A. §§ 29-21-101, -130). Based on both statute and settled \ncaselaw, a habeas petition is premature prior to a conviction.  \n18.  Tennessee  courts,  including  those  in  Shelby  County,  have  issued  emergency \nclosures and slowed their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Court cancellations \ncan be common and vary by judge. \n19.  Further, even where a client gets a court date, it is unclear whether they will be \ntransported to court as scheduled.  \n20.  I am not aware of any vehicle in the state courts through which a class of pretrial \ndetainees could seek relief regarding the constitutionality of their confinement in the Shelby \nCounty Jail. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted this 18th day of May, 2020. \n \nSigned:         \n \nAnn L.

My name is Josh Spickler.  I am over the age of 18 and I am competent to make \nthis declaration. \n2.  I am an attorney with Just City, and I am one of the counsel of record for Plaintiffs \nin this action.  I am licensed to practice law in the state of Tennessee.  \n3.  I  respectfully  submit  this  Declaration  in  support  of  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  a \nTemporary Restraining Order.  The purpose of this Declaration is to record the conversations that \nI had on May 13 and 16, 2020 with Favian Busby, a person detained pre-trial at the Shelby County \nJail and a Plaintiff in this action. \nI.  Background \n4.  Mr. Busby is 38 years old.  He has been detained since September 2018.  He is \nbeing held at Shelby County Jail on $264,000 total bond that he cannot afford to pay.  He is charged \nwith multiple of Unlawful Possession of Controlled Substance and Convicted Felon in Possession \nof a Firearm.  \n5.  Mr. Busby is a veteran of the United States Marine Corp.  He served for eight years, \nfrom 2000 to 2008.  He was honorably discharged after being deployed to Okinawa for three and \na half years during his active service.   \n6.  He holds a four-year degree in finance from the University of Phoenix and is a \ngraduate of Middle College High School in Memphis.  He also attended Collierville High School. \n7.  Mr. Busby was born and raised in Memphis.  He has a 14-year old daughter and a \n13-year old son who live in Memphis.  He also has a 2-year old daughter who lives in New York.  \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-7   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 8    PageID 176\n8.  His brother, Edward Busby, lives in Memphis. Mr. Busby would stay with his \nbrother, Edward Busby, if he were released.  He would have access to his own room and would be \nable to quarantine for 14 days after his release. \nII.  Mr. Busby’s Health Conditions \n9.  In September 2018, Mr. Busby was diagnosed with diabetes by a qualified medical \ndoctor at the Jail.  His blood sugar is checked three times per day, and he receives injections of \ninsulin based on his blood sugar level.  His blood sugar is measured and insulin administered by a \nnurse in the Jail. \n10.  Mr.  Busby  has  also  developed  hypertension  secondary  to  diabetes,  which  is \nmanaged with the medication lisinopril.  He is supposed to take one tablet of this medication daily, \nwhich is receives from the Jail.  His blood pressure is supposed to be checked on a weekly basis, \nbut he reports that it was last checked on April 15, 2020.  Because his blood pressure has not been \nchecked recently, he is not sure if he is taking the correct amount of medication. \n11.  On August 31, 2018, Mr. Busby fell from a second story balcony.  The fall resulted \nin multiple fractures of his femur and a crushed hip.  On September 1, 2018, he had surgery to \nimplant a new joint where his femur connects to his hip.  The joint was taken from a cadaver. Mr. \nBusby’s doctors are concerned about his body rejecting the joint.  He was told that he may have to \nhave an additional major surgery to get the bone to graft properly.  He is supposed to receive \nregular blood tests to check for infection but has not received a test since April 15, 2020.  \n12.  Mr. Busby reports that the line for medication is crowded and requires very close \ncontact with others. It is not possible to socially distance in the medication line.  Depending on the \nnurse disbursing medication, Mr. Busby has to stand in this line on a daily basis to receive \nmedication for his diabetes, hypertension and surgery recovery.  Some nurses come into the pod, \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-7   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 8    PageID 177\nand some pass out meds at the entrance to the pod.  Regardless of how it is handled, it is impossible \nto maintain six feet of distance from others in the medication line. \nIII.  Spatial Conditions and Inability to Practice Social Distancing in H Pod \n13.  Mr. Busby is in H pod, which is in the annex portion of the Shelby County Jail.  \nThe pod has 32 cells on two tiers.  The east side of the pod consists of cells 1-10 on the lower tier \nand cells 15-24. Cells 1 and 2 are for a single-person, and Mr. Busby lives in one of the single-\nperson cells.  The west side contains two tiers, with cells 25-32 on the top and cells 11-14 on the \nbottom. There are ten, round, four-foot in diameter tables down the middle of the pod.  The guard \ndesk and control panel sit along the north wall, and the only entrance to the pod is on the south \nwall.  There are three showers on the south wall between the door and a supply closet.  A small, \nmesh enclosed basketball court sits in the northwest corner of the pod. Mr. Busby reports that there \nare currently 42 men in H pod.  Twenty-six men live in two-person cells, and 16 have a cell to \nthemselves, including Mr. Busby and a person in the other one-person cell.  There are currently \nthree empty cells.  \n14.  Four people in Mr. Busby’s pod tested positive in the April 24th round of testing \nand were moved to the 6th floor.  Mr. Busby’s pod is on the 1st floor.  Prior to those positive tests, \nMr. Busby reports that the men were frequently in close proximity to other people in detention, \nthey did not have masks, and they shared common surfaces with everyone else in H pod. Mr. \nBusby recounts that at least one person lost his sense of smell.  Another man who tested positive \naccompanied Mr. Busby to the medical unit on April 15th because he didn’t feel well.  They \nremoved that man to the Shelby County Detention Center without testing him.  He returned on \nMay 7, 2020 and still had a dry cough and appeared ill. \n15.  According to Mr. Busby, jail staff move throughout H pod in close proximity to the \npeople being detained.  Several of these staff members do not wear masks or gloves.  If guards \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-7   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 8    PageID 178\nneed to access the control panel for the pod, distribute supplies, or do any number of tasks, they \nmust cross the entire length of the pod weaving in and out of tables and chairs frequently occupied \nby the people housed in H pod.  When the Jail changed to a COVID-19 protocol, they moved a \ndesk into the sallyport outside the pod, but the guards still had to walk through the entire pod to \nget to the control desk.  \n16.  Until May 14th, people being detained were on a rotating schedule of being allowed \nout of their cells for two or two and a half hours.  People detained on side A would get out while \npeople on side B were locked in their cells, and then they would switch. If a person was out during \nmealtime, they would eat at a small (4 feet in circumference) table with three other people. Mr. \nBusby reports that the tables are cleaned after each meal.  Both during and after the COVID-19 \nprotocol was in effect, people also sat at the tables to watch TV, play cards, talk, etc.  People sitting \nat the tables are not able to keep six feet of distance between each other.  \n17.  Mr. Busby reports that using the phone kiosk requires a person to stand shoulder to \nshoulder with other people. The kiosks are not sanitized or even wiped down between uses.  They \nare only cleaned two times per day. \n18.  As of May 14, 2020, the Jail ended its COVID-19 protocol.  Mr. Busby reports that \nofficers are coming back in the pod more frequently, and things have returned to pre-COVID \nconditions in a matter of days.  People are even getting haircuts in the pod again. \n19.  There has been no mention of re-testing, nor are officers social distancing from \neach other or detained people.  For example, Mr. Busby has witnessed officers congregating in \nclose proximity around a desk near his pod. \nIV.  Hygienic Condition in H Pod \n20.  According to Mr. Busby, the Jail provides a bar of soap and a small bottle of liquid \nsoap to each detained person.  Staff in the Jail often run out of soap and are unable to provide \n5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-7   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 8    PageID 179\nadditional bars if people run out.  Mr. Busby reports that a person could go several days without \nsoap if he runs out. Mr. Busby is able to purchase additional soap from commissary because he \nhas funds in his commissary account.  However, there are several other people who are not able to \nbuy soap, and they may go days or longer without soap. \n21.  Mr. Busby reports that the pod has only been sprayed down with cleaning/sanitizing \nsolution only once, on May 12, since concerns about the pandemic began in March 2020.  \n22.  Mr. Busby has never seen hand sanitizer in the pod. He does not recall seeing guards \nor prison staff wash their hands or use hand sanitizer.  The guards frequently come close to or have \ncontact with people who are detained in the pod.  \n23.  People detained in the Jail were provided one mask on or around April 22, 2020. \nMr. Busby was only able to obtain one replacement mask by requesting one from a guard who was \nnear him and had multiple masks in his hands.  However, most of the other people detained in his \npod have not received replacement masks.  \nV.  Conditions in Other Pods \n24.  The pod adjacent to H pod, which has a similar layout, had three people test positive \non May 8, 2020.  Mr. Busby reports that occasionally, and often on weekends, when the staffing \nis insufficient, guards perform roving patrols in multiple pods at one time.  Guards are constantly \nmoving among the people in the pod and are often moving among different pods.  Several guards \ndo not wear masks.  Those that do wear masks have used the same mask for several weeks. \n25.  Mr. Busby also reports that two people in pods G and J tested positive on May 8, \n2020. People detained in the G and J pods are workers (known as “rockmen”), responsible for \nlaundry, maintenance, and food preparation. After two people tested positive for COVID-19, the \nother men in those pods continued to perform their jobs as usual, moving throughout the Jail \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-7   Filed 05/20/20   Page 7 of 8    PageID 180\nperforming their tasks, putting them in frequent contact with others despite having been exposed \nto COVID-19.   \nVI.  Medical Treatment in Shelby County Jail \n26.  Mr. Busby reports that several people with COVID-19 symptoms have refused to \ntell nurses about their symptoms for fear of being sent to the 6th floor quarantine pods.  \n27.  Mr. Busby reports that a man in his pod was sent out to quarantine, came back, and \nshowed symptoms again but was not sent back to quarantine. He reports that people are not really \nbeing quarantined.  \n28.  On May 19, 2020, two men from the quarantine pod 6A returned to H pod and \ndescribed a very crowded quarantine environment where people were sleeping in “boats” on the \nfloor and the conditions were described as filthy. Mr. Busby reports that there were more than 60 \nmen in each of three pods on the 6th floor.  One of the men who returned to H pod had been \nhospitalized due to COVID-19. \nVII.  Grievance \n29.  Mr. Busby filed a grievance on May 11, 2020, in which he requested PPE and to be \nallowed to comply with social distance recommendations. He asked for the Jail to release him if \nthey could not provide those things.  As of May 19th, he had not received any response to his \ngrievance.  \n30.  Mr. Busby has been paying close attention to news about COVID-19 and its spread \nthroughout the community.  He described an area within his pod where he maintains a collection \nof news clippings about the pandemic. Consequently, he is highly aware of the disease, how easily \nit spreads, and his particular vulnerability to severe illness or death given his diabetes and \nhypertension. He consistently expressed concern about his inability to follow the recommendations \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-7   Filed 05/20/20   Page 8 of 8    PageID 181\nof public health experts. He feels a great deal of anxiety about contracting COVID-19 while he \nremains in the Jail and often cannot sleep because he is so worried. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my \nknowledge and belief. \nExecuted on this 20th day of May, 2020 Memphis, Tennessee         \n \n/s/ Josh Spickler \nJosh Spickler \nJust City \nP.O.

I am an attorney practicing criminal defense in the Shelby County courts.  I \nrepresent clients at all stages of their criminal prosecution, and I am familiar with the relevant \nappellate practices that accompany such representation. \n2.  I have been practicing law for fourteen (14) years.  \n3.  I have practiced criminal defense for thirteen (13) of those years in Shelby County. \n4.  I am a graduate of The University of Memphis School of Law. \n5.  I  am  the  President-Elect  of  the  Tennessee  Association  of  Criminal  Defense \nLawyers, and beginning in July, 2020, I will serve as President of the Tennessee Association of \nCriminal Defense Lawyers (“TACDL”) for a term of one year. I will then serve another year \nadvising the ensuing President. \n6.  I continue to represent clients who are incarcerated in the Shelby County Jail at 201 \nPoplar. I have visited clients in the Shelby County Jail hundreds of times in the past 13 years. \n7.  I make this declaration of my personal knowledge based on conversations with my \nclients and familiarity with customs and practices inside the jail. \nI.  COVID-19 Concerns at the Shelby County Jail \n8.  Several of my clients have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Several have \nnot been tested despite being housed near and sharing a ventilation system with those who have \ntested positive for the virus.  \n9.  Communication with clients has been almost impossible during the pandemic. \n10.  A process for privileged and private communications between defendants and \nattorneys is not currently provided by the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-8   Filed 05/20/20   Page 3 of 6    PageID 184\n11.  Video conferencing is the only method available for communicating with most \ninmates. Those calls occur on a system with a sign posted above the screen that says to the best of \nmy recollection, “these calls are being recorded.”  \n12.  After the defense bar raised this concern with local judges, several attorneys \ninformed me that the sign now says the calls are not being recorded. \n13.  I have seen the calls played before juries and believe that the calls can still be \nrecorded.  I have no direct knowledge of whether the calls are being recorded. \n14.  During the few opportunities I have had to communicate with clients via a five-\nminute free phone call that they are allowed, defendants mostly try to pass messages about their \nhealth status to their families. \n15.  My clients that have been able to contact me report that the Shelby County Jail is \nnot adhering to public health protocols to protect them from contracting COVID-19 in the Jail.  \n16.  For example, the Jail does not house detained people in a way that allows for social \ndistancing of six feet or more at all times.  Most clients are housed in open pods that do not allow \nfor social distancing, but are encouraged to social distance the best they can by the staff. \n17.  Additionally, clients have reported the difficulty in receiving basic humanitarian \nand hygienic services in the jail.  \n18.  The Jail has not provided any of my clients with any hand sanitizer. \n19.  The Jail has not provided my clients with disinfecting supplies or cleaning supplies. \n20.  The Jail has not provided my clients with reliable access to hand soap so that they \ncan wash their hands.  All clients have informed me that soap must be purchased through an \ninmate’s private commissary account. If an inmate cannot afford commissary, the Jail issues that \ninmate one bar of soap per week. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-8   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 6    PageID 185\n21.  Clients have also reported that, due to depleted staff, their clothes had not been \ncleaned in the laundry for an entire week, meaning that detained people wore the same clothes for \none week. \n22.  Further, the Jail does not test individuals for COVID-19 when they are booked into \ncustody, nor does it test all staff who enter and exit the Jail on a daily basis. \n23.  I have had clients describe people in their pod who exhibit symptoms of COVID-\n19, including constant coughing, and various other symptoms of the virus.  Those people have not \nbeen tested for COVID-19.  One client noted that symptomatic detainees remained in their housing \nunit for “about two weeks” without ever being tested. \n24.  All clients state that jail staff or working detainees enter their pod to provide meals \nthree times daily and a fourth time for mail call as is the regular practice before the pandemic. \n25.  Some clients have described that new people are added to their pod regularly about \nevery other day. Others lawyers have told me that their clients have stated that they are housed in \nthe “program pod” and new people have not been placed in their pod for seven months. \n26.  According to clients that tested positive for the virus and were assigned to sixth \nfloor COVID-19 quarantine pods, those infected with the virus were also not provided hand \nsanitizer and were not allowed any soap other than the policy described above in ¶¶ 18-20.  \n27.  Several clients housed on the fifth floor have expressed concern about contracting \na respiratory virus from COVID-19 positive detainees quarantined on the sixth floor as both groups \nare breathing the same air through the same ventilation system. \nII.  Practices in Local Courts \n28.  In my experience, it typically takes at best five business days for a request for a \nbond reduction motion to be heard by the court.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-8   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 6    PageID 186\n29.  To revisit a client’s initial ex parte bond setting, I would have to file a written \nmotion for bond review, submit an order for a pre-trial report to be submitted to the trial court, \npossibly wait for the State to respond, and then set it on for a hearing.  If the Court decided to issue \na ruling on the bond request, I estimate the process would take approximately five days to two \nweeks in the local courts. \n30.  An appeal of a request for a bond reduction goes to the Tennessee Court of Criminal \nAppeals. This process typically takes several weeks, and again involves an opportunity for the \nstate to respond, and an eventual order from the Court of Criminal Appeals.  I estimate that this \nprocess under normal circumstances generally takes a month to six weeks. \n31.  For clients in jail pre-trial, this process is the primary method for seeking release. \n32.  To my knowledge, by statute, a state court writ of habeas corpus is only available \nwhere a petitioner raises: (1) a claim that a void judgment was facially invalid because the \nconvicting court was without jurisdiction or authority to sentence the defendant; or (2) a claim that \na defendant's sentence has expired.  Benson v. State, 2019 WL 1388195 (Tenn. Ct. Cr. App. 2019) \n(discussing T.C.A. §§ 29-21-101, -130, citing Stephenson v. Carlton, 28 S.W.3d 910, 911 (Tenn. \n2000)). To my knowledge, a habeas petition in the Tennessee state courts is not available for pre-\ntrial detainees. \n33.  Tennessee  courts,  including  those  in  Shelby  County,  are  issuing  emergency \nclosures and significantly slowing their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n34.  Even when a client gets a court date, it is highly reliable that a defendant will not \nbe transported to court as scheduled. Jail staff sometimes refuses to transport clients due to \nCOVID-19 concerns.  \n35.  All transportation between inmates in TDOC facilities and local jails has stopped. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359   Document 2-8   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 6    PageID 187\n36.  Clients are also usually not brought to court from the attached jail. Until today, I \nhad not seen any defendant, even those who are not my client, brought into a courtroom since \nMarch 10th, 2020 just days before the statewide court closure. \n37.  Court  cancellations  are  common  and  vary  by  judge.  Some  court  dates  for \nincarcerated inmates are reset prior to court opening. Cases may also be reset prior to defense \ncounsel being allowed into the courtroom because a particular prosecutor may not be present. \n38.  I am not aware of any avenue in the state court system through which a class of \npretrial detainees could seek relief regarding the constitutionality of their confinement in the \nShelby County Jail. As a TACDL officer, I have researched this issue often. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.   \n \nExecuted this 20 day of May, 2020. \n \n/s/ Michael R.

Whitlock v. FSL \nMgmt., LLC, 843 F.3d 1084, 1089-90 (6th Cir. 2016). In addition to satisfying the requirements of \nRule 23(a), the class must fit under one of the three subdivisions of Rule 23(b). Coleman v. GMAC, \n296 F.3d 443, 446 (6th Cir. 2002). “The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has \n \n1 Respondents-Defendants additionally rely upon and incorporate the arguments contained within their Motion to \nDismiss and their Response in Opposition to Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order filed \nin this cause. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 26   Filed 05/26/20   Page 2 of 8    PageID 339\nrecognized that the ‘class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and \non behalf of the individual named parties only.’” Cole v. City of Memphis, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n183492, *11 (W.D. Tenn. Sept. 29, 2014) (citing In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer \nProducts Liab. Litig., 722 F.3d 838, 850 (6th Cir. 2013)). Accordingly, this Court has provided, \n“A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule \n— that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common \nquestions of law or fact, etc.” Id. at *11 (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541 \n(2011)); see also Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997) (explaining that \nplaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the propriety of class certification by a preponderance of \nthe evidence)). \nLAW & ARGUMENT \nA.  FAILURE TO PRESENT ACTUAL EVIDENCE \nAs a threshold matter, Petitioners have presented no actual evidence about the proposed \nclass. Instead, Petitioners rely upon the allegations of their Petition and multiple exhibits and/or \ndeclarations containing hearsay, which is simply insufficient. See Rega v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. \nCo., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151336, *10 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 22, 2012) (“[S]ome circuits expressly \nbar district courts from presuming that the plaintiffs' allegations in the complaint are 'true for \npurposes of the class motion…without resolving factual and legal issues that strongly influence \nthe wisdom of class treatment.’”); see also Gooch v. Life Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 672 F.3d 402, \n417 (6th Cir. 2012) (endorsing the view that a district court may probe behind the pleadings to \ndecide the certification question when it is necessary to resolve disputed factual and legal issues \nthat impact the wisdom of class treatment)). Thus, this Court should deny certification.2 \n \n2 Due to the lack of evidence offered by Petitioners, Petitioners have failed to establish the numerosity element \nnecessary for class certification.  \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 26   Filed 05/26/20   Page 3 of 8    PageID 340\nB.  FAILURE TO ESTABLISH COMMONALITY AND/OR TYPICALITY \nUnder Rule 23(a)(2), a plaintiff must show that “there are questions of law or fact common \nto the class.” Davis v. Cintas Corp., 717 F.3d 476, 487 (6th Cir. 2013); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). A \nquestion of law or fact is common to the class if it is “capable of classwide resolution—which \nmeans that its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the \nclaims in one stroke.” Dukes, 131 S.Ct. at 2545. As the Supreme Court explained in Dukes: \nWhat matters to class certification…is not the raising of common “questions”—\neven in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate \ncommon answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation. Dissimilarities within \nthe proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common \nanswers. \n \nId. \nLikewise, Petitioners’ claims must also be typical of the class members’ claims: \nTypicality is met if the class members’ claims are “fairly encompassed by the \nnamed plaintiffs’ claims.” Sprague v. Gen. Motors Corp., 133 F.3d 388, 399 (6th \nCir. 1998) (en banc) (quoting [In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th \nCir. 1996)]). This requirement insures that the representatives' interests are aligned \nwith the interests of the represented class members so that, by pursuing their own \ninterests, the class representatives also advocate the interests of the class members. \nId. \n \nThese two concepts of commonality and typicality “tend to merge” in practice \nbecause both of them “serve as guideposts for determining whether under the \nparticular circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether \nthe named plaintiff's claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests \nof the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.” \nDukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 n.5. \n \nIn re Whirlpool Corp., 722 F.3d at 852-53 (considering commonality, typicality, and adequate \nrepresentation together due to their “intertwined nature”). \n  Moreover, in Money v. Pritzker, the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof Illinois recently denied a similar request for class certification involving inmates seeking relief \nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Money v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63599 (N.D. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 26   Filed 05/26/20   Page 4 of 8    PageID 341\nIll.  April  10,  2020).  In  Money,  the  Court  provided,  “The  imperative  of  individualized \ndeterminations, recognized by both sides in this case, makes this case inappropriate for class \ntreatment.” Id. *50-51. The Court explained: \nEach putative class member comes with a unique situation—different crimes, \nsentences,  outdates,  disciplinary  histories,  age,  medical  history,  places  of \nincarceration, proximity to infected inmates, availability of a home landing spot, \nlikelihood of transmitting the virus to someone at home detention, likelihood of \nviolation or recidivism, and danger to the community. \n \nId. at *51. While acknowledging that perfect uniformity is not required, the Court reiterated, “But \nit does require more uniformity that these Plaintiffs would have on the only matter ‘apt to drive \nthe  resolution  of  the  litigation’—namely,  which  class  members  should  actually  be given  a \nfurlough?” Id. (citing Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2541). \n  Similar to the Court in Money, this Court should deny Petitioners’ request for class \ncertification. Here, Petitioners are requesting this Court to certify a class, as well as a subclass, \nconsisting of “[a]ll persons currently or in the future held at the Jail in pretrial custody during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic who are 55 and older, as well as all persons currently or in the future held at \nthe Jail of any age” who suffer from an array of medical conditions. (ECF No. 3, PageID 214). In \nsupport of their request, Petitioners have included the following questions: (1) Does COVID-19 \npresent a risk of harm so severe to Class members detained at Shelby County Jail that the only \nconstitutionally permissible way to protect them is to release them? (2) Have Defendants failed to \nprovide Subclass members reasonable modifications to protect against COVID-19 in violation of \ndisability rights laws? (3) Is release of Class and Subclass members from custody in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic the only way the Jail can adequately protect vulnerable people from injury \nor death?” (ECF No. 3, PageID 222).  \nWhile each of these proposed class members would ultimately seek the similar relief of \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 26   Filed 05/26/20   Page 5 of 8    PageID 342\nrelease from incarceration, the dissimilarities of said individuals – loosely defined by Petitioners \nas “hundreds of people,” some of which are  future inmates/detainees – would undoubtedly \n“impede the generation of common answers” to the questions posed. Said differences would \nnecessarily include, but are not limited to, whether each detainee/inmate can obtain necessary \nmedical treatment within the Jail; whether the detainee/inmate can be safely released, especially \nconsidering the specific safety risks that each detainee/inmate would pose to his/her immediate \nfamily, prior victims, and the public at large3; whether the detainee/inmate has a safe host site; \nwhether that host site poses less risk of infection than the Jail; and whether the detainee/inmate \nmight potentially put a vulnerable family member and/or the public at large at risk of infection. \nEach of these issues would mandate an individualized assessment before determining whether the \nrelease of each specific detainee/inmate would be practicable, beneficial, and safe.  \nTo that extent, the Tennessee Constitution provides certain basic constitutional rights to \nthe victims of crimes. See Tenn. Const. art. I § 35. The applicable constitutional provision sets out \neight specific rights for victims, including the right to “[t]he right to be heard, when relevant, at all \ncritical stages of the criminal justice process as defined by the General Assembly,” “the right to be \ninformed of all proceedings, and of the release, transfer or escape of the accused or convicted \nperson,” and “[t]he right to be present at all proceedings where the defendant has the right to be \npresent.”  Id.; see also Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-38-101 to 40-38-117; State v. Mutory, 581 S.W.3d \n741, 749 (Tenn. 2019). Moreover, Tennessee law provides that Tennessee courts must consider \nnumerous factors in determining whether a pretrial detainee should be released and whether and \nfor what amount bond should be set, including: (1) The defendant’s length of residence in the \ncommunity; (2) The defendant’s employment status and history, and financial condition; (3) The \n \n3 Both of the named Petitioners are each currently being detained on multiple felony charges. See Respondents’ \nResponse in Opposition to Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 26   Filed 05/26/20   Page 6 of 8    PageID 343\ndefendant’s family ties and relationships; (4) The defendant’s reputation, character and mental \ncondition; (5) The defendant’s prior criminal record, including prior releases on recognizance or \nbail; (6) The identity of responsible members of the community who will vouch for defendant's \nreliability; (7) The nature of the offense and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely \nsentence, insofar as these factors are relevant to the risk of nonappearance; and (8) Any other \nfactors indicating the defendant’s ties to the community or bearing on the risk of willful failure to \nappear. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-11-115(b). Said provisions further highlight the specific and \nindividualized nature of the assessment necessary to determine each detainee/inmate’s eligibility \nand need for release.   \nUltimately, because the lack of commonality and typicality would impede any single \nremedy in this cause, the resolution of Petitioners’ asserted common questions would not resolve \nthis case. Thus, the request for class certification should be denied. \nCONCLUSION \nBased upon the above and upon the record as a whole, Respondents respectfully request \nthat the Court enter an order denying Petitioners’ Motion for Class Certification. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 26   Filed 05/26/20   Page 7 of 8    PageID 344\nRespectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \n      By:   s/J.

(ECF \nNo. 3.)  On May 26, 2020, along with their Response to the TRO Motion, Defendants filed a \nMotion to Dismiss, and a Response to the Motion for Class Certification.  (ECF Nos. 25, 26.)  \nThis Court denied Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss and granted in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nClass Certification on June 10, 2020.  (ECF No. 38.)   \nIn their TRO Motion, Plaintiffs seek urgent habeas and injunctive relief to protect \nmedically vulnerable people and people with disabilities detained at the Shelby County Jail \n(“Jail”).  Plaintiffs allege that their constitutional rights, under the Fourteenth Amendment, and \ntheir statutory rights, under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, are \nbeing violated.  (ECF No. 2 at PageID 53-59.)  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that because testing, \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 45   Filed 06/12/20   Page 2 of 4    PageID 732\nscreening, social distancing and hygiene measures are deficient at the Jail, only immediate \nrelease of medically vulnerable inmates will vindicate their constitutional and statutory rights.  \n(Id. at PageID 50-51.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that the confinement of medically \nvulnerable people in a congregate setting like the Jail is itself unconstitutional.  (ECF No. 2, \nPageID 47.)  Defendants contend in the Response that they are following all applicable \nstandards.  (ECF No. 27.)  \nANALYSIS \nWhen deciding whether to issue a temporary restraining order, courts consider whether \nthe moving party establishes the following four factors:  (1) a strong or substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) irreparable harm unless injunctive relief is granted; (3) that the \nrequested relief will cause substantial harm to third parties; and (4) whether injunctive relief is in \nthe public interest.  Northeast Ohio Coal. for Homeless and Service Emps. Int'l Union v. \nBlackwell, 467 F.3d 999 (6th Cir. 2006).  The final two factors “merge when the Government is \nthe opposing party.”  Gun Owners of Am., Inc. v. Barr, 2019 WL 1395502, at *1 (6th Cir. \nMar. 25, 2019).  The standard for issuing a TRO is essentially the same as for a preliminary \ninjunction.  See ABX Air, Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Airline Div., 219 F. Supp. 3d 665, 670 \n(S.D. Ohio 2016).   \nHere, the lack of a developed factual record prevents the Court from ruling on the merits.  \nConsideration of Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory allegations requires a detailed \nexamination of the facts.  See, e.g., Cameron v. Bouchard, Case No. 20-1469 (6th Cir. Jun. 11, \n2020) (noting that “all Eighth Amendment cases” require a “detailed examination of a distinct \nfactual record”) (Cole, C.J., dissenting).  No such record is before the Court.  Plaintiffs and \nDefendants take divergent positions on several critical factual issues.  For instance, the Parties \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 45   Filed 06/12/20   Page 3 of 4    PageID 733\ndispute whether inmates are socially distanced, whether appropriate cleaning procedures have \nbeen implemented and whether inmates have proper access to hygiene supplies.   \nWhile this § 2241 case is about the fact of confinement and does not challenge the \nconditions themselves, the Court must have more evidence as to how Plaintiffs are being housed \nto determine whether there exist constitutional or statutory violations.  Because material facts are \ncontested here, an evidentiary hearing must be held before injunctive relief is considered.  See \nCertified Restoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 553 (6th Cir. \n2007) (noting that “where facts are bitterly contested and credibility determinations must be \nmade to decide whether injunctive relief should issue, an evidentiary hearing must be held”).   \nThe Court is mindful that analysis of the other TRO factors may favor Plaintiffs.  The \nexceptionally dangerous nature of the COVID-19 pandemic is lost on none.  Yet, because the \nfacts require further development to determine likelihood of success on these particular claims, a \nruling on the Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order is held in abeyance.  See Obama for \nAm. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012) (“When a party seeks a preliminary injunction \non the basis of a potential constitutional violation, the likelihood of success on the merits often \nwill be the determinative factor.”) (quotation marks omitted). \nWhile further fact-finding is still necessary, the Court notes that the allegations of the \nlack of appropriate accommodations for at-risk inmates are disturbing.  Amid this public health \ncrisis, medically vulnerable people have been urged to take strong precautions.  Yet, the \nvulnerable people seeking relief here are at the mercy of Jail officials as to the precautions \nimplemented.  As an example of the Court’s concern, the Class and Subclass lists filed by \nDefendants (ECF Nos. 43, 44 (sealed)) show that some members are being housed in dormitory-\nstyle arrangements.  This Court will not hesitate to act appropriately if it finds that Defendants \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 45   Filed 06/12/20   Page 4 of 4    PageID 734\nhave, in fact, violated medically vulnerable inmates’ constitutional rights.  See Jones v. North \nCarolina Prisoners' Union, 433 U.S. 119, 137 (1977) (noting that a prisoner does not lose his \nconstitutional protections “as he passes through the prison's gates”).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court’s ruling on the Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order is held in abeyance.  \nDue to the conflicting facts presented by the Parties and pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence \n706, the Court will order an inspection of the Jail by an Independent Inspector.  The Parties are \nhereby ORDERED to submit a joint recommendation for an Independent Inspector no later than \n5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, June 16, 2020 as well as a proposed scope of inspection.  If the Parties \nare unable to agree on an inspector or on the scope, each party is to propose two \nrecommendations, along with curriculum vitae and a letter no longer than three pages, with \nsupporting grounds for selection as well as a proposed scope.  The Inspection will take place as \nsoon as possible with the purpose of providing the Court and the Parties an independent \nassessment of the way in which COVID-19 is being taken into account in the Jail.    \nThe Court will hold a hearing on June 30, 2020 at 9:00 a.m. to hear from the \nIndependent Inspector on his or her findings as well as any other proof the Parties wish to offer.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 12th day of June, 2020. \ns/ Sheryl H. Lipman         \nSHERYL H. LIPMAN \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n \n4 \n ",

Shelby County agrees to implement the recommendations of the \nVentilation Expert; or, within fourteen (14) days of receiving the written advice of the Ventilation \nExpert, to explain to the Ventilation Expert, Independent Inspector, and Plaintiffs’ counsel in \nwriting why it will not or cannot despite using its best efforts to do so.  Defendants and Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel will equally share the Ventilation Expert’s costs and fees. \nV.  Testing, Isolation, and Quarantine for COVID-19 \n14.  All detainees and staff who are displaying the symptoms of COVID-19 as defined \nby the CDC shall be offered a test for COVID-19 as soon as practicable.  \n15.  All individuals tested for COVID-19 shall be informed of their test results as soon \nas practicable.   \n16.  When a person tests positive for COVID-19, the Jail shall use best efforts and all \navailable resources, including cameras, logs, and other records, to perform contact tracing in \naccordance with both the CDC’s guidelines and the guidelines of the Shelby County Health \nDepartment and will offer to test and shall quarantine any detainees who would be, based upon \ninformation learned via said contact tracing, recommended to be quarantined by the applicable \nguidelines from the CDC and/or the Shelby County Health Department.   \n17.  Detainees who test positive for COVID-19 will be isolated in accordance with CDC \nguidelines and will not be allowed into the general population unless or until permitted pursuant \nto the CDC guidelines.  \n18.  Detainees held in isolation or quarantine because they have contracted or been \nexposed to COVID-19 shall have access to personal items and property, recreation time, and \nmedical care. \nVI.  Hygiene and Personal Protective Equipment \n19.  Defendants will provide (a) Class and Subclass members access to cleaning agents \nand materials to clean their cells and sleeping areas, in addition to the scheduling cleaning times; \nand, (b) within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, Class and Subclass members with either (i) \nthree surgical masks replaced weekly or (ii) two cloth masks not less than two-ply that shall be \nlaundered twice a week by the Jail’s laundry services and that shall be replaced as needed (the \n“Two-Ply Masks”).  If within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date, Defendants are not in \npossession of a sufficient number of the Two-Ply Masks, then it may supply Class and Subclass \nmembers with two cloth masks approved by the Tennessee Department of Health (laundered twice \na week by the Jail’s laundry services and replaced as needed) which it will replace continuously \nwith Two-Ply Masks as soon as Defendants, acting with all reasonable dispatch and using their \nbest efforts, acquire them. \nVII.  Social Distancing \n20.  In keeping with the June 18, 2020 Order (ECF No. 56), the Independent Inspector \nshall review the Jail’s efforts to maximize social distancing, including by reviewing the safety of \nthe population levels of the Jail’s housing areas, and the work of the Jail’s Expeditor, and make \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-2   Filed 01/22/21   Page 7 of 9    PageID 3209\n \nrecommendations, as informed by the CDC and other industry-related guidance on COVID-19 \nsafety  measures,  regarding  how  Defendants  can  and  should  maximize  social  distancing.  \nDefendants shall implement those recommendations, or explain (in accordance with Paragraph 10) \nwhy, using their best efforts, Defendants will not or cannot adopt the Independent Inspector’s \nrecommendation(s). \nVIII.  Enforcement and Modification \n21.  This Court shall retain jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of modifying or \nenforcing this Decree. \n22.  Dispute Resolution.  If a party to this Decree believes a dispute exists relating to \nthe performance or interpretation of this Decree, counsel for the party will notify opposing counsel \nin writing, describing the dispute and clearly identifying that they are invoking the dispute \nresolution practice.  The other party shall respond in writing to such notice within seven (7) \nbusiness days of receipt of the notice.  Within seven (7) business days of receipt of the response, \ncounsel for both parties shall meet and confer and attempt to resolve the issue.  If, however, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are notified of an issue posing an immediate and serious risk to the health and \nsafety of Plaintiffs or Class or Subclass members that requires prompt resolution to protect the \nhealth of Plaintiffs or Class or Subclass members, Plaintiffs’ counsel will provide written notice \nto Defendants’ counsel and the parties will engage in good-faith efforts to resolve the matter prior \nto Plaintiffs seeking court intervention.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Plaintiffs reserve the right \nto seek court intervention in a shorter timeframe than described elsewhere in this Paragraph should \nan issue they reasonably believe requires prompt resolution to protect the health and safety of Class \nor Subclass members arise.  Only if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through the process \ndescribed in this Paragraph may the dispute be submitted for judicial resolution. \n23.  Court Resolution. Subsequent to the parties engaging in and completing the \ndispute resolution process as set forth in Paragraph 22, Plaintiffs may seek enforcement of this \ndecree if Defendants fail to comply with any terms of this Decree, including if Plaintiffs have a \ngood  faith  basis  to  believe  that  Defendants  have  not  engaged  best  efforts  to  adopt  the \nrecommendations of the Independent Inspector or the Ventilation Expert (if applicable pursuant to \nParagraph 13).  If Plaintiffs seek enforcement of this Decree and obtain relief from the Court as a \nresult of seeking such enforcement, Plaintiffs may seek an award of the reasonable attorneys’ fees \nand costs incurred in seeking enforcement of this Decree.  Should Plaintiffs elect under such \ncircumstances to seek enforcement of this Decree and the Court deny the relief sought on grounds \nthat Plaintiffs’ action is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, Defendants may seek an \naward of the reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in responding to Plaintiffs’ attempt to \nseek such enforcement. \n24.  Changes to Defendants’ Policies and Procedures.  Plaintiffs recognize that \nDefendants maintain discretion to implement any and all policies and procedures in responding to \nemergency situations related to the COVID-19 pandemic taking into consideration legitimate \npenological interests, constitutional requirements, and their overarching goals and objectives in \npreventing the spread of COVID-19.  Defendants will act in good faith when exercising their \ndiscretion and best efforts related to this Decree.  Nothing in this Decree limits Defendants’ \ndiscretion to respond as it deems necessary to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the event that such a \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-2   Filed 01/22/21   Page 8 of 9    PageID 3210\n \nresponse requires a modification of the terms of this Decree, Defendants will give Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel notice of the change as soon as practicable, but within fourteen (14) days of any material \nalteration.  Plaintiffs’ counsel retains the ability to challenge the use of such discretion if Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel has reason to believe that Defendants have not exercised their discretion in good faith.  \nShould any dispute under this provision need to be resolved by the Court, Paragraph 23 shall apply \nas to awarding fees and costs to the party obtaining relief from the Court.  Given the evolving \nunderstanding of COVID-19, the changing access to resources and treatments, and the appropriate \nresponses to it, Defendants will continue in good faith to take and incorporate input and updated \nguidance from the CDC, WHO, Independent Inspector, Ventilation Expert (if applicable pursuant \nto Paragraph 13), and other public health authorities. \n25.  Other Modifications.  The parties may mutually agree to changes to this Decree \nat any time before the entry of a final judgment pursuant to the terms of this Decree.  If the parties \nare able to agree on a necessary change to this Decree, they shall present any such changes to the \nCourt for approval by joint motion. \nIX.  Confidentiality \n26.  Any information disclosed, shared, or obtained by any party in connection with this \nDecree and marked “Confidential” is subject to the Stipulated Protective Order dated June 29, \n2020 (ECF No. 75). \nX.  Stay of Litigation \n27.  Upon entry of this Decree, the case shall be stayed unless and until Plaintiffs \nundertake any action to seek enforcement of this Decree pursuant to the provisions herein.  On \nmotion by either party, the Court will consider whether to lift the stay in the case.  \nXI.  Termination \n28.  This Decree will terminate upon the earliest of either (a) a declaration by the CDC \nand the Tennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and/or has ended, \nor (b) an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine is offered to and administered according to FDA \nguidelines to all detainees housed at the Jail for a period of more than fourteen (14) days and who \naccept  a  vaccination,  along  with  educational  materials  about  the  vaccine  and  non-punitive \nincentives to take the vaccine.  Upon termination of this Decree pursuant to this Paragraph, the \nparties shall inform the Court and the Court shall enter a final judgment of dismissal. \n29.    If this Decree has not otherwise terminated one year after the Effective Date, the \nparties may, at any time, jointly move the Court to terminate the Decree.  If the parties do not agree \nthat the Decree should terminate one year after the Effective Date, Defendants shall have the right, \nat any time, to petition the Court to terminate the Decree on the grounds that the Decree is no \nlonger necessary. \nXII.  No Prevailing Party \n30.  No Party shall be considered to be the “prevailing” or “successful” party within the \nmeaning of any statute or law as a result of this Decree. Each party shall bear its own costs, \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 161-2   Filed 01/22/21   Page 9 of 9    PageID 3211\n \nattorneys’ fees, and expenses incurred up to the date of the entry of this Decree, except for as \noutlined within the Release and Settlement Agreement agreed upon by the parties. \nXIII.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) \n31.  For purposes of jurisdiction and enforcement of this Decree only, the parties jointly \nrequest that the Court find that this Decree satisfies the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A) \nin that it is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct any violation of a federal \nright, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct any violation of the federal rights of the \nPlaintiffs. Notwithstanding, nothing in this Decree shall be construed as an admission by any party \nof any wrongful conduct whatsoever against any person or party.   \n \nJudgment is hereby entered in accordance with the foregoing Decree this ____ day of \n____________, 2021. \n \n              ____________________________________ \n      The Honorable Sheryl H. Lipman \n \n8 \n ",

      "text": "Case 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 1 of 24    PageID 5060\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE \nWESTERN DIVISION \n)\nFAVIAN BUSBY and MICHAEL \n)\nEDGINGTON, on their own behalf and on \n)\nbehalf of those similarly situated, \n)\nPlaintiffs, \n)\n)\nv. \nNo. 20-cv-2359-SHL-atc \n)\n \n) \nFLOYD BONNER, JR., in his official \n) \ncapacity, and SHELBY COUNTY \n)\nSHERIFF’S OFFICE, \n)\nDefendants.  \n) \n \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO TERMINATE THE CONSENT \nDECREE \n \n \nBefore the Court is Defendants’ Motion to Terminate the Consent Decree, (ECF \nNo. 218), filed June 2, 2021, which has been fully briefed, as well as additional briefing filed by \nthe Parties following a hearing on the Motion to Terminate, (ECF Nos. 254, 255), filed on \nAugust 11 and 16, 2021.  The Court heard argument on the Motion on August 6 and 9, 2021, \n(ECF Nos. 246, 249), during which the Parties presented proof on the limited question of \nwhether Defendants had complied with the termination provision in the Parties’ Consent Decree, \nthus warranting termination of the Decree.  (See ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 28.)   \nFor the reasons stated below, Defendants’ Motion to Terminate the Consent Decree is \nDENIED.   \nFollowing this Order, the Court will turn to several motions which are currently pending.  \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce and to Modify the Consent Decree, (ECF No. 216), filed May 19, \n2021, and fully briefed, was held in abeyance pending the Court’s adjudication of the Motion to \nTerminate, (see ECF No. 233).  In connection with this Motion, the Court denied as premature \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 2 of 24    PageID 5061\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Discovery on an Expedited Basis as to the request for discovery into issues \nraised in their Motion to Enforce and Modify Consent Decree.  (See ECF Nos. 224, 233.)  The \nParties are DIRECTED to confer and file a Notice on the docket as to how they would like to \nproceed on these Motions within 7 days of the entry of this Order.   \nBACKGROUND1 \n  Defendants seek to terminate the Consent Decree, agreed to by the Parties in a settlement \nof Plaintiffs’ class action for declarative and injunctive relief and/or a writ of habeas corpus \nunder 48 U.S.C. § 2241 as well Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which was made effective upon its filing with the Court on \nJanuary 22, 2021, (ECF No. 161-2), and approved on a preliminary basis by the Court on \nJanuary 28, 2021, (ECF No. 162).  After the Parties resolved issues that were brought to the \nCourt’s attention regarding effective notice to the class, (ECF Nos. 176, 181), the Court granted \nfinal approval of the Settlement on April 12, 2021, (ECF No. 209).  On June 2, 2021, Defendants \ndetermined that they had fully complied with the Consent Decree’s termination provision and \nmoved to terminate the Decree.  Specifically, Defendants contend that they have complied with \nsubsection (b) of Paragraph 28,2 which provides that the Consent Decree will terminate when:  \nan FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine is offered to and administered according to \nFDA guidelines to all detainees housed at the Jail for a period of more than \n \n1 For a more detailed recitation of the background of this case, see the Court’s Order Granting In \nPart and Denying In Part Plaintiffs’ Motions to Postpone the Effective Date of the Stay and For \nDiscovery On An Expedited Basis and Holding In Abeyance Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce and to \nModify Consent Decree and Defendants’ Motion to Terminate Consent Decree, (ECF No. 233), \nthe Court’s Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action Settlement, (ECF No. 209), and the \nCourt’s Order Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (ECF No. 124).  \n \n2 Subsection (a) of Paragraph 28 provides that the Consent Decree may also terminate when the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the Tennessee Department of Health \ndeclare “that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and/or has ended[.]”  (ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 28.)  \nThis subsection is, of course (and unfortunately), inapplicable. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 3 of 24    PageID 5062\nfourteen (14) days and who accept a vaccination, along with educational materials \nabout the vaccine and non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine. Upon \ntermination of this Decree pursuant to this Paragraph, the parties shall inform the \nCourt and the Court shall enter a final judgment of dismissal. \n \n(ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 28.) \n \nAfter Defendants filed their Motion, Plaintiffs filed Motions to Postpone the Effective \nDate of the Stay and for Discovery on an Expedited Basis.  (ECF Nos. 223, 224.)  On August 6 \nand 9, 2021, the Court held a hearing on the pending Motions, which also included Plaintiffs’ \nMotion to Enforce and to Modify the Consent Decree, (ECF No. 216), after which the Court \nentered an Order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Postponement of the Effective Date of the Stay, \ngranting in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Discovery on an Expedited Basis, setting a hearing on \nDefendants’ Motion to Terminate, and holding Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce and to Modify the \nConsent Decree in abeyance.  The Court’s determination that a hearing on the Motion to \nTerminate was necessary constituted good cause to postpone the 18 U.S.C. § 3626(e) automatic \nstay for 60 days as permitted by 18 U.S.C. § 3626 (e)(3), to August 31, 2021.  The Court set an \nexpedited schedule for the Parties to conduct discovery and set an August 6th hearing on \nDefendants’ Motion to Terminate.  (ECF No. 233.) \nAlthough the hearing on Defendants’ Motion to Terminate began on August 6, 2021, as \nscheduled, it was not completed that day and continued on August 9, 2021, with Defendants’ \nrebuttal.  Defendants presented Chief Kirk Fields as their only witness both in their case in chief \nand on rebuttal.  Plaintiffs presented expert witness Dr. Stefano Bertozzi, the Court’s \nIndependent Inspector Mike Brady, and Detainee-witnesses Brandon Hibbler, Ronnie Woods, \nand Richard Wright.  Collectively, the Parties introduced 32 exhibits.  Additionally, between the \nhearings, Plaintiffs filed excerpts from Chief Fields’ deposition testimony, (ECF No. 248), to \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 4 of 24    PageID 5063\nwhich Defendants responded with the filing of their own excerpts from Chief Fields’ deposition \ntestimony after the conclusion of the hearing, (ECF No. 253).  \nAt the end of the hearing, the Court set a schedule for additional post-hearing briefing.  \n(ECF No. 249.)  Plaintiffs filed a Post-Hearing Brief in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to \nTerminate the Consent Decree, (ECF No. 254), on August 11, 2021, and Defendants filed a \nResponse on August 16, 2021, (ECF No. 255).  Finally, Plaintiffs filed the Final Report of \nIndependent Inspector Mike Brady’s Fourth Covid-19 Follow Up Inspection of the Jail as a \nSupplemental Exhibit on August 26, 2021.  (ECF No. 257-1.)3 \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  In the typical case subject to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 18 U.S.C. 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626(b), “prospective relief” is “terminable upon the motion of any party—2 years after \nthe date the court granted or approved the prospective relief.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(1)(i). \nHowever, prospective relief “shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the \nrecord that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the \nFederal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and \nthat the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the \nviolation.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(3).  A circuit split exists as to which party bears the burden of \ndemonstrating that there are, or are not, ongoing constitutional violations and that the relief is \nnarrowly drawn.  Compare Coleman v. Brown, 938 F. Supp. 2d 955, 959–60 (E.D. Cal. 2013) \n(quoting Graves v. Arpaio, 623 F.3d 1043, 1048 (9th Cir.2010)) (“[a]s the moving party, \ndefendants have the burden of demonstrating ‘that there are no ongoing constitutional violations, \n \n3 The Court notes that Plaintiffs also filed Mr. Brady’s Fourth Inspection Report at ECF No. 256, \nin support of their Motion to Enforce and to Modify the Consent Decree.  (ECF No. 216.) \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 5 of 24    PageID 5064\nthat the relief ordered exceeds what is necessary to correct an ongoing constitutional violation, or \nboth’”) with Guajardo v. Texas Dep’t of Crim. Just., 363 F.3d 392, 395 (5th Cir. 2004) (after a \ndefendant seeking termination allows for the requisite passage of time, “the burden of proof then \nshifts to the prisoners to demonstrate ongoing violations and that the relief is narrowly drawn”). \nHere, as the Court observed in its recent Order concerning the Parties’ various cross-\nmotions, the Court has not had the occasion to reach or rule on alleged ongoing violations of \nFederal rights.  Moreover, Defendants’ Motion was not brought after the 2-year period \nprescribed by § 3626(b)(1)(i).  As noted in the Court’s recent Order, Defendants’ Motion is \nproperly viewed under § 3626(b)(4), which permits a Motion to Terminate to be brought at any \ntime by any party if legally permissible.  Given this posture, the authority above is not perfectly \napposite.  The issue then before the Court is a narrow question of contract interpretation—\nwhether Defendants have met the requirements of the termination provision in the Consent \nDecree.  Thus, the Court finds that Defendants, who have brought the Motion to Terminate on \nthe basis of their asserted compliance with the Consent Decree’s termination provision, bear the \nburden of proof.  Peery v. City of Miami, 977 F.3d 1061, 1073 (11th Cir. 2020) (holding, in a \nnon-PLRA context, that “[t]he party seeking to terminate a consent decree ‘bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion’ to justify termination”).   \nANALYSIS \nIn the Court’s recent Order concerning the Parties’ various cross-motions, including \nDefendants’ Motion to Terminate, (ECF No. 233), the Court opened with few words about \nconsent decrees, which bear repeating here.  Consent decrees “are at once both contracts and \norders, . . . construed largely as contracts, but [] enforced as orders.”  Berger v. Heckler, 771 \nF.2d 1556, 1567–68 (2d Cir. 1985) (citing United States v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 420 \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 6 of 24    PageID 5065\nU.S. 223, 236 n. 10 (1975) and Schurr v. Austin Galleries, 719 F.2d 571, 574 (2d Cir.1983)).  \nThey “must be construed to preserve the position for which the parties bargained.”  Grand \nTraverse Band of Ottawa & Chippewa Indians v. Dir., Michigan Dep’t of Nat. Res., 141 F.3d \n635, 641 (6th Cir. 1998) (internal citation omitted).  As with a contract, a court’s role in \ninterpreting the language of a consent decree is circumscribed; it cannot “expand or contract the \nagreement of the parties . . . , and the explicit language of the decree is given great weight.”  \nBerger, 771 F.2d at 1568 (citing Artvale, Inc. v. Rugby Fabrics Corp., 303 F.2d 283, 284 (2d \nCir.1962) (per curiam) and Vertex Distributing, Inc. v. Falcon Foam Plastics, Inc., 689 F.2d 885, \n892–93 (9th Cir.1982)); see also Reynolds v. Roberts, 202 F.3d 1303, 1312 (11th Cir. 2000) \n(“As a general matter, the rules we use to interpret a consent decree are the same ones we use to \ninterpret a contract—since a consent decree is a form of contract.”); Jerome Duvall, et al., \nPlaintiffs, v. Lawrence, Hogan, Jr., et al., Defendants. Additional Party Names: Michael R. \nResnick, Robert L. Green, No. CV ELH-94-2541, 2021 WL 2042295, at *12 (D. Md. May 21, \n2021) (“[C]onsent decrees are generally construed as contracts for purposes of enforcement.”).  \nThe words and language in a consent decree must be interpreted according to their plain meaning \nand normal usage.  Berger, 771 F.2d at 1568. \nAs previously stated, with these principles as a guide, the Court concluded that, contrary \nto Plaintiffs’ position, Defendant’s Motion to Terminate is properly before the Court, and \ncontrary to Defendants’ position, the Consent Decree is not “self-terminating.”  The Court also \npreviously determined that Defendants’ Motion to Terminate turns on a discrete question—\nwhether Defendants have complied with Paragraph 28 of the Consent Decree—and that Plaintiffs \nhad sufficiently demonstrated the need for a hearing on the evidence.  The Court reflected on the \npurpose that could be gleaned from Paragraph 28, and the Consent Decree overall, finding that, \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 7 of 24    PageID 5066\nper the Parties’ agreement, the Decree would terminate when the detainees were no longer in \ndanger, either because the pandemic was over or because an effective vaccination program had \nresulted in meaningful acceptance of the vaccine.  “Paragraph 28 does not state that once a \nvaccine is offered, the Consent Decree is terminated.  Rather, it states that a vaccine must be \noffered in tandem with effective communication and reinforcement of the benefits of the \nvaccine.”  (ECF No. 233 at PageID 3950.)4  Though the Court acknowledged that it was “not the \nfault of Defendants that there is vaccine hesitancy, a problem that is not unique to this population \nor this city,” it observed that “the requirements of Paragraph 28 implicitly reflect an \nunderstanding of this reality.”  (ECF No. 233 at PageID 3950.)   \nGiven the narrow operation of Paragraph 28(b), the Court limited discovery to Paragraph \n28(b)’s specific termination conditions—general availability of the vaccine, the provision of \n \n4 In their Post-Hearing brief in opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Terminate, (ECF No. 254 at \nPageID 4894), as to the purpose of the Decree, Plaintiffs also direct the Court to the Parties’ \nMotion for Preliminary Approval, (ECF No. 161), in which the Parties averred that the Decree \ncontained concrete steps that Defendants would undertake “to protect against the virus’ spread in \nthe Jail,” and also that the Decree would “help to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in Shelby \nCounty and Tennessee more broadly.”  (ECF No. 161 at PageID 3193.)   \n \nDefendants counter that the Court cannot look beyond the Consent Decree to discern the \n“purpose” of the Decree, which, by virtue of its existence as a document embodying opposing \npurposes of adversarial parties, “cannot [itself] be said to have a purpose[.]”  (ECF No. 255 at \nPageID 4903 (quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971).) \n \nThe Court does not disagree and reiterates that its discernment of the purpose of the Consent \nDecree is evaluated based on the Decree itself, not outside its four corners.  See, e.g., Lorain \nNAACP v. Lorain Bd. of Educ., 979 F.2d 1141, 1148 (6th Cir. 1992).  However, as the Sixth \nCircuit has stated, consent decrees have a “dual character,” such that while their terms are \nconstrued and evaluated under contract principles, “modification may be justified when a court is \n‘satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changing circumstances into an \ninstrument of wrong.’”  Id. (quoting United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114–15 (1932)).  \nWhether that is the case here is to be evaluated and determined in a subsequent order; as \nmentioned supra, the Court will turn next to Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce and to Modify Consent \nDecree.  (ECF No. 216.) \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 8 of 24    PageID 5067\neducational materials and non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine.  The Court now analyzes \nthe proof the Parties adduced at the hearing as to each of these conditions.  As a reminder, \nParagraph 28(b) provides that the Decree will terminate when (1) an FDA-approved COVID-19 \nvaccine is offered to and administered according to FDA guidelines to all detainees housed at the \nJail for a period of more than fourteen (14) days, and who accept a vaccination, (2) along with \neducational materials about the vaccine and (3) non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine.  \n(ECF No. 161-2 at ¶ 28.) \nI.  Availability of the Vaccine to All Detainees Housed for a Period of More than \nFourteen (14) Days \n \nThe first requirement of Paragraph 28(b) is a specific obligation.  The Jail must offer and, \nif accepted, administer the vaccine to all detainees who have been housed at the Jail for a period \nof more than fourteen (14) days.  At the time that they filed their Motion, June 2, 2021, \nDefendants asserted that it had complied with this requirement.  In their opposition, Plaintiffs did \nnot challenge this specific point, but instead more broadly asserted that the low acceptance rate, \nthen 11%, indicated that vaccine administration was a failure, thus violating the Decree.   \nHowever, at the hearing, Plaintiffs presented evidence that, around the time when \nDefendants prepared and filed their Motion to Terminate, they were not in compliance with this \nprovision.  Under questioning concerning Defendants’ answer to one of Plaintiffs’ interrogatories \nrequesting, inter alia, each date when vaccines were offered and how many were administered on \nthose dates, Chief Fields testified that no vaccines were administered between May 20, 2021, and \nJune 10, 2021, 21 days.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4581; see Ex. 21; ECF No. 244-8 at PageID \n4201-02.)  He further testified that the Jail ordinarily administered the vaccine every seven (7) \ndays to everyone who accepted the offer to get the vaccine, and that the reason for the three-\nweek gap in time was “[b]ecause of the lack of sign-ups from the detainees to receive the \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 9 of 24    PageID 5068\nvaccine.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4581-82.)  When asked if the minimum number of sign-ups \nwas six (6), he replied that he believed “that [was] correct.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4582.)   \nWhen asked again about the three-week gap in vaccine administration, Chief Fields testified that \nhe did not know the reason “offhand but I spoke with our health service administrator, and he \ninformed me that that lapse in time was because we did not have enough sign-ups.”  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4596-97.) \nPlaintiffs later presented evidence that disputed Chief Fields’ testimony as to the \nminimum number of sign-ups required to administer the vaccine.  Independent Inspector Mike \nBrady testified that he was told that the minimum number of sign-ups was 26, not six (6).  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4631-32.)  Mr. Brady also testified on cross-examination that he was not \naware of less than 26 vaccines being administered to detainees on separate instances.  (ECF No. \n251 at PageID 4705.)5   \nIn their Post-Hearing Response, Defendants do not attempt to clarify the 3-week period \nduring which no vaccine was administered.  Rather, they simply assert that “every detainee \nhoused at the Jail for longer than fourteen days that has requested a COVID-19 vaccine has been \n \n5 The Court notes that, while the Parties dispute the minimum number of detainees required to \nschedule the administration of the vaccine, Defendants’ response to Interrogatory No. 9, \nintroduced as Exhibit 21 at the hearing and located at ECF No. 244-8, appears to indicate that \nfewer than 26 detainees received the vaccine (either the Johnson & Johnson vaccine or a first \ndose of the Pfizer vaccine) on April 22, 2021 (18 detainees), April 29, 2021 (21 detainees), \nJuly 1, 2021 (14 J&J administered), and July 8, 2021 (10 J&J administered).  (Exhibit 21; ECF \nNo. 244-8 at PageID 4202–03.)  However, there is no way to determine, and the Parties do not \nelucidate, whether at least 26 detainees had signed up to receive the vaccine on those dates, but \nfewer than 26 actually received it because detainees had changed their minds, were released from \ndetention at the Jail, etc.  Thus, this fact remains disputed.   \n \nWhile specifics such as the request threshold that must be met to administer the vaccine are not \noutlined as requirements by the Consent Decree, what is required is that a vaccine be offered and \nadministered to all detainees who are housed at the Jail for a period of more than 14 days and \nwho want the shot.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 10 of 24    PageID 5069\nprovided a COVID-19 vaccine[.]”  (ECF No. 255 at PageID 4905.)  However, the Court notes \nthat Chief Fields’ testimony that there were not enough sign-ups during that time is at least \nsuggestive that there could be detainees who had been at the Jail for more than 14 days, \nrequested the vaccine during that time period, but may have been released before they received \nit.   \nWhen considering the meaning of this three-week gap, one can go further to see what \nother possibilities exist, that Defendants, who have provided no evidentiary support of their \ncompliance, have not foreclosed.  For instance, if a detainee qualified for, and requested, a \nvaccine on July 9, the day after a vaccine administration that occurred on July 8, 2021, was then \nreleased sometime before July 22, 2021, the next vaccine administration, he would have been \ndetained for a period of over 14 days but not have received the vaccine.  (Ex. 21; ECF No. 244-8 \nat PageID 4202.)   \nDefendants’ failure to track who has requested and received the vaccination, and present \nevidence of their compliance with Paragraph 28(b)’s vaccine administration requirement leaves \nthe Court with little to go on.  Without this information, it is, in fact, not altogether clear how \nDefendants can demonstrate their compliance with Paragraph 28(b), beyond their assertions.  \nThe Court is left with a meaningful dispute about whether Defendants have complied with the \nrequirement to offer and administer the vaccine to every detainee housed at the Jail for a period \nof more than 14 days since the effective date of the Decree.6  Thus, as to this element of \n \n6 The Court notes that Paragraph 28(b) does not specify when a vaccine must be administered to \na detainee who has been housed at the Jail for more than 14 days.  However, the length of time a \ndetainee who has requested a vaccine must wait to receive that vaccine, and what role longer \nwait times play in subsequent attrition, is a meaningful issue that gets at the intent behind this \nprovision.  Did the Parties intend for detainees to wait weeks after requesting a vaccine?  Do \nlong wait times protect Plaintiffs?   \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 11 of 24    PageID 5070\nParagraph 28(b), the Court cannot find that Defendants have met their burden to terminate the \nConsent Decree.   \nBut even if the Court found this to be a closer call, meaningful disputes exist as to \nParagraph 28(b)’s other requirements, as discussed in the next two sections. \nII.  Provision of Educational Materials \nThe educational materials condition of the termination provision is a significant point of \ncontention between the Parties.  Defendants have been vociferous in their assertions that \n \nIn his Inspection Reports, including his most recent report from his visit on August 5, 2021, Mr. \nBrady has raised this very issue.  He has asserted on multiple occasions that the Jail’s failure to \nstore vaccines onsite, and the attendant wait-times associated with the Jail’s dependence on the \nMemphis Fire Department to administer the vaccines, renders the program ineffective.  (See ECF \nNo. 257-1 at PageID 5005.)  Plaintiffs’ Expert Witness Dr. Stefano Bertozzi echoed this concern \nat the hearing, testifying that delays in time to vaccination are delays in protection for that \nindividual, and “of course, provides an opportunity for misinformation to come in and for that \nperson to change their mind.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4621.)   \n \nTurning back to Mr. Brady’s Inspection Reports, he questions why the Jail does not store the \nvaccines on-site, which would enable Wellpath healthcare professionals to administer vaccines \nessentially upon request.  Mr. Brady notes that storage of the Moderna and J&J vaccines would \npose no technical challenges to Wellpath, as they do not require advanced refrigeration \ncapabilities.  (ECF No. 257-1 at PageID 5004–05.)   \n \nIn his most recent report, Mr. Brady also expresses concern that, given the spread of the Delta \nvariant, the Memphis Fire Department may be less available to regularly appear at the Jail to \nadminister the vaccine on a weekly basis.  (Id. at PageID 5005.)  As Mr. Brady notes, the EMTs \nhave already had to cancel vaccine administrations on two different occasions because of staffing \nshortages.  (Id. at PageID 5028 (“Clearly the provision of vaccines to the Shelby County Jail \ninmate population is a very low priority for the City of Memphis.”).)  Recent developments are \neven more concerning to him.  Mr. Brady cites an article in the Daily Memphian, published \nAugust 15, 2021, in which the Deputy Chief of the Memphis Fire Department Emergency \nMedical Services explains that the number of daily calls recently reached the highest she has \never seen, and the extreme strain on the Department has reached a level that “is not sustainable.”  \n(Id.)  Mr. Brady cautions that this “does not bode well” for the Memphis Fire Department’s \nability to continue assisting with vaccine administration at the Jail.  (Id.) \n \nAs to whether Mr. Brady’s recommendation is a reasonable one, Dr. Bertozzi testified that \n“[e]very California prison” offers on-site vaccine administration.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID \n4622.) \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 12 of 24    PageID 5071\neducational materials have been provided, including written materials recommended by Mr. \nBrady and Plaintiffs, that information has been distributed in a myriad of ways—loose paper \nprintouts, hanging printouts, regularly played educational/promotional videos, and opportunities \nfor in-person conversation, including in town halls and with medical support staff who hand out \ndetainee medications.  Plaintiffs continue to challenge the efficacy of the educational materials \noffered as well as their actual availability/distribution.   Plaintiffs also point to the vaccination \nrate, approximately 25%, which they assert signifies that the educational program is \nunquestionably failing. \nDefendants’ overarching position is that the Consent Decree does not require educational \nmaterials of a certain efficacy (pointing to the absence of the word “effective” in Paragraph \n28(b)), and that they have gone above and beyond to provide all manner of materials to reach and \neducate detainees on the importance of receiving the vaccine.  Plaintiffs challenge that a “bare \nminimum” offering does not comply with Defendants’ obligations under the Consent Decree, \nwhich carries an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Tennessee law and \ngeneral contract principles.  (ECF No. 254 at PageID 4893 (citing Goot v. Metro Gov’t of \nNashville & Davidson Cnty., 2005 WL 3031638, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2005).)   \nDefendants’ position cracks under closer inspection.  Implied in their position is that \nthere is, in fact, some minimum standard of efficacy, and that the materials they have provided \nand/or created meet that standard.  Otherwise, Defendants could hang printouts with meaningless \nsymbols, labeled “educational materials.”7  They could host town halls where no information \n \n7 There is dispute about where the printouts are posted, as addressed infra. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 13 of 24    PageID 5072\nwas given about the vaccine, where meaningless answers were given to detainee questions.8  \nThey could show videos in another language that the detainees do not speak.9  Of course, \nDefendants have not done this and have not argued that they could.  This would be absurd and \ncontrary to well-settled principles of contract interpretation.  See, e.g. Dick Broad. Co. of \nTennessee v. Oak Ridge FM, Inc., 395 S.W.3d 653, 659 (Tenn. 2013) (“A cardinal rule of \ncontractual interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties.”) (internal \ncitation omitted).  But consideration of what the complete lack of a concept of “effectiveness” \nlooks like drives home the point that there is such a concept in the Consent Decree.  Recognizing \nthis concept, though, only leads to other questions. \nFirst, what constitutes “educational material”?  Is it determined by who provided the \nmaterial (i.e., Plaintiffs, in some instances)?  How is the educational value or efficacy of the \nmaterial to be measured?  On this latter question, Plaintiffs argue that the vaccination rate is one \nappropriate measure.  Plaintiffs’ Expert, Dr. Stefano Bertozzi, testified that the estimated vaccine \nrate at the Jail, around 25%, is “shockingly low,” as he is “accustomed to seeing acceptance rates \n \n8 Plaintiffs do challenge certain facts about the town halls that have occurred at the Jail.  Chief \nFields testified that it was “possible” that not all housing pods have had town halls where \nvaccines were discussed.   (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4582–83.)  Indeed, one of Plaintiffs’ three \ndetainee-witnesses testified that he had not attended a town hall where COVID-19 was \ndiscussed.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4723).  On the second day of the hearing, Defendants’ \ncounsel conceded that “every housing unit has not had a town hall on COVID at this point.”  \n(ECF No. 252 at PageID 4807.) \n \nThe exact purpose of the town halls was also called into question.  Mr. Brady testified that it had \nbeen represented to him that the Jail would conduct town halls exclusively on the subject of \nCOVID-19.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4655.)  According to Mr. Brady, the fact that the town \nhalls address topics other than COVID-19 and the vaccine diminishes the transmission and \nefficacy of any education information in that setting, as there is a risk of losing the attention of \nattendees, or conversely, never getting their attention.  (Id.)   \n \n9 Though the language of the materials has not been called into question, the reading level has, as \naddressed infra. \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 14 of 24    PageID 5073\nthat are three times that,”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4623) and the low rate indicates that the \neducation program is “obviously not effective.”  Dr. Bertozzi continued \nWithout speaking to what has been done, the result is a lack of \neffectiveness.  And it's a lack of effectiveness in the face of many other \ninstitutions that have achieved much higher rates of vaccination, including \nin populations of Black prisoners. So I would say that it's sort of -- it's \nobviously evidence of lack of effectiveness. \n \n(ECF No. 251 at PageID 4625.) \nWhatever the role of the vaccination rate in determining the effectiveness of the \neducational materials, or how the materials might otherwise be measured, the Court need not \nresolve these questions.  Why?  Plaintiffs have offered evidence that Defendants have not \nprovided educational materials to every detainee housed at the Jail for more than 14 days.   \nBeginning first with the proof offered by Chief Fields at the hearing, Defendants \nintroduced the following exhibits: a Vaccination Acknowledgment Form, (Ex. 1; ECF No. 245-\n1), a notice titled “FREE COVID-19 VACCINE!!!” that states that a detainee can place a sick \ncall request to get the vaccine any time and that there will be no punitive action, (Ex. 2; ECF No. \n245-2), a one-pager with three reasons why a person should get vaccinated (Ex. 3; ECF No. 245-\n3); a 4-page English and Spanish language packet about the vaccine prepared by AMEND10 (Ex. \n5, ECF No. 245-5); a 12-page English and Spanish language packet about the vaccine, also from \nAMEND (Ex. 6, ECF No. 245-6), a 5-page article titled “Key Things to Know about COVID-19 \nVaccines,” (Ex. 7, ECF No. 245-7); a 2-page document from Wellpath of post vaccination \n \n10 AMEND is a nonprofit arm of the University of California, San Francisco.  Dr. Bertozzi \ntestified that it is “one of the highly thought of organizations that consists of doctors, medical \ndoctors and other professionals that develop guidance and assist with jails and prisons in the \nimplementation of their vaccine programs in response to Covid-19.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID \n4684.) \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 15 of 24    PageID 5074\ninformation (Ex. 8; ECF No. 245-8); another 2-page document detailing three key reasons to get \nvaccinated (Ex. 14, ECF No. 245-14); and a compilation of posters encouraging that viewers get \nthe vaccine (Ex. 20, ECF No. 245-16).  Defendants also introduced two videos, one with \nPresident Barack Obama, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O’Neal, discussing the vaccine and \nencouraging that viewers get it (“Obama video”), and the other a video called “Tuskegee Legacy \nStories” 11 (“Ad Council Video”).  (Exs. 10, 11.)  Telephone audio prompts in English and \nSpanish were also offered.  (Exs. 12, 13.)12 \nRegarding the various written materials, detainee-witness Brandon Hibbler testified that \nthere are no educational materials such as hanging posters in his housing pod.  (ECF No. 251 at \nPageID 4716.)  As for other materials, Mr. Hibbler testified that he had been given one piece of \n \n11 Chief Fields testified that this video concerns “the Tuskegee experiment,” which the Jail \nshows “to dispel any thoughts of any type of . . . conspiracy . . . in regards to the vaccine.”  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4554.)  The so-called Tuskegee Study was a study undertaken by the U.S. \nPublic Health Service and the Tuskegee Institute in 1932, which was designed to record the \nprogress of untreated syphilis.  It was revealed decades after the study began that over 300 Black \nmale subjects of the study were not told they had syphilis and were not treated for it, despite the \nintroduction of penicillin.  See generally, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, The \nTuskegee Timeline, https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm (last visited Aug. 30, 2021).  In \nMay 1997, President Clinton issued a formal apology in which he stated that the United States \nGovernment had done something that was “deeply, profoundly, morally wrong,” and \nacknowledged that the Government’s profound abandonment of the “most basic ethical precepts” \ncreated a legacy of mistrust in the African American community.  The White House, Office of \nthe Press Secretary, Apology For Study Done in Tuskegee, (May 16, 1997), \nhttps://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/textonly/New/Remarks/Fri/19970516-898.html.  The \nCourt wonders whether a video primarily focused on this morally-bankrupt experiment \naccomplishes its objective in this setting, but reaches no conclusion on that question. \n \n12 The audio prompts are more accurately described as announcements—they announce, in \nEnglish and Spanish, how a detainee can request a vaccination.  The prompts do not “educate” \ndetainees about the vaccine. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 16 of 24    PageID 5075\npaper in April or May of last year13 asking if he wanted to take the vaccine or not, which did not \ninclude any educational information about the vaccine, and he had not been given any other \nmaterials.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4717.)  The first time Mr. Hibbler saw any written materials \nabout the side effects of the vaccine was when Plaintiffs’ counsel had come to the Jail to see him.  \n(Id.)  The only materials at the guard station, according to him, are the notices concerning the \nlawsuit.  Mr. Brady echoes this.  In his most recent inspection, Mr. Brady likewise observed that \n“vaccine education materials [are not] readily accessible to inmates.”  (ECF No. 257-1 at PageID \n5019.)  He also “did not witness any new inmates getting Covid-19 education materials[.]”  (Id. \nat PageID 5036.)14 \nRegarding the Obama and Ad Council Videos, Chief Fields testified that they are shown \ntwice daily through the entire jail facility and that a detainee can hear the video in his cell.  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4554.)  However, Mr. Hibbler testified that the educational videos about the \nvaccine only play at 3:00 p.m., and that detainees are not always out of their cells at that time and \nare unable to see the television.  He further stated that neither video discusses any particular \nvaccine or possible side effects of the vaccine.   \nChief Fields also testified that in-person education opportunities such as town halls, a pep \nrally, and chances to speak with medical staff to ask questions, are available to detainees.  The \npep rally was made available to detainees from “program pods,” which Chief Fields explained \n \n13 It is not clear if Mr. Hibbler misspoke when he referred to April or May of last year, instead of \nthis year, as the Court is not aware of a vaccine being offered or available in April or May of \n2020.   \n \n14 In his most recent Report, Mr. Brady also states that he has offered to assist with developing \nculturally competent education materials and to donate his time to conduct small group vaccine \neducation sessions with inmates.  To date, his offers have been rejected.  (ECF No. 257-1 at \nPageID 5045.) \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 17 of 24    PageID 5076\nare throughout the facility and were chosen “[b]ecause of the peer influence.”  He testified that \nabout 300 detainees attended and that doctors were there to “answer questions that the inmates \nmay have had in regard to the vaccination.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4549, 4550.)   \nAs to other methods of transmitting educational information, Chief Fields testified that \ninformation about the vaccines are on the kiosks, played over the phone systems and in general \nannouncements over the PA system.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4538.)  Regarding the kiosks, \nChief Fields testified that information about the vaccine “automatically comes up,” when a \nperson logs in, and that “they have to acknowledge that they’ve read or they’ve seen that \nmaterial.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4545-46.)   \nPlaintiffs challenge the veracity, availability and/or efficacy of each of these.   \nTo begin, town halls have not been held in every housing pod, which Defendants \nconcede.  As for the pep rallies, Mr. Hibbler testified that he had not been to one and was \nunfamiliar with it.  (ECF No. 251 at 4723-24.)  As for opportunities to speak to medical staff, \nMr. Hibbler testified that when he asked a nurse about the vaccine, she responded “you’ve got to \nput in sick call to get it.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4732.)  More alarming, Mr. Hibbler testified \nthat other, non-medical, jail staff, have told detainees that the vaccine is “trying to kill us.”  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4722.)   \nMr. Hibbler’s testimony calls into question the availability and access to in-person \neducation.  Only 300 out of between roughly 1900-2000 detainees had the opportunity to attend \nthe pep rally where they were able to speak to medical professionals and ask questions; Mr. \nHibbler was not one of them and does not know any attendees.  Mr. Hibbler has not been able to \nattend a town hall where Defendants contend that information is delivered live and in-person \nabout the vaccine.  When asked if more incentives would convince him to get vaccinated, Mr. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 18 of 24    PageID 5077\nHibbler expressed a need to speak to a person, face-to-face: “I would like to have more \ninformation about the vaccine and the side effects because I’m scared because I have already had \nCOVID once down here.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4728.)   \nWith his testimony, Mr. Hibbler unknowingly echoed Dr. Bertozzi’s testimony regarding \nthe importance of providing opportunities for detainees to connect with people they can trust to \ndiscuss and learn about the vaccine: \n[T]he most important part is the ability to engage in dialogue with trusted \ninterlocutors about vaccination.  There’s a portion of the population that on the \nbasis of just seeing educational materials will accept vaccination.  But there are \nmany people for whom that is not sufficient and who need to have an opportunity \nto ask questions, to have their questions responded to and to believe that they’re \nreceiving information from a trusted source.  And so we found that providing \nthose opportunities can dramatically increase acceptance of vaccination. \n \n(ECF No. 251 at PageID 4620.)15 \nAs for the ability to view materials supposedly posted in the housing units and the \nrequirement to click through certain information on kiosks before one can use them, Mr. \nHibbler’s testimony disputes these points.  Mr. Hibbler explained that, owing to the pandemic \nand short staffing, detainees are not allowed out of their cells more than one hour per day.  It is \nduring this hour that they can take a shower, use the phone, watch tv, or use the kiosk, where \nDefendants assert that educational materials about the vaccine must be viewed and \n \n15 In Mr. Brady’s most recent Report, he states that approximately 25% of the population at the \nJail has severe mental illness (“SMI”), and that this population has had the opportunity to receive \ninformation on the vaccine in face-to-face settings with medical personnel.  In those interactions, \nmedical personnel have “explain[ed] what is being offered, address[ed] [the SMI detainees’] \nfears, and explain[ed] the benefits of getting a vaccination.”  (ECF No. 257-1 at PageID 5001.)  \nAccording to Mr. Brady, the vaccine education process for this population is ADA compliant and \nculturally competent.  While Mr. Brady does not include information about the vaccination rate \nof this group, as he presumably does not have this information, one wonders why the Jail has not \ndecided to offer these opportunities to all detainees.   \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 19 of 24    PageID 5078\nacknowledged before detainees can proceed to using the kiosk for other functions, such as \nplacing a sick call, checking commissary accounts, placing commissary orders, and reviewing \nthe inmate handbook.  However, Mr. Hibbler testified that, in his housing unit, they have not \nalways had that hour outside their cells, preventing detainees from seeing any materials or using \nthe kiosk.16  Moreover, Mr. Hibbler testified that he has not seen information “pop up” on the \nkiosk automatically, as asserted by Defendants; rather, in his experience, a kiosk-user has to \nsearch for materials on the vaccine.  Even then, Mr. Hibbler has been in pods where the kiosk \nwas not working.  He otherwise testified that he has never heard an audio message about the \nvaccine over the PA system.   \nThe other detainee-witnesses further eroded Defendants’ contention that the kiosk is a \nway to gain information.  Richard Wright testified that to ask a nurse or medical professional a \nquestion, you need to enter the question in the kiosk and wait for their response.  In his case, and \nthe case of multiple fellow detainees, they, alarmingly, have never been able to ascertain which \nvaccine they received.  He testified that he wanted to know if he had received the Pfizer vaccine \nand thus needed a second dose.  He entered his question for the medical staff into the kiosk but \nhas never received any response.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4742.)  Ronnie Woods, detained in a \ndifferent location from Mr. Wright, testified that there are two kiosks in his pod, one for \ncommissary and the other for sick call and counselor call.  Mr. Woods testified that the kiosk for \n \n16 On rebuttal, Defendants sought generally to challenge Mr. Hibbler’s credibility.  Specifically, \nChief Fields testified that Mr. Hibbler’s housing unit had been let out between 5 and 6 hours on \nThursday evening, the night before the first day of the hearing, which contradicted Mr. Hibbler’s \ntestimony that his housing unit had not always been able to get their hour of recreation time \nrecently.  Specifically, Mr. Hibbler was asked “[r]ecently, have you always gotten that one hour \nof rec time?”  Mr. Hibbler responded that they had not, “[b]ecause . . . they do not have enough \nstaff to let us out.”  (ECF No. 251 at 4716.)  The Court does not find that Chief Fields’ testimony \nsucceeds in undermining Mr. Hibbler’s credibility. \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 20 of 24    PageID 5079\nsick call and counselor call does not work and has not worked for a little over a year.  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4734.) 17  Given the technical issue, detainees have to write requests down on \na piece of paper, and Mr. Woods testified that it can take weeks to get a response.  He further \ntestified that sick calls, which cost $3.00, are not a good way to get immediate treatment, as, \nagain, assistance may be very delayed.  Instead, detainees need to get an officer’s attention to get \nimmediate help.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4735.)   \nMr. Wright also testified that the reason he decided to get the vaccine was because he \nspoke to his family and wanted to be able to start working when he left the Jail.  As he testified, \nno Jail-provided educational materials or incentives played a role in his decision.  (ECF No. 251 \nat PageID 4740.) \nWhat the Court can discern from the Parties’ evidence is that, while Defendants are \nmaking various attempts to educate the detainees about the vaccine, their efforts are not available \nto all detainees, and beyond this, are not effective.18  More generally, Mr. Brady testified that \nduring his most recent inspection, conditions have deteriorated to the point where detainees do \nnot want to discuss their vaccine hesitancy because their time out of cell has dropped so \n \n17 On rebuttal, Chief Fields testified that he went to Mr. Woods’ housing unit to inspect the \nkiosks.  He testified that, though one is under repair, there is another kiosk that is currently \nworking.  (ECF No. 252 at PageID 4766–67.)  Chief Fields did not testify that the working kiosk \ncan be used for sick call and counselor call, however; he only testified that “because one is \nworking, [Mr. Woods] has access to a kiosk[.]”  (Id. at PageID 4767.)  The Court does not find \nthat this testimony contradicts or undermines Mr. Woods’ testimony that he does not have access \nto a kiosk to place a sick call, which he believes must be done on the broken kiosk.  \n \n18 Defendants do not appear to be tracking who receives a particular educational offering, such as \nthe pep rally, for instance, to see if that opportunity for education correlates to a significant jump \nin vaccination rates. This begs the question how Defendants are evaluating their efforts.   \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 21 of 24    PageID 5080\ndramatically.19  Upon the Court’s own review, the AMEND materials, whether proposed by \nPlaintiffs or not, are lengthy, dense, and in small print.  The Court does not find it likely that \nsuch materials will be helpful to a population whose average reading level is at a 6th grade level.  \n(See ECF No. 257-1 at PageID 5000.)  The other materials have not been seen by all detainees, \nand events are not attended by all, as evidenced by Plaintiffs’ detainee-witness’ testimony.  The \nvideos do not answer questions about the vaccines or discuss side effects.  The material that \nsupposedly pops up on the kiosk does not do so on every kiosk, and not all kiosks are operable.  \nSimply put, Defendants have not adduced evidence that all detainees detained at the Jail for a \nperiod of more than 14 days are receiving educational materials that adequately educate them \nabout the vaccine.   \nIII.  Provision of Non-Punitive Incentives to Take the Vaccine \nDefendants are similarly emphatic that they have offered a coterie of incentives to \ndetainees to take the vaccine, including $20 in their commissary, fresh fruit, a certificate (styled \nas an award), entry into a City of Memphis sweepstakes to win a car, and, most recently, a pizza \nparty for the housing pod that has the highest number of vaccine recipients by a certain date.   \nDefendants contend, more or less, that beyond paying detainees to take the vaccine, there is not \nmuch more they can be expected to offer.  Plaintiffs contest the provision of the incentives, citing \ndetainee testimony that they have not received this or that incentive, or that they are unaware of \n \n19 During his most recent inspection, Mr. Brady’s escort Captain Harris confirmed that detainees \nare not getting out-of-cell time because of staff shortages, which Mr. Brady believes is at a \n“crisis level.”  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4642; (ECF No. 257-1 at PageID 5018 (“On August 5, \n2021, I observed at least half of the Housing Pods locked down because of staffing shortages and \nadditional Housing Pods locked down because of Covid-19 exposure.”).)  He explains that with \nno out-of-cell time, detainees do not have access to kiosks and educational materials and cannot \nput in sick calls.  Moreover, Mr. Brady observed that the detainees’ mood is “completely \nhostile,” to the point that they are not receptive to education about the vaccine.   (Id.)   \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 22 of 24    PageID 5081\ncertain incentives being offered consistently, or at all.  According to Plaintiffs, the inconsistent \nofferings defeat their purpose.  \nDefendants offered into evidence a notification about the vaccine being free that also \ndetails a number of incentives that will be offered, including, no punitive action, fresh fruit on \nthe day of or day after one’s vaccination, free access to follow-up medical care, (Ex. 4, ECF No. \n245-4); a 4-page document detailing the $20 commissary incentive, beginning with June 1-30, \ncontinued through July and August (Ex. 16, ECF No. 245-10); a certification of appreciation (Ex. \n17; ECF No. 245-15); a notice about a $100 vaccination drawing, stating that three names will be \ndrawn (Ex. 18; ECF No. 245-11); a notice repeating the $20 incentive as extended through \nAugust 31 and an announcement of a pizza party “for the housing unit with the highest \nvaccination rate” (Ex. 19; ECF No. 245-12) \nWhen asked how he heard about the $20 incentive, Mr. Hibbler stated that he first heard a \nmessage over the intercom system about a $20 incentive to take the vaccine on July 14, 2021.  \n(ECF No. 251 at PageID 4724-25.)  Otherwise, he testified that a few guards had mentioned it to \nhim, but he doubted the truthfulness of those comments, because the officers sometimes joke or \ntease the detainees.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4725.)  He did not testify to having seen any \nprinted notices about the incentive.  He also testified that he only just heard of a few detainees in \nhis pod receiving their $20, just prior to the August 6 hearing, and he knew of one detainee \nreceiving an orange.  (Id. at PageID 4725-26.)  Mr. Hibbler testified that he knew of two \ndetainees who were attempting to check whether they had received the $20 in their commissary \naccount, and that one had, but one had not.  He testified that this was confusing to him, since \nthey had both received the vaccine.  This testimony is consistent with testimony by Chief Fields \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 23 of 24    PageID 5082\nacknowledging that there have been delays in depositing the funds into detainee accounts.  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4594-96; ECF No. 252 at PageID 4810.)20 \nAs to the certificates of appreciation being awarded to vaccine recipients, Mr. Hibbler \ntestified that he is not aware of anyone receiving that award.  When asked if the news of a pizza \nparty being awarded to the pod with the highest number of vaccine recipients would motivate \nhim to get the vaccine, Mr. Hibbler replied, as addressed supra, that it would not, because he \nwanted “more information about the vaccine and the side effects because I’m scared[.]”  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4728.)   \nAs for post-vaccine care, Mr. Wright testified that he was never informed that he would \nreceive such care, and that despite experiencing side effects, he never received any care.  (ECF \nNo. 251 at PageID 4742-43.)  Mr. Wright also stated that he knew of other detainees who \nexperienced side effects post-vaccine, who also did not receive any medical treatment or any \nmedication.  (ECF No. 251 at PageID 4743.) \nHere, again, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have created disputes about whether incentives \nhave been offered to every detainee who has been housed at the Jail for more than 14 days.  In \nthe absence of clear records, the picture that emerges is one of a lack of consistency.  Simply put, \nParagraph 28(b) demands more for termination to be triggered. \n \n \n \n20 A question was raised as to whether Defendants produced all the records demonstrating that \npayments had gone to 600 or so detainees who have purportedly been vaccinated.  (ECF No. 251 \nat PageID 4594–96.)  The records that appear to have been provided covered approximately 215 \n$20 payments.  Regardless, the Court finds that Defendants have not adduced evidence that \nevery detainee who received the vaccine, and was still housed at the Jail, received $20 in \ncommissary funds.  Plaintiffs have sufficiently established that a dispute exists on this point. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 258   Filed 08/30/21   Page 24 of 24    PageID 5083\nCONCLUSION \n  The thrust of Defendants’ Motion, and their arguments to the Court on multiple \noccasions, is that they have checked the boxes of Paragraph 28(b) and have thus terminated the \nDecree.  This posture is concerning.  The Consent Decree concerns the safety of detained \npersons, whose guilt or innocence has not yet been determined, in the midst of a global \npandemic.  By design, prison detainees live in a congregate living setting with little control over \ntheir daily lives, including their personal safety.  As Defendants correctly point out, the control \nthat Plaintiffs and other detainees can exercise is electing to get vaccinated.  However, as \nDefendants have learned, this is anything but a straightforward decision.  The estimated \nvaccination rate at the Jail, in the midst of the virulent Delta variant, signals a population in deep \nperil.  The Consent Decree did not enshrine mere box-checking.  It enshrined meaningful \nprotection for Plaintiffs, a medically vulnerable group.   \nOn the evidence before the Court, Defendants have failed to satisfy their burden that the \nConsent Decree has been terminated.  Thus, their Motion to Terminate the Consent Decree is \nDENIED.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 30th day of August, 2021. \n  s/ Sheryl H. Lipman   \n  SHERYL H.

The fact that the Decree is to terminate only \nupon the implementation of an adequate vaccination program or “a declaration by the CDC and \nthe Tennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 pandemic is over and/or has ended” \nmakes clear the parties’ intent that the Decree should run until detainees at the Jail are afforded \nadequate protections from the virus. Id. at ¶ 28. Indeed, the Court confirmed this framing and intent \nin its April 12 Order Granting Final Approval of the Class Action Settlement, noting that at the \ncore of this litigation lies a desire to “protect as much as possible Plaintiffs’ safety while detained \nin the Shelby County Jail (‘the Jail’) during the current pandemic caused by COVID-19.” ECF \nNo. 209, at 1. \n  One day after the Court issued its order, Defendants issued a public press release claiming \nthis suit had been “dismissed” and indicating the Decree would terminate two days later, on \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 5 of 35    PageID 3529\n \nApril 15, once the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines were offered to people in the Jail. See SCSO \nPress Release, attached as Exhibit A. After Plaintiffs’ counsel inquired about the press release the \nnext day, Defendants confirmed by e-mail and in a subsequent meet and confer that they believed, \nand continue to believe, the Decree has concluded. See E-mail Correspondence Between Parties \nre: Busby v. Bonner, attached as Exhibit B.1  \nTo the contrary, Defendants have not satisfied the requirements of the Decree, and their \nposition that the Decree no longer applies—or may imminently cease to apply—threatens the \nhealth and safety of the many hundreds of people held in the Jail. As an initial matter, there is scant \nevidence that Defendants have made adequate efforts to offer and administer the vaccine, including \nby offering educational materials and non-punitive incentives. As a result, an extraordinarily low \nnumber of detainees in the Jail overall have received the vaccine. Court-appointed Independent \nInspector Michael Brady’s first report, issued on April 11, 2021, previewed that vaccination \nhesitancy would be a significant problem at the Jail, indicating a vaccine refusal rate thus far of \n75% in the Jail. See First Inspection Report of Michael Brady, attached as Exhibit C, at 28. During \na meet and confer on April 16, Defendants informed Plaintiffs that approximately 200 people, out \nof the approximately 1900 people confined in the Jail, received a vaccine on April 15, suggesting \nan even higher refusal rate approaching 90%. At a subsequent meet and confer on May 6, \nDefendants indicated the number was basically unchanged, with 229 detainees having taken their \nfirst dose.  \nIn other respects, too, Defendants have failed to comply with the Decree. In particular, \nDefendants  have  not  met  their  obligations  with  respect  to  adopting  or  responding  to  the \n                                                 \n1 The parties have conferred twice regarding Defendants’ position as to when the Decree will terminate. Defendants \nhave agreed only to treat the Decree as operative during the dispute resolution period between the parties on this \nquestion. See Ex. B at 15.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 6 of 35    PageID 3530\n \nrecommendations of the ventilation expert, as mandated by Paragraph 13 of the Decree, or the \nrecommendations of Mr. Brady, as mandated by Paragraph 10 of the Decree. \nMoreover, Defendants have severely curtailed counsel’s access to information from our \ndetained clients about vaccine administration: Defendants have eliminated Plaintiffs’ access to the \nhotline that had been put in place to permit Class Members to discuss the settlement and the Decree \nwith Plaintiffs’ counsel, which has left counsel with limited visibility into Defendants’ compliance \nwith the terms of the Decree.  \nPlaintiffs hereby move this Court to enforce the Decree by (1) ordering that Defendants \noffer adequate educational materials and non-punitive incentives to increase the vaccination rate \nin the Jail in order to comply with the Decree; (2) ordering Defendants to make best efforts to \nadopt the recommendations of the Independent Inspector in his April 11, 2021 report and in his \nforthcoming reports; (3) ordering Defendants to make best efforts to adopt the recommendations \nof the Ventilation Expert; (4) ordering Defendants to reinstate the toll-free number that permits \nClass Members to speak with their counsel regarding Defendants’ compliance with the Consent \nDecree; (4) making a finding that the Decree has not terminated because Defendants have not \nimplemented an adequate vaccination program and Class Members presently remain unsafe in the \nJail; and (5) clarifying that the language “offered and administered” in termination provision (b) \nof Paragraph 28 of the Decree means that vaccinations must be fully administered in accordance \nwith Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) guidelines for the given vaccine, including guidelines \nfor the number of doses, schedule of administration of doses, and aftercare; and that robust vaccine \neducation efforts should be implemented in all housing units of the Jail, offers of vaccination \nshould be made regularly and as frequently as possible to all people in the Jail, vaccines should be \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 7 of 35    PageID 3531\n \nmade available within two days after a request, and non-punitive incentives for vaccination should \nbe offered. \nFurther, in light of Defendants’ apparent maneuvering toward a premature termination of \nthe Decree, and to ensure the parties’ intent to protect Class and Subclass Members is effectuated, \nPlaintiffs hereby move the Court to exercise its broad equitable powers to modify the portion of \nthe Decree that contemplates termination pursuant to a COVID-19 vaccine program to add a clause \nensuring protections for the Class and Subclass Members as detailed below: \nThis Decree will terminate upon the earliest of either (a) a declaration by the CDC \nand the Tennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 pandemic is over \nand/or has ended, or (b) an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine is offered to and \nfully administered according to FDA and CDC guidelines to all detainees housed \nat the Jail for a period of more than fourteen (14) days and who accept a vaccination, \nalong with educational materials about the vaccine and non-punitive incentives to \ntake the vaccine, so long as the vaccine program is demonstrated by a showing \nto the Court to result in lasting abatement of the threat COVID-19 poses to \nClass  and  Subclass  members.  While  the  parties  may  agree  that  “lasting \nabatement” has been achieved at any point, the Decree will terminate pursuant \nto section (b) of this Paragraph upon a showing to the Court followed by the \nCourt’s  approval  that  for  a  consecutive  three-month  period  80%  of  the \ndetainee population in the Jail has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, \nor upon a finding by the Independent Inspector that vaccination levels and \nother COVID-19-related health and safety measures have accomplished the \ngoal of keeping Class and Subclass members sufficiently safe. \n \nPROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY \nI.  The Litigation \nOn June 10, 2020, the Court certified a Class and Subclass of medically vulnerable and \ndisabled individuals detained pre-trial at the Jail who were at increased risk of serious injury or \ndeath from COVID-19, based on guidance from the CDC. ECF No. 38. On August 7, 2020, the \nCourt denied Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for habeas relief, but registered significant concerns \nabout whether medically vulnerable and disabled detainees were in fact safe from COVID-19 in \nthe facility. ECF No. 124. In its opinion, the Court outlined multiple “grave areas of concern” and \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 8 of 35    PageID 3532\n \nexpressed “doubts . . . as to whether the conditions at the Jail are legally sufficient.” In particular, \nthe Court wrote that “[c]oncerns persist as to the lack of testing, social distancing, and isolation \nand quarantine measures at the Jail, not to mention the persistent failure to consider detainees’ \nmedical conditions when making bond decisions.” Id. at 20–21.  \nII.  The Settlement \nFollowing the Court’s August 7 Order and with substantial discovery requests pending, the \nparties engaged in mediation and reached a resolution of the case on December 22, 2020, and \nshortly thereafter informed the Court. ECF No. 160. Eleven days prior, on December 11, 2020, the \nFDA issued the first emergency authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer-\nBioNTech.2  \nOn January 28, 2021, the Court preliminarily approved the parties’ settlement and proposed \nConsent Decree. ECF No. 162. In so doing, the Court emphasized that the Decree “imposes \nmultiple protective measures for Plaintiffs moving forward, which were the focus of this litigation \nfrom the beginning,” id. at 5, and that the Decree resolved “pressing concerns regarding the \nadequacy of safety measures at the Jail,” in the face of the “unprecedented crisis in need of urgent \nresolution” COVID-19 presents, id. at 7. \nAt the start of the notice period, Defendants set up a toll-free number that allowed people \nin the Jail to call Plaintiffs’ counsel to discuss the settlement. At the first-scheduled fairness \nhearing, the Court identified deficiencies in the notice, because information was posted in a portion \nof housing areas in the Jail that was difficult for detainees to access. ECF No. 176. During the \namended notice period, each pre-trial detainee housed in the Jail was handed a One-Page Notice, \n                                                 \n2  U.S.  Food  &  Drug  Administration,  Pfizer-BioNTech  COVID-19  Vaccine,  https://www.fda.gov/emergency-\npreparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-\nvaccine#:~:text=On%20December%2011%2C%202020%2C%20the,years%20of%20age%20and%20older. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 9 of 35    PageID 3533\n \nwhich contained a short description of the Class, explained that a settlement had been reached, and \nexplained that people in the Jail were entitled to read other papers that would explain the agreement \nmore fully. See One-Page Notice, ECF No. 180-1. The notice also provided information on how \nto object to the settlement and provided the toll-free number to call Plaintiffs’ counsel “if you have \nany questions about the Agreement.” Id. The Jail also made packets available to people in the Jail \ncontaining the full Settlement Agreement and a Detailed Notice, which more fully summarized the \nAgreement. See Proposed Plan for Distributing Notice, ECF No. 180-2, at 1–2. The Detailed \nNotice Form stated that “If the Court enters the Consent Decree, but you feel the Jail is not \nfollowing the terms outlined below, you can call the lawyers for the Class” at the toll-free number. \nDetailed Notice Form, ECF No. 161-5, at 2.  \nIII.  Post-Settlement Conduct \nA.  Ventilation Expert \nPursuant to Paragraph 13 of the Decree, the parties conferred numerous times in January \nand February 2021 about the appointment of a ventilation expert. Plaintiffs provided Defendants \nwith multiple extensions of time to provide evidence that ventilation in the Jail was satisfactory \nunder even pre-pandemic standards, yet Defendants refused and relied entirely on manufacturer’s \nassertions from a scientifically suspect company selling ionizer devices. Pls.’ Notice Pursuant to \n¶ 13, attached as Exhibit D. On March 22, 2021, pursuant to the Decree, Plaintiffs asked mediator \nJohn Golwen to appoint a ventilation expert. On April 6, 2021, Mr. Golwen appointed Jeff Haltom \nas the ventilation expert. Letter from J. Golwen to Parties, attached as Exhibit E. The parties met \ncollectively with Mr. Haltom on April 9, 2021, to discuss his appointment to determine whether \nthe air quality and ventilation in the Jail are safe with respect to COVID-19. On May 3, Mr. Haltom \ninformed the parties that he believed the Jail would need to undergo certain testing in order for \nhim to be able to assess the adequacy of ventilation in the facility. Defendants have not responded \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 10 of 35    PageID\n3534\n \nto Mr. Haltom’s testing recommendation or conducted the testing, which—under Paragraph 13 of \nthe Decree—was due May 17, 2021. E-mail Correspondence Between Parties and Jeff Haltom re: \nBusby v. Bonner Status Update, attached as Exhibit F. Instead, Defendants assert that Mr. Haltom’s \nsuggested testing plan is not a “recommendation” within the meaning of Paragraph 13 of the \nDecree. Ex. B at 7.  \nB.  Mr. Brady’s First Inspection \nOn March 17, 2021, Independent Inspector Brady conducted an initial visit of the Jail \npursuant to the Decree. Mr. Brady issued his first report on April 12, 2021. Ex. C. Mr. Brady raised \na number of serious concerns with the safety of Class and Subclass Members in the Jail, including, \namong others: \n  The Jail “does not have the ability to properly social distance inmates in the higher security \nlevels” and should therefore reduce its population “by up to 50% in order to achieve social \ndistancing consistent with CDC guidelines in order to effectively prevent/mitigate serious \nillness or death in the inmate population. Time is of the essence given the high vaccine \nrefusal rate which is approximately 75%. . . . [A]t the time of my inspection only \n22 inmates had been vaccinated.” \n  “The  Shelby  County  Jail  and  Wellpath  should  create  a  comprehensive,  culturally \ncompetent vaccine education program for current and future inmates that will demonstrate \nto the inmate population that the vaccines are safe and effective. Until the majority of \ninmates have been vaccinated at the Shelby County Jail, the prevention/mitigation effect \nis de minimis.” \n  “The Court Expeditor function is completely ineffective in presenting Class and Subclass \nmember healthcare information to the Court for them to consider [alternatives to detention \nin the Jail]. . . . [T]he manner in which data is collected, presented, and preserved is \ndysfunctional  and  unreliable.  Less  than  1%  of  the  Class  and  Subclass  healthcare \ninformation has been submitted to the Court for consideration. This is a serious problem \nthat places Class and Subclass members at an unreasonable risk of serious illness or death \nwhile in the Shelby County Jail.” \n  “Contract tracing occurs in silos in the Shelby County Jail, and there is a significant \nreliance on schedules and self-reporting of exposure . . . . As a result, there is a serious \nrisk  of  missing  individuals  who  have  been  exposed  to  the  Covid-19  virus,  and  an \ninadvertent introduction of the virus into the jail or the community.”  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 11 of 35    PageID\n3535\n \nId.  at  28–29.  Under  the  Decree,  Defendants  were  obligated  to  either  implement  the \nrecommendations made by Mr. Brady or explain in writing “why, despite their best efforts to do \nso, Defendants will not or cannot adopt” the recommendations by April 26, 2021. On that date, \nDefendants submitted their responses to Mr. Brady’s recommendations. Defs.’ Resps. to Mike \nBrady’s Recommendations From His March 3, 2021, Jail Inspection, attached as Exhibit G. In \nseveral  of  these  responses,  Defendants  did  not  meaningfully  engage  with  Mr.  Brady’s \nrecommendation, instead stating, for example, that they “disagree[d]” with a recommendation or \nthat they already “endeavor[]” to satisfy a recommendation—without explaining any specific \nefforts since the inspection or acknowledging that they are not succeeding at such endeavors. \n  Mr. Brady’s inspection report references data he was provided upon request during his \ninspection. Ex. C at 30. Plaintiffs’ counsel asked to receive the data referenced and any other \ndocumentation provided by the Jail Expeditor consistent with Paragraph 8 of the Decree. E-mail \nCorrespondence  Between  Parties  re:  Request  for  data  produced  to  Mr.  Brady,  attached  as \nExhibit H. Only once it became clear that Plaintiffs planned to file this motion imminently did \nDefendants furnish the documentation, in a last-ditch effort to keep this matter from reaching the \nCourt. Id. at 1. \nIV.  Final Approval of the Settlement and Defendants’ Claim That the Consent Decree \nHad Terminated \nThe Court entered final approval of the settlement and Decree on April 12, 2021. ECF \nNo. 209.  \nThe very next day, the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office issued a press release entitled \n“COVID-19 CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT DISMISSED.” Ex. A. The press release stated that \n“[t]he final action to be taken pursuant to the Consent Decree is to offer and administer the \nCOVID-19 vaccine to detainees. This will be accomplished on Thursday, April 15, with either the \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 12 of 35    PageID\n3536\n \nPfizer or Moderna vaccine to be administered to every detainee in the Jail who has requested it.” \nId.  \nOn April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs’ counsel e-mailed counsel for Defendants asking for more \ninformation on the representations in the press release. See Ex. B at 18–19. Plaintiffs also informed \ncounsel for Defendants that the hotline had received no calls since April 2 and asked them to \nconfirm the hotline was still available or to reinstate it if it was no longer operational. Id. Counsel \nfor Defendants informed counsel for Plaintiffs that they believed the Decree would terminate the \nfollowing day, April 15, pursuant to a single attempt to offer the first dose of a two-dose vaccine \nto people in the Jail. Id. at 17. Defendants also provided Plaintiffs’ counsel with the educational \nmaterials they planned to distribute in the Jail.3 Jail Vaccine Materials, attached as Exhibit I. \nOn April 16, the parties held a meet and confer, during which Defendants informed \nPlaintiffs that about 200 people in the Jail had been given one dose of a two-dose vaccination the \nprevious day. Plaintiffs asked what incentives were being offered to encourage vaccinations in the \nJail, and Defendants cited none. Plaintiffs indicated during that conversation that the educational \nmaterials  from  the  Jail—which  they  had  been  asking  to  review  for  some  time—appeared \ninadequate. See Ex. I. Defendants indicated they would consider using materials provided by \nPlaintiffs and requested that Plaintiffs write a letter to people in the Jail encouraging them to get \nvaccinated. Defendants also reiterated their view that once the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was \noffered on April 15, the Decree was terminated. Later on April 16, Plaintiffs asked if Defendants \nwould join in a motion to modify Paragraph 28 in light of the Jail’s low vaccination rate thus far. \n                                                 \n3 The parties conferred previously on April 7, 2021, during which time Plaintiffs’ counsel—in an effort to collaborate \nwith Defendants’ counsel to devise an effective vaccination plan—requested information about Defendants’ plans to \nprovide vaccinations at the Jail, including any educational efforts or incentives offered. Defendants did not respond to \nthis request until the day before vaccinations were to begin, affording Plaintiffs’ counsel no opportunity to weigh in \non the initial education and incentive plans, which were woefully deficient.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 13 of 35    PageID\n3537\n \nEx. B at 15–16. On April 19, Defendants rejected that request and invoked the dispute resolution \nprocess of the Decree, notwithstanding that they continued to hold the view that the Decree had \nterminated as of April 15. Ex. B 14–15.  \nA.  Defendants’ Account of the Vaccination Program \nOn April 23, Plaintiffs offered a host of suggestions to improve vaccination efforts at the \nJail, including, among other things, improved educational materials, town halls with outside \nmedical experts who were likely to be more trusted than Jail staff or contractors to answer \nquestions, and meaningful incentives for vaccination, such as increased recreational time or a \ncommissary bonus. Id. at 12–14. Plaintiffs also suggested the Jail make preemptive efforts to \naddress what can often be severe vaccine side effects, as opposed to waiting for detainees to make \nsick calls. Id. In addition, Plaintiffs proposed a schedule for updates on the Jail’s vaccination levels, \nso that the parties could continue to work together to refine the vaccination program and improve \nrates of vaccination. Id.  \nOn  April  26,  Defendants  delivered  to  Plaintiffs  their  responses  to  the  findings  and \nrecommendations  from  the  Independent  Inspector.  Ex.  G.  Their  responses  indicated  that \nDefendants were using some of the educational materials Plaintiffs had suggested. Id. at 3. The \nresponse also indicated the Jail would, as Plaintiffs suggested, hold town halls to discuss vaccines, \nbut did not adopt Plaintiffs’ request to include outside experts in those town hall meetings.4 Id. In \naddition, the response noted that, as an incentive to receive the vaccine, people in the Jail who \nagreed to do so would receive fresh fruit the day of or day after their vaccination. Id. at 4.  \n                                                 \n4 During a later conference, Defense counsel clarified that the town hall meetings had not yet commenced as of May \n6, 2021. Plaintiffs’ counsel asked if a member of their team could attend these town halls and Defendants denied that \nrequest.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 14 of 35    PageID\n3538\n \nOn  April  30,  Defendants  responded  to  Plaintiffs’  proposed  vaccination  program \nsuggestions, Ex. B at 11–12, which was followed by a meet and confer on May 6. In those \ndiscussions, Plaintiffs provided a draft letter to the Jail from Plaintiffs’ counsel encouraging \nvaccination. Defendants also stated that, as of April 29, a total of 229 people in the Jail had been \nvaccinated. \nB.  Our Clients’ Account of the Vaccination Program \nThe individuals living in the Jail tell a very different story. As detailed in the attached \ndeclarations: \n  Detainees received almost no information about the vaccinations at the time they \nwere  offered,  including  such  basic  questions  as  which  vaccine  was  being \nadministered  and  potential  side  effects,  risks,  and  benefits  of  the  vaccine. \nDeclaration of Mario Bowser, attached as Exhibit J, ¶ 6; Declaration of Favian \nBusby,  attached  as  Exhibit  K,  ¶  4;  Declaration  of  Calvin  Kelly,  attached  as \nExhibit L, ¶ 9. \n  They  have  had  no  opportunities  to  speak  with  or  ask  questions  of  medical \nprofessionals and have not even received fact sheets about vaccines. Busby Decl. \n¶ 6;  Declaration  of  Terrell  Minniweather,  attached  as  Exhibit  M,  ¶¶ 5,  9; \nDeclaration of Jeffery Rose, attached as Exhibit N, ¶¶ 9, 11; Bowser Decl. ¶ 15. \n  The only educational material they reliably report having received is a video \nfeaturing President Barack Obama, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O’Neal. For \nmultiple reasons, detainees do not find this video persuasive. Minniweather Decl. \n¶ 6; Kelly Decl. ¶ 7. \n  Some people in the Jail have observed information about vaccines posted on the \nwall, but note that it is posted behind the pod officer’s desk, which is difficult to \nsee because detainees are not allowed in that area. Bowser Decl. ¶ 7; Kelly Decl. \n¶ 8. In other words, vaccine information has been posted in the same areas as the \nclass notice information the Court previously found deficient. \n  People detained in the Jail have not personally been offered and have not witnessed \nothers being offered or receiving incentives to take the vaccine. Busby Decl. ¶ 7; \nRose Decl. ¶ 13; Minniweather Decl. ¶ 4; Bowser Decl. ¶¶ 5, 10; Kelly Decl. ¶ 3. \n  Detainees report no immediate follow-up care for those experiencing symptoms \npost-vaccination. Rather, they must put in a sick call to receive medication, which \ncan take days. Busby Decl. ¶ 7; Kelly Decl. ¶¶ 4, 11. \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 15 of 35    PageID\n3539\n \n  Our clients report a number of different concerns that have led them not to get \nvaccinated and note that these concerns are a frequent topic of conversation among \ndetainees and pod officers in the Jail. Rose Decl. ¶ 8; Minniweather Decl. ¶ 7; \nBowser Decl. ¶ 14. \nC.  The Toll-Free Hotline \nOn April 23, Plaintiffs followed up on their earlier request that Defendants reinstate the \ntoll-free number so that Plaintiffs’ counsel could communicate directly with Class Members, \nparticularly with respect to the administration of vaccinations. Ex. B at 13. Defendants have taken \nthe position that the toll-free number was only meant to operate during the notice period and have \nreiterated their view that the Decree terminated on April 15. Despite numerous requests and \nextensive discussion about the benefits of the hotline in facilitating contact with Class and Subclass \nMembers during the parties’ May 6 conference, Defendants have not reinstated the hotline and \nhave provided no reason for their refusal to do so. See Ex. B 3, 7. \nAs  a  result,  in  order  to  gather  information  from  detainees  about  administration  of \nvaccinations and other conditions in the Jail, Plaintiffs’ counsel must travel (sometimes significant \ndistances) to the Jail and visit with individual clients. \nV.  Evolving Knowledge of COVID-19 Vaccines and the Jail Setting \nWhen the parties negotiated the termination provisions of the Decree, which was finalized \non  December  22,  2020,  they  believed  that  Paragraph  28  as  written  would  ensure  that  the \nprotections of the Decree would run until detainees in the Jail no longer faced a threat due to \nCOVID-19. The public health understanding of the COVID-19 vaccines has evolved since then, \nincluding with respect to the jail setting, underscoring the importance of robust efforts to encourage \nvaccination by detainees and jail staff, widespread and easy availability, and trusted messengers.5  \n                                                 \n5 Further, as discussed below, Plaintiffs would not have agreed to the present language in Paragraph 28 if they had \nknown Defendants would interpret it so opportunistically as to attempt to terminate the Decree upon provision of the \nvaccine to less than 11% of the Jail.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 16 of 35    PageID\n3540\n \nOn December 31, 2020, the World Health Organization issued guidance indicating that the \npercentage of the population required to have immunity from COVID-19 to end the pandemic was \nnot yet known, but that eradication of the threat posed by other diseases has required immunity \nlevels of 80% (as with polio) to 95% (as with measles). World Health Org., Coronavirus Disease \n(COVID-19):  Herd  Immunity,  Lockdowns  and  COVID-19  (Dec.  31,  2020), \nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19.  \nOn February 16, 2021, the CDC issued guidance on “Frequently Asked Questions” \nregarding COVID-19 vaccines and correctional and detention centers. CDC, COVID-19 Vaccine \nFAQs  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Centers  (Feb.  16,  2021), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/vaccine-faqs.html. \nAmong other things, the CDC stressed that it continues to “strongly recommend” that correctional \nfacilities “continue using all the tools available to help stop transmission” even after the vaccine \nhas been administered. Id. On March 6, 2021, a group of doctors published a study in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine stressing that “several factors suggest that vaccination alone will not \nbe enough to stop carceral outbreaks” of COVID-19. Benjamin A. Barsky, et al., Vaccination plus \nDecarceration – Stopping COVID-19 in Jails and Prisons, New England Journal of Medicine \n(Mar. 6, 2021), https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2100609. The article goes on to \nexplain that, in large urban U.S. jails—the setting with the highest reproduction rate of COVID-\n19 anywhere in the world—the “effectiveness of vaccines is considerably diminished”: \nIn this setting, even a vaccine with 90% efficacy will leave many people at ongoing \nrisk for Covid-19, given the extraordinarily high rate of transmission in jails and \nprisons attributable to rampant overcrowding, inadequate testing and health care, \nhigh-volume daily inflow and outflow of staff and detainees, lack of personal \nprotective  equipment,  and  normalized  systematic  neglect  of  the  welfare  of \nincarcerated people.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 17 of 35    PageID\n3541\n \nId.  In  summary,  “Reliance  on  vaccination  alone  thus  seems  unlikely  to  achieve  necessary \nreductions in Covid-19 transmission in incarcerated populations.” Id. On April 2, 2021, the CDC \nissued a report on a study of the willingness of incarcerated and detained persons to accept a \nCOVID-19 vaccination. Marc Stern, Alexandra Piasecki, Lara Struck, et al., Willingness to \nReceive a COVID-19 Vaccination Among Incarcerated or Detained Persons in Correctional and \nDetention  Facilities—Four  States,  September-December  2020,  CDC  (Apr.  2,  2021), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013a3.htm. That study showed that the vaccine \nrefusal rate was 45%—30 percentage points lower than the vaccine refusal rate at the Jail reported \nby the Independent Inspector and approximately 45 percentage points lower than the refusal rate \nin the Jail on May 6. Id.; Ex. C at 28. The vaccine acceptance rate in the study was also 45%, with \nan additional 10% willing to consider using the vaccine—a rate 20–30 percentage points higher \nthan that reported by the Independent Inspector and 35–45 percentage points higher than the \nacceptance rate in the Jail as of April 15. See Stern et al., supra; Ex. C at 28. The most common \nreason for vaccine hesitation among incarcerated people was wanting to hear more information \nabout the vaccines. See Stern, et al., supra.  \nAn April 6, 2021 article from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health \nsuggests that “we would need at least 70% of the population to be immune to keep the rate of \ninfection down (‘achieve herd immunity’) without restrictions on activities.” Johns Hopkins \nSchool of Public Health, What is Herd Immunity and How Can We Achieve it With COVID-19? \n(Apr.  5,  2021),  https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-\ncovid19.html. However, this study did not contemplate the vaccination rate necessary to achieve \n“herd immunity” in a carceral setting, which may well be higher, as highlighted in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine piece. Thus, at present, the vaccination rate needed to achieve “herd \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 18 of 35    PageID\n3542\n \nimmunity,” or, at a minimum, a rate of vaccination necessary to ensure the abatement of the threat \nof COVID-19 in the jail setting, is still unknown and subject to continuing scientific study. \nWhatever the precise necessary vaccination rate may be, it is plain that the rate in the Jail is \nnowhere close to it. Even for a carceral setting, the vaccine acceptance rate in the Jail is incredibly \nlow. See, e.g., Elizabeth T. Chin, et al., New England Journal of Medicine, Correspondence (May \n12, 2021), https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2105282?query=featured_home (noting \na 66.5% acceptance rate in California prisons); Becky Sullivan, All Federal Inmates to be Offered \nVaccine  By  Mid-May,  BOP  Says,  NPR  (April  16,  2021), \nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/988237102/all-federal-inmates-to-be-offered-vaccine-by-mid-\nmay-bop-director-says (66% of federal prisoners offered vaccines accepted at least one dose).  \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants Have Failed to Meet the Requirements for Terminating the Consent \nDecree and Have Undermined the Consent Decree’s Operation \nThe Decree provides two avenues for termination:  \n(a) a declaration by the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 \npandemic is over and/or has ended, or (b) an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine is offered \nto and administered according to FDA guidelines to all detainees housed at the Jail for a \nperiod  of  more  than  fourteen  (14)  days  and  who  accept  a  vaccination,  along  with \neducational materials about the vaccine and non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine. \n \nApproved Consent Decree, ECF No. 161-2, at ¶ 28. The Decree further requires that “Upon \ntermination of this Decree pursuant to this Paragraph, the parties shall inform the Court and the \nCourt shall enter a final judgment of dismissal.” Id.  \n  “[S]ince consent decrees and orders have many of the attributes of ordinary contracts, they \nshould be construed basically as contracts.” Brown v. Neeb, 644 F.2d 551, 557 (6th Cir. 1981) \n(citing United States v. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U. S., Inc., 643 F.2d 644, 648 (9th Cir. 1981)). \n“The  terms  of  a  consent  decree,  unlike  those  of  a  simple  contract,  however,  have  unique \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 19 of 35    PageID\n3543\n \nproperties. . . . The binding substantive commands of a consent decree are embodied within \ndecree’s ‘four corners.’” However, “[i]f the language of the decree is ambiguous . . . the court’s \ninterpretation of its substantive commands may depart from the ‘four corners.’” Id. (citations \nomitted). “[A] consent decree should be construed to preserve the position for which the parties \nbargained.” Vanguards of Cleveland v. City of Cleveland, 23 F.3d 1013 (6th Cir. 1994) (citing \nVogel v. City of Cincinnati, 959 F.2d 594, 598 (6th Cir. 1992)). \nA.  Defendants Have Violated the Decree in Their Implementation of the \nVaccination Program at the Jail \nDespite the undeniable ineffectiveness of the Jail’s administration of vaccines to detainees, \nDefendants inexplicably claimed that they satisfied their obligations under the Decree by providing \na vaccine to a small fraction of the Jail’s population. \nIn order to reach this conclusion, Defendants espouse an untenable interpretation of their \nobligations under the Decree. First, the plain language “offered to,” along with the expressed joint \nintent of the parties to achieve high rates of vaccine acceptance, means more than a single, \ngeneralized offer to a shifting population. And the Decree also requires that when Defendants offer \nthe vaccine, the offer be accompanied by “non-punitive incentives to take the vaccine.” Decree at \n¶ 28. During the April 16 meet and confer, Plaintiffs’ counsel asked what incentives were being \noffered; Defendants listed none. After Plaintiffs alerted Defendants to the Decree’s requirement of \nincentives, Defendants stated that they began offering fresh fruit to people in the Jail on the day of \nor day after a vaccination. See Ex. G at 3–4. Defendants have not implemented the more substantial \nincentives suggested by Plaintiffs, such as increased recreational time, commissary funds, or at \nminimum providing detainees with a small supply of Tylenol prophylactically after vaccination to \naid with common symptoms such as aches and fever.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 20 of 35    PageID\n3544\n \nSecond, Paragraph 28 contemplates termination only after Defendants provide educational \nmaterials about the COVID-19 vaccines. It is self-evident that educational materials must be \nappropriate to the audience and provide thorough and accurate information. Despite Plaintiffs’ \nrequests to collaborate with Defendants on the educational materials to be provided in the Jail, \nDefendants’ initial educational materials were woefully inadequate, offering no information about \nthe contents, efficacy, or side effects of the vaccines. See Ex. I. After Plaintiffs urged Defendants \nto consider new materials, the Jail agreed to provide educational materials suggested by Plaintiffs. \nHowever, during the April 16 and May 6 meet and confers, Defendants could not definitively state \nwhether materials had been handed out to individual detainees, and Class Members have reported \nthat detainees are not receiving the materials.6 Plaintiffs also urged Defendants to hold town halls \nwith outside medical personnel. Defendants have indicated they plan to hold town halls, see id., \nbut they will be with Wellpath medical personnel. Defendants have not revealed when the town \nhalls will take place, and they denied Plaintiffs’ counsel’s request to participate in such meetings. \nThe explicit requirements for incentives and educational materials in the Decree make clear \nthe parties’ underlying assumption for any termination of the Decree through vaccination: that the \nvaccination effort result in widespread immunity. Unfortunately, in the absence of adequate \neducation and incentive efforts, people in the Jail have proved hesitant to take the vaccine. The \nIndependent Inspector previewed this problem in his April 11 report, which reported a 75% refusal \nrate among detainees. Ex. C at 28. In fact, the problem is even worse, as Defendants’ counsel \nexplained at the April 16 meet and confer that when vaccines were offered on April 15, only \napproximately 200 detainees received a first dose, suggesting that less than 11% of detainees are \naccepting the vaccine. On May 6, after Defendants said they would offer a fresh fruit incentive \n                                                 \n6 As the Court will recall, a handout as compared to posting materials on walls near guard stations was the solution \nto deficient notice during the class settlement approval process earlier in this case. ECF No. 176. \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 21 of 35    PageID\n3545\n \nand explained plans for improved educational materials, vaccination levels remained essentially \nunchanged.  \nFurther, Defendants have undermined Plaintiffs’ ability to follow what is happening to \nClass Members inside the Jail by shutting off the toll-free number by which Class Members could \ncall their attorneys. The hotline was frequently used by Class Members when it was in operation. \nMultiple Class Members could dial it at once and have their calls sent to different lawyers, making \nit easier for Plaintiffs’ counsel to schedule and manage responsibilities across the team. As visiting \nthe Jail during the pandemic can be constrained and difficult, this window into Jail-wide practices \nwas extremely important for monitoring conditions in the Jail.  \nWhile Plaintiffs’ counsel are struggling to learn about their clients’ safety, Defendants are \nhastening to terminate the Decree as soon as possible. Under Defendants’ interpretation of the \nDecree, it is subject to termination as soon as one dose of any vaccine (including vaccines that \nrequire two doses for complete administration) is offered to detainees one time, even if no detainee \naccepts it.7 Such an interpretation of Defendants’ obligations would not protect Class Members \n                                                 \n7 Even under the narrow reading Defendants endorse, termination would still be inappropriate. Paragraph 28 requires \nthat vaccines be “offered to and administered according to FDA guidelines . . . [.]” Per the FDA, the Pfizer vaccine \nrequires two doses of vaccine three weeks apart. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers \nAdministering  Vaccine,  Emergency  Use  Authorization  of  the  Pfizer-Biontech  COVID-19  Vaccine  to  Prevent \nCoronavirus Disease 2019, https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download. The Moderna vaccine requires two doses \nof vaccine one month apart. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine, \nEmergency  Use  Authorization  of  the  Moderna  COVID-19  Vaccine  to  Prevent  Coronavirus  Disease  2019, \nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download. In addition, Paragraph 28 only permits termination if Defendants \nprovide an “FDA-approved” COVID-19 vaccine. Strictly speaking, no such vaccine exists: currently available \nCOVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization, not approval, from the FDA. U.S. Food & Drug \nAdmin.,  Emergency  Use  Authorization  for  Vaccines  Explained,  https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-\nbiologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained (distinguishing emergency use from approval); \nEliana Block, WUSA9, VERIFY: What’s the Difference Between Emergency Use Authorization and FDA approval?, \nhttps://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/emergency-use-authorization-fda-approval-vaccines-fact-check/65-\n7391e595-cee0-4a00-8468-194a6e0a21a4 (last updated Apr. 13, 2021) (noting that EUA generally requires about two \nmonths of clinical data, and approval six months).  \n \nDefendants have also not fulfilled their obligations under the Settlement Agreement, as they have not yet paid \nPlaintiffs’ counsel the agreed upon $84,790.31 as reimbursement for their costs incurred in connection with this case. \nSee Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 161-3, at 2–3.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 22 of 35    PageID\n3546\n \nand would thus severely undermine the purpose of the Decree. As a result, Plaintiffs ask the Court \nto enforce the Decree by ordering the relief sought in the accompanying motion. \nB.  Defendants Have Violated Multiple Other Provisions of the Decree \nThe inadequate vaccination program is not the only respect in which Defendants have \nflouted the Decree. \nThe Decree requires Defendants “to implement the recommendations of the Ventilation \nExpert; or, within fourteen (14) days of receiving the written advice of the Ventilation Expert, to \nexplain to the Ventilation Expert, Independent Inspector, and Plaintiffs’ counsel in writing why it \nwill not or cannot despite using its best efforts to do so.” ¶ 13. \nDespite diligent efforts by Plaintiffs’ counsel to ensure that Mr. Haltom is empowered to \nassess the ventilation and air quality in the Jail, Defendants have not—to Plaintiffs’ knowledge—\ntaken any steps to facilitate or permit the testing recommended by Mr. Haltom on May 3. Nor have \nthey issued a written explanation as to “why [they] will not or cannot despite using [their] best \nefforts to do so” within the allotted time. Instead, Defendants quibble with Plaintiffs’ counsel by \nconfusing the scope of Mr. Haltom’s charge and selectively reading Paragraph 13 of the Decree to \nassert that Mr. Haltom’s recommendation that the Jail undertake certain testing of the ventilation \nrates is no “recommendation” at all. Ex. B at 7. After several months of dialogue between the \nparties  regarding  the  ventilation  expert  and  multiple  extensions  afforded  to  Defendants, \nDefendants have given no indication that they intend to accept even the recommendations provided \nby the expert for testing the ventilation in the Jail—much less his findings and recommendations \nwith respect to the adequacy of the air quality. Defendants should be required to do so, as required \nby the Decree. \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 23 of 35    PageID\n3547\n \nLikewise, Defendants have given the back of the hand to Mr. Brady’s findings and \nrecommendations from his first inspection. For example, Mr. Brady’s first recommendation was \nthat the Jail population “needs to be reduced by up to 50% in order to achieve social distancing \nconsistent with CDC guidelines.” Ex. C at 28. Defendants responded by saying they “disagree” \nwith his recommendation and offering a perfunctory list of the Court Expeditor’s duties. Ex. G at \n2. Of course, under the Consent Decree, the Jail’s opinions about the Inspector’s recommendations \nare wholly irrelevant. Mr. Brady’s report also detailed why simple reliance on the Jail Expeditor \nis insufficient, as his second finding detailed that the Expeditor is “severely understaffed” and that, \nshockingly, “[l]ess than 1% of the Class and Subclass healthcare information has been submitted \nto the Court for consideration.” Ex. C at 28. In response to Mr. Brady’s recommendation that the \nJail add “at least two additional positions to the office of the Court Expeditor,” Defendants only \nsaid they would offer “staff support” for the Expeditor. Ex. G at 6. There was no explanation for \nwhat support that would be, if it would entail Mr. Brady’s recommendation of two additional staff \nmembers, or, if not, why adding those staff members was not possible despite Defendants’ best \nefforts.  \nDiscussions  with  Class  and  Subclass  Members  reveal  that  the  Jail’s  response  to \nMr. Brady’s recommendations has been even worse. For example, in response to Mr. Brady’s \nrecommendation that the Jail implement a mandatory overtime program to ensure sufficient \nstaffing for increased recreational time, the Jail wrote that it already had such a program and that \nthe Jail “endeavors to provide detainees recreational time via access to the rooftop yards and/or \ndayrooms on a daily basis.” Id. at 7. Based on reports from Class and Subclass Members, those \nendeavors have utterly failed, as multiple people in the jail do not receive recreational time each \nday or have been granted access to the roof only once in the past year. See Ex. K ¶¶ 8,9; Ex. M \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 24 of 35    PageID\n3548\n \n¶ 8; Ex. J ¶ 12; Ex. L ¶ 10. Tellingly, one person in the jail indicates that the only day in the past \nmonth that he was allowed outdoor recreation was the date of Mr. Brady’s inspection. Ex. K ¶ 9.  \nDefendants’ response to Mr. Brady also indicated the Jail would be employing town halls, \nimproved educational materials, and offering fresh fruit to educate and encourage people in the \nJail to get vaccinated. Ex. G at 3–4. But again members of the Class and Subclass tell a different \nstory. Several people in the Jail indicate they have seen no outreach but an unpersuasive video. \nSee Ex. M ¶ 6. They indicate no incentives for vaccination are being offered—not even the meager \nfresh fruit Defendants described in their response. Id. ¶ 4. People in the Jail either do not know \nabout any written educational materials, see id. ¶ 9; see also Ex. K ¶ 7, or the materials are kept in \nplaces where Class and Subclass Members cannot adequately review them, Ex. J ¶ 7.  \nThese are just the reports from people Plaintiffs’ counsel was able to reach in their most \nrecent visit to the Jail. A wider canvass of the Jail would no doubt reveal more shortcomings, but \nsuch communication with Class and Subclass Members has been impeded by Defendants’ decision \nto cut off access to the toll-free number detainees had previously used to reach class counsel. \nWithout that number, it is extremely difficult for Plaintiffs’ counsel to monitor Defendants’ \ncompliance with the Consent Decree, even while the limited information that is available gives \ncause for grave concern.  \nII.  The Court Should Modify the Termination Provision of the Consent Decree \nTo avoid future litigation on premature termination efforts, Plaintiffs also move the Court \nto modify the Decree to comport with the parties’ intent to provide adequate protection to detainees \nin the Jail. See ECF No. 209, at 1. Such a modification would be within the Court’s power, would \nbe appropriate in light of growing understanding regarding the difficulties in administering \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 25 of 35    PageID\n3549\n \nvaccines in the Jail, and would effectuate the parties’ intent to protect detainees in the Jail from \nCOVID-19 until those protections are no longer needed. \nA.  The Court Has Broad Equitable Power to Modify the Termination Provision \nof the Decree Under Rule 60(b)(5) \nUnder the Court’s traditional equitable power, it may modify an order granting injunctive \nrelief when changed circumstances warrant such relief. This is because a “court must find \nprospective relief that fits the remedy to the wrong or injury that has been established.” Salazar v. \nBuono, 559 U.S. 700, 718 (2010) (citing United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114 (1932) \n(“A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as \nevents may shape the need.”)). It is well-settled that “courts retain the inherent power to enforce \nagreements entered into in settlement of litigation pending before them.” Vanguards, 23 F.3d at \n1018 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Sarabia v. Toledo Police Patrolman’s Ass’n, 601 \nF.2d 914, 917 (6th Cir. 1979)). \nBecause prospective relief “is drafted in light of what the court believes will be the future \ncourse of events, . . . a court must never ignore significant changes in the law or circumstances \nunderlying an injunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument of wrong.’” Salazar, 559 \nU.S. at 714–15 (citing C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller & M. Kane, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2961 \n(2d ed. 1995) (quoting Swift & Co., 286 U.S. at 115)). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) \ncodifies the courts’ inherent authority to modify or vacate the prospective effect of their decrees. \nRule 60(b)(5) provides, “On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding . . . [when] . . . applying it prospectively \nis no longer equitable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). As the Supreme Court explained in Rufo v. \nInmates of Suffolk Cty. Jail, Rule 60(b)(5) applies to consent decrees because, while a “consent \ndecree no doubt embodies an agreement of the parties and thus in some respects is contractual in \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 26 of 35    PageID\n3550\n \nnature[,] . . . it is an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be \nenforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments \nand decrees.” Rufo, 502 U.S. 367, 378 (1992); see also Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437, 440 \n(2004) (“Consent decrees have elements of both contracts and judicial decrees” and may be \nmodified under Rule 60(b) if “it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective \napplication”) (citation omitted). Indeed, upon approval, the injunctive quality of consent decrees \n“compels” the presiding court to: “1) retain jurisdiction over the decree during the term of its \nexistence; 2) protect the integrity of the decree with its contempt powers; and 3) modify the decree \nshould ‘changed circumstances’ subvert its intended purpose.” Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d \n909, 920 (6th Cir. 1983) (internal citations omitted). \nApplying these principles to a case involving the conditions of pretrial detainees, the Rufo \nCourt explained that a “flexible approach” to modification is particularly appropriate to consent \ndecrees in institutional reform cases because such decrees “reach beyond the parties involved \ndirectly in the suit and impact on the public’s right to the sound and efficient operation of its \ninstitutions.” Rufo, 502 U.S. at 381 (citations omitted).  \nModification of the Decree is warranted based on the facts of this case. In Rufo, the \nSupreme Court laid out a two-part inquiry for determining whether modification of a consent \ndecree pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5) is appropriate:  \n[A] party seeking modification of a consent decree bears the burden of establishing \nthat a significant change in circumstances warrants revision of the decree. If the \nmoving party meets this standard, the court should consider whether the proposed \nmodification is suitably tailored to the changed circumstance. \n \n502 U.S. at 383. The moving party “may meet its initial burden by showing either a significant \nchange either in factual conditions or in law.” Id. at 384. Modifications may be warranted when \n“enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest.” Id. \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 27 of 35    PageID\n3551\n \nat  384–85  (citations  omitted).  There  is  no  requirement  to  demonstrate  that  such  changed \ncircumstances were “unforeseen or unforeseeable” at the time the parties agreed to the decree’s \nterms. Id. Importantly, modification of a consent decree may also be justified if it is necessary to \nachieve the overall goals of performance intended by the decree. Vanguards, 23 F.3d at 1020 \n(finding noncompliance with performance goal is a “significant change in circumstances which \nwarrants revision of the consent decree”).  \nThe Sixth Circuit empowers presiding courts to modify a consent decree upon mere \n“identif[ication of] a defect or deficiency in its original decree which impedes achieving its goal, \neither because experience has proven it less effective, disadvantageous, or because circumstances \nand conditions have changed which warrant fine-tuning the decree.” Heath v. De Courcy, 888 F.2d \n1105, 1110 (6th Cir. 1989). “A modification will be upheld if it furthers the original purpose of \nthe decree in a more efficient way, without upsetting the basic agreement between the parties.” Id. \nSpecifically, such a modification can even extend the time for termination of the decree, for \nreasons including that the group designed to be benefited by the decree has not participated at a \nhigh enough rate to meet the decree’s overall goals. Vanguards, 23 F.3d at 1020–21 (extending \ndecree  for  two  years  because  an  insufficient  number  of  minority  employees  were  seeking \npromotion to meet an overall promotion goal); see also Phila. Welfare Rights Org. v. Shapp, 602 \nF.2d  1114, 1120–1121  (3d  Cir.  1979)  (modification  acceptable  where  State  could  not  find \nsufficient clients to meet decree targets).  \nB.  Public Health Guidance, Changed Circumstances, and the Need for \nClarification Justify the Modification \nSince the original language of the Decree was negotiated in December 2020, much more \nis known about the inability of vaccine offers alone to abate the threat of COVID-19 in jails.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 28 of 35    PageID\n3552\n \nAs detailed in Part V, supra, considerable public health guidance issued since December \n2020 stresses the importance of ongoing protections in carceral settings notwithstanding the \navailability of vaccine doses. See, e.g., CDC, COVID-19 Vaccine FAQs in Correctional and \nDetention  Centers  (“strongly  recommend[ing]”  that  even  after  vaccines  are  administered, \n“correctional and detention facilities . . . continue using all the tools available to help stop \ntransmission . . .  even  people  who  have  received  the  COVID-19  vaccine.”)  (emphasis  in \noriginal); Barsky, et al. (“several factors suggest that vaccination alone will not be enough to stop \ncarceral outbreaks” of COVID-19” and accordingly “even a vaccine with 90% efficacy will leave \nmany [detained] people at ongoing risk for Covid-19, given the extraordinarily high rate of \ntransmission in jails and prisons[.]”).  \nThese concerns are exacerbated by the rise of new variants of the virus. The CDC lists five \nVariants of Concern (“VOCs”) that have been detected in the United States. CDC, About Variants \nof  the  Virus  that  Causes  COVID-19  (updated  Apr.  2,  2021) \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html. These VOCs appear more \ncontagious than the original virus, which may lead to more cases, and in turn “put more strain on \nhealthcare resources, lead to more hospitalizations, and potentially more deaths.” Id. This danger \nwill be particularly acute in jails, though most facilities currently do not regularly screen for them. \nSee Eddie Burkhalter, et al., Incarcerated and Infected: How the Virus Tore Through the U.S. \nPrison  System,  N.Y.  Times  (Apr.  10,  2021)  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/\n2021/04/10/us/covid-prison-outbreak.html. For similar reasons, another district court in the Sixth \nCircuit recently held that vaccination clinics alone would be insufficient to end its inquiry into \nwhether the conditions in a Michigan Jail violated the Jail population’s rights in light of COVID-\n19. Malam v. Adducci, No. 20-10829, 2021 WL 1658689, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 27, 2021). \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 29 of 35    PageID\n3553\n \nSince the Decree was negotiated, we have also learned more about the particular challenges \nof vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. population, and particularly among incarcerated populations, as \nsummarized,  supra.  See  CDC,  Willingness  to  Receive  a  COVID-19  Vaccination  Among \nIncarcerated or Detained Persons (fewer than 45% of incarcerated persons surveyed expressing \nwillingness to receive a vaccine, with even larger problem among African Americans, participants \naged 18–29 years old, and those in jails as compared to those in prisons).  \nThe fact that the acceptance rate of vaccinations in the Jail is hovering below 11% is itself \na changed circumstance that supports Plaintiffs’ request for modification. It is clear that vaccine \nefforts thus far have not resulted in the scale of protection the parties would have expected when \nthey negotiated the terms of the Decree. New public health guidance, real-world data not available \nat the time the Decree was drafted, and Mr. Brady’s April 12 report demonstrate that merely \noffering the vaccine in the manner undertaken by Defendants is insufficient to keep Class and \nSubclass Members safe. Insofar as the Decree could be read to end as soon as the first dose of a \ntwo-dose vaccine is simply offered to people in the Jail, it would be deficient. Heath, 888 F.2d at \n1110. This alone provides the Court sufficient authority to modify the Decree to reflect current \npublic health guidance and to effectuate its intent.  \nFinally, Defendants’ conduct since the Decree was entered into supports Plaintiffs’ request. \nBefore implementing, or even responding to, the numerous detailed recommendations put forth in \nMr.  Brady’s  report,  Defendants  rashly  announced  via  press  release  that  a  single,  opaque \nvaccination event on April 15 was to serve as their “final action” under the Decree. Ex. A. They \nlikewise refuse to cooperate with the requests and recommendations from the ventilation expert. \nThe Jail’s decision to turn off the toll-free number by which Class Members could reach their \nattorneys paired with their rush to declare the Decree terminated suggests a desire to escape judicial \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 30 of 35    PageID\n3554\n \noversight and an effort to shirk their responsibilities to implement expert recommendations (or \nprovide explanation why despite their best efforts they cannot) to keep the Jail population safe. In \nsum, if Defendants do not understand the language and intent of the Decree as negotiated to oblige \nthem to provide meaningful, robust and science-based ventilation and other health and safety \nprecautions including an effective vaccine education effort, it is apparent that the language needs \nclarification.  \nC.  Modification Would Effectuate the Decree’s Purpose of Protecting Class and \nSubclass Members  \n“[A] consent decree should be construed to preserve the position for which the parties \nbargained.” Vanguards, 23 F.3d 1013 (citing Vogel v. City of Cincinnati, 959 F.2d 594, 598 (6th \nCir. 1992)). The Court may “fine-tun[e]” such a decree if it identifies “a defect or deficiency in its \noriginal decree which impedes achieving its goal.” Heath, 888 F.2d at 1110. \nThe purpose of the Decree is undeniably to ensure sufficient protections vis à vis COVID-\n19 for Class and Subclass Members until those protections are no longer needed. To that end, the \nDecree terminates upon the earlier of an official public health declaration that the COVID-19 \npandemic has ended or an adequate vaccine program is implemented in the Jail. While the parties \nall hope that the end of the pandemic is close at hand, it is not yet time to cease the protections so \npainstakingly negotiated for, nor to disregard the findings from Mr. Brady’s thorough inspection \nreport or short-change the work of the ventilation expert. Plaintiffs’ proposed modification will \nensure the Decree achieves its intended purpose of providing protections and oversight until they \nare no longer needed because the threat COVID-19 poses to Class and Subclass Members is \nadequately abated.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 31 of 35    PageID\n3555\n \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Proposed Modification Is Appropriate \nIn light of the above, Plaintiffs’ requested termination modification is reasonable and \nlimited, serving simply to confirm the clear intent of the parties that the Decree’s protections run \nuntil the threat COVID-19 poses to the health and safety Class and Subclass Members has ended. \nThis can be achieved by amending Paragraph 28 as follows: \nThis Decree will terminate upon the earliest of either (a) a declaration by the CDC \nand the Tennessee Department of Health that the COVID-19 pandemic is over \nand/or has ended, or (b) an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine is offered to and \nfully administered according to FDA and CDC guidelines to all detainees housed \nat the Jail for a period of more than fourteen (14) days and who accept a vaccination, \nalong with educational materials about the vaccine and non-punitive incentives to \ntake the vaccine, so long as the vaccine program is demonstrated by a showing \nto the Court to result in lasting abatement of the threat COVID-19 poses to \nClass  and  Subclass  members.  While  the  parties  may  agree  that  “lasting \nabatement” has been achieved at any point, the Decree will terminate pursuant \nto section (b) of this Paragraph upon a showing to the Court followed by the \nCourt’s  approval  that  for  a  consecutive  three-month  period  80%  of  the \ndetainee population in the Jail has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, \nor upon a finding by the Independent Inspector that vaccination levels and \nother COVID-19-related health and safety measures have accomplished the \ngoal of keeping Class and Subclass members sufficiently safe. \n \nPlaintiffs submit that this modification is appropriate in light of changed circumstances regarding \nthe  insufficiency  of  vaccinations  to  protect  detainees  in  the  Jail  and  Defendants’  apparent \nunwillingness to adhere to the language and spirit of the Decree as drafted. This modification \nfurthers the public interest by ensuring that the Decree’s protections will run until they are no \nlonger needed, which will serve to both protect Plaintiffs’ rights and the public health of the \nsurrounding community. \nCONCLUSION \n  For all of the above reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enforce \nthe Decree by ordering that Defendants offer adequate educational materials and non-punitive \nincentives  to  increase  the  vaccination  rate  in  the  Jail,  make  best  efforts  to  adopt  the \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 32 of 35    PageID\n3556\n \nrecommendations in Mr. Brady’s reports and the recommendations of the Ventilation Expert, and \nreinstate the toll-free number that permits Class Members to speak with their counsel regarding \nDefendants’ compliance with the Consent Decree; making a finding that the Decree has not \nterminated; and clarifying that the language “offered and administered” in termination provision \n(b)  of  Paragraph  28  of  the  Decree  means  that  vaccinations  must  be  fully  administered  in \naccordance with CDC guidelines for the given vaccine.  \nPlaintiffs further request that the Court modify Paragraph 28 of the Decree to add language \nensuring that it will not terminate until vaccines and other health and safety measures have \nsufficiently abated the threat COVID-19 poses to Class and Subclass Members. \n   \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL-atc   Document 216-2   Filed 05/19/21   Page 33 of 35    PageID\n3557\n \nDated: May 19, 2021   \n \nRespectfully submitted,   \n \n/s/ Meredith Borner         \n \nBrice M.

[ECF No. 50.] \nBACKGROUND \nPetitioners Favian Busby and Michael Edgington originally filed this action on May 20, \n2020, seeking class certification of similarly situated pretrial detainees and requesting an order \nfrom this Court requiring their release from the Shelby County Jail due to fears that they would \ncontact COVID-19. [ECF No. 1.]  In response, Respondents-Defendants filed a motion to dismiss \nand a response in opposition to Petitioners’ motion for class certification. [ECF No. 25.] This Court \ndenied Respondents-Defendants’ motion to dismiss and granted Petitioners’ motion for class \ncertification.  [ECF No. 38.]  Subsequently, Petitioners, Favian Busby, Michael Edgington, Russell \nLeaks, and Joseph Nelson, filed an Amended Petition.  [ECF No. 50.]   \nIn said Amended Petition, Petitioners allege there are specific conditions at the Shelby \nCounty Jail that make them susceptible to being infected by COVID-19. For example, they allege \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 2 of 14    PageID 1135\nthat during mealtimes, detainees are required to “line up inches apart.”  [ECF No. 50, ¶ 32.] They \nfurther claim that they must “use and reuse” the same “high-touch” items, such as telephones and \nkiosks, but that the jail does not provide disinfectant or other cleaning supplies to sanitize these \nitems. [ECF No. 50, ¶ 33.] They also allege that the jail does not test enough new arrestees for \nCOVID-19 and worry that asymptomatic detainees could be infecting others. [ECF No. 50, ¶ 34.]  \nPetitioners claim that by remaining in the Shelby County Jail, their constitutional rights secured \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment are being violated. [ECF No. 50, ¶¶ 59-68.] They also claim that \nthe Shelby County Jail is violating Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n[ECF No. 50, ¶¶ 69-77.] \nSTANDARD \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must \nplead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw a reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Assuming they are true, a \nplaintiff’s allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \n  Pursuant to Rule 201(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a court must take judicial notice \nof adjudicative facts if the fact is not subject to reasonable dispute and it can be accurately and \nreadily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. State court \nproceedings, which are a matter of public record, meet Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b)’s criteria. \nSmith v. Maloon, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69709, *16-18 (S.D. Ohio July 13, 2010). The Court may \ntake judicial notice of these state court proceedings without converting a motion to dismiss into \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 3 of 14    PageID 1136\none for summary judgment. See Scarso v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dep’t of Human Service, 1990 U.S. App. \nLEXIS 19728 (6th Cir. Nov. 2, 1990) (“In determining the legal efficacy of plaintiff's complaint, \nthe lower court properly took judicial notice of facts in the public record, specifically the records \nof state court proceedings.”) (citations omitted); U.S. v. Board of County Com’rs. of Hamilton Cty., \n2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2933 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 14, 2010) (taking judicial notice of state court \ncomplaint and public statements in consideration of a motion for judgment on the pleadings).  \nARGUMENT \nA.  STATE  LAW  REMEDIES  THAT  ARE  A  PART  OF  A  STANDARD  REVIEW  PROCESS  ARE \nAVAILABLE FOR PETITIONERS-PLAINTIFFS BUT HAVE NOT BEEN EXHAUSTED. \n \nIn their original motion to dismiss, Respondents-Defendants’ moved for dismissal on \nmultiple grounds, including Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust state law remedies. [ECF No. \n25-1.]  In  denying  Respondents-Defendants’  initial  motion  to  dismiss,  the  Court  held  that \nDefendants failed “show that courts in Shelby County have procedures in place for the type of \nsubstantive due process grievances Plaintiffs bring to this Court.” [ECF No. 38, PageID 680.]  The \nCourt reasoned that an “inmate’s medical condition in the initial bail decision process pervades” \nTennessee’  pretrial  processing  statutes.  [ECF  No.  38,  PageID  681.]  Thus,  while  the  Court \nacknowledged  that  Tennessee  courts  regularly  entertain  motions  concerning  constitutional \ngrievances, the Court found state law remedies were not available because it could not identify \nany Tennessee court that had considered a “pretrial inmate’s allegation that her substantive right \nto medical treatment under the Eighth Amendment was violated.” [ECF No. 38, PageID 682.]   \nThe exhaustion doctrine is designed to give the state courts a full and fair opportunity to \nresolve federal constitutional claims before those claims are presented to the federal courts. \nO’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). Thus, state prisoners must give the state courts \none full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 4 of 14    PageID 1137\nState’s  established  appellate  review  process.  Id.  State  prisoners  do  not  have  to  invoke \n“extraordinary” remedies when those remedies are alternatives to the standard review process. Id. \nat 844.  Thus, in determining whether state law remedies are available, the Court must examine \nwhether a standard review process exists by which a petitioner can seek relief. See, e.g., Fazzini \nv. Ne.Ohio Corr. Ctr., 473 F.3d 229, 236 (6th Cir. 2009). \nAdmittedly, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a novel situation for both state and federal \ncourts alike. Just because the COVID-19 pandemic is novel, however, does not mean that \nTennessee does not have a standard review process by which pretrial detainees can challenge the \nconstitutionality  of  the  conditions  of  their  pretrial  detention.  As  previously  briefed  by \nRespondents-Defendants,  challenging  a  pretrial  detainee’s  confinement  status  based  upon \nconstitutional grounds is undoubtedly part of the standard review process allowed under Tennessee \nlaw. The Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure provide a clear, well-established avenue for a \npretrial detainee to challenge the conditions of his or her release: \nBefore or after conviction the prosecution or defendant may obtain review of an \norder entered by a trial court from which an appeal lies to the Supreme Court or \nCourt of Criminal Appeals granting, denying, setting or altering conditions of \ndefendant's release. Before conviction, as a prerequisite to review, a written motion \nfor the relief sought on review shall first be presented to the trial court. After \nconviction and after the action is pending on appeal, a written motion may be made \neither in the trial court in which judgment was entered or in the appellate court to \nwhich the appeal has been taken. On entry of an order granting or denying a motion \nfor a change in bail or other conditions of release, the trial court shall state in writing \nthe reasons for the action taken. \n \nTenn. R. App. P. 8.  Pursuant to the standard review process established by Rule 8, pretrial \ndetainees can challenge the constitutionality of their pretrial detention and can obtain immediate \nreview of the trial court’s orders on such challenges by Tennessee appellate courts.1 \n \n1 See e.g., State v. Burgins, 464 S.W.3d 298, 307-08 (Tenn. 2015) (considering on appeal pursuant to Rule 8(a) of the \nTennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure whether a pre-trial detainee’s due process rights as secured by the Fourteenth \nAmendment were violated when her bond was revoked); State v. Hill, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 643, *6 (Tenn. \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 5 of 14    PageID 1138\nTennessee courts do not and cannot cherry pick which constitutional challenges they must \nconsider when hearing challenges to the constitutionality of pretrial detention. O’Sullivan, 526 \nU.S. at 844 (“State courts, like federal courts, are obliged to enforce federal law.”). Pursuant to the \nstandard review process established by Rule 8, pretrial defendants can and do challenge the \nconstitutionality of their pretrial detention on various constitutional grounds. Even before the \nCOVID-19  pandemic,  Tennessee  courts  heard  challenges  that  detention  amounted  to \n“punishment” in violation of a criminal defendant’s substantive and procedural due process rights. \nState v. Johnson, 980 S.W.2d 414, 421 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998) (holding that “Pre-trial detention \nthat is remedial as distinguished from punitive is permissible provided that the individual is \nafforded sufficient due process.”); State v. Hill, 2019 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 643, *5-6 (Tenn. \nCrim. App. March 21, 2019) (considering whether the criminal defendant’s pretrial detention was \nremedial or punitive in violation of his substantive due process right to liberty). Notably, in \ndetermining whether a pretrial detainee’s right to be free from “punishment” is being or was \nviolated, Tennessee courts’ considerations include (1) whether the detention served an alternative \npurpose, and (2) whether detention is excessive in relation to the purpose. State v. Coolidge, 915 \nS.W.2d 820, 824 (Tenn. 1995); see also, State v. Larsen, 2013 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 19, *16-\n17 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2013); State v. Pennington, 1997 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1220, *9-10 \n(Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 1997). The Tennessee Supreme Court has further explained: \n \nCrim. App. March 21, 2019) (considering on appeal pursuant to Rule 8(a) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal \nProcedure whether a pre-trial detainee’s due process rights as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment were violated \nbased upon the trial court’s order concerning the conditions of the detainee’s pre-trial release); State v. Clouse, 2001 \nTenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 504, *11 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 11, 2001) (considering whether pre-trial detainee’s \nconstitutional right to be free from double jeopardy as secured by the Fifth Amendment was being violated); State v. \nClark, 2010 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 249, *14 (Tenn. Crim. App. March 18, 2010) (considering whether convicted \ndefendant’s right to a speedy trial as secured by the Sixth Amendment was violated when trial court denied a motion \nto dismiss for denial of a speedy trial prior to trial); State v. Leavy, 1999 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 1296, *7 (Tenn. \nCrim. App. Dec. 21, 1999) (considering whether convicted defendants’ pre-trial detention was “punitive”). \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 6 of 14    PageID 1139\n[I]f a particular condition or restriction of…detention is reasonably related to a \nlegitimate  governmental  objective,  it  does  not,  without  more,  amount  to \n“punishment.” Conversely, if a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to \na legitimate goal -- if it is arbitrary or purposeless -- a court permissibly may infer \nthat  the  purpose  of  the  governmental  action  is  punishment  that  may  not \nconstitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees. \n \nDoe v. Norris, 751 S.W.2d 834, 838-840 (Tenn. 1988) (citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 \n(1979)).  \nHere, Petitioners’ claim in this case is exactly what the aforementioned Tennessee courts \nconsidered, namely that their pretrial custody amounts to “punishment” in violation of their \nFourteenth Amendment rights. [ECF No. 50, ¶¶ 59-62.] While the COVID-19 pandemic may \npresent new grounds to claim that their pretrial detention is “punitive,” constitutional challenges \nin Tennessee courts to pretrial detention as “punitive” are nothing new, nor “extraordinary.”  \n In light of the well-established procedure in Tennessee law for pretrial detainees to \nchallenge the constitutionality of their pretrial detention, numerous pretrial detainees have filed, \nand Shelby County Criminal Courts have considered, motions to eliminate and/or reduce bonds \nbased upon challenges that conditions in the Shelby County Jail violate a pretrial detainee’s \nconstitutional rights due to COVID-19. For example, attached are three separate motions filed by \npretrial detainees in Shelby County Courts seeking release and/or a reduction in bond on grounds \nthat the conditions created by COVID-19 in the Shelby County Jail violate their constitutional \nrights. Notably, in the case of State of Tennessee v. Roterrio Johnson, Case No. 20100946, Roterrio \nJohnson, specifically argued that denying him pretrial release “during the COVID-19 pandemic \ncould result not only in the loss of [his] health, but also [his] life, reflecting deliberate indifference \nin violation of due process.”2 (Exhibit A). Similarly, in State of Tennessee v. Jaylon Faulkner, \n \n2 In preparing his motion, Roterrio Johnson utilized a form, prepared by the Shelby County Public Defenders’ Office.  \nNotably, the Shelby County Public Defenders Officer prepared said form motion and provided to pretrial detainees in \nShelby County to complete and file at their discretion. The fact that the Shelby County Public Defenders’ Office \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 7 of 14    PageID 1140\nCase No. C2002284, Jaylon Faulkner moved for release on the grounds that his pretrial detention \nviolated both the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because of the COVID-19 “outbreak” in \n“prisons and jails.” (Exhibit C). In State of Tennessee v. Mark Noelker, Case No. M46350, the \nsentencing judge reduced Mr. Noelker’s bond from $1,000,000.00 to $75,000.00 after Mark \nNoelker argued his bond was excessive in light of the “Sheriff of Shelby County” being “desirous \nof reducing the number of inmates at the jail due to the COVID-19 pandemic.” (Exhibit B). These \nmotions reveal that pretrial detainees are utilizing the standard review process as set forth by Rule \n8 to challenge the constitutionality of their pretrial detention in light of COVID-19, and Shelby \nCounty courts are considering those challenges.3  \nImportantly, it is the petitioner who has the burden of showing exhaustion. Rust v. Zent, 17 \nF.3d 155, 160 (6th Cir. 1994). The requirement that a habeas petitioner exhaust state-court \nremedies before seeking relief in federal court “protect[s] the state courts” opportunity to confront \ninitially and resolve constitutional issues arising within their jurisdictions and to limit federal \njudicial interference in state adjudicatory processes.” Atkins v. Michigan, 644 F.2d 543, 546 (6th \nCir. 1981). A court must “abstain from the exercise of…jurisdiction if the issues raised in the \npetition may be resolved either by trial on the merits in the state courts or by other state procedures \navailable to the petitioner.” Id. A state prisoner’s federal habeas petition must be dismissed if the \nprisoner has not exhausted available state remedies concerning any of his federal claims. Coleman \n \nprepared such a form, further proves that even the Shelby County Public Defenders’ Office recognizes that pursuant \nto the standard review process available under Tennessee law, Tennessee courts have and will consider constitutional \nchallenges to pretrial detention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n3 As previously addressed by Respondents-Defendants, the Tennessee Supreme Court ordered that as part of the \nstandard review process, Tennessee courts must specifically consider the effects of COVID-19 in setting or eliminating \nbond. See In Re: COVID-19 Pandemic, ADM2020-00428 (Tenn. March 25, 2020) (ordering all judicial districts to \nimplement plans to reduce the jail population due to the COVID-19 pandemic through “bond reductions or \neliminations, deferred sentences, and suspended sentences….”); See also, In re: Covid-19 Pandemic, No. ADM2020-\n00428 (Tenn. March 13, 2020). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 8 of 14    PageID 1141\nv. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 731 (1991); Luedtke v. Berkebile, 704 F.3d 465, 466 (6th Cir. \n2013); Graham v. Snyder, 68 F. App’x 589, 590 (6th Cir. 2003). In fact, a district court must raise \nthe exhaustion issue sua sponte when it clearly appears that habeas claims have not been presented \nto the state courts. See Prather v. Rees, 822 F.2d 1418, 1422 (6th Cir. 1987); Allen v. Perini, 424 \nF.2d 134, 138-39 (6th Cir. 1970). \nHere, Petitioners have undoubtedly failed to exhaust state law remedies that are available \npursuant to Tennessee’s standard review process.  Accordingly, their claims must be dismissed as \na matter of law. \nB.  PETITIONERS-PLAINTIFFS CHALLENGE THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR CONFINEMENT – NOT \nTHE “FACT OR DURATION” OF THEIR CONFINEMENT. \n \nA habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is typically “reserved for challenges to \nthe execution of a sentence, such as a computation of parole or sentencing credits....” Velasco v. \nLamanna, 16 F. App’x 311, 314 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Cohen v. United States, 593 F.2d 766, 770-\n71  (6th  Cir.  1979)); see Sullivan  v.  United  States,  90  F.  App’x  862,  863  (6th  Cir.  2004). \nAdditionally,  while  the  Sixth  Circuit  has  long  recognized  that  pretrial  detainees  may \npursue habeas relief under § 2241, pretrial detainees can do so only in rare, “extraordinary” \ninstances. Christian v. Wellington, 739 F.3d 294, 297 (6th Cir. 2014). In fact, the Sixth Circuit has \napproved consideration of a pretrial § 2241 petition only in three exceptional circumstances: (1) \nwhen the petitioner seeks a speedy trial,  (2) when a petitioner seeks to avoid a second trial on \ndouble  jeopardy  grounds, and  (3)  when  a  petitioner  faces  prejudice  from  prior  ineffective \nassistance of counsel and due process violations on retrial. Turner v. Tennessee, 858 F.2d 1201, \n1204 (6th Cir. 1988), vacated on other grounds, 492 U.S. 902, 109 S. Ct. 3208, 106 L. Ed. 2d 559 \n(1990); Atkins v. Michigan, 644 F.2d 543, 545 (6th Cir. 1981); Delk v. Atkinson, 665 F.2d 90, 93 \n(6th Cir. 1981). \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 9 of 14    PageID 1142\nHabeas corpus is never available to pre- or post-trial prisoners who complain about the \nconditions of confinement. See e.g., Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004); Luedtke v. \nBerkebile, 704 F.3d 465, 466 (6th Cir. 2013); Sullivan v. United States, 90 F. App’x 862, 863 (6th \nCir. 2004).  see also, Sanchez v. Dallas County, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90667, *39 (N.D. Tex. \nMay 22, 2020) (holding that a habeas petitioner was the improper vehicle for pre-trial detainees to \nseek release from jail due to COVID-19); Barrett v. Carvajal, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84873 (N.D. \nOhio May 14, 2020) (holding a complaint that deteriorating conditions in a prison due to COVID-\n19 was not cognizable under § 2241). \n  Here, Petitioners make a plethora of complaints about the conditions of – not the fact of – \ntheir confinement.  For example, they allege that during mealtimes, detainees are required to “line \nup inches apart,” that they have only been provided “one mask,” that they do not receive enough \nsoap, that they must “use and reuse” the same “high-touch” items, such as telephones and kiosks, \nbut that the jail does not provide disinfectant or other cleaning supplies to sanitize these items, that \ndetainees are rarely allowed to clean their cells, that they receive only one set of clean clothes per \nweek, that they must use “unwashed” towels wo wipe down surfaces, and that the jail does not test \nenough new arrestees for COVID-19. [ECF No. 50, ¶¶ 32-34.] Such allegations clearly concern \nthe conditions of the Shelby County Jail, not the “fact” of Petitioners’ confinement. Whatever their \nconditions of confinement, they are not related to Petitioners’ “fact or duration” of their respective \nconfinements. Thus, a habeas corpus petition under § 2241 is not the proper vehicle for Petitioners’ \nto present such claims or allegations.  \nC.  IF PETITIONERS-PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE COGNIZABLE, THEY MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE \nREQUIREMENTS FOR RELIEF OUTLINED WITHIN 18 U.S.C. § 3626. \n \nIf Petitioners’ claims challenging their conditions of confinement were cognizable in \nhabeas (they are not), then the Prison Litigation Report Act’s (“PLRA”) requirements for prisoner \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 10 of 14    PageID 1143\nrelease orders must apply.  Santana v. United States, 98 F.3d 752, 756 (3d Cir. 1996); see also \nBlair-Bey v. Quick, 151 F.3d 1036, 1040-42 (D.C. Cir. 1998). “[I]t would defeat the purpose of \nthe PLRA if a prisoner could evade its requirements by simply…joining it with a petition for \nhabeas corpus.” See Blair-Bey, 151 F.3d at 1042. \nA federal court may not enter a prisoner release order unless there has been a prior order \n“for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be \nremedied through the prison release order,” and respondent “has had a reasonable amount of time \nto comply with the previous court order[].” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A). Moreover, only a three-\njudge court may enter a prison release order and can only do so after a prisoner files an appropriate \nrequest. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(3). The three-judge panel may enter such an order “only if the court \nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that—(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of \na Federal right; and (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(3).  Here,  Petitioners  should  not  be  allowed  to  circumvent  the  PLRA’s  unambiguous \nrequirements to obtain release.  Petitioners plainly complain about the current prison conditions of \nthe Shelby County Jail.  Such complaints fall squarely within the purview of the PLRA. Because \nPetitioners have failed to comply with the PLRA prior to seeking release, their petition must be \ndismissed.  \nD.  PETITIONERS’ “UNCONSTITUTIONAL PUNISHMENT” CLAIM FAILS AS A MATTER OF LAW. \n \nPetitioners have improperly attempted to carve out a separate claim for unconstitutional \n“punishment”  in  addition  to  seeking  relief  from  alleged  unconstitutional  “conditions  of \nconfinement” at the Jail. [ECF No. 50, ¶¶ 59-68.] Fourteenth Amendment due process claims “are \nanalyzed under the same rubric as Eighth Amendment claims brought by prisoners.” Richmond v. \nHuq, 885 F.3d 928, 938 (6th Cir. 2018); Villegas v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 709 F.3d 563, 568 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 11 of 14    PageID 1144\n(6th Cir. 2013); Cooper v. Montgomery Cty., 768 F. App’x. 385, 392 (6th Cir. 2019).  Thus, in \norder to state a claim that prison conditions violate the Constitution, a pretrial detainee-plaintiff \nmust allege that he has been subjected to deprivations so serious that he was deprived of the \n“minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities” and that jail officials acted wantonly, with \ndeliberate indifference to his serious needs. Richmond v. Settles, 450 F. App’x 448, 454-55 (6th \nCir. 2011); see also, Martin v. Warren Cty., 799 F. App’x 329 (6th Cir. 2020) (determining that a \ndistrict court did not inappropriately apply the deliberate indifference standard to a pre-trial \ndetainee’s  failure  to  provide  adequate  medical  care  claim  and  confirming,  “[L]iability  for \nnegligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.”); \nCameron v. Bouchard, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 16741, *22 (6th Cir. May 26, 2020) (Bush, J., \ndissenting)  (“In  a  deliberate  indifference  claim  challenging  the  conditions  of  a  prisoner’s \nconfinement, the plaintiff must satisfy both the objective and subjective components of the Eighth \nAmendment inquiry. The same requirements apply to a pre-trial detainee’s due process rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.” (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added)); Taylor v. \nMadison Cty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 212614, *4 n.1 (W.D. Tenn. Dec. 10, 2019) \n(“Although a pretrial detainee’s claim regarding the conditions of his confinement is reviewed \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, the standard is the same.”); Swain v. Junior, \n2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 18689, *16 (11th Cir. June 15, 2020) (“Although the plaintiffs’ claim \ntechnically arises under the Fourteenth Amendment because they are pretrial detainees rather than \nconvicted prisoners, it is “evaluated under the same standard as a prisoner's claim of inadequate \ncare under the Eighth Amendment.”). Based upon the above, Petitioners’ claim that Respondents \nhave acted in an unconstitutional manner by simply “continuing to detain” them, fails to state a \nclaim. [ECF No. 50, ¶¶ 59-62.] Accordingly, Petitioners’ claim for “unconstitutional punishment” \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 12 of 14    PageID 1145\noutlined within their “First Claim for Relief” must be dismissed. [Id.]. \nE.  PETITIONERS HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FACTS TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE \nSUFFERED  DISCRIMINATION  IN  VIOLATION  OF  TITLE  II  OF  THE  AMERICANS  WITH \nDISABILITIES ACT (“ADA”) OR SECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT (“RA”). \n \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA  prohibits  a  public  entity  from  discriminating  against  disabled \nindividuals and states that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § \n12132. Similarly, Section 504 of the RA protects any “otherwise qualified individual” from \n“be[ing] excluded from the participation in, be[ing] denied the benefits of, or be[ing] subjected to \ndiscrimination” under specified programs or activities “solely by reason of her or his disability.” \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \nAs a threshold matter, district courts within the Sixth Circuit have recently explained that \nalleged violations of the ADA are “inappropriate for a habeas corpus case.” Shaholli v. Deangelo-\nKipp, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92014, *27 (E.D. Mich. May 27, 2020) (referencing Meyers v. \nHedgpeth, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67198, (N.D. Cal. May 15, 2014) (“The ADA is not a federal \nconstitutional provision or guarantee.”); see also Cometa v. Warden, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n33630, *4 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 27, 2020) (“[T]he Court will not address the merits of these [Eighth \nAmendment and ADA] claims because they are not proper in a habeas petition filed pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 2241.”)). Thus, Petitioners’ ADA/RA theories must fail. \nNotwithstanding, “[i]nmates alleging claims under the ADA and the RA must show prison \nofficials took the challenged actions because of the inmate’s alleged disability.” Finfrock v. Mohr, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192024 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 5, 2019) (citing Clayton v. Michigan Dep’t of \nCorr., 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 27251, **5-6 (6th Cir. Aug. 21, 2017) (explaining that “even \n\nCase 2:20-cv-02359-SHL   Document 78-1   Filed 06/30/20   Page 13 of 14    PageID 1146\naccepting as true the inmate’s allegation that prison officials denied a request to transfer him to a \nfacility with inpatient mental health treatment, he set forth no allegations to suggest that this denial \nwas due to his HIV status.”)). Here, Petitioners have outlined the dangers of COVID-19 and have \nasserted that Respondents  have generally failed to  take appropriate measures to  protect  all \ndetainees. [See ECF No. 50.] However, Petitioners have failed to allege sufficient facts to establish \nthat Respondents have failed to provide Petitioners with any reasonable accommodations – other \nthan immediate release from Jail4 – or that any specific action was taken against Petitioners-\nPlaintiffs because of their proposed disabilities. Accordingly, Petitioners’ ADA and RA claims fail \nas a matter of law.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Based upon the above and upon the record as a whole, this Court should dismiss this matter \nin its entirety. \nRespectfully submitted, \nPENTECOST, GLENN & MAULDIN, PLLC \n \n      By:   s/Nathan D.
