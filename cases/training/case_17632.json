He purports to seek relief on behalf of \"Auto racing facilities located and operating in the State of New York... including, but not limited to, Lebanon Valley Speedway, W. Lebanon, N.Y.\" (Id. at 1.) McGuire argues that the court's June 26, 2020 Memorandum-Decision and Order applies to the interests that he represents. (Id. at 2-4.) Among other things, the application is procedurally improper. It was filed by an attorney who represents undisclosed entities that are not parties to this action. It is not compliant with Rule 7.1 of the Local Rules of Practice either. Lastly, the motion is obviously without merit, and arguably frivolous. For all of these reasons, the application for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 37) is DENIED. IT IS SO ORDERED. Issued by Senior Judge Gary L. Sharpe on 7/1/2020. (jel, ) (Entered: 07/01/2020)"

As that rule indicates, \"[o]n timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who:... has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1). \"In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). Having carefully reviewed the submissions of both groups of proposed intervenors, (Dkt. Nos. 44, 47), the court is unpersuaded that it should exercise its great discretion. In the broadest terms, there are common questions of law or fact and the motions are likely timely, but the delay and prejudice to the parties in this matter, all of whom are represented by competent counsel capable of effectively advancing the interests of the parties they represent, that would result from permitting intervention, even if not overwhelming, requires denial of the motions. Accordingly, both motions to intervene, (Dkt. Nos. 44, 47), are DENIED; and the motions are denied in all other respects as moot. IT IS SO ORDERED. Issued by Senior Judge Gary L. Sharpe on 7/28/2020.

It is hereby ORDERED that the Appellants' motion for an injunction pending appeal proscribing enforcement of 10- and 25 person capacity limits in houses of religious worship is DENIED as moot in light of this Courts decision in Agudath Israel of America v. Cuomo, Nos. 20-3572, 20-3590 (2d Cir. Dec. 28, 2020) (Agudath Israel) (holding such capacity limitations invalid). Also, for the same reasons stated in Agudath Israel, Appellants' motion for an injunction pending appeal proscribing enforcement of 25% and 33% capacity limits in houses of religious worship is DENIED. Instead, the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction as to the 25% and 33% capacity limits is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings in light of Agudath Israel. It is further ORDERED that Appellees' motion to strike is DENIED and Appellants' motion to expedite the appeal is DENIED as moot. [Certified Copy Issued on 1/5/2020] (kmc) (Entered: 01/06/2021)"

    "summary": "<p>As part of New York&rsquo;s ban on gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance at houses of worship and outdoor religious gatherings was strictly limited. In June 2020, state and city officials allowed mass gatherings protesting the death of George Floyd, but continued to actively enforce prohibitions against congregational worship.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2020, two Catholic priests and three Orthodox Jews filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. They alleged that Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio, by allowing protests while prohibiting worship, were discriminating against people of faith and violating their constitutional rights. Represented by the Thomas More Society, they alleged violations of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments (under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983), as well as the New York Constitution, and New York Executive Law. They sought a declaration that the restrictions on indoor and outdoor worship were unconstitutional and were illegal under New York law; a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a final injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing limitations on worship services; and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. The case was assigned to Senior Judge Gary L. Sharpe.</p>\r\n<p>On June 11, 2020, the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a temporary restraining order was denied for services occurring on June 12 or 14 because there was insufficient time to make a reasoned determination given that the complaint had been filed the prior day.</p>\r\n<p>On June 26, 2020, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. 470 F.Supp.3d 268. The injunction prohibited the defendants from limiting the plaintiffs&rsquo; indoor worship beyond the limitations imposed on businesses listed in Phase 2 of New York&rsquo;s reopening plan. It also prohibited any numerical limitation on attendance at the plaintiffs&rsquo; outdoor worship services. The defendants appealed the order on July 27.</p>\r\n<p>On October 9, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. It added additional plaintiffs and additional defendants including the Superintendent of the New York State Police, the New York State Commissioner of Health, and various officials in the New York City Department of Education. The amended complaint also added claims seeking to enjoin the defendants from closing religious schools.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs concurrently filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to the same effect, but it was denied due to failure to properly serve the defendants. On October 15, 2020, the plaintiffs filed another motion for a temporary restraining order.</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 2020, the court denied the temporary restraining order. 498 F.Supp.3d 318. It found that plaintiffs had failed to show their claims were likely to succeed on the merits or that the public interest would not be harmed by the injunction. Specifically, the court found that the circumstances surrounding the case had changed since preliminary relief was granted in June. Earlier in October, Governor Cuomo issued Executive Order 202 which reworked COVID rules. Under these new rules, the court determined that religious gathering were actually treated better than comparative services (sports, concerts, movies, etc.). Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on the same day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 2021, the Second Circuit denied the appeal as moot. 2021 WL 37592. However, this seemingly favored the plaintiffs as it was in light of the court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Agudath Israel of America v. Cuomo</em> which had invalidated similar capacity limits on religious services. In that case, the court had found that the limits on such services were not narrowly tailored. Notably, the court also refused to apply <em>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</em> which the state had cited to support the notion that courts should defer to the executive in the face of a public health emergency. The court distinguished the case which involved mandatory vaccination laws and also cited language that a public-health measure &ldquo;must always yield in case of conflict with . . . any right which [the Constitution] gives or secures.&rdquo; As such, the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with <em>Agudath Israel</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On June 9, 2021, the parties stipulated to a settlement. Under the terms, New York&rsquo;s Executive Order 202 would continue to be enforced. However, the city agreed that it would not issue any COVID-related restrictions on houses of worship more restrictive than those imposed by the state unless COVID cases substantially increased. Further, these restrictions would be as favorable as those imposed on comparable gatherings. In exchange, the plaintiffs dismissed the case and waived their right to attorney&rsquo;s fees. The court accepted the settlement on June 10, 2021. On August 16, 2021, the parties stipulated to a dismissal which the court accepted eight days later.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York exempted mass protests against police violence from gathering restrictions while congregational worship continued to be prohibited. As a result, two Catholic priests and three Orthodox Jews brought this lawsuit, alleging that New York officials were discriminating against people of faith. \r\n\r\nIn June 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction that limited the state’s ability to limit religious gatherings. However, in October 2020 the court denied plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order. It determined that Executive Order 202, issued earlier in October, had now actually given religious gatherings more favorable treatment that comparable gatherings (sports, concerts, movies). The Second Circuit dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal as moot under it’s recent decision in Agudath Israel of America v. Cuomo. In that case, the Second Circuit had cited language refusing to defer to the executive during a public health emergency when constitutionally protected rights were at stake.\r\n\r\nIn June 2021, the parties reached a settlement. Executive Order 202 would continue to be enforced, however, New York City agreed that it would not issue any COVID-related restrictions on houses of worship more restrictive than those imposed by the state. However, if COVID cases surged, the city would only imposed restrictions on religious gatherings as favorable as comparable gatherings.",

Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York; Letitia\nJames, Attorney General of the State of New York; and Bill de Blasio,\nMayor of the City of New York: (1) from enforcing any gathering limits to\noutdoor religious gatherings; and (2) from imposing any limitation on\nindoor gathering . . . for religious gatherings in parity\n1  Plaintiffs’ initially sought a temporary restraining order, but, at the conclusion of the\nreturn on that application, the court discussed with the parties the preferability of allowing them\nto supplement the record and argument, and address the application for preliminary injunctive\nrelief without resort to a further evidentiary hearing; the court’s proposed course of action was\nacceptable to all the parties and obviates the need to consider the application for a temporary\nrestraining order.  (Dkt. No. 31, Attach. 1 at 38-49.)\n2\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 3 of 38\nwith  the  100%  occupancy  allowed  for  favored\n“essential  businesses,”  day  camps  and  special\neducation  classes,  or,  alternatively,  at  least  50%\noccupancy  in  keeping  with  what  is  permitted  for\n“non-essential” businesses and every other indoor\nactivity allowed to continue under Phases Two and\nThree except religious activity, which alone is still\narbitrarily confined to 25% occupancy.\n(Dkt. No. 32 at 10.)  For the reasons explained and to the extent described\nbelow, the application for a preliminary injunction is granted.\nII.  Background\nFor the past several months, the United States, and, indeed, the\nentire world, has been suffering from a global pandemic brought about by\nCOVID-19.  The State of New York, and particularly the New York City\nmetropolitan area, have been described as the “epicenter” of the pandemic.\n See New York Coronavirus Map and Case Count, N.Y. Times (last visited\nJune 26, 2020), https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/ \nnew-york-coronavirus-cases.html.  To date, there have been 395,168\ncases, and 31,029 deaths because of COVID-19 in the State of New York. \nSee id.\nA. The Executive Orders\nBeginning in March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 4 of 38\nbesieging New York, Governor Cuomo issued a series of executive orders,\nplacing restrictions on New Yorkers:\n(1) Order 202, issued on March 7, declared a disaster emergency in the\nState of New York.  (Dkt. No. 1, Attach. 1 at 1-3.)\n(2) Order 202.1, issued on March 12, prohibited large gatherings of over\n500 people.  (Id. at 4-7.)\n(3) Order 202.3, issued on March 16, narrowed the prohibition on large\ngatherings to fifty persons.  (Id. at 10-11.)\n(4) Order 202.6, issued on March 18, required all New York State \nbusinesses to “reduce the in-person workforce at any work locations by\n50%,” with exceptions for those businesses and entities that provided\n“essential services or functions.”  (Id. at 17-18.)\n(5) Order 202.8, issued on March 20, reduced the in-person workforces\nof non-essential businesses by 100%.  (Id. at 21-22.)\n(6) Order 202.10, issued on March 23, declared a total ban on “non-\nessential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason.”  (Id. at\n25-28.)\n(7) Order 202.17, issued on April 15, required face-coverings to be worn\n“when  in  a  public  place  and  unable  to  maintain,  or  when  not\nmaintaining, social distance.”  (Id. at 46.)\n(8) Order 202.31, issued on May 14, extended the closure of non-\nessential  businesses  and  entities,  and  the  ban  on  non-essential\ngatherings.    (Id.  at  69-70.)    The  Order  also  provided  that  “[a]ll\nenforcement mechanisms by state or local governments shall continue\nto be in full force an[d] effect until June 13, 2020 unless later extended\nor amended by a future Executive Order.”  (Id.)\n(9) Order 202.32, issued on May 21, modified the previous ban on non-\n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 5 of 38\nessential gatherings “to permit a gathering of ten or fewer individuals for\nany  religious  service  or  ceremony,”  provided  that  certain  social\ndistancing and health protocols were adhered to, and ordered that “any\ndrive-in or remote religious service may continue in excess of the ten\nperson  limit  so  long  as  there  is  no  in-person  contact  between\nparticipants.”  (Id. at 71-73.)\n(10)  Order  202.33,  issued  on  May  22,  permitted  non-essential\ngatherings of ten or fewer individuals “for any lawful purpose or reason,”\nprovided  that  certain  social  distancing  and  health  protocols  were\nadhered to.  (Id. at 74.)\n(11)  Order  202.34,  issued  on  May  28,  continued  the  restriction,\npostponement, and/or cancellation, of all non-essential gatherings of\nmore than ten individuals, but allowed for any region that met certain\npublic health and safety metrics to begin “Phase One reopening.”  (Id.\nat 75-76.)\n(12) Order 202.35, issued on May 29, ended workplace reductions and\nrestrictions in certain regions for non-essential businesses, the “Phase\nTwo industries,” which include: professional services, administrative\nsupport, and information technology; real estate services, building and\nproperty management, leasing, rental, and sales services; retail in-store\nshopping, rental, repair, and cleaning; barbershops and hair salons; and\nmotor vehicle leasing, rental, and sales.  (Id. at 77-78.)  The restriction\non outdoor gatherings of groups of more than ten people remained in\nplace.  (Id.)\n(13) Order 202.36, issued on June 2, declared that any region to meet\ncertain public health and safety metrics “may allow outdoor, low-risk\nrecreational  activities  and  businesses  providing  such  activities,  as\ndetermined by Empire State Development Corporation, to be permitted\nto operate, in accordance with Department of Health guidance.”  (Id. at\n79-80.)\n(14) Order 202.37, issued on June 5, declared that “special education\nservices and instruction required under Federal, state or local laws,\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 6 of 38\nrules, or regulations, may be provided in person for the summer term in\nschool districts.”  (Id. at 81.)\n(15) Order 202.38, issued on June 6, modified Order 202.35, permitting\nany region to have entered “Phase Two” of New York’s reopening plan\nto allow “non-essential gatherings for houses of worship at no greater\nthan 25% of the indoor capacity of such location.”  (Id. at 82-83.)  The\nrestriction on outdoor gatherings of groups of more than ten people\nremained in place.  (Id.)\n(16) Order 202.42, issued on June 15, modified Order 202.35 and Order\n202.38, permitting any region to have entered “Phase Three” of New\nYork’s reopening plan to allow “non-essential gatherings . . . [of] twenty-\nfive (25) or fewer individuals, for any lawful purpose or reason.”  (Dkt.\nNo. 33, Attach. 1 at 5.)\nOn June 17, 2020, Mayor de Blasio issued an “Emergency Executive\nOrder” incorporating Governor Cuomo’s executive orders, and “direct[ing]\nthe Fire Department of the City of New York, the New York City Police\nDepartment, the Department of Buildings, the Sheriff, and other agencies\nas needed to immediately enforce the [orders].”  (Dkt. No. 32, Attach. 3 at\n1-2.)\nB. The Guidance\nA document entitled “Guidance for Determining Whether a Business\nEnterprise is Subject to a Workforce Reduction Under Recent Executive\nOrders,” (hereinafter, the “Guidance Document”), was published and\nsimultaneously updated by the State of New York with the issuance of the\n6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 7 of 38\nexecutive orders described above.  (Dkt. No. 1, Attach. 1 at 94-125, 128-\n38.)\nFrom March 20 through March 24, 2020 the Guidance Document\nprovided that “worship services” are included among the enumerated\nbusinesses that “must remain closed and are not eligible for designation as\nan essential business for purposes of this guidance.”  (Id. at 98.)\nFrom March 25 through April 7, 2020 the Guidance Document\nprovided that although “[h]ouses of worship are not ordered closed[,] . . . it\nis strongly recommended not to hold congregate services,” and reiterated\nthat “worship services . . . are not eligible for designation as an essential\nbusiness for purposes of this guidance.”  (Id. at 105.)  From April 8 through\nApril 9, 2020 “worship services” continued to be listed as among the\nbusinesses that “must remain closed and are not eligible for designation as\nan essential business for purposes of this guidance.”  (Id. at 113.)\nFrom April 10 through May 20, 2020 the Guidance Document\nprovided: \nPursuant to Executive Order 202.10 . . . , all non-\nessential gatherings of individuals of any size for any\nreasons (e.g. worship services, parties, celebrations\nor other social events) are canceled or postponed. \nCongregate services within houses of worship are\n7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 8 of 38\nprohibited.  Houses of worship may only be used by\nindividuals  and  only  where  appropriate  social\ndistancing of, at least, six feet between people can be\nmaintained.  Further, individuals should not gather in\nhouses  of  worship,  homes,  or  other  locations  for\nreligious services until the end of this public health\nemergency.    If  possible,  religious  leaders  should\nconsider alternative forms of worship, replacing in-\nperson  gatherings  with  virtual  services,  such  as\nphone or conference calls, videoconference calls, or\nonline streaming.\n(Id. at 123.)\nFrom May 21 through June 5, 2020, the Guidance Document\npermitted a gathering of ten or fewer people for a religious service or\nceremony, provided that certain social distancing and health protocols were\nadhered to, and permitted “any drive-in or remote religious service may\ncontinue in excess of the ten person limit so long as there is no in-person\ncontact between participants.”  (Id. at 135-36.)  It further provided that\n“[f]aith leaders should continue to consider and use alternative forms of\nworship,” and that “congregations of groups for religious service or\nceremony in excess of ten in-person participants remain prohibited.”  (Id.)\nGuidance for “Phase Two Industries” limit indoor capacity to no more\n8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 9 of 38\nthan 50% of maximum capacity.2  See, e.g., Reopening New York:\nEssential and Phase II Retail Business Guidelines for Employers and\nEmployees, https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/\natoms/files/GeneralRetailSummaryGuidance.pdf; Reopening New York:\nHair Salon and Barbershop Guidelines for Employers and Employees,\nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/HairSal\nonsAndBarbershopSummaryGuidance.pdf.  And guidance for restaurants\nin “Phase Three” limits indoor capacity to no more than 50% of maximum\noccupancy, exclusive of employees.  (Dkt. No. 32, Attach. 6 at 1.)\nBeginning today, on June 26, outdoor graduations of up to 150\npeople will be allowed.3  See New York State Department of Health,\nUpdated Interim Guidance for Graduation Celebrations During the COVID-\n19 State of Emergency (June 14, 2020), https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/\nsystem/files/documents/2020/06/doh_covid19_updatedgraduationguidance\n_061420.pdf; Governor Announces Outdoor Graduations of up to 150 Will\n2  The court takes judicial notice of the information contained on New York State’s\nofficial website as such public information is “accurately and readily determined from sources\nwhose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed.

The Protests\nMass race-related protests have erupted across the nation, including\nin the State of New York, in response to the death of African-American\nGeorge Floyd on May 25, 2020.  (Compl. ¶ 22.)  Protesters, sometimes in\ngroups of thousands, have taken to the streets of New York City as well as\nother major cities in the State of New York.  (Id. ¶¶ 22, 61, 69.)\nDuring this time, a “social media campaign” has encouraged theaters\nin New York, which are to be closed until “Phase Four” of New York’s\nreopening plan, to open their lobbies and restrooms for protesters.  (Dkt.\nNo. 1, Attach. 1 at 160-64.)\nD. Responses From Cuomo and de Blasio\n1. Governor Cuomo\nDuring a press conference held on June 1, 2020, when asked if he\nwould “suggest people not go out and protest,” Governor Cuomo\nanswered: \nNo, I think you can protest, but do it smartly and\nintelligently. . . . There were protests all across the\ncountry.  Protest.  Just be smart about it.  With this\n10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 11 of 38\nvirus, you can do many things now as long as you’re\nsmart about it, right?  You can reopen, you can go\ninto a store and you can do a lot of things, just be\nsmart.\n \n(Id. at 146.)  When asked what the difference is “between protesting and a\nbusiness, say, in the city who wants to reopen smartly if it’s not at the\nphase yet that they’re technically allowed to,” Governor Cuomo answered: \nWell, that’s where we’re at, but it has to be a business\nwhere you can be smart.  Be smart, meaning socially\ndistant.  You don’t conduct business in a way where\nyou have people within six feet.  You have to wear the\nmask.  You have to do the hand sanitizer.  That’s\nwhere we’re going to be.  \n(Id. at 146-47.) \nDuring a press conference held on June 4, 2020, when asked about\nhis reopening plans, and if there was a way to “allow high school\ngraduation ceremonies with social distancing,” Governor Cuomo remarked:\n“Did you hear anything that we’ve been talking about for the past 96\ndays? . . . [Y]eah I know everybody wants to go to a high school\ngraduation, I get it.  Not if they’re going to die.”  (Id. at 150-52.)  When\nasked how he is able to justify opening a patio for outside dining, but will\nnot allow high school graduation ceremonies with social distancing,\nGovernor Cuomo answered: “What difference does it make? . . . The issue\n11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 12 of 38\nis a public health issue and you don’t want people sick and dead. . . . It’s\nabout death, it’s about balancing the risk versus the reward, balancing the\ndesires and wants versus the consequences.”  (Id. at 151-52.)  \nDuring this same press briefing, Governor Cuomo also stated, “I want\nto thank the protestors. . . . I stand with the protestors on the point that we\nneed meaningful reform.”  (Compl. ¶ 65 (emphasis omitted).) \nWhen explaining the modification of non-essential gatherings for\nhouses of worship to no greater than 25% of the indoor capacity of such\nlocation, provided in Order 202.38, Governor Cuomo explained, in part:\n“We are going to accelerate the opening of temples, mosques, [and]\nchurches. . . . 25 percent occupancy is not as easy as 100 percent\noccupancy but 100 percent occupancy is a mass gathering and you really\ncan’t do social distancing.”  (Dkt. No. 1, Attach. 1 at 140.)  He further\nadvised New Yorkers to “[b]e smart.  It does not mean you go to a temple\nor a mosque and you sit right next to a person.  You have to socially\ndistance.”  (Id.)\n2. Mayor de Blasio\nOn April 28, Mayor de Blasio appeared in Williamsburg at a Jewish\nfuneral gathering, which was dispersed by the New York Police\n12\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 13 of 38\nDepartment (NYPD).  (Compl. ¶ 53.)  Via Twitter, Mayor de Blasio wrote:\n“Something absolutely unacceptable happened in Williamsburg tonite [sic]:\na large funeral gathering in the middle of this pandemic.  When I heard, I\nwent there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed.  And what I saw\nWILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus.”  (Dkt.\nNo. 1, Attach. 1 at 126.)  This was followed by another tweet: “My message\nto the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for\nwarnings has passed.  I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately\nto summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups.  This is about\nstopping this disease and saving lives.  Period.”  (Id. at 127.)\nDuring a June 2, 2020 media conference, when asked: “What about\nthe retail store owner facing imminent financial ruin or the religious person\nwho cannot [attend a] house of worship? What about their pain and\nanger?” Mayor de Blasio replied, in part: “When you see a nation, an entire\nnation simultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seeded in 400\nyears of American racism[,] I’m sorry[,] [t]hat is not the same question[] as\nthe understandably aggrieved store owner, or the devout religious person\nwho wants to go back to services.”  (Id. at 155-56.)\nOn June 4, 2020, Mayor de Blasio, without a mask, attended and\n13\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 14 of 38\naddressed a political gathering, held in memory of George Floyd.  (Compl.\n¶ 71.)  Neither the ten-person limit on outdoor gatherings, nor the social\ndistancing protocols, were adhered to.  (Id.)\nE. Executive Orders’ Effect on Plaintiffs\n1. Rev. Steven Soos and Rev. Nicholas Stamos\nSoos and Stamos are Catholic priests in the North Country region of\nNew York, “who offer[] Mass and provide[] the other Sacraments of the\nCatholic Church to congregations located in Glens Falls, Massena[,] and\nNicholville[, New York].”  (Id. ¶¶ 3-4, 77, 79.)  Soos and Stamos have been\nforbidden from offering Mass and the other Sacraments beyond an ever-\nchanging maximum number of people.  (Id. ¶¶ 85-96.)  Because of the\nlimitations proscribed in the executive orders, Soos and Stamos are forced\nto either turn away parishioners who wish to attend Mass—a weekly\nobligation that Catholics face “under pain of mortal sin”—or to hold more\nMasses per day than are possible.  (Id. ¶¶ 86-93.)  Likewise, the\npercentage-based capacity limit prevents Soos and Stamos from holding a\ndaily Mass for Massena students when they return to school.  (Id. ¶ 95.)  \nThe permitted “drive-in” Masses are of little help to Soos, Stamos,\nand their congregation.  (Id. ¶ 97.)  Congregants are prohibited by the\n14\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 15 of 38\nexecutive orders from leaving their vehicles at these drive-in Masses,\nwhich prevents congregants from kneeling while receiving Holy\nCommunion, as is commanded by the Catholic religion.  (Id.)  Thus, the\norders effectively “prohibit reception of Holy Communion itself—the very\nessence of the Mass—except under threat of prosecution and fines.”  (Id.) \nAnd although full outdoor masses are possible at the large churches at\nwhich Soos and Stamos hold Mass, the executive orders “make[] that\nimpossible.”  (Id. ¶ 100.)\nFinally, the executive orders burden the Catholic practices of Holy\nMatrimony and of “outdoor burial services” where Soos and Stamos are\nforced to bar a certain amount of family members and friends from\nattending a wedding or a“graveside as their loved ones are laid to rest.” \n(Id. ¶¶ 96, 101.) \n2. Daniel Schonbrun, Elchanan Perr, and Mayer Mayerfeld\nSchonbrun, Perr, and Mayerfeld are Orthodox Jewish congregants\nwho attend synagogues in Brooklyn, New York, where they reside.  (Id.\n¶¶ 5-7, 103.)  “The synagogue prayers required by their religion must have\na minimum quorum of ten adult males (age thirteen or older), called the\nminyan.”  (Id. ¶ 104.)  Because of this requirement, in conjunction with the\n15\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 16 of 38\nexecutive orders, even though Schonbrun, Perr, and/or Mayerfeld can\nattend services if they are part of this quorum, their female and non-adult\nmale family members are always prevented from attending the services. \n(Id. ¶ 108.)\nThe permittance of drive-in synagogue services is of no help to these\nplaintiffs either, because “the minyan must all be present in the same room,\nnot in various motor vehicles,” and “[m]oreover, any type of operation of a\nvehicle is prohibited on the Sabbath, which is the day the main weekly\nservices take place.”  (Id. ¶¶ 109-10.)\nSchonbrun is a congregant of Chabad of Marine Park in Brooklyn,\nwhose Rabbi decided to remain open in mid-March, notwithstanding the\nexecutive orders.  (Id. ¶¶ 117-18.)  On one occasion, the congregation was\nholding a prayer service outside when a police officer arrived and informed\nthem that they were conducting an “illegal gathering,” despite the fact that\nonly eight congregants were present, and they “were at least 20 feet apart\nfrom each other.”  (Id. ¶¶ 121-22.)  When the congregants refused to\ndisperse, the police officer threatened them with fines and arrest.  (Id. ¶\n123.)  Shortly thereafter, more police officers arrived on the scene, where\nthey remained until they were certain that all members of the congregation\n16\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 17 of 38\nhad left the area.  (Id. ¶¶ 124-26.)  \nBecause of the executive orders, and the accompanying fear of\narrest and harassment from community activists and the police for violating\nthem, “Schonbrun and his fellow congregants missed many religious\nservices, including during Passover.”  (Id. ¶ 128.)  Further, Schonbrun’s\nson has not been able to attend synagogue services for months, as he is\nnot yet old enough to be part of a minyan.  (Id. ¶ 129.)  “Schonbrun now\nlives in constant fear of police intervention in what remains of Jewish\nworship under the ten-person limit.”  (Id. ¶ 130.)\nPerr is a member of a congregation in the Flatbush-Midwood section\nof Brooklyn, where “even before ‘congregate worship’ was prohibited . . .\npolice were advising members of the Jewish community . . . that\nsynagogues must close outright.”  (Id. ¶¶ 134-35.)  Thus, Perr attended\nanother synagogue, Congregation Zichron Aryeh Leib.  (Id. ¶ 136.)  Perr\nand his fellow congregants were subject to “constant police presence and\ninterference,” which caused them to live in fear and took from them the\n“tranquility of worship.”  (Id. ¶¶ 137-39, 144.)  \nAt one point, Perr “observed that [the] synagogue had been locked\nand that there was a notice on the door from the Health Department that\n17\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 18 of 38\nthe synagogue had been closed and that no services could be conducted\nthere.”  (Id. ¶ 141.)  On that same day, the police “broke up” a Jewish\nfuneral that Perr attended, at which social distancing protocols had been\nfollowed.  (Id. ¶ 142.)  Perr was also unable to hold a Bar Mitzvah for his\nson, and his wife and children have been unable to attend synagogue\nservices since March, due to the executive orders and the aforementioned\nquorum requirement.  (Id. ¶ 148.)\nMayerfeld mainly attended two different synagogues, Shaarei Zion\nand Congregation Bnai Torah, where he and his fellow congregants were\nsubject to repeated “harassment” and surveillance by the police, allegedly\nat the behest of Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo.  (Id. ¶¶ 153-57.) \nAccordingly, Mayerfeld attempted to hold services in his own backyard. \n(Id. ¶ 158.)  However, he was subjected to harassment and “bullying” from\nhis neighbors, which he alleges was “incited by . . . [Mayor] de Blasio, who\nvowed to crack down on the Jewish community for failing to observe\n[Governor] Cuomo’s ban on religious gatherings.”  (Id. ¶¶ 159-60.)  As is\nthe case with Schonbrun and Perr, Mayerfeld’s family has been unable to\nattend synagogue services due to the executive orders’ capacity limit and\nhis religion’s quorum requirement for such services.

Procedural History\nPlaintiffs commenced this action on June 10, 2020 by filing a verified\ncomplaint and an application for a temporary restraining order by order to\nshow cause.  (Dkt. Nos. 1, 2, 7.)  The court set an expedited briefing\nschedule and a motion return via video conference.  (Dkt. No. 8.)  At the\nconclusion of the return, the court afforded the parties an opportunity to\nsupplement the record and submit additional argument, which they all did. \n(Dkt.

Discussion\nLegal challenges to executive branch responses to the COVID-19\noutbreak have been numerous in the wake of the virus.  Recently the\nSupreme Court weighed in on a California-based limitation for religious\ngatherings of “25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees.” \nS. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613\n(2020).  Chief Justice Roberts concurred in a decision to deny injunctive\nrelief, explaining:\nThe precise question of when restrictions on particular\nsocial activities should be lifted during the pandemic\nis  a  dynamic  and  fact-intensive  matter  subject  to\nreasonable  disagreement.    Our  Constitution\nprincipally entrusts “[t]he safety and the health of the\npeople” to the politically accountable officials of the\nStates  “to  guard  and  protect.”    Jacobson  v.\nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905).  When those\nofficials  “undertake[]  to  act  in  areas  fraught  with\n20\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 21 of 38\nmedical  and  scientific  uncertainties,\"  their  latitude\n\"must be especially broad.”  Marshall v. United States,\n414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974).  Where those broad limits\nare  not  exceeded,  they  should  not  be  subject  to\nsecond-guessing by an “unelected federal judiciary,”\nwhich  lacks  the  background,  competence,  and\nexpertise  to  assess  public  health  and  is  not\naccountable  to  the  people.    See  Garcia  v.  San\nAntonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528,\n545 (1985).\nNewsom, 140 S. Ct. at 1613-14.  Newsom, following the guidance of\nJacobson, instructs courts to refrain from Monday-morning quarterbacking\nthe other co-equal, elected branches of government when those branches\nare responding to difficulties beyond those that are incidental to ordinary\ngovernance.  See id.  Chief Justice Roberts recognized, however, that\nthere are “broad limits” which may not be eclipsed.  See id.  To determine\nwhether the aforementioned broad limits have been exceeded, which\nNewsom did not address, the court turns to Free Exercise Clause\njurisprudence within the framework of the applicable standard of review.\nHaving carefully reviewed the relevant issues, and with a firm\nunderstanding that the executive branch response to the pandemic has\npresented issues with a degree of complexity that is unrivaled in recent\nhistory, it is plain to this court that the broad limits of that executive latitude\n21\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 22 of 38\nhave been exceeded.  That is not to say that Governor Cuomo or Mayor de\nBlasio have utterly failed in their reaction to COVID-19.  To the contrary,\nthe State of New York, at the moment anyway, is among the best situated\nstates in terms of infection and mortality rates.  While there is more clarity\nevery day with respect to the best practices for slowing the spread of\nCOVID-19, there is wide and reasonable disagreement about exactly how\nto implement rules and regulations to achieve those ends, and, as is\nparticularly present in this case, even more so with respect to reopening in\na way that promotes safety, economic viability, and the enjoyment of all the\nrights that the people of this country and the State of New York are\nguaranteed.  As the Chief Justice recognized in Newsom, it is not the\njudiciary’s role to second guess the likes of Governor Cuomo or Mayor de\nBlasio when it comes to decisions they make in such troubling times, that\nis, until those decisions result in the curtailment of fundamental rights\nwithout compelling justification.\nA. Success on the Merits4\nIf neutral and generally applicable, laws challenged as burdening the\n4  Plaintiffs argue that each of their four causes of action is likely to succeed on the\nmerits.  (Dkt. No. 2, Attach. 4 at 6-23.)  Because each of the prongs is met with respect to\nplaintiffs’ Free Exercise Clause claim, the court need not, and does not, analyze the\nremainders.\n22\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 23 of 38\nright to freely exercise religion are presumed valid.

City of Hialeah, 508 U.S.\n520, 546 (1993) (“A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or\nnot of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.”).  \nIn addressing  the constitutional protection for free\nexercise  of  religion,  [the  Supreme  Court’s]  cases\nestablish the general proposition that a law that is\nneutral  and  of  general  applicability  need  not  be\njustified by a compelling governmental interest even\nif the law has the incidental effect of burdening a\nparticular religious practice.  Neutrality and general\napplicability are interrelated, and . . . failure to satisfy\none requirement is a likely indication that the other\nhas not been satisfied.  A law failing to satisfy these\nrequirements  must  be  justified  by  a  compelling\ngovernmental interest and must be narrowly tailored\nto advance that interest.\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 531-32 (citation omitted).\n“Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never\npermissible, if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices\nbecause of their religious motivation, the law is not neutral.”  Id. at 533\n(citations omitted).  \nTo determine the object of a law, [the court] must\nbegin with its text, for the minimum requirement of\nneutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.

Rabbinical Cong. of U.S. & Canada v. N.Y.C. Dep't\nof Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 196 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 543).  “It ‘protect[s] religious observers against\nunequal treatment, and inequality [that] results when a legislature decides\nthat the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being\npursued only against conduct with a religious motivation.’”  Id. at 196-97\n(quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542-43).  “While ‘[a]ll laws are selective to\nsome extent, . . . categories of selection are of paramount concern when a\nlaw has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice.’”  Id. at 197\n(quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542).  “A law is therefore not generally\napplicable if it is substantially underinclusive such that it regulates religious\nconduct while failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful\nto the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying it.”  Id. at 197\n(citation omitted); see Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 543.\n24\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 25 of 38\n“Individualized exemptions are [another] way in which a law can fail\nto be generally applicable.”  Douglas Laycock & Steven T. Collis, Generally\nApplicable Law and the Free Exercise of Religion, 95 Neb. L. Rev. 1, 10\n(2016).  In Smith, the Supreme Court explained that, “where the State has\nin place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that\nsystem to cases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.”  494\nU.S. at 884 (citation omitted).  Case law within this Circuit supports the\nnotion that individualized de facto exemptions can demonstrate that a\nchallenged law is not generally applicable, and is therefore subject to\nheightened scrutiny.  See Litzman v. N.Y.C. Police Dep’t, No. 12 Civ. 4681,\n2013 WL 6049066, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2013).  Along these lines,\nwhen the challenged law does not carve out an exemption on its face, the\nhistory of enforcement is relevant to the existence of an exemption.  See\nStormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 854 F. Supp. 2d 925, 956-57 (W.D. Wash.\n2012), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794\nF.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 2433 (2016).\nPlaintiffs argue that the limitations and restrictions placed on them by\nthe executive orders and the Guidance Document (hereinafter collectively\nreferred to as “challenged laws”) are not neutral or generally applicable,\n25\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 26 of 38\nand, therefore, strict scrutiny applies.  (Dkt. No. 2, Attach. 4 at 8.)  More\nspecifically, they assert that the challenged laws are not generally\napplicable because they are “substantially underinclusive—that is [they]\n‘fail[] to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endangers [the government’s\ninterests] in a similar or greater degree than [the prohibited religious\nactivity] does.’”  (Id. at 9 (citations omitted).)  Plaintiffs further claim that\nmass race protests have been granted “an individualized exemption” and\nthat “the government may not refuse to extend that system to cases of\nreligious hardship without compelling reason.”  (Id. at 9-10 (citation\nomitted).)  That outdoor graduation ceremonies of 150 people or less or\nindoor special education services at summer schools without limitation are\nallowed also shows the unequal treatment and disfavoring of religion in\nplaintiffs’ view.  (Dkt. No. 32 at 9.)\nFinally, plaintiffs assert that the challenged laws fail strict scrutiny\neven though general efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are\n“compelling interests of the highest order” because defendants cannot\nshow that their interest in applying the restrictions to these plaintiffs, who\nabide by all social distancing and hygiene rules, is compelling.  (Dkt. No. 2,\nAttach. 4 at 16-17.)\n26\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 27 of 38\nThe State argues, in overly-simplistic fashion, that the challenged\nlaws only incidentally impose a burden on religious exercise, and they are\nneutral and generally applicable, and therefore, only rational basis need be\nshown, which is self-evident: preventing the spread of COVID-19.  (Dkt.\nNo. 18 at 11-12.)  The State was silent with respect to the mass race\nprotests in its written submissions until it filed a supplemental\nmemorandum of law following the return on the motion.  (Dkt. No. 33,\nAttach. 4.)5  In that supplement, the State argues that Governor Cuomo’s\n“political speech” cannot support a de facto exemption vis-à-vis the mass\nrace protests.  (Id. at 5.)\nThe City initially responded with respect to only the ten-person\nindoor/outdoor limitation that was applicable in New York City during Phase\n1.  (Dkt. No. 19, Attach. 7 at 2.)  It argues, like the State, that the\nchallenged laws are neutral and generally applicable, but, unlike the State,\nthe City initially acknowledged the mass race protests and contended that\n5  The State argues, for the first time and in a submission to which plaintiffs have had\nno opportunity to respond, that, Governor Cuomo enjoys absolute legislative immunity and, in\nan argument much more fully developed than in its original papers, that, because of sovereign\nimmunity, he and Attorney General James are not proper defendants.  (Dkt. No. 33, Attach. 4\nat 7-10.)  Because it was not raised in time for plaintiffs to offer any response to it, the court will\nnot consider the legislative immunity argument at this juncture.  The same is true of the new\nsovereign immunity argument.  The State is, of course, free to raise those arguments later in\nthe litigation.\n27\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 28 of 38\nthey are not comparable because protests occur outside and religious\nactivity typically occurs inside.  (Dkt. No. 19, Attach. 7 at 7, note 4.)  Further\nthe City asserts, relying on Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak, 2020\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 103234 (D. Nev. June 11, 2020), that the enforcement of\nthe challenged laws against protesters creates safety concerns and, absent\nclear patterns of unconstitutional selective enforcement, the court should\nnot second guess the State’s determinations.  (Id. at 8.)  In its\nsupplemental submission, the City contends that the orthodox Jewish\nplaintiffs “may no longer seek redress for their alleged injuries” because, as\nof June 22, New York City has entered Phase 2, which lifts the ten-person\nindoor/outdoor limitation and imposes a 25% indoor capacity limitation. \n(Dkt. No. 31, Attach. 6 at 1-2).  The City also amplifies its contention,\nexplained for the first time during the motion return, that a de facto\nexemption has not been created for mass race protesters.  (Id. at 3-6.)\nIn light of the developments and natural progression of the\nchallenged laws since the motion return, the restrictions and limitations at\nissue are: (1) a 25% indoor capacity limitation for Phases 2 and 3; (2) a\ntwenty-five-person outdoor gathering limit in Phase 3 locations; and (3) a\nten-person outdoor gathering limit in Phase 1 and 2 locations.  And the\n28\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 29 of 38\nCity’s argument that Schonbrun, Perr, and Mayerfeld “may no longer seek\nredress” because their region has gone into Phase 2, (Dkt. No. 31, Attach.\n6 at 1-2), is rejected.  While it is true that their allegations are tailored to the\nten-person indoor/outdoor limitation that existed when this matter was\ncommenced, it is readily and reasonably inferable from their allegations\nthat the 25% indoor capacity limitation would continue to burden their free\nexercise of religion.\nAssuming, without deciding, that the challenged laws are neutral,\nplaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits with\nrespect to their free exercise claim because it appears that the challenged\nlaws are not generally applicable, and that they would fail strict scrutiny.\n1. 25% Indoor Capacity Limitation\nOn its face, the 25% indoor capacity limitation applies only to houses\nof worship.  See N.Y. Executive Order No. 202.38.  Indeed, that limitation is\nthe only one of its kind in the tangle of executive orders and the Guidance\nDocument that have been issued in response to the pandemic; in other\nwords, no other secular entity, save for those that remain closed in their\nentirety until Phase 4 or beyond, are limited to only 25% capacity.  The\n“nonessential businesses,” dubbed “Phase 2 industries” by executive order,\n29\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 30 of 38\nthat enjoy a 50% capacity limitation are, however, not justifiably different\nthan houses of worship.  (Dkt. No. 32, Attach. 1 ¶ 18.)\nFor example, offices, retail stores that are not inside of shopping\nmalls, and salons were permitted to open at 50% capacity beginning in\nPhase 2.  To a greater or lesser degree, the Phase 2 industries involve the\ncongregation of people for a length of time.  And restaurants in Phase 3\nlocations are permitted to open at 50% capacity indoors.  Restaurant\npatrons sit and congregate with family and friends in close proximity for a\nlengthy period of time, and have close contact with their hosts and servers. \nFace coverings may be removed while seated.  (Dkt. No. 32, Attach. 6 at\n1.)  Additionally, special educational services will be permitted during “the\nsummer term in school districts” with no indoor capacity limitations.\nAll of this is to demonstrate that these secular businesses/activities\nthreaten defendants’ interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 to a\nsimilar or greater degree than those of plaintiffs’, and demonstrate that the\n25% indoor capacity limitation on houses of worship is underinclusive and\ntriggers strict scrutiny review.6\n6  There is also an arguable basis to find a de facto exemption in light of the open\nlobbies social media campaign.  In light of the court’s conclusion that the 25% indoor capacity\nlimitation is not generally applicable because it is underinclusive, it need not reach the\nindividualized exemption argument.  Admittedly, the basis of such an argument here is on far\n30\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 31 of 38\n2. Twenty-Five-Person Outdoor Limitation in Phase 3; Ten-Person\nOutdoor Limitation in Phases 1 and 2\nDespite the State’s claim that enforcement power rests with local\nauthorities in an effort to show that selective enforcement against mass\nrace protesters is not a de facto exemption imposed by Governor Cuomo\nor Attorney General James, (Dkt. No. 33, Attach. 4 at 5-7), Governor\nCuomo clearly has authority over the New York State Police and broad\npowers of enforcement, see N.Y. Exec. Law § 223 (explaining that the\nsuperintendent of state police and its members “shall . . . be subject to the\ncall of the governor and are empowered to co-operate with any other\ndepartment of the state or with local authorities”).  And, in any case,\nGovernor Cuomo’s comments, which applauded and encouraged\nprotesting and discouraged others from violating the outdoor limitations,\nlikely demonstrate the creation of a de facto exemption.\nMayor de Blasio is a “local authority” with clear enforcement power\nand has at his disposal one of the largest municipal police departments in\nthe world, (Dkt. No. 1, Attach. 1 at 127), and has also actively encouraged\nshakier footing, given the lack of acknowledgment or endorsement by defendants, than it is\nwith respect to the mass race protests discussed below.\n31\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 32 of 38\nparticipation in protests and openly discouraged religious gatherings and\nthreatened religious worshipers as set forth above.  The City’s argument\nthat temporary selective enforcement of the challenged laws with respect to\nmass race protests is a matter of public safety based on the rationale of\nSisolak, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103234, would perhaps be legitimate but for\nMayor de Blasio’s simultaneous pro-protest/anti-religious gathering\nmessages, which clearly undermine the legitimacy of the proffered reason\nfor what seems to be a clear exemption, no matter the reason.  Governor\nCuomo and Mayor de Blasio could have just as easily discouraged\nprotests, short of condemning their message, in the name of public health\nand exercised discretion to suspend enforcement for public safety reasons\ninstead of encouraging what they knew was a flagrant disregard of the\noutdoor limits and social distancing rules.  They could have also been\nsilent.  But by acting as they did, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio\nsent a clear message that mass protests are deserving of preferential\ntreatment.\nAnother case of individualized exemption seems even more obvious. \nThe State has specifically authorized outdoor, in-person graduation\nceremonies of no more than 150 people beginning today, June 26.  This is\n32\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 33 of 38\nan express exemption from the ten- or twenty-five-person outdoor limits\nthat apply across Phases 1, 2, and 3, and the State must extend a similar\nexemption to plaintiffs absent a compelling reason to the contrary.  See\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 884.  And there is nothing materially different about a\ngraduation ceremony and a religious gathering such that defendants’\njustifications for a difference in treatment can be found compelling.\n3. Strict Scrutiny\nFor the reasons articulated in plaintiffs’ memorandum of law,\ndefendants’ generally-stated compelling interest in controlling the spread of\nCOVID-19 is inadequate to demonstrate that they have a compelling\ninterest that is narrowly tailored to these specific plaintiffs.  (Dkt. No. 2,\nAttach. 4 at 16-18.)  The City’s attempt to demonstrate otherwise is\nunavailing, (Dkt. No. 31, Attach. 6 at 5-6); and the State has made no\nattempt to do so.\nB. Irreparable Harm, Balance of Hardships, and Public Interest\nPlaintiffs contend that the fear of threatened arrest, prosecution and\nfines demonstrate the irreparable harm necessary to support the second\nprong of the preliminary injunction standard, and that the deprivation of\nFirst Amendment rights is presumed to amount to irreparably injury.  (Dkt.\n33\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 34 of 38\nNo. 2, Attach. 4 at 23-24.)  The State contends that, because plaintiffs are\nnot being prevented from exercising their religious rights, and, instead, are\nonly being required to do so in a different way, the presumption of\nirreparable harm does not apply.  (Dkt. No. 18 at 23-24.)  The City appears\nto concede that First Amendment violations are sufficient to demonstrate\nirreparable injuries for the purpose of a preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. No. 19,\nAttach. 7 at 1.)\nAs noted by plaintiffs and the City, the loss of plaintiffs’ free exercise\nrights is alone adequate to demonstrate irreparable injury here.  See Elrod\nv. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976); Bery v. City of New York, 97 F.3d 689,\n693 (2d Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1251 (1997).  Accordingly,\nplaintiffs have met their burden in this regard.\nPlaintiffs have also satisfied the court with respect to the final two\nprongs.  (Dkt. No. 2, Attach. 4 at 24-25.)  The balance of hardships tips in\nplaintiffs’ favor.  Indeed, in the absence of an injunction, plaintiffs’ religious\nactivities will be burdened and continue to be treated less favorably than\ncomparable secular activities.  An injunction, on the other hand, does not\nundercut defendants’ interest in controlling the spread of COVID-19,\nprovided that plaintiffs abide by social distancing guidance.\n34\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 35 of 38\n“As for the public interest, treatment of similarly situated entities in\ncomparable ways serves public health interests at the same time it\npreserves bedrock free-exercise guarantees.”  Roberts v. Neace, 958 F.3d\n409, 416 (6th Cir. 2020); see N.Y. Progress & Prot. PAC v. Walsh, 733\nF.3d 483, 488 (2d Cir. 2013).\nC. Appropriate Remedy\n“District courts have broad authority in crafting equitable remedies\nsuch as injunctions.”  Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy For Persons With\nDisabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 464 F.3d 229, 245 (2d Cir. 2006)\n(citations omitted).  For the reasons explained above, appropriate injunctive\nrelief here is a restraint on defendants from enforcement of any indoor\ngathering limitations against plaintiffs greater than imposed for Phase 2\nindustries and restraint from enforcement of any limitation for outdoor\ngatherings against plaintiffs.  However, the court is unpersuaded that\ndefendants should be enjoined from the enforcement of the social\ndistancing rules as set forth in the challenges laws.  The court dispenses\nwith the security requirement of Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.  See Complete Angler, LLC v. City of Clearwater, Fla., 607 F.\nSupp. 2d 1326, 1335 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (“Waiving the bond requirement is\n35\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 35   Filed 06/26/20   Page 36 of 38\nparticularly appropriate where a plaintiff alleges the infringement of a\nfundamental constitutional right.” (citations omitted)).\nD.

(See generally id.)\nFor the reasons explained below, plaintiffs’ motion is denied.\nII.  Background\nA. Facts1\nWhile New York has had much success with the global pandemic\nbrought about by COVID-19, and daily deaths and hospitalizations\nattributed to COVID-19 have remained essentially stagnant since June, it is\nstill with us, and, thus, remains a difficult and overarching issue facing\ndefendants.  Since early September 2020, the New York State Department\n1  For a full recitation of the underlying facts, the parties are referred to the court’s June\n26, 2020 Memorandum-Decision and Order.  (Dkt. No. 35.)\n3\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 4 of 20\nof Health (DOH) has observed twenty “hot spots” of positive tests for\nCOVID-19, located in Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland County, Broome\nCounty, and Orange County.  (Declaration of Zucker (hereinafter “Zucker\nDecl.”) ¶ 95, Dkt. No. 91, Attach. 2.)  Indeed, while the rate of positive tests\nin the rest of the state has been hovering around just 1%, the positivity\nrates in these hot spots are at least 5.5%.  See Luis Ferré-Sadurní & Jesse\nMcKinley, Cuomo Imposes Tight Virus Rules on Areas Hit by Spikes\nAcross State, N.Y. Times (October 6, 2020),\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/nyregion/cuomo-shutdown-coronaviru\ns.html.  And, in certain areas within those hot spots, the positivity rates\nhave reached 8%.  (Zucker Decl. ¶ 96.)\nIn response to these apparent increases in COVID-19 cases,\nGovernor Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.68, which establishes the\nso-called “Cluster Action Initiative.”  (Dkt. No. 57 at 64-72.)  The Initiative\ndirects the DOH to “determine areas in the State that require enhanced\npublic health restrictions based upon cluster-based cases of COVID-19”\nand to divide those areas into “red zones”, “orange zones”, and “yellow\nzones”, in accordance with the severity of the outbreak.  (Id. at 64.)\nIn red zones, the zones with the most severe outbreak:\n4\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 5 of 20\nNon-essential  gatherings  of  any  size  shall  be\npostponed or cancelled; all non-essential businesses,\nas  determined  by  the  Empire  State  Development\nCorporation based upon published guidance, shall\nreduce  in-person  workforce  by  100%;  houses  of\nworship shall be subject to a capacity limit of 25% of\nmaximum  occupancy  or  10  people,  whichever  is\nfewer; any restaurant or tavern shall cease serving\npatrons food or beverage on-premises and may be\nopen  for  takeout  or  delivery  only;  and  the  local\nDepartment  of  Health  shall  direct  closure  of  all\nschools for in-person instruction, except as otherwise\nprovided in Executive Order.\n(Id. at 65.)\nIn “moderate severity warning” zones, the orange zones: \nNon-essential  gatherings  shall  be  limited  to  10\npeople; certain non-essential businesses, for which\nthere is a higher risk associated with the transmission\nof the COVID-19 virus, including gyms, fitness centers\nor  classes,  barbers,  hair  salons,  spas,  tattoo  or\npiercing  parlors,  nail  technicians  and  nail  salons,\ncosmetologists, estheticians, the provision of laser\nhair removal and electrolysis, and all other personal\ncare services shall reduce in-person workforce by\n100%;  houses  of  worship  shall  be  subject  to  a\nmaximum  capacity  limit  of  the  lesser  of  33%  of\nmaximum  occupancy  or  25  people,  whichever  is\nfewer; any restaurant or tavern shall cease serving\npatrons food or beverage inside on-premises but may\nprovide outdoor service, and may be open for takeout\nor delivery, provided however, any one seated group\nor party shall not exceed  4 people;  and the local\nDepartment  of  Health  shall  direct  closure  of  all\nschools for in-person instruction, except as otherwise\n5\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 6 of 20\nprovided in Executive Order.\n(Id.)\nFinally, in “precautionary” areas, the yellow zones:\nNon-essential gatherings shall be limited to no more\nthan 25 people; houses of worship shall be subject to\na capacity limit of 50% of its maximum occupancy and\nshall adhere to Department of Health guidance; any\nrestaurant or tavern must limit any one seated group\nor  party  size  to  4 people;  and  the  Department  of\nHealth  shall  issue  guidance  by  October  9,  2020\nregarding mandatory testing of students and school\npersonnel,  and  schools  shall  adhere  to  such\nguidance. \n(Id.)\nThe purpose of the Initiative, according to Governor Cuomo, is to\napply a “science-based approach to attack . . . clusters [of positive tests]\nand stop any further spread of the virus . . . [by] directly target[ing] . . .\nareas with the highest concentration of COVID[-19] cases.”  (Id. at 66.) \nState Defendants assert that the Initiative “effectively mitigates the risk of\ninfection and reduces transmission by breaking up identified clusters,\nthereby reducing density in places where people gather, including houses\nof worship.”  (Dkt. No. 91, Attach. 4 at 8.)\nGovernor Cuomo made clear that he had houses of worship in mind\n6\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 7 of 20\nwhen creating the Initiative.  See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn,\nNew York v. Cuomo, No. 20-cv-4844, 2020 WL 5994954, at *1 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. 9, 2020) (“[Governor Cuomo] made remarkably clear that [the\nInitiative] was intended to target a different set of religious institutions.”\n(citing “Governor Cuomo Is a Guest on CNN Newsroom with Poppy Harlow\nand Jimmy Sciutto,” October 9, 2020, https://www.governor.ny.\ngov/news/audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-guest-cnn-newsroom-pop\npy-harlow-and-jim-sciutto)).  At the press conference to announce the\nInitiative, Governor Cuomo said that “the new rules are most impactful on\nhouses of worship” and that the Initiative “is about mass gatherings,” and\n“[o]ne of the prime places of mass gatherings are houses of worship.”  (Am.\nCompl. ¶ 86 (emphasis omitted).)  And, during an earlier press conference,\nGovernor Cuomo stated: “We know religious institutions have been a\nproblem.  We know mass gatherings are the super spreader events.  We\nknow there have been mass gatherings going on in concert with religious\ninstitutions in these communities for weeks.”  (Id. ¶ 88.)   \nPlaintiffs assert that there is no evidence that “Orthodox Jewish or\nother religious gatherings or any religious school posed a particular threat\nto public health in terms of undefined ‘clusters,’ and no evidence that even\n7\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 8 of 20\na single hospitalization or death in [the] ‘Red Zone’ had occurred because\nof religious gatherings as opposed to other gatherings.”  (Id. ¶ 89.)  In\nplaintiffs’ view, the zones were “gerrymander[ed]” specifically to target the\nOrthodox Jewish community.  (Id. ¶ 160.)\nSoos and Stamos are Catholic priests in the North Country region of\nNew York, (id. ¶¶ 13-14), and, thus, not currently subject to the Initiative. \nHowever, plaintiffs contend that, because the zones are ever-changing,\nthey could find themselves residing in one of them in the near future.  (Id.\n¶¶ 104-05.)  G.L., P.L., Schonbrun, Perr, Mayerfeld, and Avigdor all reside\nand worship in the red zone.  (Id. ¶¶ 5, 75.) \nG.L. and P.L. are Catholics who attend Catholic school and mass in\nBrooklyn, where they reside with their parents.  (Id. ¶ 15).  Plaintiffs allege\nthat, because it is in the red zone, their Catholic school is closed despite\nfollowing State protocols and having zero positive tests.  (Id. ¶¶ 118-20.)\nSchonbrun, Perr, Mayerfeld, and Avigdor are Orthodox Jewish\ncongregants who attend synagogues in Brooklyn, New York, where they\nreside.  (Id. ¶¶ 16-19.)  Avigdor is the President of Congregation Ahavas\nDovid, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Brooklyn.  (Id. ¶ 19.)  The\nsynagogue prayers required by their religion must have a minimum quorum\n8\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 9 of 20\nof ten adult males, called the “minyan.”  (Id. ¶ 130.)  Because of this\nrequirement, in conjunction with the fact that they reside and worship in the\nred zone, Schonbrun, Perr, Mayerfeld, and/or Avigdor can only attend\nservices if they are part of the minyan, and their female and non-adult male\nfamily members are always prevented from attending such services.  (Id. ¶\n153.)  Further, Mayerfeld, Schonbrun, and Perr have children who attend\nJewish schools in the red zone, which have been ordered closed pursuant\nto the Initiative.  (Id. ¶¶ 156-59.) \nB. Procedural History\nPlaintiffs commenced this action on June 10, 2020 by filing a verified\ncomplaint and an application for a TRO by order to show cause.  (Dkt. Nos.\n1, 2, 7.)  The court set an expedited briefing schedule and motion return via\nvideo conference.  (Dkt. No. 8.)  Shortly after the video conference, the\ncourt issued a Memorandum-Decision and Order, granting plaintiffs’ motion\nand enjoining and restraining defendants Governor Cuomo, Mayor de\nBlasio, and Attorney General James: (1) from enforcing any indoor\ngathering limitations against plaintiffs greater than imposed for Phase Two\n9\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 10 of 20\nindustries,2 provided that plaintiffs follow social distancing requirements as\nset forth in the applicable executive orders and guidance; and (2) from\nenforcing any limitation for outdoor gatherings provided that participants in\nsuch gatherings follow social distancing requirements as set forth in the\napplicable executive orders and guidance.  (Dkt. No. 35 at 37-38.)  \nPlaintiffs then amended their complaint, adding new plaintiffs and\ndefendants, as well as allegations with respect to school closures and\nstudent testing requirements brought about by the Initiative.  (See generally\nAm. Compl.)  On the same day, plaintiffs also moved for injunctive relief,\n(Dkt. No. 58), which the court denied with leave to renew due to plaintiffs’\nfailure to properly serve the new defendants, (Dkt. No. 59).  \nPlaintiffs allege four enumerated causes of action: (1) a violation of\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983; (2) a violation of the First Amendment rights of speech, assembly,\nand expressive association pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (3) a violation of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983; and (4) “Ultra Vires State Action in Violation of Federal and\n2  Phase Two industries included: professional services, administrative support, and\ninformation technology; real estate services, building and property management, leasing,\nrental, and sales services; retail in-store shopping, rental, repair, and cleaning; barbershops\nand hair salons; and motor vehicle leasing, rental, and sales.  (Dkt. No. 1, Attach. 1 at 77-78.)\n10\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 11 of 20\nState Constitutional Rights.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 167-216.)\nNow pending is plaintiffs’ third motion for a TRO, or, alternatively,\npreliminary injunction.  (Dkt. No. 69.)  The court, again, set an expedited\nbriefing schedule, (Dkt. No. 76), and held a status conference.  At the\nstatus conference, the parties were permitted to augment their arguments,\nbut agreed that neither a factual hearing, nor additional submissions were\nnecessary, and, thus, the factual record was fixed at that time.\nIII.  Standard of Review\nIn general, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show: \n(1)  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  or  .  .  .\nsufficiently serious questions going to the merits to\nmake them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of\nhardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff’s favor; (2)\na likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of an\ninjunction; (3) that the balance of hardships tips in the\nplaintiff[s]’[]  favor;  and  (4)  that  the  public  interest\nwould  not  be  disserved  by  the  issuance  of  an\ninjunction.\nBenihana, Inc. v. Benihana of Tokyo, LLC, 784 F.3d 887, 895 (2d Cir.\n2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nIV.  Discussion\nLegal challenges to executive branch responses to the COVID-19\noutbreak have been numerous and widespread, even reaching the United\n11\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 12 of 20\nStates Supreme Court.  Chief Justice Roberts concurred in a decision to\ndeny injunctive relief with respect to a California-based limitation for\nreligious gatherings, explaining:\nThe precise question of when restrictions on particular\nsocial activities should be lifted during the pandemic\nis  a  dynamic  and  fact-intensive  matter  subject  to\nreasonable  disagreement.    Our  Constitution\nprincipally entrusts “[t]he safety and the health of the\npeople” to the politically accountable officials of the\nStates  “to  guard  and  protect.”    Jacobson  v.\nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49\nL.Ed. 643 (1905).  When those officials “undertake[ ]\nto act in areas fraught with medical and scientific\nuncertainties,”  their  latitude  “must  be  especially\nbroad.”  Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427,\n94 S.Ct. 700, 38 L.Ed.2d 618 (1974).  Where those\nbroad limits are not exceeded, they should not be\nsubject to second-guessing by an “unelected federal\njudiciary,” which lacks the background, competence,\nand  expertise  to  assess  public  health  and  is  not\naccountable  to  the  people.    See  Garcia  v.  San\nAntonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528,\n545, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985). \nS. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613-14\n(2020).  Newsom, following the guidance of Jacobson, instructs courts to\nrefrain from Monday-morning quarterbacking the other co-equal, elected\nbranches of government when those branches are responding to difficulties\nbeyond those that are incidental to ordinary governance.  See id.  Chief\n12\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 13 of 20\nJustice Roberts recognized, however, that there are “broad limits” which\nmay not be eclipsed.  See id.  To determine whether the broad limits have\nbeen exceeded, which Newsom did not address, the court turns to Free\nExercise Clause jurisprudence3 within the framework of the applicable\nstandard of review.\nThe First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.”  U.S. Const. Amend. I.  If neutral and generally applicable, laws\nchallenged as burdening the right to freely exercise religion are presumed\nvalid and subject to rational basis review; otherwise, such laws are subject\nto strict scrutiny.  See Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Oregon v.\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990); see also Church of the Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993) (“A law burdening\nreligious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must\nundergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.”).\nIn addressing  the constitutional  protection for free\nexercise  of  religion,  [the  Supreme  Court’s]  cases\nestablish the general proposition that a law that is\nneutral  and  of  general  applicability  need  not  be\n3  While this Memorandum-Decision and Order focuses on plaintiffs’ free exercise claim,\nJacobson and its progeny applies in equal force to all of plaintiffs’ claims, which are unlikely to\nsucceed on the merits, see infra. \n13\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 14 of 20\njustified by a compelling governmental interest even\nif the law has the incidental effect of burdening a\nparticular religious practice.  Neutrality and general\napplicability are interrelated, and . . .  failure to satisfy\none requirement is a likely indication that the other\nhas not been satisfied.  A law failing to satisfy these\nrequirements  must  be  justified  by  a  compelling\ngovernmental interest and must be narrowly tailored\nto advance that interest.\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 531-32 (citation omitted).\n“Although a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never\npermissible, if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices\nbecause of their religious motivation, the law is not neutral.”  Id. at 533\n(citations omitted).  “To determine the object of a law, [the court] must\nbegin with its text, for the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law\nnot discriminate on its face.  A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a\nreligious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language\nor context.”  Id.\n“The general applicability requirement prohibits the government from\n‘in a selective manner impos[ing] burdens only on conduct motivated by\nreligious belief.’”  Cent. Rabbinical Cong. of U.S. & Canada v. N.Y.C. Dep’t\nof Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 196 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting\nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 543).  “It ‘protect[s] religious observers against\n14\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 15 of 20\nunequal treatment, and inequality [that] results when a legislature decides\nthat the governmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being\npursued only against conduct with a religious motivation.’”  Id. at 196-97\n(quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542-43).  “While ‘[a]ll laws are selective to\nsome extent, . . . categories of selection are of paramount concern when a\nlaw has the incidental effect of burdening religious practice.’”  Id. at 197\n(quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542).  “A law is therefore not generally\napplicable if it is substantially underinclusive such that it regulates religious\nconduct while failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful\nto the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying it.”  Id. at 197\n(citing Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 535-38).\n“Individualized exemptions are [another] way in which a law can fail\nto be generally applicable.”  Douglas Laycock & Steven T. Collis, Generally\nApplicable Law and the Free Exercise of Religion, 95 Neb. L. Rev. 1, 10\n(2016).  In Smith, the Supreme Court explained that, “where the State has\nin place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that\nsystem to cases of ‘religious hardship’ without compelling reason.”  Smith,\n494 U.S. at 884 (citation omitted).\nPlaintiffs argue that strict scrutiny applies because the Initiative, on its\n15\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 16 of 20\nface, targets religion and excludes “essential” businesses, and that the\nInitiative does not pass strict scrutiny because it is “substantially under-\ninclusive” and there is no evidence that religious gatherings pose a\nuniquely big risk to the spread of COVID-19.  (Dkt. No. 69 at 8-22.)  In\nresponse, defendants contend that rational basis applies because the\nInitiative regulates all gatherings and businesses in the hot spots, and it\ntreats religious services and gatherings more favorably than their\ncomparators.  (Dkt. No. 88 at 11-20; Dkt. No. 91, Attach. 4 at 17-23.) \nDefendants further assert that, even if strict scrutiny applies, plaintiffs are\nunlikely to succeed on the merits because the Initiative is narrowly tailored\nto advance the compelling government interest of stopping the spread of\nCOVID-19 and preventing another outbreak.  (Dkt. No. 88 at 20-21; Dkt.\nNo. 91, Attach. 4 at 23-26.)\nWhether rational basis or strict scrutiny review applies here is of no\nconsequence, though, because, as explained below, plaintiffs’ claims are\nunlikely to succeed under Jacobson and its progeny, pursuant to either\nstandard of review.  See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York v.\nCuomo, No. 20-CV-4844, 2020 WL 6120167, at *8-11 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 16,\n2020) (denying a motion for a preliminary injunction precluding\n16\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 17 of 20\nenforcement of the Initiative, and noting that the motion would be denied\napplying either standard of review). \nThe free exercise of religion is a foundational principle of this country,\nand one of the oldest and most important rights all Americans enjoy. \nConsequently, governments ought to be especially careful when restricting\nreligious practice.  But whether the court agrees or disagrees with the\nInitiative, or that the underlying data and science necessitates a\nreinstatement of gathering restrictions, is not the fundamental question;\nrather, it is whether the Initiative exceeds the broad deference afforded to\nthe elected branches of government to manage the spread of deadly\ndiseases under Jacobson and Newsom.  The court is not convinced that it\ndoes.\nThe Initiative and the surrounding circumstances do not present the\nissues that existed in June when the court granted plaintiffs’ request for a\npreliminary injunction.  (See generally Dkt. No. 35.)  Under the Initiative,\nreligious gatherings are treated more favorably than their comparators,\nwhich “the State identifies [as] gatherings (1) with scheduled starting and\nending times, such as public lectures, concerts, or theatrical performances,\nor (2) that involve people remaining in close proximity, greeting each other\n17\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 18 of 20\nor singing or chanting.”  (Dkt. No. 91, Attach. 4 at 23 (citing Zucker Decl. ¶¶\n93-94)); see also Newsom, 140 S. Ct. at 1613 (holding that worship\nservices are comparable to “lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator\nsports, and theatrical performances, where large groups of people gather in\nclose proximity for extended periods of time”).\nIn the red zone, while non-essential gatherings are prohibited,\nnon-essential businesses have to reduce their in-person workforce by\n100%, and restaurants can only offer takeout and delivery service, houses\nof worship can remain open at up to 25% capacity, or ten people,\nwhichever is fewer.  (Dkt. No. 57 at 65.)  In the orange zone, while\nnon-essential gatherings are limited to ten people and certain non-essential\nbusinesses must reduce their in-person workforce by 100%, houses of\nworship can remain open at up to 33% capacity, or twenty-five people,\nwhichever is fewer.  (Id.)  Finally, in the yellow zone, while non-essential\ngatherings are limited to twenty-five people or fewer, houses of worship\ncan remain open at up to 50% capacity.  (Id.)\nTo find in plaintiffs’ favor under these circumstances would be to\nsecond-guess the State’s medical experts and scientific and public health\nfindings with respect to what constitutes an “essential” business, which\n18\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 19 of 20\nwould run afoul of Jacobson and its progeny.  See Cuomo, 2020 WL\n6120167, at *9.  Indeed, the State has arguably shown that, according to\ntheir medical and public health experts, religious gatherings pose a unique\nrisk to the spread of COVID-19, and, thus, “although the [Initiative]\nestablishes rules specific to religious gatherings, it does so because they\nare gatherings, not because they are religious.”  Id.  According to Zucker,\nthe State looks “solely at the data and do[es] not take into account who or\nwhat are located in th[e] zone[s]—whether it is a non-essential business,\nschool (religious or otherwise), yeshiva, church, synagogue, or a car\ndealership.”  (Zucker Decl. ¶ 119.)\nAccordingly, for purposes of the pending motion, the court is satisfied\nthat the Initiative was guided by science and data, and not a mere desire to\ntarget religion, and thus, the Initiative does not exceed the “broad limits”\ndescribed in Newsom.  Additionally, plaintiffs’ claims are unlikely to\nsucceed on the merits even applying strict scrutiny review because the\ninjunction is not in the public interest.  See Cuomo, 2020 WL 6120167, at\n*11 (“[I]f [the Initiative] is improperly enjoined, the enormity of the potential\nharm to the entire public, including to [the plaintiffs], is overwhelming.  In\nlight of that danger, it would not be in the public interest to do so.”); see\n19\n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 96   Filed 10/30/20   Page 20 of 20\nalso Salinger v. Colting, 607 F.3d 68, 80 (2d Cir. 2010) (“[T]he court must\nensure that the public interest would not be disserved by the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nThe court therefore agrees with defendants, (Dkt. No. 88 at 6-25; Dkt.\nNo. 91, Attach. 4 at 10-28), in that plaintiffs have not shown that their\nclaims are likely to succeed on the merits, or that the public interest would\nnot be disserved by the issuance of an injunction, and plaintiffs’ motion\nmust be denied.\nV.  Conclusion\nWHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\nORDERED that plaintiffs’ application for a TRO or preliminary\ninjunction (Dkt. No. 69) is DENIED; and it is further \nORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this Memorandum-\nDecision and Order to the parties.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nOctober 30, 2020\nAlbany, New York\n20",

This First Amended Complaint adds new parties and further claims in this civil rights\naction, which challenges a series of executive orders issued by defendant Governor Andrew M. \nCuomo (Cuomo) in an unprecedented and continuing abuse of power, premised on his original \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 2 of 153\ndeclaration of a “disaster emergency” in Executive Order 202 issued seven months ago, on March \n7, 2020, under the purported authority of § 28 of Article 2B of the New York Executive Law. \n2.  This  Amended  Complaint  adds  claims  concerning  Cuomo’s  “Cluster  Action \nInitiative”  (CAI),  which  he  announced  less  than  96  hours  ago,  on  October  5,  2020,  and \npromulgated 72 hours ago, on October 6, 2020 via Executive Order 202.68.  Ex. 1-1. \n3. Although, as shown below, deaths and hospitalizations attributed to COVID-19 peaked \nin April and declined to statistical zero months ago, eliminating any objective medical or scientific \nbasis for a continuing “disaster emergency,” EO 202.68 now decrees that the entire State of New \nYork is to be divided into Red, Orange and Yellow “zones” based on nothing more than a handful \nof  positive  COVID-19  test  results  of  dubious  validity,  involving  people  who  are  largely \nasymptomatic and may not even know they have the virus or some remnant of it in their systems \nbut are now misleadingly called “cases” of COVID-19. \n4.  As pleaded more particularly below, in Cuomo’s new “Red Zone,” based on a few \npositive COVID-19 tests of random people who made the mistake of cooperating with Cuomo’s \ntesting regime, churches and synagogues are limited to merely ten people indoors, while religious \nschools are closed entirely. Also entirely banned are “non-essential” outdoor religious gatherings \nunder threat of a $15,000 fine for anyone who organizes, promotes or even encourages such \ngatherings. In the Red Zone churches, synagogues, and religious schools are banned as “non-\nessential” gatherings, while in the Orange Zone religious schools are still banned and houses of \nworship are subject to onerous new restrictions on their operation. \n5. Infant plaintiffs G.L and P.L., Schonbrun, Perr, Mayerfeld and Avigdor all reside, \nworship and educate their children in Cuomo’s “Red Zone” as established in Brooklyn based on a \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 3 of 153\nhandful of  positive COVID-19 tests called “cases” of the virus that supposedly constitute “hot \nspots.” \n6.  Plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr, Mayerfeld and Avigdor are thus now deprived of Orthodox \nJewish worship in their synagogues in the midst of the Holiday of Sukkot, one of the most \nimportant Jewish festivals, which began this year on Friday evening October 2nd and ends on \nSunday night, October 11, as well as Jewish religious worship and education for their children in \nJewish schools. \n7.  Infant plaintiffs P.L and G.L. are thus now deprived of Catholic worship in their church \nand Catholic worship and education in the appurtenant Catholic school. \n8.   Plaintiffs Soos and Stamos, while not yet located in one of Cuomo’s new “zones,” \ncould be assigned to one at any moment and be subjected to new restrictions on their constitutional \nrights. \n9.   Plaintiffs seek emergent injunctive relief by way of a temporary restraining order, \nfollowed by a preliminary and final injunction against enforcement of the CAI and EO 202.68, \nwhich represents not only an entirely new deprivation of constitutional rights but is also, in certain \nof its elements, evidently contemptuous of this Court’s injunctive order of June 26, 2020. \nADOPTION OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT \n10.   To avoid needless burdening of the record, plaintiffs hereby adopt and incorporate by \nreference the allegations and claims of the original Complaint, ECF No. 51, as supplemented by \nfactual and legal developments since its filing on June 10, 2020 and the injunctive Order and \nDecision of this Court, issued June 26, 2020. See ECF No. 35. The later developments and related \nnew claims are the subject of this First Verified Amended Complaint. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 4 of 153\n11.

This action raises federal questions under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe United States Constitution and under federal law, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 (Declaratory \nJudgments), as well as 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988, and 1920.  \n32.  This Court has jurisdiction over these federal claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343.  \n33.  This Court has authority to grant the requested injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(3), the requested declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and plaintiffs’ \nprayer for costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § \n1920.  \n34.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the Court has supplemental and pendent subject matter \njurisdiction over the state law claims asserted by plaintiffs because the state law claims, based \nupon defendants’ violations of New York State Executive Law § 29-a, are so related to the other \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 8 of 153\nclaims in this action over which the Court has original subject matter jurisdiction, and arise from \na common nucleus of operative facts, that the State law claims form part of the same case or \ncontroversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.  \n35.  Venue is proper in the Northern District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as five of the \ndefendants reside in this District and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims herein \narose in this District. \nFACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \n“I have to say to the Orthodox community tomorrow, if you’re not willing to \nlive with these rules, then I’m going to close the synagogues… I’m going to \nsay to the Orthodox community tomorrow, if you don’t agree, then we will have \nto close down your religious institutions.” \n \n“If the religious leaders do not agree to abide by these rules then we will close \nthe religious institutions, period.”  \nAndrew M. Cuomo \nOctober 5, 2020 \n \n \n  The Endless, Ever-Expanding “Disaster Emergency” \n \n36.  On June 26, this Court granted preliminary injunctive relief invalidating Cuomo’s \nnumerical limits on outdoor gatherings as enumerated in the original complaint. \n37.  The  Court  granted  this  relief  following  Cuomo’s  and  defendant  de  Blasio’s \nendorsement of mass demonstrations numbering in the tens of thousands, packed into small spaces, \nwhile they forbade high school graduations, funerals and other comparatively miniscule outdoor \ngatherings under Cuomo’s executive orders banning or strictly limiting “non-essential gatherings.”  \n38.   This Court further enjoined Cuomo and de Blasio from enforcing Cuomo’s restriction \nof indoor religious gatherings alone to 25% of building capacity, mandating that he and his \nsubordinates afford indoor religious gatherings the same capacity limitation afforded to “Phase \nTwo industries,” which was 50% to 100%, depending on the industry, with no numerical cap. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 9 of 153\n39.   Since the date of this Court’s injunction, the whole of the State of New York was \nsupposed to have entered the final Phase Four of the NYFP, with ad hoc adjustments in certain \nareas dictated by Cuomo according to his unfettered discretion—e.g., no indoor dining in New \nYork City despite its allowance elsewhere in Phase Four.  \n40.   Not even under Phase Four, however, has Cuomo permitted a full restoration of the \nconstitutional rights of New York’s residents, including plaintiffs. Seven months after the virus \nfirst appeared in New York State, religious and funeral services under Phase Four are uniquely \nconfined to 33% of indoor capacity according to the State’s “Guidance” document—despite this \nCourt’s  injunction—while  numerous  other  activities,  including  “essential  retail”  and  office \nenvironments, are allowed either 100% or 50% of indoor capacity.  See Exhibit 2-1. \n41.  Yet, as of the date of this Complaint, both deaths and hospitalizations attributed \n(however loosely) to the virus have declined to statistical zero in both New York State and New \nYork City, where those data have remained for months.  The number of daily deaths attributed \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 10 of 153\n(however loosely) to COVID-19 in the state has been plummeting since mid-April and now stands \nat statistical zero, with a grand total of 9 deaths out of 19,000,000 people on October 7:   \n42.  The same is true of COVID-“related” hospitalizations, which stood at a mere 748  \nout of 19,000,000 inhabitants of New York as of October 6, the very day the CAI was launched: \n43.  In New York City, following the same peak in April, deaths are likewise at \nstatistical zero since mid-June, with 5 deaths in the City on October 4 (see Exhibits 2-4 and 2-5): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 11 of 153\n \n \n44.  New York City hospitalizations “related” to COVID-19 have followed the same \ninexorable trend toward zero since mid-April, with 22 COVID-“related” hospitalizations out of \n9,000,000 inhabitants of the City as of October 1 (see Exhibit 2-6): \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 12 of 153\n45.  Even  the  misleading  statistic  of  COVID-19  “cases,”  meaning  only  dubiously \nreliable (see below) positive test results of random people without concomitant hospitalization, \ndeath or even active illness, peaked in April and reached statistical zero in June in both New York \nState and New York City, even though this statistic is now the only basis for the CAI. This is \nshown in the following two extracted from Exhibits 2-7 and 2-2 to this Complaint:  \n                      \n  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 13 of 153\n46.  Given that a total of 25,479 deaths in New York State have been attributed to \nCOVID-19 as of September 30, according to Cuomo’s own update, Exhibit 2-14, the COVID-19 \npandemic that began in April and is now clearly spent has claimed barely over 1/10th of 1% \n(0.00130) of New York’s total population of 19,450,000 (25,479/19,450,000).  The vast majority \nof those deaths are among those aged 65 and older with literally zero risk to children (see Exhibit \n2-5):1 \n \n \n1/ See https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109867/coronavirus-death-rates-by-age-new-york-\ncity/  for original source from which this chart has been extracted. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 14 of 153\n47. As these data show conclusively, there is no longer any rational or factual basis for \nperpetuating a state of “disaster emergency” involving the suspension of the constitutional rights \nin New York State or New York City. \n48.    Since the date of this Court’s injunction, however, Cuomo has only expanded his \nquasi-monarchical rule over the State of New York, even as the COVID-19 outbreak dwindles \ntoward the vanishing point and no longer poses any credible threat to the general population or the \ncapacity of the health care system.  \n49.  The “disaster emergency” declared in Order 202 has lasted more than 214 days and \nnow threatens to become a new status quo, as Cuomo’s justification for it has constantly shifted: \nfrom “bending the curve” of the epidemic in order to prevent the overrunning of hospitals, to \n“limiting the spread” of the virus—without regard to whether people to which it spreads are \nadversely affected or just asymptomatic—to preventing a hypothetical “second wave.” \n50.  Cuomo now takes the position that it is not the virus itself that will cause the \n“second wave” but “cases” in the South and West of America. Cuomo declared on July 17 that an \n“outbreak” of “cases” anywhere in the country—asymptomatic, never-treated subjects who merely \ntest positive—is an “outbreak” in New York that constitutes a continuing emergency: \nWhat we're really looking at now is the potential of a second wave - not the second \nwave that we originally discussed. The second wave that we originally feared was \nfrom the theory of the 1918 pandemic where there was Phase One and then the \nvirus mutated and came back in Phase Four. That's not what we're looking at here. \nThis second wave would be man-made, not made by Mother Nature. It would not \nbe mutation of the virus. It would be a wave that comes from the West and the \nSouth, a southwesterly wave that comes back to New York from the increase [of \n“cases”] in the other states. We are painfully aware now that an outbreak \nanywhere is an outbreak everywhere..  (emphasis added here and throughout this \nAmended Complaint)2/ \n \n \n2/ See Transcript of July 17 press briefing: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-\nannounces-new-york-city-cleared-global-health-experts-enter-phase-four-reopening \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 15 of 153\n51. Citing the “infection rate” in other states—meaning, again, the percentage of positive \ntest results misleadingly categorized as “cases”—Cuomo issued Executive Order 2053/ June 24. \nEO 205 blatantly interferes with freedom of movement and interstate travel by requiring that \nanyone arriving in New York from “a state with a positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 \nresidents, or higher than a 10% test positivity rate, over a seven day rolling average, will be \nrequired to quarantine for a period of 14 days.”  Cuomo’s list of “restricted states” now stands at \n35 as of October 6.4/  \n52.  This brazen declaration of a virtual nationwide travel ban by a lone governor was \nfollowed by Cuomo’s Executive Order 205.1,5/ issued September 28, in which he interferes with \ninternational travel, imposing a 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving in New York “from any \ncountry with a CDC Level 2 or Level 3 health notice.”  The list of countries subject to Cuomo’s \ninternational travel ban now includes “all but 31 countries on the globe.”6/ \n53.  In this regard, Cuomo imagines he is in command of a “valve” he can open or close \nat will in order minutely to control the seemingly endless waxing and waning of COVID-19 \n“cases” by adjusting what is allowed and what is forbidden to New Yorkers as he sees fit, based \non “the numbers.” For example, as Cuomo informed the press on July 6: \nIt’s what we said from day one with my great graphic that nobody liked at the time \nI originally did it and nobody still likes, but I like it, so sometimes it’s nice to be \nGovernor. You have a valve: Control the activity and watch, monitor the valves \nto see if the infection rate is going up, the hospitalization rate is going up and \nkeep your hand on the valve. If you see it start to go up, slow down the valve. \nIf you don’t see the numbers going up, then you can open up the economic activity \nvalve. \n \n3/ See https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-205-quarantine-restrictions-travelers-arriving-new-\nyork \n4/ See https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory  \n5/See https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2051-quarantine-restrictions-travelers-arriving-new-\nyork \n6/ See https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 16 of 153\nThat’s what we've been doing and that’s what you see with these little corrections. \nNew York City goes into Phase Three, but no indoor dining. We have the phases \nand then we have certain adjustments that we make to the phases. The numbers \nshow you that we are right where we want to be. New York City goes into Phase \nThree today, no indoor dining. There are rules on Phase Three—it doesn't mean go \nout and have a party. We have 50 percent occupancy for personal care services. \nYou have to wear face coverings, customers must wear face coverings, 6-foot \ndistance.7/ \n54.  As Cuomo further observed on that occasion, his “valve” was “tightened” to  close \npersonal care facilities so that he was deprived of a facial he had planned for himself: “Prohibited \nservices [sic] that require the removal of face coverings, such as facials, you can’t get a facial. I \ndid that against my own self-interest. I was supposed to get a facial today. Closed the waiting \nrooms…. There are rules.” (emphasis added) \nA “Casedemic” Replaces the Pandemic \n55.  No longer able to document his claim of a statewide “health emergency” with a \nstatistically significant number of COVID-caused deaths or hospitalizations in a population of \n19,000,000, Cuomo has quietly replaced the COVID-19 pandemic with a COVID-19 “casedemic.” \nHe now describes anyone who tests positive for the virus as a “case” of COVID-19, even if the \nperson tested is asymptomatic or only mildly affected, never required hospitalization or even a \ndoctor’s visit, or never even knew he had the virus. \n56.  Even  if  mere  positive  tests  for  a  virus  without  concomitant  illnesses  or \nhospitalizations constituted a public health emergency, the testing dataset is itself fraught with \nreliability problems. For example, in experiments utilizing samples taken from subjects who had \nsubmitted to the CDC’s “gold-standard” Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) \n \n7/ See Transcript, of July 6 press briefing: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-photos-\naudio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-announces-new-york-city-enters-phase-iii \n  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 17 of 153\ntest, board-certified Pathologist Dr. Sin Hang Lee demonstrated that the PCR test yielded a \ndistressingly high incidence of misdiagnosis. Beyond unreliable results, Dr. Lee’s study also \nrevealed that the CDC’s sample labels were also unreliable, with some samples labeled “CDC-\ntest-positive” being negative, and vice versa.8 Dr. Lee warns that “a positive test result must be \nsubstantiated by a DNA sequencing electropherogram showing the genomic fingerprints of the \nvirus. False-positive test reports can easily create unnecessary panic resulting in negative \nimpacts on local economies.” \n57.  As Dr. Lee here suggests, the problem with Newsom’s “casedemic” goes far \nbeyond unreliable PCR test results. There is the bigger problem of “positive” results that are \nepidemiologically worthless because the result does not indicate an active infection—the genomic \nfingerprints of the virus—and thus only causes public hysteria, exploited to oppress millions with \nunconstitutional restrictions of fundamental rights, including the worship of God. \n58.  As The New York Times has just revealed, PCR testing is being abused to maximize \nthe number of “cases” where there is no viral load sufficient to warrant medical concern. This \nis done by running, not 30 PCR cycles, as Dr. Lee’s study notes, but 40 or more cycles until some \narguable remnant of the virus is found, which is then simply reported as a “positive” without \nproviding the cycle threshold (C.T.) values. (Ex. 4-6.) The Times cites Harvard epidemiologist Dr. \nMichael Mina concerning testing in Massachusetts, where “from 85 to 90 percent of people who \ntested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the \n \n8 (Sin Hang Lee, Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in cellular components by routine nest RT-PCR followed \nby  DNA  sequencing  (Jul.  17,  2020)  INTERNATIONAL  JOURNAL  OF  GERIATRICS  AND \nREHABILITATION, 2(1):69–96, https://bit.ly/3gTvZOB.) \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 18 of 153\nthreshold were 30 cycles… ‘I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not \none,’ he said.”9 Dr. Mina would set the cycle threshold at 30 or even less. See Exhibit 3-8. \n59.  “I’m shocked that people would think that 40 [cycles] could represent a \npositive,” said Dr. Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California at Riverside to the \nTimes. The Times also quotes Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, who \nprotests: “It’s just kind of mind-blowing to me that people are not recording the C.T. values \nfrom all these tests—that they’re just returning a positive or a negative.” Id. \n60.  Citing Dr. Mina, the Times exposé reported only a month ago (August 29) that the \nresult of this abuse is a wildly inflated number of “cases” that poses no threat to public health:  \nIn three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in \nMassachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive \ncarried barely any virus… On Thursday (August 27, 2020), the United States \nrecorded 45,604 new coronavirus cases, according to a database maintained by The \nTimes. If the rates of contagiousness in Massachusetts and New York were to apply \nnationwide, then perhaps only 4,500 of those people may actually need to isolate \nand submit to contact tracing… Tests with thresholds so high may detect not \njust live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from the infection that pose \nno particular risk—akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has \nleft, Dr. Mina said. \n61.  As the Times concluded: “But with 20 percent or more of people testing positive in \nsome parts of the country, Dr. Mina and other researchers are questioning the use of PCR tests as \na frontline diagnostic tool.” Id. \n \n \n9 “Contact tracing” for a virus that has already spread to millions of asymptomatic Americans is \njust as pointless as widespread hypersensitive PCR testing. Common sense shows the absurdity of \ntracking down a tiny segment of COVID-19-infected people in a sea of millions of infections. As \nThe New York Times observed of the effort on July 31: “The virus’s pervasiveness and major lags \nin testing have rendered the system almost pointless.” (Jennifer Steinhauer & Abby Goodnough, \n“Contact Tracing Is Failing in Many States. Here’s Why, (July 31, 2020) https://nyti.ms/3motjmb). \nNot almost pointless, but entirely so. Pointless “contact tracing” does, however, supply an excuse \nto prolong Cuomo’s COVID-19 dictatorship. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 19 of 153\n62.  Based solely on testing whose reliability and utility are seriously in question, \nhowever, New York’s health bureaucracy now declares that there are 472,994 “cases” of COVID-\n19 in the state as October 7 based more than 10 million tests performed. There are probably \nhundreds of thousands more such “cases” to be found by the same relentless testing regime.  \n63.  The only point of the testing is to find “cases” of COVID-19 in people who aren’t \nsick in order to perpetuate an “emergency” and an unconstitutional dictatorship that will never end \nas long as there are such “cases” to be found. What all the testing is really uncovering is hidden \ntraces of a viral presence that become known, not because they are causing actual harm to the \npublic, but because Cuomo is relentlessly hunting for them. \n \nThe “Cluster Action Initiative” \n64.    Moving the goal post of a return to normal yet again, Cuomo now declares a further \nsuspension of constitutional rights until he has eliminated all “clusters” of the virus in what he \ndeems “hot spots,” meaning merely a few positive COVID-19 test results in particular areas \ninvolving people who are not even sick. \n65.   On October 6, based on nothing but a few positive test results purporting to detect \nthe presence of COVID-19 or its remnants in a handful of people in Brooklyn, Queens, Orange, \nRockland and Broome Counties, but with no emergent increase in hospitalizations or deaths, \nCuomo issued Executive Order 202.68, imposing his newly devised CAI on the entire of State \nNew York.  See Exhibit 1-1.  \n66.   Under the CAI, the entire state is now subject to division into “zones” denominated \nRed, Orange or Yellow based on the number of positive COVID-19 test results. Depending on the \nzone classification, what was Phase Four of Cuomo’s New York Forward Plan (NYFP) to “reopen” \nthe state he himself locked down is partially or even totally rolled back—seven months after the \nvirus first appeared in New York and with hospitalizations and deaths at statistical zero. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 20 of 153\n67.  The restrictions on fundamental rights attendant to each zone are described in \nCuomo’s October 6 announcement of his new regime: \nRed Zone — Cluster Itself \n \n•  Houses of Worship: 25 percent capacity, 10 people maximum \n•  Mass Gatherings: Prohibited \n•  Businesses: Only essential businesses open \n•  Dining: Takeout only \n•  Schools: Closed, remote only \n \nOrange Zone — Warning Zone \n \n•  Houses of Worship: 33 percent capacity, 25 people maximum \n•  Mass Gatherings: 10 people maximum, indoor and outdoor \n•  Businesses: Closing high-risk non-essential businesses, such as gyms and \npersonal care \n•  Dining: Outdoor dining only, 4 person maximum per table \n•  Schools: Closed, remote only \n \nYellow Zone — Precautionary Zone \n \n•  Houses of Worship: 50 percent capacity \n•  Mass Gatherings: 25 people maximum, indoor and outdoor \n•  Businesses: Open \n•  Dining: Indoor and outdoor dining, 4 person maximum per table \n•  Schools: Open with mandatory weekly testing of students and \nteachers/staff for in-person settings. The New York State Department of \nHealth will establish a percentage of teachers and students/staff who need \nto be tested by Friday. \n \nSee Exhibit 1-2. \n \n68.  EO 202.68 provides that “The enforcement of the zones will go into effect as soon as \ntomorrow and no later than Friday [October 9]” and that “any individual who encourages, \npromotes or organizes a non-essential gathering as set forth in Department of Health regulation, \nshall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $15,000 per day.”  Ex. 1-1 at 1, 2. \n69.  EO 202.68 provides as follows: \nThe Department of Health shall determine areas in the State that require \nenhanced public health restrictions based upon cluster-based cases of COVID-\n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 21 of 153\n19 at a level that compromises the State’s containment of the virus. Certain \nactivities shall be restricted and any permitted activities, in all three zones below, \nshall be conducted in strict adherence to Department of Health guidance.   \n \nExhibit 1-1 at 1. \n \n70.  EO 202.68 provides no specific epidemiological or other criteria for defining what \nconstitutes a “cluster,” how many positive tests are required for designation as a “Red Zone” an \n“Orange Zone” or a “Yellow Zone,” or what level of positive tests “compromises the State’s \ncontainment of the virus.” Moreover, “containment of the virus” as such is not defined. All of these \nundefined matters are left entirely to the unfettered discretion and unappealable decisions of the \nDepartment of Health, headed by defendant Zucker and answerable only to Cuomo. \n71.  Supplanting the NYFP, at least in the zones denominated Red, Orange or Yellow, the \nCAI is an entirely new framework for implementing Executive Order 202.6, issued on March 18, \n2020, which established Cuomo’s original arbitrary distinction between “essential” and “non-\nessential” “businesses and non-profit entities,” and essential and “non-essential” gatherings, \nrelegating churches and synagogues to the category of “non-essential,” where they have remained \never since. \n72.  The CAI allows a vast array of “essential business” to operate without indoor \noccupancy restrictions even in its “Red Zone,” including the following examples of places where \npeople congregate indoors in large numbers and for extended periods of time: \n•  grocery stores including all food and beverage stores \n•  pharmacies \n•  convenience stores \n•  farmer’s markets \n•  gas stations \n•  hardware, appliance, and building material stores \n•  pet food \n•  homeless shelters and congregate care facilities \n•  food banks \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 22 of 153\n•  human services providers whose function includes the direct care of patients in \nstate-licensed or funded voluntary programs; the care, protection, custody and \noversight of individuals both in the community and in state-licensed residential \nfacilities; those operating community shelters and other critical human services \nagencies providing direct care or support \n•  airlines/airports \n•  public and private transportation infrastructure such as bus, rail, for-hire vehicles, \ngarages \n•  hotels, and other places of accommodation, including campgrounds.  \n•  senior/elder care \n•  nursing homes, residential health care facilities, or congregate care facilities \n•  food processing, manufacturing agents including all foods and beverages \n•  laundromats and other clothing/fabric cleaning services \n•  child care services \n•  animal shelters and animal care including dog walking, animal boarding and pet \ngrooming but only to the extent necessary to ensure animal health \n•  News media \n•  banks or lending institution \n•  higher education research \n•  child care programs and services \n•  government owned or leased buildings \n \nSee Exhibit 2-1.10 \n73.  Under CAI’s new scheme of arbitrary occupancy restrictions, a church is closed for \nworship, depending on its zone, but incurs no occupancy restriction whatsoever if the same church \npremises are used to provide a homeless shelter, a food bank, or other “critical human services… \nproviding direct care or support” of individuals in the community. \n74.  The zone designations of the CAI have already expanded to include the following \ncounties as of October 7: Brooklyn, Queens, Rockland and Orange. Compliance with the CAI \nzoned restrictions is now being enforced jointly by defendants Cuomo and de Blasio, as to counties \nin New York City.  See Exhibit 1-2.  \n \n10/ The aforementioned Empire State Development Guidance to “Cluster Initiative,” available at \nhttps://esd.ny.gov/ny-cluster-action-initiative-guidance.) \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 23 of 153\n75.  As pleaded above, infant plaintiffs P.L. and G.L., Mayer, Perr and Schonbrun all \nreside in Brooklyn’s newly created “Red Zone,” where gatherings inside churches and synagogues \nhave been restricted to a maximum of ten persons, religious schools have been closed, and all non-\nessential outdoor gatherings,  including religious gatherings, are forbidden under penalty of a \n$15,000 fine for the organizer, promoters or those who merely “encourage” a forbidden outdoor \nreligious gathering.   \n76.  The “Red Zone” in Brooklyn as well as the Orange and Yellow zones, are depicted \non the following map, Exhibit 1-3, promulgated with Cuomo’s and De Blasio’s approval and \nauthority: \n \n77.  Neither Cuomo nor de Blasio nor the DOH has specified the gross number or the \npercentage of positive tests that suffices for “Red Zone” designation or, for that matter, designation \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 24 of 153\nas an Orange or Yellow zone.  The data Cuomo has published to date, however, demonstrate that \nthe number of positive tests being employed to justify the total suspension of constitutional rights \nin the Red Zone is statistically trivial. \n78.  For example, Zip Code 11229, the location of Good Shepherd, the church attended \nby infant plaintiffs P.L. and G.L and its appurtenant religious school, where they receive a religious \neducation and formation, is largely located in Cuomo’s highly restricted Red and Orange zones.  \nThis area is supposed to be one of Cuomo’s “hotspots.”  Yet the raw data concerning the number \nof tests administered and number of positive results reported on September 29, based on the data \nfrom September 28, show a mere twelve positive tests with only 299 tests performed.11 Ex. 2-11. \n79.  On the following day, September 30, 2020, the zone was again declared a “hot spot” \nbased on the data from September 29, which show a mere eleven positive tests within 11229, with \nonly 286 tests performed.  There are over 80,000 residents in this zip code.  Ex. 3-3. \n80.  Considering Brooklyn as a whole, the positivity rate for the two weeks preceding the \nlaunching of the CAI were as follows (see Exhibits 2-11 and 2-12): \n9/25:   1.6% \n9/26:   2.0% \n9/27:   2.6% \n9/28:  1.7% \n9/29:  1.8% \n9/30:   1.9% \n10/1:  1.9% \n10/2:   2.3% \n10/3:  2.4% \n10/4:   2.5% \n10/5:   2.1% \n10/6:   2.2% \n \n \n11 https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-meet-orthodox-jewish-community-\nleaders-address-covid-19-clusters \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 25 of 153\n81.  The positivity rate in Brooklyn has remained around 2 percent as a whole during this \ntime period.  \n82.  When considering the number of “cases” within New York City schools located in \nthe nine top zip codes Cuomo and de Blasio consider “hot spots,” including the 11229 Zip Code, \na total of 1,351 tests were administered with two positive results. This accounts for a tiny 0.14 \ninfection rate in schools located in these supposed “hotspots.” See Exhibit 3-6 at 2. \n83.  In sum, there is no epidemiological evidence to support the draconian restrictions of \nthe CAI, especially given the reliability problems with PCR testing, noted above. \nCuomo Misleads Brooklyn’s Orthodox Jewish Community  \nby Falsely Promising to Abide by this Court’s Order \n84.  On October 6, the day EO 202.68 and the CAI became legally operative, Cuomo, \nwhile professing to be a friend of the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, evinced patent \nbias  against  that  community  and  religious  gatherings  in  general:  “No  large  gatherings  in \nsynagogues to save a life. You look at where the infection rate is. You look at those clusters. \nPeople will die in those clusters. This is about protecting people and saving lives.”   \n85.  Cuomo presented no evidence whatsoever, and none exists, that “clusters”—\na term not defined in the first place—have originated in synagogues or religious schools \nas  opposed  to  innumerable  other  places  in  Brooklyn,  including  all  the  “essential \nbusinesses” Cuomo allows to operate at full capacity in the same “Red Zone.”   \n86.  During the same press conference, Cuomo expressly stated that his real object was to \nrestrict religion and not businesses:  \n[T]he new rules are most impactful on houses of worship, because the virus is \nnot coming from non-essential businesses. That’s not what this is about. It may \nbe spread by non-essential businesses. The virus is not starting in schools. It may \nbe spread by schools. This is about mass gatherings. One of the prime places of \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 26 of 153\nmass gatherings are houses of worship. I understand it’s a sensitive topic, but that \nis the truth. Period. You want to solve the problem? Acknowledge the problem.  \n  \n87.  Cuomo presented no evidence, because there is none, that houses of worship or \nreligious schools are “the problem” and not “non-essential businesses.” \n88.  The day before, during his press briefing on October 5, Exhibit 3-2, Cuomo’s anti-\nreligious bias and his targeting of religion, in particular Orthodox Judaism, for “Red Zone” \ndesignation, with closure of religious schools and de facto closure of synagogues and churches, \nwas even more apparent: \n•  “Religious gatherings, especially in these communities. New Rochelle, first \nhotspot, was an Orthodox Jewish man who went to a temple, hundreds of \npeople.  And  then  a  wedding.  Hundreds  of  people.  Orthodox  Jewish \ngatherings often are very, very large…. \n \n•  “We know religious institutions have been a problem. We know mass \ngatherings are the super spreader events. We know there have been mass \ngatherings  going  on  in  concert  with  religious  institutions  in  these \ncommunities for weeks. For weeks. I don’t mean little violations. You’re \nonly supposed to have 50, they had 55. I’m talking about, you’re only \nsupposed to have 50 outdoors, they [Orthodox Jews] had 1,000. These are \npictures from the past couple of weeks. And these are just emblematic…. \n \n•  “You’ve all seen pictures like this for weeks [indicating photos of two large \nOrthodox Jewish gatherings outdoors]. See Exhibit 3-2. What did you think \nwas going to happen? What do you think was going to happen? Religious \ninstitutions are mass gatherings and raise the greatest potential…. The one \n[photo] on the right is more recent than the one on the left. Okay. But they’re \nin the recent past.12  \n \n•  “If we’re going to keep religious institutions open, it can only be with two \nconditions.  One,  the  community  must  agree,  whether  it’s  the  Jewish \ncommunity, whether we’re talking about Black churches, whether we’re \ntalking about Roman Catholic churches, the religious community has to \nagree to the rules. And they have to agree that they are going to follow the \nrules and they have to agree that they are going to be a full partner in the \nenforcement of the rules. That’s condition one. I’m going to meet with \nmembers of the ultra-Orthodox community tomorrow. I want to have \n \n12/ In fact, the photo on the left, depicted in Exhibit 3-7 was taken fourteen years ago during the \nfuneral of a revered Rabbi, when a crowd of Orthodox Jews gathered to pay its respects. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 27 of 153\nthat conversation directly myself.

I am prepared to do that.” … \n \n•  “I’m going to be meeting with the Orthodox community tomorrow. See \nif they will agree to live and abide by the rules and advocate compliance. If \nthe rabbi advocates compliance, that would be a very positive start. If the \ncommunities don’t agree with the rules, which is possible, I had some \nconversations  where  some  religious  leaders  believe  they  have  herd \nimmunity, which is not true. Some people believe have followed politics \nand think that masks are ineffective, and this is all a hoax. That’s not true, \nbut if they don’t agree, then the state will take action…. \n \n•  “Can you put up the picture of the two [Orthodox Jewish] congregations \nagain?... \n \n•  “Meet with the Orthodox community, see if they will agree to live by \nthe  rules.

I’m \ngoing to have to say that to the black ministers.” \n \n89.  As was the case on October 6, Cuomo presented no evidence, there being none, that \nOrthodox Jewish or other religious gatherings or any religious school posed a particular threat to \npublic health in terms of undefined “clusters,” and no evidence that even a single hospitalization \nor death in his “Red Zone” had occurred because of religious gatherings as opposed to other \ngatherings in Brooklyn, including massive demonstrations for George Floyd and Black Lives \nMatter as noted in plaintiffs’ Original Complaint.  ECF No., ¶¶ 60-76.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 28 of 153\n90.  The only “evidence” Cuomo presented on October 5 was two photographs of \nOrthodox Jewish religious gatherings he represented were taken recently, as shown above, when \nin fact the photograph on the left, as depicted in Exhibit 3-7, was taken fourteen years ago during \nthe funeral of a revered Rabbi, when a crowd of Orthodox Jews gathered outdoors to pay its \nrespects.  But while Cuomo objects to this gathering of Orthodox Jews for a religious purpose, he \nmade no objection to far more massive gatherings for a political purpose in connection with the \ndeath of George Floyd.  See comparison photos at Exhibit 3-7. \n91.  During the October 5 press briefing, Cuomo was confronted with this Court’s \ninjunctive order of June 26 and was asked how he could order the closure of “religious institutions” \nin view of the injunction.  In answer, as supplemented by his secretary, Melissa De Rosa, Cuomo \nrevealed his contempt of this Court’s order and his plan to circumvent it by closing down all “non-\nessential” businesses along with synagogues and churches in his “Red Zone” based on a few \npositive COVID-19 test results, with no specification of the number of positive tests required or \nwhat constitutes a “cluster”:  \nLouis: (44:48) \n \nDo you believe you have the legal authority to close down religious institutions \n[inaudible 00:44:49] wasn’t there a recent court order barring you from \ndoing that? \nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (44:52) \nWe believe we have the legal authority. We will assert the legal authority. \nWe have been sued by the religious organizations. Our legal authority was \nupheld.  I  don’t  like  getting  into  a  litigious  situation  with  the  religious \ncommunity. I have enough questions that I have to answer when I get to the \nPearly Gates. I don’t want to also be questioned as to why I was sued by the \nCatholic church or the Jewish community for closing temples. So I have \nenough issues on my plate. But yes, we believe we have the legal authority. \nDid you want to say something?... \nMelissa DeRosa: (46:15): \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 29 of 153\nThe lawsuit was over whether or not it was fair that in a religious institution, \nyou were taking a different standard than any other business. And the court at \nthe time went with the businesses. But what the governor’s describing as if \nwe’re moving into a situation where we’re indiscriminately saying a mass \ngathering  number  in  a  certain  region  based  on  infection  rate  would  be \nlowered, let’s call it 10 people. I’m not saying that’s what it’s going to be. But \njust  for  example  sake,  10  people,  then  you’re  not  saying  a  religious \ninstitution is being treated differently than any other institution because \nthe law would be applied evenly throughout. Does that make sense? \n92.  As the October 5 press briefing reveals, Cuomo evidently also assumed that, in \ndefiance of this Court’s injunction, he could continue to maintain a 50-person limit on outdoor \ngatherings—which he has now totally forbidden in his “Red Zone”—including any religious \ngatherings in which the original five plaintiffs in this action participate: \nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (16:23) \n \nReligious gatherings. The City's proposal does not close religious institutions. We \nknow religious institutions have been a problem. We know mass gatherings \nare the super spreader events. We know there have been mass gatherings going \non in concert with religious institutions in these communities for weeks. For weeks. \nI don't mean little violations. You're only supposed to have 50, they had 55. I’m \ntalking about, you're only supposed to have 50 outdoors, they [the Orthodox \nJews] had 1,000. These are pictures from the past couple of weeks. And these are \njust emblematic. \n \n93.  Cuomo so declared despite the Court’s June 26 ruling that Cuomo’s and de Blasio’s \napproval of mass gatherings for the political causes they favor required elimination of outdoor \ngathering limitations altogether. \n94.  During the same press briefing, Cuomo further revealed that he was abandoning his  \nand de Blasio’s original idea of Zip Code-based closures of churches and synagogues along with \ndisfavored “non-essential” businesses due to undefined “clusters” because that would be seen as \n“arbitrary and capricious,” given that one could avoid the closure by simply walking across the \nstreet into a different Zip Code: \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 30 of 153\nAnd if you don’t do it right, it’ll just be arbitrary and capricious and then they’ll \nbring you into court. And they’ll say, it’s just because I happened to be in the \nzip code and one side of the street, the deli’s open on the other side of the street, \nthe delis closed. What sense does that make? All you’re doing is bringing the \npeople across the street. So what is the best area? Once we have that done, \nthen I don’t have a problem with closing the [non-] essential businesses. \nThen you determine for how long by what data, et cetera… \n \n95.  Cuomo’s Red, Yellow and Orange zone approach, however, is equally arbitrary and \ncapricious because it is just as easy to leave one of his color-coded zones by crossing the street at \nits perimeter, as shown on the map set forth above. \n96.  As The New York Post reported, Cuomo’s announcement of the CAI on October 6, \nwith its de facto closure synagogues in “Red Zone” of Brooklyn by limiting their capacity to t10 \npeople, betrays a promise he made to the Jewish community only hours before on the same day, \nduring the meeting he said he would was going to have with its representatives during the press \nconference on October 5.  \n97.  During the October 6 meeting by teleconference, and consistently with this Court’s \nJune 26 injunction, Cuomo said any restrictions on synagogue or church worship would not be \ntighter than 50% of indoor capacity, which was the rule for the “Phase 2 Industries” to which this \nCourt’s injunction refers as the comparator: \nGov. Andrew Cuomo told Jewish religious leaders that limiting houses of worship \nto 50 percent capacity was sufficient to beat back the coronavirus surge — only \nto announce tighter restrictions just hours later. \nThe governor spoke around 9 a.m. Tuesday with honchos from Orthodox Jewish \ncommunities across New York, seeking their commitment to help contain new \noutbreaks in Brooklyn and Queens, as well as a handful of upstate communities…. \nCuomo told the leaders that a strict limit on the number of people in synagogues \nand other houses of worship was necessary, but indicated that it would be set at 50 \npercent. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 31 of 153\n“We have to follow the 50 percent in the synagogues … otherwise, I’m telling you, \nwe’re gonna have to wind up going back to close down,” he said, according to the \ntranscript.  \n“We’re going to enforce the rules but the 50 percent is OK.” \nSee Exhibit 3-4. \n98.  Hours later, however, Cuomo announced his CAI regime, which had obviously \nbeen in the planning stages at the very moment he made his false promise to the leaders of \nBrooklyn’s Jewish community.  As The Post further reports: “The Hasidic Jewish community in \nBorough Park, Brooklyn did not take kindly to the blindside announcement, launching a fiery and \nlargely-unmasked  protest late  Tuesday  into  early  Wednesday  that  saw  two photographers \nbeaten — and no NYPD intervention.” \n99.   The Jewish community publication Hamodia reported on the betrayal as follows: \nDuring the call with Jewish leaders Tuesday morning, Cuomo indicated that if \ncommunity leaders enforced the 50% guideline, shuls would not be closed. He said, \n“The current rule is no more than 50%. In any indoor gathering 50% of capacity…in \na synagogue in any venue, any private venue. It’s 50% of capacity. That’s the \ncurrent law. We have to follow that law. If we don’t follow that law then the \ninfection rate gets worse. Then we’re gonna have to go back to close down. And \nnobody wants to do that. But I need your help in getting the rate down, and the rate \nwill come down. If we follow the rules on the mask and the social distancing and \nthe 50%.” \nLater that day, the governor announced that houses of worship in coronavirus \n‘hotspots’ could allow a maximum of ten people at services, and non-essential \nbusinesses  in  those  areas  would  be  closed,  in  addition  to  his  Monday \nannouncements that schools in hotspots would be closed. \nA participant on the call who spoke to Hamodia on the condition of anonymity \nexpressed  frustration  with  how  it  transpired,  and  stressed  that  Cuomo  never \nindicated he was prepared to take such extreme measures when it came to shuls. \n“The governor stabbed us in the back by announcing this unprecedented \nlockdown, and he has the audacity to say that he discussed it with Orthodox \nleaders  and  they  were  very  receptive.  This  is  just  unbelievable.  This  is \nsomething that our community will never forget. We were looking forward to \nthe opportunity to finally speak directly to the governor, as we were promised…. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 32 of 153\nInstead the governor pretended that he was ready to listen to us…he lied to us. After \ntelling us that he’ll limit shul participation to 50% capacity, he placed a limit of 10 \npeople. We all feel used, targeted and enraged.” \n \nSee Exhibit 3-5. \n \n100.  Meanwhile, as shown above, defendants have no evidence that their undefined and \nnumerically unspecified “clusters” of positive COVID-19 test results, falsely presented as “cases” \nof COVID-19—the “casedemic” that replaces spent pandemic—pose any threat to public health \nthat requires suspension of constitutional rights in the “Red Zone,” the “Orange Zone”, the \n“Yellow Zone,” or anywhere else in New York State.  \n101.  On the contrary, on October 6, de Blasio admitted that the supposed “surge” in \n“cases”—meaning, again, a few positive (and unreliable) test results do not involve actual illness—\nhas not been accompanied by any increase in hospitalizations: \nMayor: …. What we're seeing so far is actually the number of hospitalizations \nhas not moved much. Although the positivity levels for coronavirus have \nincreased, but still low compared to what they were in the past, so meaning \nwithin – among the folks who were in the hospital – but we certainly have to be \nready for a higher level of hospitalizations. I would say right now, if this is our \nstarting point, we're in a much better place than we were obviously in the spring, \nbecause whatever is happening now has not moved very quickly in terms of \nhospitalizations. But yeah, we have to be ready in case of any scenario. So go ahead, \nDr. Katz. \n \nSee Exhibit 3-6 at 6. \n \n102.  De Blasio’s admission that there is no hospital emergency in New York City was \nseconded by his medical advisor, Mitchell Katz, President and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals: \nThank you, Mr. Mayor. The 11 hospitals of Health + Hospitals have been a great \nbarometer of the city activity for COVID. We saw many of the trends ahead of \nanyone else in the last round. I'm very pleased that right at the moment, there \nare only two patients in the 11 hospitals who currently are on a ventilator due \nto COVID. So, it is very low, but we nonetheless course have plans for how we \nwould deal with the surge if it were to happen…. \n \nId. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 33 of 153\n103.  As shown by the facts pleaded above, the CAI is a pseudo-medical sham that is also \na  bureaucrat’s  dream  because  it  is  based  on  arbitrary,  capricious  and  publicly  undisclosed \nstandards designed to perpetuate a mass suppression of constitutional rights seven months into a \n“lockdown” that is manifestly no longer justified as the State’s own data, noted above, show \nconclusively. \nTHE PARTICULAR IMPACT OF THE  \nCHALLENGED RESTRICTIONS ON PLAINTIFFS \n \nPlaintiffs Soos and Stamos \n104.  As of the date of this Amended Complaint, original plaintiffs Soos and Stamos, \nwho  preside  over  Catholic  churches  and  minister  to  their  flocks  the  North  Country,  see \nincorporated ¶¶ 77-102 of the original Complaint, are not yet subject to the CAI with its Red, \nOrange and Yellow zones or the terms or EO 20-2.68, including its penalties. \n105.  Given Cuomo’s past conduct, however, including his constantly shifting policy \ngoals and arbitrary metrics for prolonging his now seven-months long declaration of emergency \nand his usurpation of ever-expanding “emergency powers,” plaintiffs Soos and Stamos could come \nwithin the reach of this latest rights-restricting scheme at any moment, depending on how many \nCOVID-19 tests are performed and how many are positive, and whether the DOH, empowered by \nCuomo, declares the North County counties in which they minister have reached “a level that \ncompromises the State’s containment of the virus”—whatever that may mean from one day to the \nnext in the hidden recesses of Cuomo’s health bureaucracy. See Exhibit 1-1 at 1. \n106.  Accordingly, plaintiffs Soos and Stamos join the “Red Zone” plaintiffs in seeking \na TRO and permanent and final injunctive relief. \n \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 34 of 153\nInfant Plaintiffs P.L and G.L. \n107.  Newly  added  infant-Plaintiffs  P.L.  and  G.L.  are  sincere  practitioners  of \nCatholicism. Accordingly, infant plaintiffs G.L. and P.L worship at Good Shepherd Catholic \nChurch in Brooklyn and are students at Good Shepherd Catholic Academy (“Good Shepherd”).  \n108.  Both the church and its school are in the “Red Zone” in which all schools must be \nclosed by October 9 under EO 202.68 and the church must be limited to only ten people inside \nduring worship. \n109.  Good Shepherd school is a fully recognized educational institute that meets all \nrequirements under the New York State Department of Education.  At Good Shepherd, Infant-\nPlaintiff P.C.L is in second grade and exercises his constitutional right to a religious education.   \n110.  At  Good  Shepherd,  infant-plaintiff  G.L.  is  in  first  grade  and  exercises  his \nconstitutional right to a religious education and formation, including daily religious instruction and \nalso practices the Catholic faith daily in that school setting.  G.L. is studying the Catholic faith in \npreparation for receiving the Holy Sacrament of First Communion next school year.   \n111.  Infant-plaintiff G.L. has a speech and language disability and was in the process of \nreceiving speech therapy and occupational therapy at Good Shepherd.  Due to Good Shepherd’s \nforced closure by Cuomo and de. Blasio, G.A.L is unable to receive adequate speech therapy \nservices, occupational therapy services and a regimented classroom setting required for him to \nthrive and address his disability.   \n112.  At Good Shepherd, in addition to receiving a religious formation in keeping with \nhis constitutional rights, infant plaintiff P.L.  also receives specific daily religious instruction of \nthe Catholic faith and practices the Catholic faith daily in the school setting.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 35 of 153\n113.  In particular, infant plaintiff P.L. is studying to receive the Holy Sacrament of First \nCommunion this school year, currently scheduled for May 2021. The Holy Sacrament of First \nHoly Communion is of utmost importance to the Catholic faith.  It is the time when a child is \nconsidered having the age of reason and understanding of their faith, so that the child is able to \naccept the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which represents the body and blood of Jesus Christ.  By \nreceiving the Eucharist, the child is initiated into the Eucharistic community, which means the \nchild now has the honor and privilege of celebrating the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for spiritual \nbenefit unto salvation.   \n114.  By order of defendants de Blasio and Cuomo, all schools in New York City \nremained closed throughout the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, following Cuomo’s \noriginal “disaster emergency” declaration in March 2020. \n115.  On July 13, 2020, Governor Cuomo sated during a press-conference that schools \nwould be allowed to reopen in regions that are Phase IV of NYFP. On July 20, 2020, New York \nCity entered Phase IV.13   \n116.  On August 7, 2020, via a tele-conference, Cuomo permitted the opening of schools \nin New York State, stating “by our infection rates, all school districts can open.”  Cuomo went on \nto say “every school district has submitted plans to the Department of Health and State Education \nDepartment…Department of Health has the plans.  Department of Health can disapprove plans if \nthey’re not responsible from a health point of view.”  Cuomo stated that effectively all schools in \nthe state could open if their re-opening plans were approved by the DOH.14 \n \n13 (https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-york-city-cleared-\nglobal-health-experts-enter-phase-four-reopening) \n14See https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/ny-gov-andrew-cuomo-conference-call-transcript-\naugust-7-opening-schools   \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 36 of 153\n117.  In early August of 2020, Good Shepherd submitted its plan for re-opening to the \nNew York State Department of Health, which was subsequently approved. \n118.  On September 9, 2020, Good Shepherd re-opened with a total population of \napproximately 350, inclusive of staff and of students, who range from nursery school through \neighth grade.15  In accordance with safety protocols, this population was present on a rotating-\nbasis, so as to keep the onsite population limited for precautionary purposes.    \n119.  From  September  9,  2020  to  October  5,  2020,  approximately  a  month,  Good \nShepherd operated with all protocols in place and in accordance with the plan approved by the \nDOH. Good Shepherd’s protocols far exceeded both the requirements under the executive orders \nand the recommendations set forth by CDC.        \n120.  From September 9, 2020 to October 5, 2020 Good Shepherd operated with zero \npositive Covid-19 cases.16 \n121.  On Monday, September 29, 2020, however, the Zip Code 11229 was designated by \nCuomo a COVID-19 “hotspot” for having a total of twelve positive test results on the day prior, \nwith  only  299  tests  having  been  administered.  The  11229  Zip  Code  has  a  population  of \napproximately  80,000  people,  and  the  testing  sample  size  was  too  small  to  be  statistically \nrepresentative.17 Yet in this 80,000- person postal zone, twelve positive test results were deemed \na “hotspot”.18    \n \n15See https://schoolcovidreportcard.health.ny.gov/#/schoolData;schBedsCodeId=332200126049; \ndsBedsCodeId=undefined;schoolType=Private%20School;redirectToHome=true). \n16 See https://schoolcovidreportcard.health.ny.gov/#/schoolData;schBedsCodeId= \n332200126049; dsBedsCodeId=undefined;schoolType=Private%20School;redirectToHome=true \n17See https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/11229/) \n18See https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-meet-orthodox-jewish-community-\nleaders-address-covid-19-clusters \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 37 of 153\n122.  One day later, on Tuesday, September 30, Zip Code 11229 was again labelled a \n“hotspot” based on the numbers form the day before.  On that day, a mere eleven tests were positive \nout of a total of 286 tests performed the day prior in this over 80,000-person community. \n123.  The raw numbers justifying the “hotspot” designation were never released again \nafter September 30, 2020, when a mere eleven positive cases among 80,000 persons were deemed \na “hot spot.”  Defendants are apparently hiding this data as it is plainly too scanty to justify the \nonerous restrictions imposed by the CAI and EO 202.68. \n124.  On October 6, 2020, under the guise of narrowing the Zip Code “hot spots,” during \nthe aforesaid press-conference on that date Governor Cuomo expanded the zones to cover a large \nportion of Brooklyn, and virtually all of South Brooklyn, including the vast majority of the 11229 \npostal zones.  The zones were no longer designated by Zip Code but were instead divided into the \nabove-noted Red, Orange and Yellow zones of the CAI.   \n125.  Under EO 202.68, in what is now considered a “Red Zone,” all schools, including \nGood Shepherd, have been ordered to close after they had already been open for month with \nno actual health crisis having occurred, nor are they permitted to reopen even if the Red Zone \nbecomes an Orange zone, as shown above.   \n126.    While Good Shepherd remains closed with no specific reopening plan in place, \nboth Mayor DeBlasio and Governor Cuomo have admitted that the schools are not the cause \nfor any supposed “surge” in COVID “cases—meaning a few positive (but unreliable) tests of \npeople who are not even sick.  As Mayer DeBlasio admitted on October 4, 2020: “I want to \nemphasize, we have seen very little coronavirus activity in our schools.  We have a situation \nroom that’s been monitoring constantly.  This is not because we have seen a number of specific \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 38 of 153\nproblems in our schools, our public schools, we have not.  This is out of abundance of \ncaution.”19  \n127.  Further, during a press conference on October 6, 2020, de Blasio revealed that “just \nthe last few days we’ve gotten 1,351 tests results from the 35 schools in those nine top ZIP \ncodes and only two positive tests among the 1,351 results we’ve gotten so far.20 \n128.   The forced closure of Good Shepherd, based on trivial number of positive COVID-\n19 tests, has deprived infant-plaintiffs P.L. and G.L of their constitutional rights to worship and to \na religious education and formation. \n129.  The limitation of indoor worship to merely ten persons has also deprived infant \nplaintiffs P.L. and G.L of their constitutional rights to free exercise of religion, freedom of speech \nand freedom of assembly because that severe capacity limitation guarantees that they will be \nexcluded from any number of indoor services, with even outdoor services being prohibited under \nEO 202.68, and from their religious schools. \nPlaintiffs Mayerfeld, Perr, Schonbrun and Avigdor \n130.  For the reasons set forth above, EO 202.68 places plaintiffs Mayerfeld, Perr and \nSchonbrun in exactly the same situation they were in concerning indoor worship before this Court \ngranted injunctive relief on June 26:  with their synagogues limited to only ten persons, only the \nrequisite minyan can attend services, with families and everyone else excluded as pleaded in ¶¶ \n103-115 of the original complaint, which have been incorporated herein by reference. \n \n19 See https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/694-20/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-holds-\nmedia-availability (emphasis added).   \n20 (See https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-\nholds-media-availability \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 39 of 153\n131.  E.O. 202.68, however, creates an even worse situation than existed before this \nCourt lifted all outdoor gathering restrictions with its June 26th injunction.  Now, no outdoor \nreligious gathering of any size is permitted in the “Red Zone,” not even the ten persons permitted \noutdoors  under  the  executive  orders  as  challenged  in  the  original  Complaint.  See  original \nComplaint, ¶¶ 103-121; Exhibit 1-1.  And the penalty for violating this outrageous restriction is \n$15,000,000 for organizing, promoting or even encouraging an outdoor religious gathering. \n132.  Newly added plaintiff Avigdor, as President of Congregation Ahavas Dovid, also \nlocated in the Red Zone, suffers the same rights deprivations as Mayer, Perr and Schonbrun, as \nwell as being deprived of any operation of the synagogue over which he and its Rabbi preside. \nPlaintiff Avigdor’s religious duties include assembling the minyan and arranging for services and \nthe Bible readings, including those now underway during Sukkot, as described below, which \ncannot be limited to a mere ten men.  EO 202.68 and the CAI have rendered the operation of his \nsynagogue untenable. \n133.  Even if the “Red Zone” eventually becomes defendants’ new “Orange Zone,” \n“houses of worship” are still limited to no more than 33% of capacity or 25 people, whichever is \nless. This is true even though numerous types of non-essential Phase 2 businesses are allowed to \nopen without such limitations, as shown above, as long as they are not “high-risk” businesses such \nas gyms and salons. See Exhibits 1-1 (EO 202.68 at 2) and 2-1.  Moreover, as driving or use of \nmass transit is prohibited to Orthodox Jews on the Sabbath, journeys outside the zones to \nother synagogues are not possible. \n134.  This  Court’s  June  26  injunctive  order  preliminary  enjoined  defendants  from \nimposing gathering-size limits on the original plaintiffs any more restrictive than those imposed \non NYFP Phase 2 Industries. See Order, ECF No. 35 at 35 (“For the reasons explained above, \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 40 of 153\nappropriate injunctive relief here is a restraint on defendants from enforcement of any indoor \ngathering limitation against plaintiff greater than imposed for Phase 2 industries.”)  \n135.  Because many Phase 2 non-essential businesses are not subject to the 33% or 25-\nperson rule in the Orange Zone under EO 202.68, defendants are apparently in contempt of court \nto the extent they intend to impose such a restriction plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr, and Mayerfeld \n(whenever they attend a synagogue in the Orange Zone or if the Red Zone changes to an Orange \nZone). \n136.  Further, to the extent defendants deem any of Plaintiffs’ outdoor worship activities \nto be “non-essential” gatherings—prohibited in the Red Zone; limited to 10 people in the Orange \nZone; and limited to 25 people in the Yellow Zone—they are in contempt of this Court’s order \nthat defendants be restrained from “enforcement of any limitation for outdoor gatherings against \nplaintiffs,” (ECF No. 35 at 35), given that essential outdoor gatherings still remain unrestricted. \n(EO 202.68 at 2.) \n137.  In Defendants’ new “Red Zone,” “houses of worship are limited to no more than \n25% of capacity or 10 people, whichever is less, even though, as already shown, EO 202.68 plainly \nexempts “essential gatherings” and allows all manner of “essential businesses” even if they involve \nlarge groups of people, in close proximity, for extended periods of time, such as food-processing \nplants, warehouses, homeless shelters, and more. See Ex. 2-___. \n138.  But this Court’s June 26th opinion plainly recognized that even “Phase 2 industries \ninvolve the congregation of people for a length of time,” and Defendants thus had to satisfy strict \nscrutiny for treating plaintiffs differently (i.e., to not allow them to worship in churches and \nsynagogues at 50% of capacity, which was the going occupancy rate for Phase 2 industries). (ECF \nNo. 35 at 30.)  \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 41 of 153\n139.  However, many essential businesses, too, “involve the congregation of people for \na length of time,” and their exemption under EO 202.68 and the accompanying Guidance triggers \nthe same constitutional harm that existed prior to this Court’s June 26th Order. Therefore, \nDefendants appear to be in contempt of court by restricting Plaintiffs’ indoor worship to a 10-\npeople maximum in the Red Zone while allowing offices, retail stores not inside of shopping malls, \nand other similarly situated businesses to operate with no such limitation.  \n140.  Plaintiffs Mayerfeld, Perr, Schonbrun and Avigdor are all imminently threatened \nby the EO 202.68’s limitation of indoor capacity in synagogues to a maximum of ten persons, the \nbare minimum for any Jewish worship service.  In particular, they seek a temporary restraining \norder allowing access to the synagogues by 6 p.m. on October 9, which marks the onset of \nShemini Atzeret. \n141.  The Jewish high holy days of Sukkot (or Sukkos) began this year On Friday evening \nOctober 2nd and ends on Sunday night October 11. The holiday commemorates the wondering of \nthe Israelites in the wilderness and the protection provided by G-d to them at that time. The first \ntwo days of and last two days of the holiday are days when there are various restrictions in place \nsimilar but not identical to the Sabbath. So, for instance, observant Jews cannot use telephones or \ncomputers on those days although they may carry items outside, provided it is not the Sabbath day \nas well. \n142.  The Intermediate days between the first two days and last two days are known as \nChol  Hamoed.  Most  activities,  including going  to  work  are  permitted  on  these  days.  The \nintermediate days fall out this year from Monday, October 5th through Friday October 9th. \n143.  All of the days of this festival are considered joyous and are normally a time of \nfamily gathering and festive meals. Special prayers are recited in the synagogue. There are two \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 42 of 153\nunique observances central to the holiday. One is the Sukkah or hut. This is a temporary structure \nwith a roof made from branches leaves or other wood or vegetation like bamboo or something \nsimilar. Most households will build their own Sukkah in their driveway or backyard or the like. \nPeople who are unable to build a Sukkah may rely on a communal Sukkah built by most \nsynagogues. The Sukkah is used for eating and sleeping and is adorned with decorations.   \n144.  In addition to the aspect of remembering the protection of God and the huts in the \nwilderness, there are many deep spiritual associations with this observance. For instance, the \nnotion of going out from a permanent dwelling and living in a temporary dwelling is meant to \nremind us that this life is temporary and that one ought to focus one’s efforts on perfecting oneslf \nspiritually for the next world. which is eternal.  \n145.  Many synagogues will hold celebratory observances in their Sukkah during the \nintermediate days to commemorate the drawing of the water for the water libations in the ancient \nTemple which were brought during this holiday. These are accompanied by singing and live music \nin large groups.  All these aspects of Sukkah are apparently forbidden in the “Red Zone” as a “non-\nessential” outdoor gathering under penalty of a $15,000, as provided in EO 202.68. \n146.  Another major aspect of religious observance is the four species: The Lulav-Date \nPalm, Etrog-Citron, Haddasim-Myrtle and Aravot-Willow. A blessing is recited over these each \nday except for the Sabbath. In the Synagogue each participant carries his own set o the four  species \nand circles the Bima or central table where the Torah is read. One member of the minyan holds a \nTorah scroll at the Bima while everyone circles one time while saying the Hoshana (Hosanna) \nprayers. There is a different set of prayers each day. This cannot be done in a synagogue limited \nto ten persons indoors as this is an activity involving more than just the minyan. All the men and \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 43 of 153\nboys must participate, not just ten men. And it must be done in a synagogue around the Bima, the \ncentral table. \n147.  The 7th day of the festival which this year falls out on Friday October 9th is known \nas Hoshana Rabbah or Great Hoshana. On Hoshana Rabbah all the scrolls are removed from the \nArk and 7 circuits are made. It is a solemn prayer service with the Cantor donning a white garment \ncalled a Kittel as on Yom Kippur. It is actually the culmination of Yom Kippur and is considered \na final chance to pray for a good year and forgiveness following Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. \nEvery man and boy must participate, not just a minyan of ten. \n148.  The Eighth day of the Holiday (Saturday October 10) is named Shemini Atzeret. \nSpecial  prayers  are  said  and  in  addition  to  the  readings  from  the  Torah  the  Book  of \nKohelet (Ecclesiastes) is read. The Yizkor prayers for the departed are recited in the Synagogue. \nPerhaps most important, the Prayer for Geshem is said. Geshem is translated literally as Rain, but \nin addition to rain it has the deeper meaning of general sustenance and livelihood. This prayer is \nalso a solemn prayer and part of the High Holyday theme with the Cantor once again donning the \nKitel for this prayer while the whole congregation, not just ten men, attends and participates, \nthis time including all the women. \n149.  The ninth day of the Festival is known as Simchat Torah (literally translated as \nHappiness of the Torah). This is perhaps the most joyous day of the year in a synagogue when \nOrthodox Jews celebrate the completion of the reading of the Torah, the Five Books of Moses. \nThey make seven circuits with the Torah Scrolls around the Bima, in large groups comprised of \nall the men and boys, with women also involved by their presence.  \n150.  Simchat Torah is a particularly important religious educational observance for \nchildren. Jewish adults have deeply fond memories of accompanying their fathers to Shul with the \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 44 of 153\nother celebrants. Such memories keep the spark of faith alive in Jewish hearts.  All of this is \nprohibited by EO 202.68 and the CAI, which allows only ten men in the synagogue and forbids \nany larger gathering for this purpose, including the children.  Even outside, such a gathering would \nbe totally forbidden—not even one person—under threat of a $15,000 fine. \n151.   Afterwards, the congregants read the last portion of the Torah from one Scroll. \nThen they read the first Chapter of Genesis from another Scroll and finally a third section dealing \nwith the holiday from a third scroll. These things, which involve all the men, with the boys and \nwomen also attending, cannot be done if only ten people are permitted in the synagogue and \neveryone else in the believing community is excluded, and when even attempting to do this \noutdoors is met with a $15,000 fine. \n152.  It is also customary on this day for all men, not just ten of them, to get a chance \nto make a blessing on the Scroll, and so the last portion is repeatedly read until all the men in the \ncongregation have that chance. Even boys who are under the age of Bar Mitzvah are accorded this \nopportunity—the only day of the year when this is done. This vitally important act of worship \ncannot be limited to ten adult males while the rest of the community excluded from this opportunity \nfor a great blessing. \n153.  For these reasons, with EO 202.68 and the CAI, defendants are directly attacking \nthe religious observance of Hoshana Rabbah, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah, three of the \nmost important holidays celebrated in the synagogue after Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. These \nprayers, readings and services cannot be said by an individual. They require, first of all, a minyan. \nBut limiting the congregation to the minyan while excluding the whole community—men, wives, \nchildren, relatives and others—from these crucial celebrations, and forbidding them entirely \noutdoors, is a radical deprivation of the free exercise of the Jewish religion. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 45 of 153\n154.  Immediate injunctive relief is needed to ensure the uninterrupted completion of \nthese vitally important religious observances as they conclude over this weekend. \n155.  EO 202.68 and the CAI also interfere in the religious education and formation of \nthe children of plaintiffs Mayerfeld, Perr and Schonbrun. This is shown by the following facts. \n156.  Plaintiff Mayerfeld has a son, age 17, who attends a Jewish school in the “Red \nZone,” which is ordered closed effective October 9 under Order 202.68.  Plaintiff Mayerfeld has \ntwo other children whose Jewish school has been closed even though it is not in the Red Zone for \nfear of retaliation by Cuomo and di Blasio, as plaintiff Mayerfeld has been notified by school \nauthorities.  \n157.  Plaintiff Perr has three school age children, two of whom, boys aged 13 and 11, \nattend Jewish schools in the Red Zone, now ordered closed. \n158.  Plaintiff Schonbrun has three school age children, an 11-year-old boy and two girls, \nages 6 and 7, who attend Jewish schools in the Red Zone, now ordered closed. \n159.  All of the aforesaid Jewish schools are scheduled to open on Monday, October 12, \nafter the Jewish holidays described above, but now face forced closure if they dare to open contrary \nto Cuomo’s and di Blasio’s will. Immediate injunctive relief is necessary to ensure the continuation \nof the Jewish education of plaintiffs’ children. \n160.  Finally, plaintiff Mayer’s personal knowledge of the neighborhoods encompassed \nby the “Red Zone” in which he resides, worships and educates his children shows that the “Red \nZone” and the “Orange Zone” are anti-religious gerrymanders targeting Brooklyn’s Orthodox \nJewish Community. This is shown by the following facts. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 46 of 153\n161.  Looking at the Red Zone from the perspective of someone who lives there, it is \nobvious that meticulous attention was given to precisely carve out the areas that are heavily \npopulated by Orthodox Jews.  \n162.  First of all, East 7th 8th and 9th streets between 18th Avenue, Cortelyou Road, Ocean \nParkway and Coney Island avenue in that same Kensington Neighborhood are in the Orange Zone \nwhere many Orthodox Jews are living on those streets. There are two Large Yeshivas in that \nOrange area, one on East 9th Between Ditmas and Cortelyou and One on Ditmas and Ocean \nParkway. Most and perhaps all of the students and teachers in those two schools come from the \nRed Zone. \n163.  The Red Zone on the North Eastern side abruptly cuts off and turns orange at Coney \nIsland Avenue and Avenue H. The Orange area North of Avenue H is a predominantly Muslim \nArea, which is known as little Pakistan, and that area is not heavily populated by Orthodox Jews. \n164.  In the South Eastern Corner where plaintiff Mayerfeld lives, the Marine Park \nNeighborhood the Red Zone abruptly ends on Filmore Avenue and Marine Park and is cut in half \nbetween Red and Orange. It is an ethnically mixed neighborhood, but the bulk of the Orthodox \nJewish inhabitants live in the Red Zone north of the Fillmore Avenue line.  \n165.  The rest of the Boundaries of the Red Zone also closely follow heavily populated \nOrthodox Jewish Areas. For example, the area between McDonald Avenue and Coney Island \nAvenue and Quentib Road and Avenue Y, is heavily populated by Sephardic Orthodox Jews of \nprimarily Syrian decent but also Moroccan and Iranian.  \n166.  The remainder of the Red Zone is Borough Park and Midwood, populated mostly \nby Chassidic Jews in Borough Park and non-Chassidic Jews in Midwood together with Sephardic \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 47 of 153\nJews. The dominant Chassidic sect in Borough Park is the Bobovs, but many other sects are also \npresent including a large Satmer community. \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n(Free Exercise of Religion) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n167.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1-166  \n168.  Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs compel them to preside over or participate \nin religious gatherings and religious education in keeping with the teachings and requirements of \ntheir respective religions. \n169.  The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects \nplaintiffs’ religious activities. \n170.  The challenged limits on gatherings under defendant Cuomo’s executive orders as \nalleged in the incorporated original Complaint and this Amended Complaint, including 202.68 and \nthe CAI, substantially burden plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion by forbidding them to preside \nover or participate in any religious gathering in their respective houses of worship, religious \nschools or elsewhere in the State of New York, save under arbitrarily oppressive conditions that \nstrictly limit the size of their congregations. \n171.  The challenged regulations are impermissibly underinclusive because they are \nriddled with exceptions while purporting to be facially neutral, fail to prohibit secular activity that \nendangers the purported state interest in “public health” equally or to a greater degree than the \nprohibited  religious  conduct,  and  burden  religious  conduct  while  not  affecting  substantial \ncategories of conduct that are not religiously motivated.  \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 48 of 153\n172.  The challenged regulations are therefore not a neutral policy or law of general \napplicability and cannot be sustained unless narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest \nof the highest order.  \n173.  The challenged regulations are not rationally related to a compelling state interest, \nnor are they the least restrictive means of accomplishing the purported compelling state interest of \nreducing the rate of community spread of COVID-19.   \n174.  The undefined terms “non-essential gatherings” and the terms involved in EO \n202.68,    have  no  rational  relation  to  the  goal  of  “containing”  COVID-19,  which  can  be \naccomplished even more readily in a church, synagogue or religious school, where people can sit \napart in pews or desks, than in the mass demonstrations defendants condone or in retail or office \nenvironments rife with direct interpersonal contacts and contact with common surfaces touched by \ninnumerable other people. \n175.  The challenged regulations irrationally undermine the purported state interest by \nfavoring numerous forms of secular activity that pose a greater risk of viral transmission than the \nprohibited religious gatherings and religious schools. \n176.  Defendants have less restrictive means of achieving any legitimate interest served \nby the challenged regulations, those being the same conditions on which they allow retail and non-\nretail businesses to operate: i.e., “social distancing” and sanitization. \n177.  As  the  pleaded  facts  demonstrate,  the  challenged  regulations  irrationally, \ninvidiously, and without any legitimate, much less compelling, state purpose discriminate against \nreligious activities in favor of secular and commercial activities, including mass demonstrations \nthat violate the same regulations. \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 49 of 153\n178.  Both facially and as applied to plaintiffs, the challenged regulations violate the Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n179.  In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs will be irreparably \nharmed.  \n180.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Violation of Freedom of Speech, Assembly and Expressive Association) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n181.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations in ¶¶ 1-178. \n182.  The First Amendment protects plaintiffs’ right to peaceably assemble together with \nthe members of their congregations or in religious schools.  \n183.  Plaintiffs’  religious  assemblies  are  intertwined  with  speech  and  expressive \nassociation, meaning the right to associate with others of like mind for a protected purpose. \n184.  Because the undefined term “non-essential gatherings” employed in the challenged \nregulations has no rational relationship to the goal of “limiting the spread” or “containing” \nCOVID-19 which can be practiced more easily, or no less easily, in a church, synagogue or \nreligious school than in the retail and office environments and mass demonstrations the defendants \nfavor, the challenged regulations operate solely to discriminate arbitrarily against groups of people \nbased on their social, political or religious purposes rather than any alleged lack of “social \ndistancing.” \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 50 of 153\n185.  Defendants have less restrictive means of regulating gatherings for the stated \npurpose of “reducing the rate of community spread of COVID-19.” \n186.  The  challenged  regulations  do  not  serve  any  compelling  or  even  significant \ngovernment interest and are not narrowly tailored to achieve any legitimate state purpose. \n187.  The challenged regulations impermissibly infringe freedom of speech, assembly \nand  expressive  association  without  serving  any  compelling  or  even  significant  government \ninterest.  \n188.  In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs will be irreparably \nharmed. \n189.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights.  \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment  \n(Equal Protection – Substantive Due Process) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n190.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in ¶¶ 1-\n187. \n191.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution guarantees equal protection of the laws, which requires that the State not treat the \n“suspect class” of religion differently from the class of similarly situated people or pass laws that \nburden First Amendment rights. \n192.  The challenged regulations treat the class or subclass of people who exercise \nfreedom of religion by gathering with others for that purpose, including plaintiffs, differently from \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 51 of 153\nthe similarly situated class of people who gather with others for secular purposes, including the \nmass demonstrations defendants have exempted from their regulatory regime. \n193.  Moreover, the class of those who gather for religious purposes in churches, chapels, \nsynagogues or religious schools is plainly less subject to the risk of infection or transmission than \nthose engaged in mass demonstrations, commercial transactions involving crowded offices, large \ncrowds every day of the week, physical exchanges, and common surfaces touched by potentially \nmillions of people, which makes the suspect classification targeted by the challenged regulations \neven more irrational and invidious. \n194.  The challenged regulations cannot survive the strict scrutiny required of suspect \nclassifications under the substantive due process component of the Equal Protection Clause as they \nare far from neutral and generally applicable and are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \nstate interest. \n195.  The challenged regulations, both facially and as applied, also violate plaintiffs’ \nfundamental rights to freedom of speech, assembly and expressive association as alleged above. \n196.  Even if the challenged regulations did not involve a suspect classification or violate \nfundamental rights, their severe restriction of religious gatherings, while permitting numerous \nsecular and commercial gatherings unrestricted as to size, including the mass demonstrations of \nwhich defendants approve, is not even rationally related to a legitimate state interest and thus \ncannot survive even rational basis analysis under the Equal Protection Clause. \n197.  Alternatively, the challenged regulations cannot survive heightened scrutiny under \nthe “hybrid-rights” theory the United States Supreme Court has recognized for purposes of Equal \nProtection analysis when, as here, multiple rights are violated by a purportedly neutral law. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 52 of 153\n198.  The  challenged  regulations  thus  violate  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including its substantive component. \n199.   In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs will be irreparably \nharmed.  \n200.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights.  \nCOUNT IV \nUltra Vires State Action  \nin Violation of Federal and State Constitutional Rights  \n \n201.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in ¶¶ 1-\n198. \n202.  Defendant Cuomo relies on New York State Executive Law § 29-a as the basis for \nthe challenged regulations.  Said statute provides in pertinent part as follows: \n1. Subject to the state constitution, the federal constitution and federal statutes and \nregulations, the governor may by executive order temporarily suspend specific \nprovisions of any statute, local law, ordinance, or orders, rules or regulations, or \nparts thereof, of any agency during a state disaster emergency if compliance with \nsuch provisions would prevent, hinder, or delay action necessary to cope with the \ndisaster…. \n \na. no suspension shall be made for a period in excess of thirty days, provided, \nhowever, that upon reconsideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, \nthe governor may extend the suspension for additional periods not to exceed thirty \ndays each; \n \nb. no suspension shall be made which does not safeguard the health and welfare of \nthe public and which is not reasonably necessary to the disaster effort;… \n \ne. any such suspension order shall provide for the minimum deviation from the \nrequirements  of  the  statute,  local  law,  ordinance,  order,  rule  or  regulation \nsuspended  consistent  with  the  disaster  action  deemed  necessary…. \n \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 53 of 153\n203.  Executive Law § 29-a provides no authority for the plethora of detailed positive \nedicts Cuomo has promulgated by executive fiat, regulating virtually every aspect of the lives of \nsome 8 million people in the State of New York, including plaintiffs’ exercise of First Amendment \nrights as pleaded above. \n204.  Before March 3 of 2020, § 29-a conferred no authority Cuomo to issue free-\nstanding, positive directives regulating every detail of the public lives of New Yorkers on the \npretext of an outbreak of disease. On that date, however, days before Cuomo declared his never-\nending emergency, he signed into law an ad hoc amendment to § 29-a that expanded its definition \nof “disaster emergency” to include “disease outbreak” and authorized him not only to suspend or \nmodify laws and regulations temporarily but also to issue “any directive during a state disaster \nemergency…”  Cf. NY LEGIS 23 (2020), 2020 Sess. Law News of N.Y. Ch. 23 (S. 7919) \n(emphasis added) \n205.  This sweepingly overbroad grant of authority to issue “any directive” is still \nsupposed to be limited not only by “the state constitution, the federal constitution and federal \nstatutes and regulations” but also as follows: \n…no suspension or directive shall be made which is not in the interest of the health \nor welfare of the public and which is not reasonably necessary to aid the disaster \neffort; … \n \n…  any  such  suspension  order  or  directive  shall  provide  for  the  minimum \ndeviation from the requirements of the statute, local law, ordinance, order, rule or \nregulation  suspended  consistent  with  the  goals  of  the  disaster  action  deemed \nnecessary; and \n \nN.Y. Exec. Law § 29-a (2), (b) and (e). \n \n206.  As facts pleaded demonstrate, Cuomo and the other state-level defendants acting \nunder his authority have cast aside these restraints over the past five months not only by suspending \nor modifying various laws but also by issuing separate “directives” that violate the constitutional \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 54 of 153\nrights to free exercise of religion, freedom of assembly and expressive association, freedom of \nspeech, freedom of movement and  freedom from interference with personal autonomy and bodily \nintegrity. \n207.  The challenged regulations are ultra vires the very statute on which defendant \nCuomo relies in that Cuomo has legislated rather than confining himself to the limited process of \ntemporarily suspending certain laws, orders, rules or regulations by executive order and making \ndirectives of “minimum deviation” from existing laws and regulations. \n208.  Alternatively, the state legislature has abdicated its legislative authority to Cuomo \nin violation of the New York Constitution’s requirement of a separation of powers, “implied by \nthe separate  grants  of power to  each  of  the  coordinate  branches  of  government.” Clark  v. \nCuomo, 66 N.Y.2d 185, 189;  N.Y. Const., art. III, § 1; art. IV, § 1. \n209.  The New York State Constitution provides for a complete separation of powers \namong  the  three  “co-ordinate  and  co[-]equal  branches”  of  government:  the  executive,  the \nlegislative, and the judicial. N.Y. Const., art. III, sec. 1; art. IV, sec. 1; and art. VI. \n210.  Article III, Section 1 of the New York State Constitution provides: “The legislative \npower of this state shall be vested in the senate and assembly.” N.Y. Const., art. III, sec. 1. \n211.  Nowhere in the New York State Constitution is the Chief Executive, defendant \nCuomo, given or delegated any legislative authority. Rather, “The [G]overnor shall have power to \nconvene the legislature, or the senate only, on extraordinary occasions. At extraordinary sessions \nconvened pursuant to the provisions of this section no subject shall be acted upon, except such as \nthe [G]overnor may recommend for consideration.” N.Y. Const., art. IV, sec. 3. \n212.  The Governor’s exercise of emergency power during the COVID-19 outbreak \nrequired that defendant Cuomo convene the legislature on an extraordinary basis in order to take \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 55 of 153\nwhatever legislative measures were deemed reasonably necessary according to the separation of \npowers. Defendant Cuomo has never convened the legislature. \n213.  In  any  case,  the  results  violate  not  only  federal  but  also  state  constitutional \nprotections, including the New York Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of worship (Art. 1, § 5), \nfreedom of speech and assembly (Art. 1, §§ 8 and 9) and equal protection of the laws (Art. 1, § \n11). \n \n214.  Defendant Cuomo’s ultra vires acts, as enforced by him and the other named \ndefendants should be declared void and unenforceable, as they constitute state action in violation \nof all the constitutional rights the challenged regulations infringe, as pleaded above.  \n215.  In  the  absence  of  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  voiding  and  enjoining \ndefendants’ ultra vires acts, plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed.  \n216.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court grant the following relief: \nA. A temporary restraining order, followed by a preliminary and final injunction \nrestraining defendants, and all those acting at their direction or in concert with them, \nfrom enforcing any closure of, or gathering limits on, plaintiffs’ houses of worship \nand religious schools, either indoor or outdoor, including the limits on “non-\nessential gatherings” and occupancy of houses of worship and religious schools in \neffect at the time of this Court’s injunction of June 26, 2020 and now in effect with \nEO 202.68 and the CAI; \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 56 of 153\nB.

We've had clusters in the past stemming from factories, churches, bars and other\nlocations.

And that was the ﬁrst super spreader event, so we're quite\nfamiliar with this, and when there's a cluster, we are very aggressive on it and we're oversampling in the clusters,\"\nGovernor Cuomo said. \"We've deployed rapid testing machines. So you have two infection rates that you want to pay\nattention to: the statewide numbers and then the cluster numbers. All of this is a stark reminder that we need to stay smart\nand vigilant - wear a mask, socially distance, follow the public health guidance - because this thing is not over.\"\nNew York State continues to track clusters with a particular focus on the top 20 ZIP codes in which there have been\nhotspots. Within the 20 hotspot ZIP codes, the average rate of positive tests is 5.5 percent. The rate of positive tests for\nthe remainder of New York State, not counting the top 20 ZIP codes, is 0.82 percent. The rate of positive tests for all of\nNew York State, including the top 20 ZIP codes, is 1.02 percent. These 20 ZIP codes contained 23 percent of all positive\ncases in New York State yesterday, but represent only 6 percent of the state's population.\nThe Governor noted that 20 hotspot ZIP codes reported an average 5.5 percent positivity rate. Areas that had high\npositivity rates will be subject of focused testing eﬀorts including access to rapid testing machines.

The extension of this emergency regulation helps to ensure that cost-sharing is not a barrier to in-network\nmental health services during COVID-19 for health care workers, ﬁrst responders, transit workers, food services workers,\nretail workers at essential businesses, and other frontline essential employees, who are required to directly interact with\nthe public while working during this continuing public health emergency.

We’re looking at the statewide numbers and\nwe are hyper-focused on what we call hotspots. Where was the first hotspot in the\nUnited States of America? Trivia contest.\nSpeaker 1: (01:21)\nNew Rochelle.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:21)\nYay, you win. Three questions today. We had the first hotspot cluster in the United\nStates, New Rochelle, New York. So we know this well. We’re oversampling in the\nhotspots and with testing all across the state. The 20 hotspot zip codes, 5.5%. Our\nhotspot zip codes are where many states are right now. And you’ll see it in some of\nthe numbers. Statewide positivity rate is 1. 01 outside of the hotspot zip codes. One\npercent is an unbelievably low infection rate. And as we are going into the fall, I\nbelieve it’s going to be practically unsustainable, but it’s remarkable that we’re that\nlow right now.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (02:25)\nIf you roll in the hotspot zip codes, which now distorts the balance of the sample,\nit’s 1.2. Number of deaths, eight. They are in our thoughts and prayers. Statewide\nwhite hospitalization 636. ICU, 149. Statewide intubation, 70. Context first, we’re\ncoming into the fall. We have been told since early March, beware the fall. Beware\nthe fall. Weather gets colder. More people move in doors. Flu season. Schools open.\nSchools opening are almost a predictor of increased infection rate. Colleges opening\nturned out to be more problematic than we thought, colleges opening. SUNY’s\ndoing a great job. That’s why Dr. Jim Malatras is here today. If SUNY was not doing\na great job, Dr. Jim Malatras would not be here today. That’s how you know that.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (03:29)\nSo the fall is a challenging period, as we know. And we expect to see the infection\nrate go up in the fall. Context. All over the globe, the infection rate is going up. All\nover the globe. Countries that were doing remarkably well are now seeing spikes.\nU.S.A. overall is going up. Israel has a real problem. EU has a real problem. Canada\nhas a problem. Argentina has a problem. The UK has a problem. And the UK,\nremember, they were up, they were down. They’re up again. You look across the\nnation. States are all going up. So context, beware the fall has been right. New York\n1 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Press Conference Transcript October 5 ... https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-pres...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 96 of 153\nis the outlier in all of these international and national trajectories. We are theEXHIBIT 3-2\nexception to the rule. This is the one situation where we want to be the exception to\nthe rule. Other states up, other countries up.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (04:51)\nThat in and of itself is a complicating factor because New York state is not\nhermetically sealed. We put a quarantine in effect, I know, but people still drive in.\nIt’s still water through a screen. People are still coming in on flights. International\nflights. People in Texas are coming in. People in California are coming in. People in\nNew Jersey are coming in. So that’s an added problem for us. If you look at the\nhotspot infection rate yesterday, western New York Is a hotspot. Yesterday was a\ngood day, 1.2%. Broom has a hotspot. Came out of a pub restaurant, but a Broom\nhas a hotspot. Orange County, Rockland County, Brooklyn, Nassau could be on\nthere with a hot spot in one section of Nassau.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (05:55)\nThese clusters have to be attacked. Picture that map as a map of dry grass and\npicture those hotspots as embers within the field of dry grass. That’s how I think of\nit. The only course is to run to those embers and stamp them out immediately and\ndramatically. That’s why I don’t sleep at night. So you have to attack the clusters.\nHow do you attack the clusters? Testing, Testing, testing, testing. Get the facts,\nfollow the data, contact tracing off the testing. Testing in itself doesn’t tell you\nanything, just that you have a problem. Contact tracing helps you solve the\nproblem. And enforcement. Enforcement. “Oh, that’s so harsh enforcement.” Yeah,\nit’s not. Enforcement is kind. You know why? Because enforcement saves lives.\nThat’s what enforcement does.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (07:24)\nLack of enforcement is not kind. I believe that. I believe that. And I have said that\nfrom day one. And the state has been bullish on this and it has worked. It’s worked.\nIt’s not like I’m putting forth a proposition. Enforcement works. Any rule is only as\ngood as the enforcement. Don’t speed. Are you enforcing it? Don’t litter. Are you\nenforcing it? Any rule is only as good as the enforcement, especially when it’s a rule\nthat people don’t want to follow. Seat belts. Only as good as you enforce it. Don’t\ntext and drive. Only as good as you enforce it. I say to people, when I see them\ntexting and driving, I say to them, I pull up, I roll down my window. I say, “Hi, you\nare texting and driving. That is a violation of the law. I know because I passed that\nlaw.” It’s only as good as the enforcement.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (08:39)\nWe’re New York tough. What’s within tough? Smart. Follow the data. Follow the\nanalytics. Disciplined. Do the enforcement. Stick to the rules. Stick to what’s\nworking. I’ve said this 100 times. But at this point in my life, I’ve said everything\n100 times. Too many local governments are not doing enforcement. Warnings are\nnot enforcement. “Put a mask on, or I will ticket you,” is not enforcement. “Store\nowner, you’re not supposed to have this many people in your store.” We are past\nthat. Everybody knows the rules. You don’t have to pull over a car today and say,\n“You’re not supposed to text and drive.” They know that. They know that. What you\nwind up saying is, “I got away with it.” We’ve been saying you get away with it for\ntoo long. And we have lived through this repeatedly.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (09:54)\nThis was bars and restaurants. How many, the times did I come before you and say,\n“Bars and restaurants are a problem. We have gatherings in front of bars and\nrestaurants. Local governments have to do the enforcement.” Week after week after\nweek. And it got worse and worse and it got worse. I even said, “Forget it. I give up.\n2 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Press Conference Transcript October 5 ... https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-pres...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 97 of 153\nThe state government will do bars and restaurants.” And we put together a taEskXHIBIT 3-2\nforce. We did over a thousand violations. And you know what? Compliance with\nbars and restaurants is markedly better than it has been. When was the last time\nmany of you wrote a story about bars and restaurants and gatherings in front of\nbars and restaurants. Why? Because the owners know they’ll lose their license. “Oh,\nthat’s tough.” No, we saved lives. I believe that. We saved lives. New York City has\nclusters. Queens, Brooklyn. We also have clusters akin to this, Orange, Rockland, a\nlittle bit in Nassau.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (11:14)\nI just got off the telephone with Mayor de Blasio, Comptroller stringer Council\nSpeaker Johnson, UFT President Mike Mulgrew. We had a very good conversation.\nIt was a collaborative, positive conversation. It’s a complex situation, works on a\nnumber of levels. There are a number of issues. And we talked through them. We\nhave clusters where the viral infection rate is higher by 3-4%. Where does the virus\nmainly transmit? Dr. Zucker was on the phone, we asked him that question.\nSchools, which are also the place where different communities come together. So\nmy child goes to a private school, your child goes to a public school. But our\nchildren are on the same hockey team or on the same soccer team. Or they play\ntogether in the playground. Schools can be locations of transmissions.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (12:29)\nReligious gatherings, especially in these communities. New Rochelle, first hotspot,\nwas an Orthodox Jewish man who went to a temple, hundreds of people. And then\na wedding. Hundreds of people. Orthodox Jewish gatherings often are very, very\nlarge. And we’ve seen what one person can do in a group. Look at this Rose Garden\nwith the President, by the way. Outdoor event. “Oh, those are safe. Outdoor events.”\nNo, no, no. Safer than indoor. Nobody ever said safe. Safer than indoor. And look at\nthat growing list of people at a Presidential Rose Garden event who were\ntheoretically tested before they came in. How many people could have been\ninfected? One, two? And look at the spread in the Rose Garden. You know what\nhappens here. You’ve seen it over and over again.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (13:43)\nThird are public spaces. These are basically in priority order. Fourth are businesses\nwhere consumers may interact, but that is way down on the list, relatively. And the\nkey to all of these areas is enforcement. All of them. We have rules for all these\nareas. We have rules for all these areas in place now. Well, then how’s it increasing?\nBecause people are not following the rules, that’s why. On schools. My number one\nconcern has always been schools. I said to the parents of this state, ” I will not send,\nI will not allow your child to be sent to any school that I would not send my child.”\nPeriod. And you have my personal word on that. I’ve spoken to thousands of\nparents who have called up and said, “I’m worried about sending my child to\nschool.” I said, “I won’t allow a school to open that I wouldn’t send my child to.”\nThat’s my test. On the schools in these areas, not all of them have been tested.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (15:03)\nSo we don’t have data on all of the schools in these hotspot clusters. That troubles\nme. And on the telephone call, we were all basically in agreement. They have\nsampled some schools in the clusters, but not all the schools. And these are the\nhotspot clusters. So if you have to prioritize testing, you want to go to these schools\nfirst because you know they are in hotspot clusters. So some schools in those\nclusters, we have not yet done testing on. Better safe than sorry, I would not send\nmy child to a school in a hotspot cluster that has not been tested where I did not\nhave proof that the infection rate was low in that school. I would not send my child.\n3 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Press Conference Transcript October 5 ... https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-pres...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 98 of 153\nI am not going to recommend or allow any New York City family to send theiEr cXhHildIBIT 3-2\nto a school that I wouldn’t send my child. We’re going to close the schools in those\nareas tomorrow. And that’s that.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (16:23)\nReligious gatherings. The City’s proposal does not close religious institutions. We\nknow religious institutions have been a problem. We know mass gatherings are the\nsuper spreader events. We know there have been mass gatherings going on in\nconcert with religious institutions in these communities for weeks. For weeks. I\ndon’t mean little violations. You’re only supposed to have 50, they had 55. I’m\ntalking about, you’re only supposed to have 50 outdoors, they had 1,000. These are\npictures from the past couple of weeks. And these are just emblematic.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (17:41)\nYou’ve all seen pictures like this for weeks. What did you think was going to\nhappen? What do you think was going to happen? Religious institutions are mass\ngatherings and raise the greatest potential. It’s schools and it’s large mass\ngatherings. Schools, frankly, because they’re students and that’s where our heart\ngoes, our priority goes. But in terms of numbers, it’s large gatherings and large\nreligious gatherings are large gatherings. These have been going on for weeks. You\ndon’t see masks and you see clear violation of social distancing. When were these\npictures from?\nSpeaker 2: (18:47)\nThe one on the right is more recent than the one on the left.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (18:51)\nOkay. But they’re in the recent past. So this has been going on for weeks. We’ve\nbeen talking about it for weeks. If we’re going to keep religious institutions open, it\ncan only be with two conditions. One, the community must agree, whether it’s the\nJewish community, whether we’re talking about Black churches, whether we’re\ntalking about Roman Catholic churches, the religious community has to agree to the\nrules. And they have to agree that they are going to follow the rules and they have to\nagree that they are going to be a full partner in the enforcement of the rules. That’s\ncondition one. I’m going to meet with members of the ultra-Orthodox community\ntomorrow. I want to have that conversation directly myself. This cannot happen\nagain. If you do not agree to enforce the rules-\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (20:03)\nIf you do not agree to enforce the rules, then we’ll close the institutions down. I am\nprepared to do that. Second, after we receive the agreement, an agreement is only\nas good as the enforcement. We have to have real enforcement in these clusters and\nthe other statewide clusters. The enforcement will help the community. If the rule is\nno more than 50% of the people in a black church, I want someone at that door\nwhen 50% enter the church. A person there who says to the pastor, “You agreed to\nfollow the rules. That’s 50%, that’s it, or we close it down.” It does not work without\nenforcement, but both of those conditions have to be in place. If I do not have the\nagreement from the religious community directly as a starting point, then we will\nclose down the religious institutions. If they do agree to do it in partnership, then I\nwant a real enforcement capacity. We’re not going to make the same mistake twice.\nTomorrow, I’m going to meet with the larger congregations, New York City,\nRockland, Orange, Nassau, and have that conversation. That’s step one. If we get\npast step one, then we need enforcement in place. Enforcement is enforcement. I’ve\nsaid this to you. I have this conversation with the local officials all day long.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (22:09)\n4 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

That’s not enforcement. Well, we do public educatioEnX. HIBIT 3-2\nThat’s not enforcement. There is no person in the state of New York who needs you\nto tell them, at this point, “You must wear a mask.” They know they must wear a\nmask. There was no need for public education. Find me the person who says, “I\nnever heard that. Really? You have to wear a mask? I never heard it.” Find me the\nperson in the state who says that. Enforcement is enforcement, okay? New York\nCity only did 26 enforcement actions. Enforcement is here’s a violation. New York\nCity deployed 1,000 people for days, three days, 1,000 people for three days is\nwhat? Is 24,000 personnel hours. 24,000 personnel hours? You only did 26\nenforcement actions? That’s not enforcement.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (23:26)\nWe have to be more aggressive. I understand that it’s in politic. I understand the\nsensitivity in the community now, but I also understand you will see people die if\nwe don’t do more enforcement. I also understand that we have learned this\nexperience before. This is the bars and restaurants story. Week, after week, after\nweek, we have to do the enforcement. Nobody’s doing the enforcement. Week, after\nweek, after week, nothing changes. The state took it over. I did 1,200 enforcement\nactions, 228 immediate license revocations just on bars and restaurants.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (24:15)\n1,200. Now, was I happy about doing 1200 enforcement actions? No. Immediate\nlicense revocation is very difficult. That business basically closes. People lose their\njobs. You don’t want to do this, but life has options, my friends. You don’t do this,\nthe virus spreads, people die. You tell me, which is the nice and kind and\nresponsible course of conduct? 1,200 enforcement actions just on bars and\nrestaurants. That’s enforcement. The state is going to take over the enforcement\noversight in all the hotspot clusters, okay? Local governments will need to provide\nus with personnel, but the state will take over the enforcement with the local\npersonnel. I do not have enough state personnel to supplement every local police\ndepartment in the state. To give you an idea, we have about 5,000 state troopers.\nThere are about 35,000 NYPD, okay?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (25:47)\nMost of this enforcement is also going to be done by health department officials,\nother agency-type officials. I said from day one to the local officials, I understand\nthis is all tough stuff, and politicians like to make people happy as a general rule. I\nlike to make people happy as a general rule too. I just have a superseding rule,\nwhich is, I like to keep people alive. I’d rather you be alive and angry at me, than\nhave people happy with me. I’m elected to do a job and be responsible, and that’s\nwhat I want to do. I said from day one, blame me. Blame me. You have to revoke a\nbar owner’s license? Blame me. We have to close a temple because it’s over 50%? I’ll\ndo it. We have to close a Roman Catholic church? I’ll do it. I had to close the St.\nPatrick’s Day parade? I did it. I’ll do it, but none of these rules are going to make a\ndarn if you don’t have the enforcement.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (27:04)\nAnother issue that came up on the phone, which is right. Targeting by zip codes is\nimperfect. The virus doesn’t travel by zip codes. Neighborhoods and communities\naren’t organized by zip codes. Zip codes can be arbitrary and can leave out some\ncommunities that are infected. Zip codes can include communities that have a low\ninfection rate. This is a zip code in Brooklyn. The white areas are inside the zip\ncode, but we have the infection rate by address. You have areas in that zip code that\naren’t infected. You then have areas outside the zip code that are infected. The zip\ncode as a template is rough justice, but only rough justice. We can refine that. That\n5 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

Look at the actual cases that you have again,E bXy HIBIT 3-2\naddress and make sure you’re including the relevant zone, not just a zip code, you\nhave to go a little bigger.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (28:34)\nYou go a little bigger. If you don’t have an infection rate in certain communities,\ndon’t include those infection rates. The zip codes as a starting place, but we then\nwant to have a team of epidemiologists and demographics people actually look at\nthe maps and where the infection rate is and make sure we’re drawing the right\ncircle or the right borders. The controller raised that point, and it’s a good point.\nThe health officials agree. When we did New Rochelle, we did a circle. Every other\nstate, every other country does a political subdivision, a county, a city, a town. The\nzip codes are not the best template to use, and we want to refine that template.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (29:46)\nFor example, we’re closing schools in zip codes, but the school district is different\nthan the zip code. Just because the school is located in that zip code, doesn’t mean\nthe students come from that zip code. The catchment area can go the opposite\ndirection from the zip code. Right now, that’s the best we have with the New York\nCity data, but we’re going to refine this. Non-essential businesses, public spaces.\nRemember, it’s mass gatherings, public spaces, schools should close, but we need to\nhave the right template designed before we can do that with full accuracy. The only\naction we’re taking today on this data, we are using the zip codes to close those\nschools tomorrow. If we expand the regions and that then includes other schools,\nwe’ll then notify people as soon as we know, but for today, or we have other zip code\n… That is the zip code data, so it’s the schools in those zip codes. As we refine it,\nwe’ll let you know.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (31:01)\nIn total, schools close tomorrow. I’m going to be meeting with the Orthodox\ncommunity tomorrow. See if they will agree to live and abide by the rules and\nadvocate compliance. If the rabbi advocates compliance, that would be a very\npositive start. If the communities don’t agree with the rules, which is possible, I had\nsome conversations where some religious leaders believe they have herd immunity,\nwhich is not true. Some people believe have followed politics and think that masks\nare ineffective, and this is all a hoax. That’s not true, but if they don’t agree, then the\nstate will take action. If they do agree, and we have the ability to enforce, then we\nwill go with reduced guidance, 50% rules, primarily outdoors, et cetera.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (32:13)\nWe’re going to do statewide enforcement, state-supervised with local resources, but\nenforcement has to be enforcement. We need better templates, geographic\ntemplates and zip codes. We also need better data on these schools in these hotspot\nzip codes, more testing, faster testing, so we find out exactly where we are. We need\nto establish criteria for reopening. When do the areas reopen? What testing data,\nwhat percent over what period of time? That has to be established. In closing, New\nYork City is not unique, we have this all across the state. Again, we started with the\nfirst hotspot and it’s going to continue. It is the way of the world. It’s the way this\nvirus moves. It starts in a cluster. It always starts in a cluster wherever, and the\nquestion always becomes, can you stop it in the cluster? Can you tamp out the\nembers before it’s a fire out of control? That’s always the question. That was the\nquestion in Wuhan, China.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (33:41)\nCould you get to Wuhan and stamp it out before it spread? That was the question in\nNew Rochelle, and we did stamp it out in New Rochelle, by the way. Every state is\n6 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

It’s testing and it’s enforcement. ThEatX’sHIBIT 3-2\nwhat we’re down to. We’re New York tough, smart, disciplined. Just to reiterate, the\nfall is perilous. We have to stay vigilant. When we talk about 1%, I understand that\nit is a hyper ambitious goal. You have to remember, we were at 20% infection rate\nat one time, and I understand that we are surrounded by higher infection rates.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (34:37)\nNew Jersey is 2.1. They were three last week, okay? Connecticut is 1.3. They were 1.5\nand Connecticut has always been a relatively easier situation than New York. I’m\nenvious of my friend, Governor Ned Lamont. Pennsylvania is at 7.9%. We have\npeople coming in and out of here every day from these states. We have people flying\nin from other countries, so 1% hyper ambitious, unrealistic. Keep the bar high, raise\nthe goal, and we do the best we can, but I’m also realistic. These are the facts that\nsurround us. That’s why right now you take out our hotspots. We have one of the\nlowest infection rates in the United States of America, and that is the gold standard.\nThat’s what we want to try to achieve. Even if it is not fully realistic, but New\nYorkers have done an amazing job, highest infection rate at one time, lowest in the\nnation. God bless New Yorkers. I want to make sure as governor, I’m doing\neverything I can to honor and fulfill their sacrifice and their toughness and their\nlove for each other, and we’re doing that. Questions?\nSpeaker 3: (36:26)\nGovernor, on the schools specifically, do you have a sense of how many that is total\nin Brooklyn and Queens? What will the duration be, and why did you think now is\nnot a time to really go after the essential businesses? I mean, do you think you could\ndo that as soon as this week?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (36:40)\nEssential businesses are like number four in the spreader priority, right? Schools,\nmass gatherings, religious institutions, especially in these communities, public\nspaces, businesses, but the businesses are not mass spreaders. You’re talking about\nsmall stores. We’re not talking about large box stores in these communities, right?\nWe’re talking about small stores, the difference whether you had six patrons or\neight patrons at any given time, and we want to … The businesses will be really\neffected by the lines you draw. We’re going to … I believe we can draw better lines\nthan a zip code. Before we create confusion, on one side of the street, you’re open,\none side of the street, you’re closed. Why? When the zip code line is on this side of\nthe street, not that side of the street.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (37:51)\nLet’s get the right template, and then we’ll take those actions. The big generators,\nschools, it’s children. There are about … Do you remember the numbers of schools\nwe said were in these areas? Mike said it, how many were tested?\nSpeaker 4: (38:13)\nApproximately 28 or-\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (38:15)\n28 or 30, they were like 180 or something like that. Many of the schools in these\nclusters just have not been tested yet. That gives me concern and they are possible\ntransmission places. Then it’s going to be the mass gatherings and the religious\ninstitutions. Those are the pictures, right? That’s what it is. It is those super-\nspreading situations, and that’s what we have to get a handle on .\nSpeaker 5: (38:42)\nGovernor, the mayor had proposed-\n7 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

Cuomo: (38:50)\nYes.\nSpeaker 5: (38:52)\nThe mayor had proposed Wednesday to close the schools. You’re moving that up\none day. What is the reason for that? His argument was, ” We’re just about through\nwith giving every child that in-person day in the blended model, Wednesday is\nwhen it makes sense.”\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (39:07)\nWe had a phone call now. Well, Mike Mulgrew recommended it. Speaker\nrecommended it. The controller recommended it. I think what was the\ndeterminative fact was there has not been testing in those schools. Some of the\nschools in the hotspot zip codes have been tested, but some have not. How can you\nsend children into a school in a hotspot zip code, when you know that you don’t\nhave any information as to whether or not it’s safe?\nSpeaker 5: (39:44)\nWell, you sent them in today. You could’ve made this decision yesterday on Sunday.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (39:50)\nYeah. Except I wasn’t involved, right? I had the conversation today, so I can’t move\nany faster than this.\nSpeaker 5: (39:56)\nJust a quick follow up, you’re not closing the schools in Orange and Rocklin, the\nother hotspots, just the New York City schools, why?\nSpeaker 5: (40:02)\n… Auckland, the other hotspots, just the New York City schools, black.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (40:03)\nWe may close those schools. We don’t have the same level of problem. But I’m\ngoing to be speaking to those community leaders also tomorrow, because it’s\nroughly the same situation. If the religious leaders do not agree to abide by these\nrules then we will close the religious institutions, period. If they agree, I will only go\nforward if I know we have a state supervised enforcement action. Because I’ve seen\nthis movie and you’ve seen this movie, 26 enforcement actions is not enforcement.\nAnd I understand it’s difficult, but I want a person monitoring the attendance in a\ntemple, in a black church, in a Catholic church. And if the rules are violated then\naction has to be taken at that moment. And that enforcement has to be in place.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (41:16)\nThe challenge is I don’t have, on the state side, enough people to say, we’ll do all the\nenforcement. That would be easy. And I would do that in a heartbeat. I didn’t even\nhave enough people to do the Bars and Restaurants Task Force. We took people\nfrom all over. I have environmental inspectors on that task force. But it also proved\nit worked and both conditions have to be in place if we’re going to allow the rigid\nreligious institutions to stay open. If one or two doesn’t happen, then we’ll close\nthem. I don’t have a problem with that.\nZach: (42:04)\n8 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

Cuomo: (42:15)\nIt’s individuals but you want to prioritize your impact. Mass gatherings have the\nmost potential to do a super spreader, right? Rose Garden, New Rochelle. So\ncertainly mass gatherings first. If I’m an investigator and I’m out there and I want\nto make a difference in the world, mass gatherings, mass gatherings at religious\ninstitutions, mass gatherings in parks. By the way, mass gatherings of young people\nat parks in front of NYU, right? College kids coming out 2, 300 to party. Those are\nall mass gatherings and that’s a priority for compliance. School’s priority. And then\nyou go down, businesses and then individuals.\nZach: (43:22)\nSo would they be authorized then to ticket people who are walking on the street\nwithout masks, for example?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (43:28)\nOh, they are now. Zach…\nZach: (43:31)\nBut is it [crosstalk 00:43:31] for them to enforce it in that way? You say it’s not the\nhighest priority, but-\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (43:34)\nZach, it is now. You walk down the street without a mask. You’re within six feet of a\nperson, you are in violation of the law.\nZach: (43:43)\nBut will they enforce it through this new task?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (43:46)\nYes. And they should be enforcing it now. That question should not be a question.\nThe answer is of course. NYPD should be enforcing it now. New York City\nDepartment of Health should be enforcing it now. You should have no question in\nyour mind that if you walk down the street and you’re not wearing a mask and a\npolice officer sees you, you’re going to be ticketed.\nLouis: (44:15)\nGovernor, doesn’t Orange County and Rockland County have higher infection rates\nthan-\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (44:20)\nIt depends. It depends on where.\nLouis: (44:21)\nIf they have high infection rates why not close the schools there as well?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (44:26)\nWell, that’s what we’re going to be talking about. And there’s some disparity in what\nthe infection rates are and we want to drill down on the data. But it’s the same basic\nconversation we’re having here. Excuse me one second.\nLouis: (44:48)\nDo you believe you have the legal authority to close down religious institutions\n9 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Press Conference Transcript October 5 ... https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-pres...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 104 of 153\n[inaudible 00:44:49] wasn’t there a recent court order barring you from doinEg XthHatI?BIT 3-2\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (44:52)\nWe believe we have the legal authority. We will assert the legal authority. We have\nbeen sued by the religious organizations. Our legal authority was upheld. I don’t\nlike getting into a litigious situation with the religious community. I have enough\nquestions that I have to answer when I get to the Pearly Gates. I don’t want to also\nbe questioned as to why I was sued by the Catholic church or the Jewish community\nfor closing temples. So I have enough issues on my plate. But yes, we believe we\nhave the legal authority. Did you want to say something?\nMelissa DeRosa: (45:38)\nNo. I would just say Louis, you have to remember back. So when we did New York\non pause back on March 20th, we banned all mass gatherings, more than 10 people,\nand we closed all non-essential businesses. It was the mass gathering rule that was\nupheld. And so technically during that period of time, individuals could walk into a\nreligious institution and pray, but you couldn’t have more than 10 people in a\nreligious institution regardless of occupancy at any given time. What changed was\nwhen we began to do the phased reopening and we started to say that businesses\ncould have 50% capacity, we said houses of worship could have 33% capacity.\nMelissa DeRosa: (46:15)\nThe lawsuit was over whether or not it was fair that in a religious institution, you\nwere taking a different standard than any other business. And the court at the time\nwent with the businesses. But what the governor’s describing as if we’re moving\ninto a situation where we’re indiscriminately saying a mass gathering number in a\ncertain region based on infection rate would be lowered, let’s call it 10 people. I’m\nnot saying that’s what it’s going to be. But just for example sake, 10 people, then\nyou’re not saying a religious institution is being treated differently than any other\ninstitution because the law would be applied evenly throughout. Does that make\nsense?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (46:52)\nCan you put up the picture of the two congregations again?\nMelissa DeRosa: (46:58)\nSorry Louis.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (46:58)\nWait Louis. Isn’t Louis [crosstalk 00:47:00]\nLouis: (47:00)\nOn the non-essential businesses, could you clarify your stance or do you mean\nagainst shutting them down and closing them or you mean against the mayor’s\nproposal? What exactly are you waiting for on the non-essential businesses?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (47:14)\nOn the non-essential businesses, also on the schools, we all agree we need to do a\nbetter template than a zip code. A zip code is not the best definition of the\napplicable zone, right? You have information beyond the zip code level. You have\naddresses, you have census track data. So if you have to draw a… I use the word\ncontainment zone. In New Rochelle I got into all sorts of trouble. If you have to\ncircumscribe an area, make sure you have the right boundaries. And before you\nmake a determination about essential businesses or not, make sure you have the\nright geographic area because you will be closing businesses.\n10 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Press Conference Transcript October 5 ... https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-pres...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 105 of 153\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (48:20) EXHIBIT 3-2\nAnd if you don’t do it right, it’ll just be arbitrary and capricious and then they’ll\nbring you into court. And they’ll say, it’s just because I happened to be in the zip\ncode and one side of the street, the deli’s open on the other side of the street, the\ndelis closed. What sense does that make? All you’re doing is bringing the people\nacross the street. So what is the best area? Once we have that done, then I don’t\nhave a problem with closing the essential businesses. Then you determine for how\nlong by what data, et cetera. But even all of this comes back to do you have the\nenforcement capacity to enforce any of this? All these great rules, but do you have\nthe enforcement capacity?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (49:18)\nSo I know we’re giving you a lot. First action, close the schools tomorrow, use the\nzip codes because that’s all you have for now. If you come up with a different\ntemplate, I’m sorry, when you come up with a different template, if it includes\nadditional schools, include additional schools. Meet with the Orthodox community,\nsee if they will agree to live by the rules. If they do, then we need to put in together a\nstatewide enforcement task force and the local governments have to give me enough\npersonnel to make it work. And that will be statewide including New York City.\nThen redraw the geographic boundaries. See what’s in and see what’s out. Then put\nthat out there. And that’s all.\nSpeaker 7: (50:17)\nSo governor, why do you think Mayor de Blasio has not been able to pull the trigger\non enforcing these things?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (50:25)\nYou’d have to ask the mayor.\nSpeaker 7: (50:26)\nBut I’m asking you.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (50:28)\nI know you are asking me and that’s why I am saying you have to ask the mayor.\nLook, I think it’s not just the New York City issue, it’s local governments plus or\nminus. Some are very aggressive by the way and do a great job. But some have been\nvery reluctant. And that’s why I had to do the Bar and Restaurants Task Force. I\nmean, how many times did you sit here and I saw the skepticism in your face when\nyou would say, “Here he goes again with his bar and restaurant rant.” But yes. How\nmany weeks did we say, look at the crowds, look at the pictures, Look at all the\nyoung people in front of the bar, do something, they did nothing? Part of it is the\nenvironment, the NYPD tension with the community. Do they want to engage in\nthis kind of activity? Then you go to… the mayor’s been using the sheriff. The\nsheriff’s office is 150 people. What do you think 150 people are going to do? I mean,\nit’s just not enough. And then you have the political overlay.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (51:48)\nYou’re dealing with government saying to religions, you shouldn’t have more than X\npeople in your church or your mosque or your temple. That’s an politically\nuncomfortable situation. I have to say to the Orthodox community tomorrow, if\nyou’re not willing to live with these rules, then I’m going to close the synagogues. I\nhave had a 30 year relationship with the Orthodox community. It goes back to my\nfather. I have a very close personal relationship with them. This is the last thing I\nwant to do. Forget the politics, I don’t care about that anymore. Personally, I don’t\nwant to have this conversation. It’s a difficult conversation. And you’re right on the\nline of government intrusion on religion. So it’s hard. I didn’t want to close down\n11 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

It’s hard, but I know in New York City’s caEseX, H26IBIT 3-2\nenforcement actions, that with this rampant ongoing violation. You think 26\nenforcement actions was going to stop it? No.\nSpeaker 8: (53:26)\nThe state is going to oversee the enforcement with local personnel. What does that\nmean and why is it going to be different than what you just described?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (53:43)\nWhat we did with the bars and the restaurants is I used state personnel from all\nacross the state and it was run by the state police and the SLA. Here we’ll have a\ntask force put together, run by the Department of Health and the state police. And\nlocal governments will need to assign people to that task force who are supervised\nby that task force, deputized by that task force to give out state summonses as\ndirected by the supervisors of that task force, right? So you can be a Nassau County\nDepartment of Health official. You are assigned to the task force. I’m the state\nperson running the task force. I say, you’re going to be stationed in front of St.\nPeter’s Church. The capacity is 150. You stand at the front door. When they go over\n75, you close the door and call me. And if you have any problem, the state police\nofficer is down the block and he’ll come help you. That’s your job. You are from the\nDepartment of Health, Nassau County, but you were assigned to a state task force.\nSpeaker 8: (55:12)\nSo the state is telling the local officials where to be?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (55:17)\nSay it one more time. I’m sorry.\nSpeaker 8: (55:18)\nThe state is telling the local officials where to be?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (55:24)\nNo. The state is determining where to be primarily based on the hotspot clusters,\nright? Here in New York City, we knew where the problems were. We knew it. So\nwe’re all looking at the same areas because we all have the same data on the zip\ncodes in the communities. We just haven’t been aggressive enough on the\nenforcement. And I said from day one, blame me. I’m willing to do the enforcement.\nI have a different political perspective. I think it’s kind and right and responsible as\nopposed to harsh and I’m going to make enemies. And the state taskforce is going to\ndo it, but I don’t have enough people. I don’t have enough personnel. So I need\nthem to assign me personnel.\nSpeaker 8: (56:19)\nI’m just wondering, if the locals didn’t do it before, what makes you think you’re\ngoing to do it now?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (56:26)\nOh, because they’re not doing it in their name. It’s my name that they’re doing it in.\nAnd that makes all the difference.\nSpeaker 8: (56:34)\nThat’s going to make the difference.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (56:36)\nOh yes, because there’s no political recriminations to them. I’m going to say to the\nOrthodox community tomorrow, if you don’t agree, then we will have to close down\n12 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

I’m going to have to say that to the black ministerEs.XHIBIT 3-2\nThat’s not a comfortable conversation.\nMelissa DeRosa: (57:05)\nJust to punctuate the governor’s point. So just so we’re all clear. Section 20 of the\nexecutive law regarding emergency response delegates the authority on\nenforcement in an emergency to the locality. So let’s just use that as the baseline. To\ngo on the governor’s point on the SLA, what was happening a lot over the summer\nwas everyone was seeing on social media reports of bars and restaurants and drive-\nin concerts, whatever it may be, in clear violation of the rules that we put into place\nin order to keep the virus contained in New York. We would reach out to the local\nhealth departments, local governments, say, “What are you doing about this?” And\npolitically, it was very difficult for them. Oh my friend’s cousin owns that bar. This\nperson I know owns that restaurant. It was just this one time. And so the governor\nput together the SLA Task Force. The hope being from the SLA Task Force was that\nwe would go after individual bad actors before having to blanket punish an entire\nindustry.\nMelissa DeRosa: (57:55)\nSo rather than in that moment in July and August say we’re closing all bars and\nrestaurants, indoor, outdoor, everything, we tried to surgically go after the\nindividual bad actors. And it was incredibly effective. To the governor’s point, you\nnow see dramatic change in compliance. At the same time, my phone was ringing\noff the hook, Robert’s phone was ringing off the hook from local politicians, state\nlegislators, assembly and senators in these areas saying, you closed down my\nfriend’s brother’s bar, you’re being gratuitous. It was just one violation. You’re\ngoing after and finding these people. And we said, “Yeah. We are because we lived\nthrough mass graves on Hart Island and we lived through sirens in this city and we\nlived through death and we’re not doing it again. So we will take it over.” And when\nthey say, “Well, we’re upset.” You can say, well, the governor’s office is terrible.\nThey’re going to continue doing it and they’re going to continue doing it no matter\nwhat we say so you better just follow the rules. And we have seen a dramatic change\nin compliance as a result. And that’s what we’re trying to accomplish.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (58:50)\nLet me do it another way for you. Just turn the picture a little bit so I don’t have\nevery local official calling me this afternoon. First, many local governments have\ndone this very well. Second, this is a very different situation because this is a state\nlaw that has been delegated to them to enforce. State law, which is a new state law,\ndelegated to them to enforce. They don’t close down religious institutions. It’s not\nwhat they do. They don’t close down bars. They don’t close down restaurants. They\ndon’t close down drive-in concerts. They don’t tell people to wear masks. They don’t\ntell people you can’t gather 100 people in a park. They have never done this before.\nIt’s not what they do. COVID, we passed these new state laws you are-\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:00:03)\n… COVID. We passed these new state laws. You are delegated to enforce them. It’s\nyour job. We’ve never done this before. It’s not what we do. My local police don’t\nclose down bars, and we don’t tell people to wear masks. I know you’ve never done\nit before, but you have to do it. We don’t go into a church and say, “You’re violating\nthe 50% rule. Close the church.” We don’t do that. I know, but you have to do it\nnow. That’s for the bureaucracy to accept that and pivot and do it, and these are all\ndifficult laws. Think about it. You’re a local politician. Pick one. Close temples, close\nmosques, close schools, close Catholic churches. No, thank you.\nSpeaker 3: (01:00:56)\n13 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

Or is it the community at large, meaning within the zip code?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:01:06)\nIt may be both. We don’t know. And that’s what we want to establish. Dr. Zucker’s\ngoing to work with the city and some other outside experts to make that\ndetermination.\nSpeaker 9: (01:01:20)\n[inaudible 01:01:20] timeline on the boundaries? We know of two concerts that are\nplanned in Brooklyn this week in the ultra-orthodox community. Are you going to\nhave to close down larger venues this week?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:01:30)\nWell, first of all, it shouldn’t be happening anyway. Period. It violates the existing\nlaw. You have to enforce the law. State-wide, I’ve gone through this in Suffolk. They\nhad a music concert, fundraiser in one of the towns in the Hamptons. You can’t\nhave a concert mass gathering today. You can’t. I don’t care what zone you’re in.\nYou can’t do it.\nSpeaker 5: (01:02:14)\n[inaudible 01:02:14] Mayor DeBlasio yesterday announced a plan, asked for your\napproval, set of presser for 12:00 today. You all scheduled one for 10:30, then 11:45.\nI understand you had to meet with him first, or [inaudible 01:02:28] over the\nphone, discuss it, your team and his team, but I wonder if you could explain to the\npublic why you couldn’t have a joint announcement, a joint press conference. We in\nthe world could ask you all these questions together and have a united front. I think\na lot of people have a lot of frustration about that division. Can you explain it to\nthem?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:02:49)\nNo. You have a federal government. You have a state government. You have a city\ngovernment. You have county governments. This is a situation where by law is\ngoverned by state law. The mayor said that yesterday. The mayor said, “I have a\nplan. I’m going to propose it to the state.” Okay. Now, I have to review it. I have to\nsee what the speaker says. I have to see what the Hasidic community says. I have to\nsee what the police say. I have to see what the controller thinks. I have to see what\nmy health officials think. It’s a complex issue. Right?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:03:29)\nAnd he did announce it, so people now want to know. It’s caused a lot of\naggravation. My phone has been ringing off the hook. Has said, “The community is\nvery concerned. Parents are very concerned. What’s happening? What do you\nknow?” So, I want people to know as soon as possible, especially your schools are\nclosed tomorrow, so you can figure out what to do tomorrow. And this is the most\nrecent update. And I spoke to him about it. I spoke to him, Mulgrew, the controller,\nthe speaker, and this is what we agreed we would do. This is the plan of action. You\nare hearing it as soon as I could get it to you.\nSpeaker 10: (01:04:17)\nGovernor, what kind of testing going forward do you want to see in schools? You\nsaid there’s not enough going on in the city. At least the city schools were doing\nmonthly random testing, a certain percentage. Do you want to see something more\nthan that? And then, how about the issue [inaudible 01:04:34] religious schools in\nthese areas, do you want to see more specific testing?\n14 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Press Conference Transcript October 5 ... https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/new-york-gov-andrew-cuomo-pres...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 109 of 153\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:04:39) EXHIBIT 3-2\nI would say two things. I would say three things. First, I probably know more\ntesting than any non-testing expert in the state, and I know more about testing than\nI ever wanted to know. And we do more testing than any state in the United States.\nBut I know what I don’t know, and I want to get the input. We have the best global\nexperts that we work with. I want to hear what they think. But number two, if you\nknow you have a hotspot zip code, test that school. Test that school. If you’re going\nto send a child into a school that you know is in a hotspot, in my opinion, you have\nto test that school before you would ever send a child into a zone that you already\nknow is a hotspot.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:05:40)\nSecond, random monthly. What is the interval between the tests? In other words,\ndoes that mean you’re going to random… You have 30 days, 31 days, let’s say, is it\nall in the first week, maybe? All in the last week? Is it spaced out every week? What\nare the intervals between the test? Because this goes like this, right? “Well, we did a\ntest on day one, but then we didn’t test again until day 10, and lo and behold, from\nday one to day 10, it went up four points.” No, I think random is fine. Monthly, I\ndon’t know what that means, monthly. Does that mean you could just do it once a\nmonth? I understand daily. I understand weekly. I don’t really understand random\nmonthly because it sounds like it’s a month. If you’re saying there could possibly be\na month between tests, but that doesn’t work for me. I can tell you I would not\naccept that plan for my school.\nSpeaker 10: (01:07:03)\nWill there be an impact to indoor and outdoor dining in these cluster areas?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:07:06)\nThere could be. There could be. We’re reviewing it.\nSpeaker 10: (01:07:10)\nDo you think it will be this week?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:07:12)\nYeah. We need to come up with the template because I don’t want to confuse\nbusinesses. You’re in, you’re out, you’re in. There’s been enough of that. When\ngovernment comes up with a plan, stick to the plan, don’t change the plan. It\nsuggests to people confusion and incompetence. So, what’s the right geographic\ntemplate? What’s an essential business now? What’s the indoor dining rule now?\nWhat’s the mass gathering rule now? And then, how do you enforce it?\nSpeaker 8: (01:07:48)\nYou’re the governor of the state, the mayor’s the mayor of the city. That doesn’t\npreclude you from speaking together. Does it? Why can’t the two of you, as\n[inaudible 01:07:59] suggest, come together, one message from one place instead of\nthese different voices from different places?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:08:10)\nLook, I’ve been with the mayor many times. He has a schedule. I have a schedule. I\nwanted to get you the information quickly. I didn’t put out this plan. He did. So, if\nanything, you’d want to ask him why didn’t you propose a plan to the state and\nwork it out first and then just announce a final plan, as opposed to announcing a\nproposed plan that the state then had to react to. I don’t know. Why do you sit in\nthat seat? I don’t know. People have their own styles and their own way of doing\nthings, but that’s all it is.\n15 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

I wonder if you could speak to the mask wearing culture in this\nroom, in your office, and what it says, as you talk about the need for enforcing laws\nand being consistent, what it’s telling to those communities who might, I feel it’s\nprobably pretty safe to say, are tweeting even as we speak about your presence\ntogether without masks.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:09:28)\nWe have sat in these seats six feet apart, socially distanced, without masks since\nCOVID started. The rule is six feet apart, and that’s what we do. This state has been\na model of mask wearing. We were the first state to mandate masks in the United\nStates of America. We have done more advertising for masks than any state in the\nnation. We’ve done national public service announcements on mask wearing. I’ve\nbeen the most outspoken governor against the president for not mask wearing. I’ve\nbeen the most outspoken governor against the CDC and NIH and the vice president\nfor not condemning the president’s failure to wear masks. I visited cities all across\nthe country and advocated mask wearing.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:10:25)\nI said that this nation and its health officials made a terrible mistake by telling this\ncountry early on not to wear masks. The surgeon general tweeted they are\nunnecessary. Whenever I am in a situation where I should wear a mask, I do wear a\nmask. Don’t confuse people by putting forth your own mask wearing rules. Do that\nwith your family. If you are six feet apart, you do not need to wear a mask, let alone\nthese people are all tested on basically a daily basis.\nZach: (01:11:07)\nWhat about aerosols, though? Isn’t there new evidence that the virus spreads\nthrough the air?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:11:11)\nThe rule is six feet social distancing. Do you want to change the rule?\nZach: (01:11:19)\nWho’s determining this rule? You’ve said that the CDC can’t be trusted for public\nhealth guidance, but there is lots of new research that shows the virus can spread\nthrough [crosstalk 01:11:28].\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:11:28)\nThe CDC’s rule is six feet, the state law is six feet. If there’s new data, and we should\ncome up with a new law, then the CDC could do that. That Department of Health\ncould do that. But the law is six feet. That is the law. The law is a mask. The law is\nnot a helmet. If new data comes out and says, “You should wear a helmet,” and then\nwe’ll have a helmet law. The law says a mask, not ear muffs because we don’t\nbelieve the virus goes in your ear. Maybe somebody will do an article saying it can\ninvade your ear and then we’ll have a new mask with ear muffs. Last question.\nSpeaker 11: (01:12:13)\nWhat’s your level of concern that the outbreak is going to continue to increase?\nWhat’s to stop, if we do close out more indoor dining, what’s to stop people that live\nin hotspots from going down the block, or catching the train and flocking outside-\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:12:27)\nNothing. Nothing. Nothing. Which is why the health officials are very worried about\nhow you draw the lines. Because what the health officials will tell you is if you don’t\n16 of 18 10/7/2020, 10:48 PM\n\nNew York Gov.

That’s why the\ngeographic template is very important. This has never been done before. Every\nother government closes subdivisions. The entire city, the entire county. Brooklyn\ncloses.\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:13:25)\nNow, theoretically, you want to drive into Manhattan, you can drive into\nManhattan, but you have to drive into Manhattan or take a train into Manhattan.\nYou want to go into Queens to eat, you can go to Queens, but you have to go to\nQueens. You get this small area, you just walk across the street. You walk two\nblocks, and we were trying to contain you. That’s why New Rochelle, what we did\nwas a one mile circle, and it had a margin around it. So, in other words, the circle\nwas wide enough where there was a buffer between the infected community and the\nnon-affected community. But yeah, that is a very real concern, and there’s a very\nreal question of, if you do this wrong, are you just spreading, inadvertently, the\nvirus? So, how you draw those lines is very important.\nSpeaker 11: (01:14:40)\nWhat would enforcement look like, then, in that situation? Is that going to be\n[inaudible 00:01:14:44]?\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:14:44)\nNo, the enforcement winds up the same. You draw the lines, and then the\nenforcement is the enforcement. And the enforcement is indoor dining is only\nsupposed to be 25%. You have 30%, you get a ticket. It’s supposed to be outdoor\ndining… Whatever the rules are, they enforce in that template, but you’re right,\nmake sure that template is right.\nLouis: (01:15:07)\nGovernor, so you’re saying there aren’t enough data from some schools [inaudible\n00:15:10], some schools aren’t testing enough or don’t have the adequate capacity,\nshould those schools have been allowed to reopen in the first place? [crosstalk\n01:15:18].\nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:15:23)\nWe didn’t say inadequate data. There’s no data. These schools opened and have\ndone no testing. That was the city plan that the New York City parents signed off on,\nand the New York City teacher’s union signed off on. They had this random\nmonthly testing plan, but they did not have a provision that said if the higher\ninfection rate zip codes will be tested first. So, I think this has been educational for\nthem, and that’s something you want to look at. My point is, you have no data on\nsome of these schools in these hotspot zip codes, would you send your child to\nschool tomorrow, to a school that you knew had no data on infection rate but didn’t\nknow it was a hotspot zip code, would you send your child?\nLouis: (01:16:44)\n[inaudible 01:16:45].\nSpeaker 12: (01:16:44)\nBut good answer.

Marcus and R. Borchardt\nWednesday, October 7, 2020 at 4:42 am | א\"פשת ירשת ט\"י Updated Wednesday, October 7, 2020 at 7:06 pm\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announcing new restrictions Tuesday in COVID-19 hotspots in Brooklyn and Queens.\nNEW YORK - Jewish leaders said they were blindsided by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s announcement on\nTuesday afternoon that houses of worship in the areas with coronavirus outbreaks would be restricted, with some allowed\nas few as ten worshipers. This came just hours after the Governor convened a conference call with community leaders,\nasking them for help in reducing occupancy in shuls to 50%.\nDuring the call with Jewish leaders Tuesday morning, Cuomo indicated that if community leaders enforced the 50%\nguideline, shuls would not be closed. He said, “The current rule is no more than 50%. In any indoor gathering 50% of\ncapacity…in a synagogue in any venue, any private venue. It’s 50% of capacity. That’s the current law. We have to follow\nthat law. If we don’t follow that law then the infection rate gets worse. Then we’re gonna have to go back to close down.\nAnd nobody wants to do that. But I need your help in getting the rate down, and the rate will come down. If we follow the\nrules on the mask and the social distancing and the 50%.”\nLater that day, the governor announced that houses of worship in coronavirus ‘hotspots’ could allow a maximum of ten\npeople at services, and non-essential businesses in those areas would be closed, in addition to his Monday\nannouncements that schools in hotspots would be closed.\nA participant on the call who spoke to Hamodia on the condition of anonymity expressed frustration with how it\ntranspired, and stressed that Cuomo never indicated he was prepared to take such extreme measures when it came to\nshuls. “The governor stabbed us in the back by announcing this unprecedented lockdown, and he has the audacity to say\nthat he discussed it with Orthodox leaders and they were very receptive. This is just unbelievable. This is something that\nour community will never forget. We were looking forward to the opportunity to finally speak directly to the governor, as\nwe were promised.”\nThe participant added that the only questions Cuomo answered were several “softballs,” which he later found out were\npre-approved by the governor’s office, which added to the overall feeling of mistrust.\n1 of 3 10/8/2020, 3:09 PM\n\nJewish Leaders ‘Blindsided’ by Cuomo’s Shul Restrictions | Hamodia.com https://hamodia.com/2020/10/07/jewish-leaders-blindsided-cuomos-shul-...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 129 of 153\nThe participant attempted to address Cuomo by pressing the button he was told to use to put a question fEorXwaHrdI, BbuIt Tit 3-5\nnever went through.\n“I along with my fellow community activists and leaders on the call were shocked to hear the governor ask his operator:\n“are there any other questions” and then we hear operator respond “there are no other questions sir,” and the call was\npromptly ended.” The participant later found out the questions had to be pre-approved and believes his attempt to raise a\nquestion was deliberately ignored.\n“Had the governor taken my question,” the participant said, “he would have heard how detached from the reality on the\nground he is. He would have perhaps heard how his draconian proposals are unfair to people who already suffered\nthrough the virus. In fact, we were ready to propose that over the holidays only people who have tested positive for\nantibodies should participate in shul gatherings. Instead the governor pretended that he was ready to listen to us…he lied\nto us. After telling us that he’ll limit shul participation to 50% capacity, he placed a limit of 10 people. We all feel used,\ntargeted and enraged.”\nJewish organizations and community leaders have condemned what they deem to be Cuomo’s duplicitous way of going\nabout the situation. Many expressed frustration they were not given a warning during Cuomo’s conference call.\nCommunity activist Chaskel Bennett was not on the call, but spoke to those who were. He said to Hamodia, “What\nGovernor Cuomo did today was blindside community leaders who had already been working hard to tamp down on rising\ncoronavirus numbers.” Bennett noted, “there was absolutely no discussion of reducing houses of worship to ten, and\ncommunal leaders feel completely betrayed by the governors unilateral decision. It has alienated an already skeptical and\nsuspicious community, making it that much harder for leaders to get the community to buy in on important safeguards\nneeded to stop the spread. The anger and dismay is real. Our schools and shuls are the lifeblood of the community. I\nworry this sets us back significantly in the ongoing fight against the deadly virus.”\nIn response to Hamodia’s request for comment as to why the governor indicated on the call that he would stick to a 50%\nlimit but then enacted a 10-attendee limit, a Cuomo spokesperson said, “We were still in discussions with the\nepidemiologists at the time and they made clear that preventing large social gatherings is the key to breaking up these\nclusters.” The spokesperson did not respond to Hamodia’s request for comment on allegations about the governor only\ntaking pre-approved questions.\nIn a statement, Senator Simcha Felder, Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein, Councilman Chaim Deutsch and Councilman\nKalman Yeger strongly condemned Governor’s Cuomo’s decision. They noted that though they represent the\nneighborhoods facing coronavirus outbreaks, they have not be involved in he decision making process on how to best\naddress the situation.\nThey vowed to continue to educate their communities on the importance of social distancing and masks, and indicated\nthey would push back against the shul closures, stating “Americans are constitutionally permitted to worship freely, and\nGovernor Cuomo may be assured that we intend to exercise that right without his interference.”\nIn a statement published by Agudah, the organization indicated it would once again sue the Cuomo administration for\nreligious discrimination. The organization added that however they felt about the new policy, they urged compliance with\nhealth guidelines.\nFollowing the outcry after Tuesdays events, there were protests that night in Borough Park. At the protest, City\nCouncilman Yeger told the crowd, “We are not going to be deprived of the right that we have in America, like everybody\nelse in America, the right to observe our religion.”\nA group of teenagers among the protestors blocked a city bus and pushed around a news photographer. According to\nsocial media reports, a counter-protester, himself an Orthodox Jew, was injured during the protest and hospitalized.\n—\nsmarcus@hamodia.com\nrborchardt@hamodia.com\n<< Previous Next >>\n2 of 3 10/8/2020, 3:09 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 130 of 153\nEXHIBIT 3-6\nSkip Main Navigation\nThe Official Website of the City of New York\nText Size\nPowered by  Translate\nSearch\nMayorFirst LadyNewsOfficials\nOctober 6, 2020\nMayor Bill de Blasio: Good morning, everybody. We are at a crucial moment in this city, crucial\nmoment in our fight against the coronavirus. Now for seven months, the city's waged a battle and I\nwant to say to all of you, New Yorkers have been heroic in this struggle, fighting back against the\ncoronavirus consistently. Now we have a challenge. We see a rise in cases in certain parts of our city,\nand we have to get ahead of this. We have to bring everything to bear we can. We’re going to have to\nbe tough about it and that's why I put forward a plan to address the situation and yes, it involves\ntough restrictions, nothing we want to do, but the kind of thing we need to do and do quickly to get\nahead of the problem, to keep this problem limited, to address it in a matter of weeks and not let it\nspread further.\nSo, look, we know so much more now than we did at the beginning of this struggle back in March and\nApril when we had so little testing, when we had so much less knowledge about this disease, our fight\nwas very, very difficult, and yet this city did fight back and get to a much better place. Now we have\nthe advantage of much more knowledge, much more testing, and much more understanding amongst\nthe people of the city of what they have to do and they've shown it time and time again. These\nrealities should be great advantages as we fight back these specific problems in specific areas. But\nagain, it will all come down to you, to everyday New Yorkers doing the right thing for yourselves, for\nyour families, for your communities, by practicing the basic rules, basic vision that has worked for us\nover and over again, the wearing the mask, the social distancing, just doing the smart, basic things\nthat have everyone does together, we turn the tide in our favor.\nSo let's give you a picture now of what's happening right now in this city. We have a new map that\nprovides a sense of where the challenges are, where the hotspots are, and right now, again, we have\nnine ZIP codes where we have seen the positively level for the coronavirus above three percent for\nseven consecutive days. It remains nine ZIP codes. Then we have our watch list and that's tier two\nwhere we're watching areas that are in danger of entering that top tier of a particularly troubled ZIP\ncodes. We have a new ZIP code we're adding to that watch list and that is 11206 South Williamsburg,\nthat brings the watch list total to 13. So, again, we're staying stable with nine in the top category\n1 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 131 of 153\nwhere we need the most action, the most restrictions, 13 that are being watched, andE thXoHseI B13I Tdo 3 n-o6t\nneed to end up in that top category. They do not need to experience those deeper restrictions. So,\nyou can see the number of days consecutive over three percent, thank God, not yet into that\ncategory, but we're warning people in those communities to really buckle down, to take all the right\nprecautions, to take it seriously. You do not want to see these restrictions in your community. You can\ndo something about it. You don't want to see small businesses closed in your neighborhood. You can\ndo something about it. Right now, there is time to turn things around. That's why we're providing this\ninformation to the public in an urgent manner.\nSo, in terms of the nine ZIP codes I've proposed, I think the way forward, clear sharp restrictions\napplied quickly. Now obviously with our schools in the nine high risk ZIP codes, those schools, both\npublic and non-public are closed as of this morning. This will be for several weeks, the faster we\naddress the problem on the ground, the faster the community participates, the quicker we can get\nthose schools open again, and as little as two weeks, hopefully no more than four weeks, but we all\nhave a lot of work to do. Now, again, we chose to close the schools out of an abundance of caution,\nthankfully in our school system, including in the effective ZIP codes, tier one, tier two, we are not\nseeing any unusual problems, anything out of the ordinary in our schools, thank God. And we\ncontinue to do testing outside of schools and in schools, in those effective ZIP codes, testing\nteachers, staff, watching for problems. I'll give you example, just the last few days we've gotten 1,351\ntest results from 35 schools in those nine top ZIP codes and only two positive tests among the 1,351\nresults we've gotten so far.\nSo, get – excuse me – our educators, our staff school communities are doing a great job. They're\ndoing the right thing. They're being smart about things. Folks understand the hand-wash and the\nhand sanitizer, the social distancing, the face mask. If sick, they're staying home, people are doing\nthis the right way and it's proven by the testing we're seeing at our schools. So we're going to keep\nthat testing going in the 13 ZIP codes on the watch list, constantly moving from school to school each\nday, to keep a clear picture on what's going on. Now, the plan related to the nines ZIP codes,\nobviously presented at the State. We had conversations yesterday morning. I spoke with the\nGovernor and our teams have been talking throughout the day yesterday, constructive conversations,\nproductive conversations that are going to continue into this morning, and we need obviously a clear\ndecision in the course of today. So, we can move forward. The plan I've presented is the template to\naddress this. The State is looking at that template. We understand is their ultimate decision. They can\nmodify as they see fit, but the important thing is to come to a decision quickly so we can get going.\nWe are prepared to implement as soon as tomorrow morning in those nine ZIP codes once we have\nthe sign off from the state.\nNow, in the meantime, again, what everyone can do, you're going to have this constant question, how\nlong do these restrictions have to be in place? And I'm going to be talking to a lot of people in the\ncommunity, I have been already, and my message is the same, you can keep it to a matter of weeks,\nbut everyone has to participate. Everyone has to be part of the solution. If we all do this right, which\nwe did before in much tougher circumstances, we contain this problem to a limited part of the city for\na limited period of time, then we reopen in those places and keep moving forward. If we do it wrong, it\nkeeps spreading into surrounding ZIP codes and that endangers the whole city. We cannot let that\nhappen. So, everyone has to be part of the solution.\nNow, today is a Tuesday and as always, we talk about testing on Tuesday, get tested Tuesday, look\nagain, what works? Testing, testing, testing, we can say it so many times. You cannot say it enough\ntimes, because there's still a huge number of New Yorkers who've never been tested even once. It\nhelps this whole city to get tested because it gives us a picture of what's going on and helps us\n2 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 132 of 153\nunderstand where our challenges are and what to do about them. So again, if you havEeX nHevIeBr IbTe e3n-6\ntested, please go get tested right away. If you haven't been tested a long time, please go get tested. It\nis fast. It's easy. We need New Yorkers, not just in those nine ZIP codes or those 13 on the watch list,\nbut everywhere to get tested. The faster we get the truth, the faster we can act. Now, everybody we're\nexpanding testing capacity throughout the city, constantly getting it where it's needed most, but\nremember we have over 200 sites all over the city. Everyone has a place near them. Always free,\nalways quick. If you want to know where to go, just go online, nyc.gov/covidtest for locations or call\n2-1-2-COVID19, and again, all tests is free.\nNow I mentioned the importance of testing at the schools. We've been doing the testing of staff and\neducators outside schools, and in schools. Starting later this week, we're going to be starting the\nsystematic medical monitoring of schools all over the city. We'll be doing that for every school once a\nmonth for the duration of this crisis and it's a way that we get more information, get to watch carefully\nwhat's happening. Keep everyone safe. This begins in some schools this Friday, we want to make\nsure that everyone is participating, that means educators, staff. It means students, everyone. Now,\nobviously educators and staff are overwhelmingly, ready, willing, and able to get tested, but we need\na sign off form. We need a consent form from parents to get a kid tested at their school. So families\ncan now complete the consent form online. You go to your NYC school account and you get that at\nmystudent.nyc. So just go to mystudent.nyc, your own account, enter in the information on the\nconsent form that automatically makes sure the school knows that your child can be tested.\nAnd look, to all the parents out there. I'm a parent. I want to say this to all of you. This is such a good\nand smart thing to do. The school community is working very closely with the Department of Health\nand the Test and Trace Team to make sure everyone is tested, tested quickly, safely, obviously for\nfree. It's a great way to know what is going on in the school and keep everyone safe. You will get the\nresults for your own child, this is a random sample in the sense of it's not every child every month,\ncertain children some month, other children another month. But whenever there is a test of your child,\nyou'll get those results quickly and that's important for your peace of mind. So, all families should\nparticipate and sign up on that consent form. The school will be reaching out to you about it as well. If\nyou have any questions or concerns, and obviously we'll talk to people in whatever language they\nspeak to help them understand how this works and to encourage them to sign that form.\nNow, families always have questions about testing, want to know more, want to know how it works. Is\nit fast? Yes. Is it safe? Yes. Is it quick and easy for your child? Not too cumbersome, not too difficult\nfor your child, yes, but we want to not just tell you that we want to show you that, so we've put\ntogether a video with one of our eight Health + Hospitals pediatrician and a young volunteer to give\nyou a sense of how things will work. Let's look at the video.\n[Video plays in background]\nAll right, well, thank you, first of all, to Dr. Katie and all our colleagues at Health + Hospitals and\neveryone who's going to be part of the school testing program. That video really says it all. And look,\nparents, I want to say to you, as you can see, are very energetic, young volunteer there, had a cool\nhairstyle too, that he did not have a problem with that test because it's not the long instrument they\nused to use. It is the much shorter, simpler, just a quick rub around the inside of the nostril and it\ncollects the sample really easily, really quickly. I've had this newer kind of test. It is much better, much\nsimpler. That's what we'll be providing the kids and its as quick and easy as you just saw there.\nNow let's talk since we're talking about kids, we're talking about schools, let's talk about what we\nneed to do to make sure that kids continue to be educated during this pandemic. Now that we have\nour whole school system open, our buildings open, we have kids in classrooms, we have kids\n3 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 133 of 153\nobviously in the blended approach where they're in class part of the week at home, wEorXkinHgI oBnIlTin e3 f-o6r\nthe rest of the week and other kids in all remote, but what does it require? It requires every child has\nthe technology they need. Now in the spring there was an absolutely astounding effort to get\ntechnology in the hands of kids who needed it, an emergency effort that was really admirable, and I\ncommend everyone at the DOE and all the partners in the private sector who helped make that\npossible, 350,000 iPads were distributed beginning of March, and it was one of the greatest efforts to\naddress the digital divide in this city's history. Overall, the Department of Education has 950,000\nremote learning devices available for students, some obviously are kept in schools, others are given\nto kids to take home. That supply has been extraordinary and has reached so much of our needs, but\nwe still have additional need for 100,000 more iPads according to the surveys we've taken from\nparents and families. So, the additional 100,000 iPads are being procured, now they will be provided\nto students starting next month. Again, any student who still needs an iPad will get one, or if their\niPad broke or there's any problem, we'll replace it. We need the remote learning, whether it's part of\nthe week or all week for a child to work, we need them to make sure they get the technology they\nneed, and we will.\nOkay, let's go to our indicators now for the whole city. Indicator number one, daily number of people\nadmitted to New York City hospitals for suspected COVID-19 threshold is 200 patients. Today's report\nis 70 with a confirmed positivity rate for COVID of 21.4 percent. Number two, new reported cases on\na seven-day average, threshold is 550 cases, today's report 501 cases. And number three,\npercentage of people testing positive citywide for COVID-19 threshold is five percent, today’s report\n1.90 percent, and the seven-day rolling average today is 1.65 percent. A few words in Spanish.\n[Mayor de Blasio speaks in Spanish]\nWith that we'll turn to our colleagues in the media. Please let me know the name and outlet of each\njournalist.\nModerator: Hi, all we'll now begin our Q-and-A. We're joined today by Health Commissioner, Dr.\nDave Chokshi, Health + Hospital CEO Dr. Mitchell Katz, Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza,\nSenior Advisor Dr. Jay Varma, and Jeff Thamkittikasem, Director of the Mayor's Office of Operations.\nWith that, we'll go to Gloria from NY1.\nMayor: Gloria?\nQuestion: Hey Mr. Mayor.\nMayor: Hey, how you doing?\nQuestion: Thank you. I wanted to ask you about something that the Governor said yesterday, and I\nwant to get your reaction because I believe there's a little bit of confusion going around, and I saw\nthat you mentioned the amount of testing that had been done at schools that are in the cluster ZIP\ncodes. Part of what the Governor said yesterday was that the virus transmits, and that's a direct\nquote from him, “in schools because different communities come together in schools and therefore it\nis a place of transmission.” I'm wondering if I could get you to weigh in on that as well as the medical\nexperts on the line about whether or not the city believes that schools are a problem as it pertains to\nthe spread of the virus.\nMayor: Let me start and I'll turn to Dr. Varma and Dr. Choskhi. Gloria, that is not what we're seeing.\nWe're going by the facts. We're going by the data. We've had the situation room up now for most of a\nmonth. Literally every single day reviewing data from every single school, 1,600 schools in the school\n4 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 134 of 153\nsystem, all reports of potential coronavirus being followed up on and on top of that tarEgeXteHd ItBesItTin g3-6\ninitiatives at the schools. What we're seeing in the school system in general is a very low level of\ncoronavirus activity. Now, I'm going to tell you that the facts that I know, but I want to start with the\nwhy, why would that be? Because the schools are now so concentrated in terms of the safety and\nhealth measures, what we're doing, we've talked about this gold standard we set, just think about\neverywhere in the city, everywhere in your life.\nHere, we have a place where everyone is wearing a mask scrupulously. I've seen this with my own\neyes, from the youngest child to the oldest educator, everyone's wearing a mask together. Everyone's\npracticing social distancing, nine, ten kids in a classroom. We've never seen anything like that in New\nYork City history. Cleaning constantly, ventilation, you name it, all of these approaches layered on top\nof each other. That makes it a particularly safe location. Clearly folks who are not feeling well, staying\nhome, been a lot of testing before school began, there’ll continue to be more testing. What we saw\nwith the tens of thousands of educators and staffs that we have tested so far, it was a positivity level\nbelow one half of one percent. So, the facts keep coming in, and I told you this recent batch of tests\nat schools in the nine ZIP codes, 1,351 tests of educators and staff came back with only two\npositives. So, I think the schools are proving to be very safe to the credit of everyone at DOE,\neveryone at Test and Trace and Department of Health. And this is what we want to continue, because\nthis is crucial to the future of the city is to keep our school systems safe. So, Dr. Varma, Dr. Chokshi,\nwould you offer your reflections?\nSenior Advisor Dr. Jay Varma: Sure, I can start. Yeah, I think the Mayor actually covered everything\nquite comprehensively. We need to remember that we have many lines of defense to keep our\nschools safe. We actually have lines of defense that are very similar to what you would have in a\nhealthcare facility, you know, we have people wearing masks. We have people maintaining physical\ndistance. We have extensive hand hygiene, we have environmental cleaning, and then of course we\nhave guidance that's being followed up and tested that people stay home, and avoid going to school if\nthey have any symptoms of illness. Those are critical lines of defense, and it's not just New York City.\nWe have seen evidence from everywhere around the world, and this is a disease that if people take\nthe appropriate precautions and the institution enforces compliance with those precautions, our kids\ncan get an education and our teachers and staff can remain safe. That is in controvertible. I know an\nissue that keeps coming up also is about testing. You know, I'm a real zealot when it comes to testing,\nbecause I think it's absolutely critical to controlling our epidemic around the city, and we have\nevidence from that from around the world. But testing again, isn't our first line of defense in the city.\nWhat we're instituting is a medical monitoring program, because it's going to help us understand how\nmuch undiagnosed infection is there and are our prevention measures working the way they should.\nSo I just wanted to make sure that we highlight and understand where testing falls in the hierarchy of\nthose lines of defense.\nMayor: Dr. Chokshi?\nCommissioner Dave Chokshi, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene: Nothing to add to\nwhat's already been said, sir.\nMayor: Thank you, doctor. Go ahead, Gloria.\nQuestion: Okay. Thank you, and if I could, Mr. Mayor, ask you about this back and forth regarding\nthe nonessential businesses. It seems like there was a disagreement about whether or not the city\nshould do this by ZIP code. The Governor seemed to suggest yesterday this was a flawed approach.\nYou know, the virus doesn't travel by ZIP code, it does not recognize ZIP code. So do you have an\nunderstanding of what the Governor's problem is with your plan and are you working on that, and do\n5 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 135 of 153\nyou think that maybe there is a way to do this, that isn't just ZIP code focused, since tEheXreH isI BaIT 3-6\nrecognition that yes, people do move around, that people are not confined to one specific area or ZIP\ncode, and that there – maybe there's a smarter way of doing this?\nMayor: I'll start and I'll turn to Dr. Chokshi. Look, we obviously, over the last few days, talked through\ndifferent models. The Governor had an impulse that I share to say, was there some way to, for\nexample, use census tracts – we found that to be not as helpful as I would have liked because we\nsaw again that we had not only within a ZIP code particular high levels, but we saw it starting to\nspread to the other areas of the ZIP code. So, the idea here is to of course, focus on the places that\nare having the toughest situation, but also surround them with activity to make sure that we do not\nallow spread. So, if you are restricting in the places that are really, really the toughest, you also want\nrestrictions in the immediate surrounding perimeter, and that's why the ZIP code model actually, the\nmore I looked at it, the more sense it made. It was a way to stop the spread from going into more and\nmore neighborhoods, and ZIP code has the advantage, Gloria, that it's not something like everyone\nknows what the ZIP code is of every building that they go to or every school or whatever, but it's easy\nto find out. People certainly know their own household ZIP code. It's easy to find out if your store, if\nyour school are in that ZIP code or not, and that was an advantage compared to other demographic\nor geographic measures we might use.\nAs to the Governor's team, they – again, good conversations yesterday. They'll continue today. We're\nlooking forward to a decision today. Best of my understanding they did not present a specific\nalternative. I said, look, here's what I propose. This would work. We all understand what the ZIP code\nis. This would work. Let's go. We have to act decisively. If they have a different model, it's their call\nand we'll work with whatever model they choose, but we have to move quickly. Dr. Chokshi.\nCommissioner Chokshi: Yes. Mr. Mayor. Just to add briefly to what you've said – what we have to\ndo is match up the epidemiology of the virus, you know, understanding how it is transmitted, the\nspeed with which that spread can happen, with the practical considerations around how to implement\nthese difficult local restrictions and you know, that's how our team has landed on the ZIP codes as the\nbest geographic way to set the boundaries for what we're moving forward with. I'll say two more\nthings. One is that we know that we have to move swiftly that you know, this, this virus has such a\nformidable foe and so the plans that we have proposed to the state are meant to be able to be\nbrought into action as quickly as possible, and the second point is just to emphasize one thing that\nthe Mayor said, which is that we have been in dialogue with our counterparts at the state, including\nhealth officials at the state level to explain our reasoning you know, to explain why it is that we\nselected the particular ZIP codes that are of greatest concern, and I think there is a lot of shared\nunderstanding about the urgency of the situation.\nModerator: We're also joined by Dr. Ted Long, Executive Director of the Test and Trace Corps. With\nthat, we'll move on next to Jen from the AP.\nQuestion: Good morning, Mr. Mayor, how are you?\nMayor: Good, Jen, how are you doing?\nQuestion: Fine, thanks. I guess my first question would be have the hospitals at all started to prepare\nfor a potential surge in patients? Are any of those plans being reactivated?\nMayor: Yeah, I'll start. I'll turn to Dr. Katz. Jen, what we're seeing so far, and, you know, we obviously\nare very careful and cautious in our assumptions. What we're seeing so far is actually the number of\nhospitalizations has not moved much. Although the positivity levels for coronavirus have increased,\n6 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 136 of 153\nbut still low compared to what they were in the past, so meaning within – among the fEolkXsH wIhBo IwTe r3e- i6n\nthe hospital – but we certainly have to be ready for a higher level of hospitalizations. I would say right\nnow, if this is our starting point, we're in a much better place than we were obviously in the spring,\nbecause whatever is happening now has not moved very quickly in terms of hospitalizations. But\nyeah, we have to be ready in case of any scenario. So go ahead, Dr. Katz.\nPresident and CEO Mitchell Katz, NYC Health + Hospitals: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The 11\nhospitals of Health + Hospitals have been a great barometer of the city activity for COVID. We saw\nmany of the trends ahead of anyone else in the last round. I'm very pleased that right at the moment,\nthere are only two patients in the 11 hospitals who currently are on a ventilator due to COVID. So, it is\nvery low, but we nonetheless course have plans for how we would deal with the surge if it were to\nhappen. Every single hospital based on its experience of what works, and frankly, what didn't work in\nMarch and April, has a new plan. We know the details, what wards we would open, who would get,\nwho would staff those wards, what the correct order of it, how we would transport patients. There was\na tremendous amount that was learned in dealing with the epidemic in March and April, and we'll be\nprepared if there is another search.\nMayor: Go ahead, Jen.\nQuestion: I also wondered whether – it's a bit of an offbeat question, I guess – but in trying to refine\nstrategies for containing this latest flare up, has any thought been given to tailoring restrictions by\nsome factor, other than geography, such as people's level of risk, like age group?\nMayor: Jen, I'll start and I'll turn to Dr. Varma and Dr. Chokshi. I think one of the things we learned\nlast time, obviously a really, really bad situation in March and April, but we learned a couple of things:\nmove as fast as you can, be decisive, it's much better to put too many restrictions in place and solve\nthe problem quickly then to delay putting restrictions in place. So I think when you parse too much,\njust as a common sense matter, when you parse too much, you run the risk of too many avenues\nbeing left open for the spread of the disease. I think if you say let's really buckle down for a\nconcentrated period of time again, weeks, if done, right, and make sure you're grabbing the whole\narea that needs to be addressed. You have a much better chance of stopping this problem in its\ntracks before it reaches the rest of the city. That that's my layman's interpretation, but Dr. Varma, Dr.\nChokshi, you want to speak to that?\nSenior Advisor Varma: Sure, thanks. I think, you know, the Mayor has summarized it quite well.\nThese restrictive social measures are a bit of a blunt instrument. We reserve them for only situations\nwhere our individual measures and our testing and tracing can't keep up with epidemic spread and\nthey have to be applied in an area broader that we might like just simply because of, of the complexity\nof how societies work and people interact. What you're asking specifically about is an approach that\nin public health terms, they use the term, the shielding or cocooning, which is it possible to have the\nmost vulnerable people kind of avoid high risk activities and in a way quarantine themselves so that\npeople who are at lower risk and continue their activity, you know, that, that has a lot of theoretical\nstrength to it. But the practical experience for many places in Europe that attempted this early on has\nreally not borne out, and that's because we are all connected to each other. If you're let's say elderly\nand have medical conditions you need people to help you, and those people are in connection to\nother people. So, you are really just one or two degrees of separation from other people, and it's\nreally not very effective to try to shield a very large population this way.\nMayor: Dr. Chokshi?\nCommissioner Chokshi: Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thanks for this very good question. I'll just add\n7 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 137 of 153\nbriefly to say number one, it's absolutely right that geography matters. We know this fEroXmH ouIBr IT 3-6\nexperience with the coronavirus globally. Geography does matter, and that's why the plan that we\nhave proposed focuses on geography in that way. But in addition to what Dr. Varma said there are\nother ways, you know, that are not mutually exclusive with thinking about geography as a way to\naddress risk. Particularly, you know, higher risk settings whether it's a healthcare setting, you know, a\nnursing home or other areas where we know, you know, there are higher risk activities, particularly\nthings that are indoors. Those are also places where we can bring to bear additional ways to protect\npeople in those higher risk settings. You know, ensuring that that the bread and butter of our\nprevention strategies, you know, the so-called “core four” are, are practiced and adhered to in\nparticular, in those settings.\nModerator: Next step is Henry from Bloomberg.\nQuestion: Mr. Mayor, how are you doing today?\nMayor: Good Henry, how are you?\nQuestion: I'm okay. I've got a couple of questions here. With students who are in these affected\nareas can still go to schools outside the affected areas, if I'm not mistaken, and if so, does that create\nan elevated risk?\nMayor: I'll tell you what I think, and Dr. Chokshi can jump in after me. I don't not believe, Henry, I do\nnot believe it creates an elevated risk for a couple of reasons. First is that we see the schools taking\nextraordinary measures to keep kids and staff safe and it's working. So if kids will be going into a very\nsafe environment and remember the second factor, the screening – we're telling every parent, it is\ntheir obligation to screen their child every day. If there’s symptoms, your child stays home. If there's a\ntemperature, your child's is home. If the kid gets to school and there's a temperature to child goes to\nisolation, is sent home. So there really are safeguards to ensure that if an individual child is even\nsymptomatic that, that is addressed right away. Dr. Chokshi?\nCommissioner Chokshi: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. No, I would just briefly emphasize, you know,\nparticularly today as Get Tested Tuesday, we do have a, a simple and clear message for anyone who\nlives in the affected areas in particular, which is to get tested immediately whether you're a student or\nsomeone else who is in that ZIP code, and we think that will also add the layer of protection as the\nMayor mentioned.\nMayor: Go ahead, Henry.\nQuestion: Okay. So, thank you for answering that. My other question has to do with, just bear with\nme here for the – I kind of lost it. Let me see if I can—\nMayor: We can bring you back if you want?\nQuestion: Bring me back in about a minute or two, thank you.\nMayor: You got it.\nModerator: Next up is Derick from WABC.\nQuestion: Hi, good morning. I had a question about this incident that happened last night in Borough\nPark, the warehouse where the FDNY was seen sawing their way inside, there were reports of 500\npeople inside, and that it's our understanding that despite some fire safety violations there were no\n8 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 138 of 153\nsummonses issued for violating any of the COVID-19 orders. Could you talk about thaEt?X SHhIoBulIdT t h3e-re6\nhave been summonses issued in that situation?\nMayor: Derick, I am waiting to get the full details. I've only gotten a basic report this morning. The\nmost important fact here is, first of all, there never should have been a gathering like that, and the\nfolks who organized it did something harmful and that has to be addressed and we'll address it,\ncertainly in terms of those individuals. Second, the important point, the FDNY got there to address the\nsituation and disperse people, but in terms of summonses and other consequences, I'll get you an\nupdate on that. Obviously, something like that cannot happen, particularly in the middle of a crisis\nwhere certain ZIP codes are showing of a particularly high level of this disease, and it's a danger to\neveryone. People have to be smart to not let something like that happen, and there will obviously be\nconsequences. Go ahead.\nQuestion: And then my second question is related to schools. You had mentioned a short time ago\nthat just a couple of coronavirus cases are linked to the schools. I think you said two out of 1,300\ntests were positive in those nine ZIP codes, and so based on that information, why go ahead and shut\ndown the schools if by your own admission, you know, people are following the rules, they're wearing\nmasks. If there's very few cases in the schools, then why close the schools?\nMayor: Yeah, Derick, it's a very fair question. This is an imperfect reality, obviously. The fact is across\nthe whole city, the schools are doing a tremendous job and the numbers bear it out, and it is striking\ntesting, you know, staff and educators in the nine ZIP codes at that level, 1,300 tests plus, and getting\nonly one positive back or two positives back. I mean, that's amazing. So in a perfect world, we'd say,\nhey, let's just keep things going. But I think the reality is if we're really trying to restrict movement and\nactivity within the ZIP code, if we say here are nine ZIP codes out of 146 in New York City that are\nparticularly problematic, we really want to bring the level of activity down. So, let's close the public\nand nonpublic schools. Let's close the non-essential businesses. Let's encourage people to stay\nhome. Don't go out unless you have to go out and go back to the reality. We had more in the spring,\nbut in a concentrated area, it just stands to reason that even though the schools were doing quite\nwell, we just want to reduce the amount of overall activity for a few weeks, hopefully only, and really\nstop this spread quickly.\nModerator: We're going to go back to Henry for his last question.\nQuestion: Thank you very much. Actually, that last question and the first question that I asked you\npretty much covers the subject of that question. But I have another question for you, which goes back\nto the continuing theme of the relationship between the City and the State, this governor and your\nadministration, and whether or not just latest split on how do geographically define the areas of risk is\nanother example of how not being on the same page might make just pandemic more problematic.\nMayor: Look, Henry, I think it's pretty straightforward. First of all, again, mayors and governors, not\njust in New York, but all over the country, will have differences. We have different jobs to do, different\ninterests to look out for. My job is to look out for the people in New York City, nothing else – my job is\nto look out for the people in New York City. So, right now, I see a problem in Brooklyn and Queens. I\nwant fast action. I want the State to take action because of the emergency status we're in. If we were\nnot in this emergency status, I'd be taking the action myself would be ready to do that right away. I\nalso want the State to look out for New York City, because there's a larger problem in other parts of\nthe state and the metropolitan area. We see other clusters, whether it's Nassau County, Orange\nCounty, Rockland County, I want them acted on for the good of the people in those communities, but\nalso to stop the interplay between different parts of the state that could be exacerbating this crisis.

But I think if you asked the question here, where have we ultimately\ngotten? I think the vast majority of times, the City and State have gotten to the right place together.\nSometimes we start with different perspectives, but we end up getting where we need to get in the\nvast majority of cases. So, look, my job here was to put out to the people of the city the reality, that it\nbecame clear that we had a bigger problem that required restrictions, no one likes restrictions, but it\nwas time to say it out loud. My job was to say that to propose action, because we need the State's\napproval. The State has every right to ask tough questions or look at the model and see if they want\nto alter the model. That is their right under the law. It's just important they do it quickly and decisively\nso we can all move forward. So, really, the proof's in the pudding, Henry, so long as we keep getting\nsomewhere, so long as we keep making the decisions together and getting to results, that's what\nultimately matters.\nModerator: Next step is Marcia from WCBS.\nQuestion: Good morning, Mr. Mayor. How are you doing good?\nMayor: Good, Marcia. How have you been?\nQuestion: My first question has to do with enforcement. And I know yesterday, the Governor made\nlight of the amount of enforcement that New York City has been doing. And today on NY1,\nCommissioner Shea was asked about whether he would give a stricter rules to the police officers in\nthe communities about being strict about giving more – more of fines and sentences – fines and\nthings like that. I wonder if you think that more fines for not mask wearing is something that you\nshould be doing, whether you should step up enforcement, and whether you're going to provide\nNYPD manpower to the Governor's task force?\nMayor: Yeah. No, I spoke to that already. You know, last week, Marcia, we had over 1,000 City\npersonnel out in the most affected communities, including NYPD, Sheriff's Office, Office of Special\nEnforcement, Health Department, Sanitation Department. They were all out doing enforcement, as\nwell as doing education and mask distribution. It was 400 officers each day last week. We're going to\nkeep increasing that. And as we have additional ZIP codes we need to deal with, we’ll literally keep\nincreasing as much as we have to. Absolutely, we've been doing enforcement for weeks and weeks.\nIn fact, we've closed down businesses, closed down yeshivas, issued summonses, you name it. But\nwhat I think is clear here is this is a problem beyond the normal enforcement approach. This is a\nproblem that requires larger restrictions for the community, because we tried in the past and had\nsuccess in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, in Soundview in the Bronx, in Southeast Queens. We tried an\napproach that was heavy on outreach, education, masks distribution, of concentrated testing, and\nenforcement wherever needed – and that worked. In this instance, we saw this problem grow, tried\nthe same strategies, tried more enforcement, it was not turning the tide the way it needed to, because\nyou can only enforce in so many places at so many times. We're now at the point where we need\nrestrictions, hopefully only for a few weeks to really turn the tide here. Go ahead, Marcia.\nQuestion: I also wonder, Mr. Mayor, whether there – because there's a lack of secular education in\nsome of these troubling communities that leads to a lack of compliance, because they don't have the\nsecular education, maybe they don't understand it. Do you think there's a correlation between the lack\nof secular education and the lack of compliance?\nMayor: I can't – I can't speculate on that, Marcia. I think what we have to do throughout all these ZIP\ncodes is work with everyone. I mean, we've seen tremendous support from community leaders and\ncommunity institutions. We've seen intensive efforts to educate people on the importance of mask\n10 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 140 of 153\nwearing, the importance of social distancing. We've seen masks distribution drives. I tEhiXnkH thIBerIeT's 3-6\nplenty of good messaging coming from community leaders and institutions telling people how\nimportant it is. I think there are some voices in many communities, not just here in New York City,\nwe're seeing it all around the country – there are some voices telling people not to wear masks, telling\nthem coronavirus is a hoax. You saw a very painful example of that when Dr. Katz and our other\nhealth care leadership gave a press conference a week or two ago, and it was interrupted by a\ncommunity resident, literally saying the coronavirus is a hoax. So, we have some of that out there.\nBut, overwhelmingly, the community leadership has sent a message that's very consistent with what\nour health leadership is saying, and everyone is working together to try and solve this problem.\nModerator: Next step is Juliet from 1010 WINS.\nQuestion: Oh, hi. Good morning, all. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. How are you?\nMayor: Good, Juliet. How are you?\nQuestion: I'm okay. Thank you, thank you. So, you just said a couple of minutes ago that schools\nand some of these non-essential businesses might be closed for a few weeks. What criteria will you\nuse to reopen and how – excuse me – how systematic would that criteria have to be maintained in\norder for everything to reopen?\nMayor: Yeah, it's a very important question, Juliet. I appreciate it. Look, what we tend to see with the\ncoronavirus – and I've been trained by our great health care leadership here to look for these patterns\n– there really are pretty clear patterns. When there's an upswing, it tends to go up over a period of\ndays and weeks. When starts to turn in the right direction, you also see that emerge over a period of\ndays and weeks. So, the two-week scenario is the ideal. And I'm not saying it's likely, but it's the ideal.\nIt's the one we want everyone to shoot for, where from the moment the restrictions go into place, two\nweeks later you can come out of the restrictions. If the full two weeks has passed and the last seven\nconsecutive days that ZIP code was under three percent positivity seven days in a row, that would\nindicate a trend, obviously. And that's what we be comfortable lifting the restrictions. Now, again, all\nthis is ultimately the decision of the State of New York, but I'm going to keep being very vocal about\nwhat we think will work and what we need. We want those restrictions to just be as long as they need\nto be, not a day more. So, that's the ideal scenario. The other scenario we put forward is a 28-day\nscenario, four weeks, where if you can't meet that first standard, second standard is go four weeks, if\nby the last day, the 28th day, you're down below three percent, again, that should show us that\nenough of the trouble has passed, that we can lift the restrictions. Now, Juliet, people have to take\nthis seriously. If they don't do the work, if the people in every community don't do the work, it could go\non longer, and no one wants that. So, ideally, with a lot of, you know, buckling down, a lot of real\nteamwork and effort by people in communities, you can get this done in just a few weeks, maybe\nmore like three, four weeks, but our goal is weeks and then get the restrictions off. Go ahead.\nQuestion: Okay. Thank you. Also, has anyone in these ZIP codes – in the nine ZIP codes, has\nanyone been given a summons for not wearing a mask?\nMayor: Yeah. We'll get you those numbers. As I said, there's been a whole range of summons activity\nand enforcement activity, whether it is yeshivas that were shut down, stores that were shut down,\npeople who were given summonses for not wearing a mask or anything else. But remember, this is an\narea where we've been adamant, because we know it works. The goal is to change behavior, never,\never wanted to penalize for the sake of penalizing. We've wanted to change behavior. We distribute\nthe masks. If people take the masks and wear the masks, that's what we care about. If someone\nrefuses, that's going to be a penalty right away.\n11 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 141 of 153\nModerator: We're on to our last two. First, we'll go to Narmeen from PIX 11. EXHIBIT 3-6\nQuestion: Hi. Good morning, Mayor.\nMayor: How are you doing?\nQuestion: Good, doing well? I want to also – on what Juliet had said – we'd also like to see the\nnumbers on the summons and fines in those nine ZIP codes. So, if your office could get that to us,\nwe'd really appreciate it. But I also think that there's maybe some confusion or maybe some\nclarification needed for City residents about what City inspectors for compliance of things, like mask\nwearing, should or does look like. And I want to give you an example – we were in Borough Park for\nsome time in the vicinity of 14th Avenue and 42nd street. And our observations showed minimal\nmasks wearing. We drove around about a 10-block radius and we only saw a handful of people\nmaybe wearing masks. When they saw our cameras come out, people would take it out of their\npockets and put it on. We did not see NYPD vehicles with those loudspeaker messages that we saw\nlast week. And we didn't see any obvious signs of City officials going around giving those summons. I\nmean, this seems to be an area that is in clear defiance of what the Governor and you are talking\nabout.\nMayor: Look, that's not the way I would define it, because we have been working with community\nleaders and community institutions, getting a lot of support. We've definitely seen an uptick in mask\nusage, but it's not where it needs to be. We have had loud speaker messages out now for the last\nweek or more. We're going to continue that, of course. There's a lot of ground to cover. So, I respect\nthat you were in a very good location, that's an area I used to represent the City Council, so you\nchose well. But, look, we're talking about nine ZIP codes. That's a lot of ground to cover. So, we have\nour folks out over a very broad area, getting this message out all the time, taking the enforcement\naction. But I want to be clear, again, I think there's a dissonance that has to be addressed very bluntly\nhere. We did all the same measures in a number of communities, and it worked, and things turned\naround quickly – again, Sunset Park, Soundview, Southeast Queens. We put out the free masks. We\ndid the education. We did the outreach. We did the intensive testing. We were able to turn the\nsituation quickly. We're not seeing that in these nine ZIP codes. It's past the point where enforcement\nsolves your problem. So, people can keep focusing on enforcement. If there's a role for enforcement,\nit's past that point. Now, the facts on the ground make clear we need restrictions. Enforcement would\nhave worked as it did in the other places. If it had worked that same way as it did in the other places,\nwe wouldn't be having this discussion. We need something stronger and we need it quickly. We need\nrestrictions to stop this problem. Go ahead.\nQuestion: Mayor, have you found it any of those nine ZIP codes to be any more challenging when it\ncomes to enforcement for any of your City inspectors, any ones that stand out that you believe the\nCity has to work, maybe, harder on?\nMayor: I have not heard that specifically. I think what we've seen is that the more education, the more\noutreach – yes, we've used those sound trucks, the more messages from community leaders, the\nmore impact it makes. But we are fighting against a situation – as I said, there are some parts of the\ncommunity where there are negative messages being put out, telling people not to wear masks and\nthat coronavirus is a hoax and all that. We are fighting that problem. We are fighting the problem of\npeople, of course, having had the fatigue of being through this crisis now for seven months. And\nthat's understandable. It's hard to keep your guard up for so long. But what we do know is more and\nmore, we're getting support and help from all facets of the community and that restrictions, unlike any\nof these other tools, restrictions are crystal clear. If non-essential businesses are closed, if public and\nnon-public schools are closed, it's really obvious if someone is violating and you can take instant\n12 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 142 of 153\naction on that. That's the kind of measure we need now. EXHIBIT 3-6\nModerator: For our last question, we'll go to Katie from the Wall Street Journal.\nQuestion: Hi, I wanted to ask, coming off the businesses question – I know yesterday, you said that\nyou would close down essential businesses. It's contrary to what the Governor and the State – what\nthe Governor said he wants to do. So, if the Governor does not approve the City's plan to close non-\nessential businesses and these nine ZIP codes, will the City still move forward and enforce the\nclosure of these businesses?\nMayor: So, Katie, I've been really clear, I'm going to be clear again. I don't know how many times I\nsaid on Sunday, pending the State's approval, and I say it again yesterday. I also said we would be\nready for Wednesday morning. We're not going to put out a plan, seek approval from the State and\nthen not be ready to implement it. We are ready to implement it, starting tomorrow morning. We are\nwaiting for an answer from the State. We cannot act until we get an answer from the State, it’s as\nclear as that. And I'm urging the State to move quickly and be decisive. We were at a moment where\nwe need action. We're not going to defy the State. I've never suggested that in the least. I said, I put a\nproposal on the table to the State. We will be ready to implement it, but we are waiting for sign off.\nQuestion: Oh, thank you. So, what kind of outreach is being done now? Because I know last night\nyou were asked that this is a pretty confusing situation. I think you said that it isn't, but I think for a lot\nof businesses in these areas, it is confusing. So, what kind of outreach is being done? Is SBS\ninvolved? Are people telling businesses? You know, people might now forget what's non-essential\nand they might forget if their businesses is essential or what can open. So, what kind of outreach is\nbeing done if that does happen?\nMayor: Yeah. No, I want to say, I really have empathy for business owners. They've been through so\nmuch, this is the last thing they need. It's the last thing they want to hear. I appreciate that. And I want\nto see these businesses survive, and the notion of even having to close them for a few weeks is\npainful for everyone. I have empathy for them and I agree, they don't have the clear information they\nneed. I want to get them the clear information they need, but we had to get this situation addressed.\nAnd so, I put the proposal out publicly to move the ball, to get things to happen, because my job is to\nprotect people in this city. And we're going to have a decision soon, I'm convinced of that. We will\neducate everyone in the communities immediately when we have that decision. Clearly, the word has\nspread. So, by putting the proposal out on Sunday, it gave people a chance to hear it and get ready\nfor it. We will – then, the second we have a final decision from the State, we'll start educating\ncommunities. We'll make clear to people what's expected of them. I want to be very, very clear, we do\nnot want to harm anybody. We want to help stop this disease from spreading to more and more of the\ncity. So, we'll get the word out and then we'll start enforcement. Once we've gotten the word out to\neveryone, we'll start enforcement right away. And at that point, it will be very, very aggressive,\nbecause when those restrictions are in place, it'll be crystal clear what's expected of everyone.\nEverybody, as we close down today, I just want to say this. Look, this city has come so far, and we\ncame so far by focusing on the data, by focusing on the science. This is what has differentiated New\nYork City from so much of the rest of the United States, and even from a lot of other countries around\nthe world – devotion to following what the actual facts tell us to do. We saw a problem in these last\ndays. It, unfortunately, consolidated. It was time to say we needed stronger restrictions. So, our\ndecisions are based on the data and the science, but in the end, what really changes things, what\nprotects everyone is when the people get involved. New Yorkers are the people who turned the tide\nlast time under the toughest circumstances. New Yorkers will do it again. So, it's the science and the\npeople. And I think this is what was never understood, unfortunately, in Washington D.C. and a lot of\n13 of 14 10/8/2020, 3:33 PM\n\nTranscript: Mayor de Blasio Holds Media Availability | City of New York https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/698-20/transcript-mayo...\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 57   Filed 10/09/20   Page 143 of 153\nplaces around the country – devotion to the science and then belief in the people.

(Tr. p. 13:2-5.) These \nselectively permitted mass gatherings have thus far included demonstrations against racism, Black \nLives  Matter  demonstrations,  Black  Trans  Lives  Matter  demonstrations,  and  Juneteenth \ncelebrations, marking the “23rd straight day of protests in New York City.”2 This admission \nconfirms the independent authority of defendant Mayor de Blasio to restrict Plaintiffs’ religious \nrights in New York City under Cuomo’s orders while freely allowing the mass gatherings he \nsupports and in which he has participated because he considers them more important than religious \nservices. See Verif. Comp. ¶ 70. It also reveals that in addition to the exemptions discussed in \nPlaintiffs’ earlier memos, the executive orders contain a mechanism of individualized exemptions \n \n1 As of today, June 22, 2020, Defendants have authorized non-essential outdoor gatherings up to \n25 people in Phase 3 regions, including the North Country where Plaintiffs Soos and Stamos reside. \nSee EO 202.42. As of the same date, New York City, where the three remaining plaintiffs reside, \nhas entered Phase 2 allowing houses of worship a mere 25% of building capacity—an arbitrary \nlimitation to which houses of worship alone are subject, while all other operating structures at \n100% or 50% of capacity. See EO 202.38. Worse, New York City otherwise remains subject to a \n10-person limit on outdoor “non-essential gatherings” while favored protesters march and party in \nthe thousands. See EO 202.33 and Declarations of Dr. Robert Onder and Prof. John Rao, Exhibits \nA and B, respectively. \n \n2 See https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/06/19/juneteenth-marches-rallies-and-\nevents-across-nyc: “Juneteenth to Be an Official Holiday as Protesters Remember the Past, Fight \nfor the Future,” June 19, 2020, Spectrum News, NY 1. \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 5 of 13\nbased on defendant de Blasio’s (or other local authority’s) view of community “best interests”—a \nsecular justification—without extending a similar individualized exemption for religious hardship. \nStrict scrutiny, which this scheme cannot survive, is thus unquestionably triggered. \n  Second, defendant de Blasio made a two-fold admission (consistent with its opposition \nmemo) that it has not enforced the gathering restrictions against “peaceful” protestors out of \nconcern for public safety, and that religious gatherings are not “comparable” because they do not \npose the same public safety threat. (Hearing Tr. p. 20:4-8, 21:18-22:12.) But this again reveals that \nthe de Blasio refrains from enforcing Cuomo’s gathering limits for a secular reason (public safety) \nbut not for less favored religious reasons, when religious gatherings do no more harm to the \ngovernment’s interest in “slowing the spread “of COVID 19—indeed, less harm. (Delgado Dec., \nECF No. 2, Ex. 1, ¶32; Onder Declaration, Exhibit A, ¶¶ 19-21).3 It also bizarrely indicates that if \nplaintiffs’ religious activities became sufficiently unruly and threatening, then they could be \npermitted. That is circular nonsense, as it declares that precisely an attack on “public safety” is \nneeded for an exemption to congregate for reasons of “public safety.” \n  Developments since the hearing further solidify Plaintiffs’ entitlement to relief. The first \nand only Court of Appeals judge to discuss gathering limits on worship versus exemptions for \nmass protests has stated the obvious: “If officials are now exempting protestors, how can they \njustify continuing to restrict worshippers? The answer is that they can’t. Government does not have \n \n3 It also betrays a misapprehension of relevant “comparability,” which is whether the exempted or \npermitted activity undermines the government’s interests justifying house-of-worship restrictions \n(i.e., stopping the spread of COVID-19) to the same or greater degree than socially distanced \nreligious gatherings—not whether religious services pose the same threat to public safety. See \nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 543 (1993) (holding that \ncity ordinance was non-generally applicable because it “fail[ed] to prohibit nonreligious conduct \nthat endangers” interests in protecting public health and preventing animal cruelty “in a similar or \ngreater degree than Santeria sacrifice does”).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 6 of 13\ncarte blanche, even in a pandemic, to pick and choose which First Amendment rights are ‘open’ \nand which remain ‘closed.’” Spell v. Edwards, -- F.3d. --, 2020 WL 3287239 at *4, 12 (5th Cir. \nJune  18,  2020)  (Ho,  J.,  concurring)  (appeal  mooted  because  gathering  limits  for  worship \nabandoned). \nMeanwhile, Governor Cuomo signed an executive order making “Juneteenth” (June 19th) \na state holiday celebrating the end of slavery, encouraging New Yorkers to “reflect on all the \nchanges we still need to make to create a more fair, just and equal society.”4 It was thus no surprise \nwhen “thousands of New Yorkers participated in protests, marches, and celebrations to mark \nJuneteenth on Friday,”5 while Plaintiffs’ religious gatherings remained tightly restricted. \nAs the pandemic wanes, defendants will raise the specter of rising COVID-19 “cases” in \nother states—meaning asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections with no corresponding rise \nin deaths or hospitalizations. See Dr. Onder Dec., Exhibit A at ¶¶ 9-12. They may also speculate \nabout a potential “spike” of infections (but not deaths or hospitalizations) in New York. But on the \nsame date he launched a wave of mass gatherings in the streets for Juneteenth, Cuomo himself \ndismissed these fears: “[B]y the time the protest happened, we were down at 1% infection rate. \n \n4 Danielle Garrand, “Cuomo declares Juneteenth a holiday for New York state employees,” CBS \nNews,  June  17,  2020,  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/juneteenth-new-york-cuomo-declares-\nholiday-for-state-employees/. Mayor de Blasio signed a similar executive order with an effective \ndate of June 19, 2021. See Michael Gartland, “NYC Mayor de Blasio declares Juneteenth city \nholiday  –  to  go  into  effect  next  year,”  New  York  Daily  News,  June  19,  2020, \nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-de-blasio-juneteenth-race-reconciliation-\ncommission-20200619-xudlmcnjfrajxni4udv4naxgpq-story.html.  \n \n5 Spectrum News Staff and Debora Fougere, “Juneteenth to Be an Official NYC Holiday as \nProtestors  Remember  the  Past,  Fight  for  the  Future,”  Spectrum  News,  June  19,  2020, \nhttps://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/06/19/juneteenth-marches-rallies-and-events-\nacross-nyc. See also Declaration of Professor John C. Rao (testifying that that on June 19, 2020, \nhe witnessed from his home in Greenwich Village a “Juneteenth” “march of thousands of people \nup Sixth Avenue, packed together without the least ‘social distancing.’ The vast crowd was \naccompanied—front, back and middle, by police escorts on motorcycles, bicycles and in cars.”) \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 7 of 13\nWe were so low by that point that I’m hoping we got lucky that yes, they came together, and they \nviolated social distancing, but they weren’t infected anymore.” (emphasis added).  See Exhibit D, \np. 2. If thousands of protesters are presumed to be non-infected at this point in the waning \npandemic, why not worshipers? \nDefendants’ exemptions (whether de facto or de jure) for mass gatherings—to protest \nracism, for Black Lives Matter, Black Trans Lives Matter, Juneteenth, or any other cause they \nfavor—remove their restrictions on religious gatherings from the putative umbrella of Chief \nJustice Roberts’ non-binding concurrence in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, \n140 S. Ct. 1613 (May 29, 2020). Whether called “exemptions,” “temporary relaxations” or some \nother euphemism, the exemptions allow precisely what Roberts described as “large groups of \npeople gather[ing] in close proximity for extended periods of time.” Id. at 1613.6   \nIn short, nothing stands in the way of the relief requested. \nDISCUSSION \n  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the arguments from their previous papers (ECF No. 2-4 \nand ECF No. 25) demonstrating the requisites for injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs now supplement \nthose arguments with the following three points: \nI.  Defendant de Blasio Has Independent Authority to Restrict Plaintiffs’ Religious \nActivities \n  In their opposition memo and during the Order to Show Cause hearing, defendant de Blasio \ndenied that he has independent authority to impose gathering limits and is thus not a proper party \n \n6 Not to the contrary is Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church v. Pritzker, -- F.3d --, 2020 WL \n3249062 (7th Cir. June 16, 2020). While the Court relied on Chief Justice Roberts’ non-binding \nconcurrence in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613 (May 29, 2020), \nit did not consider what was not before Justice Roberts: for mass protests that radically undermine \nthe entire “public health” rationale on which defendants rely. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 8 of 13\ndefendant. See City’s Opposition Memo, ECF No. 19-7 at p. 2; Hearing Tr. at 8:9-24. But that is \nmanifestly untrue. De Blasio must be enjoined in his official capacity for plaintiffs’ to obtain relief.  \n  First, de Blasio has declared his own state of emergency in New York City and has enacted \na series of COVID-19-related local orders pursuant to his authority under “the New York City \nCharter, the Administrative Code of the City of New York, and the common law authority to \nprotect the public in the event of an emergency.” See Exhibit C, EO 125. Thus, if defendants \nCuomo and James are enjoined, de Blasio would still be able to impose his own restrictions. \n  The City argues that Cuomo’s executive orders prohibit anything of the sort. But although \nan outdated order (202.3) prohibited local governments from enacting local orders “inconsistent \nwith, conflicting with or superseding” a state executive order, later executive orders (202.5 and \n202.19)7  merely  require  “approval  of  the  State  Department  of  Health”  (202.5)  or \n“consul[tation]with the state department of health” (202.19). See ECF No. 1-1 at p. 47. Nothing \nprecludes the City from enacting restrictions more severe than Cuomo’s. \n  In any case, at the hearing counsel for Cuomo and James represented multiple times that \nenforcement of Cuomo’s orders is up to local officials. See Hearing Tr. at 10:18-19; 12:2-3; 12:11-\n13; 13:2-5; 18:7-8. And the City’s own current emergency order incorporates Cuomo’s executive \norders, including the restrictions on non-essential gatherings, and directs New York City agencies \nto enforce them. See Exhibit C at §§2, 3. This easily suffices for purposes of Monell liability, see \nMonell v. Dep’t of Social Serv., 436 U.S. 658 (1978). It also requires, under Ex Parte Young, 209 \nU.S.  123  (1908),  that  Mayor  de  Blasio  remain  a  defendant  given  his  “proximity  to  and \nresponsibility for” the challenged state action. See Berean Baptist Church v. Cooper, 2020 WL \n \n7See, https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2025-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-\nmodification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency; and https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-\n20219-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 9 of 13\n2514313 at *11 n.3 (quoting S.C. Wildlife Fed’n v. Limehouse, 549 F.3d 324, 333 (4th Cir. 2008)). \nThus, Mayor de Blasio must also be enjoined.  \nII.  Defendants Have Exempted Mass Protests Against Racism \n  At the hearing, defendants insisted they have not actually exempted mass protests against \nracism from gathering restrictions. But the cases clearly establish that refusing to prohibit activity \nthat otherwise violates a facially neutral and generally applicable rule is a de facto exemption that \ncan undermine neutrality and general applicability. That is certainly the scenario here. What is \nmore, defendants have not only tolerated but positively approved and even (in de Blasio’s case) \nparticipated in what they have exempted from their regime of social control. \n  The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that a law’s implementation bears on its neutrality \nand general applicability for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause. In Church of the Lukumi Babalu \nAye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993), the Court pointed to Fowler v. Rhode Island, \n345 U.S. 67, 69 (1953), which invalidated a municipal ordinance that was “interpreted  to prohibit \npreaching in a public park by a Jehovah’s Witness but to permit preaching during the course of a \nCatholic mass or Protestant church service” based on an admission of the government attorney at \noral argument.  Accordingly, in Lukumi the Court held that a statute prohibiting “unnecessary” \nkilling of animals was not generally applicable because “[k]illings for religious reasons are deemed \nunnecessary,  whereas  most  other  killings  fall  outside  the  prohibition”  according  to  “the \ninterpretation given to the ordinance by [the city] and the Florida attorney general.” Id. at 537 \n(emphasis added). \n  Numerous courts have held that de facto exemptions can undermine a policy’s neutrality \nand general applicability. See, e.g., Bus. Leaders in Christ v. Univ. of Iowa, 360 F. Supp. 885, 899 \n(S.D. Iowa 2019) (nondiscrimination policy for student groups not generally applicable where \nUniversity allowed ad hoc exemptions for “educational and social” but not religious reasons); \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 10 of 13\nLitzman v. New York City Police Dep’t, 2013 WL 6049066, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2013) (one-\nmillimeter-beard  policy  rendered  non-neutral  and  not  generally  applicable  due  to  ad  hoc \nexceptions for religious holidays, weddings, funerals and “because the NYPD does not always \nenforce its personal appearance standards”); Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 736 (6th Cir. 2012) (de \nfacto exemptions from non-discrimination policy in counseling for non-religious reasons without \npermitting religious exemptions rendered policy non-neutral and not generally applicable).  \n  Here, each defendant has declared publicly that implementation of the gathering-size policy \ndoes not apply to the mass protests.  A compilation of their many public statements in support of \nthe protest exemption is Exhibit D to this Memorandum.  Not to the contrary is Governor Cuomo’s \nstatement on June 13 that “[y]ou don’t need to protest [anymore], you won,” because very next \nday, on June 14, he said “You can protest.” Id. Moreover, defendant de Blasio explicitly declared \nthat protest gatherings take precedence over religious ones because of “400 years of American \nracism, [which] I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably aggrieved … devout \nreligious person who wants to go back to services….”  Id. and Verif. Comp. ¶ 70.   And defendant \nAttorney General Letitia James said on June 12 with respect to the protests: “The right to \npeacefully protest is one of our most basic civil rights, and we are working without rest to ensure \nthat right is protected and guarded.” Id. (emphasis added). \n  All  of  these  statements  privilege  nonreligious  reasons  over  religious  reasons  for \nnoncompliance with the gathering limits.  Again, strict scrutiny is undeniably triggered. \nIII.  The Absurdities of Defendants’ Scheme Negate Neutrality and General Applicability \nThe result of defendants’ blatant double standard is nothing less than a constitutional \ntheater of the absurd. Their patchwork of ever-changing executive orders, guidelines, and de facto \nexemptions for mass protests—including an “Open Your Lobby” movement allowing protest-\n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 11 of 13\nrelated gatherings in concert halls and theaters that are supposed to be closed until the hazy future \nof “Phase Four”8—reveals bureaucracy gone wild.  \nStart in the North Country. In a region that has reached “Phase 3,” Plaintiffs Soos and \nCuomo are permitted to say indoor Mass for a congregation limited to 25% of building capacity. \nSee EO 202.38. This is a completely arbitrary limit on worship. See Dr. Onder Dec., Exhibit A at \n¶ 18. That means approximately 51 people in their Saint Therese Church in Nicholville. (V. \nCompl., ECF No. 1 at ¶ 84.) But in that same Phase 3 region, they are prohibited from saying Mass \nfor more than 25 people outdoors. See EO 202.42. Obviously, allowing Plaintiffs to say Mass for \ntwice as many people indoors as outdoors is simply irrational, especially as the rate of positive \ntests in plaintiffs’ St. Lawrence County has plummeted to a meager 0.28%. (Dr. Onder Dec., ¶16.)  \nAdditionally, in a Phase 3 region like the North Country, restaurants may open for indoor \ndining up to 50% of capacity with tables six feet apart, but with 10 people per table allowed, who \ncan dine without wearing masks while sitting closely together and even facing each other. See \nExhibit F.9 The notion that worshipers at a New York City synagogue or a North Country church \npose a greater risk of spreading COVID-19, even if they socially distance, than diners who are \npermitted to sit closely together at tables of ten, eating, talking and laughing in each other’s faces, \nis medical nonsense, not a rational public health policy. See Dr. Onder Declaration at ¶¶ 14-21. \nConsider these additional absurdities in the regime defendants insist they must continue to \nimpose on everyone whose gatherings they disfavor: \n•  As New York City enters “Phase 2” today—of no concern to thousands of marchers and \npartiers whose gatherings meet with official favor, see Rao Declaration, Exhibit B, ¶ 9—\n \n8 See Exhibit E, spreadsheet of lobbies made available according to this para-protest movement in \nviolation of the Executive Orders. \n \n9Reopening  New  York,  Food  Service  Guidelines  for  Employers  and  Employees, \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/Food_Services_Summary_\nGuidelines.pdf (last visited June 22, 2020). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 32   Filed 06/22/20   Page 12 of 13\nworkers whose “core function takes place within an office setting” must—laughably \nenough—quickly don an “acceptable face covering” whenever another worker happens to \npass within six feet, even if this happens “unexpectedly.”10 Yet the same workers can \nengage in a mass protest against racism or slavery, packed onto a bridge or in a plaza, \nwithout enforcement of any mask requirement.11  \n \n•  Defendant Cuomo has announced that starting on June 26, outdoor, socially distanced \ngatherings of up to 150 people will be allowed for graduations,12 without extending any \nsimilar permission to outdoor religious gatherings.  \n \n•  Cuomo’s EO 202.37 authorizes indoor special education services for the summer term in \nschool districts with no capacity limitation, without (of course) a similar allowance for \nindoor religious services, though both gatherings are comparable as courts recognize.13  \n \nEnough is enough. The ever-increasing absurdities of Defendants’ scheme show they can \nno longer justify imposing disparate treatment on religious gatherings while allowing so many \nother putatively similar activities for favored secular reasons. To quote Judge Ho once again: \nThe First Amendment does not allow our leaders to decide which rights to honor \nand which to ignore. In law, as in life, what’s good for the goose is good for the \ngander. In these troubled times, nothing should unify the American people more \nthan the principle that freedom for me, but not for thee, has no place under our \nConstitution.    \n \nSpell, 2020 WL 3287239 at *6 (Ho, J., concurring). \n \n \n10Reopening  New  York,  Office-Based  Work  Guidelines  for  Employers  and  Employees, \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/OfficesSummaryGuidelines\n.pdf (last visited June 22, 2020). \n \n11Spectrum News and Debora Fougere, supra n. 4 (see, e.g., post of Michael Herzenberg at 4:26 \nPM, June 19, 2020, showing a number of demonstrators not wearing masks) \n \n12“Governor Announces Outdoor Graduations of up to 150 People Will Be Allowed Beginning \nJune 26th,” New York State, June 7, 2020, https://on.ny.gov/311JGWN.  \n \n13 See, e.g., Cassell v. Snyders, 2020 WL 2112374 (N.D. Ill.

That is the mandate of the First \nAmendment of which this Court is first guardian. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary \nrestraining order/preliminary injunction providing the following relief:  \nA.

Sharpe Response to \nMotion due by 6/15/2020 Reply to Response to Motion due by 6/22/2020. \nfiled by Ken McGuire LAW OFFICES OF KENNETH MCGUIRE. \n(McGuire, Kenneth) (Entered: 06/30/2020) \n07/01/2020  38   TEXT ONLY ORDER - Pending is an \"Application for Preliminary \nInjunction\" filed by Kenneth McGuire, an attorney admitted to practice in \nthis court in 1994, who represents no parties to this action. (Dkt. No. 37.) \nIt is not at all clear who or what McGuire represents. He purports to seek \nrelief on behalf of \"Auto racing facilities located and operating in the \nState of New York... including, but not limited to, Lebanon Valley \nSpeedway, W. Lebanon, N.Y.\" (Id. at 1.) McGuire argues that the court's \nJune 26, 2020 Memorandum-Decision and Order applies to the interests \nthat he represents. (Id. at 2-4.) Among other things, the application is \nprocedurally improper. It was filed by an attorney who represents \nundisclosed entities that are not parties to this action. It is not compliant \nwith Rule 7.1 of the Local Rules of Practice either. Lastly, the motion is \nobviously without merit, and arguably frivolous. For all of these reasons, \nthe application for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 37) is DENIED. IT \nIS SO ORDERED. Issued by Senior Judge Gary L. Sharpe on 7/1/2020. \n(jel, ) (Entered: 07/01/2020) \n07/02/2020  39 Letter Motion from Adrienne J. Kerwin for Andrew M.

Stewart. \n(kmp) (Entered: 07/21/2020) \n07/21/2020  42   TEXT ONLY ORDER --- Pending is proposed intervenor Christopher \nEarl Strunk's motion to intervene. (Dkt. No. 41.) The motion fails to \nsatisfy the requirement that it \"must state the grounds for intervention and \nbe accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which \nintervention is sought.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c). And, in any event, it is not \napparent that Strunk \"has a claim or defense that shares with the main \naction a common question of law or fact\" such that permissive \nintervention, the only apparent basis for intervention here, would be \nwarranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B). For these reasons, the motion, \n(Dkt. No. 41), is DENIED. IT IS SO ORDERED. Issued by Senior Judge \nGary L. Sharpe on 7/21/2020.

No. 43), of the court's text only \norder, which denied his motion to intervene, (Dkt. No. 42). Motions for \nreconsideration proceed in the Northern District of New York under Local \nRule 7.1(g). \"In order to prevail on a motion for reconsideration, the \nmovant must satisfy stringent requirements.\" In re C-TC 9th Ave. P'ship, \n182 B.R. 1, 2 (N.D.N.Y. 1995). Such motions \"will generally be denied \nunless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the \ncourt overlookedmatters, in other words, that might reasonably be \nexpected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\" Shrader v. CSX \nTransp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995) (citation omitted). The \nprevailing rule \"recognizes only three possible grounds upon which \nmotions for reconsideration may be granted; they are (1) an intervening \nchange in controlling law, (2) the availability of new evidence not \npreviously available, or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or \nprevent manifest injustice.\" In re C-TC 9th Ave. P'ship, 182 B.R. at 3 \n(citation omitted). Strunk has completely failed to meet the stringent \nstandard for reconsideration and his motion, (Dkt. No. 43), is, therefore, \ndenied. IT IS SO ORDERED. Issued by Senior Judge Gary L. Sharpe on \n7/28/2020. (Copy served via regular mail to Christopher Earl \nStrunk)(jel, ) (Entered: 07/28/2020) \n07/28/2020  50   TEXT ONLY ORDER - Pending are two motions, which seek, among \nother things, permissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24(b)(1) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. Nos. 44, 47.) As that rule \nindicates, \"[o]n timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene \nwho:... has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common \nquestion of law or fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1). \"In exercising its \ndiscretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly \ndelay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 24(b)(3). Having carefully reviewed the submissions of both \ngroups of proposed intervenors, (Dkt. Nos. 44, 47), the court is \nunpersuaded that it should exercise its great discretion. In the broadest \nterms, there are common questions of law or fact and the motions are \nlikely timely, but the delay and prejudice to the parties in this matter, all \nof whom are represented by competent counsel capable of effectively \nadvancing the interests of the parties they represent, that would result \nfrom permitting intervention, even if not overwhelming, requires denial of \n\nthe motions. Accordingly, both motions to intervene, (Dkt. Nos. 44, 47), \nare DENIED; and the motions are denied in all other respects as moot. IT \nIS SO ORDERED. Issued by Senior Judge Gary L. Sharpe on 7/28/2020. \n(jel, ) (Entered: 07/28/2020) \n09/10/2020  51   Letter Motion for Bill De Blasio requesting Extension of Time to \nRespond to Complaint and Associated Dates submitted to Judge Stewart . \n(Parodi, Ellen) (Entered: 09/10/2020) \n09/14/2020  52   TEXT ORDER: On September 10, 2020, Defendants jointly filed a Letter \nRequest seeking an extension of time to file a response to the Complaint \nin this matter.

No. 58.) \nPlaintiffs also filed an amended complaint. (Dkt. No. 57.) A review of the \npapers seems to reflect that plaintiffs have added new defendants, which \nhave not been served, as well as new claims, which plaintiffs appear to \nargue are subject to the court's prior orders.

Most strikingly, Defendants Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James say \nnot a word about the recent exemption (whether de facto or de jure) from the challenged gathering-\nsize limits for mass protests against racism and the unjust death of George Floyd. (See State’s Br. \nat  pp.  1-26.)  This  despite  Plaintiffs’  reliance  on  the  exemption  as  a  primary  comparator \nundermining the constitutionality and even the rationality of Defendants’ gathering limits as \napplied to worship services. (Plaintiffs’ TRO/PI Br. at pp. 1-3, 10-21.)  \nApparently, Defendants concede that assembling of tens of thousands of people across the \nBrooklyn Bridge, for example (see V. Compl. ¶69, FN 8), poses no legally relevant public health \nrisk of spreading COVID-19, and neither, therefore, can much smaller and more-socially distanced \nreligious gatherings. See Hutton Decl., ECF No. 20 at  ¶¶11-13 E (citing the CDC for the principle \nthat social distancing is one of the best tools for reducing the spread of COVID-19, without \nmentioning gathering-size limits). Or it might be that the exemption for mass protests so obviously \nundermines the general applicability and content-neutrality of the gathering-size limits (including \nthe surprisingly ongoing ban on outdoor gatherings of 10 or more people) that it is simply futile to \nargue otherewise. Whatever the reason, the silence is deafening.  \n  Nor do the state Defendants or Defendant Mayor de Blasio dispute that the exemption for \nmass protests is a religion-preclusive individualized exemption subject to strict scrutiny under the \nFree Exercise Clause. (State’s Br. at pp. 10-14; City’s Br. at pp. 5-9; see also Pl.’s TRO/PI Br. at \npp. 9-12.). And neither the state nor the city Defendants contend that if the gathering-size limits \nare subject to strict scrutiny, they advance a compelling interest. (Id.) Indeed it would be nearly \nimpossible to do so after the exemption for the mass protests. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu \nAye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 547 (1993) (“It is established in [the Supreme Court’s] \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 5 of 20\nstrict scrutiny jurisprudence that a law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest \norder . . . when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.”). These \nomissions are staggering and ought to be viewed as dispositive in favor of the relief plaintiffs \nrequest—limited, if the Court deems it necessary, in the manner to which plaintiffs would agree, \nas they make clear below. See Point IV, Relief Requested. \n  Of course, what Defendants do say is equally troubling. Defendants state, in so many \nwords, that the Supreme Court’s 1905 decision in Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nis  a  blank  check  to  run  roughshod  over  Plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  while  generously \naccommodating the rights of tens of thousands of George Floyd protesters. (State’s Br. 15, n. 8, \n19-20; City’s Br. 3, 8.) They also view the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent “decision” in South Bay \nUnited Pentecostal v. Newsom as controlling despite (a) the Court’s refusal to address the \nunderlying merits questions now before this Court; (b) the absence in the facts presented of \nanything approaching an exemption for mass protests; and (c) the status of Chief Justice Roberts’ \nlone observations as conditionally phrased dicta, at a procedural phase in the case, and certainly \nnot a “decision of the Supreme Court” that in any way ties the judicial hands regarding the merits \nof this case. -- S. Ct. ---, 2020 WL 2813056 (May 29, 2020).  \nWorse, the state Defendants have the audacity to declare there is no irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs here because only “the manner in which they may exercise [their rights] has changed”—\na base euphemism that could justify untold amounts of constitutional violations if it were taken \nseriously and in essence a concession to plaintiffs’ position, see Point II, on the central issue. See, \ne.g., Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 914 n. 6 (1990) \n(Blackmun, J., dissenting) (observing that during the Prohibition era, the government’s general \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 6 of 20\ninterest “in prohibiting the use of alcohol . . . could not plausibly have asserted an interest \nsufficiently compelling to outweigh Catholics’ right to take communion.”) \n  All  told,  Defendants  have  said  nothing  to  undermine  Plaintiffs’  original  arguments. \nDefendants’ gathering-size limits clearly burden Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to engage in \ncorporate  worship  consistent  with  their  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs.  And  the  ongoing \nexemption for mass protests blows a gaping hole in any semblance of the policy’s general \napplicability and neutrality (including content neutrality), as do other key comparators like \ncrowded drop-in centers, homeless shelters, manufacturing businesses, and more (all similarly \nsituated activities not evaluated by Chief Justice Roberts in South Bay).  \nWhile  Plaintiffs  understand  the  ongoing  risks  of  COVID-19,  they  are  committed  to \nfollowing the “Temporary Recommendations” outlined in the declaration of their expert witness, \nDr. George Delgado. (Delgado Dec., ECF No. 2, Ex. 1, ¶53.)1 As the rate of infection drops well \nbelow 1.0 and Defendants exempt all manner of other (and more risky) gatherings that involve \nlarge crowds, with people in close proximity, for prolonged periods of time, the right to communal \nreligious worship is entitled to at least equal treatment. The First Amendment allows no less. A \nTemporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction (PI) should thus issue.  \n \n \n \n1 The city Defendants argue that the Jewish plaintiffs, as lay congregates, cannot guarantee their \nsynagogues will abide by Dr. Delgado’s social distancing and hygiene protocols. (City’s Br. at p. \n7, n.3.) But allowing Plaintiffs to participate only in socially-distanced religious services would \nstill allow the state to shut down any religious services that violate social distancing. It also gives \nsynagogues a high incentive to comply given that many other congregants likely share Plaintiffs’ \ndesire to return to congregate religious worship. Finally, this issue did not pose a problem for the \nSixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals when it granted an injunction pending appeal to individual \ncongregants to return to in-person church services so long as the individual plaintiffs “are willing \nto practice social distancing” and “are willing to follow any hygiene requirements.” Roberts v. \nNeace, 958 F.3d 409, 414 (6th Cir. 2020). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 7 of 20\nDISCUSSION \nI.  LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS \nA.  Jacobson’s Role \nDefendants argue Jacobson requires that this Court must defer to their judgment about the \nproper scope of gathering-size limits at this time. (State’s Br. 15, n. 8, 19-20; City’s Br. 3, 8.) But \nJacobson is hardly the absolute warrant for rights-suspension that defendants suggest. In South \nBay, for instance, Chief Justice Roberts, writing alone, merely noted in an isolated concurrence \nthat, under Jacobson, government officials have broad discretion to enact measures to protect \npublic health during a pandemic. Id., 2020 WL 2813056 at *1 (Roberts, C.J., concurring). But he \nsaid the judiciary should not second guess these judgments only “[w]here those broad limits are \nnot exceeded.” Id. Thus, it is clear that Jacobson does not grant government officials the absolute \nright to limit constitutional rights free from judicial review merely because they cry “Emergency!” \nRather, as is well known by now, Jacobson condemns invoking a pandemic to restrict liberties \nwhere the law “has no real or substantial relation to [protecting public health], or is, beyond all \nquestion, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.” Jacobson, 197 U.S. \nat 28(emphasis added). \nUnsurprisingly, numerous courts in recent months have recognized that Jacobson does not \nauthorize arbitrary, unreasonable restrictions on various constitutional rights, even in the name of \nprotecting the public health from COVID-19. See, e.g., Roberts v. Neace, 958 F.3d 409, 414 (6th \nCir. 2020) (granting injunction pending appeal against Kentucky’s temporary ban on in-person \nservices notwithstanding Jacobson); First Pentecostal Church of Holly Springs v. City of Holly \nSprings, Miss., 959 F.3d 669, 670 (5th Cir. 2020) (same re: Holly Springs, Mississippi’s similar \nrestriction); Yashica Robinson v. Atty Gen., State of Alabama., 947 F.3d 1171, 1179 (5th Cir. 2020) \n(upholding preliminary injunction against state orders restricting abortion for the purpose of \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 8 of 20\nslowing COVID-19, and stating Jacobson’s “ruling was not an absolute blank check for the \nexercise of governmental power”); Adams & Boyle P.C. et al. v. Slatery, 956 F.3d 913 (6th Cir. \n2020) (same, and holding that state restriction on abortion rights was an unquestionable “plain, \npalpable invasion of rights” under Jacobson). \nHere, it is still abundantly clear that Jacobson does not control the outcome of this case. \n(Pl.’s TRO/PI Br. at pp. 4-5.) But even taking Jacobson at face value, the underinclusivity of \nDefendants’ limits on gatherings (especially in light of the exemption for mass protests against \nracism) is an unquestionable plain, palpable invasion of Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights and is not \nsubstantially  related  to  the  goal  of  slowing  COVID-19,  especially  where  Defendants’  own \nexemptions for secular activity show that less restrictive means are readily available and effective \n(i.e., social distancing and hygiene and sanitization requirements). (Hutton Dec., ECF 20, ¶¶11-\n13.)  Defendants have thus exceeded their “broad limits,” as contemplated by Chief Justice \nRoberts, in slowing COVID-19, rendering their gathering-size limits subject to close judicial \nscrutiny.  \nB.  Free Exercise of Religion \n1. Burdens: The state Defendants argue their limitations on gatherings do not actually \nburden any Plaintiffs, noting that the two priest Plaintiffs in the North Country continue to say \nMasses, and that the three Jewish congregants in New York City “may” attend Jewish worship \nservices as part of the 10-person minyan . (State’s Br. pp. 13-14.) But Plaintiffs all have sincerely \nheld religious beliefs to engage in congregate religious services. As to the priest Plaintiffs (Soos \nand Stamos), this includes engaging in “religious ministry and priestly mission to their flock,” \nincluding by way of the in-person delivery of Sacraments to their entire congregations. (V. Compl. \n¶¶86-88.)  As  to  the  Jewish  congregants  (Schonbrun,  Perr,  and  Mayerfeld),  this  includes \nparticipating in Jewish worship services even after the 10-person minyan has already assembled, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 9 of 20\nas they have no way of guaranteeing before arriving whether 10 men have already assembled, and \nthus whether they can participate in the minyan. (V. Comp. ¶112.) \nAdditionally,  these  Plaintiffs  have  been  prevented  from  participating  in  worship  or \nreligious services with their family members, who, as women and children, generally are not \neligible for the minyan. (V. Compl. ¶¶129 (Schonbrun continually prevented from bringing son to \nsynagogue); 148 (Perr unable to have Bar Mitzvah for son and continually prevented from \nattending synagogue with his wife and four daughters);  and 162 (Mayerfeld continually prevented \nfrom bringing wife and daughter to synagogue services).) (See also Mayerfeld Dec. ¶¶6-9.) As a \nresult, these Plaintiffs are unable to fulfill their parental obligations to incorporate their children \ninto their religious traditions and to enjoy the companionship of worshiping with their spouses. \nWhile these burdens alone do not make Plaintiffs’ case, they are legally cognizable and trigger \nFirst Amendment scrutiny of Defendants’ gathering-size limitations.2 \n2. General Applicability: The state Defendants’ rely on an unduly narrow rule taken from \na district court case that was clarified on appeal in the controlling Second Circuit decision in \nCentral Rabbinical Congress of U.S. & Canada v. New York Dep’t of Health, 763 F.3d 183, 197 \n(2d Cir. 2014) on which plaintiffs relied in their opening brief. In Central Rabbinical Congress \nthe Court made it clear that general applicability and neutrality are two separate requirements of \nthe Free Exercise Clause. Id. \n \n2 The state Defendants argue the three Jewish Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims on behalf \ntheir wives and children. (State’s Br. p. 13, n. 7.) But Plaintiffs assert standing on their own behalf, \nnot on behalf of their wives and children. The burdens on their wives and children are relevant, \nhowever, to the extent their inability to attend worship services deprives Plaintiffs’ of their \nsincerely held religious beliefs to participate in and attend congregate worship or religious \nservices, including with their wives and children.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 10 of 20\nConcerning  the  separate  and  distinct  requirement  of  general  applicability,  the  state \nDefendants studiously avoid a single mention of their gigantic exemption (whether de facto or de \njure) for mass protests against racism. They merely announce the conclusion, in one cursory \nsentence, that the gathering limits are generally applicable because “on their face, and when \nconsidered in connection with the ongoing pandemic, [they] protect the entire public at large.” \n(State’s Br. at p. 11.) This ipse dixit is unsupported by legal or factual analysis—especially the fact \nof permitted and praised mass protests that undermine their entire “social distancing” regime, \nwhich they nonetheless continue to clamp down on religious gatherings a few people in a \nsynagogue or park. \nIt seems the state Defendant’s intended explanation is in an earlier section arguing that the \nSupreme Court’s “decision” in South Bay controls this case. (Id. at p. 8.) It’s true Chief Justice \nRoberts, not the Court, individually opined that houses of worship in California were similarly \nsituated to places like concert halls, theatrical performances, and movie showings, “where large \ngroups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time,” and not to places like \ngrocery stores. South Bay, 2020 WL 2813056 at *1 (Roberts, C.J., concurring). But the state \nDefendants argue that “[t]he same is true in New York”—while completely ignoring the exemption \nfor mass protests, which post-date the decision in South Bay and obviously involve “large groups \nof people” who “gather in close proximity for extended periods of time.” Id. The state Defendants \nalso overlook other key comparators like manufacturers, drop-in centers, and homeless shelters, \nwhich also often involve large groups of people in close proximity for extended periods of time, \nand which went undiscussed in the Supreme Court’s interlocutory decision in South Bay.  \nThe city Defendant, on the other hand, does acknowledge the issue of mass protests and \nargues, inexplicably, that they do not undermine restrictions on gatherings. (City’s Br. at pp.8-9.) \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 11 of 20\nIn particular, the city Defendant argues the mass protests are allowed only as a “temporary \nrelaxation in enforcement” as a result of “public safety considerations,” but that “the limitation \nremains in effect.” (Id. at p.  8.) But the notion that the limitation is still in effect as to mass protests \nis simply untrue. Just this past Saturday thousands of people gathered for a “Black trans lives” \nrally outside the Brooklyn Museum in New York City, with no evidence the rally was forbidden.3 \nA photo of the rally is below:  \n \nIndeed, the City’s own brief cites to a New York City public health document dated June \n8, 2020 titled “How to Protest Safely During the COVID-19 Pandemic” and gives all indications \nthat protests are allowed and not that they are prohibited under a “temporary relaxation.” (City’s \nBr. p. 8, n. 5.) What’s more, the city Defendant acknowledges its restrictions must be consistent \nwith state directives (City’s Br. at 2), and just this past Saturday Governor Cuomo stated at his \nregular press briefing that “You can protest” as long as you follow social distancing guidelines.4 \n \n3 Doha Madani, “Rally for Black trans lives draws enormous crowd in Brooklyn,” NBCNews.com, \nJune 14, 2020, https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/rally-black-trans-lives-draws-packed-\ncrowd-brooklyn-museum-plaza-n1231040.  \n4  New  York  Governor  Cuomo  Holds  Briefing,  NBC  News,  June  14,  2020  (14:08), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9bvSFzqfl0.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 12 of 20\n  That the general gathering-size limits are still in place does not mean an unwritten \nexemption for mass protests is irrelevant. Courts have recognized that de facto exemptions qualify \nas individualized exemptions and undermine a policy’s general applicability. See, e.g., Litzman v. \nNew York City Police Dep’t, 2013 WL 6049066, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2013) (holding that de \nfacto exemption to beard limitation policy undermined policy’s constitutionality); see also Ward \nv. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 739 (6th Cir. 2012) (“What poses a problem is not the adoption of an anti-\ndiscrimination policy; it is the implementation of the policy, permitting secular exemptions but not \nreligious ones and failing to apply the policy in an even-handed, much less a faith-neutral manner \nto [Plaintiff].”) \nAdditionally, it goes without saying that the city Defendant’s newly minted “public safety” \nrationale for allowing the protests is wholly inconsistent with Mayor de Blasio’s recent public \nstatements. In particular, Mayor de Blasio recently said that mass protests against racism are \nallowed,  while  religious  services  are  not,  because  the  former  involve  “an  entire  nation \nsimultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seeded in 400 years of American racism[,] . \n. . [and] it’s about a . . . deep American crisis[,] . . . [and] [t]his is a powerful, painful historical \nmoment.” (V. Comp. Ex. P.) That’s a gratuitous value judgment in favor of the protests, not an \nallowance out of concern for public safety, contrived after the fact with a litigation motive that is \nplainly apparent: to provide cover for both the Mayor and the Governor’s expedient exemptions \nfrom their obviously not generally applicable rule. \nBut even taking the public safety rationale at face value, exemptions for public safety,  good \nthough they may be, ultimately mean that the gathering limitations “regulate[] religious conduct \nwhile failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful to the legitimate government \ninterests purportedly justifying it,” thus rendering the policy “substantially underinclusive” and, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 13 of 20\ntherefore, non-generally applicable. Central Rabbinical Congress of U.S. & Canada, 763 F.3d at \n197. Indeed, as then-Judge Alito once opined for the Third Circuit, an internal police-department \npolicy forbidding police officers from wearing beards was non-generally applicable to the extent \nit exempted growing a beard for medical reasons. Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. \n12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359 (3rd Cir. 1999) Good though a medical exemption may be, it \nundermined the department’s interest in police uniformity and thus required that a limitation on \ngrowing religious beards must undergo strict scrutiny. Id. at 365-366 (stating also that “when the \ngovernment makes a value judgment in favor of secular motivations, but not religious motivations, \nthe government’s actions must survive heightened scrutiny”). The same is true here, where the \ngovernment has made a value judgment favoring mass protests (whether for historical, public \nsafety, or any other reasons) over religious gatherings and must therefore survive strict scrutiny.5  \n  The city Defendant further argues “one key difference” between religious services and \nprotests is that the latter occur outdoors. (City’s Br. at p. 7, n.4.) But this argument completely \noverlooks the “Open Your Lobby” campaign discussed in Plaintiff’s opening memo. (Pl.’s TRO/PI \nBr. at p. 12.) This movement involves theaters, concert halls, and other similar entities across the \nstate opening their lobbies to protestors to rest, charge phone batteries, snack, etc., without any \nlimitations on gathering sizes, and with express instructions to not let police in. (Pl.’s TRO/PI Br. \nat  12.)  The  city  Defendant  cites  no  evidence  that  these  activities  fall  outside  Defendants’ \n \n5 For this reason Plaintiffs disagree with last week’s decision in Calvary Chapel v. Sisolak \ndistinguishing outdoor protests from religious services on the rationale that the former are allowed \nonly because “enforcement could result in greater harm than that sought to be avoided by the \nDirective.” Calvary Chapel, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103234 at *12 (D. Nev. June 10, 2020). But \nin New York the allowance for mass protests is not simply a “choice between which regulations \nor laws shall be enforced,” id., but an affirmative exemption undermining the general applicability \nof the gathering-size policies. Thus, the argument collapses into the aforementioned argument that \nexemptions for even good secular reasons, but which nonetheless undermine the government’s \ninterest in slowing COVID-19, render the policy non-generally applicable.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 14 of 20\nexemptions for mass protests. Critically, no Defendant explains why outdoor religious services \nare not similarly situated to the protests and thus deserving of an exemption from the 10-person \nrule, which still applies outdoors even in Phase 3 regions like the North Country. Indeed, all \nPlaintiffs in this case are willing and able to have outdoor religious services and thus should be \nfree of the 10-person limit restricting their ability to do so.  But see, Mayerfeld Declaration at ¶¶ \n3-5 (respecting Sabbath services versus daily prayer services). \n  3. Neutrality: The state Defendants argue the gathering restrictions are neutral because in \nthe early stages of the spread of COVID-19 in New York, religious gatherings were allowed up to \n50 people for in-person gatherings while other businesses, entities, and schools were required to \nclose. (State’s Br. at pp. 20-21.) But, perhaps unsurprisingly, they do not mention Mayor de \nBlasio’s tweet and threats directed exclusively at the Jewish community. (V. Compl. ¶¶53-54.) \nThey  also  fail  to  acknowledge  the  Executive  Order  guidelines  (a)  specifically  singling  out \n“congregate services” for unique prohibitions and warnings, (V. Compl. ¶¶51-52), (b) imposing a \n25% of capacity limit on indoor services in the North Country that specifically singles out religious \nservices  for  disparate  treatment  relative  to  essential  businesses  and  activities  authorized  in \nDefendants’ original orders and subject to no limitations on percent of capacity (V. Comp. ¶36); \nand (c) a more favorable capacity limit of 50% for other favored businesses—double that permitted \nfor religion—in New York’s phased-in reopening plan. (Kerwin Dec., ECF No. 17, ¶¶25, 30.) \n  In addition, the blatantly arbitrary nature of the restrictions on religious gatherings reveals \na lack of neutrality. At his press briefing last weekend, for example, Governor Cuomo stated out \nof one side of his mouth that “[i]f you have large gatherings of people who are not socially \ndistanced, who are not wearing masks, you will have an increased spread of the virus,” (Cuomo \nPress Briefing Transcript, Ex. A at p. 26) (emphasis added), and out of the other side that as to the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 15 of 20\nwhether the virus has spread as a result of the mass protests, “[w]e don’t know what happened at \nthe protests and we’re still waiting to find out.” (Id. at p. 33.) Meanwhile, there is evidence that \nNew York City officials tasked with tracing those infected with COVID 19 have been ordered to \nrefrain from asking residents whether attended a Black Lives Matters rally, which could of course \nundermine the expedient exemption for these officially favored rallies.6 At the same time, New \nYork City officials are welding shut gates at a park in a Jewish neighborhood ostensibly to prevent \nchildren from playing outdoors and possibly spreading the virus.7  \nThis type of bald favoritism—bending over backwards to protect mass protests while \nobstinately maintaining that even socially-distant religious gatherings will certainly cause harm—\nlacks any basis in scientific evidence and betrays a lack of neutrality toward religion. Strict scrutiny \nshould apply for this reason, too.  \nC.  Free Speech, Freedom of Assembly, and Expressive Association.  \nPlaintiffs concede the state Defendants’ point that the right of expressive association is not \nnecessarily analyzed in unison with the rights of free speech and assembly. (State’s Br. at p. 2.) \nBut it remains true that the right of peaceable assembly is a “cognate” right with the freedom of \nspeech and can be analyzed together therewith. Johnson v. Perry, 859 F.3d 156, 165 (2d Cir. 2017). \nTo that end, the state Defendants’ one-paragraph free speech analysis completely omits any \nreference to the Supreme Court’s decision in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218 (2015), \nwhich made crystal clear that a regulation of speech based on its function or purpose is content \n \n6 Eric A. Blair, “COVID-19 Tracers in NYC Ordered Not Ask Those Who Test Positive If They \nAttend Protests,” Gateway Pundit, June 15, 2020, \nhttps://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/06/covid-19-tracers-nyc-will-not-ask-test-positive-\nattended-protests/.  \n \n7 Breitbart, “Watch: Orthodox Jews Cut Open Bill De Blasio’s Locked Parks,” June 15, 2020, \nhttps://www.breitbart.com/faith/2020/06/15/watch-orthodox-jews-cut-open-bill-de-blasios-\nlocked-parks/.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 16 of 20\nbased and subject to strict scrutiny. (State’s Br. at p. 14.) Nor does it mention McCullen v. Coakley, \n573 U.S. 464, 470 (2014), which clarified that if a regulation of speech requires “enforcement \nauthorities to examine the content of the message,” then it is content-based. As Plaintiffs explained \nin their opening memo, both of these principles apply here and render the gathering limits content-\nbased and subject to strict scrutiny. (Pl.’s TRO/PI Br. at pp. 19-20.)  \nThe city Defendant invokes two recent cases, Geller v. de Blasio, 2020 WL 2520711 (May \n18, 2020), and Butler v. City of New York, 20-cv-4067 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2020) rejecting free \nspeech challenges on behalf of non-Black-Lives-Matters protest activity. But only one of these \ncases was decided after the mass protests against racism began, and there is no indication in the \ncourt transcript the Defendant provides that the court closely evaluated the application of Reed and \nMcCullen. (Peroti Dec., ECF No. 19, Ex. 4.) The city Defendant also cites numerous other cases \nin other states rejecting free speech and assembly challenges during COVID-19 lockdowns. \n(State’s Br. at p. 4.) But the latest of these decisions was May 20, 2020, still five days before \nGeorge Floyd’s tragic deaths and the mass protests that New York and every major city in the \nUnited States allowed as a result. (Id.) But exempting the latter protest or a Black Trans Lives \nMatter protest at the Brooklyn Museum, but not other protests or religious mass gatherings, \nobviously involves a content-based exemption triggering strict scrutiny.  \nD.  State Law Claims \nNotably, the state Defendants make only an oblique reference to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity, (State’s Br. at p. 19) without acknowledging that “the Eleventh Amendment grants the \nState a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so,” and that \n“[t]he State can waive the defense.” Wisconsin Dep’t of Corr. v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381, 389 (1998). \nThe state Defendants have done just that here by including only an oblique reference to the rule \nand failing to develop any argument that Eleventh Amendment immunity applies. See Norton v. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 17 of 20\nSam’s Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998) (“Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are \nconsidered waived.”).  \nTellingly, the state Defendants never rebut Plaintiffs’ argument that New York Executive \nLaw § 29-a of Article 2-B of the Executive Law only authorizes the Governor to suspend law, not \nunilaterally create it. The state never once cites or wrestles with this statute despite it being the \nbasis of Plaintiffs’ claim. (State’s Br. at pp. 20-21.) The state effectively concedes Governor \nCuomo’s lack of authority to impose gathering restrictions on churches under Executive Law § \nArticle 29-a. The state Defendants then hinge their rebuttal to Plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers \nclaim on their belief that the Governor is authorized by state law (again without dealing with \nExecutive Law § 29-a).  Thus their arguments collapse in on one another and extinguish the \nGovernor’s longstanding position that Executive Law § 29-a authorizes him to unilaterally impose \nrestrictions on religious services.  \nII.  IRREPARABLE HARM \nThe  state  Defendants  argue  Plaintiffs  have  shown  no  irreparable  harm  because  the \ngathering limits merely require them to alter the “manner in which they may exercise” their rights, \nrather than outright prohibiting them from exercising their rights.  Here, first of all, the state \nDefendants virtually stipulate they are burdening plaintiffs’ religion by compelling them to change \nthe manner in which they worship.  They have thus conceded that strict scrutiny is required. \nAt best, Defendants are begging the question. Plaintiffs have sincerely held religious \nbeliefs counseling congregate worship with and for their flock, fellow congregants, and family. \nThe gathering limits outright prohibit them from doing so consistent with those beliefs, and the \nState has no place telling Plaintiffs what actually suffices for realizing them. The state Defendants \ncriticize Plaintiffs for not submitting any declarations demonstrating how they have been hindered. \n(State’s Br. at pp. 24-25.) But Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint, with each plaintiff swearing \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 18 of 20\nunder oath and penalty of perjury that the many particular facts stated therein are true, including, \nas discussed above, how the gathering limits prevent them from ministering to their flock, from \nattending synagogue when 10 men have already assembled, and from attending synagogue with \ntheir family in accord with their parental duty and desire for companionship. The gathering limits \nhave thus directly limited Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and clearly inflicted irreparable harm.  \nIII.  BALANCE OF EQUITIES AND PUBLIC INTEREST \nHere the balance tips decidedly in Plaintiffs’ favor, and a TRO and PI would serve the \npublic interest. Defendants acknowledge the virus’s rate of transmission is well below 1.0. (Hutton \nDec., ECF No. 20, ¶28.) And Governor Cuomo acknowledges there has been no known spike \nfrom allowing mass protests against racism. (Ex. A at 33.) (See also Delgado Dec., ECF No. 2, \nEx. 1 at ¶17 (noting it has been more than 10 days since the first public protest and by now a surge \nin cases would have triggered increased hospitalizations and an increase in percentage tests \npositive, which has not occurred thus far in New York City).) Thus, Defendants will suffer no real \nharm by granting temporary and preliminary relief to Plaintiffs. And such relief would secure \ncritical First Amendment rights, which is always in the public interest. (Pl. TRO/PI Br. at p. 24.) \nThus a TRO and PI should issue.  \nIV.  RELIEF SOUGHT \nThe state Defendants observe that Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief requests that Defendants be \nrestrained and enjoined from enforcing any limits at all on the size of Plaintiffs’ religious \ngatherings, or, in the alternative, from enforcing any gathering limits which are “greater than \nDefendants have imposed on essential retail businesses and the mass demonstrations.” (State’s Br. \np. 2) (V. Compl. at p. 47.) Plaintiffs clarify here that they also requested “[s]uch other and further \nrelief as this Court deems just and proper.” (V. Comp. at p. 48.) Plaintiffs do maintain that there \nshould be no gathering limits on their religious services whether indoors or outdoors, as long as \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 19 of 20\nthey  engage  in  proper  social  distancing  and  hygiene  practices  in  accordance  with  the \nrecommendations of Dr. Delgado. (Delgado Dec., ECF No. 2, Ex. 1 at ¶53.) Nor should they be \nrequired to wear masks as long as they maintain social distancing. Both of these are consistent \nwith exemptions for essential businesses and mass protests. (See V. Compl. ¶36; State’s Br. at p. \n3, n.2.)  \nHowever, if this Court does not view Plaintiffs’ indoor religious services as similarly \nsituated to essential businesses, Plaintiffs believe they are entitled to the same exemption as non-\nessential businesses allowing up to 50% of building capacity for indoor services. (See, e.g., Hutton \nDec., ECF No. 20, ¶¶46, 47.) This would materially reduce the burden on Plaintiffs Soos and \nStamos in the North Country, allowing them to realistically minister to their entire flock, and it \nwould effectively allow Plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr, and Mayerfeld to attend synagogue when not \npart of the minyan and with their families.  \nPut simply, Plaintiffs seek no gathering-size limits on outdoor religious services8 and no \ngathering-size limits on indoor religious services. But if they must accept limits on indoor services, \n50% of building capacity would be acceptable and accomplish satisfactory relief.  And, as noted, \nthey would follow all of the social distancing recommendations set forth in Dr. Delgado’s \ndeclaration.  (Delgado Dec., ECF No. 2, Ex. 1 at ¶53.) \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary \nrestraining order and preliminary injunction.  \n           \n \n8 This would be consistent with New Jersey’s new exemption eliminating all gathering size \nrestrictions on outdoor religious services, as enshrined in New Jersey Executive Order 152(2)(f). \n(Ex. B at pp. 8-9.). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 25   Filed 06/16/20   Page 20 of 20\nRespectfully submitted, \n    s//Christopher A.

R. Civ. P. 65 against Defendants Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, Attorney General \nLetitia James, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, preventing them from enforcing \nexecutive orders and plans that bar Plaintiffs from holding or attending indoor and outdoor \nreligious services in a manner consistent with their sincerely held religious beliefs.  The grounds \nfor the emergente relief sought are summarized as follows: \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 2   Filed 06/10/20   Page 2 of 5\n1. Plaintiffs Rev. Steven Soos and Rev. Nicholas Stamos are Catholic priests in the\nNorth Country, New York. These plaintiffs have been consistently forbidden from holding or \nattending “congregate” worship services beyond an ever-changing maximum number of people, \nbeginning with zero. Governor Cuomo’s latest relevant Executive Order, 202.38 issued on June 6, \n2020, prevents Plaintiffs Soos and Stamos in the North Country from having Masses beyond 25% \npercent of their churches’ occupancy capacity, or with more than 10 people at any outdoor Mass.  \n2. Plaintiffs Daniel Schonbrun, Elchanan Perr, and Mayer Mayerfield are Orthodox\nJewish congregants who reside in Brooklyn, New York. These plaintiffs remain subject to a 10-\nperson limit applicable to Jewish worship services indoors or outdoors in New York City. This \nlimit effectively criminalizes any Jewish congregation beyond the ten-person quorum of adult \nmales (minyan) required for the conduct of Orthodox Jewish prayer services and also prevents \ntheir female and non-adult male family members from attending synagogue services. \n3. All of the Plaintiffs have endured restrictions on in their in-person worship services\nfor more than 90 days under the notion that religious gatherings are “non-essential” in the state’s \neffort to slow the spread of COVID-19.  But, as shown in the accompanying memorandum of law, \nthe infection rate of COVID-19 in New York has dramatically slowed since March.  \n4. And,  in  the  past  two  weeks,  Defendants  have  approved  and  exempted  mass\ngatherings across New York demonstrating against the tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota. \nThese protests began more than 10 days ago and have involved thousands of people with little or \nno “social distancing” between protestors, and yet there is no evidence of any resulting outbreak \nof COVID-19. Plaintiffs, however, are willing to maintain social distancing and hygiene practices \nin their indoor and outdoor worship services, and their religious gatherings are far less crowded.  \n5. After months of silent obedience, and in view of defendants’ selectively granted\n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 2   Filed 06/10/20   Page 3 of 5\npermission, days ago, for mass demonstrations that violate the rules to which Plaintiffs have been \nsubjected, there is no longer any reason based on “public health” to delay seeking to attend \nreligious gatherings on at least equal terms with other “essential” gatherings like mass protests, \nespecially as the next Sabbath and Sunday holy day rapidly approach this weekend.  \n6.  Otherwise, the unconstitutional restrictions on Plaintiffs’ religious services will be \nindefinite. The Governor’s current reopening plan does not authorize full house-of-worship \nreopenings until “Phase Four,” which has no definite beginning date and is far beyond Phases One \nand Two presently applicable to Plaintiffs.  \n7.  But Defendants’ recent exemption for mass protests exposes the ongoing house-of-\nworship restrictions as arbitrary, irrational, and unjustifiably unequal. Defendants have made a \nvalue judgment favoring mass protests against racism without granting equal recognition to \nreligious gatherings. This glaring hypocrisy—so contrary to our fundamental law—simply cannot \nstand. \n8.  As shown in the Verified Complaint, Exhibits and Memorandum of Law, the \nDefendants’ Orders interfere with Plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, right of \nassembly, right of expressive association, and equal protection of the law.   \n9.  The Orders are also ultra vires defendant Cuomo’s limited authority under N.Y. \nExecutive Law 29-a to declare a state of emergency and suspend the operation of laws, rules and \nregulations temporarily, but only, as that statute provides, “Subject to the state constitution, the \nfederal constitution and federal statutes and regulations…” New York State Executive Law § 29-\na,  sec. 1.  Cuomo had no authority to promulgate the subject detailed regulations of every aspect \nof the lives of more than 8 million New Yorkers, which constitute legislation by one man rather \nthan the State Legislature. \n 3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 2   Filed 06/10/20   Page 4 of 5\n10.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction, the balance of hardships tips strongly in their favor, and \nprotecting their constitutional rights is in the public interest. An injunction would also preserve \nthe status quo ante.  \n11.  In support of this motion, Plaintiffs rely on the accompanying Memorandum of \nLaw, the Verified Complaint, Exhibits to the Verified Complaint, and declaration of Plaintiffs’ \nmedical expert, Dr. George Delgado, and counsel’s declaration concerning notice given.  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request: \n(a) that a temporary restraining order (with notice) be issued by this Court in time for Sabbath \nservices on Friday, June 12 (at sundown) and Sunday Masses on June 14, temporarily \nrestraining Defendants, their agents, employees, and those acting in concert with them from \nenforcing the Governor’s Orders in a manner infringing on Plaintiffs’ religious services; \n \n(b) in the alternative, a preliminary injunction hearing on an expedited basis; \n \n(c) such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \nPlaintiffs request that a bond be waived or that only a nominal bond be required.  \n \nPlaintiffs request oral argument to the extent the Court deems it useful and, under the \ncircumstances, feasible. \n \nDated: June 10, 2020        Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n                                                           \n            ________________________________ \nCHRISTOPHER A.

Due to \nCOVID- 19, New York has been in a state of emergency since March 7, 2020. The limitations \nand precautions implemented by New York are aimed solely at responding to the COVID-19 \npandemic and dramatically slowed the spread of the virus.  To continue to protect public health \nand avoid a resurgence of COVID-19 in New York, Governor Cuomo, with the guidance and \nassistance of health experts, designed and adopted a four-phase re-opening plan that slowly and \nmethodically modifies gathering limitations, and responds to the continuous evaluation of real-\ntime evolving medical data and the evolving understanding of the transmission of the disease. As \nregions of the State progress through the phases, more businesses have been permitted to open, \npeople have been permitted to engage in more activities and gathering limitations have relaxed.   \nThe restrictions, and the four-phase re-opening plan, target COVID-19, not religion or any \nviewpoint.  Both on their face, and as applied, the Executive Orders, and associated guidance and \nphysical distancing protocols (“protocols”) challenged by plaintiffs are content neutral and \ngenerally applicable, and exist solely to protect public health. \nFor the reasons discussed below, plaintiffs’ application for temporary preliminary \ninjunctive relief should be denied.  First, plaintiffs fail to satisfy their heavy burden to establish \nentitlement to such relief.  Second, consistent with well establish legal principles, the State is \naccorded great deference in responding to a public health emergency and cannot be hamstrung in \nits ability and efforts to continue to evaluate and address the continued dangers of COVID-19 to \nprotect the lives of New Yorkers. Third, the equities balance in favor of protecting public health \nand continuing New York’s efforts to save lives in the wake of the ongoing pandemic. The risk \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 10 of 34\n \nto do otherwise cannot be overstated.  Finally, issuance of a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) \nrelaxing limitations on mass gatherings contrary to current medical knowledge would not be in \nthe public interest. That New York appears to be responding well to the extreme measures \nundertaken to combat the pandemic does not mean the danger has abated.  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn June 10, 2020, plaintiffs commenced this action by filing a complaint against \ndefendants Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, Attorney General Letitia James (collectively the “State \ndefendants”) and New York City Mayor Bill deBlasio alleging that various Executive Orders and \nphysical distancing protocols relating to congregate religious services and gatherings violate \nplaintiffs’ First Amendment rights to freedom of exercise, speech, assembly, and expressive \nassociation, and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, and constitute ultra vires \nstate action in violation of federal rights. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief. \nOn June 11, 2020, plaintiffs filed an application seeking an order: \n  [r]estraining Defendants from enforcing any gathering limits on Plaintiffs’ \nreligious gatherings, or, in the alternative, from enforcing any gathering limits on \nPlaintiffs’ religious gatherings greater than Defendants have imposed on essential \nretail businesses and the mass demonstrations approved by Defendants Cuomo \nand de Blasio. \n \nDkt. No. 7.  The court thereafter issued a text order denying plaintiffs’ TRO motion to the extent \nthat it applied to religious services on June 12 and 14, and directed defendants to file a response \nto plaintiffs' application by 12 p.m., on June 15, 2020, and scheduled a hearing on June 17, 2020.  \nDkt. at 6/11/2020, 3:41pm.   \nEXECUTIVE ORDERS LIMITING GATHERINGS AND REQUIRING PHYSICAL \nDISTANCING \n \nOn March 7, 2020, in order to combat the burgeoning COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 11 of 34\n \nNew York State Executive Law § 29, Governor Cuomo issued Executive Order (“EO”) 202, \nimplementing the State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan and declaring a statewide \ndisaster emergency until September 7, 2020.  Kerwin Decl., Exh. 0.  By Executive Order No. 202, \nthe Governor suspended all state and local laws, rules, and regulations to the extent necessary to \ncope with the COVID-19 disaster emergency.  Id.  Following the issuance of EO 202, Governor \nCuomo issued several supplemental EOs, continuing the temporary suspension and modification \nof certain laws relating to the state of emergency.  To date, the Governor has issued over thirty \nadditional EOs (Nos. 202.1 through 202.40) related to the COVID-19 disaster emergency, each of \nwhich suspends or modifies specified legal provisions and makes declarations related to the \ndisaster emergency.  Kerwin Decl., Exhs. 0-40.  For purposes of the instant motion, only the current \nstatus of gathering limitations and physical distancing protocols are specifically discussed below.  \nPhase 11 \nPursuant to Executive Orders 202.32 and 202.33, in regions eligible for Phase 1 \nreopening, gatherings of ten or fewer individuals are permitted, provided that individuals adhere \nto physical distancing2 and cleaning and disinfection protocols required by the New York \nDepartment of Health.  Kerwin Decl., Exhs. 32, 33.  Additionally, any drive-in or remote \nreligious service may continue in excess of the 10-person limit so long as there is no in-person \ncontact between participants. Outdoor congregations of groups for any purpose, including \nreligious service or ceremony, in excess of ten in-person participants remain prohibited under \n                                                 \n1 New York City, where plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld attend synagogue, is in Phase \n1. \n \n2 Effective April 17, 2020, the Governor issued EO 202.17, which requires any individual who is \nover age two and able to medically tolerate a face-covering to cover his or her nose and mouth \nwith a mask or cloth face-covering when in a public place and unable to maintain, or when not \nmaintaining, social distance. Kerwin Decl, Exh. 17.  This EO remains in effect. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 12 of 34\n \nPhase 1 protocols. Businesses permitted to open in Phase 13 must comply with physical \ndistancing protocols.4  \nPhase 2 \n  In regions that have reached Phase 2, pursuant to Executive Order 202.38, religious \ngatherings of 25 percent of a house of worship’s maximum indoor capacity are permitted, provided \nthat social distancing and cleaning and disinfection protocols required by the Department of Health \nare followed.  Kerwin Decl., Exh. 38.  \nUnder the EO, the following must remain closed during Phase 2:  (1) any indoor common \nportions of retail shopping malls with 100,000 or more square feet of retail space available for \nlease; (2) indoor on-premise restaurant and bar service; (3) large gathering/event venues, \nincluding but not limited to, establishments that host concerts, conferences, or other in-person \nperformances or presentations in front of an in-person audience; (4) gyms, fitness centers, and \nexercise classes, except for remote or streaming services; (5) video lottery and casino gaming \nfacilities; (6) indoor movie theaters; and (7) places of public amusement, whether indoors or \noutdoors, including, but not limited to, locations with amusement rides, carnivals, amusement \nparks, water parks, aquariums, zoos, arcades, fairs, children’s play centers, funplexes, theme \nparks, bowling alleys, family and children’s attractions. Hutton Decl. at ¶53.  Retail businesses \n                                                 \n3 Businesses in the following industries are permitted to re-open in Phase 1: (1) construction; (2) \nagriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; (3) retail limited to curbside or in-store pickup/drop \noff; (4) manufacturing; and (5) wholesale trade.  Hutton Decl. at ¶46. \n \n4 These protocols include, but are not limited to, (1) 6-foot distance between personnel; (2) \nlimiting indoor workforce presence to no more than 50% of the maximum occupancy for a \nparticular area set by the certificate of occupancy, inclusive of customers picking up an order \nwho must maintain 6 feet of space from others or wear an acceptable face covering; and (3) \nwearing of acceptable face covering when personnel are less than 6 feet apart from one another \nor a customer and without a physical barrier (e.g., plexiglass).  Hutton Decl. at ¶48.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 13 of 34\n \nopening in Phase 2 must comply with physical distancing requirements similar to those required \nin Phase 1.  Id. at ¶55. \nPhase 35 \nIn Phase 3, restaurants and personal care service businesses are added to the non-essential \nbusinesses permitted to resume operation.  Food service businesses must limit indoor capacity to \nno more than 50 percent of maximum occupancy, exclusive of employees, and limit outdoor \ncapacity to the number of tables that can be safely and appropriately arranged, such that each \ntable is a minimum of 6 feet away from another.  Hutton Decl. at ¶57.  Additionally, all indoor \nand outdoor tables with seating for customers must be separated by a minimum of 6 feet  in all \ndirections. Wherever distancing is not feasible between tables, physical barriers must be erected \nbetween such tables.  Id.    \nRegardless of physical distance, employees must wear an acceptable face covering at all \ntimes, and patrons must wear face coverings at all times, except while seated.  Individuals seated \nat the same table must be members of the same party, with a maximum of 10 people per table. \nSeating in bar areas and communal tables is only permitted if at least 6 feet can be maintained \nbetween parties.  Id. \nPersonal care businesses must also limit workforce and customer presence to no more \nthan 50 percent of the maximum occupancy, inclusive of customers, who must maintain 6 feet of \nseparation from others, except during the service.  Id. at ¶58.  Customers may only be permitted \nentry if wearing an acceptable face covering.  Id.  Six feet of distance must be maintained \nbetween individuals at all times, unless safety or the core activity requires a shorter distance (e.g. \n                                                 \n5 As of June 12, 2020, the North Country, where plaintiffs Soos and Stamos perform religious \nservices, is in Phase 3.  Hutton Decl. at ¶46. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 14 of 34\n \nperforming a piercing/tattoo, providing a massage, performing a manicure/pedicure). Id.  \nEmployees must wear face coverings any time they interact with customers, and any time they \ncome within 6 feet of another person.  Id.  Customer seating must allow customers to maintain 6 \nfeet of distance from all others except for the employee providing service, unless a physical \nbarrier is in place in accordance with OSHA guidelines.  Id. \nAdditionally, employees at appointment desks or cash registers must maintain 6 feet of \ndistance from others, unless there is a physical barrier between them, or the employee is wearing \na face covering.  Id.  However, even with a barrier, employees must wear a face covering any \ntime they interact with a customer.  Id.  All waiting rooms must remain closed. Id.  \nFACTS AS ALLEGED BY THE PLAINTIFFS \n  Plaintiffs allege that New York’s 10-person outdoor gathering limit and the Phase 2 \nlimitation on indoor religious services at 25 percent capacity violate their constitutional rights to \nparticipate in congregate religious activities.   \nPlaintiffs Soos and Stamos are Catholic priests who perform religious services and \nceremonies to congregations in Glens Falls, Massena and Nicholville, all located in New York’s \nNorth Country Region.  Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶77-81.  These plaintiffs allege that the 25 percent \ncapacity limitation of EO 202.38 required them, on June 7, to offer five masses at one of their \nchurches, instead of the “normal” two. Id. at ¶93. Also on June 7, plaintiff Stamos had to offer \nthree drive-in Masses for another congregation, rather than the four in-person Masses that would \nhave otherwise been held.  Id. at ¶94.   \n   Plaintiffs Soos and Stamos also allege that the “drive-in masses” permitted by EO \n202.32 “involve major and unjustified burdens” on plaintiffs Soos and Stamos and their \ncongregations., id. at ¶97, because, inter alia, the drive-in services (1) prevent worshippers from \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 15 of 34\n \nkneeling; (2) require people to be uncomfortable in vehicles; (3) require the administration of \nHoly Communion two worshippers at a time instead of in a kneeling row; and (4) expose priests \nand altar servers to bad weather.  Id. at ¶97. \n  Plaintiffs Sconburn, Perr and Mayerfeld are practitioners of the Orthodox Jewish faith \nwho attend synagogues in Brooklyn.  Dkt. No. 1 at ¶103.   The complaint alleges that the \nOrthodox Jewish faith requires that synagogue prayers take place by a “minimum quorum of ten \nadult males (thirteen or older), called the “minyan,” and several congregants, a few times a \nweek.”  These prayers require a close gathering around, and reading from, the Torah.  Id. at \n¶¶104, 106.  Further, since the minyan must be present in the same room, the separate-car \nconcept of permitted drive-in services is not possible.  Id. at ¶109.  Additionally, “any type of \noperation of a vehicle is prohibited on the Sabbath, which is the day the main weekly service \ntakes place.”  Id. at ¶110. \n   Plaintiffs allege that the 10-person gathering limit applicable in New York City in Phase \n1, and the drive-in services, permitted by EOs 202.32 and 202.33 impose several burdens. Id. at \n¶107.  For instance, plaintiffs claim that, if services are limited to only a minyan, no one else can \nattend, including (1) women, (2) a young man intending to attend his own Bar Mitzvah, (2) “a \nbride-to-be at her own wedding,” or (3) “a newborn and his own circumcision.”  Id. at ¶¶108, \n111-112.  Additionally, plaintiff Schonbrun alleges that his son, who is not old enough to be part \nof a minyan, has been precluded from attending synagogue because of the 10-person gathering \nlimit.  Id. at ¶129.  Plaintiff Perr alleges that, because of the 10-person gathering limit, his son’s \nBar Mitvah, could not be held on May 2 at his synagogue, id. at ¶148, and his wife and six \nchildren have been unable to attend services.  Id.  Plaintiff Mayerfeld’s wife and daughter also \ncannot attend services.  Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 16 of 34\n \nARGUMENT \nTo establish entitlement to temporary preliminary relief under FRCP 65(b), a plaintiff \nmust satisfy a very heavy burden.6  Specifically, plaintiffs here must establish (1) the likelihood \nof success on the merits; (2) that they will suffer irreparable harm if a TRO is not issued; (3) that \nthe equities balance in their favor; and (4) that the TRO is in the public interest.  Amato v. \nElicker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87758, *7 (D. Conn. May 19, 2020) (applying this standard to an \napplication for a TRO challenging Executive Orders issued during the COVID-19 pandemic).  \nSee also Geller v. De Blasio, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87405, *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2020) \n(applying this standard to challenge of Executive Order relating to non-essential gatherings \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic); Lee v. Trump, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49860, *1 (S.D.N.Y. \nMarch 23, 2020) (applying this standard to challenge of travel ban during the COVID-19 \npandemic). Plaintiffs cannot satisfy any of these elements.  \nPOINT I \nPLAINTIFFS FAIL TO ESTABLISH  \nTHAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED  \nON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS \n \nThe TRO sought here must be denied based on the Supreme Court’s May 29, 2020 \ndecision in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 3041 (May 29, \n2020).  The plaintiffs in South Bay challenged an EO issued by the Governor of California that \nlimits “attendance at places of worship to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 \n                                                 \n6 In this Circuit, the standard that must be met is the same as the standard governing the issuance \nof a preliminary injunction.  Fairfield Cty. Med. Ass'n v. United Healthcare of New England, \n985 F. Supp. 2d 262, 270 (D. Conn. 2013), aff'd as modified sub nom, Fairfield Cty. Med. Ass'n \nv. United Healthcare of New England, Inc., 557 F. App'x 53 (2d Cir. 2014). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 17 of 34\n \nattendees.”  Id. at *1.  Concurring with the court’s denial of plaintiffs’ application for \npreliminary injunctive relief, Chief Justice Roberts stated as follows: \nAlthough California’s guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those \nrestrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment.  Similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular \ngatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports, and \ntheatrical performances, where large groups of people gather in close proximity \nfor extended periods of time.  And the [Executive] Order exempts or treats more \nleniently only dissimilar activities such as operating grocery stores, banks, and \nlaundromats, in which people neither congregate in large groups nor remain in \nclose proximity for extended periods. \n \nId. at *2.  \nThe same is true in New York.  As stated above, although places of worship in Phase 2 \nand Phase 3 regions may operate at 25 percent capacity under Executive Order 202.38, Kerwin \nDecl at Exh. 38, other places where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended \nperiods of time remain closed such as (1) indoor shopping malls; (2) large gathering/event \nvenues such as establishments that host concerts, conferences, or other in-person performances \nor presentations in front of an in-person audience; (3) in person gyms, fitness centers, and \nexercise classes; (4) video lottery and casino gaming facilities; (5) indoor movie theaters; and (6) \nplaces of public amusement, whether indoors or outdoors, including but not limited to, locations \nwith amusement rides, carnivals, amusement parks, water parks, aquariums, zoos, arcades, fairs, \nchildren’s play centers, funplexes, theme parks, bowling alleys, family and children’s attractions. \nHutton Decl. at ¶53. \nAs noted by Justice Roberts, when explaining the deference that must be accorded to \nstate officials responding to a pandemic,  \n[t]he precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be \nlifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to \nreasonable disagreement.  Our Constitution principally entrusts “[t]he safety and \nthe health of the people” to the politically accountable officials of the States to \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 18 of 34\n \n“guard and protect.” [Citation omitted]  When those officials “undertake[] to act \nin areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties,” their latitude “must be \nespecially broad.” [Citation omitted]  Where those broad limits are not exceeded, \nthey should not be subject to second-guessing by an “unelected federal judiciary,” \nwhich lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health \nand is not accountable to the people. [Citation omitted]  \n \nSouth Bay at **2-3.  Governor Cuomo is entitled to this deference in connection with the \nprotocols at issue here.   \nAs applicable to all of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims discussed below, the EOs and \nprotocols are supported by a rational basis and are entitled to deference by the court.  The \ngovernment must be afforded considerable deference in dealing with the health and safety of its \ncitizens, particularly in times of the outbreak of disease.  South Bay at **2-3.  See also Phillips v. \nCity of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 543 (2d Cir. 2015) (the “right to practice religion freely does not \ninclude liberty to expose the community…to communicable disease or…ill health or death”).  \nProtection of the public from a deadly, fast-spreading disease with no vaccine or cure is certainly \na significant state interest, Amato v. Elicker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87758, **28029 (D. Conn. \nMay 19, 2020), and the EOs and protocols have a “‘real and substantial relation’ to the state’s goal \nof curbing the spread of the virus.” Id. at *30. Accordingly, the EOs and protocols satisfy rational \nbasis review.    \nFor the reasons set forth below, plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs in South Bay, cannot \nestablish that they are likely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims, their application for \na TRO should be denied. \nA.  Free Exercise \nTo “state a free exercise claim, a plaintiff generally must establish that ‘the object of [the \nchallenged] law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of [its] religious motivation,’ or \nthat the law’s ‘purpose…is the suppression of religion or religious conduct.’”  Congregation of \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 19 of 34\n \nRabbinical College of Tartikov, Inc. v. Vill. of Pomona, 915 F.Supp.2d 574, 619 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) \n(quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993)). The right of \nthe free exercise of religion does not relieve an individual or entity of the obligation to comply \nwith a “valid and neutral law of general applicability.” Employment Div., Dept. of Human \nResources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990).  As a result, where an alleged limitation on the \nexercise of religion “is not the object ... but merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable \nand otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.”  Id. at 878.  See also \nBloomingburg Jewish Educ. Ctr. v. Village of Bloomingburg, 111 F.Supp.3d 459, 484 (S.D.N.Y. \n2015) (stating that a “law or regulation that is neutral and of general applicability is constitutional \neven if it has an incidental effect on religion”).  Therefore, a law that only incidentally imposes a \nburden on the exercise of religion need only be supported by a rational basis.  WTC Families for \na Proper Burial, Inc. v. City of New York, 567 F.Supp.2d 529, 539-540 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting \nLeebart v. Harrington, 332 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir. 2003)).  \nPlaintiffs’ free exercise claim should be dismissed because the EOs limiting gatherings, \nand associated physical limiting protocols and guidelines, do not target religion, are neutral and \ngenerally applicable, and any burden on religion is merely incidental. Both on their face, and when \nconsidered in connection with the ongoing pandemic, the EOs and protocols protect the entire \npublic at large. Accordingly, they are generally applicable.   \n They are also neutral.  The neutrality of a law is determined by the consideration of \nrelevant factors, including, inter alia, “the historical background of the decision under challenge,” \nand “the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question.” Church \nof Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. at 540.  Religious beliefs are not targeted by the \nEOs or protocols, and their “object” is plainly not to interfere with plaintiffs’, or anyone’s, exercise \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 20 of 34\n \nof religion.  Id. at 533 (“if the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of \ntheir religious motivation, the law is not neutral.”).  Rather, the plain text of the EOs, as well as \nthe series of events leading to their enactment and physical distancing protocols, establish that the \nobject of the EOs and protocols is to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Their purpose is to protect \npublic health.  \nPlaintiffs fail to offer any record evidence to support a finding that the EOs and protocols \nunconstitutionally disfavor religion.  Rather, they mischaracterize the EOs in an attempt to distract \nthe court from the fact that the adopted protocols were carefully calibrated to respond to the \ndistinctive environments they address based upon the risk of transmission.  \nFor example, gatherings of up to 50 people, including religious gatherings, were permitted \nunder EO 202.3, even though that EO ordered various businesses, such as restaurants, video lottery \nand casino gaming facilities, gyms, fitness centers and movie theaters, to close.  Kerwin Decl. at \nExh. 3. Gatherings, including religious gatherings, were permitted to continue up to 50 people \nwhen schools were closed by EO 202.4.  Id. at Exh. 4. They also continued to be permitted when \nindoor malls, and all places of public amusement, including but not limited to, locations with \namusement  rides,  carnivals,  amusement  parks,  water parks, aquariums, zoos, arcades, fairs, \nchildren’s play centers, funplexes, theme parks, bowling alleys, family and children’s attractions \nwere closed by EO 202.5.  Id. at Exh. 5. \nGatherings of up to 50 people continued to be permitted when the Governor ordered the \nreduction of the in-person workforce by 50 percent by EO 202.6.  Id. at Exh. 6.  They continued \nto be permitted when all personal care services businesses were ordered to close, and the in-person \nworkforce was reduced by 75 percent by EO 202.7. Id. at Exh. 7. When EO 202.8 reduced the in-\nperson workforce by 100 percent, gatherings up to 50 people continued to be permitted.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 21 of 34\n \nEO 202.10 prohibited all gatherings “of any size for any reason.”  Id. at Exh. 10. Thereafter, \nEO 202.31 permitted gatherings for religious and Memorial Day services up to 10 people. Id. at \nExh. 31.  Gatherings up to 10 people were later permitted by EO 202.33 for any purpose.  Id. at \nExh. 33.  Thereafter, notwithstanding the 10-person gathering limit applicable to all gatherings, \ndrive-in religious services were allowed to take place in Phase 1 regions without a gathering limit \nso  long  as  there  was  no  contact  between  participants.  Id.  at  Exhs.  32,  33.  In  Phase  2, \nnotwithstanding that all other large-capacity venues must remain closed, places of religious \nworship may open up to 25 percent capacity.  \nThis evolution of the closing and opening of New York demonstrates that, at no time, has \nreligion been disfavored or targeted in any way. But, for some unascertainable reason, plaintiffs \npoint to this careful consideration as unconstitutional “targeting” of religion. \nIn any event, any limitations on religion caused by the EOs or protocols are merely \nincidental.  As the complaint demonstrates, plaintiffs Soos and Stamos can, and have been, holding \nmasses in the North Country churches that they serve. Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶94, 97. That the services \ncannot take place at the times, with the frequency, and groups sizes that they prefer are merely \nincidental burdens not protected by the First Amendment. Id. at ¶¶89-97. Similarly, plaintiffs \nSchonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld may attend services as part of a minyan.7  Id. at ¶¶128, 148, 150, \n                                                 \n7 While plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld allege that their wives and children cannot \nattend services, they lack standing to assert any challenges on behalf of their wives, and are not \nalleged in the complaint to be bringing representative claims on behalf of their children. \nTypically, “a party ‘must assert his own legal rights’ and ‘cannot rest his claim to relief on the \nlegal rights . . . of third parties.’” Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S.Ct. 1678, 198 L. Ed. 2d \n150, 162 (2017) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975)).  As the complaint does \nnot allege that the wives of plaintiffs are “hindered” in any way in bringing their own lawsuit, id. \n(stating that hindrance must  “stem[] from disability,” not “disinterest,”), and plaintiffs did not \nassert representative claims on behalf of minor children, the claims are theirs alone. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 22 of 34\n \n160-161. Since gatherings up to 10-people are permitted – unlike at the times that they encountered \npolice intervention – they are not unlawful and may proceed.   \nSince they are both generally applicable and neutral, the EOs and protocols need only be \nsupported by a rational basis. See Fortress Bible Church v. Feiner, 694 F.3d 208, 220 (2d Cir \n2012).  As discussed above, they are so supported.  Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot establish that \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits of their free exercise claim. \nB.  Free Speech, Expressive Association and Assembly \nIn both their complaint, Dkt. No. 1, and memorandum of law in support of their TRO  \napplication, Dkt. No. 2-4, plaintiffs discuss the freedoms of speech, expressive association and \nassembly as a single concept and one cause of action.  Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶178-186; Dkt. No. 2-4 at \npp. 19-22. While plaintiffs may wish to conflate the issues to avoid appropriate constitutional \nanalysis, considerations of each First Amendment freedom are necessary to determine whether \nplaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. \n1.  Freedom of Speech \n  First, the First Amendment guarantee of free speech protects the right to be free from \ngovernment-compelled speech or expressive conduct.  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and \nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006); West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 \nU.S. 624, 642 (1943)).  It “prohibits the government from telling people what they must say,” not \nwhat they must do. Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 61.  Nothing in the EOs or protocols dictates what \nplaintiffs may or may not say.  Instead, they dictate how many people may congregate in a single \nspace at one time, and the distances people must maintain while doing so.  Because they regulate \nconduct, and not speech, the EOs and protocols do not implicate the right to free speech. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 23 of 34\n \n2.  Freedom of Expressive Association \nSecond,  the  First  Amendment  right  to  expressive  association  protects  the  “‘right  to \nassociate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, \nreligious, and cultural ends.’” Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. at 640, 647 (2000) (quoting \nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984)).  However, the freedom of association \n“is not absolute.” Id. at 648.  Incidental burdens on associational interests do not violate the First \nAmendment. Indeed, unless the burden on expressive association rights is “severe,” the law need \nonly be supported by a rational basis. Jacoby & Meyers, LLP v. Presiding Justices of the First, \nSecond, Third & Fourth Dep’ts, 852 F.3d 178, 191 (2d Cir. 2017).  \n  Here, any burden on expressive association rights resulting from the EOs or protocols are \nmerely incidental. “Mere incidental burdens on the right to associate do not violate the First \nAmendment; rather, to be cognizable, the interference with plaintiffs’ associational rights must \nbe direct and substantial or significant.” Tabbaa v. Chertoff, 509 F.3d 89, 101 (2d Cir. 2007) \n(internal quotation and alteration from original omitted); accord Fighting Finest v. Bratton, 95 \nF.3d 224, 228 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing Lyng v. Intl. Union, 485 U.S. 360, 367 & n.5 (1988)). For \nthe same reasons, discussed above, that any burden on plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion is \nincidental, so is any burden on plaintiffs’ expressive association rights.  Plaintiffs are not \nprecluded from associating for religious purposes; their groups must just be smaller and people \nmust maintain safe physical separation. The burdens alleged by plaintiffs are precisely the type \nof incidental burdens that the First Amendment does not protect. \n  For the same reasons discussed above in connection with plaintiffs’ free exercise claim, \nthe gathering limits, guidance, and physical distancing protocols are rationally related to the \nState’s interests in protecting the public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 24 of 34\n \n3.  Freedom of Assembly \n  Third, the “right of the people to peaceably assemble” is protected by the First \nAmendment.  U.S. Const. Amend. I.  “However, courts have long held that the constitutional \nright to assembly…is not absolute.”  Amato v. Elicker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87758, **27-28 \n(D. Conn. May 19, 2020).  Public gatherings may be stopped if they pose, inter alia, a “threat to \npublic safety.”  Papineau v. Parmley, 465 F.3d 46, 56 (2d Cir. 2006). \nWhen distilled to the facts as alleged by plaintiffs, plaintiffs’ actual argument appears to \nbe that the EOs limiting gatherings, and associated protocols, prevent them from assembling for \ncongregate religious purposes in locations of their choosing, in unlimited groups, without \nmaintaining safe physical distance.  Plaintiffs cannot succeed on the merits of this claim, and, \ntherefore, the TRO sought by plaintiffs should be denied for the same reasons that the TRO was \nrecently denied by the court in Amato v. Elicker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87758 (D. Conn. May \n19, 2020).   \nIn Amato, the restaurant owner plaintiffs challenged an EO limiting gatherings in \nConnecticut to six people in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Id.  at **1, 12.  Like the court in \nSouth Bay, the court in Amato relied heavily on the Supreme Court decision in Jacobson v. \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), and stated  \nwhile the power of state governments during an epidemic is, of course, not \nlimitless [citation omitted], Jacobson requires that courts refrain from second \nguessing state governments’ responses unless there is “no real or substantial \nrelation” between the actions and the public health and safety or the action is \n‘beyond all questions, a plain, palpable invasion of rights.    \n   \nAmato, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87758 at **28-29.  The court further stated that “[e]ven \nconstitutional rights, including First Amendment rights, are subject to ‘reasonable conditions’ to \npreserve public health.”  Id. at *29.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 25 of 34\n \n  Applying this standard8 to the 6-person gathering limitation, the court held that the \n“COVID-19 pandemic constitutes the sort of public health crisis—or ‘epidemic of disease which \nthreatens the safety of [a community’s] members’—contemplated by the Jacobson court, and the \nExecutive Order “has a ‘real and substantial relation’ to the state’s goal of curbing the spread of \nthe virus.”9  Id. at *30.   \n  The same result is required here.  The gathering limits challenged by plaintiffs are “not \n‘arbitrary,’ not ‘unreasonable,’ and not ‘beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of \nrights.’”  Id. at *31. While the EOs limit the size of gatherings, they do “not altogether prohibit \n[p]laintiffs from assembling with other people, nor [do they] limit with whom [p]laintiffs may \nassemble.  Courts have upheld more extreme measures taken in response to public health needs, \nincluding quarantines, which limit a person’s right to assemble with any other person.”  Id. \n(emphasis in original). \n  For these reasons, plaintiffs cannot succeed on the merits of their freedom of assembly \nclaim, and, therefore, plaintiffs’ request for a TRO should be denied.  Id. at **32, 39.  \nC.  Equal Protection \nPlaintiffs appear to challenge a perceived distinction between “essential gatherings  \n                                                 \n8 The court stated: “I find that the standard articulated in Jacobson applies here.  The decision has \nnever been overturned…Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, courts around the \ncountry have applied Jacobson’s standards to state orders intended to combat the virus. [Citations \nomitted.]”  Amato at **29-30.  See also Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 543 (2d Cir. \n2015) (“’The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community . . \n.  to communicable disease . . . .’”) (quoting Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166-67 \n(1944)). \n \n9 The court noted that the EO was “imposed in light of recommendations from the CDC and the \nConnecticut Department of Public Health to implement ‘community mitigation strategies to \nincrease containment of the virus’…”  Amato at *31.  \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 26 of 34\n \nwithout gathering-size limitations” and non-essential gatherings subject to “unique burdens.”  \nDkt. No. 2-4 at p. 21.  While difficult to comprehend, it appears that plaintiffs claim that \nreligious services are subject to different gathering limits than businesses and other activities.  Id. \nat p. 22.  See also Dkt. No. 1 at 187-197.  As noted above, the Supreme Court has recognized \nthat such distinctions are rational. South Bay at *2. \nThe Equal Protection Clause provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const., Amend.  XIV. Its command is \nessentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.  City of Cleburne \nv. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  An equal protection claim cannot be \nmaintained unless a plaintiff shows that it is not being treated the same as similarly situated \nindividuals.  New York State Club Assoc. v. Citv of New York, 487 US 1, 17-18 (1988); Tigner \nv. State of Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940) (the Equal Protection Clause “does not require things \nwhich are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same”).   \n  Like those in South Bay, the gathering restrictions applicable to other large-capacity \nindoor-gatherings are either the same, or stricter, than those applicable to places of worship.  \nSouth Bay at *2.  Places in which larger gathering limits are permitted involve “dissimilar \nactivities, such as…grocery stores, banks, and laundromats, in which people neither congregate \nin large groups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods.” Id.  Accordingly, to the \nextent that plaintiffs allege that the EOs and protocols permit higher gathering limits for \ndissimilar locations or activities, the Equal Protection clause is not implicated because the \ncomparators are not similarly situated. Additionally, because the gathering limits are rationally \nrelated to the State’s interests in protecting the public health, plaintiffs cannot establish that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 27 of 34\n \nD.  Lack of State Authority \nSince plaintiffs will not be able to succeed on the merits of their federal claims, the  \ncourt should decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).   Additionally, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits federal courts from \nordering state officials to conform their conduct to state law. Pennhurst State Sch. v. Halderman, \n465 U.S. 89 (1984).  As a result, plaintiffs cannot establish that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their state claims. \nIn addition, the EOs were issued in accordance with state and federal law. The power to \nimpose quarantines and other public health measures in response to a pandemic is among the \nmost fundamental police powers reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 (1905); Compagnie Francaise \nDe Navigation A Vapeur v. La. State Bd. of Health, 186 U.S. 380, 387 (1902); Morgan S.S. Co. \nv. La. Bd. of Health, 118 U.S. 455, 460 (1886); Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 203 \n(1824). “Upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right \nto protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.” \nJacobson, 197 U.S. at 27. Accordingly, “when [a] state faces a major public health threat…its \nTenth Amendment police and public health powers are at a maximum.” Legacy Church, Inc. v. \nKunkel, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68415, **97-98 (D.N.M. Apr. 17, 2020) (citing Prince v. \nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166-67 (1944) (“The right to practice religion freely does not \ninclude liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease….”)). \nThe standard of review accorded to a state’s exercise of its emergency police powers is \nhighly deferential. An action taken pursuant to those police powers must only be “reasonably \nnecessary” to respond to a public health emergency to survive constitutional scrutiny. Friends of \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 28 of 34\n \nDevito v. Wolf, 2020 Pa. LEXIS 1987, *39 (PA Sup. Ct., Apr. 13, 2020) (relying on Lawton v. \nSteele, 152 U.S. 133 (1894)). See also In re Abbott, 954 F.3d 772, 784 (5th Cir. 2020); Smith v. \nAvino, 91 F.3d 105, 109 (11th Cir. 1996) (“the scope of review is limited to . . . determin[ing] \nwhether” state “actions were taken in good faith and whether there is some factual basis” for \nthem); Legacy Church, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68415 at *122. The details of the response \nrepresent a “policy choice” within the governor’s discretion. Friends of Devito, 2020 Pa. LEXIS \n1987 at *39. See also In re Abbott, 954 F.3d at 791. Thus, invalidation of reasonable emergency \nmeasures promulgated pursuant to the state’s police power to respond to a global pandemic \n“would usurp the functions of another branch of government.” Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 28.   \nFar more intrusive measures than those at issue here fall within a state’s police power to \nrespond to a public health emergency.  See, e.g., id. at 26, 31 (state may compel vaccination \nagainst smallpox on pain of criminal prosecution); cf. Legacy Church, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 68415 (emergency order restricting places of worship to five individuals or fewer within \nstate’s police power); In re Abbot, 954 F.3d at 787-788 (holding that temporary ban on all “non-\nessential” abortions did not violate United States Constitution). In sum, emergency measures in \nthe face of a pandemic are “the most essential of powers, at times the most insistent, and always \none of the least limitable powers of government.” District of Columbia v. Brooke, 214 U.S. 138, \n149 (1909). \n1.  New York Statutory Law \nConsistent with the constitutional exercise of the State’s police power to respond to \nimminent threat to the health of the citizenry, the Executive Law gives the governor broad power \nto respond to a disaster such as COVID-19. See generally N.Y. Exec. Law Art. 2-b (“State and \nLocal Natural and Man-Made Disaster Preparedness”). “Whenever the governor, on his [or her] \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 29 of 34\n \nown initiative or pursuant to a request from one or more chief executives, finds that a disaster has \noccurred or may be imminent for which local governments are unable to respond adequately, he \nshall declare a disaster emergency by executive order.” N.Y. Exec Law § 28(1). A “disaster” is \nany “occurrence or imminent, impending or urgent threat of wide spread or severe damage, \ninjury, or loss of life or property resulting from any natural or man-made causes, including, but \nnot limited to . . . disease outbreak . . . .” Id. at § 20(2)(a). \n The EO declaring a state disaster emergency “shall include a description of the disaster, \nand the affected area.” Id. at § 28(3). The state disaster emergency starts on the date of the \ndeclaration and ends “upon the termination” of the disaster declaration. Id. at § 20(2)(b). The \ninitial state disaster emergency declaration cannot exceed six months, but “[t]he governor may \nissue additional orders to extend the state disaster emergency for additional periods not to exceed \nsix months.” Id. at § 28(3). \nThe EOs issued to address the COVID-19 pandemic, Kerwin Decl. at Exhs. 0-40, are in \ncompliance with these standards.  As mentioned above, on March 7, 2020, Governor Cuomo \nissued EO 202. Supporting the executive order, the Governor found “that a disaster is impending \nin New York State, for which the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately.” \nKerwin Decl., Exh. 0. Accordingly, the Governor declared a “state disaster emergency for the \nentire state of New York,” to be in effect until September 7, 2020. Id. EO 202, and each \nsubsequent EO, references the current state disaster emergency. \nSince the EOs were issued in accordance with the Executive Law, plaintiffs cannot \ndemonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the EOs were issued \nin excess of the Governor’s statutory authority. \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 30 of 34\n \n2.  New York Constitution \nPlaintiffs allege that the EOs and protocols violate the separation of powers doctrine  \nderived from New York’s Constitution.  Dkt. No. 1 at 203-205 (alleging violations of art. III, § 1; \nart. IV, § 1; art. VI).  Contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions, legislative action as not required to \nimplement the EOs and associated protocols.   \n“Article III of the State Constitution vests the Senate and the Assembly with the \nlegislative power of the State, while article IV vests the executive power in the Governor and \narticle VI vests the court system with the judicial power.”  Saratoga County Chamber of \nCommerce v. Pataki, 100 N.Y.2d 801, 821 (2003) (citing N.Y. Const. art. III, § 1; art. IV, § 1; \nart. VI, § 1). The Court of Appeals has recognized that these \"‘separate grants of power to each \nof the coordinate branches of government’ imply that each branch is to exercise power within a \ngiven sphere of authority.” Id. (quoting Clark v Cuomo, 66 N.Y.2d 185, 189 (1985).  See also \nBourquin v Cuomo, 85 N.Y.2d 781, 784 (1995); Matter of New York State Health Facilities \nAssn. v Axelrod, 77 N.Y.2d 340, 349 (1991). \nSince, as described above, the EOs were issued in accordance with the authority granted \nto the Governor by the New York Legislature through the enactment of Article 2-b of the \nExecutive Law, plaintiffs cannot establish that the EOs were issued in excess of the Governor’s \nauthority.  \nSince plaintiffs have failed to make the requisite showing that they are likely to succeed \non any of their causes of action, their motion for a TRO must be denied.  However, even if, \narguendo, the court finds that likelihood of success has been sufficiently proven, plaintiffs’ \napplication for temporary injunctive relief should nevertheless be denied because plaintiffs \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 31 of 34\n \ncannot establish that (1) they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a TRO, (2) the \nequities balance in their favor, or (3) the issuance of TRO is in the public interest \nPOINT II \nPLAINTIFFS FAIL TO ESTABLISH THAT  \nTHEY WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM IF A  \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IS NOT  \nGRANTED DURING THE PENDENCY OF THEIR  \nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n“Although ‘the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,’” courts “have not consistently presumed \nirreparable harm in cases involving allegations of the abridgement of First Amendment rights[.]” \nBronx Household of Faith v. Bd. of Educ., 331 F.3d 342, 349 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)).  See also CompassCare v. Cuomo, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n98930, *30 (N.D.N.Y. June 5, 2020).  A movant is entitled to the presumption that a loss of First \nAmendment freedoms constituted irreparable harm only when he or she “alleges injury from a \nrule or regulation that directly limits” a First Amendment right. Bronx Household of Faith, 331 \nF.3d at 349 (emphasis added).  See also Rossi v. Fischer, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158064, *40 \n(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2014).   \nIn this case, irreparable harm should not be presumed because, as discussed above, \nplaintiffs are not being prohibited from exercising their rights; instead, the manner in which they \nmay exercise them has changed – including the size of the groups in which they may congregate.  \nPlaintiffs devote only two paragraphs of their memorandum of law to the issue of irreparable \nharm, relying only on an expectation that such harm should be presumed simply because \nplaintiffs have alleged violations of First Amendment rights in their complaint.  Dkt. No. 2-4 at \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 32 of 34\n \np. 23-24. By doing so, plaintiffs have ignored the reality of the limitations imposed by the EOs \nand protocols, and the fact that they may still exercise their rights.   \nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that plaintiffs Soos and Stamos can perform and attend \nSunday masses. Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶94, 97. The complaint also alleges that worshippers of at \nchurches served by plaintiffs Soos and Stamos can work within the 25% limitation capacity.  Id. \nat 93, 94. It simply is not unconstitutional to require priests to work more, or differently, than \nthey prefer.  Similarly, the discomfort associated with attending services in vehicles, id. at 97, \nand the logistical difficulties associated with performing drive-in services, id., are not irreparable \nharms that preliminary injunctive relief is designed to prevent.   \nPlaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld have failed to allege, must less prove or \nsupport, any irreparable harm at all.  They are all permitted to participate in a minyan.  Nothing \nabout the EOs currently in effect may prevent it.  Plaintiffs’ claims about alleged harms they \nsuffered in March and April are completely irrelevant to whether they will suffer irreparable \nharm before a decision is issued on plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nAdditionally, speculative harm is not sufficient to entitle a party to a TRO.  The \ncomplaint alleges that the Nicholville church may exceed gathering limits when children return \nto school.  Since children are not now in school, any harms associated with school days is \nirrelevant to whether plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the short period before the court \nissues a decision on plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  Similarly, speculation about \nweddings, Dkt. No. 1 at ¶96, or burial services, id. at ¶101, that may occur in the future is \nprecisely the type of “harm” that is insufficient to support a finding of irreparable harm \nnecessary to justify a TRO.  \nAdditionally, plaintiffs have not submitted any declarations from any plaintiff, or any  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 33 of 34\n \nother member of plaintiffs’ churches or synagogues, to demonstrate that the EOs have, in fact, \nhindered anyone’s ability to assemble and participate in congregate religious services. In fact, the \nallegations of the complaint, itself, document that masses are still being held and attended in the \nNorth Country churches served by plaintiffs Soos and Stamos, and the plaintiffs living in \nBrooklyn may, and are, attending services.  In light of this record, plaintiffs necessarily cannot \nestablish that they will suffer irreparable harm in the short period before their preliminary \ninjunction motion is heard and decided. \nPOINT III \nTHE EQUITIES BALANCE IN FAVOR OF THE  \nSTATE’S EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC  \nHEALTH DURING THE EXISTING PANDEMIC,  \nAND ISSUANCE OF A TRO IS NOT IN THE  \nPUBLIC INTEREST \nBecause plaintiffs cannot establish the likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, \nor irreparable harm, the court need not consider “the public’s interests in a temporary restraining \norder or the balance of the equities.” Amato at **38-39.  In any event, and critically, the equities \nbalance in favor of continuing the State’s aggressive response to a deadly pandemic, in \naccordance with the State’s thoroughly informed, complex paradigm based upon a “dynamic and \nfact intensive” analysis, without the interference of the courts that lack such expertise.  South \nBay at *3.  Moreover, the risk of resurgence countenances against any short relief requested by \nplaintiffs.  For these reasons, a TRO would not be in the public interest and would, in fact, run \ncounter to the public intertest in stopping the spread of the virus. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons discussed above, and in the declaration of Brad Hutton submitted \nherewith and incorporated herein, and the facts supported by the exhibits annexed to the Hutton \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 18   Filed 06/15/20   Page 34 of 34\n \ndeclaration and the declaration of Adrienne J.

In  order  to \nestablish their entitlement to a preliminary injunction against government action taken in the \npublic interest, Plaintiffs must establish (1) that they will be irreparably injured if the relief \nsought is not granted; (2) that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims; (3) that a \nbalance of the hardships tips decidedly in their favor; and (4) that an injunction would be in the \npublic  interest.  See Trump  v.  Deutsche  Bank  AG,  943  F.3d  627,  637-640  (2d  Cir.  2019) \n(citations omitted); Cent. Rabbinical Cong. of the United States v. New York City Dep’t of Health \n& Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 192 (2d. Cir. 2014); Plaza Health Labs., Inc. v. Perales, 878 \nF.2d  577,  580  (2d  Cir.  1989).  See  also  Bery  v.  City  of  New  York,  97  F.3d  689  (2d  Cir. \n1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1251 (1997). \nThe Second Circuit has held that “[v]iolations of First Amendment rights are \ncommonly considered irreparable injuries for the purposes of a preliminary injunction,” Bery, 97 \nF.3d at 693. “Although a showing of irreparable harm is often considered the ‘single most \nimportant prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction,’ Faiveley transp. Malmo AB \nv. Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted), ‘[c]onsideration of the \nmerits is virtually indispensable in the First Amendment context, where the likelihood of success \non the merits is the dominant, if not the dispositive, factor.’ N.Y. Progress and Prot. PAC v. \nWalsh, 733 F.3d 488 (2d Cir. 2013).” Geller v. de Blasio, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87405, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y May 18, 2020). \nPlaintiffs here are unable to succeed on the merits of their claims as they relate to \nDefendant Mayor de Blasio, asserting that the gathering limitation of more than 10 set forth in \nNew York State Executive Order No. 202.33 and New York City Emergency Executive Order \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 7 of 16\nNo. 115 (collectively “the gathering limitation”) violates their First Amendment rights (Free \nSpeech and Free Exercise) and their substantive due process rights.  Preliminarily, it is important \nto note there are three New York State Executive Orders that restrict local governments from \nacting  inconsistently with, or without approval of, the state government.  New York State \nExecutive Order No. 202.3 states that “[n]o local government or political subdivision shall issue \nany local emergency order or declaration of emergency or disaster inconsistent with, conflicting \nwith or superseding the foregoing directives, or any other executive order issued under Section \n24 of the Executive Law . . . .”  See Exhibit “1” to the accompanying Declaration of Ellen \nParodi, dated June 15, 2020 (“Parodi Dec.”).  New York State Executive Order No. 202.5 states \nthat “no locality or political subdivision shall issue any local emergency order or executive order \nwith respect to response of COVID-19 without the approval of the State Department of Health.”  \nSee id.  New York State Executive Order No. 202.19 states that “[n]o local government official \nshall take any action that could impede or conflict with any other local government actions, or \nstate  actions, with respect to  managing the COVID-19 public health emergency.”   See  id.  \nAccordingly, it is clear that Plaintiffs challenge the State’s actions in responding to the COVID-\n19 public health emergency, and any actions made by Defendant de Blasio merely follow the \nNew York State Executive Orders.  \nFurthermore, the City is currently only in Phase 1 of the Governor’s phased \nreopening plan, and thus the portion of the New York State Executive Order authorizing houses \nof worship to operate at 25% capacity is not in effect in New York City. See Exhibit “3” to the \nParodi Dec. Only the gathering limitation prohibiting gatherings with more than 10 people (New \nYork State Executive Order No. 202.33 and New York City Emergency Executive Order No. \n115) is in effect in New York City.  See Exhibit “2” to the Parodi Dec. Therefore, Defendant de \n1\nBlasio  does  not  address  Plaintiffs’  claims  regarding  houses  of  worship  operating  at  25% \ncapacity. \n \n New York City Emergency Executive Order 115 has recently been renewed and, as of the date of this \n1\nMemorandum of Law, is in effect in New York City.  See Exhibit “6” to the Parodi Dec. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 8 of 16\n \nA. Plaintiffs’ Free Speech Claim Lacks Merit \nAs  early  as  1905,  the  Supreme  Court,  in  the  seminal  case  Jacobson  v. \nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 31, 25 S. Ct. 358, 363 (1905), acknowledged that in matters of \npublic health and safety, deference is due to the state and legislative body.  The Court explained \nthat when reviewing a statute “purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the \npublic morals or the public safety,” that allegedly violates a fundamental right, the statute must \nnot be disturbed unless it “has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all \nquestion, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law...” Jacobson, 197 \nU.S. at 31. \nIndeed, the Southern District of New York has recently held on two occasions that \nthe emergency gathering limitation does not violate the First Amendment right of freedom of \nspeech and assembly.  See Geller, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87405 (S.D.N.Y May 18, 2020) and \nButler v. City of New York, 20-cv-4067 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2020) annexed to the Parodi Dec. as \nExhibit “4.” In Geller, the plaintiff challenged the emergency gathering limitation in effect at \nthat  time  which  prohibited  gatherings  of  any  size.     The  Geller  plaintiff  argued  that  the \n2\nprohibition of gatherings prohibited her desire to protest in a group in public.  The district court \nin Geller found that the gathering limitation (even before it allowed up to 10 people to gather) \nwas content-neutral and passed intermediate scrutiny.   The Court in Geller explained in relevant \npart: \nThe March 25 Executive Order is content-neutral. It orders “any \nnon-essential gathering of individuals of any size for any reason.” \n \n2 The Emergency Orders at issue are temporary in nature, including the gathering limitation.  See Ex. “2” \nto the Parodi Dec.  Indeed, as the emergency situation surrounding the COVID-19 public health crisis \nshifted, the restrictions on non-essential gatherings eased, shifting the prohibition on gatherings of any \nsize, to allowing gatherings of 10 or fewer individuals.  See id. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 9 of 16\nIt does not target the contents of the speech itself or the listener’s \nagreement or disagreement with those contents. Instead, it targets \nthe harmful secondary effects of public gathering -- the spread of a \nnovel  virus  for  which  there  currently  is  no  cure  or  effective \ntreatment. \nGeller, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87405 at *10.  The Second Circuit recently denied Geller’s \napplication for a TRO pending appeal. See Geller v. de Blasio, 20-1592 (2d Cir. June 4, 2020) \nannexed to the Parodi Dec. as Exhibit “5.” \nIn Butler, the plaintiffs had been arrested for violating the gathering limitation \nwhile protesting in a group of approximately 20 in City Hall Park, and sought to enjoin further \nenforcement of the  executive order, claiming it violated their  First Amendment rights.  See \nButler, Exhibit “4.” In the midst of the protests and demonstrations in response to the unfortunate \ncircumstances surrounding the death of George Floyd that ensued during the Butler plaintiffs’ \napplication for a temporary restraining order, and despite Plaintiffs’ arguments that the protests \ndemonstrated that the limitation was not content-neutral, the Southern District of New York \nagain upheld the gathering limitation as  content-neutral and narrowly tailored.  See Butler, \nExhibit “4” (Transcript at 7-8, 31).  These decisions are consistent with decisions in many other \ncases across the country similarly challenging limitations on gatherings due to COVID-19 on \nFirst Amendment free speech and assembly grounds.  See e.g., Antietam Battlefield Koa v. \nHogan,  2020  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  88883  (D.  Md.  May  20,  2020)  (finding  that  state  orders \nrestricting, among other things, gatherings of over 10 people, was content-neutral and passed \nintermediate scrutiny); Givens v. Newsom, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81760 (E.D.C.A. May 8, \n2020) (finding California’s Stay at Home order was content-neutral and did not run afoul of the \nFree Speech Clause); see also Amato v. Elicker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87758 (D. Conn. May \n19, 2020); Open Our Oregon v. Brown, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87942 (D. Or. May 19, 2020).  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 10 of 16\nPlaintiffs have pointed to no case law or basis for this Court to not follow these well-reasoned \ndecisions.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their free speech claim. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Free Exercise of Religion Claim Fails \nWhile Plaintiffs have also brought a free exercise of religion claim under the First \nAmendment, which Geller and Butler did not address, Plaintiffs’ are likewise not likely to \nsucceed on the merits of that claim.  The Supreme Court long ago decreed that “[t]he right to \npractice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community... to communicable \ndisease.” Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166-67 (1944). It is well established that “a law \nthat is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental \ninterest  even  if  the  law  has  the  incidental  effect  of  burdening  a  particular  religious \npractice.” Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F.3d 538 (2d Cir. 2015)(quoting Church of the \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531, 113 S. Ct. 2217, 124 L. Ed. 2d \n472 (1993)).  See also Cent. Rabbinical Cong. of the United States 763 F.3d at 198. The plain \nlanguage of the gathering limitation indicates that it is not targeted at a particular religious \npractice nor does it discriminate against a religious belief. See e.g. New Hope Family Servs. v. \nPoole, 387 F. Supp. 3d 194, 215 (N.D.N.Y. 2019) (“The plain language of the regulation \ndemonstrates its neutrality, which makes no reference to religion…”).  Indeed, the gathering \nlimitation applies to any non-essential gathering for any purpose.  See Ex. 2 to the Parodi Dec.  \nMoreover, several courts across the country have found similar  orders to be \nneutral and generally applicable, and not a violation of the free exercise of religion.  See Cassell \nv. Snyders, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77512 (N.D. Ill. May 3, 2020) (rejecting a Free Exercise \nClause challenge to Illinois’ limit on gathering to no more than ten people, as the limit was \nneutral and generally applicable, even where religious services were listed in the state’s order, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 11 of 16\nand passed rational basis review); Cross Culture Christian Center v. Newsom, 2020 U.S. Dist \nLEXIS  79155  (E.D.  Cal..  May  5,  2020)  (rejecting  a  Free  Exercise  Clause  challenge  to \nCalifornia’s order on mass gatherings, as the order was neutral, generally applicable, and passed \nrational basis review); Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. Dist LEXIS \n84348 (N. D. Ill. May 13, 2020) (rejecting a Free Exercise Clause challenge to Illinois’ limit on \ngatherings to no more than ten people, as the limit was neutral, generally applicable, and passed \nrational basis review); see also Antietam Battlefield KOA v. Hogan, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n99993 (D. Md. May 20, 2020); Spell v. Edwards, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85909 (M.D. La. May \n15, 2020); Davis v. Berke, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74057 (E.D. Tenn. April 17, 2020); Legacy \nChurch, Inc. v. Kunkel, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68415 (D. N.M. April 17, 2020). \nIn fact, the Supreme Court recently denied an application for injunctive relief \nregarding an Executive Order issued by the Governor of California restricting social interactions \nand gatherings.  See South Bay United Pentecostal v. Newsom, 2020 WL 2813056, 590 U.S. ___ \n(May  29,  2020).    The  Supreme  Court  acknowledged  that  the  California  guidelines  place \nrestrictions on houses of worship, but found them to be consistent with the Free Exercise Clause \nof the First Amendment.  Id. at *1.  The Supreme Court further reiterated its view of the limited \nrole  the  judicial  branch  should  have  in  deciding  when  such  restrictions  should  be  lifted, \nexplaining: \nThe  precise  question  of  when  restrictions  on \nparticular social activities should be lifted during \nthe pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter \nsubject  to  reasonable  disagreement.    Our \nConstitution principally entrusts “[t]he safety and \nthe  health  of  the  people  to  the  politically \naccountable officials of the States “to guard and \nprotect.”  Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, \n38 (1905).  When those officials “undertake[] to act \nin  areas  fraught  with  medical  and  scientific \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 12 of 16\nuncertainties,”  their  latitude  “must  be  especially \nbroad.”  Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, \n427  (1974).    Where  those  broad  limits  are  not \nexceeded,  they  should  not  be  subject  to  second-\nguessing by an “unelected federal judiciary,” which \nlacks the background, competence, and expertise to \nassess public health and is not accountable to the \npeople.  See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan \nTransit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 545 (1985).3   \nId at *1. \nPlaintiffs’ argument that the gathering limitation is not a neutral law of general \napplicability in light of the purported “exemption” given to the protests in response to the \nunfortunate  circumstances  surrounding  the  death  of  George  Floyd  lacks  merit.    The  plain \ncontent-neutral language of the gathering limitation has not changed – all gatherings of 10 or \nmore persons in New York City are prohibited.  Nor have Plaintiffs demonstrated that the \nlimitation has not been enforced with regard to other comparable, secular gatherings.   See \n4\nAntietam Battlefield KOA v. Hogan, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99993 at *21-22 (D. Md. May 20, \n2020)  (discussing  that  the  proper  comparison  is  with  comparable  secular  activities  and \n \n Consistent with this decision, the declaration of Dr. George Delgado, Plaintiffs’ purported expert, should \n3\nbe disregarded by the Court.  Additionally, it is worth noting that Dr. Delgado does not claim to have \nexperience in public health or epidemiology, and failed to name the medical practice and hospice that he \nis affiliated with.  Upon information and belief, Dr. Delgado is the medical director of Culture of Life \nFamily Health.  See “Doctor Claiming to ‘Reverse’ Abortion Was Told to Stop Using Medical School’s \nName,” The Guardian, July 25, 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/revealed-doctor-\nreverse-abortion-trump-administration (last visited June 13, 2020).  Finally, because the New York City \nresident Plaintiffs Daniel Schonburn, Elchanan Perr and Mayer Mayerfeld are not representatives of \nspecific religious institutions, and appear to attend multiple synagogues, it is wholly unclear whether and \nhow they are positioned to ensure the implementation of the necessary safety precautions that Dr. \nDelgado recommends.  See Complaint at ¶ 103. \n \n \n Plaintiffs claim that religious services are comparable to protests as people are standing in close \n4\nproximity and singing.  However, there is one key difference between the two, which is that the vast \nmajority of religious services are held indoors while the protests occur outdoors. It is safe to say that \nunlike Plaintiffs Rev. Steven Soos’ and Rev. Nicholas Stamos’ church in the North District, most houses \nof worship in New York City lack outdoor space, or outdoor space large enough for large groups of \nworshipers,  let  alone  socially  distant  worshipers.    Moreover,  notably  Dr.  Delgado’s  safety \nrecommendations do not include that the congregants or clergy wear face coverings.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 13 of 16\ndistinguishing religious services from essential services and retail).  See also South Bay United \nPentecostal v. Newsom, 2020 WL 2813056 at *1, 590 U.S. ___ (2020). \nMoreover, while public safety considerations surrounding recent protests in the \nCity have led to a temporary relaxation in enforcement of the gathering limitation, the limitation \nnevertheless remains in effect.  City officials are addressing the ongoing public health crisis as it \noverlaps with the public safety concerns raised by the protests to the best of their ability, under \ndynamic and often fraught circumstances.  The limitation should not be disturbed simply because \npublic safety considerations  factored into decision-making surrounding enforcement. As the \nDistrict Court of Nevada explained in a recent decision addressing similar claims: \nOutdoor protests involve dynamic large interactions \nwhere state officials must also consider the public \nsafety  implications  of  enforcement  of  social \ndistancing.  That  is  to  say  that  such  enforcement \ncould result in greater harm than that sought to be \navoided  by  the  Directive.  The  choice  between \nwhich regulations or laws shall be enforced in social \nsettings  is  a  choice  allocated  generally  to  the \nexecutive, not the judiciary, absent clear patterns of \nunconstitutional selective enforcement. \nCalvary v. Sisolak, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103234 at *12 (D. Nev. June 10, 2020) \nFurther, it has been noted that health experts and other officials are concerned that \nthe protests in cities all over the U.S. may well lead to another spike in COVID-19 cases.    \n5\n \n5 See, e.g., “How to Protest Safely During the COVID-19 Pandemic,” NYC Health, June 8, 2020, \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-safe-protest.pdf  (last  visited  June  14, \n2020); “Experts Sound Alarm Over Coronavirus Spread as U.S. Ramps Up Reopening, Prepares for More \nProtests,” The Wall Street Journal, June 6, 2020,  https://www.wsj.com/articles/experts-sound-alarm-\nover-coronavirus-spread-as-u-s-ramps-up-reopening-prepares-for-more-protests-11591395463  (last \nvisited June 13, 2020);  “Protests Draw Shoulder-to Shoulder Crowds After Months of Virus Isolation,” \nThe  New  York  Times,  June  3,  2020,  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/coronavirus-protests-\ngeorge-floyd.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage  (last  visited  June  13,  2020); \n“Will  Protests  Set  Off  a  Second  Viral  Wave?”  The  New  York  Times,  May  31,  2020  \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/health/protests-coronavirus.html  (last  visited  June  13,  2020); \nGovernor Cuomo “voiced strong concerns that days of crowded and chaotic protests in New York City \nagainst racism and deadly police brutality could set off a second wave of coronavirus infections.”  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 14 of 16\nTherefore,  the  fact  that  the  City  has  temporarily  relaxed  its  enforcement  of  the  gathering \nlimitation in the context of the protests out of a need to balance public safety concerns with \npublic  health  concerns,  does  not  undermine  the  neutrality  or  general  applicability  of  the \ngathering  limitation  as  a  limitation  on  all  gatherings  of  more  than  10  people.    Therefore, \nPlaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their free exercise of religion claim. \nC. Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process Claims Are Not Likely to \nSucceed \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ are not likely to succeed on their equal protection claim, as \nPlaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the City has  not chosen to enforce the  gathering \nlimitation toward others that are similarly situated, such as comparable secular activities.  See \nCine SK8, Inc. v. Town of Henrietta, 507 F.3d  778, 790 (2d Cir. 2007)  (internal citations \nomitted); NRA of Am. v. Cuomo, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78958, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. 2019).  As \nnoted above, the gathering limitation applies to all non-essential gatherings.  See Ex. 2 of Parodi \nDec. \nMoreover, to the extent Plaintiffs allege a violation of substantive due process, \nsuch claim is not likely to succeed on the merits as Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they \n \n“Michigan Lifts a Stay-at-Home Order, and New York Warns that Protests Could Set Off Infections,” \nThe New York Times, June 1, 2020,   https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/world/coronavirus-world-\nnews.html  (last visited June 13, 2020).   \nIn recognition of the current situation, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued the \nfollowing guidelineson May 30, 2020 for safe protesting:   \n“Plan to protest? Here are tips to reduce the risk of spreading #COVID19: \n✔️Wear a face covering \n✔️Wear eye protection to prevent injury \n✔️Stay hydrated \n✔️Use hand sanitizer \n✔️Don't yell; use signs & noise makers instead \n✔️Stick to a small group \n✔️Keep 6 feet from other groups— nychealthy (@nycHealthy) May 30, 2020” \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 15 of 16\nwere deprived of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property right.  See Rother v. NYS Dep’t \nof Correction and Community Supervision, 970 F. Supp. 2d 78, 100 (N.D.N.Y. 2013) (holding \nthat  “[b]ecause  the  claim  for  substantive  due  process  is  subsumed  by  Plaintiff's’  other \nconstitutional claims, it must be dismissed”).  Indeed, as recognized by the Second Circuit, in the \nabsence of a viable First Amendment claim, as noted in the seminal public health Supreme Court \ndecision  in  Jacobson  v.  Massachusetts,  197  U.S.  at  26,  which  rejected  a  challenge  to  a \nMassachusetts  mandatory  smallpox  vaccination  law,  forecloses  a  substantive  due  process \nchallenge by Plaintiffs here.  See Caviezel v. Great Neck Pub. Schools, 500 Fed. Appx. 16, 19 \n(2d  Cir.  2012).    Therefore,  Plaintiffs  are  unlikely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their  equal \nprotection or substantive due process claims. \nD. The Balance of Hardships Tips Decidedly in the City’s Favor \nAside from the fact that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims, any harm to Plaintiffs is substantially outweighed by the City’s significant interest in \nprotecting the public during this unprecedented public health emergency.  Indeed, in Geller v. de \nBlasio, the Court acknowledged the City’s interest in slowing “the spread of a virus that has \nhospitalized and killed tens of thousands of New Yorkers and infected hundreds of thousands \nmore.”   See Geller v. de Blasio, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS, at *10.  Accordingly, given the \nparamount importance of the City’s interest in protecting the public health, the balance of \nhardships tips decidedly in Defendant de Blasio’s favor. \n \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 19-7   Filed 06/15/20   Page 16 of 16\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant Mayor Bill de Blasio respectfully requests \nthat  this  Court  deny  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  preliminary \ninjunction, together with such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \nDated:  New York, New York \nJune 15, 2020 \nJAMES E.

PLAINTIFFS AND PROSPECTIVE AMICUS CURIAE AHUVA KLEINMAN \nARE STILL ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DEPRIVATION OF THEIR \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BY DEFENDANTS’ LIMITATIONS ON \nCONGREGATE WORSHIP.                 \nDefendant DeBlasio argues, in the DeBlasio Supplement, that because New York City has \nmoved to Phase II, which permits synagogues to exceed the previous limitation of ten worshippers \nas long as they remain under the 25% capacity requirement set by the State, “There is no reason to \nbelieve that the vast majority of synagogues will not have sufficient capacity to allow a minyan \nplus  some  additional  people  while  still  under  the  25%  capacity  requirement  set  by  the \nState… Therefore, as the ten- person gathering limitation on indoor religious services is no longer \nin effect in the City, and the Phase 2 allowance of 25% capacity should resolve the NYC Plaintiffs’ \nalleged harm, their claim for injunctive relief should be denied.”  But the DeBlasio Supplement \ndoes not tell the whole story. \nIn fact, current New York State guidelines require six feet of distancing around each \nperson, even during Phase II, which limit is extended to 12 feet for “singing activity.”  See, \n“Religious and Funeral Services Summary Guidance” attached hereto as Exhibit A.  Since \nintermittent singing by all congregants is a routine component  of Orthodox Jewish prayer, \nespecially on the Sabbath or during a wedding ceremony, the twelve-foot radius is effectively the \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 34   Filed 06/25/20   Page 4 of 5\nreal one for all Orthodox Jewish congregations.  In light of the population and building density of \nNew York City, under these requirements many synagogues would, contrary to the DeBlasio \nSupplement, not have sufficient room under these restrictions to allow more than ten people to \nworship spaced 12 feet apart. Phase II, therefore, provide little or no effective relief either with \nrespect to the state guidelines in general, or with regard to the issues raised in Mrs. Kleinman’s the \namicus brief in particular.  \nMore specifically, using data generated through a standard social distance calculator such \nas the one provided by the State of Colorado (https://covid19.colorado.gov/safer-at-home/social-\ndistancing-calculator-for-indoor-and-outdoor-events),  a  synagogue  would  need  approximately \n1800 square feet to accommodate a mere eleven people suspected of possible singing under the \nguideline-imposed distance of 12 feet between individuals, assuming – conservatively – 15% of \nfloor space as occupied by furniture.  Consequently, the revised capacity allowance of 25% still \nimposes significant limits on the number of people who may attend worship services, especially \nin the very many smaller synagogues, once the social distancing requirement is understood, \nbecause of the “singing” restrictions, as 12 feet instead of six.   \nWith respect to the issues raised by Mrs. Kleinman in her original proposed brief, therefore, \nwhat amounts essentially to a ban on women and children attending synagogue worship services \nis effectively still in place except with regard to the largest, and by far least common, synagogue \nsanctuaries. Her synagogue is actually just under 1800 square feet at 1750 square feet, and usually \naccommodates approximately 60 males and 10-20 females at Sabbath services. Not only would \nthe “generous” new guidelines keep that ban in place per the above calculation, it cannot even be \njustified on public health grounds, because New York State has had one of the lowest relative \npercentages of COVID cases in the nation for weeks now and, along with New York City, allows \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 34   Filed 06/25/20   Page 5 of 5\na host of activities to occur, indoors and out, without respect to social distancing – activities that, \nunlike congregate worship, are not entitled to special protection under the First Amendment. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Amicus respectfully urge this Court to grant the Temporary \nRestraining Order requested in the Complaint. \nMANDELBAUM SALSBURG, P.C. \n \n \n___________________________ \n        Ronald D.

Kerwin, on the date noted below and pursuant to § 1746 of title 28 of the \nUnited States Code, declares the following to be true and correct under penalty of perjury under \nthe laws of the United States of America: \n1.  I am an Assistant Attorney General of counsel in this matter to Letitia James, \nAttorney General of the State of New York, attorney for defendants Governor Andrew M. Cuomo \nand Attorney General Letitia James (“State defendants”). \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 33   Filed 06/22/20   Page 2 of 4\n2.  I submit this declaration on behalf of the State defendants in further opposition to \nplaintiffs’ application for preliminary injunctive relief in the above-captioned action. \n3.  On June 11, 2020, plaintiffs filed an application for a temporary restraining order \n(“TRO”).  Dkt. No. 7.   \n4.  Following submissions on a very short schedule, the Court heard oral argument on \nthat application on June 17, 2020.  Dkt. at 6/17/2020.   \n5.  During argument, the Court informed the parties that it intended to issue a ruling as \nto both the TRO and plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction by Friday, June 26, 2020.  \nBecause defendants Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James (“the State \ndefendants”) had not had sufficient opportunity to submit to the Court all information and \nargument relevant to plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction — and, as a result, filed a \nsubmission in opposition to the TRO application only — in the time allotted, Dkt. Nos. 17, 18, 20, \nthe Court granted all parties until June 22, 2020 to supplement the record. \n6.  Since  the  June  15,  2020  submission  by  the  State  Defendants,  the  following \nExecutive Orders were issued: \nExhibit 41:  Executive Order No. 202.41 (“EO 202.41”); \nExhibit 42:  Executive Order No. 202.42 (“EO 202.42”); \nExhibit 43:  Executive Order No. 202.43 (“EO 202.43”); \n7.  EO 202.42 increased the gathering limitation in Phase 3 regions to 25 people.  Exh. \n42.  \n8.  As of June 22, 2020, New York City has entered Phase 10.

For the court’s convenience, relevant decisions rendered after the State defendants’ \nJune 15, 2020 submissions include:  Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church v. Pritzker, Case No. 20-\n1811, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 18862 (7th Cir. June 16, 2020) (challenging 10-person gathering \nlimit); Spell v. Edwards, Case No. 20-30358, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 19148 (5th Cir June 18, 2020) \n(challenging 10-person limit on church services); High Plains Harvest Church v. Polis, Case No. \n20-cv-01480, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105247 (D. Colo. June 16, 2020) (finding that plaintiffs \nfailed to offer evidence into the record sufficient to show that the protests were comparable to the \nreligious services that plaintiffs wished to hold) ; McCarthy v. Cuomo, Case No. 20-cv-2124, 2020 \nU.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  107195  (E.D.N.Y.  June  18,  2020)  (EOs  are  content  neutral  and  satisfy \nintermediate scrutiny). \n10.  As discussed in the State defendants’ June 15, 2020 submissions, Dkt. Nos. 17, 18, \n20, and those submitted herewith, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claims as to the indoor gathering limits applicable to the plaintiffs, \nand therefore any preliminary injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs enjoining the enforcement \nof the indoor limitations should be denied.   \n11.  Similarly, for the reasons discussed above, and in the State defendants’ June 15, \n2020 submissions incorporated herein, Dkt. Nos. 17, 18, 20, plaintiffs’ application for temporary \npreliminary injunctive relief as to the applicable outdoor gathering limits should also be denied in \nits entirety.   \nWHEREFORE, for the reasons discussed in the June 15, 2020 submissions of the State \ndefendants, and those discussed in the documents submitted herewith, the State defendants \nrespectfully request that the court issue an order denying plaintiffs’ application for temporary \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 33   Filed 06/22/20   Page 4 of 4\npreliminary injunctive relief in its entirety. \n \nDated: June 22, 2020 \nWynantskill, New York                       s/ Adrienne J.

Defendant Mayor Bill de Blasio is Mayor of the City of New York and is the \nfinal decision-maker in New York City concerning enforcement of the challenged executive \norders, including the gathering limits.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This action raises federal questions under the First and Fourteenth Amendments \nof  the  United  States  Constitution  and  under  federal  law,  28  U.S.C.  §§  2201  and  2202 \n(Declaratory Judgments), as well as 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988, and 1920.  \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction over these federal claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343.  \n13.  This Court has authority to grant the requested injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. § \n1343(3), the requested declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and plaintiffs’ \nprayer for costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § \n1920.  \n14.  Venue is proper in the Northern District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as at least \none defendant resides in this District and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims \nherein arose in this District, where two of the plaintiffs reside. \nINTRODUCTION \n“It is incumbent on the courts to ensure decisions are made according to the rule of law, \nnot  hysteria….  One  hopes  that  this  great  principle—essential  to  any  free  society, \nincluding ours—will not itself become yet another casualty of COVID-19.” \n \n David F. Viviano, Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Michigan in Department of Health v. \nManke, 2020 WL 3033312, --- N.W. 2d--- (concurring opinion).  \n \n \n15.  In an unprecedented abuse of power, defendants have exploited the COVID-19 \npandemic to create, over the past three months, a veritable dictatorship by means of a complex \nweb of defendant Cuomo’s executive orders, by which defendants have imposed and selectively \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 4 of 53\nenforced “social distancing” under a “lockdown” of virtually every aspect of the social, political, \nreligious and economic life of New York’s 8.3 million residents on the pretext of “public \nhealth,” but with numerous exceptions defendants deem permissible according to their value \njudgments, including mass demonstrations of thousands of people of which they approve. \n16.  Defendants Cuomo, James and de Blasio have enforced Cuomo’s “lockdown” by \nthreat of criminal prosecution and actual prosecution, including $1000.00 fines for the newly \ncreated offense of violating Cuomo’s “Social Distancing Protocol” (SDP). \n17.  As  alleged  more  particularly  below,  Cuomo’s  constantly  morphing  official \nGuidance Document for the interpretation and application of his executive orders and the SDP \nhave specifically forbidden “congregate services within houses of worship” and “congregations \nof groups for religious service or ceremony,” thus singling out the free exercise of religion for \nstrict regulation under the SDP. \n18.  This explicit ban on “congregate worship” was followed by a strict ban on “non-\nessential gatherings” of more than ten people that still applies in New York City and other \nregions not in “Phase Two” of defendant Cuomo’s elaborate, arbitrary and pseudo-scientific \n“NY Forward” Plan (NYFP) for “reopening New York and building back better.”1/   \n19.  The  ten-person  limit  on  “non-essential”  gatherings  has  reduced  the  religious \nservices that plaintiffs conduct or participate in to miniscule congregations, as more particularly \nalleged below. \n20.  On or about June 5, however, defendant Cuomo announced that he had “relaxed” \nhis SDP to “allow” religious gatherings at 25% of the capacity of houses of worship, thereby \nspecifically regulating religion—and only religion—once again.  This “relaxation” applies only \n \n1/https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NYForwardReopeningGui\nde.pdf. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 5 of 53\nwhere “Phase Two” of NYFP is underway: the Finger Lakes, Central New York, Mohawk \nValley, Southern Tier, and the North Country of New York, where plaintiffs Soos and Stamos \npreside over their Catholic congregations.  The ten-person limit on “non-essential gatherings” in \nthe outdoors apparently still operates in this region \n21.  Outside  of  “Phase  Two”  regions,  the  ten-person  limit  on  “non-essential \ngatherings,” both indoors and outdoors, remains in effect, including New York City, where \n“Phase One” began only on June 8 and “Phase Two” has no specific start date in the foreseeable \nfuture.  The ten-person limit thus continues to apply to the Orthodox Jewish religious gatherings \nin which plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld participate. \n22.  Yet, while defendants jointly impose this arbitrary, pseudo-scientific regime of \nstrict gathering limits for some groups and activities but not others, they are permitting closely \npacked gatherings of thousands to protest the wrongful death of George Floyd at the hands of a \npolice officer, which have been taking place in New York City and every other major city in \nNew York State day-after-day since Floyd’s death on May 25. \n23.  As more particularly alleged below, the ongoing mass gatherings in New York \nState have been approved by defendants Cuomo and de Blasio even though they blatantly violate \nthe challenged executive orders, the SDP and the NYFP, including the challenged gathering \nlimits, while de Blasio himself has personally joined and addressed at least one such gathering. \n24.   Defendants Cuomo and de Blasio (and governors and mayors in other states as \nwell)  have thus revealed that the SDP regime is not a neutral and generally applicable policy but \nrather a content-based regulation of First Amendment-protected activity, riddled with exceptions \nfor the activities, including mass protests, defendants deem permissible according to their value \njudgments of what is “essential.” \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 6 of 53\n25.  Favored businesses, entities and activities, as well as favored mass demonstrations \nsuch as those over the death of George Floyd, are totally exempt from the challenged gathering \nlimits, while defendants irrationally and capriciously continue to forbid religious ceremonies,  \nhigh-school graduations, children playing in the park, and other comparatively tiny gatherings on \nthe now patently specious grounds that they will cause death if allowed to occur.  \n26.  Moreover, the absence of any “spike” in COVID-19 cases following the George \nFloyd protests and other mass gatherings people have joined in defiance of “social distancing” \nregimes in New York and other states, including Spring Break in Florida and massive partying at \nthe Lake of the Ozarks, have shown that the “science” behind the “lockdown” was flawed at best \nand should no longer deter judicial intervention in defense of First Amendment liberty for all, not \njust the groups and activities defendants favor.  \n27.  It is time to end New York’s experiment in absolute monarchy. Plaintiffs seek \nimmediate judicial relief from the gathering limits in the challenged executive orders by way of a \ntemporary  restraining  order,  followed  by  a  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  and  a \ndeclaratory judgment that the challenged executive orders are unconstitutional and void, both \nfacially and as applied, because they deprive plaintiffs of the free exercise of religion, freedom of \nspeech, freedom of assembly and freedom of expressive association without a compelling state \ninterest or even a rational basis to justify those deprivations. \nALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS \nThe Challenged Executive Orders  \n \n28.  On March 7, 2020, defendant Cuomo issued Executive Order 202 (Order 202), \nwhich, in relevant part, declared a State Disaster Emergency for the State of New York based \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 7 of 53\nupon the fact that travel-related cases and community contact transmission of COVID-19 had \nbeen documented in the State. See Exhibit A, p. 1.  \n29.  Executive Order 202 (Order 202) was followed by a series of executive orders \n(Orders) purporting to regulate literally all social, political, religious and business activity in the \nState of New York.  The only authority cited for this massive exercise in overnight social \nengineering is Section 29-a of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, Direction Of State Agency \nAssistance in a Disaster Emergency, which makes no provision whatsoever for limiting or \nprohibiting social, political, religious and business activities of the general population. \n30.  All of the Orders are premised on Order 202’s original proclamation that “travel-\nrelated cases and community contact transmission of COVID-19 have been documented in New \nYork State and are expected to continue…” Id. \n31.  The scheme of Orders is being enforced by “All enforcement mechanisms by state \nor local governments [which] shall continue to be in full force and effect until June 13, 2020 \nunless later extended or amended by a future Executive Order,” under Section 12 of the Public \nHealth Law, and by $1000.00 fines for violation of the SDP set forth in Cuomo’s unilaterally \ndictated “New York on PAUSE” plan (“PAUSE” Plan), whose latest iteration, in pertinent part, \nis as follows: \n1.  Effective at 8PM on Sunday, March 22, all non-essential businesses statewide \nwill be closed; \n2.  Non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reason (e.g. parties, \ncelebrations or other social events) are canceled or postponed at this time; \n3.  Any concentration of individuals outside their home must be limited to workers \nproviding essential services and social distancing should be practiced; \n4.  When in public individuals must practice social distancing of at least six feet from \nothers; \n5.  Businesses and entities that provide other essential services must implement rules \nthat help facilitate social distancing of at least six feet; \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 8 of 53\n6.  Individuals should limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact and avoid \nactivities where they come in close contact with other people; \n7.  Individuals should limit use of public transportation to when absolutely necessary \nand should limit potential exposure by spacing out at least six feet from other \nriders; \n8.  Sick individuals should not leave their home unless to receive medical care and \nonly after a telehealth visit to determine if leaving the home is in the best interest \nof their health; \n9.  Young  people  should  also  practice  social  distancing  and  avoid  contact  with \nvulnerable populations; and \n10. Use precautionary sanitizer practices such as using isopropyl alcohol wipes. \n \nThe maximum  fine  for  violations  of  the  state's  social  distancing  protocol \nis $1,000. \n \nSee Exhibit B (emphasis added). \n32.  The  “PAUSE  Plan”  provides  a  web-based  form  for  turning  in  one’s  fellow \ncitizens to defendant Cuomo’s office for enforcement action based on violations of the SDP, \nincluding  forbidden  “non-essential  gatherings,”  as  to  which  the  form  requests  “Estimated \nNumber of Individuals Observed at Location.”  See Exhibit C. \n33.  Defendant de Blasio has invoked the laws and law enforcement authorities of the \nCity of New York to enforce all of defendant Cuomo’s decrees, so providing in his Executive \nOrders denominated EO 98, EO-103 and EO 113-116. \n34.  On March 12, defendant Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.1, cancelling or \npostponing any “gathering” over 500 individuals. Exhibit A, p. 4. \n35.  On  March  16,  the  ban  on  “gatherings”  was  tightened  to  50  persons  under \nCuomo’s Executive Order 202.3. See Exhibit A, p. 4. \n36.  On March 18, under Executive Order 202.6, defendant Cuomo decreed that all \nbusinesses and non-profits in the State must reduce their workforces by 50% except for a vast \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 9 of 53\narray of favored businesses and entities Cuomo providing “services or functions” Cuomo deems \n“essential” as follows: \nAny essential business or entity providing essential services or functions shall not \nbe  subject  to  the  in-person  restrictions.  This  includes  essential  health  care \noperations  including  research  and  laboratory  services;  essential  infrastructure \nincluding utilities, telecommunication, airports and transportation infrastructure; \nessential manufacturing, including food processing and pharmaceuticals; essential \nretail including grocery stores and pharmacies; essential services including trash \ncollection, mail, and shipping services; news media; banks and related financial \ninstitutions;  providers  of  basic  necessities  to  economically  disadvantaged \npopulations; construction; vendors of essential services necessary to maintain the \nsafety,  sanitation  and  essential  operations  of  residences  or  other  essential \nbusinesses; vendors that provide essential services or products, including logistics \nand technology support, child care and services needed to ensure the continuing \noperation of government agencies and provide for the health, safety and welfare \nof the public… \n \nSee Exhibit A, p. 17. \n37.  On March 20, under Executive Order 202.8, defendant Cuomo ordered a 100% \nreduction in the workforces of “non-essential” businesses and non-profits—that is, their total \nclosure—with violations to be punished under Section 12 of the Public Health Law. See Exhibit \nA, p. 21. \n38.  On March 23, in Executive Order 202.10, Cuomo decreed a total ban on “non-\nessential gatherings of any size for any reason.”  See Exhibit A, p. 25. \n39.  The total ban on “non-essential gatherings” was pursuant to Cuomo’s updated \n“PAUSE” Plan, noted above. \n40.  On May 14, in Order 202.31, defendant Cuomo decreed that he was continuing \nuntil May 28, 2020 the closure of the aforesaid “non-essential” businesses and entities and the \naforesaid “postponement or cancellation of all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size \nfor any reason (e.g. parties, celebrations, games, meetings or other social events), which together \nconstitute New York On PAUSE.” See Exhibit A, p. 69. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 10 of 53\n41.  Order 202.31 further decrees that “All enforcement mechanisms by state or local \ngovernments shall continue to be in full force and effect until June 13, 2020 unless later extended \nor amended by a future Executive Order.” Order 202.31 thus maintains all local law enforcement \nagencies as agents for the enforcement of defendant Cuomo’s Orders, including the SDP and its \ngathering limits, with $1000.00 fines for violation.  \n42.  It was not until May 21, under Executive Order 202.32, that defendant Cuomo \ndecreed  that  the  previous  ban  on  all  “non-essential  gatherings”  under  Order  202.10  was \n“modified  to  permit  a  gathering  of  ten  or  fewer  individuals  for  any  religious  service  or \nceremony, or for the purposes of any Memorial Day service or commemoration, provided that \nsocial distancing protocols and cleaning and disinfection protocols required by the Department of \nHealth are adhered to…” See, Exhibit A, p. 71. \n43.  Order 202.32, further specifically targeting religious services, also provides that \n“any drive-in or remote religious service may continue in excess of the ten person limit so long \nas there is no in-person contact between participants.”  Exhibit A, p. 71. \n44.  On May 22, under Executive Order 202.33, defendant Cuomo granted general \n“permission” for “any non-essential gathering of ten or fewer individuals, for any lawful purpose \nor reason, provided that social distancing protocols and cleaning and disinfection protocols \nrequired by the Department of Health are adhered to.”  See, Exhibit A, p. 74 (emphasis added). \n45.  On  May  28,  under  Order  202.34,  defendant  Cuomo  continued  the  “required \npostponement, cancellation, or restriction on size of all non-essential gatherings of more than ten \nindividuals” but allowed the “Phase One reopening” for “non-essential businesses” in numerous \ncounties and in the North Country, where plaintiffs Soos and Stamos engage in their priestly \nministry. See Exhibit A, p. 75. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 11 of 53\n46.  On May 29, under Executive Order 202.35, the “PAUSE” Plan was yet again \nmodified to end workplace reductions and restrictions for “non-essential businesses”  in the \nFinger Lakes, Central New York, Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier and the North Country regions \nengaged  in  “Professional  Services,  Administrative  Support,  Information  Technology,    Real \nEstate services, Building and Property Management, Leasing, Rental, and Sales Services, Retail \nIn-store Shopping, Rental, Repair, and Cleaning, Barbershops and Hair Salon (limited services), \nand  Motor Vehicle Leasing, Rental, and Sales.” Said businesses need only follow “the guidance \npromulgated by the Department of Health”—i.e., social distancing of six feet and sanitization of \nthe premises.  See, Exhibit A, p. 77. \n47.  While  plaintiff  Soos’  and  plaintiff  Stamos’  ministry  is  conducted  in  North \nCountry towns, still no allowance was made for gatherings of more than ten persons for religious \nservices or other non-business purposes, not even with “social distancing,” and all of plaintiffs’ \nchurches still remained under the ten-person limit for “non-essential gatherings” as of May 29. \n48.  On June 2, under Order 202.36, defendant Cuomo decreed: “Any region that \nmeets the prescribed public health and safety metrics as determined by the Department of Health \nfor Phase One reopening may allow outdoor, low-risk recreational activities and businesses \nproviding  such  activities,  as  determined  by  Empire  State  Development  Corporation,  to  be \npermitted to operate, in accordance with Department of Health guidance.” See Exhibit A, p. 79. \n49.  Order 202.36, issued nearly 90 days after defendant Cuomo invoked his alleged \nauthority under Executive Order 202, still fails to allow “non-essential gatherings” of more than \nten persons or anything other than “drive-ins” for religious services. At the same time, however, \nit permits unlimited in-person gatherings for all of the following businesses and activities: \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 12 of 53\nStatewide: \n•  research and laboratory services;  \n•  essential infrastructure including utilities, telecommunication, airports and transportation \ninfrastructure;  \n•  essential manufacturing, including food processing and pharmaceuticals;  \n•  essential retail including grocery stores and pharmacies;  \n•  essential services including trash collection, mail, and shipping services;  \n•  news media; banks and related financial institutions;  \n•  providers of basic necessities to economically disadvantaged populations;  \n•  construction;  \n•  vendors of essential services necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation and essential \noperations of residences or other essential businesses;  \n•  vendors that provide essential services or products, including logistics and technology \nsupport; child care; \n•  services needed to ensure the continuing operation of government agencies and provide \nfor the health, safety and welfare of the public; \n•  state beaches. \nIn the North Country and other selected “Phase Two” counties: \n•  Professional Services, Administrative Support, Information Technology, \n \n•  Real estate services, Building and Property Management, Leasing, Rental, and Sales \nServices, \n \n•  Retail In-store Shopping, Rental, Repair, and Cleaning, \n \n•  Barbershops and Hair Salon (limited services) \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 13 of 53\n•  Motor Vehicle Leasing, Rental, and Sales; \n•  low-risk recreational activities and businesses providing such activities. \nDefendant Cuomo’s “Guidance” Document Targets Religion \n50.  In addition to his executive orders, the SDP and the NYFP, defendant Cuomo has \ncaused to be published a document entitled “Guidance for Determining Whether a Business \nEnterprise Is Subject to a Workforce Reduction Under Recent Executive Orders”. \n51.  The Guidance Document, which has changed over time in sync with defendant’s \nexecutive orders,2/ including the tightening limit on “non-essential gatherings,” has repeatedly \ntargeted religious exercise for strict regulation as follows: \n(a) From March 20-24, the Guidance Document declared that while “[h]ouses of \nworship  are  not  ordered  closed…  it  is  strongly  recommended  no  congregate \nservices be held and social distance maintained,” and “worship services” are \nspecifically enumerated among the “businesses” that “must remain closed and are \nnot  eligible  for  designation  as  an  essential  business  for  purposes  of  this \nguidance.” This “guidance” appears to be self-contradictory. See Exhibit D. \n(b) From March 25 to April 6 the Guidance Document tightened its regulation of \nreligion by adding the requirement that “social distance must be maintained and \ncompliance with DOH guidance” while reiterating that “worship services… are \nnot eligible for designation as an essential business for purposes of this guidance.” \nSee Exhibit E. \n \n(c) From  April  7  to  April  9  the  Guidance  Document  continued  to  list  “worship \nservices” as among the “businesses” that “must remain closed and are not eligible \nfor  designation  as  an  essential  business  for  purposes  of  this  guidance.”   See \nExhibit F. \n \n52.  From April 10 to May 20 the targeting of religion by the Guidance Document was \nexplicit and exclusive, extending even to religious gatherings in homes and other locations \noutside of houses of worship: \n \n2/See  https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026.  All  iterations  of  the  Guidance \nDocument  provided  as  exhibits  to  this  Verified  Complaint  were  obtained  from  the \nWayBackMachine Internet Archive at https://archive.org/web/. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 14 of 53\nPursuant to Executive Order 202.10, all non-essential gatherings of individuals of \nany size for any reasons (e.g. worship services, parties, celebrations, or other \nsocial events) are canceled or postponed. Congregate services within houses of \nworship are prohibited.  Houses of worship may only be used by individuals and \nonly where appropriate social distancing of, at least, six feet between people can \nbe maintained. Further, individuals should not gather in houses of worship, \nhomes, or other locations for religious services until the end of this public health \nemergency. If possible, religious leaders should consider alternative forms of \nworship, replacing in-person gatherings with virtual services, such as phone or \nconference calls, videoconference calls, or online streaming.  \n \nSee Exhibit G. \n \n53.  On April 28, by way of enforcing Cuomo’s gathering limits as explained in the \nGuidance Document then in effect, defendant de Blasio personally appeared in Williamsburg to \nensure that a Jewish funeral gathering was broken up by the NYPD.  As he declared via his \nTwitter account: \nSomething  absolutely  unacceptable  happened  in  Williamsburg  tonite:  a  large \nfuneral gathering in the middle of this pandemic. When I heard, I went there \nmyself  to  ensure  the  crowd  was  dispersed.  And  what  I  saw  WILL  NOT  be \ntolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus \n \nSee Exhibit H (emphasis added) \n \n54.  On April 28, defendant de Blasio tweeted the following warning to the Jewish \ncommunity:  \nMy message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the \ntime for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately \nto summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about \nstopping this disease and saving lives. Period. \n \nSee Exhibit I (emphasis added) \n \n55.  From  May  21  to  June  5,  the  Guidance  Document,  now  reflecting  Cuomo’s \npermission for “non-essential gatherings” of ten-or-fewer people and “drive-in” gatherings at \nwhich people remain in their vehicles the entire time, continued to target religion by specifically \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 15 of 53\nregulating the conduct of religious services and specifically mentioning religious congregations \nas subject to the ten-person limit: \nHowever, Executive Order 202.32 allows ten or fewer people to gather for a \nreligious  service  or  ceremony,  provided  that  social  distancing  protocols  and \ncleaning and disinfection protocols required by the Department of Health are \nadhered to, and provided further, that any drive-in or remote religious service \nmay continue in excess of the ten person limit so long as there is no in-person \ncontact between participants. Faith leaders should continue to consider and use \nalternative forms of worship, replacing in-person gatherings with virtual services, \nsuch as phone or conference calls, videoconference calls, or online streaming, \nwherever  possible,  and  congregations  of  groups  for  religious  service  or \nceremony in excess of ten in-person participants remain prohibited.   \n \nExhibit J (pertinent portion highlighted) \n \n56.  On June 6, defendant Cuomo, in Executive Order 202.38, declared that he will \nnow permit “non-essential gatherings for houses of worship at no greater than 25% of the indoor \ncapacity of such location, provided it is in a geographic area in Phase 2 of re-opening, and \nfurther provided that social distancing protocols and cleaning and disinfection protocols required \nby the Department of Health are adhered to.” Exhibit A, p. 82. \n57.  The ten-person limit on “non-essential” indoor gatherings remains in effect in \nNew York City and all other regions not in Cuomo’s “Phase 2,” while the same ten-person limit \nappears to remain in effect outdoors throughout the entire State, even though none of the favored \nbusinesses and entities enumerated above are subject to any gathering limits at all. \n58.  In explaining his “permission” for only 25% occupancy of houses of worship, \nCuomo stated: \nWe are going to accelerate the opening of temples, mosques, churches, In Phase 2 \nthey can open up to 25 percent occupancy in that building…. \n \nYes, 25% occupancy is not as easy as 100% occupancy, but 100% occupancy is a \nmass gathering and you really can’t do social distancing, etc. So Phase 2, 25% \noccupancy. That begins immediately. Be smart. Be smart. It doesn’t mean you go \nto a temple or a mosque and you sit right next to a person.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 16 of 53\n \nYou have to socially distance. Watch on the entranceway, when people tend to \ncongregate, going through the entrance or the exit. So, we leave it to our faith-\nbased partners to come up with a smart strategy about how to do this, but this is \nan acceleration for us because we’re doing so well on the metrics, but people still \nhave to stay smart. \n \nSee Exhibit K (official transcript; highlighted).  \n \n59.  Yet, as pleaded below, both defendant Cuomo and defendant de Blasio approve of \ntotally unrestricted mass gatherings of protestors numbering in the thousands, as well as indoor \ngatherings of protestors in theaters that are supposed to remain closed under Cuomo’s executive \norders, so long as the protests and protestors meet with their approval. \nDefendants Cuomo and de Blasio Exempt Favored  \nProtestors From their “Social Distancing” Regime   \n \n60.  The term “non-essential gatherings” has never been defined by defendants or their \nagents.  The vagueness of the term allows for arbitrary and capricious application. \n61.  Accordingly,  while  the  challenged  gathering  limits  continue  to  be  enforced \nagainst religious congregations and other “gatherings” defendants deem “non-essential,” over the \npast few days packed gatherings of hundreds or thousands, assembled in protest over the death of \nGeorge Floyd at the hands of a police officer, have been allowed to demonstrate, march and even \nriot in the streets of all the major cities in New York State without any enforcement of the ten-\nperson limit or the rest of Cuomo’s SDP.  \n62.  For  example,  this  mass  protest  occurred  in  Albany  without  opposition  from \ndefendant Cuomo: \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 17 of 53\n \n \nSee Exhibit L (with photo). \n \n63.   On  the  contrary,  during  his  press  briefing  of  June  1,  defendant  Cuomo \ncondemned violence at these demonstrations but otherwise approved of them even though they \nblatantly violate his ten-person limit on “non-essential gatherings”: \nAndrew Cuomo: And we have to be smart in this moment. The violence in these \nprotests obscures the righteousness of the message…. \n \nSpeaker 2: Would you suggest people not go out and protest? \nAndrew  Cuomo:  No,  I  think  you  can  protest,  but  do  it  smartly  and \nintelligently and many places have. You look at places around the country. \nThere were protests all across the country. Protest. Just be smart about it. \nWith this virus, you can do many things now as long as you’re smart about it, \nright? You can reopen, you can go into a store and you can do a lot of things, \njust be smart. (emphasis added) 3/.  \nSee Exhibit M (transcript; highlighted). \n \n3/  See  video  of  June  1  briefing  at    https://youtu.be/7VssYZp_2Ho?t=1104  and  \nhttps://youtu.be/7VssYZp_2Ho?t=2615 \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 18 of 53\nSpeaker 3: So, what’s the difference between protesting and a business, say, in \nthe city who wants to reopen smartly if it’s not at the phase yet that they're \ntechnically allowed to? \nAndrew Cuomo: Well, that’s where we’re at, but it has to be a business where \nyou can be smart. Be smart, meaning socially distant. You don’t conduct business \nin a way where you have people within [sic] six feet. You have to wear the mask. \nYou have to do the hand sanitizer. That’s where we’re going to be.4/ \nId. \n64.  Cuomo  has  not  imposed  on  thousands  of  George  Floyd  demonstrators  any \nrequirement that they “socially distance,” wear masks (although most of them do in a ritual \nmanner) or use hand sanitizer. Nor has he imposed any limit on the size of their gatherings, even \nthough violence and massive property damage have occurred during these gatherings in New \nYork and elsewhere. \n65.  During his press briefing of June 4, Cuomo, while displaying a slide approvingly \nnoting mass protests in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany and New York City, declared: “I \nwant to thank the protestors, who were mainly peaceful, which was smart because they could \nmake their point… I stand with the protestors on the point that we need meaningful reform.”5/ \n(emphasis added). See Exhibit N (transcript). \n66.  Confronted at the same press briefing with a question from a reporter about a \nPakistani family seeking Cuomo’s permission for an in-person graduation ceremony “with social \ndistancing,” rather than the “drive-in” ceremony he will allow, Cuomo replied contemptuously: \nI mean, did you hear anything that we’ve been talking about for the past 96 days?  \nLook, I don’t want to be difficult.  It’s a Pakistani immigrant family that wants to \nhave a graduation. I get it. It’s not really relevant that they’re from Pakistan….  \n \n \n4/ See https://youtu.be/7VssYZp_2Ho?t=2646 at 45:20. \n \n5/ See https://youtu.be/hijWxWO1oc4?t=166 at 2:46. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 19 of 53\nThat’s not the issue. The issue is a public health issue. You don’t want people sick \nand dead. That’s the issue, right? It’s about death. It’s about balancing the risk \nversus the reward; balancing the desires and wants versus the consequences. \nRight?  \n \nWe went through New Rochelle, Westchester. People went to a ceremony. They \nwere having celebration and a religious ceremony… Yeah, people died. People \ndied, right? So, yeah I know, everybody wants to go to a high school graduation. I \nget it. Not if they’re gonna die. Right?6/ (emphasis added) \n \n67.   It  is  apparent  that  defendant  Cuomo  has  arrogated  to  himself  the  power  to \ndetermine which gatherings among 8 million New Yorkers are “essential”—demonstrations over \npolice  brutality  being  one  example—and  which  are  “non-essential,”  including  high  school \ngraduations and religious ceremonies, according to their subjective judgment of “risk versus \nreward.”  Cuomo’s claim that a high school graduation ceremony will kill people, while mass \nmarches and demonstrations will not, is patently disingenuous. \n68.  Defendant de Blasio has likewise allowed Floyd protests without adherence to the \nten-person limit, as seen in a demonstration near the Manhattan Bridge. 7/ See Exhibit O (photo): \n \n \n \n6/ See https://youtu.be/hijWxWO1oc4?t=2112  at 35:12. \n \n7/See  image  of  gathering  on  roadway  to  Manhattan  Bridge  taken  Sunday,  May  31,  2020: \nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/Yl9dB6EItdTHlKMXU9BcnBdoAAU=/800x533/top/clou\ndfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UZ4VLUWR2JHK5EHYDY4BE2VOSA.JPG \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 20 of 53\n69.  Another Floyd demonstration involved thousands who crowded the entire span of \nthe Brooklyn Bridge as seen here.8/ \n70.  Expressing solidarity with defendant Cuomo, during his press briefing of June 2, \ndefendant de Blasio rambled on about the supposed critical difference between the Floyd protests \non the one hand and disfavored “non-essential gatherings” on the other, offering only a vague \nassurance that someday religious services would no longer be restricted as “non-essential”:  \nQuestion: While you’ve recommended that protestors stay home, for others in \nthe city, you’ve enforced gathering bans, not recommendations. \n \nThe retail store owner who has been closed for two months and is experiencing \nfinancial ruin has been banned from opening his store. People for whom attending \nhouses of worship are a regular part of life been have banned from doing so with \nmore than 10 people. \n \nNow, you’ve expressed solidarity with this particular protest cause. Is that why \nit’s been given dispensation to disregard all pandemic guidelines? \n \nI know you were asked about this yesterday. And you said there’s such pain and \nanger, and [banning protests may be construed as] not hearing their concerns. \nWhat about the retail store owner facing imminent financial ruin, or the religious \nperson who can’t attend a house of worship – what about their pain and anger?  \n \nSo, Mr. Mayor are we in a pandemic or not? And do we have one set of rules for \nprotestors and another for everyone else? \n \nThank you.  \n \nAnswer: …. We’re in the middle of a national crisis, a deep-seated national \ncrisis [over Floyd’s death]….

Didn’t happen by accident….  \n \nSo you could say, Oh, couldn’t we have done stores, and I appreciate how painful \nit’s been for people to be missing religious observance, but I’ll tell you the \nreligious leaders of this city have stood as one and said we are not going to do \nthings prematurely, that will endanger lives…. \n \n \n8/ See video at https://youtu.be/q5UPlVlTEdM?t=149  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 21 of 53\nBut this is other piece of the equation: When you see a nation, an entire nation, \nsimultaneously grappling with an extraordinary crisis seeded in 400 years of \nAmerican racism, I’m sorry, that is not the same question as the understandably \naggrieved store owner or the devout religious person who wants to go back to \nservices…. \nThe religious services come back, that does not have to be far away, if we do the \nwork together.

On June 4, de Blasio, who in late April had threatened the Jewish community with \narrests and prosecutions for “illegal” mass religious gatherings and personally appeared on scene \nto ensure the NYPD’s dispersal of a Jewish funeral, attended and addressed a mass political \ngathering at Cadman Plaza in memory of George Floyd where neither the ten-person limit nor \nthe social distancing he and Cuomo prescribe for “non-essential gatherings” were in the least \nobserved.10/ He was not wearing the mask he requires of others:11/ \n  \n \n9/Reuvain Borchardt, “De Blasio: Only Protest Gatherings OK, Due to ‘400 Years of American \nRacism’,”  June  2,  2020,  https://hamodia.com/2020/06/02/de-blasio-allowing-protestors-defy-\nsocial-distancing-due-angst-400-years-american-racism/.

Days later, in Williamsburg, a small group of Hasidic children was kicked out of a \npark by a police officer enforcing Cuomo’s and de Blasio’s ten-person limit on “non-essential \ngatherings.” See, Exhibit R (photo). 12/ \n73.  At the same time, without objection by de Blasio or Cuomo, theaters in New York \nthat are supposed to be closed until “Phase Four” of Cuomo’s reopening plan have opened their \npremises to George Floyd demonstrators for rest, use of Wi-Fi and bathrooms, and provision of \nwater and snacks—with instructions to keep police out of the premises. See Exhibit S. \n74.  The  special  rules  applied  in  these  contexts,  with  the  evident  approval  of  \ndefendants Cuomo and de Blasio, are:  (1) Gathering limits and social distancing for thee, but not \nfor me; and (2) Gathering limits and social distancing for thee, but not for we, who are engaged \nin a cause more important than worship services. \n75.  In sum, defendant Cuomo’s restrictions on “non-essential gatherings,” enforced \nby $1000 fines and other criminal penalties imposed by local law enforcement at defendants’ \ncommand, now stand exposed as a sham—dispensable for some but not others at defendants’ \nwhim, rather than a neutral law of general application rationally related to public health and \nsafety.   \n76.  As the pandemic rapidly wanes, defendants’ “social distancing” dictatorship, put \nto a test of neutrality and general application, instantly revealed itself as an exercise in social \ncontrol for its own sake, applied selectively according to defendants’ value judgments rather than \n“science” or “metrics.” \n \n12/”AGAIN IN WILLIAMSBURG: Hasidic Children Kicked Out of Park Days After Tens of \nThousands  Attend  Protest,”  The  Yeshiva  World,  June  8,  2020;  see: \nhttps://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/featured/1869301/again-in-williamsburg-hasidic-\nchildren-kicked-out-of-park-days-after-tens-of-thousands-attend-protest.html  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 23 of 53\nTHE INFRINGEMENT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \n CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS \n \nPlaintiffs Soos and Stamos \n \n77.  Plaintiff Rev. Steven Soos is a duly ordained Catholic priest, ordained in 1994, \nwho offers Mass and provides the other Sacraments of the Catholic Church to congregations \nlocated Glens Falls, Massena and Nicholville, all located in this District.    \n78.  Plaintiff  Soos  belongs  to  an  international  fraternity  of  Catholic  priests  with \nseminaries and Mass centers throughout the world that is not affiliated with any particular \ndiocese. \n79.  Rev. Nicholas Stamos, a Catholic priest ordained in 2016, belongs to the same \npriestly fraternity and assists Father Soos in saying Mass at said locations, along with another \npriest. \n80.  The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is the very heart of Catholic worship without \nwhich the Catholic faith would not exist. \n81.  In addition to offering Mass, both plaintiff Soos and plaintiff Stamos perform \nbaptisms, preside at weddings, and offer funeral Masses for their flocks.  \n82.  In  Massena,  where  the  chapel  has  a  capacity  of  350  persons,  the  Catholic \ncongregation is generally 40 worshipers on a Sunday at the present time, including 18 nuns, but \nwould expand to around 170 when students return to the Catholic school at that location.  \n83.  In Glens Falls the congregation is about 80 in number in a chapel whose capacity \nis 80 persons.  \n84.  In  Nicholville,  at  Saint  Therese  Church,  which  is  the  main  church  to  which \nplaintiffs  Soos  and  Stamos  minister,  the  Sunday  congregation  numbers  approximately  260 \nworshipers, divided between two Sunday Masses in a church that has a capacity of 204. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 24 of 53\n85.  On June 6, in Executive Order 202.38, defendant Cuomo’s previous ten-person \nlimit on worship gatherings, or else “drive-in” services, was “expanded” in the “Phase Two” \nregion, where plaintiffs Soos and Stamos conduct their priestly ministry, to “allow” worship \nservices at 25% of building capacity—a limitation not imposed on numerous businesses and \nentities under the challenged Orders. \n86.  This limitation continues severely and without justification to burden plaintiffs’ \nexercise of religion as follows: \n87.  Forbidding Catholics to be physically present for worship beyond an arbitrary, \nstate-imposed  strict  numerical  limit  on  the  size  of  congregations,  75%  below  the  normal \noccupancy of their churches or chapels, is a serious deprivation of their exercise of the Catholic \nreligion and a grave interference in plaintiffs’ religious ministry and priestly mission to their \nflocks.  \n88.  It  is  a  Catholic  teaching  that  one  cannot  receive  Sacraments  without  being \nphysically present for their administration. Sacraments cannot provide their graces by “remote” \nvideo link as defendant Cuomo also “allows” under his dictate in Order 202.32. \n89.  Under  defendant  Cuomo’s  new  “25%  of  capacity”  decree  in  Order  202.38, \nplaintiffs would have to offer multiple Masses on the same day in Saint Therese Church at \nNicholville, where the total congregation for both Sunday Masses numbers 260 and building \ncapacity is 204.  \n90.  For a High Mass, the Church norms provide for five altar servers to assist the \npriest, which would reduce the congregation at Saint Therese Church to around 45 members at \neach Mass, given the 25% of capacity limitation imposed by defendant Cuomo. This would \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 25 of 53\nrequire the offering of five Sunday Masses at Saint Therese Church in order to accommodate 260 \nworshipers. \n91.  For a Low Mass, Church norms provide for two altar servers to assist the priest, \nwhich would reduce the congregation at Saint Therese Church to around 47 at each Mass, given \nthe  25%  capacity  limitation.    This  limitation  would  likewise  require  five  Low  Masses  to \naccommodate 260 worshipers. \n92.  Sunday is a Holy Day of Obligation in the Catholic Church on which all Catholics \nare obliged under pain of mortal sin to attend Mass unless they are ill, or some other grave \nreason prevents attendance. But it is physically impossible for one priest to offer that many \nMasses on a Sunday or any other day. Moreover, Church law precludes offering more than two \nMasses  on  a  given  day  (“bination”)  except  under  extraordinary  circumstances,  when  three \nMasses may be offered by the same priest on the same day. \n93.  Consequently,  on  Sunday,  June  7,  plaintiffs  Soos  and  Stamos,  dividing  the \nMasses between them with another priest, were forced to offer five Masses at Saint Therese \nChurch—6 a.m., 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 12:30—instead of the normal two Masses under \nnormal occupancy in order to accommodate their total flock of around 260 persons. \n94.  At Glens Falls, where the chapel holds only 80 persons, this past Sunday, June 7, \nplaintiff Stamos was forced to offer three “drive-in” Masses rather than the four in-person \nMasses that would have been needed if the chapel were used under defendant Cuomo’s arbitrary \n25% capacity rule.  \n95.  At Massena, where the chapel holds 350, the 25% capacity rule will not permit a \nsingle daily Mass for 120-130 students when they return to school, which will severely disrupt \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 26 of 53\nthe school’s schedule come September—assuming defendant Cuomo even permits plaintiffs’ \nCatholic school to reopen, failing which another First Amendment deprivation would arise. \n96.  Weddings in the churches over which plaintiffs Soos and Stamos preside would \nlikewise be impacted by the 25% capacity rule, as plaintiffs would be forced to prohibit family \nmembers and friends from attending what are usually large gatherings for the Sacrament of Holy \nMatrimony. \n97.  The “drive-in” Masses that defendant Cuomo has allowed since May 21 also \ninvolve  major  and  unjustified  burdens  on  plaintiffs  and  their  congregations,  including  the \nfollowing: \na.  Because  they  are  forbidden  by  defendant  Cuomo  from  leaving  their  cars \nduring a “drive-in” Mass, congregants are unable to kneel during the Canon of \nthe Mass for the Consecration of the elements of Holy Communion, bread and \nwine, which Catholics believe become the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of \nChrist at the moment of the Consecration such that kneeling in the divine \nPresence is commanded by their religion. \nb.  Many  of  the  congregants  who  have  attended  the  few  drive-in  Masses \nattempted at Nicholville and Glens Falls have to drive 1 to 2 hours each way.  \nSome are elderly people who find it difficult to remain in their cars during a \nMass that lasts an hour or longer after driving for an hour or more, followed \nby another drive of an hour or more to return home. Others arrive in vans or \nSUVs packed with large families who are required to be cooped up in their \nvehicles for the same amount of time \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 27 of 53\nc.  In order to administer Holy Communion to the “drive-in” congregants while \nkneeling, as required by the rubrics of the Masses plaintiffs offer, plaintiffs \nmust set up outdoor kneelers which the congregants, leaving their vehicles, \nmust approach two at a time rather than keeling in a row at the Communion \nrail as they would inside the church.  But even this is forbidden by Cuomo’s \n“drive-in”  restrictions,  which  prohibit  “in-person  contact  between \nparticipants” and thus prohibit reception of Holy Communion itself—the very \nessence of the Mass—except under threat of prosecution and fines. \nd.  The “drive-in” Masses on May 31 were held in 40-degree weather, with snow \nsqualls and rain, to which the priest and the altar servers were exposed. \n98.  The aforesaid restrictions on Catholic worship under defendants’ social distancing \nregime impose extreme burdens on plaintiffs’ free exercise of religion in ministering to their \nflocks, which burdens are not imposed on the businesses, social activities (including beachgoing) \nand the mass demonstrations for George Floyd defendants have selectively permitted. \n99.  Furthermore, the original ten-person limit on outdoor gatherings, necessitating \n“drive-in” religious services for larger-than-ten gatherings outdoors, apparently remains in effect \neven in plaintiffs’ “Phase Two” region. \n100.  Thus,  although  in-person  outdoor  Masses  in  warm  weather,  with  full \ncongregations, would be feasible at Nicholville, which has six acres of open land in front of Saint \nTherese Church, defendant Cuomo’s ten-person limit on outdoor gatherings—not applicable to \nthe George Floyd demonstrations—still makes that impossible at Nicholville.  \n101.  The still-operative ten-person outdoor limit also burdens the practice of plaintiffs’ \nreligion respecting outdoor burial services, where plaintiffs—in an unjustified compromise of \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 28 of 53\ntheir  ministry  to  the  grieving—would  be  forced  to  bar  family  members  and  friends  from \nattending the graveside as their loved ones are laid to rest, while thousands of people march in \nthe streets with defendants’ approval, and even participation in the case of defendant de Blasio. \n102.  While all of the aforesaid restrictions should be entirely stricken down as arbitrary \nand unconstitutional, as pleaded below, plaintiffs Soos and Stamos would be willing to minister \nto their congregations following the same “social distancing” requirements applied to the “Phase \nTwo” businesses and entities now operating in the North Country and the same outdoor protocol \napplied to defendants’ favored political demonstrations, which are unlimited in size. \nPlaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld \n103.  Plaintiffs Schonbrun, Perr and Mayerfeld are sincere practitioners of Orthodox \nJudaism who attend synagogues in Brooklyn, where they all reside. \n104.  The synagogue prayers required by their religion must have a minimum quorum \nof ten adult males (age thirteen or older), called the minyan, and several of the congregants, a \nfew times a week, must gather closely around the Torah for a reading from the Torah. \n105.  Members of their congregations also gather to pray and study the Torah and the \nTalmud together, especially young men. \n106.  These religious activities require physical presence in the synagogue and cannot \nbe conducted by video.  \n107.  Limiting the size of synagogue congregations to ten persons or mandating that the \ncongregants attend “drive-in” services in closed motor vehicles, as provided in Orders 202.32 \nand 202.33, when numerous secular gatherings and the mass demonstrations now occurring are \nexempted from any such restrictions, unduly burdens plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs \nand practices, as follows: \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 29 of 53\n108.  If Jewish services are limited to the presence of a minyan of 10 adult men, then no \none else can attend the services under the ten-person limit.  Thus a young man could not attend \nhis own Bar Mitzvah, which is usually held the week before the thirteenth birthday (meaning the \nboy would not count toward the minyan), or a bride-to-be her own wedding, or a newborn his \nown circumcision, nor could plaintiffs themselves attend such services unless they were part of \nthe minyan. \n109.  Defendant Cuomo’s allowance of “drive-in” gatherings of more than ten persons \nalso fails to accommodate plaintiffs’ religion as the minyan must all be present in the same room, \nnot in various motor vehicles, so that a “drive-in” service would not be possible in Orthodox \nJewish worship.   \n110.  Moreover, any type of operation of a vehicle is prohibited on the Sabbath, which \nis the day the main weekly services take place. \n111.  While women attend services in plaintiffs’ synagogues, they are not counted \ntowards the minimum quorum of ten adult males, just as a woman cannot act as a priest in the \nCatholic religion.  \n112.  Thus, the challenged Orders forbid plaintiffs to participate in any congregation \nbeyond the minyan if they are not part of the minyan but merely a congregant. \n113.  Defendant Cuomo’s ten-person limit on religious gatherings has devastated the \nspiritual life of plaintiffs’ respective synagogue communities as it is now impossible for families \nto attend services or even for men alone to do so beyond the strict minimum of ten. \n114.  The  challenged  Orders  effectively  render  illegal  any  but  miniscule  Jewish \ncongregations, either indoors or outdoors, yet Kosher grocery stores and bakeries in Brooklyn,  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 30 of 53\nand numerous other businesses, are allowed to operate without any state-imposed limit on the \nnumber of persons inside. \n115.  At the same time, defendants de Blasio and Cuomo not only allow but approve \nmassive demonstrations of thousands of people in protest over the death of George Floyd, \nincluding demonstrations in the same Borough, Brooklyn, where religious gatherings of more \nthan ten, either indoors or outdoors, are deemed illegal under the challenged Orders and where \ndefendant de Blasio personally appeared in Williamsburg to be sure a Jewish funeral gathering \nwas dispersed by the NYPD.  \n116.  In addition, each plaintiff has been affected by the challenged Orders in particular \nways, as pleaded below. \nPlaintiff Daniel Schonbrun \n117.  Daniel Schonbrun has been a congregant of Chabad of Marine Park in Brooklyn \nsince 2009.  \n118.  By mid-March 2020, when most synagogues in Brooklyn had shut down, the \nRabbi of Chabad of Marine Park, Rabbi Hendel, decided to remain open with social distancing. \n119.  Plaintiff Schonbrun’s congregation was thereafter harassed by a member of the \nJewish community who holds himself out as a liaison with local authorities and an enforcer of \n“social distancing.”   \n120.  On the first Sabbath after Rabbi Hendel decided to keep his synagogue open, this \nindividual appeared and began yelling at the congregants to leave because they were supposedly \nputting the community in danger.  \n121.  Plaintiff  Schonbrun’s  congregation  thereafter  moved  its  thrice-daily  prayer \nservices outdoors to the 5,000 square foot backyard of the synagogue.  On April 4, before the full \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 31 of 53\nquorum for prayers could assemble, the same individual entered the backyard without permission \nand berated the eight congregants present, informing them that they were engaged in an “illegal \ngathering” and that they must disperse.   \n122.  When the congregants failed to disperse, this individual called 911. A police \nofficer arrived minutes later, entered the backyard and informed plaintiff Schonbrun and the \nother congregants present that they were an illegal gathering and must disperse, even though \nonly eight people were present and were at least 20 feet apart from each other. \n123.  When the congregants declined to disperse, the officer went to each of them, one \nby one, and threatened them with fines and arrest, thereby intimidating five of the congregants to \ndisperse, leaving only three, including plaintiff Schonbrun. \n124.  While plaintiff Schonbrun was remonstrating with the officer, four more police \nofficers appeared in the synagogue’s backyard, including a Sergeant from the 61st Precinct.  The \nofficers continued to maintain that the gathering was “illegal” and refused to deal with the \nindividual who had called them, who was trespassing. When plaintiff Schonbrun asked the police \nofficers why they were allowing him to be on private property, the officers claimed that he works \nfor the NYPD. \n125.  Plaintiff Schonbrun informed the officers that as of that date, April 4, no order by \ndefendant  Cuomo  or  defendant  de  Blasio  actually  prohibited  religious  gatherings  as  “non-\nessential.” The officers continued to insist that defendant de Blasio had made it illegal for “non-\nessential” religious groups to gather for worship and spent about ten minutes on their cell phones \ntrying to find the law or rule they were invoking  \n126.  By this time, only plaintiff Schonbrun and one other congregant were left, and \nthey decided to leave as there was no minyan or any way to continue praying as police had \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 32 of 53\ntotally disbanded the gathering.  The police remained on the scene until they were certain \nplaintiff Schonbrun and the other remaining congregant had left. \n127.  Six days later, on April 10, defendant Cuomo published the aforesaid “Guidance \nDocument,” stating that “all non-essential gatherings of individuals of any size for any reasons \n(e.g. worship services, parties, celebrations, or other social events) are canceled or postponed. \nCongregate services within houses of worship are prohibited.”  \n128.  By this time plaintiff Schonbrun’s minyan had to change locations constantly \nbecause they were afraid that police officers would arrive at any time to demand that they \ndisperse. Consequently, plaintiff Schonbrun and his fellow congregants missed many religious \nservices, including during Passover, which began on April 8 and ended on April 16. \n129.  Because of the ten-person limit, plaintiff Schonbrun’s son, who is not old enough \nto be part of a minyan, has not been able to attend synagogue for months, which is one way in \nwhich defendant Cuomo’s executive orders have destroyed the spiritual life of families in the \nJewish community. \n130.  Plaintiff Schonbrun now lives in constant fear of police intervention in what \nremains of Jewish worship under the ten-person limit, especially after defendant de Blasio’s \nwarning on April 29 that “My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this \nsimple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to \nsummons or even arrest those who gather in large groups….”  \n131.  Plaintiff Schonbrun has frequently observed that during all the weeks he and his \ncongregation have been harassed by the police for “illegal gatherings,” the “essential” stores \nwere all open with lines around the block as throngs of people were trying to get in. There was \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 33 of 53\nno limit on numbers in these gathering and no “social distancing,” nor any police intervention to \nrequire adherence to the challenged orders by people who were gathered to shop. \n132.  Chabad of Marine Park has a total indoor capacity of about 70 people, including \nwomen and children in a separate room. With social distancing of six feet between congregants, \nthe synagogue can hold about 30 people. \n133.  An outdoor service in the 5,000-square-foot backyard could accommodate some \n200 people, or approximately 70 people with social distancing. \nPlaintiff Elchanan Perr \n134.  Plaintiff Perr is a regular member of a Congregation in the Flatbush-Midwood \nsection of Brooklyn.  He has been a congregant there for the past three years. \n135.  At the very beginning of the “social distancing” regime reflected in defendant \nCuomo’s orders, even before “congregate worship” was prohibited outright between April 10 \nand May 20, police were advising members of the Jewish community in Flatbush-Midwood that \nsynagogues must close outright, and the police were actively seeking out rabbis to so inform \nthem. \n136.  Because of the general synagogue closings, plaintiff Perr began to attend another \nsynagogue, Congregation Zichron Aryeh Leib. \n137.  On many occasions from late March and throughout April, police cars would \narrive to surveil and intimidate the few remaining congregants at Congregation Zichron Aryeh \nLeib,  including  plaintiff  Perr,  many  other  congregants  having  been  scared  away  by  the \nGovernor’s orders and the constant police presence.    \n138.  On these occasions the police would try to gain entry and would bang on the \ndoors of the synagogue.  A few times they did gain entry to “check” on the worship proceedings.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 34 of 53\nOn one such occasion, in March, plaintiff Perr confronted two officers in front of the synagogue \nwho were trying to enter. They informed him that they had orders that all synagogues had to \nclose, even though—as plaintiff told the officers—as of that date “congregate worship” had not \nbeen forbidden, which would not happen till around April 10, as pleaded above. \n139.  The result of this constant police presence and interference was a climate of fear \nthat prevented the tranquility of worship among plaintiff and the remaining congregants, who \nwere constantly apprehensive about police intrusions into their synagogue. \n140.  A self-styled “community activist” who claims to be coordinating with the City \ngovernment, who periodically flashes a badge of some kind, has repeatedly summoned the police \nto houses of Jewish worship in the Flatbush-Midwood area to intimidate rabbis and congregants \ninto suspending their worship and even closing their synagogues. \n141.  For example, on March 26, at Congregation Sasregen in the same neighborhood, \nplaintiff Perr was present for prayers in the early morning when the police, summoned by the \naforesaid “community activist,” arrived and demanded that worship not proceed.  A week later \nplaintiff observed that this synagogue had been locked and that there was a notice on the door \nfrom the Health Department that the synagogue had been closed and that no services could be \nconducted there.  Exhibit T. \n142.  Also, on that date, the NYPD broke up a funeral gathering in honor of Rabbi \nCohn, in front of his home, in which plaintiff Perr participated, with social distancing of those in \nthe  gathering.  The  street  had  been  closed  with  permission  from  the  police,  who  decided, \nhowever, that the gathering should end and proceeded to disperse the gathering by driving into \nits midst with their cars, in the middle of a eulogy, forcing everyone onto the sidewalks, where \nthey could not socially distance. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 35 of 53\n143.  During the first week in April, plaintiff Perr was advised by a 311 operator that all \nsynagogues in Flatbush-Midwood were to be closed. \n144.  On April 10, as plaintiff Perr and another congregant were locking up after a \nsynagogue service during Passover at Congregation Zichron Aryeh Leib, four NYPD vehicles \npulled up in front of the synagogue, apparently in response to a complaint.  A group of officers \nexited  these  vehicles  and  two  of  them  confronted  plaintiff  Perr  and  a  fellow  congregant, \nthreatening them with arrest for “illegal” prayer services. Plaintiff was not arrested only because \nhe was already leaving and did not wish to argue with a platoon of armed police officers. \n145.  The remaining congregants at Congregation Zichron Aryeh Leib devised a text \nmessaging system to warn each other of impending police presence so they could scatter or wait \nuntil the police had left so that they could begin morning services without harassment.  The \nwindows of the synagogue were shuttered and the front window, made of plate glass, was \ncovered in black paper so that the police could not determine whether anyone was inside. \n146.  On  another  occasion,  in  or  about  the  second  week  of  April,  the  Rabbi  of \nCongregation Zichron Aryeh Leib told police, in plaintiff Perr’s presence, that he had closed the \nsynagogue to congregations as such—“congregate worship” having just been banned by the \nGovernor’s latest  “guidance” on enforcement of his orders—but that individuals were arriving \nthere solely as individuals, which was not “congregate worship” as such. \n147.  By  this  date,  Executive  Order  202.10,  as  explained  by  defendant  Cuomo’s \nGuidance Document, had prohibited “Congregate services within houses of worship” as opposed \nindividuals  entering  the  synagogue  under  the  ten-person  limit  but  without  worship  as  a \n“congregation.” \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 36 of 53\n148.  Because of the ten-person gathering limit imposed by defendant Cuomo, plaintiff \nPerr was unable to have a Bar Mitzvah for his son that had been scheduled for May 2 at his \noriginal synagogue, which had also been closed due to the Governor’s orders and local police \nenforcement. Further, his wife and four daughters and two boys have been unable to attend \nservices since the closure of local synagogues in March, given the still-prevailing ten-person \nlimit. \n149.  The  synagogues  in  Flatbush-Midwood,  including  plaintiff  Perr’s  original \nsynagogue, are still laboring under defendant Cuomo’s ten-person limit for “gatherings.”  \n150.  Plaintiff Perr and his fellow congregants are constantly aware of the potential for \nharassment and prosecution if the ten-person limit is exceeded. Consequently, attendance at \nservices has plummeted from 100-120 persons to the ten men comprising the minyan, with any \nother man showing up being sent to the Women’s Balcony, where the women would sit before \nthe Governor’s “lockdown.”  \n151.  Throughout  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  Congregation  Zichron  Aryeh  Leib  has \nobserved “social distancing,” including more than six feet between the ten or so congregants and \nhand sanitizing.  With social distancing, the synagogue could accommodate approximately 45 \npeople. Its maximum capacity is around 140 people, including children, and women who pray in \nthe upper level. \nPlaintiff Mayer Mayerfeld \n152.  There are four synagogues within a two-block distance of plaintiff Mayerfeld’s \nhome, and he would attend all of them on a daily basis at various times of the week and the \nSabbath depending on the times of the services and how they fit into his schedule.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 37 of 53\n153.  The two main ones he attended were Shaarei Zion and Congregation Bnai Torah. \nThere are at least dozen other Synagogues within a 10-block radius of his home, but were all shut \nabout the same time due to the COVID-19 crisis—around the Sabbath of March 14th. \n154.  After about two weeks of attending a Sephardic synagogue that closed due to \nfears of being padlocked by the NYC Sheriff, plaintiff Mayerfeld began attending Congregation \nZichron Aryeh Leib, where he and the congregants were subjected to intimidation by the NYPD \nat the behest of the Mayor and the Governor.    \n155.  As  alleged  above,  this  synagogue,  also  attended  by  plaintiff  Perr,  has  been \nrepeatedly harassed by a police presence, with officers surveilling the synagogue, sometimes \nentering the synagogue, and other times attempting to gain entry. \n156.  On Tuesday, April 7, while plaintiff Mayerfeld was waiting outside for someone \nto come and unlock the door at Congregation Zichron Aryeh Leib, an NYPD patrol car parked in \nfront of the synagogue and a second patrol car appeared to be circling the block. Two officers got \nout of the car and tried gaining access to the synagogue from the front and side doors. One of \nthem engaged plaintiff Mayerfeld in conversation in order to ascertain if anyone was inside.  \n157.  Plaintiff  Mayerfeld  objected  that  he  did  not  appreciate  the  NYPD  harassing \npeople engaging in their constitutionally protected religious freedom and trying to intimidate \npeople from going to Synagogue. He told this officer there is still a constitution in this country.  \nThe officer responded: “We’re just trying to make sure people are ‘safe.’”   \n158.  In order to be sure of having Saturday services on the Sabbath, the principal day \nof Orthodox Jewish worship, plaintiff Mayerfeld also arranged for a minyan of ten persons in his \nbackyard in the hope of avoiding police harassment. With his four four boys included, plaintiff \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 38 of 53\nMayerfield had half a minyan and with the help of several other people was able to have Sabbath \nservices in a socially distant manner in his yard.  \n159.  On several occasions, however, neighbors came and attempted to disrupt the yard \nservices  or  screamed  nasty  comments  at  plaintiff  Mayerfeld  for  holding  the  minyan  in  his \nbackyard, which is enclosed by hedges.  \n160.  This social ostracizing and bullying is being incited by defendant de Blasio, who \nvowed to crack down on the Jewish community for failing to observe Cuomo’s ban on religious \ngatherings, as alleged above.  Community activists and non-profits are assisting in this effort at \nintimidation, while defendants De Blasio and Cuomo actively encouraged New Yorkers to turn \ntheir neighbors in during their daily press meetings and were actively denigrating anyone who \ndid not follow their rules as being selfish and spreading disease, despite the fact there is no \nscientific evidence that attending a prayer service is any more hazardous than attending donut \nshops or bagel stores, all of which have remained open. \n161.  Plaintiff Mayerfeld ended the Sabbath services in his backyard at the end of May, \nwhen his neighborhood synagogue, Congregation Shaarei Tzion, reopened. \n162.  Worship at Congregation Shaarei Tzion is still severely hampered by the ten-\nperson  limit.  Although  the  capacity  of  the  synagogue  is  approximately  80,  including  the \nWomen’s Balcony, under the ten-person limit only ten men are allowed in the main sanctuary \nand if a few others show up, they are sent to the Women’s Balcony. As a result, Plaintiff \nMayerfeld’s wife and daughter are not able to attend the services. This is the case in all the \nOrthodox synagogues that have reopened, to plaintiff Mayerfeld’s knowledge. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 39 of 53\n163.  Since worship is thus still limited to the minyan, worship by family members and \nother  congregants  beyond  the  minyan  remains  impossible  without  violating  the  challenged \nOrders. \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n(Free Exercise of Religion) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n164.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the factual allegations in ¶¶ 1-\n163.  \n165.  Plaintiffs’  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  compel  them  to  preside  over  or \nparticipate  in  religious  gatherings  in  keeping  with  the  teachings  and  requirements  of  their \nrespective religions. \n166.  The  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution \nprotects plaintiffs’ religious activities. \n167.  The challenged limits on gatherings under defendant Cuomo’s executive orders, \nSDP and NYFP (hereafter “the challenged regulations”), substantially burden plaintiffs’ free \nexercise of religion by forbidding them to preside over or participate in any religious gathering in \ntheir respective houses of worship or elsewhere in the State of New York, save under arbitrarily \noppressive conditions that strictly limit the size of their congregations. \n168.  The challenged regulations are impermissibly underinclusive because they are \nriddled with exceptions while purporting to be facially neutral, fail to prohibit secular activity \nthat endangers the purported state interest in “public health” equally or to a greater degree than \nthe prohibited religious conduct, and burden religious conduct while not affecting substantial \ncategories of conduct that are not religiously motivated.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 40 of 53\n169.  The challenged regulations are therefore not a neutral policy or law of general \napplicability and cannot be sustained unless narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest \nof the highest order.  \n170.  The challenged regulations are not rationally related to a compelling state interest, \nnor are they the least restrictive means of accomplishing the purported compelling state interest \nof reducing the rate of community spread of COVID-19.   \n171.  The undefined term “non-essential gatherings” has no rational relation to the goal \nof “social distancing,” which can be accomplished even more readily in a church setting, where \npeople can sit apart in the pews than in the mass demonstrations defendants condone or in retail \nor office environments rife with direct interpersonal contacts and contact with common surfaces \ntouched by innumerable other people. \n172.  The challenged regulations irrationally undermine the purported state interest by \nfavoring numerous forms of secular activity that pose a greater risk of viral transmission than the \nprohibited religious gatherings. \n173.  Defendants have less restrictive means of achieving any legitimate interest served \nby the challenged regulations, those being the same conditions on which they allow retail and \nnon-retail businesses to operate: i.e., “social distancing” and sanitization. \n174.  As  the  pleaded  facts  demonstrate,  the  challenged  regulations  irrationally, \ninvidiously, and without any legitimate, much less compelling, state purpose discriminate against \nreligious activities in favor of secular and commercial activities, including mass demonstrations \nthat violate the same regulations. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 41 of 53\n175.  Both facially and as applied to plaintiffs, the challenged regulations violate the \nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n176.  In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs will be irreparably \nharmed.  \n177.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution  \n(Violation of Freedom of Speech, Assembly and Expressive Association) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n178.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations in ¶¶ 1-163. \n179.  The First Amendment protects plaintiffs’ right to peaceably assemble together \nwith the members of their congregations.  \n180.  Plaintiffs’  religious  assemblies  are  intertwined  with  speech  and  expressive \nassociation, meaning the right to associate with others of like mind for a protected purpose. \n181.  Because  the  undefined  term  “non-essential  gatherings”  employed  in  the \nchallenged  regulations  has  no  rational  relationship  to  the  goal  of  “limiting  the  spread”  of \nCOVID-19 by “social distancing,” which can be practiced more easily, or no less easily, in a \nchurch or synagogue than in the retail and office environments and mass demonstrations the \ndefendants favor, the challenged regulations operate solely to discriminate arbitrarily against \ngroups of people based on their social, political or religious purposes rather than any alleged lack \nof “social distancing.” \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 42 of 53\n182.  Defendants have less restrictive means of regulating gatherings for the stated \npurpose of “reducing the rate of community spread of COVID-19.” \n183.  The  challenged  regulations  do  not  serve  any  compelling  or  even  significant \ngovernment interest and are not narrowly tailored to achieve any legitimate state purpose. \n184.  The challenged regulations impermissibly infringe freedom of speech, assembly \nand  expressive  association  without  serving  any  compelling  or  even  significant  government \ninterest.  \n185.  In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs will be irreparably \nharmed. \n186.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights.  \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment  \n(Equal Protection – Substantive Due Process) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n187.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in ¶¶ 1-\n184. \n188.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution guarantees equal protection of the laws, which requires that the State not treat the \n“suspect class” of religion differently from the class of similarly situated people or pass laws that \nburden First Amendment rights. \n189.  The challenged regulations treat the class or subclass of people who exercise \nfreedom of religion by gathering with others for that purpose, including plaintiffs, differently \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 43 of 53\nfrom the similarly situated class of people who gather with others for secular purposes, including \nthe mass demonstrations defendants have exempted from their regulatory regime. \n190.  Moreover,  the  class  of  those  who  gather  for  religious  purposes  in  churches, \nchapels and synagogues is plainly less subject to the risk of infection or transmission than those \nengaged  in  mass  demonstrations,  commercial  transactions  involving  crowded  offices,  large \ncrowds every day of the week, physical exchanges, and common surfaces touched by potentially \nmillions of people, which makes the suspect classification targeted by the challenged regulations \neven more irrational and invidious. \n191.  The challenged regulations cannot survive the strict scrutiny required of suspect \nclassifications under the substantive due process component of the Equal Protection Clause as \nthey are far from neutral and generally applicable and are not narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling state interest. \n192.  The challenged regulations, both facially and as applied, also violate plaintiffs’ \nfundamental rights to freedom of speech, assembly and expressive association as alleged above. \n193.  Even if the challenged regulations did not involve a suspect classification or \nviolate  fundamental  rights,  their  severe  restriction  of  religious  gatherings,  while  permitting \nnumerous  secular  and  commercial  gatherings  unrestricted  as  to  size,  including  the  mass \ndemonstrations of which defendants approve, is not even rationally related to a legitimate state \ninterest and thus cannot survive even rational basis analysis under the Equal Protection Clause. \n194.  Alternatively,  the  challenged  regulations  cannot  survive  heightened  scrutiny \nunder the “hybrid-rights” theory the United States Supreme Court has recognized for purposes of \nEqual Protection analysis when, as here, multiple rights are violated by a purportedly neutral \nlaw. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 44 of 53\n195.  The  challenged  regulations  thus  violate  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including its substantive component. \n196.   In the absence of declaratory and injunctive relief, plaintiffs will be irreparably \nharmed.  \n197.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights.  \nCOUNT IV \nUltra Vires State Action  \nin Violation of Federal Rights  \n \n198.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in ¶¶ 1-\n195. \n199.  Defendant Cuomo relies on New York State Executive Law § 29-a as the basis for \nthe challenged regulations.  Said statute provides in pertinent part as follows: \n1. Subject to the state constitution, the federal constitution and federal statutes and \nregulations, the governor may by executive order temporarily suspend specific \nprovisions of any statute, local law, ordinance, or orders, rules or regulations, or \nparts thereof, of any agency during a state disaster emergency, if compliance with \nsuch provisions would prevent, hinder, or delay action necessary to cope with the \ndisaster. \n \n2. Suspensions pursuant to subdivision one of this section shall be subject to the \nfollowing standards and limits: \n \na. no suspension shall be made for a period in excess of thirty days, provided, \nhowever, that upon reconsideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, \nthe governor may extend the suspension for additional periods not to exceed thirty \ndays each; \n \nb. no suspension shall be made which does not safeguard the health and welfare \nof the public and which is not reasonably necessary to the disaster effort; \n \nc. any such suspension order shall specify the statute, local law, ordinance, order, \nrule or regulation or part thereof to be suspended and the terms and conditions of \nthe suspension; \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 45 of 53\n \nd. the order may provide for such suspension only under particular circumstances, \nand may provide for the alteration or modification of the requirements of such \nstatute, local law, ordinance, order, rule or regulation suspended, and may include \nother terms and conditions; \n \ne. any such suspension order shall provide for the minimum deviation from the \nrequirements  of  the  statute,  local  law,  ordinance,  order,  rule  or  regulation \nsuspended  consistent  with  the  disaster  action  deemed  necessary…  (emphasis \nadded). \n \n200.  Executive Law § 29-a provides no authority for the plethora of detailed positive \nedicts Cuomo has promulgated by executive fiat, regulating virtually every aspect of the lives of \nsome  8  million  people  in  the  State  of  New  York,  including  plaintiffs’  exercise  of  First \nAmendment rights as pleaded above. \n201.  Rather, Executive Law § 29-a expressly limits its scope according “to the state \nconstitution, the federal constitution and federal statutes and regulations…” Id. \n202.  The challenged regulations are ultra vires the statute on which defendant Cuomo \nrelies in that Cuomo has legislated rather than confining himself to the limited process of \ntemporarily suspending certain laws, orders, rules or regulations by executive order. \n203.  The New York State Constitution provides for a complete separation of powers \namong  the  three  “co-ordinate  and  co[-]equal  branches”  of  government:  the  executive,  the \nlegislative, and the judicial. N.Y. Const., art. III, sec. 1; art. IV, sec. 1; and art. VI. \n204.  Article  III,  Section  1  of  the  New  York  State  Constitution  provides:  “The \nlegislative power of this state shall be vested in the senate and assembly.” N.Y. Const., art. III, \nsec. 1. \n205.  Nowhere in the New York State Constitution is the Chief Executive, defendant \nCuomo, given or delegated any legislative authority. Rather, “The [G]overnor shall have power \nto convene the legislature, or the senate only, on extraordinary occasions. At extraordinary \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 46 of 53\nsessions convened pursuant to the provisions of this section no subject shall be acted upon, \nexcept such as the [G]overnor may recommend for consideration.” N.Y. Const., art. IV, sec. 3. \n206.  The Governor’s exercise of emergency power during the COVID-19 outbreak \nrequired that defendant Cuomo convene the legislature on an extraordinary basis in order to take \nwhatever legislative measures were deemed reasonably necessary according to the separation of \npowers. Defendant Cuomo has never convened the legislature. \n207.  As another challenger of Cuomo’s reign by executive fiat in this District has \nalleged (HoganWillig v. James, et al. Case 1:20-cv-00577), which allegations plaintiffs hereby \nadopt and adapt to this pleading: \na.  [T]he COVID-19 challenge is similar to what the public has faced many \ntimes before. New Yorkers have weathered floods and braved hurricanes; \noutlasted droughts and survived economic depressions; and, yes, they have \npersisted in the face of diseases more contagious and detrimental to the \npublic welfare than the one we countenance today. \n \nb.  Once Defendant Cuomo was convinced that his unilateral, unprecedented \nactions were necessary, a convenient presumption arose that the danger \nthe public faced, too, was unprecedented. Had the public gone about its \nbusiness as usual, there is not a single reason to believe that there would \nbe a need for commercial lockdowns or home isolation orders. \n \nc.  In short, Defendant Cuomo has been unconstitutionally legislating from \nthe very exigency he created. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy of the most \ndangerous sort. \n \nd.  As Defendant Cuomo sees it, the proof of the severity of the COVID-19 \npandemic is that we have been compelled to “shelter in place” and don \nmedical masks at all hours of the day. And, Defendant Cuomo would \npermit us to shed these restrictions only by showing that the COVID-19 \npandemic has subsided. \n \ne.  In the United States, the burden is always on the government to justify its \nactions,  not  on  the  citizenry  to  wait  out  its  deprivations;  this  is  the \ningenious method we have devised to ensure that our laws are cloaked \nwith good faith and founded in rational purpose. \n \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 47 of 53\n208.  Defendant Cuomo’s ultra vires acts, as enforced by him and defendants James \nand de Blasio, should be declared void and unenforceable, as they constitute state action in \nviolation of all the constitutional rights the challenged regulations infringe, as pleaded above.  \n209.  In  the  absence  of  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  voiding  and  enjoining \ndefendants’ ultra vires acts, plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed.  \n210.  Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the violation of their constitutional \nrights.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court grant the following relief: \nA. A temporary restraining order, followed by a preliminary and final injunction \nrestraining defendants, and all those acting in concert with them, from enforcing \nany gathering limits on plaintiffs’ religious gatherings, including the ten-person \nlimit on “non-essential gatherings,” the “drive-in” requirement for larger “non-\nessential gatherings,” and the limitation of occupancy of houses of worship to \n25% of building capacity; \nB.  In  the  alternative,  compelling  defendants  to  apply  to  plaintiffs’  religious \ngatherings no greater limits than they have placed on essential retail businesses \nand the mass demonstrations approved by defendants Cuomo and de Blasio; \nC.  A declaratory judgment that (1) the challenged regulations, including the ten-\nperson limit on “gatherings,” the “drive-in” requirement for larger “gatherings,” \nand the limitation of occupancy of house of worship to 25% of building capacity \nare unconstitutional, both individually and taken together, both facially and as \napplied to plaintiffs; and (2) that defendant Cuomo’s gathering limits imposed by \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00651-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 06/10/20   Page 48 of 53\nexecutive order are ultra vires his authority under Executive Law § 29-a, void and \nunconstitutional both facially and as applied to plaintiffs. \nD. An award of costs of this litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \nE.  Such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper. \nDated: June 10, 2020    \n                   Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n                                                     \n                                                                               ________________________________ \n CHRISTOPHER A.
