    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit, filed on March 13, 2020, was brought in the Montana state district court for the Thirteenth District in Yellowstone County. The plaintiffs were the Chair of the Montana Democratic Party Robyn Driscoll, the Montana Democratic Party, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and they brought suit against the Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. </p><p>The complaint centered around three absentee voting restrictions passed in 2019. The first was the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, which limited the types of people permitted to take into possession a voter's absentee ballot. Additionally, the Registration Requirement mandated that all people who did take absentee ballots into possession sign a registry giving information about the voter and the person assisting the voter. Finally, the Election Day Cutoff voided all ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day, meaning that if a voter submitted an absentee ballot by mail they would have to do so a week or more before Election Day to ensure that the ballot would be counted. The plaintiffs argued that these provisions represented violations of the Montana constitution's guarantees of suffrage, free speech, and procedural due process. The suffrage claim contended that the benefits to these restrictions were insufficiently weighty to justify the restrictions to the ballot. Regarding free speech, the complaint alleged that the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and the Registration Requirement imposed barriers to voter turnout efforts, which were a form of political speech. Finally, the procedural due process arguments claimed that these provisions failed to provide procedural protections necessary to ensure voters' rights to the ballot. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would prohibit the state's enforcement of these provisions. </p><p>On May 22, the court granted a preliminary injunction that prohibited the state from enforcing both the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and the Registration Requirement. It also mandated the government to count all ballots postmarked on or before the election day. </p><p>The defendants appealed to the Montana Supreme Court. Their June 26 brief contended that the district court erred when they applied a strict scrutiny standard to evaluating Montana's election laws. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that statutes violated their fundamental right to vote and were therefore properly enjoined. </p><p>Meanwhile, several Native American groups had intervened, siding with the plaintiffs. These Native American groups were litigating similar issues in <i>Western Native Voices v. Stapleton</i>, but because the appeal in that case would not be decided before the election, the Montana Supreme Court decided to let them intervene here. More information about <i>Western Native Voices v. Stapleton</i> can be found <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17421\">here</a>. The Montana Legislatures, represented by the Montana Speaker of the House and Montana State Senate President, also moved to intervene, but their motions were denied on August 11.</p><p>In an opinion written by Justice Beth Baker and published on September 29, 2020, the Montana Supreme Court reversed the district court's preliminary injunction against the election-day ballot deadline, but affirmed the preliminary injunction against the ballot-delivery restriction. The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenged three Montana state election laws. The case was brought in March of 2020 in Montana state court, arguing that three Montana provisions were contrary to the Montana state constitution. The plaintiffs, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Commission, the Montana Democratic Party, and Chair of the Montana Democratic Party Robyn Driscoll, filed suit against Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton. First, the suit took aim at the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, which prohibited the handling of absentee ballots by third parties except under limited circumstances. Second, they argued against the Registration Requirement, which said that in those limited circumstances where third parties can handle ballots, they must sign a registry and give personal information about themselves and the voter. Finally, the case took issue with the Election Day Cutoff, which said that no ballots would be counted if they were not received by 8 p.m. on election day. \r\n\r\nOn May 22, the court granted a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the state from enforcing these laws. The defendant appealed to the Montana Supreme Court. The case is ongoing as of August 13, 2020.",

Code Ann.§ 13-35-701 et seq., and the election day receipt deadline for \n22 \nabsentee ballots set forth in Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201 (3), Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-\n23 \n211 (3), and Mont. Code Ann. § 13-19-1 06(5)(b). Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' \n24 \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. The parties have agreed to submit the issue of whether \n25 \nthe Court should issue a preliminary injunction based upon the parties' briefs and \n26 \n27  affidavits. Both parties have waived their right to a hearing under Mont. Code Ann. §27- 19-\n1 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  303. The preliminary injunction issues have been fully briefed and the matter is now ripe \n2 \nfor decision. \n3 \nI.  The Ballot Interference Protection Act. \n4 \nExcept for election officials or United States postal workers, the Ballot Interference \n5 \nProtection Act (BIPA) restricts who can collect a voter's voted or unvoted ballot. Mont. \n6 \n7  Code Ann. § 13-35-703. BIPA permits only caregivers, family members, household \n8  members, or acquaintances to collect ballots, but prohibits them from collecting and \n9 \nconveying more than six ballots. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-703(2) and (3). The BIPA also \n10 \nrequires every caregiver, family member, household member, or acquaintance who \n11 \ndelivers another person's ballot to sign a registry and provide: (1) the individual's name, \n12 \naddress, and phone number; (2) the voter's name and address; and (3) the individual's \n13 \n14  relationship to the voter whose ballot is being delivered. Mont. Code Ann.§ 13-35-704. \n15  The BIPA imposes a $500.00 fine for each ballot unlawfully collected. Mont. Code Ann. \n16 \n§ 13-35-705. \n17 \nII.  The Absentee Ballot Election Day Receipt Deadline. \n18 \nThe absentee ballot election day receipt deadline (Receipt Deadline) requires \n19 \nabsentee ballots to be received at a designated election office, polling place, place of \n20 \n21  deposit, or by an authorized election official before 8:00 p.m. on election day. Mont. Code \n22  Ann. § 13-13-201 (2)(e )(i)-(iv). Absentee ballots received after the 8:00 p.m. election day \n23  deadline are not counted. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201 (3); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-\n24 \n211(3); Mont. Code Ann.§ 13-19-106(5)(b). \n25 \n26 \n27 \n2 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\nI  Ill.  Plaintiffs Alleged Constitutional Violations. \n2 \nPlaintiffs claim that, without furthering any legitimate state interests, the BIPA and \n3 \nReceipt Deadline significantly burden the right to vote and infringe upon the rights to free \n4 \nspeech, association, and due process. The Plaintiffs argue that the BIPA and Receipt \n5 \nDeadline violate the fundamental constitutional rights of suffrage, assembly, speech, and \n6 \n7  due process under Montana's Constitution. Mont. Canst. art. II,§ 13, § 6, § 7, and§ 171• \n8  Unless enjoined, Plaintiffs assert that the BIPA and Receipt Deadline will make it \n9 \nsignificantly more difficult for many Montanans to vote or to have their votes counted. \n10 \nIV.  State's Justifications for the BIPA and Receipt Deadline. \n11 \nThe State argues that the BIPA is necessary to prevent fraud when absentee \n12 \nballots are collected and delivered. The State contends that the Receipt Deadline is \n13 \n14  necessary to treat absentee voters the same as in person voters and to provide timely, \n15  accurate election results. Because the BIPA and Receipt Deadline are alleged to serve \n16 \nlegitimate and compelling state interests, the State argues that the laws are constitutional. \n17 \nThe State further argues that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case showing \n18 \nthat a preliminary injunction is necessary. \n19 \nV.  Preliminary Injunction Requirements. \n20 \n21  Under Mont. Code Ann.§ 27-19-201, a preliminary injunction may be granted: \n22  (1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and \nthe relief or any part of the relief consists in restraining the commission or \n23 \ncontinuance of the act complained of, either for a limited period or \nperpetually; \n24 \n(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during \n25  the litigation would produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant; \n(3) when it appears during the litigation that the adverse party is doing or \n26 \n27  1 Because of time constraints, the Court will address the Plaintiffs' Article II, Section 13 claim and reserve ruling upon \nthe other alleged constitutional violations at this time. \n3 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  threatens or is about to do or is procuring or suffering to be done some act \nin violation of the applicant's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and \n2 \ntending to render the judgment ineffectual; \n(4) when it appears that the adverse party, during the pendency of the \n3 \naction, threatens or is about to remove or to dispose of the adverse party's \n4  property with intent to defraud the applicant, an injunction order may be \ngranted to restrain the removal or disposition; \n5  (5) when it appears that the applicant has applied for an order under the \nprovisions of 40-4-121 or an order of protection under Title 40, chapter 15. \n6 \n7  The above subsections are disjunctive, \"meaning that findings that satisfy one subsection \n8  are sufficient.\" Sweet Grass Farms, Ltd. v. Bd. Of Cty. Comm'rs of Sweet Grass Cty., \n9 \n2000 MT 147, 1}27 (quoting Stark v. Bomer, 226 Mont. 356, 359, 735 P.2d 314, 317 \n10 \n(1987)). Consequently, only one subsection of Mont. Code Ann. 27-19-201 needs be met \n11 \nto support the issuance of a preliminary injunction. See Stark, 735 P.2d at 317. \n12 \nAdditionally, the \"grant or denial of injunctive relief is a matter within the broad discretion \n13 \n14  of the district court based on applicable findings of fact and conclusions of law.\" Weems v. \n15  State by & through Fox, 2019 MT 98, 1J 7 (quoting Davis v.  Westphal, 2017 MT 276, \n16 \n1}1 0). \n17 \nFurther, the district court \"does not determine the underlying merits of the case in \n18 \nresolving a request for preliminary injunction.\" Weems, 1J 18. And \"[i]n the context of a \n19 \nconstitutional challenge, an applicant for preliminary injunction need not demonstrate that \n20 \n21  the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, but 'must establish a prima \n22  facie case of a violation of its rights under' the Constitution.\" /d. (quoting City of Billings v. \n23 \nCty. Water Dist. of Billings Heights. 281 Mont. 219, 227, 935 P.2d 246, 251 \n24 \n(1997)). '\"Prima facie' means literally 'at first sight' or 'on first appearance but subject to \n25 \nfurther evidence or information.\"' Weems, 1f 18 (quoting Prima facie, Black's Law \n26 \nDictionary (10th ed. 2014)). Because Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction \n27 \n4 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  based on constitutional challenges, they must establish a prima facie case of a \n2 \nconstitutional violation. \n3 \nSection 13 of Montana's Constitution states: \"All elections shall be free and open, \n4 \nand no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the \n5 \nright of suffrage.\" Mont. Con st. art. II, § 13. The right of suffrage is a fundamental \n6 \n7  right. See e.g. State v. Riggs, 2005 MT 124, 1f 47 (citations omitted) (\"A right is \n8  'fundamental' under Montana's Constitution if the right ... is found in the Declaration of \n9 \nRights.\") \n10 \nBecause voting rights are fundamental, statutes like the BIPA and the Receipt \n11 \nDeadline that allegedly infringe upon the right to vote \"must be strictly scrutinized and can \n12 \nonly survive scrutiny if the State establishes a compelling state interest and that its action \n13 \n14  is closely tailored to effectuate that interest and is the least onerous path that can be \n15  taken to achieve the State's objective.\" Montana Envtl. Info. Ctr. v. Dep't. of Envtl. Quality, \n16  1999 MT 248, 1f 63; Finke v. State ex. Rei. McGrath, 2003 MT 48, ~ 15. The State must \n17 \n\"prove the compelling interest by competent evidence.\" Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. \n18 \n287, 911 P.2d 1165, 1174 (1996). Merely alleging that a compelling interest exists is not \n19 \nenough to justify interference with the exercise of a fundamental right. /d. \n20 \n21  VI.  Findings of Fact. \n22  1.  In support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the Plaintiffs submitted \n23 \nthe following Affidavits: \n24 \na.  Affidavit of Kenneth Mayer, Ph.D. \n25  -expert opinions on voter suppression effects of BIPA and Receipt \nDeadline; \n26 \n27 \n5 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n6 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  2.  The Court finds that, without exception, all Affidavits were verified and that \n2 \nthe material allegations in each Affidavit were made positively and not upon information \n3 \nand belief. \n4 \n3.  The Court finds that, for the purposes of determining whether the Plaintiffs \n5 \nhave presented a prima facie case for a preliminary injunction, the statements made by \n6 \n7  the Affiants are credible and based upon extensive personal experience. The Court further \n8  finds that the expert opinions expressed by Dr. Mayer are credible and persuasive. Dr. \n9 \nMayer has extensive education, training, and experience in the field of election \n10 \nadministration, the impact of direct and indirect costs2 on voter turnout, and the \n11 \nrelationship between socioeconomic and educational status on the ability to absorb voting \n12 \ncosts3. The methodology Dr. Mayer used is widely recognized and accepted in his field. \n13 \n14  Dr. Mayer's expert testimony has been accepted by both state and federal courts4. His \n15  research has been published in many peer reviewed journals5. The Court finds that the \n16 \nState has not challenged Dr. Mayer's opinions. \n17 \n4.  Based upon Plaintiffs' Affidavits, the Court finds that the BlPA and Receipt \n18 \nDeadline will significantly suppress voter turnout by disproportionately burdening voters \n19 \nwho are Native American6, elderly7, disabled8, poor9, parents working low-wage jobs10, \n20 \n21  college students11, first-time voters12, and voters who have historically relied on GOTV and \n22 \n23  2 Includes administrative burdens and compliance costs. \n3 Affidavit of Dr. Kenneth Mayer at 2-3 \n24  4 /d. \nSJd. \n25  6 Affidavit of Linda Stoll \n7 Affidavit of Trent Badger and Affidavit of Robyn Driscoll \n6 Affidavit of Beth Brenneman \n26 \n9 Affidavit of Robyn Driscoll and Affidavit of Mary Glueckert \n10 Affidavit of Shelbi Dantic \n27  11 Affidavit of Mary Glueckert and Affidavit of Sophie Moon \n12 Affidavit of Mary Glueckert \n7 \nFindings of Fact, Concfusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Prefiminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  ballot collection services like those provided by Western Native Voice13, MontPIRG14, \n2 \nDisability Rights Montana15, Fotward Montana16, Montana Conservation Voters17, \n3 \nunionized labor18, and the Montana Democratic Party19• \n4 \n5.  The Court further finds that, in opposing the Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary \n5 \nInjunction, the State failed to present any evidence to dispute the Plaintiffs' evidence (1) \n6 \n7  that the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes disproportionately burden the voters identified \n8  in paragraph 4 above or (2) that the statutes significantly suppress voter turnout by making \n9 \nvoting more burdensome and costly for absentee voters. \n10 \n6.  The Court finds that the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes will only \n11 \nexacerbate voter suppression because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Requiring absentee \n12 \nvoters to line up, fill out a registry form, and be quizzed by an election official before \n13 \n14  delivering someone else's ballot violates the social distancing required to prevent the \n15  unnecessary spread of COVID-19. Because a significant percentage of absentee voters \n16 \ndeliver their ballots shortly before or on election day, long lines and crowded election \n17 \noffices will be commonplace20. The BIPA's registry requirement eliminated the previous \n18 \nuse of secure ballot drop boxes that election officials could place at various sites \n19 \nthroughout a community or county to make absentee voting easy, convenient, and safe. \n20 \n21  The COVID-19 pandemic will only increase absentee voting, thereby amplifying the voter \n22  suppression effects of the BJPA and Receipt Deadline21. \n23 \n24  13 Affidavit of Dr. Kenneth Mayer \n14 Affidavit of Mary Glueckert \n25  15 Affidavit of Beth Brenneman \n16 Affidavit of Dr. Kenneth Mayer \n26  17 Declaration of Shelbi Dantic \n16 Affidavit of Denver Henderson \n19 Affidavit of Dr. Kenneth Mayer \n27  20 Affidavit of Dr. Kenneth Mayer \n21 ld. \n8 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYelfowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  7.  Based upon Dr. Mayer's Affidavit, the Court finds that there has never been \n2 \na documented case of absentee ballot collection fraud in Montana. \n3 \n8.  The Court finds that the Receipt Deadline disproportionately burdens voters \n4 \nwho mail their absentee ballots when compared to voters who vote in person. The Receipt \n5 \nDeadline requires mailed absentee ballots to be received by 8:00 p.m. on election day. If a \n6 \n7  mailed absentee ballot is not received by 8:00p.m. on election day, it is not counted. The \n8  Receipt Deadline deadline disenfranchises voters who vote before election day, but whose \n9 \nballots are not delivered by the United States Postal Service until after election day. \n10 \nDelivery times can vary as much as two weeks in Montana depending upon a voter's \n11 \nlocation22• Even if living in the same city, delivery times can vary from one to seven days. \n12 \n9.  The Court finds that the disparity and inconsistency of how long it takes to \n13 \n14  deliver a mailed absentee ballot significantly burdens absentee voters (1) because they \n15  must vote at least a week before the election to have a good chance of having their vote \n16 \ncounted; (2) because they have less time and information to decide how to vote; and (3) \n17 \nbecause there is no guarantee that, even by voting a week early, their ballot will be \n18 \ndelivered in time to be counted. \n19 \n10.  The Court also finds that there is considerable confusion and \n20 \n21  misunderstanding among voters about when they must vote by mail. Many believe, based \n22  upon filing income tax returns and paying property taxes, that their vote will be counted if \n23 \npostmarked on or before election day. Others reasonably believe that their mailed ballot \n24 \nwill be delivered expeditiously if mailed a day or two before election day, especially if \n25 \nmailed to their local election office. \n26 \n27 \n22fd. \n9 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause~ No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  11.  The Court finds that this misunderstanding and confusion disproportionately \n2 \nburdens first time voters, persons with less education, and persons who have historically \n3 \nrelied on ballot collection services. \n4 \n12.  The Court finds that, during the current 2020 election cycle, the combined \n5 \neffects of the BIPA and Receipt Deadline will cause thousands of Montanans to not vote or \n6 \n7  will result in their votes not being counted. \n8  13.  Though the State alleges that the BIPA promotes the State's compelling \n9 \ninterest in preventing voting fraud, the Court finds that the State has failed to present any \n10 \nevidence of absentee ballot collection fraud in Montana. \n11 \n14.  The Court finds that the BIPA serves no legitimate purpose: it does not \n12 \nenhance the security or integrity of absentee voting; it does not reduce the costs or \n13 \n14  burdens of conducting elections; it does not make absentee voting easer or more efficient; \n15  it does not reduce confusion about absentee voting requirements; and it does not increase \n16 \nvoter turnout. \n17 \n15.  The Court finds that not a single election official in Montana supported the \n18 \nBIPA in legislative hearings; nor has the State presented any evidence from any election \n19 \nofficial that the BIPA: (1) will promote the integrity, security or efficiency of absentee voting; \n20 \n21  (2) will reduce election costs or burdens; and (3) will increase voter turnout. The evidence \n22  from election officials has been just the opposite. In fact, one election official from Cascade \n23 \nCounty who testified before the State Administration and Veteran Affairs Committee on \n24 \nFebruary 27, 2020 characterized the BIPA as the \"Voter Suppression Act of2018.\" \n25 \nPlaintiffs' Ex.3 at p. 24. \n26 \n27 \n10 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  16.  The Court finds that the State also failed to present any evidence that the \n2 \nReceipt Deadline promotes a compelling state interest. \n3 \n17.  The Court finds that the Receipt Deadline fails to treat in person and \n4 \nabsentee ballot voters uniformly. As long as in person voters are in line by 8:00 p.m. on \n5 \nelection day, their ballots are counted no matter how many hours after the 8:00 p.m. \n6 \n7  deadline they actually vote. Not so with absentee voters, whose votes will not be counted if \n8  received after the 8:00 p.m. deadline even if they voted days before the deadline. \n9 \n18.  While the State has a compelling interest in accurately tabulating and \n10 \nreporting election results in a timely fashion, the State failed to present any evidence that \n11 \nthe Receipt Deadline furthers that interest. The State does not limit the time period for \n12 \ncertifying election results; Montana counts federal write-in ballots for military and overseas \n13 \n14  votes until the Monday after election day and provisional ballots are not even counted until \n15  six days after election day. The State failed to present any evidence that using a postmark \n16 \ndeadline, where all mailed ballots are counted if postmarked on or before election day and \n17 \nreceived by the same deadline for federal write-in ballots for military and overseas voters, \n18 \nwould frustrate the State's ability to timely certify election results. The Court finds that, by \n19 \nusing a postmark deadline, the State can accurately and timely certify election results \n20 \n21  without disenfranchising the thousands of eligible voters whose ballots are now ignored \n22  under the Receipt Deadline. \n23 \nVII.  Conclusions of Law. \n24 \n1.  The Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of presenting a prima facie case \n25 \nthrough credible and persuasive evidence that the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes \n26 \n27 \n11 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  burden and interfere with the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by article II, section 13 \n2 \nof Montana's Constitution. \n3 \n2.  The State has failed to demonstrate through competent evidence that there \n4 \nis any compelling state interest that warrants the burdens and interference on the right to \n5 \nvote imposed by the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes. \n6 \n7  3.  If a preliminary injunction is not granted, the BIPA and Receipt Deadline \n8  statutes will cause irreparable harm to thousands of Montana voters by preventing \n9 \nabsentee ballot voters from voting or by disenfranchising those whose absentee ballots \n10 \nare received after election day. \n11 \n4.  This Court concludes that the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes are \n12 \nsubject to strict scrutiny and that the State must demonstrate though competent evidence \n13 \n14  that the statutes further compelling state interests. This Court's decision to grant a \n15  preliminary injunction, however, would not change even under the balancing test \n16 \nadvocated by the State, i.e. balancing the burdens the statutes impose against the \n17 \ninterests the state advances for burdening voting rights. The Court has found that the BIPA \n18 \nand Receipt Deadline statutes advance no legitimate state interests, yet place significant \n19 \nburdens on the fundamental right to vote. The State would not prevail even under the \n20 \n21  balancing test it advocates. \n22  5.  Based upon the evidence submitted thus far, the Court concludes that the \n23 \nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits and would be entitled to a permanent injunction \n24 \nto enjoin the enforcement of the BIPA and Receipt Deadlines statutes. \n25 \n6.  The Court concludes that, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 27-19-201 (1) and \n26 \n(2), a preliminary injunction should issue enjoining the enforcement of the BIPA and \n27 \n12 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20·408 \n\n1  Receipt Deadline statutes because the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes violate the \n2 \nright to vote. The Court reserves ruling upon whether these statutes also violate additional \n3 \nconstitutional rights as Plaintiffs allege. \n4 \nVIII.  Memorandum. \n5 \nWhile not essential to the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the \n6 \n7  Court will address the additional arguments asserted by the State. \n8  1.  Plaintiffs' delay in seeking a preliminary injunction. \n9 \nThe State argues that Plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion should be denied \n. \n10 \nbecause Plaintiffs' delay in seeking a preliminary injunction until just before the June 2 \n11 \nprimary election undermines their claim of irreparable harm. Def.'s Resp. 2. In Montana, \n12 \nthe right to vote is a fundamental right guaranteed by Montana's Constitution. State v. \n13 \n14  Riggs, 2005 MT 124, 1f47. The loss of a constitutional right \"constitutes irreparable harm \n15  for the purpose of determining whether a preliminary injunction should be issued.\" Mont. \n16 \nCannabis Indus. Ass'n v. State, 2012 MT 201, 1f15 (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, \n17 \n373 (1976)). As set forth above, the Plaintiffs have shown the BIPA and the Receipt \n18 \nDeadline violate Montanans' constitutional right to vote. The Plaintiffs have demonstrated \n19 \nirreparable harm for the purposes of determining whether a preliminary injunction should \n20 \n21  be issued. \n22 \nThe State also argues that Plaintiffs should be estopped from complaining about \n23 \nirreparable harm due to their delay in bringing the case. Def.'s Resp. 2. The cases the \n24 \nState cites to support its argument, however, are inapplicable here because those courts \n25 \nwere faced with determining irreparable injury for copyright, trademark, and antitrust and \n26 \ntrade violations, not constitutional violations. Def.'s Resp. 2-3 (citing Oakland Tribune, Inc. \n27 \n13 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\nI  v. Chronica/ Pub/'g Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 (91h Cir. 1985); Garcia v. Google, Inc. 768 \n2 \nF.3d 733, 746 (91h Cir. 2015); Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 276-77 (2\"d Cit. \n3 \n1985)). The Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm per se by presenting a prima facie \n4 \ncase that the BIPA and Receipt Deadline statutes violate Montanans' constitutional right \n5 \nto vote. \n6 \n7  2.  Timing of preliminary injunction. \n8  The State also argues that the -U.S. Supreme Court has \"repeatedly emphasized\" \n9 \nits disfavor of altering election rules by injunction on the eve of an election because such \n10 \norders can result in \"voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the \nII \npolls.\" Def.'s Resp. 3 (quoting Rep. Nat'/ Comm. V. Dem. Nat'/ Comm., 206 LEd. 2d 452, \n12 \n453-54 (2020) (pur curiam); Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006)). However, the U.S. \n13 \nI4  Supreme Court explained: \n15  [i]mportantly, in their preliminary injunction motions, the plaintiffs did not ask \nthe District Court allow ballots mailed and postmarked after election day ... \n16 \nbe counted ... [t]hat is a critical point in the case ... the District Court \nunilaterally ordered absentee ballots mailed and postmarked after election \n17 \nday ... still be counted ... [e]xtending the date by which ballots may be \n18  cast by voters-not just received by the municipal clerks but cast by \nvoters-for an additional six days after the scheduled election day \n19 \nfundamentally alters the nature of the election. \n20 \nRep. Nat'/ Comm. 206 L. Ed. 2d 452 at 1206-7. \n21 \nRep. Nat'/ Comm. is not applicable here for several reasons. First, the relief sought \n22 \nby the Plaintiffs here is the relief granted by this Court. Second, this Court is not altering \n23 \n24  the \"date by which ballots may be cast by voters,\" but rather whether absentee ballots \n25  postmarked on or before election day can be counted. The preliminary injunction does not \n26 \n\"fundamentally alter the nature of the election\". /d. Third, the injunction here will not result \n27 \nin voter confusion nor will it disenfranchise voters. Instead, the Court's preliminary \n14 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\nI  injunction will mitigate the voter suppression effects of the BIPA and Receipt Deadline \n2 \nstatutes. Specifically, those absentee ballots received by the election office after the \n3 \nReceipt Deadline and those delivered by persons outside the statutory exceptions in \n4 \nBIPA will now be counted. Because the preliminary injunction granted here does not \n5 \n\"fundamentally alter the nature of the election\" or result in voter confusion or \n6 \n7  disenfranchisement, the State's reliance on Rep. Nat'/ Comm is misplaced. /d. \n8  3.  BIPA's passage by referendum. \n9 \nThe State next argues that because the BIPA was passed by Montana voters by a \n10 \nwide majority, the referendum was a \"demonstration of a compelling state interest.\" Def.'s \n11 \nResp. at 6 (citing Montana Auto. Ass'n v. Greely, 193 Mont. 378, 384, 632 P .2d 300, 303 \n12 \n(1981)). In Montana Auto. Ass'n, the Montana Supreme Court stated that \"the statewide \n13 \n14  vote on 1-85 is a demonstration of a compelling state interest in the enactment of 1-85.\" /d. \n15  However, the Court also declared portions of the initiative unconstitutional. /d. While the \n16 \nMontana Supreme Court has recognized that a statewide initiative passed by Montana \n17 \nvoters can indicate a compelling state interest, initiatives must still pass constitutional \n18 \nmuster. Whether enacted by the legislature or by voter referendum, statutes cannot \n19 \nviolate the Constitution. The State's argument that the SIPA  's enactment by referendum \n20 \n21  shields the BIPA from constitutional scrutiny is mistaken. \n22  4.  Voter fraud in other states. \n23 \nThe State argues that voter fraud in other states constitutes a compelling state \n24 \ninterest for adopting the BIPA. The State contends that Montana \"need not wait for \n25 \nevidence of fraud [in Montana] to justify preventative measures.\" Def.'s Resp. at 7. The \n26 \nState's argument ignores the Plaintiffs' evidence: (1) that the BIPA targets non-fraudulent \n27 \n15 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYellowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  absentee ballot collection in Montana; (2) that Montana already has a comprehensive set \n2 \nof statutes that prohibit and criminalize fraudulent voting activities, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-\n3 \n35-101 et seq.; and (3) that while the BIPA suppresses voting, it does nothing to advance \n4 \nthe integrity or security of Montana elections. The State failed to present any evidence that \n5 \nMontana's pre-BIPA statutory scheme for preventing voter fraud would be insufficient to \n6 \n7  deter fraudulent absentee ballot collection practices. To put in perspective the success of \n8  Montana's pre-BIPA statutes prohibiting voter fraud, for the decade from 2006 through \n9 \n2016, there has not been a single case of ballot collection fraud even though voters cast \n10 \n7,079,953 absentee or mail ballots in Montana.23 \n11 \nFor those reasons, the State's reliance on the Morley blog-posting entitled \"Election \n12 \nModifications to Avoid During the Covid-19 Pandemic,\" Lawfare (Apr. 17, 2020), is \n13 \n14  misplaced. Morley warns that elections officials should avoid adopting new election \n15  strategies in response to the Covid-19 epidemic that may create unforeseen problems with \n16 \nelection administration and security. Morley identifies one such strategy as authorizing \n17 \nabsentee ballot collection. Morley advises that \"election officials should reject ... the use of \n18 \nthird-party 'designated persons' - frequently referred to as 'ballot harvesters' -to collect \n19 \nabsentee ballots from voters (except in jurisdictions where state law expressly authorizes \n20 \n21  their use).\" Morley recommends that, \"Ie]lection officials should not expand the use of \n22  third-party ballot harvesting, particularly as a response to the pandemic.\" Morley's \n23 \nconcerns do not support the BIPA. The BIPA was not enacted in response to COVID-19; \n24 \nthe BIPA targets non-fraudulent absentee ballot collection; and Montana has permitted \n25 \n26 \n27 \n23 Affidavit of Dr. Kenneth Mayer \n16 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Memorandum and \nOrder Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nYetfowstone County Cause No. DV 20-408 \n\n1  third-party absentee ballot collection for many years without a single case of fraud being \n2 \nreported. \n3 \nBased upon the above Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Memorandum: \n4 \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n5 \n1.  The Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED; \n6 \n7  2.  The Defendant and his agents, officers, employees, successors, and all \n8  persons acting in concert with each or any of them are IMMEDIATELY restrained and \n9 \nprohibited from enforcing the provisions of the Ballot Interference Prevention Act, Mont. \n10 \nCode Ann.§ 13-35-701 et seq. and the election receipt deadline for absentee ballots set \n11 \nforth in Mont. Code Ann.§ 13-13-201 (3), Mont. Code Ann.§ 13-13-211 (3), and Mont. \n12 \nCode Ann.§ 13-19-106(5)(b) pending resolution of the Plaintiffs' request that the \n13 \n14  Defendant be permanently enjoined from enforcing the statutes cited above; \n15  3.  All absentee ballots postmarked on or before election day shall be counted, \n16 \nif otherwise valid, provided such ballots are received by the deadline for federal write-in \n17 \nballots -for military and overseas voters; and \n18 \n4.  The Court waives the requirement that the Plaintiffs post a security bond for \n19 \nthe payment of costs and damages as pe  itted by Mont. Code Ann.§ 27-19-306(1)(b)(ii). \n20 \n21  DATED this ;;;t!ctay of May, 2  0.  ' \n22 \n23 \n24  cc:  Peter M_ (Mike) Meloy \nMatthew Gordon \nJ. Stuart Segrest, Asst A. G. \n25 \nAislinn W.

Not only do these deadlines impose a \nminimal burden, if any, on voters, but enjoining the Election Day deadline with the \nprimary election imminent will adversely affect the integrity of the election, the \nability of election officials to administer the election without confusion, and the \nState’s right to regulate its elections. \nBecause the primary election is rapidly approaching, the State also asks this \nCourt to immediately issue a stay of the Election Day deadline injunction.1 The \nState does not seek relief as to the portion of the district court’s Order enjoining the \nBallot Interference Protection Act (BIPA). \n \n1 To this end, the State filed a Motion to Stay in district court on Friday at 5pm, \nhours after the court issued its Order. (App’x G). Due to the urgency of the \ninjunction’s effect on Montana elections, the State asks this Court to issue a stay \nwithout waiting for the district court to rule on the motion below.  \n   \n\nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThe requirement that election officials receive mail ballots by 8pm on \nElection Day was first codified in 2009 for mail-ballot elections. Mont. Code Ann. \n§ 13-19-106 (Compiler’s Comments). Before 2009, and dating back to 1985, Mont. \nCode Ann. § 13-19-106 provided ballots must be “received before a specified time \non election day.” Id. In 2011, the Legislature approved House Bill 99, adding the \nElection Day deadline to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201. (App’x G (Miller Decl.), \n¶ 2); see also House State Admin. Hearing at 8:30:52–8:31:50 (Jan. 21, 2011).2 \nThe bill’s purpose was to create uniformity between the mail-ballot and absentee \nstatutory schemes, thereby ensuring fairness and preventing voter and election \nadministrator confusion. House State Admin. Hearing at 8:27:15–32, 8:28:41–45, \n8:30:52–8:31:50, 8:32:04–17, 8:35:40–8:36:16. In 2013, the Legislature added a \nreference to the Election Day deadline in Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211. See \nCompiler’s Comments. \nThe Election Day deadline in House Bill 99 codified Montana election \nadministrators’ long-standing practice. At least as far back as 2001, election \nadministrators uniformly applied the deadline to absentee and mail ballots. \n(App’x G (Miller Decl.) ¶ 3.) Absentee ballots received after 8pm on Election Day, \n \n2 Available at http://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00309/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/ \nPowerBrowserV2/20170221/-1/21810?agendaId=99704 \n2 \n\nother than pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-21-206, were disregarded. Id. This \ndecision was based on Montana’s statutory scheme for elections. Id. ¶ 4.  \nDespite this long-standing history, Respondents did not file their Complaint \nuntil March 13, 2020, or serve the Attorney General until March 18, seven weeks \nbefore absentee ballots became available. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-205(1)(i)–(ii); \nApp’x G (Miller Decl.) ¶ 3. Respondents then delayed filing their motion for a \npreliminary injunction until April 27, 2020, one week before in-person absentee \nvoting began, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-205(i), thirty-five years after the statute \nrequiring mail ballots be received by Election Day took effect, Mont. Code Ann. \n§ 13-19-106, and at least nineteen years after the Election Day deadline became \nstandard practice for mailed absentee ballots (App’x G (Miller Decl.) ¶ 3).  \nIn the meantime, the Governor issued a directive permitting counties to \nconduct all-mail-ballot elections.3 In response, every county in Montana \nimplemented a mail-ballot election. (App’x G (Corson Decl.) ¶ 11.) Yet in their \nComplaint, Respondents only challenged Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201, which \napplies to absentee ballots. (Doc. 1 at 4.) After the State pointed out at least three \nother statutes cite the Election Day deadline (App’x C at 11), Respondents argued \n \n3 Governor Steve Bullock, Directive Implementing Executive Orders 2-20-\n2020 and 3-2020 and providing for measures to implement the 20-2020 June \nprimary election safely (Mar. 25, 2020), available at \nhttps://covid19.mt.gov/Portals/223/Documents/Directive%20on%20Elections.pdf?\nver=2020-03-25-152812-903 \n3 \n\nin a footnote there was “no reason why the Court could not enjoin these provisions \nunder its equitable powers to afford further relief that it deems necessary and \nproper,” and “[i]n the alternative, Plaintiffs would respectfully seek the Court’s \nleave to amend the Complaint to explicitly reference these provisions” (App’x D \nat 8, n. 4). Respondents never amended their Complaint, nor did the Court provide \nleave to amend.  \nThe district court then granted Respondents’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. (App’x F.) Relevant here, the court ordered the State is \n“IMMEDIATELY restrained and prohibited from enforcing . . . the election receipt \ndeadline for absentee ballots set forth in Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201(3), \nMont Code Ann. § 13-13-211(3), and Mont. Code Ann. § 13-19-106(5)(b) pending \nresolution of [Respondents’] request that [the State] be permanently enjoined from \nenforcing” those statutes. Id. at 17. Additionally, the Court ordered: “All absentee \nballots postmarked on or before election day shall be counted, if otherwise valid, \nprovided such ballots are received by the deadline for federal write-in ballots for \nmilitary and overseas voters.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n  For the reasons below, the State requests this Court exercise supervisory \ncontrol over the district court’s order enjoining the enforcement of the Election \nDay deadline in Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-13-201(3), 13-13-211(3), and 13-19-\n4 \n\n106(5)(b), return to the status quo of the Election Day deadline, and allow the State \nto administer an orderly election. \nSUMMARY OF REASONS FOR GRANTING WRIT \n  This Court should exercise supervisory control because the district court’s \ninjunction of the Election Day deadline on the eve of Montana’s primary election \ninvolves constitutional issues of statewide importance, constitutes judicial \ninvolvement in a political question in violation of the separation of powers \ndoctrine, impacts the ability of election officials to properly administer the \nelection, and threatens confusion and inequality among voters. The normal appeals \nprocess is inadequate because the primary election is just one week away. \nARGUMENT \nThe district court’s issuance of a preliminary injunction constitutes a mistake \nof law and involves constitutional issues of statewide importance for which \ndirect appeal is an inadequate remedy.  \n \nA.  Standards  \nSupervisory control is “justified when urgency or emergency factors” render \na direct appeal inadequate, when a case presents purely legal questions, and—\nrelevant here—when one of the following circumstances are present:   \na.  The other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing \na gross injustice; [or] \nb.  Constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved[.] \n \n5 \n\nMont. R. App. P. 14(3). Both circumstances are present because the district court’s \nruling on the constitutionality of the Election Day deadline is legally incorrect and \nharmful with statewide implications. It is crucial that Montana’s electoral system \nnot be disrupted at the last minute, especially considering the unique circumstances \npresented by COVID-19 where all counties have issued mail ballots to all voters. \nHere, the nature of the case and the need for stability satisfy the urgency required \nfor supervisory control.   \nB.  The district court’s ruling is a mistake of law imposed \nstatewide. \nThe district court’s ruling contradicts U.S. Supreme Court precedent and \nimpermissibly decides a political question. The Order will harm election officials, \nwho are now tasked with implementing a brand new law, and deadline, just days \nbefore Election Day, and voters, many of whom have already submitted their \nballots and been informed of the Election Day deadline. The Order also implicates \nconstitutional issues of state-wide importance by functioning as legislation on the \neve of the election, affecting all counties and voters, failing to account for the \nentire statutory scheme, and treating voters unequally.  \n1.  The Order violates the political question doctrine. \nThe political question doctrine precludes courts from hearing \n“controversies . . . which revolve around policy choices and value determinations \nconstitutionally committed for resolution to other branches of government.” \n6 \n\nLarson v. State, 2019 MT 28, ¶ 39, 394 Mont. 167, 434 P.3d 241 (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted). Setting election deadlines is at the heart of a \nstate’s right to regulate elections; and changing them involves a political question. \nSee Bennett v. Yoshina, 140 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 1998) (“The Supreme Court \nhas long held that the structure of a state’s internal democratic processes is a \n‘political question’ beyond the ken of judicial review.”) (citing Baker v. Carr, \n369 U.S. 186, 218-26 (1962)); Larson, ¶ 40 (“Montana has a compelling interest in \nimposing reasonable procedural requirements tailored to ensure the integrity, \nreliability, and fairness of its election processes.”). \nThe Legislature—not the courts—has the prerogative to amend Title 13 of \nthe Montana Code. See Mont. Const. art. IV, § 3 (“The legislature shall provide by \nlaw the requirements for . . . absentee voting, and administration of elections.”).4 \nThis makes sense given the complex intersection of the various election laws. As \ndiscussed above, the Legislature decided voters should be uniformly treated with \nrespect to when their ballots are due. The Election Day deadline also appears \nmultiple times throughout the Montana Code. See Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-13-\n \n4 Recently, another Montana district court declined to “invade the role of \nexecutive or legislative branches” by changing election laws to allow electronic \nsignature collection for ballot initiatives. New Approach Montana v. \nState of Montana, No. XBDV-2020-444, at *7 (Mont. First Jud. Dist., Apr. 30, \n2020) (Larson, J.). \n7 \n\n201(3) (absentee ballots), 13-13-211(3) (absentee ballots), 13-13-246 (mail ballots \nreturned by disabled voters), 13-19-106(5)(b) (mail ballots). \nIn enjoining the Election Day deadline, the district court took on the role of \nthe Legislature in violation of the political question doctrine. The court \naffirmatively created legislation by directing election administrators to accept “[a]ll \nabsentee ballots postmarked on or before election day” and “received by the \ndeadline for federal write-in ballots for military and overseas voters.” (App’x F \nat 17.) The court’s decision to substitute a postmark date as a deadline infringes on \nthe Legislature’s constitutional prerogative to regulate elections. See Mont. Const. \nart. IV, § 3 and art. V, § 1. \n2.  The Order is contrary to U.S. Supreme Court \nprecedent. \nThe Order also directly contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in \nRepublican Nat’l Comm. v. Democratic Nat’l Comm., 140 S. Ct. 1205, 1207 \n(2020) (per curiam). In that case, the court overruled a decision that Wisconsin \nabsentee ballots could be postmarked after Election Day. Id. The Court noted it has \n“repeatedly emphasized” its disfavor of judicial alteration of election rules on the \neve of an election. Id. (citing Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006); Frank v. \nWalker, 574 U.S. 929 (2014); Veasy v. Perry, 574 U.S. 951 (2014)). This is \nbecause “Court orders affecting elections . . . can themselves result in voter \n8 \n\nconfusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls. As an election \ndraws closer, that risk will increase.” Purcell, 549 U.S. at 4–5 (emphasis added). \nThe district court incorrectly concluded Republican Nat’l Committee was \ninapplicable, then granted relief Respondents never requested in their Complaint in \ndirect contravention of the Supreme Court’s decision. Despite Respondents only \nrequesting relief from Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201(3) in their Complaint, the \nCourt also enjoined application of Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211 (absentee ballots) \nand § 13-19-106(5)(c) (mail ballots). This type of judicial interference in elections \nis impermissible. Republican Nat’l Committee, 140 S. Ct. at 1207 (admonishing \ndistrict court for granting relief plaintiffs did not request in preliminary injunction \nmotion).   \n3.  The injunction fundamentally alters the nature of the \nelection. \nThe district court also incorrectly concluded the injunction would not \n“fundamentally alter the nature of the election,” result in voter confusion, or \ndisenfranchise voters. (App’x F at 14.) The court reached this conclusion even \nthough the Election Day deadline is the long-standing status quo in Montana.   \na.  The injunction will hamper election officials’ \nduties.  \nThe injunction’s effect is not limited to the invalidated statutes. Chapter 13 \nof the Montana Code imposes many deadlines on critical election functions, such \n9 \n\nas state canvassing and post-election audits. App’x G (Corson Decl.) ¶ 8; \nMont. Code Ann. §§ 13-15-401 (county canvass board meeting deadline), 13-15-\n502 (state canvass board meeting deadline), 13-17-503 (requiring post-election \naudit after unofficial results are available but before official county canvass). State \nand county election official resources are allocated in a manner that reflects these \ndeadlines and the related critical election functions. (App’x G (Corson Decl.) ¶ 8.) \nFor example, staffing decisions are based on staff’s ability to perform different \nfunctions based on upcoming deadlines. Id. Under the Order, the timing of critical \nelection functions would overlap, creating numerous personnel issues and resource \nconstraints. Id. \nThe Order also does not account for other deadlines in Chapter 13 that \nimpact how election administrators count ballots. For example, it does not address \nMont. Code Ann. § 13-21-206. Sometimes, uniformed and overseas voters submit \nboth a mail-ballot and a federal write-in absentee ballot (FWAB), and Mont. Code \nAnn. § 13-21-206 dictates which ballot to accept. (App’x G (Corson Decl.) ¶ 10.) \nIf no mail ballot is received by 8pm on Election Day, the election administrator \naccepts the FWAB. Id. Under the Order, though, a mail-in ballot could arrive later \nthan 8pm on Election Day, causing confusion as to which ballot should be \naccepted. Id.  \n10 \n\nThe injunction thus fundamentally alters the nature of elections by \nhampering election officials’ duties.  \nb.  The injunction will create confusion and \ninequality among voters. \nNot only will the injunction hamper election officials, it will confuse and \ncreate disparity among voters. First, the district court’s substitution of a postmark \ndate does not necessarily create clarity. In Montana, mail is not always stamped \nwith the postmark date at the location and time it is mailed, and therefore a \npostmark date is not always a reliable indicator of when something was placed in \nthe mail. See App’x C (Keller Decl.) ¶¶ 4, 7. Mail submitted in drop boxes or \nwithout a specific request for a date stamp typically is not stamped until it reaches \na major processing facility. Id. ¶ 4. Thus, for example, if an item is put in a drop \nbox after pickup, it will not be stamped that day. By contrast, current law provides \na clear line by requiring ballots to be received by 8pm on Election Day regardless \nof how they are delivered.  \nMoreover, Montanans have already received their ballots for the upcoming \nprimary election, and these ballots contain instructions about the Election Day \ndeadline. The instructions inform voters in three separate places that ballots must \nbe received by the election office by 8pm on Election Day. (App’x C (Corson \nDecl.) ¶¶ 7, 9) The instructions also emphasize “[a] postmark is not accepted” and \nwarn the Postal Service recommends mail at least one week before the election. Id. \n11 \n\n¶ 10. The Secrecy Ballot Envelope has a similar caution. Id. ¶ 12. The district \ncourt’s order directly contradicts these instructions and ignores that mail-ballot \nvoting has been underway for weeks. As of May 22, when the court issued its \nOrder, 192,276 absentee voters had already turned in ballots. (App’x G (Corson \nDecl.) ¶ 11). That number has only increased since.  \nThe injunction thus creates inequality between voters who have mailed their \nballots in early who might otherwise have waited and those who waited and are \nnow able to submit on Election Day. It also disparately impacts disabled absentee \nvoters who mail their ballots because, under Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-246(2)(c) \nand (d), disabled voters may return a voted ballot by mail provided it is received by \n8pm on Election Day. By not taking these voters into account, the Order treats \ndisabled voters differently from other voters who return their ballots by mail.  \nFinally, the Order creates a conflict with Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-245, \nwhich requires election administrators to notify voters of ballot deficiencies. Under \nMont. Code Ann. § 13-15-107(5), a provisional ballot may only be counted if the \nvoter’s information is verified by 5pm the day after the election or postmarked by \n5pm the day after the election and received by 3pm the sixth day after the election. \nIf a voter does not mail a ballot until 8pm on Election Day, it may not be received \nin time for the election administrator to notify of an issue and allow the voter to \ncorrect it within these time limits. \n12 \n\nThe district court’s order thus threatens voter confusion, disenfranchisement, \nand unequal treatment. \n4.  Respondents failed to meet the standards for a \npreliminary injunction.  \n  The district court also incorrectly concluded Respondents meet the \npreliminary injunction standards. “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to \npreserve the status quo,” and it should only “be granted with caution.” Citizens for \nBalanced Use v. Maurier, 2013 MT 166, ¶ 11, 370 Mont. 410, 303 P.3d 794 \n(citation omitted). “In the context of a constitutional challenge, an applicant . . . \nmust establish a prima facie case of a violation of its rights under the constitution.” \nWeems v. State, 2019 MT 98, ¶ 18, 395 Mont. 350, 440 P.3d 4 (citation omitted). \n“[A] preliminary injunction should not issue absent an accompanying prima facie \nshowing, or showing that it is at least uncertain, that the applicant will suffer \nirreparable injury prior to final resolution on the merits.” Id. (citations omitted). \nMontana Constitution Article II, § 13 protects the right to vote, not the right \nto return a ballot after polls close. Voters do not have the right to submit ballots \nafter Election Day, just like they do not have a right to vote after Election Day. \nVoters may mail their ballots earlier if they wish to ensure timely arrival, submit \ntheir ballots in person, or have someone else submit their ballots. That a voter \nmight wait too long to mail a ballot does not impact the constitutionality of the \nstatute. Thomas v. Andino, No. 3:20-cv-01552-JMC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n13 \n\n90812, at *73 (D.S.C. May 25, 2020) (“South Carolina’s generally applicable \ndeadline for receipt of absentee ballots is constitutional because it imposes only a \nminimal burden, if any, on [the] right to vote.”). At most, the deadline is an \ninconvenience, which alone “does not result in a denial of ‘meaningful access to \nthe political process.’” Jacksonville Coal. for Voter Prot. v. Hood, 351 F. Supp. 2d \n1326, 1335 (M.D. Fla. 2004) (quoting Osburn v. Cox, 369 F.3d 1283, 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2004)). \nMoreover, there was no urgency to this challenge, which came decades after \nthe Legislature created the mail-ballot deadline. Even Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-\n201, the only deadline challenged in the Complaint, was codified more than eight \nyears ago. Respondents’ “long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction \nimplies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.” Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. \nChronicle Publ’g Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985); see also Garcia v. \nGoogle, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 746 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (months-long delay in \nseeking injunction undercut claim of irreparable harm). Respondents’ use of \nCOVID-19 to excuse this delay is unavailing; given that every county in Montana \nhas implemented a mail-ballot election, the Election Day deadline is more \nimportant now than ever to a timely, organized election. \nBecause Respondents failed to show a prima facie constitutional violation, \nthe injunction should be reversed.    \n14 \n\n5.  The district court incorrectly applied strict scrutiny. \nThe district court applied the wrong test—strict scrutiny—to these \nfundamental election laws. “[T]o subject every voting regulation to strict \nscrutiny . . . would tie the hands of States seeking to assure that elections are \noperated equitably and efficiently.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992). \nInstead, when analyzing state election laws, courts should balance the severity of \nthe law’s burden against the state’s interests, considering the “extent to which \nthose interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id. at 434 \n(citation omitted). Under this test, courts typically will uphold laws imposing lesser \nburdens based on the State’s regulatory interests. See Arizona Libertarian Party v. \nReagan, 798 F.3d 723, 730 (9th Cir. 2015).  \nAlthough this Court generally applies strict scrutiny to laws impacting \nfundamental rights, it cites federal cases for its strict scrutiny standard and should \nfollow the federal balancing test when considering election laws. Wadsworth v. \nState, 275 Mont. 287, 911 P.2d 1165, 1174 (1996) (citation omitted). A balancing \ntest is appropriate because “[e]lection laws will invariably impose some burden \nupon individual voters.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 433. Montana has the right to \nregulate elections without each regulation being subject to strict scrutiny. \nMont. Const. art. IV, § 3.  \n15 \n\nMontana “indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity \nof its election process” because “[c]onfidence in the integrity of [the] processes is \nessential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.” Purcell, 549 U.S. at 4; \nsee also Crawford v. Marion Cnty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, 197 (2008) \n(“[P]ublic confidence in the integrity of the electoral process has independent \nsignificance, because it encourages citizen participation in the democratic \nprocess.”). The Order undermines election integrity and instead threatens \nconfusion among voters and election officials, disrupts the statutory scheme, and \ndisenfranchises certain voters. \nMontana also has an interest in providing timely results, which is furthered \nby the deadline. See Thomas, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90812 (upholding South \nCarolina’s absentee ballot deadline of 7pm on Election Day); Friedman v. Snipes, \n345 F. Supp. 2d 1356, 1377 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (“[T]he State’s interests in ensuring a \nfair and honest election and to count votes within a reasonable time justifies the \nlight imposition on Plaintiffs’ right to vote.”). This is reflected throughout Title 13. \nFor example, election judges must provide results to election administrators \n“immediately” after ballots are counted, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-15-101; the vote \ncount must begin “immediately upon the closure of the polls,” § 13-15-207; and \nthe canvass board must meet no later than 14 days after an election to canvass the \nvote, § 13-15-401. Montana’s election scheme thus is focused on the state’s \n16 \n\ninterest in beginning the vote count as soon as the polls close. To that end, the \nSecretary of State live-casts election results online.5  \nThe Election Day deadline also provides equal treatment with in-person \nvoters. Montanans voting in person at the polls must return their ballots by 8pm (or \nat least, be in line by 8pm), Mont. Code Ann. § 13-1-106, and the deadline ensures \nabsentee voters return their ballots by 8pm (whether by mail or in person). \nConsequently, these otherwise similarly situated voters are treated equally.  \nFinally, the district court erred by combining the State’s interests in BIPA \nand the Election Day deadline. Respondents alleged BIPA and the deadline “work \nin concert” to violate their rights. But the Court failed to separately analyze the \nElection Day deadline. Considered by itself, the State’s interests in setting uniform \ndeadlines outweighs any minimal burden, especially with BIPA enjoined. See \nCrawford, 553 U.S. at 197; Thomas, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90812 at *73. Further, \nthe injunction interferes with the State’s interest in providing results in an \nexpedient manner and may impact other important deadlines.  \nBecause the court applied the wrong scrutiny standard, this Court should \nreverse the injunction.  \n \n \n \n5 See https://sosmt.gov/elections/results/. \n17 \n\nC.  Direct appeal constitutes an inadequate remedy in this case. \nDue to the immediacy of the primary election, direct appeal does not \nadequately remedy the district court’s ruling enjoining the Election Day deadline. \nElection officials are working to ensure the election proceeds smoothly, but the \nOrder throws the system into chaos. Especially given the conflict with numerous \nelection statutes, election officials would have to guess how to proceed without \nimmediate direction by this Court.  \nWhile a preliminary injunction is immediately appealable, Mont. R. App. P. \n6(3)(3), the State has filed both a notice of appeal and this writ of supervisory \ncontrol to obtain immediate relief. If the Court determines a writ is inappropriate, \nthe State requests it issue a stay of the injunction and expedite the appeal process. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court’s exercise of supervisory control is both justified and warranted. \nDue to the threat to the State’s election authority and ability to provide an ordered \nelection, immediate relief is needed.  \nRespectfully submitted this 26th day of May, 2020. \nTIMOTHY C.

Code Ann. § 13-35-701 et seq., and the Election Day deadline set \nforth in Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201 are unconstitutional. (Doc. 1 at 3–4, 31.)  \n  Appellees then moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the \nState from enforcing BIPA and the Election Day deadline. (Docs. 4–16.) In their \nsupporting brief, Appellees referred to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211, which \nreferences the Election Day deadline, as well as Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201. \n(Doc. 5 at 3, 8.) In its response, the State noted Appellees could not use their brief \nto bypass pleading requirements and expand the scope of the suit. (Doc. 20 at 11, \nn.10.) The State also pointed out that a third statute—Mont. Code Ann. \n   \n\n§ 13-19-106—imposes the Election Day deadline on mail ballots. Id. at 11. \nAppellees responded that the court could enjoin these additional provisions \n“under its equitable powers to afford further relief that it deems necessary and \nproper” or, alternatively, that they “would respectfully seek the Court’s leave to \namend the complaint to explicitly reference these provisions.” (Doc. 21 at 8, n.4.) \nAppellees then waited until June 12, 2020, to move to amend their complaint, \nwell  after their preliminary injunction motion was fully briefed, ruled on, and \nappealed to this Court. (Doc. 40.) \n  On May 22, 2020, the district court granted the preliminary injunction \nmotion. (Doc. 25.) The court concluded Appellees had demonstrated “irreparable \nharm per se by presenting a prima facie case” that BIPA and the Election Day \ndeadline “violate Montanans’ constitutional right to vote.” Id. at 14. It “reserve[d] \nruling upon whether these statutes also violate additional constitutional rights” as \nAppellees alleged. Id. at 13. The court ordered that the State is: \nIMMEDIATELY restrained and prohibited from enforcing the \nprovisions of [BIPA], Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-701 et seq. and the \nelection receipt deadline for absentee ballots set forth in Mont. Code \nAnn. § 13-13-201(3), Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211(3), and \nMont. Code Ann. § 13-19-106(5)(b) pending resolution of \n[Appellees’] request that the [State] be permanently enjoined from \nenforcing the statutes cited above. \n \nId. at 17. Additionally, the court ordered: “All absentee ballots postmarked on or \nbefore election day shall be counted, if otherwise valid, provided such ballots are \n2 \n\nreceived by the deadline for federal write-in ballots for military and overseas \nvoters.” Id. (emphasis added). \nThe State filed a petition for writ of supervisory control and, alternatively, \nasked this Court to immediately stay the order enjoining the Election Day \ndeadline and set an expedited briefing schedule for the appeal. (Pet’n for Writ of \nSupervisory Control, OP 20-0293 (May 26, 2020).) The State did not seek a stay \nof the district court’s preliminary injunction of BIPA. Id. On May 27, 2020, this \nCourt stayed the district court’s order enjoining the Election Day deadline, \ndenied the State’s petition for writ of supervisory control, and set an \nexpedited briefing schedule for the appeal. (Or., OP 20-0293 (May 27, 2020).) \nOn June 3, 2020, the State notified the Court that it would appeal the \ndistrict court’s preliminary injunction of BIPA as well as the Election Day \ndeadline. (Am. Notice of Appeal, DA 20-0295 (June 3, 2020).)  \nSTATEMENT OF THE FACTS \nA. Election Day Deadline \nThe requirement that election officials receive mail ballots by 8pm on \nElection Day was first codified in 2009. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-19-106 (2009). \nBut long before 2009, dating back to 1985, the statute provided that mail ballots \nmust be “received before a specified time on election day.” Mont. Code Ann. \n§ 13-19-106 (1985) (emphasis added).  \n3 \n\nIn 2011, the Legislature approved House Bill (HB) 99, adding the \nElection Day deadline to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201. (Doc. 30, ¶ 2); see also \nHouse State Admin. Hearing at 8:30:52–8:31:50 (Jan. 21, 2011).1 The bill’s \npurpose was to create uniformity between the mail-ballot and absentee statutory \nschemes, thereby ensuring fairness and preventing voter and election administrator \nconfusion. House State Admin. Hearing at 8:27:15–32, 8:28:41–45, \n8:30:52–8:31:50, 8:32:04–17, 8:35:40–8:36:16. In 2013, the Legislature added a \nreference to the Election Day deadline to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211 (2013). \nThe Election Day deadline in HB 99 codified Montana election \nadministrators’ long-standing practice. At least as far back as 2001, election \nadministrators uniformly applied the deadline to absentee and mail ballots. \n(Doc. 30, ¶ 3.) Any absentee ballots received after 8pm on Election Day, other than \nthose received pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-21-206, were disregarded. Id. \nThis practice was based on Montana’s statutory scheme for elections. Id. ¶ 4.  \nB. BIPA \nBIPA provides that “a person may not knowingly collect a voter’s voted or \nunvoted ballot” unless he or she is “(a) an election official; (b) a United States \npostal service worker or other individual specifically authorized by law to transmit \n \n1 Available at http://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00309/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/ \nPowerBrowserV2/20170221/-1/21810?agendaId=99704. \n4 \n\nUnited States mail; (c) a caregiver; (d) a family member; (e) a household member; \nor (f) an acquaintance.” Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-703. The latter four categories \nof persons may collect only six ballots. Id. Ballot collectors must “sign a registry \nwhen delivering the ballot to the polling place, a place of deposit, or the election \nadministrator’s office.” Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-704.  \nBIPA was introduced as Senate Bill (SB) 352 during the 2017 Legislative \nSession. (Doc. 16, Ex. 1.) SB 352 proposed a legislative referendum in the \n2018 election to prohibit unsolicited ballot collection, with exceptions for \npersons known to the voter. The bill sponsor testified that ballot collection in \nMontana had raised “concern by many people across the state.” Id. at 2:23–24.

I was alone and by myself and there was two people at \nmy door. Or I gave it to him. They seemed so nice.

Comm’r of Political Practices for Mont. v. Wittich, \n2017 MT 210, ¶¶ 14, 71, 388 Mont. 347, 400 P.3d 735 (citations omitted). The \napplicable level of judicial scrutiny likewise is a legal question reviewed for \ncorrectness. See Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. 287, ___, 911 P.2d 1165, 1170 \n(1996); see also MCIA I, ¶ 35 (reversing preliminary injunction because district \ncourt incorrectly applied strict scrutiny).   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  The district court indiscriminately applied strict scrutiny to enjoin \nenforcement of Montana’s election laws. Instead, the court should have applied the \nmore flexible balancing test used by federal courts, weighing the character and \nmagnitude of the asserted constitutional burden against the interests advanced by \nthe State as justifications for the burden imposed by the challenged laws. \nBurdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433 (1992) (citation omitted).  \n  Applying this test, any burden the Election Day deadline and BIPA impose \non Appellees’ rights is minimal at most, and the State’s interests in maintaining \nelection uniformity, preventing fraud, and ensuring voter confidence in the \n7 \n\nelectoral system justify the burden. Because the district court applied the wrong \nstandard of scrutiny, and because Appellees failed to demonstrate a prima facie \ncase that these election regulations are overly burdensome under the proper \nbalancing test, this Court should reverse the preliminary injunction.  \nARGUMENT \nI.   The district court incorrectly applied strict scrutiny to enjoin \nenforcement of Montana’s election laws, which threatens to \nhamstring the State’s ability to regulate elections. \nCourts should not automatically default to strict scrutiny when assessing \nelection laws. While voting undoubtedly “‘is of the most fundamental significance \nunder our constitutional structure,’ . . . [i]t does not follow . . . that the right to vote \nin any manner and the right to associate for political purposes through the ballot \nare absolute.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 433 (holding prohibition on write-in voting, \ntaken as part of state’s comprehensive election scheme, did not impermissibly \nburden right to vote) (quoting Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, \n440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979)) (emphasis added). \nBoth the United States and Montana constitutions not only place the power \nto regulate elections squarely with the Legislature, they require the Legislature to \nregulate elections. U.S. Const. art. I, § 4 (“The times, places and manner of holding \nelections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the \nlegislature thereof.”); Mont. Const. art. IV, § 3 (“The legislature shall provide by \n8 \n\nlaw the requirements for residence, registration, absentee voting, and \nadministration of elections . . .  and shall insure the purity of elections and guard \nagainst abuses of the electoral process.”) (emphasis added). And the U.S. Supreme \nCourt unequivocally has determined that states have “the power to regulate their \nown elections.” Burdick, 504 U.S. at 433 (citation omitted).  \nState governments “must play an active role in structuring elections; ‘as a \npractical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be \nfair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the \ndemocratic processes.’” Id. (quoting Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974)). \n“Election laws will invariably impose some burden on voters” because each \nprovision of an election code “inevitably affects—at least to some degree—the \nindividual’s right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.” \nId. (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983)). Thus, “to subject \nevery voting regulation to strict scrutiny and to require that the regulation be \nnarrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest . . . would tie the hands of \nStates seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently.” Id.  \nInstead, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a balancing test whereby, in \n“considering a challenge to a state election law,” courts “must weigh the character \nand magnitude of the asserted injury to” a plaintiff’s constitutional rights “against \nthe precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden \n9 \n\nimposed by its rule, taking into consideration the extent to which those interests \nmake it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.” Id. at 434 (quoting Anderson, \n460 U.S. at 789, Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 U.S. 208,  \n213–214 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this “more flexible” \nstandard, the rigorousness of a court’s “inquiry into the propriety of a state election \nlaw depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens” the \nplaintiff’s constitutional rights. Id.  \nWhen the right to vote is “subjected to ‘severe’ restrictions, the election \nregulation must be ‘narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling \nimportance.’” Id. (quoting Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992)). However, \n“when a state election law provision imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory \nrestrictions upon” the constitutional rights of voters, “the State’s important \nregulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.” Id. (quoting \nAnderson, 460 U.S. at 788) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this latter \nlevel of review, “[i]f any doubt exists” as to the constitutionality of a statute, “it \nmust be resolved in favor of the statute.” Mont. Cannabis Indus. Ass’n v. State \n(MCIA II), 2016 MT 44, ¶ 12, 382 Mont. 256, 368 P.3d 1131. \nAlthough this Court has not specifically applied the federal balancing test, it \nhistorically has followed federal caselaw in analyzing the constitutional impacts of \nelection laws. See Finke v. State ex rel. McGrath, 2003 MT 48, ¶¶ 15–18, \n10 \n\n314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576 (citing Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S. \n621, 626–27 (1969)); Johnson v. Killingsworth, 271 Mont. 1, 894 P.2d 272, \n274–75 (1995) (applying rational basis review to affirm Mont. Code Ann. § 85-7-\n1501) (citing Ball v. James, 451 U.S. 355 (1981)). This Court also cites federal \ncases for its strict scrutiny standard. E.g., Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. 287, \n911 P.2d 1165, 1174 (1996) (citing Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 635 \n(1969)). And finally, this Court has followed well-established constitutional \ntests articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in other contexts. See MCIA II, ¶ 67 \n(holding that the district court erred by applying strict scrutiny to a commercial \nspeech prohibition, rather than the test employed by the U.S. Supreme Court); \nCarmichael v. Workers’ Compensation Court, 234 Mont. 410, 414, 763 P.2d 1122, \n1124 (1988) (“In analyzing a contract clause challenge, this Court has often \nimplemented a three-tiered analysis set forth by the United States \nSupreme Court.”). \nNotably, the federal balancing test—and not strict scrutiny—is the standard \nAppellees cited in their complaint. (Doc. 1, ¶ 64.) As the complaint notes, “Other \nstate courts and the federal courts have applied a balancing test to restrictions on \nthe right to vote challenged under analogous provisions of state and federal \nconstitutions that protect the fundamental right to vote.” Id. (citing Burdick; \nNorman; Guare v. State, 167 N.H. 658, 667 (2015)); see also Chelsea Collab., \n11 \n\nInc. v. Sec. Commonwealth, 480 Mass. 27, 33-34, 40 (2018) (applying rational \nbasis review to voter registration law after conducting balancing test). Just as this \nCourt has turned to the federal courts for guidance in the past, it should do so now.  \nA balancing test is appropriate, indeed necessary, in the context of election \nregulation since “all election regulations[] have an impact on the right to vote.” \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434. Montana has the right and duty to regulate elections \nwithout each regulation being subject to strict scrutiny. Mont. Const. art. IV, § 3. \nThe Montana Legislature “indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the \nintegrity of its election process” because “[c]onfidence in the integrity of [the] \nprocesses is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy.” Purcell v. \nGonzalez, 549 U.S. 1, 4 (2006); see also Crawford v. Marion Cnty. Election Bd., \n553 U.S. 181, 197 (2008) (“[P]ublic confidence in the integrity of the electoral \nprocess has independent significance, because it encourages citizen participation in \nthe democratic process.”).  \nThe Legislature promotes the integrity of elections by substantially \nregulating them to ensure “they are . . . fair and honest and [that] some sort of \norder, rather than chaos, [accompanies] the democratic processes.” Burdick, 504 \nU.S. at 433. The end result is that, while citizens have a fundamental right to vote, \nthat right to vote does not encompass voting in a particular manner. Id. \nAnalogously, this Court has determined that the Legislature may circumscribe \n12 \n\nother fundamental rights under its police power, subject to rational basis review. \nSee MCIA I, ¶¶ 20, 22 (holding “although individuals have a fundamental right to \npursue employment, they do not have a fundamental right to pursue a particular \nemployment or employment free of state regulation,” and “the Constitution is clear \nthat the right to seek health is circumscribed by the State’s police power to protect \nthe public’s health and welfare”). \nThus, as explained by the U.S. Supreme Court, applying strict scrutiny as a \ndefault to election laws is inappropriate. Rather, the proper standard of review \nshould be determined based on the balancing test. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 433. This is \nespecially important given Montana’s constitutional mandate directing that the \nLegislature—not the courts—enact laws controlling elections. Larson v. State, \n2019 MT 28, ¶ 39, 394 Mont. 167, 434 P.3d 241 (noting that the political question \ndoctrine precludes courts from hearing “controversies . . . which revolve around \npolicy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution \nto other branches of government”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nUnder the district court’s rationale, however, every election law would be subject \nto strict scrutiny, a result that will unduly interfere with the State’s ability to \nregulate elections. Therefore, this Court should overturn the district court’s default \napplication of strict scrutiny to Montana’s election regulations and reverse the \npreliminary injunction.  \n13 \n\nII.   The district court incorrectly enjoined the Election Day deadline \nwithout properly balancing the State’s interests in setting \ndeadlines to facilitate an orderly election.  \n  Applying the balancing test to the Election Day deadline, the State’s \ncompelling interests in ensuring a fair and honest election, counting votes within a \nreasonable time, and maintaining uniformity in election laws justify the slight \nburden, if any, on the right to vote. \nA.  The district court erred by not considering the merits of the \nElection Day deadline apart from BIPA. \n  The Election Day deadline, a significantly older and more entrenched facet \nof Montana election law, should be considered on its own merits, not as an \nappendage of BIPA. To do otherwise violates the balancing test and the State’s \ninherent right to regulate elections. The district court erred by conflating the two \nprovisions when undertaking its analysis in the preliminary injunction order. (See \nDoc. 25 at 7–8, 12.) While the district court made some separate findings as to the \nElection Day deadline, Doc. 25 at 9, its analysis was lacking and, in any case, did \nnot apply the appropriate balancing test. The District Court incorrectly enjoined \nboth laws based on its analysis of their joint affects, applying strict scrutiny; it did \nnot sufficiently assess the merits of the Election Day deadline independently from \nBIPA, even though it also enjoined BIPA. \n  When analyzed on its own merits, the Election Day deadline at most \nimposes an inconvenience, which “does not result in a denial of ‘meaningful access \n14 \n\nto the political process.’” Jacksonville Coal. for Voter Prot. v. Hood, 351 F. Supp. \n2d 1326, 1335 (M.D. Fla. 2004) (quoting Osburn v. Cox, 369 F.3d 1283, 1289 \n(11th Cir. 2004)). Voters whose ballots are not received until after the polls close \non Election Day are no more disenfranchised than voters who wish to vote in \nperson after the polls close Election Day. And absentee voters who wait until \nElection Day to vote have other options for submitting their ballots (namely \nsubmitting in person or having another do so). The Election Day deadline thus \neasily passes muster under the balancing test, as described below. \nB.   The burden on Appellees’ right to vote is minimal. \nArticle II, section 13 of the Montana Constitution provides: “All elections \nshall be free and open, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to \nprevent the free exercise of the right to suffrage.” This provision protects an \nindividual’s right to vote, not the right to turn his or her ballot in after the polls \nhave closed. See State ex rel. Cashmore v. Anderson, 160 Mont. 175, 190, \n500 P.2d 921, 929 (1972) (“The word ‘voting’ means the affirmative act of \nmarking one’s ballot properly and depositing it in the ballot box in conformity with \nthe election laws.”) (citations omitted). Just as voters do not have the right to vote \nafter Election Day, they do not have the right to submit ballots after Election Day. \nMoreover, the Election Day deadline is not based on race or any other protected \nclass, and nothing in its legislative history suggests a discriminatory purpose.  \n15 \n\nThe Election Day deadline does not disenfranchise Montana voters who \nchoose to vote by mail; it does the opposite. All Montana voters—whether voting \nby mail or in-person—must ensure their ballots are received, or they are in line, by \n8pm on Election Day to be counted. In this way, the Election Day deadline treats \nall Montana voters the same. And absentee voters to some degree have more \nopportunity than in-person voters to register their vote, not less. They receive \nadditional time with their ballots, which they may mail early to ensure timely \narrival, submit in-person early or on Election Day, or have someone else submit. \nIn-person voters, by contrast, may only vote at the polls.  \nThat a voter might wait too long to mail a ballot does not impact the \nconstitutionality of the statute. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 438 (“Reasonable regulation of \nelections [requires voters] to act in a timely fashion if they wish to express their \nviews in the voting booth.”); Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 758 (1973) \n(upholding constitutionality of voter registration deadline and noting, if petitioners’ \n“plight can be characterized as disenfranchisement at all, it was not caused by [the \nchallenged statute], but by their own failure to take timely steps to effect their \nenrollment”); Thomas v. Andino, No. 3:20-cv-01552-JMC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n90812, at *74 (D.S.C. May 25, 2020) (“South Carolina’s generally applicable \ndeadline for receipt of absentee ballots [by 7pm on election day] is constitutional \nbecause it imposes only a minimal burden, if any, on [the] right to vote.”). \n16 \n\nSimilarly, the postal service’s independent decisions with respect to mail routes \nand when and how mail is processed—decisions the State does not control—are \nnot attributable to the State and thus should not be factored into the balancing test. \nAppellees’ unsubstantiated allegations of voter confusion and \nmisunderstanding likewise do not render the Election Day deadline \nunconstitutional. The deadline has been codified in its present form for more than \neight years and existed in practice for decades prior. (Doc. 30, ¶ 3). In past \nelections, each absentee ballot informed voters of the deadline. (Doc. 20, Corson \nDecl. ¶¶ 7, 9).) For example, instructions for the June 2, 2020 primary election \nstated in three separate places that ballots must be received by the election office \nby 8pm on Election Day. Id. ¶ 9. The instructions also emphasized “[a] postmark is \nnot accepted” and warned that the Postal Service recommends mailing a ballot at \nleast one week before the election. Id. ¶ 10. The Secrecy Ballot Envelope \ncontained a similar caution. Id. ¶ 12.  \nAppellees presented no first-hand testimony of voter confusion regarding \nwhen a ballot must be returned; instead, their allegations were based on hearsay \nnot made positively in the record. (Docs. 6–16.) Even if they had presented direct \ntestimony of confusion, a voter’s failure to read instructions does not render the \nElection Day deadline unconstitutional. See Matter of Moody v. N.Y. State Bd. of \nElections, 165 A.D.3d 479, 481 (N.Y. App. Div. 2018) (Slip Op.) (“Viewed as a \n17 \n\nwhole, the Election Law gives persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what \nthey must do to meet the primary enrollment deadline, and likewise provides \nofficials with clear standards for enforcement.”) (citation omitted). Tellingly, of the \n417,279 absentee ballots mailed in the 2018 general election, just 372 arrived too \nlate to be counted. (Doc. 20, Corson Decl. ¶ 14.) Appellees’ general allegations of \nvoter confusion as to this deadline, if accepted as sufficient, also bring into \nquestion the absentee ballot application deadline, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211, \nvoter registration deadlines, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-2-301, and many other \ndeadlines scattered throughout Montana’s election laws.  \nIndeed, voter confusion, if any, was created not by the Election Day \ndeadline, but by the district court’s decision to change the status quo less than two \nweeks before Election Day. The U.S. Supreme Court has “repeatedly emphasized” \nits disfavor of judicial alteration of election rules on the eve of an election. \nRep. Nat’l Comm. v. Dem. Nat’l Comm., 206 L. Ed. 2d 452, 453–54 (2020) \n(per curiam) (citing Purcell, 549 U.S. 1; Frank v. Walker, 574 U.S. 929 (2014); \nVeasy v. Perry, 574 U.S. 951 (2014)). “Court orders affecting elections . . . can \nthemselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from \nthe polls. As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.” Purcell, 549 U.S. \nat 4–5. \n18 \n\nAnd the district court’s order risks further voter confusion and \ndisenfranchisement going forward because mail in Montana does not always get \nstamped with the postmark date at the location and time it is mailed. (Doc. 20, \nKeller Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7); see also National Conference of State Legislatures, VOPP: \nTable 11: Receipt and Postmark Deadlines for Absentee Ballots (VOPP Report) \n(June 15, 2020) (noting “less mail gets truly postmarked” than in the past).2 \nAlthough a voter may request an item of mail be stamped when he or she drops it \noff at a post office in person, mail submitted in drop boxes or without this specific \nrequest typically is not postmarked until it reaches a major processing facility. \n(Doc. 20, Keller Decl. ¶ 4.) Therefore, a postmark date does not reliably indicate \nwhen a ballot was placed in the mail. For example, if an item is put in a postal \nservice drop box after pickup, it will not be stamped that day. By contrast, the \nabsentee ballot receipt deadline provides a clear, bright line by requiring ballots to \nbe received by 8pm on Election Day regardless of how they are delivered. \nIn addition to the lack of any evidence of a burden, Appellees’ “long delay \nbefore seeking a preliminary injunction implies a lack of urgency and irreparable \nharm.” Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. Chronicle Publ’g Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 \n(9th Cir. 1985); see also Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 746 (9th Cir. 2015) \n \n2 Available at https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-\ntable-11-receipt-and-postmark-deadlines-for-absentee-ballots.aspx. \n19 \n\n(en banc) (months-long delay in seeking injunction undercut claim of irreparable \nharm). This is especially true given the lack of urgency to Appellees’ challenge, \nwhich came decades after the Legislature created the mail-ballot deadline. Even \nMont. Code Ann. § 13-13-201, the only deadline challenged in the complaint, was \ncodified more than eight years ago.  \nThe district court thus incorrectly concluded that Appellees had \ndemonstrated a prima facie constitutional violation of their right to vote. Appellees \ndo not have a right to ballot collection or to return ballots after Election Day. Their \nargument essentially comes down to an assertion that some small number of \nadditional votes may be recorded if the Election Deadline were changed to a \npostmark deadline (and never mind the confusion over whether a ballot is \npostmarked the day it is mailed). At most, any burden on the right to vote is \nminimal and easily outweighed by the State’s important interests in setting clear \nelection deadlines as outlined below. \nC.   The State’s interests in the Election Day deadline outweigh \nany burden on the right to vote. \nSetting election deadlines is at the heart of a state’s right to regulate \nelections. See Rosario, 410 U.S. at 758 (upholding constitutionality of voter \nregistration deadline); Mays v. LaRose, 951 F.3d 775 (6th Cir. 2020) (holding \nOhio’s deadline for requesting absentee ballots did not violate voting rights of \narrestees who expected to be confined through election). Indeed, for there to be an \n20 \n\nelection at all, a state must set election deadlines, and changing them typically \ninvokes a nonjusticiable political question. See Bennett v. Yoshina, 140 F.3d 1218, \n1225 (9th Cir. 1998) (“The Supreme Court has long held that the structure of a \nstate’s internal democratic processes is a ‘political question’ beyond the ken of \njudicial review.”) (citing Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 218-26 (1962)); \nLarson, ¶ 40 (“Montana has a compelling interest in imposing reasonable \nprocedural requirements tailored to ensure the integrity, reliability, and fairness of \nits election processes.”). \nMontana also “indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the \nintegrity of its election process.” Purcell, 549 U.S. at 4 (citation omitted). This is \nbecause “[c]onfidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the \nfunctioning of our participatory democracy.” Id. Likewise, the Legislature has \nclearly expressed its interest in maintaining uniformity in Montana’s election code. \nSee Mont. Code Ann. § 13-1-201 (requiring the Secretary of State to “maintain \nuniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of the election laws”).   \nMontana’s Election Day deadline serves these interests by ensuring timely \nand accurate results, a key aspect of promoting public faith in elections. See \nThomas, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90812 (upholding South Carolina’s absentee \nballot deadline of 7pm on Election Day); Friedman v. Snipes, 345 F. Supp. 2d \n1356, 1377 (S.D. Fla. 2004) (holding “the State’s interests in ensuring a fair and \n21 \n\nhonest election and to count votes within a reasonable time justifies the light \nimposition on Plaintiffs’ right to vote” imposed by Florida’s ballot receipt deadline \nof 7pm on Election Day); Fritszche v. Maryland State Bd. of Elections, 916 A.2d \n1015 (Md. 2007) (upholding election regulation requiring absentee ballots to be \nmailed by the day before the election); In re Ocean Cnty. Com’r of Registration for \na Recheck of the Voting Machs., 879 A.2d 1174, 1179 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. \n2005) (holding Election Day deadline for absentee ballot receipt—as opposed to \npostmark date—served state interests of deterring fraud, maintaining integrity of \nelection process, and providing reasonably prompt determination of election \nresults). And Montana is not alone: as the National Conference of State \nLegislatures noted just last week, “[t]he most common state deadline for election \nofficials to receive absentee or mail ballots is on Election Day when the polls \nclose.” VOPP Report. \nMontana’s desire to maintain timeliness in elections is reflected \nthroughout Title 13. For example, election judges must provide results to the \nelection administrator “immediately” after ballots are counted, Mont. Code Ann. \n§ 13-15-101; the vote count must begin “immediately upon the closure of the \npolls,” Mont. Code Ann. § 13-15-207; and the canvass board must meet no later \nthan 14 days after an election to canvass the vote, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-15-401. \nThe entire statutory scheme behind Montana elections is focused on a series \n22 \n\nof deadlines ensuring orderly voting and that vote counts begin as soon as the \npolls close.  \nAs discussed above, the Election Day deadline also advances the State’s \ninterests in ensuring uniform and equal treatment with in-person voters. Montana \ndoes not require special circumstances to vote absentee, and thus there is no reason \nabsentee voters should receive preferential treatment over in-person voters. \nMontanans voting in person at the polls must return their ballots by 8pm, or at least \nbe in line to vote by 8pm. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-1-106. Likewise, absentee \nvoters—who already have extra time to fill out their ballots—must return their \nballots by 8pm (whether by mail or in person) or be in line to return them. \nConsequently, these otherwise similarly situated voters are treated equally.   \nAdditionally, the Election Day deadline is key to maintaining uniformity in \nMontana’s election code. Because other election laws interface with the \nElection Day deadline, Appellees have repeatedly revised their argument to include \nan ever-increasing number of constitutional challenges to Montana statutes. See \nDoc. 1 at 4 (challenging, in complaint, only § 13-13-201 (absentee ballots)); Doc. 5 \nat 3, 8 (challenging, in preliminary injunction motion, § 13-13-201 and 13-13-211 \n(absentee ballots)); Doc. 21 at 8, n.4 (challenging, in reply to preliminary \ninjunction motion, §§ 13-13-201, 13-13-211, and 13-19-106 (mail ballots)); \nDoc. 31 at 12 (challenging, in response to motion to stay, §§ 13-13-201, \n23 \n\n13-13-211, 13-19-106, and 13-13-246 (mail ballots returned by disabled voters)). \nAppellees’ attempt to pull on not just one—but multiple and increasing—strings of \nTitle 13 risks causing the whole statutory scheme to unravel. This is precisely why \nelection regulation is the purview of the Legislature, not the courts.  \nIn concluding that a postmark date is a required alternative to the \nElection Day deadline, the district court hijacked the Legislature’s constitutional \nduty to make law and regulate elections. See Mont. Const. art. IV, § 3 and art. V, \n§ 1. The court’s decision that absentee ballots should be counted “provided such \nballots are received by the deadline for federal write-in ballots for military and \noverseas voters” ignores the Legislature’s recognition of these voters’ special \ncircumstances, adoption of laws specific to those circumstances, and incorporation \nof federal law under Montana’s Absent Uniformed Services and Overseas Voter \nAct; by contrast, special circumstances are not required to request an absentee \nballot. Compare Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-21-102–228 (incorporating \nUniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), 52 U.S.C. \n§§ 20301–20311), 13-21-102 (applying only to uniformed-service and overseas \nvoters and their dependents), 13-21-222 (providing for federal postcard \napplications and federal write-in absentee ballots), and Compilers Comments: \nPreamble to Mont. Code Ann. § 13-21-104 (recognizing, based on federal \nguidance, overseas and military voters may provide digital signatures available \n24 \n\nwith U.S. Department of Defense identification cards and adopting state law to \nimplement UOCAVA’s allowance of facsimile ballots), with Mont. Code Ann. § \n13-13-201 (requiring no special circumstances to vote by absentee ballot).  \nAnd federal overseas ballots represent just a tiny fraction of the absentee \nballots returned. For example, in the 2016 general election, just 4,260—less than \n1.3%—of the 337,926 absentee ballots returned by Montana voters were federal \nabsentee ballots.3 Changing the deadline for all absentee ballots to match the \ndeadline for federal overseas ballots not only bypasses the legislative process, it \nignores the disproportionate burden this would place on government resources and \nthe impact it would have on Montana’s election code.  \nFurthermore, the district court’s decision directly contravenes the State’s \ninterest in maintaining uniformity in the election code by not accounting for other \ndeadlines in Chapter 13 that impact how election administrators count ballots. \n(Doc. 29, ¶¶ 7–8) (citing Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-15-401 (county canvass board \nmeeting deadline), 13-15-502 (state canvass board meeting deadline), 13-17-503 \n(requiring post-election audit after unofficial results are available but before \nofficial county canvass)). It ignores that state and county election official resources \nare allocated in a manner that reflects the various deadlines in Title 13 and the \n \n3 2016 Election Administration Voting Survey Data Brief, available at \nhttps://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/Montana_-_EAVS_ \n2016_Data_Brief_-_508.pdf. \n25 \n\nrelated critical election functions. (Doc. 29, ¶ 8.) For example, staffing decisions \nare based on staff’s ability to perform different functions based on upcoming \ndeadlines. Id. Under the district court’s order, however, the timing of critical \nelection functions would overlap, creating numerous personnel issues and resource \nconstraints. Id. Whether this tradeoff is worthwhile is exactly the kind of \nline-drawing policy decision reserved to state legislatures in the election law \ncontext. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434; MCIA II, ¶ 39 (holding it is “beyond [a court’s] \npurview to second-guess the wisdom or expediency of the legislation”) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe court’s order also makes other statutes unworkable. For example, \nuniformed and overseas voters sometimes submit both a mail-ballot and a write-in \nballot, and Mont. Code Ann. § 13-21-206 dictates which ballot to accept. (Doc. 29, \n¶ 10.) If no mail ballot is received by 8pm on Election Day, the election \nadministrator accepts the write-in ballot. Id. Under the order, though, a mail ballot \ncould arrive later than 8pm on Election Day, causing confusion as to which ballot \nshould be accepted. Id.  \nA postmark deadline also would disrupt the period to cure under Mont. Code \nAnn. § 13-15-107(5). Under this statute, a provisional ballot may only be counted \nif the voter’s information is verified by 5pm the day after the election or \npostmarked by 5pm the day after the election and received by 3pm the sixth day \n26 \n\nafter the election. If a voter does not mail a ballot until 8pm on Election Day, it \nmay not be received in time for the election administrator to notify the voter of an \nissue and allow the voter to correct it within these time limits.  \nSimilarly, under Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-246(2)(c) and (d), disabled voters \nmay return a voted ballot by mail provided it is received by 8pm on Election Day. \nBy failing to take these voters into account, the Order treats disabled voters \ndifferently from other voters who return their ballots by mail. These are just some \nof the statutes that could be affected by a change in the Election Day deadline.  \nThe importance of the Legislature’s authority to create election deadlines, \nthe public’s trust in the veracity of election results, and the need for uniformity \nmore than outbalances increased time to mail votes. See Crawford, 553 U.S. \nat 197; Friedman, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1377. The Election Day deadline serves \nMontana’s interests in providing an orderly election and protecting election \nintegrity and should be upheld. Appellees have not met their burden to demonstrate \nthe Election Day deadline is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt under the \nbalancing test.4 As Appellees failed to make a prima facie case under the proper \nbalancing test, this Court should reverse the preliminary injunction as to the \nElection Day deadline. \n \n4 Even under a strict scrutiny standard, the deadline is narrowly drawn to \nadvance the compelling state interests outlined above. \n27 \n\nIII.  The district court incorrectly enjoined BIPA.  \nJust as the State’s interests justifying the Election Day deadline outweigh \nany minimal constitutional burden the statute imposes, the State’s interests in \nensuring voter confidence in the electoral process and guarding against abuses of \nthat process outweigh any minimal burden BIPA places on the right to vote. \nA.  The burden on the right to vote, if any, is minimal. \nThe Montana Constitution protects an individual’s right to vote, not to have \nhis or her ballot collected by others. See Mont. Const. art. II, § 13. As with the \nElection Day deadline, BIPA is not based on race or any other protected class, and \nnothing in its legislative history suggests a discriminatory purpose. Significantly, \nBIPA was not just a bill; it was a legislative referendum approved by a majority of \nMontanans. (Doc. 20, Corson Decl. ¶ 4.) As noted above, every county in Montana \nreported a majority of “Yes” votes on LR 129. Id. ¶ 6. And Plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated that BIPA bears more heavily on any class of voter.  \nAll Montana voters still have the option to vote in person; drop their ballot \noff at a polling place, a place of deposit, or the election administrator’s office; have \nan acquaintance, family member, or caregiver drop their ballot off; or mail their \nballot. Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-13-201, 13-13-204, and 13-35-703. Montanans \nmay also have someone else mail their ballot for them. See Commissioner of \nPolitical Practices, Montana Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), \n28 \n\nhttp://politicalpractices.mt.gov/BIPA (stating BIPA does not apply to ballots \nreturned by mail).  \nThe Montana Constitution does not provide voters the right to have their \nballots collected by strangers who are not election officials or postal workers. And \nthe outbreak of COVID-19—which is outside the State’s control—does not impact \nBIPA’s constitutionality. To the contrary, allowing third-party ballot harvesting is \nparticularly dangerous given the nature of COVID-19. Persons wishing to entirely \navoid the threat of contracting the virus may place their ballot in the mail, have \nsomeone else place their ballot in the mail, or have an acquaintance, family \nmember, or caregiver turn in their ballot to a polling place, a place of deposit, or \nthe election administrator’s office.  \nMoreover, BIPA is in line with other statutes Appellees have not challenged. \nFor example, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-214 allows election administrators to \ndeliver an absentee ballot by mail to an elector. Id. at (1)(a). If the elector wishes to \nhave his or her ballot received by someone else, the election administrator must \ndeliver the ballot in person, and the following conditions must be met: \n(i) the elector has designated the individual, either by a signed letter or \nby making the designation on the application form in a manner \nprescribed by the secretary of state or pursuant to 13-1-116; \n(ii) the individual taking delivery of the ballot on behalf of the elector \nverifies, by signature, receipt of the ballot; \n(iii) the election administrator believes that the individual receiving \nthe ballot is the designated person; and \n29 \n\n(iv) the designated person has not previously picked up ballots for \nfour other electors. \n \nId. at 1(c). Most absentee voters thus receive their ballots directly by mail. Yet \nAppellees have no complaints about this process and have not explained why \nregulations on ballot collection are unconstitutional when the more restrictive \nregulations on receiving a ballot are constitutionally acceptable.   \nAt most, BIPA’s requirements impose a minimal burden, and thus, strict \nscrutiny thus does not apply. See Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434. \nB.  The State has compelling interests in BIPA. \nArticle IV, section 3 of the Montana Constitution requires the Legislature to \n“insure the purity of elections and guard against abuses of the electoral process.” \nArticle IV, section 1 provides for elections by secret ballot. While Montana allows \nfor absentee voting, it recognizes the potential for ballot fraud and voter \nintimidation, particularly if unrelated third parties can collect and submit ballots. \nSee Building Confidence in U.S. Elections, § 5.2 (Sept. 2005) (Carter-Baker \nReport) (“States . . . should reduce the risks of fraud and abuse in absentee voting \nby prohibiting ‘third-party’ organizations, candidates, and political party activists \nfrom handling absentee ballots.”);5 Michael Morley, Election Modifications to \nAvoid During the Covid-19 Pandemic, Lawfare (Apr. 17, 2020) (“Third-party \n \n5 Available at https://web.archive.org/web/20070609115256/http:/ \nwww.american.edu/ia/cfer/report/full_report.pdf. \n30 \n\nabsentee ballot harvesting unnecessarily exacerbates the risks of absentee voting, \nundermining public confidence in the electoral system.”). 6  \nAs discussed above, the appearance of propriety is independently vital to \nelection integrity. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 197. To that end, BIPA’s purpose is \nto prevent voter fraud, protect voters from harassment, ensure voters feel secure in \nthe voting process, and protect public belief in the integrity of elections. \n(See Doc. 16, Ex. 1 at 2:9–3:8; 42:5–19.)  \nImportantly, BIPA was not just a legislative undertaking; it was passed by \nMontana voters by a wide majority, and a “statewide vote on [an initiative] is a \ndemonstration of a compelling state interest in [its] enactment.” Montana Auto. \nAss’n v. Greely, 193 Mont. 378, 384, 632 P.2d 300, 303 (1981). In response to \nMontanans’ desire to feel more secure in the election process, BIPA provides \nsafeguards to deter and detect fraud by ensuring ballot collectors are known to \nvoters and thus less likely to tamper with ballots. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 197 \n(“[T]he ‘electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to \ndeter or detect fraud.’”) (quoting Carter-Baker Report, § 2.5). BIPA represents \nMontanans’ desire to control the absentee voting process just as in-person voting is \ncontrolled at the polling place.  \n \n6 Available at https://www.lawfareblog.com/election-modifications-avoid-\nduring-covid-19-pandemic. \n31 \n\nAnd states need not wait for evidence of fraud to justify preventive \nmeasures. See Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U.S. 189, 195 (1986) \n(“Legislatures . . . should be permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the \nelectoral process with foresight rather than reactively.”); accord Crawford, \n553 U.S. at 194–96 (finding state interest in requiring photo identification even \nthough record contained “no evidence of” in-state fraud because “flagrant \nexamples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been documented \nthroughout this Nation’s history”). Montana thus may rely on examples from \nother states to proactively take steps to prevent fraud, which is difficult to \ndetect, before it occurs. \nFor example, in the 2003 East Chicago Mayor Democratic primary, \nfraudulent voting was “perpetrated using absentee ballots.” Crawford, 553 U.S. \nat 195. During a 2016 Texas primary election, an “organized ring” of ballot \nharvesters targeted elderly voters by fraudulently “filling out applications for \nmail-in ballots, with forged signatures. Then they would either ‘assist’ the voter \nwith filling out the ballot, or fill it out themselves, and use deception to get the \nvoter to sign the envelope the ballot would be sent back in.” Jason Allen, 4 Women \nAccused in Paid Voter Fraud Ring, CBS DFW (Oct. 12, 2018).7 And just last year, \n \n7 Available at https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2018/10/12/women-accused-paid-voter-\nfraud-ring/. \n32 \n\nNorth Carolina’s State Board of Elections unanimously vacated a 2018 \ncongressional general election because a “coordinated, unlawful, and well-funded \nabsentee ballot scheme . . . perpetrated fraud and corruption upon the election.” \nIn re Investigation of Election Irregularities Affecting Counties within the 9th \nCongressional District, ¶ 151 (N.C. Bd. of Elections Mar. 13, 2019).8  \nMontana is not alone in proactively combatting this problem: many states \nrestrict ballot harvesting, in some cases more strictly than BIPA. Democratic Nat’l \nComm. v. Hobbs, 948 F.3d 989, 1068–69 (9th Cir. 2020) (Bybee, J., dissenting).9 \n \n8 Available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/State_Board_Meeting_ \nDocs/Congressional_District_9_Portal/Order_03132019.pdf.  \n9 In Indiana “it is a felony for anyone to collect a voter’s absentee ballot, with \nexceptions for members of the voter’s household, the voter’s designated attorney in \nfact, certain election officials, and mail carriers;” Connecticut “permit[s] only the \nvoter, a designee of an ill or disabled voter, or the voter’s immediate family members \nto mail or return an absentee ballot;” and New Mexico “permits only the voter, a \nmember of the voter’s immediate family, or the voter’s caregiver to mail or return an \nabsentee ballot.” Id. at 1068 (citing Ind. Code § 3-14-2-16(4); Conn. Gen. Stat. \n§ 9-140b(a); N.M. Stat. Ann. § 1-6-10.1). Additionally, “[a]t least seven other \nstates . . . similarly restrict who can personally deliver an absentee ballot to a voting \nlocation.” Id. (citing Ga. Code Ann. § 21-2-385(a) (limiting who may personally \ndeliver absentee ballot to designees of ill or disabled voters or family members); \nMo. Rev. Stat. § 115.291(2) (restricting who can personally deliver absentee ballot); \nNev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 293.330(4) (making it a felony for anyone other than voter or \nvoter’s family member to return absentee ballot); Okla. Stat. tit. 26, § 14-108(C) \n(requiring voter delivering ballot to provide proof of identity); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \n§ 3509.05(A) (limiting who may personally deliver absentee ballot); Tex. Elec. Code \nAnn. § 86.006(a) (permitting only the voter to personally deliver ballot)). And finally, \n“Colorado forbids anyone from collecting more than ten ballots;” North Dakota, four; \nNew Jersey and Minnesota, three; and Arkansas, Nebraska, and West Virginia, two. \nId. at 1068–69 (citing Colo. Rev. Stat. § 1-7.5-107(4)(b); N.D. Cent. Code § 16.1-07-\n08(1); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 19:63-4(a); Minn. Stat. Ann. § 203B.08 sbd. 1; Ark. Code \nAnn. § 7-5-403(a)(1); Neb. Rev. Stat. § 32-943(2); W. Va. Code § 3-3-5(k)). \n33 \n\nIn fact, BIPA follows the recommendation of a bipartisan Commission on \nFederal Election Reform led by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former \nU.S. Secretary of State James Baker, which the U.S. Supreme Court has cited with \napproval. See Crawford, 553 U.S. at 197. The Commission recommended that \nstates “should prohibit a person from handling absentee ballots other than the \nvoter, an acknowledged family member, the U.S. Postal Service or other legitimate \nshipper, or election officials,” and the practice “of allowing candidates or party \nworkers to pick up and deliver absentee ballots should be eliminated.” \nCarter-Baker Report § 5.2. The Commission recognized that “[a]bsentee ballots \nremain the largest source of potential voter fraud” and urged states to “reduce \nthe risks of fraud and abuse in absentee voting by prohibiting ‘third-party’ \norganizations, candidates, and political party activists from handling \nabsentee ballots.” Id. at 46. \nAdditionally, though Montana may not have reported cases of election fraud \nwith respect to ballot collection, there have been cases where election fraud or \nnoncompliance with election laws was present in other ways. See e.g., Larson, ¶ 65 \n(affirming invalidation of 87 signatures gathered due to noncompliance with \nMont. Code Ann.§ 13-10-601(2)); Montanans v. State, 2006 MT 277, ¶ 80, \n334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759 (holding plaintiffs engaged in “pervasive and general \npattern and practice of fraud and conscious circumvention of procedural \n34 \n\nsafeguards” by certifying signatures not signed in presence of affiant, providing \nfalse addresses, and employing a “bait and switch” tactic to induce people who \nknowingly signed one petition to unknowingly sign two others). This Court thus \nhas recognized that laws regulating the manner of elections serve an important \npurpose and has enforced these laws.  \nAs its sponsor testified, BIPA was drafted to protect voter trust in the \nelectoral process following reports from voters who felt coerced into handing their \nballot to a collector. (Doc. 16, Ex. 1 at 42:10–19.) BIPA addresses these concerns \nby taking reasonable steps to insulate absentee or mail voters: a limited number of \ncompleted ballots may be returned by family members, household members, \ncaregivers, and acquaintances. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-703. In this way, BIPA \nenables absentee voters to execute “a secret ballot”—“the prerequisite of a \ndemocratic election.” Carter-Baker Report § 9.1; accord State ex rel. Van Horn v. \nLyon, 119 Mont. 212, 214, 173 P.2d 891, 891 (1946) (recognizing secrecy is the \nessence of voting by ballot).  \nBIPA also serves the State’s interests of maintaining uniformity in the \nelection code. As discussed above, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-214 requires election \nadministrators to deliver an absentee ballot either by mail to an elector or in-person \nto an individual designated by the elector (who may collect ballots for up to four \n35 \n\nelectors). BIPA ensures that voters return their ballots via a similar method to the \nway they are collected: by mail, in person, or by an individual known to the voter.  \nIn sum, BIPA serves Montana’s interests in protecting election integrity, \nwhich outweighs any burden BIPA’s safeguards might impose on voters. As with \nany election regulation, BIPA has some impact on the right to vote. Burdick, \n504 U.S. at 434. But where the line should be drawn, between preventing fraud or \nthe appearance of fraud in ballot collecting and allowing ballot collection as an \nadditional tool to assist voters is, ultimately, a task reserved for the Legislature.  \nAppellees thus have not met their burden of demonstrating BIPA is \nunconstitutional under the appropriate balancing test.10 The district court thus \nincorrectly concluded that the challenge to BIPA meets the requirements for a \npreliminary injunction, and this Court should reverse its Order.  \nCONCLUSION \n  The district court erred by failing to apply the proper balancing test to the \nchallenged election laws. The State’s interests in facilitating orderly elections and \nprotecting election integrity far outweigh any minimal burden that either the \nElection Day deadline or BIPA imposes on voting. The district court’s issuance of \na preliminary injunction was incorrect, and this Court should reverse it. \n \n10 Even if strict scrutiny were applied, BIPA is narrowly tailored to the \nState’s compelling interests in promoting public faith in elections and preventing \nvoter fraud. \n36 \n\nRespectfully submitted this 26th day of June, 2020. \nTIMOTHY C.

For over two decades, Montana has been ahead of the curve on access to absentee \nvoting. Since 1999, Montana has allowed all eligible citizens to vote by absentee ballot, without \nexcuse, in all elections. When Montana adopted no-excuse absentee voting, only 15 other states \npermitted all registered voters to cast absentee ballots. Today, only 17 states require an excuse.  \n2.  Montana’s broad acceptance of absentee voting paid off. More Montana voters \nbegan voting absentee, and more Montana voters voted overall: In 2000, just 15.68 percent of \n \n\n \nvoters cast absentee ballots. Montana Secretary of State, Absentee Turnout 2000-Present (Mar. 12, \n2019), available at https://sosmt.gov/elections/faq/#absentee-voting. In the following presidential \nelection, an additional 6 percent of voters voted absentee. Id. And by the 2016 election, 65.38 \npercent of Montana voters cast absentee ballots. Id. As the volume of absentee ballots increased, \nso too did the overall percentage of ballots cast: In 2000, only 59.9 percent of registered Montana \nvoters voted. Montana Secretary of State, Montana Voter Turnout, (Mar. 12, 2019), available at \nhttps://sosmt.gov/elections/voter-turnout/. In the next presidential election, however, 71.4 percent \nof registered Montana voters did. Id. And 16 years after Montana expanded access to absentee \nvoting, the percentage of registered voters who voted rose to 74.4. Id.  \n3.  The increase in the volume of absentee voting—and in the overall increase in votes \ncast—coincided with an increase in organizing around absentee ballots. In the wake of Montana’s \ndecision to expand absentee voting, organizations focused on getting out the vote undertook efforts \nto help Montana voters return their absentee ballots.  \n4.  Over time, those efforts grew to include providing voters with convenient drop-off \nlocations and door-to-door absentee ballot return assistance. In both cases, voters voluntarily chose \nto provide their sealed and signed absentee ballot return envelope to trusted representatives of \ncommunity organizations or campaigns, who then transported the sealed absentee ballot return \nenvelope to the county elections office or other county drop-off site.  \n5.  These  services  were  invaluable  to  voters  whose  work  commitments,  school \nschedules, family care responsibilities, mobility impairments, lack of access to postal mail service, \nor lack of access to transportation made returning their absentee ballot difficult or even impossible. \nThese services were particularly necessary for voters voting by absentee ballot during the week \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 2 \n\n \nprior to an election, where postal delivery timeframes make the on-time delivery of a mailed-in \nabsentee ballot far from certain.  \n6.  The increase in the volume of absentee voting, and the uncertainties regarding \nwhether and when a mailed-in absentee ballot would be received at a county elections office, also \nspurred county elections officials to introduce alternative methods for voters to return absentee \nballots. These included secure drop boxes operated by county elections officials that enabled voters \nto submit their absentee ballots to county elections officials 24-hours a day, rather than just during \nthe business hours of a county elections office. Voters could use a county’s 24-hour drop box \nwithin the last week of the election and have confidence that their ballot would be received by the \ndeadline. \n7.  Last year, however, that all changed. Twenty years after Montana expanded access \nto absentee voting, it restricted it. See Mont. Code § 13-35-701 et seq. Under the new and \nunnecessarily burdensome restrictions placed on absentee voting (the “Absentee Ballot Assistance \nBan”), it is unlawful for a person to “collect”—which, under the statute, means to “gain possession \nor control of a ballot”—a voter’s absentee ballot unless the person is an election official, a postal \nworker, the voter’s family member, household member, or caregiver, or an “acquaintance” of the \nvoter. Id. at 13-35-703(2). Even then, except for election officials and postal workers, no one may \nassist more than six voters by collecting and returning their absentee ballots. Id. at 13-35-703(3).  \n8.  The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban is coupled with a reporting requirement (the \n“Registration Requirement”). See Mont. Code § 13-35-704. A family member, household member, \ncaregiver, or “acquaintance” who assists a voter by “collecting” and returning their absentee ballot \nmust sign a registry maintained by election officials when delivering the ballot to the county \nelection office, a polling place, or “a place of deposit.” Id. The assistor must also provide election \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 3 \n\n \nofficials with their name, address, and telephone number, as well as the voter’s name and address, \nand describe their relationship with the voter. Id. at § 13-35-704(1)-(3).  \n9.  If someone attempting to help a voter return their absentee ballot violates any of \nthese provisions, they could face a $500 fine for each ballot collected. Id. at § 13-35-705. \n10.  To make matters worse, the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and the Registration \nRequirement do not exist in a vacuum. Absentee voters must still comply with Montana’s general \nabsentee voting requirements, including—crucially—the requirement that absentee ballots must \nbe received by 8 p.m. on Election Day (the “Election Day Cutoff”). Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-\n201.  \n11.  The Election Day Cutoff means that regardless of when the ballot is postmarked, \nand regardless of whether the voter is responsible for any delay the ballot encounters in the mail, \nif the ballot is not received by 8 p.m., the voter is entirely disenfranchised. As a result, if an \nabsentee voter returns her ballot by mail, she must send it well before Election Day to increase the \nodds that it will be counted.  \n12.  The combined effect of the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, the Registration \nRequirement, and the Election Day Cutoff is to make it significantly more difficult for voters to \nexercise their right to vote.  \n13.  The  Absentee  Ballot  Assistance  Ban  effectively  outlaws  organizations  from \nproviding ballot collection services by limiting ballot collection to a small number of individuals \nauthorized to undertake the practice, and further limiting the number of ballots that any individual \ncan collect and return.  \n14.  The Registration Requirement forces county elections administrators to have a staff \nmember available to interrogate any voter who attempts to return a ballot in person in order to \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 4 \n\n \ndetermine whether the voter is a “collector” who must sign the registry—which effectively \nprevents counties from providing 24-hour drop boxes and other convenient return options or \nlocations.  \n15.  Finally, the Election Day Cutoff prevents voters from using postal mail to return \ntheir ballots within about a week of the election without risking absolute disenfranchisement.  \n16.  The Election Day Cutoff consequently forces absentee voters voting within a week \nof the election to have their ballot dropped off in person. But the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban \nand the Registration Requirement now make doing so much more difficult: voters are only allowed \nto entrust their ballot to a limited group of people authorized to collect and return ballots, and \nanyone returning absentee ballots in person—whether the voter herself or a ballot collector—can \nonly do so during the business hours of a drop-off site staffed by county election officials.  \n17.  Taken together, the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, the Registration Requirement, \nand the Election Day Cutoff (collectively the “Challenged Provisions”) unreasonably burden the \nright to vote of some Montana voters and completely disenfranchise others. For these reasons, and \nthe reasons stated below, Plaintiffs request that the Court declare that the Challenged Provisions \nviolate the Montana Constitution. \nPARTIES  \n18.  Plaintiff Robyn Driscoll is the Chair of the Montana Democratic Party and a \nresident of Billings. In her personal capacity as Montana citizen, Ms. Driscoll is a voter and is \nactively engaged in assisting other Montana voters with voting, including voting by mail and \nabsentee ballot. Ms. Driscoll’s goal is to elect Democratic Party candidates to public office \nthroughout  Yellowstone  County  and  Montana.  To  accomplish  this,  Ms.  Driscoll  supports \nDemocratic Party candidates through fundraising and organizing work, including providing Get \nOut  the  Vote  (“GOTV”)  assistance  and  actively  supporting  the  development  of  programs \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 5 \n\n \nbenefiting Democratic Party candidates. Ms. Driscoll plans to continue to engage in fundraising, \nGOTV assistance, and the development of programs to elect Democratic Party candidates in \nYellowstone County and Montana. Prior to the passage of the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, \nMs. Driscoll personally participated in assisting absentee voters through ballot collection efforts. \nThe Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, Registration Requirement, and the Election Day Cutoff will \ndirectly harm Ms. Driscoll in several ways. By imposing severe burdens on the right to vote, these \nprovisions will directly harm Ms. Driscoll by frustrating her goal of, and efforts in, turning out \nvoters in Yellowstone County and Montana who support Democratic Party candidates and by \nspecifically preventing her from continuing to assist absentee voters through ballot collection \nefforts. Ms. Driscoll is aware of the effects that the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, Registration \nRequirement, and the Election Day Cutoff will cause, and to combat these effects in the 2020 \ngeneral election in Yellowstone County and Montana, she will divert and expend additional time \nand resources in voter education and turnout efforts at the expense of her other efforts in \nYellowstone County and throughout the state. \n19.  Plaintiff  Montana  Democratic  Party  (“MDP”)  is  a  political  party  established \npursuant to Montana Code Section 13-38-101 et. seq. Its mission is to elect Democratic Party \ncandidates in local, county, state, and federal elections. MDP works to accomplish that mission by \neducating, mobilizing, assisting, and turning out voters throughout the state. These activities \ninclude absentee ballot collection services, efforts to encourage voters to return their absentee \nballots, and the provision of information and advice to voters regarding how and when to return \nabsentee ballots. In past elections, the MDP made expenditures in the millions of dollars to \npersuade and mobilize voters to support candidates up and down the ballot who affiliate with the \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 6 \n\n \nDemocratic Party in Montana. The MDP again intends to make substantial expenditures to support \nDemocratic candidates in the 2020 election and in future elections. \n20.  During general election years, the MDP operates a field office in Billings, which \nserves as the headquarters for the MDP’s voter persuasion and mobilization activities. These \nactivities include encouraging voting and assisting voters in returning absentee ballots. In 2018, \nthe Billings office was staffed by approximately a half dozen MDP employees, including members \nof the MDP’s senior leadership team. The Billings office served as the training facility for over 40 \norganizers whom the MDP deployed throughout the state and was also the base of operations for \nthe MDP’s voter protection team prior to election day. The office also hosted over one hundred \nMDP  volunteers  for  voter  persuasion  and  mobilization  activities,  including  door-to-door \ncanvassing in Billings and other locations in Yellowstone County, during which time MDP \nrepresentatives offered absentee ballot collection services to voters. The MDP provided trainings \nto organizers and volunteers regarding absentee ballot collection services at its Billings office. The \nMDP is planning similar activities in its Billings office for the 2020 November election.   \n21.  Plaintiff Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (“DSCC”) is the national \nsenatorial committee of the Democratic Party as defined by 52 U.S.C. § 30101(14). Its mission is \nto elect candidates of the Democratic Party to the U.S. Senate, including from Montana. DSCC \nworks to accomplish that mission in Montana by assisting the MDP in educating, mobilizing, \nassisting, and turning out voters. In 2018, DSCC made contributions and expenditures in the \nmillions of dollars to persuade and mobilize voters to support Senate candidates who affiliate with \nthe Democratic Party. In 2020, there will be a Senate election in Montana, and DSCC will work \nto  elect  the  Democratic  candidate.  As  a  result,  DSCC  again  intends  to  make  substantial \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 7 \n\n \ncontributions and expenditures to support the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Montana in \n2020. \n22.  The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, Registration Requirement, and the Election \nDay Cutoff directly harm MDP and DSCC. The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban frustrates MDP’s \nand DSCC’s missions by prohibiting the acts of individuals and organizations, including but not \nlimited to the MDP itself, that want to assist voters in returning their ballot. The Registration \nRequirement and Election Day Cutoff similarly impede the MDP’s and DSCC’s ability to turn out \nabsentee voters. To combat the effects of the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, Registration \nRequirement and the Election Day Cutoff in the 2020 general election, the MDP and DSCC will \nhave to expend and divert funds and resources in voter mobilization efforts at the expense of its \nother efforts in Montana and, in the case of DSCC, in other states. The MDP, the DSCC, and their \nmembers, volunteers, and constituents will also be prevented from fully exercising their speech \nand associational rights to engage in these voter assistance efforts as long as the Absentee Ballot \nOrganizing, Registration Requirement, and Election Day Cutoff remain in effect.  \n23.  The  Secretary  is  the  chief  elections  officer  of  the  State  of  Montana  and  is \nresponsible for maintaining uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of election \nlaws. Mont. Code § 13-1-201. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Secretary has the duty of \npreparing and delivering to election administrators written directives and instructions relating to \nelection law. Mont. Code § 13-1-202(1). The Secretary is named as a Defendant solely in his \nofficial capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  Plaintiffs bring this action under the Montana Constitution. As a court of general \njurisdiction, this Court has authority to hear these claims. Mont. Code § 3-5-302.  \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 8 \n\n \n25.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the \nMontana Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. Mont. Code §§ 27-8-101 et seq., 27-8-201 et seq.   \n26.  Venue is proper in this Court, as Plaintiff, Robyn Driscoll resides in Billings. In \naddition,  the  unlawful  effects  of  the  Absentee  Ballot  Assistance  Ban,  the  Registration \nRequirement, and the Election Day Cutoff directly effect and interfere with the election and voting-\nrelated activities that the MDP and Ms. Driscoll conduct in Yellowstone County, including the \nactivities coordinated from the MDP’s Billings office. There is direct injury to the MDP, Ms. \nDriscoll, and the DSCC in Billings.   \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Legislative History and Statutory Framework \n27.  On March 16, 2017, Republican Senator Albert Olszewski introduced Senate Bill \n352 (“SB 352”) to the Montana Senate. In the spring of 2018, the Legislature voted to put SB 352 \non the 2018 midterm election ballot as Legislative Referendum 129 (“LR 129”).  \n28.  Leading up to that vote, several Montanans testified in opposition to SB 352 at \npublic hearings before the House and Senate. No members of the public testified in support of it. \n29.  Nonetheless, on a heavily partisan basis, SB 352 passed through the Montana \nSenate and House of Representatives. On March 20, 2017, the Senate passed SB 352 with a vote \nof 30 to 19. All 30 votes in favor of the bill were cast by Republican senators, as were two of the \nvotes against it. The rest of the votes against the bill were cast by Democratic senators. On April \n13, 2017, the House of Representatives approved the measure by just two votes. And those votes \nwere similarly split: 50 Republican members and one Democratic member voted in favor of the \nbill while nine Republican and 40 Democratic members voted against it. With that partisan record, \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 9 \n\n \nthe measure was placed on the 2018 midterm election ballot under the title “Montana Ballot \nInterference Prevention Act.” On November 6, 2018, Montana voters approved it. \n30.  The statute defines “collect” as “gain[ing] possession or control of a ballot,” Mont. \nCode § 13-35-702(3), and provides that a person may not knowingly collect a voter’s voted or \nunvoted ballot, Mont. Code § 13-35-703(1).  \n31.  The statute specifies that despite the general ban on ballot collection, it does not \napply to election officials, postal workers, and individuals “specifically authorized by law to \ntransmit United States mail.” Mont. Code § 12-35-703(2)(a)-(b).  \n32.  The statute also permits certain other individuals to collect ballots subject to \nadditional  requirements.  A  voter’s  caregiver,  family  member,  household  member,  or \n“acquaintance” may collect a voter’s ballot. Mont. Code § 12-35-703(2)(c)-(f). The statute defines \n“acquaintance” as “an individual known by the voter.” Mont. Code § 13-35-702(1).  \n33.  However, an individual authorized to collect a voter’s ballot because they are a \ncaregiver, family member, household member, or “acquaintance” may not “collect and convey” \nmore than six ballots. Mont. Code § 12-35-703(3). \n34.  In addition, an individual authorized to collect a voter’s ballot because they are a \ncaregiver, family member, household member, or “acquaintance” “shall sign a registry when \ndelivering the ballot to the polling place, a place of deposit, or the election administrator's office.” \nThey must also provide their name, address, telephone number, the voter’s name and address, and \nthe individual’s relationship to the voter. Mont. Code § 13-35-704.  \n35.  A violation of a provision of the statute is punishable by a fine of $500 for each \nballot unlawfully collected. Mont. Code § 13-35-705.  \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 10 \n\n \n36.  Notably,  the  Absentee  Assistance  Ban  and  Registration  Requirement  did  not \ndisplace Montana’s existing absentee voting requirements. They added to them. For instance, the \nprovisions work in concert with Montana’s requirement that absentee ballots be received by \nelection officials by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The Election Day Cutoff means that, regardless of \nthe date a ballot is postmarked, and regardless of how responsible a voter was in timely mailing \ntheir absentee ballot, if an absentee ballot is not received by 8 p.m. on Election Day, it is not \ncounted. \nB.  The challenged provisions burden Montana voters’ right to vote. \n37.  In Montana, the vast majority of voters vote absentee. In 2018, over 73 percent of \nvotes cast in Montana were cast by absentee ballot. Secretary of State, Absentee Turnout 2000-\nPresent (Mar. 12, 2019), available at https://sosmt.gov/elections/faq/#absentee-voting. That is \n360,530 voters. Id. The Challenged Provisions, individually and collectively, will burden each of \nthem.  \n38.  Absentee  voting  is  invaluable  to  voters  whose  work  commitments,  school \nschedules, family care responsibilities, mobility impairments, or lack of access to transportation \nmake voting on election day difficult or even impossible. But these barriers to participation also \napply to the process of obtaining and returning an absentee ballot itself, particularly for voters \nvoting by absentee ballot during the week prior to an election, when postal delivery timeframes \nmake the on-time delivery of a mailed-in absentee ballot far from certain.  \n39.  Absentee ballot return services helped reduce these barriers by allowing voters to \nchoose to give their absentee ballot to a trusted representative of a community organization or \ncampaign, who then transported the sealed absentee ballot return envelope to the county elections \noffice or other county drop-off site.  \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 11 \n\n \n40.  The Absentee Assistance Ban effectively bans these organized absentee ballot \nassistance efforts. Representatives of organizations like the MDP who engage in get-out-the-vote \nefforts will not fall into the category of family member, household member, or caregiver for the \noverwhelming majority of voters with whom they come into contact. And the term “acquaintance” \nis too vague to provide meaningful guidance regarding whether a representative of an organization \nwho has met a voter for the first time while performing get-out-the-vote efforts is “known to the \nvoter,” such that the representative of an organization can provide absentee ballot return services \nto the voter without risking a $500 per-ballot fine. As a result, the Absentee Assistance Ban chills \norganizations like the MDP from providing absentee ballot return services at all. Moreover, the \nsix-ballot limit on absentee ballot collection puts strict limitations on the amount of assistance that \nany person (with the exception of election officials and postal workers) can provide to their family, \nfriends, and neighbors.  \n41.  The  Registration  Requirement  will  significantly  reduce  voters’  options  for \nreturning their ballots in person. Prior to the enactment of the Registration Requirement, some \ncounties placed locked boxes where voters could drop off their absentee ballots at any time in \nvarious locations around the county; for instance, outside the county courthouse. But because of \nthe Registration Requirement, Montana voters will now have to deliver absentee ballots to an \nelection  official.  Normal  operating  hours  for  most  county  election  offices  are  8-5  p.m.  on \nweekdays, which means that voters can no longer return their ballots in the evenings or on \nweekends. And county election offices may be located many miles away from a voter’s home or \nplace of work, especially in more rural counties, so a quick trip to the election office is not always \npossible. \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 12 \n\n \n42.  Additionally, the Registration Requirement will increase the length of time that \nsome voters must stand in line to cast a ballot. In some election locations, as many as 5,000 \nabsentee ballots are dropped off during the 25 work days before the election. And when they are, \nan election official must find out whether each person is dropping off their own ballot or the ballot \nof another voter. In the latter case, the election official will have to ensure that the person dropping \noff the ballot completes the Ballot Collection Registry Form and provides the information required \nby the Registration Requirement. This new interaction will cause bottlenecks at election offices \nand polling locations, which will result in another burden on voting. It has already resulted in voter \nfrustration. See, e.g., Amy Beth Hanson, Election Clerks Say Absentee Ballot Rule Suppresses \nVotes,  AP  News  (Feb.  27,  2020),  available  at \nhttps://apnews.com/f150715d1dca604672121f84c40f757b  (noting  that  “one  voter  became  so \nfrustrated last year when he came in to drop off ballots for himself and his wife that he ripped up \nthe ballots and threw them at the clerks.”). According to at least one county elections supervisor, \nthis registry—a list of voters and assistors who are following the law—adds no administrative \nvalue to their election facilitation efforts. \n43.  Because of the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, those voters no longer have access \nto ballot return assistance from organizations or campaigns, which would obviate the need for an \nabsentee voter to stand in line after traveling to the county elections office during standard working \nhours.  \n44.  The Election Day Cutoff ensures a severe burden on voters who opt to return their \nabsentee ballots by mail. If an absentee voter returns her ballot by mail, she must send it well \nbefore Election Day to ensure that it will be counted. See, e.g., United States Postal Service, News \nfor  the  2018  Election  Cycle,  https://about.usps.com/postal-\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 13 \n\n \nbulletin/2018/pb22498/html/cover_006.htm (last visited Mar. 5, 2020) (recommending that voters \nmail their ballots at least one week before the due date).  \n45.  The Election Day Cutoff also severely burdens voters because similarly situated \nvoters face different effective deadlines for returning their ballot by mail. Voters in rural areas face \nlonger mail transit times than voters in larger cities and must mail their ballots sooner than voters \nin larger cities to ensure that they are received on time.  \n46.  The Election Day Cutoff requires the voter to vote without complete information. \nWithin days of an election, a single event could influence voters’ decisions. Alex Samuels, They \nvoted early for Buttigieg and Klobuchar in Texas. Now some feel they threw their votes away, The \nTexas Tribune (Mar. 2, 2020), available at https://www.texastribune.org/2020/03/02/buttigieg-\nklobuchar-early-vote-drop-out/. But because of the Election Day Cutoff, absentee voters returning \ntheir ballots by mail will have already cast their ballots.  \n47.  Waiting any longer to mail an absentee ballot risks complete disenfranchisement \nbecause, regardless of when the ballot is postmarked, and regardless of whether the voter is \nresponsible for any delay the ballot encounters, if it is not received by 8 p.m., it is tossed out \nentirely. Thus, the Election Day Cutoff forces voters between a rock and a hard place: the voter \ncan wait to be completely informed and risk losing their vote entirely or they can mail their ballot \nwell in advance and risk casting their vote without complete information, or even wasting their \nvote.  \n48.  The Challenged Provisions impose particularly severe burdens on Native American \nvoters. Many Native American voters live in remote areas with limited access to transportation, \noften located far from county elections offices. Mailing absentee ballots can be difficult for Native \nvoters because they often have limited access to postal services, and mail sent from tribal nations \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 14 \n\n \nmay face a longer transit time to and from postal service processing centers than voters residing \nelsewhere in the state.  \n49.  In order to help overcome these obstacles to the accessing absentee voting, Native \nAmerican voters have relied upon organized ballot return assistance programs provided by civic \norganizations.  But  the  Absentee  Ballot  Assistance  Ban—in  particular,  the  6-ballot  limit— \neffectively prevents these organizations from providing assistance to Native voters with their \nabsentee ballots.  \n50.  The restrictions also burden senior and disabled voters. These voters’ varying \ncapabilities  with  mobility  makes  obtaining,  completing,  and  returning  absentee  ballots \nchallenging. It can also be difficult for these voters to stand in line at polling locations or elections \noffices. And these voters may not have a caregiver, family member, or acquaintance who has the \ntime and ability to make sure that their absentee ballots make it to the polls on time.  \n51.   The Challenged Provisions will similarly burden young voters. Many young voters \ndo not have access to personal transportation. And students have come to rely on ballot return \nassistance programs. But the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban leaves organizations that run ballot \nreturn assistance programs on college campuses unable to assist college students. These groups \nwill no longer be able to provide secure lock boxes on campuses where students can drop off their \nabsentee ballots. Nor will they be able to run door-to-door assistance programs.  \n52.  But perhaps the most significant burden placed on all voters who vote absentee, \nand particularly on the groups mentioned above, is the burden that the Challenged Provisions \ncreate when they are enforced simultaneously. Because the Election Day Cutoff forces voters who \nreturn their absentee ballots by mail to choose between casting their vote without complete \ninformation or risking losing their vote entirely, it encourages voters to return their absentee ballots \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 15 \n\n \nin person. Because of the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, those voters no longer have access to \norganized ballot collection services to return their ballots in person. Finally, the Registration \nRequirement now requires absentee voters who return their ballots in person to do so during \nbusiness hours in order to hand their ballot to an election official. The Registration Requirement \nwill create bottlenecks at elections offices, the volume of which will increase in the last week of \nthe election because the Election Day Cutoff leaves voters with no choice but to return their ballots \nin person.  \nC.  The  Absentee  Ballot  Assistance  Ban  burdens  protected  political  speech  and \nassociation rights. \n53.  Plaintiffs engage in voter turnout efforts including campaigns and drives during \nwhich they, their members, and their volunteers help voters submit their absentee ballots.  \n54.  These efforts are among the most important mediums through which Plaintiffs \ncommunicate their belief in the power and importance of participating in democratic elections, \nincluding for voters who have experienced historically low turnout rates when compared to the \nrest of the population, or who for various reasons—disability, advanced age, or lack of access to \ntransportation—would  have  difficulty  voting.  And  these  initiatives  facilitate  the  political \nparticipation of such voters. \n55.  Plaintiffs engage in protected political speech and association when they interact \nwith Montana voters to encourage them to cast their absentee ballots and assist voters in submitting \nabsentee ballots, including, at the voter’s request, collecting and returning a voter’s absentee ballot \nto an appropriate election official by the deadline. Encouraging voters to participate in the \ndemocratic process through voting and assisting voters in submitting their ballots are forms of \npolitical speech and expressive conduct inherently tied to Plaintiffs’ missions.  \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 16 \n\n \n56.  But  the  Absentee  Ballot  Assistance  Ban  prevents  Plaintiffs  from  providing \nabsentee ballot return services to almost all voters they encounter. In particular, the uncertain scope \nand meaning of the term “acquaintance” chills Plaintiffs’ representatives from offering to provide \nballot return services to voters. And even in situations where representatives of Plaintiffs may \npermissibly collect ballots under the narrow, permissible forms of ballot collection under the \nstatute, the statute severely and arbitrarily limits the size of the audience that a single volunteer \ncan reach.  \n57.  The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, by its plain terms, specifically targets and \npenalizes protected political speech and associational activity by restricting the types of people \nwho may permissibly collect ballots and imposing a six-ballot collection limit. Organizations that \nprovide absentee ballot return services, such as the MDP, often do so through their representatives, \nincluding paid staff and volunteers, any one of whom may interact with hundreds of voters in \ndifferent communities through door-to-door canvassing and other forms of voter contact. As a \ndirect result of these activities, representatives of these organizations are much more likely to \nencounter voters in need of absentee ballot return services who are not family members, household \nmembers, or “acquaintances,” and are much more likely to encounter more than six voters in need \nof such services. The restrictions on absentee ballot collection services specifically target this form \nof large-scale, sustained associational activity by representatives of organized groups, prohibiting \npolitical speech and expressive conduct precisely because organizations are engaging in too much \nspeech and associational conduct.  \n58.  The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban also restricts expression because it makes it \nless likely that Plaintiffs’ activities will result in increased voting. And the threat of financial \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 17 \n\n \npenalties for violating the Challenged Provisions deters volunteers and canvassers from engaging \neven in the narrow, permissible forms of ballot collection for fear of prosecution. \nD.  The State has no legitimate interest in enforcing the Challenged Provisions.  \n59.  Montana has no legitimate interest in enforcing the Challenged Provisions. To the \nextent that the Absentee Ballot Assistance Bans are intended to protect election integrity by \npreventing  voter  coercion  or  ballot  tampering,  they  are  redundant.  Montana  law  already \ncriminalizes attempts to coerce voters or fraudulently manipulate ballots. See Mont. Code Ann. § \n13-35-205. Moreover, there is no evidence that interference with absentee ballots is an issue in \nMontana. Nor is there any evidence that any organized absentee ballot assistance program led to \nvoter coercion or manipulated or diverted ballots. Indeed, the legislative history of SB 352 \nidentifies no instances of abuse of organized absentee ballot assistance.  \n60.  In past elections, organizations conducting absentee ballot assistance programs \nalready proactively put measures in place to ensure transparency and the timely return of the \nabsentee ballots they collect. For example, some organizations required voters who wanted the \norganization to collect and return their ballot to complete a form, listing the voter’s name, address, \ntelephone number, and the date. Similarly, some organizations provided voters with a receipt \ncontaining the organization’s contact information and instructions on how to track the status of \ntheir absentee ballot. If organizations were unable to return an absentee ballot to election officials \nthe same day, they stored ballots in a locked box or a locked room in an office.  \n61.  Regarding  the  Election  Day  Cutoff,  although  Montana  may  certainly  set  a \nreasonable deadline to receive ballots to ensure the finality of the election results, the State could \neasily serve that interest by accepting ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within a \nreasonable time—five business days, at a minimum—thereafter. Montana does not limit the \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 18 \n\n \nnumber of days the state has to certify election results after Election Day. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-\n15-507. And the results of elections in Montana are often not certified as final until many days or \neven weeks after election day. See, e.g., Secretary of State, 2018 General Election – Post Election \nAudit  Summary  (Nov.  14,  2018),  available  at     \nhttps://sosmt.gov/Portals/142/Elections/Documents/2018-PEA-Summary-Stmt.pdf  (noting  that \nMontana’s Post-Election Audit Random Selection Meeting, during which the Secretary of State’s \noffice  reviewed  the  post-election  audit  results of  randomly  selected  counties  was  held  and \nconducted on November 14, 2018, eight days after the November 2018 elections). In fact, Montana \nwill count a provisional ballot as long as the information used to verify it is postmarked by 5 p.m. \non the day after the election and received by 3 p.m. on the sixth day after the election. Mont. Code \n§ 13-15-107. The state has no interest in completely disenfranchising voters whose absentee ballots \nthat are received during that time. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nMontana Constitution, Article II, § 13  \nAbsentee Ballot Assistance Ban and Registration Requirement - Undue Burden on the Right \nto Suffrage \n \n62.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n63.  Article II, § 13 of the Montana Constitution provides that “[a]ll elections shall be \nfree and open, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise \nof the right of suffrage.” The right of suffrage is a fundamental right. Willems v. State, 2014 MT \n82, ¶ 32, 374 Mont. 343, 325 P.3d 1204.  \n64.  Other state courts and the federal courts have applied a balancing test to restrictions \non the right to vote challenged under analogous provisions of state and federal constitutions that \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 19 \n\n \nprotect  the fundamental right to  vote.  For  example, when considering whether state action \nimpermissibly burdens the right to vote, the U.S. Supreme Court uses what has come to be known \nas the Anderson-Burdick test, which requires courts to weigh “the character and magnitude of the \nasserted injury” against “the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the \nburden imposed by its rule.” Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) (quoting Anderson v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1982)). Under this balancing test, even a minimal burden must be \njustified by “sufficiently weighty” state interests. See Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 288-89 \n(1992); see also, e.g., Guare v. State, 167 N.H. 658, 667 (2015) (holding that a burden on the right \nto vote that is more than minimal but not severe requires the state to “articulate specific, rather \nthan  abstract  state  interests,  and  explain  why  the  particular  restriction  imposed  is  actually \nnecessary, meaning it actually addresses, the interest set forth.”). \n65.  By imposing barriers to returning absentee ballots, the Absentee Ballot Assistance \nBan and Registration Requirement severely burdens the right to vote of absentee voters in \nMontana, and particularly burdens senior, disabled, Native American, and young voters. The \nAbsentee Ballot Assistance Ban eliminates access to organized absentee ballot return services on \nwhich those voters have come to rely, and limits the assistance that family members, housemates, \nor acquaintances can provide voters. The Registration Requirement restricts all absentee voters—\nincluding both those who do or not rely upon absentee ballot return services—from having their \nballots returned in person at times and locations other than business hours at sites staffed by \nelections officials.  \n66.  The burdens imposed on the right to vote by the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban \nand Registration Requirement are not justified by any state interests, let alone ones sufficiently \nweighty. Montana has no legitimate interest in enforcing the Challenged Provisions. Neither the \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 20 \n\n \nAbsentee Ballot Assistance Ban nor the Registration Requirement is necessary to prevent coercion \nor ballot tampering because Montana law already criminalizes attempts to coerce voters or \nfraudulently manipulate ballots. See Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-205. But even if the Absentee \nBallot Assistance Ban and Registration Requirement were not redundant, there is no evidence that \ninterference with absentee ballots is an issue in Montana. Nor is there any evidence that any \norganized absentee ballot assistance program has led to voter coercion or manipulated or diverted \nballots. The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and the Registration Requirement address a problem \nthat simply does not exist.    \nCOUNT II \nMontana Constitution, Article II, § 13  \nElection Day Cutoff - Undue Burden on the Right to Suffrage \n \n67.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n68.  Like the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban, the Election Day Cutoff imposes a severe \nburden on many Montana voters. Voters must first learn about the Election Day Cutoff and \naccurately predict when their ballot must be mailed for it to be counted. For voters who misjudge \nhow long it will take for their ballot to arrive back to their county, or for those who never learn \nabout  Montana’s  Election  Day  Cutoff,  the  punishment  is  swift  and  severe:  total \ndisenfranchisement.  \n69.  Montana’s Election Day Cutoff also severely burdens all voters who vote by mail \neven if those voters’ ballots are successfully counted. By requiring its voters to cast their mail \nballots a week before the election in order for those ballots be counted, the Election Day Cutoff \nforces Montana voters to cast their ballots before they can account for any critical information \nabout the election or the candidates that arises during the final week leading up to Election Day—\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 21 \n\n \narguably, the most critical week in an entire election cycle. Montana’s Election Day Cutoff thus \ndeprives voters of the ability to engage in this robust period of civic engagement, because it \neffectively requires them to have already cast their vote. \n70.  While Montana’s Election Day Cutoff burdens all Montana voters who vote by \nmail, it also particularly burdens seniors, students, disabled voters, and Native voters. Those voters \nhave limited mobility, lack access personal or public transportation, and face financial and time \nconstraints that make traveling to a polling location to drop off an absentee ballot challenging. The \nElection Day Cutoff requires these voters, in particular, to choose between submitting their ballots \nabundantly early, often before they are aware of all of the facts that might influence their decision, \nor submitting their ballots potentially too late. \n71.  While Montana has a legitimate regulatory interest in a cutoff for receiving ballots \nin general, the State derives no meaningful benefit from imposing the Election Day Cutoff, \nparticularly where it has encouraged over 70 percent of its electorate to vote by mail. Further, \nMontana does not have a deadline by when it must certify final election results. Accordingly, \nMontana would suffer no significant administrative burden if it, at a minimum, extended that same \nfive-business-day deadline to permit for the receipt of ballots that were postmarked on or before \nElection Day, but which arrive within five business days after the election. In fact, the extension \nof the deadline would likely decrease administrative burdens and improve election outcomes in \nMontana by providing the State and counties with the opportunity to count all votes cast in close \nraces, avoiding potential recount and post-election litigation costs. Montana thus has no legitimate \ninterest, and certainly no compelling interest that is narrowly drawn, in rejecting ballots that are \npostmarked before or on Election Day and which are received within, at a minimum, five business \ndays after Election Day.  \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 22 \n\n \n72.  In short, Montana’s Election Day Cutoff is not supported by a state interest that is \nsufficient to justify the resulting burden on the right to vote and thus unduly burdens the right to \nvote of Montana voters in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \nCOUNT III \nMontana Constitution, Article II, §§ 6, 7 \nAbsentee Ballot Assistance Ban and Registration Requirement - Infringement on Speech and \nExpression Rights \n \n73.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n74.  Article II, § 6 of the Montana Constitution provides that “[t]he people shall have \nthe right peaceably to assemble, petition for redress or peaceably protest government action.” And \nArticle II, § 7 provides that “[n]o law shall be passed impairing the freedom of speech or \nexpression.”  Together  these  provisions,  like  the  First  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution, protect “the unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and \nsocial changes desired by the people.” Dorn v. Bd. of Trs. of Billings Sch. Dist. No. 2 (1983), 203 \nMont. 136, 145, 661 P.2d 426, 431. \n75.  Other state courts and the federal courts interpreting analogous provisions of state \nand federal constitutions have held that activities aimed at encouraging voters to participate in the \npolitical process are constitutionally protected speech and association. See Buckley v. Am. Const’l \nLaw Found., 525 U.S. 182, 186 (1999); Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 421 (1988). \n76.  For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has applied “exacting scrutiny” to review \nlaws governing election-related speech. See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, \n345 (1995); see also League of Women Voters v. Hargett, 400 F. Supp. 3d 706, 722 (M.D. Tenn. \n2019)  (“[L]aws  that  govern  the  political  process  surrounding  elections—and,  in  particular, \nelection-related speech and association—go beyond merely the intersection between voting rights \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 23 \n\n \nand election administration, veering instead into the area where ‘the First Amendment has its \nfullest and most urgent application.’”) (quoting Eu v. San Francisco Cty. Democratic Cent. \nComm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989)). Thus, restrictions on such speech are unconstitutional when \nthey “significantly inhibit” election-related speech and association and are “not warranted by the \nstate interests . . . alleged to justify [the] restrictions.” Buckley, Inc., 525 U.S. at 192. \n77.  Voter turnout efforts, including organized efforts to help voters submit absentee \nballots, are a means by which Plaintiffs communicate their belief in the power and importance of \nparticipating in democratic elections. Federal courts have held that such activity is “the type of \ninteractive communication concerning political change that is appropriately described as ‘core \npolitical speech.’” Meyer, 486 U.S. at 422-23. See League of Women Voters, 400 F. Supp. 3d at \n720 (“Encouraging others to register to vote is pure speech, and, because that speech is political in \nnature, it is a core First Amendment activity.”) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \nThe act of assisting voters to complete and submit ballots is inherently expressive, and an \nindividual  or  organization  that  conducts  such  activities  engages  in  protected  speech  by \nencouraging voting. See Bernbeck v. Moore, 126 F.3d 1114, 1115 (8th Cir. 1997) (rejecting the \nargument that regulating an election “process” raises no First Amendment concerns). \n78.  Furthermore, under analogous provisions of the United States Constitution, First \nAmendment rights “include the right to band together for the advancement of political beliefs.” \nHadnott v. Amos, 394 U.S. 358, 364 (1969). “An organization’s attempt to broaden the base of \npublic participation in and support for its activities is conduct ‘undeniably central to the exercise \nof the right of association.’” Am. Ass’n of People with Disabilities v. Herrera, 690 F. Supp. 2d \n1183, 1202 (D.N.M. 2010) (citing Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214-15 \n(1986)). \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 24 \n\n \n79.  The conversations and interactions between Plaintiffs, their members, and voters \nsurrounding  the submission  of  absentee ballots are forms  of protected political  speech and \nassociation under the Montana Constitution, as they are under analogous provisions of the U.S. \nConstitution. See Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30 (1968) (describing the “overlapping” rights \n“of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs” and “of qualified voters . . . \nto cast their votes effectively”); Project Vote v. Blackwell, 455 F. Supp. 2d 694, 700 (N.D. Ohio \n2006) (explaining that “participation in voter registration implicates a number of both expressive \nand associational rights which . . . belong to—and may be invoked by—not just the voters seeking \nto register, but by third parties who encourage participation in the political process through \nincreasing voter registration rolls”). Thus, by limiting most of Plaintiffs’ and others’ ability to \nassist voters to collectively submit absentee ballots, the Absentee Ballot Assistance Bans burden \nthe speech and associational rights of Plaintiffs, their members, and their volunteers. \n80.  Moreover, the threat of significant fines for violating these laws deters individuals \nfrom participating in Plaintiffs’ GOTV efforts and has a chilling effect on the entirety of Plaintiffs’ \nGOTV efforts, including their speech. See League of Women Voters, 400 F. Supp. 3d at 720 (noting \nthat the threat of civil penalties “is likely to have a chilling effect on the entirety of [a voter \nregistration] drive, including its communicative aspects.”). \n81.  The restrictions on absentee ballot collection services also specifically targets \nPlaintiffs’  and  other  organizations’  associational  activity,  prohibiting  political  speech  and \nexpressive conduct precisely because organizations are engaging in too much disfavored speech \nand associational conduct.  \n82.  These burdens are severe, and the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and Registration \nRequirement are not narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest and thus represent an \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 25 \n\n \noverbroad restriction on political speech and political organizing that infringes Plaintiffs’ and other \nMontanans’ rights under the Montana Constitutions.  \nCOUNT IV \nMontana Constitution, Article II, § 17 \nAbsentee Ballot Assistance Ban and Registration Requirement - Denial of Procedural Due \nProcess \n \n83.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n84.  Article II, § 17 of the Montana Constitution prohibits the states from depriving a \nperson of “life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Deciding what protections are due \nin a given case requires a careful analysis of the importance of the rights and the other interests at \nstake. See Goble v. Montana State Fund, 2014 MT 99, ¶ 46, 374 Mont. 453, 467-68, 325 P.3d \n1211, 1223 (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976)). Specifically, it requires \nconsidering: (1) the nature of “the interest that will be affected” by the government’s action, (2) \n“the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used” as well as the \n“probable  value,  if  any,  of  additional  or  substitute  procedural  safeguards,”  and  (3)  the \ngovernment’s interest. Id. (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. at 347). Overall, “due process is flexible \nand calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.” Mathews, 424 U.S. \nat 334 (quotation and citation omitted).  \n85.  The right to vote—and the right to have that voted counted—is a precious liberty \ninterest. Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670. And the degree of potential \ndeprivation is at its height because Montana’s absentee voting procedures do not adequately \nprotect against complete disenfranchisement. Voters who rely on voting absentee because they \nhave work, school, or childcare obligations, live prohibitively far from polling locations, or do not \nhave access to personal or public transportation, now can no longer rely on organized assistance \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 26 \n\n \nreturning their absentee ballot, and might not have a friend or neighbor willing to register to assist \nthem. Those voters face complete deprivation of the most important liberty interest: the liberty \ninterest that protects all other basic civil and political rights. \n86.  Further, Montana’s absentee voting procedures will result in erroneous deprivation \nbecause the terms are arbitrary and vague. The restrictions arbitrarily limit a single person from \nhelping more than six voters. There is no significance to the number six and surely the seventh \nvoter in need of assistance poses no greater threat to election integrity than the sixth. Nonetheless, \nthat seventh voter is arbitrarily and unfairly prevented from receiving assistance. Even the sections \nof the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban that permit some individuals to assist voters in returning \ntheir absentee ballots are likely to result in arbitrary and unfair treatment. The complete ban on \nabsentee ballot assistance does not apply to an “acquaintance” of the voter. But acquaintance is \nmerely defined as “an individual known by the voter.” One voter could sincerely believe a person \nshe met several minutes earlier is an “individual known” by her. Another voter might not. \n87.  The restrictions also treat different forms of absentee ballot assistance differently: \nif a person assists five of his family members by depositing their absentee ballots in United States \nPostal Service mailbox, that person is not required to register with an election official. Nothing in \nthe law prevents someone from putting a stamp on someone else’s ballot and dropping it off at a \npost office. But a person who assists a single family member by returning her ballot to a polling \nlocation is required to provide his signature, name, address, and telephone number, as well as the \nvoter’s name and address, and must describe his relationship to the voter to a poll worker.  \n88.  Finally, the State has no interest in continuing to enforce the Absentee Ballot \nAssistance Ban and Registration Requirement. Substituting procedural  safeguards, including \nadopting the practices already voluntarily implemented by groups providing organized ballot \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 27 \n\n \nreturn assistance, would effectuate the state’s interest in regulating absentee ballots. Conversely, \nthe public interest in ensuring that all voters have access to fair absentee voting is clear. Montana \nrecognized the same twenty years ago, when it became the fifteenth state to permit no-excuse \nabsentee voting.  \nCOUNT V \nMontana Constitution, Article II, § 17 \nElection Day Cutoff - Denial of Procedural Due Process \n \n89.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n90.  The Election Day Cutoff also fails to provide adequate process to ensure that voters’ \nballots are fairly considered and counted. Montana’s procedures for counting absentee ballots too \noften deprive voters of having their ballot counted because (1) some voters do not learn of the \nElection Day Cutoff at all; (2) postal mail delivery timeframes are not guaranteed and vary between \ndifferent communities, with rural communities often experiencing longer delivery timeframes than \nvoters living in larger cities, resulting in otherwise similarly situated voters facing different \neffective mailing deadlines; and (3) even voters who are aware of the Election Day Cutoff and \nreturn their absentee ballots by postal mail will not have their ballots counted even if, through no \nfault of their own, the ballot does not arrive at the county recorder’s office by 8 p.m. on Election \nDay. Montana’s Election Day Cutoff further deprives all voters who vote by mail of the ability to \ncast a meaningful and informed vote by requiring voters to cast their ballots a full week (or more) \nbefore Election Day if they wish to ensure that their ballots will actually be counted.  \n91.  Montana’s Election Day Cutoff is neither a reliable nor fair way to administer \nvoting by mail. Absentee voters who return their ballot by mail do not reliably know that their \nballot will be counted. Montana elections officials can only offer voters their best guess of when \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 28 \n\n \nvoters must place their ballots in the mail for it to be counted. The Election Day Cutoff is unfair \nbecause it effectively requires some voters to cast their ballots before the rest of the electorate if \nthey wish to be afforded the same process as other voters in the State and to have their votes \ncounted. The Election Day Cutoff is also unfair to all Montana voters who vote absentee by mail \nbecause it requires them to cast their ballot without complete information.  \n92.  The value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards to ensure that the votes \nof Montana’s absentee voters are both meaningfully cast and actually counted is readily apparent. \nA substitute procedure—requiring mail ballots to be postmarked on or before Election Day and \nreceived by the county within, at a minimum, five business days after Election Day to be counted—\nsolves the inequities inherent in Montana’s Election Day Receipt Deadline. A postmark date not \nonly offers a reliable date to Montana voters by which they must cast their ballots, but it also \nensures that rural voters and minority voters are not more likely to have their ballot rejected simply \nbecause they live in a town with slower mail service. A postmark date additionally ensures that all \nof Montana’s voters can consider any information that may arise and influence voters’ choices in \nthe last week of the election. \n93.  Because Montana is not required to finalize its election results within a certain time \nperiod after the election, accepting ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day and which \narrive,  at  a  minimum,  within  five  business  days  of  Election  Day  would  put  a  minimal \nadministrative burden on the state, if any. And as the United States Supreme Court has explained, \n“administrative convenience” cannot justify the deprivation of a constitutional right. See Taylor v. \nLouisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 535 (1975).  \n94.  Having induced its citizens to vote by mail over the past two decades, Montana \nmust establish adequate procedures to ensure that voters have a reliable, fair, and effective method \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 29 \n\n \nto cast their ballots. Because Montana’s Election Day Cutoff is markedly inadequate in all of those \nrespects, and Montana is readily capable of instituting a substitute procedure which would protect \nthose voters’ rights with minimal burden to the state, Montana’s Election Day Cutoff violates \nMontana voters’ procedural due process rights.  \nCOUNT V \nMontana Constitution, Article II, § 17 \nAbsentee Ballot Assistance Ban - Void for Vagueness \n \n95.  Plaintiffs  reallege  and  reincorporate  by  reference  all  prior  paragraphs  of  this \nComplaint and the paragraphs in the counts below as though fully set forth herein. \n96.  Article II, § 17 of the Montana Constitution requires that Montana statutes provide \n“a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.” State v. \nStanko, 1998 MT 321, ¶ 22, 292 Mont. 192, 974 P.2d 1132, 1136 (citations omitted). That is \nbecause “[n]o person should be required to speculate” whether her contemplated course of action \nmay be subject to penalties. Id. A statute can be unconstitutionally vague in two ways: (1) the \nstatute can be so vague that it is void on its face, or (2) the statute can be vague as applied in a \nparticular situation. Id. at ¶ 17. The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban is vague in both ways. \n97.  The Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to \ndefine “acquaintance” sufficiently. Acquaintance is merely defined as “an individual known by \nthe voter.” Mont. Code § 13-35-702(1). One voter could sincerely believe a person she met several \nminutes earlier is an “individual known” by her. Another voter might not. The Absentee Assistance \nBan does not provide a person of ordinary intelligence sufficient notice of who is allowed to assist \nwhom with their absentee ballot and who is not.   \n98.  Additionally, the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban is unconstitutionally vague as \napplied in particular circumstances. For instance, the Ban defines “family member” as means “an \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF – 30 \n\n \nindividual who is related to the voter by blood, marriage, adoption, or legal guardianship.” Mont. \nCode § 13-35-702(4). But that definition does not provide adequate guidance to voters in many \nNative American communities, for whom the term “family member” encompasses persons who \nmay not clearly fall within the scope of “relat[ion] . . . by blood [or] marriage.” \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment:  \nA.  Declaring that Montana’s Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and Election Day Cutoff \nviolate the Montana Constitution;  \nB.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Secretary of State and his agents, \nofficers, employees, successors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them, from \nenforcing the Absentee Ballot Assistance Ban and Election Day Cutoff; and  \nC.

Harris, Presiding Judge. \nFor Appellant: Timothy C. Fox, Montana Attorney General, J. Stuart Segrest, Civil Bureau \nChief, Aislinn W. Brown, Hannah E. Tokerud, Assistant Attorneys General, Helena, \nMontana. \nFor Appellee: Peter Michael Meloy, Meloy Law Firm, Helena, Montana, Matthew Gordon, \nPerkins Coie, LLP, Seattle, Washington. \nFor Intervenors: Alex Rate, Lillian Alvernaz, ACLU of Montana, Missoula, Montana. \n388*388 Justice Beth Baker delivered the Opinion of the Court. \n¶1 Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton appeals a Thirteenth Judicial District Court \norder that temporarily enjoined two Montana election laws, one requiring absentee ballots to \nbe returned to local election offices no later than 8:00 p.m. on Election Day and the other \nrestricting the delivery of such ballots by persons other than the elector. We stayed the \ncourt's injunction on the first issue shortly before the June 3, 2020 primary election, and we \nnow reverse its preliminary injunction against the election-day ballot deadline. Applying the \nsame standard of review, we affirm the preliminary injunction against the ballot-delivery \nrestriction. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n¶2 The case comes before this Court following a preliminary injunction hearing and order in \nfavor of Appellees Robyn Driscoll, the Montana Democratic Party, and the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee (collectively \"Democrats\"). They filed a Complaint in \nYellowstone County District Court against Appellant Corey Stapleton in his official capacity \nas Secretary of State (\"Secretary\") on March 13, 2020; the case was assigned to the \nHonorable Donald L. Harris. Democrats alleged the unconstitutionality of the Ballot \n\nInterference Prevention Act (\"BIPA\"), Tit. 13, ch. 35, part 7, MCA, and the election-day \nballot deadline (\"Ballot Deadline\") found in §§ 13-13-201(3), 13-13-211(3), and 13-19-\n106(5)(b), MCA. The Complaint alleged constitutional violations against the fundamental \nright to vote, the right to speak and associate, and the right to due process. Democrats' \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction sought to enjoin BIPA and the Ballot Deadline during the \npendency of the case. A related case, Western Native Voice v. Stapleton, DV-2020-377, \nwas filed the day before—also in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court for Yellowstone \nCounty—alleging the same constitutional infirmities of BIPA. Plaintiffs in that case, assigned \nto the Honorable Jessica Fehr, are Western Native Voice, Montana Native Vote, \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck, Blackfeet Nation, Confederated Salish and \nKootenai Tribes, Crow Tribe, and Fort Belknap Indian Community (collectively \"WNV\"), and \nDefendant is the Secretary in his official capacity. \n¶3 BIPA was introduced in the 2017 Montana Legislature with an asserted purpose of \nprotecting election integrity and instilling 389*389 voter confidence in the election process. \nThe bill's sponsor said during legislative committee hearings that he had brought the bill \nbecause of voters' suspicions and concerns he had received over ballot-collection activity. \nThe bill received no public testimony in support but significant testimony in opposition. No \none testified to specific instances of voter fraud or ballot tampering.[1] BIPA passed both \nhouses of the Legislature, and Montana voters approved it as a legislative referendum on \nNovember 6, 2018. It has not yet been in effect for a statewide general election. \n¶4 Under BIPA's provisions, absentee ballots, voted or unvoted, may be collected from \nindividual voters only by certain persons, including election officials, postal workers, or the \nvoter's family members, household members, caregivers, or acquaintances. Section 13-35-\n703, MCA. With the exception of election officials and postal workers, these enumerated \nindividuals are limited to collecting and conveying up to six ballots during an election cycle; \nthey must sign a registry upon delivery of the ballots, providing their name, address, phone \nnumber, relationship to each voter, the voter's name, and the voter's address. Sections 13-\n35-703(3), 13-35-704, MCA. Violation of BIPA's restrictions carries a fine of $500 for each \nballot collected unlawfully. Section 13-35-705, MCA. \n¶5 Democrats allege that BIPA places an unconstitutional barrier between the polls and \ncertain voting groups that likely would not have their votes counted without the ballot-\ncollection efforts the law now prohibits. Since no-excuse absentee ballots first were \npermitted in 1999, there has been a significant increase in absentee ballot use in Montana. \nDemocrats showed that in 2018, over 73 percent of votes in Montana were cast by \nabsentee ballots. Democrats presented evidence before the District Court to demonstrate \ncertain distinct voting groups' reliance on this option for voting and the accompanying \norganized and unorganized ballot-collection efforts, including: senior and disabled voters \nwho may have trouble with transportation, standing in line, or the unavailability of a \ncaregiver to assist them; first-time student voters, who often are less familiar with the voting \nprocess; and working students, working parents, or low-wage workers, who may not have \nthe time or availability to vote in person. \n¶6 Democrats also presented evidence to demonstrate that the importance of absentee \nballots and ballot-collection efforts is more significant for Native American voters than for \nany other group. Disregarding BIPA's possible impact, Native American voters as a group \n\nface significant barriers to voting: many live far away from county elections offices and \npostal centers;[2] many have limited access to transportation; many have limited access to \npostal services, lacking residential mailing services and using Post Office boxes instead, \nwhich brings associated costs and travel; mail for those living on reservations may take \nlonger to reach its destination than for other voters in the state; some reservations lack a \nuniform and consistent addressing system, which makes it difficult for residents to register \nto vote; and many experience higher rates of poverty. Further, despite satellite voting \nlocations on some reservations, this requires tribes to submit annual written requests, a \nsignificant administrative hurdle, and typically those locations still are located quite far from \nmany Native American voters. Democrats argued that these barriers have led to the \ndisenfranchisement of a significant number of Native American voters. \n¶7 By using absentee ballots and organized ballot collection efforts, Democrats contend, \nindividual Native American voters and organizations like Western Native Voice have been \nsuccessful in overcoming many of these barriers to allow Native Americans to exercise their \nright to vote in Montana. According to Western Native Voice, it and other \nsimilar 390*390 organizations' overall efforts (including canvassing, education, ballot-\ncollection, and similar efforts) have led to increased Native American voter turnout. \nCompared to the 2014 midterm election, 7,704 more tribal community members voted in the \n2018 election with an increase on each reservation within Montana: from 39% to 70% in \nFort Belknap, 47% to 68% in CSKT, 32% to 59% in Fort Peck, 33% to 59% in Blackfeet, \n29% to 57% in Crow, 23% to 51% in Rocky Boy's, and 30% to 50% in Northern Cheyenne. \nReferenced by Democrats in their argument below and on appeal was the evidence that \nmany Native Americans living on reservations pool their ballots together with one family or \ncommunity member who will collect and deliver them. Thus, Democrats argue, BIPA's \nprohibition on who may collect ballots and how many ballots may be collected presents a \nnew challenge to these ongoing efforts. \n¶8 Unlike BIPA, the Ballot Deadline has been in place through numerous election cycles. \nEven before it was codified in 2011, election officials followed the same deadline as a \nmatter of policy. The statute requires that absentee ballots be received in the proper \nelection offices by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day, regardless of when they were mailed. Section \n13-13-201(3), MCA. There are very limited exceptions, including federal write-in absentee \nballots for military and overseas voters. Section 13-21-206(c), MCA. The Secretary \ncontested Democrats' effort to enjoin the Ballot Deadline on the ground that it provides \nuniformity, fairness, clarity, and expediency in determining election results. In response, \nDemocrats presented evidence of the variability and inconsistency of mail delivery as well \nas misunderstanding and confusion over when ballots must be mailed, which the District \nCourt found may lead to burdens for first-time voters, persons with less education, and \npersons who historically have relied on ballot-collection services. \n¶9 The District Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on May 22, 2020, \nroughly ten days before the primary election. It granted Democrats' motion and enjoined \nBIPA and the Ballot Deadline until a trial on the permanent injunction could be held. The \nDistrict Court found that Democrats had made a prima facie showing that the challenged \nstatutes may violate the right to vote under Montana's constitution based on credible \nevidence that the laws would: \n\nsignificantly suppress voter turnout by disproportionately burdening voters who are Native \nAmerican, elderly, disabled, poor, parents working low-wage jobs, college students, first-\ntime voters, and voters who have historically relied on GOTV and ballot collection services \nlike those provided by Western Native Voice, MontPIRG, Disability Rights Montana, \nForward Montana, Montana Conservation Voters, unionized labor, and the Montana \nDemocratic Party. \n¶10 The day the court issued the preliminary injunction, the Secretary moved for a stay with \nrespect to the Ballot Deadline, making no similar request as to the preliminary injunction \nagainst BIPA. The Secretary filed both an appeal with this Court and a Petition for Writ of \nSupervisory Control on May 26, 2020. On May 27, 2020, this Court denied supervisory \ncontrol but stayed the preliminary injunction against the Ballot Deadline and ordered \nexpedited briefing to ensure a decision in time for the November election preparations. \n¶11 Meanwhile, WNV similarly sought a preliminary injunction against BIPA. On May 20, \n2020, Judge Fehr entered a temporary restraining order enjoining BIPA; she followed with a \npreliminary injunction on July 7, 2020. The Secretary appealed Judge Fehr's preliminary \ninjunction, and that appeal is pending. Western Native Voice, et al. v. Stapleton, S. Ct. No. \nDA 20-0394. Due to the unlikelihood that their case would proceed to appeal in time for the \nNovember election preparations, WNV filed an Unopposed Motion to Intervene in this \nappeal on June 12, 2020. We granted the motion on June 18, 2020.[3] \n STANDARD OF REVIEW \n391*391\n¶12 We review a district court's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for a manifest \nabuse of discretion. Davis v. Westphal, 2017 MT 276, ¶ 10, 389 Mont. 251, 405 P.3d 73. \"A \nmanifest abuse of discretion is one that is `obvious, evident, or unmistakable.'\" Weems v. \nState, 2019 MT 98, ¶ 7, 395 Mont. 350, 440 P.3d 4 (quoting Davis, ¶ 10). If the decision on \na preliminary injunction was based on legal conclusions, however, we review those \nconclusions to determine if the district court's interpretation of the law is correct. City of \nWhitefish v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs of Flathead Cty., 2008 MT 436, ¶ 7, 347 Mont. 490, 199 \nP.3d 201. Finally, \"[i]n considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction, neither the \n[d]istrict [c]ourt nor this Court will determine the underlying merits of the case giving rise to \nthe preliminary injunction, as such an inquiry is reserved for a trial on the merits.\" BAM \nVentures, LLC v. Schifferman, 2019 MT 67, ¶ 7, 395 Mont. 160, 437 P.3d \n142 (citing Caldwell v. Sabo, 2013 MT 240, ¶ 19, 371 Mont. 328, 308 P.3d 81). \nDISCUSSION \n¶13 Section 27-19-201, MCA, allows a party to obtain a preliminary injunction by \ndemonstrating the criteria of one of its five subsections. These subsections are disjunctive; \na court need find just one subsection satisfied in order to issue a preliminary \ninjunction. BAM Ventures, ¶ 14 (citing collected cases). The District Court found that \nDemocrats met the first two subsections, which provide for a preliminary injunction: \n\n(1) when it appears that the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded and the relief or any \npart of the relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act complained \nof, either for a limited period or perpetually; [or] \n(2) when it appears that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation \nwould produce a great or irreparable injury to the applicant[.] \nSection 27-19-201(1)-(2), MCA. \n¶14 In considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a district court must exercise \nits otherwise broad discretion only \"in furtherance of the limited purpose of [a] preliminary \ninjunction[:] to preserve the status quo and minimize the harm to all parties pending final \nresolution on the merits.\" Davis, ¶ 24 (emphasis omitted, citing Porter v. K & S P'ship, 192 \nMont. 175, 183, 627 P.2d 836, 840 (1981)); see also BAM Ventures, ¶ 16; Yockey v. \nKearns Properties, LLC, 2005 MT 27, ¶ 18, 326 Mont. 28, 106 392*392 P.3d 1185. The \n\"status quo\" is the \"last actual, peaceable, non[-]contested condition which preceded the \npending controversy.\" Benefis Healthcare v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, 2006 MT 254, ¶ 14, \n334 Mont. 86, 146 P.3d 714 (internal quotations, citations omitted); see also BAM \nVentures, ¶ 18; State v. BNSF Ry. Co., 2011 MT 108, ¶ 17, 360 Mont. 361, 254 P.3d 561. \n\"If a preliminary injunction will not accomplish its limited purposes, then it should not \nissue.\" Davis, ¶ 24 (brackets omitted, quoting Porter, 192 Mont. at 183, 627 P.2d at 840). \n¶15 Beyond that, a district court need find only that an applicant made a prima facie \nshowing she will suffer a harm or injury—\"whether under the `great or irreparable injury' \nstandard of subsection (2), or the lesser degree of harm implied within the other \nsubsections of § 27-19-201, MCA.\" BAM Ventures, ¶ 16. Prima facie is defined as \"at first \nsight\" or \"on first appearance but subject to further evidence or information.\" Weems, ¶ 18 \n(quoting prima facie, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)). For the purposes of a \npreliminary injunction, the loss of a constitutional right constitutes an irreparable \ninjury. See Montana Cannabis Industry Ass'n v. State, 366 Mont. 224, ¶ 15, 286 P.3d 1161 \n(2012). \n¶16 A statute enjoys a presumption of constitutionality. See City of Billings v. Cty. Water \nDist., 281 Mont. 219, 227, 935 P.2d 246, 250 (1997). Because a preliminary injunction does \nnot decide the ultimate merits of a case, however, a party need establish only a prima facie \nviolation of its rights to be entitled to a preliminary injunction—even if such evidence \nultimately may not be sufficient to prevail at trial. See City of Billings, 281 Mont. at 227, 935 \nP.2d at 251; see also Weems, ¶ 18; City of Whitefish, ¶¶ 25-26; 11A Charles Alan Wright, \nArthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.3, 201 (3d ed. \n2013) (\"All courts agree that a plaintiff must present a prima facie case but need not show a \ncertainty of winning\"); Davis v. Stapleton, CV 20-62-H-DLC, 2020 WL 4815083, *5-6, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 150267, *12 (D. Mont. Aug. 19, 2020) (observing that \"when the balance \nof equities tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor, the plaintiff need demonstrate only `serious \nquestions going to the merits'\") (citations omitted). \n¶17 With the foregoing in mind, we will affirm the preliminary injunction if the record shows \nthat Democrats demonstrated either a prima facie case that they will suffer some degree of \nharm and are entitled to relief (§ 27-19-201(1), MCA) or a prima facie case that they will \nsuffer an \"irreparable injury\" through the loss of a constitutional right (§ 27-19-201(2), MCA). \n\nWe must conclude that by enjoining BIPA and the Ballot Deadline, or either of them, the \nDistrict Court preserved the status quo and minimized the harm to both parties pending a \nfinal resolution of the matter on the merits. Davis, ¶ 24. Our analysis as to each statute \nfollows. \n1. Did the District Court err by enjoining BIPA? \n¶18 When determining whether an applicant has made a prima facie showing of \nconstitutional injury or appears to be entitled to the relief sought, a court may determine with \nwhich level of scrutiny to evaluate the challenged statute. See MCIA I, ¶ 16. \"The extent to \nwhich the Court's scrutiny is heightened depends both on the nature of the interest and the \ndegree to which it is infringed.\" Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. 287, 302, 911 P.2d 1165, \n1173 (1996) (citing Memorial Hosp. v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250, 254-56, 94 S. Ct. \n1076, 1080-81, 39 L.Ed.2d 306 (1974)). The most stringent level of scrutiny, and the one \nemployed by the District Court, is strict scrutiny, used when a statute implicates a \nfundamental right found in the Montana Constitution's declaration of rights. MCIA I, ¶ \n16; see generally Mont. Const. art. II. \"Strict scrutiny of a statute is required only when the \nclassification impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental \nright.\" Wadsworth, 275 Mont. at 302, 911 P.2d at 1174 (citing Arneson v. State, By Dept. of \nAdmin., 262 Mont. 269, 272, 864 P.2d 1245, 1247 (1993)). Under strict scrutiny, statutes \nwill be found unconstitutional \"unless the State can demonstrate that such laws are \nnecessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.\" Finke v. State ex \nrel. 393*393 McGrath, 2003 MT 48, ¶ 15, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576 (internal quotations \nand emphasis omitted, quoting Johnson v. Killingsworth, 271 Mont. 1, 4, 894 P.2d 272, 273-\n74 (1995)). Middle-tier scrutiny is used \"[i]f a law or policy affects a right conferred by the \nMontana Constitution, but is not found in the Constitution's declaration of rights.\" MCIA I, ¶ \n16 (citing Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., 2004 MT 390, ¶ 18, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d \n445). Under middle-tier scrutiny, the State must demonstrate that the law is reasonable and \nthat the need for the law outweighs the value of the right to the individual. Snetsinger, ¶ 18. \n¶19 Here, the Secretary argues the District Court erred by applying strict scrutiny when \nevaluating BIPA. The right to vote in any manner, the Secretary maintains, is not absolute \nand must be balanced against the regulatory power the constitution confers on the \nLegislature. The Montana Constitution directs the Legislature to \"provide by law the \nrequirements for residence, registration, absentee voting, and administration of elections\" \nand to \"insure the purity of elections and guard against abuses of the electoral process.\" \nMont. Const. art. IV, § 3. In light of this directive, the Secretary urges this Court to adopt the \nmore flexible balancing approach set forth in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 103 S. \nCt. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983), and Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 112 S. Ct. 2059, \n119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992).[4] \n¶20 At this stage of the proceedings, we find it unnecessary to set forth a new level of \nscrutiny. The case is not before us on a full evidentiary record for evaluation of the ultimate \nmerits. We conclude that, for purposes of resolving the instant preliminary injunction \ndispute, the level of scrutiny is not dispositive to the issues presented on appeal. \n¶21 Noting that voters have come to rely on ballot-collection services, Democrats argue that \nBIPA will disproportionately affect the right of suffrage for certain subgroups, including \n\nNative Americans, rural and elderly voters, students with full-time jobs, low-wage workers, \nworking parents, disabled voters, and first-time voters. Democrats presented evidence of \nincreased Native American voter turnout between the 2014 and 2018 elections due to the \nefforts of organizations like Western Native Voice that do ballot-collection work on \nreservations. The District Court found that the evidence of various factors contributing to \nunequal access to the polls for Native American voters would be exacerbated by BIPA, \nburdening this subgroup's constitutional right to vote. \n¶22 The Secretary asserts on appeal, as he did before the District Court, that the State has \nimportant interests to ensure voter confidence in the electoral process and to guard against \nabuses of that process. But he did not present evidence in the preliminary injunction \nproceedings of voter fraud or ballot coercion, generally or as related to ballot-collection \nefforts, occurring in Montana. More importantly, the Secretary has pointed to no evidence in \nthe preliminary injunction record that would rebut the District Court's finding of a \ndisproportionate impact on Native American voters, and he leaves the contention largely \nundisturbed in his briefing on appeal. The Secretary's only suggestion is a general one—\nthat the alternative means of returning ballots or of voting in person remain equally available \nto all voters. But this does not address Democrats' evidence that the burden on Native \nAmerican communities is disproportionate, and the Secretary fails to refute the District \nCourt's finding. \n¶23 The Secretary has not demonstrated clear error in the District Court's finding of \nsufficient evidence for a preliminary injunction of a disproportionate burden to Native \nAmerican voters' right against \"interfere[nce with] ... the free exercise of the right of \nsuffrage.\" Mont. Const. art. II, § 13. Democrats' evidence was sufficient to make a prima \nfacie showing of the harm BIPA may impose on Native American voters in particular. On \nreview of the preliminary injunction record, we conclude that the District Court did not err in \nfinding prima facie evidence 394*394 that BIPA may unconstitutionally burden the right of \nsuffrage, particularly with respect to Native American communities, or in concluding that the \nSecretary did not demonstrate an interest that weighed more heavily than the burdens \nDemocrats assert. The court thus did not manifestly abuse its discretion in concluding that a \npreliminary injunction should issue, even under the Anderson-Burdick balancing standard. \n¶24 Finally, the District Court did not err by finding a possibility of irreparable injury absent \nan injunction against BIPA. We are mindful that BIPA was passed in the 2018 general \nelection and has not yet been in effect for a statewide general election. Democrats \npresented evidence of election officials' concerns about the strain BIPA puts on them \nleading up to Election Day, especially in rural counties, and the record before us shows \nuncertainty regarding BIPA's effects on such things as a ballot-collector mailing another \nvoter's ballot, the use of after-hours ballot drop-boxes, or the need for election officials to \nquestion every person returning a ballot. In light of Democrats' evidence, and absent \nevidence of fraudulent ballot collection in Montana elections, preliminarily enjoining BIPA \npending full consideration will minimize the harm to all parties and maintain the status quo \npending final resolution on the merits. Davis, ¶ 24. \n¶25 In sum, we conclude that the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by \ngranting the preliminary injunction against enforcement of BIPA. \n\n2. Did the District Court err by enjoining the Ballot \nDeadline? \n¶26 The \"status quo\" is the last actual, peaceable, non-contested condition preceding the \npending controversy. Benefis, ¶ 14. Here, the contested condition is the 8:00 p.m. election-\nday deadline to have a mailed-in absentee ballot delivered. That condition, however, is the \nlast actual non-contested condition as well. The Ballot Deadline in its current form has been \nin effect since 2011. Before that, the same deadline had been in effect through non-\nstatutory practices of the Secretary of State since at least 2001. Democrats presented no \nevidence that a postmark deadline was in effect before then. \n¶27 That the Ballot Deadline has been in effect in some form or another for at least the last \ntwo decades is not on its own enough to prevent its enjoinment. See Weems, ¶ 26 \n(discussing how the length of time a statute has been on the books is not the relevant \ninquiry in considering a request to enjoin it, and affirming a preliminary injunction that \npreserved a known, uncontested right). But election administrators throughout the state long \nhave relied upon and been trained under the Ballot Deadline, and it is tied to many other \nelection-related functions and deadlines found throughout the election codes. Among these, \nby way of example, are § 13-21-206, MCA, (stating the procedure by which an election \nofficial determines whether to accept a federal write-in ballot by determining whether a \nregular absentee ballot had been received by the Ballot Deadline); § 13-13-245, MCA, \n(concerning notification of an elector with a deficiency in her ballot); and § 13-15-107, MCA, \n(concerning the timeline for a provisionally registered elector to cure any deficiencies in his \nidentification or eligibility information). \n¶28 Neither Democrats nor the District Court took issue with the need for a deadline by \nwhich absentee ballots must be returned. In a tacit recognition of the Secretary's argument \non the importance of clear deadlines, the District Court bootstrapped a remedy by \naffirmatively requiring the Secretary to accept mailed absentee ballots by their postmarked \ndate up until the time the office accepts federal military and overseas ballots. Section 13-21-\n206(1)(c), MCA. The District Court's preliminary injunction not only fails to preserve the \nstatus quo, it substitutes the District Court's choice of deadline for that of the Legislature. \nThe postmark deadline was never the law or the status quo for the general absentee ballots \nat issue. The District Court failed to analyze how the Ballot Deadline would impact other \nrelated election functions and deadlines or to consider whether enjoining the Ballot Deadline \nwould maintain the status quo. Because it would not, we reverse those portions of the \nDistrict Court's order enjoining the Ballot Deadline and mandating 395*395 that absentee \nballots postmarked on or before Election Day be counted as valid provided they are \nreceived by the deadline for federal write-in ballots. \nCONCLUSION \n¶29 The District Court's preliminary injunction against the election-day ballot-receipt \ndeadline prescribed in §§ 13-13-201(3), 13-13-211(3), and 13-19-106(5)(b), MCA, is \nVACATED. The election-day ballot deadline shall remain in effect for the November 3, 2020 \ngeneral election. The District Court's preliminary injunction against the Ballot Interference \n\nPrevention Act, Tit. 13, ch. 35, part 7, MCA, is AFFIRMED, and the Act is enjoined through \nthe November 3, 2020 general election. \nWe Concur: \nMIKE McGRATH, C.J. \nLAURIE McKINNON, J. \nJAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J. \nINGRID GUSTAFSON, J. \nJustice Dirk Sandefur concurring in part and dissenting in part. \n¶30 I concur that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in granting a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining enforcement of §§ 13-13-201(3), -211(3), and 13-19-106(5), MCA \n(absentee ballots Receipt Deadline). However, I disagree with the Majority's holdings that: \n(1) the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in granting the BIPA injunction \nunder strict scrutiny; (2) determination of the applicable level of constitutional scrutiny is not \nnecessary or proper upon review of the correctness of the BIPA injunction; and (3) the \nDistrict Court in any event did not manifestly abuse its discretion in granting the BIPA \ninjunction under intermediate scrutiny. \n¶31 I would contrarily hold that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in granting \nthe BIPA injunction, whether under strict or intermediate constitutional scrutiny, based on \nerroneous findings of fact and conclusions of law that Plaintiffs made an unrebutted prima \nfacie showing that BIPA will likely substantially burden the fundamental right to vote of \nspecified third-parties. I would further hold that the BIPA injunction is erroneous based on \nthe District Court's erroneous recognition and application of the threshold burdens of proof \nand persuasion on a preliminary injunction applicant under § 27-19-201(1)-(2), MCA, and \nthe applicable level of constitutional scrutiny, to make a prima facie showing that a \nchallenged statute is likely unconstitutional as alleged and/or that great or irreparable injury \nis likely, or at least a distinct possibility, absent temporary enjoinder. \nDISCUSSION \n1. Preliminary Injunction Standards — § 27-19-201, \nMCA. \n¶32 Preliminary injunctive relief is an equitable remedy governed by the general principles \nof equity codified in Montana in Title 27, chapter 19, MCA. Davis v. Westphal, 2017 MT 276, \n¶ 23, 389 Mont. 251, 405 P.3d 73 (internal citations omitted). Based on applicable findings \nof fact and conclusions of law, district courts have broad discretion to grant preliminary \ninjunctive relief on any of the five grounds enumerated in § 27-19-201, MCA. Davis, ¶¶ 10 \nand 24. Accord Atkinson v. Roosevelt Cty., 66 Mont. 411, 421, 214 P. 74, 77 (1923) (\"[T]he \n\ncourt must exercise discretion ... according to correct principles of law and evidence.\"). The \nstandard of review of a grant or denial of preliminary injunctive relief is whether the court \nmanifestly abused its discretion. Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., 2003 MT 372, ¶ 11, \n319 Mont. 132, 82 P.3d 912; Atkinson, 66 Mont. at 421, 214 P. at 76-77. An abuse of \ndiscretion occurs if a court exercises discretion based on a mistake of law, clearly \nerroneous finding of fact, or arbitrary reasoning, lacking conscientious judgment or in \nexcess of the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. Montana State Univ.-\nBozeman v. Montana First Jud. Dist. Ct., 2018 MT 220, ¶ 15, 392 Mont. 458, 426 P.3d \n541.[1] A manifest abuse of 396*396 discretion is an abuse of discretion that is \"obvious, \nevident, or unmistakable.\" Shammel, ¶ 12. Whether a district court manifestly abused its \ndiscretion is a question of law reviewed de novo. See Montana State Univ.-Bozeman, ¶ 15. \nHowever, while the grant or denial of temporary injunctive relief is generally subject to \nreview only for a manifest abuse of discretion, and is often critically dependent on the \nparticular facts, circumstances, and equities of each case, district courts have no discretion \nin the determination of predicate questions or applications of law. Krutzfeldt Ranch, LLC v. \nPinnacle Bank, 2012 MT 15, ¶ 13, 363 Mont. 366, 272 P.3d 635; St. James Healthcare v. \nCole, 2008 MT 44, ¶ 21, 341 Mont. 368, 178 P.3d 696; M.H. v. Mont. High Sch. Ass'n, 280 \nMont. 123, 130, 929 P.2d 239, 243 (1996). To the extent that a preliminary injunction is \nbased on a conclusion or application of law, we review the underlying question or \napplication of law de novo for correctness. Weems v. State, 2019 MT 98, ¶ 7, 395 Mont. \n350, 440 P.3d 4; City of Whitefish v. Flathead Cty. Comm'rs ex rel. Brenneman, 2008 MT \n436, ¶ 7, 347 Mont. 490, 199 P.3d 201. \n¶33 Because satisfaction of the grounds for issuance of a preliminary injunction is not an \nadjudication on the merits of any aspect of an underlying claim for relief, Yockey v. Kearns \nProperties, LLC, 2005 MT 27, ¶ 18, 326 Mont. 28, 106 P.3d 1185, an applicant has the \ninitial burden of making a prima facie showing of the asserted basis for the requested \npreliminary injunction under § 27-19-201, MCA. City of Whitefish, ¶ 25; Porter v. K & S \nPartnership, 192 Mont. 175, 181, 627 P.2d 836, 839 (1981). A prima facie showing is no \nmore than a legal and factual showing that would satisfy the claimant's burden of proof or \npersuasion if unrebutted. See Jones v. All Star Painting Inc., 2018 MT 70, ¶ 20, 391 Mont. \n120, 415 P.3d 986; Antonick v. Jones, 236 Mont. 279, 287, 769 P.2d 1240, 1244 \n(1989); State ex rel. Fitzgerald v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 217 Mont. 106, 118-19, 703 \nP.2d 148, 156-57 (1985). The burden then shifts to the opposing party to rebut the \napplicant's prima facie showing. See Porter, 192 Mont. at 182-83, 627 P.2d at 840. \n¶34 In this case, the District Court issued the preliminary BIPA injunction on two distinct \nstatutory grounds—§§ 27-19-201(1) and (2), MCA. I separately address them in turn. \n2. Section 27-19-201(1), MCA—Apparent Entitlement to \nRelief. \n¶35 A preliminary injunction \"may be granted ... when it appears that the applicant is entitled \nto the relief demanded\" on the underlying claim \"and the relief or any part of the relief \nconsists\" of enjoining a predicate act. Section 27-19-201(1), MCA. An applicant for a \npreliminary injunction on this ground thus has the burden of making a prima facie showing \nof entitlement to relief on the predicate claim. See City of Whitefish, ¶ 25; Porter, 192 Mont. \n\nat 181, 627 P.2d at 839. Here, the District Court ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs made an \nunrebutted prima facie showing that they will likely prevail on the merits of their predicate \nclaim that BIPA unconstitutionally burdens or interferes with the fundamental right to vote of \na specified class of Montana voters under Article II, Section 13 of the Montana Constitution. \nNot so. \n¶36 The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law subject to plenary de novo \nreview. City of Missoula v. Duane, 2015 MT 232, ¶ 11, 380 Mont. 290, 355 P.3d 729; Seven \nUp Pete Venture v. State, 2005 MT 146, ¶ 18, 327 Mont. 306, 114 P.3d 1009; Pickens v. \nShelton-Thompson, 2000 MT 131, ¶ 7, 300 Mont. 16, 3 P.3d 603; Woirhaye v. Mont. Fourth \nJud. Dist. Ct., 1998 MT 320, ¶ 7, 292 Mont. 185, 972 P.2d 800. As with other issues of law, \ndistrict courts have no discretion in determining the correct interpretation or application of a \nconstitutional provision. State v. Norquay, 2011 MT 34, ¶ 13, 359 Mont. 257, 248 P.3d 817. \n397*397 ¶37 Statutes are presumed constitutional as a threshold matter of law. Duane C. \nKohoutek, Inc. v. Mont. Dep't of Revenue, 2018 MT 123, ¶ 14, 391 Mont. 345, 417 P.3d \n1105; State v. Stark, 100 Mont. 365, 368-69, 52 P.2d 890, 891 (1935). On the ultimate \nmerits, the presumption of validity is overcome only upon a showing that the challenged \nstatutory provision is clearly unconstitutional under the applicable level of constitutional \nscrutiny. Kershaw v. Montana Dep't of Transp., 2011 MT 170, ¶ 22, 361 Mont. 215, 257 \nP.3d 358; Stratemeyer v. Lincoln Cty., 259 Mont. 147, 149-50, 855 P.2d 506, 508-09 \n(1993); Bd. of R. R. Comm'rs v.

Ct. 2637, 2642-43, 125 \nL.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (state has no burden to demonstrate constitutionality of statute subject \nonly to rational basis scrutiny). \n¶38 There are generally three recognized standards for assessing the alleged \nunconstitutionality of a statute—strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis \nscrutiny. See, e.g., State v. Ellis, 2007 MT 210, ¶ 11, 339 Mont. 14, 167 P.3d \n896; Snetsinger v. Montana Univ. Sys., 2004 MT 390, ¶¶ 17-20, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d \n445; Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v.

Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. 287, 302, 911 P.2d 1165, 1174 \n(1996) (citing Arneson v. Mont. Dept. of Admin., 262 Mont. 269, 272, 864 P.2d 1245, 1247 \n(1993)). A fundamental constitutional right is a right either explicit in the federal or state \n\nconstitution or one manifestly implicit from explicit constitutional rights. Wadsworth, 275 \nMont. at 299, 911 P.2d at 1171-72 (an implicit fundamental right is a non-explicit right \n\"without which other constitutionally guaranteed rights would have little meaning\"—\nquoting Butte Cmty.

Hardman, 297 F.3d 1116, 1127 \n(10th Cir. 2002).[4] \n¶41 Here, based primarily on the affidavit of a political scientist (Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Ph.D.), \nthe District Court first made the unqualified findings of fact that: \nBIPA ... will significantly suppress voter turnout by disproportionately burdening voters who \nare Native Americans, elderly, poor, parents working low-grade jobs, college students, first-\ntime voters who have historically relied on GOTV and ballot collections services like those \nprovided by Western Native Voice, MontPIRG, Disability Rights Montana, Forward \nMontana, Montana Conservation Voters, unionized labor, and the Montana Democratic \nParty. \n... \n[D]uring the current 2020 election cycle, the ... effects of BIPA ... will cause thousands of \nMontanans not to vote. \n\nUpon close inspection, however, the record basis of those key findings amounts to no more \nthan a specified sociological model upon which the political scientist projected that BIPA will \nin fact unduly burden a wide swath of Montana's electorate by requiring them to either \ntimely mail their absentee ballots, arrange for a BIPA-qualified vote collector, or personally \ndeliver their ballots to a polling place. Despite cursory assertion of a causal link, the \nmodeling and referenced data, along with the other anecdotal observations, opinions, and \ncharacterizations obtained 399*399 from various sources,[5] proves no more than a projected \ncorrelation, based on various general assumptions and statistical data, between BIPA and \nthe anticipated turn-out of the specified class of voters. Without more, evidence of a \ncorrelation between an asserted cause and an asserted effect is not evidence of a direct \ncausal link for purposes of assessing the constitutionality of a statute. Brown v. Entm't \nMerchs. Ass'n, 564 U.S. 786, 800, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2739, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011) (rejecting \nCalifornia assertion that psychological studies correlating exposure to violent video games \nto asserted harmful effects on children was competent evidence of a causal link sufficient to \nmanifest a compelling state interest for purposes of strict scrutiny). \n¶42 For example, as to Native Americans, conspicuously absent is any particularized proof \nas to where and to what extent, if any, adequate postal service is in fact unavailable on \nMontana Reservations, whether universally or in specific areas. Aside from the generic \npolitical modeling information and theory provided in the Dr. Mayer Affidavit, Plaintiffs inter \nalia submitted an affidavit regarding the registration, canvassing, and voter assistance \nefforts of political advocacy organizations (Montana Native Vote and Western Native Voice) \non Montana's Indian Reservations, to wit as pertinent to absentee voting: \n• \"During the 2018 election cycle, 80% of the people our organizations contacted as part of \nour non-partisan GOTV effort actually voted. Those efforts included knocking on 33,769 \ndoors, sending 11,064 text messages, registering 2,015 new voters, giving 482 voters rides \nto the polls, and collecting and conveying 853 [absentee] ballots.\" \n• \"Individuals canvassed by us or partner organizations just one time were 4.1% more likely \nto vote, canvassed through face-to-face conversations at their doors multiple times were \n12.2% more likely to vote.\" \n• In 2018, their extensive voter registration, canvassing, and assistance efforts led to \nsignificant increases in overall Reservation voter turnout rates and a 73% turnout rate for \nabsentee voters compared to the 60.3% overall turnout rate on Reservations. \n• Due to the lack of uniform and consistent addressing systems on unspecified \nReservations, county election officials rejected hundreds of voter registration forms \"largely \ndue to inconsistencies in the home addresses provided by tribal registrants.\" \n• \"Most tribal nation residents do not receive mail at home and instead must use a post \noffice box, which is not always free ..., and there are financial barriers associated with \nhaving to travel to collect and post mail and to pay for stamps.\" \n(Emphasis added.) However, as a threshold matter, BIPA did not cause and will not be a \ncause of the noted \"obstacles\" to voting on Montana Reservations. Montana Native \nVote and Western Native Voice assert only that BIPA will \"exacerbate[ ]\" the noted \nproblems. Moreover, the fact that overall Reservation voter turnout has significantly \nincreased due to the extensive registration, canvassing, and voter assistance efforts of \npolitical organizations is not evidentiary support for the District Court's finding that \"BIPA ... \nwill cause thousands of Montanans to not vote.\"[6] To the contrary, the Montana Native \n\nVote/Western Native Voice Affidavit acknowledges that, despite their efforts and noted \nprogress in recent years, \"the return rate for absentee ballots issued in tribal nations \nhas decreased (from 91% in 2012 to 73% in 2018)\" (emphasis added). \n¶43 Plaintiffs' central assertion is that BIPA will likely make it harder to vote for those Native \nAmericans who want to vote absentee, which will then likely cause some 400*400 unknown \nquantum of them not to vote at all in the absence of the previously available mass ballot \ncollection services. However, the Montana Native Vote/Western Native Voice affidavit \nunequivocally states that their absentee ballot collection services, and those provided by \npartner organizations, have not resulted in any increase in Reservation absentee turnout \nsince those services have been available. To the contrary, Reservation absentee turnout \nhas since decreased. In light of that undisputed fact, Plaintiffs have not shown or explained \nhow a BIPA-caused loss of the mass ballot collection services that did not prevent the \nsignificant decline in Reservation absentee turnout over what it was before will likely, or \neven possibly, be a cause of even lower absentee turnout on Montana Reservations. \nConsequently, there is no particularized evidence that BIPA will likely cause any significant \ndecrease in absentee voting for any quantifiable segment of the Native American population \non Montana Reservations, or any other significant class of Montana voters for that matter. \n¶44 Plaintiffs' generalized voting-cost-increase theory, and accompanying anecdotal \nobservations and concerns of election officials and political organizations, proves no more \nthan a highly speculative possibility that some unquantifiable segment of absentee voters, \nwho used previously available mass ballot collection services, might choose not to vote \nrather than timely mail their absentee ballot or use a BIPA-qualified family/friend collector \nlike all other Montanans who choose to vote absentee. Regardless of any disproportionate \nnature of the independently-caused circumstances that may hamper voter turnout in \nMontana, the evidentiary record in this case is devoid of any substantial non-speculative \nevidence that BIPA will likely be a cause of any significant decrease in absentee voter \nturnout among the broad spectrum of Montana voters as alleged by Plaintiffs. The key \nfindings of fact of the District Court regarding the alleged substantial interference or burden \non the right of the specified class of Montanans to vote are thus clearly erroneous. \n¶45 Further troubling, as endorsed by the Majority in its undiscerning gloss-over of Plaintiffs' \npatently deficient evidentiary showing, the District Court made much ado about the fact that \nthe State failed to \"present any evidence to dispute [Plaintiffs'] evidence that BIPA ... \ndisproportionately burden[s] the [specified class of] voters\" and will \"significantly suppress \nvoter turnout by making voting more burdensome and costly for absentee voters.\" However, \nthe lack of a formal evidentiary showing by the State rebutting the limited evidence \npresented by Plaintiffs did nothing to bolster the manifest threshold insufficiency of that \nevidence to make the requisite prima facie showing of a non-speculative causal link \nbetween BIPA and the alleged substantial interference with the specified class's right to \nvote. Nor have Plaintiffs, the District Court, or the Majority articulated any credible support \nfor the legal proposition that the fundamental right to vote necessarily includes the most \nconvenient or most preferable way to vote, or that BIPA will be the direct cause of the \ncircumstances that may make it less convenient or preferable for the specified class to vote. \nThe District Court's conclusion of law that Plaintiffs satisfied their burden of demonstrating \nthat BIPA will substantially burden or interfere with the right of the specified class to vote is \nerroneous.[7] \n\n¶46 Based on the limited affidavit showing made by Plaintiffs and the related finding that the \nState \"failed to present any evidence of absentee ballot collection fraud,\" the District Court \nmade the additional sweeping and unqualified finding of fact that: \nBIPA serves no legitimate purpose: it does not enhance the security or integrity of absentee \nvoting; it does not reduce the 401*401 costs or burdens of conducting elections, it does not \nmake absentee voting easier or more efficient; it does not reduce confusion about absentee \nvoting requirements; and it does not increase voter turnout. \nIn conjunction with its earlier finding and conclusion that Plaintiffs met their threshold burden \nof making a prima facie showing that BIPA \"burden[s] and interfere[s] with the fundamental \nright\" of the specified class to vote, the District Court further concluded as matters of law \nthat \"[t]he State has failed to demonstrate through competent evidence that there is any \ncompelling state interest that warrants the burden and interference on the right to vote \nimposed by BIPA.\" The District Court thus ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs \"are likely to \nprevail on the merits and would be entitled to a permanent injunction\" enjoining \nenforcement of BIPA. \n¶47 However, even on the ultimate merits, satisfaction of strict scrutiny does not necessarily \nrequire the State to make a formal evidentiary showing of a compelling state interest or that \nthe subject statute is narrowly tailored to further that interest.

N.Y. State Univ. Bd. of Trs. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, \n476-78, 109 S. Ct. 3028, 3032-33, 106 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989). Accord State v. \nDemontiney, 2014 MT 66, ¶¶ 16-22, 374 Mont. 211, 324 P.3d 344.[8] \n¶48 The District Court's rationale here is strikingly similar to the rationale we previously \nrejected in Greely when a district court similarly concluded that a voter-approved ballot \n\ninitiative did not pass strict scrutiny because it included no declaration of a compelling state \ninterest and the State \"offered no proof to establish such a need\" in its defense. Greely, 193 \nMont. at 383, 632 P.2d at 303 (internal citation and punctuation omitted). Upon noting that \nthe \"mere recitation of a compelling state interest\" in the enactment would not necessarily \nhave been conclusive in any event, we noted that, while the State presented no \"evidence \nto establish a compelling state interest,\" it nonetheless cited the district court to various \nauthorities from other jurisdictions recognizing a compelling government interest in similar \nlegislation. Greely, 193 Mont. at 383, 632 P.2d at 303. We explained that: \n402*402 Laws regulating or monitoring the raising and spending of money in the political \narena have been enacted throughout the country as well as by the Congress. When these \nlaws have been challenged, the courts have not had difficulty finding a compelling interest \nas a basis for enactment. United States v. Harris[s] (1954), 347 U.S. 612, 625, 74 S. Ct. \n808, 816, 98 L.Ed. 989, 1001 (maintaining the integrity of a basic governmental \nprocess); Young Americans for Freedom, Inc. v. Gorton (1974), 83 Wash.2d 728, 522 P.2d \n189, 192 (informing public officials and the electorate of the sponsors of efforts to influence \ngovernmental decision-making); Plante v. Gonzalez (5th Cir. 1978), 575 F.2d 1119, 1135 ... \n(protecting citizens from abuse of the trust placed in the hands of elected \nofficials); Montgomery County v. Walsh (1975), 274 Md. 502, 336 A.2d 97, 106, appeal \ndismissed (1976), 424 U.S. 901, 96 S. Ct. 1091, 47 L.Ed.2d 306 (fostering a climate of \nhonesty perceptible by the public at large). \nGreely, 193 Mont. at 383-84, 632 P.2d at 303. We noted further that: \nPolitical corruption is a matter of common popular perception, which may or may not reflect \nthe actualities of political life. Judicial notice may be taken of the compelling need for \ndisclosure laws which have as their purpose the deterrence of actual corruption and the \navoidance of appearances of corruption. Buckley v. Valeo (1976), 424 U.S. 1, 67, 96 S. Ct. \n612, 657, 46 L.Ed.2d 659, 715. \nGreely, 193 Mont. at 384, 632 P.2d at 303 (emphasis added). We thus held that: \nThe absence of fact-finding in the initiative process is not proof of the absence of a \ncompelling state interest in the enactment of I-85. To so hold would result in the \nemasculation of the initiative process in Montana with a result that no initiative could \nwithstand a First Amendment challenge. \nGreely, 193 Mont. at 384, 632 P.2d at 303 (emphasis added). As additional indicia of a \ncompelling state interest, we further found \"that the statewide vote on I-85 is a \ndemonstration of a compelling state interest\" insofar that it demonstrated the \"common \nunderstanding\" of the electorate of \"the compelling need for [that] type of \nlegislation.\" Greely, 193 Mont. at 384, 632 P.2d at 303. We thus ultimately held that, without \nrequirement for formal evidentiary support, the State had sufficiently demonstrated a \ncompelling state interest for purposes of strict scrutiny by judicial precedent and the \ncommon understanding of the electorate. Greely, 193 Mont. at 383-84, 632 P.2d at 303. \n¶49 Here, as in Greely, despite the lack of any formal evidentiary showing by the State, \nBIPA is a voter-approved enactment. As in Greely, statewide voter approval of BIPA is \n\nindicative of a compelling state interest insofar that it is indicative of the common \nunderstanding and mandate of the electorate for such legislation. Moreover, as \nin Greely, the State supported its assertion of BIPA's manifest purposes (i.e., \"to prevent \nvoter fraud, protect voters from harassment, ensure voters feel secure in the voting process, \nand protect public integrity in the elections\") by citing the District Court to various federal \nand state authorities recognizing important state interests in maintaining the integrity of and \npublic confidence in the electoral process and protecting against the risk of voter fraud, \nincluding absentee voter fraud. The State further cited the District Court to similar \nenactments in other states, as well as two published papers, and the recommendations of a \nbipartisan commission providing additional factual support consistent with BIPA and the \ncited federal and state authorities. Of significant note, this Court has similarly recognized, \nwithout requirement for evidentiary support, that \"Montana has a compelling interest in \nimposing reasonable procedural requirements tailored to ensure the integrity, reliability, and \nfairness of its election processes.\" Larson v. State, 2019 MT 28, ¶ 40, 394 Mont. 167, 434 \nP.3d 241. As similarly noted by the Supreme Court, \"[c]ommon sense, as well as \nconstitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must play an active role in \nstructuring elections; as a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of \nelections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to \naccompany the democratic 403*403 processes.\" Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433, 112 \nS. Ct. 2059, 2063, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992) (quoting Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730, 94 \nS. Ct. 1274, 1279, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974)—internal punctuation omitted). \n¶50 Regardless of the lack of empirical or scientific methodology as decried in Dr. Mayer's \naffidavit, the District Court further inexplicably failed to even note that the State made an \nirrefutable showing that the Montana Senator (Al Olszewksi) who sponsored the BIPA \nreferendum testified to the legislature, inter alia, that he was motivated by the stated \nconcerns of a small sample of constituents that they had been solicited at their homes by \nthird-party ballot collectors, fearfully relented to the collectors' offers to turn-in their \nabsentee ballots, and were later concerned about the propriety of doing so. Thus, as \nin Greely and based on the totality of the legal and factual information cited by the State \nbelow, the State made an ample showing to the District Court of a legitimate and compelling \nstate interest related to BIPA. \n¶51 Further compounding the District Court's clearly erroneous conclusions of law (that \nPlaintiffs made a prima facie showing that BIPA will substantially burden or interfere with a \nfundamental right and that the State failed to make a responsive showing that BIPA would \nlikely pass strict scrutiny), both the District Court's analysis and the Majority inexplicably \nignore the critical point of law that, when applying for a preliminary injunction, it is the \napplicant's burden under § 27-19-201(1), MCA, to make a prima facie showing not only of \nthe alleged interference with a constitutional right, but also of the applicant-asserted \nlikelihood that the challenged statute will ultimately not pass strict scrutiny. While the \ndefending party has the responsive burden to show that a challenged statute satisfies strict \nscrutiny for purposes of final adjudication on the merits, the applicant for a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining enforcement of a challenged statute has the threshold burden under § \n27-19-201(1), MCA, to overcome the presumed constitutionality of a challenged statute by \nmaking a prima facie showing that it will likely not pass strict scrutiny as alleged. See City of \nBillings v. Billings Heights Water Dist., 281 Mont. 219, 227, 935 P.2d 246, 250 \n(1997). Accord Weems, ¶ 18 (citing City of Billings). Thus, compounding its erroneous \n\nconclusions of law, the District Court more fundamentally erred by failing to recognize the \nmanifest failure of Plaintiffs to meet their threshold burden under § 27-19-201(1), MCA, of \nmaking a prima facie showing that BIPA will not likely satisfy strict scrutiny. Accordingly, the \nDistrict Court's ultimate conclusion of law under § 27-19-201(1), MCA, that Plaintiffs are \nlikely to prevail on the merits of their predicate constitutional claim is erroneous in multiple \nregards. \n(B) Application of Intermediate Scrutiny. \n¶52 In addition to sidestepping the patent insufficiency of Plaintiffs' threshold evidentiary \nshowing by failing to conduct any critical analysis as to its sufficiency as a prima facie \nshowing for a preliminary injunction regarding the asserted constitutional violation, the \nMajority similarly sidesteps yet another fatal defect in the District Court's analysis—the \nerroneous application of strict scrutiny as the standard of constitutional scrutiny applicable \nto both Plaintiffs' claim on the merits and, thus, the sufficiency of their limited evidentiary \nshowing here to satisfy their related burden to make a prima facie showing for a preliminary \ninjunction. As justification for not addressing the applicable level of constitutional scrutiny, \nthe Majority reasons that \"we find it unnecessary\" to address the appropriate level of \nscrutiny applicable here because \"[t]he case is not before us on a full evidentiary record for \nevaluation of the ultimate merits\"—\"the level of scrutiny is not dispositive\" for purposes of \n\"resolving the instant preliminary injunction dispute.\" However, manifesting the critical \nthreshold pertinence of the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny to the preliminary \ninjunction at issue, the Majority then goes on to address the propriety of the BIPA injunction \nunder both strict and intermediate scrutiny. \n¶53 As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs assert, and the District Court concluded, that issuance \nof the BIPA injunction was proper under both § 27-19-201(1) and (2), MCA, because \nPlaintiffs made an unrebutted showing 404*404 that is likely that BIPA will substantially \nburden or interfere with the fundamental voting rights of a broad swath of Montana voters. \nThe Majority's superficial reasoning in avoiding the appropriate level of constitutional \nscrutiny is thus hollow given that that the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny \napplicable to a statute is a pure question of law, and not at all dependent on the state of the \nevidentiary record as to the threshold question of fact as to whether or to what extent, if any, \nthe statute in fact will substantially burden or interfere with the exercise of a fundamental \nconstitutional right. \n¶54 Moreover, the Majority's alternative application of intermediate scrutiny is erroneous in \nany event on two separate grounds. First, aside from the inconsistency between this Court's \n\"middle tier scrutiny\" and the standard of intermediate scrutiny applied by United States \nSupreme Court when applicable, the Majority first misstates intermediate scrutiny as an \noverly-simplified ad hoc case-by-case balancing between the relative weight of the alleged \nburden on the constitutional right at issue and the weight of the asserted government \ninterest. While the application of intermediate scrutiny to substantive due process \nchallenges under federal law remains somewhat unsettled beyond content-neutral speech \nrestrictions,[9] intermediate scrutiny applies upon a direct substantive due process challenge \nif the subject statutory provision is merely a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction \nthat does not substantially burden or interfere with the exercise of the fundamental right at \nissue. See Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 178-81, 123 S. Ct. 2174, 2183-85, 156 \n\nL.Ed.2d 197 (2003) (applying strict scrutiny to statute authorizing involuntary administration \nof medication); Burdick, 504 U.S. at 432-43, 112 S. Ct. at 2062-68 (affirming state \nprohibition on write-in political candidates as a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction \nin furtherance of an important state interest and which did not substantially interfere with the \nexercise of the right to vote); City of Renton, 475 U.S. at 46-55, 106 S. Ct. at 928-\n33 (upholding content-neutral time, place, manner restrictions on commercial sale of \npornography under intermediate scrutiny); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 787-806, \n103 S. Ct. 1564, 1569-79, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983) (applying intermediate scrutiny to \ninvalidate early-filing requirement for political candidates as impermissible restriction on \nfundamental assembly, association, and voting rights); Lutz v. City of York, 899 F.2d 255, \n268-70 (3d Cir. 1990) (applying intermediate scrutiny to time, place, manner restriction on \nnon-explicit fundamental right of freedom of movement); Witt v. Dep't of Air Force, 527 F.3d \n806, 816-21 (9th Cir. 2008); Hutchins v. District of Columbia, 188 F.3d 531, 538 (D.C. Cir. \n1999). In determining the relative reasonableness of a time, place, or manner restriction and \nwhether it substantially burdens or interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, courts \nmust necessarily balance the relative weight of the \"character and magnitude\" of the \nasserted interference or burden upon the subject right against the particular state interest \nasserted as justification therefor and in light of the extent of the asserted necessity for the \nburden or interference. Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434, 112 S. Ct. at 2063-\n64 (citing Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788-89, 103 S. Ct. at 1570, and Tashjian v. Republican \nParty of Connecticut, 479 U.S. 208, 213-14, 107 S. Ct. 544, 547-48, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 \n(1986)). Accord Wadsworth, 275 Mont. at 302, 911 P.2d at 1173-74 (level of applicable \nconstitutional scrutiny depends on the nature of the right at issue and the degree to \nwhich 405*405 the subject statute burdens or interferes with it—citing Memorial Hosp. v. \nMaricopa Cty., 415 U.S. 250, 253, 94 S. Ct. 1076, 1080, 39 L.Ed.2d 306 (1974) and \nLaurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 16-33, at 1610 (2d ed. 1987)). Upon \ndetermination that intermediate scrutiny applies, the subject statutory provision then passes \nintermediate scrutiny only if \"substantially related to an important governmental \nobjective.\" Clark, 486 U.S. at 461, 108 S. Ct. at 1914. Accord Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434, 112 \nS. Ct. at 2063-64 (citing, inter alia, Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788, 103 S. Ct. at 1569-70). \n¶55 Contrary to the Majority's characterization here, Anderson and Burdick did not apply a \nnew or different standard of intermediate scrutiny. They merely applied the Supreme Court's \ntraditional standard of immediate scrutiny, but in the context of the non-equal protection, \nundenominated substantive due process challenges of the election statutes at issue. The \nMajority's characterization and application of intermediate scrutiny is thus erroneous insofar \nthat it does not clearly articulate and distinguish between the distinct analytical steps and \nstandards for first determining whether intermediate scrutiny applies in the substantive due \nprocess context and then, if so, whether the challenged statute passes intermediate \nscrutiny. \n¶56 The Majority's application of intermediate scrutiny is further erroneous because it is \nessentially based on the same erroneous procedural and substantive bases that the District \nCourt applied strict scrutiny. As a threshold matter, it is irrefutable that election laws \ninvariably burden the fundamental voting and associational rights of individual voters to \nsome degree, whether governing \"registration and qualifications of voters, the selection and \neligibility of candidates, or the voting process itself.\" Burdick, 504 U.S. at 433, 112 S. Ct. at \n2063 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 788, 103 S. Ct. at 1570 (internal punctuation omitted)). \n\nAs we and other courts have previously recognized, it is further irrefutable without need for \nevidentiary proof, that Montana has compelling state interests in preserving the integrity of \nour election laws, maintaining public confidence therein, and protecting against the risk of \nvoting fraud, including absentee voting fraud. To suggest otherwise is sophistry of the \nhighest order. Thus, upon application of intermediate scrutiny, the Majority's analysis is \nultimately erroneous for the same reasons as the District Court's analysis, i.e., Plaintiffs \nfailed to satisfy their threshold burdens under § 27-19-201(1), MCA, of making a prima facie \nshowing that BIPA will likely substantially burden or interfere with the voting rights of the \nspecified class and that BIPA is likely not substantially related to an important government \ninterest. \n3. Section 27-19-201(2), MCA—Great or Irreparable \nInjury. \n¶57 A preliminary injunction \"may be granted ... when it appears that the commission or \ncontinuance of [the subject] act during the litigation would produce a great or irreparable \ninjury to the applicant.\" Section 27-19-201(2), MCA. An applicant for a preliminary injunction \nunder § 27-19-201(2), MCA, thus has the burden of making a prima facie showing that \"it is \nat least doubtful whether or not\" great or irreparable injury will result absent enjoinder of the \nsubject act. Sweet Grass Farms, Ltd. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 2000 MT 147, ¶ 28, 300 \nMont. 66, 2 P.3d 825 (quoting Porter, 192 Mont. at 181, 627 P.2d at 839). Here, once again \nand as previously analyzed, Plaintiffs failed to satisfy their threshold burden under § 27-19-\n201(2), MCA, of making a prima facie showing that BIPA will substantially burden or \ninterfere with the voting rights of the specified class. They have thus failed to make a prima \nfacie showing that it is even a distinct possibility, much less likely, that great or irreparable \ninjury will result to the specified class of voters absent preliminary enjoinder of BIPA. Aside \nfrom their generalized voting-cost-increase theory, the balance of Plaintiffs' preliminary \nevidentiary showing pertinent to BIPA largely consists of anecdotal observations and \nconcerns of election officials and political organizations about their uncertainty as to how \nBIPA will affect the choices of absentee voters and increase the burden on election officials. \n\"Concerns\" and \"uncertainties\" are not evidence of their subjects. Those matters provide no \nnon-speculative, probative support for the District 406*406 Court's findings of fact. The \nDistrict Court thus erroneously concluded that Plaintiffs made a sufficient prima facie \nshowing for issuance of a preliminary injunction under § 27-19-201(2), MCA. \nCONCLUSION \n¶58 I would hold that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in granting a \npreliminary injunction enjoining BIPA, whether upon application of strict or intermediate \nconstitutional scrutiny. While Montana certainly has a strong public policy interest in \nproviding voters the most convenient and most preferable manner in which to vote, it \nremains the constitutional prerogative of the Legislature and/or electorate to address that \ninterest. On their preliminary showing in this case, Plaintiffs have manifestly failed to make a \nprima facie showing that the failure to do so is of constitutional magnitude or dimension. \n¶59 I concur in part, and dissent in part. \n\nJustice Jim Rice joins in the concurring and dissenting Opinion of Justice Sandefur. \n[1] Democrats submitted an affidavit to the District Court attesting that election officials \"carefully looked into [the \nreferenced] calls to law enforcement. In each of the three cases where voters called to report that they had given a \ncanvasser their ballot, all three ballots had been delivered to the county elections office on time and without issue.\" \n[2] Democrats' evidence showed that, on average, tribal community members must travel 85 miles round-trip to reach \na county elections office. \n[3] The Western Native Voice preliminary injunction appeal is in its infancy, with no party's brief yet due or filed. We \ndid, however, grant leave for the Speaker of the Montana House of Representatives and State Senate President to \nfile an amicus brief, of which we take judicial notice. M. R. Evid. 202(6). In part, the Legislators' amicus brief argues \nthat, because the United States and Montana constitutions bestow the Legislature with the exclusive duty and \nauthority to regulate elections, the district court exceeded its authority in ruling on the issues raised. Given the \nthreshold importance of the Legislators' separation of powers argument, we address it briefly. \n\"At least since Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 [at 177], 1 Cranch 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803), [the Supreme Court has] \nrecognized that when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, `[i]t is emphatically the province \nand duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' [Citation omitted.] That duty will sometimes involve the \n`resolution of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches,' but courts cannot avoid \ntheir responsibility merely `because the issues have political implications.'\" Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 196, \n132 S. Ct. 1421, 1427-28, 182 L.Ed.2d 423 (2012) (quoting INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 943, 103 S. Ct. 2764, \n2780, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983)). The Constitution, with the rights and powers it contains and delegates to the various \nbranches of government, is the \"mandate of a sovereign people to its servants and representatives. No one of them \nhas a right to ignore or disregard its mandates, and the legislature, the executive officers, and the judiciary cannot \nlawfully act beyond its limitations.\" Gen. Agric. Corp. v. Moore, 166 Mont. 510, 515-16, 534 P.2d 859, 862-63 (1975). \nOnce the legislative branch has exercised its authority to enact a statute, whether through legislative referendum or a \nbill signed by the Governor, it is within the courts' inherent power to interpret the constitutionality of that statute when \ncalled upon to do so. A court is thus duty-bound to decide whether a statute impermissibly curtails rights the \nconstitution guarantees. As the Supreme Court has \"made clear,\" \"Congress has plenary authority in all cases in \nwhich it has substantive legislative jurisdiction, McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 \n(1819), so long as the exercise of that authority does not offend some other constitutional restriction.\" Chadha, 462 \nU.S. 919, 941, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 2779 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 132, 96 S. Ct. 612, 752, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 \n(1976)). The District Court thus did not exceed its authority by considering Democrats' constitutional challenge. \n[4] Under this standard, a reviewing court weighs the \"character and magnitude\" of the plaintiff's asserted injury \nagainst the \"precise interests\" the state put forward to justify the challenged rule and considers the \"legitimacy and \nstrength\" of those interests and the necessity of any burden on the plaintiffs. Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789, 103 S. Ct. at \n1570. \n[1] We review conclusions, interpretations, and applications of law de novo for correctness. BNSF Ry. Co. v. \nCringle, 2012 MT 143, ¶ 16, 365 Mont. 304, 281 P.3d 203; Hulstine v. Lennox Indus., Inc., 2010 MT 180, ¶ 16, 357 \nMont. 228, 237 P.3d 1277. We review lower court findings of fact only for clear error. Ray v. Nansel, 2002 MT 191, ¶ \n19, 311 Mont. 135, 53 P.3d 870. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous only if not supported by substantial evidence, \nthe court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or, based on our review of the record, we have a definite and \nfirm conviction that the lower court was mistaken. Interstate Prod. Credit Ass'n of Great Falls v. DeSaye, 250 Mont. \n320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287 (1991). \n[2] It is not entirely clear from Count I in Plaintiffs' Complaint, their briefing here and below, or the District Court's \njudgment whether the court analyzed the claim as a substantive due process or equal protection challenge of BIPA. \nWithout reference to equal protection, Count I states a claim that BIPA unduly burdens the fundamental right to vote \nof a specified class of Montana voters in violation of Montana Constitution Article II, Section 13. In Count I, Plaintiffs \ncite two federal cases analyzing claims challenging election procedure regulations (i.e., Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. \n428, 112 S. Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992), and Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 103 S. Ct. 1564, 75 \nL.Ed.2d 547 (1983)), in neither of which the Supreme Court analyzed or decided on equal protection \ngrounds. See Anderson, 460 U.S. at 786 n.7, 103 S. Ct. at 1569 (specifically noting that the Court was not deciding \nthe case on equal protection grounds but nonetheless drawing from equal protection jurisprudence to resolve the \ncase on \"direct\" constitutional grounds, i.e. substantive due process grounds). Without reference to equal protection \n\nor substantive due process, the District Court applied strict scrutiny to Plaintiffs' Count I claim. Unlike Plaintiffs and \nthe District Court, the Majority analyzes the claim in terms of equal protection without more specific characterization \nof the claim. This dissent treats the BIPA claim as essentially a substantive due process claim but in a manner not \ninconsistent with an equal protection analysis. \n[3] It is undisputed here that the right of suffrage is a fundamental Montana Constitutional right. See Mont. Const. art. \nII, § 13; Willems v. State, 2014 MT 82, ¶ 32, 374 Mont. 343, 325 P.3d 1204. \n[4] Whether a statute satisfies strict scrutiny remains a question of law even if dependent on mixed questions of fact \nand law in a particular case. See Barrus v. Montana First Jud. Dist. Ct., 2020 MT 14, ¶ 15, 398 Mont. 353, 456 P.3d \n577 (mixed questions of fact and law are questions of law reviewed de novo for correctness); BNSF Ry. Co. v. \nCringle, 2012 MT 143, ¶ 16, 365 Mont. 304, 281 P.3d 203 (de novo review of mixed questions of fact and \nlaw); Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc. v. Montana Dep't of Rev., 272 Mont. 471, 474, 901 P.2d 561, 563 \n(1995) (clearly erroneous standard applies only to \"`pure' findings of fact\"); Maguire v. State, 254 Mont. 178, 181-82, \n835 P.2d 755, 757-58 (1992) (conclusions of law, questions of law, and legal components of ultimate facts or mixed \nquestions of law and fact reviewed de novo for correctness). \n[5] For example, the District Court's finding that \"not a single election official in Montana supported the BIPA in \nlegislative hearings\" and that one local official opposed it as the \"Voter Suppression of Act of 2018\" is proof of nothing \nrelevant here. \n[6] Of course, BIPA will not prohibit any of the Plaintiffs or other political organizations in Montana from continuing to \nengage in the extensive voter registration assistance, repetitive canvassing, and other voter assistance efforts that \nhave undoubtedly resulted in significantly higher voter turnout in Montana. \n[7] As an aside, as we are correctly chiding the Montana Republican Party in another of the multitude of 2020 \nelection-eve cases that only the Green Party can submit a petition to obtain ballot eligibility for its candidates, it is \ndifficult to understand how the Democratic Party, and affiliated political organizations, can possibly have standing to \nassert an alleged infringement of the constitutional rights of persons other than themselves. That issue is of course \nnot before us and for another day, but at least puts in some perspective the Majority's lack of critical analysis of the \nthreshold factual and legal showing put forth here, on the eve of the 2020 election, as justification for enjoining \nenforcement of a statewide referendum approved by voters two years ago. \n[8] But see Pfost v. State, 219 Mont. 206, 222, 713 P.2d 495, 505 (1985) (strict scrutiny requires showing \"that the \nchoice of legislative action is the least onerous path that can be taken to achieve the state objective\"), overruled on \nother grounds by Meech v. Hillhaven W., Inc., 238 Mont. 21, 776 P.2d 488 (1989). \n[9] See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 634-35, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2821, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 \n(2008) (eschewing application of a \"freestanding `interest-balancing'\" standard of constitutional scrutiny distinct from \nsettled \"intermediate scrutiny\" standard applicable in equal protection and content-neutral free speech regulation \nincident to holding that certain gun registration limitations failed strict scrutiny under Second \nAmendment). Accord Johnson v. City of Cincinnati, 310 F.3d 484, 502 (6th Cir. 2002) (noting unclear applicability of \nintermediate scrutiny in substantive due process context). We apply a \"middle tier\" level of scrutiny to equal \nprotection challenges under the Montana Constitution but have yet to squarely apply it outside that context in \nreconciliation with the standard of intermediate scrutiny applicable in the federal equal protection context. See, e.g, \nMcDermott, ¶ 32. Compare Clark, 486 U.S. at 461, 108 S. Ct. at 1914 (discriminatory statutes withstand Fourteenth \nAmendment equal protection scrutiny only if \"substantially related to an important governmental objective\"). \n ",

Whether the district court manifestly abused its discretion when it preliminarily \nenjoined the State’s practice of disenfranchising thousands of voters who place \ntheir voted ballots into the custody of the postal system before the close of polls, \nbut whose ballots happen to be delivered by mail to an elections office after the \nclose of polls. \n2.  Whether the district court manifestly abused its discretion when it preliminarily \nenjoined the law severely restricting absentee ballot collection services upon \nwhich thousands of voters had come to rely. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPlaintiffs,  an  individual  Montana  voter  activist  and  two  political \norganizations, brought this action against the Secretary of State (the “Secretary”), \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the Montana Constitution against two \nstatutory restrictions on the right to vote: the requirement that nearly all absentee \nballots received by mail after the close of polling places must be rejected, regardless \nof when the ballots were mailed, and a set of restrictions on third party ballot \ncollection services. The matter was heard by Judge Donald Harris in the Thirteenth \nJudicial District Court, who issued a preliminary injunction against the challenged \nprovisions, determining that each imposed significant burdens on the right to vote \nwithout advancing any legitimate state interests. The Secretary sought a stay of the \n1 \n\n \ninjunction only as to the absentee ballot rejection deadline, which this Court granted. \nThe Secretary appeals the injunction as to both provisions. In a separate case under \nthe Montana Constitution brought by a different group of plaintiffs representing \nNative American Montanan voters, Judge Jessica Fehr of the Thirteenth Judicial \nDistrict Court also issued a preliminary injunction against the restrictions on third \nparty ballot collection services. Those plaintiffs filed a motion to participate in this \nappeal as intervenors, which this Court granted. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nAs voters in Montana have increasingly turned to mail voting, two Montana \nlaws put the voting rights of thousands of Montanans at serious and unjustifiable \nrisk. Even before the pandemic, the vast majority of Montana voters (nearly three \nout  of  four)  were  casting  their  ballots  absentee.  Many  relied  upon  assistance \nprovided by third-party organizers to collect and hand deliver their voted and sealed \nballots to ensure that they reached elections officials in time to be counted. But in \n2018, the Legislature passed the Assistance Ban (or “Ban”), Mont. Code Ann. § 13-\n35-701 et seq., broadly outlawing the practice. At the same time, the Legislature \nmaintained the strict 8 p.m. election day deadline for the receipt of almost all \nabsentee ballots, which requires election officials to reject ballots received after that \ncutoff even if the voter completed and put their ballot in the mail prior to that \ndeadline, and even if any delay in deliver was beyond their control. See, e.g., Mont. \n2 \n\n \nCode Ann. § 13-13-201(3) (“Election Day Cutoff” or “Cutoff”). Now, the Election \nDay Cutoff and Assistance Ban restrict mail voting in Montana from both directions: \nthe Cutoff ensures that inconsistent and variable postal delivery timelines ultimately \ndetermine  whether  voters’  ballots  will  be  counted  or discarded,  while the  Ban \nremoves an important option for returning absentee ballots that previously allowed \nthousands of Montanans to ensure their timely, in-person delivery. As a direct result, \nthousands of voters risk being disenfranchised. Dkt. No. 25, at 8-10 (Findings of \nFact, Conclusions of Law, and Order) (hereinafter “Op.”). \nThe Election Day Cutoff requires that, to be counted, most—but not all— \nabsentee ballots must be received by the county elections office on 8 p.m. on election \nday. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-211. That means that, regardless of when the voter \ncasts their ballot, seals it in the envelope, and deposits it into the custody of the postal \nsystem—and regardless of whether the voter is responsible for any delay the ballot \nencounters in the mail—the voter is disenfranchised if the ballot is not delivered by \nmail to elections officials by 8 p.m. on election day. Op. 9. The evidence before the \nDistrict Court established that delivery times may vary as much as two weeks in \nMontana, depending on a voter’s location. Id. Even when ballots are postmarked in \nthe same city, the time that it takes a ballot to arrive in a county elections office after \nbeing postmarked can vary from between one and seven days. Id. As a result, if an \n3 \n\n \nabsentee voter returns her ballot by mail, she must send it well before election day \nto increase the odds that she will not be disenfranchised by the Cutoff. Id. \nHowever, not all voters who mail their ballots are subjected to the sanction of \ndisenfranchisement if their ballot happens be delivered in the mail after the close of \npolls.  Military  and  overseas  voters  who  cast  federal  write-in  ballots  are  not \ndisenfranchised if their ballots are sent before the close of polls and received by 3 \np.m. on the next Monday—six days after the election. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-21-\n206(c). This is possible because Montana elections officials do not finish processing \nballots until well after the close of polls. Indeed, Montana law prohibits them from \neven counting provisional ballots—i.e., ballots cast by voters whose eligibility to \nvote is uncertain—until the sixth day after the election. Mont. Code Ann. § 13-15-\n107. There is no reason why election officials could not count, during this same \nperiod, ballots that arrive after election day and are postmarked on or before election \nday, which would prevent thousands of Montana voters from having their ballots \ndiscarded and their votes rejected in the November election and in future elections. \nThe Assistance Ban makes it unlawful for a person to “collect” a voter’s \nabsentee ballot unless the person is an election official, a postal worker, the voter’s \nfamily member, household member, or caregiver, or an “acquaintance” of the voter. \nMont. Code Ann. § 13-35-703(2). And, except for election officials and postal \nworkers, no one may collect and return more than six absentee ballots. In addition \n4 \n\n \nto these strict limitations, when delivering a ballot to elections officials, a ballot \ncollector must fill out a form that requires providing election officials with personal \ninformation, including the collector’s address and phone number and the nature of \ntheir relationship with the voter, and sign it under penalty of perjury. Id. at § 13-35-\n703(3), -704. If that requirement is not intimidating enough, those helping with the \ndelivery of absentee ballots now face a fine of $500 per ballot for a violation of any \nof the new prohibitions and requirements. Id. at § 13-35-705. \nAccording to the Secretary, the restrictions imposed by the Assistance Ban do \nnot apply to ballots returned by mail. Opening Br. at 28-29 (hereinafter “Br.”). As a \nresult, the Secretary takes the position that third parties can collect ballots for voters \nwithout limitation, so long as they return them through the mail, rather than by hand \ndelivering them to elections officials. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe grant or denial of injunctive relief is a matter within the broad discretion \nof the district court based on applicable findings of fact and conclusions of law. \nDavis v. Westphal, 2017 MT 276, ¶ 10, 389 Mont. 251, 405 P.3d 73. Accordingly, \nthe Court reviews the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for manifest abuse \nof discretion. Weems v. State by & through Fox, 2019 MT 98, ¶ 7, 395 Mont. 350, \n355, 440 P.3d 4, 8. A manifest abuse of discretion is one that is “obvious, evident, or \nunmistakable.” Davis, ¶ 10. To the extent the ruling is based on legal conclusions, \n5 \n\n \nthe Court reviews “to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct.” \nCity of Whitefish v. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of Flathead Cty., 2008 MT 436, ¶ 7, 347 \nMont. 490, 199 P.3d 201. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nBased on the largely undisputed factual record before it, the District Court did \nnot manifestly abuse its discretion when it concluded that the Election Day Cutoff \nsignificantly burdens Montanans’ right to vote and is not justified by any legitimate \nstate interests. The State’s abstract interest in setting election-related deadlines is not \non trial, nor is the State’s general interest in setting a deadline by when votes must \nbe cast. Rather, the issue is the State’s specific decision to disenfranchise thousands \nof voters who placed their voted ballots into the custody of the postal system before \nthe close of polls, but whose ballots happen to be delivered by mail to an elections \noffice after the close of polls. The State imposes the penalty of disenfranchisement \nupon these voters even though the State allows some ballots that arrive after the close \nof polls to be counted using an administratively feasible, postmark-based procedure. \nThe  District  Court’s  remedial  order—that  otherwise  valid  absentee  ballots \npostmarked on or before election day and received by the deadline for receipt of \nfederal write in ballots, should be counted—is carefully crafted to fit within the \nState’s existing timeframe for processing and counting ballots and to preserve the \n6 \n\n \nrequirement  that  ballots  are  cast  by  election  day.  The  District  Court  did  not \nmanifestly abuse its discretion when it implemented this remedy. \nThe  District  Court  also  did  not  manifestly  abuse  its  discretion  when  it \nconcluded that the Assistance Ban significantly burdens the right to vote and is not \njustified  by  any  legitimate  state  interests.  The  undisputed  factual  record \ndemonstrated  that  thousands  of  Montanans  have  relied  upon  organized  ballot \ncollection services provided by campaigns and civic organization, and that such \nservices were particularly important for voters who faced unique challenges to \naccessing the franchise—most notably, Native American Montanans living on rural \nreservations.  The Assistance  Ban  effectively  shut  down  those  organized  ballot \ncollection efforts. It also imposed onerous procedural requirements that reduced \naccess to other important voting opportunities, such as ballot drop boxes, previously \navailable to  all absentee voters—including  those  who did not  rely upon ballot \ncollection services. The Secretary invokes the specter of voter fraud as an all-purpose \njustification for these significant burdens, but the undisputed factual record reveals \nno evidence of problems with prior organized ballot collection efforts, and Montana \nhas long outlawed the conduct that the Assistance Ban purports to target. Nor are the \nAssistance Ban’s specific prohibitions even logically linked to the fraud concerns \ninvoked by the Secretary: under the Secretary’s own interpretation, the law imposes \nno limits on ballot collection activities if collected ballots are returned by mail, but \n7 \n\n \nseverely restricts the exact same activities if the ballots are returned to election \nofficials  in  person. As  a  result,  the Assistance  Ban  selectively  and  irrationally \nrestricts precisely the ballot collection activities that afford voters and election \nofficials superior procedural protections and transparency. The District Court did not \nmanifestly abuse its discretion when it enjoined this law. \nARGUMENT \nA. The Montana Constitution requires that restrictions on the right to \nvote  must  satisfy  strict  scrutiny,  but  even  if  the  Court  applied  a \nbalancing test, the restrictions at issue still must satisfy a demanding \nstandard. \nThe District Court faithfully applied this Court’s precedents by subjecting the \nchallenged  restrictions  on  the  fundamental  right  to  vote  to  strict  scrutiny. The \nSecretary unjustifiably asks this Court to depart from its longstanding precedent and \napply what the Secretary believes should be a deferential standard of review. Br. at \n8-13. The Court should decline the Secretary’s invitation to weaken the protections \nthat the Montana Constitution has long afforded the right to vote—a right that is \npreservative of all other rights. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886). \nBut, even if this Court were inclined to adopt a balancing test modeled upon the \napproaches used in the federal courts and some state courts, it should do so in a way \nthat reaffirms the Montana Constitution’s expansive protections for the right to vote, \nand reject the Secretary’s request to cabin judicial scrutiny of voting restrictions to \nwhat would amount to a highly deferential form of rational basis review. \n8 \n\n \nMontanans’ right to vote, like the rights of free speech, association, and due \nprocess, is protected in the Declaration of Rights in the Montana Constitution and \nis, consequently, a fundamental right. See State v. Riggs, 2005 MT 124, ¶ 47, 327 \nMont. 196, 206, 113 P.3d 281, 288 (“A right is ‘fundamental’ under Montana’s \nConstitution if the right . . . is found in the Declaration of Rights”); accord Willems \nv. State, 2014 MT 82, ¶ 32, 374 Mont. 343, 352, 325 P.3d 1204, 1210; Cottrill v. \nCottrill Sodding Serv., 229 Mont. 40, 43, 744 P.2d 895, 897 (1987). All statutes that \nimplicate such rights “must be strictly scrutinized and can only survive scrutiny if \nthe State establishes a compelling state interest and that its action is closely tailored \nto effectuate that interest and is the least onerous path that can be taken to achieve \nthe State’s objective.” Mont. Envtl. Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Envtl. Quality, 1999 MT \n248, ¶ 63, 296 Mont. 207, 225, 988 P.2d 1236, 1246; Finke v. State ex rel. McGrath, \n2003 MT 48, ¶ 23, 314 Mont. 314, 322, 65 P.3d 576, 581 (applying strict scrutiny to \nvoting restriction).  \nWhile the Secretary criticizes the District Court for applying the “wrong” \nstandard of scrutiny, the Secretary admits that his preferred standard has never been \nadopted by this Court. Br. at 10. And the Secretary tacitly admits, by presenting no \nreasoned argument to the contrary, that neither the Ban nor the Cutoff can survive \nstrict scrutiny. The District Court did not err by applying this Court’s established \n9 \n\n \nprecedent to the challenged provisions or by concluding that those provisions were \nincapable of withstanding strict scrutiny. \nTo the extent that the Court accepts the Secretary’s invitation to adopt a \nbalancing test for challenges to restrictions on the right to vote, any such balancing \ntest should comport with the strong protections afforded the right to vote by the \nMontana Constitution. Unlike the federal Constitution, the Montana Constitution \ncontains an explicit and affirmative grant of the right to vote. Mont. Const. art. II, § \n13; art. IV, § 2; see also Mont. Const art. II, § 4 (prohibiting denial of equal \nprotection of the law). This Court has recognized that the Montana Constitution \nprovides its citizens with broader protections than the federal Constitution with \nrespect to certain fundamental rights enumerated in the Declaration of Rights. See, \ne.g., State v. Tackitt, 2003 MT 81, ¶ 20, 315 Mont. 59, 65, 67 P.3d 295, 300 (right to \nprivacy); Snetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., 2004 MT 390, ¶ 15, 325 Mont. 148, 153–\n54, 104 P.3d 445, 449 (equal protection); Woirhaye v. Montana Fourth Judicial Dist. \nCourt, 1998 MT 320, ¶ 14, 292 Mont. 185, 189, 972 P.2d 800, 802 (trial by jury). \nThe fundamental right to vote deserves no lesser protection.1 \n \n1 That voting rights were viewed as particularly sacrosanct to the drafters of the \nMontana Constitution is reflected in its very fabric. Montana is one of only seven \nstates whose constitution contains two different affirmative grants of the right to \nvote, as well as a negative prohibition on infringements of that right. See Joshua A. \nDouglas, The Right to Vote Under State Constitutions, 67 Vand. L. Rev. 89, 101-07, \n107 n.91 (2014). \n10 \n\n \nThe Court should reject the Secretary’s request to consider restrictions on the \nright to vote under an unduly deferential form of rational basis review, in which the \nState’s incantation of abstract state interest would be enough to justify virtually any \nburden on the exercise of the right. See Br. at 12-13. Such a standard would not be \nconsistent with the Anderson-Burdick framework applied by federal and some state \ncourts, as the Secretary suggests. Quite the opposite: under Anderson-Burdick, even \nstate regulations that do not impose “severe” burdens on the fundamental right to \nvote are subject to exacting forms of scrutiny, requiring the state to “articulate \nspecific, rather than abstract state interests, and explain why the particular restriction \nimposed is actually necessary, meaning it actually addresses, the interest put forth.” \nOhio NAACP v. Husted, 768 F.3d 524, 545-46 (6th Cir. 2014), vacated on other \ngrounds 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 24472. Even a “minimal” burden “must be justified \nby  relevant  and  legitimate  state  interests  ‘sufficiently  weighty  to  justify  the \nlimitation.’” Id. at 538 (citing Crawford v. Marion Cty. Election Bd., 553 U.S. 181, \n191 (2008) (controlling op.)). For example, the New Hampshire Supreme Court, \nwhich has adopted its own version of the federal balancing test set forth in Ohio \nNAACP, applies a heightened form of scrutiny to restrictions on the right to vote that \nare “significant, but not severe,” which is similar to the intermediate tier of scrutiny \nrecognized by both the New Hampshire Supreme Court and this Court for certain \ntypes of restrictions on constitutional rights  See Guare v. State, 167 N.H. 658, 665-\n11 \n\n \n66 (2015) (citing Ohio NAACP, 768 F.3d at 545); see also Snetsinger, ¶ 18, (applying \n“middle-tier scrutiny” if the law or policy affects a right conferred by the Montana \nConstitution but is not found in the Constitution’s Declaration of Rights). \nThe Secretary resists these precedents for good reason: they are not satisfied \nby  a  state’s  assertion  of  vague,  abstract,  or  hypothesized  state  interests,  or  by \noverbroad  generalizations  or  justifications  invented  post-hoc  in  response  to \nlitigation. See, e.g., Guare, 167 N.H. at 667. Instead, they would require that the \nSecretary show that the restrictions at issue are “actually necessary” to serve clearly \nidentified state interests by providing sufficient evidence of the specific problem that \npurports to justify the restriction, and that the restriction “actually addresses” the \nstate’s  interest  by  showing  that  it  effectively  targets  the  specific  problem.  For \nexample, in Obama for America v. Husted, the federal court of appeals held that the \nstate failed to offer evidence that local election officials actually struggled to cope \nwith the period of early voting that the state eliminated, fatally undermining its \n“vague interest” in smooth election administration. See 697 F.3d 423, 434 (6th Cir. \n2012). Similarly, in Ohio NAACP, the court found that the state failed to show that \nthe particular type of voter fraud about which it expressed concern was “logically \nlinked” to the restriction on early voting and registration at issue, and further failed \nto explain how the restriction would prevent the fraud. 768 F.3d at 547; cf. Veasey v. \nAbbott, 830 F.3d 216, 263-64 (5th Cir. 2016) (claim under Voting Rights Act) \n12 \n\n \n(finding  that  Legislature’s  expressed  concerns  about  noncitizens  voting  was \nmisplaced, in part, because the challenged restriction “would not prevent noncitizens \nfrom  voting,  since  noncitizens  can  legally  obtain  a  Texas  driver’s  license  or \nconcealed handgun license, two forms of [permissible] ID.”). \nNor can the Secretary evade scrutiny of the challenged restrictions under a \nbalancing test by attempting to downplay the burdens imposed upon voters. When \ncourts applying a balancing test assess the severity of a law’s burden on voting rights, \nthey must consider the effects of the law on those voters who are actually impacted \nby it. See, e.g., Pub. Integrity All., Inc. v. City of Tucson, 836 F.3d 1019, 1024 n.2 \n(9th Cir. 2016) (explaining courts should consider “not only a given law’s impact on \nthe electorate in general, but also its impact on subgroups, for whom the burden, \nwhen considered in context, may be more severe.”). The severity of the burden is \ngreater when it disproportionately falls upon populations who already face greater \nhurdles to participation and are less likely to be able to overcome the increased costs \nof participation. See Ohio NAACP, 768 F.3d at 545 (finding significant burden that \nfell disproportionately on African American, lower-income, and homeless voters \nlikely  to  use  the  voting  opportunities  eliminated  by  challenged  law).  To  be \nunconstitutionally burdensome, a law that imposes a significant or even a severe \nburden on the right to vote need not completely prevent voters from voting. Rather, \nthe focus of the inquiry is on how affected voters’ “ability to cast a ballot is impeded \n13 \n\n \nby [the State’s] statutory scheme.” Ohio NAACP, 768 F.3d at 541; see also Obama \nfor Am., 697 F. 3d at 433 (holding burden of challenged voting practice was not \n“slight” even though it did not “absolutely prohibit early voters from voting”); \nGuare, 167 N.H. at 665 (holding that confusing language on voter registration form \nimposed at least an unreasonable burden because it “could cause an otherwise \nqualified voter not to register to vote”) (emphasis added). \nMoreover,  when  courts  are  confronted  with  laws  that  threaten \ndisenfranchisement, they have held that such laws impose a severe burden on the \nfranchise even when a relatively small number of voters are affected. See, e.g., Ne. \nOhio  Coal.  for  the  Homeless  v.  Husted,  696  F.3d  580,  597  (6th  Cir.  2012) \n(disqualifying provisional ballots that constituted less than 0.3 percent of total votes \ninflicted “substantial” burden on voters); Ga. Coal. for People’s Agenda, Inc. v. \nKemp, 347 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1264 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (finding severe burden where \n3,141 individuals ineligible to register); cf. Democratic Nat’l Comm. v. Hobbs, 948 \nF.3d 989, 1015 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (claim under Voting Rights Act) (rejecting \nthe notion that disenfranchisement of 3,709 voters, which was .15 percent of all \nballots  cast,  is  minimal  or  trivial);  League  of  Women  Voters  of  N.C.  v.  North \nCarolina,  769  F.3d  224,  244  (4th  Cir.  2014)  (claim  under Voting  Rights Act) \n(discussing  “basic  truth  that  even  one  disenfranchised  voter—let  alone  several \nthousand—is too many”). Indeed, voting restrictions may impose different kinds of \n14 \n\n \nburdens upon different groups of voters, all of which are relevant to the court’s \nbalancing inquiry. See, e.g., Common Cause/New York v. Brehm, 432 F. Supp. 3d \n285, 311 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (finding all voters were burdened by longer wait times \ncaused by the “ripple effect[]” of voting restriction that applied only to certain \nvoters). \nWhile the District Court correctly applied strict scrutiny, it also concluded that \nPlaintiffs would still prevail under the balancing test adopted by other courts and \nadvocated by the Secretary, because the challenged provisions significantly burden \nPlaintiffs’ fundamental rights yet fail to advance any legitimate state interest that \nwould  justify  these  burdens.  Op.  12.  The  District  Court  correctly  applied  the \nbalancing test and did not err in reaching this alternative holding. \nB. The Election Day Cutoff violates the fundamental right to vote. \nThe District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by finding that the \nElection Day Cutoff imposes significant burdens on the right to vote, and that no \ncompelling or sufficiently weighty interest justifies those burdens. The District \nCourt’s order should be affirmed. \na.  The Election Day Cutoff imposes a significant burden on the right \nto vote. \nThe District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by finding that the \nburdens imposed by the Election Day Cutoff—including, but not limited to, the \ndisenfranchisement  of  thousands  of  voters—are  significant.  Expert  testimony \n15 \n\n \ncredited  by  the  District  Court  and  unchallenged  by  the  Secretary,  Op.  7, \ndemonstrated that thousands of Montanans have been disenfranchised because their \nballots arrived after election day—at least 17,000 between 2006 and 2016, a figure \nthat is likely an undercount. Dkt. 7 at 10-14. This expert analysis also demonstrated \nthat late absentee ballot rejection rates in Montana are high relative to national rates \nand vary considerably by election type and county. Id. \nThe District Court also found, again based on uncontested evidence, that \nvarying and inconsistent mail delivery times contribute to late-arriving ballots. Op. \n9. For example, data collected by the Secretary from the 2017 special election \nshowed delivery times ranging from one day to over two weeks. Dkt. 7 at 16. The \nDistrict Court additionally found that the uncontested evidence showed that voters’ \nconfusion about the applicable deadline—based upon voters’ lifetime experiences \nwith postmark-based mailing deadlines for other government correspondence, such \nas tax returns—contributes to late arriving ballots. Op. 9. The same is true of mail \ndelivery times—while voters reasonably expect that mail sent within the same city \nor county would arrive quickly, that is often not the case, as delivery times can \nincrease significantly due to routing through geographically distant sorting centers. \nSee Op. 9.2 Evidence before the District Court demonstrated inconsistent guidance \n \n2 See also Dkt. 16, Ex. 3 at 33:7-14; Dkt. 16, Ex. 13, at 6 (voter’s late ballot mailed \nfrom 6 miles outside of Hysham was sent to Forsyth, then Glendive, then to Billings \nand then back to Hysham). \n16 \n\n \nfrom elections officials on mailing timelines, which has also changed from year to \nyear, further contributing to confusion.3 The District Court also found that these \nburdens disproportionately fall on first time voters and lower income voters with \nless education. Op. 7-8, 10. Finally, the District Court found that the COVID-19 \npandemic will increase the use of absentee voting and exacerbate these burdens. Id. \nat 8. \nAgainst  these  findings  grounded  in  an  uncontested  factual  record,  the \nSecretary  can  do  little  more  than  attempt  to  minimize  the  significant  burdens \nimposed by the Cutoff on Montanans’ right to vote. The Secretary incorrectly argues \nthat voters whose ballots are rejected because of the Cutoff have not been burdened, \nbecause there is no right to vote after election day. Br. at 15. This argument has no \napplication to the claims in this case, which exclusively concern ballots that are cast \nby voters before the close of polls and placed into the custody of the postal system \nbefore the close of polls but happen to be delivered by the postal system to an \nelections  office  after  election  day.  The  Secretary’s  related  argument—that  the \nElection Day Cutoff treats all voters the same because both absentee voters and in-\nperson voters must ensure that their ballots are received 8 p.m.—has it completely \nbackwards. Br. at 16. As the Secretary admits, in-person voters who are in line at the \npolling place by 8 p.m. must be allowed to cast a ballot that is counted—even if they \n \n3 Dkt. 8 ¶¶ 12-13; Dkt. 16, Ex. 14, at 2; Dkt. 16, Ex. 15, at 2. \n17 \n\n \nreceive and cast their ballot well after the statutory poll closing time. Id. This is an \neminently sensible rule: in-person voters who show up to their polling place ready \nto  vote  should  not  be  disenfranchised  because  a  polling  place  line  caused  by \nunanticipated administrative bottlenecks or voter enthusiasm prevents them from \ncasting their ballot by 8 p.m., even though the voter, in theory, could have taken into \naccount the possibility of such issues and arrived earlier to make sure that their vote \nwould be cast by 8 p.m. The same principle applies with equal force to absentee \nvoters. Voters who have placed their ballots into the custody of the postal system \nprior to the close of polling places have effectively “joined the line” to vote, and it \nis of no moment that—for whatever reason—their ballots happen to be delivered by \nthe postal service to their elections officials after polls have closed. The District \nCourt did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it concluded that the Cutoff fails \nto treat in person and absentee voters uniformly for this very reason. Op. 11. \nThe Secretary’s attempts to shift blame for the disenfranchising effects of the \nCutoff  onto  voters  and  the  postal  system  are  unsupported  by  the  record  and \ninapposite as a matter of law. Br. at 16-18. The Secretary incorrectly suggests that \nvoters are at fault if they wait “too long” to mail their ballot or fail to follow \ninstructions included in the absentee ballot envelope, and that issues with the postal \nservice’s  delivery  timeframes  are  beyond  the  state’s  control  and  are  therefore \nirrelevant to the burden imposed by the cutoff. But the record demonstrates that \n18 \n\n \nprecisely because of the Cutoff, whether a ballot is “on time” rather than “too late” \ndepends on factors outside the voter’s control and turns not only on when the voter \nhappens to place the ballot into the mail system, but also where. While voters may \nattempt to follow mailing guidelines—which themselves vary by county and from \nelection to election—the Cutoff ultimately prevents voters from ensuring that they \nhave mailed their ballot “on time” because inconsistent and variable postal delivery \ntimelines determine whether their ballot will be counted or discarded. Moreover, the \nState chose to rely upon the postal service when it affirmatively encouraged Montana \ncitizens to vote by absentee ballot. Having done so, the State must provide adequate \nprocess to ensure that voters’ ballots are fairly considered and, if eligible, counted. \nSee Saucedo v. Gardner, 335 F. Supp. 3d 202, 217 (D.N.H. 2018); see also Doe v. \nWalker, 746 F. Supp. 2d 667, 681 (D. Md. 2010); Obama for Am., 697 F.3d at 430-\n31. \nThe Secretary points to no evidence to support his related argument that the \nElection Day Cutoff provides a bright line rule, while a postmark deadline would \ncreate confusion. Br. at 19. While the Secretary observes that mail is not always \npostmarked at the precise location and exact time it is mailed, the testimony of the \nUSPS representative submitted by the Secretary himself makes clear that mail is \npostmarked the same day it is collected. Dkt. 20, Ex. C, at ¶¶ 4, 7. As a result, it is \nmuch easier for a voter to control when her ballot is postmarked than it is for her to \n19 \n\n \ncontrol when it will actually be delivered to elections officials. For example, as the \nSecretary’s own data demonstrates, the time it took to deliver ballots after they were \npostmarked at the same USPS distribution center ranged from one to seven days. \nDkt. 7 at 16.4 The Secretary’s remarkable assertion that voter confusion related to \nthe  receipt  deadline  was  caused  by  the  District  Court’s  order  is  baseless  and \nunsupported by evidence. Br. at 18. All of the evidence of disenfranchisement and \nvoter confusion credited by the District Court in its Order concerned elections that \ntook place before the District Court issued its Order. \nThe Secretary’s other attempts to minimize the burden imposed by the Cutoff \nalso miss the mark. While the Secretary suggests that the District Court’s ruling \ncould call into question other election deadlines, he only serves to prove Plaintiffs’ \npoint. Br. at 18. The Secretary cites the voter registration deadline as an example, \nbut neglects to mention that the state already uses a postmark deadline (not a receipt \ndeadline)  for  voter  registration  applications.  Mont.  Code  Ann.  §  13-2-301. \nMoreover, the applicable constitutional test is necessarily fact-specific, and the \nDistrict Court’s reasoning in no way suggests that any election deadline is invalid \nsimply because a voter could be confused by it. In each circumstance, the Court must \n \n4 The Secretary’s brief cites a website opining on postmarks that was published more \nthan a month after the District Court’s opinion issued. Br. at 19. This document was \nnot part of the record before the District Court below and is not properly before this \nCourt on appeal. \n20 \n\n \nnecessarily weigh the evidence regarding the burdens that the law imposes on voters. \nHere, Plaintiffs proved, through largely unrefuted evidence, that the burden of the \nCutoff on voters is significant. \nFinally, the Secretary’s contention that the cutoff cannot impose a burden \nsimply because it has been on the books for years lacks merit. Op. 13-14. The \npassage of time does not make a law less burdensome or more constitutional—\nindeed, experience often lays bare the burdens imposed by the law. Courts routinely \ngrant requests for preliminary injunctions where challenged voting restrictions have \nbeen in place for a number of years. See, e.g., Martin v. Kemp, 341 F. Supp. 3d 1326, \n1329  (N.D.  Ga.  2018)  (preliminarily  enjoining  Georgia’s  signature  matching \nprocedures, which had been in place for over a decade); see also Weems, ¶ 26 (“That \na statute has been on the books for some time is not the relevant inquiry when \nentertaining a request to enjoin it.”). \nb. The Election Day Cutoff is not justified by any sufficiently weighty \nstate interest. \nRegardless of the standard applied, the District Court did not manifestly abuse \nits discretion by finding that no compelling or sufficiently weighty interest justifies \nthe burden imposed by the Cutoff. The District Court’s Order explains how the \nsubstitute procedural safeguard of a postmark deadline—a deadline already used by \nMontana for voter registration applications, some absentee ballots themselves, and \nwhich is utilized in numerous other states, including the two states that process the \n21 \n\n \nlargest number of absentee ballots—can largely resolve the burdens imposed by the \nCutoff.  While  the  Secretary’s  Brief  does  not  seriously  contest  these  points,  it \nnonetheless contends that the Election Day Cutoff serves state interests of such \noverwhelming importance that the right of thousands of eligible voters to have their \nvote  counted  must  fall  by  the  wayside,  and  that  Plaintiffs’  requested  relief  is \nunworkable. None of the Secretary’s arguments holds up to scrutiny. \nThe Secretary’s invocation of state interests in setting deadlines and ensuring \nelectoral integrity, Br. at 20-21, exemplifies precisely the kind of vague and abstract \njustifications that courts have found insufficient when weighed against substantial \nburdens imposed by a challenged election law. The Secretary never explains why the \nstate interest in setting election deadlines necessitates the state’s current practice of \nthrowing out some absentee ballots that arrive after the close of polls while counting \nother ballots that arrive after the close of polls. This is because nothing about the \nrelief sought by Plaintiffs undermines the state’s ability to set election deadlines. \nUnder the District Court’s remedial order, no one can vote after the close of polls: \nabsentee ballots must still have been cast and placed into the custody of the postal \nservice before the close of polls in order to be counted. Similarly, the Secretary fails \nto offer any argument—let alone evidence—as to why counting all absentee ballots \npostmarked on or before election day, rather than only some of those ballots, would \ncompromise “election integrity” in any way. \n22 \n\n \nThe Secretary’s asserted interests in uniformity and timely reporting election \nresults  fare  no  better.  Even  under  the  Secretary’s  preferred  balancing  test,  the \nSecretary again fails to demonstrate why the Cutoff is actually necessary, meaning \nit actually addresses, the interests asserted by the Secretary. See, e.g., Ohio NAACP, \n768 F.3d at 545-46; see also Mont. Envtl. Info. Ctr., ¶ 63 (holding under strict \nscrutiny, state must demonstrate its action is closely tailored to effectuate the asserted \ninterest and is least onerous path that can be taken to achieve state’s objective). As \nthe District Court correctly found, the Secretary failed to present any evidence that \nthe Cutoff furthers those interests. Op. 11. \nFor example, the Secretary insists that the Cutoff is necessary to maintain \ntimely reporting of election results, which requires the counting of votes as soon as \npolls close. Br. at 22-23. But the relief sought by Plaintiffs does not meaningfully \nimpinge upon this interest, and the Secretary offered no evidence to the contrary. \nMost obviously, counties would remain free to count and report ballots in their \npossession  on  election  night.  Moreover,  under  the  existing  statutory  scheme, \ncounties already receive and count ballots after election day: federal write-in ballots \nfor military and overseas voters may be received and counted until the Monday after \nelection day, and provisional ballots cannot be counted until the sixth day after the \nelection. Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-21-206, 13-15-107. \n23 \n\n \nNor can the Secretary credibly argue that the Election Day Cutoff is necessary \nto ensure that certificates of nomination or election—i.e., the final, official results of \nthe election—are timely issued. Montana does not limit the number of days the state \nhas to certify election results after election day, and while the county canvassing \nboard must meet within two weeks after election day, it may postpone the canvass \nfrom day to day until all returns are received. Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-15-507, 13-\n15-401, 13-15-402. Further, the requested relief does not alter statutory timelines: \nthe current statutory scheme already assumes that process of counting ballots is not \ncomplete until the Monday after the election at the earliest, when federal write in \nballots are due to be received and provisional ballots are allowed to be counted. \nMont. Code Ann. §§ 13-21-206, 13-15-107. Nor does the Secretary cite any evidence \nthat states that use a postmark deadline have any difficulty meeting applicable \ncanvassing deadlines, let alone identify any reason why Montana would. See Dkt. \n21, Ex. 1 at ¶ 13 (although populous county in a postmark deadline state receives \nlarge number of ballots after election day, elections officials have no issues meeting \ncertification deadlines). The Secretary’s speculation that counting additional ballots \nthat arrive after election day would cause personnel issues and resource constraints \nis just that—speculation without an evidentiary basis in the record. Br. at 25-26.5 It \n \n5 On this point, the Secretary exclusively relies upon the May 22 Declaration of Dana \nCorson, the Secretary’s Elections Director. Br. at 26. The Secretary first submitted \nthis declaration after the District Court’s Order, in support of the Secretary’s motion \n24 \n\n \nis also at odds with the Secretary’s repeated contention that the number of voters \ndisenfranchised  by  the  Cutoff  is  so  small  as  to  be  unworthy  of  constitutional \nprotection. \nThe  Secretary’s  insistence  that  the  Cutoff  is  necessary  to  maintain \n“uniformity” in the election code—a term the Secretary invokes to lump together \nseveral  disparate  strands  of  argument—is  similarly  unsupported. The  Secretary \nsuggests,  without  further  explanation,  that  the  “entire”  statutory  scheme  will \n“unravel” because the Cutoff is referenced in multiple statutes across the election \ncode and the Complaint did not cite every single reference to the Cutoff in the code. \nSee Br. at 23. But the Secretary has never suggested that there is any substantive \ndifference between the references to the Cutoff set forth in these different statutory \nprovisions—because there is none. And the District Court’s Order is clear: “All \nabsentee ballots postmarked on or before election day shall be counted, if otherwise \nvalid[,]” if received by the relevant deadline. Op. 17 (emphasis added). As a result, \nthere can be no serious argument that the District Court’s Order applies only to some \nabsentee ballots but not others. The District Court’s ruling in no way undermines \n \nto stay the District Court’s Order. Even if this conclusory declaration were properly \nbefore this Court on appeal, it lacks any explanation of how, as a practical matter, \nthe  District  Court’s  remedial  order  interacts  with  election  dates  or  election \nprocedures  to  adversely  affect  election  staffing  and  processes.  See,  e.g.,  Ohio \nNAACP, 768 F.3d at 549 (state failed to present evidence that remedial measure \nwould actually impose undue or burdensome costs). \n25 \n\n \nany interest in uniformity—much less risks “unravel[ing]” the “whole statutory \nscheme.”6 \nThe  handful  of  purported  conflicts  with  other  statutes  advanced  by  the \nSecretary under the umbrella of “uniformity,” Br. at 26-27, are not properly before \nthe Court on appeal. These issues were raised for the first time in the Secretary’s \nbrief in support of his motion to stay the District Court’s Order, and the District Court \nwas never afforded an opportunity to evaluate the Secretary’s arguments or evidence. \nBut, in any event and as set forth in greater detail in Plaintiffs’ response in \nopposition to the motion to stay, each purported conflict is meritless. First, voters \nwith disabilities return their ballots to county elections offices the same way as other \nabsentee voters and are subject to the same Cutoff enjoined by the Court’s order. Br. \nat 27; Plaintiffs’ Opp. to Mot. to Stay, Dkt. 31, at 11-12. Second, county elections \nofficials could avoid any possibility of confusion regarding which ballot from a \nuniformed or overseas voter should be counted by implementing a simple procedural \nstep in their existing process. Br. at 26; see Dkt. 31, at 12-13. Third, while the \nSecretary’s concern about the inadequate period of time afforded Montana voters to \nfix signature-related ballot deficiencies is well-founded, Br. at 26-27, the issue he \nhighlights  was  not  created  by  the  District  Court’s  Order—rather,  it  is  equally \n \n6 For the avoidance of any doubt, Plaintiffs have since sought and received leave to \namend the complaint to specifically cite each reference to the Cutoff across the \nelection code. \n26 \n\n \napplicable both to ballots that arrive after election as well as ballots that arrive on or \njust before election day. See Dkt. 31, at 14-15. The Secretary reasons that all voters \nwhose ballots happen to arrive in the mail after election day should be completely \ndisenfranchised because a different unconstitutional law could cause some fraction \nof those voters’ late-arriving ballots to be rejected. This defies logic. Moreover, \nPlaintiffs have already received leave to amend their Complaint to challenge this \nunconstitutionally restrictive period for resolving absentee ballots with perceived \nsignature deficiencies. \nThe  Secretary’s  argument  that  the  District  Court  somehow  exceeded  its \nauthority by entering its remedial order is similarly flawed. Br. at 24-25. Courts \nretain broad discretion to grant preliminary injunctive relief, see Davis v. Westphal, \n2017 MT 276, ¶ 24, 389 Mont. 251, 264, 405 P.3d 73, 85, and an injunction is an \nequitable remedy to be fashioned tailored to the specific circumstances of the case. \nSee Mont. Tavern Ass’n v. State By & Through Dep’t of Revenue, 224 Mont. 258, \n265, 729 P.2d 1310, 1315 (1986). The District Court did not manifestly abuse its \ndiscretion when it implemented a remedy to the unconstitutional Cutoff that affords \nadditional procedural protections—i.e. a postmark-based deadline—already used in \nidentical or analogous election processes,7 carefully crafted to fit within the State’s \n \n7 See Mont. Code Ann. §§ 13-21-206 (sent-by deadline for federal write-in ballots), \n13-15-107 (postmark deadline for provisional ballot verification information), 13-2-\n301(3) (postmark deadline for voter registration applications). \n27 \n\n \nexisting timeframe for processing and counting ballots, and which preserves the \nrequirement that ballots be cast by voters by election day. This was consistent with \napproaches taken by other courts in analogous contexts. See, e.g., Obama for Am. v. \nHusted, 888 F. Supp. 2d 897, 910 (S.D. Ohio), aff’d, 697 F.3d 423 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(remedying burden of early voting restrictions by allowing early voting for all voters \nduring days and times when State already permitted early voting for some voters). \nFor all the reasons above, the District Court did not manifestly abuse its \ndiscretion when it found that the Secretary “failed to demonstrate through competent \nevidence that there is any compelling state interest that warrants the burdens and \ninterference on the right to vote” imposed by the Election Day Cutoff. Op. 12. \nC. The Assistance Ban violates the fundamental right to vote. \nThe District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by finding that the \nAssistance  Ban  imposes  significant  burdens  on  the  right  to  vote,  and  that  no \ncompelling or sufficiently weighty interest justifies those burdens. The District \nCourt’s order should be affirmed. \na.  The Assistance Ban imposes a significant burden on the right to \nvote. \nThe District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion by finding that the \nburdens imposed by the Assistance Ban are significant. Op. 7-8. Undisputed and \nunrefuted testimony from affiants credited by the District Court showed that before \nthe  passage  of  the  Ban,  the  Plaintiffs,  other  political  campaigns,  and  civic \n28 \n\n \norganizations provided ballot collection services to thousands of voters. Op. 7-8.8 \nBallot  collection  services  are  particularly  critical  for  voters  whose  personal \ncircumstances, such as physical disabilities, work or family care obligations, or lack \nof access to mail service or transportation, interfere with their ability to return their \nabsentee ballot on their own. Testimony before the District Court described how \nthose involved in get-out-the vote initiatives provided crucial assistance to Montana \ncitizens who would not have submitted their ballots without that support. Op. 7-8.9 \nThe  testimony  also  established  that  organizations  providing  ballot  collection \nservices went to great pains to protect the sanctity of voters’ ballots.10 \nThe Election Day Cutoff only heightens the importance of ballot collection \nservices. Expert testimony demonstrated that many voters return their absentee \nballot during the week before an election: more absentee ballots are returned on \nelection day than any other day. See Dkt. 7 at 8-10. Because of postal delivery \ntimeframes, there is a significant risk that ballots mailed within a week of an election \nwill not arrive in time to be counted, which makes returning ballots in person the \n \n8 See, e.g., Dkt. 8 at ¶¶ 6-9, 14-20; Dkt. 14 at ¶ 5, 7-11, 26; Dkt. 10 at ¶¶ 5-10; Dkt. \n13 at ¶¶ 3-4; Dkt. 9 at ¶¶ 3-12; Dkt. 16, Ex. 3 at 72:12-19; Dkt. 15 at ¶¶ 19-20; Dkt \n16, Ex. 23 at ¶ 14. \n9 See, e.g., Dkt. 12 at ¶¶ 3-9, 16 (students, first-time voters); Dkt. 14 at ¶¶ 14-25 \n(students with full-time jobs, low-wage workers, rural residents); Dkt. 9 at ¶¶ 3-12 \n(voters with disabilities); Dkt. 10 at ¶¶ 11-12 (working parents); Dkt. 13 at ¶ 12 \n(elderly voters, voters with mobility issues); Dkt. 8 at ¶ 19 (same). \n10 See, e.g., Dkt. 8 at ¶¶ 15-17; Dkt. 12 at ¶¶ 10-14; Dkt. 14 at ¶ 12; Dkt. 10 at ¶¶ 7-\n8, 13; Dkt. 11 at ¶ 8; Dkt. 13 at ¶¶ 4, 14. \n29 \n\n \nonly feasible option. Ballot collection is vital for many voters who wait until the last \nweek and also for the many voters who mistakenly but reasonably believe their ballot \nwill count if deposited in the mail by election day.11 \nThe Assistance Ban burdens the right to vote by eliminating access to absentee \nballot return services upon which thousands of voters have historically relied. The \nBan’s severe limitations on who is allowed to provide ballot collection services, and \non the number of ballots that can be collected, effectively shut down the organized \nballot collection services of civic organizations and campaigns that have helped \nthousands of Montana citizens to vote when they otherwise would not have.12 The \nDistrict Court found that the Ban’s elimination of these services falls heaviest on \nthose who face unique challenges to exercising their franchise—the elderly, voters \nwith disabilities, first-time student voters, and parents working multiple low-wage \njobs. Op. 7-8. The District Court credited the unchallenged testimony of Plaintiffs’ \nexpert, whose report explained how decades of political science research and data \ndemonstrate the depressive effects of laws like the Ban on voter turnout, and how \nvoters with lower educational attainment and socioeconomic status are less able to \novercome such effects than higher income, more highly educated voters. Op. 7; see \nDkt. 7 at 5-7, 14-18; cf. Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, 263-64 (5th Cir. 2016) \n \n11 Dkt. 12 at ¶¶ 8-9, 16; Dkt. 10 at ¶¶ 9, 12; Dkt. 14 at ¶¶ 14, 19; Dkt. 8 at ¶¶ 10-13. \n12 Dkt. 14 at ¶ 13-29; Dkt. 8 at ¶¶ 8-9, 21; Dkt. 11 at ¶¶ 6-7, 9; Dkt. 10 at ¶¶ 6, 10, \n14-15; Dkt. 13 at ¶ 13; Dkt. 9 at ¶¶ 15-18. \n30 \n\n \n(crediting district court’s reliance on cost of voting framework to conclude voter ID \nlaw would decrease voter turnout). \nPerhaps no segment of Montana voters is more burdened by the Ban than \nNative American voters in rural tribal communities, who have needed to rely on \nballot collection at particularly high rates because of geographic isolation, unreliable \naccess to mail service, high rates of poverty, and other factors linked to the State’s \nlegacy of racial discrimination. The disenfranchising effects of the Assistance Ban \non Montana’s Native American communities were forcefully demonstrated by the \nevidence  presented  by  the  Western  Native  Voice  plaintiffs  and  credited  by  the \nWestern Native Voice District Court in its order enjoining the Assistance Ban. See \nDkt. 16, Ex. 22; Dkt. 6; (Appendix A) , Order, Western Native Voice et al. v. Stapleton \net al., Cause No. 20-0377 (13th Jud. Dist. July 7, 2020); see also Hobbs, 948 F.3d at \n1005-07, 1033 (en banc) (holding Arizona’s ballot collection restrictions disparately \nburdened minority voters in violation of Voting Rights Act). \nThe Ban also burdens the right to vote by eliminating voting opportunities \npreviously available to all absentee voters—including those who did not rely upon \nballot return services—by restricting delivery of absentee ballots to sites staffed by \nelections officials during business hours, adding confusing procedural steps, and \nincreasing wait times. See Common Cause/N.Y., 432 F. Supp. 3d at 311 (finding all \nvoters were burdened by “ripple effect[]” of voting restriction). Prior to enactment \n31 \n\n \nof the Ban, elections officials introduced alternative methods for voters to return \nabsentee ballots, including the use of secure drop boxes that enabled voters to submit \nabsentee ballots outside normal business hours and at times that meshed with voters’ \nwork schedules and other daily obligations.13 But as a result of Assistance Ban, any \nvoter who attempts to return a ballot in person—even someone just delivering their \nown ballot—must stand in line to be interrogated by an election official in order to \ndetermine whether the voter is a “collector” who must sign the registry required by \nthe law.14 This effectively prohibits the use of unstaffed drop boxes, which has \ncaused counties to reduce the overall number of drop boxes and the hours during \nwhich they are available. See Op. 8. For these reasons, as well as the significant \nadministrative burdens the Ban imposes, county election officials have voiced strong \nopposition to the Ban. See Op. 10. \nThe District Court correctly found that the Secretary failed to present any \nevidence to dispute the Plaintiffs’ evidence of the significant burdensome impact of \nthe Assistance Ban or its disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups of voters. \nOp. 8. The Secretary, to his credit, all but concedes this point on appeal. Br. at 28-\n29. The most the Secretary can muster is that voters can return their ballots by means \nother than ballot collection services. Id. But as numerous courts have held, voting \n \n13 See, e.g., Dkt. 13 at ¶ 10; Dkt. 16, Ex. 3 at 24:20-25:4; Dkt. 16, Ex. 10 at 2; Dkt. \n16, Ex. 1 at 27:3-18. \n14 Dkt. 16, Ex. 3 at 24:20-25:9, 26:1-4; 30:22-33:6; Dkt. 13 at ¶ 10. \n32 \n\n \nrestrictions  can  still  impose  unconstitutional  burdens  even  when  they  do  not \nabsolutely prohibit voters from voting. See infra at 13-14. And as the testimony \nbefore  the  District  Court  showed,  for  many  voters,  access  to  organized  ballot \ncollection services was the difference between voting and not voting at all. See infra \nat 30. \nFor all these reasons, the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion \nby finding that the burdens imposed by the Assistance Ban are significant. \nb. The Assistance Ban is not justified by any sufficiently weighty state \ninterest. \nThe District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it found that \nthe Assistance Ban serves no legitimate purpose. Op. 10. No such purpose is evident \nin  the  legislative  history—no  evidence  was  presented  of  problems  with  prior \norganized ballot collection efforts. Op. 10. To the contrary, Montana’s front-line \nelection  officials  testified  that  ballot  collection  has  not  resulted  in  any  voting \nirregularities and that there was no legitimate need for the Ban. Id.; Dkt. 15 at ¶¶ 8-\n11; Dkt. 16, Ex. 1 at 7:5-8. Despite an extensive review, Plaintiffs’ expert was unable \nto identify even a single case of documented fraud relating to ballot collection in the \nState.  Op.  9.  Moreover,  Montana  has  long  outlawed  voter  coercion  and  ballot \ntampering. See Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-205. The fact of the matter is that the Ban \ndoes not actually target fraud; it instead “forbids non-fraudulent third-party ballot \ncollection.” Hobbs, 948 F.3d at 1036 (holding anti-fraud justification for Arizona \n33 \n\n \nballot collection ban “seems to have been contrived” given absence of evidence of \nfraud perpetrated through ballot collection and pre-existing procedural safeguards \nand prohibitions on ballot tampering). \nBecause the Assistance Ban does not further any state interest, let alone a \ncompelling interest, it does not withstand even the first step of strict scrutiny. See, \ne.g., Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. 287, 303, 911 P.2d 1165, 1174 (1996) (state must \n“prove the compelling interest by competent evidence”). Nor can the Secretary \ndemonstrate that the Ban satisfies the second step, which requires narrow tailoring \nto achieve the purported interest. Indeed, Montana could employ less restrictive \nmeans than the Ban to provide additional safeguards for ballot collection—for \nexample, by requiring some of the best practices already voluntarily implemented \nby organized ballot collection programs.15 But, as testimony before the District Court \nshowed,  when  county  election  administrators  proposed  such  ameliorative \namendments to the Ban in order to address their significant concerns about the Ban’s \nnegative impact on voters and elections administrators alike, the sponsor of the \nlegislation rejected them out of hand. Dkt. 15 at ¶¶ 12-16; see Dorn v. Bd. of Trs. of \nBillings Sch. Dist. # 2, 203 Mont. 136, 150, 661 P.2d 426, 433 (1983) (noting less \nrestrictive means “were not tried”). For the same reasons, the Secretary cannot save \nthe law under a balancing test: the Secretary fails to articulate specific, rather than \n \n15 See supra note 10. \n34 \n\n \nabstract state interests, or explain why the particular restriction imposed is actually \nnecessary, meaning it actually addresses, the interest put forth.  See also Democratic \nNat’l Comm. v. Reagan, 904 F.3d 686, 754 (9th Cir. 2018) (Thomas, C.J., dissenting), \npanel majority opinion vacated en banc 911 F.3d 942 (9th Cir. 2019) and rev’d on \nother grounds en banc 948 F.3d 989 (9th Cir. 2020) (even if burden imposed by \nballot  collection  ban  were  minimal,  justifications  based  on  generic  concerns \nregarding voter fraud are not enough to withstand scrutiny under balancing test). \nThe Secretary’s Brief addresses none of that evidence credited by the District \nCourt and instead casts about in vain for support from vague and unsubstantiated \nanecdotes from the Ban’s sponsor and isolated allegations of election fraud in other \nstates, Br. at 30, 32-33, 35, but none comes close to the “competent evidence” \nrequired to prove a compelling state interest. See Wadsworth, 275 Mont. at 303 \n(“Simply because the  State  alleges  a  compelling interest,  does  not  obviate the \nnecessity that the State prove the compelling interest by competent evidence.”); \nMcLaughlin v. N.C. Bd. of Elections, 65 F.3d 1215, 1228 (4th Cir. 1995) (“electoral \n‘integrity’ does not operate as an all-purpose justification flexible enough to embrace \nany burden, malleable enough to fit any challenge and strong enough to support any \nrestriction” (quotation marks omitted)). \nThe Secretary looks, without success, for support in the Ban’s legislative \nhistory. Br. at 35. True, the bill’s sponsor offered a few anecdotes about voters giving \n35 \n\n \na  ballot  collector  their  ballots  and  then  calling  law  enforcement  to  report  the \ncollection activity as suspicious. But county election officials diligently followed up \non the bill sponsor’s concerns, and determined that in each of those cases, the ballots \nhad been delivered to the county elections office on time and without issue. Dkt. 15 \nat ¶ 9. These kinds of vague and ultimately discredited assertions are not competent \nevidence of a problem necessitating the Ban, particularly in the face of competent \ntestimony from elections administrators in opposition to the Ban and evidence of the \nlack of problems with ballot collection.16 See Wadsworth, 275 Mont. at 303. \nIn the absence of a Montana interest, and belying his contention that one \nexists, the Secretary cites a Florida law professor’s blog post—itself unbacked by \nany  citation  to  authority—and  three  isolated  instances  of  fraudulent  behavior \ninvolving absentee ballots in other states. Br. at 30, 32-33. The Secretary also leans \nheavily on a single sentence of a 15-year old advisory commission report and the \nfact that some other states impose restrictions on ballot collection. Br. at 33-34. But \njust as the Ninth Circuit concluded in rejecting the argument that a single incident in \nNorth Carolina established that Arizona had a legitimate interest in outlawing non-\n \n16 The Secretary observes that there have been demonstrated cases of noncompliance \nwith election laws in initiative petition signature gathering—contexts that have \nnothing to do with ballot collection or even voting. Br. at 34-35. The legislature has \nnot  reacted  to  these  instances  of  misconduct  by  imposing  relationship-based \nrestrictions on who can collect petition signatures, or by restricting the number of \nsignatures that any individual petition circulator can collect. \n36 \n\n \nfraudulent organized ballot collection, an isolated example of absentee ballot-related \nfraud in another state has “little bearing” on Montana.  Hobbs, 948 F.3d at 1037. The \nsame is true of an advisory commission report’s one sentence recommendation, \nwhich  did  not—and  could  not—account  for  the  history  of  ballot  collection  in \nMontana and the specific role that ballot collection plays in ensuring access to the \nfranchise in this state. As in Arizona, “third-party ballot collection has had a long \nand  honorable  history”  in  Montana.  See  id.  There  is  zero  evidence  of  ballot-\ncollection fraud in Montana, and the acts alleged in the criminal indictment in North \nCarolina were illegal under Montana law before the passage of the Ban, and would \nremain illegal if the Ban were no longer the law. See id.; see also Op. 15-17. \nEven more troubling is the Secretary’s argument that the Assistance Ban is \njustified solely by the need to ensure that voters feel secure in the voting process and \npromote  public  confidence.  Br.  at  31.  The  Ban’s  legislative  sponsors  cannot \nmanufacture a compelling governmental interest by sowing public doubt through \nunsubstantiated—and  in  some  cases,  demonstrably  false—allegations  about \nmisconduct  committed  by  people  providing  ballot  collection  services.  As  the \nMissouri Supreme Court has explained, “[p]erceptions are malleable. While it is \nagreed here that the State’s concern about the perception of fraud is real, if this Court \nwere to approve the placement of severe restrictions on Missourians’ fundamental \nrights owing to the mere perception of a problem in this instance, then the tactic of \n37 \n\n \nshaping public misperception could be used in the future as a mechanism for further \nburdening the right to vote or other fundamental rights.” Weinschenk v. State, 203 \nS.W.3d 201, 218 (Mo. 2006). Unfortunately, this tactic has been used to attempt to \njustify ballot collection restrictions in other states. As the Ninth Circuit put it, “if \nsome Arizonans today distrust third-party ballot collection, it is because of the \nfraudulent campaign mounted by proponents of [the ballot collection ban]. Those \nproponents made strenuous efforts to persuade Arizonans that third-party ballot \ncollectors have engaged in election fraud. [ . . . ] It would be perverse if those \nproponents, who used false statements and race-based innuendo to create distrust, \ncould now use that very distrust to further their aims in this litigation. Hobbs, 948 \nF.3d at 1037. For these reasons, the State’s abstract interest in promoting public \nconfidence cannot justify the significant burdens imposed by the Assistance Ban. \nThe Secretary also incorrectly suggests that the voters’ approval of the Ban \nshould suffice to demonstrate its constitutionality.  Br. at 31 (citing Mont. Auto. Ass’n \nv. Greely, 193 Mont. 378, 384, 632 P.2d 300, 303 (1981)). But this Court in Greely \ndid  not  find  that  voter  approval  was  alone  sufficient  to  insulate  a  law  from \nconstitutional scrutiny. The issue in Greely was the significance of a lack of evidence \nof a state interest for an initiative that increased public disclosure of lobbying \nactivities. Id. Unlike the legislative referendum at issue here, the process in Montana \nfor passing initiatives does not include a legislative fact-finding mechanism. Given \n38 \n\n \nthe absence of such a mechanism, this Court concluded that requiring evidence \n“would result in the emasculation of the initiative process in Montana” such that “no \ninitiative could withstand a First Amendment challenge.” Id. Considering those \nconcerns, the court concluded that the initiative did not need to “fall in its entirety.”  \nId. at 383-84. Even so, the court proceeded to strike down part of the law, despite \nthose concerns. Id. at 389. \nHere, in contrast, there was ample opportunity to develop evidence of a \ncompelling state interest. Before being submitted to a popular vote, the Ban went \nthrough  both  chambers  of  the  legislature,  each  of  which  has  the  “fact-finding \ncapabilities”  absent  from  the  initiative  process.  And  competent  evidence  was \nintroduced during the legislative process—evidence, in particular from elections \nofficials, that the Ban was not needed and would only add to administrative burdens.  \nThe lack of any evidence of a state interest here is far more consequential, and \nGreely’s concerns about emasculating the initiative process are absent. \nStripped to their core, the Secretary’s arguments rely entirely upon vague and \nabstract  state  interests  in  “electoral  integrity,”  as  well  as  on  overbroad \ngeneralizations about hypothetical risks posed by ballot collection. See, e.g., Guare, \n167 N.H. at 667. But in order to show that the restriction is “actually necessary” \nunder a balancing test, the Secretary must provide competent evidence of the specific \nproblem justifying the restriction. For example, in Ohio NAACP, the federal court of \n39 \n\n \nappeals held that the State had to do more than provide only “a handful of actual \nexamples  of  voter  fraud”  and  “general  testimony  regarding  the  difficulties  of \nverifying voter registration” to establish that the restriction on early voting and \nregistration was actually necessary. See 768 F.3d at 547. The Secretary can do no \nmore than offer overbroad generalizations unsupported by evidence—such as his \nunsubstantiated belief that ballot collectors who are “known” to voters are less likely \nto tamper with ballots. Br. at 31.17 \nNor  can  the  Secretary  demonstrate  that  the  Assistance  Ban  is  actually \nnecessary, meaning it actually addresses the interests asserted by the Secretary. To \nthe extent that the Ban is truly intended to prevent fraud by limiting which third \nparties can handle absentee ballots and the number of ballots they can handle, it \ncontains a gaping hole: according to the Secretary, its restrictions do not apply to \nballots returned by mail. Br. at 28-29. As a result, according to the Secretary, third \nparties can collect ballots for voters without limitation, so long as they return them \n \n17 The Secretary makes passing reference to an argument, not raised in the District \nCourt, that the Absentee Ban serves a state interest in uniformity by requiring that \nabsentee ballots be returned to elections officials through a similar method as how \nthey were transmitted to the voter. Br. at 35-36. Even if this argument had been \nproperly raised below, it constitutes precisely the kind of abstract state interest \ninvented post-hoc in response to litigation that is insufficient to justify significant \nburdens on the right to vote. Indeed, the Secretary never explains why this specific \nkind of uniformity advances any state interest. See, e.g., Obama for Am., 697 F.3d at \n442 (White, J., concurring) (“[U]niformity without some underlying reason for the \nchosen rule is not a justification in and of itself”). \n40 \n\n \nthrough the mail, rather than by hand delivering them to elections officials. But if \npeople providing ballot collection services hand deliver ballots to elections officials, \nthey are subject to the Ban’s restrictions. As a result, the law permits a practice that \nis relatively riskier than the practice it bans (because there is no guarantee that mailed \nabsentee ballots will arrive before the Cutoff) and which features relatively less \ntransparency than the practice it bans (because the collector mailing ballots need not \ncomplete a form or interact in person with an elections official when dropping off \nballots). Whatever else can be said of the law, the particular type of voter fraud for \nwhich the Legislature and the Secretary purport to express concern is not “logically \nlinked” to the specific restrictions on ballot collection actually imposed by the \nAssistance Ban. See Ohio NAACP, 768 F.3d at 547. \nFor all the reasons above, the District Court did not manifestly abuse its \ndiscretion when it found that the Secretary “failed to demonstrate through competent \nevidence that there is any compelling state interest that warrants the burdens and \ninterference on the right to vote” imposed by the Assistance Ban. Op. 12. \nD. The District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion when it \nevaluated the constitutionality of the Election Day Cutoff and the \nAssistance Ban on their own terms as well as together. \nThe Secretary correctly concedes that the cumulative burden imposed by both \nthe Assistance Ban and the Cutoff is even greater than the burdens resulting from \neach independently. But it does not therefore follow that enforcement of the Cutoff \n41 \n\n \nin the absence of the Assistance Ban no longer significantly burdens voting rights. \nIndeed, the District Court analyzed both the Cutoff and the Ban on their own terms, \nand only a handful of the District Court’s findings described the two provisions \noperating in combination with each other to amplify the burdens they impose on the \nright to vote. See, e.g., Op. 10 (discussing combined impact).  \nAnd in any event, unless and until the Cutoff and the Ban are permanently \nenjoined,  voters  must  navigate  both  restrictions  simultaneously.  The  Secretary \nprovides  no  authority  for  his  contention  that  courts  can  only  scrutinize  voting \nrestrictions  in  isolation  from  the  broader  electoral  environment  in  which  they \noperate. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \naffirm the District Court’s May 22, 2020 Order. \n \n   \n42 \n\n \nRespectfully submitted this 27th day of July, 2020. \n/s/ Peter Michael Meloy \nPeter Michael Meloy \nMELOY LAW FIRM \nP.O.

The District Court properly \nemployed a strict scrutiny standard in enjoining the Ballot Interference Prevention \nAct (“BIPA”).  The Court should refrain from heading down this slippery slope.  The \nFramers  of  the  Montana  Constitution  specifically  enumerated  fundamental \nprotections in our Declaration of Rights.  Those protections have historically been \njealously safeguarded by the Montana Supreme Court.  The Court should reaffirm \nthe principle that any law burdening the right to vote is subject to strict scrutiny.     \nThe BIPA is a solution in search of a problem.  The State presented no \nevidence to the District Court that voter fraud or intimidation is present in Montana \nelections.  And the other side of the ledger is heavy.  By effectively ending ballot \ncollection and conveyance, the BIPA violates Appellees’ and Intervenors’ rights \nunder the Montana Constitution, including the right to vote.  In particular, rural tribal \ncommunities across the seven reservations in Montana depend on ballot collection \nto participate in elections, and many Native Americans will be denied the right to \nvote in the upcoming 2020 elections unless the BIPA is enjoined.  Now, more than \never, voters need to have the option to cast their ballots outside of the polling place.  \nNative American communities in Montana—many of whom already face barriers \nthat  render  travel  to  polling  places  infeasible—will  be  disproportionately \n1 \n \n\ndisenfranchised during this pandemic if they cannot rely on ballot collection because \nthey have insufficient access to the vote by mail apparatus.   \nAllowing the BIPA to be in effect for the 2020 primaries and general election \nwill  irreparably  harm  Native  Americans  living  on  rural  reservations  and  the \norganizations working with them.  The District Court’s order enjoining the Ballot \nInterference Prevention Act should be affirmed. \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \n1.  Whether the constitutional right to vote is treated differently than other \nfundamental rights and subjected to a reduced level of scrutiny. \n2.  Whether the district court erred by enjoining the Ballot Interference \nPrevention Act. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \nOn March 13, 2020, Appellees Robyn Driscoll, the Montana Democratic \nParty, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a complaint in \nYellowstone County District Court alleging that the BIPA, Mont. Code Ann. § 13-\n35-701 et seq., and the Election Day deadline set forth in Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-\n201 are unconstitutional.  Dkt. 1.  Appellees alleged that the BIPA violates their \nfundamental right to vote, right to speak and associate, and their due process rights.  \nTheir case was assigned to the Honorable Donald L. Harris in the 13th Judicial \nDistrict Court.  One day prior, on March 12, 2020, Intervenors Western Native \n2 \n \n\nVoice, Montana Native Vote, Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of Fort Peck, Blackfeet \nNation, Confederate Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Crow Tribe and Fort Belknap \nIndian Community (“Intervenors”) also filed a complaint in Yellowstone County \nDistrict Court alleging that the BIPA violates their fundamental right to vote, right \nto speak and associate, and their due process rights.  The Honorable Jessica Fehr \npresides over Intervenors’ District Court case.  \nAppellees also moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of \nthe BIPA and the Election Day deadline in advance of the June primary election.  \nDkt. 4-16. The parties proceeded without a hearing, and the State provided virtually \nno sworn testimony in opposition to Appellees’ Motion.1 \nOn May 22, 2020, Judge Harris issued an order granting Appellees’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction. Dkt. 25. The Court concluded that “[b]ecause voting \nrights  are  fundamental,  statutes  like  the  BIPA  and  the  Receipt  Deadline  that \nallegedly infringe upon the right to vote ‘must be strictly scrutinized and can only \nsurvive strict scrutiny if the State establishes a compelling state interest and that its \naction is closely tailored to effectuate that interest’…”  Id. (citations omitted). In \ngranting the injunction the Court found that “the State failed to present any evidence \nto dispute Plaintiffs’ evidence.”  Id.  It further found that the evidence in the record \n                                                 \n1 Intervenors similarly moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \nenjoining enforcement of the BIPA for the primary election and pending final resolution of their \nclaims. Judge Fehr entered a TRO enjoining the BIPA on May 20, 2020.   \n3 \n \n\ndemonstrated that “there has never been a documented case of absentee ballot \ncollection fraud in Montana.”  Ultimately, the Court concluded that the Plaintiffs \nhad demonstrated both that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims \nand that they would suffer irreparable injury absent an injunction.  Id. \nOn  June  3,  2020,  the  State  notified  the  Court  that  it  would  appeal  the \nPreliminary Injunction of the BIPA as well as the Election Day deadline. (Am. \nNotice of Appeal, DA 20-0295 (June 3, 2020).) \n  On  June  12,  2020,  Intervenors  moved  to  intervene  in  this  proceeding.  \nIntervenors noted that there are two pending district court proceedings seeking a \npermanent injunction preventing enforcement of the BIPA for the 2020 general \nelection and all future elections.  Driscoll et al. v. Stapleton, Cause No. DV 20-0408 \n(13th Judicial District, Hon. Donald Harris) (“Driscoll”); Western Native Voice et al. \nv. Stapleton et al., Cause No. 20-0377 (13th Judicial District, Hon. Jessica Fehr) \n(“Western Native Voice”).  The cases are similar, but not identical.  Both involve \nconstitutional claims pursuant to Article II, §§ 6, 7, 13 and 17 of the Montana \nConstitution.    However,  the  cases  involve  different  parties,  different  expert \nwitnesses, and different factual allegations about how the BIPA infringes upon the \nconstitutional rights of the respective plaintiffs.  Specifically, the Western Native \nVoice Plaintiffs allege that rural tribal communities across the seven reservations in \nMontana depend on ballot collection to participate in elections, and many Native \n4 \n \n\nAmericans will be denied the right to vote in the upcoming 2020 elections unless the \nBIPA is enjoined.  On June 18, 2020, this Court granted Intervenors’ Motion to \nparticipate in the instant proceeding. \n  On July 7, 2020, Judge Fehr issued an order granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction in Western Native Voice.  Like Judge Harris’s Order, Judge \nFehr concluded that the Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, \nand also would suffer irreparable harm if the law were to remain in effect.  In \naddition to demonstrating a violation of the right to vote, Judge Fehr concluded that \nthe “Plaintiffs have established a prima facie violation of their right to free speech, \nright to freedom of association and right to due process.”  Order Granting Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunctive Relief, DV 2020-377 (July 7, 2020). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nIntervenors  incorporate  by  reference  Appellees’  Statement  of  Facts.  In \naddition, the record before the District Court when it considered Appellees’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction included  both Intervenors’ Brief in Support of their \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction in the Western Native Voice proceeding (Exhibit \n22 to Plaintiffs/Appellees’ Brief) as well as the affidavit of Marci McLean, the \nexecutive director of  Western Native Voice  (Exhibit 23 to Plaintiffs/Appellees’ \nBrief).  Accordingly, the Court may properly consider those facts presented to the \n5 \n \n\nDistrict  Court  in  support  of  the  Western  Native  Voice  Motion  for  Preliminary \nInjunction.2 \nThe vast majority of Montana voters who cast a vote utilize the absentee \nvoting  process:  in  the  2018  general  election,  of  509,213  votes,  372,400  were \nabsentee votes (73.13%). Dkt. 5 at 4; Dkt 7 at 7.  The BIPA prohibits the knowing \ncollection  of  a  ballot,  unless  the  collector  is  the  voter’s  acquaintance,  family \nmember, caregiver, household member, postal service worker, or election official.  \nMont. Code Ann. § 13-35-703.  Unless they are a postal service worker or election \nofficial, the limited individuals who can collect ballots may collect no more than six \nballots in any instance and must sign a registry form.  Mont. Code ann. §§ 13-35-\n703; 13-35-704.  Failure to follow the BIPA subjects one to a fine of $500 per ballot \ncollected.  Mont. Code ann. § 13-35-705.  Further, because BIPA forms are signed \nand  sworn  to  under  penalty  of  perjury,  violations  of  the  BIPA  could  lead  to \nimprisonment.  Mont. Code Ann. § 45-7-201.  \nThe Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders (“MACR”) disputed the \nneed for the BIPA.  Dkt. 5 at 7-8; Dkt. 15 at ¶¶ 6-8, 17-18. During a hearing before \nthe State Administration and Veteran Affairs Committee on February 27, 2020, the \nCascade County Elections Administrator testified that she refers to the BIPA as the \n“Voter Suppression Act of 2018 … because we've taken away the rights, in my \n                                                 \n2 The State did not object to Intervenors’ Motion to Intervene provided they “rely only on the record in Driscoll.” \n6 \n \n\ncounty specifically, to drop the ballot 24 hours a day to utilize that office on the \nweekends, to drive up and drop it off, unless we have somebody staffing that.” Dkt. \n  \n5 at 8; Dkt. 16 at Exh. 3.  During the same hearing, the Gallatin County Clerk \ntestified that “this is a suppressive act. This is a way of impeding voters from \naccessing their enfranchisement.” Dkt. 16 at Ex. 3. \n \n  Voter fraud has historically been rare, if not nonexistent in Montana.  The \nBIPA’s legislative history identifies no instances of abuse of organized absentee \nballot assistance.  Indeed, no members of the public testified in support of the bill.  \nThe bill’s sponsor offered merely a few anecdotes about voters giving a collector \ntheir ballots and then calling law enforcement to report the collection activity as \nsuspicious.  Dkt. 5 at 11.  Elections administrators testified that ballot collection has \nnot resulted in any voting irregularities and that there was no legitimate need for the \nban.  Dkt. 15 at ¶¶ 8-11; Dkt. 16 at Ex. 1.  Their testimony is consistent with analyses \nby the current and former Montana Secretaries of State, which have found that voter \nfraud of any kind is exceedingly rare.  Dkt. 16 at Ex. 18, 13, 19. Indeed, Appellees’ \nexpert witness was unable to identify even a single case of documented fraud relating \nto ballot collection.  Dkt. 7 at 4-5.  In any event, no such evidence was offered in \nsupport of the BIPA. \nMontana  is  home  to  seven  Indian  reservations:  the  Blackfeet  Indian \nReservation, the Crow Reservation, the Flathead Reservation, the Fort Belknap \n7 \n \n\nReservation,  the  Fort  Peck  Indian  Reservation,  the  Northern  Cheyenne  Indian \nReservation, and the Rocky Boy’s Reservation.  Sixteen counties intersect with these \nreservations.  These reservations are home to thousands of Montana voters who lack \nequal access to the ballot and who experience greater barriers to casting mail ballots \n(both absentee and ballots in mail-only election) than do other Montanans.  Dkt. 5 at \n6-7; Dkt. 16 at Exh. 22 and 23 (“Perhaps no segment of Montana voters is more \nburdened by the ban than Native American voters in rural tribal communities.  Those \nvoters have been forced to rely on ballot collection at particularly high rates because \nof geographic isolation, unreliable access to mail service, high rates of poverty, and \nother factors.”); see also, Dkt. 7 at 2. \nNative American voters face multiple obstacles to voting.  First, there is a lack \nof uniform and consistent addressing systems.  Dkt. 16, Exh. 23, ¶ 16.  County \noffices reject hundreds of voter registration forms, largely due to inconsistencies in \nthe home addresses provided by tribal registrants.  Id.  Second, most tribal nation \nresidents no not receive mail at home and must instead use a post office box.  Id., \n¶ 17.  It is a common occurrence for multiple families to share a single post office \nbox.  Id.  In recent years the return rate for absentee ballots issued in tribal nations \nhas decreased significantly.  Id.  Third, many Native American voters must travel \nlong distances to reach county election offices to hand deliver ballots.  Id., ¶ 18.  On \naverage, tribal members must travel 85 miles round trip to reach their county election \n8 \n \n\noffices.  Id.  Finally, even though there are some satellite voting locations now open \nin Indian country, they are generally staffed for short periods of time and are often \nlocated  far  away  from  rural  communities  within tribal boundaries.    The  BIPA \nexacerbates all of these problems.  Id., ¶ 20.  \n  Western Native Voice (“WNV”) and Montana Native Vote (“MNV”) are \nNative-led  voting  rights  organizations  dedicated  to  enhancing  the  political \neffectiveness of Native communities in Montana.  Id., ¶ 6.  These organizations hire \ncommunity organizers to collect ballots on each of the reservations in the state.  Id., \n¶ 9.  No other organizations perform the type of work that WNV and MNV do.  Id., \n¶ 25.  During the 2018 election cycle, these organizations hired dozens of community \norganizers and collected at least 853 ballots.  Id., ¶ 10.  The work of WNV and MNV \nhas helped increase voter turnout in Indian Country.  Id., ¶ 13.  In part because of \nthese organizations’ work, 7,704 more tribal community members voted in 2018 \nthan in 2014.  Id., ¶ 14.  Unfortunately, with the BIPA in effect WNV and MNV \nmade the decision not to hire ballot collectors in advance of the 2020 primary \nelection.  Id., ¶ 15.  Indeed, with the BIPA in place it would be virtually impossible \nfor these organizations to recruit, hire, and train enough organizers to adequately \ncarry out ballot collection efforts.  Id., ¶ 22.  The cost of ballot collection operations \nwill increase astronomically with the BIPA in effect.  Id.  \n9 \n \n\n  The BIPA will cause confusion and anxiety among organizers.

Corp., 2003 MT 372, ¶¶ \n11–12, 319 Mont. 132, 136–37, 82 P.3d 912, 916; see also Cole v.

Code Ann. § 27-19-201(2).  Where, as \nhere, the underlying claim involves constitutional rights, that constitutional rights \nmay be violated is per se irreparable harm.  Mont. Cannabis Indus.

Under Montana law, “‘[p]rima \nfacie’ means literally ‘at first sight’ or ‘on first appearance but subject to further \nevidence or information.’”  Id. (citations omitted).   \nA district court’s decision to apply strict scrutiny and its conclusion, at this \nstage, that a statute is likely unconstitutional are also questions of law reviewed de \nnovo.  See Wadsworth v. State, 275 Mont. 287, 298, 911 P.2d 1165, 1171 (1996). \nThe underlying issues of fact are reviewed for clear error.  See State v. Reynolds, \n2017 MT 25, ¶ 13, 386 Mont. 267, 389 P.3d 243. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe District Court properly subjected the BIPA to a strict scrutiny analysis.  \nThe general rule in Montana is that legislation burdening a fundamental right is \nsubjected to strict scrutiny.  The State has failed to articulate any reason why the \nCourt should apply a relaxed standard to statutes burdening the right to vote.  While \nthe State may regulate the right to vote, that authority can only be exercised within \nconstitutional limits. \nApplying a strict scrutiny analysis, the District Court properly concluded that \nthe law is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  The \nState failed to present any evidence that the BIPA: (1) will promote the integrity, \n11 \n \n\nsecurity or efficiency of absentee voting; (2) will reduce election costs or burdens; \nand (3) will increase voter turnout.  Accordingly, the State cannot meet its burden to \ndemonstrate that the BIPA meets a compelling state interest.  \nEven if the Court were to adopt the flexible Anderson-Burdick standard, the \nBIPA was properly enjoined because the District Court correctly found that the \nBIPA advances “no legitimate state interests,” yet places “significant burdens on the \nfundamental right to vote” and disproportionately burdens Native American voters.  \nDkt. 25 at 12.  \nARGUMENT   \n1.  The fundamental right to vote requires strict scrutiny of any statute \nimposing a burden on the ability to cast a ballot. \n \nThe State asks this Court to carve out a dangerous exception to the well-\nestablished rule that legislation implicating a fundamental constitutional right is \nevaluated  under  a  strict  scrutiny  standard.    Yet  the  State  provides  no  binding \nauthority supporting its argument that the right to vote should be treated differently \nthan its constitutional counterparts.  Rather, the State urges the Court to rely instead \non federal cases: Burdick v. Takushi 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992) and Anderson v. \nCelebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 789 (1983) to adopt the flexible “balancing test,” known \nas Anderson-Burdick.  This Court is not bound by Anderson-Burdick and should \ninstead reaffirm the established Montana rule that fundamental rights are subject to \nstrict scrutiny under the Montana Constitution. \n12 \n \n\nIn Montana, it is the “general rule” that strict scrutiny applies in voting rights \ncases.  Johnson v. Killingsworth, 271 Mont. 1, 4, 894 P.2d 272 (1995).  As the State \nconcedes, this Court has “not specifically applied the federal balancing test.”  State \nBr. at 10.  The U.S. Supreme Court decided Anderson in 1983 and Burdick in 1992.  \nSince then, every voting rights case decided by the Montana Supreme Court under \nour own Constitution has reaffirmed the general rule that strict scrutiny applies in \nvoting rights cases.  Killingsworth, 271 Mont. 1; Fink v. State ex rel. McGrath, 2003 \nMT 48, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576.   \nAnd there is good reason for this Court to refrain from adopting the federal \nAnderson-Burdick balancing test.  This Court has never been afraid to “walk alone” \nin terms of its divergence from federal constitutional interpretation.  State v. Long, \n216 Mont. 65, 69, 700 P.2d 153 (1985).  “In interpreting the Montana Constitution, \nthis  Court  has  repeatedly  refused  to  ‘march  lock-step’  with  the  United  States \nSupreme Court, even where the state constitutional provision at issue is nearly \nidentical to its federal counterpart.”  State v. Guillaume, 1999 MT 29, ¶ 16, 293 \nMont. 224, 975 P.2d 312. \nThe right to vote is foundational.  “No right is more precious in a free country \nthan that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, \nas good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the \nright to vote is undermined.”  Larson v. State, 2019 MT 28, 394 Mont. 167, 434 P.3d \n13 \n \n\n241  (McKinnon  dissent)  (citations  omitted).    The  suggestion  that  legislation \nimpacting this most fundamental right should be  subjected to a lower level of \nscrutiny runs counter to well-recognized principle that “the rights and guarantees \nafforded by the United States Constitution are minimal, and that states may interpret \nprovisions of their own constitutions to afford greater protection than the United \nStates Constitution.”  State v. Johnson (1986), 221 Mont. 503, 512, 719 P.2d 1248, \n1254. \nAnd in fact, Montana would not be “walking alone” in applying strict scrutiny \nto the BIPA and in rejecting the Anderson-Burdick test.  In Van Valkenburgh v. \nCitizens for Term Limits, 135 Idaho 121, 15 P.3d 1129, 2000 Ida., the Idaho Supreme \nCourt  rejected  the  Anderson-Burdick  test  and  held that  “[b]ecause the  right  of \nsuffrage is a fundamental right, strict scrutiny applies.” The Court distinguished \nAnderson-Burdick because, “Burdick did not deal with the Idaho Constitution and \ninstead was decided under the United States Constitution.”  Moreover, “[t]he ballot \ndesignation here relates to the very basic right of a voter to express support for a \ncandidate within the sanctity of the voting booth.  We find no reason to apply a \ndifferent standard to the exercise of this fundamental right and will apply strict \nscrutiny to our analysis of I.C. § 34-907B.”  Van Valkenburgh v. Citizens for Term \nLimits, 135 Idaho 121, 15 P.3d 1129, 2000 Ida.  \n14 \n \n\nThe State argues that the legislature can regulate the right to vote, and that is \nof course correct.  However, the State’s authority to regulate elections must be \nexercised “within constitutional limits.”  Larson, 2019 MT 28, ¶ 21.  The Legislature \ncertainly does not have authority to enact voting restrictions that run afoul of the \nMontana constitution.  Yet that is what the State argues – that because there is a \n“constitutional mandate directing that the Legislature. . .  enact laws controlling \nelections,”  State  Br.  at  13,  therefore  the  legislature  has  wide  discretion  to \ncircumscribe the fundamental right to vote.  This is not an outcome that this Court \nshould sanction.  And indeed it has not.   \nIn Finke, the Court applied strict scrutiny to a law that limited participation in \nmunicipal building code elections.  Finke, 2003 MT 48, ¶ 15.  The Court first noted \nthat increased state regulation might be permitted “in the event of a special-purpose \nunit of government whose functions affect a distinct group of citizens more than \nother citizens.”  Id., ¶ 19.  Nevertheless, the Court concluded that “that elections to \ndetermine who may impose and enforce building codes in a given area are general \ninterest rather than special interest elections.  This being so, a law restricting the \nfranchise may be upheld only upon the State showing a compelling interest.”  Id., ¶ \n21.  Indeed, as the Court (in 2002, ten years after Burdick was decided) held that \nmunicipal building code elections are subject to strict scrutiny, it is no doubt true \nthat the BIPA – a law impacting all Montanans – should likewise be reviewed under \n15 \n \n\nthat standard.  And that the Court relied upon federal authority to arrive at this result \nis not relevant – the Court appropriately relied on persuasive authority to create law \nthat is now mandatory.  To agree with the State and adopt the Anderson-Burdick test \nwould require this Court to expressly overrule Finke. \nThe State cites Killingsworth to support the proposition that Montana courts \nfollow federal law, but Killingsworth is distinguishable from the instant case.  In \nKillingsworth the Court took pains to note that application of the rational basis test \nderived from the fact that “Montana irrigation districts are special, limited-purpose \nunits  of  government,  the  activities  of  which  have  a  disproportionate  effect  on \nlandowners within such districts as a group.  As a result, it is appropriate to depart \nfrom the usual strict scrutiny applied to statutes impacting on a citizen’s right to \nvote and analyze the freeholder requirement contained in § 85-7-1501, MCA, under \nthe reasonable relationship standard.”  Killingsworth, 271 Mont. at 12 (emphasis \nadded).  Unlike the freeholder requirement at issue in Killingsworth, the BIPA \npotentially impacts every voter in Montana, and, in particular, the Intervenors.  \nVoting rights cases involving “general” governance issues such as “taxing authority, \nstreet maintenance, sanitation, health, or welfare services” are properly evaluated \nunder a strict scrutiny standard.  Killingsworth, 271 Mont. at 19. \n16 \n \n\nThus, in every case involving Montana’s general elections scheme the Court \nhas held that – with very narrow exceptions not applicable here – strict scrutiny \napplies. \nIn addition, the legislature’s authority to regulate voting is designed to ensure \nfree and fair elections, not limit them.  The vast majority of Montana’s statutes \nregulating elections (Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-101 et seq.) are designed to expand, \nnot  limit  the  franchise.    See,  e.g.  Mont.  Code  Ann.  § 13-13-111  (the  election \nadministrator shall provide a sufficient number of voting stations to allow voting to \nproceed with as little delay as possible); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-112 (instructions \nfor electors on how to prepare their ballots or use a voting system must be posted in \neach voting station provided for the preparation of ballots); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-\n13-114 (providing an expansive list of identification and documents to permit voter \nregistration);  Mont.  Code  Ann.  §  13-13-118  (providing  accommodations  for \ndisabled voters); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-13-120 (providing for poll watchers); Mont. \nCode Ann. § 13-13-122 (preventing obstructions to a polling place).  These statutes, \nwhich are designed to ensure free and fair elections, are examples of the appropriate \nexercise of the legislature’s authority to regulate voting. \nSubjecting  the  BIPA,  or  indeed  any  statute,  to  strict  scrutiny  does  not \nautomatically mean that it does not pass constitutional muster.  Instead, it must be \nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.  The District Court \n17 \n \n\npreliminarily found that the BIPA is neither narrowly tailored nor targeted at a \ncompelling state interest.  That is, the Plaintiffs established a prima facie case.  This \nmatter is scheduled for a District Court trial on September 14, 2020.  At that trial the \nState will have the opportunity to present facts and testimony demonstrating that the \nBIPA is narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest. \nFinally, the State argues that, using the police power, the Legislature may \ncircumscribe fundamental constitutional rights.  State’s Br. at 12-13.  No party \nwould argue otherwise.  In Wiser v. State, 2006 MT 20, 331 Mont. 28, 129 P.3d 133, \nthe  Court  rejected  denturists’  claims  that  they  should  not  be  regulated  by  the \nMontana Board of Dentistry.  The Court held that the police power circumscribes \ncertain fundamental rights: “The State of Montana holds police power to regulate \nfor the health and welfare of its citizens. . . Furthermore, the idea that the right to \npursue employment and life’s other ‘basic necessities’ is limited by the State’s police \npower is imbedded in the plain language of the Constitution.”  Wiser, ¶ 24.  The \nCourt found that regulation of denturists by the Board of Dentistry was necessary to \nprotect the health and welfare of Montanans.  Here, the fundamental right to vote \ncannot be circumscribed by the police power because there is no issue implicating \nthe health and welfare of Montana voters.  Nor does the State make any such \nassertion.    The  State  provides  no  other  authority  supporting  its  position  that \n18 \n \n\nfundamental rights can so circumscribed for a simple reason:  there is no such \nauthority. \nIt is clear that Montana’s fundamental rights – those that are either found in \nthe Declaration of Rights or rights “without which other constitutionally guaranteed \nrights would have little meaning” – are evaluated on a strict scrutiny standard.  Butte \nCommunity Union v. Lewis, 219 Mont. 426, 430, 712 P.2d 1309, 1311 (1986); \nSnetsinger v. Mont. Univ. Sys., 2004 MT 390, ¶ 17, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445; \nsee also, Oberg v. Billings, 207 Mont. 277, 674 P.2d 494 (1983) (“Examples of \nfundamental rights include privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, right to \nvote and right to interstate travel.”).  The right to vote “is protected in more than the \ninitial allocation of the franchise, [but also] the manner of its exercise.”  Big Spring \nv. Jore, 2005 MT 64, ¶ 18, 326 Mont. 256, 261, 109 P.3d 219, 222 (quoting Bush v. \nGore, 531 U.S. 98, 104-05 (2000)).  As far back as 1895, the Montana Supreme \nCourt held, “[s]tatutes tending to limit a citizen in the exercise of the right to vote \nshould be liberally construed in his favor.”  Stackpole v. Hallahan (1895), 16 Mont. \n40, 40 P. 80.  The State asks this Court to start down a dangerous path that inevitably \nleads to the erosion of these fundamental rights.  If the Court were to single out the \nright to vote for relaxed scrutiny, will the State next argue that the right to know, or \nthe right to free speech, or the right of privacy, likewise be evaluated using a federal \nbalancing test?  The Court should reject this invitation and reaffirm the intent of the \n19 \n \n\nframers that these rights are the building blocks of our democratic system.  Any \nlegislation burdening these fundamental rights must be evaluated according to the \nstrict scrutiny standard. \n2.  Under the strict scrutiny standard, the District Court properly \nenjoined the BIPA \n \nThe District Court correctly enjoined the BIPA and held that it was “subject \nto strict scrutiny and that the State must demonstrate through competent evidence \nthat the statutes further compelling state interests.” Dkt. 25 at 12. Voting is a \nfundamental right and therefore strict scrutiny must apply.  See argument, supra, at \n11-18.  The BIPA cannot survive strict scrutiny review. \na.  The State has not shown a compelling interest.   \n    The District Court found that the “BIPA serves no legitimate purpose,” Dkt. \n25 at 10 (emphasis added), and that the State failed to present “any evidence from \nany  election  official  that  the  BIPA:  (1)  will  promote  the  integrity,  security  or \nefficiency of absentee voting; (2) will reduce election costs or burdens; and (3) will \nincrease  voter  turnout,”  which  necessarily  means  that  the  State  “failed  to \ndemonstrate through competent evidence that there is any compelling state interest \nthat warrants the burdens and interference on the right to vote created by BIPA. . . .”  \nId. at 12 (emphasis added). \nThis Court has held:   \n20 \n \n\nStrict scrutiny of a legislative act requires the government to show a \ncompelling state interest for its action. When the government intrudes \nupon a fundamental right, any compelling state interest for doing so \nmust be closely tailored to effectuate only that compelling state interest. \nIn addition to the necessity that the State show a compelling state \ninterest for invasion of a fundamental right, the State, to sustain the \nvalidity of such invasion, must also show that the choice of legislative \naction is the least onerous path that can be taken to achieve the state \nobjective.  \n \nWadsworth v. State, 922 P.2d 1165, 1174 (1996) (internal citations omitted). \nThe State’s assertions concerning the potential for ballot fraud and voter \nintimidation are speculative and unsupported by any facts.  The State admits there is \nnot a single example of voter fraud in Montana caused by ballot collection.  State \nBr. at 34.  The State’s suggestion that the BIPA’s passage by a majority of the voters \nconstitutes  a  compelling interest  is  also  not  credible.    State Br.  at  28.    One’s \nfundamental right to vote does not depend on the outcome of any election, and a \ncitizen’s constitutional right to vote cannot be infringed simply because a majority \nof the people choose that it be.  Cf. United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013).  \nAnd the District Court properly rejected this argument: “[I]nitiatives must still pass \nconstitutional muster.  Whether enacted by the legislature or by voter referendum, \nstatutes cannot violate the Constitution.”  Dkt. 25 at 15.  The State does not meet its \nburden to present a compelling interest.  The State has infringed upon the Appellees’ \nand Intervenors’ fundamental right to vote without providing a compelling interest \nfor doing so.      \n21 \n \n\nb. The State has not shown that the BIPA is narrowly tailored.  \n \nThe State also fails to show that the BIPA is narrowly tailored to effectuate \nthe  State’s asserted compelling interest of preventing potential  fraud.    State  v. \nBrooks, 2012 MT 263, ¶ 17, 367 Mont. 59, 65, 289 P.3d 105, 109; Armstrong v. \nState, 1999 MT 261, ¶ 34, 296 Mont. 361, 373–74, 989 P.2d 364, 374.  The burden \nof proof to show that BIPA is narrowly tailored falls on the State.   In re Adoption \nof A.W.S., 2014 MT 322, ¶ 17, 377 Mont. 234, 238, 339 P.3d 414, 417; Snetsinger, \n2004 MT 390, ¶ 17.     \nOf  the  six  categories  of  individuals  who  can  collect  ballots,  the  BIPA \narbitrarily limits the number of ballots they may legally collect to six.  The State \noffers no interest for this specific limitation.  Assuming the State’s interest is to \nprevent ballot fraud and voter intimidation, the random limit of six is not narrowly \ntailored to achieve that.  At the House Committee on the Judiciary hearing to \nconsider the bill, in response to a question of, “how did you decide on the number \nof six,” Senator Olszweski stated he performed a “small survey sample” and did not \nspeak to any organizations like Western Native Voice.  Dkt. 7 at 4.  Nothing in the \nlegislative history suggests that limiting the collection to just six ballots somehow \naddresses fraud.    \nMoreover, BIPA applies to all ballots collected, even when affirmatively \nsolicited by voters themselves.  And the BIPA apparently applies only to ballots \n22 \n \n\ndelivered in person, and not ballots returned by mail.  This arbitrary distinction \ndemonstrates conclusively that the BIPA is not narrowly tailored.   \nAssuming  there  is  a  potential  for  fraud  in  Montana  related  to  ballot \ncollection—and the State admits it cannot show there ever has been any such fraud—\nthe BIPA does not solve that problem.  At each hearing on the BIPA, a representative \nof the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders testified that BIPA targets voters \nwho are “doing things right, rather than creating a deterrent for the people who would \ndo things wrong.”  Dkt 16, Exh. 1 at 9.  Audrey McCue, the Lewis and Clark County \nElections Administrator, further testified that BIPA needed to be specific and clear \nin defining “ballot interference” and make only that conduct illegal.  Id. at 7. Linda \nStoll, representing the Montana Association of Clerk and Recorders, testified that \nthe clerks had proposed tailored measures to address the alleged issues with ballot \ninterference or tampering and those measures were rejected by the bill sponsor.  Id.; \nDkt. 15 at ¶ 15.  The Court should give great weight to this testimony because \nelection administrators have firsthand knowledge of how elections in Montana are \nadministered.  See Upper Missouri Waterkeeper v. Montana Dep't of Envtl. Quality, \n2019 MT 81, ¶ 23, 395 Mont. 263, 273, 438 P.3d 792, 798. \nIn any event, Montana law already prohibits coercion or undue influence of \nvoters.  Mont. Code Ann. § 27-1-1501 et seq.  There are a number of other statutes \nthat  make  it  illegal  to  engage  in  voter  fraud,  voter  intimidation  and  ballot \n23 \n \n\ninterference.  See Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-214 (illegal influence of voters); Mont. \nCode Ann. § 13-35-218 (coercion or undue influence of voters); Mont. Code Ann. § \n13-35-235 (incorrect election procedures information); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-27-\n106  (violations—penalties—false  petition);  Mont.  Code  Ann.  §  13-35-207 \n(deceptive election practices); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-215 (illegal consideration \nfrom voting); Mont. Code Ann. § 13-35-201 (electors and ballots); Mont. Code Ann. \n§ 13-35-205 (tampering with election records and information); Mont. Code Ann. § \n13-35-604 (return of voter registration and absentee ballot applications).  It is not \nclear what, if any, marginal benefit the BIPA produces over this existing fraud \ndeterrent as the State was unable to articulate any.  The State may deter or eliminate \npotential fraud with legislation more narrowly drawn. But the BIPA’s prohibitions \nclearly are not. \nc.  The BIPA is not the least restrictive means. \nFinally, the State has not shown the BIPA is the least restrictive means to \nachieve the State’s objectives.  The BIPA’s prohibition on the collection of a voter’s \nballot does not take into account the severe obstacles to vote faced by Native \nAmericans.  Assistance from someone who is willing to deliver their ballots for them \nmay  be  the  only  way  they  can  participate  in  elections  and  to  access  their \nconstitutional right to vote.  Dkt. 16, Exh. 23 at ¶ 26.  However, ballot collectors are \nunderstandably fearful of criminal penalties if they collect and deliver community \n24 \n \n\nmembers’ ballots.  Id., ¶ 24.  “BIPA puts our communities and clients in a difficult \nposition.  Either we must subject some of our members engaged in critical GOTV \nwork to legal scrutiny and potential incarceration, or we must effectively suspend \nour ballot collection operations.”  Id., ¶ 25.  The law should not suppress lawful \nconduct in furtherance of the right to vote as a means to suppress unlawful conduct.  \nSee Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 255 (2002).   The BIPA \ndisenfranchises Native American voters and as such, cannot be the least onerous \npath.     \nMontana’s numerical limit on the number of ballots collected makes it one of \nonly 11 other states in the entire country that place a strict limit on the number of \nballots that may be collected.  Notwithstanding the severe burden that the BIPA \nplaces on Native Americans living on rural reservations, the fact alone that 39 other \nstates are able to find a way to conduct fair elections in a less burdensome manner \nthan Montana shows that the BIPA is not the least onerous path.  The vast majority \nof other states regulate elections in a manner that imposes on fewer voters’ rights.      \n3.  Even applying a flexible federal court test, the BIPA was properly \nenjoined. \n \nThough the BIPA should be evaluated under a strict scrutiny standard, even \nunder the Anderson-Burdick balancing test, the District Court properly enjoined the \nstatute.  When applying the Anderson-Burdick balancing test to a state election law, \ncourts “must weigh ‘the character and magnitude of the asserted injury’” to the \n25 \n \n\nplaintiff’s constitutional rights “against ‘the precise interests put forward by the State \nas justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,’ taking into consideration ‘the \nextent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff’s rights.’” \nBurdick, 504 U.S. at 434 (quoting Anderson, 460 U.S. at 789).  Under this balancing \ntest, a court’s “inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the \nextent to which a challenged regulation burdens” the plaintiff’s constitutional rights.  \nId.  No matter what standard the Court imposes under Anderson-Burdick, the BIPA \nwould fail.   \nWhen assessing the severity of the burden on plaintiffs’ right to vote under \nAnderson-Burdick, “courts may consider not only a given law’s impact on the \nelectorate in general, but also its impact on subgroups, for whom the burden, when \nconsidered in context, may be more severe.”  Pub. Integrity All., Inc. v. City of \nTucson, 836 F.3d 1019, 1025, n. 2 (9th Cir. 2016).  In fact, it is imperative that courts \nlook at the effect on plaintiffs and the groups they represent because the right to vote \nis “individual and personal in nature.”  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 561, 84 S. \nCt. 1362, 1381, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964); see also, Veasey v. Abbott, 830 F.3d 216, \n249, n. 40 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (“The right to vote is personal and is not defeated \nby the fact that 99% of other people can secure the necessary credentials easily.”) \n(citations omitted).  The touchstone of the burden analysis, then, is how significantly \nthe restriction threatens the right to vote for those voters who are harmed.  \n26 \n \n\n“Plaintiffs [do] not need to show that they were legally prohibited from voting, \nbut only that ‘burdened voters have few alternate means of access to the ballot.’” \nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 431 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Citizens for \nLegislative Choice v. Miller, 144 F.3d 916, 921 (6th Cir. 1998)).  Intervenors easily \nmeet this standard.   \nBecause  the  BIPA  imposes  “severe  restrictions”  on  Appellees’  and \nIntervenors’  constitutional  rights,  “the  regulation  must  be  ‘narrowly  drawn  to \nadvance a state interest of compelling importance.’” See id. (quoting Norman v. \nReed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992)).  The District Court correctly found that the BIPA \nadvances  “no  legitimate  state interests,”  yet  places  “significant  burdens  on the \nfundamental right to vote” and disproportionately burdens Native American voters. \nDkt. 25 at 7, 12. Native American voters in Montana face significant obstacles to \nvoting, including limited access to residential mail service, geographic isolation, and \npoverty. Dkt. 16, Ex. 22 at 3–4, 9; Dkt. 16, Exh. 23 at ¶¶ 16–19. Native Americans \nliving on reservations rely heavily on ballot collection and conveyance to cast their \nvotes, and the BIPA significantly infringes on their ability to fully exercise their right \nto vote by taking away that mechanism. Dkt. 16, Ex. 22 at 9, 11; Dkt. 15 at ¶ 20; \nDkt. 16, Exh. 23 at ¶ 26 (stating that “BIPA is likely to pose an insurmountable \nbarrier” and “Native Americans in Montana will be disenfranchised because of this \nlaw”). The State’s arguments that the BIPA’s burden on the right to vote is minimal, \n27 \n \n\nif any, miss the mark. See State’s Br. at 28–30. These arguments ignore Appellees’ \nand Interveners’ extensive evidence and fall far short of overcoming the great \ndeference  that  must  be  afforded  to  the  District  Court’s  finding  that  the  BIPA \nsignificantly burdens the right to vote.  \nThe District Court’s finding that BIPA causes a significant burden on the right \nto vote is in line with recent federal precedent on ballot collection bans.  An en banc \npanel of the Ninth Circuit recently held that Arizona’s similar ballot collection ban \nhad both the effect and intent of burdening the right to vote of Arizona’s minority \npopulation, including the Native American population, under Section 2 of the Voting \nRights Act.  Democratic Nat'l Comm. v. Hobbs, 948 F.3d 989, 1037, 1046 (9th Cir. \n2020); see also, Feldman v. Arizona Sec'y of State's Office, 840 F.3d 1057, 1090 (9th \nCir. 2016) (“When one balances the serious burdens placed on minorities [including \nNative American voters] by [the Arizona ballot collection ban] against the extremely \nweak justification offered by the state, one can only conclude under the Anderson–\nBurdick analysis that the plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of their Fourteenth Amendment claim.”)  (Thomas, J dissenting).  Like the \nArizona  ballot  collection  ban,  BIPA  results  in  a  “denial  or  abridgement  of” \nPlaintiffs’ right to vote.  Democratic Nat'l Comm., 948 F.3d at 1037. \nThe State must provide evidence to support its contention that the burden on \nIntervenors’ rights is justified to meet State’s interest.  The Ninth Circuit has found \n28 \n \n\nthat  “speculative  concern[s]”  is  not  sufficient “as  a  matter  of  law to \njustify any regulation that burdens a plaintiff’s right, especially where that burden is \nmore than de minimis.”  Soltysik v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 438, 448 (9th Cir. 2018); see \nalso, Ne. Ohio Coal. for Homeless v. Husted, 696 F.3d 580, 599 (6th Cir. 2012) (The \nstate’s “vague public interest concerns” cannot outweigh the harm to plaintiffs).  \nThere needs to be some “assessment of whether alternative methods would advance \nthe proffered governmental interests,” and the State may also “be required to offer \nevidence  that  its  regulation  of  the  political  process  is  a  reasonable  means  of \nachieving the state’s desired ends.’” Soltysik, 910 F.3d at 448.   \nThe State has not shown a compelling interest or that the BIPA is narrowly \ndrawn to advance such an interest.  See supra, at 19-23.  As discussed more fully \nsupra, the State has only offered vague invocations of voter fraud and election \nintegrity to support BIPA.  The State has provided no evidence that voter fraud is \nactually a problem in Montana or that the BIPA would solve voter fraud.  Further, \nas discussed supra, if voter fraud, voter intimidation, and ballot interference are a \nconcern, there are already other means though a number of statutes already on the \nbooks of combating these concerns.  With so many statutes already making it illegal \nto engage in nefarious conduct in relation to the handling of ballots and elections in \ngeneral, the BIPA was not and is not necessary.  Further the BIPA is overbroad as \nthe BIPA applies to all ballots collected, even when affirmatively solicited by voters \n29 \n \n\nthemselves.  In the words of the clerks in charge of running elections, the BIPA \ntarget voters who “are doing things right, rather than creating a deterrent for the \npeople who would do things wrong.”  Dkt. 16, Exh. 1 at 9.   \nEven were the court to find that the BIPA’s burden on Intervenors’ rights is \nnot severe, the BIPA would still fail Anderson-Burdick.  The Ninth Circuit has held \nthat, even for less than severe burdens, Anderson-Burdick is not a “rational basis \ntest” but rather a “means-end fit framework” that requires more than speculative \nstate concern.  Soltysik, 910 F.3d at 448–49 (“Permitting a state to justify any non-\nsevere voting regulation with a merely ‘speculative concern of voter confusion,’ . . . \nwould convert Anderson/Burdick’s means-end fit framework into ordinary rational-\nbasis review wherever the burden a challenged regulation imposes is less than \nsevere. We have already rejected such an approach.” (citations omitted).); Pub. \nIntegrity All., Inc. v. City of Tucson, 836 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) \n(rejecting the notion that Anderson-Burdick calls for “rational basis review”).   \nUnder the balancing test, even in “instances where a burden is not severe \nenough to warrant strict scrutiny review [it can be] serious enough to require an \nassessment  of  whether  alternative  methods  would  advance  the  proffered \ngovernmental interests.”  Soltysik, 910 F.3d at 448.  The BIPA cannot meet any \nbalancing test because it is an irrational regulation that serves no legitimate purpose, \ndisproportionately burdens groups of voters, including Native Americans, and places \n30 \n \n\nsignificant administrative burdens on county election officials. Dkt. 16, Exh. 23 at \n¶¶ 16–19, 26; Dkt. 15 at ¶¶ 17, 20.  \nThe State has arbitrarily and irrationally interpreted the BIPA as applying only \nto ballots conveyed in person and not ballots returned by mail.  There is no reason \nto believe that prohibiting ballot collection and conveyance in person but permitting \nit via mail would prevent fraud or voter intimidation. And there is no reason to \nbelieve that voters will have more confidence in the integrity of elections if ballots \ncan be collected and delivered to the post office but not the election administrator’s \noffice. Under the Anderson-Burdick balancing test, a burden on the right to vote \ntriggers a higher level of scrutiny than rational basis review, but the BIPA has no \nlegitimate rational basis and fails to meet even rational basis review. See Pub. \nIntegrity All., 836 F.3d at 1025. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the district court should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted this 27th day of July, 2020. \n \n/s/ Alex Rate                                                  \n            Alex Rate \n            Legal Director \n            ACLU of Montana \n \nCounsel for Intervenors \n \n \n \n31 \n \n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \n  The undersigned, Alex Rate, certifies that the foregoing complies with the \nrequirements of Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure 11 and 12.
