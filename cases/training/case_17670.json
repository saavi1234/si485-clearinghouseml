    "summary": "<p>On July 1, 2020, four individuals incarcerated in the Clayton County Jail filed this class-action suit against Clayton County, Georgia in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. As the COVID-19 pandemic was sweeping through jails and prisons across the country, the plaintiffs alleged that the jail ignored the health and safety of its inmates. Instead of decreasing its population, like other jails and prisons across the country and Georgia, Clayton County jail increased its population. The jail was infested with mold, mildew, cockroaches, and rodents, inmates were told to use underwear for face coverings, and many inmates were forced to sleep on the floor next to open toilets. Social distancing was nonexistent, jail staff did not educate inmates about COVID-19 risks or prevention, and inmates who became ill waited up to a week to be treated by medical staff.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the ACLU, the ACLU of Georgia, and the Southern Center for Human Rights, the plaintiffs sued Clayton County under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983, alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs claimed that because their incarceration was unconstitutional, the court should issue a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2241 and 2243. They also brought claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (&ldquo;ADA&rdquo;) and the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. &sect;2201-2202.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought certification of two classes, each with two subclasses:</p>\r\n<ol>the Pretrial Class, composed of all inmates who were at the Clayton County jail awaiting trial, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a Medically Vulnerable Subclass (inmates with medical conditions which placed them at higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19), and</li>\r\n<li>a Disabilities Subclass (inmates whose medical conditions also qualified as disabilities under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act); and</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol>the Post-Adjudication Class, composed of all inmates who were serving time in the prison following conviction of a crime, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a Medically Vulnerable Subclass (inmates with medical conditions which placed them at higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19), and</li>\r\n<li>a Disabilities Subclass (inmates whose medical conditions also qualified as disabilities under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs&nbsp;sought release or transfer for all members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disabilities Subclasses; an injunction requiring the jail to adopt measures to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection for the remaining inmates (including social distancing and personal protective equipment); a writ of habeas corpus directing the immediate transfer or release of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses; and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class. A few days later, on July 9, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; request for preliminary injunctive relief, stating that such a request must be made by separate motion, not in the complaint. The plaintiffs filed a separate motion for a preliminary injunction on July 27, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On August 3, 2020, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that they were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, and that the plaintiffs failed to state both a habeas claim and an ADA claim.</p>\r\n<p>On August 4, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to stay the case or in the alternative a motion for an extension of time to file a response in opposition to the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. In the motion, the plaintiffs asked the court to order the defendants to create and file a reasonably specific written plan&mdash;developed in consultation with the Georgia Department of Public Health and/or a qualified medical or public health expert in preventing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases.</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2020, Magistrate Judge Christopher C. Bly filed a non-final report that recommended that one of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims be dismissed as he had been released from jail, that the remaining plaintiffs&rsquo; claims of deliberate indifference be allowed to proceed, and that the remaining plaintiffs&rsquo; remaining claims be dismissed for failure to state a claim.On November 19, 2020, Judge Boulee adopted Magistrate Judge Bly&rsquo;s non-final report and recommendation. Thus, Judge Boulee granted in part and denied in part the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. Judge Boulee also denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay the case.</p>\r\n<p>On December 24, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 7664773. The court found that the plaintiffs failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim since the plaintiffs did not provide enough evidence to demonstrate that it was likely that the defendants&rsquo; COVID-19 response was so deficient that it rose to the level of deliberate indifference. The court then cited actions the defendants took to prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as requiring masks in the facility and providing inmates with two masks.</p>\r\n<p>On December 29, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification. The court granted certifications for all six classes: one class of pretrial detainees, one class of post-adjudication detainees and four subclasses.</p>\r\n<p>On February 8, 2021, the court referred the case to mediation. The plaintiffs and the defendants did not settle during this settlement conference, and the case continued with discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On July 23, 2021, the parties filed a joint motion to stay discovery. Two days later, on July 26, 2021, the court granted the joint motion to stay discovery for 30 days. The case resumed with discovery in September.</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to stay the case for an order referring the case to mediation. The next day, the court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay the case and ordered the case be referred to Magistrate Judge J. Clay Fuller for mediation.</p>\r\n<p>On June 3, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion to stay the case. Three days later, on June 6, 2022, the court granted the motion to stay the action for four months to facilitate the parties&rsquo; agreed terms for resolving the case. On November 4, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion to continue the stay. The same day, the court granted the motion to stay the action further until January 1, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On December 15, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice. Each party agreed to bear its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. In a press release, the ACLU and Southern Center for Human Rights stated that the lawsuit was being dismissed based on the shift in pandemic circumstances, but noted that the dire conditions and dangers inside the Clayton County Jail would continue to persist, and the inmates inside the jail would remain unsafe. On January 4, 2023, the court approved the stipulation of dismissal, and the case was closed on March 13, 2023. The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "Inmates at the Clayton County Jail filed a class-action lawsuit against Clayton County, Georgia, alleging that the Clayton County jail was not sufficiently protecting its inmates against the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs claimed that the Clayton County jail was infested with mold, cockroaches, and rodents, and inmates were given insufficient personal protective equipment, social distancing was impossible, and many prisoners were forced to sleep on the floor next to open toilets. The plaintiffs brought this petition for habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, seeking, on behalf of a class, an order requiring the jail to immediately release prisoners in an effort to de-densify, and to take other precautions against a possible outbreak of COVID-19. On July 2, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class, which was granted on December 29, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 7664773. The parties filed multiple motions to stay the case.

      "text": "Case 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 130   Filed 12/29/20   Page 1 of 5\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA \nATLANTA DIVISION \nRHONDA JONES, et al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv.         CIVIL ACTION NO. \n       1:20-CV-02791-JPB \nVICTOR HILL, in his official capacity \nas Sheriff of Clayton County, Georgia, \net al., \nDefendants. \nORDER \nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification.  \n[Doc. 7].  In their motion, Plaintiffs sought certification of six classes:  one class of \npretrial detainees, one class of post-adjudication detainees and four subclasses.1  \nId. at 1.  Defendants did not file a response to the motion, and therefore the motion \nis deemed unopposed.2  See LR 7.1(B) (Failure to file a response shall indicate that \nthere is no opposition to the motion.).  This Court finds as follows:   \n1 Plaintiffs subsequently submitted a proposed order wherein they seek the certification of \nonly two classes:  (1) a class of all Clayton County Jail detainees; and (2) a class of \nmedically vulnerable detainees.  [Doc. 123-1].   \n2 Even though Defendants did not file a response to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class \nCertification, they did file an objection to the form of Plaintiffs’ proposed order and \nargued that only the Principal Class of detainees should be certified.  [Doc. 127].     \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 130   Filed 12/29/20   Page 2 of 5\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs class certification.  Class \ncertification is proper where the party seeking certification demonstrates that:  (1) \neach of the prerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) have meet met; \nand (2) the proposed class has satisfied at least one of the requirements listed in \nRule 23(b).  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 345 (2011).  Rule 23(a) \nrequires a showing that:  (1) the proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable; (2) there are common questions of law or fact common \nto the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of \nthe claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition to \nthese requirements, a party must also demonstrate one of the following:  (1) a risk \nthat separate actions would create incompatible standards of conduct for the \ndefendant or prejudice individual class members not parties to the action; (2) the \ndefendant has treated the members of the class as a class, making appropriate \ninjunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or (3) common \nquestions of law or fact predominate over questions affecting individual members \nand that a class action is a superior method for fairly and efficiently adjudicating \nthe action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)-(3).  \nIn this case and in light of Defendants’ lack of opposition, the Court finds \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 130   Filed 12/29/20   Page 3 of 5\nthat Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden to show each of the necessary \nrequirements under Rule 23(a).  Moreover, they have also met their burden to show \nthat a risk exists that separate actions would create incompatible standards of \nconduct and adjudications and that injunctive or declaratory relief would be \nappropriate with respect to the class as a whole.  Because class certification is \nproper, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification [Doc. 7] is GRANTED.   \nThe Principal Class is defined as follows:  All persons who are now or will \nin the future be detained in the Clayton County Jail.  Certification of this class is \nappropriate because Plaintiffs’ only remaining claim for relief concerns \nDefendants’ alleged deliberate indifference to conditions affecting detainees \ngenerally, regardless of the status of their criminal cases.  Although deliberate \nindifference to a substantial risk of serious illness implicates different \nconstitutional rights for pretrial detainees and convicted detainees—with pretrial \ndetainees’ rights arising under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and \nconvicted detainees’ rights arising under the Eighth Amendment Cruel and \nUnusual Punishments Clause—under Eleventh Circuit precedent the deliberate-\nindifference standard applies to each group in exactly the same way. See Swain v. \nJunior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1088 (11th Cir. 2020) (stating that “the same scrutiny” \napplies to deliberate indifference claims under the Fourteenth and Eighth \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 130   Filed 12/29/20   Page 4 of 5\nAmendments).  Ultimately, a class consisting of all Clayton County Jail detainees \nis workable in this case. \nThis Court will also certify a Medical Vulnerable Subclass, which is defined \nas follows:  All persons in the Clayton County Jail whose age or medical \nconditions make them susceptible to serious illness or death if they contract \nCOVID-19, specifically, people aged 55 or older, or people who have been \ndiagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for, the following conditions:  asthma \n(moderate to severe); cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; COPD \n(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); cystic fibrosis; diabetes mellitus (types 1 \nand 2); serious heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or \ncardiomyopathies); hypertension; immunocompromised state (from solid organ \ntransplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of \ncorticosteroids or use of other immune weakening medicines); liver disease; \nneurologic conditions (such as dementia); obesity (body mass index of 30 or \nhigher); pregnancy; pulmonary fibrosis; sickle cell disease; or thalassemia. \nCertification of this subclass is appropriate because Plaintiffs alleged in thir \nComplaint that certain detainees are more vulnerable to COVID- 19 and require \ngreater protections—due to age or preexisting medical conditions—that \nDefendants have failed to provide.  [See Doc. 1, pp. 65-68].  Here, medically \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 130   Filed 12/29/20   Page 5 of 5\nvulnerable detainees may have claims for special protections from COVID-19 not \nshared by all Clayton County Jail detainees. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ counsel are appointed as \ncounsel for each class.  Plaintiffs Barry Watkins and Michael Singleton shall serve \nas class representatives for each class.    \nSO ORDERED this 29th day of December, 2020. \n \n5 ",

(Doc. 1.)2 As more fully discussed in a separate \norder, Plaintiffs have not fully paid the filing fee, but the Court will exercise its \ndiscretion to move forward with this case. \nDefendants  move  to  dismiss  the  complaint  for  numerous  reasons, \nincluding lack of jurisdiction, failure to exhaust, and failure to state a claim. (Doc. \n \n1 Mitchell has since been released from the CCJ. (Doc. 23-1 at 14.) \n2 Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction and class-action certification; these \nmatters will be considered separately. \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 2 of 40\n \n23.) For the reasons stated below, it is RECOMMENDED that Defendants’ motion \nto dismiss (Doc. 23) be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, Plaintiff \nRandolph Mitchell’s individual claims be DISMISSED, the remaining Plaintiffs’ \nclaims  of  deliberate  indifference  be  ALLOWED  TO  PROCEED,  and  the \nremaining Plaintiffs’ remaining claims be DISMISSED. \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs are various inmates confined at the CCJ. Jones, a 58-year-old \nfemale with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is in pretrial detention at the \nCCJ. (Doc. 1 at 12.) Watkins, a 60-year-old male with diabetes, is also in pretrial \ndetention at the CCJ. (Id. at 13.) Mitchell, a 72-year-old male with high blood \npressure and a heart condition, was confined to the CCJ pursuant to a 12-month \nsentence for simple battery. (Id. at 12.) And Singleton, a 59-year-old male with \nhigh blood pressure, is confined to the CCJ pursuant to a one-year sentence for \nviolating probation. (Id. at 13.) Plaintiffs seek class certification for two classes and \nfour subclasses: a Principal Pretrial Class and Principal Post-Adjudication Class; \nand  a  Medically  Vulnerable  Pretrial  Subclass,  Medically  Vulnerable  Post-\nAdjudication  Subclass,  Disability  Pretrial  Subclass,  and  Disability  Post-\nAdjudication Subclass. (Id. at 75-99.) They propose that Jones and Watkins will \nrepresent the Principal Pretrial Class, Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Subclass, and \nDisability  Pretrial  Subclass;  and  Mitchell  and  Singleton  will  represent  the \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 3 of 40\n \nPrincipal  Post-Adjudication  Class,  Medically  Vulnerable  Post-Adjudication \nSubclass, and Disability Post-Adjudication Subclass. (Id. at 76, 84, 92; id. at 79, 88, \n96.) \nAccording to Plaintiffs’ complaint, conditions at the CCJ are poor, and, \nsince the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, Defendants have failed to take \nappropriate  actions  to  ensure  Plaintiffs’  safety,  such  as  implementing  social \ndistancing  measures and providing adequate cleaning supplies and personal \nprotective equipment. (See generally id. at 17-75.) Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, \nincluding releasing or transferring inmates and improving measures to prevent \nthe spread of COVID-19 at the CCJ. (Id. at 109.) \nII.  DISCUSSION \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, a federal court is required to conduct an \ninitial screening of a prisoner complaint to determine whether the action is (1) \nfrivolous or malicious; (2) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or \n(3) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. \n“To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a complaint must include \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the alleged misconduct.” Waldman v. Conway, 871 F.3d 1283, \n1289 (11th Cir. 2017). A well-pleaded complaint “requires more than labels and \nconclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 4 of 40\n \nnot do.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). “Nor does a complaint \nsuffice if it tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.” \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (brackets and internal quotation marks \nomitted). Ultimately, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. A complaint describing \nmisconduct that is merely possible, as opposed to plausible, “has alleged—but it \nhas  not  shown—that  the  pleader  is  entitled  to  relief.”  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  at  679 \n(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, “an unadorned, the-\ndefendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation” is insufficient to “nudge[]” a claim \n“across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570; Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. at 678. \nA.  Standing \nThe parties dispute whether Plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive \nrelief, and this Court is obligated to consider whether it has jurisdiction over this \ncase. Lewis v. Governor of Alabama, 944 F.3d 1287, 1296 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc) \n(“Because standing to sue implicates jurisdiction, a court must satisfy itself that \nthe plaintiff has standing before proceeding to consider the merits of her claim, \nno matter how weighty or interesting.”). \nFederal courts have the power to hear only live cases or controversies. U.S. \nConstitution art. III. As a result of this requirement, a plaintiff must have standing \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 5 of 40\n \nto pursue an action in federal court. Trichell v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc., 964 F.3d \n990,  996  (11th  Cir.  2020).  To  show  standing,  a  plaintiff  must  establish  three \nelements: “the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact, the defendant must \nhave caused that injury, and a favorable decision must be likely to redress it.” Id. \n1.  Injury in Fact \nOf the three elements of standing, “[t]he foremost standing requirement is \ninjury in fact.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). This consists of “an invasion \nof a legally protected interest that is both concrete and particularized and actual \nor  imminent,  not  conjectural  or  hypothetical.”  Id.  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). “When a plaintiff seeks prospective relief to prevent a future injury, it \nmust establish that the threatened injury is certainly impending.” Indep. Party of \nFla. v. Sec’y, State of Fla., 967 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 2020) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nDefendants  argue  that Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  allege an  injury  in  fact \nsufficient to establish standing because the risk of contracting COVID-19 is too \nspeculative. (Doc. 23-1 at 17-19.) COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus that \nspreads  quickly  through  closed  environments  like  jails,  and  “[c]ourts  have \nrepeatedly  held  that  the  highly  contagious  nature  of  this  dangerous  and \npotentially fatal virus is sufficient to establish an alleged injury that is concrete \nand legally particularized.” Hango v. Adducci, No. 1:19-CV-606, 2020 WL 3271061, \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 6 of 40\n \nat *5 (N.D. Ohio June 17, 2020) (collecting cases); Martinez Franco v. Jennings, ___ \nF. Supp. 3d ___, ___, No. 20-CV-02474-CRB, 2020 WL 1976423, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. \n24, 2020) (noting that the argument that a plaintiff lacks standing because the risk \nof contracting COVID-19 is too speculative “has been rejected by many, and \nperhaps all, courts that have considered it”); see also Matos v. Lopez Vega, ___ F. \nSupp. 3d ___, ___, No. 20-CIV-60784-RAR, 2020 WL 2298775, at *7 (S.D. Fla. May \n6, 2020) (“Although they may never contract COVID-19, the alleged injury is \nconcrete enough to survive challenges to standing given the rapid spread and \nhighly contagious nature of the virus. Moreover, Petitioners need not wait to \ncontract COVID-19 to demonstrate an injury in fact.”); Helling v. McKinney, 509 \nU.S. 25, 33 (1993) (explaining that “a remedy for unsafe conditions need not await \na tragic event”). Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged an injury in fact. \n2.  Traceability and Redressability \n“[A] plaintiff’s injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court.” Jacobson v. Fla. Sec’y of State, ___ F.3d ___, ___, No. 19-14552, \n2020  WL  5289377,  at  *11  (11th  Cir.  Sept.  3,  2020)  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). In evaluating redressability, a court must consider “whether a decision \nin a plaintiff’s favor would significantly increase the likelihood that she would \nobtain relief that directly redresses the injury that she claims to have suffered.” \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 7 of 40\n \nLewis, 944 F.3d at 1301 (brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted). \nWith respect to any relief obtained, “it must be the effect of the court’s judgment \non the defendant—not an absent third party—that redresses the plaintiff’s injury, \nwhether  directly  or  indirectly.”  Id.  (emphasis  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing, at least with respect to their \ndemand for a change in the CCJ’s medical protocols and treatment, because their \ninjury is not traceable to or redressable by any named Defendant. (Doc. 23-1 at 19-\n21.) In particular, they contend that CorrectHealth, LLC, is the medical provider \nfor the CCJ and thus bears responsibility for the medical care provided at the CCJ. \n(Id. at 19.) And because CorrectHealth is a third party, they argue, it is not bound \nby any injunction that this Court might issue. (Id. at 20.) As a result, because \nPlaintiffs have failed to name CorrectHealth, a necessary party, as a defendant, \nthey  lack  any  redressable  remedy  from  Defendants  and  consequently  lack \nstanding. (Id. at 20-21.) \nPlaintiffs, however, have sufficiently shown that their alleged injuries are \ntraceable to and redressable by Defendants. Plaintiffs allege that it is due to \nDefendants’ failure to enact policies that they have been injured, for example: \nAlthough  jailers  have  quarantined  certain  pods  where \ndetainees have exhibited COVID-19 symptoms (keeping both people \nwho tested positive and people who tested negative in the same \nhousing  area  and,  in  some  cases,  in  the  same  cell),  there  is  no \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 8 of 40\n \nproactive  effort  to  check  detainees’  temperatures  in  units  where \nCOVID-19 cases are suspected by jailers. \n. . . . \nAfter a detainee exhibits symptoms of the virus, Defendants \nhave no procedure for determining which detainees have been in \nclose contact with the sick detainee and then testing them. \n(Doc. 1 at 69, 70.) Whether CorrectHealth, in any failure to take appropriate steps \non its own initiative to prevent the spread of COVID-19, caused injury to Plaintiffs \nis a separate question from whether Defendants injured Plaintiffs. See Jacobson, \n2020  WL  5289377,  at  *11. Furthermore,  although  Defendants  are correct  that \nCorrectHealth is a third party, CorrectHealth, as the medical provider for the CCJ \ncontractually acting under the authority of Defendant Hill, would be bound by \nthis  Court’s  order  because  Defendants  can  legally  direct  CorrectHealth  to \nimplement any steps ordered by the Court. See Lewis, 944 F.3d at 1301; (Doc. 1 at \n14  (alleging  that Defendant  Hill  is  required to  operate  the  CCJ,  to  maintain \ncustody  of  those  in  the  CCJ,  and  to  ensure  safe  and  sanitary  conditions  of \nconfinement)). In essence, Defendants conflate standing with the merits of a claim \nagainst CorrectHealth. Plaintiffs, however, sued Defendants, not CorrectHealth. \nBecause Defendants can redress Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries by taking actions such \nas releasing inmates or providing supplies or personal protective equipment, \nPlaintiffs  have  sufficiently  alleged  that  their  injuries  are  traceable  to  and \nredressable by Defendants. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 9 of 40\n \nB.  Mootness \n“Mootness arises when an issue presented in a case is no longer live or the \nparties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” Keohane v. Fla. Dep’t of \nCorr. Sec’y, 952 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nA case must be dismissed as moot “if events that occur subsequent to the filing of \na lawsuit deprive the court of the ability to give the plaintiff meaningful relief,” \nsince the case no longer presents a live case or controversy as required by Article \nIII  of  the  Constitution.  Id.  (brackets,  ellipsis,  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). Mootness is jurisdictional. Id. \n“The general rule . . . is that a transfer or a release of a prisoner from prison \nwill moot that prisoner’s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.” Smith v. \nAllen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir. 2007), abrogated on other grounds by Sossamon v. \nTexas, 563 U.S. 277 (2011); see also Wahl v. McIver, 773 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir. \n1985) (“Absent class certification, an inmate’s claim for injunctive and declaratory \nrelief in a section 1983 action fails to present a case or controversy once the inmate \nhas been transferred.”). As the parties note, Plaintiff Mitchell has been released \nfrom the CCJ. (Doc. 37 at 19 n.8; Doc. 40 at 10.) Smith thus applies to moot \nMitchell’s claims. However, because Plaintiff Singleton also proposes to represent \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 10 of 40\n \nthe same classes as Mitchell, and Singleton’s claims remain live, the claims of the \nproposed classes remain live.3 \nC.  Exhaustion \nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (PLRA), “[n]o action shall \nbe brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or \nany  other  Federal  law,  by  a  prisoner  confined  in  any  jail,  prison,  or  other \ncorrectional  facility  until  such  administrative  remedies  as  are  available  are \nexhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The PLRA requires proper exhaustion, including \ncompliance with deadlines and other procedural rules, before a prisoner can file \n \n3 Even if Mitchell were the only named plaintiff for the proposed classes, \nthe classes’ claims would not be moot because subsequent class certification will \nrelate back to the date of the filing of the complaint. See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n402 n.11 (1975); see also County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991) \n(“That the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs’ claims had \nbecome moot does not deprive us of jurisdiction.”). Application of the relation-\nback doctrine does not “turn[] on whether the named plaintiffs’ individual claims \nbecome  moot  before  or  after  the  plaintiffs  move  to  certify  a  class.”  Stein  v. \nBuccaneers Ltd. P’ship, 772 F.3d 698, 707 (11th Cir. 2014). Instead, a named plaintiff \nsimply must act diligently in pursuing class certification after filing a complaint. \nId. Here, Plaintiffs did not fail to act diligently, filing their motion to certify class \none day after they filed their complaint. (See Doc. 1; Doc. 7.) Thus, even though \nMitchell’s individual claims are moot, Mitchell may still proceed as a proposed \nclass representative. See, e.g., U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404 \n(1980) (“The proposed representative retains a ‘personal stake’ in obtaining class \ncertification  sufficient  to  assure  that  Art.  III  values  are  not  undermined.”); \nMcLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 51 (“[T]he termination of a class representative’s claim \ndoes  not  moot  the  claims  of  the  unnamed  members  of  the  class.”  (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 11 of 40\n \nsuit in federal court. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88, 93 (2006); see also Bryant v. \nRich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1378–79 (11th Cir. 2008) (affirming dismissal of prisoner’s \nclaims for failure to exhaust where prisoner did not timely appeal grievance or \nseek waiver of appeal deadline). The purpose of this requirement is “to afford \ncorrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before \nallowing the initiation of a federal case.” Woodford, 548 U.S. at 93 (brackets and \ninternal quotation marks omitted). As such, a prisoner must “provide as much \nrelevant information as he reasonably can in the administrative grievance process.” \nBrown v. Sikes, 212 F.3d 1205, 1207 (11th Cir. 2000). \nThe PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is mandatory, and courts do not have \nthe discretion to waive it. Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 1856 (2016). “[T]he modifier \n‘available’ in the PLRA means that inmates must exhaust administrative remedies \nso long as there is the possibility of at least some kind of relief.” Johnson v. Meadows, \n418 F.3d 1152, 1156 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although \nthe exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, it is a “matter in abatement” and \nthus  “should  be  raised  in  a  motion  to  dismiss.”  Bryant,  530  F.3d  at  1374-75 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nA court should apply a two-step process in deciding lack of exhaustion: first, \na court should “look[] to the factual allegations in the defendant’s motion to \ndismiss  and  those  in  the  plaintiff’s  response,  and  if  they  conflict,  take[]  the \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 12 of 40\n \nplaintiff’s version of the facts as true.” Turner v. Burnside, 541 F.3d 1077, 1082 (11th \nCir. 2008). “If the defendants can establish failure to exhaust based on the plaintiff’s \nallegations, dismissal of the complaint is appropriate.” Whatley v. Smith, 898 F.3d \n1072, 1082 (11th Cir. 2018). Otherwise, the court should proceed to make “specific \nfindings in order to resolve the disputed factual issues related to exhaustion.” \nTurner, 541 F.3d at 1082. After making those findings, the court then should decide \n“whether  under  those  findings  the  prisoner  has  exhausted  his  available \nadministrative remedies.” Id. at 1083. \nA  court  may  properly  “consider  facts  outside  of  the  pleadings”  and \n“resolve factual disputes so long as the factual disputes do not decide the merits \nand the parties have sufficient opportunity to develop a record.” Bryant, 530 F.3d \nat 1376 (footnote omitted). “Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is an \naffirmative defense. The burden therefore is on the defendant to show that the \nplaintiff has not exhausted properly his administrative remedies.” Whatley, 898 \nF.3d at 1082. \nAccording  to  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  exhaust  their \nadministrative remedies. In particular, Defendants point to a declaration from \nTerrance Gibson, Lieutenant over Support Operations at the Clayton County \nSheriff’s Office, who states, “Inmates are informed about the Grievance Procedure \nduring inmate orientation.” (Doc. 23-2 at 3.) Defendants also include a copy of the \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 13 of 40\n \nClayton County Sheriff’s Office Standard Operating Procedures (“Paper-Based \nGrievance Procedure”) detailing the grievance process. (Id. at 4-6.) According to \nthe Paper-Based Grievance Procedure, “Inmates shall be provided a Grievance \nForm upon request. No inmate shall be denied a Grievance Form.” (Id. at 4.). The \nPaper-Based  Grievance  Procedure  also  states  that  inmates  shall  place  the \ncompleted grievance form in a grievance box mounted in the inmate’s housing \nunit,  and  an  official  will  collect  the  forms.  (Id.)  The  Paper-Based  Grievance \nProcedure provides that a response will be given within ten calendar days, with \na final decision within 30 days of the inmate’s grievance. (Id. at 5.) An inmate must \nappeal within two days, and a CCJ official must respond to the appeal within ten \ndays. (Id.) \nWith respect to Plaintiffs, Defendants argue that each Plaintiff was aware \nof  the  grievance  procedure  at  the  CCJ  and  failed  to  exhaust  his  or  her \nadministrative remedies. For example, Defendants contend that, according to the \nCCJ’s records, Plaintiff Jones never submitted a grievance regarding COVID-19 \nbefore filing suit. (Doc. 23-1 at 12.) Instead, Jones complained about the CCJ’s \ninadequate response to COVID-19 in an appeal to a previous grievance regarding \nthe refund of money. (Id. at 12-13; Doc. 23-2 at 8.) Because Jones never submitted \na standalone grievance regarding COVID-19 or sought to appeal the response in \nwhich  she  complained  about  COVID-19,  Defendants  argue,  Jones  failed  to \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 14 of 40\n \nexhaust her administrative remedies. (Doc. 23-1 at 13.) With respect to Plaintiff \nMitchell, Defendants note that Mitchell’s request for a COVID-19 test and mask \nwas marked as resolved with a note of “scheduled for sick call. Refer to security \nfor mask.” (Doc. 23-1 at 14; Doc. 23-2 at 13.) Because Mitchell never appealed this \ngrievance, Defendants argue that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. \n(Doc.  23-1  at  14.)  As  for  Plaintiff  Singleton,  Defendants  note  that  Singleton \nsubmitted a grievance on May 15, 2020, for masks and cleaning supplies, and an \nofficial subsequently explained, “All issues have been addressed.” (Doc. 23-1 at \n14-15; Doc. 23-2 at 18.)4 Singleton never appealed this grievance, and Defendants \ncontend that he thus failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Doc. 23-1 at \n15.) Finally, with regard to Plaintiff Watkins, Defendants explain that CCJ records \ndo not show Watkins as having ever submitted any grievance related to COVID-\n19. (Id. at 12.) As a result, they argue, Watkins failed to exhaust his administrative \nremedies. (Id.) \nIn contrast, Plaintiffs paint a very different picture. According to Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint: \nA purported grievance procedure is available on the kiosk only, not \nthrough paper forms. Grievances are rarely answered, and detainees \ncannot have more than two grievances pending at a time. People who \n \n4 Confusingly, the status of this grievance, as of July 9, 2020, is noted as “In \nProgress.” (See Doc. 23-2 at 18.) Notably, this grievance was apparently resolved \nafter Plaintiffs’ complaint was filed on July 1, 2020. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 15 of 40\n \nhave  two  grievances  pending  cannot  file  grievances  about  new \nproblems.  Many detainees have had  two grievances pending for \nmonths without a response. There is no way to withdraw a pending \ngrievance via the kiosk, and detainees are given no guidance about \nhow  to  appeal  a  grievance  decision.  No  information  about  the \ngrievance procedure is given to detainees when they enter the jail; \ndetainees do not receive inmate handbooks explaining the grievance \nprocedure and other jail rules. \n(Doc. 1 at 24-25.) More specifically, each of the named Plaintiffs have submitted \ndeclarations regarding their inability to pursue their administrative remedies. For \nexample, Jones stated that she tried to submit a grievance regarding the Jail’s \nfailure to adequately protect her from COVID-19, but was unable to do so because \nshe was at her grievance limit. (Doc. 6-1 at 7-8.) Furthermore, she stated that, \nalthough she knew she could submit a grievance at the kiosk, “[t]he grievance \nprocedure was not explained to me at orientation. No one gave me an inmate \nhandbook or other document explaining the grievance procedure.” (Id. at 7.) She \nalso stated  that a prison official  told her that she could not submit a paper \ngrievance because “[t]he jail does not accept paper grievances from inmates. \nGrievances must be submitted in the kiosk, the officer told me.” (Id. at 8.) \nOther Plaintiffs report similar difficulties in pursuing their administrative \nremedies. Mitchell stated: \nNo one on the jail staff has ever given me any information that I can \nrecall about how to file a grievance. I never received a copy of the \njail’s inmate handbook. I do not know for sure the correct way to use \nthe grievance system. In the past, when I need to file a grievance, I \nasked another detainee for help with the kiosk machine in my dorm. \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 16 of 40\n \nI don’t think I have ever received a response to any grievance that \nwas put into the kiosk on my behalf. \nI recently asked another detainee for help in submitting a grievance \nabout how the jail is not doing what it should to stop the outbreak of \ncoronavirus. The kiosk screen showed that I had “used up” all my \ngrievances and could not file any more. \n(Id. at 15.)5 \nSingleton stated: \nI filed a  grievance  on or around  May  15 about the jail’s lack of \ndisinfectant and cleaning supplies, as well as their failure to provide \ndetainees  with  masks,  and  I  referenced  the  virus.  I  also  filed  a \ngrievance on or around May 8 about a different subject. I have not \nreceived  a  response  to  either  grievance.  At  the  end  of  May,  I \nsubmitted an appeal on the kiosk, asking why the two grievances \nfrom May 8 and May 15 were not answered. I did not get a response \nto my appeal, but I saw on the kiosk that this appeal had been closed \nout on June 4. I don’t know what that means. Sometimes, officers \nblock  detainees  from  using  the  kiosk,  which  means  they  cannot \nsubmit medical requests. \n(Id. at 20-21.) \nWatkins stated: \nI submitted a grievance around May asking the jail for information \nabout Covid-19 and how I can protect myself. I haven’t received a \nresponse [as of June 21, 2020]. That does not surprise me. When I \nhave filed other grievances in the past, they were left pending for \nmonths without a response. I do not know of any way to withdraw \none of my grievances so I can file another. \n \n5 Although Mitchell’s individual claims are moot, his experiences with the \nCCJ’s  grievance  procedure  are  relevant  in  showing  whether  the  grievance \nprocedure is generally available to Plaintiffs. \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 17 of 40\n \n(Id. at 31-32.) \nIn their reply brief, Defendants maintain that the grievance procedure was \navailable  to  Plaintiffs  and  that  each  Plaintiff  failed  to  exhaust  his  or  her \nadministrative  remedies.  (Doc.  40  at  6-11.)  In  particular,  with  respect  to  the \navailability of the grievance process, Defendants point to a second declaration \nfrom Lieutenant Gibson, as well as a declaration from Demarco May, an inmate \nat CCJ, supporting their argument that the grievance procedure was available to \nPlaintiffs. (Id. at 6; Doc. 41-1 at 7-8; Doc. 41-2 at 3-5.) \nHowever, Defendants present this new evidence in their reply brief, not in \ntheir original motion to dismiss. “When faced with a reply brief that offers new \nevidence, . . . the district court has two permissible courses of action. It can either \n(1) permit the nonmoving party to file a surreply or (2) refrain from relying on \nany new material contained in the reply brief.” Atl. Specialty Ins. Co. v. Digit Dirt \nWorx, Inc., 793 F. App’x 896, 901-02 (11th Cir. 2019). Although the Court has the \ndiscretion  to  permit  Plaintiffs  to  file  a  surreply  addressing  Defendants’  new \nevidence, it is more appropriate here to exclude Defendants’ new evidence for \nseveral reasons. First, Defendants attach these declarations only to their response \nin opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, not to their reply \nbrief in support of their motion to dismiss. A review of these declarations show \nthat they are tailored to the issues raised by Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 18 of 40\n \ninjunction, not to the specific question of whether, before and at the time the \ncomplaint was filed, the grievance process available to Plaintiffs. Relatedly, the \nobservations of an inmate at the CCJ who appears to have no connection to \nPlaintiffs regarding his own personal experiences about the grievance procedure \nhas little, if any, relevance to whether the grievance procedure was available to \nPlaintiffs. Furthermore, Lieutenant Gibson’s second declaration contradicts the \nevidence  presented  by  Defendants  with  their  motion  to  dismiss:  Defendants \nattached to their motion to dismiss a copy of a grievance procedure based on \npaper forms, but Lieutenant Gibson’s second declaration implies that the CCJ’s \ngrievance procedure uses electronic forms. (See Doc. 23-2 at 4-6; Doc. 41-1 at 7-8.) \nFinally,  Lieutenant  Gibson’s  first  declaration—which  was  included  with \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss—is striking in the lack of detail compared to his \nsecond  declaration,  yet  Defendants  provide  no  explanation  why  Lieutenant \nGibson could not have provided his statements earlier. (Compare Doc. 23-2 at 3, \nwith Doc. 41-1 at 7-8.) As a result, the Court will not consider Defendants’ newly \nproffered evidence. \nBased on the evidence presented in Defendants’ motion to dismiss and \nPlaintiffs’ response in opposition and declarations accompanying the complaint, \nDefendants have failed to show that Plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed for \nfailure to exhaust. As noted previously, Defendants presented evidence of a \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 19 of 40\n \npaper-based grievance procedure. (Doc. 23-2 at 4-6.) Yet Plaintiffs uniformly state \nthat the CCJ uses electronic grievance forms that are filed through kiosks located \nin various parts of the CCJ, and Defendants’ own exhibits of copies of Plaintiffs’ \ngrievances show that the CCJ uses electronic grievances. See Gardner v. County of \nBaldwin,  No.  12-0281-CG-C,  2014  WL  171839,  at  *17  (S.D.  Ala. Jan.  15,  2014) \n(holding that defendants failed to show that plaintiff failed to exhaust where \n“[t]he grievance procedure that was in effect at the time of the complained of \nincidents [was] not before the Court”); (Doc. 1 at 24-25; Doc. 6-1; Doc. 23-2 at 7-\n28.) Defendants assert that “[w]hile the written Grievance Procedure technically \ndoes not refer to the Kiosk, this is immaterial because the process is the same.” \n(Doc. 40 at 7.) Defendants, however, provide no evidence in support of this \nassertion. Indeed, while the Paper-Based Grievance Procedure states that “[n]o \ninmate shall be denied a Grievance Form,” (Doc. 23-2 at 4), Plaintiffs state that \nthere is a two-grievance limit and that there is no way to withdraw an outstanding \ngrievance, (Doc. 1 at 24; Doc. 6-1 at 7-8, 15; see also Doc. 6-1 at 21 (“Sometimes, \nofficers block detainees from using the kiosk, which means they cannot submit \nmedical  requests.”).) 6  Other  than  arguing  that  the  Paper-Based  Grievance \n \n6 Notably, Lieutenant Gibson’s second declaration, which the Court will not \notherwise consider, also states that inmates are limited to only two outstanding \ngrievances at a time. (Doc. 41-1 at 7.) \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 20 of 40\n \nProcedure—which,  according  to  the  document,  has  not  been  updated  since \nSeptember  2011—is  the  procedure  in  effect  at  the  CCJ,  Defendants  do  not \notherwise dispute Plaintiff’s evidence that grievances are limited. In any event, \neven  if  the  Paper-Based  Grievance  Procedure  accurately  describes  the  CCJ’s \ncurrent grievance procedure, Defendants have not shown that Plaintiffs were \nproperly informed of the CCJ’s grievance procedure. Lieutenant Gibson’s first \ndeclaration  states,  with  no  elaboration:  “Inmates  are  informed  about  the \nGrievance Procedure during inmate orientation.” (Doc. 23-2 at 3.) Such a wholly \nconclusory  statement  is  simply  insufficient  to  establish  that  Plaintiffs  were \ninformed about the CCJ’s grievance procedure. See Rogers v. Evans, 792 F.2d 1052, \n1062 n.9 (11th Cir. 1986) (“The affidavit is phrased in conclusory terms without \nciting facts. . . . The affidavit is defective to create a factual dispute.”).7 \nMoreover,  not  only  have  Defendants  failed  to  show  what  the  current \ngrievance procedure at the CCJ actually is, but the presence of a two-grievance \nlimit,  with  no  ability  to  withdraw  an  outstanding  grievance,  coupled  with \nevidence that grievances are routinely unanswered or untimely answered, (Doc. \n \n7 Curiously,  Defendants  undermine  their  own  argument  on  this  point: \n“While  the  factual  statement  is  brief,  it  is  not  a  conclusory  statement,  as  a \nconclusory statement would be simply stating inmates know of the Grievance Procedure.” \n(Doc. 40 at 6 n.2 (emphasis added).) That is exactly what Lieutenant Gibson’s \nstatement says. \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 21 of 40\n \n6-1 at 20-21; id. at 31 (“When I have filed other grievances in the past, they were \nleft pending for months without a response.”)), strongly weighs against requiring \nfull  exhaustion  from  Plaintiffs.  Even  assuming  that  the  current  grievance \nprocedure, whatever it may be, follows the same deadlines listed in the Paper-\nBased Grievance Procedure, Defendants’ own evidence shows that prison officials \nat the CCJ frequently fail to timely respond to Plaintiffs’ grievances. For example, \nPlaintiff  Singleton  filed  his  grievance  requesting  supplies  to  protect  against \nCOVID-19  on  May  15,  2020.  (Doc.  23-2  at  18.)  The  Paper-Based  Grievance \nProcedure states that prison officials must respond within ten days and provide \na final decision within 30 days of the date the grievance was filed. (Id. at 5.) Yet \nSingleton’s grievance did not receive any response until July 9, 2020, several \nweeks after the paper-based Grievance Procedure’s 30-day deadline. (Id. at 18.) \nTwo  of  Plaintiff  Watkin’s  grievances,  and  at  least  two  of  Plaintiff  Jones’s \ngrievances, unrelated to COVID-19, were also untimely answered. (See id. at 10-\n11, 19, 25.)8 \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  given  examples  of  when  an  administrative \nprocedure is unavailable, including when it operates as a simple dead end, when \nit is so opaque that no ordinary prisoner could discern or navigate it, and when \n \n8 Notably, Jones’s grievances received responses shortly after Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint was filed—over a month after responses were due. \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 22 of 40\n \nprison officials thwart inmates from taking advantage of the process through \nmachination, misrepresentation, or intimidation. See Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859–60.  A \ntwo-grievance  limit,  standing  alone,  does  not  render  a  grievance  procedure \nunavailable. Pearson v. Taylor, 665 F. App’x 858, 868 (11th Cir. 2016) (“[W]hile \nPearson was limited to two active grievances at any one time, the defendants’ \nevidence reflected that [the prison’s] policy allowed him to withdraw a pending \ngrievance and file a new one. Thus, Pearson had an available route to exhaust his \nclaims regarding the denial of medical treatment according to the applicable \nprocedural rules, even if it would have required him to prioritize his grievances.”). \nBut here, the totality of the circumstances regarding the two-grievance limit, the \ninability  to  withdraw  grievances,  and  CCJ  officials’  frequent  tardiness  in \nresponding to grievances is sufficient to show that the grievance procedure was \nunavailable for purposes of exhausting administrative remedies. See Jackson v. \nGriffin, 762 F. App’x 744, 746 (11th Cir. 2019) (holding that prison officials’ failure \nto comply with grievance procedural rules meant that grievance process was \nunavailable to prisoner); Kaba v. Stepp, 458 F.3d 678, 684 (7th Cir. 2006) (“Prison \nofficials may not take unfair advantage of the exhaustion requirement, and a \nremedy becomes ‘unavailable’ if prison employees do not respond to a properly \nfiled grievance or otherwise use affirmative misconduct to prevent a prisoner \nfrom exhausting.” (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)); Gibson v. \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 23 of 40\n \nWeber, 431 F.3d 339, 341 (8th Cir. 2005) (explaining that prison officials’ failure to \ncomply with grievance procedure may excuse inmate’s noncompliance). \nD.  Eleventh Amendment Immunity \nIt is “well-settled that Eleventh Amendment immunity bars suits brought \nin federal court when the State itself is sued and when an arm of the State is sued.” \nManders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). A Georgia county sheriff acts as an arm of the State of Georgia \n“when  promulgating  policies  and  procedures  governing  conditions  of \nconfinement” for a county jail. Purcell ex rel. Estate of Morgan v. Toombs Cnty., 400 \nF.3d 1313, 1325 (11th Cir. 2005). As a result, the county sheriff is entitled to \nEleventh Amendment immunity from suit in his official capacity. Id. However, \nsome9 suits “requesting injunctive or declaratory relief against state officials are \nnot  considered  suits  against  the  state  and  thus  are  not  barred  by  sovereign \nimmunity.” S&M Brands, Inc. v. Georgia ex rel. Carr, 925 F.3d 1198, 1204 (11th Cir. \n2019) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 159-60 (1908) (injunctive relief) and \nVerizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 646 (2002) (declaratory \nrelief)). \n \n9 The Supreme Court has recognized an exception to Ex Parte Young “that \nprohibits a plaintiff from seeking injunctive relief when he alleges merely that a \nstate official has violated state law.” Nat’l Ass’n of the Deaf v. Florida, 945 F.3d 1339, \n1351 (11th Cir. 2020)  (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis in original). \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 24 of 40\n \nDefendants  argue  that,  although  “Plaintiffs’  claims  for  prospective \ninjunctive relief against the Sheriff in his official capacity are not barred by the \nEleventh Amendment under the Ex parte Young exception, all other claims are \nbarred.” (Doc. 23-1 at 6.) As Plaintiffs point out, however, Plaintiffs “are not \nseeking any relief other than prospective relief against the Defendants, the very \nrelief permissible.” (Doc. 37 at 25; see Doc. 1 at 109.) To the extent Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs cannot seek declaratory relief specifically, “[i]nsofar as the \nexposure of the State is concerned, the prayer for declaratory relief adds nothing \nto the prayer for injunction.” Verizon Md., 535 U.S. at 646. As a result, Defendants \nare not entitled to dismissal based on Eleventh Amendment immunity. \nE.  Duplicative Parties \nDefendants  argue  that  the  claims  against  Defendants  Boehrer,  Gibson, \nThomas, and Johnson are duplicative of those against Hill, and that all Defendants \nexcept  Hill  should  be  dismissed.  (Doc.  23-1  at  7.)  As  noted  earlier,  suits \n“requesting  injunctive  or  declaratory  relief  against  state  officials  are  not \nconsidered suits against the state.” S&M Brands, 925 F.3d at 1204; see also Nat’l \nAss’n of the Deaf, 945 F.3d at 1345, 1351–52 (noting that lawsuit was brought \nagainst numerous Florida state officials); Fair Fight Action, Inc. v. Raffensperger, 413 \nF. Supp. 3d 1251, 1288 (N.D. Ga. 2019) (explaining that each defendant, as a \nGeorgia state election official, had some connection with alleged misconduct). \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 25 of 40\n \n“Personal  action  by  defendants  individually  is  not  a  necessary  condition  of \ninjunctive relief against state officers in their official capacity. All that is required \nis that the official be responsible for the challenged action.” Luckey v. Harris, 860 \nF.2d 1012, 1015 (11th Cir. 1988); see Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 157 (explaining that \na state official may be sued so long as the official has “some connection” with \nalleged violation); see also Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991) (clarifying that, to \nestablish liability in suits against state officials in their official capacity, “[b]ecause \nthe real party in interest in an official-capacity suit is the governmental entity and \nnot the named official, the entity’s policy or custom must have played a part in \nthe violation of federal law” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In contrast, \n“[t]here  is  no  longer  a  need  to  bring  official-capacity  actions  against  local \ngovernment officials” because “local government units can be sued directly for \ndamages and injunctive or declaratory relief.” Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, \n167 n.14 (1985); see also id. (“Unless a State has waived its Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity or Congress has overridden it, however, a State cannot be sued directly \nin its own name regardless of the relief sought. Thus, implementation of state \npolicy or custom may be reached in federal court only because official-capacity \nactions for prospective relief are not treated as actions against the State.” (citation \nomitted)). \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 26 of 40\n \nHere, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Hill, as Sheriff, is responsible for \nmanaging  the  CCJ  and  has  delegated  aspects  of  his  authority  to  the  other \nDefendants. (Doc. 1 at 14-16.) Because these Defendants have some connection \nwith the alleged misconduct, Plaintiffs’ claims may proceed against each of the \nnamed Defendants. See Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1015; Fair Fight Action, 413 F. Supp. 3d \nat 1288 (“[T]hese Defendants have some connection with the asserted misconduct \nat issue in this case. Said connection is sufficient for this case to proceed against \nthe named State Defendants. . . .”) \nF.  Claim 1 (Unconstitutional punishment in violation of the Due Process \nClause of the 14th Amendment) \n \nWhile  the  conditions  under  which  a  convicted  inmate  are  held  are \nscrutinized under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual \npunishment, the conditions under which a pretrial detainee are held are reviewed \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Melton v. Abston, \n841 F.3d 1207, 1220 (11th Cir. 2016). Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins, as pretrial \ndetainees, allege that they are being unconstitutionally punished by being held at \nthe CCJ and suffering from a risk of contracting COVID-19. (Doc. 1 at 100-01.) \nAccording to Jones and Watkins, “No legitimate government purpose is served \nby unnecessarily subjecting pretrial detainees to an excessive risk of exposure to \nand contracting COVID-19.” (Id. at 100.) Furthermore, they claim, “Detention \ninherently  increases  the  chance  of  exposure  to  COVID-19.”  (Doc.  37  at  39.) \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 27 of 40\n \nDefendants argue that this claim should be dismissed because it is “an improper \ncarve out of a conditions of confinement claim, which Plaintiffs already assert in \nCount II.” (Doc. 23-1 at 27); see County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 843 \n(1998) (“[I]f a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision, \nsuch as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the claim must be analyzed under the \nstandard  appropriate  to  that  specific  provision,  not  under  the  rubric  of \nsubstantive due process.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Henry v. Hulett, 969 \nF.3d  769,  780–81  (7th  Cir.  2020)  (en  banc)  (“[T]he  Supreme  Court  has  held \nunenumerated rights—such as those arising from the due process clause—do not \nafford  a  prisoner  greater  protection  than  the  Eighth  Amendment.  . . .  [T]his \nconclusion is specific to the Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence . . . .” \n(emphasis, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)). Defendants maintain \nthat  Plaintiffs  are  attempting  to  impose  a  rational  basis  test  under  the  14th \nAmendment, when in fact they have to show that the deprivation suffered was \nobjectively serious and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to the \nviolation of the constitutional rights. (Doc. 23-1 at 26–27.) In response, Plaintiffs \npoint to Jacoby v. Baldwin County, 835 F.3d 1338, 1344-46 (11th Cir. 2016), in which \nthe Eleventh Circuit evaluated a pretrial detainee’s claims under the substantive \ndue process test established by Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 538-39 (1979), and they \nargue that the Court must determine whether the continued detention of the \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 28 of 40\n \npretrial detainees is reasonably related to a legitimate, non-punitive government \npurpose or is excessive in relation to that purpose. (Doc. 37 at 38.) \nDefendants make a strong argument, and Jacoby appears to be at some \ntension  with  Lewis  and  with  numerous  Eleventh  Circuit  cases  that  consider \npretrial detainees’ claims under the deliberate indifference standard. See, e.g., \nSwain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1088 (11th Cir. 2020) (observing that “a pre-trial \ndetainee’s rights exist under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nbut are subject to the same scrutiny as if they had been brought as deliberate \nindifference claims under the Eighth Amendment” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)); Dang ex rel. Dang v. Sheriff, 871 F.3d 1272, 1279 (11th Cir. 2017) (“As a \npretrial detainee, Dang alleges inadequate medical care under the Fourteenth \nAmendment rather than the Eighth Amendment. Nevertheless, Dang’s claims are \nevaluated under the same standard as a prisoner’s claim of inadequate care under \nthe Eighth Amendment.” (citations omitted)); Melton, 841 F.3d at 1220 (“As a \npretrial detainee at Pickens County Jail, Melton’s rights arose under the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than the Eighth Amendment. \nNonetheless, Melton’s claims are subject to the same scrutiny as if they had been \nbrought as deliberate indifference claims under the Eighth Amendment.” (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted)); Goodman v. Kimbrough, 718 F.3d 1325, \n1331 n.1 (11th Cir. 2013) (“Where, as here, the plaintiff is a pretrial detainee such \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 29 of 40\n \nas Goodman, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, not the \nEighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, governs \nour analysis. Regardless of the particular taxonomy under which we analyze the \ncase, however, the result is the same, because the standards under the Fourteenth \nAmendment  are  identical  to  those  under  the  Eighth.”  (citation  and  internal \nquotation marks omitted)); cf. Jacoby, 835 F.3d at 1345 n.3 (noting that “we need \nnot decide Mr. Jacoby’s claim that the Eighth Amendment’s subjective deliberate \nindifference  standard  conflicts  with  Bell’s  objective  ‘punishment’  standard” \nbecause appellant could not prevail under either standard). However, much of \nthe tension can be resolved by observing that a claim that a “condition of pretrial \ndetention amounts to punishment,” Magluta v. Samples, 375 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th \nCir. 2004), is not identical to a claim that deliberate indifference to a serious \nmedical  need  amounts  to  punishment.  A  discussion  of  the  Bell  standard  is \ninstructive, which the Circuit discussed at length in Jacoby. \nA pretrial detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt, \nbut “the government ‘may detain him to ensure his presence at trial and may \nsubject him to the restrictions and conditions of the detention facility so long as \nthose conditions and restrictions do not amount to punishment, or otherwise \nviolate the Constitution.’” Jacoby, 835 F.3d at 1344-45 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 536-\n37). “Whether a condition of pretrial detention amounts to punishment turns on \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 30 of 40\n \nwhether the condition is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is \nincident  to  some  legitimate  government  purpose.”  Id.  (brackets  and  internal \nquotation marks omitted); see Bell, 441 U.S. at 561 (“[T]he determination whether \nthese restrictions and practices constitute punishment in the constitutional sense \ndepends  on  whether  they  are  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  nonpunitive \ngovernmental purpose and whether they appear excessive in relation to that \npurpose.”). A court must consider whether (1) any “legitimate goal” is served by \nthe prison conditions and (2) whether those conditions are “reasonably related” \nto that goal. Jacoby, 835 F.3d at 1345 (internal quotation marks omitted).10 \nIn delineating the “condition” that leads to unconstitutional “punishment,” \na careful reading of Bell, Jacoby, and Magluta shows that the focus is on intentional \nconduct by a defendant designed to punish a plaintiff, as opposed to a reckless \nact or  omission with regard to a medical need: Bell concerned the policy of \n“double bunking” in cells designed for only one person, and Jacoby and Magluta \nconcerned administrative segregation as a disciplinary measure. For example, the \nplaintiff in Jacoby alleged that he was forced into administrative segregation after \ntesting positive for cocaine, and “he had to sleep on the floor next to a toilet while \n \n10 To the extent Defendants could be read only as challenging Plaintiffs’ \nclaim as not cognizable, the Court is independently required under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915A to fully evaluate the merits of Plaintiffs’ claim. \n30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 31 of 40\n \nin administrative segregation because he was the third inmate in an 8-by-10-foot \ncell meant for two.” Jacoby, 835 F.3d at 1343. He further alleged that “his cellmates \nurinated and defecated over him as he tried to sleep, and that other inmates in the \nsegregation unit threw feces and urine at him,” causing him to develop “a foot \nrash due to these unsanitary conditions and the lack of hygiene products available \nto him.” Id. (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The Eleventh Circuit, \nhowever, ruled that, “[t]aken in the light most favorable to him, Mr. Jacoby’s \nallegations establish that he was temporarily forced to sleep on a mattress on the \nfloor near the toilet” and that this was insufficient to show that this condition \namounted to punishment. Id. at 1346. In other words, the court focused on the \nintentional  placement  of  the  plaintiff  as  a  third  person  in  administrative \nsegregation in a cell meant for two rather than on the consequences by third \nparties following that decision. \nHere, not only do Jones and Watkins simply allege that Defendants’ failed \nto address COVID-19, as opposed to affirmative conduct, but they also have not \nalleged that Defendants intentionally exposed them to a greater risk of contracting \nCOVID-19. Ultimately, Plaintiffs are attempting to shoehorn a run-of-the-mill \ndeliberate indifference claim into a substantive due process claim without any \nallegation that Defendants are intentionally punishing Plaintiffs. The fact that \nCOVID-19 may be spreading at the CCJ is not the result of a policy by Defendants \n31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 32 of 40\n \nto  spread  COVID-19.  At  most,  Jones  and  Watkins  have  only  alleged  that \nDefendants are intentionally detaining them and that “[d]etention inherently \nincreases the chance of exposure to COVID-19.” (Doc. 37 at 39; Doc. 1 at 38.) But \nsee Cureno Hernandez v. Mora, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, No. 1:20-CV-00104-H, 2020 \nWL  3246753,  at  *8  (N.D.  Tex.  June  15,  2020)  (“The  incidence  of  diseases  or \ninfections, standing alone, cannot imply unconstitutional confinement conditions, \nsince any densely populated residence may be subject to outbreaks.” (brackets \nand internal quotation marks omitted)). As the Third Circuit recently ruled in a \nCOVID-19 case involving immigration detainees, however: \nThe  District  Court  could  see  no  rational  relationship  between  a \nlegitimate government objective and keeping Petitioners detained in \nunsanitary, tightly-packed environments—because doing so would \nconstitute a punishment to Petitioners. But Petitioners’ confinement \nimplicates multiple legitimate governmental objectives, including: \n(1)  ensuring  Petitioners’  appearances  at  . . .  proceedings;  (2) \nprotecting the public; and (3) managing the detention facilities. \nHope v. Warden York Cnty. Prison, ___, F.3d ___, ___, No. 20-1784, 2020 WL 5001785, \nat *9 (3d Cir. Aug. 25, 2020) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see \nalso  id.  at  *15  n.7  (noting  that  “[s]ome  detainees  released  on  their  own \nrecognizance in [the case below] absconded”); cf. Hoffer v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Corr., \n___ F.3d, ___, ___, No. 19-11921, 2020 WL 5105013, at *10 (11th Cir. Aug. 31, 2020) \n(explaining  that  cost  considerations  may  permissibly  factor  into  officials’ \ndecisions to provide care to inmates). Given Jones and Watkins’s failure to allege \n32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 33 of 40\n \nany  intentional  conduct  besides  detention  by  Defendants  that  amounts  to \npunishment, and given the strong legitimate interests by the State in detaining \nJones and Watkins, Defendants are entitled to dismissal of this claim.11 \nG.  Claims 3 and 4 (Violations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act) \nUnder  Title  II  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  “no \nqualified  individual  with  a  disability  shall,  by  reason  of  such  disability,  be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” \n42  U.S.C. § 12132.  Under  section  504  of the  Rehabilitation  Act (“RA”),  “[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be \n \n11 Defendants do not explicitly move to dismiss Count II, but as noted \nearlier, the Court is independently required under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A to fully \nevaluate the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims. This evaluation need not be lengthy, \nhowever, as Plaintiffs—who propose to represent all classes for this claim—have \nstated a claim of deliberate indifference. See Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1088-\n89 (11th Cir. 2020) (stating standard for deliberate indifference and noting that \nstandard is same whether based on Fourteenth Amendment for pretrial detainees \nor Eighth Amendment for convicted prisoners). COVID-19 is a serious disease. In \naddition, although Plaintiffs could have provided more detail to support their \nallegations,  Plaintiffs  have  shown  that  Defendants  are  aware  of  the  risk  of \nCOVID-19 generally and the risk that it poses to the CCJ. (Doc. 1 at 47-48.) \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that, despite this knowledge, \nDefendants’  failure  to  adequately  respond  to  COVID-19  amounts  to  reckless \nconduct. See Swain, 958 F.3d at 1089; Hoffer, 2020 WL 5105013, at *4 n.2; (Doc. 1 at \n52-75.) \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 34 of 40\n \ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Claims under \neither act are governed by the same standard, and courts “rely on cases construing \nTitle II and § 504 interchangeably.” Silberman v. Miami Dade Transit, 927 F.3d 1123, \n1133 (11th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nTo state a claim under either Title II or § 504, a plaintiff must establish \n(1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was \neither excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a \npublic entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise \ndiscriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that the exclusion, \ndenial of benefit, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff’s \ndisability. \nId. at 1134 (internal quotation marks omitted). “A physical impairment, standing \nalone, . . . is not necessarily a disability as contemplated by the ADA.” Gordon v. \nE.L. Hamm & Assocs., Inc., 100 F.3d 907, 911 (11th Cir. 1996). Instead, to qualify as \ndisabled, a plaintiff must show that “he has ‘(A) a physical or mental impairment \nthat substantially limits one or more of the major life activities; (B) a record of such \nan impairment; or (C) is regarded as having such an impairment.’” Greenberg v. \nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12102(2)) (brackets and ellipsis omitted); see Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int’l, LLC, \n746 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir. 2014). “Major life activities” include “functions such \nas caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, \nbreathing, learning, and working.” Greenberg, 498 F.3d at 1264 (internal quotation \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 35 of 40\n \nmarks omitted); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). When alleging a failure to provide \na reasonable accommodation, the “duty to provide a reasonable accommodation \nis not triggered unless a specific demand for an accommodation has been made.” \nD’Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir. 2020) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (considering a claim under Title I of the ADA). \nPlaintiffs, as proposed representatives of the disability subclasses, allege \nthat Defendants have denied them “important services, programs, and activities \nthat would mitigate the risk of COVID-19” solely because of their disabilities and \nthat Defendants have failed to provide reasonable accommodations. (Doc. 1 at \n105.) Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not shown that they are disabled as \ndefined by the ADA and RA. (Doc. 40 at 12.) Although Defendants’ argument \nmay have some merit, any pleading deficiency on this point likely could be cured \nwith more detailed allegations. \nHowever, even assuming that Plaintiffs are disabled, Plaintiffs have not \nsufficiently  alleged  that  they  were  discriminated  against  because  of  their \ndisabilities.  A  reading  of  Plaintiffs’  complaint  shows  that  Defendants  have \nallegedly failed to adequately respond to COVID-19 with respect to all inmates, \nnot simply those with disabilities, and thus Defendants did not discriminate \nagainst Plaintiffs by reason of their disabilities. See Silberman, 927 F.3d at 1133; see \nalso Money v. Pritzker, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, No. 20-CV-2093, 2020 WL 1820660, \n35 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 36 of 40\n \nat *18-19 & n.14 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020) (ruling that inmates failed to show they \nwere likely to succeed on ADA claim where prison officials’ COVID-19 release \npolicies  treated  all  inmates  equally  and  may  even  have  disproportionally \nbenefited disabled inmates); Frazier v. Kelley, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, No. 4:20-\nCV-00434-KGB, 2020 WL 2561956, at *35 (E.D. Ark. May 19, 2020) (ruling that \ninmates failed to show they were likely to succeed on ADA claim because there \nwas no evidence that prison officials’ failure to combat COVID-19 and provide \naccommodations was because of inmates’ alleged disabilities). Moreover, to the \nextent  Plaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  reasonable \naccommodations,  Plaintiffs  have  not  alleged  that  they  ever  made  a  specific \ndemand for an accommodation.12 See D’Onofrio, 964 F.3d at 1022.13 Accordingly, \nDefendants are entitled to dismissal of these claims. \n \n12 That Plaintiffs have been excused from exhaustion under the PLRA does \nnot excuse their failure to request an accommodation under the ADA and RA. \n13 Furthermore, the only “reasonable accommodation” Plaintiffs allege in \ntheir complaint is release from custody. (Doc. 1 at 66 (“[N]o set of conditions can \nadequately  protect  members  of  this  class.  Public  health  experts  recommend \nrapidly releasing people most vulnerable to COVID-19 from custody. Release not \nonly protects the most vulnerable people from being infected with the virus, but \nalso eases crowding, thereby allowing for greater risk mitigation for people held \nor working in a  jail, and the broader community.”); see Doc. 37 at 36 (“The \ncomplaint  outlines  the  steps  necessary  to  protect  members  of  the  Disability \nSubclasses: release or transfer from the Clayton County Jail.”).) However, release \nfrom custody is not a “reasonable accommodation,” and the PLRA prohibits such \nrelease without a prior “order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the \n \n36 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 37 of 40\n \nH.  Claim 5 (Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus) \nFinally, Plaintiffs, as proposed representatives of the medically vulnerable \nand disability subclasses, seek a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 2241 directing their release or transfer from the CCJ. (Doc. 1 at 107-08.) \nHowever, this  Court  has  regularly  held that  litigants  like  Plaintiffs  may  not \nproceed under both habeas and § 1983 in the same action. See Boyd v. Warden, 856 \nF.3d 853, 865 (11th Cir. 2017) (explaining that “habeas and § 1983 are mutually \nexclusive avenues for relief” (internal quotation marks omitted)). “Simply put, if \nthe relief sought by the inmate would either invalidate his conviction or sentence \nor change the nature or duration of his sentence, the inmate’s claim must be raised \n \ndeprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner \nrelease order.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A)(i). In addition, only a three-judge court \ncan enter such a release order, and such order can only be entered “if the court \nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that . . . crowding is the primary cause of \nthe violation of a Federal right; and . . . no other relief will remedy the violation \nof the Federal right.” Id. § 3626(a)(3)(E). Insofar as Plaintiffs contend that the \nPLRA’s restrictions on release do not apply because “it is Defendants’ gross \nmismanagement of the outbreak, not overcrowding, that is the primary cause of \nthe  constitutional  violations  in  this  case,”  (Doc.  37  at  44),  “[t]he  appropriate \nEleventh Circuit relief from prison conditions that violate the Eighth Amendment \nduring  legal  incarceration  is  to  require  the  discontinuance  of  any  improper \npractices, or to require correction of any condition causing cruel and unusual \npunishment. . . . [R]elief of an Eighth Amendment violation does not include \nrelease from confinement.” Gomez v. United States, 899 F.2d 1124, 1126 (11th Cir. \n1990). \n37 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 38 of 40\n \nin  a  § 2254  habeas  petition,  not  a  § 1983  civil  rights  action.”14 Id.  (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, 738 \nF.3d 1253, 1288 (11th Cir. 2013) (explaining that “§ 2241 habeas petitions, which \nmust be filed in the incarceration district, are generally reserved for challenges to \nexecution of a sentence or the nature of confinement, not the validity of the \nsentence itself or the fact of confinement”), overruled on other grounds by McCarthan \nv. Dir. of Goodwill Indus.-Suncoast, Inc., 851 F.3d 1076 (11th Cir. 2017); Vaz v. Skinner, \n634 F. App’x 778, 781 (11th Cir. 2015) (ruling that a “§ 2241 petition is not the \nappropriate vehicle for raising an inadequate medical care claim, as such a claim \nchallenges  the  conditions  of  confinement,  not  the  fact  or  duration  of  that \nconfinement”). \nPlaintiffs attempt to dance around this problem by arguing that they are \nnot challenging the conditions of their confinement, but rather are challenging the \n“fact” of their confinement because confinement itself is unconstitutional in light \nof COVID-19. (Doc. 37 at 40.) This argument fails. The only reason Plaintiffs claim \nthe “fact” of their incarceration is unconstitutional is because of the conditions in \n \n14 Jones and Watkins, as pretrial detainees, cannot file 28 U.S.C. § 2254 \npetitions  because  they  have  not  been  sentenced  pursuant  to  a  conviction. \nHowever, even if they were to file a separate 28 U.S.C. § 2241 action, it is likely \nthat they would be unable to obtain any relief, both because this Court would \nlikely be required to abstain under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and \nbecause they have not shown that they have exhausted their state-court remedies. \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 52   Filed 09/16/20   Page 39 of 40\n \nthe jail related to COVID-19. Plaintiffs can try to twist the description of their \nclaim as they wish, but at the end of the day it is a conditions-of-confinement \nclaim that cannot exist under § 2241. See A.S.M. v. Warden, __F.Supp.3d__, __, No. \n7:20-CV-62 (CDL), 2020 WL 2988307, at *4 (M.D. Ga. June 3, 2020) (finding that the \ncourt lacked jurisdiction to consider petitioners’ habeas corpus remedy and that \npetitioners were not otherwise entitled to release from confinement and holding \nthat “[r]elease from detention is not available as a remedy for unconstitutional \nconditions  of  confinement  claims”).  Accordingly,  Defendants  are  entitled  to \ndismissal of this claim.15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 Because this claim  is one challenging conditions of confinement, the \nCourt declines to address Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs  have failed to \nexhaust their administrative remedies.

This Court finds as follows:   \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn July 1, 2020, Rhonda Jones, Randolph Mitchell, Michael Singleton and \nBarry Watkins (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)—who are all inmates at the Clayton \nCounty Jail—filed a Class Action Complaint and Petition for Writ of Habeas \nCorpus (“Complaint”) against Victor Hill, Roland Boehrer, Terrance Gibson, \nKevin Thomas and Maurice Johnson (collectively, “Defendants”).  [Doc. 1].  In the \nComplaint, Plaintiffs bring the following causes of action:  (1) unconstitutional \npunishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause; (2) \nunconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation of the Eight and Fourteenth \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 2 of 15\nAmendments; (3) violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”); (4) \nviolations of the Rehabilitation Act; and (5) Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.  \nId.  All of Plaintiffs’ causes of action relate to Plaintiffs’ contention that officials at \nthe Clayton County Jail have failed to take adequate measures to protect vulnerable \ninmates from contracting COVID-19.    \nDefendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint on August 3, 2020.  \n[Doc. 23].  On September 16, 2020, the Magistrate Judge issued his Non-Final \nReport and Recommendation wherein he recommended granting in part, and \ndenying in part, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.

More specifically, the \nMagistrate Judge recommended dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims except for the \ndeliberate indifference claim (Count 2). \nANALYSIS \nA district judge has broad discretion to accept, reject or modify a magistrate \njudge’s proposed findings and recommendations.  United States v. Raddatz, 447 \nU.S. 667, 680 (1980).  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), the Court reviews any \nportion of the Report and Recommendation that is the subject of a proper objection \non a de novo basis and any non-objected-to portion under a “clearly erroneous” \nstandard.  Notably, a party objecting to a recommendation “must specifically \nidentify those findings objected to.  Frivolous, conclusive, or general objections \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 3 of 15\nneed not be considered by the district court.”  Marsden v. Moore, 847 F.2d 1536, \n1548 (11th Cir. 1988).  It is reasonable to place this burden on the objecting party \nbecause “[t]his rule facilitates the opportunity for district judges to spend more \ntime on matters actually contested and produces a result compatible with the \npurposes of the Magistrates Act.”  United States v. Schultz, 565 F.3d 1353, 1361 \n(11th Cir. 2009).    \nNo party objected to the Magistrate Judge’s determinations that: (1) Plaintiff \nMitchell’s individual claims must be dismissed because he is no longer \nincarcerated at the jail; (2) Plaintiffs have standing to sue; (3) Plaintiffs’ claims are \nnot moot; (4) Plaintiffs’ claims should not be dismissed for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies; (5) Defendants are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity; and (6) the individually named defendants are not duplicative parties.  \nWith respect to these portions, this Court has reviewed the recommendation for \nclear error and finds none.   \nAs to some of the Magistrate Judge’s other determinations, Plaintiffs filed \ntimely objections on September 30, 2020.  [Doc. 60].  Each objection is discussed \nbelow. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 4 of 15\n1. Unconstitutional Punishment Claim\nIn Count 1 of Plaintiffs’ Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Jones and\nPlaintiff Watkins, who are pretrial detainees, are being unconstitutionally punished \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Magistrate Judge determined that \nPlaintiffs’ unconstitutional punishment claim failed under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6).  First, the Magistrate Judge noted that because Plaintiffs had \nraised a Fourteenth Amendment deliberate indifference claim, they could not also \nraise a substantive due process claim alleging the same facts.  See United States v. \nLanier, 520 U.S. 259, 272 n.7 (1997) (“[I]f a constitutional claim is covered by a \nspecific constitutional provision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the \nclaim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision, \nnot under the rubric of substantive due process.”).  The Magistrate Judge further \nnoted that substantial Eleventh Circuit case law stands for the proposition that \npretrial detainees’ rights under the Due Process Clause are analyzed under the \nsame standard as prisoners’ rights under the Eighth Amendment.  E.g., Swain v. \nJunior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1088 (11th Cir. 2020) (observing that “a pre-trial detainee’s \nrights exist under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment but are \nsubject to the same scrutiny as if they had been brought as deliberate indifference \nclaims under the Eighth Amendment”) (quotation and citation omitted).  In other \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 5 of 15\nwords, the great weight of case law in the Eleventh Circuit indicates that claims \nbrought by pretrial detainees regarding prison conditions are analyzed under \nEighth Amendment jurisprudence.  Eighth Amendment claims require a \ndemonstration of subjective intent on the part of the defendant, and as the \nMagistrate Judge found, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants sought to \npunish them by intentionally exposing them to COVID-19.  Accordingly, the \nMagistrate Judge concluded that Plaintiffs cannot bring a separate substantive due \nprocess claim that requires a lesser burden of proof than their deliberate \nindifference claim. \n  In their objections, Plaintiffs contend that the Magistrate Judge erred “by \nrequiring Plaintiffs to show that Defendants intended to expose pretrial detainees to \nCOVID-19.”  [Doc. 60, p. 3].  According to Plaintiffs, they have alleged that jail \nofficials’ exposure of pretrial detainees to a serious risk of contracting COVID-19 \nserves no legitimate goal, and they thus have stated a claim under Bell v. Wolfish.  \nUnder Bell,  \nif a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is \nreasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does \nnot, without more, amount to “punishment.”  Conversely, if a \nrestriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate \ngoal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless—a court permissibly may \ninfer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment \nthat may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua \ndetainees.  Courts must be mindful that these inquiries spring \n  5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 6 of 15\nfrom constitutional requirements and that judicial answers to \nthem must reflect that fact rather than a court's idea of how best \nto operate a detention facility. \n441 U.S. 520, 539 (1979).  However, the Magistrate Judge already addressed this \nargument by citing to several cases in which courts identified legitimate goals \nserved by keeping detainees incarcerated, even when the conditions of that \nincarceration were dangerous.  [Doc. 52, p. 32].  Notably, the Eleventh Circuit has \nrepeatedly held that cost considerations are legitimate goals, e.g., Hoffer v. Sec’y, \nFla. Dep’t of Corr., No. 19-11921, 2020 WL 5105013, at *10 (11th Cir. Aug. 31, \n2020); and wholesale adoption of, for example, the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention’s guidelines for jails and prisons during the pandemic would \ncertainly cost the county more money.  As noted by the Eleventh Circuit in another \ncase, \na state’s decision to maintain at a reasonable level the quality of \nfood, living space, and medical care rather than improve or \nincrease its provisions of those necessities serves a legitimate \npurpose: to reasonably limit the cost of detention.  It is equally \nclear that the due process clause does not purport to regulate the \ngeneral conditions and quality of life in the country’s jails, and \nthat the courts should not attempt to make “judgment calls” to \ndetermine which of various marginally different conditions \nmight be more appropriate. \nHamm v. DeKalb Cnty., 774 F.2d 1567, 1573 (11th Cir. 1985) (emphasis \nsupplied). \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 7 of 15\n  In this case, Defendants clearly have a legitimate reason for detaining \nPlaintiffs—to ensure their appearance in court and to protect the public—and this \nCourt thus disagrees with the notion, voiced by Plaintiffs, that requiring medically \nvulnerable individuals to remain in detention where they are at risk of contracting \nCOVID-19 is not rationally related to a legitimate government objective.  That \nDefendants have purportedly failed to take appropriate steps to ameliorate the risk \nof infection to inmates likewise fails to state a substantive due process claim \nbecause the jail has a legitimate interest in limiting costs. \n  The issue of whether Defendants should do more to protect Plaintiffs from \ninfection is properly raised in Plaintiffs’ surviving deliberate indifference claim.  \nBecause Plaintiffs’ alleged facts state a claim for deliberate indifference under the \nFourteenth Amendment, Plaintiffs cannot also bring a substantive due process \nclaim alleging the same facts.  See Dang v. Sheriff, Seminole Cnty., 871 F.3d \n1272, 1280 (11th Cir. 2017).  Significantly, Plaintiffs did not even argue that the \nMagistrate Judge erred in this determination.  Where a constitutional amendment \n“provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against . . . \nintrusive governmental conduct, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion \nof ‘substantive due process,’ must be the guide for analyzing [the claim].”  Graham \nv. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989); see Lanier, supra, 520 U.S. at 272 n.7. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 8 of 15\nIn Edwards v. Gilbert, 867 F.2d 1271 (11th Cir. 1989), a juvenile who had \nbeen convicted, but not sentenced, committed suicide while in detention.  His \nestate brought a 28 U.S.C. § 1983 action raising Eighth Amendment deliberate \nindifference and substantive due process claims.  The Eleventh Circuit held that  \n[i]nvocation of fourteenth amendment substantive due process\nalso adds nothing to plaintiff’s case.  If [the inmate] is entitled to\nprotection under the eighth amendment, then [the inmate] is\nafforded “no greater [substantive] protection” by the due process\nclause.  Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. [312,] 327 [(1986)].  We\nneed not decide whether [the inmate], as a convicted but not yet\nsentenced inmate, is protected by the eighth amendment as a\nprisoner or the fourteenth amendment as a pretrial detainee\nbecause in Hamm v. DeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th\nCir.1985), we held that “in regard to providing pretrial detainees\nwith such basic necessities as food, living space, and medical\ncare the minimum standard allowed by the due process clause is\nthe same as that allowed by the eighth amendment for convicted\npersons.”\nEdwards, 867 F.2d at 1274. \nUnder Edwards, Plaintiffs cannot raise a substantive due process claim in \naddition to their deliberate indifference claim, and Plaintiffs have failed to argue \notherwise in their objections.  Accordingly, this Court agrees with the Magistrate \nJudge that Plaintiffs’ unconstitutional punishment claim must be dismissed, and \ntherefore Plaintiffs’ objection is overruled. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 9 of 15\n2. ADA and Rehabilitation Claims\nPlaintiffs next assert that the Magistrate Judge erred in concluding that their\nclaims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act must be dismissed.  Relevant to \nthis discussion, both of those provisions prohibit discrimination by jail officials \nagainst persons with disabilities and provide that persons with disabilities shall not \nbe excluded from the benefits, services, programs or activities of the jail because of \ntheir disability.  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  Claims under either act \nare governed by the same standard, and courts “rely on cases construing [the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act] interchangeably.”  Silberman v. Miami Dade Transit, \n927 F.3d 1123, 1133 (11th Cir. 2019) (citation and quotation omitted). \nUnder both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, two distinct types of claims \nare available.  The first claim is a disparate treatment claim where, for example, an \nindividual is denied an opportunity for which he or she is qualified, such as a job, \nbecause of the disability.  The second type of claim is a failure to accommodate \nclaim where an entity denies a disabled person access to a program or service \nbecause the entity refuses or fails to provide reasonable accommodations that \nwould enable the disabled person to access the program.  This case only involves \nthe second type of claim.  Here, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants failed to \naccommodate their disability in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 10 of 15\nby refusing to make affirmative changes to protect people who, because of their \ndisabilities, are particularly vulnerable to severe illness or death if they contract \nCOVID-19.  In other words, Plaintiffs contend that because their disabilities1 cause \nthem to be more vulnerable if they happen to be infected with COVID-19, they are \nthus unable to participate in jail programs because of their fear of infection.  In \nrecommending dismissal of this claim, the Magistrate Judge determined that \nPlaintiffs’ claim could not succeed because Plaintiffs failed to request an \naccommodation for their disabilities.   \nThis Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their failure to \naccommodate claim for several reasons.  First, Plaintiffs failed to request a \nreasonable accommodation.  Generally, it is plaintiff who carries the burden of \ndemonstrating a reasonable accommodation.  Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, \n1367 (11th Cir. 2000).  Here, Plaintiffs assert that the only possible \naccommodation is release from custody.  This Court agrees with the Magistrate \nJudge that the sole accommodation demand that Plaintiffs make in their \nComplaint—release from jail—is unreasonable and not permitted under the Prison \n1 In their response to Plaintiffs’ objections, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed \nto allege that they are disabled under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  [Doc. 69, pp. 7-\n8].  For purposes of this discussion, this Court assumes without deciding that at least \nsome of Plaintiffs’ disabilities qualify. \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 11 of 15\nLitigation Reform Act of 1996.  [Doc. 52, pp. 36-37 n.13];  Gomez v. United \nStates, 899 F.2d 1124, 1126 (11th Cir. 1990) (holding that even if an inmate can \nshow that prison conditions violate the constitution, the remedy is not release from \ncustody but correction of the prison conditions).  Because Plaintiffs failed to allege \na reasonable accommodation in their Complaint, they have failed to state an \naccommodation claim under the ADA. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs did not request an accommodation.  Here, Plaintiffs \nargue that the Magistrate Judge erred in holding that requesting an accommodation \nis a requirement in establishing a failure to accommodate claim because “[n]either \nthe statutes nor the case law interpreting them impose any such requirement.”  \n[Doc. 60, p. 11].  Plaintiffs’ objection, however, is without merit as Eleventh \nCircuit case law clearly establishes that requesting an accommodation is a \nprerequisite for establishing an accommodation claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.     \nThis Court acknowledges that a public entity may have a duty to \naccommodate a disability where the disability is plainly obvious regardless of \nwhether a request for an accommodation has been made.  Robertson v. Las Animas \nCnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t., 500 F.3d 1185, 1197 (10th Cir. 2007).  Here, Plaintiffs do \nnot allege in their Complaint that their conditions are obvious, and those conditions \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 12 of 15\n(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart \ndisease) are not of the sort that are immediately apparent.  As such, even if \nDefendants have a duty to accommodate a disability where the disability is plainly \nobvious regardless of whether a request for an accommodation has been made, the \ndisabilities in this case are not plainly obvious. \nSignificantly, the case law that Plaintiffs cite is inapposite.  For instance, the \nplaintiff in Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 \n(1998), raised an ADA disparate treatment claim, not an accommodation claim, \nand United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006), mostly concerns the question \nof whether Title II of the ADA abrogates state sovereign immunity insofar as it \ncreates a private cause of action for damages against states and does not touch on \nthe issue of whether an accommodation must be requested before a plaintiff can \nbring an ADA claim.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs’ objection pertaining to the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act claim is overruled.   \n3. Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Claim\nIn the final count of the Complaint, Plaintiffs seek a writ of habeas corpus\nfor immediate release from custody pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  The Magistrate \nJudge recommended dismissing this claim because § 2241 relief is unavailable \nunder Eleventh Circuit precedent in conditions of confinement cases.  See Boyd v. \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 13 of 15\nWarden, 856 F.3d 853, 865 (11th Cir. 2017) (explaining that “habeas and § 1983 \nare mutually exclusive avenues for relief” (internal quotation marks omitted));2 \nVaz v. Skinner, 634 F. App’x 778, 781 (11th Cir. 2015) (ruling that a “§ 2241 \npetition is not the appropriate vehicle for raising an inadequate medical care claim, \nas such a claim challenges the conditions of confinement, not the fact or duration \nof that confinement”).  \nIn their objections, Plaintiffs argue that this is not a conditions of \nconfinement case because only release or transfer from the Clayton County Jail \nwill adequately safeguard Plaintiffs.  This Court disagrees with Plaintiffs’ \nargument that this is not a conditions of confinement case.  Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nprimarily addresses the conditions of the Clayton County Jail, the likelihood of \nCOVID-19 spreading within the detention center and the impossibility of \neliminating all potential risk of contracting COVID-19 due to purportedly \ninadequate conditions.  “Thus, it appears that [Plaintiffs] are in fact challenging the \nconditions of their confinement because absent those conditions, their claims \nwould not exist.”  Matos v. Lopez Vega, No. 20-CIV-60784-RAR, 2020 WL \n2298775, at *6 (S.D. Fla. May 6, 2020).  Ultimately, because Plaintiffs are seeking \n2 Plaintiffs’ contention that they may bring a “hybrid” §1983/2241 action relies entirely \non case law from outside the Eleventh Circuit. \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 14 of 15\nto contest the conditions of their confinement, they cannot avail themselves of a \npetition for writ of habeas corpus.3   \n  This Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiffs’ argument that an exception should \nbe made here regarding the inapplicability of writs of habeas corpus to \nconstitutional confinement claims.  While this Court recognizes that the Middle \nDistrict of Georgia has noted that it is possible that an exception may exist where \nthe only possible remedy to an unconstitutional condition is release, A.S.M. v. \nWarden, Stewart Cnty. Det. Ctr., No. 7:20-CV-62 (CDL), 2020 WL 2988307 at *4 \n(M.D. Ga. June 3, 2020), this Court is not convinced that this case presents that \npossibility, and it is clear that the controlling case law in this circuit requires the \nCourt to dismiss Plaintiffs’ § 2241 claims.4  Ultimately, this objection is overruled. \nCONCLUSION \nAfter reviewing the entirety of the Non-Final Report and Recommendation \nand considering Plaintiffs’ objections, the Non-Final Report and Recommendation \n \n3 Much of Plaintiffs’ argument relies on law from other circuits.  While these circuits \nhave held that similar petitions are appropriately decided via habeas relief based on \nalready existing binding circuit precedent, no such binding precedent exists in this case.  \n4 In a footnote, the Magistrate Judge also determined that habeas corpus relief was \nunavailable because of the Younger abstention doctrine and Plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust \ntheir administrative remedies.  Plaintiffs contend that this finding was erroneous.  \nBecause the fact remains that this is a conditions of confinement case precluding § 2241 \nrelief, this Court need not address whether the Magistrate Judge erred in this regard.   \n  14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB   Document 73   Filed 11/19/20   Page 15 of 15\n[Doc. 52] is ADOPTED as the order of this Court.  For the reasons stated by the \nMagistrate Judge, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 23] is GRANTED IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART.     \nSO ORDERED this 19th day of November, 2020. \n15 ",

INTRODUCTION \nThis is a civil rights class action lawsuit filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 \nand §12101, 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) by Plaintiffs Rhonda Jones, \nRandolph Mitchell, Michael Singleton, and Barry Watkins (“Plaintiffs”), who all \neither are or were incarcerated at the Clayton County Jail (the “Jail”). (Doc. 1, pp. \n5–6.) Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Defendants \nVictor Hill, Roland Boehrer, Terrance Gibson, Kevin Thomas, and Maurice Johnson \n(“Defendants”), in their official capacities, for the release or transfer of Plaintiffs \nand other inmates, for the mitigation of the alleged conditions in the Jail, and to \nrequire “safe and sanitary” conditions of confinement in the Jail. (Id., p. 109.) \nPlaintiffs also seek an issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, and an award of attorney’s \nfees. (Id.) The relevant allegations in this matter are regarding COVID-19 and the \nJail. (Id.) \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on July 1, 2020.  (Doc. 1.)  On July 27, 2020, \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 19), a motion to expedite \nhearing on the preliminary injunction (Doc. 20), and a motion to expedite discovery \n(Doc 21).  Defendants intend to respond to these motions separately and show that \nthe conditions at the Jail are not what Plaintiffs portray and significant mitigation \nprotocols  are  underway  to  combat  COVID-19.    However,  as  shown  below, \nPlaintiffs’ claims are subject to dismissal for several reasons without the Court \n- 1 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 5 of 32\nneeding to reach Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, hold an evidentiary \nhearing, or allow for expedited discovery.   \nFirst, Defendants are entitled to Eleventh Amendment Immunity.  Second, \nPlaintiffs’ claims against employees of the Sheriff in their official capacities are \nredundant  and  subject  to  dismissal.    Third,  Plaintiffs  failed  to  exhaust  their \nadministrative remedies at the Jail prior to filing this lawsuit as required by the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”). Fourth, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring \nthis lawsuit because their allegations of future injury are speculative and they failed \nto sue the medical provider at the Jail, CorrectHealth, LLC, which is a necessary \nparty.  Fifth, Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for habeas relief because their claims \nrelate to alleged conditions at the Jail and not the cause or duration of their detention, \nand Plaintiffs have not exhausted all available state court proceedings before seeking \nhabeas relief.  Finally, Plaintiffs’ allegations fail to state a claim under the ADA or \nRA, and their unconstitutional punishment claim in Count I is not a proper claim.  \nFor these reasons discussed in detail below, Defendants ask that the Court grant their \nmotion and dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint in its entirety. \nII.  ARGUMENT AND CITATION OF AUTHORITY \nA.  The Sheriff and His Employees in Their Official Capacities are Entitled \nto Eleventh Amendment Immunity  \n \n“The Eleventh Amendment protects a State from being sued in federal court \nwithout the State’s consent.” Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir. 2003). \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 32\n“To receive Eleventh Amendment immunity, a defendant need not be labeled a ‘state \nofficer’ or ‘state official,’ but instead need only be acting as an ‘arm of the State,’ \nwhich includes agents and instrumentalities of the State.”  Id.  A sheriff “functions \nas an arm of the State . . . when promulgating policies and procedures governing \nconditions of confinement at the [county jail].”  Purcell v. Toombs Cnty., 400 F.3d \n1313, 1325 (11th Cir. 2005). The Eleventh Amendment thus precludes a plaintiff \nfrom suing a sheriff when he acts as an arm of the State.  Purcell, 400 F.3d at 1325. \nThe same preclusion applies to deputies sued in their official capacities.  Scott v. \nMercier, 268 F. App’x. 872, 873 (11th Cir. 2008); Scruggs v. Lee, 256 F. App’x. \n229, 231-232 (11th Cir. 2007).  Under the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh \nAmendment immunity, however, prospective injunctive relief is not barred by the \nEleventh Amendment.   Page v. Hicks, 773 F. App’x 514, 518 (11th Cir. 2019). \n  Here,  Plaintiffs’  claims  against  Defendants  in  their  official  capacities \nchallenging policies concerning conditions of confinement at the Clayton County \nJail.  (Doc. 1.)  While Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiffs’ claims for prospective \ninjunctive relief against the Sheriff in his official capacity are not barred by the \nEleventh Amendment under the Ex parte Young exception, all other claims are \nbarred. \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 7 of 32\nB.  Redundant Official Capacity Claims Are Subject to Dismissal  \n \n          While Plaintiffs’ complaint identifies Defendants Boehrer, Gibson, Thomas, \nand Johnson as parties in their official capacities, Plaintiffs’ claims against these \nDefendants are claims, in essence, against Sheriff Hill, who is already named in the \ncomplaint.  Indeed, “[o]fficial-capacity suit[s] . . . ‘generally represent only another \nway  of  pleading  an  action  against  an  entity  of  which  an  officer  is  an \nagent.’”  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985).  As such, “there no longer \nexists a need to bring official-capacity actions against local government officials, \nbecause local government units can be sued directly.” S.W. v. Clayton Cty. Pub. \nSch., 185 F. Supp. 3d 1366, 1374-75 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (citing Busby v. City of \nOrlando, 931 F.2d 764, 776 (11th Cir. 1991)).   \n          Here, Defendants Boehrer, Gibson, Thomas, and Johnson are employees of \nthe Sheriff.  See Manders, 338 F.3d at 1311.  Plaintiffs’ suit against these parties in \ntheir official capacities is, therefore, technically a suit against Sheriff Hill.  Brown \nv. Neumann, 188 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir. 1999) (a suit against a governmental \nofficial  in  her  official  capacity  is  deemed  a  suit  against  the  entity  that  she \nrepresents).   Plaintiffs  naming  of  Defendants  Boehrer,  Gibson,  Thomas,  and \nJohnson in their official capacities is duplicative and unwarranted. See S.W. v. \nClayton Cty., 185 F. Supp. 3d at 1374-75. Therefore, Defendants Boehrer, Gibson, \nThomas, and Johnson should be dismissed from this matter. \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 8 of 32\nC.  Plaintiffs’ § 1983 Claims Are Subject to Dismissal Under The PLRA \n \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act, or PLRA, requires that inmates exhaust all \navailable  administrative  remedies  before  filing  a  lawsuit  regarding  a  jail’s \nconditions.  42  U.S.C.  §  1997e(a).  The  Supreme  Court  has  held  “[t]here  is  no \nquestion that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims \ncannot be brought in court.” Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007); Porter v. \nNussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002) (“[The] requirement applies to all inmate suits \nabout prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, \nand whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.”).  As discussed \nbelow, Plaintiffs failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies regarding \ntheir  claims  brought  under  §1983  because  they  either  did  not  file  grievances \nregarding the conditions they complain of, or did not file an appeal.   \n  1.  Legal Standard on a Motion to Dismiss Under the PLRA \n  “Deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies \nis a two-step process.”  Turner v. Burnside, 541 F.3d 1077, 1082 (11th Cir. 2008).   \nFirst,  the  court  looks  to  the  factual  allegations  in  the \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss and those in the plaintiff’s \nresponse, and if they conflict, takes the plaintiff’s version \nof the facts as true.  If, in that light, the defendant is entitled \nto have the complaint dismissed for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, it must be dismissed. \n \nId.  The PLRA exhaustion defense is generally analyzed using the subject matter \njurisdiction standard of Rule 12(b)(1). See Bryant v. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374–76 \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 9 of 32\n(11th Cir. 2008); Turner, 541 F.3d at 1082 (“This means that procedurally the \ndefense  is  treated  ‘like  a  defense  of  lack  of  jurisdiction,’  although  it  is  not  a \njurisdictional matter.”). \n[Second,] [i]f the complaint is not subject to dismissal at \nthe first step, where the plaintiff’s allegations are assumed \nto  be  true,  the  court  then  proceeds  to  make  specific \nfindings in order to resolve the disputed factual issues \nrelated to exhaustion.   \nTurner, 541 F.3d at 1082.  “Once the court makes findings on the disputed issues of \nfact, it then decides whether under those findings the prisoner has exhausted his \navailable administrative remedies.”  Id. at 1083. \n2.  Plaintiffs Must Exhaust Administrative Remedies Before Filing § \n1983 Claims \n \nThe PLRA provides in pertinent part: \nNo  action  shall  be  brought  with  respect  to  prison \nconditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other \nFederal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or \nother  correctional  facility  until  such  administrative \nremedies as are available are exhausted. \n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The language of the statute demonstrates it applies to inmates \nconfined in a jail.  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 402 (2015) (“[The PLRA] \napplies to both pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners.”).  A court does not have \nthe  discretion  to  waive  the  exhaustion  requirement  and  there  are  no  “special \ncircumstances” exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.  Alexander v. Hawk, 159 \nF.3d 1321, 1325–26 (11th Cir. 1998); see Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850 (2016). \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 10 of 32\nThe PLRA requires “proper” exhaustion. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81 \n(2006). For inmates to “properly” exhaust their claims, they must “us[e] all steps” \nin the administrative process, and they must comply with “deadlines and other \ncritical procedural rules.” Id. at 89 (internal quotations omitted). If an administrative \nremedy is “available,” it must be exhausted.  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Alexander v. \nHawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir. 1998). To exhaust all available administrative \nremedies, inmates must also pursue all administrative appeals.  Moore v. Smith, 18 \nF.  Supp.  2d  1360,  1362  (N.D.  Ga.  1998).  If  inmates  fail  to  complete  the \nadministrative  process  or  fall  short  of  compliance  with  the  procedural  rules \ngoverning inmate grievances, they default their claims.  Johnson v. Meadows, 418 \nF.3d 1152, 1159 (11th Cir. 2005).  Recently, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized the \napplicability  of  the  PLRA  and  the  exhaustion  procedure  to  COVID-19  related \nconditions of confinement claims.  See, e.g., Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1292 \n(11th Cir. 2020) (finding that the district court erred in refusing to consider the \ndefendants’ arguments with respect to PLRA exhaustion in COVID-19 conditions \nof confinement case).1  \n \n1 See also Sanchez v. Brown, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90667, *56 (N.D. Tex. May \n22, 2020) (finding that PLRA exhaustion requirements apply to § 1983 claims \narising from COVID-19 and conditions of confinement claims); Nellson v. Barnhart, \nNo. 20-cv-00756-PAB, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66971, at *13 (D. Colo. Apr. 16, \n2020) (finding that plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before \nseeking judicial relief in COVID-19 jail conditions case). \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 11 of 32\n3.  Plaintiffs Failed to Exhaust Administrative Remedies Before \nFiling § 1983 Claims \nThe Jail has formal procedures in place for persons confined in the Jail to file \ngrievances when they feel it is necessary to do so. (See Declaration of Terrance \nGibson attached hereto as Exhibit A, ¶ 3.) The Clayton County Sheriff’s Office \nStandard Grievance Procedure (the “Grievance Procedure”) provides: \na.   Prior to the filing of a formal written grievance, an \ninmate  shall  attempt  to  resolve  his  or  her  grievance \ninformally  through  discussion  with  an  officer.    If  this \neffort fails, the inmate may submit a written grievance. \nThe inmate must file the grievance within five (5) days of \nthe alleged incident.  Any grievances unresolved at the \ntime of the inmate’s release shall be considered closed. \n \ne.   If the inmate disagrees with the response from the \nGrievance Officer, the inmate shall submit a written \nappeal to the Jail Administrator or his/her designee \nwithin two (2) days. The Jail Administrator or his/her \ndesignee  may  support  the  original  resolution  or  offer \nanother. The Jail Administrator or his/her designee shall \nreturn his or her decision within ten (10) days. \n \nf.   If the inmate fails to submit a written notification of \ndisagreement  within  two  (2)  days  of  the  receipt,  the \ngrievance shall be considered administratively closed. \n \n(Id., Exhibit 1 (emphasis added).) \nUnder the Grievance Procedure above, if an inmate intends to file a grievance, \nthe inmate must do so in writing within five (5) days of the incident giving rise to \nthe grievance. (Id.) Moreover, if an inmate is displeased with the resolution of the \ninmate’s formal grievance, then the Jail has appeal procedures in place stating the \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 12 of 32\ninmate shall file an appeal to the Jail Administrator or his/her designee within two \n(2) days. (Id.)  Inmates are advised of the Grievance Procedure during inmate \norientation.  (Id., ¶ 7.)  In the complaint, moreover, Plaintiffs show they are aware \nthat the Jail has grievance procedures. (Doc. 1, pp. 22, 24, 48–51.) As shown below, \nPlaintiffs each failed to exhaust the Jail’s administrative remedies prior to filing suit. \n  a.  Barry Watkins \nAttached to Lieutenant Terrance Gibson’s Declaration as Exhibit 2 are all of \nthe grievances submitted by Plaintiffs through July 10, 2020.  (Exhibit A, ¶ 4 and \nExhibit 2 thereto.)  The Jail’s records show that Watkins never submitted any \ngrievances related to COVID-19 and the alleged conditions of the Jail prior to filing \nsuit.    (Id.)  Therefore,  Watkins  failed  to  even  initiate  the  grievance  procedure \nnecessary to exhaust his administrative remedies.   \nb.  Rhonda Jones \n  The Jail’s records show that Jones never submitted any grievances related to \nCOVID-19 and the alleged conditions of the Jail prior to filing suit.  (Id.)  On June \n4,  2020,  however,  Jones  did  submit  an  appeal  to  a  previously  filed  grievance \nrequesting to be refunded money, wherein she raised for the first time the following:  \n“THIS  PLACE  ISNT  UPGRADING  MEDICAL  STANDARDS  TO  COMPLY \nWITH COVID 19!!! THE PHONES ARE NOT SANTISED.  THERES WATER \nLEAKING IN MY ROOM.  I HAVE HAD 4 NEW ADMITS ROOM MATES \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 13 of 32\nTHAT CAME STRAIGHT TO POPULATION.  AND IVE NOT NOTICED ANY \nUSE OF LYSOL.  I TEXTED ABOUT THIS TO NO AVAIL.  THE STAFF \nFOCUS ON BEDS BUT NOY LYSOL.”  (Id., Exhibit 3, p. 1.)  While the new \nsubject matter presented in the appeal was related to purported medical standards, \nsanitization of phones, a water leak, room assignment, and use of Lysol, this appeal \ndoes not properly exhaust administrative remedies because Jones did not follow the \nGrievance Procedure by first filing her concerns via a grievance as opposed to an \nappeal.  Moreover, the Grievance Procedure provides that “[i]nmates may only \naddress one area of concern per Grievance Form.” (Id., Exhibit 1.)  Jones’ attempt \nto raise multiple issues in an appeal from an unrelated grievance is not a proper \nmethod of exhausting the Jail’s administrative remedies.    \n  Even if the Court is persuaded that Jones’ grievance masquerading as an \nappeal from a separate unrelated grievance is substantively adequate, Jones still \nfailed to exhaust her administrative remedies because she never pursued an appeal \nfrom the response.  (Id., Exhibit 3.)  Therefore, for this additional reason, Jones’s \nclaim is procedurally barred by the PLRA.  Moore, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 1362 (holding \nthat inmate must pursue all of his administrative appeals in order to comply with the \nPLRA’s administrative exhaustion requirement); Mason v. Bridger, 261 F. App’x \n225,  229  (11th  Cir.  2008)  (finding  that  inmate’s  failure  to  appeal  denials  of \ngrievances was fatal to consideration of his claims on the merits).   \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 14 of 32\n  c.  Randolph Mitchell \nThe Jail’s records show that Mitchell submitted a grievance on May 19, 2020 \nrequesting to “speak to someone about a covid 19 test” and that he also wanted a \nCOVID-19 test and a mask. (Exhibit A, Exhibit 2 thereto, p. 7.)  However, the notes \nin response show that he was “scheduled for sick call” and was referred “to security \nfor mask.”  (Id.)  To the extent Mitchell did not receive the test or the mask, he could \nhave appealed the grievance. However, according to the Jail’s records, Mitchell \nnever pursued an appeal as required under the Grievance Procedure and therefore \nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Id., Exhibit 3.)  \nEven if Mitchell properly exhausted his administrative remedies, as Plaintiffs \nconcede, Mitchell is no longer incarcerated at the Jail, which “moot[s] his claims.” \n(Doc. 9, n. 2.)  Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir. 2007) (“[t]he general \nrule in our circuit is that a transfer or release of a prisoner from prison will moot that \nprisoner’s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.”).2 \n  d.  Michael Singleton \nFinally, the Jail’s records show that Singleton submitted a grievance on May \n15, 2020 requesting masks, cleaning supplies, disinfectant, and “net bags to do our \n \n2 See also Zatler v. Wainwright, 802 F.2d 397 (11th Cir. 1986) (“[i]n view of Zatler’s \nrelease, we find that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are now moot.”); \nWahl v. McIver, 773 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir. 1985)(“[a]bsent class certification, \nan inmate’s claim for injunctive and declaratory relief in a section 1983 action fails \nto present a case or controversy once the inmate has been transferred.”). \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 15 of 32\npersonal laundry.” (Exhibit A, Exhibit 2 thereto, p. 12.) The notes in response show \nthat “All issues have been addressed.”  (Id.)  To the extent Singleton had any issues \nwith the response or what he was provided, he could have appealed. Mitchell, \nhowever, never pursued an appeal and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative \nremedies. (Id., Exhibit 3.) \nFor  the  reasons  above,  Plaintiffs’  claims  brought  under  §1983  are \nprocedurally barred by the PLRA for failure to exhaust all available administrative \nremedies before bringing this suit. Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th \nCir.  2004)  (finding  that  inmate  satisfied  PLRA’s  exhaustion  requirement  by \nfollowing  the  proper  grievance  procedure  when  unsatisfied  with  response  to \ngrievance).3 \n \n \n3  Should  the  Court  find  that  any  of  the  Plaintiffs  properly  exhausted  the \nadministrative remedies, then the Court should limit Plaintiffs’ claims only to the \nspecific items of concern brought to the Jail staff’s attention, which are sanitization \nof phones, masks, cleaning supplies, disinfectant, and COVID-19 tests. (Id., Exhibit \n2.) Plaintiffs’ challenges to conditions outside of these five specific categories have \nnot been properly brought to the attention of the Jail’s staff through the Grievance \nProcedure prior to suit and should be dismissed outright for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies.  Sylvester v. Chandler, No. 07 C 50050, 2010 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 88683, at *13 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 27, 2010) (“Because the June grievance failed \nto identify misconduct or describe those who treated him badly, it did not provide \nthe prison with any opportunity to address plaintiff’s concern that he was being \nabused by Dixon nurses. Accordingly, the court finds that plaintiff did not exhaust \nhis remedies with respect to the claims”). \n \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 16 of 32\n4.  Plaintiffs  Failed  to  Follow  the  PLRA’s  Required  Procedure  to \nObtain an Inmate Release Order \n \nPlaintiffs have requested the “release” of themselves and other inmates held \nat the Jail. (Doc. 1, p. 109.)  Under the PLRA, a federal court may not enter an \ninmate release order unless there has been a prior order “for less intrusive relief that \nhas failed to remedy the deprivation of the Federal right sought to be remedied \nthrough the prison release order,” and the defendant “has had a reasonable amount \nof time to comply with the previous court order[].” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A).   \nAdditionally, only a three-judge court may enter a prison release order and \ncan only do so after an inmate files an appropriate request. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(3); see \nLaube v. Haley, 242 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1152 (M.D. Ala. 2003). The three-judge \npanel may enter such an order “only if the court finds by clear and convincing \nevidence that—(i) crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a Federal right; \nand (ii) no other relief will remedy the violation of the Federal right.” 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(3).   \nHere,  Plaintiffs  may  not  circumvent  the  PLRA’s  unambiguous \nrequirements to obtain release. Plaintiffs complain about the current conditions of the \nJail, and as previously discussed, such complaints fall squarely within the purview \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 17 of 32\nof the PLRA. Because there has been no prior order entered and this case is not \nbefore a three-judge panel, Plaintiffs may not obtain release as an available remedy.4   \nD.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Bring this Lawsuit Seeking Injunctive Relief \n1.  Plaintiffs Do Not Adequately Allege an Injury in Fact \nWhile Plaintiffs allege COVID-19 may be a risk to their health if contracted, \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  allege  they  have  a  real  prospect  of  a  future  injury \nmanifesting,  i.e.,  contracting  COVID-19,  and  therefore  lack  standing  to  seek \ninjunctive relief.  \nRegarding standing to seek injunctive relief, “[b]ecause injunctions regulate \nfuture conduct, a party has standing to seek injunctive relief only if the party alleges, \nand ultimately proves, a real and immediate—as opposed to a merely conjectural or \nhypothetical—threat of future injury.” Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, \n1337 (11th Cir. 1994). “And an injunction cannot be fashioned when the prospect of \nfuture injury is only speculative; again, there must be a ‘likelihood of substantial and \nimmediate irreparable injury.’” Gagliardi v. TJCV Land Tr., 889 F.3d 728, 734 (11th \nCir. 2018) (citing Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983)). \n \n4 Should Plaintiffs’ claims proceed, they still “would not be entitled to the relief [they \nseek] because release from imprisonment is not an available remedy for a conditions-\nof-confinement claim.” Vaz v. Skinner, 634 F. App’x 778, 781 (11th Cir. 2015). \n \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 18 of 32\nPlaintiffs allege that the Jail has “approximately 2,000 detainees” and allege \nas of June 11, 2020, “32 detainees and 13 staff members” have tested positive for \nCOVID-19.  (Doc. 1, p. 4–5.)  Plaintiffs therefore contend that only 1.6% of \ninmates have tested positive for COVID-19 which is far from the “outbreak” \nPlaintiffs allege has occurred at the Jail. Additionally, the complaint is devoid of \nany allegations that any inmates at the Jail have died as a result of COVID-19. (Id.) \nPlaintiffs’ “prospect of future injury” is only speculative. Plaintiffs do not \nallege  that  they  have  contracted  COVID-19  during  the  pendency  of  their \nincarceration.  Plaintiffs fail to show in the complaint that they have a greater \nlikelihood of contracting COVID-19 in the Jail as opposed to if they were released \nand exposed elsewhere.  Indeed, the death toll in Georgia, in the United States, and \nglobally as well as the percentages of infection are all greater than in the Jail.  Due \nto the low infection rate at the Jail, Plaintiffs only speculate that they will be \nexposed to COVID-19, speculate that they may contract COVID-19, and speculate \nthat they would suffer injury thereby.  Gagliardi, 889 F.3d at 734.  Therefore, \nbecause the likelihood of future injury at the Jail is mere guesswork, “[a]nd an \ninjunction  cannot  be  fashioned  when  the  prospect  of  future  injury  is  only \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 19 of 32\nspeculative,” Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief from the Court, and \nthe claims for injunctive relief should be dismissed. 5 Id. \n2.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Adequately  Alleged  Traceability  and \nRedressability Because They Did Not Sue CorrectHealth, LLC \n \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief pertaining to medical education on the novel \nCOVID-19 virus, to change or formulate the medical screening process as they deem \nfit, for a  supply of COVID-19 tests, administration of COVID-19 tests, alteration of \nexisting  COVID-19  responses,  including  detecting,  quarantining,  evaluating \nsymptoms, and treating COVID-19, and administering influenza vaccinations, to \nname a few.  (See, e.g., Doc. 19-5.)   \nAs  Plaintiffs  are  well  familiar  with,  the  medical  provider  at  the  Jail  is \nCorrectHealth, LLC.  (Doc. 19-9.) However, Plaintiffs did not name CorrectHealth, \nLLC to this action and therefore lack standing to seek medically-related injunctive \nrelief.    The  Eleventh  Circuit  recently  explained,  “[t]o  satisfy  the  causation \nrequirement  of  standing,  a  plaintiff’s  injury  must  be  ‘fairly  traceable  to  the \nchallenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.’”  Jacobson v. Fla. Sec’y, 957 F.3d 1193, 1207 \n(11th Cir. 2020).  Further, “it must be the effect of the court’s judgment on the \ndefendant—not an absent third party—that redresses the plaintiff’s injury, whether \n \n5 Because Mitchell is no longer subject to any conditions at the Jail, he lacks standing \nfor this additional reason. \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 20 of 32\ndirectly or indirectly.” Lewis v. Governor of Ala., 944 F.3d 1287, 1301 (11th Cir. \n2019).  \nPlaintiffs have only named the Sheriff in this action and his employees, even \nthough Plaintiffs are aware that CorrectHealth, LLC is contracted to provide medical \ncare and services at the Jail.   (Doc. 19-5.)  Thus, even if Plaintiffs obtain all the \nrelief they seek, this Court’s order cannot enjoin “absent nonparties.” Jacobson, 957 \nF.3d at 1208. Because Plaintiffs seek targeted relief from the Sheriff while leaving \nout a necessary party, CorrectHealth, LLC, they fail to establish redressability for \ntheir claimed “injuries.”  Thus, Plaintiffs undermine their own claims of imminent \n“injury”  by  leaving  out  the  actual  medical  provider  at  the  Jail  which  would \nnecessarily prolong any uniform implementation or enforcement of any order issued \nby this Court.  \nSome  District  Courts  have  succumbed  to  the  temptation  to  correct  the \ndeficient pleadings of a plaintiff that fails to join all necessary parties, but the \nEleventh  Circuit  decision  in  Jacobson  suggests  this  Court  should  refrain  from \nembarking on such a course of action.  Jacobson, 957 F.3d at 1209 (“If a plaintiff \nsues the wrong defendant, an order enjoining the correct official who has not been \njoined as a defendant cannot suddenly make the plaintiff's injury redressable.”). A \ndeclaratory  judgment  or  injunction  against  the  Sheriff  here  does  not  apply  to \nCorrectHealth, LLC “who [is] not [a] part[y] to this action.” Id.  “Any persuasive \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 21 of 32\neffect a judicial order might have upon [non-parties] . . . cannot suffice to establish \nredressability.”  Id. at 1208.  Therefore, the “failure to join [CorrectHealth, LLC] is \nan independent reason that [Plaintiffs] lack standing,” id. at 1207, and in turn, this \nCourt should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint because they have not adequately alleged \nfacts sufficient to support standing.  \nE.  Plaintiffs’ Habeas Claims Are Subject to Dismissal \n \n1.  Plaintiffs Have Not Stated a Claim for Habeas Relief Because Their \nClaims  Relate  to  Conditions  at  the  Jail  and  Not  the  Cause  or \nDuration of Their Detention   \n \nA habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is “generally reserved for \nchallenges to execution of a sentence or the nature of confinement, not the validity \nof the sentence itself or the fact of confinement.” Bryant v. Warden, 738 F.3d 1253, \n1288 (11th Cir. 2013).  “Habeas is not available to review questions unrelated to the \ncause of detention. Its sole function is to grant relief from unlawful imprisonment or \ncustody and it cannot be used properly for any other purpose.” Villafuerte v. Warden, \nStewart Det. Ctr., No. 4:18-CV-116-CDL-MSH, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 212877, at \n*6–7 (M.D. Ga. Nov. 27, 2018) (citing Pierre v. United States, 525 F.2d 933, 935-\n36 (5th Cir. 1976)).  \nHere, Plaintiffs complain about their conditions of confinement, not the cause \nfor their detention. When claiming inadequate conditions of confinement, a petition \nfor a writ of habeas corpus is not the proper vehicle for such a claim.  Vaz v. Skinner, \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 22 of 32\n634 F. App’x 778, 781 (11th Cir. 2015) (“Petitioner’s § 2241 petition is not the \nappropriate vehicle for raising an inadequate medical care claim, as such a claim \nchallenges  the  conditions  of  confinement,  not  the  fact  or  duration  of  that \nconfinement.”); see A.S.M. v. Donahue, No. 7:20-CV-62 (CDL), 2020 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 65226, at *4 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 10, 2020) (finding “writ of habeas corpus is not \nthe appropriate mechanism for seeking the relief Petitioners request” as related to \nCOVID-19 and the conditions of detention center). Therefore, habeas corpus is not \navailable to inmates who complain about the conditions of confinement.  \nHere, Plaintiffs have not pleaded, and cannot plead, any set of facts under \nwhich they could obtain  habeas  relief.  Plaintiffs make a plethora of complaints \nabout the conditions of—not the fact of—their confinement. As three examples: \n“The overcrowded cells where detainees spend most of their time are almost never \nsanitized. . . . The 20-year-old jail facility has recurring maintenance issues. . . . In \nsum,  the  Clayton  County  Jail  is  understaffed,  unsanitary,  and  chronically \nmismanaged.” (Doc. 1, p. 27, 28, 30.) Such allegations concern the conditions of the \nJail, and not the “fact” of Plaintiffs’ confinement.  \nWhatever their conditions of confinement, they are not related to Plaintiffs’ \n“fact or duration” of their respective confinements. Therefore, a habeas corpus \npetition under § 2241 is not the proper vehicle for Plaintiffs to present such claims \nor allegations and Plaintiffs’ request for such relief should be dismissed. \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 23 of 32\n2.  Plaintiffs’ Habeas Claims Must Be Dismissed Because Plaintiffs \nHave Not Exhausted Available State Court Remedies   \n \n  Even if the Court were to determine Plaintiffs could seek relief under § 2241, \nexhaustion of administrative remedies under state law is a prerequisite to filing a \nhabeas corpus petition.  In order to be eligible for habeas relief, Plaintiffs must have \nexhausted their available state court remedies. O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, \n845, 119 S. Ct. 1728, 1732 (1999); Reedman v. Thomas, 305 F. App’x 544, 545 \n(11th Cir. 2008). It is Plaintiffs’ burden to show exhaustion. McNair v. Campbell, \n416 F.3d 1291, 1302 (11th Cir. 2005). A habeas petition must be dismissed if the \ninmates have not exhausted available state remedies concerning any of their claims. \nO’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 852. \nNotably,  the  exhaustion  doctrine  imposed  on  §  2241(c)(3)  is  based  on \nconcerns about the state-federal balance in order to protect state courts’ opportunity \nto  confront  and  resolve  initially  any  constitutional  issues  arising  within  their \njurisdictions, as well as to limit federal interference in the state adjudicatory process. \nBraden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U.S. 484, 489–92 (1973). The \nexhaustion requirement is satisfied when the substance of the federal habeas claim \nhas been fairly presented to the highest state court.    \nHabeas relief is available under Georgia law for both pre-trial detainees and \npost-conviction  detainees  to  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  their  detention. \nO.C.G.A. § 9-14-1, et seq. Clayton County courts, along with all courts in Georgia, \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 24 of 32\nare open and the courts are using all available means to conduct essential hearings. \n(Fourth Order Extending Declaration of Statewide Judicial Emergency, Supreme \nCourt of Georgia, July 10, 2020.)  Plaintiffs do not allege in their complaint that they \nhave made any attempt whatsoever to challenge their detention via state court \nproceedings first, prior to filing suit.  (Doc. 1.)  Because Plaintiffs have failed to \nexhaust state law remedies that are available pursuant to Georgia law, their claims \nmust be dismissed.  \nF.  Plaintiffs Fail to State A Claim Under Title II of The ADA or Section 504 \nof the RA \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) prohibits a public \nentity  from  discriminating  against  disabled individuals  and  states  that  “no \nqualified  individual  with  a  disability  shall,  by  reason  of  such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” \n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Similarly,  § 504  of  the Rehabilitation Act  (“RA”)  protects \nany “otherwise qualified individual” from “be[ing] excluded from the participation \nin, be[ing] denied the benefits of, or be[ing] subjected to discrimination” under \nspecified programs or activities “solely by reason of her or his disability.” 29 U.S.C. \n§ 794(a). \nTo state a claim under the ADA and RA, “a plaintiff generally must prove (1) \nthat he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was either excluded from \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 25 of 32\nparticipation in or denied the benefits of a public entity’s services, programs, or \nactivities, or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that \nthe exclusion, denial of benefit, or discrimination was by reason of the plaintiff’s \ndisability.” Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cty., 480 F.3d 1072, 1083 (11th Cir. 2007) \n(emphasis  added);  see  Cash  v.  Smith,  231  F.3d  1301,  1305  (11th  Cir.  2000) \n(“Discrimination claims under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same \nstandards used in ADA cases.”). \nHere, Plaintiffs contend that they are qualified individuals with disabilities \nbased  on  their  underlying  health  conditions.    Plaintiffs  outline  the  risks  of \ncontracting COVID-19 and have asserted  that  Defendants  have  generally  failed \nto take appropriate measures to protect all inmates at the Jail.  (Doc. 1.)  Plaintiffs, \nhowever, do not allege sufficient facts to establish that Defendants failed to provide \nPlaintiffs  with  any  reasonable  accommodations  by  reason  of  their  proposed \ndisabilities—other than  immediate  release  from  the  Jail—or  that  any  specific \naction  was  taken  against  Plaintiffs by reason of their proposed disabilities.  (Id.)  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims are subject to dismissal for failure to \nstate a claim. \nG.  Plaintiffs’ “Unconstitutional Punishment” Claim in Count I is Subject to \nDismissal For Failure to State a Claim \n \nPlaintiffs  have  improperly  attempted  to  carve  out  a  separate  claim  for \nunconstitutional “punishment” in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, as found \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 26 of 32\nin Count  I of the complaint, in  addition  to  seeking  relief  from  alleged \nunconstitutional  “conditions  of  confinement”  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendments, as found in Count II of the complaint.  (Doc. 1, pp. 100, \n101.)   \nThe Supreme Court held in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979) that \nconditions  claims  brought  by  pretrial  detainees  arise  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, which prohibits punishment prior to the adjudication of guilt.  A \ncondition violates the Fourteenth Amendment if it is imposed with the intent, express \nor inferred, to punish the pretrial detainee.  Id. at 538-40.  “The Eighth Amendment \n… ‘cruel and unusual punishments’ standard applies to the conditions of a prisoner’s \nconfinement.” Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1088 (11th Cir. 2020). This Circuit \nhas held that the decisional law applicable to prison inmates applies equally to \npretrial detainees.  Hamm v. DeKalb Cty., 774 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir. 1985); \nsee also Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1490 (11th Cir. 1996).  As a result, this \nCircuit  requires  a plaintiff,  regardless if that plaintiff  is  a pre-trial  detainee or \nprisoners,  challenging  the  conditions  of  confinement  to  show  both  that  the \ndeprivation  suffered  was  objectively  serious  and  that  prison  officials  were \ndeliberately indifferent to the violation of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights. See \nEvans v. St. Lucie Cty. Jail, 448 F. App’x 971, 973–75 (11th Cir. 2011) (requiring \nthat a pretrial detainee bringing a prison conditions case show that (1) the deprivation \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 27 of 32\nwas “sufficiently serious” and (2) prison officials had a “sufficiently culpable state \nof mind”). \nHere, Plaintiffs have  attempted to impose a rational basis test under the \nFourteenth Amendment as the proper standard of review for their claims related to \nthe  conditions  of  confinement,  which  is  in  direct  violation  of  the  principles \nestablished by the Supreme Court. Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 843, \n118 S. Ct. 1708, 1715 (1998) (“[I]f a constitutional claim is covered by a specific \nconstitutional provision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the claim must \nbe analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision, not under the \nrubric  of  substantive  due  process.”).  Plaintiffs  use  the  language  “Defendants’ \nconduct either is not rationally related to a legitimate, nonpunitive government \npurpose or is excessive in relation to a legitimate, nonpunitive government purpose” \nto attempt to create a claim for unconstitutional “punishment” in violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment, as found in Count I of the complaint. (Doc. 1, p. 100.)  \nHowever, examination of conditions of confinement is properly analyzed under a \ndeliberate indifference standard under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment.  See \nSwain, 958 F.3d at 1088; Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1574.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claim in \nCount I should be dismissed, as the claim is an improper carve out of a conditions \nof confinement claim, which Plaintiffs already assert in Count II.  \n \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 28 of 32\nIII.  CONCLUSION \n“Plaintiffs  requested  extraordinary  relief,  but  even—especially—in  these \nextraordinary times, the letter of the law must still be followed.”  Sanchez, 2020 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 90667, *60.  COVID-19  concerns are serious and are causing critical \nhealth  and  public  safety  issues  globally,  in  this  country,  in this state,  in  local \ngovernments, including jails, as well as within the framework of businesses and \ncorporations.    The  seriousness  of  COVID-19  cannot  be  ignored.    However, \nPlaintiffs’ complaint, which essentially mirrors complaints filed across the country \nas a wholesale attack on jails and prisons, must be dismissed outright for the reasons \nnoted above.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 23-1   Filed 08/03/20   Page 29 of 32\nFREEMAN MATHIS & GARY, LLP \n \n/s/ A.

      "text": "Case 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 1 of 28\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA \nATLANTA DIVISION \nRHONDA JONES et al.,   \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \n            CIVIL ACTION \nv. \n \n \n            NO. 1:20-CV-2791-JPB-CCB \nVICTOR HILL et al.,   \nDefendants. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ REPLY BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF  \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \n \nThe jail described in Defendants’ brief (Doc. 41) bears little resemblance to \nthe  one  in  which  Plaintiffs  are  held.    Defendants  claim  to  have  implemented \ncomprehensive  COVID-19  prevention  measures,  but  their  assertions  are \ncontradicted  by  detainees  who  describe  deplorable  conditions  and  harrowing \naccounts of illness and neglect.  Neither do Defendants acknowledge that most of \ntheir minimal mitigation measures occurred after this lawsuit was filed. \nPlaintiffs attach to this brief thirteen additional declarations from detainees \nwho  would  not  recognize  the  jail  described  in  Defendant  Terrance  Gibson’s \ndeclaration (Doc. 41-1) as the one in which they are incarcerated.  The declarations \nshow  that  Defendants  and  their  officers  ignore  people  who  report  COVID-19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 2 of 28\nsymptoms; fail to isolate infected persons; fail to test many people, against their own \nmedical provider’s advice; fail to provide detainees with useable facemasks; fail to \nprovide sufficient quantities of soap and cleaning supplies; and fail to enforce social \ndistancing measures.      \nAs for Defendants’ claim that “statistically speaking,” there is “no COVID-\n19 outbreak at the CCJ” (Doc. 41 at 4), that assertion crosses the line from partisan \nwordsmithing to misrepresentation of fact.  (Ex. A, Supp. Fefferman Decl. ¶ 7.)  \nDefendants’ description of the number of positive COVID-19 cases at the jail as \n“low” is not supported by Defendants’ own data, which shows consistently high \nCOVID-19 positivity rates over several months.  (Id. ¶¶ 7-10.) \nPlaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their  claims.    Given \nDefendants’ insufficient response to the pandemic, members of the putative class \nface an imminent risk of irreparable injury absent an injunction. The balance of \nharms favors Plaintiffs because the risk of serious illness is substantial and the \nproposed injunction is carefully crafted to give Defendants the responsibility in the \nfirst instance for formulating and implementing “reasonably specific and detailed \nwritten plans” to address deficient conditions.  (Doc. 19-15 ¶ 1.)  An injunction will \nserve the public interest by protecting the rights and lives of people in the Jail.   \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 3 of 28\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Many of the Prevention Measures Described in Defendants’ Brief \nAre Not Actually in Practice in the Jail. \n \n1.  Defendants  Have  Failed  to  Identify,  Isolate,  and  Treat \nInfected  Persons,  Instead  Leaving  Them  Inside  Crowded \nCells Where They Spread the Virus to Others. \n \nAccording to Defendants, “[i]f any inmate shows symptoms of COVID-19 \nafter intake,” the person is “separated from other inmates, medically evaluated in the \nmedical infirmary, and tested for COVID-19.”  (Doc. 41 at 12.)  Defendants are \nsilent regarding the testimony of numerous detainees who had precisely the opposite \nexperience.  (Doc. 19-1 at 8-9, 21.)  To give just a few examples: \n•  In April 2020, F.S., who had no mask, was locked in a cell with a woman who \nexperienced fever, vomiting, and coughing up blood.  (F.S. Decl. ¶¶ 21-24.)  \nF.S. became infected.  (Id. ¶ 25.)  She submitted a sick call request but did not \nsee a nurse for a week.  (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.)  Although she reported her symptoms, \nshe was left in her housing unit where she continued to congregate with others \nfor food service.  (Id. ¶ 25-27.)  F.S. and her cellmate were symptomatic for \ntwo weeks, during which they were neither tested nor isolated.  (Id. ¶ 27.) \n•  In April 2020, D.H. experienced symptoms of COVID-19.  (D.H. Decl. ¶ 20.)  \nHe reported his symptoms to a nurse but was not isolated or given a mask.  \n(Id. ¶ 23.)  For the next two weeks, he followed orders to perform his trustee \nfunctions while symptomatic.  (Id. ¶ 24.)  He spent twelve hours per day \npassing out meals in other housing units without a mask.  (Id.)   \n•  In May 2020, W.L.M was placed in a cell, without a mask, with a man who \nhad just been tested for COVID-19 and was symptomatic.  (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ \n18-19.)  W.L.M. developed symptoms of COVID-19.  (Id. ¶ 21.)  He told a \nnurse about his symptoms but was not given a mask or isolated.  (Id. ¶ 23.)  \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 4 of 28\nHe experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and “immense difficulty breathing.” (Id. \n¶ 28.)  One night, he “felt as if [his] lungs were going to collapse” (id. ¶ 29), \nand “begged [an officer] for medical attention” (id. ¶ 32) but received none.  \n(Id. ¶ 33.)   \n  \nMore recent declarations show that Defendants still fail to isolate and treat \npeople with COVID-19 symptoms.   \n•  In July 2020, S.T. developed a fever, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and loss of \nthe ability to taste.  (S.T. Decl. ¶ 11.)  Her cellmates experienced similar \nsymptoms.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  S.T. reported their symptoms to officers “at each count \nwithin the first day of the onset of symptoms.”  (Id. ¶ 12.)  When one of S.T.’s \ncellmates became dangerously short of breath, S.T. banged on the cell door \nfor assistance, but no one responded.  (Id.)  After three days of asking for help, \nS.T. saw a nurse.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  The nurse found that all three women had fevers, \nbut S.T. and her cellmates remained in the housing unit.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  S.T. was \nnot tested or isolated.  (Id. ¶ 15-16.)   \n•  In July 2020, a man showing symptoms of COVID-19, including “severe \ncoughing fits,” was moved into a cell shared by G.R. and R.C.  (G.R. Decl. ¶ \n7.)  G.R. and R.C. repeatedly told officers that the new cellmate could infect \nthem with COVID-19, but the symptomatic man was not moved for a week.  \n(Id. ¶ 7-8.)  R.C. then developed symptoms of COVID-19.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  R.C. \nreported these symptoms to officers and submitted sick call requests but was \nnot moved.  (Id.)  G.R. then developed COVID-19 symptoms.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  He \nsubmitted sick call requests asking to be tested and evaluated but “never \nreceived any response” and was not tested.  (Id.)         \n•  In  July  2020,  P.B.  developed  COVID-19  symptoms,  including  difficulty \nbreathing and inability to taste or smell.  (P.B. Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.)  He told an officer \nbut was not isolated or tested.  (Id.)  He then told a nurse about his symptoms \nand  requested  a  test,  but  the  nurse  only  took  his  temperature,  gave  him \nTylenol, and sent him back to his cell.  (Id.)  Worried he would infect others, \nP.B. asked an officer to move him out of the housing unit.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Instead, \nP.B. was moved within the same unit into a cell with two other men.  (Id.)  He \nwas not tested.  (Id.)  \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 5 of 28\n•  In June 2020, J.J.L.’s cellmate developed COVID-19 symptoms.  (J.J.L. Decl. \n¶¶ 6-7.)  After reporting his symptoms and asking officers for care for three \ndays, the cellmate finally lay on the dorm floor for hours in protest until a \nnurse was called.  (Id. ¶ 7.)  Soon thereafter, J.J.L. experienced vomiting, \nfever, and other symptoms.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  He too sought medical care for days but \nwas not taken to medical until an officer found him passed out on his cell \nfloor.  (Id. ¶¶ 9-11.)  J.J.L. was returned to the dorm without being tested.  (Id. \n¶ 12.) \n \n2.  Many  Detainees  with  Active  COVID-19  Symptoms  and \nRecent Exposure to Infected People Do Not Receive Tests.   \n \nDefendants claim that “[n]o inmates at the CCJ are denied a COVID-19 test.”  \n(Doc. 41 at 11.)1  Detainees report otherwise.  C.B. developed a fever and lost his \nsenses of taste and smell in late July.  (C.B. Decl. ¶ 6.)  He asked to be tested by \ngrievance, medical request, and verbal request.  (Id.)  C.B. states:  \nA nurse came to my cell and took my temperature. She told me my \ntemperature wasn’t high enough to bring me to the medical wing. I had \nno further contact from her or anyone else about my symptoms, which \nI continued to experience for weeks. I was not quarantined or provided \nwith any medical care whatsoever. . . I have still never been tested for \nCOVID-19.  (C.B. Decl. ¶ 6.)2 \nR.J. experienced COVID-19 symptoms in July 2020.  (R.J. Decl. ¶ 7.)  He submitted \n \n1Defendants claim to provide testing to “any inmate who requests same, any inmate \nwith signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and asymptomatic inmates with \nrecent known or suspected exposure to COVID-19.”  (Id.)   \n2 C.B. submitted a grievance asking for COVID-19 testing.  (C.B. Decl. ¶ 19.)  The \ngrievance was “pending” for a month, during which time C.B. submitted a request, \nasking for a response to the grievance.  (Id.)  C.B. received no response, and the \ngrievance later “disappeared from the kiosk.”  (Id.)   \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 6 of 28\nthree sick call requests but did not see a nurse for almost a month.  (Id.)  Regarding \ntesting, R.J. states: \nWhen I was called up to the medical wing, I told the nurse about my \nsymptoms, which were causing me a lot of discomfort and fear. The \nnurse took my temperature and blood pressure and told me that I was \n“good.” I asked her if I could be tested for COVID-19, but she told me \nI had to have a fever to be tested. She then sent me back to my cell. I \nhave never been tested for COVID-19.  (R.J. Decl. ¶ 7.) \n \nPlaintiff Singleton, F.S., A.W., J.H., L.P., P.B., and A.B. were also denied tests, \ndespite symptoms and/or exposure to infected people.3  Indeed, Defendants are \nfailing to follow the advice of their own medical director, who recommended testing \n“all new inmate[s] that are admitted to the jail.”4   \n3.  Detained  People  Still  Lack  Access  to  Useable  Masks, \nMinimally  Adequate  Quantities  of  Soap,  and  Cleaning \nSupplies. \n \na.  Masks \n \nDefendants  do  not  deny  that  they  failed  to  issue  most  detainees  facial \ncoverings, a critical prevention measure, for at least three months into the pandemic. \n \n3 See Singleton Decl. ¶ 10; F.S. Decl. ¶ 27; A.W. Decl. ¶¶ 40-44; J.H. Decl. ¶ 5; L.P. \nDecl. ¶ 7; P.B. Decl. ¶ 6; cf. A.B. Decl. ¶¶ 7-14 (describing unsuccessful efforts over \nthe course of four months to get COVID-19 test, without success as of September \n24, 2020).   \n4 See Exhibit C, Email from E. Smith, July 20, 2020 (stating that “[a]s an intervention \nto fight COVID-19, our medical director Dr. Clopton is recommending that we test \nall new inmate[s] that are admitted to the jail.”).  \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 7 of 28\n(Doc. 19-1 at 32; C.C. Decl. ¶ 22 (stating on June 25 that “[a]lmost no one has face \nmasks”); J.H. Decl. ¶ 26 (stating “many men in my dorm still did not have masks” \nas of June 19); G.R. Decl. ¶ 5 (“I received one cloth mask in mid-July.”).)  They are \nsilent  on  the  fact  that,  from  March  through  early  July,  elderly  and  medically \nvulnerable people in their jail resorted to tying bits of torn underwear and ripped \nsheets over their faces to protect themselves from a deadly virus. (See, e.g., Watkins \nDecl. ¶ 35; Jones Decl. ¶ 14; Mitchell Decl. ¶¶ 19-20; Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8.) \nDefendants ignore all of that and claim (with no reference to the date of \nalleged implementation) that “every inmate” is provided with two facemasks at \nintake, a washable mask and a disposable mask.  (Doc. 41 at 7-8.)  They state that if \na detainee loses her mask, another “will be provided for free.”  (Id. at 8.)  \nIt is true that more detainees have masks than did when this lawsuit was filed, \nsuch that elderly people and cancer patients are no longer walking around the jail \nwith underwear tied over their faces.  However, many detainees, such as J.J.L., still \nhave no mask.  (See J.J.L. Decl. ¶ 5; L.P. Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.)  Detainees do not receive \ntwo masks and replacements are not available.  (See id.)5   \n \n5 See also, e.g., R.J. Decl. ¶¶ 6, 15 (stating that he received one mask at intake in \nJuly, his mask is now soiled, he has asked for a replacement, “officers told me that \nthey  don’t  have  any  more  masks,”  and  his  grievance  asking  for  a  new  mask \n“disappeared” from the kiosk); C.B. Decl. ¶ 7 (stating that he received a mask in \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 8 of 28\n By way of further example, S.T. did not receive any mask when she entered \nthe jail in June and had none for weeks thereafter.  (S.T. Decl. ¶ 7.)  When F.B. \nentered the jail on August 7, he received a previously used, “threadbare,” cloth mask, \non which “the straps were loose and stretched out.”  (F.B. Decl. ¶ 4.)  F.B. asked \nseveral officers for a replacement without success.  (Id.)  W.G. is a 78-year-old man \narrested for a traffic offense, who spent four days in the jail in August and lacked a \nfunctional mask until the last day of his incarceration.  (W.G. Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  And \nP.B. states that as of September 17, three new arrivals in his dorm have no masks.  \n(P.B. Decl. ¶ 14.)    \nb.  Soap for Handwashing  \nAccording to Defendants’ “protocol,” all incarcerated persons “are provided \nmultiple  bars  of  soap  for  personal  use  and  additional  soap  is  available  for \nreplacement” free of charge.  (Doc. 41 at 7.)  In practice, detainees are allotted four \nounces of liquid soap (not “bars”) per week, which is an insufficient quantity for \nhandwashing, showering, and in-cell cleaning.  (J.H. Decl. ¶ 19; Watkins Decl. ¶ 15; \nA.W. Decl. ¶ 17; F.S. Decl. ¶ 14.)6  Contrary to Defendants’ claims, moreover (Doc. \n \nJune, has asked officers for a new mask multiple times, but has never received one). \n6 Many detainees must use their weekly soap allotment for in-cell cleaning and \nlaundry, in addition to personal hygiene. (Singleton Decl. ¶ 6; Watkins Decl. ¶ 15.)   \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 9 of 28\n41 at 7), detainees are not able to get additional soap when needed.7  Liquid soap at \nthe jail is strictly rationed, even as disease spreads.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶¶ 56-58.) \nc.  Cleaning Supplies and Sanitation \nDefendants claim that “each cell is cleaned and sanitized twice a day by the \ninmates in the cell.”  (Doc. 41 at 9.)  For this purpose, detainees allegedly receive “a \nbroom, a mop, and a bucket that contains OPTIM 1 and/or bleach.”  (Id.)  Trustees \nallegedly spray the toilet and sink twice a day with disinfectant solution.  (See id.)  \nHere again, the purported protocol does not operate in practice. \n•  C.B. cannot sanitize his cell twice a day because he lacks the supplies.  (C.B. \nDecl. ¶¶ 12-13.)  He has access once a day to a bucket of “black” water and a \nbroom.  (Id.)  He usually does not have enough personal soap for cell cleaning \nsince he must conserve it for showering and washing hands.  (Id. (“I have only \nseen a trustee spray my sink and toilet once in the past month.”).)  \n \n•  R.J. has “[a]t no time” been provided twice a day with a broom, mop, and \nbucket  with  cleaning  solution.    (R.J.  Decl.  ¶¶  10-11.)  Once  per  day,  he \nreceives a bucket of dirty water.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  Despite his requests for additional \ncleaning solution, the last time a trustee sprayed the toilet or sink was “at least \nsix weeks ago.”  (Id. ¶ 10-11)  \n•  S.T. receives a mop, broom, and bucket of dirty water about three times per \nweek,  not  twice  a  day.    (S.T.  Decl.  ¶  8.)    Cell  toilets  are  sprayed \n“infrequently.”  (Id.)   \n•  F.B. has access once a day to a mop and bucket filled with water that “quickly \n \n7 See also C.B. Decl. ¶ 15 (stating that the only way to get more than the allotted \namount of soap per week is to barter with a trustee or purchase it); R.J. Decl. ¶ 8 \n(stating that “detainees . . . certainly don’t get free replacement soap”). \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 10 of 28\nbecomes filthy and unusable.”  (F.B. Decl. ¶ 11.)  F.B. does not have access \nto cleaning chemicals.  (Id.)  He states: “I have asked officers for cleaning \nsupplies. The officers have told me to talk to the trustees, and the trustees have \ntold me that they are not allowed to share cleaning materials with us.” (Id.) \n \n4.  Several  of  Defendants’  Purported  Social  Distancing \nProtocols Are Not Implemented in Practice. \n \n  Defendants  claim  that  they  now  enforce  social  distancing,  including  by \ndistributing meals to each cell and requiring people to come out of cells for pill call \n“one by one and separate six feet apart.” (Doc. 41 at 10.)  As for court appearances, \nDefendants claim that detainees remain in their pods until their case is called, and \nthen move to a holding area for a Zoom hearing.  (Id. at 10-11.)   \nHere  again,  Defendants’  alleged  protocols  are  not  implemented.    In  a \ndeclaration dated September 17, 2020, F.B. reports that detained people still must \ncongregate in crowds of people to receive food and medication.  \nAt mealtime, everyone in my tier necessarily lines up close to one \nanother in order to get their food. If we don’t congregate in line to wait \nfor our food, the officers will wait until we are in line before they start \nto distribute food trays. At pill call, people who get medications have \nto line up again. Jail staff do not encourage us to maintain social \ndistancing at all.  (F.B. Decl. ¶ 8.) \n \nSimilarly, in a declaration dated September 18, 2020, R.J. states that “[i]t is not the \ncase that all meals are delivered to each detainee’s cell.”  (R.J. Decl. ¶ 13.)  Rather, \n“we all line up close together” to wait in line for food.  (Id.)  “There is no mention \nof social distancing from the officers or the trustee workers.”  (Id.)  The jail “does \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 11 of 28\nnot require, nor has it really attempted to implement social distancing at mealtimes \nor pill call.” (S.T. Decl. ¶ 9.)  Instead, people must line up or crowd around at \nmealtimes and pill call.  (Id.)  \nRegarding court hearings, video stills from a recent date in magistrate court \n(September 17) show twelve women (two of whom are in wheelchairs) crammed \ntogether in a hallway awaiting court.  (Ex. D, Screenshots from Court Appearances.)  \nA large crowd of men is visible in the background.  (Id.)  Consistent with Exhibit D, \nP.B., described recently being crowded into a small cell with nine other people and \nmade to wait three hours for his case to be called.  \nWhen we have a court appearance, we do not stay in our cells until our case \nis called. I went to court last Friday, September 11, 2020. I was taken to a \nsingle holding cell that is about 12 ft by 8 ft and was left there for over 3 hours \nwith about nine other people while we waited for our court appearances. \nDuring this time, I had no ability to maintain distance from the other people \nin the small cell. There were no efforts to allow for social distancing while we \nwaited to see the judge.  (P.B. Decl. ¶ 11.) \n \nB.  The  Jail’s  Undisputed  COVID-19  Data  Shows  an  Alarming \nCOVID-19 Positivity Rate at the Jail. \n \nThere is a COVID-19 outbreak at the Jail.8  Defendants cite data from May, \n \n8 See Supp. Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 5-7 (“[T]he infections at the Jail clearly meet the \ndefinition of an ongoing outbreak”); see also Exhibit E, Email from O. Adewale, \nDistrict Epidemiologist, Clayton County Health District, Georgia Department of \nPublic Health, Sept. 23, 2020 (“A confirmed case of COVID-19 in one or more \ninmates or staff is counted as an outbreak.”). \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 12 of 28\nJune, and July and conclude that “the number of positive cases in the CCJ has \nremained low and stable.”  (Doc. 41 at 15-16.)  Far from showing a “low” number \nof cases, the Defendants’ data shows a COVID-19 positivity rate of 27.1% in May, \n18.75% in June, and 27.2% in July.  (Id.)  In the medical community, such positivity \nrates “would not be reasonably characterized as ‘low.’”  (Supp. Fefferman Decl. ¶ \n8.) Instead, they show that “mitigation efforts have demonstrably failed to prevent \nongoing spread.”  (Id. ¶ 7.)9 \n \n9  With  their  response  brief,  Defendants  submitted  the  declaration  of  Edward \nSweeney, a purported corrections expert.  (Doc. 41-4.)  Though the declaration is \ncumulative of Defendants’ other evidence and plays a minimal role in Defendants’ \nresponse, Plaintiffs object to Sweeney’s declaration for two principal reasons.  First, \nthe declaration does not contain proper expert opinions based on his expertise and \nexperience, but instead consists largely of factual recitations (see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 11-16, \n18-20, 23-26, 42-44) legal conclusions (see, e.g., id. ¶¶ 7-8, 10), and impermissible \npersonal opinions and arguments about such matters as the true nature of “justice” \n(id. ¶¶ 27-31) and the appropriateness of “a federal injunction” (id. ¶ 35).  Courts \ngenerally hold this kind of expert testimony improper.  See, e.g., U.S. v. Frazier, 387 \nF.3d 1244, 1262-63 (11th Cir. 2004) (noting expert testimony generally unhelpful \nwhen it consists of “what lawyers for the parties can argue in closing arguments”); \nMontgomery v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 898 F.2d 1537, 1541 (11th Cir. 1990) \n(holding expert “may not testify to the legal implications of conduct”); Zurich Am. \nIns. Co. v. Hardin, No. 1:16-CV-2312, 2018 WL 5270356, at *3 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 14, \n2018) (noting “an expert must conduct an independent analysis when reviewing \nrecords” and “may not simply recite a witnesses’ testimony about the facts . . . and \nrefashion it as an expert opinion”).  Second, Sweeney’s opinions are not reliable \nbecause his declaration provides no indication about “how [his] experience leads to \nthe conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and \nhow that experience is reliably applied to the facts.”  See Addison v. Arnett, No. 2:13-\nCV-71, 2016 WL 1441803, at *4 (S.D. Ga. Apr. 22, 2016) (citation omitted); see id. \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 13 of 28\nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their Deliberate Indifference \nClaims. \nCOVID-19 presents an objectively serious risk to detainees.  See Swain v. \nJunior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir. 2020).  (Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Rottnek \nDecl. ¶¶ 25-27, 43-44.)  Defendants are aware of that risk but have failed to take \nreasonable steps to mitigate it.  As discussed above, Defendants regularly deny \ndetainees  access  to  testing,  leave  detainees  known  to  be  sick  with  COVID-19 \nsymptoms in their cells, fail to supply masks to all detainees, and deprive detainees \nof adequate cleaning and hygiene supplies.  These failures unreasonably expose \ndetainees to a serious risk of harm. \nDefendants do not dispute that the risk of harm is serious10 or that they are \n \n(“The  lack  of  analysis  in  [expert’s]  report  leads  the  Court  to  surmise  that  his \nconclusion  that  Defendants  ‘acted  properly  and  exercised  sound  correctional \njudgment’ is merely a personal opinion.”).     \n10 To the extent Defendants argue that COVID-19 does not pose “a substantial risk \nof serious harm” to the plaintiff class, they are incorrect.  See Swain, 961 F.3d at \n1285 (“Here, the defendants seem to agree—wisely, we think—that the risk of \nCOVID-19 satisfies this requirement.”); cf. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, \n35 (1993) (holding that “exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease” \nthat poses a risk of future harm is a sufficiently serious deprivation to invoke \nconstitutional protections). \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 14 of 28\naware of the obvious risk.11  They instead claim that they have addressed the known \nrisk by adopting a laundry list of “extraordinary” measures.12  (Doc. 41 at 22.)  As \ndiscussed above, however, many of those measures are not in place at the Jail, as \nreflected in sworn statements of numerous current and former detainees.   \nThe policies Defendants reference in their brief exist in word only and in \nsome cases are easily disproven by a YouTube search.  (Ex. D.)  At a minimum, \nDefendants clearly “could have, but did not, take steps to minimize” the risk to \ndetainees.  LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1537 (11th Cir. 1993).  Even if \nDefendants took some responsive action, they disregarded and continue to disregard \nsimple steps to prevent and mitigate the virus.13  See Hale v. Tallapoosa Cty., 50 \nF.3d 1579, 1584 (11th Cir. 1995) (holding sheriff, despite taking some steps, could \nbe deliberately indifferent for disregarding “‘alternative means’ or interim measures \n \n11 See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 842 (1994) (“[A] factfinder may conclude \nthat a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was \nobvious.”). \n12 Despite Defendants’ assertion that their actions were “prompt” (Doc. 41 at 1, 22), \nthe  attached  declarations  are  notable  for  the  absence  of  dates  on  which  these \nmeasures allegedly went into place (Doc. 41-1). \n13 The differences between Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir. 2020), and this \ncase are striking.  In Swain, the jailers’ efforts included purchasing air purifiers, \ninstalling industrial-grade sanitization equipment for disinfecting common areas, \nconducting  twice-daily  temperature  checks  of  detainees,  releasing  nearly  900 \ndetainees,  providing  sufficient  hygiene  products,  and  other  measures.   Id.  \nDefendants’ efforts are nothing like those deemed sufficient in Swain.  \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 15 of 28\nfor reducing the risk”).14  For example, Defendants do not promptly test, quarantine, \nor provide medical attention to individuals who report COVID-19 symptoms. See \nMandel v. Doe, 888 F.2d 783, 788 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding “intentional refusal to \nprovide [medical] care” is deliberate indifference).   Defendants even refuse to \nfollow their own medical director’s “highly suggested” recommendation that they \ntest all new arrivals to the Jail.  (Ex. C.)  These and numerous other failures to act \nare objectively unreasonable and constitute deliberate indifference,15 particularly in \nthe context of Defendants’ actions prior to this lawsuit.  LaMarca, 995 F.2d at 1542 \n \n14 Defendants erroneously argue that a “complete denial of [medical] treatment’ is \nthe only basis for establishing deliberate indifference.  (Doc. 41, at 22-23 & n.14.)  \nAs  suggested  above,  however,  jailers  cannot  disregard  reasonable  measures  to \nreduce a risk of serious harm to detainees.  Accordingly, “a decision to take an easier \nbut  less  efficacious  course  of  [medical]  treatment”  can  support  a  deliberate \nindifference claim.  Dimanche v. Brown, 783 F.3d 1204, 1215 (11th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir. 1999)). \n15 See, e.g., Carranza v. Reams, No. 20-CV-00977, 2020 WL 2320174, at *10 (D. \nColo. May 11, 2020) (jail detainees had shown a substantial likelihood of success \ndespite defendants having implemented several important and proactive steps to \naddress the spread of COVID-19); Criswell v. Boudreaux, No. 120-CV-01048, 2020 \nWL 5235675, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2020) (same); Gray v. Cty. of Riverside, No. \n5:13-CV-0444, 2020 WL 4243484, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 14, 2020) (same); Banks v. \nBooth, No. CV 20-849, 2020 WL 1914896, at *11 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2020) (same).  \nDefendants’ contrary authority generally involves substantial proactive measures \nnot in place at the Jail, either on paper or in practice.  See, e.g., Sanchez v. Brown, \nNo. 3:20-CV-00832, 2020 WL 2615931, at *7 (N.D. Tex. May 22, 2020) (use of \noutside  cleaners  instead  of  trustees  to  professionally  clean  potentially  infected \nareas); Money v. Pritzker, No. 20-CV-2093, 2020 WL 1820660, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Apr. \n10, 2020) (substantial reduction of detainee population).   \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 16 of 28\n(holding an “institution’s historical indifference” is relevant in assessing deliberate \nindifference).  Plaintiffs have presented substantial evidence that Defendants knew \nof and disregarded harmful jail conditions for months (Doc. 19-6; Doc. 19-11); that \nDefendants  failed  to  broadly  issue  masks  until  at  least  three  months  into  the \npandemic (Doc. 19-1 at 32; J.H. Decl. ¶ 26; G.R. Decl. ¶ 5); that Defendants cannot \nbe trusted to implement their own policies (see Ex. B, Declarations of Thirteen \nDetainees);  and  that  most  of  the  meager  changes  Defendants  have  made  only \noccurred after the lawsuit was filed (D.H. ¶ 36; G.R. Decl. ¶ 5; J.L. Decl. ¶ 7).   \nFinally, even if (contrary to the weight of the evidence) Defendants had \nimplemented the policy changes they allege, Plaintiffs would still be entitled to \ninjunctive relief because a defendant’s “voluntary cessation of challenged conduct \ndoes not ordinarily render a case moot.”  Knox v. Serv. Employees Int’l Union, 567 \nU.S. 298, 307 (2012).  To establish mootness, Defendants would have the “heavy \nburden” of showing that conditions in the Jail would not revert to what they were \nbefore this case was filed.  Rich v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 716 F.3d 525, 532 \n(11th Cir. 2013).  Here, Defendants have not demonstrated an unambiguous break \nfrom their old policies, nor have they shown that any policy changes resulted from \nsubstantial  deliberation  and  have  been  followed  consistently.    See  id.    Thus, \ninjunctive relief is warranted regardless of Defendants’ alleged policy changes. \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 17 of 28\nIn sum, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their deliberate \nindifference claim.16 \nB.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their Habeas Corpus Claims. \nDefendants argue that habeas is unavailable in this case “for several reasons” \nraised  in  their  motion  to  dismiss.17    (Doc.  41  at  28.)    Accordingly,  Plaintiffs \nincorporate by reference the pertinent section of their response to the motion to \ndismiss.  (Doc. 37 at 40-43.)18     \n \n16 In a footnote, Defendants contend that “the decisional law applicable to prison \ninmates  applies  equally  to  pretrial  detainees.”  (Doc.  41  at  17  n.12.)   They  are \nincorrect.  The Eleventh Circuit has declined to resolve whether, after Kingsley v. \nHendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 (2015), liability for the unconstitutional treatment of \npretrial  detainees  continues  to  require  a  showing  of  subjective  deliberate \nindifference.  Dang ex rel. Dang v. Sheriff, Seminole Cty., Fla., 871 F.3d 1272, 1279 \nn.2 (11th Cir. 2017) (“We cannot and need not reach this question.”).  The logic of \nKingsley—that  unreasonable  results  of  intentional  acts  constitute  punishment—\napplies equally to jail-conditions cases. \n17 Contrary to Defendants’ claim that habeas corpus relief is not available, several \ncourts have left open the availability of habeas corpus relief under the unique \ncircumstances presented in this case.  See, e.g., A.S.M. v. Donahue, No. 7:20-cv-62, \n2020 WL 1847158, at *1 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 10, 2020); Gayle v. Meade, No. 20-CV-\n21553, 2020 WL 1949737, at *26 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 22, 2020).  \n18 Defendants also argue that release is unavailable because Plaintiffs’ rights are not \nbeing violated (Doc. 41 at 25-26), and that “federalism concerns” and the “public \ninterest” weigh against release (id. at 26).  As discussed in this brief, Plaintiffs have \nestablished  likely  violations  of  their  rights  and  releasing  certain  detainees  will \npromote rather than harm the public interest. \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 18 of 28\nC.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their ADA and RA Claims. \nContrary to Defendants’ argument (Doc. 41 at 27), a disability discrimination \nclaim  under  the  ADA  and/or  the  Rehabilitation  Act  can  be  based  on  either  a \nconventional disparate treatment theory, or a theory that the defendant failed to make \nreasonable accommodations, or both.  Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, 544 F.3d \n1201, 1212 n.6 (11th Cir. 2008).  Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to \ncarry out their “affirmative duty to make reasonable accommodation to the known \nphysical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified [person].”  Nadler v. Harvey, \nNo. 06-12692, 2007 WL 2404705, at *4 (11th Cir. Aug. 24, 2007).  This “affirmative \nduty” includes making reasonable modifications to ensure people with disabilities19 \nhave equal access to the services, programs, and activities of the jail, including safe \nhousing, safe access to medical care, and safe adjudication of their criminal cases. \n28 C.F.R. §§ 35.130(a), (b)(2,), (b)(7)(i); see Fraihat v. U.S. Immigration & Customs \nEnf’t, 445 F. Supp. 3d 709, 748 (C.D. Cal. 2020) (disabled people in ICE detention \nentitled to reasonable accommodations in order to participate in the “programmatic \n‘benefit’” of the removal process).  Because it is an affirmative duty, Defendants’ \n \n19 Disability Subclass representatives are all people with disabilities protected under \nthe  ADA  and  Rehabilitation  Act.    Each  has  one  or  more  conditions  that \n“substantially impair” a “major life activity” or “major bodily function” as the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act require. 28 C.F.R. § 35.108. \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 19 of 28\nsuggestion that they only need to provide accommodations when explicitly requested \nmust be rejected.  See Nattiel v. Fla. Dep’t of Corr., No. 1:15-CV-150, 2017 WL \n5774143, at *1 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 28, 2017) (prison officials were aware of plaintiff’s \ndisabilities and therefore had a “duty to accommodate” even without a demand for \nan  accommodation);  Pierce,  128  F.  Supp.  3d  at  269  (finding  “untenable”  the \nargument that “prison officials have no legal obligation to provide accommodations \nfor  disabled  inmates  unless  the  inmate  specifically  requests  such  aid”).    Thus, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.20 \nII.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent an Injunction. \n \nThe  irreparable  injury  inquiry  turns  not  on  whether  COVID-19  poses  a \ndanger, which “it undoubtedly does.”  Swain, 961 F.3d at 1292.  Rather, the inquiry \nis whether Plaintiffs face a risk of irreparable harm absent an injunction.  Id. at 1293.  \n \n20  Plaintiffs  will  respond  by  September  30  to  the  Non-Final  Report  and \nRecommendation dismissing these claims.  (Doc. 52.)   The principal ground for the \nrecommended dismissal is that Plaintiffs failed to show disparate treatment and that \ndetainees with disabilities failed to request an accommodation.  (Doc. 52 at 35-6.)  \nThese conclusions are inconsistent with settled law.  See, e.g., Schwarz, 544 F.3d at \n1212 n.6; Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., 492 F.3d 1247, 1262 (11th Cir. 2007) \n(explaining that a public entity is not insulated from liability under the ADA by \ntreating  disabled  people  exactly  the  same  as  non-disabled  people  because \n“uniformly-applied, disability-neutral policies . . . would utterly eviscerate [the] \nADA requirement [of reasonable accommodations]”); Todd v. Carstarphen, 236 F. \nSupp. 3d 1311, 1328 n 33. (N.D. Ga. 2017) (recognizing that a specific demand for \nan accommodation is unnecessary where the need for one is obvious). \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 20 of 28\nHere, they undoubtedly do because Defendants’ pandemic response has been, and \nremains, insufficient and unreasonable. \n•  Defendants regularly leave symptomatic people in overcrowded cells, where \nsick people infect others.  (See Part A.1. supra.)  \n•  Defendants fail to provide tests to people who show COVID-19 symptoms.  \n(See Part A.2. supra.) \n•  Six months into the pandemic, Defendants still fail consistently to provide \ndetainees with facemasks and have no functioning system to replace and clean \nthem.  (See Part A.3.a. supra; L.P. Decl. ¶ 4; F.B. Decl. ¶ 4.) \n•  Defendants have failed to provide even minimally adequate cleaning supplies, \nsuch that detainees resort to using scraps of toilet paper, blankets, and their \npersonal allotment of body soap to clean their cells.  (See Part A.3.b-c. supra; \nSingleton Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6; M.B. Decl. ¶ 10; R.L. Decl. ¶ 19.) \n•  Defendants have failed even to provide detainees with utensils for eating, such \nthat  detainees  resort  to  the  unsanitary  practice  of  eating  foods  like  rice, \nnoodles, or eggs with their hands.  (A.J.W. Decl. ¶ 8; G.W. Decl. ¶ 10.) \n•  Defendants require detainees to congregate in close proximity during meal \ndistribution, pill call, and video court.  (See Part A.4. supra.)  Social distancing \nprotocols are still not enforced (see id.), and recent video evidence shows \ndetained people crammed together in crowded hallways (Ex. D).21  \n \n \n \n21 Though not directly relevant to the COVID-19 response, Defendants have failed \nto provide minimally adequate hygiene supplies, such that, for extended periods, \ndetained people lack basic items like toothbrushes (A.J.W. Decl. ¶ 9) (“I was unable \nto brush my teeth for a week.”), and feminine hygiene products (F.S. Decl. ¶ 15) \n(stating that she resorted to using a spare sheet as a sanitary napkin). \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 21 of 28\nDefendants’ insufficient response endangers all detainees, cf. Swain, 961 F.3d \nat 1293, but particularly those with health conditions that make them vulnerable to \nserious illness from COVID-19.22  Absent an injunction, there is an imminent risk \nthat more people will become infected.  Some may suffer permanent injury or die.   \nIf Defendants’ real-life mitigation plan mirrored that described in Defendants’ \nlegal briefs, and if there were a basis for believing Defendants would consistently \nfollow those policies going forward, an injunction might be unnecessary.  But \ndetainees credibly report that those policies are not being followed, and Defendants’ \nmisrepresentations regarding the existence of an outbreak (Doc. 19-1 at 15) and \nmisleading  description  of  jail  conditions  undermine  their  claim  that  sufficient \nmitigation strategies are in place.      \nDefendants  claim  that  there  is  no  irreparable  injury  because  the  named \nPlaintiffs have not been infected.  (Doc. 41 at 33.)  Even if that were true (it is not),23 \nPlaintiffs need only show that they face an “actual and imminent” risk of becoming \ninfected absent an injunction.  Swain, 961 F.3d at 1292.  They have met this burden.24 \n \n22 See, e.g., Supp. Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 2-3 (stating that he is 61 and has diabetes); M.B. \nDecl. ¶¶ 2, 12 (stating she is 52 and received chemotherapy for breast cancer); J.H. \nDecl. ¶¶ 2, 6 (stating that he is 51 and has hypertension). \n23 Three of the named Plaintiffs experienced COVID-19-like symptoms but were not \ntested.  (Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 37-41; Singleton Decl. ¶ 10; Mitchell Decl. ¶¶ 13-14.)   \n24 Swain does not compel a contrary result.  In Swain, a district court’s irreparable-\n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 22 of 28\nIII.  The Balance of Harms Favors Plaintiffs. \nCOVID-19 “unquestionably poses a serious threat” to jail detainees.  Swain, \n961 F.3d at 1293.  That risk is heightened for people in the Clayton County Jail.  Due \nto Defendants’ unreasonable acts and omissions, Plaintiffs and the nearly 2,000 \nputative  class  members  are  at  risk  of  contracting  COVID-19  and  experiencing \npreventable serious illness and death on a massive scale.  As a result, Defendants are \nviolating  Plaintiffs’  federal  rights,  and  “[c]ourts  may  not  allow  constitutional \nviolations to continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion into the \nrealm of prison administration.”  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011).   \nIn contrast to the serious threat to detainees, an injunction would pose no \nundue burden on Defendants’ legitimate interests.  The proposed injunction (Doc. \n19-15) would leave  Defendants with responsibility for formulating  “reasonably \nspecific and detailed written plans” in the first instance (id. ¶ 1).25  Similarly, the \n \nharm analysis was flawed because the court “opted not to resolve” certain factual \ndisputes regarding defendants’ alleged protective measures.  Swain, 961 F.3d at \n1293.  Here, there is substantial evidence in the record regarding the inadequacy of \nDefendants’  COVID-19  response,  much  of  it  undisputed,  whereas  Defendants’ \nsubmissions are unpersuasive and, in some instances, demonstrably false. \n25 See Thomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1323 (11th Cir. 2010) (approving of seeking \nproposed remedial plans from prison officials before entering injunction); LaMarca, \n995 F.2d at 1543 (approving of injunction terms “to ensure that [certain] specific \npolicies were carried out [by prison staff]” as opposed to “the methods by which \n[prison officials] effectuated these policies”).   \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 23 of 28\nproposed order would not necessarily result in release of detainees but would require \nonly preliminary steps to “aid the Court’s evaluation of whether release and/or \nenlargement is appropriate” (id. ¶¶ 6, 8-9) and a plan by Defendants to review (but \nnot necessarily discharge) detainees eligible for discretionary release (id. ¶ 7).   \nDefendants  argue  that  an  injunction  would  interfere  with  the  Sheriff’s \n“flexibility” by “order[ing] the Sheriff to conform to standards on the day of entry” \nof  the  injunction.    (Doc.  41  at  36.)    As  noted  above,  however,  the  proposed \npreliminary injunction allows Defendants to identify areas in which flexibility is \nneeded.26    Thus, an injunction will not improperly restrain Defendants’ flexibility \nbut will merely keep it within constitutional bounds.  Plata, 653 U.S. at 511 (“If \ngovernment fails to fulfill this obligation [to provide for prisoners’ basic needs], the \ncourts have a responsibility to remedy the resulting Eighth Amendment violation.”).     \nIV.  An Injunction Will Serve the Public Interest. \nIt is well established that “the public interest is served when constitutional \nrights are protected.”  Jones v. Governor, 950 F.3d 795, 830 (11th Cir. 2020) \n \n26 Similarly, if an unforeseen problem arises after an injunction issues, the “settled \nrule” is that “district courts retain power to modify injunctions in light of changed \ncircumstances.”  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 492 (1965); see Plata, 563 \nU.S. at 542 (stating in prison-conditions case that district courts should “remain open \nto a showing or demonstration by either party that the injunction should be altered”). \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 24 of 28\n(quoting Democratic Exec. Comm. v. Lee, 915 F.3d 1312, 1327 (11th Cir. 2019)).  \nThat rule applies with particular force here, as “the integrity of the criminal justice \nsystem depends on full compliance” with the proscription against cruel and unusual \nconditions of confinement.  Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 511 (2005).   \nDefendants argue that a preliminary injunction would disserve the public \ninterest because it would require “immediate release” of detainees, certain detainees \nmay not “be able to protect themselves any better” outside of the Jail, and releasing \ndetainees would allegedly pose a “risk of danger to the public” because they have \n“committed or allegedly committed a  myriad of crimes.”   (Doc. 41 at 37-38.)  \nPlaintiffs’ proposed injunction does not ask for “immediate release,” but provides \nfor release “where appropriate” and only if Defendants fail to “ensure that each \ndetainee no longer faces an unreasonable risk of injury or death.”  (Doc. 19-15 ¶ 5.)  \nIn all events, releasing detainees will not harm the public interest.27  Defendants’ \nsuggestion that detainees may not be able to “provide for their food and medical care \nneeds” or “protect themselves any better” from COVID-19 (Doc. 41 at 37) are \n \n27 See, e.g., Savino v. Souza, No. 20-CV-10617, 2020 WL 2404923, at *1 (D. Mass \nMay 12, 2020) (“[T]his injunction does not prohibit the government’s (and the \npublic’s) [interest in] confining those who are dangerous or flight risks. Yet, to the \nextent it reduces the risk of an uncontainable outbreak in the facility, the injunction \nsecures the safety of the detainees, the guards and other staff, their families, and \nultimately the public at large.”). \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 57   Filed 09/24/20   Page 25 of 28\nwholly speculative, and are factors that the Court could consider in determining \nwhether  to  release  a  particular  detainee.    Irrespective  of  whatever  hardships \ndetainees might face in the community, they would not be confined to a mismanaged \n“incubator[] for the coronavirus.”  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 15.)  Coreas v. Bounds, No. 20-\nCV-780, 2020 WL 1663133, at *6 (D. Md. Apr. 3, 2020) (noting “the absurdity of \nthe claim that someone will be safer from a contagious disease while confined in \nclose quarters with dozens of other detainees and staff than while at liberty”). \nWith  respect  to  public-safety  concerns,  the  proposed  order  provides  for \nidentifying detainees deemed “unsuitable for release under any circumstances.”  \n(Doc. 19-15 ¶¶ 8-9.)  If the Court finds it necessary to order the release of certain \ndetainees,  it  may  consider  public-safety  concerns  when  making  individualized \nrelease decisions.  Thus, a preliminary injunction would not harm the public interest. \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Jeremy Cutting       \nKosha S.

Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Subclass: All individuals in the \nClayton County Jail, who are not under a sentence of \nimprisonment, whose age or medical conditions make them \nsusceptible to serious illness or death if they contract COVID-19, \nspecifically, people aged 55 or older, or people who have been \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 6\ndiagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for the following \nconditions: asthma (moderate to severe); cerebrovascular disease; \nchronic kidney disease; COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease); cystic fibrosis; diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2); serious \nheart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or \ncardiomyopathies); hypertension; immunocompromised state \n(from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, \nimmune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other \nimmune weakening medicines); liver disease; neurologic \nconditions (such as dementia); obesity (body mass index [BMI] of \n30 or higher); pregnancy; pulmonary fibrosis; sickle cell disease; \nthalassemia. \n \nb.

Defendants have failed to respond to the urgent \nthreat posed to people confined in the Jail by this growing pandemic, making it \nimpossible for these individuals to observe the precautionary steps necessary to \nkeep themselves safe, such as social distancing, increased personal hygiene, \nsanitizing one’s environment, access to testing, and wearing protective clothing. \nDefendants’ disregard of the known risks of illness and death exposes jail \ndetainees to a highly fatal, infectious disease in violation of their rights under the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as federal disability rights laws.  \nPlaintiffs are people incarcerated at the Clayton County Jail under conditions \nthat put them at high risk of becoming victims of the COVID-19 global pandemic. \nWhile several counties in Georgia have undertaken measures to reduce their jail \npopulations in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, Clayton County has thus \nfar refused to take meaningful action to address the risks posed by COVID-19 and \nhas failed to implement adequate, systemwide measures to protect incarcerated \nindividuals.  This puts the Plaintiffs and the classes they seek to represent in mortal \njeopardy, and also endangers the larger community in light of the daily movement \n1\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 7 of 33\nof both detainees and staff in and out of the Clayton County Jail. \nOn behalf of themselves and similarly situated persons, Plaintiffs challenge \nthese unconstitutional conditions and now move for class certification under \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b). \nPROPOSED CLASSES \nPlaintiffs seek to certify two principal classes and four subclasses defined as \nfollows:  \n1.  Principal Pretrial Class: All persons who are now or will in the \nfuture be confined in the Clayton County Jail who are not also being \nconfined under a sentence of imprisonment. \n \na.  Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Subclass: All individuals in the \nClayton County Jail, who are not under a sentence of \nimprisonment, whose age or medical conditions make them \nsusceptible to serious illness or death if they contract COVID-19, \nspecifically, people aged 55 or older, or people who have been \ndiagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for the following \nconditions: asthma (moderate to severe); cerebrovascular disease; \nchronic kidney disease; COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease); cystic fibrosis; diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2); serious \nheart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or \ncardiomyopathies); hypertension; immunocompromised state \n(from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, \nimmune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other \nimmune weakening medicines); liver disease; neurologic \nconditions (such as dementia); obesity (body mass index [BMI] of \n30 or higher); pregnancy; pulmonary fibrosis; sickle cell disease; \nthalassemia. \n \nb.  Disability Pretrial Subclass: All individuals in the Clayton \nCounty Jail who have not been sentenced to imprisonment and \n2\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 8 of 33\nwhose medical conditions make them susceptible to serious illness \nor death if they contract COVID-19, specifically, people who have \nbeen diagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for a medical \ncondition which would qualify as a disability under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  The subclass \nincludes people with any of the conditions listed in the preceding \nparagraph, except those who are medically vulnerable solely \nbecause of age, pregnancy, or BMI.   \n \n2.  Principal Post-Adjudication Class: All persons who are now or will \nin the future be confined in the Clayton County Jail under sentence of \nimprisonment. \n \na.  Medically Vulnerable Post-Adjudication Subclass: All \nindividuals in the Clayton County Jail, who are under a sentence of \nimprisonment, whose age or medical conditions make them \nsusceptible to serious illness or death if they contract COVID-19, \nspecifically, people aged 55 or older, or people who have been \ndiagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for the following \nconditions: asthma (moderate to severe); cerebrovascular disease; \nchronic kidney disease; COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease); cystic fibrosis; diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2); serious \nheart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or \ncardiomyopathies); hypertension; immunocompromised state \n(from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, \nimmune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other \nimmune weakening medicines); liver disease; neurologic \nconditions (such as dementia); obesity (body mass index [BMI] of \n30 or higher); pregnancy; pulmonary fibrosis; sickle cell disease; \nthalassemia.   \n \nb.  Disability Post-Adjudication Subclass: All individuals in the \nClayton County Jail who have been sentenced to imprisonment and \nwhose medical conditions make them susceptible to serious illness \nor death if they contract COVID-19, specifically, people who have \nbeen diagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for a medical \ncondition which would qualify as a disability under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  The subclass \n3\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 9 of 33\nincludes people with any of the conditions listed in the preceding \nparagraph, except those who are medically vulnerable solely \nbecause of age, pregnancy, or BMI. \n \n  Plaintiffs seek two forms of relief to reduce the risk of harm to acceptable \nlevels.  First, on behalf of people who remain in the jail, Plaintiffs seek injunctive \nrelief requiring Defendants to implement reasonable measures to reduce the risk of \nCOVID-19 transmission such as promoting social distancing; ensuring adequate \nsanitation in cells and common areas; issuing effective personal protective \nequipment; providing timely and adequate medical care, screening, and testing; \nand quarantining and isolating suspected or known infected people in accordance \nwith generally accepted medical norms.  Second, to protect at-risk populations and \nfacilitate mitigation efforts for those who remain in the jail, Plaintiffs seek \nimmediate release or transfer for medically vulnerable and disabled individuals \nbeing held in the Clayton County Jail, pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus or an \ninjunction. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Defendants’ Inadequate Policies and Practices to Combat \nCOVID-19 Pose a Substantial Risk of Serious Harm to All \nClayton County Jail Detainees. \n \nGeorgia and the nation are in the midst of the most significant global \npandemic in generations.  COVID-19 is a highly contagious and deadly respiratory \n4\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 10 of 33\ndisease that poses grave health risks in serious cases, particularly to medically \nvulnerable people.  (Doc. 1).  Jails pose a heightened risk for the spread of COVID-\n19. 1  There is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19. 2  The best course according to \npublic health experts is to slow and prevent transmission, primarily through “social \ndistancing.”3  This measure is particularly important because the virus spreads \naggressively, and people can infect others even if they do not feel sick or exhibit \nany symptoms.4   \nThe CDC has issued guidance about the prevention of COVID-19 specific to \ncorrectional and detention facilities.5  This guidance describes how to properly \nquarantine, isolate, and care for persons suspected or known to be positive for \nCOVID-19 and their close contacts.  It calls for many straightforward, easily \n \n1 Ga.

Defendants’ failures endanger \nnot only all those within the institution, but the entire community.  The only \nmeasures that will reasonably reduce the risk of harm are to swiftly release the \npeople most vulnerable to the disease and implement disease-prevention measures \nfor those who remain in the Jail. \nB.  The Named Plaintiffs Are Being Subjected to Defendants’ \nUnlawful Policies and Practices. \n \nThe four named plaintiffs are all currently incarcerated at the Clayton \nCounty Jail.  \nRhonda Jones is a 58-year-old African-American woman.  She is detained \npretrial and seeks to represent the pretrial classes and subclasses.  Ms. Jones has \nbeen confined to the Clayton County Jail since April 9, 2020, for a charge of \naggravated assault.  A $10,000 bond was set in her case, but she cannot afford it. \n6\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 12 of 33\nShe has been hospitalized twice in the past year for pneumonia.  Ms. Jones is \nsusceptible to serious injury or death if she contracts COVID-19. \nRandolph Mitchell is a 72-year-old African-American man.  He has been \nconfined to the Clayton County Jail since August 9, 2019.  He has less than two \nmonths left to serve on a 12-month sentence for simple battery, a misdemeanor, \nand seeks to represent the post-adjudication class and subclasses.  He has been \ndiagnosed with high blood pressure and a heart condition.  Mr. Mitchell is \nsusceptible to serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-19.  \nBarry Watkins is a 60-year-old Caucasian man.  He is detained pretrial and \nseeks to represent the pretrial classes and subclasses.  Mr. Watkins has been \nconfined to the Clayton County Jail since August 31, 2018, for a charge of theft by \ndeception.  A $5,500 bond was set in his case, but he cannot afford it. He has Type \n1 diabetes that requires a controlled diet and regular insulin injections.  Mr. \nWatkins is susceptible to serious injury or death if he contracts COVID-19. \nMichael Singleton is a 59-year-old African-American man.  He has been \nconfined to the Clayton County Jail since February 17, 2020.  He is serving a one-\nyear sentence for a violation of probation and seeks to represent the post-\nadjudication class and subclasses.  Mr. Singleton has been diagnosed with high \n7\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 13 of 33\nblood pressure and is susceptible to serious illness or death if he contracts COVID-\n19.  \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief, and the Medically Vulnerable and \nDisability Subclasses’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arise from Defendants’ \nfailure to protect all detainees from the severe risk of death or serious physical \nharm from COVID-19.  All proposed class members challenge Defendants’ \ncommon failure to adequately protect all six classes from COVID-19 infection. \nAnd while the immediate habeas relief sought by the Medically Vulnerable and \nDisability Subclasses does not run to all class members, it would provide benefits \nnot only to those subclasses, but to the class as a whole: it is only with a significant \npopulation reduction that the Jail will be able to successfully implement the public \nhealth measures needed to prevent harm to the other class members.  Therefore, the \nCourt should certify the Principal Pretrial and Post-Adjudication Classes and their \ncorresponding Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses. \nA plaintiff seeking class certification must satisfy each of the requirements \nof Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and at least one of the three \ncriteria for certification under Rule 23(b).

Co., 323 F.R.D. 411, 415 (N.D. \n8\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 14 of 33\nGa. 2017); Campos v. ChoicePoint, Inc., 237 F.R.D. 478, 484 (N.D. Ga. 2006).  \n“Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the \ncertification stage.”  Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455, \n466 (2013).  “Merits questions may be considered to the extent—but only to the \nextent—that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for \nclass certification are satisfied.”  Id. \nClass certification must be addressed “[a]t an early practicable time” after \nthe complaint is filed.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A).  In cases where the propriety of \nclass certification is clear from the complaint—as often it is in civil rights actions \nlike the present one—it is appropriate to rule on class certification at the pleading \nstage.  See General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982); see, \ne.g., Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1253 n.6 (11th Cir. 2004) (“[W]e will \nbase our class certification ruling on the Third Complaint.”); see also Mills v. \nForemost Ins. Co., 511 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir. 2008) (“In some instances, the \npropriety vel non of class certification can be gleaned from the face of the \npleadings.”); Huff v. N.D. Cass Co of Ala., 485 F.2d 710, 713 (5th Cir. 1973).  One \nreason for permitting an early class certification decision is that an order granting \nclass certification is “always provisional in nature” and thus may be amended or \n9\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 15 of 33\nvacated in light of later developments in a case.  Carriuolo v. General Motors Co., \n823 F.3d 977, 988 (11th Cir. 2016); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C).   \nThe propriety of class certification in this case is clear from the face of \nPlaintiffs’ complaint and declarations, and the material facts concerning class \ncertification—including the impracticability of joinder and the similar conditions \nunder which all detainees live—can be readily determined based on incontestable \nfacts about the jail’s population and the uniformity of Defendants’ policies \nthroughout the jail’s housing units.  As discussed below, the hundreds of members \nof the six proposed classes cannot practicably be joined individually in a single \naction, and the answers to the questions of law and fact at issue in this case will \ndetermine, with respect to each Plaintiff and class member, whether the policies \nand practices applied to them violate federal law.  Likewise, Defendants’ unlawful \nacts apply to every member of the classes, such that the requested final declaratory \nand injunctive relief is appropriate for the class as a whole. The Court should grant \nPlaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  \nI.  The Proposed Classes Meet the Requirements of Rule 23(a). \n \nA plaintiff seeking class certification must meet four requirements under \nRule 23(a): (1) the class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable; (2) there must be questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) \n10\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 16 of 33\nthe claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties must be able to fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  For the reasons \ndiscussed below, these prerequisites are easily satisfied in this case. \nA.  The Proposed Classes Are So Numerous That Joinder Would Be \nImpracticable. \n \nThe first requirement of Rule 23(a) is “that a class be so numerous that \njoinder of all members is impracticable.”  Owens, 323 F.R.D. at 411 (citing Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a)(1)).  In determining numerosity, “[t]he proper focus is not on \nnumbers alone, but on whether joinder of all members is practicable in view of the \nnumerosity of the class and all other relevant factors.”  Phillips v. Joint Legis. \nComm. on Performance and Expenditure Review, 637 F.2d 1014, 1022 (5th Cir. \n1981).  A district court is permitted to make “common sense assumptions” in \nassessing numerosity.  Campos v. ChoicePoint, Inc., 237 F.R.D. 478, 485 (N.D. \nGa. 2006) (quoting Evans v. U.S. Pipe & Foundry, 696 F.2d 925, 930 (11th \nCir.1983)).  “As a general rule in the Eleventh Circuit, a prospective class with \nmore than forty members is deemed to satisfy the numerosity requirement.” \nOwens, 323 F.R.D. at 417 (citing Cox v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546, \n1553 (11th Cir. 1986)).  In addition, “‘the fluid nature of a plaintiff class—as in the \nprison-litigation context—counsels in favor of certification of all present and \n11\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 17 of 33\nfuture members.’”  Braggs v. Dunn, 317 F.R.D. 634, 653 (M.D. Ala. 2016) \n(quoting Henderson v. Thomas, 289 F.R.D. 506, 510 (M.D. Ala. 2012)).  Courts \nhave recognized in cases seeking injunctive relief that it is “certainly \nimpracticable” to join “unnamed, unknown” individuals who will in the future be, \nbut are not yet, subjected to the wrongful conduct to be enjoined.  Jack v. Am. \nLinen Supply Co., 498 F.2d 122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974); see, e.g., Kilgo v. Bowman \nTransp., Inc., 789 F.2d 859, 878 (11th Cir. 1986) (finding joinder impracticable \nwhere future class members could not yet be identified); Johnson v. Montgomery \nCty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 99 F.R.D. 562, 565 (M.D. Ala. 1983) (“[W]hen a putative \nclass includes future applicants and employees, as in the present case, joinder is \nimpossible.”). \nThe proposed classes easily satisfy the numerosity requirement.  Plaintiffs \nJones and Watkins seek relief on behalf of a Principal Pretrial Class consisting of \nall people who are or will be detained at the Jail who are not under a sentence of \nimprisonment—a class consisting of approximately half of the Jail’s detainee \npopulation as well as an unknown number of future members.6  Similarly, the \nPrincipal Post-Adjudication Class, for whom Plaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton seek \n \n6 See Ga. Dep’t of Community Affairs, County Jail Inmate Population Report 8 (May \n2020), https://bit.ly/2Zp7OQv. \n12\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 18 of 33\nrelief, consists of all people who are or will be detained at the Jail under sentence \nof imprisonment; that class includes approximately 40 percent of the Jail’s \npopulation.7  The Clayton County Jail has a current population of over 1,800 \ndetainees and will hold an indeterminate number of future detainees, making \njoinder of all members of the two Principal Classes impracticable.  Regarding the \nMedically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses, the April report compiled by the \nClayton County Jail’s medical provider identified 739 detainees as “chronic care \npatients” for that month alone.  A significant percentage of these patients are \nexpected to be members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses. \nMoreover, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2), Plaintiffs request that the Court \ntake judicial notice that people in jails generally have high rates of disability and \nchronic illness, meaning that a significant percentage of the jail’s population can be \nexpected to include members of the Disability Subclass, the Medically Vulnerable \nSubclass, or both.8 Because the proposed classes can be expected to include well \n  \nover forty current members, they satisfy the numerosity requirement.  See Owens, \n323 F.R.D. at 417. \n \n7 Id. \n8 Bureau of Justice Statistics, Disabilities Among Prison and Jail Inmates, 2011-12 \n1 (Dec. 2015), https://bit.ly/31wTkRp (estimating that approximately 40 percent of \njail detainees were currently experiencing a chronic health condition).                                   \n13\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 19 of 33\nThe numerosity requirement is also met because, regardless of the number of \ncurrent class members, joinder is impracticable with respect to future members of \neach class.  The members of the six classes include both individuals currently \nincarcerated and those individuals who may be incarcerated in the coming weeks \nand months as COVID-19 continues to spread.  Because the classes include \nindividuals who will suffer the same injury in the future, traditional joinder is \nparticularly difficult.  See Newberg on Class Actions § 25:4 (4th ed.) (“Even a \nsmall class of fewer than 10 actual members may be upheld if an indeterminate \nnumber of individuals are likely to become class members in the future or if the \nidentity or location of many class members is unknown for good cause.”);  Kilgo, \n789 F.2d at 878 (finding impracticability of non-class joinder for a class including \nfuture members, who necessarily could not yet be identified).  \nB.  There Are Issues of Law and Fact Common to the Classes. \n \nThe second Rule 23(a) requirement is that “there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  This requirement is met if there is \n“at least one issue whose resolution will affect all or a significant number of the \nputative class members.”  Williams v. Mohawk Industries, 568 F.3d 1350, 1355 \n(11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Stewart v. Winter, 669 F.2d 328, 335 (5th Cir.1982)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The touchstone of commonality is whether \n14\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 20 of 33\ndisputed legal or factual questions are capable of class-wide proof or resolution. \nMurray v. Auslander, 244 F.3d 807, 811 (11th Cir. 2001).  Claims need not be \nidentical to satisfy this requirement, and variations within the class are permissible. \nPrado-Steiman v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1279 n.14 (11th Cir. 2000).  Likewise, a \nplaintiff “need not show that common questions ‘predominate’ over individual \nquestions,” because “even a single common question” will satisfy the commonality \nrequirement.  See Braggs, 317 F.R.D. at 655 (quoting Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 359 (2011)).  \nAlthough there need only be a single common issue of law or fact under \nRule 23(a), each of the six classes and subclasses presents numerous common \nissues of both law and fact.9  For each class and subclass, common questions \ninclude: \n•  Principal Pretrial Class: \no  Common questions of fact include whether the class \nmembers’ living conditions increase their risk of COVID-19 \ninfections.   \n \n9 The commonality requirement is met where, as here, plaintiffs challenge commonly \napplicable conditions and procedures in correctional facilities.  See, e.g., Parsons v. \nRyan, 754 F.3d 657, 681 (9th Cir. 2014) (collecting cases, finding commonality is \nsatisfied where the lawsuit challenges “systemic policies and practices that allegedly \nexpose inmates to a substantial risk of harm,” even where there are “individual \nfactual differences among class members”); see also Postawko v. Mo. Dep’t of Corr., \n910 F.3d 1030, 1038–39 (8th Cir. 2018) (similar); Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, \n363 (5th Cir. 2017) (similar). \n15\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 21 of 33\no  Common questions of law include whether Defendants’ \nfailures to ensure adequate social distancing, sanitation, and \npersonal hygiene present a substantial risk of serious harm; \nwhether Defendants have responded reasonably to the risk \nof harm created by conditions at the Clayton County Jail; \nand whether Defendants have violated the class members’ \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process \nClause.  \n•  Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Subclass: \no  Common questions of fact include whether the class \nmembers’ living conditions and preexisting medical \nconditions increase their risk of COVID-19 infections.   \no  Common questions of law include whether Defendants’ \nfailures to ensure adequate social distancing, sanitation, and \npersonal hygiene present a substantial risk of serious harm; \nwhether Defendants have responded reasonably to the risk \nof harm created by conditions at the Clayton County Jail; \nand whether Defendants have violated the class members’ \nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process \nClause.   \n•  Disability Pretrial Subclass: \no  Common questions of fact include whether the class members’ \nliving conditions and disabilities, as defined under federal \ndisability rights laws, increase their risk of COVID-19 infections. \no  Common questions of law include whether Defendants have \nprevented the class members from benefiting from programs, \nservices, and activities on account of their disabilities; whether \nDefendants have failed to provide reasonable accommodations for \nthe class members’ disabilities; and whether Defendants have \nviolated the class members’ rights under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act. \n•  Principal Post-Adjudication Class:  \n16\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 22 of 33\no  Common questions of fact include whether the class \nmembers’ living conditions increase their risk of COVID-19 \ninfections. \no  Common questions of law include whether Defendants’ \nfailures to ensure adequate social distancing, sanitation, and \npersonal hygiene present a substantial risk of serious harm; \nwhether Defendants have responded reasonably to the risk \nof harm created by conditions at the Clayton County Jail; \nand whether Defendants have violated the class members’ \nrights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n•  Medically Vulnerable Post-Adjudication Subclass: \no  Common questions of fact include whether the class \nmembers’ living conditions and preexisting medical \nconditions increase their risk of COVID-19 infections. \no  Common questions of law include whether Defendants’ \nfailures to ensure adequate social distancing, sanitation, and \npersonal hygiene present a substantial risk of serious harm; \nwhether Defendants have responded reasonably to the risk \nof harm created by conditions at the Clayton County Jail; \nand whether Defendants have violated the class members’ \nrights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.   \n•  Disability Post-Adjudication Subclass: \no  Common questions of fact include whether the class members’ \nliving conditions and disabilities, as defined under federal \ndisability rights laws, increase their risk of COVID-19 infections. \no  Common questions of law include whether Defendants have \nprevented the class members from benefiting from programs, \nservices, and activities on account of their disabilities; whether \nDefendants have failed to provide reasonable accommodations for \nthe class members’ disabilities; and whether Defendants have \nviolated the class members’ rights under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act. \n \n17\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 23 of 33\nThe common questions of fact and law listed above are those necessary to \ndetermine the Defendants’ liability with respect to all current and future people in \ntheir custody who are subject to the challenged policies and practices of the \nClayton County Jail.  Therefore, there are factual and legal questions in this case \nwhose resolution will advance the legal claims of all class members.  See Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 349–50 (explaining that it is not just the existence of \nhypothetical common questions that justify class treatment but common answers \nthat resolve the factual or legal claims presented by the plaintiffs).  \nC.  The Proposed Class Representatives’ Claims Are Typical of Those \nof the Classes. \n \nRule 23(a)’s typicality requirement ensures that “the claims or defenses of \nthe representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  “A class representative must possess the same interest and \nsuffer the same injury as the class members in order to be typical under Rule \n23(a)(3).”  Murray, 244 F.3d at 811.  “Typicality, however, does not require \nidentical claims or defenses.”  Kornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, 741 F.2d 1332, \n1337 (11th Cir. 1984).  Rather, it “measures whether a sufficient nexus exists \nbetween the claims of the named representatives and those of the class at large.” \nPrado-Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1279.  “A sufficient nexus is established if the claims \nor defenses of the class and the class representative arise from the same event or \n18\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 24 of 33\npattern or practice and are based on the same legal theory.”  Kornberg, 741 F.2d at \n1337.  As long as the claims of the named plaintiffs and the class members arise \nfrom the same practice and the same underlying legal theory, the typicality \nrequirement is satisfied even if there is some “factual variation” in how the practice \napplies to the named plaintiffs and the class members.  Owens, 323 F.R.D. at 418 \n(quoting Kornberg, 741 F.2d at 1337).  \n  Here, the named Plaintiffs’ legal claims are the same as the legal claims of \nthe other members of the proposed classes they represent.  The Plaintiffs and class \nmembers they represent are all injured in the same way: Defendants are \nincarcerating them in conditions of confinement that put them at substantial risk of \nserious harm.  For the subclasses, each person claims that they must be released \nbecause their health is at imminent and immediate risk from the same virus and \nsame policy failures as each other person in the subclasses.  Thus, the ongoing and \nfuture injury of the classes and the class representatives arise from the same policy \nand practice.  See Newberg on Class Actions § 23:4 (4th ed.) (“[T]he typicality \nrequirement is generally satisfied when the representative plaintiff is subject to the \nsame statute, regulation, or policy as class members.”).  The claims of the named \nPlaintiffs also rely on the same legal theories as the claims of all other class \nmembers concerning whether Defendants’ deliberate indifference to the risk of \n19\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 25 of 33\nserious harm is unconstitutional.  See Murray, 244 F.3d at 811 (“The typicality \nrequirement may be satisfied despite substantial factual differences . . . when there \nis a ‘strong similarity of legal theories.’” (citation omitted).  The proof concerning \nwhether Defendants have acted with deliberate indifference in the face of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the legal argument about whether this inaction is \nunlawful are critical for each class and subclass member in this case to establish \nthe liability of Defendants.  Plaintiffs therefore satisfy the typicality requirement. \nSee Braggs, 317 F.R.D. at 663-64. \nD.  The Proposed Class Representatives and Class Counsel Can \nAdequately Represent the Classes. \n \nAs class representatives in this case, named Plaintiffs will “fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  The \nadequacy analysis involves “two separate inquiries: (1) whether any substantial \nconflicts of interest exist between the representatives and the class; and (2) whether \nthe representatives will adequately prosecute the action.”  Valley Drug Co. v. \nGeneva Pharm., Inc., 350 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). \nRegarding the first inquiry, the named Plaintiffs are adequate representatives \nof the classes they represent because their interests in the vindication of the legal \nclaims that they raise are completely aligned with, and are not antagonistic to, the \ninterests of the other class members.  The named Plaintiffs, like other class \n20\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 26 of 33\nmembers, have a strong interest in no longer being detained in unsafe and possibly \nlethal conditions.  The named Plaintiffs who represent the Medically Vulnerable \nand Disability Subclasses share the subclasses’ interest in release because of the \nparticular danger that the virus presents for them.  There are no known conflicts of \ninterest among members of the proposed classes, all of whom have a similar \ninterest in vindicating their constitutional and statutory rights in the face of their \nunlawful treatment by Defendants.  Moreover, the declaratory and injunctive relief \nsought by the named Plaintiffs will benefit the entire class. \nRegarding the second inquiry, the named Plaintiffs also meet the \nrequirement that they will adequately prosecute the action.  They are represented in \nthis case by experienced civil rights attorneys who are able and willing to conduct \nthis litigation on behalf of the class.  Plaintiffs’ counsel from the ACLU, the \nACLU of Georgia, and the Southern Center for Human Rights collectively have \nextensive experience litigating complex class action cases and civil rights cases on \nbehalf of incarcerated and detained people.10  Plaintiffs thus satisfy Rule 23(a)(4)’s \nadequacy requirement. \n \n10 For example, ACLU attorney David C. Fathi is Director of the ACLU National \nPrison Project, which brings challenges to conditions of confinement in prisons, \njails, and other detention facilities.  For almost 25 years he has devoted his legal \npractice exclusively to class actions on behalf of incarcerated persons, serving as \n \n21\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 27 of 33\nII.  The Proposed Classes Meet the Requirements of Rule 23(b). \n \nThis action qualifies for class certification under both Rule 23(b)(1) and \nRule 23(b)(2).  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 361–62 (“Classes certified under (b)(1) \nand (b)(2) share the most traditional justifications for class treatment—that \nindividual adjudications would be impossible or unworkable, as in a (b)(1) class, or \n \nlead counsel or co-counsel in cases including Parsons v.

Supp. \n2d 131 (D.R.I. 2006); and Austin v. Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, 876 \nF. Supp. 1437 (E.D. Pa. 1995).  ACLU attorney Stephen Pevar has been employed \nby the National Office of the ACLU since 1976 and has litigated more than 50 class \nactions against jails and prisons, including Board of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369 \n(1987); Kelly v. Wengler, 822 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2016); Hiser v. Franklin, 82 F.3d \n869 (9th Cir. 1996); Browning v. Vernon, 44 F.3d 318 (9th Cir. 1995); J.P. v.

Certification of the Proposed Classes Is Warranted Under Rule \n23(b)(1). \n \nRule 23(b)(1) permits class certification where “prosecuting separate actions \nby or against individual class members would create a risk of . . . inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class . . . .” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A).  Certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) is appropriate \nonly in “actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief.”  Babineau v. Fed. Exp. \nCorp., 576 F.3d 1183, 1195 (11th Cir. 2009).  Plaintiffs easily satisfy this standard. \nIf hundreds of individual class members were to bring separate suits challenging \nDefendants’ inadequate policies and practices to combat the COVID-19 virus, the \nadjudication of these actions would risk creating inconsistent decisions that would \nestablish varying standards to which Defendants would have to adhere.  Any \nprospective relief granted to Plaintiffs will necessarily benefit the classes they \nrepresent; therefore, certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(1) is appropriate. \n23\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 29 of 33\nB.  Certification of the Proposed Classes Is Warranted Under Rule \n23(b)(2). \n \nRule 23(b)(2) provides for class certification when “the party opposing the \nclass has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nfinal injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting \nthe class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360;  \nMelanie K. v. Horton, No. 1:14-CV-710-WSD, 2015 WL 1308368, at *5 (N.D. Ga. \nMar. 23, 2015).  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are “almost automatically \nsatisfied” in actions seeking injunctive relief for common legal claims.  Baby Neal \nv. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 58 (3d Cir. 1994).  And “Rule 23(b)(2) has been liberally \napplied in the area of civil rights, including suits challenging conditions and \npractices at various detention facilities.”  See Braggs, 317 F.R.D. at 667 (quoting \nBumgarner v. N.C. Dep’t of Corr., 276 F.R.D. 452, 457 (E.D.N.C. 2011)); Parsons \nv. Ryan, 289 F.R.D. 513, 524 (D. Ariz. 2013), aff’d, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 2014) \n(“[C]laims for injunctive relief stemming from allegedly unconstitutional \nconditions of confinement are the quintessential type of claims that Rule 23(b)(2) \nwas meant to address.”).  \nThe classes and subclasses that Plaintiffs seek to certify fit squarely within \nRule 23(b)(2)’s requirements.  See, e.g., Ibrahim v. Acosta, 326 F.R.D. 696, 699 \n(S.D. Fla. 2018) (certifying class of plaintiffs seeking habeas relief).  Plaintiffs and \n24\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 30 of 33\nputative class members challenge Defendants’ failure to implement adequate safety \nprecautions at the Jail, which exposes them to a heightened risk of contracting \nCOVID-19.  \nFor example, Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins seek to represent the Principal \nPretrial Class, and any prospective relief granted to Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins \nwith respect to the jail’s conditions will necessarily benefit each member of the \nclass because all pretrial detainees are held under similar conditions and subjected \nto the same challenged policies and practices.  Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins also \nseek to represent the Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Subclass and Disability Pretrial \nSubclass, and any prospective relief granted to Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins—\nincluding improvements to the jail’s conditions and releases of certain detainees—\nwill necessarily benefit each member of the subclass.  The same is true for the \nmembers of the Post-Adjudication Classes, who are entitled to relief similar to that \nsought by the Pretrial Classes but under distinct constitutional provisions.  \nPlaintiffs thus qualify for certification under Rule 23(b)(2).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should certify the six proposed classes and appoint the \nundersigned as class counsel. \n25\n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 7-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 31 of 33\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Ryan Primerano           \nKosha S.

This Court finds as follows:   \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn July 1, 2020, Plaintiffs—medically vulnerable inmates held1 at the \nClayton County Jail (“the Jail”)—filed suit, on behalf of themselves and others \n \n1 Plaintiff Jones was released from custody after the instant motion was filed.  [Doc. 123-\n1, p. 2].  Although her individual claims appear to be moot, to date, neither party has \nmoved to dismiss them.  Notwithstanding, even if her individual claims are subject to \ndismissal, “the termination of a class representative’s claim does not moot the claims of \nthe unnamed members of the class.”  Cnty. of Riverside v.

[Doc. 1].2  Plaintiffs, who characterize \nthis action as one to “enforce disease prevention measures and to protect people \nwho are uniquely susceptible to the effects of COVID-19,” brought the following \nclaims:  (1) unconstitutional punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \nDue Process Clause; (2) unconstitutional conditions of confinement in violation of \nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; (3) violations of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act; (4) violations of the Rehabilitation Act; and (5) a Petition for a \nWrit of Habeas Corpus under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243.

Id. at 109.  On July 9, \n2020, Plaintiffs’ request was denied.3  [Doc. 8, p. 2]. \n  Plaintiffs renewed their request for injunctive relief by filing the instant \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction on July 27, 2020.  [Doc. 19].  In the motion, \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants to create and file a reasonably specific \nwritten plan—developed in consultation with the Georgia Department of Public \nHealth and/or a qualified medical or public health expert in preventing and \nmitigating the spread of infectious diseases—that addresses the following matters: \n1. Educating detainees, staff members, contractors and/or vendors about \nCOVID-19, including:  symptoms, the importance of social distancing \nand frequent hand washing, the proper use of personal protective \nequipment and other appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate the \nspread of the virus that causes COVID-19, with this education continuing \non a regular and as-needed basis as more information becomes available \nabout the virus; \n \n3 This case was initially assigned to U.S. District Judge Eleanor K. Ross; she denied \nPlaintiffs’ first request for preliminary injunctive relief because the motion was not filed \nseparately as required by her standing order.  The case was reassigned to this Court on \nJuly 28, 2020.  [Doc. 22].   \n  3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 4 of 34\n2.

Educating detainees about COVID-19 quarantining and other protective \nmeasures to take upon release to the community.   \nId. at 2-6.   \n  On July 27, 2020, Plaintiffs requested expedited discovery to obtain \nevidence necessary to support their Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  [Doc. 21].  \nUpon Plaintiffs’ request and over Defendants’ objections, on August 14, 2020, this \nCourt decided to allow the parties to engage in discovery related to the pending \nmotion.  [Doc. 35].  On September 4, 2020, the parties asked the Court to resolve a \ndiscovery dispute.  [Doc. 43].  The parties disagreed as to whether Defendants had \nto produce medical requests and grievances submitted by inmates through a kiosk \nand whether Plaintiffs’ experts would be allowed to inspect the Jail.  Id.  On \nSeptember 11, 2020, after a hearing, this Court ordered Defendants to produce the \nmedical requests and grievances and ordered an inspection of the Jail to occur at a \ntime agreeable to the parties.  [Doc. 47].  Ultimately, based on the agreement of the \nparties, the inspection was conducted on October 4, 2020.     \n  While discovery related to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction was \nongoing, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss.  [Doc. 23].  That motion was \nreferred to U.S. Magistrate Judge Christopher C. Bly, who recommended granting \nthe motion in part and denying it in part.  [Doc. 53].  Judge Bly issued his \n  7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 8 of 34\nrecommendation on September 16, 2020, and it became ripe for this Court’s \nreview on October 21, 2020.  On November 19, 2020, after considering Plaintiffs’ \nobjections and Defendants’ responses thereto, this Court adopted the Report and \nRecommendation and scheduled the preliminary injunction hearing to begin on \nDecember 8, 2020.  [Doc. 73 and November 19, 2020 docket entry].  As it stands \nnow, only the deliberate indifference claim remains.              \nBACKGROUND4 \n  COVID-19 is a virus that spreads easily from person-to-person and causes \nillness that ranges from very mild (including some individuals with no reported \nsymptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death.  [Doc. 48-10, p. 1].  \nSignificantly, older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health \nconditions—like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example—have a \nhigher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.  Id.  On March 11, 2020, the \nWorld Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic.  \nId.  Rightly so, both parties acknowledge that COVID-19 presents a once-in-a-\nlifetime public health crisis.  [Doc. 125, p. 8].  Unfortunately, at least in Georgia \n \n4 These background facts are derived from the evidence included with the parties’ \nbriefings, the evidence presented during the initial two days of the hearing on December \n8-9, 2020, the supplemental evidence submitted thereafter and the evidence tendered \nduring the reconvened hearing on December 17, 2020.   \n  8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 9 of 34\nand most other states within the United States, the pandemic is entering its worst \nphase since its inception as new positive cases continue to increase dramatically.  \n[Doc. 77-6, p. 11].  The virus “poses particularly acute challenges for the \nadministration of the country’s jails and prisons.  Because incarcerated inmates are \nnecessarily confined in close quarters, a contagious virus represents a grave health \nrisk to them—and graver still to those who have underlying conditions that render \nthem medically vulnerable.”  Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir. \n2020).     \n  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (“CDC”) formulated guidelines for healthcare and non-healthcare \nadministrators of correctional and detention facilities.5  [Doc. 41-3, p. 27].  The \nCDC originally issued its guidelines in March 2020, and they have been updated \ntwice (in July and October 2020).  [Doc. 77-6, p. 13].  At the outset of the \nguidelines, the CDC identifies and acknowledges various barriers detention \nfacilities face in controlling the spread of COVID-19 or other communicable \ndiseases.  [Doc. 41-3, p. 27].  These barriers include, but are not limited to, living \n \n5 The Court references these guidelines not because they are determinative in answering \nthe question of whether Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to likely show a \nconstitutional violation—they are not, see Swain, 961 F.3d at 1288—but because both \nPlaintiffs and Defendants reference these guidelines throughout their arguments to this \nCourt.  [See, e.g., Docs. 77-6, p. 18 and 41-3, p. 4].    \n  9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 10 of 34\nwithin a congregate living environment, high turnover of residents, the inability of \nincarcerated persons to exercise disease prevention measures due to security \nconsiderations, crowded living conditions and limited options for medical \nisolation.  Id. at 27-28.  In light of these barriers, the CDC organized its guidelines \ninto three sections:  (1) operational preparedness; (2) prevention; and (3) \nmanagement.  Id. at 30-31.  Notably, the CDC recognized that the guidelines may \nneed to be adapted based on individual facilities’ physical space, staffing, \npopulation, operations and other resources and conditions.  Id. at 27.   \nRegarding operational preparedness, the CDC recommends, among other \nthings, that correctional institutions communicate with staff about COVID-19, \ndevelop a policy or plan to address COVID-19, place educational signage \nthroughout the facility and maintain an adequate amount of supplies, like masks \nand cleaning equipment.  Id. at 31-33.  Concerning the prevention of COVID-19, \nthe CDC advises cleaning frequently touched spaces several times per day, \nencouraging cloth face coverings, conducting pre-intake symptom screening and \nimplementing social distancing strategies, such as staggering recreation times, \nproviding meals in cells, reducing the number of individuals in cells and staging \npill lines in housing units.  Id. at 34-39.  Finally, as to management, the CDC \nsuggests addressing symptoms of COVID-19 as soon as they are reported, \n  10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 11 of 34\nincreasing testing and implementing various quarantine procedures for \nsymptomatic individuals and those who have had close contact with someone \ninfected with COVID-19.  Id. at 39-49.   \n  The Jail employs 108 individuals and houses 1,800 inmates, which is below \nits rated inmate capacity of 2,000.  [Doc. 41-1, pp. 6-7].  Each of the Jail’s eight \nhousing units has six pods and each pod has sixteen cells, for a total of ninety-six \ncells per housing unit.  Id. at 4.  The pods are equipped with a community shower, \ntelephones, televisions, an attorney visitation area, tables and chairs and a \nrecreational activity area (commonly referred to as the dayroom).  Id.  To date, 161 \ninmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19.  [Doc. 78-4, p. 3].  In May, \nJune and July 2020, the average positivity rates for those tested was 24.35%.  \n[Doc. 41-4, p. 7].   \n  In this case, the parties presented dramatically different accounts, which are \ndetailed immediately below, regarding Defendants’ response to the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Defendants, who presented their evidence through their own testimony \nand declarations, an inmate, a CorrectHealth, LLC (“CorrectHealth”)6 employee \nand an expert, essentially maintain:  that inmates wear masks 100% of the time; \nthat inmates maintain social distancing to the maximum extent possible; that \n \n6 CorrectHealth provides medical services at the Jail.  [Doc. 41-3, p. 2].   \n  11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 12 of 34\ncommon areas are consistently cleaned with disinfectants multiple times per day; \nthat inmates are tested immediately upon request or upon exhibiting symptoms; \nand that quarantining procedures are in place and followed.  On the other hand, \nPlaintiffs, presenting their evidence through their own declarations, testimony and \ndeclarations of other incarcerated inmates, a former CorrectHealth employee and \nexperts, principally contend that inmates are not provided with masks or soap, do \nnot have access to prompt medical care or COVID-19 testing and face retaliation if \nthey complain about the lack of care. \nDefendants’ Evidence \nDefendants presented evidence that beginning as early as March 2020, even \nbefore Clayton County, Georgia had any documented cases of COVID-19, the Jail \nbegan implementing various measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within \nthe facility.  Many of these measures are described below. \nOne such measure includes educating inmates and staff.  According to \nDefendants, the staff is continually educated through e-mails and rollcall training.  \n[Docs. 48-7, p. 1 and 125, p. 216].  As to inmates, their education begins during \norientation when inmates watch a video about social distancing and are instructed \nto stay six feet apart, wash their hands and wear a mask.  [Docs. 41-2, p. 3 and 125, \np. 172].  To aid in the education of both staff and inmates alike, educational signs \n  12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 13 of 34\n(which have evolved from flimsy paper to permanent stickers) have been placed \nthroughout the Jail.  [Docs. 41-2, pp. 6-7 and 125, pp. 180-81].   \nAnother measure Defendants implemented is a screening process for all new \ninmates.  Defendants contend that nurses employed by CorrectHealth now screen \nall new inmates entering the facility.  [Docs. 41-2, p. 2 and 48-4, p. 1].  This \nscreening includes a temperature check and questions regarding symptoms and \npossible exposure to COVID-19.  [Doc. 41-3, p. 6].  If an inmate fails the \nscreening process, the inmate is not placed in the general population.  [Doc. 41-1, \np. 19].  Instead, the inmate is sent to the medical infirmary to be monitored by \nmedical staff and tested for COVID-19.  [Doc. 41-3, p. 7].  In addition to screening \ninmates at intake, all employees have their temperature checked before entering the \nbuilding.  [Doc. 125, p. 192].   \nDefendants assert that mandatory mask wearing for all inmates, staff and \nvisitors is another measure that they have taken in response to COVID-19.  \nAccording to Defendants, masks have been required for all those inside the Jail \nsince April 2020.  [Doc. 41-1, p. 10].  Although masks were not readily available \nto inmates at the beginning of the pandemic, Defendants contend that all inmates \nare now given two facemasks (one cloth and one disposable) when they enter the \nfacility and are issued replacement masks upon request.  [Doc. 41-2, p. 8].  The Jail \n  13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 14 of 34\nnow has 15,000 masks in its inventory.  [Doc. 41-1, p. 14].   \nDefendants further argue that they have implemented measures to encourage \nsocial distancing.  These measures include changes to the recreation schedule to \nreduce the number of inmates present in the dayroom at any given time, changes to \nmeal distribution whereby inmates now eat meals in their cells and changes to pill \ncall such that inmates no longer stand in a line to receive their pills.  [Docs. 41-2, \npp. 10-11 and 41-1, p. 14].  Defendants also presented evidence that they blocked \naccess to certain telephones, showers, toilets and sinks to create more space \nbetween inmates.  [Doc. 77-6, p. 25].  Additionally, Defendants contend that they \nreduced the Jail’s inmate population to increase space between the remaining \ninmates.  In February 2020, before the pandemic was declared, the average daily \npopulation at the Jail was 2,178.  [Doc. 78-4, p. 1].  By October 2020, the average \ndaily population at the Jail was reduced to 1,811—a 15.5% reduction.  Id.  \nDefendants argue that they accomplished this reduction through the following:  (1) \ninforming other agencies that the facility would not accept new inmates for minor \ncases or minor arrests; (2) targeting the release of inmates who are fifty-five years \nand older and inmates who have medical conditions; and (3) routinely releasing \ninmates that are scheduled for release any time during a given week on Monday of \nthat week to expedite a reduction in the inmate population.  [Docs. 125, p. 162 and \n  14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 15 of 34\n41-1, pp. 27-28].     \nDefendants argue that testing for COVID-19 and quarantining those infected \nor suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are other measures they have taken \nin response to the pandemic.  To date, Defendants have tested 774 inmates and \nstaff members.  [Doc. 78-4, p. 3].  Defendants claim that COVID-19 tests are never \ndenied to inmates who request a test, exhibit signs or symptoms consistent with \nCOVID-19 or who have had recent contact with someone with COVID-19.  [Doc. \n41-3, p. 9].  According to Defendants, under their protocols, if an inmate is in the \ninfirmary due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19, that inmate will stay in the \ninfirmary for at least fourteen days.  [Doc. 41-1, p. 20].  After the fourteen days, if \nthe inmate receives a negative COVID-19 test, then that inmate can return to the \ngeneral population.  Id.  If the inmate is awaiting test results, however, the inmate \nis moved to a step-down quarantine unit to be further monitored and evaluated.  Id.  \nInmates are not transferred to the general population from the step-down unit until \nthey are asymptomatic and receive a negative test.  Id. \nAs to the cleaning and sanitation measures taken in response to COVID-19, \nDefendants assert that they are using the same protocols they used during the \nMRSA, SARS and bird flu outbreaks.  [Doc. 125, p. 184].  According to \nDefendants, these protocols require inmate workers to clean common areas and \n  15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 16 of 34\nother high-touch areas at least twice a day and after recreation time ends for a \ngroup of inmates.  [Doc. 41-2, p. 9].  These high-touch areas, which are cleaned \nwith a disinfectant known as OPTIM-1, include tables and chairs in the dayroom, \nshowers, visitation areas, telephones, kiosks, door handles, rails and windows.  Id.  \nDefendants also contend that during every shift, inmate workers spray the toilets \nand sinks located in inmates’ cells with OPTIM-1.  [Doc. 125, pp. 185-86]. \nDefendants also argue that they have purchased supplies to aid their \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, the Jail purchased air purifiers \nfor the common areas of the intake and medical units.  Id. at 181.  The Jail also \npurchased handheld thermometers so that temperature checks could be performed \non incoming inmates and staff.  Id. at 192.  The Jail even purchased a metal \ndetector that has a thermal scanning function.  Id.      \nPlaintiffs’ Evidence \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that Defendants have taken some measures to \ncombat the spread of COVID-19 within the Jail.  Plaintiffs, however, contend that \nbecause of, at least in part, Defendants’ lack of a written COVID-19 policy, \nDefendants have failed to consistently implement the measures they know they \nneed to take (or say they are already taking) to reduce the risk of COVID-19.  \nPlaintiffs presented much of their evidence through inmate declarations, some of \n  16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 17 of 34\nwhich were anonymous, describing conditions in the Jail.    \nPlaintiffs assert that despite the mask mandate at the Jail, inmates are not \nconsistently provided masks or replacement masks.  Plaintiffs provided evidence \nthat in the first four months of the pandemic (March through June of this year), \ndetainees were not given masks and instead had to make their own from clothing, \ntowels or rags.  [Doc. 77-6, p. 49].  Even now, months into the pandemic, Plaintiffs \nclaim that inmates are still not regularly given masks.  For instance, Jamie Mills \ntestified that during her entire incarceration in the Jail (from October 2, 2020, \nthrough October 28, 2020) she was without a mask because Jail personnel took her \nmask during the intake process and refused to give her a replacement.  [Doc. 77-5, \np. 9].     \nPlaintiffs further contend that Defendants are not doing enough to enable \nsocial distancing.  Plaintiffs’ chief complaint is the inability to social distance \nwhile confined to small cells with two other people in them.  Plaintiffs presented \nevidence that many detainees are housed three-to-a-cell in cells designed for only \ntwo people.  [Doc. 77-6, p. 18].  For example, Plaintiff Watkins is housed with two \nother inmates.  [Doc. 19-5, p. 19].  Similarly, Plaintiff Jones, who is no longer \nincarcerated, was housed in a cell with three detainees and slept on the floor.  Id. at \n5.  In addition to crowded cells, Plaintiffs argue that inmates are not reminded to \n  17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 18 of 34\nsocial distance when outside their cells and are often forced into lines and other \nspaces where social distancing is not enforced or is impossible.   \nPlaintiffs assert that Defendants also need to do more regarding cleaning, \nsanitation and hygiene.  Even though the CDC recommends an intensified cleaning \nprotocol, inmates say that common areas and high-touch areas are not cleaned \nbefore and after each use.  Id. at 30.  They also state that they are not given \nsupplies necessary to adequately clean their own cells, thus requiring them to clean \ntheir cells with dirty water and left-over toilet paper.  [Doc. 77-6, p. 36].  Review \nof the grievances submitted by inmates to the Jail demonstrates that inmates \nroutinely complain about the lack of cleaning in the common areas.  Id. at 32.  \nPlaintiffs also presented pictures showing a mildewed shower and a clogged \nHVAC vent.  Id. at 34.  In addition to the lack of cleaning, Plaintiffs further argue \nthat they have insufficient hygiene supplies.  To support this assertion, Plaintiffs \npresented evidence that inmates are only issued four ounces of liquid soap per \nweek—an insufficient weekly amount in their opinion.  Id. at 41.  Plaintiffs also \nclaim that they do not have access to communal soap.  The inmates explained that \nbottles of orange soap were placed in the common area restrooms before the \ninspection but were removed before any of the inmates could use the soap.  Id. at \n42-43.      \n  18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 19 of 34\nPlaintiffs contend that inmates cannot easily submit medical requests or \ngrievances.  In the Jail, inmates are required to submit medical requests and other \ngrievances, even those related to COVID-19, via a kiosk.  Id. at 58.  In the \ndeclarations, inmates routinely describe either an inability to access the complaint \nsystem or difficulty accessing it.  Id. at 59.  As an example, Trey Absher, an \ninmate, explained that the kiosks located in his housing unit were broken, making \nit difficult to submit requests.  [Doc. 125, p. 109].  Another inmate, Jaquan \nWilliams, explained that he was unable to submit a medical request regarding \nCOVID-19 because the Jail limits the number of requests an inmate can have \npending.  Id. at 86.  Relatedly, Plaintiffs contend that even when inmates submit \nrequests through the kiosk system, the Jail fails to promptly respond to the \nrequests.  For instance, one inmate explained that he submitted a sick call request \nregarding COVID-19 symptoms and medical staff did not see him for ten days.  \n[Doc. 77-6, p. 66].   \nPlaintiffs additionally argue that testing does not occur in the way \nDefendants claim and that Defendants need to promptly test inmates who request \ntests, have symptoms or have been in close proximity to known cases of COVID-\n19.  In support of this argument, Plaintiffs presented evidence that ninety-eight \ndifferent detainees either reported COVID-19 symptoms or requested a COVID-19 \n  19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 20 of 34\ntest from July 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020.  [Doc. 105-1, p. 1].  Of the ninety-\neight, only four received a test within fourteen days.  Id.  Katie Baker-Leake, a \nformer CorrectHealth employee, stated that she often saw sick call requests from \ninmates who were requesting COVID-19 tests for the second time because the first \nrequest had been ignored.  [Doc. 78-10, p. 5].   \nPlaintiffs also argue that despite Defendants’ quarantine and isolation \nprotocol, Defendants are not actually isolating detainees with COVID-19 or \nsymptoms of COVID-19, which allows the virus to spread throughout the facility.  \nMultiple declarations indicated that sick inmates are not promptly removed or \nnever removed from their cell.  Id. at 17.  One inmate described being placed into a \ncell with a man who had symptoms of COVID-19 (difficulty breathing, cold \nsweats and diarrhea) and who was awaiting COVID-19 test results.  [Doc. 77-6, p. \n63].  Another inmate explained that she experienced coronavirus symptoms and it \ntook one week for medical to respond to her request.  Id. at 65.  This inmate \nexplained that even though she had symptoms, she was never isolated or tested for \nCOVID-19.  Id.  According to Plaintiffs’ expert, “[i]ndividuals with any detected \nsign or symptom not explained by another clinically diagnosed condition should be \nremoved from the rest of the population, tested, and only returned to the rest of the \npopulation upon receiving a negative test result.”  [Doc. 19-2, p. 16].   \n  20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 21 of 34\n  In the instances where inmates are quarantined or isolated, Plaintiffs contend \nthat the quarantine process is not in accordance with CDC guidelines.  For \nexample, one inmate, who was not symptomatic, described being placed in \nquarantine because his cellmate had COVID-19 symptoms.  [Doc. 77-6, p. 68].  \nAlthough this inmate did not have any COVID-19 symptoms, he claimed that he \nwas placed into quarantine with inmates who did have symptoms.  Id.   \n  Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that inmates who report problems relating to the \nJail’s response to COVID-19 often face various forms of retaliation, thus closing \nnecessary channels of communication.  Id. at 71.  For instance, one inmate \ndescribed receiving nutraloaf—an amalgamated food product used for \npunishment—the day following the inspection because some inmates within his \ndorm banged on their cell doors during the inspection.  [Doc. 77-5, pp. 19-20].  \nThat same inmate also described a lockdown on November 11, 2020.  Id. at 21.  As \nanother example, Mr. Absher claimed that he was removed from his position as an \ninmate worker for speaking with a lawyer from the Southern Center for Human \nRights regarding the conditions at the Jail.  Id. at 4.      \nANALYSIS \n  A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show the following: \n(1) a substantial likelihood that he will ultimately prevail on the \nmerits; (2) that he will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction \n  21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 22 of 34\nissues; (3) that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs \nwhatever damage the proposed injunction may cause to the opposing \nparty; and (4) that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to \nthe public interest.   \n \nSofarelli v. Pinellas Cnty., 931 F.2d 718, 723-24 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation \nomitted).  “[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy not to \nbe granted unless the movant clearly establish[es] the ‘burden of persuasion’ as to \neach of the four prerequisites.”  Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. \n2000) (citation omitted).  Granting a preliminary injunction is the exception rather \nthan the rule.  Id.   \nI.  Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nA plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show a substantial \nlikelihood that he will ultimately prevail on the merits of his claim.  Sofarelli, 931 \nF.2d at 723.  This factor is generally considered the most important of the four \nfactors.  Garcia-Mir v. Meese, 781 F.2d 1450, 1453 (11th Cir. 1986).   \nIn this case, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have been “deliberately \nindifferent” to the serious risk that COVID-19 poses to inmates confined at the \nJail.  As a general rule, both the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments are violated \nwhen a jailer is “deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to an \ninmate who suffers injury.”  Swain, 961 F.3d at 1285.  To establish a deliberate \nindifference claim, a plaintiff must make both an objective and a subjective \n  22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 23 of 34\nshowing.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994).  The objective component \nrequires a plaintiff to show a “substantial risk of serious harm” while the subjective \ncomponent requires a plaintiff to demonstrate “the defendants’ deliberate \nindifference” to that risk.  Swain, 961 F.3d at 1285.  Deliberate indifference to the \nrisk of harm, which is the subjective component of this Court’s inquiry, is shown \nthrough three sub-showings:  “(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; \n(2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.”  Id.  \nAt the outset of the Court’s analysis, it is important to note that the deliberate \nindifference standard is “far more onerous than normal tort-based standards of \nconduct sounding in negligence.”  Id. at 1288.  Importantly, a plaintiff must show \nmore than malpractice or simple negligence.  Id. at 1285.  In fact, a plaintiff must \nshow something akin to “subjective recklessness as used in the criminal law.”  Id. \nat 1285-86.  “Indeed, even where ‘prison officials . . . actually knew of a \nsubstantial risk to inmate health or safety,’ they may nonetheless ‘be found free \nfrom liability if they responded reasonably to the risk . . . .’”  Id. at 1286.   \nAs demonstrated in this Court’s Background section, the declarations and \ntestimony provided by the inmates describing their experiences in the Jail contrast \nsharply with the declarations and testimony provided by Defendants which identify \na number of measures taken to protect detainees from exposure to COVID-19.  For \n  23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 24 of 34\nthe reasons explained below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to show both \nthe objective component (substantial risk of serious harm) necessary to establish a \ndeliberate indifference claim and that Defendants had subjective knowledge of that \nharm.  At this stage of the proceedings, however, especially given the conflicting \nevidence,7 this Court is not persuaded Plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing \nthat Defendants disregarded the risk of serious harm by conduct more than mere \nnegligence.  Without this showing, Plaintiffs cannot establish a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits.   \n1.  Objective Component \nThis Court begins by analyzing the objective component of the claim.  The \nobjective component requires a plaintiff to demonstrate a substantial risk of serious \nharm—“i.e., ‘one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment \nor one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the \nnecessity for a doctor’s attention,’ and, in either instance, ‘one that, if left \nunattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm.’”  Hoffer v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t \nof Corr., 973 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir. 2020).   \n \n7 The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is almost always based on an abbreviated \nset of facts.  Cumulus Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Comms., Inc., 304 F.3d 1167, 1171 \n(11th Cir. 2002) (recognizing that preliminary injunctions are, by their nature, products of \nan expedited process often based upon an undeveloped and incomplete evidentiary \nrecord).   \n  24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 25 of 34\nHere, it is undisputed that COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus that can \ncause serious illness, even death.  Both parties acknowledge that to date, the Jail \nhas already documented 161 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Moreover, “[s]ince \nthe beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks in jails and prisons have \nkilled over 1,400 people.”  [Doc. 77-6, p. 13].  Ultimately, based on this evidence, \nthe Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to easily satisfy the objective prong, \ndespite Defendants’ arguments to the contrary.   \n2.  Subjective Component  \nTurning to the subjective component of the claim and the first of the three \nrequired sub-showings—whether Defendants had subjective knowledge of a risk of \nserious harm—Plaintiffs are likely to prevail here too.  In analyzing this first sub-\npart, a court “may infer the existence of this subjective state of mind from the fact \nthat the risk of harm is obvious.”  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 738 (2002).  Here, \nthe risk of harm is obvious, as 161 inmates and staff have already tested positive.  \nMoreover, Defendants have implemented numerous measures to mitigate the risk \nof COVID-19 spreading throughout the Jail, which, at the very least, is an implicit \nacknowledgment of a serious risk of harm.  See Gayle v. Meade, No. 20-21554-\nCiv-COOKE/GOODMAN, 2020 WL 3041326, at *18 (S.D. Fla. June 6, 2020) \n(holding that it is “hard to imagine” that the defendants were unaware of the risk of \n  25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 26 of 34\nserious harm involved in contracting COVID-19 in a jail and determining that the \ndefendants at least “impliedly” acknowledged the risk by creating a set of \nguidelines and recommendations specifically addressing the pandemic).     \nAs to the remaining sub-showings, whether Defendants disregarded the \nrisk by conduct that is more than mere negligence, “the fundamental question . . . \nis whether [Defendants] exhibited ‘a sufficiently culpable state of mind.’”  Swain, \n961 F.3d at 1287.  In evaluating that question, this Court must focus “not on \nisolated failures . . . but rather on [Defendants’] entire course of conduct.”  Id. at \n1287-88.  “It bears repeating that deliberate indifference is not a \nconstitutionalized version of common-law negligence.”  Id. at 1288.   \nThis Court begins its analysis by noting the measures taken by the Jail that \nare not meaningfully in dispute based on the current evidence before the Court.  \nThese measures include screening procedures for new inmates and temperature \nchecks for all employees, reducing the inmate population, purchasing \nthermometers and air purifiers, implementing social distancing measures such as \nchanging the recreation schedule and meal time procedures and increasing space \nbetween showers, toilets and phones and designating isolation and quarantine \nspaces.  The Jail has also educated its staff, albeit not through a written policy, \nregarding COVID-19 and placed signs throughout the facility reminding \n  26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 27 of 34\nindividuals to maintain social distance, wash their hands and wear a mask.       \nNext, this Court addresses the measures taken by the Jail that are in dispute.  \nThe Court is not convinced, based on the present record, that Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated that inmates are not provided masks.  The evidence presented thus \nfar shows that masks have been required in the facility since April 2020.  Even \nthough inmates were initially required to create makeshift masks, credible evidence \nshowed that by early summer, inmates were issued two masks upon arrival.  The \nJail also has 15,000 masks at its disposal.  Although one of the inmates testified \nthat she was never issued a mask and did not have a mask the entire time she was \nincarcerated, this Court questions the veracity of that testimony because \nDefendants presented a picture of the same inmate wearing a mask while \nincarcerated.  [Doc. 96-2, p. 1].  Moreover, two defense witnesses, both inmates, \nadmitted to wearing and receiving masks.  [Doc. 125, pp. 93, 115].     \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs have not yet shown significant lapses in cleaning \nprotocols.  Credible evidence was presented that each dorm is provided with \ndisinfectant cleaning products and inmate workers are required to disinfect the \nhigh-touch areas multiple times per day pursuant to a cleaning schedule.  In fact, \nMr. Absher, one of Plaintiffs’ witnesses, admitted that inmate workers are required \nto clean.  Id. at 116.  Importantly, in most of the pictures reviewed by this Court, \n  27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 28 of 34\nthe Jail appeared reasonably clean.  As to hygiene supplies, Plaintiffs largely \nfocused on the orange soap bottles that were placed in the common area restrooms \nbefore the inspection and disappeared following the inspection.  Regardless of \nwhat happened with the orange soap,8 evidence showed that inmates are given four \nounces of liquid soap or bar soap every week.  Defendants credibly explained that \ninmates are not charged for soap and are given more soap if they request it.   \nThis Court is also not convinced based on the present record that inmates \nface retaliation for complaining about conditions at the Jail.  To be sure, Plaintiffs \nhave shown that inmates were punished following the inspection and forced to eat \nnutraloaf.  While Plaintiffs contend that the punishment was undeserved and that \ninmates were simply trying to speak to the inspectors, the record shows that \ninmates were banging on their cell doors during the inspection.  [Doc. 77-5, p. 25].  \nAdditionally, while Plaintiffs have also shown that inmates are sometimes placed \non lockdown, Plaintiffs have not shown that the lockdowns are causally related to \ncomplaints about the Jail.  For instance, in one inmate declaration, the inmate \n \n8 The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs claim that the orange soap bottles were mere props \nfor the experts’ inspection.  However, Chief Deputy Boehrer explained, credibly in this \nCourt’s opinion, that the bottles were placed in the restrooms in preparation for an \nunrelated inspection to be conducted by the Sheriff the following week, [Doc. 125, p. \n197], and that inmates historically stole such loose items, id. at 180, thus likely \nexplaining their disappearance.    \n  28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 29 of 34\nexplained that his dorm was locked down because two or three inmates were \noutside of their cells when they were not supposed to be.  Id. at 22.  Finally, as to \nMr. Absher, who claimed that he was removed from his position as an inmate \nworker for speaking to a lawyer about the conditions of the Jail, Chief Deputy \nBoehrer provided credible testimony that he removed Mr. Absher from his position \nas an inmate worker after he discovered, during a routine review of the files of all \ninmate workers, that Mr. Absher did not qualify for the position because of the \nseriousness of his pending charges (felony charges involving firearms and drugs).  \n[Doc. 125, pp. 199-200].       \nAlthough Defendants have implemented numerous measures as explained \nabove, based on the record as it stands now, serious questions exist about portions \nof Defendants’ COVID-19 response.  Most concerning to this Court is \nDefendants’ response to those who report symptoms or request testing.9  Here, \nPlaintiffs presented enough evidence to demonstrate that inmates who report \n \n9 The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ evidence did not convincingly show that inmates are \nconsistently unable to report medical problems or other grievances through the kiosk.  \nFor instance, although Mr. Absher testified that the kiosk in his housing unit was broken, \nthus hindering his ability to make requests, the evidence showed that during the time \nwhen the kiosk was broken, Mr. Absher made numerous requests by using a kiosk in a \nneighboring unit.  [Doc. 125, pp. 118-20].  Moreover, Chief Deputy Boehrer credibly \nexplained that inmates do not always need to use the kiosk and can ask their housing \nofficer if they need anything.  Id. at 179.     \n  29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 30 of 34\nsymptoms are not always promptly removed from their cell or tested for COVID-\n19.  By not identifying or separating those with COVID-19 from the general \npopulation, COVID-19 could spread through the Jail.10   \nAfter considering Defendants’ entire course of conduct,11 however, the \n \n10 Also concerning to this Court is the testimony of Ms. Mills and Mr. Absher.  Ms. Mills \ntestified that soon after arriving at the Jail, she was placed on suicide watch, stripped of \nher mask and clothing and placed in a restraint chair.  [Doc. 77-5, p. 8].  She explained \nthat she broke her hip while in custody and was not given medical attention for an entire \nweek.  Id.  As to Mr. Absher, he provided a declaration and testimony concerning his \nexperience as an inmate worker in the infirmary.  [Docs. 77-5, p.1 and 125, p. 100].  Mr. \nAbsher explained that in June of this year, he witnessed S.S., who had COVID-19, die \nwhile in medical isolation at the Jail.  [Doc. 77-5, p. 2].  Mr. Absher testified that he \nnever witnessed S.S. receive any care from medical staff even though S.S. told staff that \nhe could not move.  Id.  He also explained that S.S.’s isolation cell was filled with trash \nand smelled awful.  Id.  Although the testimony of both Ms. Mills and Mr. Absher were \ngiven some weight in the Court’s ultimate decision, they were not given great weight for \nthe following reasons.  First, as to Ms. Mills, questions exist about the credibility of her \ntestimony.  She testified that she was restrained in a chair naked and was never given a \nmask, but Defendants produced a picture of Ms. Mills in the chair while wearing a cloth \ncovering and a mask.  [Doc. 96-2, p. 1].  Also, as even Plaintiffs’ counsel conceded, Ms. \nMills’s medical condition (her hip) did not involve COVID-19.  [Doc. 126, pp. 5-6].  \nNext, as to Mr. Absher’s testimony, this Court questions his credibility as well.  See \nsupra p. 29 and note 9.  And the records presented after the hearing revealed that S.S. did \nreceive medical and mental health care during his time in custody.  [Doc. 101-1].  (It is \nalso noteworthy, especially since the pending motion seeks an injunction requiring \nDefendants “to take steps to protect Plaintiffs and putative class members from being \ninfected with the virus that causes COVID-19,” [Doc. 19, p. 1], that S.S.’s medical \nrecords show that he contracted COVID-19 before being processed into the jail and that \nupon his arrival to the Jail, he was quarantined and isolated in a reverse air-flow cell.  \n[Doc. 101-3, p. 1].)  While there are open questions regarding the quality of care \nprovided to S.S., they cannot dictate the decision on an injunction motion where, as here, \nthe primary issue Plaintiffs raise is the prevention of infections, not the treatment of those \ninfected.  \n11 Swain, 961 F.3d at 1287-88. \n  30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 31 of 34\nCourt finds that Plaintiffs have not provided enough evidence to demonstrate that it \nis likely that Defendants’ COVID-19 response is so deficient that it rises to the \nlevel of deliberate indifference.  Here, this Court cannot ignore the credible \nevidence before it that masks have been required in the facility since April 2020, \nand every inmate is given two masks.  Moreover, all staff undergo temperature \nchecks prior to the start of their shifts and all incoming inmates are screened before \nbeing placed in the general population.  The evidence showed that each dorm is \nprovided with disinfectant cleaning products and inmate workers are required to \ndisinfect the high-touch areas multiple times per day.  Inmates are given soap and \nhave running water in their cells to enable them to properly wash their hands.  \nImportantly, the inmate population has been reduced and meal time and recreation \ntime have all been adjusted to allow for easier social distancing.  Social distancing \nhas also been encouraged by creating space between chairs, phones, toilets and \nshowers.  Signage also reminds the inmates to separate.  Finally, although \nimperfect, Defendants have designated separate spaces for isolation and \nquarantine.  These are only some, but not all, of the preventative measures that the \nJail has implemented.  In light of these measures, Plaintiffs have not met their \nburden to show a substantial likelihood of success as to their deliberate \nindifference claim.   \n  31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 32 of 34\n  While the evidence presently before the Court indicates that the Jail, as to its \nCOVID-19 policies and procedures, could be doing more to protect vulnerable \ninmates, especially in the area of testing and responding promptly to medical \nrequests, federal judges are not wardens.  “The Constitution charges federal judges \nwith deciding cases and controversies, not with running state prisons.”  Lewis v. \nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 363 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring).  The narrow question \nbefore this Court is whether Plaintiffs have shown that Defendants have likely \nviolated the Constitution.  And, under governing precedent, that burden is \nextremely high.  See Swain, 961 F.3d at 1287.  Given the high threshold necessary \nto show deliberate indifference and the proactive measures implemented by the \nJail, however imperfect the implementation of those measures may be, Plaintiffs \nfail to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.  This decision \nis not meant to suggest that the evidence, especially after it is more fully \ndeveloped, could not be found to be sufficient to establish a constitutional \nviolation.  Rather, this Court finds only that based on the present record, and under \nPlaintiffs’ burden, the evidence before the Court is not adequate to merit injunctive \nrelief.           \nII.  Other Prerequisites \nAs explained in detail above, Plaintiffs fail to show a substantial likelihood \n  32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 33 of 34\nof success on the merits as to their deliberate indifference claim.  Therefore, this \nCourt will not address whether Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed should an \ninjunction not issue or whether the balance of equities12 favors injunctive relief.  \nSee Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1342 (11th Cir. 1994) \n(recognizing that when plaintiffs fail to establish a substantial likelihood of success \non the merits, the other prerequisites need not be addressed).  See also Bloedorn v. \nGrube, 631 F.3d 1218, 1229 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding that if the plaintiff is unable \nto show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, the court need not \nconsider the other requirements); Stearns-Miller v. Inch, No. 20-22309-CV-\nSCOLA, 2020 WL 5633839, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 24, 2020) (declining to address \nthe other requirements after determining that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits as to a deliberate indifference claim \ninvolving COVID-19 at a detention facility).  \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court recognizes that the potential spread of COVID-19 in our \ncountry’s jails and prisons, including Clayton County’s, is an urgent problem—\n \n12 In a case like this, where the government is the party opposing the preliminary \ninjunction, the final two preliminary injunction factors (harm to the opposing party and \nthe public interest) merge.  Swain v. Junior, 958 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir. 2020) \n(“[W]here the government is the party opposing the preliminary injunction, its interest \nand harm merge with the public interest.”).   \n  33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 128   Filed 12/24/20   Page 34 of 34\none with potentially grave consequences.  Here, however, Plaintiffs have failed to \nshow a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim \nand, as such, have failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to a preliminary \ninjunction as a matter of law.  Ultimately, after thoroughly reviewing the record \nand the evidence, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. 19] is \nDENIED.   \nSO ORDERED this 24th day of December, 2020. \n \n34 ",

In support thereof, \nPlaintiffs allege the following:  \n1.  This is an action to enforce disease prevention measures and to protect \npeople who are uniquely susceptible to the effects of COVID-19 at Georgia’s \nsecond most populous jail.  Three months into a global coronavirus pandemic that \nhas killed over 125,000 Americans, Defendant Victor Hill, the sheriff of Clayton \nCounty, and his subordinates have done little to protect the Clayton County Jail’s \napproximately 2,000 detainees from serious illness or death.  As a result, there is a \nsignificant outbreak of COVID-19 at the jail.  The outbreak poses a substantial risk \nof serious harm to detainees, staff, and the community at large.  It threatens the \nlives of medically vulnerable people and people with disabilities.   \n2.  The Sheriff of Clayton County has not made any public statement \nregarding the outbreak at his facility, and he has declined to produce to \nundersigned counsel any document showing its scope or duration.  According to \nthe Georgia Department of Public Health, however, as of June 11, 2020, 45 people \nat the Clayton County Jail tested positive for COVID-19 (32 detainees and 13 staff \n \n1 \n\nmembers).  The outbreak is escalating, with 16 positive tests (13 detainees and 3 \nstaff members) occurring in the first eight days of June alone.  \n3.  Many of the people in the Clayton County Jail are serving brief \nsentences for minor offenses, such as misdemeanors or technical probation \nviolations.  Many are in jail awaiting trial because they are indigent and cannot \nafford to purchase their release on bail.  A significant number are aged or have \npreexisting health conditions. \n4.  Plaintiff Rhonda Jones is 58 years old and has chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease.  She has been hospitalized twice for pneumonia in the past \nyear.  She has been charged with a felony offense and is awaiting trial.  She is \nindigent and unable to pay her bail amount. \n5.  Plaintiff Randolph Mitchell is 72 years old and has high blood \npressure and a heart condition that may soon require a pacemaker.  He has served \nover 10 months of a 12-month sentence for a misdemeanor offense. \n6.  Plaintiff Michael Singleton is 59 years old and has high blood \npressure.  He is serving a one-year sentence for violation of probation.   \n7.  Plaintiff Barry Watkins is 60 years old and has diabetes requiring a \ncontrolled diet and insulin injections.  He has been charged with a property crime \nand is awaiting trial.  He is indigent and unable to purchase his release on bail. \n \n2 \n\n8.  Ms. Jones, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Singleton, Mr. Watkins and other \ndetainees face a substantial risk of serious harm and or death absent intervention by \nthis Court. \n9.  The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is by now well \nunderstood.  The disease causes serious illness in a significant number of those \nexposed to it and has a high mortality rate among people with certain health \nproblems.  The virus that causes COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads \nprimarily through respiratory droplets produced by an infected person and also by \nexposure to contaminated surfaces.  Because there is no vaccine or cure for the \ndisease, the only way to prevent an infection is to avoid exposure, and this is \naccomplished through social distancing, protective equipment, and adequate \npersonal hygiene.   \n10.  The risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in institutional settings likewise is \nwell known by now.  Many outbreaks have occurred in congregate environments \nsuch as nursing homes, cruise ships, funerals, worship services, and correctional \nfacilities—places where many people interact in a confined area.   \n11.  Due to their design, jails pose unique risks for the spread of disease.  \nPeople in jails are confined in close proximity to many others, sharing common \ntoilets, showers, equipment, and living areas.  Constant turnover of the detainee \n \n3 \n\npopulation and rotation of officers in and out of the jail’s housing areas create \nvectors for disease to enter a facility and infect large numbers of people, many of \nthem vulnerable due to age, health conditions, or disabilities.  Not surprisingly, \nmany of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States have occurred at jails \nand prisons.  Jails have become a significant source of the virus’s spread to the \nwider community.   \n12.  Recognizing the obvious risk of serious harm to detainees, staff and \ncommunities, many officials responsible for Georgia’s jails have acted to prevent \nand mitigate outbreaks inside their facilities by reducing jail populations, screening \ndetainees, swiftly responding to suspected infections, and promoting reasonable \ncleanliness and hygiene in the areas where detainees live and congregate.  To take \njust one measure of these efforts in Georgia, the statewide jail population fell by \n9,962 people between March 5 and May 7, 2020, ending with an average statewide \njail population at 57 percent of overall jail capacity—down from 77 percent two \nmonths earlier. \n13.  The obvious need for prevention and mitigation efforts has not \nspurred meaningful action by those responsible for the Clayton County Jail.  \nEponymously dubbed “the Hill-ton” by Defendant Hill, whose administration \nstates that he runs Georgia’s “toughest para-military jail,” the Clayton County Jail \n \n4 \n\nremains at nearly 100 percent capacity, with most detainees housed three to a two-\nbed cell.  The third person sleeps on the floor near an open toilet.  Detainees \ninteract in close proximity to numerous others, with no physical distancing, during \nmeal distribution, pill call, video court, and other out-of-cell activities.  \n14.  Detainees share cells, showers, telephones, and other fixtures that are \nrarely if ever sanitized.  To maintain personal hygiene, they are issued four ounces \nof liquid soap per week (for bathing, in-cell cleaning, and, in some instances, \nlaundering of essential items) and small quantities of toilet paper and toothpaste.   \n15.  Although COVID-19 is rapidly spreading through the jail, jailers have \nprovided virtually no information to detainees about COVID-19 prevention.   \n16.  For most detainees, the sum total of Defendants’ prevention effort has \nbeen to tell detainees to use a towel, t-shirt, sock, or underwear as a makeshift \nfacemask, and to limit some (but not all) out-of-cell time to groups of 12 people.  \nFrom mid-March through the end of May, Defendants made no discernible effort \nto ensure minimally adequate personal hygiene, facility sanitation, and disease \nprevention efforts.1 \n \n1 Following the start of Plaintiffs’ investigation into the jail’s conditions, jailers in \nearly June distributed some facemasks and began cleaning certain areas of the jail \nmore regularly, but those minor changes are insufficient to protect detainees from \nspreading infection.  Cleaning occurs in a cursory manner, at irregular intervals, and \n \n5 \n\n17.  Even as the number of positive cases increased, Defendants failed to \ntake reasonable, easy-to-implement measures to protect people.  For example, for \nmonths, even medically vulnerable detainees had no jail-issued masks, and some \nstill lack them.  Former detainee F.S. used a cut-up sheet as a makeshift mask.  \nM.B. wore a piece of torn underwear over her face.  Plaintiff Mitchell bought a \nmask made of underwear from a detainee in exchange for two packets of soup.   \n18.  Efforts to identify and isolate infected persons are often haphazard or \nnonexistent.  When individuals exhibit and report symptoms consistent with \nCOVID-19—such as fever, shortness of breath, and coughing—jailers often leave \nthem in overcrowded cells for days before attempting to isolate them.  Sometimes, \nsymptomatic individuals are not isolated at all.  They are instead told to submit a \n“sick call” request but must then wait up to a week before seeing a medical \nprovider.  Meanwhile, the infected individuals spread the coronavirus to the other \noccupants of their cells and dormitories.   \n19.  In some cases, people who experience symptoms related to COVID-\n19 have no timely way to request medical assistance because they lack access to \nthe jail’s electronic kiosk system.   \n \noften at the initiative of individual detainees.  Sanitizing products remain scarce and \nare often available only to officers.   \n \n6 \n\n20.  If an infected person is removed from a cell, no consistent effort is \nmade to sanitize the detainee’s former living areas or to quarantine those who \nshared the cell.  Instead, new people are immediately assigned to occupy the beds \nof people who are suspected to be infected.     \n21.  The need for court intervention is urgent.  The following chart shows \nthe steep increase in the number of detainees and staff who have tested positive for \nCOVID-19 between April 8, 2020 and June 11, 2020. \nPositive COVID-19 Tests Among People in the \nClayton County Jail as of June 11, 2020\n50\n45\n40 Total\nPositives\n35\n30 Detainee\n25 Positives\n20\nStaff\n15 Positives\n10\n5\n0\nSource: June 3, 2020 \nOpen Records \nRequest to Clayton \nHealth District. \n \n22.  The rise in infections in May and June is a direct result of Defendants’ \nconsistent and ongoing failures to take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk of a \nCOVID-19 outbreak in the jail.      \n23.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and \n \n7 \n\nsimilarly situated detainees to end Defendants’ unlawful practices and vindicate \ntheir rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution, and under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation \nAct.2 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n24.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343(a) (3) and (4) because it raises claims arising under the United States \nConstitution; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12133; and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \n§§ 701 et seq.  The Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243 \nbecause Plaintiffs are in custody in violation of the Constitution, laws, and treaties \nof the United States.     \n25.  The Court has authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n26.  The Court has authority to grant injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2202 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n \n2  Plaintiffs  are  filing  declarations  of  Clayton  County  Jail  detainees \ncontemporaneously with this complaint. \n \n8 \n\n27.  The Atlanta Division of the Northern District of Georgia is the proper \nvenue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and Local Rule 3.1B(1) because all defendants \nare Georgia residents and at least one defendant resides in the Atlanta Division of \nthe Northern District of Georgia; and under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and Local Rule \n3.1B(3) because a substantial part of the acts and omissions giving rise to this \naction occurred in the Atlanta Division of the Northern District of Georgia. \nPARTIES \nA.

As Administrative Operations Section \nCommander, Defendant Johnson has been delegated and exercises the Sheriff’s \nauthorities in supervising and managing the Clayton County Jail’s operations, \nincluding procuring necessary equipment for the jail and maintaining the jail’s \nphysical plant.  Defendant Johnson reports to and is supervised by Defendants Hill, \nBoehrer, and Gibson.  Defendant Johnson is a resident of Clayton County, \nGeorgia.  At all times relevant to this complaint, Defendant Johnson has acted \nunder color of state law. \n \n13 \n\nALLEGATIONS OF FACT \nA.  The Clayton County Jail Is Unsanitary, Is Understaffed, and Holds \nThree People in Cells Built for Two. \n39.  Clayton County, Georgia, is a municipal entity and political \nsubdivision of the State of Georgia.  It is located in the Atlanta metropolitan area \napproximately 20 miles south of Atlanta.  It has a population of approximately \n292,000.   \n40.  The Sheriff of Clayton County, Defendant Victor Hill, operates the \nClayton County Jail, a detention facility located in the Harold E. Banke Justice \nCenter at 9157 Tara Boulevard, Jonesboro, Georgia.  The jail has been in operation \nsince 2000 and holds primarily pretrial detainees for Clayton County and the cities \nof Jonesboro, Lake City, Forest Park, Lovejoy, Morrow, and Riverdale. \n41.  The Clayton County Jail has 768 cells located in eight octagonal \nhousing units, divided between four buildings.   \n42.  Each housing unit consists of six pods, and each pod contains 16 cells.  \nAn officer assigned to the booth in the center of each housing unit is responsible \nfor monitoring all six pods.   \n43.  In addition to cells, the jail has eight open dormitories designed for up \nto 48 people each.  The dormitories house “inmate workers,” who maintain the jail \n \n14 \n\nand perform services in the community, and people serving work release or \n“weekender” sentences.   \n44.  The following image depicts the jail’s housing units and dormitories, \nas viewed from above: \n \n45.  Although the Clayton County Jail has a nominal bed capacity of \n1,920, in practice it does not hold that many beds because maintenance problems \nrender some cells unusable, and operational concerns, such as classification \ndecisions, limit where certain detainees may be housed.   \n46.  As a result of these operational and maintenance considerations, the \njail regularly places three—and sometimes four—people in cells designed for only \ntwo, even when the jail’s population is below its design capacity.   \n47.  When three or four people are placed in a cell, the third and fourth \n \n15 \n\npersons in each cell sleep on a thin mattress placed on the floor.  An open toilet \nshared by cell occupants is feet away from where that person sleeps.3     \n48.  The following image depicts the interior of a standard cell:    \n \n49.  Detainees held in cells normally get one to two hours per day of out-\n \n3 Requiring prisoners to sleep on the floor as a matter of routine, as occurs in the \nClayton County Jail, has been found unconstitutional. See, e.g., Lareau v. Manson, \n651 F.2d 96, 107-08 (2d Cir. 1981); cf. Fambro v. Fulton Cty., Ga., 713 F. Supp. \n1426, 1428–29 (N.D. Ga. 1989) (concluding that a combination of conditions, \nincluding  requiring  detainees  to  sleep  on  floor,  resulted  in  “unquestionably \nunconstitutional” conditions sufficient to support a release order); Union County Jail \nInmates v. DiBuono, 713 F.2d 984, 996 (3d Cir. 1983) (criticizing “the unsanitary \nand humiliating practice of forcing detainees to sleep on mattresses placed either on \nthe floor adjacent to the toilet and at the feet of their cellmates, or elsewhere in the \njail.”). At a minimum this situation imposes a duty on Defendants to take reasonable \nsteps to mitigate the health hazards that these cramped quarters create. \n \n16 \n\nof-cell time and are confined to their cells continuously for the remainder of the \ntime.     \n50.  The majority of two-person cells in the jail house three detainees.  \nThis is in part because the population of the jail has sharply increased in recent \nyears.  \n51.  Over the past year, the detainee population of the jail has been near or \nabove its design capacity, averaging 101 percent of capacity from June 2019 to \nJune 2020.  \n52.  The population of the jail in April this year exceeded the jail’s \nnominal capacity, and was a marked increase from the population level at the same \ntime in previous years:  \nClayton County Jail Population in April: 2015 to 2020\n2100\n2000\n1900\nNominal Jail\n1800 Capacity\n1700 Actual\nPopulation\n1600\n1500\n1400\n1300\nSource: Ga. Dep't of \nCommunity Supervision \nJail Reports, April 2015 \nto April 2020   \n \n17 \n\n53.  Defendant Hill, the controversial4 sheriff of Clayton County, \ncultivates an image of himself as a comic book hero.5  He  refers to the jail \neponymously as “The Hill-ton,” and bills it as “Georgia’s toughest para-military \njail.”6  Defendant Hill has established various policies and practices with no \ndiscernible purpose other than to dehumanize people in his custody.  Detainees \nmust greet Hill and other supervisors by loudly announcing the supervisor’s \npresence, immediately placing their hands behind their back, facing the closest \navailable wall, and remaining silent unless spoken to—including detainees who are \nlocked inside their cells when supervisors enter housing units.  Defendant Hill has \nadopted a practice of administering repulsive “special management meals”—more \ncommonly known as “nutraloaf”—as punishment for certain infractions.  The jail \nis known among detainees as a “hands-on facility” with respect to use-of-force \n \n4 See, e.g., Leon Stafford, Victor Hill Rival Says Clayton Sheriff Arrested Wife to \nIntimidate Him, Atlanta J.-Const., Aug. 16, 2018 (“Over the years . . . , detractors \nhave described his behavior as everything from reckless to criminal.”). \n5 Advisory, Clayton Cty.

Defendants have used restraint chairs to punish detainees who \ndisplease the Sheriff.  Detainees are punished for committing minor rule \ninfractions, such as failing to fold the end of their toilet paper roll into the letter \n“V.”          \n54.  Defendant Hill has failed to prioritize vital aspects of responsible jail \nmanagement.  He and his staff hold around 2,000 people—often people accused of \nmisdemeanors, technical probation violations, or other minor offenses—in a \nfacility where detainees’ basic needs go unmet. \n55.  As noted above, people assigned to cell-based housing units, as most \ndetainees are, spend 22 to 23 hours per day confined in a small space, usually with \ntwo and sometimes three other people.   \n56.  When they come out of their cells, they are restricted to a dayroom \narea inside of the pod for “free time,” which is detainees’ opportunity to shower, \nuse the telephone, or use the electronic kiosk, a computer device used to file \nrequests for medical care, submit grievances, and order items from the jail \ncommissary.  Detainees interact with other detainees during free time, often \nconversing or playing card games.   \n57.  Each pod has two or three showers for up to 48 detainees.  Through \n \n19 \n\nthe end of May 2020, the showers were cleaned infrequently.  In some pods, \nshowers were not cleaned for months at a time, because jail officers failed to \nprovide detainees with cleaning materials.  In other pods, showers were cleaned at \nmost once per week.  Assuming that each detainee in a pod showers daily, that the \npod has three working showers (not all do), and that showers are cleaned weekly \n(most are not), the average shower would be used at least 112 times between \ncleanings.  The showers thus present an obvious way for contagious diseases to \nspread among many detainees.     \n58.  Each dayroom also has a toilet and sink.  Though most detainees have \ntoilets in their cells, certain cells have toilets that do not work, and detainees \nassigned to those cells must wait for free time to use the dayroom toilet.  Like the \nshowers, the toilet and sink in the dayroom were cleaned infrequently (less than \nweekly in most units) through late May, making them another obvious hub for \ncontagious diseases to pass between detainees. \n59.  Most pods have five telephones for up to 48 detainees.  The \ntelephones are spaced approximately 18 inches apart, resulting in people using the \ntelephones in close proximity to one another.  Many telephones are broken.  In \nnone of the units are detainees provided with sanitary wipes or disinfectant to clean \nthe telephone between uses.  As a result, detainees who use the telephones have \n \n20 \n\nindirect contact with numerous people who have touched and breathed on the \ntelephones before them.        \n60.  Most but not all pods have at least one electronic multipurpose kiosk.  \nAs with the telephones and showers, the jail has created no system by which the \nkiosks are cleaned between uses, resulting in indirect contact among the numerous \ndetainees who use them. \n61.  Detainees in certain pods are denied any access to a kiosk.  In \naddition, jail staff often deny detainees access to the kiosk as punishment for minor \nrule violations.  For detainees who cannot access a kiosk, there is no way to submit \na medical request form or other kind of request, because the jail does not use or \ndistribute paper forms.   \n62.  A purported grievance procedure is available on the kiosk only, not \nthrough paper forms.  Grievances are rarely answered, and detainees cannot have \nmore than two grievances pending at a time.  People who have two grievances \npending cannot file grievances about new problems.  Many detainees have had two \ngrievances pending for months without a response.  There is no way to withdraw a \npending grievance via the kiosk, and detainees are given no guidance about how to \nappeal a grievance decision.  No information about the grievance procedure is \ngiven to detainees when they enter the jail; detainees do not receive inmate \n \n21 \n\nhandbooks explaining the grievance procedure and other jail rules.   \n63.  Detainees in segregation units and other housing units without a kiosk \nare completely barred from accessing the grievance procedure, as are detainees \nwho have been deprived of kiosk access as a disciplinary sanction.   \n64.  The jail is designed to have at least two officers in each housing unit, \none in a central booth overseeing up to 192 detainees and the other officer on the \nfloor.  Currently, however, due to understaffing, most housing units have only a \nsingle officer in a booth overseeing up to 288 detainees.  The officer in the booth \nremains in the booth unless relieved by another officer to conduct headcounts, \ndistribute meals or medication, or respond to problems.  \n65.  The Clayton County Jail lacks sufficient resources to effectively \nrespond to emergencies.  Due to understaffing, detainees have difficulty notifying \nstaff members of emergencies and face delays in getting aid when emergencies \noccur.  Although cells originally had intercoms and emergency call buttons \ninstalled, the call buttons appear to have been disabled in many cells.  To get \nofficers’ attention, detainees must yell and beat on their cell doors, then wait for an \navailable officer.   \n66.  Understaffing, lack of resources, and poor supervision by \nadministrators prevent the jail from providing adequate sanitation and hygiene.   \n \n22 \n\n67.  At best, the sum total of personal hygiene supplies issued to detainees \nincludes one approximately four-ounce bottle of liquid soap per week, toilet paper, \nand a toothbrush and toothpaste.  In practice, the jail often runs out of one or more \nof these items each week, resulting in some detainees going without soap, \ntoothpaste, or toilet paper.  Some detainees must wait a week or more after \nentering the jail to receive a toothbrush.  Women often go without sanitary napkins \nand have to stuff their underwear (if they have any) with toilet paper (if they have \nany) during their menstrual cycles.  Detainees are only permitted to shave for court \nappearances, if at all.  The small amount of liquid soap issued is all detainees have \nwith which to clean themselves, their cells, and in some cases, their clothing for an \nentire week.  This is insufficient to maintain minimally adequate personal hygiene, \nespecially during a pandemic. \n68.  Housing unit cleaning is ordinarily assigned to “inmate workers,” \nsometimes called trustees, who live in open dormitories.   \n69.  Due to lack of supplies and inadequate supervision, the “inmate \nworkers” responsible for most housing units do not regularly clean common area \ntables, telephones, kiosks, showers, bathrooms, door handles, and other items used \nfrequently by detainees. \n70.  There is no system in place for supervisory officers to ensure that \n \n23 \n\nhousing units are sanitary.  Some detainees recognize the importance of sanitation \nand proactively attempt to clean the units with what few supplies are available—\nsuch as bath soap—but most officers do not promote those efforts because \nDefendants are indifferent to the matter.   \n71.  The overcrowded cells where detainees spend most of their time are \nalmost never sanitized.  The only cleaning materials provided regularly are a \nbroom and a dirty mop for the floor.  In some housing units, there is only one mop \nfor all 96 cells.  There is no regular schedule for cleaning and sanitizing toilets, \nsinks, bedframes, walls, doors, and other cell fixtures.  Some detainees resort to \nusing their four-ounce weekly supply of liquid soap and bits of toilet paper to wipe \ndown their cells.  While jailers reportedly increased the frequency of cell cleaning \nin late May, detainees report that such cleaning often involves only the spraying of \na teaspoon-like quantity of cleaner into their cell sinks.    \n72.  The lack of adequate sanitation is evident throughout the jail.  Many \ncells and showers have significant amounts of mold and mildew in them.  Dorms \nare infested with roaches, spiders, gnats, and ants. \n73.  The only clothing items issued to detainees upon entry into the jail are \none jumpsuit, one towel, and one washcloth.  The jail does not issue socks or \nundergarments, which must be purchased by detainees.  Those who lack money to \n \n24 \n\npurchase undergarments go without them.    \n74.  Lacking other options, detainees who wish to clean the toilets, sinks, \nand other fixtures in their cells sometimes resort to using their jail-issued towel and \nwashcloth, or pieces of toilet paper, to wipe down surfaces.   \n75.  Laundry is supposed to be collected approximately once every week \nto two weeks.  There are often not enough clean jumpsuits to go around, resulting \nin detainees wearing the same jumpsuit for weeks or even a month at a time.  Many \ndetainees use the same towels and washcloths for months between laundering.  \nSheets are often not laundered for a month or more at a time. Many detainees go \nweeks without sheets, sleeping directly on thin plastic mattresses while waiting for \ntheir sheets to be returned. \n76.  The 20-year-old jail facility has recurring maintenance issues.  Many \ntoilets are inoperable.  Some cells have putrid standing water in them from leaking \ntoilet fixtures.  In certain pods, water leaks result in puddles of standing water in \nthe common areas.  Defective showers flood the dayroom and cause water to seep \ninto cells.  Some detainees resort to placing their blankets around their toilets or \nagainst their cell doors to absorb the water.       \n77.  The Sheriff’s budget for fiscal year 2020 is $37.8 million, and $38.5 \n \n25 \n\nmillion has been proposed for 2021.7  As Sheriff, Defendant Hill has broad \ndiscretion to spend that budget as he sees fit.  See, e.g., Chaffin v. Calhoun, 262 \nGa. 202, 203 (1992) (“[A]lthough the county commission has the power and the \nduty to issue a budget, the county commission may not dictate to the sheriff how \nthat budget will be spent in the exercise of his duties.”).  Accordingly, Defendant \nHill could allocate more of his budget to the jail to address many of the problems \ndiscussed above.  But he spends his budget on other things.   \n78.  In the recent past, those things have reportedly included patrol \nvehicles customized with lights that flash his initials,8 first-class airfare to various \nevents around the country,9 week-long stays at casino hotels,10 four-day tai chi \nworkshops,11 “extreme video eyewear,”12 machetes,13 and $2,000 worth of \n“commemorative coins which feature his name on one side, and a Batman emblem \n \n7 See Clayton Cty.

By contrast, some of the roughly 2,000 detainees at the Clayton \nCounty Jail do not receive their allotments of bath soap, toilet paper, sanitary \nnapkins, and toothpaste. \n80.  In sum, the Clayton County Jail is understaffed, unsanitary, and \nchronically mismanaged.  The jail’s deficiencies in these areas are so obvious that \njailers knew about them long before the COVID-19 pandemic prompted official \ndeclarations of a public emergency in March 2020.  Defendants’ response has been \nto disregard the entrenched problems at this jail, even after the onset of a global \npandemic that threatens the lives of detainees, staff, and the community. \nB.  The Coronavirus Pandemic Presents a Substantial Risk of Serious \nHarm to People in the Clayton County Jail. \n81.  COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads \naggressively from person to person and can cause death.  The virus is easily \ntransmitted through respiratory droplets, close personal contact, and from contact \nwith contaminated surfaces or objects.15  COVID-19 is thought to survive for three \n \n14 Id. \n15 See World Health Organization, Modes of Transmission of Virus Causing COVID-\n19:  Implications  for  IPC  Precaution  Recommendations  (Mar.  29,  2020), \nhttps://bit.ly/2VEsx1J. \n \n27 \n\nhours in the air in droplet form, up to twenty-four hours on cardboard, up to two \ndays on plastic, and up to three days on steel.16 \n82.  Infected people—who may be asymptomatic—can spread the disease \neven through indirect contact with others.  The virus’s current estimated incubation \nperiod is between 2 and 14 days.17  Recent studies show that as many as half of all \ntransmitted cases pass from an infected person with few or no symptoms.18 \n83.   As of July 1, 2020, over 10 million persons worldwide have tested \npositive for COVID-19, and over 500,000 have died.19  In the United States, over \n2.5 million people have tested positive for COVID-19, and over 125,000 people \nhave died.20  Over the past three months, an average of more than 1,200 Americans \nhave died from complications related to COVID-19 each day.21 \n \n16 Neeltje van Doremalen et al., Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as \nCompared  with  SARS-CoV-1,  New  England  J.

In Georgia, at least 80,000 people have tested positive for COVID-\n19.24  More than 2,800 have died.25  The numbers in the state are trending upwards: \nreported COVID-19 cases have risen to a new high in each of the past three \nweeks.26  Researchers at Georgia Tech predict that Georgia’s COVID-19 infections \nand deaths will continue to rise through mid-August.27  By the peak, the model \npredicts that without strict social distancing as many as 17,900 Georgians could die \nand that the illness could impact at least 28 percent of the state’s population.28 \n \n22 James Glanz et al., Coronavirus Could Overwhelm U.S. without Urgent Action, \nEstimates Say, N.Y.

A recent study found that COVID-19, the disease caused by the \ncoronavirus, is between ten and forty-four times deadlier than a severe seasonal \ninfluenza.29 \n87.  COVID-19 can damage lung tissue, lead to acute respiratory distress \nsyndrome, and affect cardiac functions.  Emerging evidence also indicates that the \ndisease may be associated with other serious health problems.  For example, \nCOVID-19 can trigger an over-response in the immune system and further damage \nthe body’s tissues or organs, including permanent harm to the kidneys or \nneurologic injury. \n88.  Complications can manifest at an alarming pace.  Patients can show \nthe first symptoms of infection in as little as two days after exposure, and their \ncondition can seriously deteriorate in as little as five days. \n89.  Further, patients with serious cases of COVID-19 need advanced \nmedical support with highly specialized equipment that is in limited supply. \n90.

Social distancing—isolating oneself from other people at a minimum \ndistance of six feet—is especially significant because the virus can spread through \npeople who have no apparent symptoms.41  \n97.  Public officials in Georgia have reordered everyday life to \nacknowledge these new risks.  Governor Brian Kemp declared COVID-19 a public \nhealth emergency, required medically fragile and older Georgians to shelter in \nplace, and ordered all Georgians who leave their homes to adhere to social \ndistancing measures recommended by the CDC.42  Both Governor Kemp and \nGeorgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey have urged \nGeorgians to stay at home if they can, and to wear masks when in public.43  \n \n40  Press  Release,  Ga.

Jail and prisons become ticking time bombs during a pandemic. \nAccording to the Georgia Department of Public Health, “Correctional and \ndetention facilities are considered at very high risk for COVID-19 spread and \noutbreaks due to having a high volume of people within a close, congregate \nsetting.”46 The CDC similarly warns that the “congregate environments” in prisons \nand jails “heighten[] the potential for COVID-19 to spread once introduced.”47 \n \nGeorgia Health Commissioner Reiterates Importance of Masks, Social Distancing, \n11Alive, May 4, 2020, https://bit.ly/3gcZIBe. \n44 Ga.

In addition to causing significant harm to those incarcerated, \noutbreaks of COVID-19 in jails can cause additional infections, hospitalizations, \nand deaths among jail staff and the surrounding community in which a jail sits.  \n100.  Recognizing these risks, on March 30, 2020, the CDC published \nguidance for correctional and detention facilities, including local jails, to follow in \norder to minimize the risk of an outbreak.48  The CDC recognized that incarcerated \npeople must exist “within congregate environments” that “heighten[] the potential \nfor COVID-19 to spread once introduced.”49 Indeed, “[t]here are many \nopportunities for COVID-19 to be introduced into a correctional or detention \nfacility” including “daily staff ingress and egress,” the “transfer of \nincarcerated/detained persons between facilities and systems,” the transport of \npeople to “to court appearances,” and the “high turnover” of “admit[ted] new \nentrants.”50 Accordingly, the CDC recommends that correctional facilities \nundertake the following preventive measures, few of which are being undertaken \nin the Clayton County Jail: \n \n48 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management \nof Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n(Mar. 23, 2020), https://bit.ly/2BX2gES. \n49 Id. \n50 Id. \n \n36 \n\n•  Post  signage  throughout  the  facility  communicating \nCOVID-19 symptoms and hand hygiene instructions, \nensure such signage is understandable for non-English \nspeaking people as well as those with low literacy, and \nprovide  clear  information  about  the  presence  of \nCOVID-19  cases  within  a  facility  and  the  need  to \nincrease  social  distancing  and  maintain  hygiene \nprecautions; \n•  Provide  a  no-cost  supply  of  and  access  to  soap  to \ndetained  persons,  sufficient  to  allow  frequent  hand \nwashing.  \n•  Provide  running  water,  hand  drying  machines  or \ndisposable paper towels for hand washing, and tissues \n(providing no-touch trash receptacles for disposal); \n•  Ensure that sufficient stocks of cleaning supplies are on \nhand and available, and have a plan in place to restock \nitems as needed, including tissues, cleaning supplies, \nand EPA-registered disinfectants effective against the \nvirus that causes COVID-19; \n•  Ensure  that  sufficient  stocks  of  personal  protective \nequipment (PPE) and medical supplies (consistent with \nthe healthcare capabilities of the facility) are on hand \nand available, and have a plan in place to restock as \nneeded if COVID-19 transmission occurs within the \nfacility, including standard medical supplies for daily \nclinic needs, and recommended PPE (facemasks, N95 \nrespirators, eye protection, disposable medical gloves, \nand disposable gowns/one-piece coveralls); \n•  Consider  relaxing  restrictions  on  allowing  alcohol-\nbased  hand  sanitizer  in  the  secure  setting  where \nsecurity  concerns  allow.

On May 15, 2020, the CDC released its first report on the extent of \nCOVID-19 outbreaks in correctional facilities across the country.51  Eighty-six \npercent of reporting jurisdictions had at least one confirmed case among \nincarcerated or detained persons or staff members.  In the report, the CDC cites \nnew data demonstrating that “symptom screening alone is inadequate to promptly \nidentify and isolate infected persons in congregate settings such as correctional and \ndetention facilities.”52  To supplement strategies of screening and isolation, the \nCDC recommends that correctional facilities should  implement additional \nstrategies to prevent and manage the spread of the virus, including by “physical \ndistancing,” “use of cloth face coverings,” “intensified cleaning,” “infection \ncontrol training for staff members,” and “disinfection of high-touch surfaces in \nshared space.”53 \n102.

Medical experts have made clear that the need for action is urgent and \nthat the window of opportunity is narrowing to reduce the spread of outbreaks in \njails.  Given the Defendants’ failure to take reasonable steps to respond to the \nthreat of the virus, detainees and staff at the Clayton County Jail are at grave risk \nof death or serious illness in the absence of court-ordered relief.   Each day the jail \ncontinues to operate as described in this complaint will increase the likelihood of \nillness and death for detainees, jail staff, and people in the community.   \nC.  Defendants Have Failed to Respond Reasonably to the Known Risk \nof a COVID-19 Outbreak in the Clayton County Jail. \n110.  Each Defendant is actually aware of the risk posed by COVID-19 and \nthe dangers of large outbreaks in detention facilities.  Each Defendant is actually \naware of the conditions in the Clayton County Jail and the risks posed by those \n \n44 \n\nconditions in light of COVID-19, through their personal observations of the jail’s \nhousing units and operations, communications with staff members and detainees, \nand reviews of detainee grievances and other records. \n111.  Defendants are actually aware of the risks posed by COVID-19, \nthrough their personal review of coronavirus-related documents published by \nentities such as the CDC and the National Institute of Corrections. \n112.  Numerous detainees submitted written grievances related to the \nDefendants’ failure to mitigate the risk posed by COVID-19.  The Defendants are \naware of detainees’ grievances including but not limited to the following. \na.  On May 14, J.P.77 stated that he was concerned about not \nhaving a face mask and asked jailers “we have one towel that \nwe dry off with and we are to wear that on our face?”   \nb.  On May 15, C.C. wrote that he had congestive heart failure, \nwas confined to an overcrowded cell, and had not been issued a \nprotective mask.   \nc.  On May 16, B.T. stated that he lacked “proper cleaning \nchemicals for [his] cell,” noted “no proper social distancing,” \n \n77 Plaintiffs are using initials instead of full names to protect the privacy of third \nparties. \n \n45 \n\nand voiced concern that detainees had to “make [their] own \nprotective mask.”   \nd.  On May 16, T.J. stated that there were no cleaning or \ndisinfectant supplies being distributed and stated that there was \nimproper “screening of bunkmates after one is found with \n[COVID-19] symptoms.”   \ne.  On May 17, D.H. stated “I have . . . been appointted [sic] \ninmate worker, but have not receive[d] a face mask[.] (I wear a \ndirty torn towel on my face).” \nf.  On May 18, Q.W. stated that no cleaning supplies were being \ndistributed.  He added that “sick inmates don[’]t [receive] \nmedical attention in [a] timely manner.”   \ng.  On May 19, Q.T. stated that he was tested for COVID-19 on \nMay 4 and sent back to his dorm before receiving the test \nresults.  He learned that he had tested positive on May 19.   \nh.  On May 22, C.S. wrote that “We have not been given an[y] \ninfo. related to COVID 19” and noted that he had no access to \nmasks or cleaning supplies.  He added: “RESOLUTION, I \nREQUEST TO ADDRESS THIS MATTER A.S.A.P. \n \n46 \n\nBECAUSE MY LI[F]E AND OTHER INMATES LIVES \nAR[E] IN JEOPARDY.” \ni.  On May 29, M.M. stated “I have been from top to bott[o]m of \njail and have yet to receive a mask, the living conditions here \nare terrible, it is very unsanitary[.] [T]here are never no \nchemicals no bleach, I sleep on floor T [sic] toilet and I wake \nup daily with my mat floating in fec[e]s water.” \nj.  On May 29, J.B. wrote that he tested positive for COVID-19 \nand did not receive necessary medical attention. \nk.  On May 31, A.H. wrote that he was “scared for [his] life” \nbecause “conditions in this jail” are “really dangerous.” \nl.  On May 31, A.B. noted that many “inmate workers” had tested \npositive for COVID-19, that he had no face mask, and that “the \nstaff here is not taking this pandemic serious[ly].” \nm.  On June 1, D.J. wrote “this grievance is being submitted due to \nC.C.D.C. failure to follow Covid-19 guidelines and \nregulation[s,] which are placing myself and others lives in \njeopardy.”  \n \n47 \n\nn.  On June 1, Q.T. wrote that he worked in an area where people \ninfected with COVID-19 were quarantined.  He stated “[f]or a \nfull week Ive asked an officer on every rank from co to lt for [a] \nprotective mask but nobody has helped me out.”   \no.  On June 1, J.G. expressed concern about “the Covid-19 \noutbreak amongst the inmates in dorm D-7” and asked for \nsupplies to clean the bunks of infected people. \np.  On June 3, K.R. wrote that the jail’s “failure to follow Covid-19 \nguidelines” placed his life in jeopardy. \nq.  On June 4, J.I. stated that “[n]othing has changed in spite of \nCovid 19,” “[o]ur cells are seldom cleaned,” and that phones \nand kiosks were seldom sanitized. \n113.  In response to a public records request, the Sheriff’s Office provided \nundersigned counsel with 28 grievances related to COVID-19, dated between April \n1 and June 5.  For 21 of those 28 grievances, no one from jail staff appears to have \nresponded to the detainee. \n114.  There are certain concrete, feasible actions that Defendants could take \nto prevent the rapid spread of the coronavirus.  A jail must take reasonable steps \nnecessary to promote social distancing, ensure sanitation of shared surfaces, and \n \n48 \n\nachieve early detection and isolation of suspected COVID-19 cases to limit the \nnumber of people exposed to the virus.  Many of these measures are recommended \nby the CDC and were implemented months ago in other jails across the state.   \n115.  Defendants, however, have not taken steps reasonably aimed to \nmitigate the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in the Clayton County Jail.  Three \nmonths into a global pandemic that has killed over 120,000 Americans and two \nmonths into a known outbreak within its facility, the jail continues to be run in all \nmaterial respects exactly how it was run six months ago.   \n116.  In particular, Defendants have failed to respond reasonably in at least \nfive ways.  First, Defendants have failed to take reasonable steps to ensure \neffective social distancing.  Second, Defendants have failed to provide minimally \nadequate sanitation and personal hygiene.  Third, Defendants have failed to \nprovide adequate protective equipment.  Fourth, Defendants have failed to \nadequately identify and respond to COVID-19 cases.  Fifth, Defendants have failed \nto provide information to detainees about avoiding infection.   \n \n49 \n\n1.  Defendants continue to house three or four detainees in two-\nperson  cells  and  have  made  no  effective  effort  at  social \ndistancing. \n117.  It is widely understood that social distancing “is a cornerstone of \nreducing transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19.”78   \n118.  Defendants have failed to make reasonable efforts to achieve social \ndistancing at the Clayton County Jail.      \n119.  First, Defendants have failed to make reasonable efforts to reduce the \njail population.  As of June 4, 2020—nearly three months after the Governor of \nGeorgia declared a public health emergency—the Clayton County Jail was \noperating at 96 percent capacity, with 1,847 detainees confined in the jail designed \nfor 1,920 according to the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.  By a \nsubstantial margin, that is the highest population recorded by the Department for \nthe month of June since 2015.  It is over thirteen percent higher—and includes \nmore than 220 more detainees—than the average population recorded for the \nmonth of June across the previous five years.   \n \n78 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management \nof Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n4 (Mar. 23, 2020). \n \n50 \n\nClayton County Jail Capacity in June: 2015 to 2020\n100.0%\n95.0%\nActual\nPercentage of\n90.0% Capacity\nAverage\n85.0%\nPercentage of\nCapacity (2015-\n2019)\n80.0%\n75.0% Source: Ga. Dep't of \nCommunity \nSupervision Jail \nReports, June 2015 \nto June 2020 \n \n120.  The Clayton County Jail’s population density is not an unavoidable \nconsequence of the pandemic or outside of Defendant Hill’s ability to ameliorate.  \nOther jails in Georgia have responded to the pandemic by substantially reducing \ntheir populations so that they operate well below normal levels and provide the \nspace and services needed to effectively prevent outbreaks of COVID-19.   \n121.  Between March 5 and May 7, 2020, the total population-to-capacity \nratio for all Georgia jails fell from 77 percent to 57 percent statewide.  Thus, many \njurisdictions responded to the pandemic by ensuring that their jails were operating \nwell below capacity to facilitate social distancing.  By contrast, the Clayton County \nJail is operating well above the number of people for which it can implement \neffective social distancing.    \n \n51 \n\n122.  Defendant Hill has authority to release certain detainees from the jail \nin light of the serious risk of harm posed by COVID-19.  For example, Georgia law \nallows sheriffs to award credit for good behavior to certain detainees serving \nsentences for misdemeanors or felony probation violations.  See, e.g., O.C.G.A. § \n42-4-7(b).  Sheriffs also have authority to release detainees to home confinement \nunder certain circumstances.  See, e.g., O.C.G.A. § 42-1-8. \n123.  As a result of a pre-pandemic policy decision, Defendant Hill does not \nconsider early release for most of the detainees eligible under state law for early \nrelease.  In January 2014, Defendant Hill posted a notice on social media that his \noffice was “removing ‘good time’ [credits] to keep criminals off the street \nlonger.”79  He instead decided to limit opportunities for early release to the \nrelatively small number of detainees assigned to work details or, in the alternative, \n“rare discretional circumstances.”80 \n124.  Defendant Hill continues to adhere to his policy of refusing to \nconsider early release for most of the detainees otherwise eligible.  On March 16, \n2020, Valerie L.

She asked, “Are you all releasing anyone from the jails[?]” The next \nday, Defendant Hill responded, “We are not releasing anyone from jail unless they \nare being bonded out.” \n125.  Instead of attempting to reduce the jail’s population, Defendant Hill \nhas taken steps to increase it.  After the tragic shooting death of seven-year-old \nGabriel Vasquez on April 11 in the Conley area of Clayton County, Defendant Hill \nstated “that all criminals in a 5 mile radius of the shooting would incur the wrath of \nthe Sheriff’s Office until the shooter is found.”81  Two months later, the Sheriff’s \nOffice had made over 500 arrests within the “5 mile radius” Defendant Hill chose \nto target.  \n126.  During the course of the global pandemic, employees of the Clayton \nCounty Sheriff’s Office and other local law enforcement entities have continued to \narrest and book people for minor offenses, even where arrest is not required by \nlaw.  They have done so knowing that some such persons will have bond amounts \nset that they are unable to pay.  Some people arrested for minor offenses are jailed \nfor weeks or months only because they cannot afford to pay bail.  To take only a \n \n81 See Clayton Cty. Sheriff’s Office Advisory, May 6, 2020, https://local.nixle.com \n/alert/7980002. \n \n53 \n\nfew examples, detainee T.S. has been jailed 27 days for jaywalking and disorderly \nconduct, with bail set at $2,400.  Detainee J.P. has been jailed for 26 days for \ndisorderly conduct, with bail set at $1,300.  Detainee G.Y. has been jailed for 30 \ndays for shoplifting, with bail set at $2,400.  Detainee H.D. has been jailed for 89 \ndays for criminal trespass, with bail set at $2,400.  And detainee T.L. has been \njailed for 176 days for public drunkenness, with bail set at $1,300.           \n127.  In short, in the middle of a pandemic understood by jailers across \nGeorgia to necessitate reducing jail populations below normal levels, Defendants \nare doing the opposite by intentionally detaining substantially more people than \nusual. \n128.  Due in part to Defendant Hill’s actions and failures to act, the jail’s \npopulation size is not being managed effectively during the outbreak.  This poses \nespecially great danger to people who are medically vulnerable or have \ndisabilities—people for whom exposure to the coronavirus creates much higher \nrisk of serious illness and death.   \n129.  In addition to failing to release eligible detainees, Defendants have \nfailed to take other reasonable steps to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infections in \nlight of the number of people in custody.  Defendants consistently staff the jail \nwith too few officers.  Given the current jail population, officers are responsible for \n \n54 \n\nsupervising far more detainees than they can effectively manage. Defendants’ \nunderstaffing of the jail has resulted in ongoing failures to ensure that high-traffic \nareas are sanitized, that detainees are informed about the risks of COVID-19 and \nprevention measures, that detainees avoid congregating in close proximity, that \ndetainees who are sick are promptly removed from housing units and evaluated by \nmedical staff, and that other basic mitigation steps are followed.     \n130.  The jail’s only apparent effort at promoting social distancing is \nunreasonable: the jail reduced to 12 the number of people who can leave their cells \nduring each rotation of “free time” in a pod’s day area.  But that solution ignores \nCDC guidelines because Defendants permit those 12 people to congregate during \ntheir hour out-of-cell, including playing card games, watching television, and using \ntelephones in close proximity to one another.   \n131.  Indeed, the jail’s policies require that detainees congregate in close \nproximity every single day in order to obtain food and medicine.  For instance, in \nmost pods, detainees are required to leave their cells in groups of 24 or more and \nline up in close proximity in order to be issued their noon meal (which they then \neat in their cells with up to three cellmates).  Likewise, detainees with medical \nprescriptions are required to leave their cells as a group and line up in close \nproximity for “pill call” to receive their medications.  When detainees go to sick \n \n55 \n\ncall—the designated time for medical staff to examine and treat detainees—they \nwalk to the medical unit as a group, often with other detainees from their housing \nunit of up to 288 people, but jail staff make no effort at enforcing social distancing.  \nWhen detainees arrive at the medical unit, they are usually placed inside of a \nholding area with detainees from other housing units, where they wait to be called \nto see a nurse or medical provider.  When detainees go to video court, they are \ncrowded together in a small waiting area with no opportunity for physical \ndistancing. \n132.  With all of these requirements for detainees to interact directly and \nindirectly with other detainees, including detainees from other housing units, \nlimiting free time to 12 individuals at a time is plainly inadequate to mitigate the \nrisk that an infected detainee will spread the virus throughout the jail.   \n2.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  basic  sanitation  and \npersonal hygiene. \n133.  A second component of an effective COVID-19 response is to \nimplement “intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures” to promote “healthy \nhygiene practices.”82  However, Defendants have failed to take any reasonable \naction to improve sanitation and hygiene.   \n \n82 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management \nof Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n \n56 \n\n134.  Though there is some variation among the housing units as a result of \nindividual detainees’ ingenuity in improvising cleaning supplies and individual \nofficers’ willingness to provide limited supplies to detainees on request, people in \nmultiple housing units go weeks and sometimes months at a time with no \nopportunities to disinfect toilets, sinks, and other in-cell fixtures.   \n135.  The only “cleaning” done for cells on a regular basis is to sweep the \nfloors and sometimes provide a mop that is so filthy, it is more likely to spread \nthan prevent disease.   \n136.  Regardless of housing unit, the ability of detainees to clean and \nsanitize their living areas is so limited as to be meaningless.  For instance, showers, \ncommon area tables, telephones, kiosks, door handles, and other objects are \ncleaned by the “inmate workers” at irregular intervals, sometimes as infrequently \nas every one or two months.    \n137.  Defendants have not implemented an adequate or effective plan for \nmaintaining sanitation in the jail’s overpopulated housing units during the \npandemic.     \n \n9-10 (Mar. 23, 2020) (“Several times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and \nobjects that are frequently touched, especially in common areas.”). \n \n57 \n\n138.  The “inmate workers” are responsible for cleaning the common areas, \nincluding day rooms and showers. Jail staff permit them to make their own rules \nabout what items to clean, how often to clean them, and the manner in which to \nclean them.   \n139.  Each detainee is responsible for cleaning her or his cell, but, as \ndiscussed above, the only materials provided regularly are a broom and a dirty \nmop.  On rare occasions, detainees may convince a sympathetic detention officer \nor “inmate worker” to provide them with sanitizing chemicals, but Defendants do \nnot have any system in place for ensuring that minimally adequate cleaning \nsupplies are offered to detainees.   \n140.  Personal hygiene products are similarly restricted.  At best, detainees \nreceive approximately four ounces of liquid soap, toilet paper, and toothpaste once \nper week.  Frequently, toothpaste, toilet paper, or sanitary napkins are unavailable.  \nDetainees have to make the limited soap they are issued last for a week of showers \nand handwashing.  Lacking cleaning products, some detainees attempt to wipe \ndown their cells with their jail-issued soap, further limiting their ability to maintain \ngood hygiene. \n141.  Defendants have not taken steps to ensure that detainees have clean \nclothing and bedding.  Each detainee has one jumpsuit that she or he must wear for \n \n58 \n\nat least one week, and often a month or more, before being issued a clean \nreplacement.  Towels and washcloths are washed infrequently, sometimes not for \nmonths.  Linens often go missing for lengthy periods.  For example, as of late May, \ndetainees in multiple housing units had been without sheets for over two weeks.  \n3.  Defendants  have  failed  to  issue  reasonably  adequate \nprotective equipment. \n142.  In settings where effective social distancing is not possible, face \ncoverings reduce the risk that those who have COVID-19 will spread the disease to \nothers by limiting emissions of respiratory droplets.  For that reason, the CDC \n“recommends that everyone wear cloth face coverings when leaving their homes, \nregardless of whether they have fever or symptoms of COVID-19.”83 \n143.  To work effectively, face coverings must fully cover the nose and \nmouth, fit snugly against the sides of the wearer’s face so that there are no gaps, \nand be secured in a manner that prevents slipping.84 \n144.  Defendants have failed to ensure that detainees have adequate face \ncoverings or other protective equipment.   \n \n83 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Important Information About Your \nCloth Face Coverings, https://bit.ly/3gAe0gv. \n84 Id. \n \n59 \n\n145.  For the first two and one-half months of the pandemic, few detainees \nat the Clayton County Jail had jail-issued masks.  Instead of providing masks, \njailers verbally instructed detainees to cover their faces with towels or other cloth \nitems such as socks, underwear, a t-shirt, or a torn-off section of bedsheet.   \n146.  To give one example, in May 2020, Plaintiff Randolph Mitchell, age \n72, asked an officer for a mask.  The officer told Mr. Mitchell that he could not \nhave a mask because he was not a trustee.  Afraid of getting sick, Mr. Mitchell \n“purchased” an improvised mask made out of underwear from another detainee in \nexchange for two packets of soup.  Similarly, in May 2020, former detainee M.B., \na 68-year-old woman who recently underwent chemotherapy for breast cancer, \nasked officers and nurses for a face mask.  No mask was provided.  M.B. instead \nused a torn piece of jail-issued underwear to try to protect herself from the virus.  \nDetainees like Mr. Mitchell and M.B. are given no guidance about how to make, \nuse, and wash an improvised face covering.   \n147.  Starting only in early June—two and one-half months into the \npandemic, and in anticipation of this litigation—the jail began to provide masks to \na limited number of additional people.  The masks are made of a thin paper-like \nmaterial.  They are not consistently replaced or cleaned when they break or \n \n60 \n\nbecome soiled.  There are still numerous detainees who have never been provided \na mask by jail staff.   \n148.  Defendants’ approach to providing face coverings is objectively \nunreasonable and inadequate.  Using a face covering is a safe practice only insofar \nas the covering is not contaminated with a virus, bacteria, or other agent that will \nmake the wearer sick.  The CDC thus recommends that face coverings be washed \n“after each use,” be “completely dry” before use, and be handled carefully when \ntouching it to avoid cross-contamination from a person’s hands to the mask.85   \n149.  Suggesting that detainees cover their faces with the same towels they \nuse over the course of a week for showering is objectively unreasonable because a \ntowel that a person uses throughout the week for showering will not be clean and \ndry when the person uses it.  And expecting detainees to craft a functional mask \nout of towels and undergarments, with no instruction regarding how a mask should \nfit or how it should be used and washed, is objectively unreasonable because a \ndirty or poorly fitting mask cannot effectively serve its purpose.   \n \n85 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, How to Safely Wear and Take Off a \nCloth Face Covering, https://bit.ly/2BgJPe6. \n \n61 \n\n4.  Defendants have failed to implement a process for identifying \nmedically  vulnerable  and  disabled  people  and  taking \naffirmative steps for their protection. \n150.  As discussed above, a number of conditions, a subset of which are \nalso “disabilities” pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nRehabilitation Act, increase the risk of serious illness or death if a person is \nexposed to COVID-19.  One high-risk group consists of people aged 55 or older.  \nIn addition, people diagnosed with asthma, diabetes, hemoglobin disorders, \ndisorders compromising the immune system, kidney disease requiring dialysis, \nliver disease, lung disease, serious heart conditions, or who are pregnant all face a \nsubstantially higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19. \n151.  A large number of people in the Clayton County Jail have disabilities \nthat increase their risk of serious illness or death if they are exposed to COVID-19.  \nAlthough the exact number of these individuals is presently unknown, it likely is \nhigh, as approximately 40 percent of all jail detainees nationwide have chronic \nmedical conditions, many of which constitute “disabilities” under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  Several of the medical conditions \nthat make detainees medically vulnerable to COVID-19—such as asthma and \ndiabetes—are common among jail detainees generally.   \n \n62 \n\n152.  Defendants are aware that a large number of Clayton County Jail \ndetainees have medical conditions or disabilities that make them uniquely \nvulnerable to serious illness or death should they become infected.  However, \nDefendants have taken no meaningful action to address the risk of COVID-19 \ninfections among medically vulnerable detainees.  Defendants do not attempt to \nidentify the medically vulnerable, and they do not provide sufficient protections for \nthese individuals.  Instead, Defendants continue to house medically vulnerable \ndetainees, including people with disabilities, in the same conditions as all other \ndetainees, usually in unsanitary three-person cells with no meaningful effort at \nsocial distancing or other disease-prevention measures.  \n153.  Because COVID-19 poses an increased threat of severe illness and \ndeath to medically vulnerable people, and circumstances at the Clayton County Jail \nmake further spread of the disease highly likely, no set of conditions can \nadequately protect members of this class.  Public health experts recommend \nrapidly releasing people most vulnerable to COVID-19 from custody.  Release not \nonly protects the most vulnerable people from being infected with the virus, but \nalso eases crowding, thereby allowing for greater risk mitigation for people held or \nworking in a jail, and the broader community.  Release of the most vulnerable \npeople from custody also reduces the burden on the region’s health care \n \n63 \n\ninfrastructure by reducing the likelihood that an overwhelming number of people \nwill become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time. \n154.  As of June 8, 2020, the Clayton County Jail—based on testing fewer \nthan 150 detainees—had 32 confirmed cases of detainees with COVID-19, more \nthan 20% of those tested. Yet the jail population was at 96 percent of capacity on \nJune 4, 2020, with most cells housing three detainees. \n155.  Immediate release of medically vulnerable Plaintiffs and class \nmembers is a necessary public health intervention.  Release is needed both to \nprevent irreparable harm to at-risk individuals and to reduce the jail’s population to \na level sufficient to ensure effective physical distancing, thereby reducing the risk \nof transmission for all class members and the wider public. \n156.  Until such time as they are released, Plaintiffs and other medically \nvulnerable detainees must be provided with enhanced protections to mitigate their \nrisk of contracting COVID-19.  Despite clear guidance from public health \nauthorities and the CDC that these prisoners are at a significant risk, Defendant \nHill and other defendants are not taking any of a number of possible steps to even \nattempt to protect this vulnerable population, such as: \n•  Prohibiting housing medically vulnerable people in open \ndormitory housing units; \n \n64 \n\n•  Ensuring medically vulnerable people are housed in single \ncells; and \n•  Implementing long-term staff assignment by test-confirmed \nnegative staff to prevent staff-prisoner transmission. \n5.  Defendants have failed to implement a reasonable process for \nidentifying, testing, and isolating COVID-19 infections. \n157.  The Georgia Department of Public Health emphasizes that “[a]ll \ncorrectional and detention facility personnel should be preparing for the possibility \nof a COVID-19 outbreak within their facility,” and “[a]ll employees should be on \nhigh alert for potential COVID-19 cases within their population.”86 “Facilities \n  \nshould take steps to isolate symptomatic inmates/detainees IMMEDIATELY.”87  \nDetainees who display symptoms of infection must be placed in medical isolation, \nand those who have been in close contact with an infected patient must be placed \nin quarantine.88 \n158.  The CDC recommends that all individuals in quarantine be \n“monitored for COVID-19 symptoms twice per day, including temperature \n \n86 Ga. Dep’t of Public Health, Interim Guidance for Management of COVID-19 in \nCorrectional  and  Detention  Facilities  in  Georgia  1  (Apr.  15,  2020), \nhttps://bit.ly/3bvwECh. \n87 Id. \n88 Id. at 1-2. \n \n65 \n\nchecks.”89  The CDC further recommends “daily temperature checks in housing \nunits where COVID-19 cases have been identified, especially if there is concern \nthat incarcerated/detained individuals are not notifying staff of symptoms.”90 \nDefendants do not have any process for proactively identifying COVID-19 \ninfection among detainees.  Although jailers have quarantined certain pods where \ndetainees have exhibited COVID-19 symptoms (keeping both people who tested \npositive and people who tested negative in the same housing area and, in some \ncases, in the same cell), there is no proactive effort to check detainees’ \ntemperatures in units where COVID-19 cases are suspected by jailers.   \n159.  Reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and receiving medical care for \nthose symptoms requires detainees to file a request for medical care electronically \nusing a kiosk system; yet, Defendants often prevent that from occurring.  For \nexample, in late May, M.B., a woman in Housing Unit 3, was experiencing \nsymptoms consistent with COVID-19 and wanted to see medical staff, but she \ncould not submit a sick call request because jailers restricted her kiosk access as \npunishment for a disciplinary infraction.       \n \n89 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management \nof Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n21 (Mar. 23, 2020). \n90 Id. at 22. \n \n66 \n\n160.  Many detainees lack access to kiosks because their housing units do \nnot have them, because they are restricted to their cells, or because they have been \ndenied use of a kiosk as punishment.   \n161.  When those detainees report COVID-19 symptoms and other medical \nproblems to officers, the officers frequently ignore them.   \n162.  When detainees are able to use the kiosk to report COVID-19 \nsymptoms, the medical and security staff often take three or four days to respond.  \nIn the meantime, detainees remain in their housing units, exposing others in those \nunits to a risk of infection.   \n163.  After a detainee exhibits symptoms of the virus, Defendants have no \nprocedure for determining which detainees have been in close contact with the sick \ndetainee and then testing them.   \n164.  In addition, there is no procedure to ensure that the cell and bed that \nthe sick detainee occupied will be sanitized before a new detainee is assigned to \nthat cell and bed.  \n165.  For example, in late April, multiple people in one of the open \ndormitories became seriously ill, with symptoms including coughing, fever, and \nvomiting.  The sick detainees remained in the open dormitory for over a week \nbeing moved to the infirmary.  Apart from spraying the sick detainees’ bedding \n \n67 \n\nwith an unidentified cleaning product, staff did nothing to sanitize the dormitory, \nand instead assigned other detainees to occupy those beds.  Several additional \ndetainees in that dormitory have since experienced symptoms consistent with \nCOVID-19. \n166.  In mid-May, R.S., a man in Housing Unit 7, experienced symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19, including a high fever, body aches, loss of appetite, \nand loss of his senses of taste and smell.  When the man complained to officers that \nhe had these symptoms and needed medical attention, the response was that there \nwas nothing officers could do and that the man should put in a medical request \nusing the kiosk.  The man’s cellmate submitted a medical request on his behalf.  \nFor three days, the man continued to seek help from officers, but he was not taken \nto the medical unit.  Three days after submitting a medical request and not \nreceiving a response, the man, with the assistance of his cellmate, was able to get a \nnurse’s attention during pill call.  The nurse sent the man back to his cell until late \nin the evening, when he was taken to the medical unit.  Jail staff did not provide \nthe man’s cellmate with instructions or equipment to sanitize his cell.  The \ncellmate resorted to using personal soap to clean the cell.  The cellmate was not \nassessed for COVID-19 symptoms. Soon thereafter, another prisoner was assigned \nto the bed that R.S. had vacated. \n \n68 \n\n167.  Similarly, in late May, a detainee in Housing Unit 8 complained of a \nfever, shortness of breath, and back pain.  The detainee and his cellmates informed \nofficers, but the officers did not respond.  It took two days for the man to be seen \nby medical staff, after which he was removed from Housing Unit 8.  Staff made no \neffort to clean the sick man’s cell or assess whether his former roommates had \nsymptoms of COVID-19.  Another prisoner was soon after assigned to the sick \nman’s bed. \n168.  Additionally, Defendants have failed to create and implement a \nsystem to adequately screen newly arrived detainees for COVID-19 and to \nquarantine each new arrival for a sufficient amount of time prior to placing that \nperson into the general population. \n169.  Defendants have also failed to create and implement a system to \nadequately track the prior contacts of persons who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 \nand to then remove those contacts from the general population. \n \n69 \n\n6.  Defendants have failed to educate detainees about COVID-\n19. \n170.  Another cornerstone of preventing and mitigating COVID-19 \ninfections in jails is to inform all detainees about the “symptoms of COVID-19,” \n“hand hygiene,” and the need to “report symptoms to staff.”91   \n171.  Defendants have provided no information to detainees about COVID-\n19.   \n172.  Around the same time that the Governor declared a statewide public \nhealth emergency, Defendants stopped allowing detainees to watch television news \nprograms.    \n173.  As a result of Defendants’ unreasonable failure to provide information \nto detainees, many detainees do not know the symptoms of COVID-19 or how to \nprevent infection. \nD.  Defendants Are Discriminating Against Detainees with Disabilities \nby  Failing  to  Provide  Reasonable  Accommodations  to  Reduce \nTheir Risk of Serious Illness or Death. \n174.  As defined below, the members of the Disability Subclasses have \n“disabilities” as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \n \n91 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management \nof Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n6 (Mar. 23, 2020).   \n \n70 \n\nRehabilitation Act that make them susceptible to serious illness or death if they \ncontract COVID-19, including people with asthma, diabetes, hemoglobin \ndisorders, disorders compromising the immune system, kidney disease requiring \ndialysis, liver disease, lung disease, and serious heart conditions. \n175.  All detainees in the Clayton County Jail are entitled to participate in \ntheir criminal court proceedings—if they are being detained prior to trial—and to \nserve the sentences imposed—if they have been convicted of a crime—in \nreasonably safe conditions.  To that end, the jail is required to provide adequate \nmedical care, food, and services to keep people alive and healthy until their cases \nare resolved and their sentences are completed. \n176.  The COVID-19 pandemic prevents members of the Disability \nSubclasses from resolving their court cases and completing their sentences.  Those \nwho become infected with COVID-19 may experience long-term debilitating \nsymptoms that prevent them from attending court appearances, and those who die \nfrom COVID-19 will never reach a resolution of their court cases or, for those \nserving sentences, complete the sentence imposed. \n177.  The conditions at the jail present a heightened risk to the Disability \nSubclasses and the Defendants are discriminating against the Disability Subclasses \nby not making reasonable accommodations.  \n \n71 \n\n178.  Defendants could provide reasonable modifications to their programs, \nservices, and activities to ensure that the members of the Disability Subclasses are \nadequately protected from COVID-19 infections.  The modifications could include \nreleasing individuals who qualify for release under state law, not requiring them to \nbe held in multi-person cells, providing more frequent and thorough cleaning of \ntheir living areas, issuing them adequate protective equipment, and similar \nmeasures.  However, Defendants have failed to make accommodations for \nmembers of the Disability Subclasses.  Defendants have accordingly discriminated \nagainst members of the Disability Subclass on account of their disabilities.     \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n179.  Plaintiffs bring this action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of themselves and six classes of similarly situated prisoners.   \n180.  Plaintiffs make the following class action allegations concerning the \nclasses and subclasses:  \nA.  Principal Pretrial Class \n181.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a Principal Pretrial Class defined as follows: \n“All persons who are now or will in the future be confined in the Clayton County \nJail who are not also being confined under a sentence of imprisonment.”  The \n \n72 \n\nPrincipal Pretrial Class will be represented by Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins, both of \nwhom are held in the Clayton County Jail awaiting trial. \n182.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) for the following \nreasons: \n(a)  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members of the \nclass is impracticable.  Plaintiffs expect to show that the \nclass consists of over half of the 1,900 people presently \njailed by Defendants, and an unknown number of people \nwho will be jailed by Defendants in the future pending trial \nor for other reasons not involving the service of a sentence \nof imprisonment.  As of May 7, 2020, 51 percent of the \nClayton County Jail’s detainees were being held pending \ntrial.  Further, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is \nunknown, meaning that there will be a steady stream of \nfuture class members.    \n(b)  There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  \nCommon  questions  of  fact  include  whether  the  class \nmembers’ living conditions increase their risk of COVID-\n19 infections.  Common questions of law include whether \n \n73 \n\nDefendants’ failures to ensure adequate social distancing, \nsanitation, and personal hygiene present a substantial risk \nof  serious  harm;  whether  Defendants  have  responded \nreasonably to the risk of harm created by conditions at the \nClayton  County  Jail;  and  whether  Defendants  have \nviolated the class members’ rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment Due Process Clause.  \n(c)  The policies and practices challenged in this action apply \nwith equal force to Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins and all \nmembers of the class so that Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins’ \nclaims are typical of those of the class.  Plaintiffs Jones \nand Watkins are subject to the same challenged policies \nand practices as the class members and face the same risk \nof harm as the class members. \n(d)  Plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.  Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins, the \nrepresentatives for the Principal Pretrial Class, possess no \ninterests  adverse  to  those  of  other  class  members.  \nPlaintiffs are represented by attorneys with the American \n \n74 \n\nCivil Liberties Union and the Southern Center for Human \nRights, both of which focus on protecting the rights of \npeople in the criminal legal system.  The attorneys have \nexperience in prison litigation and class action litigation \nand  have  devoted  substantial  resources  and  time  to \ninvestigating  this  case,  including  multiple  telephone \ninterviews with people in the jail and substantial document \ncollection and review.    \n183.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) because prosecuting \nseparate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.  In addition, \nprosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the \nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to \nprotect their interests. \n184.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that Defendants \nhave acted or failed to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \n \n75 \n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins seek to represent the class in challenging \nDefendants’ failures to provide safe conditions of confinement to people confined \nin the Clayton County Jail who are not under sentences of imprisonment.  Any \nprospective relief granted to Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins with respect to those \nmatters will necessarily benefit each member of the class.   \nB.  Principal Post-Adjudication Class \n185.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a Principal Post-Adjudication Class defined \nas follows: “All persons who are now or will in the future be confined in the \nClayton County Jail under sentence of imprisonment.”  The Principal Post-\nAdjudication Class will be represented by Plaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton, who \nare held in the Clayton County Jail under a sentence of imprisonment. \n186.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) for the following \nreasons: \n(a)  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members of the \nclass is impracticable.  Plaintiffs expect to show that the \nclass consists of over one-third of the approximately 1,900 \npeople presently jailed by Defendants, and an unknown \nnumber of people who will be jailed by Defendants in the \n \n76 \n\nfuture under sentences of imprisonment.  As of May 7, \n2020, 40 percent of the Clayton County Jail’s detainees \nhad been sentenced to imprisonment in state custody (6 \npercent)  or  county  custody  (34  percent).    Further,  the \nduration  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  unknown, \nmeaning that there will be a steady stream of future class \nmembers.    \n(b)  There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  \nCommon  questions  of  fact  include  whether  the  class \nmembers’ living conditions increase their risk of COVID-\n19 infections.  Common questions of law include whether \nDefendants’ failures to ensure adequate social distancing, \nsanitation, and personal hygiene present a substantial risk \nof serious harm; and whether Defendants have responded \nreasonably to the risk of harm created by conditions at the \nClayton  County  Jail;  and  whether  Defendants  have \nviolated the class members’ rights under the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments.  \n \n77 \n\n(c)  The policies and practices challenged in this action apply \nwith equal force to Plaintiff Mitchell, Plaintiff Singleton, \nand all members of the class so that Plaintiffs Mitchell’s \nand Singleton’s claims are typical of those of the class.  \nPlaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton are subject to the same \nchallenged policies and practices as the class members and \nface the same risk of harm as the class members. \n(d)  Plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.  Plaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton \npossess  no  interests  adverse  to  those  of  other  class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys with the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Center \nfor Human Rights, both of which focus on protecting the \nrights  of  people  in  the  criminal  legal  system.    The \nattorneys have experience in prison litigation and class \naction litigation and have devoted substantial resources \nand  time  to  investigating  this  case,  including  multiple \ntelephone interviews with people in the jail and substantial \ndocument collection and review.    \n \n78 \n\n187.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) because prosecuting \nseparate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.  In addition, \nprosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the \nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to \nprotect their interests. \n188.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that Defendants \nhave acted or failed to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs seek to represent the class in challenging Defendants’ failures \nto provide safe conditions of confinement to people confined in the Clayton \nCounty Jail under a sentence of imprisonment.  Any prospective relief granted to \nPlaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton with respect to those matters will necessarily \nbenefit each member of the class. \n \n79 \n\nC.  Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Subclass \n189.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a subclass defined as follows: “All \nindividuals in the Clayton County Jail, who are not under a sentence of \nimprisonment, whose age or medical conditions make them susceptible to serious \nillness or death if they contract COVID-19, specifically, people aged 55 or older, \nor people who have been diagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for, the \nfollowing conditions: \na.  asthma;  \nb.  cerebrovascular disease;  \nc.  chronic kidney disease;  \nd.  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease);  \ne.  cystic fibrosis;  \nf.  diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2);  \ng.  Serious heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery \ndisease, or cardiomyopathies) \nh.  hypertension;  \ni.  immunocompromised state (from solid organ transplant, blood or \nbone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of \ncorticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines);  \nj.  liver disease;  \nk.  neurologic conditions (such as dementia);  \nl.  obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher);  \nm.  pregnancy;  \nn.  pulmonary fibrosis;  \no.  sickle cell disease;  \np.  thalassemia.”92  \n \n92 According to the CDC, people with the following conditions are at increased risk \nof  severe  illness  from  COVID-19:  chronic  kidney  disease,  COPD, \nimmunocompromised  state  (from  solid  organ  transplant),  obesity,  serious  heart \nconditions, sickle cell disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  People with the other \n \n80 \n\n \n190.  The Medically Vulnerable Pretrial Class will be represented by \nPlaintiffs Jones and Watkins, both of whom are held in the Clayton County Jail \nawaiting trial. \n191.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) for the following \nreasons: \n(a)  The  class  meets  the  numerosity  requirement  because \njoinder  of  all  members  of  the  class  is  impracticable.  \nPlaintiffs expect to show that the class consists of over 100 \npeople  currently  confined  in  the  jail  and  an  unknown \nnumber of people who will be jailed in the future.  In April \n2020, the Clayton County Jail held a total of 739 chronic \ncare  patients,  and  Plaintiffs  expect  to  show  that  a \nsignificant number of those individuals were not under a \nsentence  of  imprisonment  and  had  conditions  making \nthem medically vulnerable to COVID-19.  The class is \nascertainable because the members’ medical conditions \n \nconditions listed above might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 \nbased on what is known at this time.  See CDC, Coronavirus Disease 2019, Who is \nat Increased Risk for Severe Illness?, https://bit.ly/2NKP34T.  \n \n81 \n\ncan  be  determined  by  reference  to  documents  in  the \npossession of Defendants.   \n(b)  There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  \nCommon  questions  of  fact  include  whether  the  class \nmembers’  living  conditions  and  preexisting  medical \nconditions increase their risk of COVID-19 infections and \nof  serious  illness  or  death  if  they  become  infected.  \nCommon questions of law include whether Defendants’ \nfailures to ensure adequate social distancing, sanitation, \nand personal hygiene present a substantial risk of serious \nharm; whether Defendants have responded reasonably to \nthe  risk  of  harm  created  by  conditions  at  the  Clayton \nCounty Jail; and whether Defendants have violated the \nclass members’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment \nDue Process Clause.   \n(c)  The policies challenged in this action apply with equal \nforce to Plaintiff Jones, Plaintiff Watkins, and all members \nof the class so that Plaintiffs Jones’s and Watkins’s claims \nare typical of those of the class.  Plaintiffs Jones and \n \n82 \n\nWatkins are subject to the same challenged policies and \npractices as the class members and face the same risk of \nharm as the class members.   \n(d)  Plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.  Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins possess \nno  interests  adverse  to  those  of  other  class  members.  \nPlaintiffs Jones and Watkins are represented by attorneys \nwith the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern \nCenter  for  Human  Rights,  both  of  which  focus  on \nprotecting the rights of people in the criminal legal system.  \nThe  attorneys  have  experience  in  prison  litigation  and \nclass  action  litigation  and  have  devoted  substantial \nresources and time to investigating this case, including \nmultiple  visits  with  people  in  the  jail  and  substantial \ndocument collection and review. \n192.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) because prosecuting \nseparate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.  In addition, \n \n83 \n\nprosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the \nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to \nprotect their interests. \n193.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that Defendants \nhave acted or failed to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins seek to represent the class in challenging \nDefendants’ failures to provide safe conditions of confinement to medically \nvulnerable people confined in the Clayton County Jail who have not been \nsentenced to incarceration.  Any prospective relief granted to Plaintiffs Jones and \nWatkins with respect to those matters will necessarily benefit each member of the \nclass. \nD.  Medically Vulnerable Post-Adjudication Subclass \n194.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a subclass defined as follows: “All \nindividuals in the Clayton County Jail, who are under a sentence of imprisonment, \nwhose age or medical conditions make them susceptible to serious illness or death \n \n84 \n\nif they contract COVID-19, specifically, people aged 55 or older, or people who \nhave been diagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for the following conditions: \na.  asthma;  \nb.  cerebrovascular disease;  \nc.  chronic kidney disease;  \nd.  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease);  \ne.  cystic fibrosis;  \nf.  diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2);  \ng.  serious heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, \nor cardiomyopathies) \nh.  hypertension;  \ni.  immunocompromised state (from solid organ transplant, blood or \nbone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of \ncorticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines);  \nj.  liver disease;  \nk.  neurologic conditions (such as dementia);  \nl.  obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 or higher);  \nm.  pregnancy;  \nn.  pulmonary fibrosis;  \no.  sickle cell disease;  \np.  thalassemia.” \n \n195.  The Medically Vulnerable Post-Adjudication Class will be \nrepresented by Plaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton, who are held in the Clayton \nCounty Jail under a sentence of imprisonment. \n196.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) for the following \nreasons: \n(a)  The  class  meets  the  numerosity  requirement  because \njoinder  of  all  members  of  the  class  is  impracticable.  \n \n85 \n\nPlaintiffs expect to show that the class consists of over 100 \npeople  currently  confined  in  the  jail  and  an  unknown \nnumber of people who will be jailed in the future.  In April \n2020, the Clayton County Jail held a total of 739 chronic \ncare  patients,  and  Plaintiffs  expect  to  show  that  a \nsignificant number of those individuals were in the jail \nunder  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  and  had  conditions \nmaking them medically vulnerable to COVID-19.  The \nclass  is  ascertainable  because  the  members’  medical \nconditions can be determined by reference to documents \nin the possession of Defendants.   \n(b)  There are questions of law and fact common to the class.  \nCommon  questions  of  fact  include  whether  the  class \nmembers’  living  conditions  and  preexisting  medical \nconditions increase their risk of COVID-19 infections and \nof  serious  illness  or  death  if  they  become  infected.  \nCommon questions of law include whether Defendants’ \nfailures to ensure adequate social distancing, sanitation, \nand personal hygiene present a substantial risk of serious \n \n86 \n\nharm; and whether Defendants have responded reasonably \nto the risk of harm created by conditions at the Clayton \nCounty Jail; and whether Defendants have violated the \nclass members’ rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.    \n(c)  The policies and practices challenged in this action apply \nwith equal force to Plaintiff Mitchell, Plaintiff Singleton, \nand all members of the class so that Plaintiffs Mitchell’s \nand Singleton’s claims are typical of those of the class.  \nPlaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton are subject to the same \nchallenged policies and practices as the class members and \nface the same risk of harm as the class members   \n(d)  Plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.

The \n \n87 \n\nattorneys have experience in prison litigation and class \naction litigation and have devoted substantial resources \nand  time  to  investigating  this  case,  including  multiple \nvisits with people in the jail and substantial document \ncollection and review. \n197.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) because prosecuting \nseparate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.  In addition, \nprosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the \nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to \nprotect their interests. \n198.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that Defendants \nhave acted or failed to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton seek to represent the class in \nchallenging Defendants’ failures to provide safe conditions of confinement to \n \n88 \n\nmedically vulnerable people confined in the Clayton County Jail who have been \nsentenced to incarceration.  Any prospective relief granted to Plaintiffs Mitchell \nand Singleton with respect to those matters will necessarily benefit each member \nof the class. \nE.  Disability Pretrial Subclass \n199.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a subclass defined as follows: “All \nindividuals in the Clayton County Jail who have not been sentenced to \nimprisonment and whose medical conditions make them susceptible to serious \nillness or death if they contract COVID-19, specifically, people who have been \ndiagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for, a medical condition which would \nqualify as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the \nRehabilitation Act.”  The subclass includes people with any of the conditions listed \nin paragraph 192, except those who are medically vulnerable solely because of age, \npregnancy, or BMI.  The Disability Pretrial Subclass will be represented by \nPlaintiffs Jones and Watkins, both of whom are held in the Clayton County Jail \nawaiting trial. \n200.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) for the following \nreasons: \n \n89 \n\n(a)  The  class  meets  the  numerosity  requirement  because \njoinder  of  all  members  of  the  class  is  impracticable.  \nPlaintiffs expect to show that the class consists of over 100 \npeople  currently  confined  in  the  jail  and  an  unknown \nnumber of people who will be jailed in the future.  In April \n2020, the Clayton County Jail held a total of 739 chronic \ncare  patients,  and  Plaintiffs  expect  to  show  that  a \nsignificant number of those individuals were not under a \nsentence  of  imprisonment  and  had  disabilities  making \nthem medically vulnerable to COVID-19.  The class is \nascertainable because the members’ medical conditions \ncan  be  determined  by  reference  to  documents  in  the \npossession of Defendants.   \n(b)  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, \nincluding whether Defendants have prevented the class \nmembers from benefiting from programs, services, and \nactivities  on  account  of  their  disabilities,  and  whether \nDefendants  have  failed  to  provide  reasonable \naccommodations for the class members’ disabilities.  \n \n90 \n\n(c)  The policies challenged in this action apply with equal \nforce to Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins and all members of \nthe class so that Plaintiffs Jones’s and Watkins’s claims \nare typical of those of the class.   Plaintiffs Jones and \nWatkins are subject to the same challenged policies and \npractices as the class members and face the same risk of \nharm as the class members. \n(d)  Plaintiffs and their counsel will adequately protect the \ninterests of the class.  Plaintiffs Jones and Watkins possess \nno  interests  adverse  to  those  of  other  class  members.  \nPlaintiffs are represented by attorneys with the American \nCivil Liberties Union and the Southern Center for Human \nRights, both of which focus on protecting the rights of \npeople in the criminal legal system.  The attorneys have \nexperience in prison litigation and class action litigation \nand  have  devoted  substantial  resources  and  time  to \ninvestigating  this  case,  including  multiple  visits  with \npeople in the jail and substantial document collection and \nreview. \n \n91 \n\n201.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) because prosecuting \nseparate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.

Disability Post-Adjudication Subclass \n203.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a subclass defined as follows: “All \nindividuals in the Clayton County Jail who have been sentenced to imprisonment \nand whose medical conditions make them susceptible to serious illness or death if \nthey contract COVID-19, specifically, people who have been diagnosed with, or \nare receiving treatment for, a medical condition which would qualify as a disability \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act.”  The subclass \nincludes people with any of the conditions listed in paragraph 192, except those \nwho are medically vulnerable solely because of age, pregnancy, or BMI.   The \nDisability Post-Adjudication Subclass will be represented by Plaintiffs Mitchell \nand Singleton, who are held in the Clayton County Jail under a sentence of \nimprisonment. \n204.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(a) for the following \nreasons: \n(a)  The  class  meets  the  numerosity  requirement  because \njoinder  of  all  members  of  the  class  is  impracticable.  \nPlaintiffs expect to show that the class consists of over 100 \npeople  currently  confined  in  the  jail  and  an  unknown \nnumber of people who will be jailed in the future.  In April \n \n93 \n\n2020, the Clayton County Jail held a total of 739 chronic \ncare  patients,  and  Plaintiffs  expect  to  show  that  a \nsignificant  number  of  those  individuals  were  under  a \nsentence  of  imprisonment  and  had  disabilities  making \nthem medically vulnerable to COVID-19.

The \nattorneys have experience in prison litigation and class \naction litigation and have devoted substantial resources \nand  time  to  investigating  this  case,  including  multiple \nvisits with people in the jail and substantial document \ncollection and review. \n205.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) because prosecuting \nseparate actions by individual class members would create a risk of inconsistent or \nvarying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would \nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the Defendants.  In addition, \nprosecuting separate actions by individual class members would create a risk of \n \n95 \n\nadjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the \nindividual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to \nprotect their interests. \n206.  Plaintiffs meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) in that Defendants \nhave acted or failed to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Singleton seek to represent the class in \nchallenging Defendants’ failures to provide reasonable accommodations to \ndisabled people confined in the Clayton County Jail who have not been sentenced \nto incarceration.  Any prospective relief granted to Plaintiffs Mitchell and \nSingleton with respect to those matters will necessarily benefit each member of the \nclass. \n \n96 \n\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT I \n \nUnconstitutional Punishment in Violation of the  \nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 / 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \n \nOn Behalf of the Principal Pretrial Class, Medically  \nVulnerable Pretrial Subclass, and Disability  \nPretrial Subclass Against All Defendants \n  \n207.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1 through 23 and 28 through \n206 as if fully set out herein. \n208.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, persons in pretrial custody cannot \nbe punished as part of their detention.  Punishment occurs if the Defendants’ \nconduct either is not rationally related to a legitimate, nonpunitive, government \npurpose or is excessive in relation to a legitimate, nonpunitive government \npurpose.  \n209.  Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs to unlawful punishment through \nacts and omissions that are not reasonably related to a legitimate non-punitive \ngovernment purpose or are excessive in relation to that purpose.  No legitimate \ngovernment purpose is served by unnecessarily subjecting pretrial detainees to an \nexcessive risk of exposure to and contracting COVID-19.  Nor is any legitimate \ngovernment purpose served by failing to address these risks. Exposing pretrial \n \n97 \n\ndetainees to an excessive risk of contracting COVID-19, and of serious illness and \ndeath for those who are medically vulnerable, is not rationally related to the \npurpose of pretrial confinement, which is to ensure the presence of a detainee at \ntrial. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendant to prevent \nthe continued violation of the rights of Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nPlaintiffs further seek a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243 \ndirecting Defendants to release or transfer the members of the Medically \nVulnerable Pre-Trial Subclass and Disability Pretrial Subclasses from the Clayton \nCounty Jail facility, to remedy ongoing violations of the federal rights of these \nclass members. \nCOUNT II \n \nUnconstitutional Conditions of Confinement in Violation  \nof the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 / 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \n \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs and Class  \nMembers Against All Defendants \n \n210.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1 through 23 and 28 through \n206 as if fully set out herein. \n211.  The coronavirus pandemic presents a substantial risk of serious harm \nto detainees’ health, safety, and lives.  Defendants’ failure to take adequate and \nreasonable steps to protect detainees from injury and death as described herein, and \n \n98 \n\nindeed their creation and implementation of policies that will increase the \nlikelihood that the virus will spread in the jail, violates contemporary standards of \ndecency.  \n212.  Defendants have plenary authority to prescribe conditions of \nconfinement in the Clayton County Jail and substantial authority to release certain \ncategories of detainees to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.    \n213.  Each Defendant is actually aware that the conditions in the jail present \na substantial risk of serious harm to detainees, and each Defendant has exhibited \ndeliberate indifference in the face of that risk by failing to take reasonable, \nnecessary, and easily available steps to reduce the risk of harm, violating the \nPrincipal Pretrial Class’s Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause right to safe \ncustodial conditions and the Principal Post-Adjudication Class’s Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishments. \n214.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 on behalf of themselves and the Pretrial and Post-Adjudication Classes to \nprevent further violations of their rights by Defendants.  Plaintiffs further seek a \nwrit of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243 directing Defendants to \nrelease or transfer the members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability \n \n99 \n\nSubclasses from the Clayton County Jail facility, to remedy ongoing violations of \nthe federal rights of these class members. \nCOUNT III \nViolations of the Americans with Disabilities Act  \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. / 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \n \nOn Behalf of the Disability Pretrial Subclass  \nand Disability Post-Adjudication  \nSubclass Against All Defendants \n \n215.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1 through 23 and 28 through \n206 as if fully set out herein. \n216.  Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., to provide a clear and comprehensive mandate for the \nelimination of discrimination against people experiencing disabilities and to \nprovide strong and consistent standards for identifying and addressing such \ndiscrimination.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)–(2). \n217.  The ADA is based on Congress’s finding that “discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities” is “a serious and pervasive social problem.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 12101(a)(2). \n218.  Title II of the ADA mandates that “no qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \n \n100 \n\nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130. \n219.  The ADA defines a “disability” as “a physical or mental impairment \nthat substantially limits one or more major life activities.”  42 U.S.C. § \n12102(1)(A). \n220.  Plaintiffs Jones, Mitchell, Singleton, and Watkins, and the members \nof the Disability Subclasses, are qualified individuals with disabilities, as that term \nis defined in the ADA, and are entitled to the protections of the ADA. \n221.  The ADA directed the Attorney General of the United States to \npromulgate regulations enforcing Title II of the ADA and provide guidance on \ntheir content.  42 U.S.C. § 12134.  The regulations that the Attorney General \npromulgated require public entities to “make reasonable modifications” to their \nprograms and activities “when the modifications are necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination.”  28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(7). \n222.  The regulations also specify that it is unlawful for a public entity to: \n(a) afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded to others; \nor (b) provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or \nservice that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same \n \n101 \n\nresult, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that \nprovided to others.  See 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(1)(ii)–(iii). \n223.  Defendants deny important services, programs, and activities that \nwould mitigate the risk of COVID-19 to Plaintiffs Jones, Mitchell, Singleton, and \nWatkins, and other members of the Disability Subclasses, solely by reason of their \ndisabilities. \n224.  Defendants have not permitted reasonable accommodations for \nPlaintiffs Jones’s, Mitchell’s, Singleton’s, and Watkins’s disabilities and have \ndiscriminated against the members of the Disability Subclasses in the provision of \nprograms and services. \nCOUNT IV \nViolations of the Rehabilitation Act  \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a) / 28 U.S.C. § 2241 \n \nOn Behalf of the Disability Pretrial Subclass  \nand Disability Post-Adjudication  \nSubclass Against All Defendants \n \n225.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1 through 23 and 28 through \n206 as if fully set out herein. \n226.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides: “No otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall solely by reason \nof his or her disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \n \n102 \n\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal Financial Assistance.”  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n227.  The regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nrequire that entities receiving federal financial assistance avoid unnecessary \npolicies, practices, criteria, or methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscriminating against persons with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i). \n228.  Defendants receive “Federal financial assistance” within the meaning \nof 28 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \n229.  Defendants deny important services, programs, and activities that \nwould mitigate the risk of COVID-19 to Plaintiffs Jones, Mitchell, Singleton, and \nWatkins, and other members of the Disability Subclasses, solely by reason of their \ndisabilities.  Defendants receive federal funds in connection with those services, \nprograms, and activities. \n230.  Defendants have not permitted reasonable accommodations for \nPlaintiffs Jones’s, Mitchell’s, Singleton’s, and Watkins’s disabilities and have \ndiscriminated against the members of the Disability Subclasses in the provision of \nprograms and services. \n \n103 \n\nCOUNT V \nPetition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Under 28 U.S.C.  \n§§ 2241 and 2243 for Confinement in Violation of the  \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans  \nwith Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act  \n \nOn Behalf of the Medically Vulnerable and  \nDisability Subclasses Against All Defendants \n \n231.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate paragraphs 1 through 23 and 28 through \n206 as if fully set out herein. \n232.  For the reasons discussed above, Defendants’ continued confinement \nof the members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses violates the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \n233.  Members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses are \nparticularly susceptible to infection, injury, and death from COVID-19.  As a result \nof their specific characteristics, there are no conditions of confinement that will \nadequately protect members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses \nfrom the risk of infection, serious injury, and death, even if Defendants could \nadequately reduce the risk of infection, injury, and death for individuals without \nmedical vulnerabilities by improving certain conditions.  \n \n104 \n\n234.  Continuing to confine the Subclass members in the Clayton County \nJail subjects them to a significantly higher risk of serious injury or death, relative \nto the general population, if they become infected with the coronavirus. \n235.  Defendants are therefore holding members of the Medically \nVulnerable and Disability Subclasses in custody in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment’s right to be free from cruel and unusual punishments; the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the Americans with Disabilities \nAct; and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n236.  Plaintiffs seek a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and \n2243 directing Defendants to release or transfer the members of the Medically \nVulnerable and Disability Subclasses from the Clayton County Jail facility, to \nremedy ongoing violations of the federal rights of these class members. \n \n105 \n\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully ask that this Court: \n(1)  Assume jurisdiction over this action; \n(2)  Certify this case as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure and appoint the undersigned as class counsel; \n(3)  Declare that Defendants are violating the federal rights of Plaintiffs \nand other class members;\n \n(4)  Enter  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  requiring \nDefendants to, among other things:  \n(a)  Release or transfer all Medically Vulnerable and Disability \nSubclass  Members  to  home  confinement  or  other  safe \nlocation, through an expedited process to be ordered by the \nCourt; \n(b)  Reasonably mitigate the conditions in the Clayton County Jail \nthat  facilitate  the  spread  of  COVID-19,  including  by \nimplementing social distancing measures, providing personal \nprotective equipment, and releasing certain detainees; \n(c)  Provide  safe  and  sanitary  conditions  of  confinement  to \nPlaintiffs  and  other  class  members,  with  heightened \nprotections for detainees who are susceptible to serious and/or \nfatal COVID-19 infections. \n(5)  Issue a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and \n2243 directing the immediate release or transfer of members of the \nMedically  Vulnerable  and  Disability  Subclasses  to  home \nconfinement or other safe location; \n \n(6)  Award Plaintiffs reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses, and costs of \nlitigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 12205, and other \napplicable law; and \n \n106 \n\n(7)  Award such other and further relief as this Court deems just and \nproper. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Ryan Primerano           \nKosha S.

See Lebron v. Sec’y, \nFla. Dep’t of Children and Families, 710 F.3d 1202, 1206 (11th Cir. 2013).  As set \nforth in the attached brief and exhibits, Plaintiffs meet the requirements for a \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19   Filed 07/27/20   Page 2 of 12\npreliminary injunction ordering relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12133; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ \n701 et seq.; and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243.  Specifically, Plaintiffs respectfully \nrequest that the Court enter an order with the following terms: \n1.  Defendants shall create and file with the Court reasonably specific and \ndetailed written plans—developed in consultation with the Georgia Department of \nPublic Health and/or a qualified medical or public health expert in preventing and \nmitigating the spread of infectious diseases—for addressing the following matters: \nA.  Educating detainees, staff members, contractors, and/or vendors \nabout COVID-19, including symptoms, the importance of \nsocial distancing and frequent hand washing, the proper use of \npersonal protective equipment, and other appropriate measures \nto prevent or mitigate the spread of the virus that causes \nCOVID-19, with this education continuing on a regular  and  \nas-needed basis as more information becomes available about \nthe virus; \nB.  Screening detainees, staff members, contractors, vendors, \nand/or visitors to the jail for symptoms of COVID-19 upon \nentry to the jail; \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19   Filed 07/27/20   Page 3 of 12\nC.

Plaintiffs shall file with the Court, within three days of Defendants’ \nfiling of the written plans discussed above, written responses to Defendants’ plans \nidentifying any areas in which Defendants’ proposed response is alleged to be \ninsufficient to prevent irreparable harm to detainees.  For any matter on which \nPlaintiffs disagree with the Defendants’ proposed remedial plan, Plaintiffs shall \npropose reasonably specific and detailed substitute measures.   \n3.  The Court will consider the parties’ submissions and will thereafter \nenter a renewed preliminary injunction that is narrowly drawn, extends no further \nthan necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and is \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19   Filed 07/27/20   Page 7 of 12\nthe least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.  See 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(2).

The names of all Clayton County Jail detainees who are eligible \nfor earned-time credit, home confinement, and/or other forms of \ndiscretionary release from the jail under the Sheriff’s control; \nand \nD.  For individuals held on one or more bond orders, Defendants \nshall identify those individuals who would be eligible \nimmediately for release if they paid the applicable bond \namounts. \n5.  Defendants shall create and file with the Court within seven days of a \npreliminary injunction order a reasonably specific and detailed written plan by \nwhich Defendants or their designees will review each detainee eligible for \ndiscretionary release by the Sheriff and determine whether to grant discretionary \nrelease to each eligible detainee.   \n6.  To further aid the Court’s evaluation of whether release and/or \nenlargement is appropriate relief for Plaintiffs and class members’ constitutional \nand irreparable injuries, Defendants shall create and file under seal with the Court \nwithin seven days of the date of a preliminary injunction order a list of all members \nof the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses that Defendants deem unsuitable for \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19   Filed 07/27/20   Page 9 of 12\nrelease under any circumstances.  The list must describe the asserted reason with \nreasonable specificity and identify the evidentiary basis for the asserted reason. \n7.  The parties shall jointly create and file under seal with the Court \nwithin 14 days of a preliminary injunction order a list identifying (a) all members \nof the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses that the parties agree are suitable for \nrelease by this Court; and (b) all members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses \nfor whom the parties cannot reach an agreement as to the suitability of release, \nalong with a concise statement explaining the bases of the parties’ disagreement. \n8.  Following receipt of the parties’ submissions pursuant to paragraphs 6 \nthrough 9, the Court will issue further orders setting forth a process to determine \nwhether the Court must release certain class members under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243; or under the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nRehabilitation Act, in order to ensure those persons are not in unreasonable risk of \ninfection from COVID-19.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant a preliminary injunction and writ of habeas corpus. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19   Filed 07/27/20   Page 10 of 12\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Jeremy Cutting            \nKosha S.

Because the crisis presents immediate and severe \nproblems for jails and prisons, federal courts around the country have had to \nconfront the pandemic’s unprecedented threat to incarcerated populations in order \nto preserve detainees’ fundamental rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  The specific conditions at issue in each lawsuit necessarily must be \nassessed on a case-by-case basis, with remedies tailored to the particular facts.  In \nthe present case, the evidence shows that there is a significant outbreak of COVID-\n19 at the Clayton County Jail, that the Jail’s conditions are egregiously deficient, \nand that Defendants are callously indifferent to protecting detainees from a deadly \nvirus.  Judicial intervention is essential to save lives. \nDespite the risks being evident for months, and an increasing number of \npositive cases in the Jail, Defendants have “taken little meaningful action to \nprevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the health and safety” of detainees.  \n   1   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 10 of 45\n(Rottnek Decl. ¶ 13.)1  Indeed, Defendants are taking actions that increase the \nlikelihood that detainees and staff will become infected:  \n•  Defendants have failed to identify and isolate infected persons, instead \nleaving them inside crowded cells where they spread the virus to others. \n•  Defendants have no functioning system to ensure that infected people \nreceive  prompt  medical  attention,  and  instead  instruct  sick  people  to \nsubmit a medical request, a process that delays medical intervention for up \nto a week.     \n•  Defendants have placed healthy persons into cells with people who are \nexperiencing fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, and other COVID-19 symptoms.  \n•  Defendants failed to provide facemasks to most detainees for a full three \nmonths, instead instructing detainees—including elderly and medically \nvulnerable  people—to  use  a  towel,  t-shirt,  sock,  or  underwear  as  a \nmakeshift facemask.  There remains no system for replacing and cleaning \nmasks, and not all detainees have been issued them.    \n•  Defendants have failed to provide even minimally adequate hygiene and \ncleaning supplies, such that detainees resort to using scraps of toilet paper, \nsocks, and their personal allotment of body soap to clean their cells.  The \nDefendants severely restrict soap distribution, providing detainees with \nonly a small amount of liquid soap per week for hand-washing, showering, \nand in-cell cleaning. \n•  Defendants have failed to identify detainees who are medically vulnerable \nand take necessary precautions to protect them against infection. \n•  Defendants  assign  healthy  detainees  to  beds  vacated  by  detainees \n \n1 Plaintiffs submit the declarations of 12 present or former detainees and 3 experts: \nNina Fefferman, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; \nFred Rottnek, M.D., a Professor of Medicine at Saint Louis University and the \nformer Medical Director of the Saint Louis County Jail; and Emmitt L. Sparkman, a \ncorrections consultant with more than 44 years of experience, including 11 years as \nDeputy Commissioner of Institutions for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. \n   2   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 11 of 45\nexhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 without making any effort to sanitize \nthe cell or bed.    \n•  Defendants require detainees to line up a foot or two apart from one \nanother during meal distribution, pill call, video court, and other activities. \n•  Defendants failed to provide any education or information about COVID-\n19 to detainees for a full three months of the pandemic, and to date have \nprovided no information to detainees about COVID-19 symptoms, the \nJail’s outbreak, or the importance of reporting symptoms to jail staff. \n•  Defendants have made no discernable effort to reduce the Jail’s population, \ncontinuing to house three detainees in most of the Jail’s two-person cells. \nDefendant Victor Hill and his subordinates, who operate the Jail and boast \npublicly of its harsh conditions, exhibit deliberate indifference to the risks of \nCOVID-19 despite a surge of positive cases in the Jail.  Public health agencies \nreport 72 infected detainees as of July 9, plus at least 13 infected staff members.  \n(Ex. G, Attach. 2, 3, 4, 9.)  Instead of responding reasonably to this threat to people \nin their custody, Defendants contend that no outbreak exists.  (Ex. K.)  Defendants \nignore warnings from public health agencies about COVID-19’s heightened risk in \njails and disregard basic precautionary steps such as social distancing, increased \npersonal hygiene, sanitizing surfaces and cells, aggressive testing, and wearing \npersonal protective equipment, such as clean masks.  As a result of Defendants’ \nconduct, conditions in the Jail pose an “unnecessary risk” to detainees and the \npublic.  (Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12-14.) \n   3   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 12 of 45\nTo remedy Defendants’ inaction and the resulting risk of harm to detainees, \nPlaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and two classes—the \nPrincipal Pretrial Class, and the Principal Post-Adjudication Class—encompassing \nall detainees confined in the Jail, seeking relief from unconstitutional conditions of \nconfinement.  (Doc. 1 ¶¶ 181-88; see id. ¶¶ 207-14.)  In addition, Plaintiffs seek to \nrepresent (1) Medically Vulnerable Subclasses of detainees whose age or medical \ncondition makes them especially vulnerable to the most severe consequences of \nCOVID-19, and (2) Disability Subclasses of detainees whose disabilities make \nthem especially vulnerable to the most severe consequences of COVID-19 and \nentitle them to the protections of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and \nthe Rehabilitation Act (RA).  (Id. ¶¶ 189-206; see id. ¶¶ 207-36.) \nPlaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction and writ of habeas corpus \nproviding the relief set forth in the accompanying motion and proposed order, \nincluding a written plan to mitigate COVID-19 in the Jail and proper monitoring to \nensure full implementation; preliminary steps toward releasing certain detainees, \nincluding identification of all members of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability \nSubclasses; and a plan for releasing medically vulnerable detainees.2  Without \n \n2 See, e.g., Martinez-Brooks v.

COVID-19 Presents a Substantial Risk of Severe Illness and Death \nto People in Jails. \nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious and deadly virus that presents an inherent \nrisk in jails, which are “incubators for the virus.”  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 15.)  In Georgia \nalone, COVID-19 has infected at least 80,000 people and killed more than 2,800.  \n(Doc. 1 ¶ 85.)  Those 55 and older or with underlying health conditions are most \nsusceptible.3  COVID-19 spreads rapidly via “droplets in the air” and may also be \ntransferred by “contaminated surfaces.”  (Fefferman Decl. ¶ 18.)  Strictly following \nCDC guidelines regarding COVID-19—including reducing the number of \ndetainees in congregate environments, promoting hygiene, providing face masks, \nand disinfecting surfaces often—is the best way to “mitigate the risk of infection \nand serious illness.”  (Rottnek Decl. 17-18; see also Sparkman Decl. ¶ 99.)  \n \nvulnerable inmates” and implement process to review them for home confinement).   \n3 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, People Who Are at Increased Risk for \nSevere Illness (June 25, 2020), https://bit.ly/3fVxXOb.    \n   5   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 14 of 45\nCongregate conditions in jails “foster[] easy transmission of COVID-19 \ninfection.”  (Fefferman Decl. ¶ 19.)  Daily staff ingress and egress as well as high \npopulation turnover also compound the risks of COVID-19 in jails, putting \ndetainees, staff, and the public at “unnecessary risk.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 9-14; see also \nSparkman Decl. ¶¶ 21, 95-97.) \nThe CDC has published guidance for detention facilities, which includes \ncommon-sense steps they can take to mitigate the risk of infection, including \npromoting intensified cleaning,  educating staff and detainees, providing cloth face \ncoverings, ensuring adequate amounts of hygiene supplies, and practicing social \ndistancing.4  CDC guidelines are considered an authoritative source by correctional \nadministrators, and adherence to the guidelines is critical.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 19-\n24.)  These measures, however, “are designed to manage and mitigate—not \ncompletely eliminate—the increased risk to jail populations.”  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ \n19.)  Public health professionals widely agree that “[t]he best chance for medically \nvulnerable [detainees] to survive . . . is to release them.”  (Id. ¶ 43.) \n \n4 U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n(Mar. 23, 2020), https://bit.ly/2BX2gES (hereinafter, “CDC Interim Guidance”); see \nalso U.S. Ctrs. for Disease Control & Prevention, Interim Considerations for SARS-\nCoV-2  Testing  in  Correctional  and  Detention  Facilities  (Jul.  7,  2020), \nhttps://bit.ly/2WDAvZv.   \n   6   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 15 of 45\nB.  Defendants Have Failed to Take Reasonable Steps to Prevent and \nMitigate COVID-19 Exposure in the Jail. \nFrom the beginning of the pandemic, Defendants have been aware of the \nrisks posed by COVID-19 and recommendations from public health experts about \ncontaining it.5  Defendants have largely ignored this clear guidance (Sparkman \nDecl. ¶¶ 24-96), allowing for significant spread of COVID-19 within the Jail \n(Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 16, 31).   \nThe Georgia Department of Public Health confirmed 32 COVID-19 \ninfections among Clayton County Jail detainees as of June 11, and 72 infections as \nof July 10.  (Ex. G, Attach. 2 & 9.)  The Clayton County Sheriff’s Office \nnonetheless claims publicly that “[t]here is no outbreak of COVID-19 in our \nfacility.”  (Ex. K.)  Consistent with this denial, Defendants have no apparent \nsystem to track the outbreak, and they regularly leave symptomatic people in \novercrowded cells, where sick people infect others.  (Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 24-31; \nSparkman Decl. ¶¶ 83-95; F.S. Decl. ¶¶ 23-27.)  Many detainees “have not been \ntested for COVID-19 . . . even though [they] had symptoms.”  (Singleton Decl. ¶ \n \n5 For example, on March 13, 2020—the same day the President declared a national \nemergency—internal  affairs  Captain  Eddie  Cross  emailed  all  five  Defendants \nwarning that prevention measures were needed to slow the spread of the virus and \nthat people with chronic medical conditions were at higher than normal risk of \nserious illness if infected.  (Ex. E; see also Ex. J.)   \n   7   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 16 of 45\n10.)  Still others are refused medical care for even severe symptoms and are not \nseparated from other detainees.  (W.M. Decl. ¶¶ 28-33; D.H. Decl. ¶¶ 13-25.)  \nDespite the spreading virus, people are directed to congregate in groups, with no \ndistancing, for pill call, meal distribution, video court, and in the medical unit.  \n(Sparkman Decl. ¶ 39-43.)  \nNumerous detainees have submitted declarations with this Court recounting \ntheir experiences in a jail in which Defendants failed to take reasonable steps in \nresponse to the known risks of the pandemic.  (Ex. D.)  The following are a few \nexamples showing Defendants’ unreasonable failure to act: \n•  W.L.M. is a 57-year-old man.  (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 2.)  In May, he was placed \nin a small cell with a man experiencing fever, difficulty breathing, and \ndiarrhea.  (Id. ¶ 18.)  The man was awaiting COVID-19 test results.  (Id. \n¶¶  18-19.)    W.L.M.  had  no  mask.  (Id.).    Within  days,  W.L.M.  had \ncontracted COVID-19; he could not hold down food or water, had severe \ndiarrhea,  and  “immense  difficulty  breathing.”    (Id.  ¶¶  21-28.)    He \nrepeatedly informed staff about his symptoms and was tested but was not \nisolated.  (Id.)  On a night when he could not breathe, “felt as if [his] lungs \nwere going to collapse,” and begged for help (id. ¶ 29), an officer told him \nto wait in his cell for six hours “until count,” at which time another officer \ntold him to wait hours longer “until free time” to submit a medical request.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 30-32.)  He was never called to the medical unit.        \n•  M.B. is a 52-year-old woman who recently underwent chemotherapy for \ncancer.  (M.B. Decl. ¶¶ 2, 12.)  In late May, M.B. asked an officer for a \nmask, but none was provided.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  M.B. tied a scrap of old, ripped \nunderwear around her face as a makeshift mask.  (Id.)  She became ill but \ncould not submit a request to see a medical provider because her electronic \nkiosk access was “on restriction.”  (Id. ¶ 19.) \n   8   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 17 of 45\n•  F.S. is a 27-year-old woman whose cellmate, C.H., experienced fever, \nvomiting, and coughing up blood in April.  (F.S. Decl. ¶¶ 2, 23-24.)  When \nF.S. sought help, an officer told C.H. to submit a medical request, but C.H. \nwas too sick to walk. (Id. ¶ 24.) When F.S. herself developed a fever, chills, \nsore throat, headaches, and vomiting, officers left both women in their \nhousing unit, where they continued to line up with other detainees during \nmeal and medication distribution.  (Id. ¶¶ 23-27.)  After submitting a \nmedical  request, F.S. waited a week to be seen by medical staff.  (Id. ¶¶ \n25-26.)  She was never tested for COVID-19.  (Id. ¶ 27.)  During her \nillness, she used a cut-up sheet as a mask.  (Id. ¶ 21.)   \n•  D.H. is a 28-year-old man who works as a trustee, or inmate worker, in the \nJail.  (D.H. Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.)  When other trustees in D.H.’s dorm began \ndisplaying  symptoms  consistent  with  COVID-19,  jail  officers  did  not \nimmediately remove them from the dorm and instructed them to continue \nworking around the Jail.  (Id. ¶¶ 13-15.)  D.H. became sick with similar \nsymptoms shortly thereafter.  (Id. ¶ 20.)  He reported his symptoms to a \nnurse but was sent back to his dorm.  (Id. ¶ 23.)  For the next two weeks, \ndespite being weak and actively symptomatic, D.H. was instructed to wrap \na towel around his face and continue distributing meal trays to detainees \nin other housing units.  (Id. ¶ 24.)  He later tested positive for COVID-19.  \n(Id. ¶ 26.) \n•  Similarly,  detainees  Mitchell  and  J.H.  each  placed  medical  requests \nseeking attention for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and  either \nwaited over a week before being seen by medical staff or were never seen \nat all.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶¶ 13-16; J.H. Decl. ¶¶ 30-31.) \n \nAlthough the CDC urges jails to educate detainees about the risks of \nCOVID-19, Defendants are not doing so.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 70-75.)  Detainees \nconsistently report that Defendants have made no effort to advise detainees about \ncoronavirus symptoms.  (F.S. Decl. ¶ 19; A.W. Decl. ¶ 32; M.B. Decl. ¶ 16.)  \nDefendants similarly disregard CDC recommendations to implement intensified \n   9   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 18 of 45\ncleaning of the Jail..  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 44-53.)  The Jail’s communal “showers \n[are] covered in black mold and rarely cleaned.”  (J.H. Decl. ¶ 13.)  “Many people \nuse the same telephones, showers, tables, and kiosks, without those items being \nsanitized between uses.”  (Jones Decl. ¶ 10; see also Singleton Decl. ¶ 4 (same).)  \nAlso, the Jail remains at nearly 100% capacity, and many detainees sleep on the \nfloor with their head “two feet from the toilet.”  (F.S. Decl. ¶ 9.)  Failing plumbing \nsystems result in detainees sleeping where toilet water leaks onto the floor, soaking \ntheir bedding.  (Watkins Decl. ¶ 20; Jones Decl. ¶ 6, 12; A.W. ¶ 10.).)   Cells \n“smell of feces” (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 11), have inoperable toilets (C.C. Decl. ¶ 17; \nA.W. Decl. ¶ 12), and are covered in mildew and mold.  (A.W. Decl. ¶¶ 13-16.)   \n“Given the seriousness and prevalence of COVID-19, any jail administrator \nwould understand the need for intensive sanitation measures during this time.”  \n(Sparkman Decl. ¶ 44.)  But the Jail has not taken any coordinated effort to \nintensify cleaning.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 51; Watkins Decl. ¶ 22; see also W.L.M. \nDecl. ¶ 13.)  Prisoners who want to clean their own living areas lack supplies, and \nresort to using bits of toilet paper, socks, and body soap for in-cell sanitation.  (See, \ne.g., Sparkman Decl. ¶ 48; Jones Decl. ¶ 11.)  While the provision of clean laundry \nis crucial to avoiding the spread of disease, laundering of personal items is not \nregular or timely at the Jail, and detainees often wait weeks or months before their \n   10   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 19 of 45\njumpsuits, towels, or sheets are laundered.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 62-64; Mitchell \nDecl. ¶¶ 10-11; W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 15; J.H. Decl. ¶ 20; Watkins Decl. ¶ 17-19.)  \nAlthough the CDC recommends making liquid soap readily available, soap at the \nJail is strictly rationed, even as disease spreads.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 56-58.)  \nDetainees are only allotted four ounces per week—equivalent to a motel-sized bar \nof soap—and there are weeks when none is available.  (J.H. Decl. ¶ 19; Watkins \nDecl. ¶ 15; A.W. Decl. ¶ 17; F.S. Decl. ¶ 14.)  Many detainees must use their \nweekly soap allotment for in-cell cleaning and laundry, in addition to personal \nhygiene.  (Singleton Decl. ¶ 6; Watkins Decl. ¶ 15.)6   \nThe CDC also recommends the use of masks to stop the virus’s spread, and \n“uniform mask use among detainees and staff would be an obvious and relatively \ninexpensive safeguard that any reasonable jail administrator would implement.”  \n(Sparkman Decl. ¶ 65.)  But until this litigation was filed, most non-trustee \ndetainees had no jail-issued masks.  (id. ¶ 67.)   Detainees were instead told to use \nmakeshift masks of spare towels, ripped-up underwear, and pieces of sheets—if \nthey have any—which are often unlaundered and potentially contaminated.  (Id.)  \n \n6 “At a jail where many people are testing positive for COVID-19 . . . any reasonable \ncorrectional  administrator  would  know  to  modify  the  procedures,  especially \nprocedures pertaining to the rationing of soap.”  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 54.)  \n   11   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 20 of 45\nMasks are not laundered, let alone laundered “routinely,” as recommended by the \nCDC.  (Id. ¶ 66 (quoting CDC Interim Guidance).) \nThe CDC recommends jails promote social distancing and yet Defendants \ndo just the opposite by compelling detainees every single day to line up one next to \nthe other to obtain meals and medications, even packing “approximately twenty” \npeople “side-by-side and back-to-back” for “video court.”  (Watkins Decl. at ¶ 11; \nSingleton Decl. ¶ 4; J.H. Decl. ¶ 32; Sparkman Decl. ¶¶ 39-42.)  Defendants also \nrefuse to release detainees who are eligible for home confinement or early release \n(see Ex. F) and routinely incarcerate people unable to purchase their release by \npayment of small bail sums.  \nThe Jail’s conditions are well known to each of the Defendants, all of whom \nhave worked at the Jail for years and enter the Jail’s housing units regularly.  In \naddition, multiple detainees have reported concerns about the Jail’s systematic \nfailure to ensure sanitary conditions, provide timely medical care, issue face \ncoverings and cleaning supplies, provide information about COVID-19, or screen \nfor COVID-19.  (Ex. I.)  As detainee A.B. aptly noted in a grievance submitted on \nMay 31, “the staff here [are] not taking this pandemic serious[ly].”  (Ex. I.) \nDefendants’ failures to implement reasonable measures to mitigate the \ndanger of COVID-19 are “medically and epidemiologically unsupportable.”  \n   12   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 21 of 45\n(Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 22, 26, 30.)  Further, they are contrary to “the standards on \nwhich reasonable correctional administrators would rely in addressing the \npandemic.”  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 14.) These failures put all Plaintiffs—particularly \nthose in the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses, who are \n“predispose[d] to severe COVID-19 outcomes”—at heightened and “unnecessary \nrisk.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 3, 12.)  Named Plaintiffs are among those at an increased risk of \ndeath or severe, permanent injury.  Plaintiff Jones is 58 years old with Chronic \nObstructive Pulmonary Disorder.  (Jones Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  Plaintiff Watkins is a 60-\nyear-old diabetic.  (Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  And Plaintiff Singleton is a 59-year-old \nman with hypertension.  (Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 2, 7.)7 \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction should issue if the movants show: (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm absent an injunction; (3) a \nbalance of harms in their favor; and (4) that the injunction would not be adverse to \nthe public interest.  BellSouth Telecomms, Inc. v. MCIMetro Access Transmission \nSvcs., LLC, 425 F.3d 964, 971 (11th Cir. 2005).  \n \n7 Plaintiff Randolph Mitchell has been released from the Jail.   \n   13   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 22 of 45\nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Prevail on the Merits. \nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on each of their claims for relief.  First, the \nharmful conditions in the Jail fail to further any legitimate penological interest, \namounting to unconstitutional punishment of pretrial detainees.  Second, \nDefendants have been deliberately indifferent to the threat of COVID-19 by failing \nto take reasonable steps to mitigate the risk.  Third, the continued detention of \nmedically vulnerable detainees and detainees with disabilities constitutes unlawful \nconfinement, requiring a writ of habeas corpus with respect to those detainees and \nrelease to protect their constitutional rights.8  Fourth, Defendants have unlawfully \ndiscriminated against detainees with disabilities who are at higher risk of serious \nillness or death from COVID-19.    \nA.  Defendants Are Punishing Pretrial Plaintiffs in Violation of the \nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.  \nBecause pretrial detainees have not been convicted of a crime, the \nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause prohibits the government from \npunishing them.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979).  Punishment occurs \n \n8 As discussed below, Plaintiffs seek the release of medically vulnerable detainees \nand detainees with disabilities under two separate statutes: 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \n   14   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 23 of 45\n“when a condition of pretrial detention is not reasonably related to a legitimate \ngovernmental goal,” such as when jail conditions are “excessive in relation to the \nlegitimate purpose assigned to [them].”  McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F.3d 1554, 1564 \n(11th Cir. 1996); see Magluta v. Samples, 375 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2004) \n(holding complaint stated punishment claim where plaintiff alleged he was \n“confined under extremely harsh conditions . . . for no legitimate reason”).  \nAlthough Bell refers to an impermissible “purpose of punishment,” Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 538, “Bell’s focus on ‘punishment’ does not mean that proof of intent (or \nmotive) to punish is required for a pretrial detainee to prevail on a claim that his \ndue process rights were violated.”  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, 398 \n(2015).  Instead, Bell announced an “objective standard.”  Id.     \nHere, Defendants’ failure to take minimally adequate steps to prevent \nCOVID-19 infections lacks a connection to a “legitimate purpose.”  As reflected in \nPlaintiffs’ evidence, the Clayton County Jail is operating in a manner that risks \nspreading infections among the thousands of detainees and staff cycling through \nthe Jail, who then take the disease back to the community.  Defendants permit the \nJail’s living areas to become hubs for the virus’s spread, rarely if ever sanitizing \nthe surfaces of tables, telephones, kiosks, showers, and toilets used by numerous \ndetainees each day.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 44-53.)  Detainees lack basic supplies to \n   15   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 24 of 45\nclean cells—even cells  housing sick detainees—and they resort to using toilet \npaper, clothing items, and body soap to wipe in-cell surfaces.  (Id. 48-49.)  \nDefendants strictly ration hand soap in the midst of a global pandemic and a large \noutbreak at their own facility.  (Id. ¶ 54-61.)  Detainees are required to congregate \nfor meal distribution, pill call, and sick call, and are not consistently issued \nfunctional face coverings to limit person-to-person spread of disease.  And \ndetainees who report symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are often ignored.  \n(W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 29 (“[I]t felt as if my lungs were going to collapse. I could not \nbreathe. I began to bang on my cell door . . . no one was coming to help.”); M.B. \nDecl. ¶ 18 (“My chest feels tight and my body aches. I am having chills, I feel \nsweaty, and I am having shortness of breath . . . But I have not been able to see \nanyone on the medical staff”).)  \nJail officials’ “arbitrary and purposeless” decision to disregard experts’ \nguidance and ignore reasonable steps to protect detainees is disconnected from any \nlegitimate governmental interest and undermines the government’s compelling \ninterest in controlling the pandemic.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 520.  It cannot be justified \nby cost savings.  Certain steps—such as releasing eligible detainees, educating \ndetainees remaining in the Jail, and providing prompt medical attention to \nsymptomatic detainees—would involve little if any financial cost.  Other measures \n   16   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 25 of 45\nwould involve only modest expenditures that likely would be offset by reducing \nthe costs of caring for detainees who become ill.  At minimum, Defendants’ \ninaction is “excessive in relation to” any interest in limiting financial outlays.  See \nMcMillian, 88 F.3d at 1564.   \nIndeed, Defendants’ practices most plausibly project their desire to operate \nthe facility as “Georgia’s toughest para-military jail,”9 and thus appear calculated \nto achieve retribution and deterrence, which “are not legitimate nonpunitive \ngovernmental objectives” with respect to pretrial detainees.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at \n539 n.20.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of showing that, \nwith respect to pretrial detainees, the Jail’s conditions of confinement serve no \n“legitimate governmental purpose” and violate the Due Process Clause.  \nB.  Defendants Are Deliberately Indifferent to Plaintiffs’ \nConstitutional Rights.  \nGovernments have a constitutional duty to protect detainees from “a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).  \nThis right arises under the Eighth Amendment after conviction.  See Brown v. \nPlata, 563 U.S. 493, 510 (2011); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).  A \nfortiori, an Eighth Amendment violation also violates the rights of pretrial \n \n9  See,  e.g.,  Clayton  Cty.  Sheriff’s  Office  Advisory,  May  30,  2020, \nhttps://local.nixle.com/alert/8024208.  \n   17   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 26 of 45\ndetainees under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  See Goebert v. \nLee Cnty., 510 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir. 2007).  \nTo succeed on a claim of deliberate indifference, plaintiffs must show (1) a \ndeprivation that is serious, and (2) that prison officials acted with deliberate \nindifference.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.10 \n1.  The COVID-19 Pandemic Poses an Objective Risk of \nSerious Harm. \nPlaintiffs and other Clayton County Jail detainees face an objective risk of \nserious harm from COVID-19.  A “condition of confinement that is sure or very \nlikely to cause serious illness and needless suffering” to someone detained, which \nincludes “exposure of inmates to a serious, communicable disease,” is precisely the \ntype of serious harm against which the Constitution protects.  Helling v. McKinney, \n509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993).  \nCOVID-19 is a serious, communicable disease that poses a threat to all \ndetainees, especially those who are medically vulnerable.  (See, e.g., Fefferman \nDecl. ¶¶ 9-10; Rottnek Decl. ¶¶ 25-27, 43-44.)  Thus, courts have recognized that \nCOVID-19 poses an objective risk of serious harm.  See, e.g., Swain v. Junior, 961 \n \n10  Plaintiffs  preserve  the  argument  that  pretrial  detainees  need  only  make  an \nobjective showing under the deliberate indifference standard.  See Kingsley, 135 S. \nCt. at 2473-74.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that the Eleventh Circuit has taken a contrary \nview.  See Swain v. Junior, 961 F.3d 1276, 1285 n.4 (11th Cir. 2020). \n   18   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 27 of 45\nF.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir. 2020).  Dozens of Clayton County Jail detainees have \nbeen infected with COVID-19 over the past four months, and the virus is still \nspreading through the Jail.  The conditions in the Jail thus pose an objectively \nserious risk of harm.  \n2.  Defendants Have Been Deliberately Indifferent.   \nJailers are deliberately indifferent when they have “subjective awareness of \nan ‘objectively serious need’” and their response is “objectively insufficient.”  See \nFarrow v. West, 320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir. 2003).  A response is objectively \ninsufficient where a jailer fails “to take reasonable measures to abate” the known \nrisk of harm.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847.  In that regard, a jailer may be liable “for \ndisregarding ‘alternative means’ or interim measures for reducing the risk” despite \ntaking minimal responsive action.  Hale v. Tallapoosa Cnty., 50 F.3d 1579, 1584 \n(11th Cir. 1995).  Where, as here, jailers are sued in their official capacities, a court \nmay consider “the institution’s historical indifference” to address the risk of harm.  \nSee LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1526, 1542 (11th Cir. 1993).11  A history of \nconstitutional violations permits courts “to conclude that future violations of the \n \n11 Cf. Walker v. City of Calhoun, 901 F.3d 1245, 1270 (11th Cir. 2018) (“[V]oluntary \ncessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear \nand determine the case.” (quoting Flanigan’s Enters., Inc. v. City of Sandy Springs, \n868 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc)).   \n   19   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 28 of 45\nsame kind are likely.”  Thomas v. Bryant, 614 F.3d 1288, 1318 (11th Cir. 2010) \n(quoting Kapps v. Wing, 404 F.3d 105, 123 (2d Cir. 2005)). \nDefendants are unquestionably aware of the life-threatening risks presented \nby COVID-19.  Government orders, public health guidance, and extensive news \ncoverage have repeatedly emphasized the risks of COVID-19 to incarcerated \npeople, as well as the heightened risk to the medically vulnerable.  (See, e.g., Doc. \n1 ¶¶ 97-98, 100 (citing public records concerning risks of COVID-19 and \nprevention measures).)  Preventative measures like social distancing, the use of \nmasks, and proper hygiene have been widely publicized.  (See Doc. 1 ¶ 97.)  The \nJail’s own records establish that written announcements and advice from multiple \npublic health authorities were distributed to Defendants.  (Ex. E; Ex. J.)  \nDefendants are likewise aware of the living conditions in the Jail, as the conditions \nare obviously deficient and each Defendant is a senior official who has been \ninvolved in operating the Jail for years. \nNevertheless, Defendants have ignored public health guidance and failed to \nadopt measures that any reasonable correctional administrator would adopt in \naddressing the pandemic.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶¶ 14, 26-96.)  Instead of taking steps \nto reduce the Jail’s population (see Ex. F), Defendants have continued to operate \nthe Jail at capacity, with most detainees housed three to a cell (see Ex. D).    \n   20   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 29 of 45\nDefendants have consistently failed to take reasonable steps to prevent and \nmitigate COVID-19 infections.  Rather, they have declared there is no outbreak of \nCOVID-19 in the Jail even though infections among detainees more than doubled \nbetween June 11 and July 9.  Defendants continue to operate the Jail in a reckless \nmanner.  See Hale, 50 F.3d at 1579 (holding “atmosphere of deliberate \nindifference” at jail supported finding that defendant was liable). \nDefendants’ practices are so inherently risky and likely to spread COVID-19 \nthat deliberate indifference is the only explanation for them.  It is objectively \nunreasonable to place a healthy detainee in a cell with a symptomatic, infected \nperson, yet Defendants do so.12  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 37-40; F.S. Decl. ¶¶ \n23-27; J.H. Decl. ¶¶ 29-30.)  Defendants’ officers have also failed to isolate \ninfected people, leading them to further spread the virus.13  (See, e.g., W.L.M. \nDecl. ¶¶ 18-21; Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 37-40; F.S. Decl. ¶¶ 23-27; J.H. Decl. ¶¶ 29-30.)  \nEven when jailers remove symptomatic detainees from housing units, the cells are \nnot sanitized before another detainee is assigned, and the cellmates of sick people \n \n12  The  reasonable  response  when  people  display  COVID-19  symptoms  is  to \n“immediately”  place  them  “under  medical  isolation.”  CDC  Interim  Guidance, \nhttps://bit.ly/2BX2gES. \n13 Those who have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case must \npromptly be quarantined. CDC Interim Guidance, https://bit.ly/2BX2gES. \n   21   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 30 of 45\nare not tested for COVID-19.  (See, e.g., A.W. Decl. ¶¶ 40-41; D.H. Decl. ¶¶ 16-\n18.)14  And Defendants place new admittees into general population without testing \nto ensure they do not have COVID-19.  (See, e.g., W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 4; R.L. Decl. ¶¶ \n9-12; Singleton Decl. ¶ 9.)     \nOne critical way of preventing the spread of a contagious disease is by \n“implementing intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures” to limit \ntransmission of the virus through contaminated surfaces.15  Such measures are \nespecially important in a jail, where dozens of detainees are forced to share the \nsame telephones, showers, tables, and kiosks.  (See, e.g., Jones Decl. ¶ 10.)  \nNonetheless, Defendants continue to clean the common areas only “rarely” and fail \nto sanitize objects and surfaces between uses.  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶ 25; Jones \nDecl. ¶ 10; Mitchell Decl. ¶ 6; Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6.)  Similarly, Defendants fail \nto provide detainees with chemicals necessary to sanitize their cells—issuing only \na broom and dirty mop water most days—despite multiple complaints from \n \n14 When detainees complain of COVID-19 symptoms, jailers instead tell detainees \nto place a sick-call request on the kiosk, after which detainees wait several days to \nbe seen by medical staff members, if they are seen at all.  (See, e.g., J.H. Decl. ¶¶ \n30.)  In the meantime, they remain in their assigned housing units with others, \npotentially spreading the disease.  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 37-40; J.H. Decl. ¶¶ \n30-32; F.S. Decl. ¶¶ 23-27.) \n15 CDC Interim Guidance, https://bit.ly/2BX2gES.       \n   22   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 31 of 45\ndetainees about the lack of supplies.  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 23-24; Jones \nDecl. ¶ 11; Mitchell Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6; J.H. Decl. ¶ 9.)     \nAnother reasonable way of reducing the spread of the virus is to educate \ndetainees about the virus’s symptoms and the importance of good hygiene, and by \nissuing adequate supplies of soap for detainees to wash their hands frequently.16  But \nDefendants have given detainees no information regarding COVID-19 symptoms \n(see, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶ 32; Jones Decl. ¶ 4; Mitchell Decl. ¶ 22; Singleton Decl. \n¶ 11; J.H. Decl. ¶ 25), and detainees continue to receive, at most, the same four-\nounce weekly allotment of soap that Defendants provided before the pandemic (see, \ne.g., Watkins Decl. ¶ 15 (“Four ounces does not last any of us for the whole \nweek.”).17   \nDefendants have also failed to implement social distancing.  They continue \nto require large groups of detainees to congregate during meal distribution, pill \ndistribution, visits to the medical unit, and “video court” hearings, significantly \n \n16 CDC Interim Guidance, https://bit.ly/2BX2gES.  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 70-75.) \n17 “The amount of soap provided at the Clayton County Jail is woefully inadequate \nto ensure the kind of frequent hand washing needed to stop the spread of a contagious \nillness.  If a person runs out of soap, more should be provided, and it should be \nprovided immediately.  This is not a time to maintain strict adherence to existing \nprocedures about soap quantity.  Soap, paper towels, and other hygiene items should \nbe readily available upon request for detainees.”  (Sparkman Decl. ¶ 58.) \n   23   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 32 of 45\nincreasing the risk of contagion.  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶¶ 13, 14, 26-27; A.W. \nDecl. ¶¶ 23-24; J.H. Decl. ¶ 32; R.L. Decl. ¶ 11.)   \nUntil recently, Defendants had not issued most detainees facial coverings, “a \ncritical preventive measure.”18  Before this, only “inmate workers” were issued \nmasks; all other detainees resorted to placing random clothing items like \nunderwear or towels over their faces.  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶ 35; Jones Decl. ¶ \n14; Mitchell Decl. ¶¶ 19-20; Singleton Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8.)  Though Defendants may \nhave recently issued masks to more detainees, it appears Defendants have still not \nissued every detainee a mask, and Defendants have not provided a way for those \nwith masks to clean or replace them regularly.  (See, e.g., Watkins Decl. ¶ 36 \n(noting in late June that he had been given a surgical mask at the end of May that \nhad “not been cleaned or replaced” in the intervening three weeks).)   \nIn sum, Defendants have failed to take “reasonable measures to abate” the \nserious harm of COVID-19.

See Taylor v. Hughes, 920 F.3d 729, 733 \n(11th  Cir.  2019)  (citation  omitted),  remanded,  No.  2:14-CV-1163,  2019  WL \n5756057 (M.D. Ala. Nov. 4, 2019), appeal filed, (11th Cir.

For example, detainee C.S. complained on May \n22 that he had not been given information regarding COVID-19.  (Ex. I.)

(Id.) \n   25   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 34 of 45\naddress the virus, Defendants are recklessly exposing the Jail’s detainees to a \npotentially lethal or permanently debilitating disease.  The Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments prohibit this.   \nC.  The Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses Are Likely to \nPrevail on Their Habeas Claim. \nThe Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses are likely to prevail on \ntheir § 2241 claims, which are based on the same violations of federal law \nunderlying Plaintiffs’ § 1983, Americans with Disabilities Act, and Rehabilitation \nAct claims.  “If medically vulnerable detainees are not released as soon as \npossible,” they are at risk of “infection,” “long-lasting and permanent organ \ndamage,” and “death.”  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 43.)   \n1.  COVID-19 Makes Confinement Unlawful for the Medically \nVulnerable and Disability Subclasses. \nMembers of the Medically Vulnerable and Disability Subclasses challenge the \nfact of their confinement, which by its very nature poses an unacceptably high risk \nof COVID-19 infection, long-term harm, and death.  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 43.)  Given \nthat “[t]here is no effective way to eliminate risk for medically vulnerable detainees \nin the jail” (id. ¶ 49), no conditions of confinement can protect these subclasses.20 \n \n20 Plaintiffs pleaded this action as both a habeas petition and a civil action pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  (See Doc. 1 ⁋⁋ 24, 214.)  Even if this Court concludes that it \n \n   26   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 35 of 45\nAs the Supreme Court explained, when the very fact of imprisonment is \nchallenged as unlawful, a detainee’s proper remedy is a writ of habeas corpus.  \nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 500 (1973).  Therefore, where release is the \nonly adequate remedy for a violation of federal rights, habeas relief is appropriate.  \nSee Haskins v. City of Boaz, 822 F.2d 1014, 1015 (11th Cir. 1987) (“When federal \nrights are violated, ‘it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert \nto adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief’” (quoting Bell v. Hood, \n327 U.S. 678, 684 (1946))). \nMembers  of  the  Disability  and  Medically  Vulnerable  Subclasses’  only \nadequate remedy is release, because the Jail is incapable of providing them with \nadequate care and protection from infection.  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 49.)  “[E]ven the most \nstringent precautionary measures—short of limiting the detained population itself—\nsimply cannot protect detainees from the extremely high risk of contracting this \nunique and deadly disease.”  Malam v. Adducci, 5:20-CV-10829, 2020 WL 1672662, \nat *8 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 5, 2020).  Accordingly, those who are medically vulnerable \n“should be evaluated for release” (Fefferman Decl. ¶ 10), because absent release, \n \nlacks habeas jurisdiction, it has the power to order release or transfer of detainees in \na § 1983 action.  See, e.g., Reaves v. Dep’t of Correction, 404 F. Supp. 3d 520, 522-\n25 (D. Mass. 2019) (ordering transfer of prisoner with quadriplegia to outside \ntreatment facility); Plata v. Brown, 427 F.Supp.3d 1211, 1222-24 (N.D. Cal. 2013) \n(ordering transfer of medically vulnerable prisoners due to risk of disease).  \n   27   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 36 of 45\nthey “are at risk of infection . . . and even death” (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 43).  “There is no \neffective way to eliminate risk for medically vulnerable detainees” and “[t]he best \nchance for medically vulnerable detainees to survive the pandemic is to release them \nfrom the jail so they can practice social distancing.”  (Rottnek Decl. ¶ 49 (emphasis \nadded).)  \n2.  Habeas Relief May Take the Form of Release or Transfer. \nAs an alternative to release, the Medically Vulnerable and Disability \nSubclasses require enlargement of their detention in the form of home confinement \nor transfer to facilities with adequate social distancing, sanitation practices, and \nother conditions sufficient to protect them from COVID-19, which Defendants \nhave authority to grant.  See, e.g., O.C.G.A. §§ 42-4-7(b), 42-1-8; see also, e.g., \nBusby v. Bonner, 2:20-CV-2359, 2020 WL 3108713, at *3 (W.D. Tenn. June 10, \n2020) (enlargement claims may be brought under § 2241); Jimenez v. Aristiguieta, \n314 F.2d 649, 652 (5th Cir. 1963) (“The District Court [has] inherent power as the \nhabeas corpus court or judge to enter [an] order . . . respecting the custody or \nenlargement of [the petitioner]”).   \nD.  The Disability Subclasses Are Likely to Prevail on Their Claim \nThat Defendants Are Violating the ADA and the RA. \nMembers of the Disability Subclasses are protected persons with disabilities \nunder Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the RA. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A), (2)(B), \n   28   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 37 of 45\n28 C.F.R. § 35.108(d)(2)(iii).  By virtue of their detainee status, they are entitled to \nequal access to the programs and services of the Jail, a public entity.  42 U.S.C. § \n12131(2); 28 CFR § 35.104; Lonergan v. Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 623 F. App’x 990, \n992 (11th Cir. 2015).  \nTitle II of the ADA addresses “failure to make modifications to existing \nfacilities and practices.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5).  Public entities lack “the option \nof being passive in their approach to disabled individuals as far as the provision of \naccommodations is concerned.”  Pierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d \n250, 269 (D.D.C. 2015); see also R.W. v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., \n114 F. Supp. 3d 1260, 1282 (N.D. Ga. 2015) (recognizing proof of intentional \ndiscrimination is unnecessary in ADA case seeking injunctive relief).  Similarly, \nthe RA requires public entities that receive federal funding to grant individuals \nwith disabilities access by making “reasonable accommodations,” whether or not \nexclusion was intentional.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985). \nThe ADA and the RA require public entities to take affirmative steps and \nmake reasonable modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to ensure \nthe disabled have access to programs and services for which they would otherwise \nbe qualified.  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.102(a), 35.130(a), (b); Alexander, 469 U.S. at 295 \n(the RA entitles qualified disabled individuals to “meaningful access to the benefit \n   29   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 38 of 45\nthat the grantee offers” through “reasonable accommodations”); Lonergan, 623 F. \nApp’x at 992 (Title II claims “may proceed on the theory that Defendant failed to \nreasonably accommodate the Plaintiff’s disability”).  The ADA expressly prohibits \npublic entities from “utiliz[ing] criteria or methods of administration . . . [t]hat \nhave the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination \non the basis of disability” or “have the . . . effect of defeating or substantially \nimpairing accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s program with \nrespect to individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(i)-(ii) (emphasis \nadded).  The duty of a public entity to provide meaningful affirmative \naccommodations is at its apex when that entity is a jail, due to the “complete \ncontrol [it has] over whether . . . inmates (disabled or not) receive any programs or \nservices at all.”  Pierce, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 269.  \nPrograms and services in detention include the safe adjudication of pretrial \ndetainees’ pending criminal cases, as well as adequate living conditions and access \nto medical care for all detainees.  Keeping detainees alive and healthy to conclude \ntheir criminal proceedings and serve any sentences imposed are important \ncomponents of a jail’s program.  See generally 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.104.  If members of the Disability Subclasses experience long-term illness or \ndeath from COVID-19, they will have been denied equal access to safe \n   30   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 39 of 45\nadjudication of their cases, and thus will have suffered discrimination.  See Fraihat \nv. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 5:19-CV-1546, 2020 WL 1932570, at \n*26 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 2020) (holding people with disabilities in ICE detention \nentitled to reasonable accommodations in order to participate in the removal \nprocess).  Disabled detainees also face discrimination in the form of unequal access \nto the Jail’s programs: they are facing impossible choices between accessing \nessential medical care and risking potentially-deadly exposure to COVID, or \nforegoing medical care to limit their exposure to the virus.  \nDefendants’ practices potentially exclude the Disability Subclasses from \nequal access to the Jail’s services and access to courts, because of the heightened \nrisk that COVID-19 poses to them.  All of the Jail’s services require being in close \nquarters with other detainees, posing a disproportionate risk of severe illness and \ndeath for the Disability Subclass.  (See, e.g., J.H. Decl. ¶¶ 31-32.)  Defendants \nnonetheless fail to provide essential basic resources, including hygiene products, \nprotective equipment, and social distancing, necessary for Disability Subclass \nmembers to protect themselves from COVID-19 while engaging in these activities.  \nFor example, Plaintiff Rhonda Jones is disabled as a result of chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease, has been hospitalized twice for pneumonia in recent months, \nand must access the Jail’s medical care program to manage her illness.  (Jones \n   31   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 40 of 45\nDecl. ¶¶ 3, 9.)  But she can only participate in that program if she waits in a \ncrowded cage in the Jail’s medical unit, potentially exposing her to a virus that \nposes an acute threat to her health precisely because her disability makes her \nsusceptible to serious illness or death.  (Id. ¶¶ 9, 22.)  The Jail has made no \naccommodations for Jones or other members of the Disability Subclasses to reduce \ntheir risk of exposure to the virus, meaning that these detainees are potentially \nexcluded from Jail services.  See Pierce, 128 F. Supp. 3d. at 273 (ADA and RA \nviolations where deaf prisoners were excluded from prison substance abuse and \nanger management programs because no interpreter was provided).  \n  Defendants have disregarded their affirmative obligation under the ADA and \nRA to address these dangers for the Disability Subclasses.  The accommodations \nthe Disability Subclasses require to address the harms they face—implementation \nof CDC guidelines to mitigate COVID-19 exposure and a process to facilitate the \nrelease of medically vulnerable detainees for whom mitigation will be \ninsufficient—are reasonable and necessary.  See Fraihat, 2020 WL 1932570, at \n*29 (directing ICE to take mitigation measures in its detention facility, including \ntimely release determinations, for detainees with risk factors); Busby, 2020 WL \n3108713, at *9-10 (discussing plaintiffs’ disabilities identified by the CDC as \nheightened COVID-19 risk factors).   \n   32   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 41 of 45\nII.  Without Injunctive Relief, Plaintiffs Will Be Irreparably Harmed. \n“The deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes \nthe ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’ proscribed by the Eighth \nAmendment.”  Estelle v. Gamble, l429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (citation omitted).  As \ndoes a “heightened risk of dying or suffering from serious illness and long-term \nhealth consequences” and “bodily injury and loss of life.”  City of Los Angeles v. \nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 98 (1983).  “The risk of permanent harm to Plaintiffs applies \nwith greater force to the medically vulnerable . . . , for whom continued detention \nis even more likely to cause injury and death.”  Wilson v. Gordon, 822 F.3d 934, \n958 (6th Cir. 2016). \nThe dangers and lethality of COVID-19 are indisputable, and the risks to the \nPlaintiff classes of permanent physical injury or death are “prototypical irreparable \nharm.”  Banks v. Booth, 1:20-CV-849, 2020 WL 3303006, at *16 (D.D.C. June 18, \n2020); Vazquez Barrera v. Wolf, 4:20-CV-1241, 2020 WL 1904497, at *6 (S.D. \nTex. Apr. 17, 2020) (holding that the long-term health consequences of COVID-19 \nare irreparable harm).  Plaintiffs thus meet the irreparable harm requirement.  \nIII.  The Public Interest and Balance of Equities Favor Plaintiffs. \nAn injunction halting unconstitutional actions and unlawful discrimination \nagainst people with disabilities during a global pandemic disproportionately \n   33   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 42 of 45\naffecting people in jails outweighs any harm to Defendants and is in the public \ninterest.  Injunctive relief is appropriate if the harm to plaintiffs in the absence of \nan injunction “would exceed the harm suffered by the State if the injunction is \nissued, and [the] injunction would not disserve the public interest.”  Odebrecht \nConst., Inc. v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Transp., 715 F.3d 1268, 1287 (11th Cir. 2013).  \n“‘[I]t is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s \nconstitutional rights.’”  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012) \n(citation omitted); see also Hispanic Interest Coal. of Ala. v. Governor of Ala., 691 \nF.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir. 2012) (recognizing that a state “has no interest in \nenforcing a state law that is unconstitutional”). \nAlthough ordering Defendants to take steps to prevent and mitigate COVID-\n19 will entail some expenditures, any financial harm to Defendants does not \noutweigh the risk of severe illness, permanent organ damage, or death Plaintiffs \nface.  Courts regularly find that the balance tips in favor of plaintiffs when \ndetainees’ health is at risk.  See, e.g., Ancata v. Prison Health Servs. Inc., 769 F.2d \n700, 705 (11th Cir. 1985) (“Lack of funds . . . cannot justify an unconstitutional \nlack of competent medical care”).  Moreover, steps to control COVID-19 in the \nJail will serve the public interest in controlling the pandemic by reducing the risk \nthat an former detainee or staff member will carry the virus to the community.  \n   34   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 43 of 45\n(See Fefferman Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12-14 (noting Jail poses “unnecessary risk” to the \n“broader community”).) \nSimilarly, release or enlargement is in the public interest because it \n“preserve[s] critical medical resources and prevent[s] further stress on the states’ \nand country’s already overburdened healthcare system.”  Robenson v. Decker, No. \n2:20-CV-5141, 2020 WL 2611544, at *9 (D.N.J. May 22, 2020); see Arias v. \nDecker, No. 1:20-CV-2802, 2020 WL 2306565, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2020) \n(same), appeal docketed, No. 20-2139 (2d Cir. Jul. 7, 2020); Alcantara v. \nArchambeault, No. 3:20-CV-756, 2020 WL 2315777, at *10 (S.D. Cal. May 1, \n2020) (same); Zaya v. Adducci, No. 5:20-CV-10921, 2020 WL 2487490, at *9 \n(E.D. Mich. May 14, 2020) (same), appeal docketed, No. 10-1667 (6th Cir. Jul. 14, \n2020).   \nFinally, an injunction also serves the public interest because it will benefit \nthe public health by mitigating COVID-19’s spread in the community.  See Banks \nv. Booth, No. 1:20-CV-849, 2020 WL 1914896, at *12 (D.D.C. Apr. 19, 2020) \n(“[I]njunctive relief . . . is in the public interest because it supports public health.”).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant a preliminary injunction and writ of habeas corpus. \n   35   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-1   Filed 07/27/20   Page 44 of 45\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Jeremy Cutting           \nKosha S.

I, Nina Fefferman, being competent to make this declaration and having \npersonal knowledge of the matters stated herein, declare under penalty of perjury \nthat the following is true and correct: \n2.  I am over 21 years of age.  The statements contained in this declaration \nare based on my personal knowledge, or on information that experts in the field of \ninfectious disease epidemiology would reasonably rely on in forming an opinion, \nand are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. \nI.  Expert Qualifications \n3.  I am a full Professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in both \nthe  Department  of  Ecology  and  Evolutionary  Biology  and  the  Department  of \n \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 3 of 47\nMathematics.  I am also the Director of the Mathematical Modeling Consulting \nCenter at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, and the \nAssociate  Director  of  the  University  of  Tennessee  One  Health  Initiative.    My \nresearch focuses on complex adaptive systems, with a focus on the interplay between \nindividual behavior and infectious disease epidemiology. \n4.  I have worked for the past 16 years as a researcher of the epidemiology, \necology,  and  evolution  of  infectious  disease,  pandemic  preparedness,  national \nbiosecurity, and infrastructure protection.  I hold a Master’s degree in mathematics \nfrom Rutgers University and a PhD in Biology from Tufts University. \n5.  For  over  a  decade,  I  was  one  of  the  primary  researchers  of  the \nCommand, Control, and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analytics, a U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Center of Excellence, where I ran a \nresearch group focusing on the mathematics of both biosecurity and cybersecurity.  \nAs part of my role in that center, I contributed models and policy recommendations \nto DHS and its affiliate agencies for how to manage and mitigate pandemic threats \nfrom H1N1 2009 flu, Ebola in West Africa, and Zika virus.  I have also consulted \nfor various additional state and federal agencies and private companies, domestically \nand abroad, in the area of outbreak management since 2004. \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 4 of 47\n6.

Based on my expertise in the epidemiology of infectious pandemics and \nmy  understanding  of  the  conditions  within  the  Clayton  County  Jail  from  the \ndeclarations and other documents listed above, I conclude that unsafe conditions \nwithin the jail are exacerbating the spread of disease.  As a consequence, detainees \nin the facility, as well as the corrections and medical staff, their families, and the \nbroader community, are being put at unnecessary risk of severe harm from COVID-\n19. \n10.  In response, it is my opinion as an expert in infectious disease dynamics \nthat individuals who are already detained in the facility—particularly individuals \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 7 of 47\nwho are susceptible to complications from COVID-19—should be evaluated for \nrelease.  Additionally, at a minimum, the jail’s administrators should take immediate \nsteps to:  \na.  Provide detainees with clear information about COVID-19, including \nmethods  for  prevention,  recognizing  symptoms,  and  reporting \nsymptoms; \nb.  Enforce and allow for social distancing among detainees during all \nactivities, including those involving meals, medical care, and court \nappearances; \nc.  Provide adequate masks that are cleaned or replaced regularly; \nd.  Implement  an  enhanced  cleaning  protocol  that  includes  providing \ndisinfectant materials to detainees so that they may clean out their cells; \ne.  Implement  an  enhanced  personal  hygiene  protocol  that  includes \nproviding hand sanitizer to detainees, as well as increased quantities of \nsoap and more frequent laundry services; \nf.  Screen all incoming detainees and staff for symptoms and quarantine \nall incoming detainees for at least 14 days; \ng.  Test  anyone  who  displays  any  of  the  most  common  symptoms \nassociated with COVID-19; \nh.  Act promptly to isolate individuals who report symptoms or who have \nbeen in recent close contact with those who have reported symptoms; \nand \ni.  Ensure  that  sick  individuals  have  access  to  supportive  medical \nmonitoring and care during the entire period they are symptomatic. \n \nThe jail should incorporate these recommendations into clear and formal \nguidelines to adequately protect those who remain in jail facilities and ensure that \nthese steps are being followed by all staff.  These steps should be maintained until \n \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 8 of 47\nat least such time as the epidemic in the broader community has been contained \nand social distancing and other prevention and mitigation measures are no longer \nrecommended.  \n11.  By adopting these recommendations—to both release as many people \nas possible and to implement urgently needed protective measures within the jail—\nthe jail could substantially reduce the number of COVID-19 infections in both the \njail and the surrounding Clayton County community, and reduce the risk that the \nClayton County healthcare system becomes overwhelmed. \nA. Risk of COVID-19 Within Jails and the Wider Community \n \n12.  The health of persons in jail and the health of the rest of the community \nare inherently linked.  The two populations must interact because jails constantly \nrelease  people  into  the  wider  community,  admit  new  people  from  the  wider \ncommunity,  and  rely  on  staff  and  vendors  who  regularly  mix  with  the  wider \ncommunity.  Further, many jails rely on local hospitals to treat incarcerated persons \nrequiring advanced medical care, adding to the burden on the limited resources of \nlocal healthcare systems. \n13.   Unmitigated  spread  of  disease  within  jails  results  in  worse  health \noutcomes for the entire population.  Cases of infection occurring within a jail cause \n \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 9 of 47\nadditional cases of infection, hospitalization, and deaths in the wider community.1  \nThis link is not surprising.  Studies show that the conditions inherent to all jails \ndegrade the health of incarcerated people, leaving them more vulnerable to infection \nand severe outcomes from infection.2  As an epidemiological result of increasing \nindividual vulnerability to disease, the vulnerability of the whole jail population \nincreases. \n14.  Jails with disease prevalence higher than the general populations they \nserve—like the Clayton County Jail—will therefore act as sources of infection.  Jails \nwith high infection rates will continue to re-seed infection into the wider community, \nundermining the wider community’s efforts to contain or mitigate outbreaks, and \ncan even introduce disease into otherwise non-infected communities. \n \n1 Eric Lofgren, Kristian Lum, Aaron Horowitz, Brooke Madubuonwu & Nina \nFefferman, The Epidemiological Implications of Incarceration Dynamics in Jails \nfor Community, Corrections Officer, and Incarcerated Population Risks from \nCOVID-19, medRxiv (May 4, 2020) (submitted for review), \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058842v2. \n2 David C.

Outbreaks of disease in jails are exacerbated by three dynamics: (1) the \ncontinuous introduction of potential new sources of infection (for example, as a \nresult of new admissions or by staff); (2) the high density of jail living arrangements \n(such as bunks and cells), which creates more physical proximity and contact among \nsusceptible incarcerated people; and (3) often inadequate protocols for mitigating \nthe spread of infection within the facility.  Any intervention calculated to slow or \nhalt the outbreak of disease in jails will rise or fall on its capacity to meaningfully \nshift one or more of these three powerful factors. \nB. Failure to Mitigate COVID-19 Infection Inside the Clayton County \nJail \n \n16.  Based on the declarations I have reviewed, it is clear that the Clayton \nCounty Jail has not taken basic steps recommended by authoritative public health \nentities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and protect the health and safety of \npeople inside and outside its walls.  The lack of action by officials with the Clayton \nCounty Sheriff’s Office contravenes public health guidance and common sense.  \nThe result is a jail environment that is already in the midst of a recorded outbreak \nand, with every passing day that allows the continuation of these conditions, \ncontinues to risk further viral transmission both within the jail and spilling out into \nthe broader community. \n \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 11 of 47\ni.  Exposure Conditions Within the Housing Unit Cells \n \n17.  Conditions within the jail’s cells pose a substantial risk of infection due \nto crowding and lack of adequate hygiene materials provided by the jail.  The \ncornerstone  of  COVID-19  prevention  is  social  distancing,  a  practice  that  is \neffectively impossible in a small jail cell that holds more than one person.  Making \nmatters worse, Declarants report that most if not all of the two-person cells in the \njail house three people.  Thus, within a given cell, there is no possibility of social \ndistancing that would offer any protection from transmission between cellmates.  \nThis problem is worsened further by detainees’ lack of access to appropriate masks.   \n18.  Further, detainees’ lack of sufficient access to cleaning products and \npersonal sanitary products also contribute to the potential for transmission.  There is \nan apparent insufficiency in the surfactants/disinfectants and cleaning materials with \nwhich  the  jail  provides  detainees  to  maintain  personal  hygienic  practice  for \nthemselves and their surroundings.  Detainees receive only a single 4 oz. bottle of \nsoap per week, no hand sanitizer, insufficient access to disinfectant, and no sponges \nor rags.  This lack of cleaning materials would be problematic under standard \nconditions and is even more so during a pandemic.  Although the primary routes of \ninfection in normal circumstances outside a jail are from droplets in the air, there are \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 12 of 47\nstill known risks from contaminated surfaces being touched and then transferred by \ntouch of unclean hands to the face.  Current evidence suggests that the virus causing \nCOVID-19 may remain alive on hard surfaces like those common to a jail for hours \nor even days.3  For this reason, the CDC recommends that regularly touched surfaces \nbe  frequently  cleaned  and  disinfected.4    In  the  circumstances  described  in  the \ndetainee statements, there are insufficient cleaning supplies to clean either surfaces \nor hands.  This failure is unacceptable, easily remedied by the jail, and likely to \nfurther the spread of infection if not corrected.  \nii.  Exposure Conditions Outside of Housing Unit Cells \n \n19.  The  jail’s  practice  of  requiring  detainees  to  congregate  in  large \ngroups—sometimes multiple times per day— fosters easy transmission of COVID-\n19 infection.  Declarants report that they must stand in a line to obtain their second \n \n3 The CDC recommends sanitizing frequently touched surfaces multiple times a \nday in the household setting.  The jail setting is riskier than the household setting \ndue to increased human density, and thus an increased sanitization regime is \nappropriate.  See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cleaning and \nDisinfection for Households (July 10, 2020) \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-\ndisinfection.html. \n4 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Guidance on Management of \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities \n(July 22, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/community/correction-detention/guidance-correctional-detention.html. \n \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 13 of 47\nmeal of the day.5  At pill call, the daily distribution of medication to detainees, jail \nstaff require detainees to line up to receive their medications from a nurse in the \nmiddle of the housing unit.6  They are further made to congregate in holding cells \nawaiting courtroom appearances and in the medical wing with people from other \nhousing.7  Each time detainees are instructed to line up close together, if any one \nperson in the group is infected, the infection can easily spread to all persons in the \ngroup.  The jail can and should reduce the risk of infection by no longer making \ndetainees congregate in large groups (in fact, such congregation of large groups \nshould be actively prohibited), by ensuring the wearing of masks during all activities \ninvolving  contact  with  others  not  housed  in  the  same  room  together,  and  by \ndisinfecting high-touch surfaces regularly.   \n20.  Further, depriving incarcerated people of access to the outdoors is \nknown to contribute to immunocompromise, which will increase susceptibility to \ninfection and thereby make it easier to transmit infection to others.8  Nevertheless, \n \n5 See, e.g., Decl. of Randolph Mitchell ¶ 7. \n6 See, e.g., Decl. of Barry Watkins ¶¶ 13-14. \n7 See, e.g.¸ Decl. of J.H. ¶¶ 31-32 (detailing forced congregation at video court); \nDecl. of Barry Watkins ¶¶ 26-27 (detailing forced congregation during trips to the \nmedical wing). \n8  See Elizabeth T. Jacobs & Charles J. Mullany, Vitamin D Deficiency and \nInadequacy in a Correctional Population 31 Nutrition 659 (2015). \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 14 of 47\ndeclarants describe receiving no access at all to the outdoors, or even to an open-air \n“yard,” despite it also being a space where detainees can maintain more distance \nbetween themselves and others.9  The jail should therefore allow as many detainees \nas possible to have time outdoors regularly with access rotated through small groups \nto limit potential spread due to congregation. \n21.  Ensuring that every detainee has (and uses) a mask would also decrease \ntransmission  risks.    Masks  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  at  decreasing  the \nlikelihood of spread of COVID-19 infection from a sick person to a healthy person.  \nConsequently, the jail should issue a mask to each staff person and detainee, and \nensure that each person in the jail always has a clean mask.  Paper masks should be \nreplaced on a daily basis and cloth masks should be “routinely” laundered.10  The \njail should require that all individuals (detainees and staff) always wear appropriate \nmasks.  This is not a protocol taken to protect oneself; it is taken to protect others, \n \n9 See, e.g., Decl. of Randolph Mitchell ¶ 8. \n10 Edward M. Fisher & Ronald E. Shaffer, Considerations for Recommending \nExtended Use and Limited Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Health \nCare Settings, 11 J. Occup. & Environ. Hyg.

The jail has also failed to provide education regarding protocol for \npersonal protection from COVID-19 infection and how to interrupt the spread (as \ndescribed  in  detainee  declarations).  This  shortcoming  is  an  epidemiologically \nunsupportable scenario with no discernable justification.  Knowledge is a powerful \ntool for modifying behavior, and disseminating information about how to recognize \nand prevent the spread of COVID-19 would cost little if anything.11  The jail should \nmake every effort to provide written, verbal, and demonstration-based explanations \nfor best practices about social distancing, personal hygienic practices, and signs and \nsymptoms that should be immediately reported to officers and/or medical staff.  \niii.  Unclear and Unsafe Intake Protocols \n \n23.  The statements from detainees indicate that the jail’s standard operating \nprocedure includes a protocol of quarantining new detainees for up to 7 days before \nthey are sent to general population.  However, even if new arrivals are isolated for 7 \ndays, that period of time is epidemiologically insufficient to prevent them from \n \n11 See Robert Hornik, PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION: EVIDENCE FOR BEHAVIOR \nCHANGE (Routledge 2002); see also, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nInterim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities (July 22, 2020), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\ndetention/guidance-correctional-detention.html (providing sample signage). \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 16 of 47\ncarrying infection into the jail system.  The etiology of COVID-19 is such that \nindividuals can begin to show symptoms anywhere from 2 to 14 days after exposure \nto infection.12  If, as appears to be the case, new detainees are released into the \ngeneral  population  fewer  than  14  days  after  their  arrival,  they  may  carry  pre-\nsymptomatic infection with them into the general population during this known \nwindow of potential duration before symptom onset.  This jail protocol poses a risk \nto the entire area in which they are housed and in which they move. \niv.  Failure to Examine, Isolate, or Provide Adequate Medical \nCare to Symptomatic Individuals \n \n24.  Based on my review of the declarations, the jail is committing critical \nfailures by not responding promptly to reported symptoms, and by failing to isolate \nor provide adequate medical  care to symptomatic individuals.  Identifying and \nisolating symptomatic individuals is one of the most important steps the jail should \nbe taking to mitigate transmission.  Individuals with any detected sign or symptom \nnot explained by another clinically diagnosed condition should be removed from the \nrest of the population, tested, and only returned to the rest of the population upon \nreceiving a negative test result.  They should have access to supportive medical \n \n12 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Symptoms of Coronavirus (May 13, \n2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-\ntesting/symptoms.html. \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 17 of 47\nmonitoring and care during the entire period they are symptomatic.  The jail’s failure \nto follow these commonsense procedures ensures the infection will continue to \nspread unabated. \n25.  Declarants  describe  long  delays  between  reporting  symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19 infection and receiving medical attention.  Some report \nfiling  medical  requests  and  waiting  over  a  week  to  be  seen  by  a  medical \nprofessional.13  Others report that, even after notifying multiple members of the jail \nstaff that they are unwell, they were never seen by medical staff.14  Still another \nreported no access to the system that allows for communications with the medical \nstaff.15  Particularly during a pandemic, no detainee should be prohibited or delayed \nin any way from receiving medical care, yet such delays appear to be routine at the \njail.  Immediate attention to symptomatic individuals is key to controlling the spread \nof the virus and should be a priority of jail staff. \n26.  Multiple declarations also state that sick individuals are only removed \na substantial time after their symptoms are first reported, or that the sick people are \nnot  isolated  at  all.16    These  responses  from  the  jail  are  both  medically  and \n \n13 See, e.g., Decl. of F.S. ¶ 26. \n14 See, e.g., Decl. of W.L.M. ¶¶ 29-34; Decl. of J.H. ¶¶ 30-31. \n15 See Decl. of M.B. ¶ 19. \n16 See, e.g., Decl. of F.S. ¶¶ 23-24; Decl. of W.L.M. ¶ 18-21. \n \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 18 of 47\nepidemiologically  unsupportable.    As  soon  as  a  person  develops  any  sign  or \nsymptom of COVID-19 infection they should be separated from others who have \nnot yet developed any symptoms.  All symptomatic individuals should be tested \nimmediately, and those who have been in close contact with the symptomatic person \nshould be quarantined and monitored regularly.  The symptomatic person should be \nisolated and monitored closely in a medical environment, especially if they are older \nor have any of the medical conditions that predispose someone to severe COVID-19 \noutcomes (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, etc.).  \n27.  Detainees further describe that the identification of active infection in \ncertain dormitories did not lead to isolation of individuals housed in those units from \ninteraction with other detainees.  Most critically, detainees acting in their capacity \nas trustees were still sent to perform duties in housing units with either confirmed or \nsuspected  cases  of  active  COVID-19  infection,  thereby  exposing  to  infection \nthemselves, the other detainees with whom they are housed, and as a consequence, \nall  areas  of  the  facility  served  by  trustee  labor.17    The  jail’s  failure  to  isolate \nindividuals who are presenting with COVID-19 signs and symptoms, whether or not \nthey have yet received a positive COVID-19 test, substantially undermines the \n \n17 See Decl. of D.H. ¶¶ 13-25. \n \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 19 of 47\nefficacy of any other efforts to mitigate the spread of infection.  It exposes the \nentirety of the facility and the broader community to ongoing infection. \n28.  Finally, the jail must ensure that sick individuals receive supportive \nmedical monitoring and care during the entire period they are symptomatic.  Based \non my review of the declarations, it appears that the jail is largely failing to provide \nsupportive medical care and oversight to symptomatic individuals, even when the \nindividual has been acknowledged by jail staff to be symptomatic and placed into a \nform of “medical isolation.”  One man reported that, 14 days into his “quarantine,” \nhe still had not been seen by a doctor or received any medical treatment.18  Another \nreported his symptoms to medical staff and had a COVID-19 test pending, yet he \nreceived  no  medical  care  and  was  unable  to  access  help  as  he  experienced  a \nsymptomatic attack one night.19  Finally, a third reported an entire dorm being \n“locked down” for 17 days, during which time nobody in the dorm received any \nmonitoring of, or treatment for, their symptoms.20  Providing continuous medical \n \n18 See Decl. of C.C. ¶ 6 (“I never saw a doctor, and I never received any medicine \nor other medical treatment.”). \n19 See Decl. of W.L.M. ¶ 29 (“At approximately 1:00 a.m., I began to feel severe \npain in my lungs; it felt as if my lungs were going to collapse.  I could not breathe.  \nI began to bang on my cell door because the emergency call button in my cell does \nnot work.  My cellmate, E.R., told me that banging on the door would not work \neither: no one was coming to help.  I believed I was going to die that night.”). \n20 Decl. of D.H. ¶¶ 27-28. \n \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 20 of 47\ncare is critical to preventing harm to detainees, and does not apply any less to people \nwho are quarantined or isolated.  The jail’s medical staff should evaluate all known \nsymptomatic individuals at least once per day and should apply “close monitoring” \nto all individuals who are at least moderately ill.21  Any appropriate evaluation and \ntreatment (such as pulmonary imaging, antibiotics, or oxygen therapy) should be \nadministered without delay.  \nv.  Insufficient Testing Protocols for Reactive Epidemiological \nInterventions \n \n29.  The  jail’s  testing  is  woefully  insufficient  to  allow  for  effective \nepidemiological interventions.  It has been shown that individuals may transmit \nCOVID-19 infection prior to the onset of symptoms.  In an ideal scenario, the jail \nwould test each individual daily and remove anyone with a positive test from the rest \nof the population immediately.  Due to practical constraints, such as test availability, \nan acceptable best practice would be to test a random sample of 10% of individuals \npresent in the jail each week (whether symptomatic or not) as an indication of \nprevalence and an early warning of increased transmission risks. (Note that this \nwould include detainees and staff and the choice of individuals comprising the 10% \n \n21 National Institute of Health, Management of Persons with COVID-19 (June 11, \n2020), https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/management-of-\ncovid-19/. \n \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 21 of 47\nshould be newly randomly selected each week.)  If conditions in the jail prevent \nadopting this best practice, an alternative best practice should at least be to monitor \nthe daily temperature of each seemingly healthy detainee and to perform a more \nthorough test (which could include a breathing test, test of ability to smell, and lung \nscan) on any individual showing any symptoms consistent with COVID-19.  Jail \nstaff should actively query individuals regarding the onset of new symptoms, rather \nthan relying only on general surveillance testing or medical requests that involve \nslow processing times.   \n30.  The jail appears to take a haphazard approach to testing people who are \nsymptomatic.  Detainees describe being unable to get tested, even when they are \nexperiencing symptoms and bring those symptoms to the attention of the medical \nstaff.22  The jail’s standards for testing people appear to be keyed to temperature.23  \nPerforming a COVID-19 test only on those detainees who have an elevated body \ntemperature is epidemiologically unsupportable.  Some studies have concluded that, \nearly in the progression of symptomatic infection, only 44% of patients exhibited \n \n22 See, e.g., Decl. of D.H. ¶ 23; Decl. of J.H. ¶¶ 30-31; Decl. of Randolph Mitchell \n¶¶ 16-17. \n23 See, e.g., Decl. of Barry Watkins ¶ 41 (“The nurse told me I couldn’t receive a \ntest if I wasn’t running a fever.  She did not take my temperature to see if I was \nfeverish.”). \n \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-2   Filed 07/27/20   Page 22 of 47\nfever as a symptom.24  Lack of fever should not be used as a disqualification from \nbeing  tested  for  active  infectious  status.    Ideally,  testing  should  be  based  on \nidentification of exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case via contact tracing but, at \nminimum, testing should be employed anytime an individual experiences novel and \notherwise medically unexplained presentation of any of the most common symptoms \nassociated with COVID-19.25  \nC. Conclusion and Recommendation \n31.  It  is  my  professional  judgment  that  the  people  incarcerated  in  the \nClayton County Jail are facing risks of exposure to COVID-19 that are drastically \nhigher than those faced by members of the broader community.  These risks could \nbe mitigated by a set of minor and reasonable steps consistent with community- and \ncorrectional facility-focused recommendations by public health authorities including \n(but not limited to) the CDC; however the jail has thus far failed to take these steps \nto prevent the spread and resultant harms of COVID-19.  Based on the extensive \nwork I have done on mitigation and containment strategies for infectious disease, it \n \n24 Wei-jie Guan, et al., Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in \nChina, 382 New Eng.

Successful \nimplementation of these strategies will also clearly yield a reduction in the source of \nrisk to the families of jail staff and incarcerated individuals, as well as to the broader \ncommunity. \n32.  It is my professional opinion that these steps are both necessary and \nurgent.  Each additional day the jail continues under current operational standards \nwill cost lives in both the incarcerated population and the broader Clayton County \ncommunity it serves. \n33.

I am over 21 years of age.  The statements contained in this \ndeclaration are based on my personal knowledge, or on information that physicians \nwould reasonably rely on in forming an opinion and are true and correct to the best \nof my knowledge. \n \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 3 of 59\n \nI.  Expert Qualifications \n2.  I am a Professor of Medicine at the Saint Louis University School of \nMedicine; Professor in the Physician Assistant Program at the Doisy College of \nHealth Sciences; and Professor in the Center for Health Law Studies in the School \nof Law.  I am the Director of Community Medicine in the Department of Family \nand Community Medicine and the Program Director of the Addiction Medicine \nFellowship.  I am board-certified in Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine, and \nI am a Certified Correctional Health Care Physician through the National \nCommission on Correctional Health Care (“NCCHC”).1   \n3.  My curriculum vitae is attached to this declaration as Attachment A. \n4.  I was the lead physician and medical director of the Saint Louis \nCounty Jail, a large urban jail, from June 2001 through September 2016.  In this \nrole, contracted through the Saint Louis County Department of Health, I saw \nincarcerated patients three days per week; “took call,” or advised on-site nurses on \nmedical issues in the facility about 16 days per month; and participated in the \n                                                \n1 A NCCHC credentialed physician is one who has “demonstrated understanding \nof the medical needs of the inmate population and possesses knowledge of the \nunique challenges, legal context and policies and procedures specific to physicians \npracticing in a correctional environment.”  See National Commission on \nCorrectional Health Care, CCHP-P Certification, https://www.ncchc.org/cchp-p \n(last visited July 14, 2020). \n2 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 4 of 59\n \nleadership teams that were responsible for the health and well-being of detainees, \ncorrectional medicine staff, correctional staff, and visitors to the jail, as well as \nJuvenile Detention in the Family Courts of Saint Louis County. \n5.  During my years in this role, I was responsible for directing the \nmedical care and supporting the correctional medicine staff in the care of a daily \ncensus of incarcerated people that varied from 900 to 1,400, as well as annual \nintake screenings of 30,000 to 34,000 arrestees.  The Saint Louis County Jail was \n(and is) the only jail in the State of Missouri that meets the American Correctional \nAssociation’s accreditation standards.  Juvenile Detention is accredited by the \nNational Commission on Correctional Health Care. \n6.  In addition to making policies regarding patient care and custody of \nmedically vulnerable detainees, I developed policies regarding institutional safety.  \nExamples of the latter include standard operating procedures on how to manage \ncare for complex patients in the medical and psychiatry infirmary, hygiene and \ncleaning protocols during the initial outbreak of methicillin-resistant \nstaphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”) in the early 2000’s.  MRSA was an antibiotic-\nresistant strain of bacteria that was spread by contact and through unhygienic \nintravenous drug injection.  It was particularly difficult to treat due to its resistance \nto antibiotics, and, much like COVID-19, it can live on surfaces for days and \n3 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 5 of 59\n \nremain undetected in hosts, which greatly increases the likelihood that it will \nspread.  The congregate setting of the Jail substantially increased the likelihood \nthat MRSA would spread within the facility, and thus, in order to contain and \nprevent infection, proper personal hygiene and disinfectant of high-touch surfaces \nand common areas was critically important to preventing an outbreak within the \nfacility.  To successfully prevent the spread of MRSA within the facility, my team \n(including Jail staff) developed an educational video shown daily to all the housing \npods explaining transmission, prevention, and proper handwashing to mitigate \nspread of the bacteria.  This video was shared with and disseminated throughout \nthe country by the National Institute of Corrections.  In addition to this tool, we \ncreated protocols for institutional cleaning, including cleaning schedules, \ninstructed detainees to effectively sanitize their own cells with disinfecting wipes, \nand employed workers to mop floors and properly sanitize high-touch surfaces and \nshared spaces.  We also developed medical protocols to standardize the \nprescription of antibiotics based on Bureau of Prisons recommendations.  Within \ntwo months, we had MRSA infections down to one eighth of the rate of infection \nat its peak. \n4 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 6 of 59\n \n7.  I also helped develop safety and emergency protocols related to the \ninstitutional lockdown following Michael Brown’s shooting death in Ferguson, \nMO, in August 2015. \n8.  While I have continued to practice family medicine and addiction \nmedicine since 2016, I recently returned to practice correctional health care on July \n1, 2020.  I am now the Medical Director of Family Courts and Juvenile Detention \nfor the 22nd Judicial Court of St. Louis.  In this role, I am building an \ninterprofessional clinical team to modernize and enhance existing services in \nJuvenile Detention—similar to my work with the Saint Louis County Jail and \nJuvenile Detention from 2001-2016.  I am maintaining my existing position at St. \nLouis University. \n9.  I have provided this declaration on a pro bono basis.  If I am asked to \nprovide testimony to the court, I will be providing testimony on a pro bono basis. \nII.  Assignment, Documents Reviewed, and Summary of Opinion. \n10.  I was asked by Plaintiffs’ counsel to offer my opinion, based on my \nknowledge, professional medical experience, and expertise in correctional \nmedicine, regarding whether the measures taken by the Clayton County Jail in \nresponse to the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak have been minimally \nadequate to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the Clayton County Jail. I \n5 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 7 of 59\n \nhave also been asked to recommend any additional steps that the Clayton County \nJail should take to ensure that it is following basic, well-accepted public health \nstandards for the mitigation of COVID-19 in jails. \n11.

In my opinion, the Clayton County Jail has taken little meaningful \naction to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the health and safety of \nmedically vulnerable individuals.  Among other shortcomings, jailers have not \nmade medical attention adequately available to medically vulnerable detainees; \nhave not implemented adequate social distancing guidelines; have not implemented \nadequate plans to ensure that commonly touched surfaces are sanitized; have failed \nfor months to provide detainees with protective facemasks; have housed infected \npersons in the same cells with uninfected persons; and do not have a sufficient \ntesting and tracing protocol. \n14.  As a consequence of the Defendants’ failures to act, there is a \nsignificant outbreak of COVID-19 at the jail, with 72 confirmed positive cases as \nof July 9, 2020.  Everyone working at or living in the Clayton County Jail is now at \nrisk of serious illness, or even death for those who are most medically vulnerable.  \nThe Clayton County Sheriff’s Office should take corrective action immediately in \norder to decrease the substantial risk of serious harm to detainees, staff, and the \ncommunity at large.  As laid out in more detail in Section VII, I recommend that \nClayton County Jail release as many medically vulnerable detainees as possible; \n7 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 9 of 59\n \nreduce the remaining population to best allow for adequate social distancing; and \nenforce CDC guidelines to reduce the risk of infection and sequelae through strict \nadherence to use of personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning, and hygiene \npractices. \nIII.  Public Health Recommendations for Containing the Spread of COVID-\n19 in Correctional Facilities. \n \n15.  Jails, much like cruise ships, were early incubators for the coronavirus \nbecause they are sites where large groups of people live, work, sleep and otherwise \ncongregate in close quarters. \n16.  The spread of COVID-19 within jails in turn creates greater risk for \nspread throughout the community outside the jail walls.  Staff members enter and \nexit jails for their shifts on a daily basis and could become vectors for introducing \nthe virus to the broader community. The inverse is true too: spread outside the jail \nwill lead to greater spread inside the jail.   \n17.  Despite these inherent risks, if Jail staff strictly follow the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidelines regarding COVID-19, they \n8 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 10 of 59\n \ncan mitigate the risk of infection and serious illness to detainees, staff, and the \npublic.2 \n18.  The CDC recommends, among many other measures: \na.  Posting signage throughout the facility to communicate to \ndetainees and staff: symptoms of COVID-19; hand hygiene \ninstructions; the importance of reporting one’s symptoms to \nmedical providers; and, for staff, instructions on stay-at-home \nprotocol; \nb.  Providing a sufficient stock of hygiene, cleaning, PPE and medical \nsupplies, and developing a contingency plan for the replacement of \nsuch supplies in the event of an outbreak;  \nc.  Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, especially \nin common areas several times per day, even if COVID-19 cases \nhave not yet been identified in the facility or community, and even \nif those surfaces are not ordinarily cleaned daily; \n                                                \n2 See Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) \nin Correctional and Detention Facilities, CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\ndetention/guidance-correctional-detention.html (last updated July 14, 2020) \n(hereinafter CDC Interim Guidance). \n9 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 11 of 59\n \nd.  Providing detainees and staff no-cost access to sufficient amounts \nof hygiene supplies such as soap, running water, and tissues; \ne.  Implementing screening protocols for new individuals entering the \njail and medically isolating individuals with known or suspected \ncases;3 \nf.   Disinfecting thoroughly all areas where people with known or \nconfirmed COVID-19 infections spent time; \ng.  Quarantining close contacts of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 \ncases; and  \nh.  Ensuring that detainees receive medical evaluation and treatment at \nthe first signs of COVID-19 symptoms. \n19.  The measures listed above are designed to manage and mitigate—not \ncompletely eliminate—the increased risk to jail populations.  The most effective \nmanagement strategy for slowing the spread of infection, for people inside the jail \n                                                \n3 The CDC recently promulgated additional guidance for jails to consider testing \neven asymptomatic individuals without known exposure to COVID-19 in areas \nwith known community spread. See Interim Considerations for SARS-CoV-2 \nTesting in Correctional and Detention Facilities, CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/correction-\ndetention/testing.html (last updated July 7, 2020). \n10 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 12 of 59\n \nand outside in the community, is limiting the number of people confined in a \ncongregate environment like the jail. \n20.  As the pandemic continues, Jail staff should implement the following \nstrategies to reduce the risk of serious illness or death among jail populations, \nincluding detainees, staff, and visitors: \na.  Release or relocate medically vulnerable detainees as quickly as \npossible so that they can maintain social distance; \nb.  Reduce the remaining population to best approximate social \ndistancing for those within the jail; and \nc.  Enforce CDC guidelines to reduce the risk of infection and \nsequelae to all in the jail environment, including detainees, \ncorrectional staff, medical staff, vendors, and other visitors. \nIV.  The Spread of COVID-19 at the Clayton County Jail \n \n21.  As noted above, I have reviewed the sworn declarations of numerous \ncurrent or recently released detainees, including: Rhonda Jones, Randolph \nMitchell, Michael Singleton, Barry Watkins, M.B., C.C., J.H., F.S., W.L.M., D.H., \nand A.W.  Multiple detainees reported that they tested positive for COVID-19 \nwhile in jail.  Others reported experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 \nbut stated that they had not been tested.   \n11 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 13 of 59\n \n22.  I have also reviewed data regarding the nature and scope of the \nClayton County Jail outbreak from the Georgia Department of Public Health.  \nBased on the documents listed above, it is my opinion that the Clayton County Jail \nis experiencing a significant COVID-19 outbreak.  Numbers have consistently \nincreased in these first months, and the facility has continued to operate at 96% \ncapacity as of June 2020.4  These two factors ensure an exponential spread of the \nvirus to detainees and staff. The documents provided by the Department of Public \nHealth show that COVID-19 cases in the jail have continued to increase since the \nfirst confirmed positive test was returned in April 2020:  They show that as of June \n11, 2020, there were 45 confirmed positive tests; 13 of these were jail staff, and 32 \nwere detainees.5  As of July 9, 2020, there were 72 confirmed positive cases among \ndetainees.6   \n23.  Without increased protective measures, these numbers will continue \nto increase, and it is likely that people will suffer lasting harm or die.  \n \n                                                \n4 See Georgia Department of Community Affairs Office of Research, County Jail \nInmate Population Report, 8 (June 4, 2020), \nhttps://www.dca.ga.gov/sites/default/files/jail_report_jun20.pdf.  \n5 See Email from O.

The Clayton County Jail’s Failure to Implement Basic Measures to \nControl the Spread of COVID-19 \n \n24.  Based on the declarations and other documents I have reviewed, I find \nthat the jail has not taken adequate steps to protect medically vulnerable \nindividuals and has not even minimally complied with CDC guidelines for \nmanaging COVID-19 within correctional facilities.   \nA. The Jail Has Not Taken Adequate Steps to Protect Medically \nVulnerable Individuals.  \n \n25.  Jails and prisons typically house detainees with chronic conditions, \nparticularly in men, that were not well-controlled prior to incarceration.  According \nto the CDC, many of these chronic conditions make people susceptible to the risk \nof serious illness or death from COVID-19.  Specifically, the CDC has put forth \nthe following list of diagnoses, just updated on July 17, 2020, that would describe a \ndetainee as being medically vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19:7 \na.  People of any age with the following conditions are at increased \nrisk of severe illness from COVID-19: \ni.  Cancer; \nii.  Chronic kidney disease; \niii.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”); \n                                                \n7 See People with Certain Medical Conditions, CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-\nmedical-conditions.html (last updated July 17, 2020). \n13 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 15 of 59\n \niv.  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) \nfrom solid organ transplant; \nv.  Obesity (body mass index [“BMI”] of 30 or higher); \nvi.  Serious heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary \nartery disease, or cardiomyopathies; \nvii.  Sickle cell disease; or \nviii.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n \nb.  Based on what we know at this time, people with the following \nconditions might be at an increased risk for severe illness from \nCOVID-19:  \ni.  Asthma (moderate-to-severe); \nii.  Cerebrovascular disease (affects blood vessels and blood \nsupply to the brain); \niii.  Cystic fibrosis; \niv.  Hypertension or high blood pressure; \nv.  Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) \nfrom blood or bone marrow transplant, immune \ndeficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other \nimmune weakening medicines; \nvi.  Neurologic conditions, such as dementia; \nvii.  Liver disease; \nviii.  Pregnancy; \nix.  Pulmonary fibrosis (having damaged or scarred lung \ntissues); \nx.  Smoking; \nxi.  Thalassemia (a type of blood disorder); or \nxii.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus. \n \n26.  Additionally, individuals aged 55 or older, even if they are not \ndiagnosed or receiving treatment for one of the aforementioned conditions, are at \n14 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 16 of 59\n \nan increased risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 and are properly \nclassified as medically vulnerable. \n27.  To properly respond to a COVID-19 outbreak in a jail setting, \nadministrators must identify all the people held in their custody who are medically \nvulnerable to infection.  The development of such a list or registry is encouraged \nby the CDC as well as correctional healthcare accrediting bodies.  This task is \ncritical for several reasons, and the daily updating of the list and locations of high-\nrisk detainees is critical to basic outbreak management.  Creating a real-time list of \nhigh-risk detainees allows for: \na.  Identification of high-risk detainees who are eligible for release \nfrom detention; \nb.  Development and implementation of re-entry plans of care and \nsupport with community partners for high-risk detainees; \nc.  Provision of adequate and well-informed medical care by \nclinicians who understand who their high-risk patients are; \nd.  Implementation of enhanced protective measures for high-risk \ndetainees who are not ill, through active surveillance, special \nhousing arrangements, and other protective measures; \n15 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 17 of 59\n \ne.  Implementation of enhanced surveillance and protective measures \nfor high-risk detainees who are in a quarantine setting, or who \ndevelop symptoms of COVID-19; and \nf.  Awareness and comprehension by individual detainees as to their \nlevel of risk, allowing them to make informed decisions about \nillness prevention.8 \n28.  The Clayton County Jail has created and perpetuated conditions that  \ndo not allow for the protection of medically vulnerable detainees from COVID-19.  \nShowers, telephones, and kiosks are communal and infrequently cleaned.  Sinks \nand toilets are communal in the open dorms.  In the individually celled housing \nunits, toilets and sinks are shared by the three people that live in any given cell.  \nToilets leak, and over-capacity conditions require people to sleep on the floor, a \nfew feet away from the shared toilet. \n29.  The declarations of detainees with known preexisting health \nconditions show that the jail has not taken adequate steps to protect them from \ncontracting COVID-19.  Examples of preexisting conditions suffered by the \ndeclarants include breast cancer, thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hepatitis C, hypertension, hand fracture \n                                                \n8 See People with Certain Medical Conditions, supra note 7. \n16 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 18 of 59\n \ndue to a car accident prior to incarceration, and chronic pain due to a car accident \nrequiring surgery and metal placement.

Declarant M.B. is a 52-year-old woman with a history of breast \ncancer.9  She reports receiving chemotherapy at Southern Regional \nMedical Center from 2013-2016.10  Cancer, even when in \nremission, can weaken one’s immune system.  She also has thyroid \ndisease, which could negatively impact her immune system.11  At \nthe time of her declaration, she reported symptoms of COVID-19, \nbut she had not received any medical evaluation or treatment for \nthose symptoms.  She was restricted from use of the kiosk—the \nmeans to access medical care.  When refused a mask by an officer, \nshe had to makeshift one out of her underwear.12  She reported no \nsocial distancing in the facility or instructions to do so.13 \n                                                \n9 Declaration of M.B., ECF No. 6-2 Ex.

Plaintiff Watkins is a 60-year-old man with type 1 diabetes \nmellitus.14  He reports—as do others—that he receives meals twice \ndaily.  Breakfast is served around 04:00 and lunch is served \nsometime between 9:30 and 11:00.  (At the latter meal, detainees \nare provided a bagged sandwich to eat later for dinner.)  He reports \nhaving his blood sugar checked and administered twice daily—at \n03:00 and again at 14:00.15  When a patient requires insulin, blood \nsugar checks are most useful prior to meals or snacks. In the \npractice described, the 14:00 blood sugar check is not very useful.  \nAnd poorly controlled diabetes can compromise the immune \nsystem, particularly if blood glucose is not well-controlled.  \nMoreover, when the patients with diabetes are lined up in the \nmedical wing for these checks and administration, there may be up \nto 75 people in line depending on how many dorms are let out, just \na foot or two apart, without social distancing.16  Watkins states that \nhe was denied testing for COVID-19 when his cellmate developed \n                                                \n14 Declaration of Barry Watkins, ECF No. 6-1 Ex.

The Clayton County Jail Has Not Complied with CDC Guidance \nfor Managing Coronavirus Within Correctional Facilities. \n \n30.  The Clayton County Jail has not even minimally complied with CDC \nguidance for managing the spread of coronavirus within correctional facilities.   \nThese inadequacies—even more critical when there is a known COVID-19 \noutbreak—place detainees, staff, and any visitors at risk for COVID-19 infection. \ni.  Absence of Social Distancing \n \n31.  The Clayton County Jail is currently organized with congregate \nenvironments for sleeping, showering, toileting, and using the telephone.  These \nenvironments are overcrowded such that detainees are often unable to maintain the \nrequired 6 feet of separation between each other and jail staff. \na.  Declarants report that detainees are typically housed three to a two-\nperson cell.  Given the sizes of the cells described by the \ndeclarations, double bunking would not allow for appropriate \nsocial distancing.  Moreover, three detainees to a cell, under any \nbed arrangement, elevates the chance of transmission due to \nfomite, large-droplet, and small-droplet transmission. \n22 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 24 of 59\n \nb.  In situations where detainees could approximate 6 feet among \nthem, the jail officers are not enforcing appropriate behavior.  The \njail’s practice of compelling detainees to line up a foot or two apart \nfor meals and pill call exposes them to a high risk of contagion that \ncan easily be avoided by acceptable distancing.  Examples of \ncongregate activity in which social distancing is not permitted \ninclude: the “pill line,” in which detainees are made to line up to \nreceive medicine, the line for food trays, and the line to walk to the \nmedical wing or video court.  Moreover, detainees cannot use \nphones or other common area activities during free time while \nmaintaining appropriate social distance. \n32.  Clayton County Jail also has inadequate secondary mitigation \nstrategies, or strategies beyond that of social distancing, for COVID-19. As \ndescribed herein, these include poor mask distribution, a failure to ensure \nfrequently touched surfaces are sanitized, and the lack of distribution of \neducational materials about the coronavirus to detainees.  \nii.  Lack of Personal Protective Equipment \n \n33.  The jail failed to give most of the declarants any protective equipment \nuntil the end of May.  Multiple detainees stated that they were told to create their \n23 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 25 of 59\n \nown mask out of their own clothing or limited linens.  Such face coverings are \nconsidered “homemade masks” by the CDC and are not considered PPE.  They \nshould only be used as a crisis capacity strategy.33 \niii.  Grossly Inadequate Sanitation and Cleaning \n \n34.  Declarants uniformly report rare and inadequate cleaning.  They \nreport they do not receive adequate cleaning supplies.  They report they receive \none broom and one mop bucket for every nearly 300-person housing unit.  \nDetainees scramble for use of the mop bucket, which contains water that quickly \nbecomes brown and dirty.  Declarants reported the following in terms of supplies \nand cleaning behaviors: \na.  They are given a mop bucket infrequently with no apparent bleach \nor other chemicals.  Declarant F.S. reports that mop buckets are \nsupplied once a week, on Mondays.34   \nb.  Shared spaces and high-touch areas are not wiped down \nregularly.35 \n                                                \n33 See Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks, CDC, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-\nmasks.html?referringSource=articleShare (last updated June 28, 2020). \n34 Declaration of F.S., ECF 6-2 Ex.

Declarants state that they are not consistently given any materials \nto wipe down their cells.  Some report that they are occasionally \ngiven paper towels, but other times they have to use their own \ntoilet paper.36  They are not given disinfectant spray or wipes to \nwipe down their cells, and, as a result, they often have to use their \ntowel and/or their clothes to clean their surroundings. \n35.  There are numerous sanitation issues regarding the toilets.  \na.  Declarants share toilets in the housing units and have \ncomplained of a lack of toilet paper as well as cleaning \nsupplies.37   \nb.  Multiple declarants report that toilets are broken and/or leaking.  \nThey report puddles on the floors.  They routinely ask officers \nfor blankets in the morning to soak up water.38   \nc.  These sanitation problems present an additional COVID-19 risk \nbecause current research on coronavirus indicates that it can be \naerosolized.  Viruses that are aerosolized can travel and remain \n                                                \n36 M.B. Declaration at ¶ 10; Watkins Declaration at ¶ 24.  \n37 J.H.

The aerosolized coronavirus can then be \nspread by inhalation of the virus or fecal-oral contact.39  Open \ntoilets, compounded by the practice of housing three people in \ntwo-person cells by having a third person on the floor, increase \nrisk of aerosolized transmission.  It is my medical opinion that \nthe Clayton County Jail’s configuration creates a serious risk of \ncontracting COVID-19, both in the context of the congregate \nrestrooms and the shared toilets in each cell. \niv.  Inability to Maintain Personal Hygiene \n \n36.  Detainees are supplied inadequate personal hygiene supplies. \na.  Detainees consistently report that during the weekly hygiene \ndistribution, they receive one or two rolls of toilet paper, a four-\nounce bottle of liquid soap, and a small tube of toothpaste.  \nSome weeks there has been no hygiene distribution.40 \n                                                \n39 See, e.g., Chen Y, Chen L, Deng Q, et al.

Declarant F.S. reports that despite persistent requests, it took \nher three days to receive a menstrual pad.  And that pad was a \nspare pad provided by another roommate.41 \n37.  There are consistent reports of inadequate laundry services. \na.  Declarants report going weeks with no sheets and sleeping \ndirectly on mattresses for weeks at a time and not having their \nunderwear or towels laundered for weeks or months at a time.42 \nb.  Declarant Jones reports that she had no undergarments—only \nher jumpsuit—for the first 6 weeks of her incarceration.  \nWomen had to buy underwear and bras by commissary.43  \nv.  Failure to Educate or Inform Detainees \n \n38.  Detainees at the Clayton County Jail are not receiving education about \ncoronavirus, COVID-19, or information about cleaning frequency and reentry \nplanning.  The CDC states that it is imperative that people understand if they are at \nincreased risk for the virus.44  \n                                                \n41 Id. at ¶¶ 15–17.  \n42 Singleton Declaration at ¶ 6; J.H.

Failure to Adequately Test, Isolate, or Provide Medical \nCare to Detainees \n \n39.  Many detainees at the Clayton County Jail are not receiving testing or \ntreatment despite experiencing illnesses consistent with COVID-19.  The \ndeclarations I reviewed are remarkably consistent on several points of inadequate \ncare and housing. \na.  Detainees consistently report poor medical care, waiting days to \nbe evaluated by medical staff, and an inability to get tested \ndespite typical symptoms of coronavirus.

After getting the attention of a trustee, he \nwas told that the officers would require him to wait over six \nhours to seek any medical care.47  Even after doing so, he was \nagain denied medical attention for his symptoms by a jail \nofficer and nurse at pill call.48  W.L.M. was never seen by \nmedical staff. \nb.  Healthy non-symptomatic detainees report living in the same \ncells as symptomatic detainees, and a lack of coordinated \nhousing for detainees with known or suspected COVID-19 \nstatus. \nc.  One declaration reinforces many of my concerns about the jail \nstaff’s failure to provide timely and adequate medical care to \nsick detainees, or to implement appropriate isolation of known \n                                                \n45 W.L.M.

In April, D.H., a trustee responsible for \ncleaning and distributing food trays in another housing unit, \nwas ordered to continue working despite advising both officers \nand medical staff that he was experiencing multiple symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19.49  He describes not being tested or \nquarantined for weeks as he continued to shed virus around the \njail, receiving no medical care despite his repeated requests, and \nwatching as the jail failed to implement a quarantine that could \nhelp contain the virus. \n40.  Declarants report that the Clayton County Jail’s kiosk-based, medical \nrequest system is an ineffective way to seek medical attention or care.  When a \ndetainee is experiencing a medical problem, jail officers tell the detainee to submit \na medical request through the electronic kiosk.  But multiple detainees report filing \nmedical requests when they begin feeling unwell with potential symptoms of \nCOVID-19, only to receive extremely delayed responses.  For example, Randolph \nMitchell submitted one medical request when he felt the onset of potential \nCOVID-19 symptoms and a second request about four days later when he still had \n                                                \n49 Declaration of D.H., at ¶¶ 4, 23–24.

He was not called to the medical unit until eight days after his first \nrequest, and even then, he was not tested for COVID-19 before being sent back to \nhis cell.50  Michael Singleton and other declarants report similar problems.51  \n41.  In other circumstances, the medical request system is simply \nunavailable.  One medically vulnerable declarant reported that the jail staff took \naway her ability to use the kiosk for an alleged disciplinary infraction and, weeks \nlater, still had not yet given it back.52  Since the kiosk is the only way for a detainee \nto submit a medical request, the woman was in the unfortunate position of being \nunable to bring any COVID-19 symptoms or other medical issues to the attention \nof the jail’s medical staff.53 \n42.  These reported deficiencies in the medical request system are \nconcerning because they inhibit timely and accurate communication between \ndetainees and jail staff about issues that impact detainee and jail health.   \n \n \n \n                                                \n50 Declaration of Randolph Mitchell, ECF 6-1 Ex.

Medically Vulnerable Detainees in Particular Face Severe Health Risks \nif Protective Measures Are Not Taken.  \n \n43.  If medically vulnerable detainees are not released as soon as possible, \nin a matter of days, rather than weeks, they are at risk of infection, sequelae such as \nlong-lasting and permanent organ damage, and even death.  Survival from COVID-\n19 does not guarantee a life free from damage from the virus.  Long-term effects of \nCOVID-19 infection include the following: \na.  Lung scarring and decreased lung capacity; \nb.  Stroke, embolism, and blood clotting disorders, which may \nresult in permanent disabilities and amputations; \nc.  Heart damage, including cardiomyopathy and enlarged, \nineffectively pumping hearts; \nd.  Neurological deficits, psychological deficits, and mental \nillness;54  \n44.  Many of the detainees in the Clayton County Jail already have these \ndeficits; infection with coronavirus could cause additional permanent damage and \nimpairment. \n                                                \n54 See, e.g., Lois Parshley, The Emerging Long-Term Complications of Covid-19, \nExplained, Vox (June 12, 2020), \nhttps://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21251899/coronavirus-long-term-effects-\nsymptoms. \n32 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 34 of 59\n \nVII.  Summary and Recommendations \nA. Summary of Findings \n45.  In my review of the declarations, there are few indicators that the \nClayton County Jail is taking action to protect detainees, staff, or visitors from \ninfection from coronavirus.  Without such actions, this infection can progress to \npermanent physical damage and illness and even death. \n46.  There is one area of recent partial compliance with CDC guidelines: \na.  The declarations indicate an apparent start of distribution of \nface masks to detainees.  However, they do not indicate whether \nthis distribution has been universal or how often masks are \ncleaned or changed.  Face masks should be clean and worn by \nall detainees.55  Face masks should also be replaced on an as-\nneeded basis whenever they show signs of soiling or wear. The \nWorld Health Organization provides additional guidance on \nwhen and how to change a mask.56 \n                                                \n55 See Interim Guidance, supra note 2 (“Because many individuals with COVID-19 \ndo not have symptoms, it is important for everyone to wear cloth face coverings in \norder to protect each other.”). \n56 How to Wear a Non-Medical Fabric Mask Safely, World Health Organization, \nhttps://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/clothing-\nmasks-infographic---(web)-logo-who.png?sfvrsn=b15e3742_16 (instructing \n \n33 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 35 of 59\n \n47.  There are several areas of noncompliance with CDC Guidelines: \na.  Lack of social distancing, which is the essential primary \nmitigation strategy.  Declarant housing units are too populated \nto support social distancing.  Detainees are not routinely \ninstructed to maintain a safe distance, and in many cases are \nordered to line up closely to one another to receive basic \nnecessities like food or medication. \nb.  Lack of provision of any protective equipment until late \nMay/early June.  For months, Jail administration and staff \nacted particularly callously by telling detainees to wear a facial \ncovering but requiring them to create their own.  According to \nthe declarations I have reviewed, it was not until late May or \nearly June before masks of any sort were provided, and then \nsome detainees report they were only reluctantly replaced when \ndamaged or ineffective.  \nc.  Shortfalls in secondary mitigation, particularly the facility’s \nsanitary conditions.  Detainees report that cells and housing \n                                                \nindividuals not to wear face masks that are wet, dirty or damaged) (last visited July \n14, 2020).  \n34 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 36 of 59\n \nunits are filthy and have plumbing leaks that promote a baseline \nof unsanitary conditions.  These conditions are unsafe under \nany circumstances but are particularly dangerous in light of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  There are inadequate cleaning supplies.  \nd.  Poor compliance with personal hygiene standards.  As \nreferenced throughout this document, the CDC has clear \nguidelines for routine hygiene and laundry practices—including \nhow to launder institutional items and what protective \nequipment to wear while doing so.57  This implies that \nlaundering is done on a regular basis.  However, the \ndeclarations indicate that this is not being done in Clayton \nCounty.  Detainees state that towels, linens, and jumpsuits are \ndirty, and detainees go weeks to months at a time without them \nbeing laundered.  Moreover, many report having to use their \ntowels for personal hygiene, as face coverings, and for cell \ncleaning.  The CDC recommends a “sufficient supply of soap \nfor each individual,” but the detainees consistently report a lack \n                                                \n57 See CDC Interim Guidance, supra note 2.  \n \n35 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 37 of 59\n \nof soap.58  Detainees also report that they often have to use their \nbody soap to clean their cells and wash their clothes. However, \nthe CDC recommends that soap used for personal hygiene be \nseparate from soap used for other purposes. \ne.  Inadequate and inconsistent education and information \nregarding the virus provided to detainees. Trustees do not \nreport readily available instructions for cleaning, and only \nreport a few very recent signs asking trustees to wear masks and \nsocially distance (which is not possible in their dorms).  Other \ndetainees report a lack of posted signs or other information \nmaterials about how to reduce exposure to the coronavirus, and \ninstead report relying on friends and family for information.   \nf.  Inadequate testing for diagnostic purposes.  Medical staff \nand correctional staff cannot rely only on temperatures to \nidentify people who are infectious and may be shedding the \nvirus to others.  Symptomatic detainees are not promptly tested.  \nWhen detainees test positive for coronavirus, the institution \nshould partner with public health authorities to perform contact \n                                                \n58 Id. \n36 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 38 of 59\n \ntracing.  Contract tracing identifies those detainees and staff \nwho have been in close contact in recent days with the infected \nperson.  This provides information for prompt quarantining and \nmonitoring of asymptomatic individuals who may already be \ninfected and are unknowingly spreading the virus.  Broader \ntesting and robust contact tracing will allow the jail to identify \nbreakouts in housing units and allow minimization of the spread \nof the virus.  \ng.  No consistent approach to housing detainees based on their \nknown COVID-19 status.  Detainees are not consistently \nhoused or moved based on signs, symptoms, or testing.  \nDetainees report infections, and what are likely reinfections, \nbased on lack of cohorting, lack of effective \nisolation/quarantine, and lack of prompt medical intervention.59 \n                                                \n59 However, detention facilities should also avoid complete isolation of detainees \nwhenever possible without concomitant safety procedures.  If part of a COVID-19 \ncontainment or response strategy involves isolation of detainees, as in Clayton \nCounty, the detention facility must acknowledge this requires increased monitoring \nof detainees’ safety, detainees’ mental health, and suicidality wellness checks, and \nshould thus increase staffing accordingly.  When a jail fails to take such measures, \nas Clayton County jail has, administrators place detainees’ physical and mental \nhealth at serious risk. \n37 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 39 of 59\n \n48.  The Clayton County Jail remains an incubator for the coronavirus and \ncurrent practices ensure that people within the facility are not only a risk to \nthemselves, but that they are also a profound risk to the surrounding county and its \nscarce healthcare resources.   \nB. Recommendations \n49.  In my opinion, Clayton County Jail needs to move as quickly as \npossible, in a timeline of days, rather than weeks to: \na.  Release as many medically vulnerable detainees from \nClayton County Jail as soon as possible.  There is no \neffective way to eliminate risk for medically vulnerable \ndetainees in the jail.  The best chance for medically vulnerable \ndetainees to survive the pandemic is to release them from the \njail so they can practice social distancing.  Delays will result in \nmore infections among detainees and staff, more advanced \ndisease, more disease brought back to the community, and \npreventable disease and death.   \nb.  Reduce the remaining population to best approximate social \ndistancing.  Enough detainees should be released so that the \n38 \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: A6FB51D6-92A7-4347-B711-923E3E5FC008\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-3   Filed 07/27/20   Page 40 of 59\n \nremaining detainees in the Jail can more closely approximate \nsocial distancing as defined by the CDC. \nc.  Enforce other CDC guidelines to reduce the risk of infection \nand sequelae through strict adherence to use of PPE, cleaning, \nand hygiene practices by all in the jail environment, including \ndetainees, correctional staff, medical staff, vendors, and other \nvisitors.  This includes, but is not limited to: \ni.  Posting clear signage in multiple languages around the \njail to educate individuals on symptoms of COVID-19, \nprocedure for reporting any such symptoms, and \npreventative measures to slow or stop the spread of \nCOVID-19; \n \nii.  Providing adequate face masks to all staff and detainees, \nmandating their use, and cleaning or replacing them \nregularly; \n \niii.  Supplying detainees with adequate materials for \nintensified cleaning and disinfection practices; \n \niv.  Ensuring that all frequently touched surfaces are \nsanitized between uses or, at minimum, multiple times \nper day; \n \nv.

Sparkman, being competent to make this declaration and \nhaving personal knowledge of the matters stated herein, declare under penalty of \nperjury that the following is true and correct: \n1.  I am over 21 years of age.  The statements contained in this \ndeclaration are based on my personal knowledge, or on information that experts in \nthe field of corrections would reasonably rely on in forming an opinion and are \ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge. \n \n \n \n1 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 3 of 65\n \nI.  Expert Qualifications \nA. Correctional Experience \n \n1.  I am a corrections consultant and subject matter expert with over \nforty-four years of experience working in adult and juvenile institutional and \ncommunity corrections.  My curriculum vitae is attached as Appendix A.   \n2.  I have extensive experience in the operation of correctional facilities, \nin the development of offender classification policies and procedures, and in the \noversight of agency offender classification systems. \n3.  My experience in prison and corrections administrative positions \nincludes responsibility for managing the custody, control, and treatment of \nincarcerated people housed in long-term segregation and on death row. \n4.  I have held line and supervisory positions at correctional facilities in \nthe states of Texas, Kentucky, and Mississippi.  These positions include: \ncorrectional officer, probation officer, education consultant, correctional captain, \ncorrectional major, intake-detention superintendent, director of education, director \nof security, warden, superintendent, and deputy commissioner. \n5.  My experience includes working in both the public and private \ncorrections sectors.  I served as a warden of two private pre-release centers in \n2 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 4 of 65\n \nTexas (1990s), a 936-bed state medium-security prison in Kentucky (1992-1996), \nand a 1,000-bed private medium-security prison in Mississippi (1996-2001). \n6.  In June 2001, I was named the Superintendent of the Mississippi State \nPenitentiary, a prison complex with 18 prisons that included a 1,000-bed supermax \nprison (Unit 32), housing death row and the highest risk prisoners in the custody of \nthe Mississippi Department of Corrections.  I served in that position from June \n2001 until December 2002. \n7.  I was appointed the Deputy Commissioner of Institutions for the \nMississippi Department of Corrections in November 2002 and served in that \nposition until May 2013.  As Deputy Commissioner for Institutions, I was \nresponsible for three state prison complexes, five private prisons, and fifteen \nregional prisons.  I also had responsibility for the classification, records, employee \ntraining, treatment, facilities/engineering, and agriculture departments of the \nAgency. \n8.  Protecting prisoners from infectious diseases was one of my job \nresponsibilities at every correctional facility at which I worked.  As a correctional \nsupervisor and administrator, I had to be prepared to respond to various \ncommunicable diseases and conditions, including avian influenza, scabies, head \nlice, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and many others.  To \n3 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 5 of 65\n \ngive just a few examples, as Deputy Commissioner for the Mississippi Department \nof Corrections, I received technical assistance from the National Institute of \nCorrections to implement policies and procedures (including quarantine/isolation \npolicies) relating to preparedness for avian influenza.  Additionally, I have \nexperience in the development and implementation of policies, training, and \neducational efforts to address outbreaks of MRSA within a state prison system.   \nB. Expert Experience \n9.  I have been a consultant to the states of Illinois, Maryland, Colorado, \nOklahoma, New Mexico, and South Carolina, assisting them to develop strategies \nto reduce the use of long-term segregation and improve conditions of confinement \nin segregation units.  I participated in an evaluation of the use of administrative \nsegregation by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2014. \n10.  I serve as an implementation panel member responsible for \nmonitoring the settlement agreement between the South Carolina Department of \nCorrections and the plaintiffs in T.R., et al. v. South Carolina Department of \nCorrections, et al., C/A No. 2005-CP-40-2925, in the Court of Common Pleas for \nthe Fifth Judicial Circuit, regarding conditions of confinement for mentally ill \nprisoners. \n4 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 6 of 65\n \n11.  I serve as a subject matter expert for the Court Monitors in Nunez v. \nCity of New York, et al., 11 Civ. 5845 (LTS) (JCF) and United States of America v. \nTerritory of the Virgin Islands et al., Civil No. 86-cv-265. \n12.  I have been a certified American Correctional Association auditor \nsince 1995.  I have conducted numerous accreditation audits for the Federal Bureau \nof Prisons and state correction systems and have served both as an audit team \nmember and as an audit chairperson. \n13.  Appendix A includes a list of all my publications in the last ten years, \nall the cases in which I have testified in the last four years, and my fee schedule.   \nII.  Assignment \n14.  I have been asked by Plaintiffs’ counsel to offer my opinion on \nwhether the measures the Clayton County Jail is taking to mitigate the spread of  \nCOVID-19 are minimally adequate and in line with the standards on which \nreasonable correctional administrators would rely in addressing the pandemic.  I \nconclude that they are not.  I was retained in this matter on June 5, 2020. \nIII.  Documents Reviewed \n15.  I have reviewed and relied upon the following documents in forming \nthe opinions set forth in this declaration. \n5 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 7 of 65\n \na.

Older adults and people \nwith certain medical conditions (e.g. lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD), heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, or a weakened \nimmune system) are at higher risk of serious illness or death from the coronavirus.  \n(Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, People with Certain Medical \nConditions,(July 17, 2020): https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-\nextra-precautions/people-with-medical-\n7 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 9 of 65\n \ni.

American Correctional Association. Performance-Based \nStandards for Adult Local Detention Facilities. Fourth Edition. \n \nIV.  Factual Background Regarding the Clayton County Jail \n16.  The Clayton County Jail is a 100,355 square foot facility.  It has a \nmaximum capacity of 1,920 detainees.  (Georgia Department of Community \nAffairs, “County Jail Inmate Information Report,” June 2020.)  As of June 2020, it \nhad an inmate population of 1,847.  (Id. at 8.)  \n17.  The Clayton County Sheriff is responsible for the jail operation.  The \nJail Operation Division consists of two (2) sections: Jail Administrative Operations \nand Jail Security Operations.  Jail Administrative Operations consists of several \nadministrative units that provide the background administrative work that occurs in \nthe jail, including supervision of contractors who perform services inside the jail.  \nOutside services include medical, maintenance, property, commissary, and food \nservice.  Jail Administrative Operations staff perform the non-security functions \n9 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 11 of 65\n \nfor the jail.  Jail Security Operations consists of three (3) teams and the Special \nResponse Team (SRT).   \n18.  Jail Security teams are broken down into three (3) groups of \ncorrectional officers, each working an eight-hour shift. The security teams are \nresponsible for dealing with the detainees on a one-to-one basis, ensuring that they \ncomply with rules, receive meals, and are in good health.  Booking and release of \ndetainees, as well as court and medical appearances, are also the responsibility of \nthe security teams. 2  \nV.  The Clayton County Jail’s Failure to Take Steps to Mitigate the Spread \nof COVID-19 \n \n19.  It is generally accepted in the corrections field that prison and jail \nadministrators must take any infectious disease extremely seriously.  People in jail \nlive in close proximity to one another and share showers, sinks, toilets, and other \nfixtures, so once a single detainee becomes infected with a communicable \ncondition, others are likely to become infected too.  A virus can spread very \nquickly in a jail.   \n20.  In determining a plan to respond to the potential spread of an \ninfectious disease, prison and jail administrators frequently look to both the \n \n2 Website of the Clayton County Sheriff’s Office, \nhttp://www.claytonsheriff.com/JOD.html (last accessed July 22, 2020). \n10 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 12 of 65\n \nNational Institute of Corrections and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) for guidance.  Both entities are authoritative sources on which \ncorrectional administrators commonly rely.  Correctional administrators also look \nto the standards promulgated by the American Correctional Association (ACA) in \nmaking the policies and developing procedures that govern their facilities.   \n21.  Adherence to public health guidelines governing mitigation of \nCOVID-19 in jails is critical because of the substantial health risks involved and \nbecause some infected people do not show symptoms of having the virus.  The \nunmitigated spread of coronavirus inside a jail puts detainees, staff members, and \nthe community at risk. \n22.  Over the last several months, we have seen COVID-19 spread rapidly \nin jails in Chicago, New York City, and elsewhere.  These outbreak events show \nthe urgent need for all jails to adopt preventative strategies to slow the spread of \nthe virus.  Specifically, jail administrators should follow the CDC’s Interim \nGuidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in \nCorrectional and Detention Facilities.  The CDC issued an initial guidance \ndocument in March 2020, and it updated its guidance in July 2020. \n23.  In both versions of the Interim Guidance document, the CDC lists a \nnumber of reasonable measures that jails should take in order to minimize the \n11 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 13 of 65\n \nspread of COVID-19.  While some of these measures are directed at a jail’s \nmedical provider, many other recommended measures (such as those dealing with \nsanitation, the stocking of supplies, daily schedules, inmate and staff education \nefforts, and others), come within the purview of a jail’s administrative and security \nstaff.   \n24.  From my review of the documents listed above, it is my opinion that \nthe Clayton County Sheriff has failed to implement measures that any reasonable \ncorrectional administrator would know to implement in the context of the COVID-\n19 pandemic and the particular outbreak at his facility.  Further, the Clayton \nCounty Jail has not followed CDC recommendations in several key respects.  \nThese failures fall into several categories, including: \na.  Absence of a written policy regarding COVID-19; \nb.  Impossibility of “social distancing” in overcrowded cells;  \nc.  Failure to encourage social distancing in common areas; \nd.  Inadequate cleaning and sanitation; \ne.  Inadequate quantities of soap and lack of hand sanitizer; \nf.  Failure to provide clean laundry; \ng.  Failure to provide face coverings to detainees; \nh.  Failure to educate detainees about COVID-19; \ni.  Barriers to submitting medical requests and grievances; \nj.  Failure to identify, isolate, and care for people with COVID-19; \nk.  Improper quarantine/isolation practices; and  \n12 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 14 of 65\n \nl.  Failure to suspend work release and “Weekender” program. \n25.  These categories are discussed in turn below. \nA. Absence of a Written Policy Regarding COVID-19   \n26.  At this point in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all \ncorrectional facilities (let alone one housing almost 2,000 people) should have \nwritten policies describing the measures that staff members and detainees are \nexpected to take to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \n27.  The Clayton County Jail does not appear to have any COVID-19-\nspecific policy.  I have examined the materials provided by the Sheriff’s Office in \nresponse to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s request for COVID-19-related standard operating \nprocedures, bulletins, or other policy documents.  The documents provided by the \nSheriff’s Office consist of various emails, a link to a COVID-19-related webinar, \nand a perfunctory document titled “Steps Taken to Prevent and If a Mass Outbreak \nOccurs.”  This last document appears to be an aspirational list of measures to \naddress COVID-19 in the jail, many of which have not been actually implemented \naccording to numerous, consistent detainee declarations.  \n28.  None of these documents, in any event, is a standard operating \nprocedure in any sense of that term with which I am familiar.  None sets forth steps \nthat staff and detainees are expected to follow to reduce virus transmission.  \n13 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 15 of 65\n \nNeither have I seen evidence that the Jail has a more general emergency plan to \naddress novel and unexpected diseases such as COVID-19.  Every jail should have \nsuch a plan, and the ACA ALDF standards requires it.3  The Clayton County Jail \nshould adopt written policies and procedures that conform to CDC guidelines to \naddress the risks posed by COVID-19.        \nB. Impossibility of “Social Distancing” in Overcrowded Cells \n29.  In my corrections experience, contagious diseases and bacteria can \nspread rapidly under normal jail conditions.  MRSA, for example, could quickly \nspread through an entire housing unit if left unchecked.  In responding to a serious \ncommunicable disease like COVID-19, any jail administrator would understand \nthat it is imperative to change the practices in the facility to promote social \ndistancing and minimize detainees’ physical contact with each other and with staff.  \n \n3 The ACA requires correctional facilities to have a “communicable disease and \ninfection control program,” which should include “a written plan that addresses the \nmanagement of infectious and communicable diseases.”  (ACA Standards, \n“Communicable Disease and Infection Control Program, 4-ALDF-4C-14”, \nPerformance Based Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (4th ed.).)  \nThe plan should incorporate “procedures for prevention, education, identification, \nsurveillance, immunization (when applicable) treatment, follow-up, isolation \n(when indicated) and reporting requirements to applicable local, state, and federal \nagencies.”  (Id.)  \n \n14 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 16 of 65\n \n30.  In their declarations, numerous Clayton County Jail detainees stated \nthat they were housed three-to-a-cell in cells designed for only two people.  For \nexample, Plaintiff Barry Watkins is one of three people housed in a two-man cell.  \n(Watkins Decl. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff Rhonda Jones sleeps on the floor of a two-person \ncell with three people in it.  (Jones Decl. ¶ 6.)  Detainee F.S. slept on the floor \nduring her entire incarceration in a cell designed for two people, but housing three \npeople.  (F.S. Decl. ¶ 9.)  W.L.M stated: “Most if not all of the cells in my dorm \nhave three people in each two-person cell.  One person sleeps on the floor in each \nof these cells.”  (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 12.)  \n31.  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the jail remains at 96% capacity, \nwhich is a root cause of so many people sleeping on the floors of overcrowded \ncells.  It is not possible for detainees to practice social distancing while confined to \nsmall cells with two other people in them.  It is particularly worrying that older \npeople and medically vulnerable people are housed in overcrowded cells in a \nfacility where so many people have tested positive for COVID-19.4   \n \n4 Plaintiff Rhonda Jones indicated in her declaration she is a 58-year-old female \nwith significant health problems, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD) and hepatitis C.  (Jones Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  She has been hospitalized for \npneumonia two times in the last eight months.  (Id.)  Yet she is one of three people \nin a cell designed for two people (id. ¶ 6) in a jail with surging cases of COVID-19.   \n \n15 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 17 of 65\n \n32.  Detainees are required to remain in their cells for most of the day and \nare only allowed out for one to two hours per day, sometimes less often.  (Watkins \nDecl. ¶ 9 (stating that he is permitted out of his cell for about 60-90 minutes each \nday).)5    \n33.  Even in the absence of a global pandemic, the Jail’s policy of housing \ndetainees three to a two-man cell (requiring one person to sleep on a thin mat on \nthe floor) is a threat to public health and to security.  ACA ALDF standards require \nmattresses to be 12 inches off the floor for obvious reasons, preventing the \nindividual from having contact with unhealthy floor conditions. 6  Housing three \npersons to a cell creates very unhealthy and dehumanizing conditions for the \nindividuals to perform basic hygiene and toilet functions.  Placing three persons in \na cell rated for two persons frequently results in disagreements/altercations \n \n5 Detainees report that they are infrequently, if ever, allowed outside for fresh air.  \nM.B. described only being allowed outside one time in the last year for fresh air.  \n(M.B. Decl. ¶ 9.)  Many detainees reported no time in the yard at all for the \nduration of their incarceration.  (Watkins Decl. ¶ 12 (“In 21 months at the jail, I \nhave never been allowed out into the ‘yard.’”).) \n \n6 ACA ALDF standards require that each person confined in a cell is provided “a \nsleeping surface and mattress that allows the inmate to be at least 12 inches off the \nfloor.”  (ACA, “Cell/Room Furnishings, Standard 4-ALDF-1A-11,” \nPerformance Based Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (4th ed.).) \n \n16 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 18 of 65\n \nbetween detainees. These conflicts can jeopardize safety and security of the \nincarcerated persons and staff.   \n34.  Recognized national jail standards have established the recommended \nminimum encumbered and unencumbered square footage to be provided to each \ndetainee in a cell.7  From the descriptions in detainees’ declarations, the cells do \nnot meet these minimum square footage standards for each detainee.      \nC. Failure to Encourage Social Distancing in Common Areas During \n“Free Time,” Meal Distribution, Medication Distribution, and \nTransport within the Facility \n  \n35.  Reasonable correctional officials know that in an infectious disease \nscenario, steps must be taken to reduce close contact between people who are \ninfected or possibly infected.  In the age of COVID-19, correctional administrators \nshould encourage social distancing wherever possible, in particular for older \ndetainees and people with certain health conditions.  The CDC’s most recent \nInterim Guidance document states:  \nAlthough social distancing is challenging to practice in correctional and \ndetention environments, it is a cornerstone of reducing transmission of \nrespiratory diseases such as COVID-19.  People who have been infected \nwith SARS-CoV-2 but do not have symptoms can still spread the infection, \nmaking social distancing even more important.  (CDC Interim Guidance, p. \n4 (Mar. 23, 2020).)   \n \n7 (American Correctional Association. Performance-Based Standards for Adult \nLocal Detention Facilities (4th ed.).)  \n \n17 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 19 of 65\n \n \n36.  The first thing jail administrators can do to help achieve social \ndistancing is to review who is in a jail and take steps to release people, consistent \nwith public safety, where possible.  It does not appear that such efforts have been \nmade at the Clayton County Jail, which is even now at about 96% capacity.  As \njust one example, at the time this case was filed, Plaintiff Mitchell, age 72, had \nserved about 10 months of a 12-month sentence for a misdemeanor.  (Mitchell \nDecl. ¶¶ 2-3, 21.)  This was so even though the Sheriff had the authority to release \nhim under Georgia’s “good time” statute.   \n37.  Given that the jail is at capacity and experiencing a COVID-19 \noutbreak, jail administrators should review the jail roster to determine who can be \nreleased.  They should involve their medical and classification staff in the process.  \nThe medical staff should be asked to make a list of people most vulnerable to \nserious illness or death from COVID-19.  The classification staff should look at the \nroster to recommend who can be released consistent with law and public safety.  \nJail administrators should examine those findings and release people accordingly \nwhere possible. \n38.  To protect those who remain incarcerated, jail administrators are \nencouraged by the CDC to “[i]mplement social distancing strategies to increase the \nphysical space between incarcerated/detained persons (ideally 6 feet between all \n18 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 20 of 65\n \nindividuals, regardless of symptoms), and to minimize mixing of individuals from \ndifferent housing units.”  (CDC Interim Guidance (July 7, 2020).)  Jails should \nfurther “[m]ake a list of possible social distancing strategies that could be \nimplemented as needed at different stages of transmission intensity.”  (Id. at 5.) \n39.  Here too, only minimal efforts to achieve social distancing have been \nmade in detainee housing areas in the Clayton County Jail.  While the jail changed \nits “free-time” schedule to permit smaller groups out of their cells at a time, social \ndistancing is not required or even encouraged when “free time” is allowed, \naccording to the declarations I reviewed.  Since out-of-cell time is limited, \ndetainees must hurriedly take showers and use communal telephones and kiosks \nbefore being returned to their cells.  (Singleton Decl. ¶ 4.)  As noted below, \ndetainees reported no education about social distancing, so people crowd together \nduring the limited “free time” hours.  (Id. (“Officers do not impose social \ndistancing during these times, nor do they provide us with masks.”); Watkins Decl. \n¶ 11 (“People do not keep six feet of distance between them, particularly when \nusing the showers, phones, or the kiosk.”).) \n40.  At other times of day, jail staff do not encourage or require social \ndistancing at all.  “Pill call” line operates as it did before the pandemic, with \ncrowds of detainees lining up close to each other to await their medication.  \n19 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 21 of 65\n \n(Mitchell Decl. ¶ 7; Watkins Decl. ¶ 14; W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 10.)  People with diabetes \nline up to receive insulin and/or blood glucose level monitoring in lines of 20-30 \npeople (or 50-75 people if several dorms are released at once).  (Watkins Decl. ¶ \n27; see also W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 9 (stating that during “diabetic call” he would stand \nnear about 30 other people in a closely packed group or single file line.).)   \n41.  During movement for afternoon meals, detainees line up in crowds, \nwith no efforts by officers to impose social distancing.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶ 7; \nSingleton Decl. ¶ 4; Watkins Decl. ¶ 13.)  While waiting for medical appointments, \ndetainees wait in a crowded waiting area.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶ 15.)   \n42.  Another risky practice is the manner in which people are moved \nthrough the jail for video court appearances.  (Singleton Decl. ¶ 11.)  People are \nheld together in large, crowded holding cells, and in many instances the detainees \ncrowded together lack masks.  (Id. (stating that he waited for court in a holding cell \nwith about 25 other detainees, only 6 or 7 of whom were wearing masks).) \n43.  Clayton County Jail procedures should be revised to require six feet \nbetween all persons during movement whenever possible.  Out-of-cell activities, \nincluding meal service, medication distribution, and other activities, should be \nstaggered to ensure detainees and staff can remain six feet apart.  As noted below, \nstaff and detainees should receive education to emphasize the importance of social \n20 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 22 of 65\n \ndistancing.  Management and supervisory staff should be vigilant in monitoring \nand enforcing social distancing where possible. \nD. Inadequate Cleaning and Sanitation Regimen \n44.  In my experience, regular cleaning and sanitation efforts are critical to \nmaintaining a safe environment for inmates.  Jails should, under normal \ncircumstances, have a regular housekeeping plan to address sanitation matters.  \nThis is important in part because unclean living areas promote the spread of \ninfectious diseases, viruses, and bacteria.  One of the important duties of prison \nand jail administrators is to develop a cleaning plan, stock adequate supplies of \nchemicals and cleaning materials, train inmates and staff in how to use cleaning \nsupplies, and supervise the cleaning of all areas of the facility.  Given the \nseriousness and prevalence of COVID-19, any jail administrator would understand \nthe need for intensive sanitation measures during this time.   \n45.  Not surprisingly, the CDC has provided detailed recommendations \nregarding the need for “intensified cleaning and disinfecting procedures” in light of \nCOVID-19.  (CDC Interim Guidance (July 7, 2020).)  In pertinent part, the \nguidelines state: \nEven if COVID-19 has not yet been identified inside the facility or \nin the surrounding community, implement intensified cleaning \nand disinfecting procedures according to the recommendations below. \n21 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 23 of 65\n \nThese measures can help prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 if introduced, and \nif already present through asymptomatic infections.  (Id.) \n \nAdhere to CDC recommendations for cleaning and disinfection during the \nCOVID-19 response. Monitor these recommendations for updates.  (Id. at \n9.) \n \nSeveral times per day, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are \nfrequently touched, especially in common areas. Such surfaces may include \nobjects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily (e.g., doorknobs, light \nswitches, sink handles, countertops, toilets, toilet handles, recreation \nequipment, kiosks, telephones, and computer equipment).  (Id.) \n \nUse household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants effective against \nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 as appropriate for the \nsurface. . . . Clean according to label instructions, to ensure safe and \neffective use, appropriate product dilution and contact time.  (Id.) \n \nEnsure adequate supplies to support intensified cleaning and disinfection \npractices and have a plan in place to restock rapidly if needed.  (Id.) \n \n46.  Detainee declarations and grievances consistently report that the \nintensified cleaning regimen recommended by the CDC is not occurring in the \nClayton County Jail.   \n47.  Housing unit areas and fixture surfaces such as tables, restroom areas, \nwalls, phones, and kiosks are not cleaned before and after use. (Singleton Decl. ¶ 4 \n(stating that “[c]ommon areas, kiosks, and phones are not cleaned or wiped down \nin between uses.”); F.S. Decl. ¶ 12 (stating that common areas were cleaned \ninfrequently, and that phones and kiosks were not cleaned between uses); W.L.M. \nDecl. ¶ 13 (same).) \n22 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 24 of 65\n \n48.  Cleaning supplies, such as sponges and clean rags, are in short supply.  \n(Mitchell Decl. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff Mitchell stated that he had to use toilet paper to \nwipe his sink basin and other fixture surfaces due to the clean rags or sanitary \ndisinfectant wipes not being available.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  Barry Watkins similarly stated: \n“The only thing we can use to clean our cells is our towel or spare bits of toilet \npaper.”  (Watkins Decl. ¶ 24.)   \n49.  Cleaning fluids are also in short supply.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶ 9 (stating \nthat a mop bucket is brought around infrequently and reporting that on a recent \nmorning, an orderly brought him a bucket of dirty water with no mop); F.S. Decl. ¶ \n13 (stating that a mop was brought around once per week and that there was a \n“race to use the mop before the water became dirty and unusable, which happened \nquickly.”).) \n50.  The failure to provide cleaning supplies is also problematic because \nplumbing problems at the jail lead to toilet water flooding certain cells or pooling \nin the housing unit common rooms.  (C.C. Decl. ¶ 17-18.)  One detainee described \nbeing placed in a cell with “an overpowering smell of feces from an overflowing \ntoilet.”  (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 11.)  Another detainee described having to urinate in the \nsink for weeks because of a broken toilet.  (C.C. Decl. ¶ 17.)  Plaintiff Rhonda \nJones stated that toilet water with a “putrid odor” leaks out of the base of her toilet, \n23 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 25 of 65\n \nthat she sleeps on a thin mattress on the floor, and that she put blankets on the cell \nfloor to sop up the toilet water.  (Jones Decl. ¶¶ 6, 12.)         \n51.  In short, the “intensified cleaning” recommended by the CDC does \nnot appear to be happening at the Clayton County Jail.  On the contrary, the \ndeclarations I have reviewed describe poorly performed cleaning and sanitizing on \nan infrequent basis. \n52.  Staff and detainees must be provided an adequate amount of cleaning \nchemicals and supplies to ensure staff and detainees can frequently clean all areas \nand surfaces before and after each use.   \n53.  Improved cleaning is especially needed for areas where people with \nCOVID-19 have been housed.  (CDC Interim Guidance (July 7, 2020) (stating that \njails should “[t]horoughly and frequently clean and disinfect all areas where \nindividuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 spend time.”).) \nE. Inadequate Quantities of Soap and Lack of Hand Sanitizer \n54.  Permitting detainees to have access to sufficient quantities of soap and \nother personal hygiene items is critical to personal health inside a jail.  That is true \nat any time but is particularly true during a pandemic.  Under pre-pandemic \ncircumstances, correctional administrators may ration or limit certain supplies, \nsuch as soap or toothpaste, to a certain amount for a period of time.  At a jail where \n24 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 26 of 65\n \nmany people are testing positive for COVID-19, however, any reasonable \ncorrectional administrator would know to modify the procedures, especially \nprocedures pertaining to the rationing of soap. \n55.  The CDC guidance recognizes the importance of ensuring an adequate \nsupply of soap.  The CDC recommends that correctional facilities should provide \nno-cost, liquid or foam soap to incarcerated persons.  (CDC Interim Guidelines, p. \n9.)  Jails must “[e]nsure a sufficient supply of soap for each individual.”  (Id. at 7.)   \n56.  Detainees at the Clayton County Jail report that they do not have \nanywhere near enough soap.  Specifically, detainees report that they are issued four \nounces of liquid soap per week, an amount that detainees use for showering, in-cell \ncleaning, and laundering.  (Singleton Decl. ¶ 6 (stating that he uses his soap to \nshower, clean his towel, and clean his cell floor); Watkins Decl. ¶ 15 (stating that \nhe must use his soap for handwashing, showering, washing clothes, and cleaning \nhis cell, and that the four ounces provided “does not last any of us for the whole \nweek.”); C.C. Decl. ¶ 12 (stating that he is not given chemicals or disinfectant to \nclean his cell, and that “I do my best to clean with my personal issued soap”); F.S. \nDecl. ¶ 14 (stating that the small amount of liquid soap provided was the only \nmaterial with which to clean cells, wash hands, and use in the shower).)   \n25 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 27 of 65\n \n57.  On occasion, no soap is provided at all.  (C.C. Decl. ¶ 13 (stating that \non May 21, 2020, no one in his dorm received soap at weekly “hygiene call,” \nmeaning that most people in the dorm went without soap for the week).) \n58.  The amount of soap provided at the Clayton County Jail is woefully \ninadequate to ensure the kind of frequent hand washing needed to stop the spread \nof a contagious illness.  If a person runs out of soap, more should be provided, and \nit should be provided immediately.  This is not a time to maintain strict adherence \nto existing procedures about soap quantity.  Soap, paper towels, and other hygiene \nitems should be readily available upon request for detainees.   \n59.  Further, detainees at the Clayton County Jail are not provided access \nto hand sanitizer.  The CDC urges correctional facilities to “[c]onsider relaxing \nrestrictions on allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer . . . where security concerns \nallow.”   \n60.  In my professional opinion, under the exigent circumstances of this \npandemic, hand sanitizer should be allowed and is critical to controlling spread of \nthe coronavirus inside correctional facilities.  In the free world, people typically \nhave access to soap and a sink, and they can wash hands as needed.  A jail is a \ndifferent environment.  Detainees may not have control over handwashing \npractices.  People may not have access to a sink and soap as they move around the \n26 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 28 of 65\n \njail to places like the medical unit or video court.  Crowding around a common \nsink for handwashing is itself to be avoided.  For these reasons, as recommended \nby the CDC, detainees should be provided an unlimited supply of alcohol-based \nsanitizer.   \n61.  I understand that correctional facilities sometimes avoid the provision \nof alcohol-based sanitizer because of the risk that a person could consume it.  But \nthe coronavirus threat substantially outweighs the security risk, especially at a jail \nwhere 72 people have tested positive for COVID-19.  Hand sanitizer can be \nstationed in areas where correctional officers have a direct line of sight.  Multiple \ncorrectional agencies have suspended the prohibition on detainees having access to \nhand sanitizer during the coronavirus pandemic, and for good reason. \nF. Failure to Provide Clean Laundry \n62.  In a large correctional facility, it is imperative to have procedures in \nplace to provide for routine laundering of clothing, towels, linens, and other items. \nThe provision of clean laundry is crucial to avoiding the spread of virus, bacteria, \nand parasites, and also helps to preserve people’s sense of wellbeing and dignity.  \nFor these reasons, ACA ALDF standards contain detailed guidance on the \n27 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 29 of 65\n \nprovision of clothing and bedding, and the intervals at which those items should be \nlaundered (weekly, for example, for sheets and towels).8   \n63.  As with cleaning, under the present circumstances, laundering \nprocedures should be intensified.  Not surprisingly, the CDC recommends special \nprecautions for handling laundry of those with COVID-19.  (CDC Interim \nGuidance (July 7, 2020).)  The CDC also recommends that face coverings should \nbe “routinely” laundered.  (Id. at 9.)   \n64.  Routine laundry service of jumpsuits, sheets, towels, and like items \nappears to be a problem at the Clayton County Jail.  Declarant M.B. described \nhaving to wear a dirty jumpsuit for a month, and female detainees without \nmonetary funds did not have access to clean undergarments.  (M.B. Decl. ¶ 11.)  \nPlaintiff Barry Watkins described having to wear unclean jumpsuits and \nunderwear.  (Watkins Decl. ¶ 17-19 (stating that his underclothes had not been \ntaken to be laundered in over a month, that sheets are “rarely cleaned,” and that his \n \n8 ACA standards require that inmates are issued suitable, clean bedding and linens, \nincluding 2 sheets, pillow and pillowcase, one mattress not to exclude a mattress \nwith an integrated pillow, and sufficient blankets to provide comfort under existing \ntemperature controls.  (ACA, “Bedding Issue, Standard 4-ALDF-4B-02,” \nPerformance Based Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (4th ed.).)  This \nACA standard further requires “[a] provision for linen exchange, including towels, \nat least weekly.”  (Id.) \n \n28 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 30 of 65\n \ntowel had not been laundered in 21 months).)  Declarant W.L.M. noted that he had \nnever been issued a towel or washcloth, stated that he used his socks as a towel, \nand noted that he had gone without sheets for the last 6 weeks.  (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ \n15-16.)  Requiring detainees to wear dirty jumpsuits, to shower with dirty towels, \nand to wear dirty face coverings will undermine the goal of promoting good \nhygiene practices.  The Jail should comply with CDC guidelines and ACA ALDF \nstandards relating to laundering, especially laundering of facemasks and other \nitems belonging to infected persons. \nG. Failure to Provide Cloth Face Coverings to Detainees \n65.  In my opinion, following the CDC’s guidance and issuing face \ncoverings would be a high priority for any jail administrator concerned with \npreventing the spread of COVID-19.  Because of the difficulty of social distancing \nin jails, uniform mask use among detainees and staff would be an obvious and \nrelatively inexpensive safeguard that any reasonable jail administrator would \nimplement \n66.  The CDC guidelines state that all detainees and staff should be \nencouraged “to wear a cloth face covering as much as safely possible” to prevent \nvirus transmission “through respiratory droplets.”  (CDC Interim Guidance  (July \n7, 2020).)  The CDC also urges facilities to “ensure sufficient stocks” of hygiene \n29 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 31 of 65\n \nitems including “cloth face coverings” and to “have a plan in place to restock as \nneeded.”  (Id. at 7.)  The CDC guidelines characterize “wearing cloth face \ncoverings” as “critical in preventing further transmission.”  (Id. at 8.)  Jails should \n“[p]rovide cloth face coverings at no cost to incarcerated/detained individuals and \nlaunder them routinely.”  (Id. at 9.) \n67.  Contrary to the CDC guidance, multiple Clayton County Jail detainees \nstated that they were not provided sanitary masks, and they had to improvise and \nmake their own from dirty and/or worn clothing, towels, and rags.  For example, \nM.B. said that she asked a jail officer to provide her a mask and was refused, so \nused “a scrap of old, ripped underwear around [her] face as a makeshift mask.”  \n(M.B Decl. ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff Michel Singleton stated on June 24 that only newly \narrived detainees had masks, and that he constructed his out of a torn sheet.  \n(Singleton Decl. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff Randolph Mitchell stated that he asked an officer \nfor a mask, but the officer replied that masks were “only for officers and trustees.” \n(Mitchell Decl. ¶ 20.)  Mr. Mitchell resorted to purchasing a mask (made of a torn \nT-shirt and the elastic from a pair of underwear) from another detainee in exchange \nfor two packages of soup.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶ 19.)  Declarant C.C. stated that \n“[a]lmost no one has face masks to protect them from COVID-19.  The only \npeople who get real masks are those at intake.”  (C.C. Decl. ¶ 22.)     \n30 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 32 of 65\n \n68.  Appropriate face coverings and PPE must be provided to staff and \ndetainees, as recommended by the CDC.  Staff and detainees should be required to \nwear a face covering when they are in an area with another person.   \n69.  Sufficient quantities of PPE should be available for wearing and \nroutine issue.  Staff and detainees should be educated on wearing face coverings \nand PPE, how to take them on and off, and how to launder and/or disinfect them.   \nH. Failure to Educate and Inform Detainees About COVID-19 \n70.  Slowing the transmission of a communicable disease in a prison or jail \nsetting requires education of staff and detainees.  When I was a Deputy \nCommissioner in Mississippi, I saw firsthand the importance of educating and \ntraining staff and detainees to mitigate the rapid spread of MRSA.  To slow \ntransmission, staff and detainees needed to know the symptoms of MRSA, good \nhygiene and laundering practices, what to do if a person developed MRSA, and so \non.  We developed and conducted staff trainings and created informational \nmaterial, based on CDC and other guidelines.      \n71.  The same educational principles apply here, but even more urgently.  \nFirst, there should be a mandatory training for all staff on preventative measures.9   \n \n9 The staff training can be computer-based.  The substance of the training should be \nin accordance with CDC guidelines. \n31 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 33 of 65\n \nSecond, jail administrators need to make sure that detainees are educated regarding \nCOVID-19.  The CDC recommends that correctional administrators should “[p]ost \nsigns throughout the facility” explaining COVID-19 prevention measures and \nshould “communicate this information verbally on a regular basis.”  (CDC Interim \nMeasures, p. 6.)  According to the CDC, the signage and verbal communications \nshould be aimed at the following: \na.  ensuring that all persons in the jail know the symptoms of COVID-19 \nand how to respond if they develop symptoms; \nb.  ensuring that all persons wear face coverings, avoid sharing dishes \nand utensils, and wash hands regularly; \nc.  providing clear information to detainees about the need to increase \nsocial distancing.  (See id.)   \n72.  Correctional administrators should also “[e]nsure that materials can be \nunderstood by non-English speakers and those with low literacy and make \nnecessary accommodations for those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities and \nthose who are deaf, blind, or have low vision.”  (Id.)  Given the scope of the Jail’s \noutbreak (and the likelihood that some detainees cannot read posted signs), other \nmethods of information dissemination should also be used, like regular public \n32 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 34 of 65\n \nannouncements over the intercom system, an informational video on close circuit \ntelevision, and/or the use of a designated telephone line to provide information. \n73.  None of the above appears to be happening at the Clayton County Jail \nbased on the declarations and grievances I reviewed.  On the contrary, detainee \ndeclarations provided consistent information that detainees were not receiving any \ncoronavirus information or education of any kind.   \n74.  According to the detainee declarations, no COVID-19-related signage \nis posted in the jail and the administration has not taken any other steps to inform \ndetainees about how they can protect themselves from the coronavirus.  (Mitchell \nDecl. ¶ 22 (“I have not received any information from jail staff about COVID-19 \nor how to protect myself.  There are no signs in the dorm about protecting \nourselves from COVID-19.”); Singleton Decl. ¶ 11 (“I have not received any \ninformation from the jail staff about COVID-19, or how to protect myself.”); \nWatkins Decl. ¶ 32 (“Officers in the jail have given us no information at all about \nCOVID-19 and its symptoms.”); F.S. Decl. ¶ 19 (“[T]hose of us incarcerated in the \njail were not told anything about the disease’s symptoms or how to slow the spread \nof the virus by the jail staff.”); W.L.M. Decl. ¶ 17 (“I have received no information \nabout COVID-19 from the jail.”).) \n33 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 35 of 65\n \n75.  The jail is also lacking in sound and clear procedures for detainees to \nreport coronavirus symptoms to medical and/or non-medical staff.  In short, based \non the declarations I have reviewed, the CDC’s recommendations regarding \ndetainee education have not been followed. \nI.  Barriers to Submitting Medical Requests and Grievances \n76.  Detainees must have unimpeded access to submit grievances \nregarding conditions of confinement, particularly related to medical care.  Staff \nshould provide a substantive response to grievances in a timely manner.  At this \nmoment, it is more important than ever that detainees be able to report illness, \nrequest cleaning supplies, or otherwise communicate with jail staff about matters \nrelating to COVID-19. \n77.  The Clayton County Jail requires detainees to electronically submit \nconditions of confinement complaints and medical requests via kiosks located in \nthe detainee housing units.  Multiple detainee declarations described an inability \nand/or difficulty accessing the complaint system and making medical requests \nusing the kiosk. \n78.  For example, M.B. reported a history of breast cancer and thyroid \nproblems.  (M.B. Decl. ¶ 12.)  She also experienced possible coronavirus \nsymptoms, but she was not able to contact the jail’s medical department to report \n34 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 36 of 65\n \nthose symptoms.  (Id. ¶ 18.)  Her attempts to access the kiosk were unsuccessful \nbecause she was “on restriction” for a disciplinary violation (allegedly being in \nsomeone else’s cell).  (Id. ¶ 19.)   \n79.  Similarly, Plaintiff Randolph Mitchell stated that he tried to file a \ngrievance about the jail’s failure to protect people from COVID-19, but the kiosk \nsystem would not accept his grievance.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶ 24 (“The kiosk screen \nshowed that I had ‘used up’ all my grievances and could not file any more.”).)   \n80.  When detainees do file grievances, they often receive no response.  In \nthe grievances I reviewed, 22 out of 29 grievances had no response from staff \nmembers.  Other grievances received vague responses, such as “I will address your \nconcerns” or “thank you for the information.” \n81.  Detainees also stated that the Clayton County Jail did not issue them \nan Inmate Handbook.  (Mitchell Decl. ¶ 23.)  Typically, correctional facilities \nprovide handbooks with information about the jail, particularly the procedures for \naccessing services such as healthcare and the process to request assistance from jail \nofficials. \n82.  Denying a detainee access to the kiosk to submit grievances or \ncomplaints related to conditions of confinement because of disciplinary sanctions \n35 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 37 of 65\n \nis extremely problematic.  Blocking detainees’ access to the kiosk will make it \nmore difficult for people to report symptoms of COVID-19. \nJ.  Failure to Identify, Isolate, and Care for People With COVID-19 \n83.  Any reasonable correctional administrator would know that a person \ninfected with the coronavirus should not be housed in the same cell with an \nuninfected person.  Any reasonable correctional administrator would also know \nthat people experiencing active symptoms of COVID-19 should be isolated (so that \nthey do not infect other people) and provided with medical care. \n84.  In accordance with these principles, the CDC states that “[f]acilities \nshould make every possible effort to individually quarantine cases of confirmed \nCOVID-19, and close contacts of individuals with confirmed, or suspected \nCOVID-19.”  (CDC Interim Guidance (July 7, 2020).)  The CDC further states that \n“[i]ncarcerated/detained persons who are close contacts of someone with \nconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 . . . should be placed under quarantine for 14 \ndays.”  (Id. at 18.)   \n85.  According to the declarations I have reviewed, these measures are not \nbeing followed in the Clayton County Jail.  Rather people report being left in their \ncells with cellmates who have active symptoms of COVID-19.  \n36 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 38 of 65\n \n86.  One detainee, W.L.M., described being placed into a cell with a man \nwho appeared to be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (difficulty breathing, \ncold sweats, and diarrhea) and had just been tested for the virus.  (W.L.M. Decl. ¶ \n18.)  W.L.M. began experiencing symptoms of the virus not long thereafter.  (Id. ¶ \n21.)  He describes a horrific experience of becoming extremely ill, stating: \nThe two weeks after my COVID-19 test, including the time we were under \nlockdown, were some of the darkest days of my life. I began to experience \nsevere symptoms and excruciating pain. I had such severe bowel problems \nthat I did not stand to urinate for approximately nine days because of my \ninability to hold down food and water. I went through 14 rolls of toilet paper \nin approximately ten days. I would have to beg an officer for more toilet \npaper on my way back from diabetic call each night. I lost about fifteen \npounds over those two weeks. I was weak and fatigued, and I struggled to \nmake it back and forth from medical during diabetic call. Worst of all, I had \nimmense difficulty breathing.  \n \nOne night during those two weeks stands out as the most terrifying night of \nmy life. Approximately ten days after I first began experiencing these \nsymptoms, on or around May 23, 2020, my condition took another turn for \nthe worse. At approximately 1:00 a.m., I began to feel severe pain in my \nlungs; it felt as if my lungs were going to collapse. I could not breathe. I \nbegan to bang on my cell door because the emergency call button in my cell \ndoes not work. My cellmate, E.R., told me that banging on the door would \nnot work either: no one was coming to help. I believed I was going to die \nthat night.  \n \nEventually, the banging on the door caught the attention of a trustee \n(“inmate worker”), who was cleaning in my dorm. I began to wave toilet \npaper in the cell door window to flag him down. Through the crack in my \ndoor, I told him that I was having difficulty breathing and asked him to get \nan officer. The trustee went to the officer booth. When he returned, he told \nme that the officer had told him that I had to wait until count to speak with \n37 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 39 of 65\n \nan officer. At this point in the night, the next count was over six hours away. \nI did not think I was going to make it another six hours.  (Id. ¶¶ 28-30.)  \n \n87.  Another detainee, Plaintiff Barry Watkins, reported that he attempted \nto summon an officer after his cellmate, who had symptoms of COVID-19, started \nvomiting in his cell.  (Watkins Decl. ¶ 39.)  The officer responded that he would \nnot come to the cell unless the cellmate was “passed out or bleeding.”  (Id.)  It was \ntwo days before the cellmate was called to the medical unit.  (Id. ¶ 40.)  When Mr. \nWatkins himself experienced symptoms including a cough, aches, diarrhea, and \nextreme fatigue, a nurse took his temperature, said he had no fever, and sent him \nback to his cell.  (Id. ¶ 37.)   \n88.  Yet another detainee, F.S., described her cellmate (C.H.) experiencing \ncoronavirus symptoms, to the point where C.H. was coughing up blood and needed \nhelp to get up to use the toilet.  (F.S. Decl. ¶¶ 23-24.)  Although F.S. reported the \nsymptoms to an officer, no one removed C.H. from the cell and C.H. did not \nreceive medical treatment.  (Id. ¶ 24.)  F.S. stated that she later began experiencing \npounding headaches, sore throat, chills and vomiting.  (Id. ¶ 25.)  When she \npressed the call button in her cell for staff assistance, no one responded.  (Id.)  She \ntold an officer who was taking count about her symptoms and she was advised to \nsubmit a medical request.  (Id.)  A week after she submitted a medical request \nstating her symptoms and need for urgent medical care, a nurse saw her during pill \n38 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 40 of 65\n \ncall and gave her Tylenol.  (Id.)  She was not isolated and not tested for COVID-\n19.  (Id. ¶ 27)   \n89.  In his declaration, J.H. indicated he believed he was exposed to \nCOVID-19 in the jail, and that he experienced symptoms of COVID-19, including \nfever, shortness of breath, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue.  (J.H. Decl. ¶ 30.)  \nHe was never tested despite making several requests, and he was not isolated.  (Id. \n¶¶ 30-31.)  While symptomatic, he was taken to await video court and placed in a \nwaiting area with about 20 other people, only 10 of whom had jail-issued masks.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 30-31.)  \n90.  Responding to a disease outbreak within a correctional facility is a \nmultidisciplinary effort.  It is imperative that jail medical staff make frequent \ncontact with the detainee population.  Jail administrators must verify that medical \nstaff are making regular rounds.  Detainees who reports symptoms of COVID-19 \nshould be evaluated immediately.  Officers should not direct symptomatic \ndetainees to submit a medical request to be seen several days or a week later.  That \nis an unacceptable response in a jail with a known incidence of infectious disease.       \n91.  The Jail should ensure that detained individuals receive medical \nevaluation and treatment at the first signs of COVID-19 symptoms.  If the Jail is \nnot able to provide such evaluation and treatment, a plan should be in place to \n39 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 41 of 65\n \nsafely transfer the individual to another facility or local hospital.  The initial \nmedical evaluation should determine whether a symptomatic individual is at higher \nrisk for severe illness from COVID-19.   \nK. Improper Quarantine/Isolation Practices  \n92.  The CDC quarantine guidelines state: \nFacilities should make every possible effort to individually quarantine cases \nof confirmed COVID-19, and close contacts of individuals with confirmed, \nor suspected COVID-19. Cohorting multiple quarantined close contacts \ncould transmit SARS-CoV-2 from those who are infected to those who are \nuninfected.  Cohorting should only be practiced if there are no other \navailable options.  If cohorting of close contacts under quarantine is \nabsolutely necessary, symptoms of all individuals should be monitored \nclosely, and individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 or who test positive \nfor SARS-Cov-2 should be placed under medical isolation immediately.  \n(CDC Interim Guidance, p. 19 (Mar. 23, 2020).) \n  \n93.  The CDC also recommends that if a person is an asymptomatic close \ncontact of someone with COVID-19, the person should be monitored for \nsymptoms at least once per day (and ideally twice per day) for fourteen days.  (Id. \nat 10.)  Additionally, the CDC counsels correctional administrators to “[e]nsure \nthat medical isolation for COVID-19 is distinct from punitive solitary confinement \nof incarcerated/detained individuals, both in name and in practice.”  (Id. at 15.)  \nThis is important because incarcerated people may be hesitant to report COVID-19 \nsymptoms if they are placed in the same housing unit used for disciplinary \nsegregation.  \n40 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 42 of 65\n \n94.  The quarantine procedure described by detainee C.C. is not in \naccordance with CDC guidelines.  (C.C. Decl. ¶¶ 4-10, 14.)  C.C. described being \nplaced on quarantine in “the hole” (a segregation or lockdown unit) because his \ncellmate had COVID-19 symptoms.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  He states that he was quarantined \nwith his symptomatic cellmate and another man, in a dirty segregation cell.  (Id.)  \nHe was locked down for 23 hours per day or more while in quarantine.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  \nC.C. became ill while in quarantine. (Id. ¶ 6.)     \n95.  The Jail’s failure to follow CDC quarantine guidelines can result in \nthe spread of COVID-19, endangering staff, detainees, and the general public.  \nK. Failure to Suspend Work Release and “Weekender” Program \n96.  To help stop the spread of COVID-19, jail administrators need to limit \nthe number of people coming into their facilities.  To that end, the CDC \nencourages jails to “[c]onsider suspending work release and other programs that \ninvolve movement of incarcerated/detained individuals in and out of the facility, \nespecially if the work release assignment is in another congregate setting . . . .”  \n(CDC Interim Guidance, at p. 8 (Mar. 22, 2020.)  The Clayton County Jail \ncontinues to operate its “weekender” jail program and work release program.  This \nprogram increases the risk that COVID-19 will be brought into the facility.  Its \nsuspension should be a top priority. \n41 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 43 of 65\n \nVI.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n97.  The outbreak at the Clayton County Jail is at a critical juncture, with \n72 detainees having tested positive for the virus as of July 10, 2020.  This is a \ndangerous situation and urgent action is required to protect detainees, staff, and the \ncommunity. \n98.  Many of the people who wrote declarations talked about what is like \nto be housed at the Clayton County Jail and to be fearful about catching the virus \nthere.  Some have recounted their experiences of becoming ill in the jail under \nunacceptable conditions of confinement.  In their grievances and declarations, \ndetainees express their fears of dying of COVID-19 inside the jail.  \n99.  For the reasons discussed above, I recommend that the Clayton \nCounty Jail should:   \na.  Provide comprehensive education to all detainees and staff with on-\ngoing updates on how to protect oneself from COVID-19 as well as \nthe status of infections within the jails; \nb.  Post educational COVID-19-related signs in compliance with CDC \nrecommendations; \nc.  Provide no cost access to sufficient quantities of hand soap and paper \ntowels, and provide additional soap to detainees immediately upon \nrequest; \nd.  Eliminate medical co-pays for the duration of the pandemic; \ne.  Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer in locations where dispensers \ncan be regularly viewed by staff; \n42 \nKL3 3305727.1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-4   Filed 07/27/20   Page 44 of 65\n \nf.  Provide for continual, around the clock cleaning of all commonly \nshared areas, especially the toilet areas in dormitory settings; \ng.  Provide CDC-approved cleaning supplies so that prisoners can clean \ntheir cells and personal dormitory areas; \nh.  Provide cloth face coverings for detainees and staff, and provide \ndirection on how to use cloth face coverings, how to keep them clean \nand how to get another when necessary; \ni.  Ensure a schedule for regular laundering of cloth masks; \nj.  Search for opportunities to expand bed space for prisoners; \nk.  Seek to eliminate dangerous crowding during medication and meal \ndistribution and at transport to video court; \nl.  Suspend work release and other programs that involve movement of \nincarcerated people in and out of the facility; \nm. Survey the facility for places where prisoners historically stand in line \nand expand those lines so that detainees are 6 feet apart; \nn.  Continue to make efforts to reduce the jail population. \n \n100.

Defendants shall create and file with the Court within seven days of \nthe date of this Order reasonably specific and detailed written plans—developed in \nconsultation with the Georgia Department of Public Health and/or a qualified \nmedical or public health expert in preventing and mitigating the spread of \ninfectious diseases—for addressing the following matters: \nA.  Educating detainees, staff members, contractors, and/or vendors \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-15   Filed 07/27/20   Page 2 of 10\nabout COVID-19, including symptoms, the importance of \nsocial distancing and frequent hand washing, the proper use of \npersonal protective equipment, and other appropriate measures \nto prevent or mitigate the spread of the virus that causes \nCOVID-19, with this education continuing on a regular  and  \nas-needed basis as more information becomes available about \nthe virus; \nB.

Detecting, monitoring, documenting, and quarantining or \nisolating suspected or known cases of COVID-19 among \ndetainees or staff members, including but not limited to taking \nreasonable steps to identify persons within the jail who have \nbeen in contact with a person who has tested positive for or \nexhibited symptoms of COVID-19; \nF.  Ensuring that detainees known or suspected to have COVID-19 \ndo not interact with detainees who are not known or suspected \nto have COVID-19; \nG.

Documenting and monitoring the performance of all COVID-19 \nprevention and mitigation measures in the jail; and \nU.  Educating detainees about COVID-19 quarantining and other \nprotective measures to take upon release to the community.  \n2.  For purposes of this Order, the phrase “reasonably specific and \ndetailed written plan” means a description of a course of conduct that would satisfy \nRule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if adopted by the Court as an \ninjunctive order. \n3.  Within three days of Defendants’ filing of the written plans discussed \nin paragraph 1 above, Plaintiffs shall file with the Court written responses to \nDefendants’ plans identifying any areas in which Defendants’ proposed response is \nalleged to be insufficient to prevent irreparable harm to detainees.  For any matter \non which Plaintiffs disagree with the Defendants’ proposed remedial plan, Plaintiff \nshall propose reasonably specific and detailed substitute measures.   \n4.  The Court will consider the parties’ submissions and will thereafter \nenter a renewed preliminary injunction that is narrowly drawn, extends no further \nthan necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and is \nthe least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.  See 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(2).  Within 30 days of the Court’s entry of the renewed preliminary \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-15   Filed 07/27/20   Page 7 of 10\ninjunction, and every 30 days thereafter, Defendants shall file with the Court and \nserve on Plaintiffs a status report identifying the jail’s detainee population, the \nnumber of active and recovered COVID-19 cases that have been identified in the \njail, and Defendants’ efforts to comply with each provision of the preliminary \ninjunction.  Within 7 days of each status report filed by Defendants, Plaintiffs may \nfile a response. \nII.   Measures to Aid the Court’s Consideration of Plaintiffs’ Claims for \nRelease and/or Enlargement  \n \n5.  The Court recognizes that it has the duty to ensure that each detainee \nis not facing an unreasonable risk of injury or death from COVID-19 and that, if \nnecessary, the court may order release and/or enlargement where appropriate.  The \nCourt is prepared to exercise that authority unless the Defendants devise a remedial \nplan within 14 days of this Order that will promptly ensure that each detainee no \nlonger faces an unreasonable risk of injury or death from COVID-19. \n6.  To aid the Court’s evaluation of whether release and/or enlargement is \nappropriate relief for Plaintiffs and class members’ constitutional and irreparable \ninjuries, Defendants shall provide to the Court and Plaintiffs’ counsel within two \ndays of the date of this Order records sufficient to show the following information, \nand shall provide updated versions of these documents to the Court and Plaintiffs’ \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-15   Filed 07/27/20   Page 8 of 10\ncounsel periodically, and no less than every seven days, for the duration of this \nOrder: \nA.  The names, reasons for detention, incarceration dates, housing \nassignments, dates of birth, and bond amounts (if applicable) \nfor all current Clayton County Jail detainees; \nB.  The names and relevant medical conditions of all detainees who \nare members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses, as \ndefined in paragraphs 189 and 194 of Plaintiffs’ complaint \n[Doc. 1].1 \nC.  The names of all Clayton County Jail detainees who are eligible \nfor earned-time credit, home confinement, and/or other forms of \ndiscretionary release from the jail under the Sheriff’s control; \nand \nD.  For individuals held on one or more bond orders, Defendants \nshall identify those individuals who would be eligible \nimmediately for release if they paid the applicable bond \namounts. \n \n1 This information shall be provided to the Court under seal and shall be subject to \na protective order to be entered by this Court, by separate order. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-15   Filed 07/27/20   Page 9 of 10\n7.  Defendants shall create and file with the Court within seven days of \nthe date of this Order a reasonably specific and detailed written plan by which \nDefendants or their designees will review each detainee eligible for discretionary \nrelease by the Sheriff and determine whether to grant discretionary release to each \neligible detainee.   \n8.  To further aid the Court’s evaluation of whether release and/or \nenlargement is appropriate relief for Plaintiffs and class members’ constitutional \nand irreparable injuries, Defendants shall create and file under seal with the Court \nwithin seven days of the date of this Order a list of all members of the Medically \nVulnerable Subclasses that Defendants deem unsuitable for release under any \ncircumstances.  The list must describe the asserted reason with reasonable \nspecificity and identify the evidentiary basis for the asserted reason. \n9.  The parties shall jointly create and file under seal with the Court \nwithin 14 days of the date of this Order a list identifying (a) all members of the \nMedically Vulnerable Subclasses that the parties agree are suitable for release by \nthis Court; and (b) all members of the Medically Vulnerable Subclasses for whom \nthe parties cannot reach an agreement as to the suitability of release, along with a \nconcise statement explaining the bases of the parties’ disagreement. \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 19-15   Filed 07/27/20   Page 10 of 10\n10.  Following receipt of the parties’ submissions pursuant to paragraphs 6 \nthrough 9, the Court will issue further orders setting forth a process to determine \nwhether the Court must release certain class members under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243; or under the Americans with Disabilities Act and \nRehabilitation Act, in order to ensure those persons are not in unreasonable risk of \ninfection from COVID-19.   \n11.  In accordance with 18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(2), the Court finds that the \nrelief set forth above is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to \ncorrect the harm the Court finds requires preliminary relief, and is the least \nintrusive means necessary to correct that harm. \nSO ORDERED, this _____ day of ____________________, 2020. \n \n \n                         \n            Eleanor L.

ARGUMENT AND CITATION TO AUTHORITY \nA.  Plaintiffs Do Not Have Standing to Bring This Lawsuit \n1.  Plaintiffs Only Allege a Speculative Injury  \nDefendants established in their initial brief that Plaintiffs’ prospect of future \ninjury, which can be boiled down to a fear of contracting COVID-19, is only \nspeculative which is insufficient for standing.  Gagliardi v. TJCV Land Tr., 889 F.3d \n728, 734 (11th Cir. 2018) (“an injunction cannot be fashioned when the prospect of \nfuture injury is only speculative; again, there must be a ‘likelihood of substantial and \nimmediate irreparable injury.’”).  \nPlaintiffs respond that the risk of future injury is not speculative because \nCOVID-19 is highly contagious, has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, \njails generally are considered high-risk, and numerous jails have had outbreaks.  \n- 1 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 2 of 28\n(Doc. 37, pp. 9-10.)  But these are precisely the types of vague allegations and \nassertions that are insufficient to establish standing.  Plaintiffs only speculate they \nwill  be  exposed  to  COVID-19,  speculate  they  may  contract  COVID-19,  and \nspeculate they would suffer injury thereby. Plaintiffs merely posit the same general \nfears shared by those outside the Jail and the world.   \nPlaintiffs also respond that the Jail has inmates that are infected with COVID-\n19 and lean on this allegation as an attempt to prove a non-speculative prospect of \nfuture injury; however, this contention fails too because it does not in and of itself \nestablish  a  “realistic  danger”  of  future  injury  beyond  an  assertion  that  is \n“hypothetical or conjectural.”  Fla. State Conference of the NAACP v. Browning, \n522 F.3d 1153, 1159 (11th Cir. 2008).  In fact, the Jail has had a very low infection \nrate (Doc. 31-1, p. 8), and to this date, Plaintiffs have not contracted COVID-19. \nPlaintiffs’ complaint, moreover, is devoid of any allegations regarding what level of \nexposure leads to contracting COVID-19, and is further devoid of any specific or \nscientific data, including any data on how long an individual must be exposed to \nCOVID-19 and to what viral load, before contracting the virus.1 The failure to plead \nsuch facts leaves Plaintiffs’ complaint riddled with general fears of what could occur \nanywhere, which is fatal to Plaintiffs proving they have standing.  See Wooden v. \n \n1 For purposes of a simple analogy, exposure to the sun does not mean one will \nreceive a sunburn, and simply stating same does not prove an injury-in-fact.   \n \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 3 of 28\nBd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys., 247 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001).  Therefore, \nbecause the likelihood of future injury at the Jail is mere guesswork, and the risk of \ncontracting COVID-19 may be greater outside the Jail, Plaintiffs lack standing to \nseek injunctive relief from the Court.  Gagliardi, 889 F.3d at 734. \n2.  Failure to Establish Redressability \n In their initial brief, Defendants established that Plaintiffs cannot establish \nredressability  because  they  failed  to  name  the  medical  provider  at  the  Jail, \nCorrectHealth, LLC (“CorrectHealth”), as a party.  Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit \nrecently explained, “[t]o satisfy the causation requirement of standing, a plaintiff’s \ninjury must be ‘fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the \nresult of the independent action of some third party not before the court.’”  Jacobson \nv. Fla. Sec’y, 957 F.3d 1193, 1207 (11th Cir. 2020).  \nIn response, Plaintiffs contend that naming CorrectHealth is not necessary for \nstanding because Defendants “are responsible for operating the Jail and providing \nfor Detainees’ needs.”  (Doc. 37, p. 14.)  There are no allegations in the complaint, \nhowever, to show that the Sheriff has control over any of the medically-related \ndecisions by CorrectHealth and its staff, and the Sheriff is not a medical professional.  \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that CorrectHealth is the entity that actually provides for the \nthe medical care and treatment of detainees and inmates at the Jail.  Based on this \nresponsibility, medical providers can be subject to liability under Section 1983.  The \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 4 of 28\nEleventh Circuit has “held that the employees of a private entity hired by a county \nto provide medical care to jail inmates . . . [are] subject to liability under § 1983.” \nOrt v. Pinchback, 786 F.2d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir. 1986).  Because CorrectHealth is \nheld responsible for its own actions, it is a required party to this action for purpose \nof redressability.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs contend that if CorrectHealth is a necessary party, the Court \nshould join it as a party rather than dismiss for lack of standing.  (Doc. 37, p. 15.)  \nHowever, Plaintiffs ignore the fact that the Court would be without jurisdiction to \njoin nonparties. Jacobson, 957 F.3d at 1209 (“If a plaintiff sues the wrong defendant, \nan order enjoining the correct official who has not been joined as a defendant cannot \nsuddenly make the plaintiff’s injury redressable.”).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ complaint \nshould be dismissed because they have not adequately named a required party and \nhave failed to allege facts sufficient to support standing. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Redundant Official Capacity Claims Are Subject to Dismissal \n  Defendants established in their initial brief that it is redundant to sue any of \nthe Sheriff’s employees in their official capacities because the Sheriff is a party to \nthis suit.  In response, Plaintiffs contend that naming the Sheriff’s employees in their \nofficial capacities is proper because they are seeking injunctive relief.  (Doc. 37, pp. \n16-17.)  However, Plaintiffs  have brought claims  under Section 1983, and the \nEleventh Circuit has made clear that  “when an officer is sued under Section 1983 \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 5 of 28\nin his or her official capacity, the suit is simply another way of pleading an action \nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.” Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d \n764, 776 (11th Cir. 1991).  Moreover, none of the cases cited by Plaintiffs involve a \nsheriff’s management of the conditions of a jail, and Plaintiffs even acknowledge \nthat it is the Sheriff’s responsibility to “operate the Clayton County Jail system…and \nto ensure safe and sanitary conditions of conferment.” (Doc. 37, p. 23.) Therefore, \nthe official capacity claims against the Sheriff’s staff are redundant and unnecessary.  \nPurcell v. Toombs Cnty., 400 F.3d 1313, 1325 (11th Cir. 2005). \nC.  Plaintiffs  Fail  to  Prove  They  Satisfied  the  PLRA’s  Requirement  to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies Before Filing Suit \n \nAs  established in Defendants’ initial brief, Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the \nPLRA’s  requirement  that  they  exhausted  all  available  administrative  remedies \nbefore filing a lawsuit regarding the Jail’s conditions, which warrants dismissal. This \nresult should not shock Plaintiffs’ counsel, as the ACLU’s own PLRA practice guide \nwarns “[i]f you file a lawsuit in federal court before taking your complaints through \nevery  step  of  your  prison’s  grievance  procedure,  it  will  almost  certainly  be \ndismissed.” American Civil Liberties Union, KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: THE PRISON \nLITIGATION  REFORM  ACT  (PLRA),  available  at \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/images/asset_upload_file79_25805.pdf \n(last visited Aug. 25, 2020). \n \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 6 of 28\n1.  Challenge to the Availability of the Grievance Procedure Fails \n \nIn their response, Plaintiffs state that the Grievance Procedure was somehow \nunavailable to them and that a detainee need not exhaust unavailable remedies.  \n(Doc. 37, pp. 19-20.) While “[a]n administrative procedure that is unknown and \nunknowable is unavailable,” Presley v. Scott, 679 F. App’x 910, 912 (11th Cir. \n2017), the Grievance Procedure at the Jail is neither of these things.  Plaintiffs assert \nthat Defendants have not shown that Plaintiffs “were informed of the grievance \npolicy or its rules so that it would be ‘practically’ capable of use.” (Doc. 37, p. 19.) \nYet, Defendants have submitted declarations from a lieutenant and an inmate at the \nJail  to  show  that  inmates  are  educated  about  the  Grievance  Procedure  during \norientation and that grievances are available via the Kiosk. (Gibson Declaration; \nDemarco May Declaration.)  These facts are not conclusory, as Plaintiffs contend, \nbut instead are conclusive in establishing that inmates are informed and well aware \nabout  the  Grievance  Procedure.2    Additionally,  Plaintiffs’  complaint,  and  the \nevidence submitted by Defendants, establish that Plaintiffs are aware of the Kiosk \ngrievance process because they utilized it. (Doc. 1, pp. 22, 24, 48–51.) Plaintiffs’ \nKiosk entries undercut any contention that the process was unknown or unavailable \n \n2 While the factual statement is brief, it is not a conclusory statement, as a conclusory \nstatement would be simply stating inmates know of the Grievance Procedure. See \nRogers v. Evans, 792 F.2d 1052, 1062 n.9 (11th Cir. 1986) (“The affidavit is phrased \nin conclusory terms without citing facts.”). \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 7 of 28\nto them.  Plaintiffs were informed of the Grievance Procedure, it was capable of use, \nand it was used thereby showing Plaintiffs understand how to grieve according to \nthe Grievance Procedure.  Presley, 679 F. App’x at 912. \nNext, Plaintiffs contend that the Grievance Procedure describes a paper-based \nprotocol not used at the Jail.  (Doc. 37, pp. 20-21.) While the written Grievance \nProcedure technically does not refer to the Kiosk, this is immaterial because the \nprocess is the same.  The Grievance Procedure, moreover, adequately explains \nsubmitting  grievances  and  appeals  therefrom,  and  inmates  are  educated  at \norientation  how  to  use  the  Kiosk,  which  Plaintiffs  had  no  trouble  doing  here.  \n(Gibson Decl.; May Decl.)  The Grievance Procedure is understood and available \nunder the PLRA. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ contention is unpersuasive.   \n2.  No Class Certification \nIn their response, Plaintiffs continually refer to “class members” and “class \nrepresentatives”  in their  discussion  of  the  PLRA’s  exhaustion  requirement  and \ncontend that they have satisfied “vicarious exhaustion.”  (Doc. 37, p. 21.)  Vicarious \nexhaustion is only available when a class has been certified, but because no class has \nbeen certified, the Court is to  only look to the grievances filed by the named \nPlaintiffs. See Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 2004) (“We hold \nthat a class of prisoner-plaintiffs certified under Rule 23(b)(2) satisfies the PLRA’s \nadministrative exhaustion requirement through  ‘vicarious exhaustion,’ i.e., when \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 8 of 28\none or more class members has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect \nto each claim raised by the class.”). This matter has not been certified as a class \naction, and no class members or class representatives exist. Baxter v. Palmigiano, \n425 U.S. 308, 310 n.1 (1976) (“Without such certification and identification of the \nclass, the action is not properly a class action.”).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ contention \nlacks merit. \n3.  Challenge to the Exhaustion of the Grievance Procedure Fails \nFinally, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have not met their burden to show \nthat the named plaintiffs failed to exhaust the Grievance Procedure.  (Doc. 37, pp. \n22-26.)  Regarding Plaintiff Jones’ appeal with Entry ID 248051, Plaintiffs claim \nthat the appeal response of “Resolved Substantiated” “indicated that the grievance \nwas addressed on the merits  on appeal”  and because of this  the “procedurally \ndefective grievance properly exhausts a prisoner’s claim for purpose of § 1997e(a). \n(Doc. 37, p. 32.) Plaintiffs conflate the words “grievance” and “appeal” and refer to \nJones’ appeal as a “grievance” when it is only an appeal. Because inmates may \n“only address one area of concern per Grievance Form” the only topic that could \nhave been addressed in Plaintiff Jones’ appeal would have been the topic she first \ngrieved about in her grievance, an issue with texting, and not any new issues raised  \nin her appeal. (Doc. 23-2, p. 4, 8.). Therefore, the response to her appeal only dealt \nwith  the  one  issued  on  appeal—the  texting  issue—and  this  issue  is  what  was \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 9 of 28\n“Resolved Substantiated,” as the texting issue was first “Resolved Unsubstantiated”. \nPlaintiff  Jones  then  appealed,  and  on  appeal,  the  texting  issue  was  “Resolved \nSubstantiated.” The new topics found in the appeal could not have been “Resolved \nSubstantiated,” as they were outside the topic on appeal, and the purpose of an appeal \nis to appeal the original grievance and its topics. Any new topics found in the appeal \nwould not have been resolved on the merits, and therefore, Plaintiff Jones has not \nexhausted the grievance procedure in relation to her allegations in the complaint. \nAs for Plaintiff Singleton’s grievance with Entry ID 243732, Plaintiffs claim \nthat it “was undecided nearly two months after Singleton filed it” is incorrect, as the \ngrievance has been replied to with the language “All issues have been addressed.” \n(Doc. 37, p. 32; Doc. 23-2, p. 18.) Plaintiffs admit this language is found in the reply, \nbut state that the language “meant that Singleton had obtained all the relief that was \navailable  and  thus  was  not  required to  file  an  appeal.”  (Doc. 37, p. 32.) This \nstatement is incorrect, because if Plaintiff Singleton did not agree that “[a]ll issues \nhave been addressed” then he would have needed to file an appeal, the choice to not \nappeal  means  Plaintiff  Singleton  failed  to  exhaust  the  available  administrative \nremedies.  \nRegarding Plaintiff Mitchell, Plaintiffs contend “Defendants have not shown \nthat Mitchell was informed of how to file a grievance appeal.” However, all inmates \nare told about the grievance procedure at orientation, and Defendants have produced \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 10 of 28\nLieutenant Gibson’s declaration containing this specific fact. (Doc. 23-2, pp. 1–3.) \nFurther, Plaintiff Mitchell has filed grievances—but failed to exhaust the grievance \nprocedure—thereby showing that the grievance procedure was known, available, \nand in fact used by Plaintiff Mitchell. (Doc. 23-2, pp. 12–14.) Most importantly, \nPlaintiff Mitchell is no longer incarcerated at the Jail, as Plaintiffs concede, which \n“moot[s] his claims” and his claims are no longer at issue. (Doc. 37, p. 11 n. 1.)  \nSmith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir. 2007) (“[t]he general rule in our \ncircuit is that a transfer or release of a prisoner from prison will moot that prisoner’s \nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief.”).3 \nRegarding Plaintiff Watkins, after reviewing the Jail’s files for any grievances \nsubmitted by Plaintiffs, Lieutenant Gibson attached the grievances found through \nthis procedure to his declaration. (Doc. 23-2, ¶ 4.) Plaintiffs seem to take issue with \nthe wording in Lieutenant Gibson’s declaration where it states “the grievances I have \nlocated,” but this issue is immaterial, as the grievance Lieutenant Gibson has located, \nthrough  his  thorough  review  of  the  Clayton  County  Jail  files,  would  be  “any \ngrievances submitted by” the Plaintiffs. (Doc. 23-2, ¶ 4; Doc 37, p. 25.) And any of \nthe grievances submitted by the Plaintiffs, including any by Plaintiff Watkins, have \n \n3 See also Zatler v. Wainwright, 802 F.2d 397 (11th Cir. 1986) (“[i]n view of Zatler’s \nrelease, we find that his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are now moot.”); \nWahl v. McIver, 773 F.2d 1169, 1173 (11th Cir. 1985)(“[a]bsent class certification, \nan inmate’s claim for injunctive and declaratory relief in a section 1983 action fails \nto present a case or controversy once the inmate has been transferred.”). \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 11 of 28\nbeen attached to his declaration, with no more or no less. Therefore, an absence of \ngrievances by Plaintiff Watkins means Plaintiff Watkins did not file any grievances \nduring the time of Plaintiff Watkins’ incarceration.  \nEven  if  this  Court  were  to  find  Plaintiffs  have  satisfied  the  exhaustion \nrequirement,  Plaintiffs  have  only  grieved  about  sanitization  of  phones,  masks, \ncleaning supplies, disinfectant, and COVID-19 tests. (Doc 23-2, p. 7–26.) Meaning, \nthe Court should limit Plaintiffs’ claims only to these specific items of concern \nbrought to the Jail staff’s attention. Sylvester v. Chandler, No. 07 C 50050, 2010 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 88683, at *13 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 27, 2010) (“Because the June \ngrievance failed to identify misconduct or describe those who treated him badly, it \ndid not provide the prison with any opportunity to address plaintiff’s concern that he \nwas being abused by Dixon nurses. Accordingly, the court finds that plaintiff did not \nexhaust  his  remedies  with  respect  to  the  claims”);  see  generally  Winstead  v. \nWilliams, No. CV 617-049, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3843, at *10 (S.D. Ga. Jan. 9, \n2018). \nD.  Failure to State a Claim Under The ADA or RA \n \nPlaintiffs contend in two pages of their response that they have plausibly \nalleged  violations  under  the  ADA  and  RA  and  that  “the  Jail  has  made  no \naccommodations for members of the Disability subclasses to reduce their risk of \nexposure” to COVID-19.  (Doc. 37, pp. 26-27.)  Foremost, Plaintiffs have not \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 12 of 28\nalleged a disability under the ADA or RA.4 Plaintiffs allege only health conditions—\nhigh  blood  pressure,  diabetes,  and  pulmonary  disease—but  alleging  health \nconditions is not tantamount to being disabled.  (Doc. 1, ¶¶ 4–7.) “A physical \nimpairment, standing alone, however, is not necessarily a disability as contemplated \nby the ADA. The ADA requires that the impairment substantially limit one or more \nof the individual’s major life activities.” Gordon v. E.L. Hamm & Assocs., 100 F.3d \n907, 911 (11th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted); see 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Plaintiffs \nmust allege how their health conditions have “substantially limit[ed] one or more of \nthe major life activities of [Plaintiffs]” to bring a claim under the ADA, and Plaintiffs \nhave failed to do so here. 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2). Simply put, merely having a health \ncondition does not mean one is disabled as defined by the ADA, and the failure to \nproperly allege Plaintiffs have disabilities is fatal to bringing an ADA claim. See \nGreenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 498 F.3d 1258, 1265 (11th Cir. 2007) \n(holding  plaintiff  who  suffered  from  diabetes,  high  blood  pressure,  and  other \nconditions  could  not  establish  he  was  disabled  pursuant  to  ADA);  Swain  v. \nHillsborough Cty. Sch. Bd., 146 F.3d 855, 858 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding plaintiff \nwho  suffered  from  urinary  incontinence  and  high  blood  pressure  was  “not  an \nindividual with a disability as defined by the ADA.”). \n \n4 “Discrimination claims under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same \nstandards used in ADA cases.” Cash v. Smith, 231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000).\n \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 13 of 28\nNext,  as  for  Plaintiffs  contention  that  they  were  not  provided \naccommodations, Plaintiffs do not contend that they made a specific demand for \nreasonable accommodations, which is fatal to their claim.  Rylee v. Chapman, 316 \nF. App’x 901, 906 (11th Cir. 2009) (“In cases alleging a failure to make reasonable \naccommodations, the defendant’s duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is \nnot triggered until the plaintiff makes a ‘specific demand’ for an accommodation.”). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with \nany  reasonable  accommodations  by  reason  of  any  disabilities.5  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims should be dismissed for these additional reasons. \nE.  “Unconstitutional Punishment” Claim is Subject to Dismissal  \n \nPlaintiffs contend in their response that the “punishment test” in Bell v. \nWolfish,  441  U.S.  520,  535  (1979)  and  not  the  Eighth  Amendment  deliberate \nindifference analysis “applies when analyzing the condition of Plaintiffs’ pretrial \nconfinement.”  (Doc. 37, pp. 28-29.)  Plaintiffs are wrong and are misconstruing the \nstandards under well-established Eleventh Circuit precedent. In Bell, the Supreme \nCourt held that conditions claims brought by pretrial detainees arise under the \n \n5 Plaintiffs claim that the ADA and RA do not require discrimination by a public \nentity of an individual with a disability by reason of their disability. (Doc. 37, p. 27.) \nThis is incorrect. The Eleventh Circuit recognizes a claim under the ADA and RA \nwhen a plaintiff “was ‘subjected to discrimination’ by a public entity, the [sheriff], \nby reason of his disability.” Bircoll v. Miami-Dade Cty., 480 F.3d 1072, 1084 (11th \nCir. 2007) (emphasis added).  \n \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 14 of 28\nFourteenth Amendment.  The Eleventh Circuit, however, has held that the decisional \nlaw applicable to prison inmates applies equally to pretrial detainees.  Hamm v. \nDeKalb Cty., 774 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir. 1985); see also Cottrell v. Caldwell, \n85 F.3d 1480, 1490 (11th Cir. 1996).  As a result, the Eleventh Circuit requires a \nplaintiff challenging the conditions of confinement to show both that the deprivation \nsuffered  was  objectively  serious  and  that  prison  officials  were  deliberately \nindifferent to the violation of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights. See Evans v. St. \nLucie Cty. Jail, 448 F. App’x 971, 973–75 (11th Cir. 2011). See also Swain v. Junior, \n958 F.3d 1081 (11th Cir. 2020) (“a pre-trial detainee’s rights exist under the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment’ but ‘are subject to the same scrutiny \nas if they had been brought as deliberate indifference claims under the Eighth \nAmendment.”).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claim in Count I should be dismissed for \nfailure to state a claim.  \nF.  Failure to State a Claim for Habeas Relief Because Claims Relate to \nConditions at the Jail and They Failed to Exhaust State Court Remedies  \n \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Challenging Conditions of Confinement, Not the Fact \nor Duration of the Confinement \n \nPlaintiffs contend in their response that “Defendants have incorrectly framed \nPlaintiffs’ [habeas] claims as challenges to the conditions of confinement.” (Doc. \n37, p. 30.)  Plaintiffs’ complaint, however, poses the situation that COVID-19, and \nDefendants’ alleged deliberate indifference to the virus, has created conditions of \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 15 of 28\nconfinement at the Jail that are in violation of the Constitution. (See, e.g., Doc. 1, ⁋ \n110, 111, 152, 154, 156, 178, 209, 213, 214, 236.) Plaintiffs’ claims challenge \nwithout any question the alleged conditions at the Jail in response to COVID-19, and \nPlaintiffs cite no law to support their request for a release or transfer order due to \nCOVID-19 related conditions.  To the contrary, binding precedent holds that an \ninmate cannot challenge his or her conditions of confinement via a habeas petition, \nperiod. Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004) (“[C]onstitutional claims that \nmerely challenge the conditions of a prisoner’s confinement, whether the inmate \nseeks monetary or injunctive relief, fall outside of that core” of habeas relief.); see \nalso Muhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004) (“Challenges to the validity of \nany confinement or to particulars affecting its duration are the province of habeas \ncorpus, requests for relief turning on circumstances of confinement may be presented \nin  a  §  1983  action.”);  Vaz  v.  Skinner,  634  F.  App’x  778  (11th  Cir.  2015) \n(“Petitioner’s § 2241 petition is not the appropriate vehicle for raising an inadequate \nmedical care claim, as such a claim challenges the conditions of confinement, not \nthe fact or duration of that confinement.”). \nSimply, Plaintiffs are not alleging challenges to “the validity of the sentence \nitself or the fact of confinement,” which would give them a basis for a habeas corpus \npetition under Bryant v. Warden, 738 F.3d 1253, 1288 (11th Cir. 2013).  This is a \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 16 of 28\nconditions of confinement suit, and as such, Plaintiffs are not entitled to habeas \nrelief.   \n2.  Plaintiffs’ Habeas Claims Must Be Dismissed Because Plaintiffs \nHave Not Exhausted Available State Court Remedies   \n \nIn their response, Plaintiffs cite Santiago-Lugo v. Warden, 785 F.3d 467 (11th \nCir. 2015) and contend that exhaustion of state court remedies is not a requirement \nto bring a habeas claim. (Doc. 37, pp. 31–32.)  However, Santiago, is inapposite \nbecause that case does not deal with the failure to exhaust state court remedies, but \nrather, with the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  \nPlaintiffs also claim there is an “absence of a statutorily mandated exhaustion \nrequirement;” however, this is also incorrect. (Doc. 37, p. 32.) See 28 U.S.C. § \n2254(b)(1) (“An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in \ncustody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it \nappears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the \nState.”); see also Hughes v. AG of Fla., 377 F.3d 1258, 1262 n.4 (11th Cir. 2004) \n(“the exhaustion of state remedies . . . was codified in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b), but the \nrequirement applies to all habeas corpus actions.”). \nPlaintiffs next contend that “[t]he circumstances of this case weigh heavily \nagainst an exhaustion requirement” and that they should have “prompt access to a \nfederal judicial forum.”  (Doc. 37, pp. 32-33.) The Supreme Court, however, has \n“reiterated that comity was the basis for the exhaustion doctrine: ‘it is a principle \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 17 of 28\ncontrolling all habeas corpus petitions to the federal courts, that those courts will \ninterfere with the administration of justice in the state courts only in rare cases where \nexceptional circumstances of peculiar urgency are shown to exist.’” Rose v. Lundy, \n455 U.S. 509, 515-16 (1982).  \nComity is at its greatest here, as “the Supreme Court has cautioned, ‘it is \ndifficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is \nmore intricately bound up with state laws, regulations, and procedures, than the \nadministration of its prisons.’” Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 94 (2006) (citing \nPreiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491–492 (1973)). As the interest of comity is \ngreat, and there is not an exceptional circumstance of peculiar urgency here, as \nPlaintiffs’ own allegations show that there has not been an outbreak of COVID-19 \nat the Jail and Plaintiffs have not alleged they are safer from COVID-19 outside of \nthe Jail, the exhaustion requirement should be enforced and a state court should have \nthe ability to hear a habeas claim. See Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011) \n(“Courts must be sensitive to the State’s interest in punishment, deterrence, and \nrehabilitation, as well as the need for deference to experienced and expert prison \nadministrators faced with the difficult and dangerous task of housing large numbers \nof convicted criminals.”); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1311 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(“jailers and corrections officials should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the \nadoption and execution of policies and practices.”). \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 18 of 28\nFurther, the Supreme Court’s opinion in Jacobson v. Massachusetts cautions \ndistrict courts from usurping state authority to craft measures responsive to a public \nhealth emergency. 197 U.S. 11, 39 (1905). Instead, the courts should only interfere \nwhen states act in an “arbitrary and oppressive” manner. Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 38; \nsee generally Robinson v. AG, 957 F.3d 1171, 1179 (11th Cir. 2020); Adams & \nBoyle, P.C. v. Slatery, 956 F.3d 913, 925 (6th Cir. 2020); In re Abbott, 956 F.3d \n696, 716 (5th Cir. 2020). \nFinally, in Money v. Pritzker, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63599 (N.D. Ill. Apr. \n10, 2020), for example, the court found that there were “serious separation of powers \nconcerns” inherent in plaintiffs’ actions “because running and overseeing prisons is \ntraditionally the province of the executive and legislative branches.”  Id. at *54. The \ncourt explained that the judiciary is “ill-equipped” to manage thousands of inmates, \nparticularly in the context of “an ongoing, fast moving public health emergency.”  \nId. at *55.  Finally, turning to the merits of the habeas petition, the court found that \nthe plaintiffs failed to exhaust their remedies as they did not give Illinois state courts \na meaningful opportunity to consider their claims before turning to the federal courts \nfor relief. Id. at *68–75.  Ultimately, the court denied their habeas petition because \n“Plaintiffs have not made a satisfactory showing that the state court system was not \nevery bit as available as the federal courts, if not more so.” Id. at *74.  Therefore, as \nin Money, Plaintiffs’ request for habeas relief should be denied. \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 19 of 28\nG.  Plaintiffs Failed to Follow the PLRA’s Required Procedure to Obtain an \nInmate Release Order \n \nPlaintiffs contend in their response that the requirements and limitations on \nprisoner release orders under 18 U.S.C. § 3636 do not apply to them, including the \nrequirement to empanel a three-judge panel.  (Doc. 37, pp. 34-35.)  Yet, Plaintiffs \ncite no precedent to support their contention.  Looking to the plain language of 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626, a prisoner release order “includes any order, including a temporary \nrestraining order or preliminary injunctive relief, that has the purpose or effect of \nreducing or limiting the prison population, or that directs the release from or \nnonadmission of prisoners to a prison.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(4) (emphasis added). \nIn the face of this plain language, Plaintiffs incorrectly state “an order releasing or \ntransferring medically vulnerable detainees to protect them form COVID-19 would \nnot constitute a ‘prisoner release order” . . . .” (Doc. 37, p. 35.) Further, Plaintiffs \nclaim in their complaint “[r]elease is needed . . . to reduce the jail’s population”—\nlanguage almost word-for-word the definition of a “prison release order.” (Doc. 1, \np. 67) \nPlaintiffs are seeking release as a remedy for the allegedly unconstitutional \nconditions at the Jail—either for themselves or others—but the PLRA prevents this \nCourt from granting that relief. Under the PLRA, “[t]he authority to order release of \nprisoners as a remedy to cure a systemic violation of the Eighth Amendment is a \npower reserved to a three-judge district court, not a single-judge district court.” \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 20 of 28\nBrown, 563 U.S. at 500 (2011) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)); see 18 U.S.C. § \n3626(a)(3)(B) (“In any civil action in Federal court with respect to prison conditions, \na  prisoner  release  order  shall  be  entered  only  by  a  three-judge  court[.]”). \nAdditionally, such an order may not be entered unless “(i) a court has previously \nentered an order for less intrusive relief that has failed to remedy the deprivation of \nthe Federal right sought to be remedied through the prisoner release order; and (ii) \nthe defendant has had a reasonable amount of time to comply with the previous court \norders.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(A). And even a three-judge court may not order \nprisoners released to remedy unconstitutional prison conditions until “the court finds \nby clear and convincing evidence” that “(i) crowding is the primary cause of the \nviolation” and “(ii) no other relief will remedy [it.]” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(3)(E)(i)(ii). \nThree recent federal COVID-19 inmate cases confirm Defendants’ position \non several points and highlight the fatal flaws in Plaintiffs’ compliant.   \nThe Illinois district court’s decision in Money is the most significant of the \ncases, as it analyzed an action practically identical to this one. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n63599 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2020).  In Money, ten individuals in various Illinois \nDepartment of Corrections (“IDOC”) facilities brought two class action lawsuits \n“seeking  release  of  prisoners  from  IDOC  facilities  in  light  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic.” Id. at *7.  One suit was brought under § 1983; the other was a petition \nfor writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.  As the court summarized: “The \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 21 of 28\nfoundation of each suit is essentially the same: Plaintiffs argue that the prison setting \nmakes them (and other purported class members) especially vulnerable to COVID-\n19, that the state government’s responses to the danger are insufficient or not fast \nenough or both, and that the only way to solve the problem is moving prisoners out \nof prisons.” Id. at *8. Plaintiffs claimed that “reducing the prison population is the \nonly  meaningful  way  to prevent the  harms posed  by  COVID-19 in the prison \nsetting.”  Id. at *16. \nThe court found that the plaintiffs’ § 1983 claims were subject to the PLRA’s \nlimitations. Id. at *32–47. The court analyzed whether the plaintiffs were seeking a \n“prisoner release order” that would need to be decided by a three-judge panel under \nthe PLRA.  Id.  During the lawsuit, the plaintiffs walked-back their original request \nfor release and claimed they were now only seeking “a process through which \nsubclass members eligible for medical furlough will be identified and evaluated \nbased on a balancing of public safety and public health needs, and transferred \naccordingly.” Id. at *28–29 (quotations omitted). The court found that even this \nwatered-down request was effectively a request for a prisoner release order as it was \nintended to further the lawsuits’ main purpose—which was to reduce or limit the \nIDOC’s prison population. Id. at *42, 43. The court held that, under the PLRA’s \nspecific procedures regarding prisoner release orders and due to the relief being \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 22 of 28\nrequested, it could not grant the plaintiffs’ § 1983-based request for prisoner release. \nId. at *75. \nFurther,  the  court  found  that  there  were  “serious  separation  of  powers \nconcerns” inherent in plaintiffs’ actions “because running and overseeing prisons is \ntraditionally the province of the executive and legislative branches.”  Id. at *54. The \ncourt explained that the judiciary is “ill-equipped” to manage thousands of inmates, \nparticularly in the context of “an ongoing, fast moving public health emergency.”  \nId. at *55. \nFinally, turning to the merits of the habeas petition, the court found that the \nplaintiffs failed to exhaust their remedies as they did not give Illinois state courts a \nmeaningful opportunity to consider their claims before turning to the federal courts \nfor relief. Id. at *68–75.  Ultimately, the court denied their habeas petition because \n“Plaintiffs have not made a satisfactory showing that the state court system was not \nevery bit as available as the federal courts, if not more so.” Id. at *74. \nIn the second case, Sacal-Micha v. Longoria, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62471 \n(S.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2020), the District Court for the Southern District of Texas found \nthat a writ of habeas corpus was not a proper vehicle for challenging an inmate’s \nconditions of confinement due to COVID-19. In Sacal-Micha, the petitioner who \nfiled a habeas petition seeking immediate release was “elderly and has serious \nunderlying medical conditions.”  Id. at *1. The petitioner sought release due to the \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 23 of 28\n“possibility  of  a  COVID-19  outbreak within the detention  center  .  .  .  and  the \nRespondents’ alleged inability to protect him from contracting the virus or providing \nhim with adequate medical attention.” Id. Specifically, the petitioner claimed that \nthe respondents had not implemented sufficient social distancing measures, the \nuniversal use of mask and gloves, and various other measures to protect against the \nspread of COVID-19. Id. at *5. \nThe court noted that the “‘sole function’ of a habeas petition is to ‘grant relief \nfrom  unlawful  imprisonment  or  custody’”  and  that  “[d]istrict  courts  have  .  .  . \nden[ied] habeas relief based solely on alleged inadequate conditions of detention.”  \nId. at * 7. The court found the petitioner’s lawsuit was “[a]t its core” challenging his \nconditions of confinement and that habeas relief is unavailable in such a suit. Id. at \n*8. Thus, the court held that the petition should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6).  Id. at *24. \nIn a third case, Coleman v. Newsom, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62575 (E.D. Cal. \nApr. 4, 2020), a three-judge federal court in California clarified how the PLRA’s \nlimits applied to COVID-19-based claims for a prisoner release order. The presiding \nthree-judge court was established in 2007 under the PLRA to consider whether a \nprisoner  release  was  warranted  due  to  structural  failures  in  California’s  prison \nsystem.  Id. at *5.  Recently, two classes of inmates incarcerated in California state \nprisons filed a motion asking the court to order the release of a significant number \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-JPB-CCB   Document 40   Filed 08/31/20   Page 24 of 28\nof prisoners “so that the prison population can be reduced to a level sufficient to \nallow physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”  Id. \nThe three-judge court rejected the plaintiffs’ motion. Id. at *6. The court noted \nthat the “PLRA places significant restrictions on a federal court’s authority to order \nthe release of prisoners as a remedy for a constitutional violation.”  Id. at *13.  The \ncourt found that the plaintiffs likely could not satisfy the PLRA’s requirements “at \nthis point because there have not yet been any orders requiring Defendants to take \nmeasures short of release to address the threat of the virus; nor have Defendants had \na reasonable time in which to comply.”  Id. at *14. \nThese three cases confirm Defendants’ position and highlight the reasons why \nthe relief sought by Plaintiffs should be denied. \nII.  CONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  herein,  and  in  Defendants’  initial  brief,  Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint should be dismissed.  \nFREEMAN MATHIS & GARY, LLP \n \n/s/ A.

Compl. at\n109 [Doc. 1]. This matter is now before the Court on that request.\nFor a party to obtain a preliminary injunction, the undersigned's Instructions\nrequire the following procedure:\nAny request for a temporary restraining order or for\npreliminary injunctive relief must be made by a separate\nmotion and conform to FED. R. Crv. P. 65. See LR 7.1A(1),\nNDGa. A request for a temporary restraining order or\npreliminary injunction found only in the complaint will not be\n\nCase 1:20-cv-02791-ELR-CCB   Document 8   Filed 07/09/20   Page 2 of 2\nconsidered at the time the complaint is filed and the request\nwill be considered when the merits of the case are addressed.\nAfter filing a motion for a temporary restraining order or a\npreliminary injunction, the movant must contact [the\nundersigned's courtroom deputy clerk] to request expedited\nconsideration of the motion; otherwise, the motion will be\ntreated as a non-emergency matter.\nInstructions for Civil Cases Assigned to the Honorable Eleanor L.

The Court directs Plaintiffs to follow the procedures set forth in the\nundersigned's Instructions if they choose to pursue the matter.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' request for\npreliminary injunctive relief. Furthermore, because Plaintiffs' Complaint seeks\nhabeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2243, the Court DIRECTS\nthe Clerk to refer this case to a Magistrate Judge pursuant to Standing Order 18-01.\nSO ORDERED, this ^ day of July, 2020.\nEleanor L.
