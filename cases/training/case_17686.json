Plaintiff, Willie Gilder (โPlaintiffโ) files this action, on behalf of himself and \nothers similarly situated, against Sallie Mae Bank (โDefendantโ) for violations of Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 as a result of discriminatory background check policy and practice.  \nJURISDICTION  \n2.  This court has original jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C ยง 1331 and 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983.   \n3.  The acts alleged herein were committed within the State of Delaware.  \nPARTIES \n4.  Defendant,  Sallie  Mae  Bank,  is  located  at  300  Continental  Drive,  Newark, \nDelaware 19713.  \n5.  At all times relevant hereto, Plaintiff was a resident of Delaware, residing at 20 N. \nAppoquin Drive, Middletown, Delaware 19709.  \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 2 of 9 PageID #: 2\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS \n6.  On July 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed a timely Charge of Discrimination with the Delaware \nDepartment of Labor (โDDOLโ) alleging race discrimination against Defendant Sallie Mae Bank.  \n7.  On April 26, 2019, the Delaware Department of Labor issued their Preliminary \nFindings and Recommendations, referring the case to investigation.  \n8.  On  April  9,  2020,  Plaintiff  received  a  Right  to  Sue  Notice  from  the  Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").  \n9.  Plaintiff has filed this action under Title VII within ninety (90) days after receipt of \nhis Right to Sue Notice from the EEOC. \n10.  Plaintiff has satisfied all statutory prerequisites prior to filing this action against \nDefendant. \nFACTS \nPlaintiffโs Experience of Racial Discrimination  \n11.  In or around late September 2017, Plaintiff applied for the position of Collector I \nwithin Sallie Mae Bank. \n12.  On October 27, 2017, Plaintiff was interviewed by Sallie Mae Bank for the \nCollector I Position.  \n13.  On October 31, 2017, Plaintiff received an offer letter for the Collector I position \nin the APG Private Credit Department. \n14.  Sallie Mae Bankโs offer letter stated Plaintiffโs offer was โcontingent upon passing \na background checkโฆ.โ  \n15.  Sallie Mae Bankโs offer letter also provided Plaintiff with an anticipated start date \nof November 20, 2017.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 3 of 9 PageID #: 3\n16.  Plaintiff completed the steps necessary to register for Sallie Mae Bankโs online \nbackground check. \n17.   On November 9, 2017, Plaintiff received a correspondence from Sallie Mae Bank \nwhich listed his criminal background check and informed him information in the report may \nadversely affect his employment status.  \n18.  On or around November 30, 2017, Plaintiff provided Sallie Mae Bank with court \ndocuments which evidenced he was never convicted of dealing in cocaine, as well as a copy of a \nMay 15, 2017, court order granting his petition for expungement for his arrest for dealing in \ncocaine.  \n19.  Sallie Mae Bank determined Plaintiffโs 2007 charge for possession of a controlled \nsubstance was expunged.  \n20.  On December 1, 2017, Mr. Gilder received a letter from Sallie Mae Bank rescinding \nhis employment offer stating: โThis decision was based, either in whole or in part, on information \nprovided to us in a consumer report.โ \n21.  Plaintiff found out through Sallie Mae Bankโs position statement submitted to the \nDelaware Department of Labor that he was not selected for the position with Sallie Mae Bank \nspecifically based upon an outdated manslaughter conviction, which occurred approximately \ntwenty-five years prior to his offer of employment with Defendant.  \n22.  Plaintiffโs manslaughter conviction does not have any bearing on Plaintiffโs ability \nto successfully perform in the position of Collector I, the position Defendant hired him for. \n23.  Plaintiffโs manslaughter conviction is not a crime of dishonesty, breach of trust, or \nmoney laundering which would warrant automatic disqualification as set forth under Section 19 \nof the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1829). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 4 of 9 PageID #: 4\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n24.  Plaintiff brings this action individually and as a class action, pursuant to Rules 23(a) \nand 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of the following Class: all African \nAmerican individuals who were provided offers of employment and/or hired by Sallie Mae Bank, \nbut whose offers of employment or employment were subsequently rescinded or terminated based \non their race and Sallie Mae Bankโs policies and practices related to background history. \n25.  Plaintiff reserves the right to amend the definition of above-defined classes based \non discovery or legal developments. \n26.  Upon information and belief, numerous African American individuals across the \nUnited States have been adversely affected by Sallie Mae Bankโs background history employment \npolicy and practice, and joinder of all of those individuals is impracticable under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(1). Although Plaintiff does not know the precise number of job applicants harmed by Sallie \nMae Bankโs violations of Title VII, the number is far greater than feasibly could be addressed \nthrough joinder. The precise number is also uniquely within Sallie Mae Bankโs possession and the \nClass Members may be notified of the pendency of this action by published and/or mailed notice. \n27.  Plaintiff's claims are typical of the claims of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \nPlaintiff has the same claims for statutory and punitive damages that he seeks for absent class \nmembers. \n28.  There are questions or law or fact common to all such individuals, including (a) \nwhether Sallie Mae Bankโs policy and practice has a disparate impact on African American \nindividuals and (b) whether the policy and practice is justified by business necessity.   \n29.  The claims of Plaintiff are typical of the claims of other class members under Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 5\n30.  Plaintiff is a member of the class he seeks to represent. Sallie Mae Bank rescinded \nPlaintiffโs employment based on his race and pursuant to its background check policy, which has \na disparate impact on African American individuals and is neither job related nor consistent with \nbusiness necessity. \n31.  Plaintiff and his counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of members \nof the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \n32.  Class certification is appropriate pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \nbecause common questions of fact and law predominate over  any questions affecting only \nindividual Class Members. Sallie Mae Bank has maintained a common policy and practice of \nrescinding or terminating individualโs employment based on their background history, which \nPlaintiff contends is discriminatory and unlawful. A class action is superior to other available \nmethods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this litigation. Class Members have been damaged \nand are entitled to recovery as a result of Sallie Mae Bankโs uniform policies and practices. \nAlthough Sallie Mae Bank has maintained a common policy of rescinding and terminating \nemployeesโ employment due to their background history, many Class Members may be unaware \nthat their rights have been violated. \n33.  Plaintiff, on behalf of himself and the class members, moves for class certification, \nstatutory and punitive damages, and attorneyโs fees and costs against Defendant for his class \nclaims, as well as statutory, actual, and punitive damages, and attorneysโ fees and costs against \nDefendant for his individual claims; for pre-judgment and post judgment interest at the legal rate, \nand such other relief the Court does deem just, equitable, and proper. \n \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 6\nCLAIMS \nBased upon the above allegations, Plaintiff maintains the following legal claims against \nDefendant: \nCOUNT I \nDiscrimination Based on Race in Violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n \n34.  The allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 33 are incorporated by reference as if fully \nrestated herein. \n35.  Defendant  Sallie  Mae  Bank  employs  fifteen  or  more  employees  and  is  an \nโEmployerโ as defined by 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(b).  \n36.  Plaintiff received a Right to Sue letter from the EEOC April 9, 2020.  \n37.  Plaintiff has satisfied all statutory prerequisites for filing this action. \n38.  The  conduct  of  Sallie  Mae  Bank  as  described  above  constitutes  unlawful \ndiscrimination against Plaintiff and the class in violation of Title VII.  \n39.  Title VII makes it an unlawful practice to, among other things, โlimit, segregate, or \nclassify employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to \ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect an individualโs \nstatus as an employee, because of such individualโs race, color or national origin.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง \n2000e(a)(2). \n40.  Plaintiff is a member of a protected class of which Defendant was aware.  \n41.  Plaintiff was qualified for the position of Collector I for which he was hired.  \n42.  Plaintiff was in fact hired for the position of Collector I. \n43.  Defendant states it rescinded Plaintiffโs employment offer based upon an outdated \nmanslaughter  conviction.  Plaintiff's  manslaughter  conviction,  which  occurred  in  1992, \napproximately twenty-five year prior to his offer of employment with Defendant, does not affect \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 7 of 9 PageID #: 7\nPlaintiff's ability to perform in the position of Collector I. Defendant used Plaintiffโs race as a sole \nfactor in its decision to rescind his offer of employment. \n44.  Defendant intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of his race. \n45.  Sallie  Mae  Bankโs  policy  and  practice  of  disqualifying  job  applicants  with \nconvictions from employment has a disparate impact on Plaintiff and the class and is neither job \nrelated nor consistent with any business necessity.  \n46.  These policies, patterns and practices have caused Sallie Mae Bank to โfail or refuse \nto hireโ and โotherwise discriminate againstโ African American applicants and workers โbecause \nofโ their โrace,โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(1). The same policies, patterns, and practices have also \nโlimit[ed], segregate[d], [and] classif[ied]โ โemployees or applicants for employment in any way \nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise \nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individualโs race,โ id. ยง 2000e-2(a)(2). \n47.  It is well documented that communities of color, including African American \ncommunities across the country, are arrested and convicted at rates significantly higher than the \nwhite population.  \n48.  The  U.S.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (โEEOCโ)  has  issued \nguidance specifically outlining how overly restrictive background checks can disparately impact \ncommunities of color. See Enforcement Guidance on the Consideration of Arrest and Conviction \nRecords in Employment Decisions Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Apr. 25, 2012) \n(โEEOC Guidanceโ). The EEOC specifically emphasizes the importance of employers providing \nโan  opportunity  for  an  individualized  assessment  for  people  excluded  by  the  [background] \nscreenโฆ.โ Id. at Section V(B)(4). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 8\n49.  Sallie Mae Bankโs decision to rescind Plaintiffโs employment offer based solely on \nthe background check information has a disparate impact on African American applications by \nimporting the racial disparities in the criminal justice system into the employment process. \n50.  Defendant has subjected Plaintiff to discrimination on the basis of his race in \nviolation of Title VII by using and continuing to use a selection criterion and process for hiring, \nnamely the use of the criminal justice history information, that has a disparate impact on African \nAmericans including Plaintiff and the class.  \n51.  Defendant rescinded Plaintiffโs employment offer based solely on his background \nhistory, without regard to his successful record of performance; without any individualized \nassessment of his qualifications or ability to perform the job; and without giving him any \nopportunity  to  explain  his  background  history  or  describe  why  his  successful  record  of \nperformance or other factors make him qualified for continued employment. \n52.  Plaintiff and the class have suffered damages as a result of Defendantโs unlawful \ndiscriminatory actions, including emotional distress, past and future lost wages and benefits, as \nwell as costs for bringing this action.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Court order the following relief in favor of Plaintiff: \n \n53.  Certify the matter as a class action on behalf of the proposed class; \n54.  Designate Plaintiff as Class Representative for the class; \n55.  Designate Plaintiffโs Counsel as Class Counsel for the class; \n56.  Declare that Sallie Mae Bankโs background check policy and practice as described \nabove violates Title VII; \n57.  Award all available damages to Plaintiff and the class. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00924-UNA   Document 1   Filed 07/08/20   Page 9 of 9 PageID #: 9\n58.  Award Plaintiff any and all consequential damages, including but not limited to lost \nwages, salary, employment benefits, back pay, front pay, pre and post judgment interest, equity, \nliquidated damages, and any or all pecuniary damages.  \n59.  Award nominal damages. \n60.  Award attorneysโ fees and costs to Plaintiff and the class;  \n61.   Award pre- and post-judgment interest to Plaintiff and the class \n62.  Award Plaintiff all compensation due as a result of Defendantโs violations herein. \n63.  Award Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorneyโs fees. \n64.  Any  and  all  such  other  relief  as  the  Court  deems  appropriate  under  the \ncircumstances. \n          \n \n \nALLEN & ASSOCIATES    \n/s/ Michele D. Allen   \nMichele D.
