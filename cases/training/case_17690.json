    "summary": "<p>The Center for Legal Advocacy brought this lawsuit on behalf of criminal defendants with mental illnesses who had been held for months in Colorado jails awaiting placement in a competency restoration program after having been found incompetent to stand trial. The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and filed on August 31, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The Center accused the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) and the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP) of violating the criminal defendants’ Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The case was assigned to Judge Marcia S. Krieger.</p><p>Under a 2006 settlement agreement (known as the \"Zuniga Agreement\") arising from Colorado state court cases, the Department of Human Services had committed to providing evaluation and placement for treatment within 30 days after a judge determined that a criminal defendant was incompetent to stand trial. This agreement expired in 2009 when the state opened a new 200-bed forensic mental health facility; however, the new facility did not solve the long-standing delays, and the Center for Legal Advocacy then filed this lawsuit. Represented by staff attorneys and private counsel, the Center sought a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the state to complete competency evaluations within seven days of a court order and to admit a person for restoration treatment within seven days after evaluation and determination of incompetency. The Center also sought a declaratory judgment and attorneys’ fees.</p><p>Colorado criminal defendants found to be mentally incompetent receive restoration treatment at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo; CMHIP is the only mental hospital in the state authorized to provide such treatment. Because CMHIP was beyond capacity, criminal defendants found to be mentally incompetent were forced to wait in county jails, sometimes for months, before being admitted to receive treatment. In some cases, their detention in county jail while awaiting treatment was longer than their sentence would have been if they had pled guilty.</p><p>The Center argued that once a person accused of a crime has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, the only lawful purpose for continued detention is to restore that person to competency. If the state is not actively restoring the person to competency, the plaintiff argued, continued detention is a violation of the person’s due process rights. </p><p>On November 21, 2011, the parties agreed to settlement negotiations before Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland. On April 9, 2012, the court approved a settlement agreement. The agreement established deadlines for providing services to defendants with mental illnesses and required CMHIP to submit monthly reports to the plaintiff, with the first report due September 1, 2012. The Department of Human Services agreed to pay the plaintiff $75,000. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement until 60 days after the delivery of CMHIP’s final report.</p><p>On October 28, 2015, the plaintiff moved to reopen the case in order for the court to enforce the settlement. During the intervening three years, CMHIP had been submitting reports showing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement, but the plaintiff's investigation into the case of one defendant (who had been held in solitary confinement while awaiting restoration services) revealed that the state was fabricating data. The plaintiff alleged that the state had been in breach of the agreement since at least March 2015, but due to the “false and misleading” information in the monthly reports, the plaintiff had not become aware of the breech until July 2015.</p><p>On November 19, 2015, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Nina Y. Wang.  The court granted the motion to reopen the case on December 18, 2015.</p><p>On July 29, 2016, the court approved a second settlement agreement. The state agreed to pay $196,000 to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff agreed not to seek further attorneys’ fees or costs. The state did not admit liability, but it agreed to provide monthly reports to the plaintiff and to an independent consultant chosen by the parties, and to meet quarterly with the independent consultant and the plaintiff, until July 2021. The agreement provided for extending or shortening the duration of the agreement, depending on the state’s compliance or non-compliance. Significantly, the agreement allowed the state a six-month waiver of deadlines if it informed the plaintiff that “Departmental Special Circumstances,” defined as unexpected events beyond the state’s control, prevented it from meeting the deadlines specified in the agreement. The court retained jurisdiction until 60 days following the delivery of the final monthly report.</p><p>Two years later, on June 13, 2018, the plaintiff again filed a motion to reopen the case, for the court to enforce the second settlement agreement. The plaintiff said that the state was continuing to violate the agreement’s deadlines and that people with mental illnesses were still being held in jails for months while awaiting competency restoration services. “Not only do the current delays violate the timeframes Defendants twice agreed to in the settlement agreements, they also are in violation of the United States Constitution.” The continued delays, the plaintiff alleged, were “the result of ineptitude, a tragic pattern of institutional indifference, or both.” The state had invoked the “Departmental Special Circumstances” clause of the agreement in June 2017, suspending the agreement’s deadlines for six months. When that six-month grace period expired in December 2017, the state invoked the clause again. When that grace period expired in June 2018, the state continued to violate the deadlines required by the agreement, but without invoking the clause again. The plaintiff contended that the agreement did not allow the state to invoke the special circumstances clause multiple times consecutively; the state responded that there was nothing in the agreement suggesting that they could not, and that there had been an “unanticipated spike” in referrals for restoration treatment services.</p><p>During the course of the litigation, the Colorado General Assembly had worked to pass a bill that would have helped reduce jail wait times for defendants with mental illnesses. The plaintiff supported this bill until late in the process, when the bill was amended to allow the state to keep detainees with mental illnesses in jail for up to five months while receiving jail-based competency restoration services. </p><p>On June 14, 2018, the court granted the plaintiff's motion to reopen the case for the limited purpose of considering whether the settlement agreement had been breached and whether to order enforcement, but it reserved judgment on the question of whether the state had, in fact, breached the agreement.</p><p>On August 15, both parties moved for summary judgment. The defendants’ motion for summary judgment was denied on November 9, 2018; the plaintiff’s motion was granted in part the same day. The court discussed four issues it considered at the summary judgment phase:<ol><li>The first was whether the settlement agreed allowed the state to invoke the special circumstances clause repeatedly, without limitations. The court found that there was no numerical limit specified in the agreement; there was, however, a “non-numeric limit”: the agreement explicitly limited invocation of special circumstances to “circumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact the Department’s ability to comply with the timeframes.”<li>Second, whether the state breached the agreement when it re-invoked special circumstances in December 2017. The court denied summary judgment on this question.<li>Third, whether the state breached the agreement in June 2018, when it continued in non-compliance without re-invoking special circumstances. The court granted summary judgment on this question, finding that as of June 2018, the state was in breach of the agreement.<li>Fourth and finally, the question of what remedies the court should impose. The court declined to issue injunctive relief in this order, indicating that it would permit the state “no more than six months (and perhaps far less)…to come back into compliance.” It also indicated that if it later concluded that the state had been acting in bad faith, attorneys’ fees might be awarded to the plaintiff.</ol>On December 18, 2018, the court appointed special masters Groundswell Services, Inc. and its experts Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie. The court indicated that the special masters would replace the independent consultant, that the state would pay for the services of the special masters, and that the state was required to come into compliance and stay in compliance continuously for 18 months.</p><p>In January 2019, after submitting to the court a comprehensive plan for compliance, the state sought referral to a magistrate judge for settlement negotiations. The court referred the case to Magistrate Judge Michael E. Hegarty.</p><p>On February 28, 2019, the state submitted an amended comprehensive plan for compliance.</p><p>On April 2, 2019, the court issued a consent decree. It established specific timelines and limitations that the state must follow. It also established liquidated damages, and specific fines for non-compliance with deadlines. The state’s fines were capped at $10 million per year; the state was required to issue a weekly report indicating areas of non-compliance and tabulating total fines owed. The fines were to be paid into an independently-administered fund which would be used for providing non-Department services for defendants with mental illnesses. The state was required to create a comprehensive plan for compliance and a community-based outpatient competency restoration system focusing on triage instead of traditional waitlists. The Department agreed not to propose, sponsor, or support any legislative actions that would conflict with the terms of the decree.</p><p>The special masters would hold regular meetings between the parties. The consent decree was to remain in force until December 1, 2025, or until the state had been in strict compliance with the decree, as certified by the special masters, for two years (or for one year if the department had also reduced a specified class of detainees’ wait times to 21 days for that year).</p><p>The decree also awarded $654,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiff. In the event of violations of the decree, the plaintiff would be awarded attorneys’ fees and costs for pursuing the violation.</p><p>If the court found a material violation, it could order immediate enforcement of the agreement or injunctive relief, impose liquidated damages of up to $10,000 for each day of noncompliance, or fashion any other relief it deemed appropriate. </p><p>The state submitted its Long-Term Comprehensive and Cohesive Competency Plan, as required by the agreement, on March 2, 2020. The state paid over $1 million in fines as of August 2019, and the parties are engaged in negotiations about how to adjust fines incurred in 2020 (estimated to exceed $2 million) in light of unexpected delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The court’s supervision of the state’s compliance is ongoing.</p>",

Special Circumstances. The Parties recognize that to some extent the \nDepartment's ability to perfonn its statutory obligations and its obligations under this \nAgreement is based on factors beyond its control.  The Parties agree that, subject to the \nterms and conditions of this Paragraph 6, the timeframe requirements of Paragraph 2 of \nthis Agreement may be temporarily suspended. \n(a)  Special Circwnstances. The Department may invoke, under this \nParagraph 6, two categories of Special Circwnstances: \n(i)  \"Individual Special Circwnstances\" means a situation \nthat delays the offering of admission to a Pretrial Detainee, where the circumstances are \nnot within the control of the Department.  Historically, these situations have included \nrequests by the Court, jail, or defense counsel that admission be delayed because they \nare seeking an out-patient arrangement or a more appropriate placement; additional \ninformation or testing required for the evaluation is outstanding; the court bas ordered a \nbold and wait evaluation and the sheriff must transport the Pretrial Detainee to the \nnearest county where there are services available; or the inmate is not Medically \nCleared for admission due to illness or other non-psychiatric medical need.  These \nexamples are provided for illustration only.  Individual Special Circwnstances is a \nflexible concept, due to the unique and often unforeseen nature of these events. \n(ii)  \"Departmental Special Circumstances,\" means \ncircumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact the Hospital's ability \nto comply with the timeframes set forth in Paragraph 2.  This could mean an \nunanticipated spike in referrals, a substantial and material decrease in the Hospital's \nbudget, or another sentinel event impacting clinical decisions system wide.  These \nexamples are provided for illustration only.  Departmental Special Circumstances is a \nflexible concept, due to the unique and often unforeseen nature of these events. \n(b)  Effect of Invocation of Individual Special Circumstances.  The \nLegal Center will review the reporting of Individual Special Circumstances. If the Legal \nCenter questions the Department's invocation oflndividual Special Circumstances, the \nParties will confer to review the reasons for invocation of Individual Special \n-8-\n649149 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 52   Filed 04/09/12   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 37\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-BNB  Document 51-1  Filed 04/09/12  USDC Colorado  Page 10 of 35 \nCircumstances and to determine issues for resolution.  Additionally, the Hospital may \nproactively seek confinnation.that an event qualifies as an Individual Special \nCircumstance by contacting a representative of the Legal Center in advance offonnal \nreport!Pg of the event.  If the Department believes Individual Special Circumstances \nhave become a systemic issue, it will follow the Departmental Special Circumstances \nprocedure below.  The Parties shall use good faith efforts to try and resolve any disputes \nconcerning the invocation of Individual Special Circumstances.  However, if the Parties \ndo not reach an agreement through good faith efforts at resolution, either party may \nseek judicial enforcement of this Agreement. \n(i)  If the parties agree to the invocation of Individual Special \nCircumstances for a particular Pretrial Detainee, the timeframe requirements of \nParagraph 2 shall be suspended as to that individual Pretrial Detainee for a period of 60 \ndays from the maximum timeframe for admission of that particular Pretrial Detainee, as \ndefined in Paragraph 2. \n(ii)  The Hospital may attempt to invoke Individual Special \nCircumstances more than once for the same Pretrial Detainee, but it must follow the \nnotification and conferral procedures in Paragraph 6(b) each time it seeks to invoke \nIndividual Special Circumstances. \n(c)  Effect of Invocation ofDmartrnental Special Circumstances. If \nthe Department determines that Departmental Special Circumstances exist, it may \nnotify the Legal Center pursuant to the Notice provisions of Paragraph 18 of this \nAgreement, and in such notification, the Department shall provide a detailed \nexplanation of the basis for invoking Departmental Special Circumstances.  Upon the \nLegal Center's receipt of a Notice of Departmental Special Circumstances, the parties \nwill confer to review the reasons for invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances \nand to determine issues for resolution.  Thereafter, the Department will submit in \nwriting within 14 days of the conferral, a proposal to address the issues. The Legal \nCenter will provide a written response within 14 days of receiving this proposal, which \nshall include all areas of acceptance and may include counter-proposals. The \n-9-\n649149 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 52   Filed 04/09/12   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 37\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-BNB  Document 51-1  Filed 04/09/12  USDC Colorado  Page 11 of 35 \nDepartment must provide a reply to the Legal Center's response within 7 days of \nreceiving the Legal Center's response.  The Parties shall use good faith efforts to try and \nresolve any disputes concerning the invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances. \nThe parties are not precluded from seeking mediation to resolve any disputes. However, \nif the Parties do not reach an agreement through good faith efforts at resolution, either \nParty may seek judicial enforcement of this Agreement.  If Departmental Special \nCircumstances is invoked and then agreed upon by the parties, the timeftarne \nrequirements of Paragraph 2 shall be suspended as to all Pretrial Detainees affected by \nthe invoked Departmental Special Circumstances for a period of six months from the \ndate of the Department's invocation. \n(d)  Effect on Reporting Reguirements.  A Notice of Special \nCircwnstances shall not affect the Department's reporting obligations under Paragraph \n3 of this Agreement \n7.  Payment of Attorneys' Fees and Costs.

The Department shall assume the 30-day completion obligations \naccording to the following schedule: \na.  Beginning July 1, 2012:  Boulder, Arapahoe, Douglas and Pueblo \nCounties \nb.  Beginning January 1, 2013:  Denver, Broomfield, Larimer and \nWeld Counties \nc.  Beginning July 1, 2013:  Adams, Jefferson, Alamosa, El Paso, \nFremont, Custer, Huerfano, Otero, Teller, Elbert, and Crowley Counties \n2.  Counties not identified above in paragraph 1, are counties that use the \n\"hold and wait\" court ordered process. The counties not named above may choose \nbetween 1) an In-Patient Evaluation or 2) a Hold and Wait Evaluation, as defined \nbelow.  Hold and Wait Evaluations for these counties will be offered a meeting date \nwithin 30 days of the Hospital's receipt of the Court Order and Collateral Materials, and \nthe evaluation will be completed within 30 days of the meeting.  Counties that choose \nan In-Patient Evaluation will be subject to the timeframes for In-Patient Evaluations set \nforth in Paragraph 2(a) of the Agreement. \n3.  \"Hold and Wait Evaluation\" means an in-custody evaluation of a Pretrial \nDetainee that is conducted in another facility, after transport by the sheriff of the \ncommitment county to the alternative facility.  For example, a sheriff in a county in \nwhich there are no evaluation services may transport the Pretrial Detainee to the nearest \ncounty where these services are available, wait for the evaluator to complete the \ninterview and examination, and return the inmate to the jail in the county of \ncommitment. \n4.  If population growth causes such change that the \"hold and wait\" process \ndoes not meet the evaluation needs of a county, the parties agree to confer in good faith \nto address any issues that may arise. \n649149 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 52   Filed 04/09/12   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 37\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-BNB  Document 51-1  Filed 04/09/12  USDC Colorado  Page 21 of 35 \nAPPENDIX  2 \n649149 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 52   Filed 04/09/12   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 37\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-BNB  Document 51-1  Filed 04/09/12  USDC Colorado  Page 22 of 35 \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \nCivil Action No. 11-CV-2285-MSK-BNB \nCENTERFORLEGALADVOCACY,~a \nTHE LEGAL CENTER FOR PEOPLE WITH \nDISABILITIES AND OLDER PEOPLE, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nREGGIEBIC~ \nin his official capacity as Executive Director \nof the Colorado Department ofHwnan Services, and \nTERESA A.

The Colorado Department of Human Services (the “Department”) has a statutory \nobligation under C.R.S. §§ 16-8.5-101 et seq. (2018) to provide competency evaluations for \npersons charged with criminal offenses when the issue of competency is raised, and to provide \nrestoration treatment for persons found incompetent to proceed. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 47\n3.  The Parties settled the Lawsuit pursuant to a Settlement Agreement executed on \nApril 6, 2012 (the “2012 Settlement Agreement”), which was incorporated into the Order of \nDismissal entered by the District Court in the Lawsuit. Dkt. 52. \n4.  The  2012  Settlement  Agreement  included  a  provision  called  Special \nCircumstances, which recognized that to some extent the Department’s ability to perform its \nstatutory obligations and its obligations under the 2012 Settlement Agreement is based on factors \nbeyond the Department’s control. Dkt. 51-1. \n5.  The Department invoked Departmental Special Circumstances on August 3, 2015, \nciting:  (1) the  dramatic  increase  in  court  referrals  for  evaluations  and  treatment;  and \n(2) unprecedented staffing shortages at CMHIP. DLC disputed the Department’s invocation and \nfiled a motion to reopen the litigation for enforcement of the 2012 Settlement Agreement, which \nthis Court granted. Dkt. 62. After the Parties conducted settlement negotiations, they entered into \nan Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement which was filed with the Court on July 28, 2016 \n(the “2016 Settlement Agreement”). Dkt. 78. \n6.  Another  dispute  has  arisen  between  the  Parties.  The  Department  invoked \nDepartmental Special Circumstances for the second time on June 22, 2017, citing in support an \nunanticipated  spike  in  court-ordered  referrals  for  inpatient  competency  evaluations  and \nrestorations. On December 22, 2017, the day the Department’s June 22, 2017 invocation was set \nto expire, the Department invoked Departmental Special Circumstances for a third time, citing a \nsustained increase in the number of court-ordered referrals for inpatient competency evaluations \nand restorations. DLC disputed the Department’s second and third invocations as improper under \nthe terms of the 2016 Settlement Agreement. Defendants’ present inability to comply with the \ntimeframes required by the 2016 Settlement Agreement has created a lengthy waitlist of pretrial \n  2 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 47\ndetainees, some of whom have been forced to wait in jail for more than 150 days for a competency \nevaluation or restoration treatment. \n7.  DLC  moved  to  reopen  the  action  for  enforcement  of  the  2016  Settlement \nAgreement on June 13, 2018 (Dkt. 82), and this Court entered an order reopening that matter on \nJune 14, 2018. Dkt. 83. \n8.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment (Dkts. 96 and 97) and this \nCourt held a September 28, 2018 hearing on them. This Court issued an order on November 9, \n2018 granting in part and denying in part DLC’s motion for summary judgment and denying \nDefendants’  motion  for  summary  judgment.  Dkt. 113.  This  Court  held  that:  (1) the  2016 \nSettlement  Agreement  permits  Defendants  to  invoke  Departmental  Special  Circumstances \nconsecutively; and (2) the Defendants have been in breach of the 2016 Settlement Agreement’s \ntimeframes for inpatient restorations since June 2018. Id. The Court found that in each month from \nJuly 2017 through the present, Defendants have failed to maintain a 24-day monthly average for \ninpatient restoration treatment. The Court reserved ruling on whether Defendants breached the \n2016 Settlement  Agreement  by their invocations of Departmental Special  Circumstances in \nJune 2017 and December 2017 and whether the Defendants acted in bad faith. \n9.  The Court set this matter for a five-day evidentiary hearing to commence on \nMarch 18, 2019 on whether Defendants properly invoked Departmental Special Circumstances in \nJune 2017 and December 2017, so the Court can rule upon a forthcoming motion by DLC to \nenforce and to determine the appropriate scope and terms of an injunction going forward to address \nthe Department’s performance of inpatient restoration services. Dkt. 113. \n10.  After setting the case for hearing and commencing discovery, this Court granted \n \nDLC’s motion for appointment of a Special Master. Dkts. 117 & 123. On December 28, 2018, the \n  3 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 47\nCourt appointed Groundswell Services and its team of Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie \nas Special Master in this matter. Dkt. 130. Their duties, duration, and scope are outlined in the \nOrder Appointing Special Master. Dkt. 130. \n11.  On January 28, 2019, pursuant to the Court’s order, the Special Master submitted a \nreport with a Review of the Department’s Plan for Compliance and provided recommendations \nregarding the Plan. Dkt. 146. \n12.  On January 30, 2019, the Parties notified the Court that they agreed to mediate a \nresolution. The Court stayed discovery production, and the March 18, 2019 hearing was reset to \ncommence on June 3, 2019, in the event mediation was unsuccessful. The Court set a March 15, \n2019 deadline to produce a signed Consent Decree or to file a joint status report if the Parties \ncannot reach an agreement. \n13.  This Consent Decree resolves the Lawsuit. This Consent Decree is being entered in \norder  to  ensure  that  pretrial  detainees  obtain  timely  competency  evaluation  and  restoration \nservices, while both avoiding harming other persons with mental or developmental disabilities in \nthe Department’s care and avoiding protracted, costly and uncertain litigation. The terms of that \nresolution are embodied in this Consent Decree. \nNOW,  THEREFORE,  with  the  consent  of  the  Parties  to  this  Decree,  it  is  hereby \nORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that: \nII.  PARTIES, PURPOSE, INTENT \n \n14.  DLC is an independent nonprofit corporation headquartered in Denver, Colorado. \nDLC was designated in 1977 by Governor Richard Lamm as Colorado’s protection and advocacy \nsystem (“P&A System”) to protect and advocate for the rights of persons with mental illness and \ndevelopmental disabilities under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 15041-45. Since 1986, DLC has received federal grants on an annual basis, and has \n  4 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 47\nestablished and administered a P&A System in Colorado for individuals with mental illness \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 10803 and 10805 of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with \nMental Illness Act (the “PAIMI Act”). Since 1986, DLC has been and is currently the eligible \nP&A System for individuals with mental illness in Colorado as defined at 42 U.S.C. § 10802(2). \n15.  DLC has a governing board of directors which is composed of members who \nbroadly represent and who are knowledgeable about the needs of individuals with mental illness. \nDLC’s board of directors includes members who have received or are receiving mental health \nservices or who have family members who have received or are receiving mental health services. \n16.  DLC’s constituents include individuals with mental illness, who have been abused, \nneglected and/or suffered civil rights violations. DLC has established a PAIMI Advisory Council, \nover sixty percent (60%) of whose members themselves have received or are receiving mental \nhealth services or have family who have received or are receiving mental health services. The \nPAIMI Advisory Council advises the P&A System on the policies and priorities designed to \nprotect and advocate for the rights of individuals with mental illness. The Chair of DLC’s PAIMI \nAdvisory Council, who is also a member of DLC’s board of directors, has a family member who \nhas received and is receiving mental health services. \n17.  Together, DLC’s board of directors and PAIMI Advisory Council have developed \nthe annual priorities and objectives of the P&A System for individuals with mental illness. DLC’s \nPAIMI Program Priorities and objectives state that DLC will monitor facilities, including jails, and \ninvestigate reports/complaints of abuse, neglect and rights violations, and take action to remedy \nany abuse, neglect and/or civil rights violations. When the rights of its constituents are violated, \nDLC is authorized by statute to pursue legal remedies on their behalf, such as through litigation. \n42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(A)(B) & (C). To the extent DLC expends its resources to protect the rights \n  5 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 47\nof its constituents in county jails waiting for competency evaluations or restoration treatment, its \nresources are diverted away from assisting other constituents. \n18.  DLC  has  established  a  public  opinion  survey  for  constituents  and  interested \npersons, such as family members, to comment on DLC’s priorities and objectives and a grievance \nprocedure for clients or prospective clients, which allows its constituents with mental illness and \nfamily members of such individuals to assure them that DLC and the PAIMI Program are operating \nin compliance with the provisions of the PAIMI Act. \n19.  DLC’s constituents who are detained and charged with crimes are hindered from \nasserting their own constitutional rights. Obstacles they face include the imminent mootness of \nindividual claims as they are likely to be admitted to CMHIP for restoration treatment during the \npendency of any case they might bring. In addition, pretrial detainees who are presumed or \ndetermined to be incompetent to proceed are often impaired and unable to direct or participate in \nlitigation on their own behalf. \n20.  Defendant Michelle Barnes is sued in her official capacity as the Executive Director \nof the Colorado Department of Human Services. As relevant here, the Department is responsible \nunder Colorado law for the operation of CMHIP and the provision of competency evaluations and \nrestoration treatment. Forensic Services within the Department’s Office of Behavioral Health \nprovides court-ordered competency evaluations. \n21.  Defendant Jill Marshall is sued in her official capacity as the Chief Executive \nOfficer of CMHIP. As relevant here, CMHIP currently is the state’s principal forensic mental \nhealth  hospital  that  accepts  custody  of  pretrial  detainees  for  competency  evaluations  and \nrestoration treatment. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 47\n22.  This Consent Decree will require the Department to ensure that thousands of future \npretrial detainees will not be forced to wait in jail for months before receiving their court-ordered \ncompetency evaluations and restoration treatment in violation of their constitutional rights; at the \nsame time, the Department will avoid negatively impacting other persons with mental health or \ndevelopmental disabilities or juveniles in their care. In doing so, the Department will be required \nto implement concrete reforms that will allow for long-term compliance with this Consent Decree. \nThe Parties believe that with the guidance of the Court and the Special Master (to be discussed \ninfra) the Department will be able to: \n(a)  Develop  a  comprehensive,  cohesive  approach  to  planning  to  maintain \ncompliance with this Consent Decree. \n(b)  Adhere to the admission timeframes for pretrial detainees, and at the same \ntime  avoid  causing  harm  to  and/or  displacement  to  other  people  with  mental  or \ndevelopmental disabilities in their care. \n(c)  Maximize the use of competency services in the community, by funding, \ndeveloping, recruiting, and supporting a variety of community services. Dkt. 146. \n(d)  Create a team that will develop a centralized, data-driven system that \ncaptures, analyzes, and disseminates data in a reliable and meaningful manner to inform \ndecisions and planning. Id. \n(e)  Develop and implement a triage system that considers clinical needs to \nassign individualized services. Id. \n(f)  Implement state-wide uniform standards for competency evaluators and \nevaluations and conduct rigorous training for forensic evaluators and restoration providers \nto ensure evaluations are of high quality. Id. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 47\n(g)  Prepare budget requests and propose and support legislation which are \ncalculated to meet the terms of the Consent Decree and take all necessary next steps and \nexert good faith efforts to obtain adequate funding from the Colorado General Assembly. \nIII.  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND STANDING \n \n23.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3) because it arises under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201-02. \n \n24.  Venue is appropriate in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the events \ngiving rise to this Complaint occurred in this District. \n25.  DLC has standing in the Lawsuit to assert due process claims on behalf of its \nconstituents,  persons  within  the  State  of  Colorado  with  a  mental  illness  and/or  intellectual \ndisability who have been charged with a criminal offense, ordered to receive a competency \nevaluation or restoration treatment, and who await the provision of that treatment in Colorado jails. \nIV.  PARTIES BOUND AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT \n \n26.  In entering this Consent Decree, Defendants do not admit any violation of law. This \nConsent Decree shall not be interpreted in any court, administrative, or other proceeding as \nevidence of Defendants’ liability. \n27.  The parties agree that the right to timely competency services implicates rights \nsecured and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article 1, \nand 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n28.  This Consent Decree is legally binding and judicially enforceable. This Consent \nDecree shall be applicable to and binding upon the parties, their officers, agents and employees, \nand their successors and assigns. \n  8 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 47\n29.  Until the Consent Decree is terminated, the parties hereby consent to the Court’s \ncontinuing supervision in this matter, until further order of the Court, and to its authority to \ninterpret the provisions of this Agreement, to review and adopt plans necessary to implementation \nof its terms, to modify its terms as may be needed to effect its purposes, and to take appropriate \nactions within its equitable powers to ensure its enforcement and the fulfillment of its terms and \npurposes. \n30.

The Department shall notify \n \nthe Special Master and DLC weekly regarding any non-compliance with timeframes. \n \n(a)  Only one notice per Pretrial Detainee shall be provided and should include: \n \n(i)  The name of the Pretrial Detainee; \n \n(ii)  The Pretrial Detainee’s location; \n \n(iii)  The Pretrial Detainee’s charges based on information available to \nthe Department; \n(iv)  The Pretrial Detainee’s bond amount based on information available \nto the Department; \n(v)  Whether  a  forensic  assessment  has  been  made  on  whether \nrestoration in the community is appropriate; \n(vi)  Whether  the  Pretrial  Detainee  has  previously  been  found \nincompetent; \n  16 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 47\n(vii)  What efforts are being made to provide timely Competency Services \nto the Pretrial Detainee, including communications with the court, Court Liaisons, \nand community mental health providers; \n(b)  The  Department  shall  accompany  its  Monthly  Data  Report    (see \nParagraph 52) with a separate “Fines Report” which will include the names of the Pretrial \nDetainees for whom the Department has accrued a fine during the preceding month, the \nnumber of days each Pretrial Detainee waited in the County Jails past the timeframes for \ncompliance, and the total fines owed by the Department for the preceding month. \n(c)  The Department shall pay the total fines owed on the date the Fines Report \nis submitted to the Special Master to be deposited in an interest-bearing account created \nfor the purpose of funding non-Department services for persons with mental illness. The \naccount will be managed by a third-party agreed upon by the parties; the parties will \nidentify  and  agree  to  said  third-party  no  later  than  December  31,  2019.  Decisions \nconcerning payments out of the account will be made by a committee consisting of a \nrepresentative from the Plaintiff, a representative from the Department, and the Special \nMaster. Any disputes regarding the fines or third-party account manager shall be handled \nthrough the dispute resolution process identified in Paragraph 59. \nVII.  ADDITIONAL  REQUIRED  ACTION  FOR  SUSTAINABLE  LONG-TERM \nCOMPLIANCE \n \n39.  Civil Bed Freeze. The Department’s 2018 Plan included an effort to freeze civil \n \nadmissions to its beds to devote Hospital beds to perform Inpatient Restoration Treatment services. \nOn February 7, 2019, the Department agreed to stop this practice. The Department will continue \nto leave the state’s civil and juvenile beds allocated as of the execution of this Consent Decree for \ncivil and juvenile psychiatric admissions and will not freeze or convert those beds to provide \ncompetency services for Pretrial Detainees, unless the Department receives prior agreement from \n  17 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 47\nthe Special Master to use unutilized beds for such purposes. This strategy to facilitate compliance \nwith the Consent Decree shall only be re-implemented in the future upon agreement of the Special \nMaster. \n40.  Comprehensive and Cohesive Plan. The Special Master’s first  recommendation \n \nwas to revise the Department’s 2018 Plan into a more comprehensive and cohesive plan. Dkt. 146. \nBy or about January 2020, the Department will produce an initial plan resulting from a long-term \nvisioning process with DLC, the Special Master, and stakeholders that will consolidate disparate \npieces of the Department’s current plan, along with legislative initiatives, in a cohesive package \nfor courts, administrators, service providers, and legislators to consider. As referenced in the \nSpecial Master’s Recommendation Number 7, the  2020 Plan will highlight the methods to \nprioritize quality amid quantity and time pressures. Dkt. 146 at 42. On an annual basis thereafter, \nthe Department will review and revise the plan as appropriate based upon data provided by the \nDepartment. \n41.  Increase Community Restoration Services. The Parties agree that the Department \n \nis responsible for  directly  providing  or contracting  with  individuals  or agencies  to provide \nCompetency Services. The Parties agree that County Jails are not the best place for Pretrial \nDetainees to wait for treatment or receive treatment. The Parties agree that it is in the best interests \nof some Pretrial Detainees to receive Competency Services in the community, as those Pretrial \nDetainees will avoid unnecessary institutionalization and will receive treatment in the least \nrestrictive environment. Additionally, the movement of appropriate Pretrial Detainees to the \ncommunity will lessen the need for more Hospital beds and hiring additional qualified staff by the \nDepartment. The Parties agree that increased community restoration is a key component to comply \nwith the timeframes in this Consent Decree as to Competency Services. The Special Master’s \n  18 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 47\nRecommendation Number 2 is for the Department to “[r]educe emphasis on inpatient beds and \nincrease  emphasis  on  community  services.”  Dkt.  146  at  17.  The  Special  Master’s \nRecommendation  Number 3  is  to  “[f]urther  prioritize  outpatient   competence   restoration.” \nDkt. 146 at 23. As a result, the Department shall: \n(a)  Implement  a  coordinated  wide-scale  outpatient  (community-based) \ncompetency restoration (OCR) system. This system shall be integrated and submitted with \nthe “Comprehensive and Cohesive Plan” referenced in Paragraph 40 herein. This plan shall \nbe approved by the Special Master. \n(b)  The Department may utilize private hospital beds to meet the needs of \nPretrial Detainees meeting C.R.S. § 27-65-105(a) civil commitment criteria and with \nprioritization to Pretrial Detainees already residing within the same geographic location. \nThe Department shall create a plan to implement this subsection (b) to be approved by the \nSpecial Master. \n(c)  The  Department currently  estimates  that  10-20% of  Pretrial Detainees \nadmitted for inpatient restoration do not need hospital-level care. Dkt. 146 at 29. The \nDepartment will make best efforts to reduce inpatient restoration hospitalizations by 10% \nand increase community restorations by 10% in six-month increments beginning June 1, \n2019. The baseline for the preceding sentence will be determined by the Special Master by \nJune 1, 2019, utilizing data provided by the Department. On June 1, 2020, the Special \nMaster will establish a modification of this guideline based upon a survey of the data \ncollection and implementation of the Department’s Plan. \n42.  Additional Department Hires. By June 1, 2019, the Department shall submit a plan \n \nto  the  Special  Master  and  DLC  to  hire  the  following  positions  by  August 1,  2019.  The \n  19 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 47\nDepartment’s plans and job descriptions shall be guided by the recommendations of the Special \nMaster and the January 28, 2019 Special Report. See Dkt. 146. \n(a)  Forensic Support Team. The Forensic Support Team will be formalized to \n \nfollow the Special Master’s Recommendation Number 6. Dkt. 146. The team will include \na full-time Supervising Coordinator who is familiar with the Department’s duties and \nobligations herein, as well as the Department’s and Hospital’s processes and procedures in \nproviding  services  to  Pretrial  Detainees,  and  whose  responsibilities  will  include  to: \n(1) interface with the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) \nregarding persons ordered to be evaluated for competency and those determined to be \nincompetent; (2) confer with the Special Master; (3) focus on budget and cost of inpatient \nversus outpatient care; (4) work directly with Office of Behavioral Health staff to assist in \nreducing the waitlist and meeting the timeframes of the Consent Decree; and (5) interface \nwith the Court Liaisons or representatives funded by the judiciary to interface with the \ncourts, Department, and community mental health centers. The Supervising Coordinator \nwill work directly with the Special Master to ensure the Department’s compliance with the \nterms of this Consent Decree and to assist with other issues involving Pretrial Detainees on \nan  individual  or  system-wide  basis  to  increase  the  Department’s  performance  with \nproviding timely Competency Services. In addition, the Forensic Support Team will \ninclude an effective number of coordinators (to be approved by the Special Master) \nresponsible  for  each  judicial  district  who  can  provide  a  centralized  structure  for \nstakeholders to immediately access detailed information about programs, clients, and \nsettings and can complement the Court Liaison Program. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 47\n(b)  Data Management Team. The Data Management Team will be formalized \n \nin a plan on the schedule identified in Paragraph 42 to follow the Special Master’s \nRecommendation Number 5. Dkt. 146. This team will be dedicated and designed to \nspecifically assist with implementation of the Department’s Plan by collecting specific data \non  which  the  Department  will  base  its  projections  and  recommendations,  calculate \ninpatient  bed  space,  assess  community  restoration  capacity,  and  determine  financial \nestimates. The team will be comprised of at least three full-time employees dedicated to \ncollecting and analyzing data affecting the competency system. The Special Master shall \napprove of the type of employees that shall be hired to comprise the Data Management \nTeam. \n43.  Develop and Implement a Triage System. The Special Master’s Recommendation \n \nNumber 4 recognizes a need for the Department to prioritize a triage approach over traditional \nwaitlist approaches. Dkt. 146 at 27. Therefore, by June 1, 2019, the Department shall develop and \nimplement a triage system to screen each Pretrial Detainee and make recommendations to the \ncommitting court as to the most clinically appropriate level of care to restore the Pretrial Detainee \nto  competency.  The  Department  shall  seek  suggestions  from  the  Special  Master  on  the \ndevelopment of a triage system, and two weeks prior to the implementation of the triage system it \nshall be approved by the Special Master. The Department shall continue to fine-tune the triage \nsystem with the assistance of the Special Master and shall include the progress of the triage system \nin its annual submission of the Department Plan. \n44.  Legislative Actions. The Parties agree that they will not  propose, sponsor, or \n \nsupport any legislation that would violate the terms of this Consent Decree. The Department will \nprovide DLC and the Special Master with all budget requests and proposed legislation affecting \n  21 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 47\nthis Consent Decree when they are sent to the Colorado General Assembly. The Special Master \nshall provide its opinion and recommendations on the proposed legislation and how it could impact \nthe short- or long-term compliance with the Consent Decree. A copy of the final budget approved \nby the Colorado General Assembly shall be sent to the Special Master and DLC immediately \nfollowing approval of the budget. \nVIII.

During the first year after the Effective Date, \nmeetings shall be held monthly, and quarterly thereafter, but may be scheduled at greater intervals \n  29 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 47\nat the Special Master’s discretion. The Parties shall treat the meetings as a serious opportunity to \nraise concerns or potential barriers with the system of institutions involved in achieving or \nmaintaining full compliance with the Consent Decree. Each Party shall designate appropriate \nsenior representatives, based on the agenda for each meeting, to participate in the meetings so that \nmeaningful discussion can occur, and may include outside stakeholders, as appropriate based on \nthe agenda. The first monthly meeting shall be scheduled for a mutually agreeable date  in \nApril 2019. \nX.  SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES \n \n57.  Special Circumstances. To some extent, the Department’s ability  to perform its \n \nstatutory obligations and its obligations under this Consent Decree may be based on factors beyond \nits control. As a result, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Paragraph, the timeframe \nrequirements  of  this  Consent  Decree  may  be  temporarily  suspended  in  the  following \ncircumstances: \n(a)  Special Circumstances Defined. The Department may invoke, under this \n \nParagraph 57, two categories of Special Circumstances: \n \n(i)  “Individual Special Circumstances” means a situation that delays \nthe Offer of Admission to a Pretrial Detainee, where the circumstances are not \nwithin the control of the Department. Individual Special Circumstances is a flexible \nconcept. These situations may include, for example and without limitation, the \nfollowing: (1) requests by a court, County Jail, defense counsel, or the Department \nthat admission be delayed because additional information or testing required for the \nevaluation is outstanding; (2) a court has ordered a Hold and Wait Evaluation, and \nthe sheriff must transport the Pretrial Detainee to the nearest county where there are \nservices available; (3) the Pretrial Detainee is not Medically Cleared for admission \n  30 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 47\ndue to illness or other non-psychiatric medical need, but not a need that can be \nsatisfied  by  a  plan  for a  reasonable  accommodation;  or (4) when the Pretrial \nDetainee is approaching the deadline for transfer to an inpatient facility, restoration \nto competency is imminent, and treatment providers responsible for the Pretrial \nDetainee’s  care  determine  that  transfer  is  not  clinically  appropriate.  Upon \nresolution of the Individual Special Circumstance, the Pretrial Detainee must be \nOffered Admission for Competency Services immediately but no longer than three \ndays, unless in derogation of a Tier 1 need, in which case the Pretrial Detainee will \nbe offered the next available bed. \n(ii)  “Departmental Special Circumstances” means circumstances the \nDepartment could not reasonably foresee, prepare for, address through advanced \nplanning, and that are beyond the control of the Department, which impact the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with this Consent Decree. The failure or refusal of \nthe Colorado General Assembly (or any other funding source) to adequately fund \nthe  Department’s  operations,  programs,  or  plan  shall  not  be  considered  a \nDepartmental  Special  Circumstance.  In  order  to  invoke  this  paragraph,  the \nDepartment would first need to obtain consent from DLC or seek relief and have \nsuch relief granted under the dispute resolution paragraph outlined below. \n(b)  Effect of Invocation of Individual Special Circumstances.   DLC and the \n \nSpecial Master will review the reporting of Individual Special Circumstances. If DLC \nquestions the Department’s invocation of Individual Special Circumstances, the Parties \nwill confer to review the reasons for invocation of Individual Special Circumstances and \nto determine issues for resolution. Additionally, the Department may proactively seek \n  31 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 47\nconfirmation that an event qualifies as an Individual Special Circumstance by contacting a \nrepresentative of DLC or the Special Master in advance of formal reporting of the event. If \nthe Department believes Individual Special Circumstances have become a systemic issue, \nit will follow the Departmental Special Circumstances procedure below. The Parties shall \nuse good faith efforts to try  and resolve any disputes  concerning the invocation of \nIndividual Special Circumstances. However, if the Parties do not reach an agreement \nthrough good faith efforts at resolution, the Parties will follow the dispute resolution \nprocess described in Section XII. \n(i)  If  the  Parties  agree  to  the  invocation  of  Individual  Special \nCircumstances for a particular Pretrial Detainee, the timeframe requirements of this \nConsent Decree shall be suspended as to that individual Pretrial Detainee for a \nperiod to be determined by the Special Master. \n(ii)  The  Department  may  invoke  Individual  Special  Circumstances \nmore than once for the same Pretrial Detainee, but it must follow the notification \nand conferral procedures in Paragraph 57(b) each time it seeks to invoke Individual \nSpecial Circumstances. \n(c)  Effect  of  Invocation  of  Departmental  Special  Circumstances.  If  the \n \nDepartment determines that Departmental Special Circumstances exist, it shall notify the \nCourt, the Special Master, and DLC in writing, and in such notification, the Department \nshall  provide  a  detailed  explanation  of  the  basis  for  invoking  Departmental  Special \nCircumstances,  a  plan  to  remedy  the  Departmental  Special  Circumstances,  and  the \nprojected timeframe for resolution. The period of Departmental Special Circumstances \nshall commence on the date that the Notice of Departmental Special Circumstances is \n  32 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 47\nprovided to the Court. Upon the invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances, the \ntimeframe requirements of this Consent Decree shall be automatically suspended for six \nmonths, unless the Department notifies DLC that a shorter time is sufficient to resolve \nDepartmental Special Circumstances, commencing with the month in which the Notice of \nDepartmental Special Circumstances is provided to the Court. The Department shall \nprovide  written  notice  to  DLC  of  its  intent  to  terminate  Departmental  Special \nCircumstances. Upon DLC’s receipt of a Notice of Departmental Special Circumstances, \nit may request supporting documentation for the Department’s notice, and the Parties shall \nconfer to review the reasons for invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances, to \nresolve questions that the Special Master or DLC may have about the circumstances that \ntriggered the notice, and to assess whether the Parties are able to resolve any disagreement \nconcerning  invocation  of  Departmental  Special  Circumstances.  If  DLC  decides  to \nchallenge the invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances, it may do so by following \nthe dispute resolution procedure identified in Section XII. The Department is prohibited \nfrom invoking Departmental Special Circumstances consecutively. The Department cannot \ninvoke Departmental Special Circumstances any sooner than June 1, 2021. \n(d)  Effect on Reporting Requirements.  A Notice of Departmental Special \n \nCircumstances shall not affect the Department’s reporting obligations under this Consent \nDecree. In addition to such reporting obligations, the Department will provide a monthly \nwritten status report to DLC and the Special Master on its plans and progress to remedy \nDepartmental Special Circumstances. \nXI.  DURATION \n \n58.  Duration and Certification. The terms and provisions of this Consent Decree shall \n \nremain in force until December 1, 2025, except that a sustained period of two years of compliance \n  33 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 47\nby the Department with all terms of this Consent Decree, including the strictest timeframes \nidentified herein, as certified by the Special Master, shall result in termination of this Consent \nDecree. In the event the Department complies with all terms of this Consent Decree and the \nstrictest timeframes for one year, while concurrently reducing Tier 2 timeframes to 21 days for \nthat one year period, such compliance shall result in termination of this Consent Decree. \nXII.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND REMEDIES \n \n59.  Dispute Resolution. \n \n(a)  Dispute Resolution Generally. Any dispute concerning the interpretation or \n \nimplementation of this Consent Decree, other than those for which DLC seeks the remedy \nof contempt, shall first be submitted to the Special Master, who shall attempt to informally \nmediate and resolve the dispute. The Special Master may make use of such informal dispute \nresolution processes as it deems necessary, which may include, but are not limited to, \ninformal suggestions or recommendations and compulsory conferences of the Parties. \n(b)  Dispute Resolution for Non-Contempt Proceedings. If informal attempts \nfail to resolve the matters identified in the preceding paragraph, or if the Special Master \nbelieves the Department has materially violated this Consent Decree or has in some other \nmanner acted in bad faith, the Special Master or any Party may submit a written request \nto Judge Hegarty (or, in the event he is no longer serving as a magistrate judge in this \nDistrict,  a  magistrate  judge  successor  or  someone  mutually  agreed  upon  by  the \nparties) for an evidentiary hearing, requesting specific relief and a decision. A copy of \nthis request shall be served upon opposing counsel and the Special Master. Judge Hegarty \nshall determine whether the dispute requires an evidentiary hearing, and, if so, schedule \nsuch hearing at the convenience of the Parties. Judge Hegarty shall file a written decision \nsupported  by  written  findings  of  fact  and  may  impose  any  relief  permitted  by  this \nConsent Decree. This includes, \n  34 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 39 of 47\nbut is not limited to, attorney’s fees. Judge Hegarty’s decision shall become final and \nbinding upon the Parties. \n(c)  Dispute Resolution for Contempt Proceedings.  In the event  that DLC \n \nbelieves the Department’s violation of this Consent Decree warrants contempt, DLC shall \nfirst attempt mediation through Judge Hegarty, who will conduct the proceeding on an \nexpedited basis. Upon a finding by Judge Hegarty that the matter cannot be mediated, DLC \nmay file a Motion for Order to Show Cause on the matter in controversy with this Court. \n60.  Remedies for Non-Contempt Violations of the Consent Decree. \n \n(a)  Timeframe Violations.  The Parties agree that, in addition to the fines set \n \nforth in Paragraph 37 and the penalties set forth in Paragraph 60(b), DLC shall be entitled \nto seek its attorney’s fees and costs for pursuing such violations. In no event, however, \nshall the Department be subject to contempt strictly for violations of the timeframes for the \ndelivery of Competency Services, except that sustained and/or egregious violations of \nthose timeframes may constitute a material violation of this Consent Decree. \n(b)  Material Violations.  Upon a finding of a material violation, Judge Hegarty \n \nmay  order  immediate  enforcement  of  the  agreement,  order  injunctive  relief,  impose \nliquidated damages (as detailed below), attorney’s fees, or fashion any other relief deemed \nappropriate for the Department’s violation of this Consent Decree. \n(c)  Liquidated Damages.  The Parties further agree that if Judge Hegarty finds \n \na material violation of this Consent Decree, the damages sustained by the Pretrial Detainees \nbecause of such violation would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain. The Parties \nagree to provide for damages rather than a penalty and agree that in addition to other \nremedies available to DLC, Judge Hegarty can award liquidated damages of up to $10,000 \n  35 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 40 of 47\na day for each day Judge Hegarty determines the violation to have occurred and continuing \nuntil the violation is remedied. \n(d)  Non-Timeframe Violations Adjudicated by Contempt.  Nothing set forth \n \nherein  is  intended  to,  or  in  any  way  shall,  limit  the  Court’s  power  to  enforce  the \nDepartment’s  compliance  with  this  Consent  Decree  through  contempt  (except  for  a \nviolation of the timeframes, which the parties have agreed is not subject to contempt). In \nsuch proceedings, the Court shall have all powers afforded by law to remedy the contempt \nand/or punish the Department for violation of this Consent Decree. \nXIII.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS \n \n61.  Effective Date of the Consent Decree. This Consent Decree shall become effective \n \non the date of the Court’s entry. \n \n62.  Remedies by Pretrial Detainees Not Precluded.  Nothing in this Consent Decree \n \nlimits a Pretrial Detainee, or his or her counsel, from bringing other court action, such as contempt \nof court proceedings, if the circumstances warrant such action. However, the provisions of this \nConsent Decree are intended to be enforced solely by the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Colorado. In any court action brought by a Pretrial Detainee for contempt of court, the \nDepartment retains all defenses to such action, including but not limited to those attending \nC.R.C.P. 107. Nevertheless, the Parties agree that the terms of this Consent Decree are not binding \nor enforceable as to individual Pretrial Detainees, because they are not parties to this Lawsuit. \n63.  Contempt Actions Against Other Agencies, Non-Complying Sheriff’s  Offices,  \n \n District Attorney’s Offices, and Defense  Counsel Not Precluded . Nothing in this Consent \nDecree \n \nprecludes any court from issuing contempt citations to sheriffs for failing to comply with orders to \ntransport Pretrial Detainees to or from the Hospital, district attorneys for violating timelines \n  36 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 41 of 47\nordered by courts to provide Collateral Materials, or defense attorneys who fail to comply with \norders related to Competency Services. \n64.  Complete  Consent  Decree;  Modification;  and  Waiver.  This  Consent  Decree \n \nconstitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous \nagreements, representations, warranties, and understandings of the Parties. This Consent Decree \nreplaces and supersedes the Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement executed by the Parties \non July 28, 2016 in its entirety. No supplement, modification, or amendment of this Consent \nDecree shall be binding unless entered by the Court. \n65.  Attorney’s Fees and Costs. Part of the effect of this Consent Decree is to settle the \n \nspecific matters outlined or referenced in this Consent Decree as to the Parties up to the date the \nConsent Decree is finalized. Accordingly, the Colorado State Office of Risk Management shall \npay DLC’s counsel the lump sum amount of $654,177.50 (the dollar amount is contingent upon \nthe State Claims Board’s approval of this amount on March 26, 2019) in full and final settlement \nof all costs and fees, including attorney’s fees, incurred by DLC’s counsel starting on June 1, 2017, \nup to and including the date this Consent Decree is finalized and signed by all Parties hereto (the \n“Settlement Payment”). When the final amount is approved by the State Claims Board, DLC’s \ncounsel shall enter a separately filed binding agreement related to the Settlement Payment, which \nagreement shall be on the then-current, Controller-approved standard settlement agreement. The \nSettlement Payment shall be paid to Eytan Nielsen LLC as follows:  A warrant in the amount of \n$654,177.50 (or in the dollar amount approved by the State Claims board on March 26, 2019) will \nbe made payable to Eytan Nielsen LLC. The warrant will be delivered to Eytan Nielsen LLC within \n30 days from March 26, 2019, or as soon after March 26, 2019 as practicable. Prior to delivery of \nthe warrant, the Controller-approved settlement document will be signed by all Parties and the \n  37 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 42 of 47\nController. No withholding for payment of federal, state or local taxes will occur respecting any \nwarrant issued pursuant to this Consent Decree other than those required by federal or state law or \nrules governing the Controller. Eytan Nielsen LLC will complete, execute and provide an original \nof I.R.S. form W-9 in conjunction with submitting the signed Consent Decree as an initial step in \ncompleting the arrangements described here. A Form 1099 will be issued to Eytan Nielsen LLC \non the Settlement Payment. The Settlement Payment made hereunder shall not be designated as \nwages, salary or back pay, except to the extent required by federal or state law or by rules \ngoverning the Controller, but is instead made in compromise of all claims arising from or related \nto the subject matter of this Consent Decree for those matters up to and including the date this \nConsent Decree is fully executed and entered by the Court. \n66.  Written Notice.  Any notice or other communication required or permitted under \n \nthis Consent Decree shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when \n \n(1) mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, (2) mailed by \novernight express mail or other nationally recognized overnight or same-day delivery service, \n(3) sent as a PDF attachment to electronic mail, or (4) delivered in person, to the Parties at the \nfollowing addresses: \nIf DLC, to:  Disability Law Colorado \n455 Sherman Street, #130 \nDenver, Colorado 80203 \n \nAttention:  Mark Ivandick \nmivandick@disabilitylawco.org \n \nJennifer Purrington \njpurrington@disabilitylawco.org \n  38 \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 165   Filed 04/02/19   USDC Colorado   Page 43 of 47\nWith a copy to:  Iris Eytan, Esq. \nEYTAN NIELSEN LLC \n3200 Cherry Creek South Drive \nDenver, CO 80209 \niris@eytan-nielsen.com \n \nIf the Department, to:  Department of Human Services \n1575 Sherman Street \nDenver, Colorado 80203 \n \nAttention:  Michelle Barnes \nmichelle.barnes@state.co.us \n \nIf the Hospital, to:  Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo \n1600 West 24th Street \nPueblo, Colorado 81003 \n \nAttention:  Jill Marshall, M.P.H. \njill.marshall@state.co.us \n \nWith a copy to:  Office of the Attorney General \nRalph L.

Presumptively innocent men and women are languishing in Colorado’s jails \nawaiting court-ordered mental health evaluations and restorative treatment.  These individuals, \nwho have been charged with but not convicted of crimes, have constitutionally protected liberty \ninterests in promptly receiving such evaluations and treatment while not being confined any \nlonger than necessary.  Colorado state officials are failing to timely conduct competency \nevaluations and admit into the state psychiatric hospital individuals found not competent to stand \ntrial, creating delays for treatment that last as long as six months.  These unjustifiable delays \n- 1 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 26\nviolate the United States Constitution by depriving individuals unable to protect themselves of \ntheir due process rights, and they strain the resources of local sheriffs unable to treat these \nmentally ill detainees. \nPARTIES \n2.  The Legal Center files this Complaint against Reggie Bicha, in his official \ncapacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Human Services (the \n“Department”), and Teresa A. Bernal, in her official capacity as Interim Superintendent of the \nColorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (“CMHIP”). \n3.  The Legal Center is an independent non-profit corporation headquartered in \nDenver, Colorado. The Legal Center was designated in 1977 by Governor Richard Lamm as \nColorado’s protection and advocacy system (“P&A System”) to protect and advocate for the \nrights of persons with mental illness and developmental disabilities under the Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. 42 U.S.C. §§ 15041-45.  Since 1986, the Legal \nCenter has received federal grants on an annual basis, and has established and administered a \nP&A System in Colorado for individuals with mental illness pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 10803 and \n10805 of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act, (“PAIMI Act”).  \nSince 1986, the Legal Center has been and is currently the eligible P&A System for individuals \nwith mental illness in Colorado as defined at 42 U.S.C. § 10802(2).   \n4.  The Legal Center has a governing board of directors which is composed of \nmembers who broadly represent and who are knowledgeable about the needs of individuals with \nmental illness.  The Legal Center’s board of directors includes members who have received or \nare receiving mental health services or who have family members who have received or are \nreceiving mental health services. \n- 2 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 26\n5.  The Legal Center’s constituents include individuals with mental illness.  The \nLegal Center has established a PAIMI Advisory Council, over sixty percent (60%) of whose \nmembers themselves have received or are receiving mental health services or have family who \nhave received or are receiving mental health services.  The PAIMI Advisory Council advises the \nP&A System on the policies and priorities designed to protect and advocate for the rights of \nindividuals with mental illness.  The Chair of the Legal Center’s PAIMI Advisory Council, who \nis also a member of the Legal Center’s board of directors, has a family member who has received \nand is receiving mental health services. \n6.  Together, the Legal Center’s board of directors and PAIMI Advisory Council \nhave developed the annual priorities and objectives of the P&A System for individuals with \nmental illness.  The Legal Center’s first PAIMI Program Priority states that the Legal Center will \nmonitor facilities, including jails, and investigate complaints of abuse, neglect and rights \nviolations.  When the rights of its constituents—incapacitated individuals with mental illness—\nare violated, the Legal Center is authorized by statute to pursue legal remedies on their behalf, \nsuch as through this lawsuit.  42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(B) & (C).  To the extent the Legal Center \nexpends its resources to protect the rights of its constituents in county jails waiting for \ncompetency evaluations or restorative treatment, its resources are diverted away from other \npriorities of its constituents. \n7.  The Legal Center has established a grievance procedure for clients or prospective \nclients which allows its constituents with mental illness and family members of such individuals \nto assure them that the Legal Center and the PAIMI Program are operating in compliance with \nthe provisions of the PAIMI Act. \n- 3 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 26\n8.  The Legal Center’s constituents who are detained and charged with crimes are \nhindered from asserting their own rights.  Obstacles they face include the imminent mootness of \nindividual claims as individuals are likely to be admitted to CMHIP for restorative treatment \nduring the pendency of any case they might bring.  In addition, pretrial detainees who suffer \nfrom mental illness are often impaired and unable to direct or participate in litigation on their \nown behalf. \n9.  Defendant Reggie Bicha is sued in his official capacity as the Executive Director \nof the Colorado Department of Human Services.  The Department is responsible under Colorado \nlaw for the operation of CMHIP and the provision of mental health evaluations and treatment for \npersons with mental illness found incompetent to proceed to trial.    \n10.  Defendant Teresa A. Bernal is sued in her official capacity as the Interim \nSuperintendent of CMHIP.  CMHIP is the only state forensic mental hospital charged with  \nproviding court-ordered evaluations and accepting custody of pretrial detainees for restorative \ntreatment.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n1343(a)(3) because it arises under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201-02. \n12.  Venue is appropriate in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the \nevents giving rise to this Complaint occurred in this district. \n \n \n- 4 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 26\nALLEGATIONS \nA.  Colorado’s System to Evaluate the Competency of Criminal Defendants \n13.  Pretrial detainees are presumptively innocent because they have only been \ncharged with, but not convicted of, crimes.  They are constitutionally entitled to speedy trials, but \nColorado’s speedy trial statute excludes time spent to evaluate a detainee’s competency and to \nprovide restorative treatment from the computation of time within which a detainee must be \nbrought to trial under the speedy trial statute.  Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-1-405(6).  \n14.  Under the federal constitution and under Colorado law, the State cannot subject \nincompetent defendants to trial.  A defendant is incompetent if, as a result of a mental disability \nor developmental disability, the defendant does not have sufficient present ability to consult with \nthe defendant’s lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding in order to assist in the \ndefense.  Questions of a defendant’s competency can be raised by the trial judge, prosecution, or \ndefense.   \n15.  Once the question of a defendant’s competency to proceed has been raised, “the \ncourt may make a preliminary finding of competency or incompetency, which shall be a final \ndetermination unless a party to the case objects within ten days after the court’s preliminary \nfinding.”  Id. at 16-8.5-103(1).  When a party objects to the preliminary finding or “the court \ndetermines that it has insufficient information to make a preliminary finding, the court shall \norder that the defendant be evaluated for competency by the department and that the department \nprepare a court-ordered report.”  Id. at -103(2).  The “department” that is required to conduct the \ncompetency evaluation and prepare the competency report is the Colorado Department of Human \nServices. Id. at -101(8).  Then, a party may request a hearing or a second evaluation within ten \ndays from when the report is received.  Id. at -103(3).   “If neither party requests a hearing or a \n- 5 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 26\nsecond evaluation within the applicable time frame, the court shall enter a final determination, \nbased on the information then available to the court, whether the defendant is or is not competent \nto proceed.”  Id. at -103(5). \n16.  The location of competency evaluations is determined by the trial court.  \nDefendants eligible for bond may be released on bond for the evaluation, or the court may \ncommit the defendant to the custody of the Department for the evaluation or order that it be \nconducted in the jail where the defendant is being detained.  Id. at -105(1)(a).  A written report of \nthe evaluation must be prepared and delivered to the clerk of the court that ordered it.  The report \nmust include the name of each physician, psychologist, or other expert who examined the \ndefendant; a description of the nature, content, extent, and results of the evaluation and any tests \nconducted; a diagnosis and prognosis of the defendant’s mental disability or developmental \ndisability; and an opinion as to whether the defendant is competent to proceed.  Id. at -105(5).   \n17.  When a court orders a defendant committed to the custody of the Department for \na competency evaluation, that evaluation is conducted by CMHIP at its psychiatric hospital in \nPueblo.  If the court orders the competency evaluation to take place in the jail where the \ndefendant is detained, CMHIP hires contract evaluators to complete the evaluation.   \n18.  After receiving the competency evaluation, the court makes a final determination \nwhether the detainee is competent to proceed to trial.  Id. at -103(5).  If the final determination is \nthat the defendant is not competent to proceed, the court may release the defendant on bond on \nthe condition that he obtain treatment or habilitation services.  Id. at -111(2)(a).  If the court \ndetermines that the defendant is not eligible for release on bond, the court may commit the \ndefendant to the custody of the Department for restorative treatment.  Id. at -111(2)(b).  Once the \n- 6 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 26\ndefendant has been restored to competency, the defendant is returned to the custody of the \ncounty jail for the resumption of criminal proceedings against the defendant.  Id. \n19.  While a defendant is committed for restorative treatment, the court is required to \nreview the defendant’s case at least every three months “with regard to the probability that the \ndefendant will eventually be restored to competency and with regard to the justification for \ncontinued commitment or confinement.”  Id. at -116(2).  A defendant is entitled to credit for any \ntime spent in confinement for restorative treatment against any term of imprisonment imposed \nafter restoration to competency, and a defendant may not be confined for restorative treatment \nfor a period in excess of the maximum term of confinement that could be imposed for the offense \nwith which the defendant is charged.  Id. at -116(1).   \nB.  The Competency Evaluation System Is Plagued by Chronic Delays, Trapping \nPretrial Detainees Who Are Presumed Innocent in Procedural Limbo \n \n20.  Pretrial detainees in many, if not all, of Colorado’s jails are experiencing severe \ndelays—some as long as six months—in receiving court-ordered competency evaluations and, \nfor those determined not competent to proceed, for admission to CMHIP for restorative \ntreatment.  In some cases, the delays for evaluation and admission for restorative treatment have \nresulted in confinement of pretrial detainees for periods longer than they otherwise would have \nbeen confined for the alleged offense. \n21.  CMHIP currently maintains a wait list of pretrial detainees that have been ordered \nto receive restorative treatment at CMHIP and that it has not admitted.  There are more than 50 \npeople on the wait list, and there are numerous detainees with serious mental illness who are \nwaiting four, five, and even six months for admission to CHIP after they have been ordered to \n- 7 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 26\nreceive restorative treatment.  See Affidavit of Colorado State Public Defender Douglas K. \nWilson, attached hereto as Exhibit A. \n22.  For example, the Colorado Public Defender currently represents Client L.E.  L.E. \nwas detained in the Boulder County Jail.  On December 30, 2010, the Judge D. Archuleta, of the \nBoulder County District Court, ordered that L.E. be evaluated to determine his competency to \nproceed to trial.  L.E.’s evaluation occurred on January 28, 2011 at the Boulder County Jail, and \nthe written report of L.E.’s evaluation was filed with the court on February 7, 2011.  On \nFebruary 14, 2011, the court entered its determination that L.E. was not competent to proceed \nand that L.E. be transported to CMHIP for treatment and restoration.  L.E. was not transported to \nCMHIP until July 15, 2011, more than five months after the court ordered that he receive \nrestorative treatment.   \n23.  The Colorado Public Defender represents Client T.M.  On or about January 18, \n2011, Judge T. Quammen of the Weld County District Court ordered that T.M. be evaluated to \ndetermine T.M.’s competency to stand trial.  T.M.’s evaluation occurred on February 1, 2011 at \nthe Weld County Jail and the written report of T.M.’s evaluation was filed with the court on \nFebruary 14, 2011. On February 17, 2011, the court made its determination that T.M., who has a \nhistory of schizophrenia, is not competent to stand trial and ordered that T.M. be transported to \nCMHIP for treatment and restoration.  T.M. was admitted to CMHIP on August 15, 2011, six \nmonths following the court’s order that he be admitted to CMHIP for restorative treatment.   \n24.  The Colorado Public Defender represents Client P.E.  On January 31, 2011, Judge \nE. Rinaldi, of the Adams County District Court, ordered that P.E. be evaluated to determine \nP.E.’s competency to stand trial.  P.E.’s evaluation occurred on March 23, 2011 at the Adams \nCounty Jail, and the written report of P.E.’s evaluation was filed with the court on April 11, \n- 8 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 26\n2011. On April 29, 2011, the court made its determination that P.E. is not competent to stand \ntrial and ordered that P.E. be transported to CMHIP for treatment and restoration.  P.E. had not \nbeen transported to CMHIP by June 10, 2011, on which date the court held a review hearing and \nentered a second order that P.E. be transferred to CMHIP for treatment and restoration.  While \ndetained in the Adams County Jail, P.E. has been charged with additional offenses allegedly \ncommitted while in jail.  P.E. was admitted to CMHIP on July 13, 2011, two-and-a-half months \nfollowing the court’s order that he be admitted to CMHIP for restorative treatment.   \n25.  The Colorado Public Defender represents Client R.J.  On March 21, 2011, Judge \nJ. Romeo, of the Adams County District Court, ordered that R.J. be evaluated to determine R.J.’s \ncompetency to stand trial.  The Department did not conduct R.J.’s evaluation until June 30, 2011 \nat the Adams County Jail. The written report of R.J.’s evaluation was filed with the court on July \n5, 2011.  On July 26, 2011, the court made its determination that R.J. is not competent to stand \ntrial and ordered that R.J. be transported to CMHIP for treatment and restoration.  On July 26, \n2011, R.J’s attorney requested that R.J. be released on bond given the wait times for restoration. \nThe court, however, denied the request.  While awaiting transfer to CMHIP, R.J. has been \ncharged with an additional offense allegedly committed while in jail.  As of the date of this \nComplaint, more than five months following the order to evaluate R.J. for competency, and more \nthan a month following the court’s transportation order, R.J. remains in custody at the Adams \nCounty Jail and has not received any restorative treatment. \n26.  The Colorado Public Defender represents Client S.R.  On April 28, 2011, Judge \nR. Lowrey, of the El Paso County District Court, ordered that S.R. be evaluated to determine \nS.R.’s competency to stand trial.  S.R.’s evaluation occurred on June 13, 2011 at the El Paso \nCounty Jail and the written report of S.R.’s evaluation was filed with the court on July 1, 2011.  \n- 9 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 26\nOn July 7, 2011, the court made its determination that S.R. is not competent to stand trial and \nordered that S.R. be transported to CMHIP for treatment and restoration.  On July 28, 2011, Lori \nCarter, Observations/Admissions Administrator for the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry at \nCMHIP notified S.R.’s Deputy Public Defender, that S.R. would not be transported to CMHIP \nfor at least seven weeks because there were 55 people ahead of S.R. on CMHIP’s waiting list.  \nAs of the date of this Complaint, almost two months following the court’s order that he be \nadmitted to CMHIP, S.R. remains in custody at the El Paso County Jail and has not received any \nrestorative treatment. \n27.  Numerous other pretrial detainees have experienced or are currently experiencing \nsimilarly severe delays in receiving competency evaluations or in being admitted to CMHIP for \ntreatment and restoration.   \n28.  Data from a county sheriff’s office further demonstrates that delays for evaluation \nand admission for restorative treatment are severe and growing.  See Affidavit of Arapahoe \nCounty Sheriff J. Grayson Robinson, attached hereto as Exhibit B.  The Arapahoe County \nSheriff, who oversees the Arapahoe County Detention Facility, has witnessed the following \ndelays in 2010 and 2011.  In 2010, an average of 43 days elapsed between a court order for a \ncompetency evaluation and the provision of the evaluation in jail.  In 2011, the average has \nincreased to 51.6 days.  In one instance in 2011, it took 58 days—more than eight weeks—for a \ndetainee to receive a court-ordered competency evaluation. \n29.  The Arapahoe County Sheriff has also seen increases in delays for admission to \nCMHIP after a finding of incompetency.  In 2010, an average of 26.25 days elapsed between a \ncourt order for commitment of an incompetent detainee to CMHIP and admission to CMHIP.  In \n- 10 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 26\n2011, the average has increased to 32.5 days.  In one instance in 2011, it took 48 days—almost \nseven weeks—for a detainee to be admitted into CMHIP. \n30.  Statistics from the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office are set forth in the table \nbelow. \nArapahoe County Detention Facility Statistics \n  2010  2011 \n   \nAverage days from court-\n43  51.6 \nordered evaluation to conduct \nof evaluation in jail. \n \n   \nAverage days from court-\n31.9  54.5 \nordered evaluation to \nevaluation at CMHIP. \n \n   \nAverage days from court-\n26.25  32.5 \nordered commitment of \nincompetent detainees to \nCMHIP and admission to \nCMHIP. \n \n \nC.  The Delays Cause Detainees Severe Harm, Violate Their Constitutional Rights, and \nImpose Significant Burdens on Jails and Sheriff Departments \n \n31.  In late 2006, approximately 85 pretrial detainees all over the State of Colorado \nwere experiencing significant delays, up to six months, waiting for evaluation and transport to \nCMHIP.  In one instance, Judge M. Egelhoff of the Denver District Court, found the Department \nand CMHIP in contempt of his orders for competency evaluations or commitment for restorative \ntreatment of three individuals.  As a result of the contempt citations, and further proceedings, the \nDepartment and CMHIP entered into a settlement agreement with Special Counsel, which \nrequired them to admit pretrial detainees to CMHIP within 24 days of receipt of a court order for \n- 11 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 26\nevaluation or commitment.  This settlement agreement was commonly known as the “Zuniga” \nagreement.  The settlement agreement expired in June 2009 when CMHIP’s new 200-bed \nforensic facility was open for admission.  Unfortunately, this new facility was not enough to curb \nthe dire and growing violation of constitutional rights suffered by those once again waiting for \nmonths for admission to CMHIP for evaluation and treatment.  Beginning in January 2010, \npretrial detainees were once again waiting for significant periods to obtain evaluations and/or be \ntransported to CMHIP for restorative treatment.   \n32.    Pretrial detainees who wait months for evaluation and/or restorative treatment \nsuffer serious harm.  Jails can provide medication management for people willing to take \nmedications, but cannot administer medication involuntarily, except in a life-threatening \nemergency.  The psychological condition and behavior of incompetent detainees often \ndeteriorates rapidly when they do not receive necessary treatment. \n33.  None of the jails in Colorado are able to provide treatment designed to restore a \nperson found incompetent to proceed.   As a result, detainees who suffer from mental illness are \nunpredictable and disruptive, taking up valuable resources needed for the care of other inmates.   \n34.  The jails’ only system for controlling inmates is through disciplinary control, \nwhich is behavior driven.  Such a system is ineffective and harmful for persons with mental \nillness.  Unlike the county jails, CMHIP has the capacity to treat a person’s mental illness.  Each \nof the CMHIP units housing persons found incompetent to proceed is staffed by a full-time \npsychiatrist, psychologist, mental health nurses, social workers, mental health technicians, and \neven a recreational counselor. \n35.  In addition to assessment, medication evaluation and management, and individual \nand group psychotherapy, CMHIP provides legal skills training one to three times per week to \n- 12 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 26\nassist patients in learning about the law, pleas, and returning to court.  This treatment is designed \nto enable a person to regain fitness to participate in criminal proceedings. \n36.  Pretrial detainees with mental illness are a population that has a high suicide risk, \nand psychosis can be an emergency requiring immediate treatment. \n37.  Depriving persons with mental illness who are incompetent to proceed with the \nnecessary restorative treatment increases the likelihood that their condition will deteriorate and \nthey will suffer unduly.  The delays also hamper efforts to provide effective representation \nregarding their criminal prosecution. \n38.  Although the jails have the capacity to transport detainees to CMHIP more \nquickly, detainees cannot be transported until CMHIP agrees to admit them upon arrival.  If the \njails transport detainees before receiving notice from CMHIP that it will admit them, CMHIP \nwill refuse their admission.    \n39.  While pretrial detainees are in jail, they do not receive care giving them a realistic \nopportunity of becoming competent to stand trial. This failure of the Defendants to evaluate and \nadmit the pretrial detainees in a timely manner violates their due process rights.   \n40.  The resources of Sheriffs’ departments around Colorado are strained by the delays \nin evaluating pretrial detainees and admitting those not competent to proceed to CMHIP.  For \nexample, the average cost per day to house an inmate in the Arapahoe County Detention Facility \nis $68.30.  The average cost per day to house a detainee suffering from mental illness can be \ndouble that amount.  Sheriffs’ departments are incurring this increased cost more often than they \nshould because of the Defendants’ failure to promptly evaluate and admit detainees. \n \n \n- 13 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 26\nCAUSE OF ACTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the Due Process Clause  \nof the Fourteenth Amendment) \n \n41.  Plaintiff realleges each allegation above as if fully set forth herein. \n42.  Defendants, in their official capacities, act under color of Colorado law when they \nprovide, or fail to provide, detainees with timely court-ordered competency evaluations and \ntimely restorative mental health treatment. \n43.  Defendants Bicha and Bernal, in their official capacities, have failed to provide \nprompt competency evaluations and prompt admission to CMHIP of detainees determined to be \nincompetent. \n44.  There is an actual, present, and justiciable controversy between Plaintiff and \nDefendants over the severe delays caused by Defendants in providing court-ordered competency \nevaluations and in admitting pretrial detainees to CMHIP for court-ordered treatment and \nrestoration. \n45.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement bear reasonable \nrelation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n46.  Once a defendant is found unable to aid and assist in his own defense, the only \nlawful purpose for confinement is to treat the person in order to return them to competency. \n47.  Individuals found not competent to aid and assist in their defense have a \nconstitutional right to such individualized treatment as will give them a reasonable opportunity to \nbe cured or to improve their mental condition. \n48.  Colorado’s county jails do not have the structure, mission, expertise or resources \nto provide the restorative mental health treatment required by detainees who have been found not \ncompetent to proceed to trial.  There is no legitimate state interest in keeping pretrial detainees \n- 14 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 1   Filed 08/31/11   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 26\nwith mental illness incarcerated in county jails for weeks or months and depriving them of timely \nevaluations and restorative treatment. \n49.  “The United States Supreme Court has recognized that an individual has a liberty \ninterest in being free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction.” Or. Advocacy Ctr. v. \nMink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Oviatt ex rel. Waugh v. Pearce, 954 F.2d \n1470, 1474 (9th Cir. 1992)).  “Because incapacitated criminal defendants have not been \nconvicted of any crime, they have an interest in freedom from incarceration.  They also have a \nliberty interest in receiving restorative treatment.”  Id.  \n50.  Defendants actions and inactions result in confinement of pretrial detainees with \nmental illness that violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n51.  Plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment from this Court under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201-02 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 that (1) the current delays in Colorado for competency \nevaluations and admission to CMHIP of incompetent detainees violate the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, (2) competency evaluations must be completed and submitted to the \ncourt ordering them no later than 7 days after the court’s order, or within such other time that this \nCourt determines comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (3) \ndetainees found not competent to proceed to trial be admitted by CMHIP for restorative \ntreatment no later than 7 days following the court’s determination of incompetency, or within \nsuch other time that this Court determines comports with the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.

Wang \n  This matter comes before the court on Plaintiff Center for Legal Advocacy d/b/a Disability \nLaw Colorado’s (“DLC” or “Plaintiff”) Motion for Summary Judgment to Enforce Settlement \n(“Motion” or “Motion for Summary Judgment”) [#96] and Defendants Reggie Bicha and Jill \nMarshall’s (collectively, “Defendants” or “Department”) Motion for Summary Judgment (or \n“Motion”) [#97].  The Motions are before the undersigned pursuant to the Order of Reference \ndated February 21, 2012 [#44], the Order of Reassignment dated November 19, 2015 [#58], 28 \nU.S.C. § 636(c), Fed. R. Civ. P. 73, and D.C.COLO.LCivR 72.2.  The court retained ancillary \njurisdiction to consider the issues raised in the Parties’ Motions for Summary Judgment, because \nthe Parties’ consented to this court  retaining jurisdiction  to  enforce the terms of the 2016 \nSettlement  Agreement  and  the  court  fully  incorporated  the  terms  of  the  2016  Settlement \nAgreement in its Order of Dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nSee Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994).  Accordingly, having \nreviewed the Motions and associated briefing, and the evidence and comments offered at the \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 29\nSeptember 28, 2018 Motions Hearing, the court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment; DENIES Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment; \nand SETS this action for a Status Conference.   \nBACKGROUND \nThe court draws the following facts from the record before it, including the Parties’ Joint \nStatement of Undisputed Facts.  [#104].   \n1.  The Department is required to provide competency evaluations for any defendant \nwhen the issue of competency to stand trial is raised.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 16-8.5-101, et seq.  \n2.  The Department is required to provide restoration services for any defendant found by \nthe court to be incompetent to proceed.  See id. at §§ 16-8.5-101, et seq., 27-60-105. \n3.  In 2007, there were contempt citations issued in Denver District Court related to \npretrial detainees waiting extended periods of time in Denver County Jail.  See, e.g., Am. Contempt \nCitation, People v. Zuniga, No. 06CR999 (Colo. Dist. Ct. Jan. 3, 2007); Contempt Citation, People \nv. Kirkwood, No. 06CR5797 (Colo. Dist. Ct. Jan. 3, 2007); Am. Contempt Citation, People v. Sims, \nNo. 05CR2272 (Colo. Dist. Ct. Jan. 3, 2007) (collectively [#105-1]).  In 2006, Denver District \nCourt Judge Egelhoff appointed special counsel to litigate contempt citations against the Executive \nDirector of the Colorado Department of Human Services and the Superintendent of the Colorado \nMental Health Institute at Pueblo (“CMHIP”).  In those instances, pretrial detainees were sitting \nin jail for many months awaiting transport to CMHIP for competency evaluations.  The contempt \ncitations and orders were resolved through a settlement agreement.  The agreement required \nCMHIP to offer admission to pretrial detainees within 28 days of a court order requiring in-patient \ncompetency evaluations or restorative treatment, and to maintain a quarterly average of 24 days \nfor both categories. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 29\n4.  Some period after that settlement agreement expired, the Department and CMHIP \ndid not transport pretrial detainees to CMHIP for competency evaluation or restoration treatment \nwithin 28 days after they were ready for admission. \n5.  Plaintiff  initially  commenced  this  matter  on  August  31,  2011.    [#1].    The \ncomplaint alleged that Defendants failed to timely admit pretrial detainees in jails across Colorado \ninto CMHIP, the State’s only forensic mental health hospital charged with providing court-ordered \nevaluations and accepting custody of pretrial detainees for restorative treatment, for competency \nevaluations, and restorative treatment for those determined to be incompetent to stand trial.  Id.  \nThe  complaint  alleged  this  failure  created  unconstitutional  delays  to  provide  competency \nevaluations and treatment for up to 80 pretrial detainees for as long as six months.  Id. \n6.  In 2012, the parties entered into settlement negotiations to resolve issues related to \nthe length of the time individuals were waiting to receive competency evaluations and restoration \nservices. \n7.  After settlement negotiations mediated by former Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland, \nand post-mediation negotiations, the parties reached the 2012 Agreement resolving the case. \n8.  The 2012 Agreement put into place timeframes for the Department to: 1) complete \noutpatient  (in-jail)  competency  evaluations;  2)  offer  admission  for  inpatient  competency \nevaluations; and 3) offer admission for inpatient restoration services.  [#51-1; #105-15]. \n9.  The 2012 Agreement included a provision called Special Circumstances, which \n“recognizes that to some extent the Department’s ability to perform its statutory obligations and \nits obligations under [the 2012 Agreement] is based on factors beyond the Department’s control.” \n10.  The 2012 Agreement defines Departmental Special Circumstances (“DSC”) as: \n \ncircumstances  beyond  the  control  of  the  Department  which  impact the \n[Department’s] ability to comply with the timeframes set forth in Paragraph \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 29\n2.  This could mean an unanticipated spike in referrals, a  substantial  and \nmaterial  decrease  in  the  Hospital’s  budget,  or another  sentinel  event \nimpacting clinical decisions system wide.  These examples are provided for \nillustration only.  [DSC] is a flexible concept, due to the unique and often \nunforeseen nature of these events. \n \n11.  The 2012 Agreement states that: \n \nif [DSC] is invoked and then agreed upon by the parties, the timeframe \nrequirements of Paragraph 2 shall be suspended as to all Pretrial Detainees \naffected by the invoked [DSC] for a period of six months from the date of the \nDepartment’s invocation. \n \n12.  The 2012 Agreement states that: \n \nif the timeframe requirements of Paragraph 2 of [the 2012 Agreement] are \ntemporarily suspended pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 6(c), the \nduration of [the 2012 Agreement] shall be extended for a period equal to the \nlength of time of the suspension of the timeframe requirements…[and] then \nthe  Department  will receive  only  a  reduction  in  the  duration  for  the \nnumber of months it was in compliance for the year. \n \n13.  The 2012 Agreement states that “upon the first anniversary of the full execution of \n[the 2012 Agreement] and if the Department has fully complied with the terms of [the 2012 \nAgreement],” the duration of the 2012 Agreement would be reduced by one year. \n14.  Both parties certified that they fully and carefully reviewed the 2012 Agreement \nand consulted with their respective attorneys regarding the legal effect and meaning of the 2012 \nAgreement and all terms and conditions thereof. \n15.  The 2012 agreement was incorporated by reference in the Court’s Order of Dismissal \non April 9, 2012 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).  [#52]. \n16.  In August 2015, the Department invoked DSC. \n17.  In October 2015, the Plaintiff moved to reopen the matter for enforcement of the \n2012 agreement, in part because it disputed DSC.  [#53]. \n18.  After two days of mediation, engaging in subsequent settlement negotiations, and \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 29\nexchanging  multiple  drafts,  the  parties  entered  into  an  Amended  and  Restated  Settlement \nAgreement (“Settlement Agreement” or “2016 Agreement”) [#78-1] resolving the case. \n19.  The Settlement Agreement is the product of over three months and hundreds of hours \nof work by both parties.  The current 2016 Settlement Agreement was filed with the Court on July \n28, 2016.  [#78-1; #105-17]. \n20.  This Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  [#78 at ¶¶ 3, \n4; #105-16].    Under  the  2016  Settlement  Agreement,  the  Department  is  required  to  offer \nadmission to pretrial detainees to the hospital for restorative treatment or inpatient competency \nevaluations no later than 28 days after the pretrial detainee is ready for admission.    [#105-16 at \n¶ 2(a)].  The Department also must maintain a monthly average of 24 days or less for both types \nof offers of admission.  See id. \n21.  The 2016 Agreement  includes  a  provision  called  Special  Circumstances,  which \nrecognizes that “to some extent the Department’s ability to perform its statutory obligations and \nits obligations under [the Agreement] are based on factors beyond its control.” \n22.  The 2016 Agreement defines DSC as: \n \ncircumstances  beyond  the  control  of  the  Department  which  impact the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with the timeframes set forth in Paragraph 2.  \nThis could mean an unanticipated spike in referrals, a national or statewide \ndisaster impacting admissions decisions system wide.  These examples are \nprovided for illustration only. [DSC] is a flexible concept, due to the unique \nand often unforeseen nature of these events. \n \n23.  The 2016 Agreement states that: \n \nupon the invocation of [DSC], the timeframe requirements of Paragraph 2 \nshall be automatically suspended for six months, unless  the  Department \nnotifies [Disability Law Colorado] that a shorter period of time is sufficient \nto resolve [DSC], commencing with the month in which the Notice of [DSC] \nis transmitted to [Disability Law Colorado]. \n \n24.  The 2016 Agreement states that: \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 29\n \nif  the  timeframe  requirements  of  Paragraph  2  of  [the  Agreement]  are \ntemporarily suspended pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 6(c),  the \nduration of [the Agreement] shall be extended for a period equal to the length \nof time of the suspension of the timeframe requirements. \n \n25.  This language reflects a modification from the 2012 Agreement.  Id. \n \n26.  The 2016 Agreement states that: \n \nthe term of the Agreement shall be reduced by three months for each of the \nnumber of months of certified timeliness compliance for the prior  calendar \nyear…[and] the  term of  the  Agreement shall be increased by three months \nfor each month during the prior calendar year that the Department was not in \nfull compliance with the timeliness requirements of [the Agreement]. \n \n27.  Both parties certified that they fully and carefully reviewed the 2016 Agreement \nand consulted with their respective attorneys regarding the legal effect and meaning of the 2016 \nAgreement and all terms and conditions thereof. \n28.  The 2016 Settlement Agreement states that \n \n[t]he Hospital may invoke Individual Special Circumstances more than once \nfor  the  same  Pretrial  Detainee,  but  it  must  follow  the notification and \nconferral procedures in Paragraph 6(b) each time it seeks to invoke Individual \nSpecial Circumstances. \n \n[#105-15 at ¶ 6(b)(ii)].  The Settlement Agreement does not contain a similar provision for DSC.  \n[Id. at ¶ 6(c)]. \n29.  In June 2017, the Department invoked DSC based on “an unanticipated spike in \ncourt-ordered referrals for inpatient competency evaluation and restoration treatment services.” \n[#105-2 at 1]. \n30.  In December 2017, the Department invoked DSC.  [#105-3].  That DSC notice was \nbased  on  the  fact  that  “the  sustained  increase  in  the  number  of  court  orders  for  inpatient \ncompetency restoration treatment had outpaced the Department’s capacity and was beyond its \ncontrol.”  See [id. at 1–2]. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 29\n31.  The  December  2017  DSC  invocation,  the  validity  of  which  Plaintiff  disputes, \nwould have expired on June 22, 2018.   Id. \n32.  The  Department’s  invocation  of  DSC  in  both  June  2017  and  December  2017 \ncomplied with the 2016 Agreement’s notice requirements. \n33.  In June 2018, the Department did not invoke DSC.  \n34.  The  Department  has  not  complied  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes \nconcerning inpatient restoration treatment since June 2017. \n35.  The  Department  has  complied  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes \nconcerning outpatient competency evaluations since July 2015. \n36.  The  Department  has  complied  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes \nconcerning inpatient competency evaluations since May 2018. \n37.  The June 2018 “Best Referrals Per Month” report [#105-8] accurately states the \nnumber of orders for competency evaluation and restoration treatment services received by the \nDepartment from January 2017 through July 2018. \n38.

From July 2017 to July 2018, Defendants received 15 orders to show cause related to \ncompetency and restoration services at CMHIP and 44 orders for immediate placement at CMHIP.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 29\n[#105-5 (CORA Response)]. \n44.  In July 2018, Judge Jones of the Denver District Court issued an order requiring \nthe Department to admit a pretrial detainee who had been in jail waiting for restorative treatment \nfor months.  [#105-6 (Judge Jones order)].  \n45.  In another case, Judge Brody of the Denver District Court issued an order to show \ncause and contempt citation against Defendants.  [#105-7 (Judge Brody order)].  Judge Brody \nvacated the show cause order and contempt citation against Defendants on August 24, 2018. \n46.  [#105-4] is comprised of true and correct copies of 15 letters which the Department \nsent to state district court judges in April 2018 requesting that the judge convert the order for the \ndefendant  referenced  in  the letter to  receive inpatient  restoration  to  an  order  for outpatient \nrestoration services. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Pursuant to Rule 56, the court may grant summary judgment “if the movant shows that \nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “A dispute is genuine if there is sufficient evidence so that \na rational trier of fact could resolve the issue either way.  A fact is material if under the substantive \nlaw it is essential to the proper disposition of the claim.”  Crowe v. ADT Sec. Servs., Inc., 649 F.3d \n1189, 1194 (10th Cir. 2011) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  It is the movant’s \nburden to demonstrate that no genuine dispute of material fact exists for trial, whereas the \nnonmovant must set forth specific facts establishing a genuine issue for trial.  See Nahno-Lopez v. \nHouser, 625 F.3d 1279, 1283 (10th Cir. 2010).  And though the court will “view the factual record \nand draw all reasonable inferences therefrom most favorably to the nonmovant[,]” Zia Shadows, \nL.L.C. v. City of Las Cruces, 829 F.3d 1232, 1236 (10th Cir. 2016), the nonmovant must point to \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 29\ncompetent summary judgment evidence, see Bones v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 366 F.3d 869, 875 \n(10th Cir. 2004), and may not rely on “mere reargument of his case or a denial of an opponent’s \nallegation[,]” see 10B Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2738 at 356 \n(3d ed. 1998). \n  And when,  as here, the parties file cross-motions  for summary judgment,  the court \nconsiders each separately—the denial of one does not require the grant of another.  Buell Cabinet \nv. Sudduth, 608 F.2d 431, 433 (10th Cir. 1979).  Rather, the court may enter summary judgment \nonly if the moving party carries its burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact \nexists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Reed v. Bennett, 312 F.3d 1190, \n1194–95 (10th Cir. 2002).  \nANALYSIS \nAs currently postured by the Motions for Summary Judgment, the Parties stipulated to four \nissues for the court’s consideration:  \n1.  Whether the Settlement Agreement between the parties grants Defendants the right to \ninvoke “Departmental Special Circumstances” consecutively, without limitations; \n  \n2.  Whether Defendants breached the Settlement Agreement or whether the Defendants \nwere  in  non-compliance  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes,  when  they \nre-invoked “Departmental Special Circumstances” in December 2017, claiming it can \nconsecutively invoke Departmental Special Circumstances; \n \n3.  Whether Defendants breached the Settlement Agreement or whether the Defendants \nwere in non-compliance with the Settlement Agreement timeframes, on June 21, 2018 \nwhen they did not invoke “Department Special Circumstances”; and \n \n4.  If the Court finds Defendants either breached the Settlement Agreement or were in non-\ncompliance with the Settlement Agreement timeframes, the remedies that the Court \nshould impose. \n  \nSee [#88 at 2].  These issues present contract interpretation and breach of contract questions, \nrequiring the court to apply state contract law in addressing the “construction of a purported \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 29\nsettlement agreement[.]”  Walters v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 703 F.3d 1167, 1172 (10th Cir. 2013) \n(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).   \nIn Colorado, to recover for an alleged breach of contract a plaintiff must prove: (1) the \nexistence  of  a  contract;  (2)  the  plaintiff’s  performance  of  its  contractual  obligations  or  its \njustification(s) for non-performance; (3) the defendant’s failure to perform; and (4) the plaintiff’s \ndamages.  See Xtreme Coil Drilling Corp. v. Encana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc., 958 F. Supp. 2d 1238, \n1243 (D. Colo. 2013) (citing W. Distrib. Co. v. Diodosio, 841 P.2d 1053, 1058 (Colo. 1992)).  For \npurposes of issues 1 and 2, “[t]he interpretation of a contract under Colorado law is a legal \nquestion.”  Grant v. Pharmacia & Upjohn Co., 314 F.3d 488, 491 (10th Cir. 2002) (citing \nFibreglas Fabricators, Inc. v. Kylberg, 799 P.2d 371, 374 (Colo. 1990)) (further citation omitted).  \nIt is therefore appropriate at summary judgment for the court to interpret the terms of the 2016 \nSettlement Agreement.  See Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Fed. Ins. Co., 213 F. \nSupp. 3d 1333, 1340 (D. Colo. 2016) (applying Colorado law).  But “[o]nce the terms of the \nagreement have been identified, the fact finder must determine whether the party accused of \nbreaching has performed its obligations under the contract.  Whether a party has performed its \nobligations under a contract or breached is a question of fact.”  Lake Durango Water Co. v. Pub. \nUtilities Comm’n of State of Colorado, 67 P.3d 12, 21 (Colo. 2003) (emphasis added). \nWith this framework in mind, the court turns to the issues presented by the Parties. \nI.  Departmental Special Circumstances \nPer  the  2016  Settlement  Agreement,  Defendants  agreed  to  certain  timeframes  for \nadmissions for restorative treatment and the performance of competency evaluations.  See [#78-1 \nat ¶ 2].  These timeframes include admission “no later than 28 days after the Pretrial Detainee is \nReady for Admission, [i.e., when CMHIP receives the court order for admission and collateral \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 29\nmaterials],” and a monthly average of “24 days or less for both types of Offers of Admission.”  [Id. \nat ¶ 2(a)].  There is no dispute between the Parties, or before this court, that Defendants have not \ncomplied with the timeframes concerning inpatient restoration treatment since June 2017, though \ncomplying with the timeframes concerning outpatient competency evaluations since July 2015, \nsee [#104 at ¶¶ 34–35], and have only come into compliance with the timeframes concerning \ninpatient competency evaluations beginning in May 2018, see [id. at ¶ 36].  But the parties \nrecognized that factors beyond Defendants’ control might interfere with their ability to meet these \nrequired timeframes, so the 2016 Settlement Agreement provides for two categories of special \ncircumstances that temporarily suspend the required timeframes.  See [#78-1 at ¶ 6].   \nRelevant here, DSC \nMeans circumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with the timeframes set forth in Paragraph 2. This \ncould mean an unanticipated spike in referrals, a national or statewide disaster \nimpacting admissions decisions system wide. These examples are provided for \nillustration only. [DSC] is a flexible concept, due to the unique and often unforeseen \nnature of these events.  \n \n[#78-1 at ¶ 6(a)(ii)].  When invoking DSC, the Department \nshall notify DLC. . ., and . . . the Department shall provide a detailed explanation \nof the basis for invoking [DSC], a plan to remedy the [DSC], and the projected \ntimeframe for resolution. The period of [DSC] shall commence on the date that the \nNotice . . . is transmitted to DLC. Upon invocation of [DSC], the timeframe \nrequirements of Paragraph 2 shall be automatically suspended for six months, \nunless the Department notifies DLC that a shorter time period is sufficient . . ., \ncommencing with the month in which the Notice . . . is transmitted to DLC. . . . If \nDLC decides to challenge the invocation of [DSC], it may do so by filing a motion \nto reopen the Action to seek enforcement of this Agreement. . . .  \n \n[Id. at ¶ 6(c)].     \n            \nA.  Consecutive Invocations \nTo answer the first issue presented by the Parties, the court “‘must examine [the 2016 \nSettlement Agreement’s] terms and attempt to determine the intent of the parties.’”  Level 3 \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 29\nCommc’ns, LLC v. Liebert Corp., 535 F.3d 1146, 1154 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting East Ridge of \nFort Collins, LLC v. Larimer & Weld Irrigation Co., 109 P.3d 969, 973 (Colo. 2005)).  In \ndeciphering the parties’ intent, “the instrument’s language must be examined and construed in \nharmony with the plain and generally accepted meaning of the words used.”  Leprino Foods Co. \nv. Factory Mut. Ins. Co., 653 F.3d 1121, 1127 (10th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted) \n(applying Colorado law).  “When a contractual term unambiguously resolves the parties’ dispute, \nthe interpreting court’s task is over” because the court is to enforce a written contract pursuant to \nits clear terms.  See Stroh Ranch Dev., LLC v. Cherry Creek S. Metro. Dist. No. 2, 935 F. Supp. 2d \n1052, 1060 (D. Colo. 2013) (quotation marks omitted) (applying Colorado law).  If, however, the \ncontractual terms are ambiguous, i.e., susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the \ncourt may consider extraneous evidence to determine the parties’ intent; but the mere difference \nof opinion regarding the interpretation of a term does not itself create an ambiguity.  See Running \nFoxes Petroleum, Inc. v. Nighthawk Prod. LLC, 175 F. Supp. 3d 1279, 1279, 1287 (D. Colo. 2016) \n(citing Ad Two, Inc. v. City & Cty. of Denver, 9 P.3d 373, 376–77 (Colo. 2000)).  \nAll  agree  that  the  language  of  Paragraph  6(a)(ii)  is  clear:  upon  proper  Notice,  the \nDepartment may invoke DSC, thereby suspending the required timeframes of Paragraph 2(a) for \nup to 6 months beginning with the month in which the Department transmits Notice.  Equally as \nclear is the absence of any language within the provisions themselves qualifying the Department’s \nability to invoke DSC.  The Parties offer opposing interpretations of what this silence means.  \nPlaintiff contends that this silence prohibits Defendants from invoking DSC “consecutively, \nwithout limitations” (though clarifying at the Motions Hearing that Defendant could invoke DSC \nmore than once, non-consecutively after coming into compliance with the Agreement following a \nprior invocation of DSC) because doing so would foster infinite suspensions of the relevant \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 29\ntimeframes, rendering the 2016 Settlement Agreement a “dead letter.”  Defendants counter that \nbecause the plain language of the 2016 Settlement Agreement does not prohibit consecutive \ninvocations of DSC, the court should not and cannot supply a term neither party bargained for.  \nDespite the court’s concern that consecutive invocations of DSC could simply result in infinite \nextensions, I respectfully agree with Defendants.  \nAs mentioned, “[t]o determine the meaning of a contract, courts are guided by the general \nrules of contract construction and should seek to give effect to all provisions so that none will be \nrendered meaningless.”  Chandler-McPhail v. Duffey, 194 P.3d 434, 437 (Colo. App. 2008).  That \nis, “the meaning of a contract is found by examination of the entire instrument and not by viewing \nclauses or phrases in isolation” so as to harmonize all provisions.  Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Fisher, \n292 P.3d 934, 937 (Colo. 2013) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  But courts \n“should neither rewrite the agreement nor limit its effect by a strained construction” when its terms \nare clear, SOLIDFX, LLC v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc., 841 F.3d 827, 833 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (applying Colorado law), because “it is not the business of the courts to \ndraft a better contract for the parties than they did for themselves[,]” id. at 836.  Indeed, contracts \nbetween “competent parties, voluntarily and fairly made, should be enforceable according to the \nterms to which they freely commit themselves[,]” including “mutually bargained-for duties and \nrisks.”  Ravenstar, LLC v. One Ski Hill Place, LLC, 401 P.3d 552, 555 (Colo. 2017) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \nPlaintiff offers several reasons as to why the 2016 Settlement Agreement limits the \nDepartment’s ability to invoke DSC consecutively.  First, consecutive invocation of DSC would \nrender meaningless the timeframes prescribed by Paragraph 2 because the Department could \n“serially re-invoke DSC every six months in perpetuity and never come back into compliance.”  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 29\n[#96 at 7]; see also [#101 at 9–10].  Second, and relatedly, consecutive invocation of DSC “would \neliminate the three-month extension provision” contained in Paragraph 4(b) that extends the term \nof the 2016 Settlement Agreement three months for every one month of noncompliance in the prior \ncalendar year.  See [#96 at 7; #101 at 10].  While these are troubling possibilities that the court \nnoted at the Motions Hearing, the 2016 Settlement Agreement provides mechanisms to protect the \ntimeframes in Paragraph 2 and the extensions to the 2016 Settlement Agreement’s lifespan in \nParagraph 4(b).  Most notably, the 2016 Settlement Agreement unequivocally provides Plaintiff \nthe right “to challenge the invocation of [DSC] . . . by filing a motion to reopen the Action to seek \nenforcement of this Agreement.”  [#78-1 at ¶ 6(c)].  This is exactly what Plaintiff did here.  And \nwhile Defendants dispute whether the stipulated issues between the Parties encompass this point, \nPlaintiff indeed challenges whether unanticipated spikes in referrals is a sufficient basis for \ninvoking DSC.   \nThird, Plaintiff argues that consecutive invocation of DSC would be at odds with the \nprovision  concerning  Individual  Special  Circumstances  that  “expressly  permit[s]  successive \ninvocations  of  Individual  Special  Circumstances”;  because  DSC  omits  this  same  language, \nPlaintiff argues that the court cannot reasonably interpret DSC to allow for consecutive invocation.  \n[#96 at 7–8; #101 at 9–10].  While it is correct that the court must not read provisions in isolation \nand must harmonize all provisions, I find that these two provisions cover distinct performance \nobligations, defined by discrete circumstances—one directed at the macro-level consideration of \nthe Department and the other directed at the micro-level consideration of an individual.  [#102 at \n8].  That is, accepting Plaintiff’s interpretation would insert a qualification on DSC that the 2016 \nSettlement Agreement does not expressly provide.  See Magnetic Copy Servs., Inc. v. Seismic \nSpecialists, Inc., 805 P.2d 1161, 1164 (Colo. App. 1990) (“The contract does not state that \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 29\n[defendant]’s performance was conditioned upon any set of circumstances.  Furthermore, the \ncontract does not state or imply that providing 3,000 tapes within a year is merely a goal or \nobjective.  Hence, we will not read the contract as so stating.”).  Had Plaintiff sought to further \nrestrict the manner by which the Department could invoke DSC it “could have and should have \ndone so expressly.”  Feerer v. Amoco Prod. Co., 242 F.3d 1259, 1264 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding \nunder New Mexico law that nothing in the settlement agreement supported the defendants’ position \non reallocating costs to the plaintiffs where no such provision allowed for this and this did not \nappear to be the parties’ intent).1   \nMoreover, Plaintiff’s argument runs counter to its clarification at the Motions Hearing that \nDefendants could  invoke DSC more than once during the lifespan of the 2016 Settlement \nAgreement but only after coming into compliance with Paragraph 2 following a prior invocation \nof DSC.  But this interpretation of DSC does not necessarily follow from the plain language of \nIndividual Special Circumstances that allows the Department to invoke “more than once for the \nsame Pretrial Detainee”, see [#78-1 at ¶ 6(b)(ii)], which Plaintiff interprets as allowing consecutive \ninvocation.  Indeed, if the Parties’ intent was to allow for multiple invocations of both Individual \nSpecial Circumstances and DSC, then the absence of the same language in the DSC provision has \nno effect on that understanding.  And the absence of explicit language limiting the invocation of \nDSC counsels against an interpretation that limits the Department’s ability in this regard based on \nPlaintiff’s interpretation of Individual Special Circumstances.             \n                                                           \n1 In the realm of statutory interpretation, it is axiomatic that “[w]here Congress includes particular \nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally \npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”  \nElwell v. Oklahoma ex rel. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, 693 F.3d 1303, 1309 (10th Cir. \n2012).  But it is far from clear that the same is true of contractual interpretation, especially where, \nas  here,  the  omission  of  certain  language  would  qualify  conduct  that  the  2016  Settlement \nAgreement does not explicitly restrict.  See Magnetic Copy Servs., Inc., 805 P.2d at 1164.     \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 29\nFinally, Plaintiff argues that at the least, permitting consecutive invocation of DSC would \nbreach Defendants’ duty of good faith and fair dealing.  [#96 at 8; #101 at 10].  “Every contract \nimposes upon each party  a duty of  good faith and fair dealing in  its performance  and its \nenforcement.”  See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 205.  In Colorado, this \nduty exists “to effectuate the intentions of the parties or to honor their reasonable expectations[,]”  \nand may be invoked “when the manner of performance under a specific contract term allows for \ndiscretion on the part of either party[,]” i.e., one party has the power to set or control the terms of \nperformance after formation.  See City of Golden v. Parker, 138 P.3d 285, 292 (Colo. 2006) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  The 2016 Settlement Agreement, specifically \nParagraph 2, does not provide discretion to Defendants as to their performance obligations; nor \ndoes it appear that Defendants could dictate their performance obligations after formation.  Further, \nthe duty of good faith and fair dealing, if raised as to the Department’s ability to invoke DSC, \ncannot “contradict terms or conditions for which a party has bargained.”  Amoco Oil Co. v. Ervin, \n908 P.2d 493, 498 (Colo. 1995).  As discussed above, Plaintiff’s interpretation of Paragraphs \n6(a)(ii) and 6(c) as limiting the Department’s ability to invoke DSC consecutively interjects a new \nsubstantive term into the 2016 Settlement Agreement that would “vary or contradict the contract’s \nexpress provisions.”  United States for use & benefit of Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. v. Kirkland \nConstr., LLP, 76 F. Supp. 3d 1199, 1215 (D. Colo. 2014) (applying Colorado law).  Thus, to the \nextent that Plaintiff contends that the second, consecutive invocation of DSC breached the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing [#96 at 8], this court respectfully disagrees.  \nTo conclude, Plaintiff asks this court to read into the 2016 Settlement Agreement a \nrestriction on the Department’s ability to invoke DSC consecutively—a restriction the Agreement \ndoes  not  express.    Because  I  find  the  terms  of  the  2016  Settlement  Agreement  clear  and \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 29\nunambiguous, I conclude that a reasonable interpretation of Paragraphs 6(a)(ii) and 6(c) permits \nDefendants to invoke DSC consecutively.  This conclusion, however, does not completely resolve \nthe matter before the court.  Indeed, even the Parties framed the first issue as “[w]hether the \nSettlement Agreement between the parties grants Defendants the right to invoke ‘Departmental \nSpecial Circumstances’ consecutively, without limitations.”  Based on the arguments in the papers, \nthe Parties appear to approach the qualifier of “without limitations” as a numeric one.  But far \nmore salient to this court is that the issue clearly underlying the original action, the 2016 Settlement \nAgreement,  and  this  action  is  a  non-numeric  one.    This  court  has  already  concluded  that \nDefendants can invoke DSC consecutively, but it does not conclude that Defendants’ ability to \ninvoke DSC consecutively is without limitations.  The 2016 Settlement Agreement expressly limits \nthe invocation of DSC to “circumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with the timeframes set forth in Paragraph 2.”  [#78-1 at ¶ 6(a)(ii)].  \nB.  Limitations on the Invocation of DSC \nAs posed, the second issue presented to the court is: \nWhether  Defendants  breached  the  Settlement  Agreement  or  whether  the \nDefendants were in non-compliance with the Settlement Agreement timeframes, \nwhen they re-invoked “Departmental Special Circumstances” in December 2017, \nclaiming it can consecutively invoke Departmental Special Circumstances. \nIt is clear to this court that the central issue of dispute, and the question that is far harder to answer, \nis whether Defendants rightfully invoked DSC in June 2017 and then extended it in December \n2017 even if the Agreement allowed Defendants to invoke DSC consecutively.  Put another way, \nwere there “circumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact the Department’s \nability to comply with the timeframes set forth in [the Settlement Agreement]?”  See [#78-1 at \n¶ 6(a)(ii)].  At oral argument, counsel for Defendants argued that this substantive issue was not \nbefore the court, as the only basis for breach argued by Plaintiff was the consecutive invocation of \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 29\nDSC.  But in Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment it clearly argues that the invocations of \nDSC “did not satisfy the basic DSC requirements.”  [#96 at 9].  And Defendants argued, in \nResponse, that their invocations of DSC were proper, because they were substantively “outside the \ncontrol of the Department.”  [#102 at 12–15].  And upon Reply, Plaintiff continues to challenge \nwhether the DSC invocation was justified under the standard set forth in the 2016 Settlement \nAgreement.  [#101 at 10–11].  Even if the Parties did not expressly articulate this issue as one of \nthe four presented to the court for resolution, all Parties clearly had notice and argued the issue.  \nFurthermore, Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contemplates that a court may \nrender a determination as to summary judgment independent of the Parties’ motions.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(f).  And the 2016 Settlement Agreement clearly contemplates that Plaintiff may substantively \nchallenge the invocation of DSC.  [#78-1 at ¶ 6(c)]. \nBut the issue of whether the Department properly invoked DSC, first in June 2017 and then \nagain in December 2017, is not undisputed.  Rather, it is rife with disputes of material fact, and no \ndiscovery  on  these  issues  has  occurred.    Plaintiff  contends  that  the  basis  of  Defendants’ \ninvocation—the lack of capacity  caused by an increase in  referrals—“is wholly within the \nDepartment’s control.”  [#96 at 9].  And it insists that “the Department’s failure to maintain \nadequate facilities to keep up with the pace of referrals is a problem that has plagued timely \nadmission of pretrial detainees to CMHIP for decades.”  [Id.].  Indeed, Plaintiff suggests that the \ndemand for the Department’s mental health evaluations, including both the inpatient restorations \nand evaluations, shows that monthly totals have dropped, rather than increased, in the time period \nat issue.  [Id. at 10].   \nFor their part, Defendants argue that the invocation of DSC complies with the terms of the \n2016 Settlement  Agreement.   [#102 at  11–13].  They insist  that an unanticipated spike in \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 29\ncourt-ordered referrals for inpatient competency and restoration treatment services caused it to \ninvoke DSC, and that those spikes in demand are out of its control.  [Id.].  But Defendants never \nexplain, and rather simply assume, that the increase in court-ordered restoration services and \nevaluations necessarily renders the Department unable to comply with the timeframes set forth in \nthe 2016 Settlement Agreement.  [#102 at 14–15].  And contrary to Defendants’ contention that \nDLC “does not dispute whether the Department had the resources to manage the elevated volume \nof orders when it invoked DSC in December 2017,” [id. at 14], DLC does appear to dispute that \nvery conclusion in addition to challenging whether the Department has adequately planned for \nsuch foreseeable increases.  [#101 at 11].  This material dispute of fact precludes summary \njudgment in any party’s favor as to whether Defendants have breached the 2016 Settlement \nAgreement by their invocations of DSC in June and December 2017.2 \nC.  Failure to Invoke DSC \nThe third issue raised by the Parties is whether Defendants are in breach of the Settlement \nAgreement as of June 22, 2018, when the Department continued its noncompliance with the \n                                                           \n2 The court is keenly aware that the separation of powers doctrine counsels against a court’s review \nof an executive agency’s exercise of powers properly within its own sphere.  See, e.g., Kort v. \nHufnagel, 729 P.2d 370 (Colo. 1986) (en banc).  And the court is generally wary of passing over \nthe manner by which an agency allocates it limited resources, seeks funding from the Legislature, \nand explores alternatives to address budgetary shortfalls.  Here, however, that review appears \nintertwined with the contractual provisions that require the Department to invoke DSC based only \non “circumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact the Department’s ability to \ncomply with the timeframes.”  To determine whether a circumstance is “beyond the control of the \nDepartment which impacts its ability to comply with the timeframe,” the court cannot look only at \nwhether the triggering event is beyond the control of the Department, but must consider the totality \nof the circumstances, including the Department’s actions or inactions to address trends in demand \nfor mental health evaluations and restoration services.  For instance, the court would not consider \na spike in the number of court-ordered services as a circumstance “outside the control of the \nDepartment which impacts the Department’s ability to comply with the timeframes,” if the facts \ndemonstrate the Department was aware of the increasing trend in demand for mental health \nevaluations and restoration services but failed to take reasonable steps to address the rising needs. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 29\ntimeframes contemplated by the 2016 Settlement Agreement but did not invoke DSC.  Plaintiff \nargues that the Department may not simply choose not to comply with the timeframes of the 2016 \nSettlement Agreement without cause.  [#101 at 11].  Defendants argue that their failure to satisfy \nthe timeframes does not require the invocation of DSC, does not amount to breach, and simply \nresults in the increased duration of the 2016 Settlement Agreement by three months for each month \nthat the Department is not in full compliance.  [#97 at 21 (citing #78-1 at ¶ 4(b))].  Plaintiff \ncontends that Defendants’ interpretation of the 2016 Settlement Agreement is “absurd.”  [#101 at \n11–12].  As urged by Defendants, this court’s inquiry begins and end by applying the plain \nlanguage of the Agreement.  [#97 at 21]. \nIn applying the general principles of contract law, this court finds that the issue of whether \nDefendants breached the 2016 Settlement Agreement is distinct from the remedies available to \naddress such breach.  To prevail on summary judgment as to breach, Plaintiff must demonstrate \nthat there is no genuine issue of material fact that: (1) a contract exists; (2) plaintiff performed its \ncontractual obligations or its non-performance was justified; (3) the defendant failed to perform; \nand (4) the plaintiff suffered damages.   \nFirst, there is no material factual dispute that a contract exists, i.e., the 2016 Settlement \nAgreement.  Second, I respectfully disagree with Defendants that DLC has not demonstrated that \nit has performed its duties under the Agreement because it “refuses to comply with those contract \nterms” that suspend the timeframe obligations when the Department invokes DSC.  [#97 at 18–\n19].  There is no contractual term that DLC simply has to accept the Department’s invocation of \nDSC and thereby “comply” with the extensions of time to the overall Agreement.  Indeed, as \npointed out by Plaintiff, the 2016 Settlement Agreement specifically reserves and contemplates \nthat DLC may challenge the Department’s invocation of DSC if the Parties are unable to reach a \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 29\nresolution as to any disagreement.  [#78-1 at ¶ 6(c)].  And even without that term, the court finds \nno law, either statutory or common law, which suggests that a plaintiff’s good faith allegations of \ncontractual breach somehow transforms into a failure to perform its contractual obligations that \nthen obviates its ability to prove breach.  Therefore, I conclude that there is no material dispute \nthat DLC has performed its contractual obligation under the 2016 Settlement Agreement. \nThird, the court considers whether Defendants failed to perform under the 2016 Settlement \nAgreement as of June 2018.  Defendants argue that “for the same reasons discussed above, the \nDepartment’s inability to meet the Agreement’s timeframes in June 2018 does not amount to \nbreach.”  [#97 at 21].  I respectfully disagree.  As an initial matter, due to the factual disputes as \ndiscussed above, the court cannot conclude at this juncture that Defendants’ invocation of DSC in \neither or both June and December 2017 was proper under the 2016 Settlement Agreement.  See \nsupra, pp. 20–22.  Therefore, the issue of breach has not been resolved in Defendants’ favor.  \nEqually as significant, the 2016 Settlement Agreement does not contemplate that Defendants can \nsimply ignore the timeframes to which they agreed without breaching the Agreement.  The contract \nis clear that a proper invocation of DSC temporarily suspends the timeframe requirements of \nParagraph 2 of the Agreement, thereby precluding a finding of breach based on failure to satisfy \nthe timeframe requirements.  [#78-1 at ¶ 4(c)].  But nothing in the Agreement suggests that the \nDepartment can simply decline to comply with the timeframes to which it is contractually bound \nin Paragraph 2 with the only consequence being the extension of the Agreement’s duration for \nthree months.  [#97 at 21].  If that were the case, there would be no need for Defendants to ever \ninvoke DSC or justify the Department’s inability to comply with the timeframes to which it \nknowingly and voluntarily agreed.  [#78-1 at ¶ 15]. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 29\nThe Parties agree that the Department has complied with the timeframes concerning \ninpatient competency evaluations since May 2018.  [#104 at ¶ 36]. The Parties further agree that \nthe Department has complied with the timeframes concerning outpatient competency evaluations \nsince July 2015.  [Id. at ¶ 35].  But there is no dispute that since June 2017, Defendants have failed \nto maintain a 24-day monthly average for inpatient restorative treatment.  [Id. at ¶¶ 34, 38].  And \nthere is also no dispute that the Department did not invoke DSC as of June 2018.  [Id. at ¶ 33].  \nFinally, Defendants identify no other provision of the 2016 Settlement Agreement or other \ncircumstance  that  excuses  them  from  maintaining  a  24-day  monthly  average  for  inpatient \nrestorative treatment.  Therefore, this court concludes that the undisputed facts before it establish \nthat Defendants have failed to perform under the 2016 Settlement Agreement as of June 2018 \ngiven their failure to maintain a 24-day monthly average for inpatent restorative treatment. \nFinally, the court considers whether DLC suffered damages.  Defendants do not argue that \nthe individuals who DLC represents have not suffered damages.  Plaintiff argues that Defendants \nhave “violated the constitutional rights of everyone of these detainees by their failure to timely \nadmit and treat them,” [#101 at 2], and provides examples of the harms suffered by these \nindividuals.  Therefore, this court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact that \nDLC has suffered damages, and that as of June 2018, Defendants are in breach of the 2016 \nSettlement Agreement. \nII.  Appropriate Remedies \nHaving found breach, this court turns to the fourth issue identified by the Parties: the \nremedies that the court should impose.  Defendants argue that the sole remedy for their breach of \nthe timeframes for inpatient restoration is “the extension of the Agreement by three months for \neach month during the prior calendar year that the Department was not in full compliance with the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 29\ntimeliness requirement of this Agreement.”  [#78-1 at ¶ 4(b)].  Plaintiff argues that the extension \nof the 2016 Settlement Agreement is not the exclusive remedy for Defendants’ breach of contract \nbecause the contract does not explicitly limit relief to this exclusive remedy.  [#101 at 12].  In \naddition, Plaintiff urges this court to order immediate compliance upon pain of contempt and \nattorney’s fees and costs.  [#101 at 13–15]. \nA.  Specific Performance \nTo the extent that Defendants argue that the only remedy available to Plaintiff is the \nextension of the 2016 Settlement Agreement under Paragraph 4(c), this court respectfully rejects \nthat argument.  It is clear that under Colorado law, specific performance is an equitable remedy \nfor breach of contract.  Wheat Ridge Urban Renewal Auth. v. Cornerstone Grp. XXII, L.L.C., 176 \nP.3d 737, 740 (Colo. 2007) (citing Setchell v. Dellacroce, 169 Colo. 212, 216, 454 P.2d 804, 806 \n(1969)).  Here, Defendants do not raise any sovereign immunity concerns about the court’s \nauthority to order specific performance of the 2016 Settlement Agreement against a state agency, \nand in fact it appears expressly waived by Defendants’ agreement that DLC may seek enforcement \nof the Agreement.  [#78-1 at ¶ 6(c)].  In addition, while the extension of the contract by three \nmonths for each month the Department is out of compliance is a remedy, it is not the exclusive \nrelief that Plaintiff may seek.  The contract does not limit Plaintiff’s ability to enforce the 2016 \nSettlement Agreement only as to enforcing the extension of its duration; indeed, the court declines \nto read such a limitation into the 2016 Settlement Agreement when the Parties have failed to \nexpressly contract for it. \nBut while the court finds that injunctive relief is appropriate to bring Defendants into \ncompliance with the timeframe requirements for inpatient restoration of 28 days for any individual \nand a 24-day monthly average, it is not clear based on the record before the court that an order \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 29\nmandating immediate compliance is feasible or just.  The court notes that it is troubled by the fact \nthat the Department  has not  complied with  the timeframes  concerning inpatient restoration \ntreatment for almost eighteen months.  [#104 at ¶¶34–37].  But the vast majority of the time at \nissue, i.e., June 2017 to June 2018, is covered by the Department’s invocation of DSC—the \npropriety of which is vigorously contested and yet resolved.  And whether the Department’s \ninvocation of DSC was proper weighs heavily in the court’s consideration of what injunctive relief \nis necessary and what time Defendants would be provided to come into compliance.3   \nTherefore, while the court finds Defendants in breach of the 2016 Settlement Agreement \nfor their failure to meet the timeframes for inpatient restoration services after June 2018, it declines \nto enter an order for injunctive relief at this time.  Instead, the court ORDERS that the Parties be \nprepared to address an expedited schedule on the issue of whether DSC was properly invoked in \nJune 2017 and December 2017 at the forthcoming Status Conference with the understanding that \nthis court is inclined to permit Defendants no more than six months (and perhaps far less) from the \ndate of any Order disposing of the issue to come back into compliance. \nB.  Attorney’s Fees and Costs \nPlaintiff also seeks attorney’s fees and costs associated with reopening of this action and \nthe enforcement of the 2016 Settlement Agreement under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988.  [#96 at \n                                                           \n3 The court nevertheless notes that the 2016 Settlement Agreement contemplates that even in the \ncase of a proper invocation of DSC, Defendants are required to “provide a detailed explanation of \nthe basis for invoking Departmental Special Circumstances, a plan to remedy the Departmental \nSpecial Circumstance, and the projected timeframe for resolution.”  [#78-1 at ¶ 6(c)].  Defendants’ \nNotices of Invocation of Department Special Circumstances do not identify a projected timeframe \nfor resolution.  [#96-2; #96-3].  And based on the record before the court, it is not clear that the \nDepartment has, in any substantive and meaningful way, “provided regular updates agreed upon \nby the Parties concerning the multi-facted strategies outlined” in the December 2017 Notice.  [#96-\n3 at 8].  Indeed, the lack of invocation of DSC in June 2018 coupled with the lack of a timeframe \nfor remediation to address the extended timeframes for inpatient restoration suggests that a \ncourt-imposed deadline may be necessary to break the inertia of the circumstances. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 29\n15].  But these Motions do not arise arise under those civil rights statutes, because the claim at \nissue now is a state contract claim reserved to the court by its own Order retaining jurisdiction.  \n[#52 at ¶ 4; #80 at ¶ 4].  The 2016 Settlement Agreement also has no separate provision that \ncontemplates attorney’s fees and costs in conjunction with a motion to enforce.  See generally \n[#78-1].  \nColorado applies the “American Rule,” which requires each party in a lawsuit to bear its \nown legal expenses and, “thus, in the absence of an express statute, court rule, or contractual \nprovision to the contrary, attorney fees generally are not recoverable by the prevailing party in a \ncontract or tort action.”  First Citizens Bank & Tr. Co. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 320 P.3d 406, \n413 (Colo. App. 2014).  A narrow exception to the American Rule allows a trial court to award \nattorney’s fees when a party’s opponent acts in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive \nreasons.  See United states v. McCall, 235 F.3d 1211, 1216 (10th Cir. 2000).  Here there has been \nno finding of bad faith to date to justify the award of attorney’s fees.  Accordingly, I find that a \nruling on attorney’s fees and costs is premature, and I defer ruling on any request for attorney’s \nfees and the appropriate amount of any such fees until the court completes its adjudication of the \nenforcement of the 2016 Settlement Agreement. \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the court hereby ORDERS that:  \n(1)  Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment [#96] is GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART;  \n(2)  Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment [#97] is DENIED; and  \n(3)  A Status Conference is SET for November 30, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. to discuss any \ndiscovery and to set an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the DSC was \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 113   Filed 11/09/18   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 29\nproperly invoked in June 2017 and December 2017, so that the court can rule upon \na forthcoming motion to enforce and to determine the appropriate scope and terms \nof  an  injunction  going  forward  to  address  the  Department’s  performance  of \ninpatient restoration services. \n \nDATED:  November 9, 2018         BY THE COURT: \n                 \n \n______________________ \n                Nina Y.

Hale,1 in his \nofficial capacity as Superintendent of the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo \n                                                 \n1\n Ronald Hale has been replaced by Chief Executive Officer Jill Marshall, a caption change \nwhich the parties will make once the case is reopened.  Upon reopening, Plaintiffs will add Dr. \nRobert Werthwein, Director of the Office of Behavioral Health, who is also responsible for the \ncontractual and constitutional violations at issue. \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 22\n(“CMHIP”). This motion is deemed unopposed pursuant to the terms of the parties’ Amended \nand Restated Settlement Agreement ¶ 6(c) (Dkt. 78-1) (the “Settlement Agreement”).   \nCertification pursuant to D.C.Colo.LCivR 7.1 \nCounsel for Plaintiff and Defendants have communicated since June 2017 about the \nissues raised in this motion.  These conferrals have included numerous letters, emails, phone \ncalls, at least five multi-hour in-person meetings, a full-day stakeholder meeting and a follow-up \nhalf day settlement meeting.  However, the parties have been unable to resolve what DLC \nbelieves constitute egregious breaches of the Settlement Agreement that settled this action twice \npreviously.  While this motion is deemed unopposed pursuant to the parties’ Settlement \nAgreement, Defendants have advised DLC that they do oppose the relief sought herein and they \nalso oppose reopening to the extent the motion goes beyond challenging the Department’s \ninvocation of departmental special circumstances. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Despite consenting to two court-approved settlement agreements with DLC, the \nState of Colorado, through the Department of Human Services and cabinet-level officials, \ncontinues to disregard the constitutional rights of some of the most vulnerable members of our \ncommunity—individuals who suffer from severe mental illness—by failing to provide timely \ncompetency examinations and restorative treatment.  Through inaction, the State continues to \nunlawfully jail presumed innocent people solely because they suffer from mental illness.  This \nsituation is unconstitutional, unconscionable, and unacceptable. \n2.  The State claims that it lacks sufficient capacity to meet the needs of this helpless \npopulation, but ignores that it is statutorily charged with providing these mental health services \nand must timely do so to comport with due process.  There should be no excuses, particularly \n- 2 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 22\nafter ten years of largely empty promises to fix the problem and address foreseeable increases in \nreferrals.  Rather than partner with and fund community mental health treatment centers or \ninitiate and support legislative changes to remedy the current situation, the State has \nunconstitutionally used county jails as its own private self-storage to house the mentally ill.  \nCounty jails are ill-equipped to provide the necessary mental health care and treatment to these \nindividuals and lengthy stays further jeopardize their health and welfare.  \n3.  Many pretrial detainees who are suffering from serious mental illness are being \nheld in jail due to an arrest on minor offenses, but they cannot afford the most minimal bail to \nbe released from jail as they wait resolution of their cases.  A natural and desperate consequence \nof the extraordinary length of jail stays that are occurring in breach of the Settlement Agreement \nis that there is no place to keep detainees safe from themselves and other inmates while in jail \nexcept to lock them away in solitary confinement or “lock down.” Solitary confinement is far \nfrom therapeutic, and most of the time it is contraindicated for an individual who is \nexperiencing psychosis or delusions.  In some cases, while being physically restrained or \nforcibly taken to isolation, detainees may flail or intentionally hit the corrections officers who \nare trying to move them, resulting in felony assault charges being added to the list of criminal \ncharges facing the detainee.   \n4.  Recent studies show that there are more inmates suffering from serious mental \nillness housed in Colorado’s jails than at CMHIP. Currently, there are close to 300 individuals or \n2000 individuals per year languishing in county jails in limbo.  They are presumed, or have been \ndetermined by a judge, to lack the ability to proceed in their criminal cases, yet they remain \nlocked up for an indefinite period of time waiting for the State to provide its competency \nexamination or restoration services.  The State is obligated under the terms of the Settlement \n- 3 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 22\nAgreement to admit these individuals for examination or restorative treatment at CMHIP within \n28 days.   Some of these individuals have been waiting for more than 100 days.  For those found \nincompetent and waiting for treatment at CMHIP, their wait can amount to five months from the \ndate they were arrested.  The wait times bear no relationship to the offenses these individuals \nhave been charged with, which are often low-level and non-violent misdemeanor charges \nstemming from their mental illnesses.  The result of these lengthy, unconstitutional delays is a \nvicious cycle.  The longer the State makes these individuals wait for evaluation and restorative \nservices, the more exacerbated their mental illnesses become, thereby leading to longer \nrestorative timeframes and a higher likelihood that these individuals will be deemed permanently \nincompetent.  In many cases, the wait times exceed the amount of time (if any) these \npresumptively innocent individuals would have served if they had pled guilty.  \n5.  For DLC, Colorado’s federally-charged protection and advocacy system for \npeople with disabilities, this is more than just a numbers game.  Not only do the current delays \nviolate the timeframes Defendants twice agreed to in the settlement agreements, they also are in \nviolation of the United States Constitution.  These individuals have the right to be treated with \ndignity and respect.  For the pretrial detainees warehoused in Colorado’s jails, Defendants’ \nunconstitutional and unconscionable delays providing competency evaluations and restorative \ntreatment are the result of ineptitude, a tragic pattern of institutional indifference, or both.  \n6.  In the Settlement Agreement, Defendants agreed to timelines for handling in-\npatient competency evaluations and restorative treatment at CMHIP.  Specifically, Defendants \nare required to offer admission to such persons within 28 days from when they are deemed ready \nfor admission.  Defendants are also required to maintain a monthly “days waiting” average of 24 \n- 4 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 22\ndays.  The purpose of these timeframes is to ensure timely evaluation and treatment of the \nmentally incompetent and to prevent the very circumstances that exist today.  \n7.  If, however, the Department’s ability to meet the timeframes under the Settlement \nAgreement was impacted by a special circumstance outside of its control that is unforeseen or \nunanticipated, then the Department could invoke “Departmental Special Circumstances” to \ntemporarily suspend the timeframe requirements of the Settlement Agreement for no longer than \nsix months to allow the Department sufficient time to return to compliance.   \n8.  Unfortunately, Defendants have made little effort to comply with the timeframes \nthey reaffirmed only two years ago, and have instead abused Departmental Special \nCircumstances to excuse their conduct.  Initially, the Department invoked Departmental Special \nCircumstances in June 2017.  The Department re-invoked it in December 2017, on the day that it \nwould have been in further breach, claiming it can consecutively invoke Departmental Special \nCircumstances for the same problem.    \n9.  The problem with Defendants’ invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances \nis that:  (1) Defendants cannot invoke Departmental Special Circumstances based on \ncircumstances that are within their control and have persisted for more than a decade and by \ndefinition are not unanticipated or unforeseen; and (2) even if Defendants’ initial invocation in \nJune 2017 was well-grounded (which it was not), they could not re-invoke Departmental Special \nCircumstances six months later in December 2017 for the same alleged reason.  Under that logic, \nDefendants could re-invoke Departmental Special Circumstances every six months and never \nhave to return to compliance.  Allowing Defendants to misuse the Settlement Agreement by \nplacing the timelines on hold for a year or more (or forever) eviscerates the agreement’s purpose \n- 5 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 22\nto protect the constitutional rights of the mentally ill by requiring timely evaluation and \ntreatment.   \n10.  DLC did not come to this Court without exhausting all other options first.  It has \nspent a year negotiating with the State.  In late February 2018, DLC and Defendants held a \nstakeholder meeting lasting an entire day.  The parties, prosecutors, public defenders, mental \nhealth practitioners, judges, state court administrators, and the legislative budget liaison \nparticipated to find solutions.  At the stakeholder meeting, the State left DLC with the impression \nthat it was negotiating in good faith and looking for long-term solutions. \n11.  The larger stakeholder group discussed proposed legislation that parties could \naccept and help solve the problem.  The Defendants assured DLC it would support and pursue \nlegislation that would help pretrial detainees and address the long jail wait times.  The \nDefendants introduced a bill (SB-252) that would have reduced the number of pretrial detainees \ntaking up beds at CMHIP and the jails.  DLC supported SB-252 as proposed (as well as three \nother bills to help with the jail waits, all of which passed).  The Defendants then revised the bill \nto add a provision that would have allowed them to keep pretrial detainees found incompetent \nlocked down in jails for up to five months while providing some undefined type of jail-based \nrestorative services—services which Colorado’s county jails are ill-equipped to provide and to \ndate have never provided.    \n12.  Jail-based restoration is unconstitutional.  The Department’s former Chief \nMedical Officer (who resigned partway through the legislative process) had previously stated in \nsimilar jail wait litigation in Washington that such lengthy jail restoration was improper.  The \nparties’ Independent Consultant submitted his report from similar jail wait litigation in \n- 6 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 22\nPennsylvania and his affidavit from parallel litigation in Louisiana which stated the same, and \nadvised the Defendants of his opinion that unchecked and lengthy jail restoration is improper.   \n13.  Nevertheless, the Department pushed for SB 18-252, claiming it was the only way \nto resolve this lawsuit and the State’s decade of constitutional violations.  Had the bill been \nenacted, it would have lacked any meaningful protections for the thousands of mentally ill \nColorado pretrial detainees who would have been subjected to the statute.  The bill only failed \nwhen Colorado State Senator Irene Aguilar filibustered.      \n14.  The Defendants’ continued inability to reduce wait times and willful disregard for \nthe constitutional rights of this most vulnerable population shows that the State is unwilling, \nunable, or does not care to provide the constitutionally-mandated services for which it is solely \nresponsible.  As a result, after a year of conferral with the State, DLC seeks the aid of this Court \nto reopen the matter and enforce the Settlement Agreement (a role the Court expressly reserved \nfor itself in the Dismissal Order), and permit the underlying claims to move forward based on the \nState’s continuing constitutional violations. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n15.  DLC initially commenced this matter on August 31, 2011.  Dkt. 1.  The complaint \nalleged that Defendants failed to timely admit pre-trial detainees in jails across Colorado into \nCMHIP, the State’s only forensic mental health facility, for competency evaluations and \nrestorative treatment for those determined to be incompetent to stand trial.  Id.  This failure \ncreated unconstitutional delays to provide competency evaluations and treatment for up to 80 \npretrial detainees, for as long as six months.  Id.   \n16.  The parties participated in several settlement conferences with now-retired \nMagistrate Judge Boland, which produced the first settlement agreement.  Dkt. 51-1.  The \n- 7 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 22\nagreement was incorporated by reference in the Court’s Order of Dismissal on April 9, 2012 \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).  Dkt.  52.  \n17.  In July and August 2015, Plaintiff learned that Defendants had breached the \nSettlement Agreement, including by falsifying data in the monthly report, and moved to reopen \nthe matter for enforcement of the agreement.  Dkt. 53.  After the matter was reopened by the \nCourt (Dkt. 62), the parties engaged in mediation and again resolved the matter through the \ncurrent Settlement Agreement, which was filed with the Court on July 28, 2016.  Dkt. 78-1.  This \nCourt retained jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 4. \n18.  Less than one year later, Defendants again failed to meet the timeframes set forth \nin the parties’ Settlement Agreement.  Declaration of Jennifer Purrington, attached as Exhibit 1, \nat Ex. A (6/22/2017 Notice of Invocation of DSC).   As a result, on June 22, 2017, Defendants \ninvoked Departmental Special Circumstances under the Settlement Agreement.  Id.  Defendants \nclaimed that they could not comply with the Settlement Agreement timeframes due to “an \nunanticipated spike in court-ordered referrals for inpatient competency evaluation and restoration \ntreatment services.”  Id. at 1. \n19.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the Department’s invocation of Departmental \nSpecial Circumstances results in an automatic suspension of the evaluation and restoration \ntimeframes for up to six months.  Dkt. 78-1 ¶ 6(c).  The Settlement Agreement, however, does \nnot afford the Department any additional time to return to compliance if it remains unable to \nmeet the timeframes set forth in the agreement after expiration of the six-month suspension \nperiod.  See id. \n20.  On December 22, 2017—the day the Department’s six-month suspension period \nwas set to expire—the Department sent DLC another notice of invocation of Departmental \n- 8 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 22\nSpecial Circumstances.  Purrington Decl., Ex. B (Dec. 22, 2017 Notice).  In that notice, the \nDepartment claimed Departmental Special Circumstances due to an “unabated” and “sustained \nincrease” in court orders for evaluation and restoration as the reason why the Department \nremained unable to comply with the evaluation and restoration timeframes set forth in the \nSettlement Agreement.  See id. at 1-2. \n21.  It is undisputed that Defendants are out of compliance with the timeframes set \nforth in the Settlement Agreement.  In his September 2017 report, the Independent Consultant \ncharged with overseeing the Defendants’ compliance with the Settlement Agreement concludes \nthat “currently the State is clearly failing to meet the deadlines contained in the Settlement \nAgreement.”  Purrington Decl., at Ex. C at 4 (9/4/2017 Report of Independent Consultant). \nARGUMENT \n \nA.  This Matter Should Be Reopened for Enforcement of the Settlement Agreement. \n \n22.  This motion is deemed unopposed pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.  Dkt. \n78-1, ¶ 6(c).  The agreement states that if “DLC decides to challenge the invocation of \nDepartmental Special Circumstances, it may do so by filing a motion to reopen the Action to \nseek enforcement of this Agreement.  The Department agrees that it will not oppose a motion to \nreopen the Action challenging the invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances and DLC \nmay designate any such motion as ‘unopposed.’”  Id. \n23.  During the pendency of this action, the Court had jurisdiction pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 2201-02, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Dkt. 80.  \n24.  Upon dismissal of the matter, both originally and after the matter was reopened \nand resettled in 2016, the parties agreed that “the Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction over \nthe settlement and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement for the duration of the agreement \n- 9 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 22\nplus 60 days following the delivery of the final report made by Defendants under the \nAgreement.”  Dkt. 52 ¶ 4; Dkt. 80 ¶ 4.  The Court also retained continuing jurisdiction over the \nsettlement and enforcement of the Settlement Agreement until after the conclusion of the term of \nthe agreement under the authority of Kokkenen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co., 511 U.S. 375, \n381-82 (1994), and Bell v. Board of County Commissioners, 451 F.3d 1097, 1103 (10th Cir. \n2006).  Dkt. 52 at 1; Dkt. 80 at 1. \n25.  The Settlement Agreement approved by the Court and incorporated in its \ndismissal order entered on July 29, 2016 remains in effect today and has not been modified or \namended by mutual written agreement or waiver.  \n26.  It is settled that the Court may reopen a case and retain jurisdiction over the \nimplementation and enforcement of a settlement agreement when, as here, its dismissal order \nexpressly states that it will maintain continuing jurisdiction.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381-83.   \n27.  Because the State cannot meet its obligations under the Settlement Agreement and \nhas resorted to improperly invoking Departmental Special Circumstances to cover its failings, \nthe Court should find good cause pursuant to D.C.COLO.LCivR 41.2 to reopen the matter to \nenforce the Settlement Agreement, without prejudice to prosecution of the underlying claims for \nthe State’s continuing constitutional violations.  \nB.  Defendants Have Failed to Meet the Requirements for Conducting Competency \nEvaluations and Restorative Treatment under the Express Terms of the Settlement \nAgreement. \n \n28.  The keystone of the Settlement Agreement is timeframes within which the \nDefendants are obligated to conduct competency evaluations and restorative treatment.  See Dkt. \n78-1 ¶ 2.  Under the Settlement Agreement, the Department is required to admit all pretrial \ndetainees to CMHIP for in-patient restorative treatment and competency evaluations within 28 \n- 10 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 22\ndays of the pretrial detainees being deemed ready for admission.  Id. at ¶ 2(a).  The Department \nalso must maintain a monthly average of 24 days or fewer for all detainees for both competency \nexaminations and restorative treatment.  See id.  \n29.  The below chart details the Defendants’ failure to meet the Settlement Agreement \ntimelines since June 2017 for restorative treatment at CMHIP or its second facility in Arapahoe \nCounty. \nDetainees on \nAverage  Longest Wait \nMonth  Wait List, 28+ \nWait Time   Time \nDays \nJune 2017  3  23.93  29 \nJuly 2017  19  28.12  45 \nAugust 2017  87  37.35  56 \nSeptember 2017  104  47.26  68 \nOctober 2017  120  58.17  88 \nNovember 2017  144  66.46  87 \nDecember 2017  170  67.14  129 \nJanuary 2018  177  72.84  129 \nFebruary 2018  193  74.51  114 \nMarch 2018  221  90.24  133 \nApril 2018  213  87.34  136 \nMay 2018  206  93.98  142 \nPurrington Decl., ¶ 11. \n \n30.  Since June 2017, Defendants have failed to admit all pretrial detainees within 28 \ndays of their ready for admission date and failed to maintain a monthly average of 24 days.   \n31.  Based upon recent reports, wait times for pretrial detainees to be admitted to \nCMHIP for restorative treatment have exceeded 100 days.  The March 2018 data showed 221 \ndetainees out of compliance for restoration, with the longest waiting 133 days.  The April 2018 \ndata are no better.  A total of 213 detainees were out of compliance for restoration, with the \nlongest waiting 136 days.  And in May 2018, there were 206 detainees out of compliance for \nrestoration, with the longest detainee having to wait 142 days in jail.  \n- 11 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 22\n32.  The monthly averages for inpatient evaluation and restoration are nearly \nquadruple the 24-day average required by the Settlement Agreement.  According to the March \n2018 data, the average wait time for restoration was 90.2 days, 87.3 days in April 2018, and 94 \ndays in May 2018.  The State claims it will not be back in compliance until July 2019.  By that \npoint, it would have been in breach of the Settlement Agreement for 24 consecutive months.  \n33.  It is estimated that 25-30% of pretrial detainees listed in the Department’s reports \nare individuals being held in jail as a result of an arrest on a petty, misdemeanor, non-violent, or \ndrug offense.  Tragically, the length of their detention while waiting for an evaluation or \ntreatment exceeds the jail sentence they likely would have received if they had pled guilty on the \nday they were arrested.  Many of these pretrial detainees are seriously mentally ill and in danger \nof harming themselves or others, and are victimized by other detainees as they wait for a humane \nenvironment to be evaluated and treated.  See Purrington Decl., ¶ 12. \n34.  The Department’s abysmal effort in 2017 is part of an accelerating trend of failing \nto stay in compliance with the Settlement Agreement and the United States Constitution.  In \n2015, Defendants were unable to comply with the Settlement Agreement for ten of the twelve \nmonths.  Id. at ¶ 13.  In 2016, they were out of compliance for five out of twelve months.  Id.  In \n2017, Defendants were out of compliance for the last seven months of the year.  Id.  It appears \nthe Defendants will not be back in compliance until July 2019.  The result will be a five-year \nperiod in which they have spent more time out of compliance than in compliance.   \nC.  Defendants Are in Breach of the Settlement Agreement through Their Improper \nInvocation of Departmental Special Circumstances.   \n \n35.   The Settlement Agreement recognizes “that to some extent the Department’s \nability to perform its statutory obligations and its obligations under th[e] Agreement is based on \nfactors beyond its control.”  Dkt. 78-1 ¶ 6.  To account for this, the parties built into the \n- 12 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 22\nSettlement Agreement a mechanism that allows the Department to temporarily suspend the \ntimeframe requirements of the Agreement through invocation of “Special Circumstances.”  Id.     \n36.  At-issue here is the Department’s attempt to invoke “Departmental Special \nCircumstances” pursuant to Paragraph 6(a)(ii) of the Agreement.  The Settlement Agreement \ndefines Departmental Special Circumstances as “circumstances beyond the control of the \nDepartment which impact the Department’s ability to comply with the timeframes set forth in \nParagraph 2.  Id. at ¶ 6(a)(ii).  “This could mean an unanticipated spike in referrals, a national or \nstatewide disaster impacting admissions decisions system wide,” or some other “unique” or \n“unforeseen” circumstance.  Id. (emphasis added).  Critically, the circumstance must be “beyond \nthe control of the Department.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n(1)  Defendants have improperly claimed Departmental Special \nCircumstances for circumstances within their control and which have \npersisted for decades.  \n37.  In June 2017, the Department invoked Departmental Special Circumstances on \nthe alleged basis that it “has experienced an unanticipated spike in court-ordered referrals for \ninpatient competency evaluation and restoration treatment services.”  See Purrington Decl., Ex. \nA at 1; but see id. at 3 (claiming “[a] steady increase in the number of orders for inpatient \nrestoration treatment,” rather than an unanticipated spike).  The Department claims, in that letter, \nthat the increase in referrals, combined with “a decrease in the number of discharges,” has \n“result[ed] in fewer beds available to meet the demand.”   Id. at 3.  \n38.  The Department’s December 2017 letter arguing for a second invocation of \nDepartmental Special Circumstances states the same basis as the June 2017 notice:  “the \nsustained increase in the number of court orders for inpatient competency restoration treatment \nhas outpaced the Department’s capacity and is beyond its control.”  Purrington Decl., Ex. B at 2. \n- 13 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 22\n39.  Departmental Special Circumstances invocations must satisfy two requirements.  \nFirst, the basis for invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances must be something \n“outside the control of the Department.”  Dkt. 78-1 at ¶ 6.  In addition, that basis must be \nsomething “unique” or “unforeseen.”  Id. at ¶ 6(c).  \n40.  The Department fails to meet either requirement.  First, the Department’s recent \nattempts to invoke Departmental Special Circumstances do not qualify under the express \ndefinition of Departmental Special Circumstances because the basis for the Department’s \ninvocation—lack of capacity caused by an increase in referrals—is wholly within the \nDepartment’s control.  \n41.  Notably, the Department’s failure to maintain adequate facilities to keep up with \nthe pace of referrals is a problem that has plagued timely admission of pretrial detainees to \nCMHIP for decades.  See Dkt. 53 at ¶¶ 39-58; see also Dkt. 53-8 at ¶¶ 8-25.  It, thus, cannot be \nconsidered a “statewide disaster,” or otherwise “unique” or “unforeseen.”  \n42.  In any event, the State’s own data shows their invocation is based on a false \npremise.  Below are the monthly totals of new evaluations and restorations.   \nFiscal Year  In Patient Competency  In Patient Restorations \nEvaluations \nJune 2016  25  45 \nJuly 2016  21  47 \nAugust 2016  32  46 \nSeptember 2016  25  53 \nOctober 2016  28  43 \nNovember 2016  23  72 \nDecember 2016  24  48 \nJanuary 2017  27  58 \nFebruary 2017  28  58 \nMarch 2017  27  54 \nApril 2017  29  75 \nMay 2017  26  84 \nJune 2017  37  73 \nJuly 2017  22  66 \n- 14 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 22\nAugust 2017  31  76 \nSeptember 2017  30  66 \nOctober 2017  25  66 \nNovember 2017  19  76 \nDecember 2017  14  68 \nJanuary 2018  19  77 \nFebruary 2018  17  78 \nMarch 2018  30  65 \nApril 2018  9  71 \nPurrington Decl., ¶ 14. \n43.  The data indicates that there has been no unabated increase.  Evaluations have \nincreased and decreased but remained relatively flat over the last two years.  As for restorations, \nthere was some increase leading into the spring of 2017 when they peaked at 84, but they have \nsince decreased back to a lower level.   \n44.  The annual data for the last ten years further discredits the Defendants’ claim of \nan unanticipated spike.  The below table (based on information provided by Defendants to DLC) \nshows the number of referrals for in-patient evaluation and restoration for each fiscal year from \n2005 through 2017 and the percentage of change on an annual basis.  \nFiscal Year  In Patient  % Change  In Patient  % Change \nCompetency  Restorations \nEvaluations \n2005-06  115  -  167  - \n2006-07  144  25.2%  224  34.1% \n2007-08  184  27.8%  219  -2.2% \n2008-09  238  29.3%  170  -22.4% \n2009-10  275  15.5%  212  24.7% \n2010-11  276  0.4%  213  0.5% \n2011-12  287  3.9%  268  25.8% \n2012-13  355  23.7%  274  2.2% \n2013-14  378  6.4%  342  24.8% \n2014-15  415  9.7%  462  35.1% \n2015-16  326  -21.4%  550  19.0% \n2016-17  327  0.3%  711  29.3% \nPurrington Decl., ¶ 15. \n- 15 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 22\n45.  The long-term data shows that evaluations have stabilized nearly 20% below the \nlevel they reached in 2014-15 (when the Department complied for most of the fiscal year).  It is \ntrue there was a 29% increase in restorations in 2016-17, but the Department has seen six \nincreases of at least 24% in restorations in the last ten years.  When the Department has had five \n24% or more increases in a short period of time, the sixth one cannot credibly be claimed to be \n“unanticipated.”  At that point, the Department should be preparing for increases of that size \nmost years and its failure to budget and plan for that is a failure within its control. \n46.  In sum, the State faces an increasing demand on its system.  But the increase has \nbeen a trend for the last decade and thus cannot be characterized as unanticipated.  The \nAgreement does not give the Defendants a pass from their constitutional duties for an increase, \nbut only for an unanticipated one that is outside its control.  There was nothing unforeseen and \nunique about the Department’s lack of capacity to handle the 2017 increases in demand for \nrestorations and the Department’s own data undercuts its claimed increase.  What is different is \nthe State’s utter failure since June 2017 to respond and react to it. \n47.  Regardless, states across the country have been held accountable through court \nrulings and consent decrees in similar litigation.  The State’s defense that more persons with \nmental illness have been filling up jails is not a new phenomenon.  In 2015, an increase was \npredictable in reviewing the data regarding the number of persons with serious mental illness \nentering jails and prisons.  The State failed to mitigate this situation, work with the Independent \nConsultant in any meaningful way, or set up contracts and forge relationships with other public \nand private agencies to assist in outpatient restoration. \n48.  Beneath the bluster, the State admits they are violating the constitutional rights of \nthousands of Coloradans stuck on the waiting list.  At DLC’s suggestion, the State sent letters to \n- 16 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 22\njudges and attorneys involved in 15 cases since April 2018.  Purrington Decl., Ex. D.  In the \nletters, the State admits that it is holding pretrial detainees in jail for months whom it concedes \nwould be better served in the community.  Sadly, the effort has not been as successful as it could \nhave been because the State has failed to partner with community mental health centers—for \nexample, the letters fail to provide a judge any direction on what resources exist in the court’s \ncommunity if the detainee were to be released. \n(2)  Defendants have improperly invoked Departmental Special \nCircumstances consecutively to suspend the timeframe requirements of \nthe Settlement Agreement in perpetuity.  \n \n49.  On December 22, 2017, the day on which the Department’s June invocation of \nDepartmental Special Circumstances was set to expire, Defendants provided DLC with a second \nnotice of invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances.  Purrington Decl. at Ex. B.  The \nbasis for Defendants’ second invocation was the same it previously provided six months earlier.  \nSee id. at 2.  \n50.  The Settlement Agreement does not allow the State to consecutively invoke \nDepartmental Special Circumstances to extend the automatic six-month suspension period for up \nto another six months.  Dkt. 78-1 at ¶ 6(c). \n51.  Allowing the Department to re-invoke Departmental Special Circumstances the \nday the prior invocation ended, as it claimed to do on December 22, 2017, would render the \ntimeframes set forth in the Settlement Agreement meaningless.  Summit Bank & Tr. v. Am. \nModern Home Ins. Co., 71 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1171 (D. Colo. 2014) (“The review of the contract \nmust strive to give effect to all provisions so that none is rendered meaningless.”).  Such an \ninterpretation would render the maximum six-month timeframe for Departmental Special \nCircumstances a nullity.  Under this logic, the State could serially re-invoke Departmental \n- 17 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 22\nSpecial Circumstances every six months in perpetuity and never need to come back into \ncompliance.  It also would eliminate the three-month penalty provision found in the Settlement \nAgreement, which increases the term of the agreement by three months for each month in a \ngiven calendar year that the Department is unable to meet the timeframes set forth in Paragraph 2 \nof the agreement.  See Dkt. 78-1 at ¶ 4(b).   \n52.  While the Settlement Agreement does permit the State to invoke Individual \nSpecial Circumstances (a separate “time out” provision limited to one specific person) more than \nonce so long as it follows the procedures set forth in the agreement, it is silent with respect to the \ninvocation of Departmental Special Circumstances.  See id. at ¶ 6(b)(ii).  DLC agreed to allow \nmultiple invocations for individuals through the inclusion of express language in the agreement, \nbut it did not agree to the same procedure for departmental special circumstances.  Compare id. \nat ¶ 6(b), with id. at ¶ 6(c). \n53.  The Defendants’ consecutive invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances \nconstitutes a breach of the Settlement Agreement and a breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing, at best.  See Amoco Oil Co. v. Ervin, 908 P.2d 493, 498 (Colo. 1995) \n(explaining that “every contract contains an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing” to \n“effectuate the intentions of the parties or to honor their reasonable expectations”).  At worst, it \nis a willful and intentional breach of the agreement and demonstrates the State’s continuous and \ndeliberate indifference to the due process rights of Colorado’s mentally ill.  The Court should \nreopen this case and explore the claims emanating from this bad-faith conduct by Defendants.    \n(3)  The Independent Consultant \n54.  As part of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to have an Independent \nConsultant monitor the State’s compliance with the settlement timeframes and assist the State to \n- 18 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 22\navoid this constitutional problem for a third time.  The Independent Consultant has been \nineffective, and in this crisis has still not reviewed the data, nor completed the quarterly report \ndue in April 2018, which would identify areas of non-compliance and provide expert \nrecommendations to get back into compliance.  Once again, DLC is left to attempt to monitor the \nState, without full information.   \nCONCLUSION \n55.  It is undeniable that the system is (and has been for decades) in a state of \ndisrepair.  But the reason for the disrepair is not outside the Department’s control or due to \nunique, unanticipated or special circumstances.  Rather, it is wholly due to Defendants’ \nineptitude, lack of vision, and continuous and willful disregard for the health and well-being of \nthe very people they are statutorily tasked with helping:  the mentally ill.   \n56.  DLC is at a loss.  It has engaged in negotiations and litigation with Defendants for \nseven years to no avail.  The Independent Consultant has been ineffective.  The Defendants have \nspent more time in the last four years out of compliance with the Settlement Agreement than they \nhave spent meeting the timeframes they agreed to abide by in good faith.  DLC seeks this Court’s \nassistance to protect and preserve the constitutional rights of these individuals and to enforce the \nSettlement Agreement.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and enter \nan order: \na.  reopening this action to conduct proceedings to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement, including permitting limited, expedited discovery and setting an \nevidentiary hearing; \n \nb.  reopening this action to permit the underlying claims for the State’s continuing \nconstitutional violations, including holding a preliminary injunction regarding the \n- 19 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 22\nState’s continuing constitutional violations and the appropriate sanctions for those \ncontinuing violations;  \n \nc.  declaring that Defendants breached the Settlement Agreement;  \n \nd.  directing Defendants to eliminate the wait list by August 1, 2018, or sooner, and \nnotifying Defendants that their failure to do so could result in a finding of \ncontempt, including associated fines or penalties; \n \ne.  directing Defendants to comply with the deadlines set out in the Settlement \nAgreement for all referrals made on and after August 1, 2018 and notifying \nDefendants that their failure to do so could result in a finding of contempt, \nincluding associated fines and/or penalties; \n \nf.  appointing an independent court monitor to oversee and scrutinize Defendants’ \nfuture performance under the Settlement Agreement; \n \ng.  extending the Amended Settlement Agreement by three months for each month \nDefendants failed to comply with the timeframes in the Settlement Agreement; \n \nh.  awarding Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the \npreparation and filing of this motion and the conduct of any further proceedings; \nand \n \ni.  granting such other or further relief against Defendants as the Court deems just \nand proper. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n/// \n   \n- 20 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 82   Filed 06/13/18   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 22\nDATED:  June 13, 2018. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \ns/ Iris Eytan    s/ Mark J.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No. 11-cv-02285-NYW \nCENTER FOR LEGAL ADVOCACY, d/b/a DISABILITY LAW COLORADO, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nREGGIE BICHA, in his official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of \nHuman Services; and \nJILL MARSHALL, in her official capacity as Superintendent of the Colorado Mental Health \nInstitute at Pueblo, \n \n  Defendants. \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTER \n \nMagistrate Judge Nina Y. Wang \n  This matter comes before the court on Plaintiff Center for Legal Advocacy d/b/a Disability \nLaw Colorado’s (“DLC” or “Plaintiff”) Motion for Appointment of Special Master (or “Motion”), \nfiled December 6, 2018.  See [#117].  The Motion is before the undersigned pursuant to the Order \nof Reference dated February 21, 2012 [#44], the Order of Reassignment dated November 19, 2015 \n[#58], 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), Fed. R. Civ. P. 73, and D.C.COLO.LCivR 72.2.  The court retained \nancillary jurisdiction over this civil action pursuant to Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 381 (1994).  Accordingly, having reviewed the Motion, associated briefing, and \napplicable case law, the court GRANTS the Motion for Appointment of Special Master.   \nBACKGROUND \nThe court has discussed the background of this matter in its Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder on the Parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, see [#113], and discusses it here only \nas it pertains to the instant Motion.  On November 9, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in \npart DLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment, denied Defendants Reggie Bicha and Jill Marshall’s \n \n \n\n(collectively, “Defendants” or “the Department”) Motion for Summary Judgment, and set a Status \nConference for November 30, 2018 to discuss discovery and an evidentiary hearing regarding the \nDepartment’s invocation of Department Special Circumstances (“DSC”) in June and December \n2017.  See generally [#113].  At the November 30, 2018 Status Conference, Plaintiff proposed that \nthe court consider appointing a special master, and this court discussed a discovery schedule1 in \ncontemplation of a five-day evidentiary hearing to commence on March 18, 2019.  See [#115]. \nDLC filed the instant Motion on December 6, 2018, requesting that the court appoint a \nSpecial Master to assist the Parties and the court.  See [#117 at 2-5].  Plaintiff proposes appointment \nof “Groundswell Services and its team of Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie,” who “have \ntremendous, relevant experience.”  [Id. at 7].  DLC further contends that the Department should \nbear the costs of a Special Master because it “had already agreed in the 2016 Settlement Agreement \nto pay for Dr. Dvoskin [who was initially selected to act as an independent consult to assist with \nDefendants’ compliance efforts]” and because this court has determined the Department to be in \nbreach of the 2016 Settlement Agreement.  See [id. at 7-8].  Finally, DLC requests that the duration \nof appointment last “for the duration of the Amended Settlement Agreement” or “[a]t a minimum, \n. . . until such time that the Department returns to compliance and the Court enters final judgment \nagainst Defendants for their breaches of the Amended Settlement Agreement.”  [Id. at 8].    \nDefendants filed a Response on December 13, 2018.  See [#118].  Defendants agree that \nappointment of a Special Master will serve the interests of the Parties and the court.  See [id. at 1].  \nFurther, Defendants agree to the appointment of Groundswell Services and its team of Drs. Neil \nGowensmith and Daniel Murrie, and agree to bear the costs of such appointment, “provided the \n                                                           \n1 The court issued a separate Minute Order outlining the scope of discovery ahead of the \nevidentiary hearing.  See [#116].   \n2 \n \n\nduties  of  the  Independent  Consultant  are  stayed  as  proposed  in  Plaintiff’s  Exhibit  8  and \nDefendants’ Exhibit A, and the duties and duration of the special master are adopted as outlined \nin Exhibit A.”  [Id. at 2].  Defendants also request that the duration of the appointment last until \nDefendants have “maintained compliance with the Settlement Agreement timeframes concerning \ninpatient competency restoration services for three months,” with the potential for a longer \nduration upon DLC’s showing of good cause.  See [id. at 2-3].     \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the court with the authority to \nappoint a special master under certain circumstances.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(a), (b); accord Bartlett-\nCollins Co. v. Surinam Nav. Co., 381 F.2d 546, 550 (10th Cir. 1967) (explaining that “reference to \na Master shall be the exception and not the rule”).  And “‘a federal district court has the inherent \npower to supply itself with [a special master] for the administration of justice when deemed by it \nessential.’”  United States v. State of Conn., 931 F. Supp. 974, 984 (D. Conn. 1996) (quoting Ruiz \nv. Estelle, 679 F.2d 1115, 1161 n.240 (5th Cir. 1982).  “The use of masters is ‘to aid judges in the \nperformance of specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause,’ and not to \ndisplace the court.”  La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249, 256 (1957) (quoting Ex Parte \nPeterson, 253 U.S. 300 (1920)).  See also WRIGHT & MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND \nPROCEDURE: CIVIL 2d § 2601 (1995) (the appointment of a master is for the purpose of assisting \nthe court to obtain facts).      \nANALYSIS \nAs mentioned, the Parties agree that appointment of a Special Master in this matter serves \ntheir interests as well as the court’s.  The Parties further agree to the appointment of Groundswell \nServices and its team of Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie, and that Defendants will bear \n3 \n \n\nthe costs of appointment.  Thus, the court agrees that a Special Master is warranted, and therefore \nGRANTS the Motion.   \nDuring the Status Conference held before the court on December 18, 2018, it appeared that \ndespite the difference in language in the Parties’ respective proposals regarding the scope of the \nSpecial Master’s duties, compare [#117 at 5-6; #117-8] with [#118-1], the Parties do, in fact, agree \nthat the Special Master will have authority to review the entire competency system as implicated \nby the Settlement Agreement, i.e., inpatient and outpatient competency evaluations and restorative \ntreatment. See [#78-1 at 2].  The Parties, however, disagree as to the duration of the Special \nMaster’s appointment.  Thus, this Order will not and cannot serve as an Order Appointing a Master \nbecause Rule 53(b) requires such an Order to contain, inter alia, “the master’s duties, including \nany investigation or enforcement duties, and any limits on the master’s authority under Rule \n53(c).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(b)(2)(B).  And Rule 53 further limits the court’s ability to issue an Order \nAppointing a Master to only after the Special Master “files an affidavit disclosing whether there is \nany ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455,” which has not yet been completed.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 53(b)(3)(A). \nNevertheless, to facilitate the appointment of the Special Master the court ORDERS that \nno later than December 19, 2018, Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie shall submit to the \ncourt affidavits concerning “whether there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 455.”  In addition, the court has attached a revised summary of the duties of the Special Master \nreflecting its understanding of the agreed-upon scope by the Parties.  To the extent that the Parties \nobject to the scope as reflected by the summary, they will file their respective objections no later \nthan December 19, 2018.   The court will then issue a separate, written Order Appointing a Master \nand determining the length of such appointment. \n4 \n \n\nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the court hereby ORDERS that:  \n(1)  Plaintiff’s Motion for Appointment of Special Master [#117] is GRANTED;   \n(2)  No later than December 19, 2018, Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie shall \nSUBMIT to the court affidavits concerning “whether there is any ground for \ndisqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455;”  \n(3)  No later than December 19, 2018, the Parties will FILE any objections to the \nsummary of the duties of the Special Master as attached as Ex. 1 to this Order; and \n(4)  A separate, written Order pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure will follow. \n \nDATED:  December 18, 2018        BY THE COURT: \n                 \n \n______________________ \n                Nina Y. Wang \n                United States Magistrate Judge \n   \n5 \n ",

This Consent Decree prescribed a variety \nof steps the Department must take to improve the competency assessment and restoration \nsystem in Colorado, and eventually attain compliance with all time frames and deadlines \nmandated in the Consent Decree.  The Department has initiated many of these steps, \ndemonstrating meaningful progress, in ways we detail through the remainder of this report.  In \nparticular, this report will focus on developments since our prior quarterly report, which was \nsubmitted August 28, 2019.   \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 36\nPage 3 \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................................... 4 \nKEY METRICS FOR PROGRESS: COMPLIANCE WITH TIME FRAME REQUIREMENTS................................ 8 \nKEY METRIC:  COMPETENCE EVALUATION TIME FRAMES ................................................................ 9 \nKEY METRIC:  COMPETENCE RESTORATION TIME FRAMES ............................................................. 10 \nKEY METRIC:  THE WAITLIST FOR COMPETENCE RESTORATION SERVICES ...................................... 12 \nCONSENT DECREE SECTION VI UPDATES ................................................................................... 13 \nADMISSION OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES FOR INPATIENT COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS AND RESTORATION \nTREATMENT ...................................................................................................................................... 13 \nWait Times for Inpatient Evaluation .............................................................................................. 14 \nWait Times for Inpatient Restoration ............................................................................................. 16 \nPERFORMANCE OF JAIL COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS ........................................................................ 18 \nINTERIM JAIL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT ...................................................................................... 21 \nRELEASE OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION TREATMENT .................. 23 \nTRANSPORTATION OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES ...................................................................................... 26 \nNOTIFICATION OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH TIME FRAMES ............................................................... 27 \nCONSENT DECREE SECTION VII UPDATES .................................................................................. 29 \nCIVIL BED FREEZE............................................................................................................................... 29 \nCOMPREHENSIVE AND COHESIVE PLAN ............................................................................................. 30 \nINCREASE COMMUNITY RESTORATION SERVICES .............................................................................. 32 \nCONCLUSION ............................................................................................................................ 36 \n \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 36\nPage 4 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe Consent Decree filed March 15, 2019 prescribed a variety of steps the Department must \ntake, and timelines it must meet, to improve the competency assessment and restoration system \nin Colorado.  After the Consent Decree was filed in March, the Department began taking many of \nthese steps (detailed through the remainder of this report) in ways that we consider generally \nresponsive, and in ways that appear to recognize the gravity and complexity of the challenges \nthey face.   \n \nBroadly speaking, we consider three goals of the Consent Decree to be primary:  \na) Reducing the overall number of people on the waitlist for competence restoration \nservices,  \nb) Reducing the wait times for people on the waitlist, particularly people with the most \nacute psychiatric illness, and  \nc) Reducing harm to people on the waitlist.   \n \nProgress on the first goal has been quite modest, but slight improvements are apparent, \nparticularly over the last month.  Progress on the second goal has been much more substantial, \nthough solely for people with the most acute psychiatric illness.  Similarly, progress on the third \ngoal has been mixed.  The ability to quickly hospitalize those who are most ill has undoubtedly \nreduced the overall scope of human suffering, though there was one suicide among this group \n(described further, below), and those with less acute illness tend to wait in the hospital longer.  \nThis report details progress on these three primary markers as well as other key developments.   \n \nProgress: \nKey developments include the launch of several new initiatives.  Whereas our prior reports \naddressed the Department’s planning and implementation, we are now beginning to see the \noutcomes of those new initiatives the Consent Decree prescribed.  Specifically, the Department \nhas:  \n \n•  Maintained an active Triage system, a key compromise from the Consent Decree, which \nrequires the Department to rapidly (i.e., within 7 days) admit for competence restoration \nthe most acutely ill defendants (“Tier 1”) and less rapidly admit those who less urgently \nneed hospitalization (“Tier 2”).   \n  \n•  Admitted these Tier 1 defendants for inpatient restoration in a prompt manner, \nconsistent with the requirements of the Consent Decree.  This is the most significant \nimprovement to the competency system in several years, and the Department has \nmaintained near-perfect compliance with these ambitious seven-day requirements.   \n \n•  Launched the Forensic Support Team (FST), another key component of the Consent \nDecree.  The FST has just begun monitoring incompetent-to-proceed (ITP) defendants in \njail awaiting hospitalization, and has intervened well in several crisis and emergency \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 36\nPage 5 \n \nsituations.  The presence of a team to monitor the defendants on the waitlist is a \nsignificant improvement over last year, when the Department had no such service, and a \nfundamental change to the Colorado competency system.   \n \n•  Coordinated a draft of the Department’s “comprehensive and cohesive plan” for \ncompetency services in Colorado with the Governor’s task force on competency-related \nissues.   \n \n•  Maintained and expanded data systems, analysis, and reporting of competency-related \ninformation.   \n \n•  Implemented enhanced competency evaluation reports, consistent with mandates from \nthe Consent Decree and SB19-223.  These reports now include more in-depth \ninformation regarding competency of the defendant as well as opinions on placement \nfor restoration (inpatient vs. community-based restoration) and urgency of clinical need \n(Tier 1 vs. Tier 2).  A large training event for evaluators, led by a national expert, further \naided Department evaluators in these goals. \n \n•  Opened 18 new beds for competency restoration at the Boulder County Jail’s RISE \nprogram.  This program replicates the RISE program at Arapahoe County Jail. \n \n•  Opened new contracted beds at one private hospital in the metro area, for a total of five \nnew beds (with an additional three in the near future).   \n \n•  Finally, via the Fines Committee prescribed by the Consent Decree (p.17), the \nDepartment, Disability Law Colorado (DLC), and the Special Master have collaborated \nwith the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless to fund Fusion Studios, which will provide \nhousing in the community to many competency-involved individuals over the next five \nyears, beginning by January 2020.  \n \nAs anticipated in our last report, these developments have yielded some progress towards \nmeeting key time frame requirements.  In short, defendants opined to be Tier 1 are now \nadmitted to CMHIP promptly, within the Consent Decree’s 7-day timeframe.  However, the \noverall size of the waitlist remains only slightly lower than in March 2019, and the wait for Tier 2 \ndefendants has decreased only slightly.   \n \nChallenges: \nThe Department has also experienced significant setbacks and challenges.  Recently, one \ndefendant on the waitlist for hospitalization committed suicide before she was transferred to the \nhospital.  There were also two suicides among individuals involved in competence-restoration \nservices in the community (though these do not fall directly within the scope of the Consent \nDecree).  These incidents, and other developments, underscore some of the current challenges \nfor the Department, including: \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 36\nPage 6 \n \n \n•  Using the newly launched Forensic Support Team (FST) to aid defendants found \nincompetent to proceed (ITP) who are either in jail awaiting transfer to Colorado Mental \nHealth Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP) or in the community receiving community-based \nrestoration treatment.  The FST launched in earnest somewhat behind schedule, and \ncontinues to clarify its role vis-a-vis the complementary Court-operated Bridges Court \nLiaison program and clarify its role with defendants in the community.  As the \nDepartment knows, the first several months after launching any new initiative will require \nsignificant monitoring, revision, and changes as unanticipated challenges inevitably arise. \n \n•  Accelerating restoration services for defendants designated Tier 2.  Whereas the \nDepartment has been remarkably prompt in hospitalizing the Tier 1 patients, full \nadherence to the Consent Decree will require improving timely service to Tier 2 \ndefendants as well.   \n \n•  Appropriately responding to the recent suicides among competence-involved individuals, \nand learning from these incidents to prevent others.1  Frankly, suicides (and other human \nsuffering among defendants in the competency system) are exactly the type of outcome \nthe Consent Decree attempts to minimize.  Though not all the factors surrounding these \nincidents are under Department control, the Department must learn from these incidents \nto prevent similar situations. \n \n•  Ensuring that sheriff’s departments and county jails are better prepared to provide \nenhanced mental health services for defendants awaiting competency services in local \ncounty jails.  This funding was provided by SB19-223; while the response to requests for \nproposals has been largely unanimous, the scope and breadth of services varies widely – \nsuch that some counties may still be operating with inadequate in-jail mental health \nservices.  Lessons from the recent in-jail suicide should shape future Department \ncollaborations with the jails. \n \nBeyond these emerging challenges, some of the primary challenges (i.e., the areas for closest \nscrutiny and support) we identified in our prior quarterly report remain: \n \n•  Better educating the court and the bar about the triage system and other new \ninterventions, so that they will act in ways that support the triage system and the broader \n                                                        \n \n1 Our discussion of these recent suicides is limited in detail, because we are still awaiting crucial \ninformation about the incidents.  To be clear, our impression is that the Department has responded \nrapidly and appears generally responsive to our requests for information.  But the incident involved jail-\nbased mental health services from a contracted mental health care provider, and we do not have full or \nprompt access to information from that source.  We have requested all relevant records relating to both \nthe in-jail suicide and the in-community suicides and we anticipate further discussion of these in our \nsubsequent report.  We may also decide to submit a separate confidential report, if indicated.   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 36\nPage 7 \n \ngoals of admitting the most acutely ill defendants most rapidly.  These educational efforts \nwill need to be prompt and assertive in order to help courts understand and support new \nprocedures and less often issue “show cause” orders that compromise CDHS goals of \ntriaging by greatest clinical need.  Although the Department has described some \ndissemination efforts, further dissemination efforts remain crucial in the very near future.   \n \n•  Ensuring adequate training and reliability among evaluators as they learn to include \ntriage opinions and restoration placement recommendations in their competence \nevaluation reports.  As we have discussed with the Department, the initial training efforts \nwere inadequate and delayed.  Consequently, evaluators have been deeply frustrated \nand morale has been strained.  More recently, we have taken a more active role with \nevaluators.  The Department has made changes to evaluator leadership and has better \nengaged evaluators and supervisors.  Morale and progress seems to be improving.   \n \n•  Monitoring both the FST and the Community-Based Restoration Treatment (CBRT) \nsystems.  These systems (especially the FST) are relatively new programs, and both \nappear to be experiencing some understandable identity confusion and growing pains.  \nBoth have experienced suicide either directly or indirectly, neither have a functioning \ndata collection or analysis system in operation, and both experience role confusion from \noutside stakeholders.  We therefore devoted more space to these two programs in this \nquarterly report than in previous reports; potential problem areas and suggested \nrecommendations are discussed in their respective sections.  \n \nOverall, we continue to affirm the Department’s efforts to enact the changes prescribed in the \nConsent Decree.  Their efforts to comply with the Consent Decree have been well-conceived and \nusually well-executed.  However, the recent suicides require significant attention: identifying \nroot causes and lessons learned, then making necessary changes immediately.  We remain \nencouraged by: the triage system, improving morale of Court Services evaluators, CBRT service \navailability, and the increased role of the FST.  But it remains crucial to address some of the more \npersistent problems: long waitlists for Tier 2 individuals, poor leverage with interim jail mental \nhealth services, looming shortages of Court Services evaluators, poor data management in \ncertain areas, and lingering role confusion with the Bridges program. \n \nWe begin by addressing the Department’s compliance with time frame requirements, because \nthis is the primary focus of the Consent Decree (and the focus that the Consent Decree \nprescribes for these quarterly reports).  Indeed, we consider these time frames our “key metrics” \n— or primary markers of progress — that we review in each quarterly report.  However, we then \nexpand to address the other interventions prescribed by the Consent Decree because progress in \nthese interventions will likely contribute to progress in achieving the overall goal of compliance \nwith time frame requirements.   \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 36\nPage 8 \n \n \nKEY METRICS FOR PROGRESS: COMPLIANCE WITH TIME FRAME REQUIREMENTS \n \nAs prescribed in the Consent Decree, a primary focus of these quarterly reports must be the \nDepartment’s compliance with time frame requirements: \n(i)  As part of the duties, the Special Master shall provide the Court and the Parties with status \nreports ... Such reports shall address the Department’s compliance with the timeframe \nrequirements of the Consent Decree concerning Competency Services and shall provide a \ndetailed summary of information and recommendations the Special Master believes the Court \nand Parties should consider relating to the Department’s compliance with the Consent Decree \ntimeframes concerning Competency Services. (Consent Decree p.24) \n(ii) The Special Master’s report shall include, but is not limited to, reporting on the number of \nPretrial Detainees ordered to receive Competency Services, an assessment of the \nDepartment’s operations, systems, and admissions practices and policies relating to the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with the Consent Decree timeframes, and guidance to the \nDepartment for improvement and increasing efficiencies in these areas.   \nTherefore, a primary focus of our review is the Department’s progress in meeting the time \nframes delineated in the Consent Decree.  This includes both time frames for competence \nevaluation and for competence restoration.  We anticipate that these will be the key metrics to \ndemonstrate progress over the next few years, so they are our starting point in the report, as \nwell as a primary focus.  Of course, performance in meeting these time frames depends greatly \non enacting the other steps prescribed in the Consent Decree, so subsequent sections of the \nreport review those steps in greater detail. \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 36\nPage 9 \n \nKEY METRIC:  COMPETENCE EVALUATION TIME FRAMES \n \nAs summarized in the table below, the Department has been meeting the timelines for \ncompetence evaluation that the Consent Decree prescribed beginning June 2019.  Indeed, the \nDepartment was meeting these evaluation time frames even before June 2019. \n \n \nAverage Wait Times for Competence Evaluation Services2 \n \n  Jun-Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  June 2019  January 2020 \n2019   2019   2019   2019  Requirement  Requirement \n             \nJail-based             \nCompetency  22.8  22.3  21.3  23.7*  28 days  28 days \nEvaluations \n             \nInpatient             \nCompetency  12.8  20*  12.7  20.8*  21 days  21 days \nEvaluations   \n \n* = at least one defendant waited longer than max time frame for the evaluation \n \nGenerally, timely competence evaluation has been a relative strength of the Department.  Well \nbefore the recent Consent Decree, they followed the national trend of de-centralizing \nevaluations, moving them from solely an inpatient service to a localized service in the \ncommunity.  During recent history, their evaluations have almost always met the prescribed time \nframes.  Recently, however, their success in meeting these time frames appears more tenuous, \nas they lack an adequate workforce of evaluators and (as of the most recent data from this \nweek) they appear close to missing some evaluation deadlines.  This vulnerability underscores \nthe need to rapidly recruit and retain good forensic evaluators (discussed later in this report).  \nSimilarly, we anticipate the Department will need to take additional steps over the next year to \nmaintain their compliance, particularly when the prescribed time frames decrease to 21 days in \nJuly 2020.   \n \nOverall, the Department has performed well with respect to competence evaluation time frames \nover the past year, but will need to aggressively and rapidly improve the evaluator workforce to \nmaintain this compliance. \n   \n                                                        \n \n2 Data from October 2019 is the most recent data available from CDHS.  Average wait times for Jun-Jul \n2019 reflect a reasonable approximation of the average wait times; exact sample sizes were not used to \ncalculate a precise average.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 36\nPage 10 \n \nKEY METRIC:  COMPETENCE RESTORATION TIME FRAMES \n \nIn contrast to their prompt evaluation services, the Department has consistently failed to provide \nprompt restoration services.  In the months before the Triage system launched, defendants who \nwere admitted for inpatient restoration treatment at CMHIP or RISE waited, on average, 71 \ndays.3  Of course, this figure included all defendants referred for restoration, without distinction \nbetween those with more, versus less, acute needs.  Since then, however, the Department \nlaunched on June 1, 2019 the Consent-Decree-mandated triage system,4 designed to prioritize \nthe defendants with the most acute clinical needs (“Tier 1”) over those with less acute clinical \nneeds (“Tier 2”).  Tier 1 defendants must receive services within 7 days of the competency \nhearing, whereas Tier 2 defendants need not receive services for 56 days (with Tier 2 deadlines \nshortening in the future).   \n \nOverall, recent CDHS monthly reports describe excellent adherence to the 7-day deadline for \ndefendants whom the court has designated as Tier 1 (i.e., average wait times well under 7 days).5  \nHowever, wait times for Tier 2 defendants still far exceed the time frames prescribed in the \nConsent Decree (i.e., average wait times exceeding 80 days, well beyond the required 56 days).   \n \n \nAverage Wait Times for Inpatient Competence Restoration Services6 \n \n  Jun-Jul  Aug 2019  Sep  Oct  June 2019  January 2020 \n2019  2019   2019  Requirement  Requirement \n             \nTier 1  3.64*  3.2  5.2  3.7  7 days  7 days \n             \nTier 2  87.2**  80.8**  99.8**  94.5**  56 days  49 days \n \n* = at least one defendant waited longer than maximum time frame for restoration services \n** = most defendants waited longer than maximum time frame for restoration services \n \nHowever, each of these summary statistics requires more discussion.  First, the figures for Tier 1 \ndefendants reflect only Tier 1 defendants as defined in the Consent Decree; that is, defendants \nwhom the court has designated as Tier 1 and ordered to the hospital.  This represents only a \n                                                        \n \n3 Average waiting period November 2018 – April 2019, as calculated from data provided by the \nDepartment (see p.7 of their Monthly report filed May 7, 2019). \n \n4 See Consent Decree paragraph 43. \n \n5 According to Special Master Compliance Plan report October 2019 p.10 (submitted November 7, 2019). \n \n6 Average wait times for Tier 2 defendants reflect a reasonable approximation of the average wait times; \nexact sample sizes were not used to calculate a precise average. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 36\nPage 11 \n \nfraction of the number of defendants whom CDHS evaluators have recommended as Tier 1 (for \nexample, the June figure is based on two defendants and the July figure is based on 7 \ndefendants) because some are admitted to CMHIP or have charges dismissed before the court \nenters an order designating them as Tier 1.   \n \nAn initial process review: \n Shortly after the launch of the triage system, we conducted individualized reviews \nof the first 53 cases in which Court Services evaluators opined defendants as Tier 1 \nto ensure that each of these defendants were indeed admitted as required within \nthe Consent Decree time frames.  As written in our August 2019 report:  \n \nWe view this Tier 1 population as the heart of the Consent Decree — those \ndefendants who are identified most urgently needing hospital-level care — and \nwe must ensure that their needs are met in ways consistent with the letter and \nspirit of the Consent Decree.  We look forward to reviewing CDHS’s detailed \naccount of each Tier 1 defendant’s pathway, and reporting this information to \nyou in our next quarterly report to the Court.   \n \nAs a result of this initial review, we are confident that each defendant opined Tier 1 \nand ordered by the court to inpatient restoration within 7 days of their adjudication \nwas indeed admitted to CMHIP within that time frame.   \n \nTo date, the Department reports that a total of 83 individuals have been opined as Tier 1 by \nCourt Services Evaluators and admitted to CMHIP via the Consent Decree criteria.  Of these, 81 \nwere admitted within the 7-day maximum time frame.  In many respects, this summary bodes \nwell for CDHS efforts to implement the triage system.  According to CDHS administrators and \ndata management personnel, the vast majority of defendants whom evaluators designate as Tier \n1 are admitted to the hospital promptly (i.e., well within seven days), and often even before the \nCourt designates them as Tier 1 and orders admission.  For those that have not, CDHS has \noffered what appear to be plausible explanations.   \n \nRegarding Tier 2 defendants, progress has been limited.  Average wait times still far exceed the \ntime limits in the Consent Decree, just as they did for all defendants in prior months.  Tier 2 \ndefendants have typically waited between 81 and 100 days between August and October 2019, \nwhen the maximum time frame for that time period was 56 days.  Thus, the Tier 1 figures \nsuggest that the Triage System serves the purpose for which it was designed: prioritizing the \nmost acutely ill defendants and moving them into the hospital rapidly.  However, the Tier 2 \nfigures reveal that CDHS continues to struggle with some of the primary challenges that \nprompted the Consent Decree: responding to the volume of defendants referred for inpatient \nrestoration, and admitting them into the hospital within a reasonable time frame.   \n \nOverall, Tier 1 admissions occur on time, while Tier 2 admissions still far exceed maximum \nadmission time frames.    \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 36\nPage 12 \n \n \nKEY METRIC:  THE WAITLIST FOR COMPETENCE RESTORATION SERVICES \n \nBeyond the wait times for restoration services (and progress towards the time frame \nrequirements of the Consent Decree), another key metric for gauging the Department’s progress \nis the waiting list for competence restoration services.  In the months preceding launch of the \nTriage system, the waitlist averaged around 150 to 180 defendants.7  But again, with the \ninitiation of the Triage system on June 1, we must consider the waitlist according to Tier status.  \nCentral to the Triage system is an acknowledgement that some incompetent defendants are so \nacutely ill that they require treatment almost immediately (Tier 1, who require treatment within \n7 days), whereas others can safely await treatment (Tier 2, who can wait several weeks).   \n \n \nN  umber of Defendants on Waiting List for Inpatient Restoration8 \n   March 2019  July 2019  Aug 2019  Sep 2019  Oct 2019  \nCombined  157         \nTier 1  N/A  1  0  0  0 \nTier 2  N/A  168  169  152  145 \n           \n \nThe number of persons on the waitlist is still quite high.  This number is driven largely by the \nnumber of court orders that OBH receives, but can be decreased by the availability of inpatient \nrestoration beds and alternative restoration settings.  The number has fluctuated since March \n2019, but overall has decreased slightly since then. \n \nOverall, there has been a slight, but meaningful, decrease in the number of individuals on the \nwaitlist for restoration services over the past quarter. This decrease appears genuinely \nattributable to Department interventions and not simply to a decrease in referrals.    \n                                                        \n \n7 At present, the Department provides waitlist data as daily figures, so the monthly figures in the table \nreflect averaged daily figures.    \n \n8 According to the Department’s Special Master Compliance Plan report October 2019 p.10 (submitted \nNovember 7, 2019). \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 36\nPage 13 \n \nCONSENT DECREE SECTION VI UPDATES \n \nADMISSION OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES9 FOR INPATIENT COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS \nAND RESTORATION TREATMENT  \n \n33.

The Department shall Offer Admission to Pretrial Detainees to the Hospital for Inpatient \nRestoration Treatment or Inpatient Competency Evaluations pursuant to the attached table (Table 1).  \nCompliance with this measure shall be calculated based on the number of Days Waiting for each \nPretrial Detainee.   \nThe Consent Decree prescribes the following time frames for admitting defendants to inpatient \ncompetence restoration and for performing competence evaluations (whether inpatient or in \njail).10  Admission time frames become progressively shorter at each six-month increment.  \nEvaluation time frames are reduced in July 2020.   \n \n \n  Tier 1: Maximum  Tier 2: Maximum  Maximum Time to  Maximum time to \nDeadlines  Time to Offer  Time to Offer  Offer Admission  Complete Jail \nAdmission for  Admission for  for Inpatient  Competency \nInpatient  Inpatient  Competency  Evaluations \nRestoration  Restoration  Evaluations \n         \nJune 1, 2019  7 days  56 days  21 days  28 days \n \nJanuary 1, 2020  7 days  49 days  21 days  28 days \n \nJuly 1, 2020  7 days  42 days  14 days  21 days \n \nJanuary 1, 2021  7 days  35 days  14 days  21 days \n \nJuly 1, 2021  7 days  28 days  14 days  21 days \n \n \nAs summarized earlier in this report (“Key Metrics”), the Department generally meets June 1 time \nframes for competency evaluations, and even meets the time frame for admitting Tier 1 \ndefendants to restoration.  But they far exceed the time frames for Tier 2 admissions to \ncompetency restoration.   \n \n   \n                                                        \n \n9 “Pretrial Detainee” means a person who is being held in the custody of a County Jail and whom a court \nhas ordered to undergo Competency Services.

The average wait \ntime for admission to CMHIP for inpatient competency evaluation was 17.8 days (more than 5 \ndays longer than the average for the previous quarter).  Although the number of admissions was \nmuch lower than the previous quarter, the wait time is longer and more people have waited \nlonger than the maximum 28-day time frame.  The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but \nlikely relates to Department efforts to admit Tier 1 patients for restoration within the 7-day \ntimeframe (which inevitably causes longer waits for other admissions).  Although the \nDepartment has continued to handle most of these inpatient evaluations as “same-day” \nevaluations, which do not require full admission and multi-day stay (thereby reserving hospital \nbeds for those who need them more), the waits are increasing.  This is in contrast to the previous \nquarter, which showed a shorter wait time and no persons waiting more than 28 days.  Overall \nthen, the Department did not consistently meet the time frames for inpatient competence \nevaluation.   \n   \n                                                        \n \n10 Fine amounts are tied to delays beyond each of the time frames listed.  However, these fines are \ndiscussed elsewhere in this report. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 36\nPage 15 \n \n \nAccording to CDHS reports, only a fraction of those defendants ordered for inpatient evaluation \nactually met the strict criteria for involuntary hospitalization (C.R.S. § 27-65-105).11  Specifically, \nCDHS reported that during the past 3 months, 50% of admissions for inpatient evaluation met \nthat strict “27-65” criteria for involuntary hospitalization.12  This contrasts with the earlier 20% \nrate, calculated when more defendants were sent to CMHIP for inpatient evaluation.  In most \nrespects, this is a positive trend: fewer defendants are sent for inpatient evaluation, and of that \nsmaller group more meet inpatient admission criteria.  That is, those ordered to the hospital \nwere more likely to be those who met criteria for hospitalization.  On the other hand, the \naverage wait time for admission is longer than before, and more people are waiting more than \n28 days before admission, a problem that becomes even more important if those delayed are \nthose patients who meet “27-65” criteria and likely need prompt hospitalization.   \n \n \n \n \n   \n                                                        \n \n11 C.R.S. § 27-65-105: (1)  Emergency procedure may be invoked under either one of the following two \nconditions: \n(a)(I)  When any person appears to have a mental health disorder and, as a result of such mental health \ndisorder, appears to be an imminent danger to others or to himself or herself or appears to be gravely \ndisabled, then an intervening professional, as specified in subsection (1)(a)(II) of this section, upon \nprobable cause and with such assistance as may be required, may take the person into custody, or cause \nthe person to be taken into custody, and placed in a facility designated or approved by the executive \ndirector for a seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation… \n(b)  Upon an affidavit sworn to or affirmed before a judge that relates sufficient facts to establish that a \nperson appears to have a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, appears \nto be an imminent danger to others or to himself or herself or appears to be gravely disabled, the court  \nmay order the person described in the affidavit to be taken into custody and placed in a facility \ndesignated or approved by the executive director for a seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation.     \n \n12 From the November 7, 2019 CDHS Monthly Compliance Plan Report (p.17). \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 36\nPage 16 \n \nWait Times for Inpatient Restoration   \n \nCompared to the timely inpatient evaluations, there are far more concerns regarding inpatient \nrestoration at CMHIP.  Over the past few years, wait times consistently exceeded the 30-day time \nframes mandated by an earlier Settlement Agreement.  However, the required time frames \nchanged as of June 1, 2019, per the Consent Decree.  The maximum time frame for many \ndefendants (those labeled as Tier 2) waiting in jails has been extended to 56 days.  The time \nframe for defendants with the most urgent clinical needs (those labeled Tier 1) is now only 7 \ndays.   \n \n \nRecent Wait Times for Inpatient Restoration13 \n \nMonth  Number of people  Average days waited  People who waited more \nadmitted to CMHIP for  for admission to  than the max days for \ninpatient restoration  CMHIP inpatient  admission to CMHIP \nrestoration  inpatient restoration \n  Tier 1           Tier 2  Tier 1           Tier 2  Tier 1            Tier 2 \n       \nOct 19  18                 62  3.7               94.5  0             * \n \nSep 19  14                 65  5.2               99.8  0             * \n \nAug 19  24                 39  3.2               80.8  0             * \n \nJun - Jul 19  10.5              51  3.64             87.2  1             * \n \nMar 19  41  61.6  32 \n       \n* CDHS has not provided in their monthly report the number of Tier 2 individuals who waited more than \nthe maximum allowable days for admission to CMHIP for restoration.  We have requested these data.   \n \nAs the table reveals, most of the defendants now designated as Tier 2 wait much longer than the \nrequired 56 days before admission.  For example, in October, a total of 62 Tier 2 individuals were \nadmitted to CMHIP, with their waiting time for admission averaging 94.5 days.  However, the \nmuch smaller group of patients designated as Tier 1 were admitted rapidly, consistent with the \nmandates of the Consent Decree.  In October, a total of 18 Tier 1 individuals were admitted to \nCMHIP, with their days waited prior to admission averaging 3.7 days.  To date, a total of 83 \nindividuals designated as Tier 1 have been admitted within 7 days of being adjudicated as ITP.14   \n \nAs noted in our last quarterly report, the Department’s rapid response to those identified as Tier \n1 is remarkable.  In many ways, the Tier 1 individuals are the highest priority for the Consent \nDecree and the CDHS competency system.  We are pleased that those whom CDHS categorized \nas Tier 1 were admitted rapidly.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 36\nPage 17 \n \nHowever, the progress towards meeting Tier 2 timelines remains problematic.  Tier 2 individuals \nare mandated to CMHIP, but with less urgency.  CMHIP has continued to nimbly create space for \nTier 1 individuals, inevitably by prioritizing them over Tier 2 individuals.  However, Tier 2 \nindividuals must also be admitted within certain time frames.  The only options for reducing their \nwait times are to create space for them in CMHIP (by reducing restoration lengths of stay or \ncreating new beds) or to transfer them to community-based treatment (if they are appropriate \nfor community treatment).  In short, while Tier 1 individuals must be prioritized for admission \n(thereby treating those who need it most), successful compliance with the Consent Decree must \nalso reduce Tier 2 time frames; such compliance will demonstrate that CDHS’ competency \nsystem has created adequate capacity for all levels of competency restoration.    \n \n \n \n   \n                                                        \n \n13 According to the Department’s Special Master Compliance Plan report October 2019 p.9-10 (submitted \nNovember 7, 2019). \n \n \n14 Some Tier 1 individuals admitted to CMHIP are not reflected in the table due to timing of admissions \n(primarily persons admitted in early November). \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 36\nPage 18 \n \nPERFORMANCE OF JAIL COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS \n \n33. (b) Performance of Jail Competency Evaluations.  The Department shall complete all Jail \nCompetency Evaluations of a Pretrial Detainee pursuant to the attached table (Table 1), after the \nDepartment’s receipt of a Court Order directing the evaluation and receipt of Collateral Materials.  \nThis timeframe requirement shall apply to the following counties: Adams, Alamosa, Arapahoe, \nBoulder, Broomfield, Crowley, Custer, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Elbert, Fremont, Huerfano, \nJefferson, Larimer, Mesa, Otero, Pueblo, Teller, and Weld.  Counties not specifically identified are \ncounties that use the “Hold and Wait” court ordered process.  Counties utilizing the Hold and Wait \nEvaluation process will be offered a meeting date within 30 days of the Department’s receipt of the \nCourt Order and Collateral Materials, and the evaluation will be completed within 30 days of the \nmeeting.  Beginning January 1, 2020, counties utilizing the Hold and Wait Evaluation process will be \noffered a meeting date within 30 days of the Department’s receipt of the Court Order and Collateral \nMaterials, and the evaluation will be completed within 14 days of the meeting.   \nThe mandated time limit for a jail-based evaluation is now 28 days, per the Consent Decree.  \nAccording to data they provided, the Department once again achieved almost perfect \ncompliance with this time frame.15   \n \nWhile we affirm their success in meeting these timelines, we also have growing concerns about \nhow they have met the timelines, and whether they will be able to continue to do so.  \nSpecifically,  \n \n•  Evaluation referrals are beginning to exceed the capacity of the current workforce, and \nthe Department is for the first time in recent history likely to fail to meet evaluation time \nframes. \n \n•  Indeed, meeting the time frames in the manner they have been appears unsustainable.  \nOur recent review of sample reports and monthly workloads among evaluators has made \nit clear that the Department’s success in meeting timelines has been possible by greatly \nover-relying on one particularly prolific evaluator.  This evaluator (who is also employed \nin another role in a CDHS facility) contracts to complete a grossly disproportionate \nnumber of evaluations, even compared to the full-time employee evaluators, and his \nreports are of disproportionately poor quality.  While we understand the apparent \nbenefit that this contractor provides (in terms of raw numbers and meeting deadlines) \nwe believe the risks of this arrangement far outweigh the benefits.  We have emphasized \nto the Department that this evaluator should be completing far fewer evaluations of far \nhigher quality.  It will be crucial to replace this arrangement with one that relies on \nreasonable workloads and demands higher quality.16     \n                                                        \n \n15 Data taken from the November 7, 2019 CDHS Monthly Compliance Plan Report covering October \n(p.20).   \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 36\nPage 19 \n \n \n•  Another challenge in maintaining a strong workforce of evaluators involves morale (as we \ndiscussed in our prior report).  In general, CDHS evaluators have expressed frustration \nwith the ways in which CDHS administration implemented the recent changes in \nevaluations that were mandated by the Consent Decree and SB19-223.  Evaluators \ncomplained that implementation has been hasty, ill-defined, and neglected evaluator \nexpertise.  In many respects, we are sympathetic to the evaluators’ frustrations.  We are \npleased to report that the Department has (albeit belatedly), begun to better enlist \nevaluator expertise and support supervisors in training roles.  These significant changes \nseem to have improved morale, but the relationship between administration and \nevaluators has been tenuous.  Continued repair to this relationship will be crucial to \nrecruiting and retaining the type of evaluator workforce that the Department will need to \nmaintain compliance with evaluation time frames.   \n \n•  To their credit, the Department recognizes that their capacity to meet these evaluation \ntimelines is tenuous and will require rapid efforts to recruit new employees and \ncontractors. They have begun to explore evaluator pay and recruitment strategies in \nother states. Unfortunately, their past recruitment efforts have appeared only marginally \nsuccessful.  When we interviewed a sample of evaluators who have undergone (or \nwithdrawn from) the Department’s hiring process, it became clear that the process was \nmarked by lengthy delays, mixed-messages, and other process flaws that greatly \ndiscourage the qualified evaluators they would most like to recruit.  Some of these flaws \nare described as “bureaucracy” or “bureaucratic delays,” and appear located more in \nCDHS Human Resources or other departments than in the clinical leadership, but some \nwere clearly within the control of clinical leadership.  It will be crucial for the clinical \nleadership to address all of these barriers to hiring in order to recruit a sufficient \nworkforce for timely evaluations.      \n   \n•  In particular, on July 1, 2020, the new time frame for jail-based evaluations will decrease \nto 21 days.  The Department must produce data well in advance of this change to \ndetermine how many additional evaluators they will need to hire in order to meet this \nshortened deadline.  Their analysis should occur soon enough to adjust the budget and \nsecure funding to hire these additional positions (again, we are encouraged to see they \nhave recently begun exploring evaluator salaries in other states).  Our understanding is \nthat the Department has been planning (for many months) a “time study” of evaluator \nworkloads and time required, but we encourage them to proceed as soon as possible.  \nData from the past week suggests that the Department may be missing some evaluation \ndeadlines for the first time in many months, so prompt efforts to assess and increase the \ncapacity of their workforce will be crucial. \n                                                        \n \n16 To be clear, our ongoing reviews of reports from CDHS full-time Court Services evaluators continues to \nconfirm our impressions that the quality of reports among full-time evaluators is generally quite strong.  \nThe poor quality reports from this prolific evaluator are a clear outlier.   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 36\nPage 20 \n \n \nOverall, we affirm the Department for their generally consistent compliance with evaluation time \nframes.  However, the more we have investigated the evaluation workforce and services, the \nmore it becomes clear that their compliance with this timeframe is tenuous.  This compliance is \nunlikely to be sustainable without aggressive improvements to the workforce.   \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 36\nPage 21 \n \n \nINTERIM JAIL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT17  \n \n34.

This paragraph does not toll or otherwise modify the Department’s \nobligation to Offer Admission to the Pretrial Detainees for Inpatient Restoration Treatment.  Interim \nJail Mental Health Treatment shall not replace or be used as a substitute for Inpatient Restoration \nTreatment but does not preclude the Department from providing Restoration Treatment.  A member \nof the Forensic Support Team shall report to the Court Liaison every 10 days concerning the clinical \nstatus and progress towards competency of the Pretrial Detainee.   \nAs we have discussed in prior reports, the Department is required to partner with county jails to \ndevelop a program of coordinated services for individuals receiving competency-related services.  \nThese services are currently managed statewide through the Jail-Based Behavioral Services \nprogram (JBBS) and are funded approximately $2.5 million per year by the recently appropriated \nby SB19-223.  Essentially, the Department utilizes JBBS as a hub for coordinating subcontracted \nservices across Colorado.  These subcontracted providers are now asked to provide adequate \nmental health services to inmates involved with competency-related services.  Interim mental \nhealth treatment is critical to screen, monitor, assess, and treat those receiving competency-\nrelated services in county jails so that they remain physically safe and clinically stable until their \ntransfer to competency restoration services.   \n \nHowever, the structure of JBBS creates some challenges.  Because the JBBS-subcontracted \nproviders differ across counties and jurisdictions, no two providers are alike, and their services \ndiffer.  Some providers have strong connections with local and private inpatient hospitalization \nfacilities, while others have weaker ties.  Workforce and qualifications also differ among \nproviders.  This poses some challenges for CDHS; while individualized services are enhanced \ngiven the local nature of the providers within JBBS, uniformity and leverage across providers are \nmore difficult.   \n \nSince our last quarterly report, all but one county have expressed interest in receiving funding \nfor enhanced mental health services.  These good developments result from direct, \nindividualized outreach from Ms. Shah and Dr. Werthwein (OBH Director) to the few remaining \nsheriff’s offices.  Further, OBH prepared a document that lists the scope of OBH-contracted \n                                                        \n \n17 “Interim Jail Mental Health Treatment” means mental health treatment of a Pretrial Detainee that is \nperformed in the County Jail where the Pretrial Detainee is held while the Pretrial Detainee awaits \nCommunity-Based or Inpatient Restoration Treatment per Court Order consistent with the time frames in \nthe Consent Decree.  It is NOT a proxy or substitute for competency restoration services.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 36\nPage 22 \n \nservices within each county jail statewide; a review of this document is similarly encouraging in \nthat nearly all county jails are providing OBH-supported enhanced mental health services (or are \nin contract negotiations to do so).   \n \nHowever, significant challenges remain.  These contracts with county jails embody a wide variety \nof depth and breadth of services.  There is little uniformity among the contracts.  Moreover, OBH \nhas very little leverage over these services aside from the contract.  Quality of services, \nfrequency of communication, and fidelity to expectations are rather loosely assured without a \nstringent contracting and quality management oversight.  Unfortunately, OBH has few resources \nto provide this oversight, so in reality the actual mental health services available in county jails \ncould be inadequate.  OBH has proposed to develop an “inter-agency agreement” which would \nallow for more oversight and more flexibility in service changes, rather than utilizing individual \ncontracts; although supported by both DLC and the Special Masters, such an agreement will not \nbe ready before March 2020.   \n \nMany of these concerns about quality, frequency, and intensity of mental health services are \nhighlighted by the recent suicide in Pitkin County Jail.  At least based on initial investigation, \nthere appear to be substantial concerns about the response to the deceased’s mental health \nneeds from both the Pitkin County sheriff’s office and their third-party mental health provider.  \nThese concerns only heighten the need to ensure quality and adequacy of mental health services \nand responses in county jails.  We have appreciated and supported the Department’s response \nsince that incident, but are somewhat dismayed at what appears to be a patchwork approach to \njails’ mental health services across the state.  We understand that without statutory change, \nOBH has little ability to truly enforce certain standards in county jail mental health services.  \nNevertheless, OBH is ultimately responsible for the quality and adequacy of interim jail mental \nhealth treatment and must use any available leverage to ensure that these defendants are \nreceiving necessary services.   \n \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 36\nPage 23 \n \nRELEASE OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION \nTREATMENT18 \n \n35. Release of Pretrial Detainees for Community-Based Restoration Treatment.  If the court releases \nthe Pretrial Detainee on bond to commence Community-Based Restoration Treatment, the \nDepartment shall coordinate with the Court Liaison to develop a discharge plan (in a format approved \nby the Special Master) within seven days of the order to all parties involved in the Community-Based \nServices Recipient’s case, and the Court Liaison and community-based provider.   \nThe Department has made further progress on the requirement to develop discharge plans for \npersons identified as appropriate for Community-Based Restoration Treatment (CBRT).  Progress \nis clear — and important work remains — in three areas: \n \n1.  Pilot project in CMHIP: CMHIP has identified between 5-10 patients currently treated at \nCMHIP that could potentially transition to CBRT in the near future.  While still unrestored, \ntheir improved clinical status and minimal public safety concerns make them more \nappropriate for release to CBRT, rather than staying at CMHIP.  We affirm the \nDepartment taking this initiative and fully support the transition when appropriate.  To \ndate, however, no such transitions have occurred.  CMHIP administrators have begun \nactively working on these cases; we anticipate that at least a few currently incompetent \ndefendants will transition from CMHIP to CBRT before our next quarterly report, and that \nthis type of “step down” approach may be one way to decrease length of stay in the \nhospital and allow for more rapid admissions from the waitlist.   \n \n2.  Impact of the Forensic Support Team (FST):  As detailed in our January 2019 response to \nthe Department’s plan for compliance, we envisioned multiple roles for the FST.  \nPrimarily, the FST was meant to monitor clinical and restoration progress for \nincompetent defendants in county jails awaiting transfer to CMHIP.  Secondarily, three \nother roles were described: monitoring and coordinating cases in CBRT, facilitating \ntransfers from jail to CBRT when appropriate, and serving as the point of contact for \ncaseloads regardless of restoration location.   \n \nTo date, OBH has focused on the first role but has given less attention to the other roles.  \nFST navigators have spent most of their time working with cases either in jails or in \nCMHIP.  FST navigators have monitored clinical status and restoration progress for those \nin jails awaiting transfer to CMHIP — primarily defendants who have been categorized as \nTier 2.  Navigators have also worked with CMHIP to begin facilitating transfer of \nincompetent defendants to CBRT, though (as detailed above) no such transfers have yet \n                                                        \n \n18 “Community-Based Restoration Treatment” means Restoration Treatment of a Community-Based \nRecipient that is ordered to be performed out of custody and in conjunction with a community-based \nmental health center or community organization. \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 36\nPage 24 \n \noccurred.  Navigators have also reportedly been effective in securing emergency holds, \nemergency transfers, and engaging in other crisis responses for a handful of cases.  We \naffirm this important work.   \n \nHowever, we must also note our concerns about the FST.  First, the launch and \nimplementation of the FST was slow.  The navigators were hired in August, yet they had \nnot uniformly begun formal monitoring of jail-based defendants until November.  We \nappreciate the Department’s careful on-boarding of the team; their initial two-week \ntraining was thorough, comprehensive, and reasonably paced.  However, implementation \nof the team since then seemed unnecessarily delayed.  The Department described \nbarriers such as lack of computers and other resources as reasons for the slow \nimplementation, but the reality is that many incarcerated defendants needed OBH \nmonitoring during the implementation period.  We are pleased that the team of \nnavigators has now begun their required frequency of contacts as mandated by the \nConsent Decree, and we are beginning to hear positive accounts of their work as a result.  \n \nSecond, we have some concerns about the allocation of FST navigator responsibilities.  \nNavigators are working almost exclusively with in-jail defendants, which leaves no \nopportunity to attend to defendants transitioning to the community for CBRT.  We agree \nthat the priority for navigators must be those defendants who remain in custody.  Those \ndefendants are, as a group, most at risk for crisis.  The Consent Decree mandates that \nnavigators monitor these in-jail defendants at least once every ten days for clinical status \nand restoration progress; this monitoring addresses our third overarching goal of \nreducing harm to those on the waitlist.  However, other goals of the Consent Decree are \nto reduce the number of persons on the waitlist and reduce the time spent on the \nwaitlist.  These goals are supported by facilitating transitions to CBRT and enhancing \nCBRT services.  Navigators should play critical roles in both.  Navigators should identify \nTier 2 defendants who have clinically stabilized while in jail and actively work with \nstakeholders to transition them to CBRT services.  Perhaps more importantly, navigators \nshould be the Department’s “face” of restoration in the community — a visible expert in \nthe restoration system who serves as the OBH point of contact whenever needs are \nidentified.  By serving as the Department’s restoration experts in the community, \nnavigators increase restoration success, troubleshoot problems, address crisis situations, \nenhance community tenure, and help skeptical judges trust the Department’s \ncommunity-based restoration services.   \n \nThe Department has, in general, agreed to these broad roles for navigators, but \nmaintains that current workloads and staffing ratios preclude much community \nengagement by the FST navigators.  Acknowledging that initial staff workload projections \nwere probably inadequate, we will: 1) more explicitly describe our vision for the \ncommunity role for FST navigators, and 2) work with the Department to request funding \nto support such a team.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 36\nPage 25 \n \nWe are also keenly aware that all reports of FST navigators to date have been anecdotal \nin nature.  There is no data dissemination system yet in place.  We have offered expertise \nin data collection, analysis, and dissemination given our first-hand experience with such \nprograms and their data systems in other states, yet OBH has been slow in \noperationalizing such a data system for the FST.  We strongly encourage the \ndevelopment of a data-driven system for the FST.   \n \nFinally, we acknowledge the impact of the Pitkin County suicide on the FST.  Since that \nsuicide, the FST was mandated to meet with every in-custody defendant statewide within \nthree days of the announcement.  This has occurred, which we again affirm as critically \nimportant progress.  Additionally, OBH has created a decision tree for how often \nsubsequent contacts must be face-to-face versus by telephone with treatment and/or jail \nproviders.  Certain circumstances merit face-to-face visits; these criteria were tentatively \naffirmed by DLC.  A formal document outlining this drafted plan is forthcoming, the \nDepartment reports.  We will provide our feedback to OBH and report on progress in our \nnext quarterly report; we anticipate that such a document could easily lend itself to some \ndata collection (e.g., timeliness of monitoring of in-custody defendants by FST navigators, \nif such monitoring is telephonic or face-to-face, what if any outcomes result from these \ncontacts, clinical status and restoration progress, etc.).  \n \n3.  Coordination with the Bridges program: The State Court began their Bridges program in \n2018, using “court-liaisons” to help address the needs of persons with mental illness in \ncriminal court settings.  While most of their cases involve competency, Bridges liaisons \nare not uniformly assigned to all competency cases.  But, ideally the FST and Bridges \nprogram act in a complementary manner to address the needs of persons needing \ncompetency-related services.   \n \nAs mentioned in our previous quarterly report, the Bridges Program and FST must work \ntogether to facilitate discharge and share responsibilities for competency-related cases.  \nThey both rely on similar (partially, but not entirely, overlapping) bodies of information.  \nThus, the Department and the Bridges team have been actively working to coordinate \nservices, so that they can ultimately collaborate in a way that minimizes redundancies \nand gaps.  We recognize that two similar, relatively new programs will inevitably face role \nconfusion and “start up” challenges.  Overall, we are pleased with the progress thus far in \nthis communication and collaboration.  FST and Bridges representatives have jointly \nproduced documents that outline responsibilities of each program; while some \ninaccuracies and areas of confusion seem to persist, their interaction has been fruitful in \nboth tone and outcome.  Additionally, Bridges liaisons and supervisors have identified \nand communicated gaps and problems to OBH and to us; this allows us to follow up on \nspecific problems for which we may have otherwise been unaware.  Some of these \nsituations are quite dire — suicides of persons in competency-related services — so we \nare quite grateful for this information from Bridges representatives, and encourage even \nmore open communication between Bridges and OBH.   \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 36\nPage 26 \n \nTRANSPORTATION OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES  \n \n36. Transportation of Pretrial Detainees.  If a Pretrial Detainee is transported to the Hospital for an \nInpatient Competency Evaluation and the Department or a medical professional opines that the \nPretrial Detainee is incompetent and the provisions of C.R.S.  § 27-65-125 have been met, the \nDepartment shall not transport the Pretrial Detainee back to his/her originating jail.   \nOver the past quarter, a total of 16 defendants were admitted to CMHIP for an inpatient \ncompetency evaluation, of whom only eight met C.R.S. § 27-65-125 criteria, according to \nhospital staff.19  None of these defendants who met civil commitment criteria were returned to a \nlocal jail.20   \n   \nAs mentioned in previous quarterly reports, SB19-223 included language that allows CMHIP to \nkeep defendants ordered for inpatient evaluation at CMHIP from the time that the evaluator \nopines them incompetent to proceed (rather than requiring C.R.S. § 27-65-125 criteria be met, \nor that the originating court adjudicates the defendant as incompetent).  This is now found in \nC.R.S. § 16-8.5-105 (IV-b-5) and reads as follows:  \n \nWhen the court orders an inpatient evaluation, the court shall advise the defendant that \nrestoration services may commence immediately if the evaluation concludes that the \ndefendant is incompetent to proceed, unless either party objects at the time of the \nadvisement, or within 72 hours after the receipt of the written evaluation submitted to the \ncourt. \n \nPolicies and procedures governing the decision-making in these circumstances are still in \ndevelopment.  At times, CMHIP may need to balance these incompetent individuals already in \nthe hospital and in need of hospital-level care with those Tier 1 or Tier 2 defendants in county \njails approaching their deadlines for admission.  To date, decisions among these individuals have \nbeen made primarily on clinical grounds, but we also understand the need to admit individuals \nwho have been waiting in county jails for extended periods of time.  Discussions among OBH and \nDLC have been amiable and productive in these challenging situations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \n \n19 According to the October Special Master Compliance Report (p.24), submitted by CDHS on November \n7, 2019.   \n \n20 See the Department’s monthly report (p.16) filed November 7, 2019. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 36\nPage 27 \n \nNOTIFICATION OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH TIME FRAMES  \n \n38. Notification of Non-Compliance with Timeframes.  The Department shall notify the Special \nMaster and DLC weekly regarding any non-compliance with timeframes.   \n(a) Only one notice per Pretrial Detainee shall be provided and should include: (i) The name of the \nPretrial Detainee; (ii)  The Pretrial Detainee’s location; (iii)  The Pretrial Detainee’s charges based on \ninformation available to the Department; (iv) The Pretrial Detainee’s bond amount based on \ninformation available to the Department; (v) Whether a forensic assessment has been made on \nwhether restoration in the community is appropriate; (vi) Whether the Pretrial Detainee has \npreviously been found incompetent; (vii) What efforts are being made to provide timely Competency \nServices to the Pretrial Detainee, including communications with the court, Court Liaisons, and \ncommunity mental health providers;  \n(b) The Department shall accompany its Monthly Data Report (see Paragraph 52) with a separate \n“Fines Report” which will include the names of the Pretrial Detainees for whom the Department has \naccrued a fine during the preceding month, the number of days each Pretrial Detainee waited in the \nCounty Jails past the timeframes for compliance, and the total fines owed by the Department for the \npreceding month.   \n(c) The Department shall pay the total fines owed on the date the Fines Report is submitted to the \nSpecial Master to be deposited in a trust account created for the purpose of funding non-Department \nmental health services.  The account will be managed by a court-appointed administrator.  Decisions \nconcerning payments out of the account will be made by a committee consisting of a representative \nfrom the Plaintiff, a representative from the Department, and the Special Master.  Any disputes \nregarding the fines shall be handled through the dispute resolution process identified in Paragraph 59.   \n \n \nThe Department has continued to provide reliable notification of non-compliance of time frames \non a weekly basis, as required by the Consent Decree (since June 1, 2019).  Likewise, the \nDepartment has completed a “Fines Report,” as prescribed by the Consent Decree.  Finally, as \nprescribed by the Consent Decree, the Department has been paying these fines into a trust \naccount (managed by Cordes & Company, LLP).   \n \nThe funds from these fines are already going to good use.   A small committee comprising \nDepartment administration (Worthwein, Scofidio), a representative from the Plaintiff (i.e., \nDisability Law Colorado leader, Ivandick), and the Special Masters has met regularly for several \nmonths to address use of these fines.  The broad goal is to use the funds in ways that help those \ninvolved in the mental health and criminal justice systems (i.e., those who are, or are likely to \nbecome, involved in competency-related services), and to reduce Colorado’s “competency \ncrisis,” by providing new services of interventions that do not already fall within the \nDepartment’s responsibilities.  In other words, funds from the fines should supplement and not \nreplace existing services.   \n \nThe first opportunity to use these funds for prompt services emerged through a collaboration \nwith the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless (CCH), which was renovating a hotel to create \nFusion Studios, which comprise 182 single-unit residences for homeless individuals.  Because \nCCH has a strong record of fiscal responsibility and successful housing interventions, the \nDepartment explored a collaboration to dedicate new residences to those involved in the \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 36\nPage 28 \n \ncompetency system, particularly defendants who could be eligible for community-based \ncompetence restoration if they had access to housing (a lack of housing is a common barrier to \noutpatient restoration treatment).  Ultimately, in an arrangement finalized on October 2, 2019, \nthe Fines Committee contributed $3.5 million to the Fusion Studio project, in exchange for 28 \ndedicated residences for competence-involved individuals whom the Department refers, over \nthe next five years.  Because the project involved renovations to an existing hotel (rather than \nnew construction) this housing will become available at a remarkably rapid pace; the \nDepartment should be able to refer occupants in December, and will target those who are ready \nto transition out of the hospital and continue restoration services in the community. \n \nThough the Fines Committee has not finalized the next funding priorities, the Committee is \ninvestigating a pilot test of a “competency docket” or “competency calendar” in a Colorado \nDistrict.  We have researched and consulted with other jurisdictions around the country, and it is \nclear competency-specific dockets offer a number of advantages to courts and defendants, and \ntend to expedite competency-related procedures in ways would help defendants and the \nDepartment waitlists.  Furthermore, Judges in Colorado’s 18th Judicial District are highly \nmotivated to establish a competency docket.  This initiative would use a fairly small fraction of \nthe fines funds; the District does not anticipate any funding requests for the judges or clerks, but \nwould like court-based clinicians to aid in the processes.  The planning is still underway; we \nanticipate this will be our next high priority for funding, and likely make a significant contribution \nto expediting competency-related services in this District (and likely beyond, to the extent this \nserves as a model for other Districts to replicate). \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 36\nPage 29 \n \nCONSENT DECREE SECTION VII UPDATES \n \nCIVIL BED FREEZE \n \n39. Civil Bed Freeze.  The Department’s 2018 Plan included an effort to freeze civil admissions to its \nbeds to devote Hospital beds to perform Inpatient Restoration Treatment services.  On February 7, \n2019, the Department agreed to stop this practice.  The Department will continue to leave the state’s \ncivil and juvenile beds allocated as of the execution of this Consent Decree for civil and juvenile \npsychiatric admissions and will not freeze or convert those beds to provide competency services for \nPretrial Detainees, unless the Department receives prior agreement from the Special Master to use \nunutilized beds for such purposes.  This strategy to facilitate compliance with the Consent Decree \nshall only be re-implemented in the future upon agreement of the Special Master.   \nThe Department continues to report that they have removed the “civil bed freeze” as mandated \nby the Consent Decree.  That is, they have not re-purposed the civil beds at CMHIFL for \ncompetence restoration, as they had once proposed.  Per our request, the Department \ncontinues to provide a census report on the CMHIFL patients in their monthly report.  As of their \nmost recent report, the CMHIFL population included a total of 94 patients, 90 of whom were civil \npatients.  Although four patients had a forensic status, the Department has explained these \nspecial circumstances to the Plaintiff and the Special Master, and provided reasonable \njustification in the monthly report.  All parties have agreed these reflect reasonable exceptions.  \nMost recently, all Parties agreed to allow CMHIFL to serve as a setting for certain one-day \ncompetency evaluations, provided that the defendant does not require admission.   \n \nDuring monthly multi-party meetings, the Department has discussed any potential changes to \nthe use of any CMHIFL beds (e.g., allocating a few new beds at CMHIFL to accommodate \ninpatient competence evaluations — not restoration — which may reduce the need to transport \nDenver-area defendants to CMHIP for inpatient evaluation).  Generally, the Plaintiffs and Special \nMasters have agreed with the minor changes they have proposed, because these tend to reflect \nefficient steps that better serve the Departments’ consumers.    \n \nFor the foreseeable future, the Department will continue to wrestle with the reality that too few \ncivil beds exist in Colorado.  A potential, albeit indirect, benefit of the Consent Decree may be to \nincrease civil capacity through the reduced need for forensic beds; the Department will need to \ncontinue to monitor this trend and the outcomes of Consent Decree initiatives to determine the \nongoing and future needs for civil beds.   \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 36\nPage 30 \n \nCOMPREHENSIVE AND COHESIVE PLAN \n \n40. Comprehensive and Cohesive Plan.  The Special Master’s first recommendation was to revise the \nDepartment’s 2018 Plan into a more comprehensive and cohesive plan.  Dkt. 146.  By or about \nJanuary 2020, the Department will produce an initial plan resulting from a long-term visioning \nprocess with DLC, the Special Master, and stakeholders that will consolidate disparate pieces of the \nDepartment’s current plan, along with legislative initiatives, in a cohesive package for courts, \nadministrators, service providers, and legislators to consider.  As referenced in the Special Master’s \nRecommendation Number 7, the 2020 Plan will highlight the methods to prioritize quality amid \nquantity and time pressures.  Dkt. 146 at 42.  On an annual basis thereafter, the Department will \nreview and revise the plan as appropriate based upon data provided by the Department.   \nThe Department continues to move closer to developing a comprehensive, cohesive plan.  The \nfinal plan is due to be submitted in January 2020.  As we detailed in our last quarterly report, the \nDepartment has taken substantial steps to:  \n \n1.  Coordinate and align policies and services within a long-term vision for competency-\nrelated services, and \n \n2.  Ensure that their emerging plan is supported by, and integrated with, statutory \nimprovements and efforts from other stakeholders regarding competency services.  \nIndeed, they have shared the preliminary plan with the Governor’s Blueprint Task Force \nsubcommittee that is addressing competence-related issues.   \n \nThe Department has continued developing the plan through the efforts detailed in our previous \nquarterly report (i.e., various internal meetings, specific coordination initiatives, participation in \nthe Governor’s blueprint taskforce committee, etc.).  We affirm these efforts and encourage \nthem to continue.   \n \nAlong with these important accomplishments, we see the following as important, remaining next \nsteps towards a “Comprehensive, Cohesive Plan” for the Department to take in the near future: \n \n•  Write the plan.  The final, written plan is due in January 2020, though it will be important \nto share drafts with us and other stakeholders before then.  The written plan should \ninclude an articulation of the larger vision for competency services in Colorado, along \nwith specific goals.  It should also include descriptions of the components of the \ncompetency services system, policies and protocols, a glossary, desired outcomes, and \nvisual representations of the entire system (described below) and the smaller component \nparts.   \n \n•  Create a visual representation of the new competency services system.  This should be a \n1-2 page representation of how the different components are integrated and \ninterconnected.  It should be tailored to a lay audience, so that stakeholders outside the \nDepartment can see the system, see where they fit into the system, and understand the \ncontext for their functions and roles in the system.   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 36\nPage 31 \n \n \n \n•  Educating all stakeholders, both within and outside of the Department.  As we have \nemphasized in prior reports and in discussions with the Department, it is crucial for \nDepartment employees and stakeholders to understand the changing system in which \nthey work.  It will be important to continue educating evaluators, hospital staff, the bar, \nand the judiciary about recent and emerging changes. \n \n•  Plan for 2020 legislative session.  Inevitably, SB19-222 and SB19-223 will require \nadjustment as they are implemented.  The Department must collect outcome data for \neach bill and begin making drafted adjustments to both bills in late 2019 / early 2020.  \nFurthermore, the Department should continue their recent exploration of other potential \nlegislation that may improve competency services and better address the population of \nindividuals likely to be involved in the competency system.  To date, potential legislation \nincludes increasing OBH oversight regarding jail-based mental health services, decreasing \ncompetency mandates for lowest-level offenders, and adjusting competency re-\nevaluation time frames. \n \n•  Refine workloads and expectations within new programs.  Analogously, the new \nDepartment programs (triage, CBRT, data team) will require careful monitoring of \noutcomes so that necessary adjustments can be made.  Adjustments might include \nrevised workloads for Court Service evaluators, jurisdictions for FST Navigators, contracts \nfor CBRT providers, intensity of JBBS services for defendants at various stages of the \ncompetency process, and so on.  Additional positions will almost certainly be needed \nover time (i.e., more Court Service evaluators and FST community navigators).  In short, \nthe Department is launching many promising initiatives; all of these are new and \ncomplicated enough that they will inevitably require close observation and fine-tuning.   \n \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 36\nPage 32 \n \n \nINCREASE COMMUNITY RESTORATION SERVICES \n \n41. (a) Implement a coordinated wide-scale outpatient (community-based) competency restoration \n(OCR) system.  This system shall be integrated and submitted with the “Comprehensive and \nCohesive Plan” referenced in Paragraph 40 herein.  This plan shall be approved by the Special \nMaster.   \nAs in our past quarterly report, the Department continues to progress in developing a wide-scale \noutpatient, community-based restoration treatment program (CBRT).  Their formal CBRT \nprogram began in March of 2018, and referrals for outpatient restoration have ranged from 42-\n46 defendants per month during the past quarter (an increase from the prior quarter).  Although \nwe hope to see these referrals — in particular, the proportion of defendants referred for CBRT \n(detailed in 41(c) below) — continue to increase, we perceive the Department maintaining \nmeaningful steps towards further CBRT: \n   \n•  The Department has increasingly established contracts with the community mental \nhealth centers (nearly all of them, at this point) to provide CBRT. \n \n•  The Department increasingly considers and describes outpatient restoration the default \napproach for restoration, unless there is clear reason for inpatient restoration.  Simply \nshifting the “default setting” (particularly as evaluators and judges understand it) will \nhelp to increase community-based restoration, and decrease unnecessary inpatient \nadmissions.   \n \n•  Pilot project in Denver County: The Department has allocated $500,000 to Mental Health \nCenter of Denver (MHCD) and Denver Pre-trial Services to establish a pilot program that \nbolsters case management, treatment, and supervision in order to expand CBRT in the \nDenver metro area.  Though a pilot program, this type of targeted intervention in such a \nhigh-need area may be sufficient, even by itself, to influence waiting list and wait time \nfigures for the state.  The Department reports that the project began a “soft launch” two \nweeks ago with three referrals through Denver District Court.  They are waiting to see if \nthose three referrals are accepted by the court’s pre-trial services branch; more referrals \nare expected to begin next week and will expand to the Denver County Court.  We \nanticipate this pilot will be an important demonstration project for CBRT.   \n \nAlong with these important accomplishments, we see the following as important, remaining next \nsteps for the Department to take in the near future.  Unfortunately, these recommendations \nremain virtually unchanged from our last quarterly report, emphasizing the need for attention: \n \n•  Continue educating evaluators, the defense bar, and the courts that CBRT is available, \nand should be considered the default option. \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 36\nPage 33 \n \n•  Further train evaluators, who must soon include recommendations for restoration \nlocation (inpatient or outpatient) in the conclusion of any report that opines a defendant \nis not competent.  Evaluators will need to better understand the CBRT system, and \nbecome reliable with one another (i.e., offering similar opinions in similar cases) in \nrecommending CBRT versus inpatient restoration.   \n \n•  Provide to the Special Masters requested data on CBRT process and outcomes.  Such \ndata will be important for quality assurance, improving services, and further planning.   \n \n \n 41. (b) The Department may utilize private hospital beds to meet the needs of Pretrial Detainees \nmeeting C.R.S. § 27-65-105(a) civil commitment criteria and with prioritization to Pretrial Detainees \nalready residing within the same geographic location.  The Department shall create a plan to \nimplement this subsection (b) to be approved by the Special Master.   \nThe Department has contracted with a local hospital to provide five inpatient beds for short-\nterm competency related services.  These beds are currently filled.  OBH is close to finalizing a \ncontract with an additional private hospital in the Denver metro area for three additional beds.   \n \n \n41. (c) The Department currently estimates that 10-20% of Pretrial Detainees admitted for inpatient \nrestoration do not need hospital-level care.  Dkt. 146 at 29.  The Department will make best efforts to \nreduce inpatient restoration hospitalizations by 10% and increase community restorations by 10% in \nsix-month increments beginning June 1, 2019.  The baseline for the preceding sentence will be \ndetermined by the Special Master by June 1, 2019, utilizing data provided by the Department.  On \nJune 1, 2020, the Special Master will establish a modification of this guideline based upon a survey of \nthe data collection and implementation of the Department’s Plan. \nAs prescribed in the Consent Decree, we established a Baseline for improvement, by calculating \nthe most recent six-month period of available data (i.e., Nov 2018 – April 2019) prior to the June \n1, 2019 deadline.  We also recommend using proportional metrics when pursuing goals that are \nfundamentally proportional in nature (i.e., a 10% increase in community-based restoration and a \n10% decrease in inpatient restoration).  In other words, while the Department may not have full \ncontrol over the actual number of referrals, they have greater control over the proportion of \nreferrals they direct to outpatient versus inpatient restoration.  Therefore, we chose to set the \nbaseline figures, and establish subsequent performance goals, based on proportions instead of \nraw numbers.  Thus, calculating target goals for restoration based on these percentages of \nindividuals referred to inpatient versus outpatient services yields the following goals: \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 36\nPage 34 \n \n     \nInpatient Restorations  Outpatient Restorations \n \n     \nBaseline (past 6 months)  Recent 6-month average: 69%  Recent 6-month average: 31% \n   \nDecember 1, 2019 goal  69% reduced by 10% = 62%  31% increased by 10% = 34% \n   \nJune 1, 2020 goal  62% reduced by 10% = 56%  34% increased by 10% = 37% \n \nNote: All percentages rounded to nearest 1%. \n \nTherefore, the December 1, 2019 performance goal to reduce inpatient restoration by 10% and \nincrease outpatient restoration by 10% should yield no more than 62% of defendants referred \nfor inpatient restoration and no less than 34% of defendants referred for outpatient \n(community-based) restoration.    \n \nAs of this quarter (i.e., preceding November 28, 2019), the portion of defendants referred to \nCBRT has averaged 32.2%, which was an improvement over the last quarter.21  Indeed, the \nDepartment has met (or nearly met) the 34% proportion for several individual months.  The goal \nis to reach 34% as a six-month average by December 2019.  We anticipate they will meet, or \ncome quite close to meeting, this goal if their current trend continues. \n \nWe are hopeful that the Department will be very close to compliance with Paragraph 41 of the \nConsent Decree by increasing outpatient restoration to 34%, on average, for the period spanning \nJune 1, 2019 through December 1, 2019.  Aside from a few months of lower referral \npercentages, most months were well within the 34% mark.  We continue to view this aspirational \ngoal as largely reasonable.  However, we must mention a caveat to this goal in light of recent \nevents.  We were alerted to two completed suicides and at least two successful interventions of \nsuicidal individuals, all of whom were involved in CBRT services within the past several months.  \nClearly these situations must be taken seriously.  We have requested all relevant records and \ndocumentation for each of these situations so that we can properly investigate and understand \nthe context for each.  In addition, we have requested death and suicide rates for CBRT \nparticipants overall, so we can compare these rates against normative rates for all OBH clients.   \n \nRegardless of normative rates, however, no suicide is ever tolerable.  OBH must ensure that \nreferrals for the CBRT system are appropriate and well-informed; court services evaluators, FST \nnavigators, and CMHIP discharge planners must all be thoroughly informed about the CBRT \nsystem, its resources, and the persons best served by it.  Additionally, CBRT services must be \nrobust and nimble enough to identify persons in crisis and manage their emergency needs \nquickly and effectively.  Without the aforementioned requested records, we cannot comment on \n                                                        \n \n21 This has increased from the 28.8% six-month average at the time of our prior quarterly report. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 36\nPage 35 \n \neither of these two components in this report.  We will have more information for our next \nquarterly report.   \n \nHowever, at a minimum, we strongly encourage the Department to self-assess which \nparticipants are appropriately positioned for success in the CBRT system, and only refer those \ntypes of persons to the program.  If that referral rate is ultimately less than 34% of the total \nnumber found ITP, we support lowering the aspirational goal accordingly.  We aim to place the \nmaximum number of appropriate persons in CBRT, but are not wedded to a predetermined rate \nif that rate cannot safely manage all persons within it.   \n \nAlso, we reinforce the need for OBH to provide outcome data on CBRT.  We have requested this \noutcome data for several months and have met with CBRT administrators multiple times during \nthe past six months to develop outcome variables.  Although OBH has many concurrent data \nrequests, we continue to strongly request empirical outcome data for CBRT (and the FST, as \nmentioned earlier).   \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 180   Filed 11/27/19   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 36\nPage 36 \n \n \n   \nCONCLUSION \n \nAs detailed throughout this report, we perceive the Department has made significant and \nmeaningful progress in enacting changes prescribed in the Consent Decree.  Indeed, several key \ninterventions prescribed by the Consent Decree (e.g., the triage system, the Forensic Support \nTeam) have become fully operational during this reporting period.  These have begun to \nsignificantly change the overall key metrics, in that the Department is generally responding \npromptly to those identified as Tier 1.  Put simply, the most acutely ill defendants — those \nwhose welfare was a primary focus in the current legislation and Consent Decree — do seem to \nbe receiving more prompt treatment upon launch of the Triage System.  More subtle \nimprovements are also clear, as the overall wait list has decreased slightly in the past quarter.  \nOn the other hand, it remains for the Department to begin accelerating inpatient restoration \ntreatment for Tier 2 defendants, whose needs may be less urgent, but nevertheless important.  \nAnd of course, recent suicides raise serious questions about services and quality assurance \nmechanisms in certain areas.  We will continue to work with the Department on these and \nrelated matters, and we encourage you to contact us with any questions or requests.  We \nappreciate the opportunity to serve the court, and the state of Colorado, in these important \nefforts. \n \n \n \n \nNeil Gowensmith, Ph.D. \nPresident, Groundswell Services Inc.   \n \n \n \nDaniel Murrie, Ph.D. \n ",

As  you  know,  the  Consent  Decree \n(following  your  earlier  court  order)  requires  us  to  monitor  progress  and  provide \nrecommendations  for  improvement  to  the  Colorado  Department  of  Human  Services  (CDHS)  as \nthey  attempt  to  improve  competency-related  services  to  criminal  defendants  with  psychiatric \nillness.  Specifically,  the  Consent  Decree  (p.24)  indicates, \n(1)  As  part  of the  duties,  the  Special  Master  shall  provide  the  Court  and the  Parties  with  status \nreports  every  other month  for the  first  six  months,  and then  quarterly  thereafter.  The  Special \nMaster’s  status  report was  submitted  on  January  28,  2019.  Dkt.  146.  The  next report  shall  be \nsubmitted to  the  Court  and the  Parties  on March  28,  2019,  and then May  28,  2019,  and then \nquarterly  thereafter.  Such  reports  shall  address  the  Department’s  compliance  with the \ntimeframe  requirements  of the  Consent Decree  concerning  Competency  Services  and  shall \nprovide  a detailed  summary  of information  and recommendations  the  Special  Master believes \nthe  Court  and Parties  should  consider  relating  to  the  Department’s  compliance  with the \nConsent Decree  timeframes  concerning  Competency  Services. \n(11)  The  Special  Master’s  report  shall  include,  but  is  not  limited to,  reporting  on the  number  of \nPretrial  Detainees  ordered to  receive  Competency  Services,  an  assessment  of the \nDepartment’s  operations,  systems,  and  admissions  practices  and policies  relating  to  the \nDepartment’s  ability  to  comply  with the  Consent Decree  timeframes,  and  guidance  to  the \nDepartment  for  improvement  and  increasing  efficiencies  in these  areas. \nSince  our  appointment  as  Special  Master  on  January  2,  2019,  the  parties  entered  into  mediation, \nresulting  in  the  Consent  Decree  filed  March  15,  2019.  This  Consent  Decree  prescribed  a  variety \nof  steps  the  Department  must  take  to  improve  the  competency  assessment  and  restoration \nsystem  in  Colorado,  and  eventually  attain  compliance  with  all  time  frames  and  deadlines \nmandated  in  the  Consent  Decree.  The  Department  has  initiated  many  of these  steps, \ndemonstrating  meaningful  progress,  in  ways  we  detail  through  the  remainder  of this  report.  /n \nparticular,  this  report will focus  on  developments  since  our prior  quarterly  report,  which  was \nsubmitted  November 28,  2019.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  3  of  41 \nPage  3 \nTABLE  OF  CONTENTS \nINTRODUCTION  .........cccccccccsccccesccseeecceeecceeecceeeceeceeseseuscseuseseeseseueeeeuseseueessuseeeeeceseeessueceseeesaesneeeneesess 4 \nKEY  METRICS  FOR  PROGRESS:  COMPLIANCE  WITH  TIME  FRAME  REQUIREMENTS  ..............ceeeeeeeeeeeeeees 8 \nKEY  METRIC:  COMPETENCE  EVALUATION  TIME  FRAMEG.............ccccsseeeeeceecceeeeeeeececeeaeseeeceeceeaaeseeeeeees 9 \nKEY  METRIC:  COMPETENCE  RESTORATION  TIME  FRAMEG.............cccsseeseecececeeseseeccecceeaseeeceeeesaaaseeeees 11 \nKEY  METRIC:  THE  WAITLIST  FOR  COMPETENCE  RESTORATION  SERVICES  ...e.e eee.eee.eeec.eee.eeee.eeee.eee es  14 \nCONSENT  DECREE  SECTION  VI  UPDATES...............ccccccsscccsseceeecceeeceeceseeeeseeeeseeceseeeesaeeeseeseseeeeneeeens  16 \nADMISSION  OF  PRETRIAL  DETAINEES  FOR  INPATIENT  COMPETENCY  EVALUATIONS  AND  RESTORATION \nTREATMENT .........cccccccnssseeseeccesaasse eeeeeseeeee eaese seeeeeeeeeeeeaaes ees eaeeeeeeseeeas eeese eeeeeeeeeeaaea eeeeeeeesaseuaeeeeeeeeeeeeaaeee a  16 \nWait Times  for  Inpatient  Evaluation...............cccccccesssesesesesssnsneeseeeeseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeseseseseeseeeeegsaneasaeeeeees 17 \nWait Times  for  Inpatient  REStOration .............cccccsessssesessesssssnsneaeseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeseseseeeeseeseeeaaeasasaaenenees 19 \nPERFORMANCE  OF JAIL  COMPETENCY  EVALUATIONS ......... cc eceeseccecccessseeeeccceeaeeseeececceaeeseeececeeaueseeeeeees 21 \nINTERIM  JAIL  MENTAL  HEALTH  TREATMENT ..............:csssssceececsseseeecececeaesseeececeeaassseeceeceaeaaseeeeeceeaauseeeeeees 24 \nRELEASE  OF  PRETRIAL  DETAINEES  FOR  COMMUNITY-BASED  RESTORATION  TREATMENT...............20- 27 \nTRANSPORTATION  OF  PRETRIAL  DETAINEES ............cecsssssceecccessseeeecccceaaaeseeececeeassseeceeceaaaaseeeceeeeeeaseeeeeees 31 \nNOTIFICATION  OF  NON-COMPLIANCE  WITH  TIME  FRAMES  ..........ccccssessccecececeseeececeeaseeaeeceecessaeaeeeeeeeeaea 32 \nCONSENT  DECREE  SECTION  VII  UPDATES. .............ccccccsscccseeceeeeceeeeceececeecesseeeseeceseeeeseecenseeenseseneeeens 34 \nCIVIL  BED  FREEZE .......... cee ceeeeceeccececeeeseeeeeceeeee ee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eee eeeeeeeeeeeeaeaeeeeeeeeeeaeaeseceaaaaeeeeeeeeuaaanees 34 \nCOMPREHENSIVE  AND  COHESIVE  PLAN  ..........cccccssssseeececceeneeeececceceesseeceeeesaaeaeeeeeceeesasseeeeeeeeeauseeeseeeeeaaanes   35 \nINCREASE  COMMUNITY  RESTORATION  SERVICES 1.000...  cece ceeceseeececeeeeeceaeeeeceeaueeecesaaeeceeaaeeeeesaaeeeeeaaeeeeeaea 36 \nCONCLUSION oo eseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeneaeaaeeeeeeeceeeaaseeeeeeceeeaaaaaassseeeeeeeeeesaaaugsseeeeeeeeeeaaaaeaeeeesaeaagsgeeeees 41\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  4  of  41 \nPage  4 \nINTRODUCTION \nAs  you  know,  the  Consent  Decree  filed  March  15,  2019  prescribed  many  steps  the  Department \nmust  take,  and  timelines  it  must  meet,  to  improve  the  competency  assessment  and  restoration \nsystem  in  Colorado.  After  the  Consent  Decree  was  filed  in  March,  the  Department  began  taking \nmany  of these  steps  (detailed  throughout  this  report)  in  ways  that  we  consider  generally \nresponsive,  and  in  ways  that  appear  to  recognize  the  gravity  and  complexity  of the  challenges \nthey  face. \nBroadly  speaking,  we  consider  three  goals  of the  Consent  Decree  to  be  primary: \na)  Reducing  the  overall  number  of  people  on  the  waitlist  for  competence  restoration \nServices, \nb)  Reducing  the  wait  times  for  people  on  the  waitlist,  particularly  people  with  the  most \nacute  psychiatric  illness,  and \nc)  Reducing  harm  (by  providing  care)  to  people  on  the  waitlist. \nProgress  on  the  first  goal  is  clear;  there  has  been  a  modest  —  but  steady  and  meaningful  — \ndecrease  in  the  waitlist  over  recent  months.  Progress  on  the  second  goal  has  been  substantial, \nthough  only for  people  with  the  most  acute  psychiatric  illness;  those  with  less  urgent  needs  still \nexperience  excessive  delays.  Likewise,  progress  on  the  third  goal  has  been  mixed.  The \nDepartment  has  provided  prompt  care  by  hospitalizing  those  who  are  most  ill,  and  providing \nsome  services  to  those  waiting  longer  in  the  jails.  This  report  details  progress  on  these  three \nprimary  markers  as  well  as  other  key  developments. \nProgress: \nThe  Consent  Decree  has  now  been  in  effect  for  almost  one  year.  Whereas  the  first  half  of the \nyear  was  almost  entirely  planning  and  implementation,  the  last  several  months  have  witnessed \nthe  launch  of  several  new  initiatives  and,  most  recently,  the  opportunity  to  observe  the  early \nstages  of their  performance.  We  are  now  beginning  to  see  the  outcomes  of those  new  initiatives \nthe  Consent  Decree  prescribed.  Specifically,  the  Department  has: \ne  Maintained  an  innovative  Triage  system,  a  key  compromise  from  the  Consent  Decree, \nwhich  requires  the  Department  to  rapidly  (i.e.,  within  7  days)  admit  for  competence \nrestoration  the  most  acutely  ill  defendants  (“Tier  1”)  and  less  rapidly  admit  those  who \nless  urgently  need  hospitalization  (“Tier  2”). \ne  Admitted  these  Tier  1  defendants  for  inpatient  restoration  in  a  prompt  manner, \nconsistent  with  the  requirements  of the  Consent  Decree.  This  is  the  most  significant \nimprovement  to  the  competency  system  in  several  years,  and  the  Department  has \ncontinued  to  maintain  nearly  perfect  compliance  with  these  strict  seven-day \nrequirements.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  5  of  41 \nPage  5 \ne  Continued  to  refine  the  new  Forensic  Support  Team  (FST),  another  key  component  of \nthe  Consent  Decree.  The  FST  monitors  incompetent-to-proceed  (ITP)  defendants  in  jail \nawaiting  hospitalization;  they  have  intervened  in  several  crisis  and  emergency  situations, \nand  transitioned  some  defendants  to  community  services.  The  presence  of  a  team  to \nmonitor  the  defendants  on  the  waitlist  is  a  substantial  improvement  to  the  Colorado \ncompetency  system. \ne  Finalized  a  “comprehensive  and  cohesive  plan”  for  competency  services  in  Colorado  that \nis  vastly  improved  over  the  plan  they  prepared  in  late  2018. \ne  Improved  the  Court  Services  unit  of forensic  evaluators  by  responding  to  longstanding \nconcerns,  changing  structure  and  personnel,  and  re-invigorating  an  evaluator  training \nprogram. \ne  Opened  39  new  beds  for  competency  restoration  at  CMHIP,  a  step  that  made  a \nmeaningful  decrease  in  the  waitlist. \ne  Finally,  via  the  Fines  Committee  prescribed  by  the  Consent  Decree  (p.17),  the \nDepartment,  Disability  Law  Colorado  (DLC),  and  the  Special  Master  collaborated  with  the \nColorado  Coalition  for  the  Homeless  to  fund  units  in  Fusion  Studios,  which  is  beginning \nto  provide  housing  in  the  community  to  many  homeless  competency-involved \nindividuals  over  the  next  five  years. \nAs  detailed  in  our  last  report,  these  developments  have  yielded  some  progress  towards  goals  of \nthe  Consent  Decree.  Specifically,  the  waitlist  has  decreased  by  32  defendants  over  this  3-month \nreporting  period  (representing  a  21%  decrease).  Defendants  opined  to  be  Tier  1  continue  to  be \nadmitted  to  CMHIP  promptly,  within  the  Consent  Decree’s  7-day  timeframe.  However,  the  wait \nfor  Tier  2  defendants  has  increased  slightly. \nChallenges: \nThe  Department  has  also  experienced  significant  setbacks  and  challenges.  The  greatest  setback \nwas  their  failure  to  meet  timelines  for  many jail-based  competency  evaluations,  though  meeting \nthose  timelines  had  been  a  strength  of the  Department  in  recent  years. \ne  For  the  first  time  in  years,  the  Department  has  failed  to  meet  timelines for jail-based \ncompetency  evaluation  services.  As  we  anticipated  in  our  last  report,  staffing  shortages \nand  other  challenges  left  the  Department  unable  to  evaluate  all  defendants  in  jail  within \n28  days  of the  court  order  to  do  so.  In  January,  for  example,  44%  of these  defendants \nwere  evaluated  after  the  28-day  deadline  had  passed.  We  detail  later  in  this  report  the \nways  the  Department  has  responded  to  this  challenge.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  6  of  41 \nPage  6 \nThese  delays  have  underscored  the  challenges  the  Department  faces  in  recruiting  and \ndeveloping  an  adequate  workforce  of forensic  evaluators.  To  be  clear,  the  Department \nhas  taken  significant  steps  to  address  the  problems  we  previously  addressed  in  the  Court \nServices  unit  of forensic  evaluators,  and  we  have  seen  strong  improvements  in  morale, \nleadership,  and  training.  But  the  Department  will  need  to  devote  significant  resources  to \ndeveloping  an  adequate  workforce  of  Court  Services  evaluators  and  contracted  forensic \nevaluators. \nBeyond  this  significant  setback  in  meeting  evaluation  timelines,  some  of the  primary  challenges \n(i.e.,  the  areas  for  closest  scrutiny  and  support)  we  identified  in  our  prior  quarterly  report \nremain: \nAccelerating  restoration  services  for  defendants  designated  Tier  2.  The  Department  has \nshown  improvements  in  the  overall  numbers  of Tier  2  defendants  and  the  average  wait \ntimes  for  them  as  a  group.  However,  the  overall  average  wait  times  are  still  far  too  long \nand  greatly  exceed  the  maximum  time  frames  set  by  the  Consent  Decree.  Diversion \nefforts,  statutory  reforms,  enhanced  community  services,  and  increased  inpatient  bed \nspace  each  help  decrease  the  long  wait  list,  but  those  long-term  solutions  do  not \nimmediately  address  the  needs  of  ITP  defendants  currently  waiting  for  months  in  county \njails. \nEnsuring  that  sheriff's  departments  and  county jails  are  better  prepared  to  provide \nenhanced  mental  health  services  for  defendants  awaiting  competency  services  in  local \ncounty  jails.  While  funding  and  technical  assistance  has  been  available  for  several \nmonths,  the  scope  and  breadth  of  services  still  varies  widely  —  such  that  some  counties \nhave  refused  the  funding,  and  several  seem  to  operate  with  inadequate  in-jail  mental \nhealth  services. \nMonitoring  both  the  FST  and  the  Outpatient  Competence  Restoration  Program  (OCRP)! \nsystems.  While  substantial  progress  is  apparent  in  both  programs,  both  are  still  relatively \nnew  and  continue  to  experience  growing  pains.  Neither  program  has  an  adequate \nsystem  for  data  collection,  data  analysis,  or  program  evaluation.  Further,  courts  and \nother  personnel  continue  to  express  confusion  about  the  roles  and  expectations  of  each \nprogram,  so  further  education  efforts  will  be  necessary. \nAs  in  our  last  quarterly  report,  we  continue  to  affirm  the  Department’s  efforts  to  enact  the \nchanges  prescribed  in  the  Consent  Decree.  They  have  demonstrated  clear  success  in \nmaintaining  the  triage  system,  improving  Court  Services  (leadership,  morale,  and  training), \n  \n‘In  the  past,  OBH  has  referred  to  these  services  as  Community  Based  Restoration  Treatment  (CBRT),  but \nto  avoid  confusion  with  other  emerging  programs,  we  now  use  the  more  common  term,  Outpatient \nCompetence  Restoration  Program  (OCRP).\nmaking  outpatient  competency  restoration  (OCRP)  more  widely  available,  and  launching  a \nForensic  Support  Tearn  (FST).  But  it  will  be  crucial  to  adequately  address  the  shortage  of \ncompetence  evaluators  as  well  as  some  of the  more  persistent  problems:  long  waitlists  for  Tier  2 \nindividuals,  poor  leverage  with  interim  jail  mental  health  services,  poor  data  management  in \ncertain  areas,  and  coordination/education  among  the  FST  and  Bridges  programs. \nAs  in  every  quarterly  report,  we  begin  by  addressing  the  Department’s  compliance  with  time \nfrarne  requirements,  because  this  is  the  primary  focus  of the  Consent  Decree  (and  the  focus  that \nthe  Consent  Decree  prescribes  for  our  quarterly  reports}.  We  consider  these  time  frames  our \n“key  metrics”  —  or  primary  markers  of  progress  —  that  we  review  in  each  quarterly  report. \nHowever,  we  then  expand  to  address  the  other  interventions  prescribed  by  the  Consent  Decree \nbecause  progress  in  these  interventions  will  likely  contribute  to  progress  in  achieving  the  overall \ngoal  of  compliance  with  time  frame  requirements. \n    \nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  8  of  41 \nPage  8 \nKEY  METRICS  FOR  PROGRESS:  COMPLIANCE  WITH  TIME  FRAME  REQUIREMENTS \nAs  prescribed  in  the  Consent  Decree,  a  primary  focus  of these  quarterly  reports  must  be  the \nDepartment’s  compliance  with  time  frame  requirements: \n(1)  As  part  of the  duties,  the  Special  Master  shall  provide  the  Court  and the  Parties  with  status \nreports  ...  Such  reports shall address  the Department’s  compliance with  the  timeframe \nrequirements  of the  Consent Decree  concerning  Competency Services  and  shall  provide  a \ndetailed  summary  of information  and  recommendations  the  Special  Master  believes  the  Court \nand Parties  should  consider  relating  to  the  Department’s  compliance  with the  Consent Decree \ntimeframes  concerning  Competency  Services.  (Consent Decree  p.24) \n(11)  The  Special  Master’s  report  shall  include,  but  is  not  limited to,  reporting  on the  number  of \nPretrial  Detainees  ordered to  receive  Competency  Services,  an  assessment  of the \nDepartment’s  operations,  systems,  and  admissions  practices  and  policies  relating  to  the \nDepartment’s  ability  to  comply  with the  Consent Decree  timeframes,  and  guidance  to  the \nDepartment  for  improvement  and  increasing  efficiencies  in these  areas. \nTherefore,  a  primary  focus  of  our  review  is  the  Department’s  progress  in  meeting  the  time \nframes  delineated  in  the  Consent  Decree.  This  includes  both  time  frames  for  competence \nevaluation  and  for  competence  restoration.  We  anticipate  that  these  will  be  the  key  metrics  to \ndemonstrate  progress  over  the  next  few  years,  so  they  are  our  starting  point  in  the  report,  as \nwell  as  a  primary  focus.  Of  course,  performance  in  meeting  these  time  frames  depends  greatly \non  enacting  the  other  steps  prescribed  in  the  Consent  Decree,  so  subsequent  sections  of the \nreport  review  those  steps  in  greater  detail.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  9  of  41 \nPage  9 \nKEY  METRIC:  COMPETENCE  EVALUATION  TIME  FRAMES \nAs  summarized  in  the  table  below,  the  Department  has  historically  met  evaluation  time  frames, \neven  well  before  June  2019  and  even  through  the  first  several  months  of the  Consent  Decree. \nHowever,  during  the  past  quarter,  the  Department  began  failing  to  meet  these  time  frames  for \nthe  first  time  in  many,  many  months. \n  \nAverage  Wait Times for Competence Evaluation Services? \nAug-Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  January 2020  July 2020 \n2019  2019  2019  2020  Requirement  Requirement \n  \nJail-based \n   Competency  20.8  22.3%  30.2*  33.2*  28  days  21  days    \nEvaluations \n  \nInpatient \nCompetency  17.1*  12.2  13.9  12.0  21  days  14  days \nEvaluations \n  \n*  =  at  least  one  defendant  waited  longer than  max time frame for the  evaluation \nHistorically,  timely  competence  evaluation  has  been  a  relative  strength  of the  Department.  Well \nbefore  the  recent  Consent  Decree,  they  followed  the  national  trend  of  de-centralizing \nevaluations,  moving  them  from  solely  an  inpatient  service  to  a  localized  service  in  the \ncommunity.  During  recent  history,  their  evaluations  have  almost  always  met  the  prescribed  time \nframes.  Recently,  however,  their  performance  deteriorated  substantially.  As  anticipated  in  the \nlast  quarterly  report,  the  evaluator  workforce  was  unlikely  sufficient  to  meet  the  need  for  timely \nevaluations.  In  December  37% of jail-based  evaluations  exceeded  the  28-day  time  frame  and  in \nJanuary  44%  did  so. \nAs  we  discuss  extensively  later  in  this  report  (see  Performance of  Jail  Competency  Evaluations, \n0.22)  this  recent  failure  seems  to  reflect  the  confluence  of  several  factors.  Some  involved  a \nfailure  to  develop  an  adequate  workforce,  and  some  involved  taking  appropriate  steps  (which \ncarried  some  short-term  consequences)  to  improve  the  workforce.

As  detailed  in  later  sections, \nwe  affirm  many  of these  steps,  and  urge  the  Department  to  prioritize  developing  a  strong \nworkforce  of  evaluators. \nHistorically,  the  Department  has  performed  well  with  respect  to  competence  evaluation  time \nframes,  but  this  quarter  witnessed  a  confluence  of  long-term  developments  that  led  to \nsubstantial  delays  and  noncompliance.  Contributing  factors  include  errors  in  planning  and \nworkforce  development,  but  also  some  overdue  workforce  improvements.  We  affirm  steps  the \nDepartment  has  taken  to  improve  the  workforce,  but  also  urge  them  to  devote  the  resources \nnecessary  to  develop  a  strong  cadre  of forensic  evaluators.  However,  we  are  urging  the \nDepartment  to  continue  aggressive  efforts  to  recruit  new full-time  and  contracted  evaluators  to \nmeet  current  and future  evaluation  needs.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  11  of  41 \nPage  11 \nKEY  METRIC:  COMPETENCE  RESTORATION  TIME  FRAMES \nThe  Department  has  consistently  failed  to  provide  prompt  restoration  services.  In  the  months \nbefore  the  Triage  system  launched,  defendants  in  jail  who  were  admitted  for  inpatient \nrestoration  treatment  at  CMHIP  or  RISE  waited,  on  average,  71  days.?  Of  course,  this  figure \nincluded  all  defendants  referred  for  restoration,  without  distinction  between  those  with  more, \nversus  less,  acute  needs.  Since  then,  however,  the  Department  launched  on  June  1,  2019  the \nConsent-Decree-mandated  triage  system,’  designed  to  prioritize  the  defendants  with  the  most \nacute  clinical  needs  (“Tier  1”)  over  those  with  less  acute  clinical  needs  (“Tier  2”).  Tier  1 \ndefendants  must  receive  services  within  7  days  of the  competency  hearing,  whereas  Tier  2 \ndefendants  need  not  receive  services  for  49  -  56  days  (56  days  through  December  2019,  and  49 \ndays  beginning  January  2020). \nOverall,  recent  CDHS  monthly  reports  describe  excellent  adherence  to  the  7-day  deadline  for \ndefendants  whom  the  court  has  designated  as  Tier  1  (i.e.,  average  wait  times  well  under  7  days).° \nHowever,  wait  times  for  Tier  2  defendants  still  far  exceed  the  time  frames  prescribed  in  the \nConsent  Decree  (i.e.,  average  wait  times  exceeding  97  days  this  quarter,  well  beyond  the \nrequired  49  -  56  days). \n  \nAverage  Wait Times for Inpatient Competence Restoration Services® \nAug - Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  January 2020  July 2020 \n2019  2019  2019  2020  Requirement  Requirement \n       \nTier  1  2.74*  2.5  2.8  2.3  7  days  7  days \n  \nTier 2  91.2**  86.7**  117.3**  85.7%**  49  days  42  days \n*  =  at   least  one  defendant  waited  longer than  maximum  t ime frame for  restoration  services \n**  =  most  defendants  waited  longer than  maximum  time frame for  restoration  services \nHowever,  as  in  prior  reports,  each  of these  summary  statistics  requires  clarification.  First,  the \nfigures  for  Tier  1  defendants  reflect  only  Tier  1  defendants  as  defined  in  the  Consent  Decree; \nthat  is,  defendants  whom  the  court  has  designated  as  Tier  1  and  ordered  to  the  hospital. \n  \n>  Average  waiting  period  November  2018  -  April  2019,  as  calculated  from  data  provided  by the \nDepartment  (see  p.7  of their  Monthly  report  filed  May  7,  2019). \n“See  Consent  Decree  paragraph  43. \n>  According to  Special  Master  Compliance  Plan  report January  2020  p.11  (submitted  February  7,  2020).\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  12  of  41 \nPage  12 \nTo  date,  the  Department  reports  that  a  total  of  128  individuals  have  been  opined  as  Tier  1  by \nCourt  Services  Evaluators  and  admitted  to  CMHIP  via  the  Consent  Decree  criteria.  Of these,  126 \nwere  admitted  within  the  7-day  maximum  time  frame.  In  many  respects,  this  summary  bodes \nwell  for  the  triage  system.  According  to  CDHS  administrators  and  data  management  personnel, \nthe  vast  majority  of  defendants  whom  evaluators  designate  as  Tier  1  are  admitted  to  the  hospital \npromptly  (i.e.,  well  within  seven  days),  and  often  even  before  the  Court  designates  them  as  Tier \n1  and  orders  admission.  For  those  that  have  not,  CDHS  has  offered  what  appear  to  be  plausible \nexplanations. \n  \nA qualitative  review of Tier  1: \nAn  initial  challenge  in  launching  the  Triage  system  was  ensuring  evaluators  could \nreliably  identify the  appropriate  defendants  as  “Tier  1.”  For  example,  failing to \nidentify  acutely  ill  defendants  as  Tier  1  would  leave  some  of the  most  ill  defendants \ndeteriorating  in  jail,  but  over-identifying  defendants  as  Tier  1  might  require  more \nurgent  admissions  than  necessary,  thereby  diluting  urgent  services  from  those  who \nneed  them  most.  In  reviewing Tier  1  admissions  over  recent  months,  hospital  staff \ntend  to  confirm  that  these  are,  indeed,  defendants  who  warrant  urgent \nhospitalization.  Stated  differently,  evaluators  are  not  over-identifying  defendants \nas  Tier  1;  those  who  receive  urgent  hospitalization  need  it. \n   Of course,  hospital  staff would  not  be  in  a  position  to  recognize  a  tendency to    \nunder-identify  defendants  as  Tier  1.  These  scenarios  would  be  best  identified  by \nthe  Forensic  Support  Team  (FST),  who  is  tasked  with  monitoring Tier  2  defendants \nas  they  wait  in  jail.  Thus  far,  the  FST  has  not  indicated  that  many Tier  2  defendants \nare  in  crisis  requiring  hospitalization.  They follow  procedures  to  transition  them \ninto  CMHIP  when  defendants  do  appear to  warrant  urgent  admission.  Thus, \npreliminary  review  across  the  first  several  months  of the  Triage  and  FST  systems \ndoes  suggest  that  the  process  has  generally  been  triaging  incompetent  defendants \ninto  the  appropriate  level  of care.  Of course,  ongoing  review  and  monitoring \n(particularly feedback  and  formal  data  from  the  FST)  will  be  crucial  to  more  long- \nterm  and  rigorous  review  of the  triage  designations. \n  \nRegarding  Tier  2  defendants,  progress  has  been  limited.  Average  wait  times  still  far  exceed  the \ntime  limits  in  the  Consent  Decree,  just  as  they  did  for  all  defendants  in  prior  months.  Tier  2 \ndefendants  have  waited  97.7  days  on  average  between  November  2019  and  January  2020,  when \nthe  maximum  time  frame  for  that  time  period  was  49  -  56  days.  Thus,  the  Tier  1  figures  suggest \nthat  the  Triage  System  serves  the  purpose  for  which  it  was  designed:  prioritizing  the  most \nacutely  ill  defendants  and  moving  them  into  the  hospital  rapidly.  However,  the  Tier  2  figures \nreveal  that  CDHS  continues  to  struggle  with  some  of the  primary  challenges  that  prompted  the \n  \n® Average  wait times  for Tier  2  defendants  reflect  a  reasonable  approximation  of the  average  wait  times; \nexact  sample  sizes  were  not  used  to  calculate  a  precise  average.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  13  of  41 \nPage  13 \nConsent  Decree:  responding  to  the  volume  of  defendants  referred  for  inpatient  restoration,  and \nadmitting  them  into  the  hospital  within  a  reasonable  time  frame. \nOverall,  Tier  1  admissions  occur  on  time,  while  Tier  2  admissions  still  far  exceed  maximum \nadmission  time  frames.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  14  of  41 \nPage  14 \nKEY  METRIC:  THE  WAITLIST  FOR  COMPETENCE  RESTORATION  SERVICES \nBeyond  the  wait  times  for  restoration  services  (and  progress  towards  the  time  frame \nrequirements  of the  Consent  Decree),  another  key  metric  for  gauging  the  Department’s  progress \nis  the  waiting  list for  competence  restoration  services.  That  is,  the  Consent  Decree  is  designed \nto  reduce  wait  times,  but  also  reduce  the  number  of  defendants  waiting.  In  the  months \npreceding  launch  of the  Triage  system,  the  waitlist  averaged  around  150  to  180  defendants.’ \nBut  again,  with  the  initiation  of the  Triage  system  on  June  1,  we  must  consider  the  waitlist \naccording  to  Tier  status.  Central  to  the  Triage  system  is  an  acknowledgement  that  some \nincompetent  defendants  are  so  acutely  ill  that  they  require  treatment  almost  immediately  (Tier \n1,  who  require  treatment  within  7  days),  whereas  others  can  safely  await  treatment  (Tier  2,  who \ncan  wait  several  weeks). \n  \nNumber of Defendants on  Waiting List for Inpatient Restoration® \nMarch  2019  Oct 2019  Nov 2019  Dec 2019  Jan  2020 \n  \nCombined  157 \n     \nTier  1  N/A     3     1  1  1 \nTier 2  N/A  152  141  122  112 \n  \nOver  the  past  quarter,  the  Department  made  meaningful progress  in  reducing  the  waitlist. \nWaitlist  figures  far  exceeded  150  in  the  Summer  of  2019,  and  they  decreased  below  150  during \nthe  Fall  of  2019.  Although  the  number  of  individuals  on  the  waitlist  remains  high  in  absolute \nterms  (112  in  January),  this  figure  has  decreased  steadily  over the  past  several  months  and \nreached  its  lowest  point  in  the  past  year.  The  decrease  cannot  be  explained  by  decreased \nreferrals  for  evaluation  or  restoration;  these  vary  substantially  month-to-month.  Rather,  the \ndecrease  appears  directly  attributable  to  Department  interventions.  The  most  potent  of these \ninterventions  was  the  opening  of  39  new  inpatient  beds  (resulting  in  a  net  increase  of 42  beds) \nthat  comprise  a  new  inpatient  competence  restoration  unit  at  CMHIP.  A  few  months  earlier,  the \nDepartment  also  opened  a  second  RISE  (jail-based,  inpatient-like  competence  restoration \nservices)  comprising  18  specially  designated  beds  in  the  Boulder jail.  Although  all  parties  are \naware  that  the  Department  cannot  “build  their  way  out”  of the  competence  waitlist  and  wait \n  \n’ At  present,  the  Department  provides  waitlist  data  as  daily figures,  so  the  monthly figures  in  the  table \nreflect  averaged  daily figures. \n8  According to  the  Department’s  Special  Master  Compliance  Plan  report January  2020  p.11  (submitted \nFebruary  7,  2020).\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  15  of  41 \nPage  15 \ntimes,  developing  additional  capacity  for  inpatient  restoration  is  a  necessity  in  a  system  with  so \nmany  acutely  ill  incompetent  defendants. \nOverall,  there  has  been  a  meaningful  decrease  in  the  number  of  individuals  on  the  waitlist  for \nrestoration  services  over  the  past  quarter.  This  decrease  is  not  simply  due  to  a  decrease  in \nreferrals.  Rather,  the  decrease  appears  genuinely  attributable  to  Department  interventions: \nopening  a  new  inpatient  restoration  unit,  opening  a  new jail-based  restoration  unit,  increasing \noutpatient competence  restoration  services,  and  other  efforts.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  16  of  41 \nPage  16 \nCONSENT  DECREE  SECTION  VI  UPDATES \nADMISSION  OF  PRETRIAL  DETAINEES?

In \nshort,  fewer  people  are  being  referred  to  CMHIP  for  inpatient  competency  evaluations  than \nwere  sent  prior  to  the  Consent  Decree,  and  the  wait  times  to  admission  are  substantially  lower. \nThe  pattern  has  been  steadily  improving  since  implementation  of the  Consent  Decree  and  seems \nto  have  largely  plateaued.  We  do  not  expect  inpatient  evaluations  to  decrease  to  zero. \nInevitably,  a  few  defendants  are  so  acutely  ill  that  prompt  inpatient  evaluation  is  necessary,  and \njudges  may  order  inpatient  evaluations  due  to  a  case’s  high  profile  or  other  factors. \nNevertheless,  we  are  pleased  that  inpatient  evaluations  are  less  common  and  more  rapid. \n  \n‘©  Fine  amounts  are  tied  to  delays  beyond  each  of the  time  frames  listed.  However,  these  fines  are \ndiscussed  elsewhere  in  this  report.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  18  of  41 \nPage  18 \nFurthermore,  according  to  CDHS  reports,  for  the  first  time  since  the  implementation  of the \nConsent  Decree,  a  majority  of those  defendants  ordered  for  inpatient  evaluation  actually  met \nthe  strict  criteria  for  involuntary  hospitalization  (C.R.S.  §  27-65-105).™  Specifically,  CDHS \nreported  that  during  the  past  3  months,  71.4%  of  admissions  for  inpatient  evaluation  met  that \nstrict  “27-65”  criteria  for  involuntary  hospitalization.1*  This  contrasts  with  earlier  rates  as  low  as \n16%  historically,  and  around  50%  during  the  most  recent  quarter.  Indeed,  rates  have  steadily \nincreased  since  January  2019.  Again,  this  is  a  positive  trend  reflecting  a  more  appropriate  use  of \nhospitalization:  fewer  defendants  are  sent  for  inpatient  evaluation,  and  of that  smaller  group, \nmore  meet  inpatient  admission  criteria.  That  is,  those  ordered  to  the  hospital  were  more  likely \nto  be  those  who  met  criteria  for  hospitalization  and  genuinely  required  this  more  intensive \nservice. \nThe  combination  of fewer defendants  referred for  inpatient  evaluation,  shorter  wait  times  for \nadmission,  and  more  appropriate  referrals  (i.e.,  those  meeting  involuntary  hospitalization  criteria) \nreflects  substantial progress for  the  Department,  and  their interaction  with  the  Colorado  courts. \n  \n“T  C.R.S.  §  27-65-105:  (1)  Emergency  procedure  may  be  invoked  under  either  one of  the  following  two \nconditions: \n(a)(l)  When  any  person  appears  to  have  a  mental  health  disorder  and,  as  a  result  of such  mental  health \ndisorder,  appears  to  be  an  imminent  danger to  others  or to  himself or  herself or  appears  to  be  gravely \ndisabled,  then  an  intervening  professional,  as  specified  in  subsection  (1)(a)(II)  of this  section,  upon \nprobable  cause  and  with  such  assistance  as  may  be  required,  may take  the  person  into  custody,  or  cause \nthe  person  to  be  taken  into  custody,  and  placed  in a  facility  designated  or  approved  by the  executive \ndirector for  a  seventy-two-hour treatment  and  evaluation... \n(b)  Upon  an  affidavit  sworn  to  or  affirmed  before  a  judge  that  relates  sufficient  facts  to  establish  that  a \nperson  appears  to  have  a  mental  health  disorder  and,  as  a  result  of the  mental  health  disorder,  appears \nto  be  an  imminent  danger to  others  or to  himself or  herself or  appears  to  be  gravely  disabled,  the  court \nmay  order the  person  described  in  the  affidavit  to  be  taken  into  custody  and  placed  in a  facility \ndesignated  or  approved  by the  executive  director for  a  seventy-two-hour treatment  and  evaluation. \n‘2  From  the  February  7,  2020  CDHS  Monthly  Compliance  Plan  Report  (p.20).\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  19  of  41 \nPage  19 \nWait  Times  for  Inpatient  Restoration \nCompared  to  the  timely  inpatient  evaluations,  there  are  far  more  concerns  regarding  inpatient \nrestoration  at  CMHIP.  Over  the  past  few  years,  wait  times  consistently  exceeded  the  30-day  time \nframes  mandated  by  an  earlier  Settlement  Agreement.  However,  the  required  time  frames \nchanged  as of June  1,  2019,  per  the  Consent  Decree.  The  maximum  time  frame  for  many \ndefendants  (those  labeled  as  Tier  2)  waiting  in  jails  was  extended  to  56  days.  But  as  of January  1, \n2020,  the  Consent  Decree  reduced  this  maximum  timeframe  to  49  days.  The  time  frame  for \ndefendants  with  the  most  urgent  clinical  needs  (those  labeled  Tier  1)  is  now  only  7  days. \n  \nRecent  Wait Times for Inpatient Restoration’? \nMonth  Number of people  Average  days waited  People who waited  more \nadmitted  to  CMHIP for  for admission to  than  the  max days for \ninpatient  restoration  CMHIP  inpatient  admission  to  CMHIP \nrestoration  inpatient  restoration \n Tier  1  Tier  2  Tier  1   Tier  2  Tier  1  Tier  2 \n  \nJan  20  18  61  2.3  85.7  O  * \n   Dec  19  16  63  2.8  117.3  O  *    \nNov  19  16  46  2.5  86.7  O  * \nPrevious  Quarter  19.7  54.7  2.75  93.2  1  * \nMonthly Average \n(Aug  -  Oct  19) \n March  19  44   58.2  31 \n(before  tier \ndistinctions) \n *  CDHS has  not provided in  their monthly report  the  number of Tier 2  individuals  who  waited more  than \nthe  maximum  allowable  days for admission  to  CMHIP for restoration.  We  have  requested  these  data. \nAs  the  table  reveals,  most  of the  defendants  now  designated  as  Tier  2  wait  much  longer  than  the \nrequired  49  -  56  days  before  admission.  For  example,  in  January,  a  total  of  61  Tier  2  individuals \nwere  admitted  to  CMHIP  and  their  waiting  time  for  admission  averaged  85.7  days.  However,  the \nmuch  smaller  group  of  patients  designated  as  Tier  1  were  admitted  rapidly,  consistent  with  the \nmandates  of the  Consent  Decree.  In  January,  a  total  of  18  Tier  1  individuals  were  admitted  to \nCMHIP,  with  their  wait  prior  to  admission  averaging  2.3  days.  To  date,  a  total  of  126  individuals \ndesignated  as  Tier  1  have  been  admitted  within  7  days  of  being  adjudicated  as  ITP.“\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  20  of  41 \nPage  20 \nAs  noted  in  our  last  quarterly  report,  the  Department’s  rapid  response  to  those  identified  as  Tier \n1  is  remarkable  and  commendable.  In  many  ways,  the  Tier  1  individuals  are  the  highest  priority \nfor  the  Consent  Decree  and  the  CDHS  competency  system.  Those  whom  CDHS  categorized  as \nTier  1  —  usually  those  who  most  need  urgent  treatment  —  were  indeed  admitted  rapidly. \nOn  the  other  hand,  the  progress  towards  meeting  Tier  2  timelines  remains  problematic.  Tier  2 \nindividuals  are  mandated  to  CMHIP,  but  with  less  urgency.  CMHIP  has  continued  to  nimbly \ncreate  space  for  Tier  1  individuals,  inevitably  by  prioritizing  them  over  Tier  2  individuals. \nHowever,  Tier  2  individuals  must  also  be  admitted  within  certain  time  frames.  The  only  options \nfor  reducing  their  wait  times  is  to  divert  defendants  away  from  the  competency  process \naltogether  (through  early  diversion  efforts  by  police  and  courts),  create  space  for  them  in  CMHIP \n(by  reducing  restoration  lengths  of  stay  or  creating  new  beds),  or  transfer  them  to  community- \nbased  restoration  treatment  (if they  are  appropriate  for  community  treatment).  The \nDepartment  has  made  progress  in  some  of these  areas,  but  will  need  to  prioritize  additional \nsteps  that  create  space  for  Tier  2  defendants.  In  short,  while  Tier  1  individuals  must  be \nprioritized  for  admission  (thereby  treating  those  who  need  it  most),  successful  compliance  with \nthe  Consent  Decree  must  a/so  reduce  Tier  2  time  frames;  such  compliance  will  demonstrate  that \nthe  CDHS  competency  system  has  created  adequate  capacity  for  all  levels  of  competency- \nrestoration  needs. \nNew  Efforts: \nCMHIP  has  initiated  a  “Fast  Track”  project  to  accelerate  the  scheduling  of  some \ncompetency  restoration  evaluations.  Although  defendants  are  typically  evaluated  at  90- \nday  intervals,  defendants  do  not  naturally  gain  the  capacities  necessary  for  competence \nat  tidy  90-day  intervals;  many  may  be  competent  well  before  (or  shortly  after)  these \ncourt-set  dates.  When  defendants  are  identified  for  the  program,  some  are  stabilizing  far \nin  advance  of their  previously-scheduled  post-restoration  competency  evaluation.  In \nthese  cases,  evaluators  are  notified  to  conduct  the  evaluation  soon,  so  that  if the \nevaluator  renders  an  opinion  that  the  defendant  has  been  restored,  the  case  can  be \nreturned  to  court  in  advance  of their  previously  scheduled  hearing  (sometimes  weeks  to \nmonths  in  the  future)  and  bed  turnover  can  occur.  To  date,  32  defendants  have  been \nopined  as  competent  sooner  than  their  scheduled  90-day  evaluation  date,  returning \nthem  to  jail  sooner  (to  await  their  hearings)  and  thus  sooner  opening  their  hospital  beds \nfor  other  restoration  patients.  This  type  of  practical  intervention  has  become  common  in \nsome  other  states,  and  is  a  simple  strategy  to  reduce  unnecessary  length  of  stay. \n  \n‘3  According to  the  Department’s  Special  Master  Compliance  Plan  report January  2020  p.9-11  (submitted \nFebruary  7,  2020). \n14  Some  Tier  1  individuals  admitted  to  CMHIP  are  not  reflected  in  the  table  due  to  timing  of admissions \n(primarily  persons  admitted  in  early  February).\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  21  of  41 \nPage  21 \nPERFORMANCE  OF  JAIL  COMPETENCY  EVALUATIONS \n33.  (b)  Performance  of Jail  Competency  Evaluations.  The  Department  shall  complete  all  Jail \nCompetency  Evaluations  of a Pretrial  Detainee  pursuant to  the  attached table  (Table  1),  after the \nDepartment’s  receipt  of a Court  Order  directing  the  evaluation  and  receipt  of Collateral  Materials. \nThis  timeframe  requirement  shall  apply  to  the  following  counties:  Adams,  Alamosa,  Arapahoe, \nBoulder,  Broomfield,  Crowley,  Custer,  Denver,  Douglas,  El  Paso,  Elbert,  Fremont,  Huerfano, \nJefferson,  Larimer,  Mesa,  Otero,  Pueblo,  Teller,  and  Weld.  Counties  not  specifically  identified  are \ncounties  that  use  the  “Hold  and  Wait”  court  ordered  process.  Counties  utilizing  the  Hold  and  Wait \nEvaluation  process  will  be  offered  a meeting  date  within  30  days  of the  Department’s  receipt  of the \nCourt  Order  and  Collateral  Materials,  and the  evaluation  will  be  completed  within  30  days  of the \nmeeting.  Beginning  January  1,  2020,  counties  utilizing the  Hold  and Wait Evaluation  process  will  be \noffered  a meeting  date  within  30  days  of the  Department’s  receipt  of the  Court  Order  and  Collateral \nMaterials,  and the  evaluation  will  be  completed  within  14  days  of the  meeting. \nThe  mandated  time  limit  for  a  jail-based  evaluation  is  now  28  days,  per  the  Consent  Decree,  and \nwill  decrease  to  21  days  in  June  of  2020.  As  mentioned  earlier  in  this  quarterly  report  (see  Key \nMetrics:  Competence  Evaluation  Time  Frames,  p.9)  the  Department  has  historically  met  this \ntimeframe  on a  consistent  basis,  up  until  around  their  November  2019  report. \nHowever,  around  November  2019  it  was  becoming  clear  that  the  Department’s  workforce  of \nevaluators  was  not  sufficient  to  meet  the  volume  of  referrals  in  a  punctual  manner.  In \nDecember  37% of jail-based  evaluations  exceeded  the  28-day  time  frame  and  in  January  44% \nexceeded  the  time  frame.  Thus,  this  quarter  reflected  a  tremendous  setback  in  domain  that  had \nbeen  a  historical  strength  for  the  Department. \nContributing  Factors: \nIn  our  view,  this  failure  resulted  from  a  confluence  of  several  factors.  First,  leadership  in  Court \nServices  had  apparently  not  fully  anticipated  workforce  needs  or  prepared  for  some  foreseeable \nchanges  in  staffing  (e.g.,  maternity  leave,  evaluator  departure).  As  best  we  can  tell,  recruitment, \nhiring,  and  retention  efforts  were  not  particularly  vigorous,  and  there  were  many  anecdotes  of \npotential  evaluators  dissuaded  by  delays  or  disorganization.  Evaluation  services  have  been \nspread  across  Court  Services  (a  unit  of full-time  evaluators  employed  by  the  Department)  and \ncontracted  evaluators,  but  leadership  had  developed  neither  workforce  to  the  extent  necessary, \nparticularly  in  light  of  an  upcoming  decrease  in  evaluation  time  frames  in  June  of  2020. \nFurthermore,  as  detailed  in  prior  reports,  morale  was  low  among  Court  Services  evaluators,  in \npart  because  of  how  leadership  had  handled  changes  prompted  by the  Consent  Decree.  Though \nthis  low  morale  did  not  cause  the  workforce  shortage,  several  anecdotes  suggest  it  may  have \nhampered  recruitment  of  new  evaluators.  Finally,  November  (due  to  holidays  and  mandatory \ntraining)  and  December  (due  to  holidays)  required  reduction  in  evaluator  quotas.  Of  course, \nneither  should  jeopardize  punctuality  among  an  adequate  workforce  (holidays  and  trainings  are \nnot  unforeseeable),  but  these  routine  decreases  in  workdays  revealed  the  insufficiency  of the \nworkforce.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  22  of  41 \nPage  22 \nWe  also  emphasize,  however,  that  some  of the  factors  contributing  to  these  recent  delays  are,  in \nfact,  quite  positive.  That  is,  some  factors  reflect  long-overdue  improvements  to  Court  Services. \nAs  a  primary  example,  the  Department  had  long  over-relied  on  a  single  contracted  evaluator \n(who  also  held  a  significant  clinical  position  at  CMHIP)  to  perform  a  grossly  disproportionate \nshare  of  evaluations  (many  dozens)  per  month,  for  additional  income  beyond  his  primary  duties. \nThis  arrangement  was  problematic  in  almost  every  respect—  report  quality  was  poor,  costs  were \nexcessive,  report  quantity  was  impossibly  high,  and  complaints  from  the  bar  were  common  — \nexcept that  the  arrangement  helped  the  Department  meet  evaluation  timelines.  Court  Services \nleadership  at  the  time  seemed  unaware  of the  extent  of this  over-reliance  or  the  severe  risks  it \nposed.  We  shared  our  grave  concerns  about  this  arrangement  and  the  Department  ultimately \ndecreased  their  over-reliance  on  this  prolific  evaluator.  We  affirm  this  difficult  step  by  the \nDepartment,  and  understand  it  carried  significant  short-term  cost  (i.e.,  making  it  harder  to  meet \nevaluation  time  frames  in  the  following  month  or  two).*©  But  their  decision  to  sacrifice  a  short- \nterm,  low-quality  compliance  strategy  to  instead  invest  in  a  longer-term,  high-quality  compliance \nstrategy  is  exactly  the  type  of  change  that  makes  us  more  optimistic  about  the  Department’s \nprospects  for  developing  a  strong  competency  system  and  complying  with  the  Consent  Decree  in \nthe  long-term. \nInterventions: \nTo  their  credit,  the  Department  has  recently  taken  steps  to  address  the  workforce  shortage  that \ncontributed  to  these  evaluation  delays.  They  made  substantial  changes  in  the  leadership  of \nCourt  Services,  and  have  re-invigorated  an  evaluator  training  and  oversight  process  that  makes \nuse  of  legitimate  expertise  within  Court  Services.  The  Department  has  pursued  salary  increases \nfor  evaluators  and  pursued  other  resources  to  support  training.  In  January,  the  Department \nhired  three  new  evaluators,  and  enlisted  three  new  contracted  evaluators.  Most  recent  reports \nindicate  that  a  total  of  six  additional  contractors  should  be  conducting  competency  evaluations \nbeginning  in  March  2020.  Although  they  have  not  been  able  to  reduce  all  of the  bureaucratic \nbarriers  and  delays  to  hiring  (some  appear  common  across  the  Department  or  even  across  state \ngovernment),  they  have  appeared  to  reduce  some  of the  egregious  delays  and  poor \ncommunication  that  undermined  prior  efforts  to  recruit  and  hire. \n  \n‘2  We  continue  to  encourage  the  Department  to  enact  much  stronger  oversight  and  supervision  of this \nclinician  if  he  does  continue  to  perform  any  evaluations.  As  detailed  elsewhere,  education  and  oversight \nare  also  improving  in  Court  Services. \n‘6  Indeed,  the  Department’s  decision  to  reduce  the  low-quality,  high-quantity  evaluations  from a  prolific \nevaluator  reflects  exactly the  kind  of  long-term  approach  we  encouraged  when  we  reviewed  their  original \nplan  in  late  2018.  Rather than  prioritizing  a  low-quality  strategy for  hasty  compliance  that  risks \nexacerbating  problems,  the  Department  has  sacrificed  some  degree  of compliance  in  the  short-term  to \nprioritize  better-quality  services  that  are  far  more  conducive  to  long-term  compliance  with  the  Consent \nDecree  and  with  best  practices.\nThus,  the  recent  failure  to  meet  evaluation  time  frames  reflects  at  least  two  broad  thernes.  The \nfirst  is  unambiguously  negative:  a  combination  of  poor  workforce  development  and  failure  to \nanticipate  foreseeable  needs.  In  our  view,  this  reflects  a  failure,  but  the  Department  has \nchanged  leadership  in  Court  Services  and  seems  much  more  responsive  to  these  clear  needs  and \nchallenges.  The  second  contributing  theme  is  unambiguously  positive.  improving  the  evaluator \nworkforce  carried  some  short-term  costs  with  respect  to  timely  evaluations.  While  it  would  have \nbeen  ideal  to  enact  these  improvements  long  ago,  we  consider  these  improvements  “better  late \nthan  never”  and  we  have  no  criticism  for  whatever  portion  of the  delays  was  prompted  by \nreducing  poor-quality  evaluations  and  improving  the  evaluator  workforce. \nTo  be  clear,  the  delays  are  not  resolved  and  the  Department  must  move  aggressively  to  continue \ndeveloping  an  adequate  workforce  of evaluators.  The  recent  improvements  in  salaries,  incentive \npay  for  additional  evaluations,  contractor  pay,  and  recruitment  efforts  should  continue,  as \nshould  the  recent  improvements  in  leadership,  training,  anc  oversight.  Though  disappointed \nthat  some  of these  interventions  were  long  overdue,  we  affirm  these  recent  improvements  and \nurge  the  Department  to  continue  similar  interventions.  We  will  remain  supportive  of  continued \naggressive  efforts  to  incentivize  contracted  and  full-time  well-qualified  evaluators  as  the  next \nbest  step  for  addressing  current  workforce  gaps,  and  we  will  vigilantly  monitor  the  effectiveness \nof these  approaches.\n  \nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  24  of  41 \nPage  24 \nINTERIM  JAIL  MENTAL  HEALTH  TREATMENT?” \n34.

This  paragraph  does  not toll  or  otherwise  modify  the  Department’s \nobligation to  Offer Admission to  the  Pretrial  Detainees  for Inpatient Restoration  Treatment.  Interim \nJail  Mental  Health  Treatment  shall  not replace  or  be  used  as  a  substitute  for Inpatient Restoration \nTreatment but  does  not preclude  the  Department  from  providing  Restoration  Treatment.  A  member \nof the  Forensic  Support  Team  shall  report to  the  Court Liaison  every  10  days  concerning  the  clinical \nstatus  and progress  towards  competency  of the  Pretrial  Detainee. \nAs  we  have  discussed  in  prior  reports,  the  Department  is  required  to  partner  with  county jails  to \ndevelop  a  program  of  coordinated  services  for  individuals  receiving  competency-related  services. \nThese  services  are  currently  managed  statewide  through  the  Jail-Based  Behavioral  Services \nprogram  (JBBS)  and  are  funded  approximately  $2.5  million  per  year  by  the  recently  appropriated \nby  SB19-223.  Essentially,  the  Department  utilizes  JBBS  as  a  hub  for  coordinating  subcontracted \nservices  across  Colorado.  These  subcontracted  providers  are  now  asked  to  provide  adequate \nmental  health  services  to  inmates  involved  with  competency-related  services.  Interim  mental \nhealth  treatment  is  critical  to  screen,  monitor,  assess,  and  treat  those  receiving  competency- \nrelated  services  in  county  jails  so  that  they  remain  physically  safe  and  clinically  stable  until  their \ntransfer  to  competency  restoration  services. \nHowever,  the  structure  of JBBS  creates  some  challenges.  Because  the  JBBS-subcontracted \noroviders  differ  across  counties  and  jurisdictions,  their  services  differ.  Some  providers  have \nstrong  connections  with  local  and  private  inpatient  hospitalization  facilities,  while  others  have \nweaker  ties.  Workforce  and  qualifications  also  differ  among  providers.  This  poses  some \nchallenges  for  the  Department;  while  individualized  services  are  enhanced  by  the  local  nature  of \nthe  providers  within  JBBS,  uniformity  and  leverage  across  providers  are  more  difficult. \nSince  our  last  quarterly  report,  most  counties  have  either  accepted  this  enhanced  funding  or  are \nin  the  process  of  pursuing  it.  However,  a  few  urban  and  rural  counties  have  rejected  the \nfunding.  Primary  reasons  for  rejecting  funding,  according  to  Ms.  Shah  and  Dr.  Werthwein  (OBH \nDirector),  are  that  the  funding  comes  with  too  many  reporting  requirements  or  that  the  sheriffs \nalready  perceive  they  have  adequate jail  mental  health  resources  in  place.  Ms.  Shah  and  Dr. \n  \n17  “Interim  Jail  Mental  Health  Treatment”  means  mental  health  treatment  of a  Pretrial  Detainee  that  is \nperformed  in  the  County Jail  where  the  Pretrial  Detainee  is  held  while  the  Pretrial  Detainee  awaits \nCommunity-Based  or  Inpatient  Restoration  Treatment  per  Court  Order  consistent  with  the  time  frames  in \nthe  Consent  Decree.

This  technical  assistance  has  focused  on  a  number  of  areas,  inclucing  intake  screenings, \n  \nformularies,  care  management  during  transition  back  to  the  community,  and  identifying \ncommunity  providers  for  aftercare.  We  have  encouraged  this  Office  to  prioritize  and  encourage \nsheriffs  to  utilize  the  enhanced  JBBS  funding  for  expanding  psychiatric  medication  formularies \nand  to  secure  additional  psychiatry  services.  Psychiatric  service  is  the  strongest  contributor  to \nearly  competency  restoration  and  would  tikely  provide  the  largest  return  on  investment  from  the \n     \nenhanced  JBBS  funding. \nThe  Office  of  Community  Services  and  OBH  administration  are  also  pursuing  statewide  tele- \nhealth  services.  Tele-healtn  could  be  a  helpful  addition  for  competency  evaluations  and  ongoing \nassessment  of  Pretrial  Detainees;  we  support  an  assertive  exploration  of tele-health  strategies. \nAlthough  outreach  efforts  continue,  it  may  be  that  OBH  has  reached  the  maximum  number  of \nshertf’s  departments  willing  to  utilize  this  enhanced  JBBS  funding.  This,  of  course,  leads  to \nquestions  about  how  effective  mental  health  services  will  be  for  Pretrial  Detainees  in  those  jails \nthat  have  rejected  the  enhanced  funding,  and  what  alternate  strategies  the  Department  may \npursue, \nHowever,  even  within  the  jails  that  wif  utilize  this  enhanced  funding,  significant  challenges \nremain.  Contracts  with  county jails  vary  greatly  in  depth  and  breadth  of  services.  Moreover, \nOBH  has  very  little  leverage  over  these  services  aside  from  the  contract.  Quality  of  services, \nfrequency  of  communication,  and  fidelity  to  expectations  are  rather  loosely  assured  without  a \nstringent  contracting  and  quality  management  oversight.  Unfortunately,  OBH  has  few  resources \nto  provide  this  oversight,  so  in  reality  the  actual  mental  health  services  available  in  county jails \ncould  be  inadequate.  OBH  proposed  to  develop  an  “inter-agency  agreement”  by  March  2020 \nwhich  would  allow  for  more  oversight  and  more  flexibility  in  service  changes,  rather  than  utilizing \nindividual  contracts.  However,  we  have  not  received  updates  about  this  inter-agency  agreement \nand  are  not  optimistic  that  it  wil  be  effective  in  rectifving  the  above  challenges.  There  is  just  too \nrnuch  variability  across  jails  for  OBH  to  moniter  services  effectively. \nTwo  potential  solutions  are  under  consideration.  The  first  involves  data  collection.  We  have \nencouraged  OBH  to  use  existing  data  from  county jails  about  their  mental  health  service \nprovision.  OBH  has  stated  that  approximately  ten  jails  use  a  shared  data  system.  Their  data \ncould  be  analyzed  to  determine  how  frequently  competency-involved  individuals  are  treated \nversus  other  inmates  with  mental  health  needs,  what  medications  are  prescribed,  what \nprograms  or  services  are  provided,  how  often  crisis  services  are  required,  and  so  on.  This  type  of \nanalysis  would  {for  those  ten  jails}  help  OBH  better  understand  how JBBS  funding  is  used  and \nwhat  outcomes  are  being  realized.  As  an  adjunct  to  this  data  analysis,  the  Forensic  Services\nPage  26 \nTeam  Navigators  are  beginning  to  collect  data  on  their  Pretrial  Detainees.  Although  data  focuses \nprimarily  on  clinical  status  and  progress  to  restoration  {per  Consent  Decree  requirements),  some \ninformation  can  be  gathered  to  address  the  quantity  and  quality  of  services  among  different jails. \nSecondly,  we  are  exploring  the  possibility  of  using  funding  from  the  Consent  Decree  fines  to  fund \na  DLC-contracted  auditor  to  review  cases  and  services  in  jails  that  have  accepted  the  enhanced \nJBBS  funding.  This  effort  is  within  the  purview  of  DLC  and  would  harness  that  agency's  expertise \nin  monitoring  and  verifying  contractual  obligations.  The  “fines  committee”  is  unanimously \nsupportive  of this  idea  and  will  begin  practical  steps  to  creating  a  scope  of work  within  the \ncoming  months.\n  \nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  27  of  41 \nPage  27 \nRELEASE  OF  PRETRIAL  DETAINEES  FOR  COMMUNITY-BASED  RESTORATION \nTREATMENT?® \n35.  Release  of Pretrial  Detainees  for  Community-Based Restoration  Treatment.  If the  court releases \nthe  Pretrial  Detainee  on  bond to  commence  Community-Based Restoration  Treatment,  the \nDepartment  shall  coordinate  with the  Court Liaison to  develop  a discharge  plan  (in  a format  approved \nby  the  Special  Master)  within  seven  days  of the  order to  all  parties  involved  in the  Community-Based \nServices  Recipient’s  case,  and the  Court Liaison  and  community-based provider. \nThe  Department  has  made  further  progress  on  the  requirement  to  develop  discharge  plans  for \npersons  identified  as  appropriate  for  Outpatient  Competence  Restoration  programming  (OCRP). \nProgress  is  clear  —  and  important  work  remains  —  in  four  areas: \n1.  Transition  efforts  at  CMHIP:  CMHIP  has  identified  10  patients  currently  treated  at  CMHIP \nthat  could  potentially  transition  to  OCRP  in  the  near  future.  CHMIP  is  planning  to \ntransition  them  to  Restoration  Housing  (formerly  labeled  Fusion  Studios),  though \nRestoration  Housing  is  opening  behind  schedule  and  may  not  accept  admissions  until \nmid-March  .  While  still  unrestored,  their  improved  clinical  status  and  minimal  public \nsafety  concerns  make  them  more  appropriate  for  release  to  OCRP,  rather  than  remaining \nat  CMHIP.  We  affirm  the  Department  taking  this  initiative  and  fully  support  the  transition \nwhen  appropriate.  Still,  however,  no  such  transitions  have  occurred.  We  anticipated \nthat  some  incompetent  defendants  at  CMHIP  would  have  been  transitioned  by  now,  as \nCMHIP  administrators  began  actively  working  on  these  cases  before  our  last  quarterly \nreport.  This  type  of  “step  down”  approach  would  help  decrease  length  of  stay  in  the \nhospital  and  allow  for  more  rapid  admissions  from  the  waitlist.  We  encourage  CMHIP  to \nbe  more  assertive  in  their  efforts  to  make  discharges  actually  occur. \n2.  Impact  of the  Forensic Support  Team  (FST):  As  detailed  in  our January  2019  response  to \nthe  Department’s  plan  for  compliance,  we  envisioned  multiple  roles  for  the  FST. \nPrimarily,  the  FST  was  meant  to  monitor  clinical  and  restoration  progress  for \nincompetent  defendants  in  county jails  awaiting  transfer  to  CMHIP.  Secondarily,  three \nother  roles  were  described:  monitoring  and  coordinating  cases  in  OCRP,  facilitating \ntransfers  from  jail  to  OCRP  when  appropriate,  and  serving  as  the  point  of  contact  for \ncaseloads  regardless  of  restoration  location. \nTo  date,  OBH  has  focused  on  the  first  role  but  has  given  less  attention  to  the  other  roles. \nFST  Navigators  have  spent  most  of their  time  working  with  cases  either  in  jails  or  in \nCMHIP.  FST  Navigators  have  monitored  clinical  status  and  restoration  progress  for  those \n  \n‘8  “Community-Based  Restoration  Treatment”  means  Restoration  Treatment  of a  Community-Based \nRecipient  that  is  ordered  to  be  performed  out  of custody  and  in  conjunction  with  a  community-based \nmental  health  center  or  community  organization.\nNO Afir  PoOoenu S od   PPSeaotR?o SsWeb ao kB.a e LAOSeM  aAHtSaAr Ee ss CAR \nPage  28 \nin  jails  awaiting  transfer  to  CMHIP  —  primarily  defendants  who  have  been  categorized  as \nTier  2.  Navigators  have  also  worked  with  CMHIP  to  begin  facilitating  transfer  of \nincompetent  defendants  to  OCRP,  though  (as  detailed  above}  no  such  transfers  have  yet \noccurred.  Navigators  have  also  reportedly  been  effective  in  securing  emergericy  halds, \nemergency  transters,  and  engaging  in  other  crisis  responses  for  a  handful  of  cases.  We \naffirm  this  important  work. \nHowever,  we  have  continued  to  express  concerns  about  the  allocation  of  FST  Navigator \nresponsibilities.  Navigators  are  working  almost  exclusively  with  in-jail  defendants,  which \nleaves  no  opportunity  to  assist  defendants  transitioning  to  the  community  for  OCRP.  We \nagree  that  the  priority  for  Navigators  must  be  those  defendants  who  remain  in  custody. \nThose  defendants  are,  as  a  group,  most  at  risk  for  crisis.  The  Consent  Decree  mandates \nthat  Navigators  monitor  these  in-jail  defendants  at  least  once  every  ten  days  for  clinical \nStatus  and  restoration  progress;  this  monitoring  addresses  our third  overarching  goal  of \nreducing  harm  (by  providing  care}  to  those  on  the  waitlist.  However,  other  goais  of  the \nConsent  Decree  are  to  reduce  the  number  of  persons  on  the  waitlist  and  reduce  the  time \nspent  on  the  waitlist.  These  goals  are  supported  by  facilitating  transitions  to  OCRP  and \nenhancing  OCRP  services.  Navigators  should  play  critical  roles  in  both. \nAs  a  potential  solution  to  this  gap,  we  are  pleased  with  OBH  efforts  to  coordinate \nrestoration  and  crisis  services  contracts  with  CMHCs  around  the  state,  as  well  as  the \nState  of  Colorado’s  Transition  Specialist  Program,  to  provide  crisis  support  and \npsychosocial  services  to  all  OCRP  participants.  While  these  contracts  will  take  months  to \nbecome  viable,  we  support  the  Department's  efforts  to  identify  and  pursue  alternative \ncrisis  services  for  OCRP  participants. \nIt  appears  that  Navigators  nave  begun  identifying  Tier  2  defendants  who  have  clinically \nStabilized  while  in  jail  and  are  actively  working  with  stakeholders  to  transition  them  to \nOCRP  services.  As  of fanuary  30,  Navigators  identified  approximately  31  individuals \nstatewide  who  could  be  eligible  for  the  dedication  OCRP  housing  at  Fusion  Studios,  and \nthey  have  begun  to  plan  for  their  community  transition.  Sirnilar  efforts  are  underway \nwith  veterans  who  are  ITP  as  well  as  individuals  eligible  for  Denver's  Community-Based \nEnhanced  Restoration  program.  This  is  encouraging  progress,  and  we  affirrn  those \nefforts.  However,  to  date  no  individuals  nave  actually  been  moved  from  Tier  2  to  the \ncommunity.  It  will  be  important  to  see  transfers  occur  within  the  next  quarter. \nRegarding  the  Navigators’  roles  as  enhancing  OCRP  services,  little  progress  has  been \nmade.  OBH  administration  has  been  clear  that  the  15  Navigators  are  stretched  thin, \nleaving  no  time  for  work  in  the  community.  This  unfortunate  scenario  probably  reflects \nsome  failure  to  determine  an  adequate  workforce  during  the  earlier  budget \n \nappropriation  phase.  We  have  submitted  a  response  to  OBH  that  outlines  the  vision  and \nrationale  for  a  community-based  network  of  Navigators.  While  OBH  administration  has \nstated  philosophical  agreement,  they  maintain  that  Pretrial  Detainees  require  most  (if \nnot  ail}  of  their  time.  Two  new  Navigators  (temporary  positions)  have  been  added  within \nNO Afir  PoOoenu S od   PPSeaotR?o SsWeb ao kB.a e LAOSeM  aAHtSaAr Ee ss CAR \nPage  29 \nthe  past  quarter  to  provide  backup  and  overtiow.  However,  their  time  is  also  dedicated \nalmost  exclusively  to  Pretrial  Detainees. \nWhile  we  understand  the  realities  of  Navigator  capacity,  we  maintain  that  Navigators \nshould  be  the  Department's  “face”  of  restoration  in  the  community  —  visisle  experts  in \nthe  restoration  system  who  serve  as  the  OBH  point  of  contact  whenever  needs  are \nidentified.  By  serving  as  the  Department's  restoration  experts  in  the  community, \nNavigators  increase  restoration  success,  troubleshoot  problems,  address  crisis  situations, \nenhance  community  tenure,  and  helo  skeptical  judges  trust  the  Department's  outpatient \nrestoration  services.  The  necessity  of these  roles  is  highlighted  by  the  lack  of  a  statewide \nBridges  liaison  workforce  (discussed  later  in  this  section}. \nWe  are  also  keenly  aware  that  all  reports  of  FST  Navigators  to  date  have  been  anecdotal \nin  nature.  There  is  no  data  dissemination  system  yet  in  place.  The  FST  Director  has \nbegun  to  implement  some  basic  data  collection  and  analysis  with  the  FST.  We  support \nthese  efforts.  However,  much  work  remains  as  to  regular,  consistent,  uniform  data \ncollection  at  an  agency  level.  in  early  January,  we  provided  several  examples  of  data \nmanagement  in  similar  forensic  programs  in  other  states.  As  of  the  writing  of this  report, \nno  FST  outcomes  are  regularly  reported  or  analyzed  to  ensure  fidelity  and  effectiveness. \nPrelirninary  numbers  and  qualitative  anecdotes  are  reasonable  expectations  shortly  after \nthe  launch  of  a  programm,  but  due  to  FST’s  long  planning  history  and  employee \norientation,  we  anticipate  the  Department  can  provide  far  more  FST  date  than  is \ncurrently  being  reported  or  discussed. \nFinally,  the  FST  Director  recently  provided  a  draft  of  FST  expectations  regarding \ndocumentation,  crisis  intervention,  and  face-to-face  contact  with  all  Pretrial  Detainees. \nIn  short,  the  document  requires  that  FST  Navigators  see  each  Pretrial  Detainee  face  ta \nface  once  every  two  weeks.  in  intervening  weeks,  the  Navigator  will  communicate  with \nthe  jail’s  mental  health  multidisciplinary  team,  except  when  certain  circumstances  arise \n(e.g.,  reports  of  suicidal  ideation,  etc.)  that  will  necessitate  weekly  face-to-face  contact. \nThis  is  a  significant  step  forward  in  formalizing  the  FST’s  policies  and  procedures \nregarding  the  cornerstone  of the  FST:  ensuring  that  persons  on  the  waitlist  are  being \nadequately  monitored  for  clinical  status  and  acuity,  and  facilitating  transfers  to  different \nlevels  of  care  when  appropriate.  The  document  is  being  reviewed  oy  DLC  and  we \nanticipate  that  it  will  be  finalized  by  all  parties  within  the  next  two  weeks. \n wU Coordination  with  the  Bridges  program.  As  mentioned  in  previous  quarterly  reports,  the \nBridges  Program  and  FST  must  work  together  to  facilitate  discharge  and  share \nresponsibilities  for  competency-related  cases.  They  both  rely  on  similar  (partially,  but  not \nentirely,  overlapping}  bodies  of  information.  Thus,  the  Department  and  the  Bridges  tearm \nhave  been  actively  working  to  coordinate  services,  so  that  they  can  ultimately  collaborate \nin  a  way  that  minimizes  redundancies  and  gaps.\nOverall,  we  are  pleased  with  the  progress  thus  far  in  this  cormmunication  and \ncollaboration.  The  Memorandum  of Agreement  between  the  two  agencies  has  been \nclase  to  final  for  many  weeks;  once  signed,  it  will  allow  data  and  information  sharing  to \noccur  between  Navigators  and  Haisons.  Ultimately  that  will  greatly  improve  the  ability  of \nboth  agencies  to  facilitate  discharges  and/or  transitions  of Tier  2  individuals  out of  jalis \nand  into  cornmunity  placements  when  appropriate.  The  FST  Director  reports,  however, \nthat  because  liaisons  are  most  often  not  assigned  to  incompetent  defendants, \nexpediating  discharges  and  holding  necessary  court  hearings  is  often  difficult.  FST \nNavigators  have  begun  attempting  to  schedule  hearings  and  bring  relevant  information \nto  court,  but  that  process  is  difficult  because  Navigators  are  not  court  personnel.  So \nalthough  the  two  programs  appear  to  have  made  progress  in  sharing  information  and \nunderstanding  roles  and  expectations  of  each  other,  the  lack  of  liaisons  assigned  to \nincompetent  defendants  has  caused  a  barrier  in  transitioning  Tier  2  individuals  to  the \ncommunity, \nCBER  {Community-Based  Enhanced  Restoration}:  The  CBER  prograrn  is  a  pilot  program \nbased  in  Denver  that  provides  enhanced  mental  health  and  case  management  services  to \na  community-based  restoration  program.  OBH  Is  funcing  the  program  and  has \ncontracted  Mental  Health  Center  of  Denver  to  provide  the  wraparound  and  restoration \nservices.  Particioants  will  be  drawn  from  metro-area  county jails;  Tier  2  individuals  are \ntargeted  for  inclusion.  To  date,  six  individuals  have  been  placed  into  the  program,  and  six \nmore  individuals  have  been  identified  as  clinically  eligible  and  legally  suitable.  OBH \nadministrators  have  dedicated  enough  funding  for  a  total  of  around  25  participants  at \nany  one  time.\n  \nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  31  of  41 \nPage  31 \nTRANSPORTATION  OF  PRETRIAL  DETAINEES \n36.  Transportation  of Pretrial  Detainees.  Ifa Pretrial  Detainee  is  transported to  the  Hospital  for  an \nInpatient  Competency  Evaluation  and the  Department  or  a medical  professional  opines  that the \nPretrial  Detainee  is  incompetent  and the  provisions  of C.R.S.  §  27-65-125  have  been  met,  the \nDepartment  shall  not transport the  Pretrial  Detainee  back to  his/her  originating jail. \nOver  the  past  quarter,  a  total  of  21  defendants  were  admitted  to  CMHIP  for  an  inpatient \ncompetency  evaluation,  of who  13  met  C.R.S.  §  27-65-125  criteria,  according  to  hospital  staff. \nNone  of these  defendants  who  met  civil  commitment  criteria  were  returned  to a  local  jail.7° \nAs  mentioned  in  previous  quarterly  reports,  SB19-223  included  language  that  allows  CMHIP  to \nkeep  defendants  ordered  for  inpatient  evaluation  at  CMHIP  from  the  time  that  the  evaluator \nopines  them  incompetent  to  proceed  (rather  than  requiring  C.R.S.  §  27-65-125  criteria  be  met, \nor  that  the  originating  court  adjudicates  the  defendant  as  incompetent).  This  is  now  found  in \nC.R.S.  §  16-8.5-105  (IV-b-5)  and  reads  as  follows: \nWhen  the  court orders  an  inpatient evaluation,  the  court shall advise  the  defendant  that \nrestoration  services  may  commence  immediately if the  evaluation  concludes  that  the \ndefendant is  incompetent to proceed,  unless  either party objects  at  the  time  of the \nadvisement,  or  within  72  hours  after the  receipt of the  written  evaluation  submitted  to  the \ncourt. \nPolicies  and  procedures  governing  the  decision-making  in  these  circumstances  are  still  in \ndevelopment.  At  times,  CMHIP  may  need  to  balance  these  incompetent  individuals  already  in \nthe  hospital  and  in  need  of  hospital-level  care  with  those  Tier  1  or  Tier  2  defendants  in  county \njails  approaching  their  deadlines  for  admission.  To  date,  decisions  among  these  individuals  have \nbeen  made  primarily  on  clinical  grounds,  but  we  also  understand  the  need  to  admit  individuals \nwho  have  been  waiting  in  county jails  for  extended  periods  of time.  Discussions  between  OBH \nand  DLC  have  been  amiable  and  productive  in  these  challenging  situations. \n  \n‘2  According to  the  January  Special  Master  Compliance  Report  (p.20),  submitted  by  CDHS  on  February  7, \n2020. \n2°  See  the  Department’s  monthly  report  (p.30)  filed  February  7,  2020.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  32  of  41 \nPage  32 \nNOTIFICATION  OF  NON-COMPLIANCE  WITH  TIME  FRAMES \n38.

The  account will  be  managed  by  a  court-appointed  administrator.  Decisions \nconcerning  payments  out  of the  account will  be  made  by  a committee  consisting  of a representative \nfrom  the  Plaintiff,  a representative  from  the  Department,  and the  Special  Master.  Any  disputes \nregarding  the  fines  shall  be  handled through the  dispute  resolution  process  identified  in Paragraph  59. \nThe  Department  has  continued  to  provide  reliable  notification  of  non-compliance  of time  frames \non  a  weekly  basis,  as  required  by  the  Consent  Decree  (since  June  1,  2019).  Likewise,  the \nDepartment  has  completed  a  “Fines  Report,”  as  prescribed  by  the  Consent  Decree.  Finally,  as \nprescribed  by  the  Consent  Decree,  the  Department  has  been  paying  these  fines  into  a  trust \naccount  (managed  by  Cordes  &  Company,  LLP). \nThe  funds  from  these  fines  are  already  going  to  good  use.  A  small  committee  comprising \nDepartment  administration  (Worthwein,  Shah),  a  representative  from  the  Plaintiff  (i.e.,  Disability \nLaw  Colorado  leader,  lvandick),  and  the  Special  Masters  has  met  regularly  for  several  months  to \naddress  use  of these  fines.  The  broad  goal  is  to  use  the  funds  in  ways  that  help  those  involved  in \nthe  mental  health  and  criminal  justice  systems  (i.e.,  those  who  are,  or  are  likely  to  become, \ninvolved  in  competency-related  services),  and  to  reduce  Colorado’s  “competency  crisis,”  by \nproviding  new  services  or  interventions  that  do  not  already  fall  within  the  Department’s \nresponsibilities.  In  other  words,  funds  from  the  fines  should  supplement  and  not  replace  existing \nservices. \nThe  first  opportunity  to  use  these  funds  for  prompt  services  emerged  when  the  Colorado \nCoalition  for  the  Homeless  (CCH)  was  renovating  a  hotel  to  create  Fusion  Studios,  which \ncomprise  182  single-unit  residences  for  homeless  individuals.  Because  CCH  has  a  strong  record \nof fiscal  responsibility  and  successful  housing  interventions,  the  Department  explored  a \ncollaboration  to  dedicate  new  residences  to  those  involved  in  the  competency  system, \nparticularly  defendants  who  could  be  eligible  for  community-based  competence  restoration  if\nNO Afir  PoOoenu S od   PPSeaotR?o SsWeb ao kB.a e LAOSeM  aAHtSaAr Ee ss CAR \nPage  33 \nthey  had  access  to  housing  (a  lack  of  housing  is  a  common  barrier  to  outpatient  restoration \ntreatment}.  UHimately,  in  an  arrangement  finalized  on  October  2,  2019,  the  Fines  Committee \ncontributed  53.5  million  to  the  “Fusion  Studios”  project  (now  labeled  Restoration  Housing},  in \nexchange  for  28  dedicated  residences  for  competence-involved  individuals  whom  the \nDepartment  refers,  over  the  next  five  years.  Fusion  Studios  opened  on  January  21,  2020  and \nbepan  taking  referrals  days  afterward.  The  Forensic  Support  Team  and  CMHIP  are  both \nidentifying  defendants  who  could  transition  to  the  housing  project.  They  are  targeting \ndefendants  who  are  ready  to  transition  out  of the  hospital  or jail  and  continue  restoration \nservices  in  the  community.  First  placements  should  occur  in  March  2020,  which  is  somewhat \nlater  than  anticipated. \nThough  the  Fines  Committee  has  not  finalized  the  next  funding  priorities,  the  Committee  is \ninvestigating  a  pilot  test  of  a  “competency  dacket”  or  “competency  calendar”  in  a  Colorado \nDistrict.  We  have  researched  and  consulted  with  other  jurisdictions  around  the  country,  and  it  is \nclear  competency-specific  dockets  offer  a  number  of  advantages  to  courts  and  defendants,  and \ntend  to  expedite  competency-related  procedures  in  ways  would  help  defendants  and  the \nDepartment  waitlists.  Furthermore,  Judges  in  Colorado’s  18\"  Judicial  District  are  highly \nmotivated  to  establish  a  competency  docket.  They  have  been  given  support  from  the  Chief \nJustice  and  have  expanded  the  pilot  to  include  both  Arapahoe  and  Douglas  County  courts.  They \nhave  asked  for  little  in  terms  of funding,  aside  from  a  court-based  evaluator  position  to  provide \nquick  turnaround  competency  evaluations  and  provide  advice  as  to  the  eligibility  for  community- \nbased  restoration  treatment.  The  planning  is  stil  underway;  we  anticipate  this  will  be  our  next \nhigh  priority  for  funding,  and  likely  make  a  significant  contribution  to  expediting  competency- \nrelated  services  in  this  District  (and  likely  beyond,  to  the  extent  this  serves  as  a  model  for  other \nDistricts  to  replicate). \nAdditional  ideas  for  funding  include  a  case  manager  for  the  Fusion  Studios  ITP  population,  an \naudit  of  enhanced  JBBS  funding  across  the  state,  in-depth  data  analysis  of forensic  data  trends \nwithin  OBH,  and  development  of  specialized  curriculum  for  OCRP  providers  and  participants.  We \nwill  continue  to  pursue  these  ideas  as  each  are  both  relatively  short-term  and  affordable.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  34  of  41 \nPage  34 \nCONSENT  DECREE  SECTION  VII  UPDATES \nCIVIL  BED  FREEZE \n39.  Civil  Bed Freeze.  The  Department’s  2018  Plan  included  an  effort to  freeze  civil  admissions  to  its \nbeds  to  devote  Hospital  beds  to  perform  Inpatient Restoration  Treatment  services.  On February  7, \n2019,  the  Department  agreed to  stop  this  practice.  The  Department will  continue  to  leave  the  state’s \ncivil  and juvenile  beds  allocated  as  of the  execution  of this  Consent Decree  for  civil  and juvenile \npsychiatric  admissions  and  will  not  freeze  or  convert those  beds  to  provide  competency  services  for \nPretrial  Detainees,  unless  the  Department receives  prior  agreement  from  the  Special  Master to  use \nunutilized beds  for  such  purposes.  This  strategy  to  facilitate  compliance  with the  Consent Decree \nshall  only  be  re-implemented  in the  future  upon  agreement  of the  Special  Master. \nThe  Department  continues  to  report  that  they  have  removed  the  “civil  bed  freeze”  as  mandated \nby  the  Consent  Decree.  That  is,  they  have  not  re-purposed  the  civil  beds  at  CMHIFL  for \ncompetence  restoration,  as  they  had  once  proposed.  Per  our  request,  the  Department \ncontinues  to  provide  a  census  report  on  the  CMHIFL  patients  in  their  monthly  report.  As  of their \nmost  recent  report,  the  CMHIFL  population  included  a  total  of  90  patients,  89  of whom  were  civil \npatients. \nDuring  monthly  multi-party  meetings,  the  Department  has  discussed  any  potential  changes  to \nthe  use  of  any  CMHIFL  beds  (e.g.,  allocating  a  few  new  beds  at  CMHIFL  to  accommodate \ninpatient  competence  evaluations  —  not  restoration  —  which  may  reduce  the  need  to  transport \nDenver-area  defendants  to  CMHIP  for  inpatient  evaluation).  Generally,  the  Plaintiffs  and  Special \nMasters  have  agreed  with  the  minor  changes  they  have  proposed,  because  these  tend  to  reflect \nefficient  steps  that  better  serve  the  Departments’  consumers. \nFor  the  foreseeable  future,  the  Department  will  continue  to  wrestle  with  the  reality  that  too  few \ncivil  beds  exist  in  Colorado.  A  potential,  albeit  indirect,  benefit  of the  Consent  Decree  may  be  to \nincrease  civil  capacity  through  the  reduced  need  for  forensic  beds;  the  Department  will  need  to \ncontinue  to  monitor  this  trend  and  the  outcomes  of  Consent  Decree  initiatives  to  determine  the \nongoing  and  future  needs  for  civil  beds.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  35  of  41 \nPage  35 \nCOMPREHENSIVE  AND  COHESIVE  PLAN \n40.  Comprehensive  and  Cohesive  Plan.  The  Special  Master’s  first recommendation  was  to  revise  the \nDepartment’s  2018  Plan  into  a more  comprehensive  and  cohesive  plan.  Dkt.  146.  By  or  about \nJanuary  2020,  the  Department will  produce  an  initial  plan resulting  from  a long-term  visioning \nprocess  with DLC,  the  Special  Master,  and  stakeholders  that will  consolidate  disparate  pieces  of the \nDepartment’s  current plan,  along  with  legislative  initiatives,  in  a cohesive  package  for  courts, \nadministrators,  service  providers,  and  legislators  to  consider.  As  referenced  in the  Special  Master’s \nRecommendation Number  7,  the  2020  Plan will  highlight the  methods  to  prioritize  quality  amid \nquantity  and time  pressures.  Dkt.  146  at  42.  On  an  annual  basis  thereafter,  the  Department  will \nreview  and  revise  the  plan  as  appropriate  based  upon  data provided by  the  Department. \nThe  Department  has  finalized  a  comprehensive,  cohesive  plan  as  of  February  27,  2020.  As  we \ndetailed  in  prior  quarterly  reports,  the  Department  met  routinely  with  stakeholders,  and \ncoordinated  their  work  with  the  Governor’s  Blueprint  Task  Force  subcommittee  that  is \naddressing  competence-related  issues.  Crucially,  the  Department  has  conceptualized \ncompetency-related  services  in  a  far  broader  way  than  they  had  in  their  December  2018  report. \nThey  detailed  much  of their  progress  to  date,  and  remaining  goals,  all  of which  reflect  a  much \nmore  comprehensive,  multi-faceted  approached  to  the  competency  crisis,  as  compared  to  their \nearlier  efforts. \nRelated  to  the  Comprehensive  plan,  we  encourage  the  Department  to  continue  planning  for  the \n2020  legislative  session.  They  have  been  exploring  potential  legislation  that  may  improve \ncompetency  services  and  better  address  the  population  of  individuals  likely  to  be  involved  in  the \ncompetency  system.  Importantly,  they  have  done  some  of this  in  collaboration  with  DLC  and \nother  stakeholders.  To  date,  potential  legislation  includes  increasing  OBH  oversight  regarding \njail-based  mental  health  services,  decreasing  competency  mandates  for  lowest-level  offenders, \nand  adjusting  competency  re-evaluation  time  frames.  Other  legislation  the  Department  is \nconsidering  would  expand  the  pool  of  competence  evaluators  to  include  licensed  clinicians  with \nMaster’s-level  degrees  (versus  only  doctoral  degrees).  While  this  approach  may  ultimately  prove \nnecessary  to  develop  the  workforce  needed  for  increasing  competency  evaluations  (particularly \ncommunity-based  competency  evaluations),  we  are  not  convinced  it  is  necessary  at  this  time. \nRather,  we  have  encouraged  the  Department  to  vigorously  pursue  several  strategies  to  expand \nthe  workforce  of  doctoral-level  evaluators.  They  have  agreed  to  do  so,  but  are  also \nsimultaneously  pursuing  this  legislation  should  expanding  to  Master’s-level  evaluators  eventually \nbecome  necessary.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  36  of  41 \nPage  36 \nINCREASE  COMMUNITY  RESTORATION  SERVICES \n41.  (a)  Implement  a  coordinated  wide-scale  outpatient  (community-based)  competency  restoration \n(OCR)  system.  This  system  shall  be  integrated  and  submitted with the  “Comprehensive  and \nCohesive  Plan”  referenced  in Paragraph  40  herein.  This  plan  shall  be  approved  by  the  Special \nMaster. \nAs  reflected  in  past  quarterly  reports,  the  Department  continues  developing  a  wide-scale \noutpatient  competence  restoration  treatment  program  (OCRP).  Their  formal  OCRP  program \nbegan  in  March  of  2018,  and  referrals  for  outpatient  restoration  ranged  from  26  -  46  defendants \nper  month  during  the  past  quarter  (a  wider  range,  and  a  smaller  number,  than  the  prior  quarter). \nAt  this  point,  OCRP  is  nearing  its  two-year  anniversary.  As  such,  most  counties  and  community \nmental  health  centers  (CMHCs)  across  Colorado  now  offer  some  form  of  OCRP.  There  are  53 \ncontracts  in  place  around  the  state.  This  statewide  system  is  fairly  unique  in  the  US;  very  few \nother  states  have  such  a  robust  statewide  OCRP  presence.  Only  one  CMHC  is  refusing  to  offer \nOCRP  in  Colorado,  and  only  four  counties  remain  without  viable  OCRP  options  (see  graphic \nbelow,  copied  from  the  January  2020  Monthly  Compliance  Report): \nOutpatient Restoration  Services \n  \nServices \nBB Services Available \n[5 Services Currently Not Available\nPage  37 \nThe  Department  continues  te  pursue  contracts  and  services  for  those  areas  in  which  services  are \nnot  yet  avallable.  However,  we  recommend  a  shift  in  efforts  for  OCRP  at  this  two-year \nanniversary.  While  soliciting  services  in  unserved  areas,  we  encourage  OBH  to  begin  shifting \nFocus  to  ensuring  quality  among  their  current  providers.  This  is  accomplished  by  first  developing \nand  utilizing  a  robust  data  collection  and  analysis  plan.  OCRP  administrators  have  produced  the \nfirst  iteration  of  data;  however,  the  data  is  spare  and  fairly  general.  We  encourage  more \ndetailed  data  amenable  to  further  analysis;  we  also  request  that  the  data  be  provided  in  the \nMonthly  Compliance  Report.  We  have  provided  the  Departrnent  with  more  than  a  dozen \nvariables  we  recommend  for  data  collection  and  reporting;  these  variables  are  common  metrics \nacross  other  states’  outpatient  restoration  programs. \nSecondly,  we  encourage  the  Department  to  develop  some  specialized  OCRP  programs  — \n“centers  of  restoration  excellence.”  While  there  are  some  commonalities  across  defendants, \nthere  are  also  distinct  groups  with  similar  barriers  to  competence.  Special  populations \n(defendants  with  intellectual  disabilities,  traumatic  brain  injuries  or  other  cognitive  disabilities, \nsexual  offense  charges,  or juvenile  defendants}  have  needs  that  differentiate  them  from  other \ngroups.  Some  providers  may  wish  to  specialize  in  one  or  more  of these  specialty  areas  (and \nsome  may  be  more  or  less  skilled  with  certain  groups  of  defendants},  which  would  optimize \nrestoration  efforts  in  much  the  sarne  way  specialty  courts  address  specific  niches  in  criminal  law. \nSuch  specialized  providers  wouid  also  make  referrals  and  communication  more  efficient. \nTo  date,  OBH  has  focused  on  training  providers  to  fidelity  to  the  “Compkit”  model  of  restoration; \nwhile  this  is  a  normative  develoomental  process,  at  this  stage,  Coloraco’s  OCRP  should  begin  to \nshift  away  from  initial  uniform  training  and  into  more  sophisticated,  nuanced  modeis  of \nrestoration.  We  affirm  efforts  that  OCRP  administrators  and  partnered  organizations  nave \nworked  to  enhance  wrap-around  and  psychosocial  services  for  OCRP  participants  (e.g.,  housing, \ncase  management,  among  others).  We  encourage  the  development  of this  “expanded  view’  of \nOCRP  in  Colorado  —  beyond  uniform  restoration  classes  and  required  numbers  of visits  and  inte \na  more  individually-tailored  approach  that  addresses  both  restoration  and  broader  mental  health \nneeds. \nAnother  positive  development  has  been  the  convening  of the  “Placement  Committee,”  a  team  of \nexpert  advisors  mandated  by  $B19-223.  This  committee  will  help  define  clinical  criteria  that \nCourt  Services  evaluators  will  use  to  determine  if  an  incompetent  defendant  merits  inpatient  or \ncommunity-based  restoration  treatment.  Beginning  in  July  2020,  statute  will  require  evaluators \nto  offer  these  placement  opinions.  The  committee  is  soliciting  input  from  Court  Services \nevaluators  to  develop  placement  criteria  and  decision  points;  once  finalized,  this  should  help \nreduce  the  nurnber  of  people  on  the  waitiist  since  evaluators  will  be  required  to  make  those \ndifferential  recommendations  (community-based  vs.  inpatient  restoration}.  Our  previous  review \nof  the  triage  sections  of  evaluator  reports  was  encouraging  in  that  several  evaluators  have  been \naddressing  the  placement  decision  already;  moreover,  their  rationale  and  criteria  used  have \ngenerally  been  solid.  We  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Placement  Committee  to  further \nrefine  these  criteria.\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  38  of  41 \nPage  38 \nRelatedly,  some  stakeholders  are  drafting  legislation  that  would  make  community-based \nrestoration  the  default  setting  for  restoration,  such  that  evaluators  would  need  to  “make  the \ncase”  for  inpatient  restoration.  Several  states  have  adopted  this  approach  without  problem.  We \nsupport  this  legislative  initiative. \n41.  (b)  The  Department may  utilize  private  hospital  beds  to  meet the  needs  of Pretrial  Detainees \nmeeting  C.R.S.  §  27-65-105(a)  civil  commitment  criteria  and with  prioritization to  Pretrial  Detainees \nalready  residing  within the  same  geographic  location.  The  Department  shall  create  a plan to \nimplement this  subsection  (b)  to  be  approved  by  the  Special  Master. \nThe  Department  has  contracted  with  a  local  hospital  to  provide  ten  inpatient  beds  for  short-term \ncompetency  related  services.  These  beds  are  currently  filled.  OBH  is  close  to  finalizing  a \ncontract  with  an  additional  private  hospital  in  the  Denver  metro  area  for  3-5  additional  beds,  and \nanother  contract  is  under  initial  discussion  for  6-10  beds  at  a  private  hospital  on  the  Western \nSlope.  We  facilitated  a  discussion  with  OBH  and  DLC  to  confirm  that  this  increase  is  warranted \nand  reasonable;  all  parties  agreed  in  theory  to  the  increase  in  private  hospital  beds.  The \nDepartment  has  responded  well  to  our January  2019  recommendation  to  assertively  develop \ncommunity  options  rather  than  rely  on  simply  procuring  more  inpatient  beds.  Because  of this \nprogress,  the  rise  in  privately-contracted  beds  seems  appropriate  (and  can  be  an  essential \nresource  in  some  cases).  Private  hospital  beds  may  be  an  especially  viable  resource  for  female \nPretrial  Detainees,  because  females  tend  to  face  longer  waits  for  inpatient  services  at  CMHIP. \n41.  (c)  The  Department  currently  estimates  that  10-20%  of Pretrial  Detainees  admitted  for  inpatient \nrestoration  do  not need  hospital-level  care.  Dkt.  146  at 29.  The  Department will  make  best  efforts  to \nreduce  inpatient  restoration  hospitalizations  by  10%  and  increase  community  restorations  by  10%  in \nsix-month  increments  beginning  June  1,  2019.  The  baseline  for the  preceding  sentence  will  be \ndetermined  by  the  Special  Master  by  June  1,  2019,  utilizing  data provided by  the  Department.  On \nJune  1,  2020,  the  Special  Master will  establish  a modification  of this  guideline  based  upon  a  survey  of \nthe  data  collection  and  implementation  of the  Department’s  Plan. \nAs  prescribed  in  the  Consent  Decree,  we  established  a  Baseline  for  improvement  by  calculating  a \nsix-month  period  of  available  data  (i.e.,  Nov  2018  -  April  2019)  prior  to  the  June  1,  2019  deadline. \nWe  also  recommended  using  proportional  metrics  when  pursuing  goals  that  are  fundamentally \nproportional  in  nature  (i.e.,  a  10%  increase  in  community-based  restoration  and  a  10%  decrease \nin  inpatient  restoration).  In  other  words,  while  the  Department  may  not  have  full  control  over \nthe  actual  number  of  referrals,  they  have  greater  control  over  the  proportion  of  referrals  they \ndirect  to  outpatient  versus  inpatient  restoration.  Therefore,  we  chose  to  set  the  baseline \nfigures,  and  establish  subsequent  performance  goals,  based  on  proportions  instead  of raw \nnumbers.  Thus,  calculating  target  goals  for  restoration  based  on  these  percentages  of individuals \nreferred  to  inpatient  versus  outpatient  services  yields  the  following  goals:\nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  39  of  41 \nPage  39 \n  \nInpatient  Restorations  Outpatient  Restorations \n  \nInitial  baseline  Nov  2018 — April  2019:  69%  Nov  2018 — April  2019:  31% \nDecember  1,  2019 goal  69%  reduced  by  10%  =  62%  31%  increased  by  10%  =  34% \n   December  1,  2019  numbers  June  1—-  Dec  1,  2019  =  62%  June  1—  Dec  1,  2019  =  34%    \nJune  1,  2020 goal  62%  reduced  by  10%  =  56%  34%  increased  by  10%  =  37% \nRecent  progress  (past  6  months)  Aug  1,  2019 —  Feb  1,  2020:  66%  Aug  1,  2019 —  Feb  1,  2020:  34% \nNote:  All  percentages  rounded  to  nearest  1%. \n  \nThe  Department  met  their  goal  to  increase  OCRP  referrals  by  10%  in  the  six  months  after  May \n2019.  The  portion  of  defendants  referred  to  OCRP  between  June  and  December  averaged  34%. \nThe  Consent  Decree  now  mandates  another  10%  shift  in  referrals  between  inpatient  and \noutpatient  restoration,  so  that  by June  1,  2020  a  total  of  37%  of  all  restoration  orders  should  be \nreferred  to  OCRP.  The  most  recent  six  months  (Aug  2019  -  Jan  2020)  show  an  average  of  34%  of \nrestoration  cases  ordered  to  OCRP.  Unfortunately,  after  steady  gains  from  June  through \nNovember  2019,  the  Department  has  seen  a  drastic  decline  in  the  percentage  of  adults  referred \nto  OCRP  in  the  past  two  months. \nDue  to  these  recent  dips  in  OCRP  orders,  we  doubt  that  the  Department  will  be  able  to  attain \ncompliance  with  Paragraph  41  of the  Consent  Decree  by  increasing  outpatient  restoration  to \n37%,  on  average,  for  the  period  spanning  December  1,  2019  through  June  1,  2020.  While  we \ncontinue  to  view  the  37%  aspirational  goal  as  largely  reasonable,  it  seems  unlikely  that  the \nDepartment  will  reach  it  unless  dramatic  increases  occur  soon  —  and  are  maintained \nconsistently.  However,  even  with  the  recent  dips,  the  Department  is  still  maintaining  a  34%  rate \nof  adults  ordered  to  OCRP  during  the  past  six  months.  This  is  a  substantial  increase  as  compared \nto  the  rate  in  the  six  months  surrounding  implementation  of the  Consent  Decree  (28%). \nAdditionally,  we  have  encouraged  the  Department  to  carefully  assess  which  participants  are \nappropriately  positioned  for  success  in  the  OCRP  system,  and  only  refer  those  types  of  persons \nto  the  program.  If that  referral  rate  is  ultimately  less  than  37%  of the  total  number  found  ITP,  we \nsupport  lowering  the  aspirational  goal  accordingly.  We  aim  to  place  the  maximum  number  of \nappropriate  persons  in  OCRP,  but  are  not  wedded  to  a  predetermined  rate  if  it  exceeds  the \nactual  number  of  defendants  appropriate  for  OCRP.  We  have  broached  this  subject  with  both \nparties,  and  both  are  amenable  to  a  marginally  smaller  percentage  goal  if  indeed  all  appropriate \nOCRP  referrals  are  made.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  the  rate;  we  believe  it  can  certainly \nincrease  with  continued  judicial  education,  coordination  with  the  Bridges  program,  onboarding \nof  new  OCRP  providers,  and  clearer  guidelines  for  Court  Services  evaluators.  Of  course,  if\nPage  40 \ndrafted  2020  legislation  passes,  OCRP  referral  rates  may  increase  even  further  if  statutes  define \nOCRP  as  the  default  setting  for  restoration,  or  if  low  level  charges  are  statutorily  excluded  from \ninpatient  restoration  in  most  cases. \nAgain,  we  reinforce  the  need  for  OBH  to  provide  outcome  data  on  OCRP.  We  have  received  one \nbasic  report  of  OCRP  outcomes  to  date.  While  helpful,  more  regular  reporting  and  more \nsophisticated  data  analyses  are  critically  needed.  We  have  sent  4  request  of  OCRP  data  elements \nto  OBH;  we  will  discuss  these  requests  in  mid-February  2020.  Although  OBH  has  many \nconcurrent  data  requests,  we  continue  to  strongly  request  empirical  outcome  data  for  OCRP \n(and  the  FST,  as  mentioned  earlier),\n  \nCase  1:11-cv-02285-NYW  Document  189  Filed  03/03/20  USDC  Colorado  Page  41  of  41 \nPage  41 \nCONCLUSION \nAs  detailed  throughout  this  report,  we  perceive  the  Department  has  made  significant  and \nmeaningful  progress  in  enacting  changes  prescribed  in  the  Consent  Decree.  Indeed,  several  key \ninterventions  prescribed  by  the  Consent  Decree  (e.g.,  the  triage  system,  the  Forensic  Support \nTeam)  have  become  Tully  operational  during  this  reporting  period.  These  have  begun  to \nsignificantly  change  the  overall  key  metrics,  in  that  the  Department  is  generally  responding \npromptly  to  those  identified  as  Tier  1.  Put  simply,  the  most  acutely  ill  defendants  —  those \nwhose  welfare  was  a  primary  focus  in  the  current  legislation  and  Consent  Decree  —  do  seem  to \nbe  receiving  more  prompt  treatment  upon  launch  of the  Triage  System.  Other  improvements  are \nalso  clear,  as  the  overall  wait  list  has  decreased  meaningfully  in  the  past  quarter,  and  is  lower \nthan  at  any  point  in  recent  history.  On  the  other  hand,  it  remains  for  the  Department  to  begin \naccelerating  inpatient  restoration  treatment  for  Tier  2  defendants,  whose  needs  may  be  less \nurgent,  but  nevertheless  important.  Finally,  the  Department  must  work  aggressively  to  develop \nan  adequate  workforce  of forensic  evaluators,  and  overcome  the  recent,  significant  setback  In \nmeeting  evaluation  deadlines.  We  will  continue  to  work  with  the  Department  on  these  and \nrelated  matters,  and  we  encourage  you  to  contact  us  with  any  questions  or  requests.  We \nappreciate  the  opportunity  to  serve  the  court,  and  the  state  of  Colorado,  in  these  important \nefforts. \nVelPyoe   \n  \nNeil  Gowensmith,  Ph.D. \nPresident,  Groundswell  Services  Inc. \n“  a  = \neff  of  AS  _ \n~.

As you know, the Consent \nDecree (following your earlier court order) requires us to monitor progress and provide \nrecommendations for improvement to the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS; \nhereafter the Department) as they attempt to improve competency-related services to criminal \ndefendants with psychiatric illness.  Specifically, the Consent Decree (p.24) indicates,  \n(i)  As part of the duties, the Special Master shall provide the Court and the Parties with status \nreports every other month for the first six months, and then quarterly thereafter.  The Special \nMaster’s status report was submitted on January 28, 2019.  Dkt. 146.  The next report shall be \nsubmitted to the Court and the Parties on March 28, 2019, and then May 28, 2019, and then \nquarterly thereafter.  Such reports shall address the Department’s compliance with the \ntimeframe requirements of the Consent Decree concerning Competency Services and shall \nprovide a detailed summary of information and recommendations the Special Master believes \nthe Court and Parties should consider relating to the Department’s compliance with the \nConsent Decree timeframes concerning Competency Services.   \n(ii) The Special Master’s report shall include, but is not limited to, reporting on the number of \nPretrial Detainees ordered to receive Competency Services, an assessment of the \nDepartment’s operations, systems, and admissions practices and policies relating to the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with the Consent Decree timeframes, and guidance to the \nDepartment for improvement and increasing efficiencies in these areas.   \nAs you know, the Consent Decree filed March 15, 2019 prescribed a variety of steps the \nDepartment must take to improve the competency assessment and restoration system in \nColorado, and eventually attain compliance with all time frames and deadlines mandated in the \nConsent Decree.  The Department has initiated many of these steps, demonstrating meaningful \n                                                        \n \n1 Per prior agreement with the court, we are submitting the May 28 report one week later, on June 5, so \nthat we are able to further discuss an arrangement the parties were negotiating during the final days of \nMay and initial days of June (i.e., an agreement about how to handle fines that accrue solely due to \nCOVID-related delays).   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 41\nPage 3 \n \nprogress, in ways we detail through the remainder of this report.

After the Consent Decree was filed in March 2019, the \nDepartment began taking many of these steps (detailed throughout this report) in ways that we \nconsider generally responsive, and in ways that appear to recognize the gravity and complexity \nof the challenges they face.  The Consent Decree has now been in effect for more than one year.  \nPlanning and implementation phases are generally complete, and we have had the opportunity \nto observe the launch and early stages of the new initiatives the Consent Decree prescribed.   \n \nBroadly speaking, we consider three goals of these initiatives, and the Consent Decree overall, as \nprimary:  \na) Reducing the overall number of people on the waitlist for competence restoration \nservices,  \nb) Reducing the wait times for people on the waitlist, particularly people with the most \nacute psychiatric illness, and  \nc) Reducing harm (by providing care) to people on the waitlist.   \n \nProgress on the first goal is clear; there has been a steady and meaningful decrease in the \nwaitlist over the past six months.  Progress on the second goal has been substantial, though only \nfor people with the most acute psychiatric illness; those with less urgent needs continue to \nexperience delays that are decreasing, but still excessive.  Finally, progress towards the third goal \nhas been improving.  The Department has provided prompt care by hospitalizing those who are \nmost ill, and providing services to those waiting longer in the jails.  This report details progress \non these three primary markers as well as other key developments.  However, our discussion of \nthe past quarter will differ considerably from prior reports, because this quarter has been so \ngreatly influenced by the global COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nOverview of Progress this Quarter amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: \n \nLike almost everything else in the Spring of 2020, the Department’s work this quarter has been \ndramatically altered by the COVID-19 pandemic. When we submitted our quarterly report at the \nend of February, there was little appreciation in the United States for the impending impact of \nthe COVID-19 virus.  However, by mid-March, it was clear the virus would likely cause a global \npandemic with substantial impact on almost every aspect of public life, including the criminal \njustice system and public mental health services.  Within just a few more weeks — near the end \nof March — it was clear that the virus was impacting all of the Department’s services, and \nparticularly people identified in the Consent Decree (i.e., those awaiting or receiving competency \nservices).  \n \nIndeed, competency services may have been particularly vulnerable to the impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic because they lie at the intersection of multiple systems — the courts, jails, and the \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 41\nPage 6 \n \nDepartment — each of which has been attempting to reduce human contact in order to slow the \nspread of the COVID-19 virus.  Though the Department has control over their own services, they \nhave less influence over the other systems in which competency-involved individuals reside, so \nmany of the Department’s functions have been fluid: for example, changing in response to the \nchanging policies and practices of courts and jails.  Primary examples of the COVID impact on \nDepartment services include: \n \nCompetency Evaluations:   \nMany jails have forbidden all visits from external professionals, including the Department’s \nforensic evaluators, causing delays in evaluations.  Fortunately, with some jails, the Department \nhas established arrangements (and even provided the necessary technology) to conduct \nevaluations via video-conference, an approach that is sometimes less-than-optimal (under \ntypical circumstances), but under current circumstances is far preferable to further delays.  With \nother jails, the Department has developed alternate procedures, sometimes involving non-\ncontact visits and other more socially-distant, protected approaches in order to continue \nconducting competency evaluations.   \n \nMental Health Services for those Awaiting Competency-restoration Services:   \nFortunately, the Forensic Support Team (FST) and their Forensic Navigators — mandated by the \nConsent Decree to monitor defendants in jail awaiting competency restoration services — had \nfully launched a few months before the pandemic began.  These early months allowed them to \ndevelop procedures and relationships with the jails before many jails closed to visitors in \nresponse to COVID. Once many jails closed to visitors, the FST had little opportunity to monitor \ndefendants face-to-face.  Instead, they quickly developed procedures to check on defendants \nusing telephone communication with jail Mental Health staff.  The FST (and even CMHIP) worked \nwith jail staff to respond to defendants with acute psychiatric needs, sometimes arranging for \ntransfer to a private psychiatric hospital or to CMHIP.  The Department reports these efforts \nhave been successful; there is little evidence to suggest severe problem or crises among \ndefendants waiting in jails.  But we acknowledge that the reduced face-to-face contacts by FST, \nand the increased reliance on jail staff, leave us concerned about the potential to overlook some \ndefendants who remain symptomatic or suffering in more subtle ways.  \n \nInpatient Competency Restoration Services: \nAmid the public-safety precautions that limit human contact, defendants found incompetent to \nstand trial and ordered to inpatient restoration services tend to move more slowly into those \ninpatient services.  CMHIP has begun following something like an emerging best practice, \nadmitting defendants in cohorts that essentially separate them into groups, and monitoring \nthem for 14 days before admitting them into broader hospital population.  They have created \n“safe zones” or quarantine strategies that greatly reduce the possibility of a newly-admitted \ndefendant infecting others.  This strategy appears generally successful, in that infection rates at \nCMHIP have remained very low since the onset of the pandemic.  Discharges from CMHIP have \nalso slowed, because courts are holding fewer hearings, and many jails and other facilities are \ndeclining (or delaying) to accept defendants transferring from the hospitals, as part of their own \nefforts to reduce infection risks.  Not surprisingly then, recent data reveal that admissions and \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 41\nPage 7 \n \ndischarge numbers were far below typical rates.  Obviously, these decreased rates yield poorer \nperformance on some of the key metrics prescribed in the Consent Decree, including the metrics \nby which the Department incurs fines. \n \nFines: \nWith certain Department functions greatly altered or slowed by COVID-19, the Department is \nincurring fines (i.e., the Consent-Decree mandated fines for exceeding prescribed time limits) to \na greater degree than in prior months.  This has raised questions about how to handle these \nfines.  All parties (i.e., the Department, Disability Law Colorado, and Special Master) agree \nconceptually that the Department should not be penalized for delays caused solely by COVID-19.  \nAlthough COVID-19 is, conceptually, a “Special Circumstance” as defined in the Consent Decree, \nthe Consent Decree precludes invoking Departmental Special Circumstances until a later date.  \nThus, all parties have been considering a potential agreement wherein the Department commits \nto paying fines they would have incurred absent COVID-19, but need not pay additional fines \nthat appear solely due to COVID-19.  Recently, the Department has provided DLC with an \nestimate (including an independent estimate by a statistician otherwise uninvolved in the \nConsent Decree matters) of the fines they would have incurred absent COVID (roughly $2 \nmillion), and has proposed an agreement in which they pay that fine amount and any additional \nfines they may incur for delays in jail-based evaluations.2  As we finalize this report, DLC is \nconsidering this proposal and crafting a response.  Thus, we cannot yet describe a resolution \namong the parties regarding fines for the coming year, but we are hopeful a negotiated \nresolution is forthcoming.  We have reviewed the estimated fines amount and the statistical \nmodel underlying those projected figures, and we believe both are generally reasonable.  We \nhave also appreciated the candor and careful consideration of “checks and balances” to ensure \nthat the Department will maintain diligent work regardless of fines.  We are optimistic that an \nagreement will be reached and that more formal mediation can be avoided; however, if formal \nmediation or proceedings become necessary, we will inform you immediately.      \n \nTo be clear, the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic could be worse.  Though the pandemic \nhas inevitably slowed many Department functions and created new barriers, the pandemic has \nalso slowed some of the demands on the Department.  Perhaps most obviously, law \nenforcement has made fewer arrests, and court operations have slowed, leaving fewer court \norders for competence evaluation or restoration.  This is reflected in the current number of \nPretrial Detainees on the waitlist as we finalize this report (71), far lower than any month since \nthe Consent Decree took effect.  Of course, these decreased court orders are not enough to \noffset the other challenges and delays the Department faces, but all parties are grateful that \n                                                        \n \n2 The proposed agreement relates only to fines for inpatient evaluation and restoration, not jail-based \nevaluations.   Although the Consent Decree precludes invoking Departmental Special Circumstances at \nthis time, the Department can invoke Individual Special Circumstances for particular defendants.  Thus, \nwhen particular defendants in jail cannot be evaluated in a timely manner because of COVID-attributable \ndelays (e.g., when a jail forbids visits by evaluators and does not allow an option for evaluations via video) \nthe Department can invoke Individual Special Circumstances. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 41\nPage 8 \n \nthere are fewer defendants entering the competency system, amid the other challenges of \nserving defendants in the COVID-19 era.  \n \nSpecial Master Roles: \nAmid the changes prompted by COVID-19, we have had to modify the way we perform our \nSpecial Master duties as well.  Obviously, travel and on-site meetings are temporarily suspended.  \nWe hold the monthly two-party meetings via videoconference.  We increased the frequency of \nour meetings with the Department, adding a mid-week telephone update every week, in \naddition to our weekly Friday meetings with Department leadership.  Though certain strategies \nand initiatives had to pause or change approaches, our primary goal has been to ensure \nmonitoring for the most acutely-ill defendants, and facilitating a rapid response for them.   \n \nLooking Forward: \nAs Colorado has eased some of the public safety restrictions that attempted to slow the spread \nof COVID-19, some of the factors that have caused delays may be changing.  For example, some \njails may resume allowing face-to-face visits from evaluators (with proper safety precautions).  \nOn the other hand, certain procedures will remain as the “new normal.”  For example, CMHIP \nwill likely need to continue hospital admissions on a 14-day cohort basis to limit the impact of \nany infection among newly admitted patients, and this process may remain necessary for the \nforeseeable future.   \n \nOther challenges are clearly on the horizon: as courts resume more regular operations the \nvolume of competency evaluation and restoration orders will substantially increase.  \nFurthermore, some form of COVID-19 resurgence (a “second wave” or “second peak”) is likely, \naccording to many experts.  Thus, we urge the Department to prepare for the increased volume \nof orders for competency services, and the possibility of a COVID-19 resurgence.  For the latter, \nit may be easier to re-instate recently developed protocols than it was to create them the first \ntime, but proper contingency planning will be important regardless.   \n \n \nAs summarized above, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought broad and dramatic changes, but \nthe Department continues to pursue the goals prescribed in the Consent Decree.  As in every \nquarterly report, we review next the Department’s compliance with time frame requirements, \nbecause this is the primary focus of the Consent Decree (and the focus that the Consent Decree \nprescribes for our quarterly reports).  We consider these time frames our “key metrics” — or \nprimary markers of progress — that we review in each quarterly report.  Obviously, many of \nthese metrics have been directly influenced by COVID-19, and its consequent procedural \nchanges necessary for public safety.  We discuss each of these in their respective sections below.   \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 41\nPage 9 \n \n \nKEY METRICS FOR PROGRESS: COMPLIANCE WITH TIME FRAME REQUIREMENTS \n \nAs prescribed in the Consent Decree, a primary focus of these quarterly reports must be the \nDepartment’s compliance with time frame requirements: \n(i)  As part of the duties, the Special Master shall provide the Court and the Parties with status \nreports ... Such reports shall address the Department’s compliance with the timeframe \nrequirements of the Consent Decree concerning Competency Services and shall provide a \ndetailed summary of information and recommendations the Special Master believes the Court \nand Parties should consider relating to the Department’s compliance with the Consent Decree \ntimeframes concerning Competency Services. (Consent Decree p.24) \n(ii) The Special Master’s report shall include, but is not limited to, reporting on the number of \nPretrial Detainees ordered to receive Competency Services, an assessment of the \nDepartment’s operations, systems, and admissions practices and policies relating to the \nDepartment’s ability to comply with the Consent Decree timeframes, and guidance to the \nDepartment for improvement and increasing efficiencies in these areas.   \nTherefore, a primary focus of our review is the Department’s progress in meeting the time \nframes delineated in the Consent Decree.  This includes both time frames for competence \nevaluation and for competence restoration.  These will be the key metrics to gauge progress over \nthe next few years, so they are our starting point in the report, as well as a primary focus.  Of \ncourse, performance in meeting these time frames depends greatly on enacting the other steps \nprescribed in the Consent Decree, so subsequent sections of the report review those steps in \ngreater detail. \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 41\nPage 10 \n \nKEY METRIC:  COMPETENCE EVALUATION TIME FRAMES \n \nAs summarized in the table below, the Department has historically met evaluation time frames, \neven well before June 2019 and even through the first several months of the Consent Decree.  \nHowever, during the prior quarter (i.e., early 2019), the Department began failing to meet these \ntime frames for the first time in many months and they continued to struggle during this quarter.  \n \n \nAverage Wait Times for Competence Evaluation Services3 \n \n  Nov - Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  January 2020  July 2020 \n2019/20   2020   2020   2020  Requirement  Requirement \n             \nJail-based             \nCompetency  28.6*  28.9*  28.4*  24.9*  28 days  21 days \nEvaluations \n             \nInpatient             \nCompetency  12.6*  14.7  12.1*  20.2*  21 days  14 days \nEvaluations   \n \n* = at least one defendant waited longer than max time frame for the evaluation \n \nHistorically, timely competence evaluation was a relative strength of the Department.  Well \nbefore the recent Consent Decree, they followed the national trend of de-centralizing \nevaluations, moving them from solely an inpatient service to a localized service in the \ncommunity.  During 2018, their evaluations almost always met the prescribed time frames.  In \n2019, however, their performance deteriorated substantially.  Apparently due to insufficient \nplanning, recruitment, and hiring, the evaluator workforce was insufficient to meet the need for \ntimely evaluations.  This trend has continued into early 2020.  In February through April, 27% of \njail-based evaluations exceeded the 28-day time frame.  Also, inpatient evaluations have \nhistorically been completed well within maximum time frames, but in February through April, \n11% were late.   \n \nAs we described in our prior report, their delays in late 2019 and early 2020 reflect the \nconfluence of several factors.  Some involved a failure to develop an adequate workforce, and \nsome involved taking appropriate steps (which carried some short-term consequences) to \nimprove the workforce.  The Department has made changes to the leadership of Court Services \n(the unit responsible for evaluations) and, although belatedly, taken some significant steps to \nimprove the workforce.  Indeed, this quarter witnessed some substantial improvements (i.e., \n                                                        \n \n3 According to the Department’s Special Master Compliance Plan report April 2020 p.15 and p.23, \nsubmitted May 7, 2020.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 41\nPage 11 \n \nhiring new evaluators and contractors, increasing incentive pay) that we suspect would have \ndemonstrated much clearer progress in this key metric, were it not for some delays attributable \nto COVID-19 counterbalancing those improvements.  As detailed in later sections, we affirm \nmany of these steps, as well as the Department’s (specifically Court Services) efforts to continue \ntimely evaluations in light of COVID-19 challenges.  \n \nHistorically, the Department had performed well with respect to competence evaluation time \nframes, but the past two quarters witnessed substantial delays and noncompliance.  The original \ndelays were attributable to failures in planning and workforce development, but also some \noverdue workforce improvements.  This quarter has witnessed further substantial improvements \n(i.e., hiring new evaluators and leadership, incentive pay for conducting “overload” evaluations).  \nBut, at the same time, delays attributable to COVID-19 have slowed evaluations and prevented \nthe recent improvements from changing key metrics in ways we believe they otherwise would \nhave.  Further, the drop in the number of evaluations ordered by courts was substantial, and yet \nthe Department was still unable to complete timely evaluations in 27% of cases.  We affirm the \nDepartment’s recent success in recruiting new full-time and contracted evaluators to meet \nevaluation needs.  We also affirm their efforts to continue evaluations amid COVID-19 \nchallenges, and encourage continued, creative work to promptly complete these evaluations.  \nWe urge them to continue developing robust evaluation staffing and procedures in order to be \nready for the shortened timeframes that will take effect in July 2020. \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 41\nPage 12 \n \nKEY METRIC:  COMPETENCE RESTORATION TIME FRAMES \n \nThe Department has consistently failed to provide prompt restoration services; indeed, this was \na primary reason for the litigation leading to the Consent Decree.  In the months preceding the \nTriage system, defendants who were admitted for inpatient restoration treatment at CMHIP or \nRISE waited, on average, 71 days.4  Of course, this figure included all defendants referred for \nrestoration, without distinction between those with more, versus less, acute needs.  Since then, \nthe Department launched on June 1, 2019 the Consent-Decree-mandated triage system,5 \ndesigned to prioritize the defendants with the most acute clinical needs (“Tier 1”) over those \nwith less acute clinical needs (“Tier 2”).  Currently, Tier 1 defendants must receive services within \n7 days of the competency hearing, whereas Tier 2 defendants need not receive services for 49 \ndays (per the January 2020 change in timeframe requirements).   \n \nOverall, the Department continues excellent adherence to the 7-day deadline for defendants \ndesignated as Tier 1.  The wait times for Tier 2 defendants still exceed the time frames \nprescribed in the Consent Decree (i.e., average wait times exceeding 72 days this quarter, well \nbeyond the required 49 days), though recent data show improvements over prior quarters.  \nWhereas April reveals longer waits than March (due to impact the COVID-19), this COVID-\ninfluenced figure is better than prior quarters. \n \n \nAverage Wait Times for Inpatient Competence Restoration Services6 \n \n  Nov – Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  January 2020  July 2020 \n2019/20  2020  2020   2020  Requirement  Requirement \n             \nTier 1  2.47  1.6  3.6*  10.3*  7 days  7 days \n             \nTier 2  97.87**  80.2**  63.8**  72.0**  49 days  42 days \n \n* = at least one defendant waited longer than maximum time frame for restoration services \n** = most defendants waited longer than maximum time frame for restoration services \n \nAs in prior reports, each of these summary statistics requires clarification.  First, the figures for \nTier 1 defendants reflect only Tier 1 defendants as defined in the Consent Decree; that is, \ndefendants whom the court has designated as Tier 1 and ordered to the hospital.  \n                                                        \n \n4 Average waiting period November 2018 - April 2019, as calculated from data provided by the \nDepartment (see p.7 of their Monthly report filed May 7, 2019). \n \n5 See Consent Decree paragraph 43. \n \n6 Average wait times for Tier 2 defendants reflect a reasonable approximation of the average wait times; \nexact sample sizes were not used to calculate a precise average. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 41\nPage 13 \n \n \nTo date, the Department reports that a total of 164 individuals have been opined as Tier 1 by \nCourt Services Evaluators and admitted to CMHIP via the Consent Decree criteria.  Of these, 160 \nwere admitted within the 7-day maximum time frame.  This bodes well for the triage system.  \nThe vast majority of defendants whom evaluators designate as Tier 1 are admitted to the \nhospital promptly (i.e., well within seven days), and often even before the Court designates them \nas Tier 1 and orders admission.  For those that have not, CDHS has offered what appear to be \nplausible explanations.   \n \nRegarding Tier 2 defendants, progress has been much slower.  Average wait times still far exceed \nthe time limits in the Consent Decree, just as they did for all defendants in prior months.  Tier 2 \ndefendants have waited an average of 72 days between February and April 2020, exceeding the \nrequired 49-day limit.  Thus, the Tier 1 figures suggest that the Triage System serves the purpose \nfor which it was designed: prioritizing the most acutely ill defendants and moving them into the \nhospital rapidly.  However, the Tier 2 figures reveal that CDHS continues to struggle with some of \nthe primary challenges that prompted the Consent Decree: responding to the volume of \ndefendants referred for inpatient restoration, and admitting them into the hospital within a \nreasonable time frame.  Fortunately, we see improvements in the Tier 2 metric over prior \nmonths, even with some delays attributable to COVID-19. \n \nOverall, Tier 1 admissions occur on time.  Tier 2 admissions still far exceed maximum admission \ntime frames, though the past quarters have witnessed some small-but-meaningful improvement.  \nThe most recent months revealed further improvements (i.e., they exceed the wait times, but to \na lesser degree), even amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  Future months will reveal if these \nimprovements reflect sustained progress, or if they are more attributable to COVID-related \ndecreases in new persons placed on the waitlist.     \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 41\nPage 14 \n \nKEY METRIC:  THE WAITLIST FOR COMPETENCE RESTORATION SERVICES \n \nBeyond the wait times for restoration services (and progress towards the time frame \nrequirements of the Consent Decree), another key metric for gauging the Department’s progress \nis the wait list for competence restoration services.  That is, the Consent Decree is designed to \nreduce wait times, but also reduce the number of defendants waiting.  In the months preceding \nlaunch of the Triage system, the waitlist averaged around 150 to 180 defendants.7  But again, \nwith the initiation of the Triage system on June 1, we must consider the waitlist according to Tier \nstatus.  Central to the Triage system is an acknowledgement that some incompetent defendants \nare so acutely ill that they require treatment almost immediately (Tier 1, who require treatment \nwithin 7 days), whereas others can safely await treatment (Tier 2, who can wait several weeks).   \n \n \nN  umber of Defendants on Waiting List for Inpatient Restoration8 \n   March 2019  Jan 2020  Feb 2020  Mar 2020  Apr 2020  \nCombined  157         \nTier 1  N/A  1  2  3  1 \nTier 2  N/A  112  115  124  110 \n \nOver the past quarters, the Department made meaningful progress in reducing the waitlist.  \nWaitlist figures far exceeded 150 in the Summer of 2019, and they decreased below 150 during \nthe Fall of 2019.  Although the number of individuals on the waitlist remains high in absolute \nterms (110 in April), this figure has decreased steadily over the past several months and is now \n71 on the date of this report (June 4), by far the lowest point in more than one year.  Generally, \nthe decrease cannot be explained solely by decreased referrals for evaluation or restoration \n(which vary substantially month-to-month), but rather appears attributable to Department \nefforts.  To be clear, the current low-point (71 on June 4) certainly does reflect the decreased \narrests and court orders for competency services in light of COVID-19 slowing the justice system.  \nIt remains unclear whether the waitlist will remain this low beyond the peak impacts of COVID-\n19, or whether the Department will experience rapidly increased orders for restoration \n(potentially prompting increases in the waitlist) as COVID-19 restrictions ease.   \n \n \n \n                                                        \n \n7 At present, the Department provides waitlist data as daily figures, so the monthly figures in the table \nreflect averaged daily figures.    \n \n8 According to the Department’s Special Master Compliance Plan report April 2020, submitted May 7, \n2020. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 41\nPage 15 \n \nOverall, there has been a meaningful decrease in the number of individuals on the waitlist for \nrestoration services over the past quarter.  Overall, this decrease is not simply due to a decrease \nin referrals.  Rather, much of the decrease appears genuinely attributable to Department \ninterventions.  The waitlist is currently at a historic low (i.e., below 80 defendants waiting, at the \ntime of this report), though it may increase again depending on the ways in which courts \nrespond to easing COVID-19-related restrictions and delays.  \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 41\nPage 16 \n \nCONSENT DECREE SECTION VI UPDATES \n \nADMISSION OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES9 FOR INPATIENT COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS \nAND RESTORATION TREATMENT  \n \n33.

The Department shall Offer Admission to Pretrial Detainees to the Hospital for Inpatient \nRestoration Treatment or Inpatient Competency Evaluations pursuant to the attached table (Table 1).  \nCompliance with this measure shall be calculated based on the number of Days Waiting for each \nPretrial Detainee.   \nThe Consent Decree prescribes the following time frames for admitting defendants to inpatient \ncompetence restoration and for performing competence evaluations (whether inpatient or in \njail).10  Admission time frames shorten every six months, with the next reduction in July 2020.   \n \n \n  Tier 1: Maximum  Tier 2: Maximum  Maximum Time to  Maximum time to \nDeadlines  Time to Offer  Time to Offer  Offer Admission for  Complete Jail \nAdmission for  Admission for  Inpatient  Competency \nInpatient  Inpatient  Competency  Evaluations \nRestoration  Restoration  Evaluations \n         \nJune 1, 2019  7 days  56 days  21 days  28 days \n \nJanuary 1, 2020  7 days  49 days  21 days  28 days \n \nJuly 1, 2020  7 days  42 days  14 days  21 days \n \nJanuary 1, 2021  7 days  35 days  14 days  21 days \n \nJuly 1, 2021  7 days  28 days  14 days  21 days \n \n \nAs summarized earlier (“Key Metrics”), the Department meets the time frame for admitting Tier 1 \ndefendants to restoration and for evaluating defendants in inpatient settings.  But they far exceed \nthe time frames for Tier 2 admissions to competency restoration.  Evaluations in jail, for the first \ntime in years, began exceeding the mandated time frames in early 2019.  Evaluations have \ncontinued to lag given COVID-19 delays, though recent improvements suggest they should soon \nreturn to schedule.  \n                                                        \n9 “Pretrial Detainee” means a person who is being held in the custody of a County Jail and whom a court \nhas ordered to undergo Competency Services.  Persons serving a sentence in the Department of \nCorrections and juveniles are excluded from this Consent Decree. \n \n10 Fine amounts are tied to delays beyond each of the time frames listed.  However, these fines are \ndiscussed elsewhere in this report. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 41\nPage 17 \n \nWait Times for Inpatient Evaluation \n \nAs detailed below, the Department has been quite successful in timely admission for inpatient \ncompetence evaluations (versus restoration): \n \n \nRecent Wait Times for Inpatient Evaluation \n \nMonth  Number admitted to  Average days waited  People who waited more \nCHMIP for inpatient  prior to admission to  than 21 days  \nevaluation  CMHIP or RISE \n \nApr 2020  1  28*  1 \n       \nMar 2020  2  12.1*  1 \n \nFeb 2020  8  14.7  0 \n \nNov 2019 - Jan 2020  7.0  12.9  0 \naverage \n \nMarch 2019 total  18  16.4  1 \n \n* = at least one defendant waited longer than max time frame for inpatient evaluation services \n \nOver the past three months, an average of 3.7 people per month were admitted for an inpatient \nevaluation at CMHIP (compared to an average of 7 people for the previous quarter, and a 5.3 \naverage for the November 2019 – January 2020).  The average wait time for admission to CMHIP \nfor inpatient competency evaluation was 15.4 days (about 2 days longer than the average for the \nprevious quarter).  The Department remained in compliance with the 21-day maximum \ntimeframe for most defendants, although some defendants waited longer.  Unfortunately, it \nappears that the length of time to be admitted for inpatient evaluation increased during this past \nquarter, even though fewer individuals were referred.  This contradicts the trend of decreasing \nwait times for inpatient evaluations over the past several months.  As best we can tell, this \nrecent change results from delays in admissions (e.g., medical screenings and quarantine) due to \nthe effects of COVID-19.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 41\nPage 18 \n \nThe maximum admission timeframe will decrease to 14 days in July 2020, and the Department \nmay have difficulty meeting that standard in some cases.  While the average timeframe for \nadmission has decreased from historical averages, we believe that delays will continue to occur \nin some cases due to transportation problems, medical screening delays, and the potential \nincrease in numbers as courts seek to place defendants into inpatient care quickly (at least as the \nCOVID-19 pandemic persists).  We will monitor this closely. \n \nWe also continue to monitor the clinical appropriateness of those court-ordered admissions.  \nThat is, we track how many of the defendants ordered for inpatient evaluation actually met the \nstrict criteria for involuntary hospitalization (C.R.S. § 27-65-105).11  CDHS reported that during \nthe past 3 months, only 27.3% of admissions for inpatient evaluation met that strict “27-65” \ncriteria for involuntary hospitalization.12  This contrasts with a 71% rate during the most recent \nquarter.  In other words, the past year showed an increase in the percentage of defendants \nordered for inpatient evaluations who actually met civil commitment criteria (suggesting \nappropriate use of the inpatient mechanism), but this quarter showed a substantial decrease.  \nThe reason is unclear, but results solely from the month of February (in which only one of eight \nadmitted people met civil commitment criteria).  We will monitor this carefully over the next \nquarter to determine if February was an outlier from the previous 12 months, or if it indicates a \nburgeoning trend of “inappropriate” court-ordered referrals for admission (to the extent the \nlatter is true, we speculate that it may reflect judges’ efforts to ensure prompt admission during \nthe COVID crisis).  We believed that solid progress had been made in this area, but February’s \nnumbers provide a potential indicator of re-emerging challenges.  \n \nDuring the past quarter, wait times for inpatient evaluation admissions were longer than \nreported in previous months, even though the numbers of admissions decreased substantially.  \nThe proportion of persons meeting involuntary hospitalization criteria also decreased.  While \nCOVID-19 is likely to be a primary reason for this regress, we will monitor these trends and \nconsider potential interventions with CDHS and referral courts.                                                      \n                                                        \n \n11 C.R.S. § 27-65-105: (1)  Emergency procedure may be invoked under either one of the following two \nconditions: \n(a)(I)  When any person appears to have a mental health disorder and, as a result of such mental health \ndisorder, appears to be an imminent danger to others or to himself or herself or appears to be gravely \ndisabled, then an intervening professional, as specified in subsection (1)(a)(II) of this section, upon \nprobable cause and with such assistance as may be required, may take the person into custody, or cause \nthe person to be taken into custody, and placed in a facility designated or approved by the executive \ndirector for a seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation… \n(b)  Upon an affidavit sworn to or affirmed before a judge that relates sufficient facts to establish that a \nperson appears to have a mental health disorder and, as a result of the mental health disorder, appears \nto be an imminent danger to others or to himself or herself or appears to be gravely disabled, the court  \nmay order the person described in the affidavit to be taken into custody and placed in a facility \ndesignated or approved by the executive director for a seventy-two-hour treatment and evaluation.     \n \n12 From the May 7, 2020 CDHS Monthly Compliance Plan Report (p.18). \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 41\nPage 19 \n \nWait Times for Inpatient Restoration   \n \nCompared to the timely inpatient evaluations, there are far more concerns regarding inpatient \nrestoration at CMHIP.  Over the past few years, wait times consistently exceeded the 30-day time \nframes mandated by an earlier Settlement Agreement.  However, the required time frames \nchanged as of June 1, 2019, per the Consent Decree.  As of January 1, 2020, the Consent Decree \nreduced this maximum timeframe to 49 days.  The time frame for defendants with the most \nurgent clinical needs (those labeled Tier 1) remains at 7 days.   \n \n \nRecent Wait Times for Inpatient Restoration13 \n \nMonth  Number of people  Average days waited  People who waited more \nadmitted to CMHIP for  for admission to  than the max days for \ninpatient restoration  CMHIP inpatient  admission to CMHIP \nrestoration  inpatient restoration \n \n  Tier 1           Tier 2  Tier 1           Tier 2  Tier 1            Tier 2 \n       \nApr 20  3                 27  10.3               72.0  1             77 \n \nMar 20  16                 17  3.6               63.8  1            63 \n \nFeb 20  10                 24  1.6               80.2  0             46 \n \nPrevious Quarter  17.3              39.7  2.47             97.9  0             * \nMonthly Average \n(Nov 19 - Jan 20) \n \nMarch 19  44  58.2  31 \n(before tier \ndistinctions) \n       \n* CDHS did not provide sufficient data in their Nov 2019 – January 2020 monthly reports to allow for the \ncalculation of the number of Tier 2 individuals who waited more than the maximum allowable days for \nadmission to CMHIP for restoration.     \n \nAs the table reveals, most of the defendants designated as Tier 2 still wait much longer than the \nrequired 49 days before admission (though their wait times are decreasing).  More generally, this \nquarter is remarkable for the general decrease in inpatient restoration admissions compared to \nthe prior quarter.  March admissions (33) and April admissions (30) were substantially lower than \nthe average from the prior quarter (i.e., 57 in late 2019), a decrease that is almost certainly \nattributable to COVID-19.    \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 41\nPage 20 \n \nAs noted in our last quarterly report, the Department’s continued, rapid response to those \nidentified as Tier 1 is commendable.  In many ways, the Tier 1 individuals are the highest priority \nfor the Consent Decree and the CDHS competency system.  Those whom CDHS categorized as \nTier 1 — usually those who most need urgent treatment — continue to be admitted rapidly.   \n \nHowever, as previously reported, the progress towards meeting Tier 2 timelines remains slow.  \nTier 2 individuals are mandated to CMHIP less urgently, but still within certain time frames.  The \nDepartment reduced the number of persons on the waitlist and shortened their wait times, but \nneeds additional steps that create space for Tier 2 defendants.  The additional inpatient space at \nCMHIP has helped considerably, in that each of the new beds can accommodate several \ndefendants per year.  Increased hospital capacity is expected in late 2020 as the L2 unit opens \nwith 24 new beds.  Departmental models estimate that the waitlist may indeed be largely \nmanageable and in compliance before the end of 2020 (aside from COVID-19 related delays), but \nthe L2 unit should provide an extra measure of assurance for the reduction of the waitlist.  Still, \nwork is needed in terms of diversion and outpatient treatment to sustain these gains.  In short, \nwhile Tier 1 individuals must be prioritized for admission (thereby treating those who need it \nmost), successful compliance with the Consent Decree must also reduce Tier 2 time frames; such \ncompliance will demonstrate that the CDHS competency system has created adequate capacity \nfor all levels of competency-restoration needs.    \n \nEmerging Efforts: \nAs we reported in the prior quarter, CMHIP initiated a “Fast Track” project to accelerate \nthe scheduling of some competency restoration evaluations.  Although defendants are \ntypically evaluated at 90-day intervals, defendants do not naturally gain the capacities \nnecessary for competence at tidy 90-day intervals; many may be competent well before \n(or shortly after) these court-set dates.  Thus, the “Fast Track” effort seeks to identify \ndefendants who are stabilizing in advance of their previously-scheduled post-restoration \ncompetency evaluation.  In these cases, evaluators are notified to conduct the evaluation \nsoon, so that if the evaluator renders an opinion that the defendant has been restored, \nthe case can be returned to court in advance of their previously scheduled hearing \n(sometimes weeks to months in the future) and bed turnover can occur.  To date, the \nDepartment reports that 17 of 20 defendants referred to the “Fast Track” have been \nopined as competent sooner than their scheduled 90-day evaluation date, returning \nthem to jail sooner (to await their hearings) and thus sooner opening their hospital beds \nfor other restoration patients.  The has saved CMHIP a total of 135 bed days.  This type of \npractical intervention has become common in some other states, and is a simple yet \neffective strategy to reduce unnecessary length of stay.  \n   \n                                                        \n \n13 According to the Department’s Special Master Compliance Plan report April 2020 p.8-10 (submitted \nMay 7, 2020). \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 41\nPage 21 \n \nPERFORMANCE OF JAIL COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS \n \n33. (b) Performance of Jail Competency Evaluations.  The Department shall complete all Jail \nCompetency Evaluations of a Pretrial Detainee pursuant to the attached table (Table 1), after the \nDepartment’s receipt of a Court Order directing the evaluation and receipt of Collateral Materials.  \nThis timeframe requirement shall apply to the following counties: Adams, Alamosa, Arapahoe, \nBoulder, Broomfield, Crowley, Custer, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Elbert, Fremont, Huerfano, \nJefferson, Larimer, Mesa, Otero, Pueblo, Teller, and Weld.  Counties not specifically identified are \ncounties that use the “Hold and Wait” court ordered process.  Counties utilizing the Hold and Wait \nEvaluation process will be offered a meeting date within 30 days of the Department’s receipt of the \nCourt Order and Collateral Materials, and the evaluation will be completed within 30 days of the \nmeeting.  Beginning January 1, 2020, counties utilizing the Hold and Wait Evaluation process will be \noffered a meeting date within 30 days of the Department’s receipt of the Court Order and Collateral \nMaterials, and the evaluation will be completed within 14 days of the meeting.   \nThe mandated time limit for a jail-based evaluation is now 28 days, per the Consent Decree, and \nwill decrease to 21 days during the next quarter (i.e., July 1, 2020).  As mentioned earlier in this \nquarterly report (see Key Metrics: Competence Evaluation Time Frames) the Department has \nhistorically met this timeframe on a consistent basis, until around November 2019.   \n \nRecent Struggles: \nDespite the historic strengths of their evaluation services, around November 2019 it was \nbecoming clear that the Department’s workforce of evaluators was not sufficient to meet the \nvolume of referrals in a punctual manner.  Many jail-based evaluations then exceeded the 28-\nday time frame in December (37%) and January (46%), as we described in our prior quarterly \nreport.  Thus, the prior quarter witnessed a tremendous setback in services that had been a \nhistorical strength for the Department.  As we detailed in that report, we believe the failure \nresulted from a confluence of several factors.  First, leadership in Court Services had apparently \nfailed to anticipate workforce needs or prepare for some foreseeable changes in staffing (e.g., \nmaternity leave, evaluator departure).  Second, some of the factors contributing to those delays \nwere, in fact, quite positive in that they reflected long-overdue improvements to Court Services.  \nFor example, the Department stopped over-relying on a single contracted evaluator to perform a \ngrossly disproportionate share of evaluations    \n \nRecent Improvements: \nFortunately, during the past two quarters, the Department has taken significant steps to address \nthe workforce shortage that contributed to these evaluation delays.  The Department hired a \nnew Court Services Director, Amanda Edwards, who began working on April 13.  She has a strong \nbackground in the state court system and is well-suited for the organizational aspects of the job. \nThe Department has hired new evaluators — both full-time employees and contractors — so the \nevaluator workforce has grown substantially.  At the time of this report, Court Services has 36 \nfull-time evaluators and 29 contract evaluators.  The Department has also increased incentive \npay, such that full-time evaluators more often complete overload evaluations beyond their \nmonthly quotas.  In short, the workforce has increased in ways that should greatly reduce delays. \nIndeed, our estimates suggest that the size of this workforce should be ample to reduce the \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 41\nPage 22 \n \nbacklog of jail-based evaluations and even reduce the backlog in community-based evaluations \n(though we acknowledge the latter is not a focus of the Consent Decree). \n \nBeyond numbers, the quality and morale of the workforce has improved.  The clinical leadership \ntasks for Court Services now fall to a forensic psychologist.  Further, she is supported by a team \nof clinical supervisors, now organized as a “training faculty,” that makes much better use of in-\nhouse clinical expertise.  This training faculty provided a large-scale training on May 15 to all \nCourt Services evaluators (including those newly hired).  This primarily addressed the new \npolicies and procedures prompted by the Consent Decree and recent legislation (i.e., \nrequirements that evaluators provide an opinion on defendant triage and placement), so these \nprocedures are now much more solidified, such that evaluators better understand their new \nduties and can perform them in a more reliable manner.   \n \nRecent Status: \nDespite substantial improvements, the Department struggled this quarter with these jail-based \nevaluations.  Court orders for jail-based competency evaluations decreased dramatically after \nFebruary (117), into March (70) and April (61), as arrests and court proceedings slowed due to \nCOVID-19.  But it became quite difficult, in many jurisdictions, for evaluators to meet with \ndefendants, because most jails prohibited all visits.  The Department worked fairly rapidly to \ndevelop procedures for conducting evaluations via videoconference, and for conducting safer \nevaluations in person.  But adjusting to the COVID-19 safety precautions in jails nevertheless \nslowed evaluations for a period of time.  Indeed, a few jails still prohibit all visits and have not \nfacilitated evaluations via video-conference, creating unavoidable evaluation delays for \ndefendants in those jails (the Department will identify these cases as Individual Special \nCircumstances, per the Consent Decree).  Ultimately, the number of defendants awaiting a \ncompetency evaluation in jail (“the waitlist”) has continued to decrease.  But unfortunately, \nroughly one-fourth of the jail-based evaluations still exceed the required wait limits (i.e., 28%, \n26%, and 29% of defendants have waited longer than the required 28 days in the months of \nFebruary, March, and April, respectively). \n \nWe perceive that these continued delays reflect some lingering impact of the prior delays and \nbacklog (attributable largely to an insufficient workforce, which the Department could have \ncontrolled), and reflect some impact of recent COVID-19 challenges (which the Department \ncannot control).  We affirm the Department’s success in increasing their workforce and their \nrecent efforts to rapidly develop alternate approaches to jail-based evaluations (particularly via \nvideo-conference).  We anticipate that both of these will reduce delays in jail-based evaluations.  \nBut we also emphasize that the delays are not yet resolved, and the timelines will reduce further \n(in July 2020), requiring continued, vigorous approaches to timely evaluations.  \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 23 of 41\nPage 23 \n \nINTERIM JAIL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT14  \n \n34.  Interim Jail Mental Health Treatment.  If the court does not release the Pretrial Detainee to \nCommunity-Based Restoration Treatment and the Pretrial Detainee is awaiting receipt of Inpatient \nRestoration Treatment, the Department shall work with the County Jails to develop a program to \nassist in the provision of coordinated services for individuals in accordance with C.R.S.  §§ 27-60-\n105 et seq.  to screen, treat, assess, and monitor for triage purposes Pretrial Detainees in the least \nrestrictive setting possible.  This paragraph does not toll or otherwise modify the Department’s \nobligation to Offer Admission to the Pretrial Detainees for Inpatient Restoration Treatment.  Interim \nJail Mental Health Treatment shall not replace or be used as a substitute for Inpatient Restoration \nTreatment but does not preclude the Department from providing Restoration Treatment.  A member \nof the Forensic Support Team shall report to the Court Liaison every 10 days concerning the clinical \nstatus and progress towards competency of the Pretrial Detainee.   \nAs we have discussed in prior reports, the Department is required to partner with county jails to \ndevelop a program of coordinated services for individuals involved in competency matters.  \nThese services are currently managed statewide through the Jail-Based Behavioral Services \nprogram (JBBS) and are funded approximately $2.5 million per year by the recently appropriated \nby SB19-223.  Essentially, the Department utilizes JBBS as a hub for coordinating subcontracted \nservices across Colorado.  These subcontracted providers are now asked to provide adequate \nmental health services to inmates involved in competency matters.  Interim mental health \ntreatment is critical to screen, monitor, assess, and treat those receiving competency-related \nservices in county jails so that they remain physically safe and clinically stable until their transfer \nto competency restoration services.   \n \nOur previous quarterly reports have described the intermittent success that the Department has \nhad in securing and enhancing JBBS services in various county jails across the state.  They made \nprogress in most jurisdictions, though some jurisdictions were not receptive to additional \nfunding (usually because they were not receptive to the additional reporting requirements and \noversight).  All parties were aware of these challenges and planned additional steps, such as a \nnew data collection strategy and an audit of JBBS mental health services with support from DLC.  \n \nHowever, these plans were set aside amid the COVID-19 pandemic response during this past \nquarter.  No real progress was made on previous plans for data collection or the fines-supported \naudit.  Instead, interim jail mental health services were focused on mitigating the impact of \nCOVID-19 in local jails.  \n \nThe Department worked with jail mental health staff in a number of ways to manage the impact \nof COVID-19 during the past quarter.  Admissions to CMHIP slowed considerably as courts halted \n                                                        \n \n14 “Interim Jail Mental Health Treatment” means mental health treatment of a Pretrial Detainee that is \nperformed in the County Jail where the Pretrial Detainee is held while the Pretrial Detainee awaits \nCommunity-Based or Inpatient Restoration Treatment per Court Order consistent with the time frames in \nthe Consent Decree.  It is NOT a proxy or substitute for competency restoration services.   \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 24 of 41\nPage 24 \n \nmany competency-related hearings and as transportation of defendants became increasingly \ndifficult.  In addition, enhanced medical screenings became necessary to avoid bringing persons \ninfected with the virus to CMHIP; however, many incompetent defendants refused the \nscreenings due to their symptoms of acute mental illness (e.g., paranoia).  Additionally, capacity \nfor new admissions became increasingly difficult because discharges were often untenable when \nlocal jails refused return admissions.  All in all, many people on the waitlist remained in local jails \nas options for admission decreased amid the many consequences of COVID-19.  Of course, this \nincreased the strain on JBBS services, especially as face-to-face patient access for JBBS mental \nhealth providers diminished as the pandemic response intensified.  \n \nThe Department responded to this challenge in several ways.  First, the Forensic Support Team \n(FST) navigators continued to meet and communicate with pretrial detainees and their multi-\ndisciplinary teams throughout the pandemic crisis.  Eventually, communication was limited to \nphone and video-conferencing.  However, throughout the crisis, the available evidence \nsuggested that the FST was identifying persons in most acute need and working with CMHIP and \nJBBS to enhance mental health services and facilitate discharges to hospitals when necessary.  \nThe true impact of COVID-19 on pretrial detainees will not be known until regular face-to-face \naccess resumes, but we are tentatively satisfied that crises were identified and mitigated even in \nthe midst of the COVID-related restrictions.  \n \nSecond, CMHIP created a consultation team to work with JBBS staff in managing acute crises and \nfacilitating discharges when possible.  This included extending involuntary medication order \nauthority to CMHIP psychiatry in those cases where JBBS staff was unavailable to handle \ninvoluntary medications.  \n \nTo be sure, admissions and discharges slowed significantly during the height of the crisis (mid-\nMarch through early May).  However, with stronger safety protocols now in place throughout \nmany systems and locations, admissions and discharges are beginning to increase to pre-COVID \nlevels.  FST Navigators are still prevented from face-to-face access with pretrial detainees as of \nthis writing, but we predict they will resume face-to-face access within the coming next few \nweeks (barring an increase in COVID-19 infections).  Access will likely be determined on a jail-by-\njail basis.  Nonetheless, we believe that JBBS services will begin to slowly return to pre-COVID \nlevels, such that more and more treatment options and individual contacts will resume over \ntime.  In short, although the impact of COVID-19 on JBBS services was substantial, it appears that \nfor the most part that the Department worked effectively with JBBS providers to address the \nmost critical and acute needs while preventing the most serious types of mental health \ntragedies.  Still, the impact of COVID-19, and true ability of the Department and JBBS to mitigate \nits impacts, will not be entirely clear until access to jails resumes and patient care returns to pre-\nCOVID levels. \n \nEfforts to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 from CMHIP \nBeyond CMHIP’s work with jails, the Department has taken substantial steps to mitigate the \nspread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  First, CMHIP and CMHIFL implemented strict \nprecautions to prevent and mitigate the spread of the virus; CMHIP was especially vigilant given \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 25 of 41\nPage 25 \n \nthe historically high volume of traffic from daily admissions and discharges.  Specifically, we \naffirm Jill Marshall’s successful efforts to mitigate COVID-19 at CMHIP.  Many other forensic \nhospitals around the country were not so successful.  \n \nIn addition, the Department repurposed units and buildings at CMHIP to allow for the quarantine \nof new admissions.  This mitigated potential spread of COVID-19 for new admissions.  Admissions \noccurred via weekly cohorts of new patients; eventually as the virus became more manageable, \ncohorts were brought in more frequently.  This innovative and flexible approach allowed for the \nadmission of the sickest individuals without compromising the safety of the hospital population; \nwe again affirm these impressive efforts.   \n \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 26 of 41\nPage 26 \n \nRELEASE OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RESTORATION \nTREATMENT15 \n \n35. Release of Pretrial Detainees for Community-Based Restoration Treatment.  If the court releases \nthe Pretrial Detainee on bond to commence Community-Based Restoration Treatment, the \nDepartment shall coordinate with the Court Liaison to develop a discharge plan (in a format approved \nby the Special Master) within seven days of the order to all parties involved in the Community-Based \nServices Recipient’s case, and the Court Liaison and community-based provider.   \nThe Department has made further progress on the requirement to develop discharge plans for \npersons identified as appropriate for Outpatient Competence Restoration programming (OCRP), \neven in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Of course, priorities shifted during this last \nquarter, and discharges from CMHIP and jails were greatly reduced as movement across the \nsystem slowed to a halt.  However, work continued in four main areas: \n \n1.  Transition efforts at CMHIP:  CMHIP continued to target Restoration Housing (formerly \nlabeled Fusion Studios) and the “fast-track” program as primary outlets for some \npatients.  In short, while still unrestored, these patients have shown clinical \nimprovements and minimal public safety concerns, making them appropriate for \ntransition from CMHIP to Outpatient Competence Restoration programming (OCRP).  \nAfter a slow start, referrals and placements at Restoration Housing are increasing.  At the \ntime of this writing, the Forensic Support Team (FST) has coordinated 69 completed \nreferrals for Restoration Housing, and 15 individuals have been placed there.  A total of \n13 slots still remain; FST is optimistic that those beds will be filled within the next several \nweeks.  Although fiscal agreements were reached in December, the opening of the \nhousing placement was not fully executed until early March — hence the delay in filling \nthose slots.  \n \n2.  Impact of the Forensic Support Team (FST):  The FST team has historically focused on \naddressing cases involving incompetent defendants either in jails or in CMHIP.  FST \nNavigators have monitored clinical status and restoration progress for those in jails \nawaiting transfer to CMHIP — primarily defendants who have been categorized as Tier 2.  \nNavigators have also worked with CMHIP to begin facilitating transfer of incompetent \ndefendants to OCRP.  Navigators have also been effective in securing emergency holds, \nemergency transfers, and engaging in other crisis responses for a handful of cases.  We \naffirm this important work.  Since January, the FST has logged more than 7800 contacts, \ncoordinated 153 referrals to outpatient settings, and intervened in 144 crisis situations, \naccording to FST records.  They are currently assigned to 128 individuals in jails across \n                                                        \n \n15 “Community-Based Restoration Treatment” means Restoration Treatment of a Community-Based \nRecipient that is ordered to be performed out of custody and in conjunction with a community-based \nmental health center or community organization. \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 27 of 41\nPage 27 \n \nColorado, and monitor 368 additional clients in hospitals and community settings around \nthe state.   \n \nHowever, COVID-19 changed the work of the FST Navigators in stark ways.  County jails \neventually stopped allowing Navigators to enter their facilities, making face-to-face visits \nimpossible.  Navigators were forced to rely upon telephone and video-conferencing to \ncheck in with the Pretrial Detainees and their multi-disciplinary teams at those jails.  Of \ncourse, this limited the quality of available information in many cases.   \n \nWe affirm the FST in finding alternative ways to communicate critical information.  In \nmany ways, the FST became the primary “eyes and ears” of the Department for Pretrial \nDetainees who would have otherwise had little to no contact with the outside world amid \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.  The work of the Navigators shifted to primarily crisis work: \nidentifying and mitigating the most acute mental health crises.  In April 2020 alone, the \nFST reported coordinating care for 146 clients in jails across Colorado.  They reported 72 \ndirect contacts with Pretrial Detainees by telephone, and an additional 1,136 collateral \ncontacts with their jail-based treatment teams.  Further, FST Navigators coordinated \ncrisis responses and/or transfers to CMHIP for 24 defendants in April.  Essentially, the FST \nbecame the primary source of information and intervention with these detainees, and we \nbelieve they were responsible for identifying and mitigating the most acute mental health \ncrises faced by Pretrial Detainees statewide.  The FST Director reports this important \nwork was possible due to building trusted relationships among FST Navigators and other \nstakeholders (Bridges Liaisons, jail mental health staff, CMHIP personnel) during the past \nsix months, and we affirm the positive outcomes these relationships yielded.  \n \nFST’s work was not limited to crisis mitigation for Pretrial Detainees.  In addition, \nNavigators worked to facilitate transfers and placements to various settings affiliated \nwith OBH’s outpatient competency restoration program (OCRP).  Although we maintain \nthat the FST would ideally include some Navigators placed in the community (to provide \nsupport and crisis management for persons in the OCRP), we understand that the priority \nfor the entire team must currently be working with Pretrial Detainees in local county \njails.16  In response to our repeated calls for more community support for OCRP \nparticipants, the Department has coordinated crisis and case management services with \nthe State of Colorado’s Transition Specialist Program and the “Momentum” Program.  To \ndate, FST has referred a total of 62 persons to the Momentum Program.  Referrals are \n                                                        \n \n16 While we understand the realities of Navigator capacity, we maintain that Navigators should be the \nDepartment’s “face” of restoration in the community — visible experts in the restoration system who \nserve as the OBH point of contact whenever needs are identified.  By serving as the Department’s \nrestoration experts in the community, Navigators increase restoration success, troubleshoot problems, \naddress crisis situations, enhance community tenure, and help skeptical judges trust the Department’s \noutpatient restoration services.  We will advocate for this change further as the waitlist decreases and the \nrelative demand for services shifts from jails to communities.   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 28 of 41\nPage 28 \n \nabout evenly split between defendants in jail and defendants at CMHIP who are ready for \ncommunity transition to OCRP.  Only twelve people have been accepted and assigned to \nthe program so far; the others are in some stage of review.   \n \nAs mentioned previously, FST Navigators also coordinated the transition of 18 Pretrial \nDetainees into Restoration Housing.  In addition, the FST is working with a local Colorado \nveteran’s program to secure additional releases and community supports for veteran \nPretrial Detainees, and work continues in transitioning appropriate Denver Pretrial \nDetainees to the Community-Based Enhanced Restoration program (to be discussed \nbelow).  The FST reports that these combined efforts have resulted in “saving” 1097 jail \nbed days since January 1, 2020.  This is a remarkable change as compared to the time \nbefore the implementation of the Consent Decree, and we affirm those efforts.  \nHowever, to our knowledge no Tier 2 individuals have actually been moved from Tier 2 to \nthe community.  This was an important role envisioned by the Consent Decree; we look \nforward to seeing those transfers beginning within the next quarter.  \n \nA significant improvement this quarter involves the FST’s data collection and \ndissemination capabilities.  Data is reported monthly across a number of metrics: in-\nperson contacts, multi-disciplinary contacts, housing and other outpatient referrals \n(including the stages for each referral), and the number of jail bed days “saved” through \nearly discharge.  We are encouraged by this data collection, analysis, and dissemination.   \n \nFinally, the Parties agreed to the FST policy and protocol document that oversees the \nfrequency of contact expected by FST Navigators.  In general, the schedule (pre-COVID) is \nto see Detainees in person every other week, with alternating weeks requiring a remote \ncheck-in with the jail mental health staff.  Certain conditions will increase the frequency \nto weekly in-person contact (i.e., situations that could put the Detainee in more acute \ncrisis).  We are encouraged by the development of this document and the collaborative \nspirit between the Parties in revising and ultimately adopting it.17  \n \n3.  Coordination with the Bridges program:  As mentioned in previous quarterly reports, the \nBridges Program and FST must work together to facilitate discharge and share \nresponsibilities for competency-related cases.  They both rely on similar (partially, but not \nentirely, overlapping) bodies of information.  Thus, the Department and the Bridges team \nhave been actively working to coordinate services, so that they can ultimately collaborate \nin a way that minimizes redundancies and gaps.   \n \nThe primary development was the adoption of the long-awaited signed Memorandum of \nAgreement (MoA) between the two agencies; it allows for data and information sharing \nto occur between FST Navigators and Bridges Liaisons.  The MoA has already improved \n                                                        \n \n17 Of course, COVID-19 prevented the FST Navigators from performing in-person visits in March.  Those \nvisits are just now resuming at the time of this writing.  \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 29 of 41\nPage 29 \n \nthe ability of both agencies to facilitate discharges and/or transitions of Tier 2 individuals \nout of jails and into community placements when appropriate, as well as to coordinate \ncourt hearings and “behind-the-scenes” linkages that are critical to moving defendants \nmore nimbly to appropriate options for care and service.  We are also encouraged by the \nincreased trust and accountability between FST and Bridges.  In reviewing the six-month \nanniversary of the launch of the FST, it is clear that both programs have clarified their \nunique roles, shared expectations, communication, and collaboration.  \n \nStill, the FST Director reports that because liaisons are most often not assigned to \nincompetent defendants, expediating discharges and holding necessary court hearings is \noften difficult.  So although the two programs appear to have made progress in sharing \ninformation and understanding roles and expectations of each other, the lack of Bridges \nliaisons assigned to incompetent defendants has caused a barrier in transitioning Tier 2 \nindividuals to the community.  The FST reports that liaisons are assigned to 35% more \ncompetency-related cases since January 1 as a result of this coordination and referral \nsystem, but many defendants remain without an assigned liaison.  Budget cuts to the \nBridges program seem inevitable in this legislative session, which will only exacerbate \nthese gaps.   \n \n4.  CBER (Community-Based Enhanced Restoration):  The CBER program is a pilot program \nbased in Denver that provides enhanced mental health and case management services to \na community-based restoration program.  OBH is funding the program and has \ncontracted Mental Health Center of Denver to provide the wraparound and restoration \nservices.  Participants are drawn from metro-area county jails; Tier 2 individuals are \ntargeted for inclusion.  To date, ten individuals have been placed into the program, with \nmore individuals identified as clinically eligible and legally suitable.  OBH administrators \nhave dedicated enough funding for a total of 30 participants at any one time.  COVID-19 \nslowed referrals to the program, but we have urged OBH to address the low numbers of \nparticipants in the program.  While we value the good attempts at filling the available \nslots, if the program is not close to capacity by the time the current contract ends in \nNovember 2020, we may encourage the Department to reallocate funds to other \npopulations.  \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 30 of 41\nPage 30 \n \nTRANSPORTATION OF PRETRIAL DETAINEES  \n \n36. Transportation of Pretrial Detainees.  If a Pretrial Detainee is transported to the Hospital for an \nInpatient Competency Evaluation and the Department or a medical professional opines that the \nPretrial Detainee is incompetent and the provisions of C.R.S.  § 27-65-125 have been met, the \nDepartment shall not transport the Pretrial Detainee back to his/her originating jail.   \nOver the past quarter, a total of 11 defendants were admitted to CMHIP for an inpatient \ncompetency evaluation, of whom 3 met C.R.S. § 27-65-125 criteria, according to hospital staff.18  \nNone of these defendants who met civil commitment criteria were returned to a local jail.19   \n   \nAs mentioned in previous quarterly reports, SB19-223 included language that allows CMHIP to \nkeep defendants ordered for inpatient evaluation at CMHIP from the time that the evaluator \nopines them incompetent to proceed (rather than requiring C.R.S. § 27-65-125 criteria be met, \nor that the originating court adjudicates the defendant as incompetent).  This is now found in \nC.R.S. § 16-8.5-105 (IV-b-5) and reads as follows:  \n \nWhen the court orders an inpatient evaluation, the court shall advise the defendant that \nrestoration services may commence immediately if the evaluation concludes that the \ndefendant is incompetent to proceed, unless either party objects at the time of the \nadvisement, or within 72 hours after the receipt of the written evaluation submitted to the \ncourt. \n \nPolicies and procedures governing the decision-making in these circumstances are still in \ndevelopment.  At times, CMHIP may need to balance these incompetent individuals already in \nthe hospital and in need of hospital-level care with those Tier 1 or Tier 2 defendants in county \njails approaching their deadlines for admission.  To date, decisions among these individuals have \nbeen made primarily on clinical grounds, but we also understand the need to admit individuals \nwho have been waiting in county jails for extended periods of time.  Discussions between OBH \nand DLC have been amiable and productive in these challenging situations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \n \n18 According to the April Special Master Compliance Report (p.28), submitted by CDHS on May 7, 2020.   \n \n19 According to the April Special Master Compliance Report (p.28), submitted by CDHS on May 7, 2020.  \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 31 of 41\nPage 31 \n \nNOTIFICATION OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH TIME FRAMES  \n \n38. Notification of Non-Compliance with Timeframes.  The Department shall notify the Special \nMaster and DLC weekly regarding any non-compliance with timeframes.   \n(a) Only one notice per Pretrial Detainee shall be provided and should include: (i) The name of the \nPretrial Detainee; (ii)  The Pretrial Detainee’s location; (iii)  The Pretrial Detainee’s charges based on \ninformation available to the Department; (iv) The Pretrial Detainee’s bond amount based on \ninformation available to the Department; (v) Whether a forensic assessment has been made on \nwhether restoration in the community is appropriate; (vi) Whether the Pretrial Detainee has \npreviously been found incompetent; (vii) What efforts are being made to provide timely Competency \nServices to the Pretrial Detainee, including communications with the court, Court Liaisons, and \ncommunity mental health providers;  \n(b) The Department shall accompany its Monthly Data Report (see Paragraph 52) with a separate \n“Fines Report” which will include the names of the Pretrial Detainees for whom the Department has \naccrued a fine during the preceding month, the number of days each Pretrial Detainee waited in the \nCounty Jails past the timeframes for compliance, and the total fines owed by the Department for the \npreceding month.   \n(c) The Department shall pay the total fines owed on the date the Fines Report is submitted to the \nSpecial Master to be deposited in a trust account created for the purpose of funding non-Department \nmental health services.  The account will be managed by a court-appointed administrator.  Decisions \nconcerning payments out of the account will be made by a committee consisting of a representative \nfrom the Plaintiff, a representative from the Department, and the Special Master.  Any disputes \nregarding the fines shall be handled through the dispute resolution process identified in Paragraph 59.   \n \nThe Department has continued to provide reliable notification of non-compliance of time frames \non a weekly basis, as required by the Consent Decree (since June 1, 2019).  Likewise, the \nDepartment has completed a “Fines Report,” as prescribed by the Consent Decree.  Finally, as \nprescribed by the Consent Decree, the Department has been paying these fines into a trust \naccount (managed by Cordes & Company, LLP).   \n \nThe funds from these fines are already going to good use.  A small committee comprising \nDepartment administration (Werthwein, Shah), a representative from the Plaintiff (i.e., Disability \nLaw Colorado leader, Ivandick), and the Special Master, have all met regularly for the past year \nto address use of these fines.  The broad goal is to use the funds in ways that help those involved \nin the mental health and criminal justice systems (i.e., those who are, or are likely to become, \ninvolved in competency-related services), and to reduce Colorado’s “competency crisis,” by \nproviding new services or interventions that do not already fall within the Department’s \nresponsibilities.  In other words, funds from the fines should supplement and not replace existing \nservices.   \n \nAs previously reported, the first opportunity to use these funds for prompt services emerged \nwhen the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless (CCH) renovated a hotel to create Fusion Studios, \nwhich comprise 182 single-unit residences for homeless individuals.  In October 2019, the Fines \nCommittee contributed $3.5 million to the “Restoration Housing” project (within Fusion Studios), \nin exchange for 28 dedicated residences for competence-involved individuals whom the \nDepartment refers, over the next five years.  Currently, 18 of those units have been filled by \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 32 of 41\nPage 32 \n \npersons receiving competency services (the Department has made 69 referrals in total). The \nDepartment’s FST continues to identify and refer potential candidates for the Restoration \nHousing project.  Despite a slow start, we expect the Housing should be approaching capacity in \nthe near future (though COVID-19 has furthered delays). \n \nProgress was continuing on other fines-funded projects — a competency court, an audit of jail-\nbased behavioral services, a detailed data analysis of OBH competency services, improved OCRP \ncompetency curriculum, and a case manager for Restoration Housing — but the COVID-19 \npandemic decreased the prioritization of these projects in lieu of other more time-sensitive ones \nfocused on alleviating the impact of the pandemic on competency-involved individuals.  These \nprojects will likely resume once the effects of the pandemic decrease.  We remain most keenly \ninterested in the competency court project; focused stakeholder meetings had occurred in \nFebruary and March to begin early visioning and planning for the competency court, but upon \nthe start of the COVID-19 pandemic, all involved judges decided to pause their efforts.  \n \nHowever, other projects have been approved for funding by the Fines Committee. These include: \n \n•  CREST program (COVID-19 Response Services Taskforce): This project provides $1.5 \nmillion dollars to the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless to provide emergency and \ninterim housing for 25 incarcerated individuals in the competency system.  Housing will \nbe provided for up to two years, and assertive case management and other services will \nbe afforded to participants.  A CREST advocate position will also be created to advocate \nfor the release of these individuals at court and to monitor their progress in both \ntransition and in the community.  This position will likely be based in Mental Health \nColorado.  The project is slated to start as soon as the Advocate position is hired; \ntentatively we project an early July start for the program.  \n \n•  Private hospital contracts: A total of $830,000 will add 21 beds at two local private \nhospitals for competency-involved individuals in need of emergency services.  These will \nbe short-term beds.  As discussed earlier, CMHIP operates on a cohort-based admissions \nsystem due to the pandemic, and this funding will allow for more flexibility for people \nwho need urgent, inpatient mental health care.  \n \n•  Technology for ITP defendants: Cell phones and other required devices will be provided \nto persons in need of competency evaluations or restoration in the community.  To date, \nCOVID-19 has precluded in-person evaluations and restoration sessions, yet many \ndefendants do not have adequate access to video-enabled technology.  Therefore, \nparticipation from some defendants has been difficult, if not impossible.  A total of \n$24,500 will be used to purchase phones and 3-month service packages to allow these \nindividuals to more easily participate in evaluation and restoration services (thereby \navoiding further delays).  \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 33 of 41\nPage 33 \n \n•  Bridges Liaison program: As discussed earlier, the Bridges Liaison program will almost \ncertainly receive significant cuts to staff and services in the next fiscal year.  They have \nrequested consideration for fines-funding to supplement the expected budget shortfalls \nattributable to the effects of COVID.  These requests are preliminary and informal at this \ntime, and certain provisions may preclude fines money from being used in this manner.  \nHowever, given the mission of the Bridges Liaison program and their positive impact on \ncompetency-related individuals across Colorado, the Fines Committee will give due \nconsideration to any formal request from the Bridges program.  \n \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 34 of 41\nPage 34 \n \nCONSENT DECREE SECTION VII UPDATES \n \nCIVIL BED FREEZE \n \n39. Civil Bed Freeze.  The Department’s 2018 Plan included an effort to freeze civil admissions to its \nbeds to devote Hospital beds to perform Inpatient Restoration Treatment services.  On February 7, \n2019, the Department agreed to stop this practice.  The Department will continue to leave the state’s \ncivil and juvenile beds allocated as of the execution of this Consent Decree for civil and juvenile \npsychiatric admissions and will not freeze or convert those beds to provide competency services for \nPretrial Detainees, unless the Department receives prior agreement from the Special Master to use \nunutilized beds for such purposes.  This strategy to facilitate compliance with the Consent Decree \nshall only be re-implemented in the future upon agreement of the Special Master.   \nThe Department continues to report that they have removed the “civil bed freeze” as mandated \nby the Consent Decree.  That is, they have not re-purposed the civil beds at CMHIFL for \ncompetence restoration, as they had once proposed.  Per our request, the Department \ncontinues to provide a census report on the CMHIFL patients in their monthly report.  As of their \nmost recent report, the CMHIFL population included a total of 78 patients, 73 of whom were civil \npatients.   \n \nDuring monthly multi-party meetings, the Department has discussed any potential changes to \nthe use of any CMHIFL beds (e.g., allocating a few new beds at CMHIFL to accommodate \ninpatient competence evaluations — not restoration — which may reduce the need to transport \nDenver-area defendants to CMHIP for inpatient evaluation).  Generally, the Plaintiffs and Special \nMasters have agreed with the minor changes they have proposed, because these tend to reflect \nefficient steps that better serve the Departments’ consumers.    \n \nFor the foreseeable future, the Department will continue to wrestle with the reality that too few \ncivil beds exist in Colorado.  A potential, albeit indirect, benefit of the Consent Decree may be to \nincrease civil capacity through the reduced need for forensic beds; the Department will need to \ncontinue to monitor this trend and the outcomes of Consent Decree initiatives to determine the \nongoing and future needs for civil beds.   \n \nUnfortunately, the fiscal impact of COVID-19 may result in significant cuts to the Department’s \ncivil inpatient bed capacity. Though budget negotiations continue at the time of this writing, it \nappears that some CMHIFL civil units may be closed. This would reduce the already insufficient \ninpatient civil capacity (fewer than 100 beds for a state population of more than 6 million \npeople), which will likely indirectly lead to more forensic admissions.  As often happens, persons \nin need of hospitalization will come into contact with the court if civil capacity is insufficient.  We \nwill work with OBH to monitor this, and will work with both parties to mitigate and manage the \nimpact of reduced civil capacity should the proposed budget cuts materialize.    \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 35 of 41\nPage 35 \n \nCOMPREHENSIVE AND COHESIVE PLAN \n \n40. Comprehensive and Cohesive Plan.  The Special Master’s first recommendation was to revise the \nDepartment’s 2018 Plan into a more comprehensive and cohesive plan.  Dkt. 146.  By or about \nJanuary 2020, the Department will produce an initial plan resulting from a long-term visioning \nprocess with DLC, the Special Master, and stakeholders that will consolidate disparate pieces of the \nDepartment’s current plan, along with legislative initiatives, in a cohesive package for courts, \nadministrators, service providers, and legislators to consider.  As referenced in the Special Master’s \nRecommendation Number 7, the 2020 Plan will highlight the methods to prioritize quality amid \nquantity and time pressures.  Dkt. 146 at 42.  On an annual basis thereafter, the Department will \nreview and revise the plan as appropriate based upon data provided by the Department.   \nThe Department finalized a comprehensive, cohesive plan on February 27, 2020.  As we detailed \nin prior quarterly reports, the Department met routinely with stakeholders, and coordinated \ntheir work with the Governor’s Blueprint Task Force subcommittee that is addressing \ncompetence-related issues.  Crucially, the Department has conceptualized competency-related \nservices in a far broader way than they had in their December 2018 report. They detailed much \nof their progress to date, and remaining goals, all of which reflect a much more comprehensive, \nmulti-faceted approached to the competency crisis, as compared to their earlier efforts.  \n \nParties were progressing on legislation for the 2020 legislative session prior to the COVID-19 \npandemic outbreak.  The primary piece of legislation from CDHS proposed to lower some time \nframes regarding restoration evaluations, ultimately making it easier to find a defendant \npermanently incompetent to proceed (“unrestorable”).  We found this change to be minor but \nimportant, and we believed it would make the restoration process clearer and more efficient. \nThe legislation had support from a broad array of stakeholders.  Other draft legislation \n(increasing the pool of qualified evaluators, decreasing competency mandates for \nmisdemeanants, increasing OBH oversight over jail-based mental health services, among others) \nwas tabled for this session.  \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 36 of 41\nPage 36 \n \nINCREASE COMMUNITY RESTORATION SERVICES \n \n41. (a) Implement a coordinated wide-scale outpatient (community-based) competency restoration \n(OCR) system.  This system shall be integrated and submitted with the “Comprehensive and \nCohesive Plan” referenced in Paragraph 40 herein.  This plan shall be approved by the Special \nMaster.   \nAs reflected in past quarterly reports, the Department continues developing a wide-scale \noutpatient competence restoration treatment program (OCRP).  Their formal OCRP program \nbegan in March of 2018, and referrals for outpatient restoration ranged from 28 to 37 \ndefendants per month during the past quarter (a smaller range, and a smaller number, than the \nprior quarter).  A total of 433 individuals are currently participating in OCRP, and we are pleased \nto report there is no waitlist for OCRP services.  We commend the Department on its ability to \nbuild sufficient outpatient restoration capacity.  \n \nAt this point, OCRP has reached its two-year anniversary, and Colorado has one of only two \nstates offering state-wide OCRP services.  Almost all counties and community mental health \ncenters (CMHCs) across Colorado now offer some form of OCRP.  There are 54 contracts in place \naround the state.  Only one CMHC is refusing to offer OCRP in Colorado, and only two counties \nremain without viable OCRP options (Gilpin and Clear Creek counties; see graphic below, copied \nfrom the April 2020 Monthly Compliance Report): \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 37 of 41\nPage 37 \n \nThe Department continues to pursue contracts and services for those few areas in which services \nare not yet available.  Additionally, we recommend that OBH begin shifting focus to ensuring \nquality among their current providers.  As was mentioned in our previous quarterly report, this is \naccomplished by first developing and utilizing a robust data collection and analysis plan.  The \nDepartment to date has only released aggregate data covering July 2019 – May 2020.  \nUltimately, we would strongly prefer to receive outcomes and data in the Monthly Compliance \nReport as monthly data allows for more robust analysis and intervention.   \n \nStill, we appreciate receiving the aggregate data, and we are encouraged that the data shows \ngenerally encouraging outcomes.  Although restoration rates are low (28%), we believe that \nother data provides important and encouraging context for those restoration rates.  In addition \nto facilitating restoration, OCR also provides a release valve for stretched inpatient beds, lowers \ncosts, and enhances recovery and community linkages.  Speaking more broadly, if an \nincompetent defendant is diverted from inpatient restoration and maintains successful \ncommunity tenure, lower restoration rates may indeed be more palatable to the host of \nstakeholders involved (including public citizens).  In this spirit, we have included two categories \nreported to date (death and revocation / return to CMHIP) as “negative” outcomes.20  These two \ncategories account for 20% of all outcomes.  Alternatively, “positive” outcomes include being \nrestored, having the case dismissed (typically due to Jackson-determined timeframes), being \nfound unrestorable, and having services stopped for other mutually agreeable reasons; in the \naggregate data reported so far, these account for 80% of outcomes.  These initial outcomes are \npromising, though restoration rates are undeniably low.  We look forward to working with the \nDepartment to refine programming and service delivery to increase restoration rates.  \n \nSecondly, as mentioned in our previous quarterly report, we encourage the Department to \ndevelop specialized OCRP programs — “centers of restoration excellence.”  While there are \nsome commonalities across defendants, there are also distinct groups with similar barriers to \ncompetence.  Special populations (defendants with intellectual disabilities, traumatic brain \ninjuries or other cognitive disabilities, sexual offense charges, or juvenile defendants) have needs \nthat differentiate them from other groups.  Some providers may specialize in one or more of \nthese specialty areas (and some may be more or less skilled with certain groups of defendants), \nwhich would optimize restoration efforts in much the same way specialty courts address specific \nniches in criminal law.  Such specialized providers would also make referrals and communication \nmore efficient.  In the wake of COVID-19, such specialization of services understandably became \na lower priority.  However, we encourage the Department to revisit this as the impact of COVID-\n19 becomes more manageable.  \n \n                                                        \n20 These two components are not the only negative outcomes possible. Arrest rates, termination, absconding, and \nother outcomes could reasonable be considered as negative outcomes. However, the Department to date has not \nreported these outcomes.  We will continue to press for these variables (and potentially others) to be tracked and \nreported.  \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 38 of 41\nPage 38 \n \nAnother positive development this quarter involves the “Placement Committee,” a team of \nexpert advisors mandated by SB19-223.  This committee defined clinical criteria that Court \nServices evaluators will use to determine if an incompetent defendant merits inpatient or \ncommunity-based restoration treatment.  Beginning in July 2020, statute will require evaluators \nto offer these placement opinions.  The committee solicited input from Court Services evaluators \nand other experts from mental health, the judiciary, and other professions to develop placement \ncriteria and decision points.  Overall, the most encouraging outcome of the Placement \nCommittee was agreement that community-based restoration should be viewed as the default \noption for restoration.  Stakeholders, and the resultant placement policy, identified special \ncriteria and thresholds that would merit inpatient placement; however, defendants who do not \nmeet these criteria or thresholds will be recommended for outpatient restoration.  We affirm \nthe work of OBH’s Dr. Torres and Ms. Shah for their leadership in this committee, and final \nplacement policy.  We are also encouraged that the placement criteria were highlighted for \ndedicated training to all evaluators at the Court Services May 2020 evaluator training session.  \n \n 41. (b) The Department may utilize private hospital beds to meet the needs of Pretrial Detainees \nmeeting C.R.S. § 27-65-105(a) civil commitment criteria and with prioritization to Pretrial Detainees \nalready residing within the same geographic location.  The Department shall create a plan to \nimplement this subsection (b) to be approved by the Special Master.   \nThe Department has now contracted with local hospitals to provide 13 inpatient beds for short-\nterm competency-related services.  These beds are currently filled.  New contracts are being \ndeveloped with two metro-area hospitals (Peakview and Denver Health) for an additional 21 \nshort-term psychiatric beds.  These beds will be prioritized for competency-related services and \nfunded by Consent Decree fines.  All parties agreed to the increase in private hospital beds.  The \nDepartment has responded well to our January 2019 recommendation to assertively develop \ncommunity options rather than rely on simply procuring more inpatient beds.  Because of this \nprogress, the rise in privately-contracted beds seems appropriate (and can be an essential \nresource in some cases).  Private hospital beds may be an especially viable resource for female \nPretrial Detainees, because females tend to face longer waits for inpatient services at CMHIP.  In \naddition, if budget cuts to OBH include cutting civil units or capacity, these beds may become \nnecessary to manage the already-stretched inpatient civil capacity for the state.  \n \n41. (c) The Department currently estimates that 10-20% of Pretrial Detainees admitted for inpatient \nrestoration do not need hospital-level care.  Dkt. 146 at 29.  The Department will make best efforts to \nreduce inpatient restoration hospitalizations by 10% and increase community restorations by 10% in \nsix-month increments beginning June 1, 2019.  The baseline for the preceding sentence will be \ndetermined by the Special Master by June 1, 2019, utilizing data provided by the Department.  On \nJune 1, 2020, the Special Master will establish a modification of this guideline based upon a survey of \nthe data collection and implementation of the Department’s Plan. \nAs prescribed in the Consent Decree, we established a Baseline for improvement by calculating a \nsix-month period of available data (i.e., Nov 2018 - April 2019) prior to the June 1, 2019 deadline.  \nWe also recommended using proportional metrics when pursuing goals that are fundamentally \nproportional in nature (i.e., a 10% increase in community-based restoration and a 10% decrease \nin inpatient restoration).  In other words, while the Department may not have full control over \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 39 of 41\nPage 39 \n \nthe actual number of referrals, they have greater control over the proportion of referrals they \ndirect to outpatient versus inpatient restoration.  Therefore, we chose to set the baseline \nfigures, and establish subsequent performance goals, based on proportions instead of raw \nnumbers.  The following proportional goals were generated as a result of this approach: \n \n     \nInpatient Restorations  Outpatient Restorations \n \n     \nInitial baseline  Nov 2018 – April 2019: 69%  Nov 2018 – April 2019: 31% \n   \nDecember 1, 2019 goal  69% reduced by 10% = 62%  31% increased by 10% = 34% \n   \nDecember 1, 2019 numbers  June 1 – Dec 1, 2019 = 62%  June 1 – Dec 1, 2019 = 34% \n     \nJune 1, 2020 goal  62% reduced by 10% = 56%  34% increased by 10% = 37% \n     \nRecent progress (past 6 months)  Aug 1, 2019 – Feb 1, 2020: 66%  Aug 1, 2019 – Feb 1, 2020: 34% \n \nNote: All percentages rounded to nearest 1%. \n \nAlthough the Department met their goal to increase OCRP referrals by 10% in the six months \nafter May 2019, increasing the OCRP proportion from 31% to 34%, those gains have stagnated.    \nThe Department will almost certainly NOT meet the Consent Decree mandate of an additional \n10% shift in referrals between inpatient and outpatient restoration by June 1, 2020 (in which a \ntotal of 37% of all restoration orders should be referred to OCRP).  The Department’s past five \nmonths show a total of 32.1% of restoration orders being referred to OCRP.  \n \nFour of the most recent five months show OCRP referral rates of lower than 32%.  Due to these \nrecent dips in OCRP orders, we doubt that the Department will be able to attain compliance with \nParagraph 41 of the Consent Decree by increasing outpatient restoration to 37%, on average, for \nthe period spanning December 1, 2019 through June 1, 2020.  However, even with the recent \ndips, the 33% rate of adults ordered to OCRP during the past twelve months is higher than the \nrate in the six months surrounding implementation of the Consent Decree (28%).          \n \nWe continue to view the 37% aspirational goal as largely reasonable.  However, we believe the \ngoal is worth revisiting for two reasons.  First, as we discussed in our February 2020 report, it is \nmore important to maximize the number of appropriate referrals than it is to hit an artificially-\ndriven number.  In other words, we aim to place the maximum number of appropriate persons in \nOCRP, but are not wedded to a predetermined rate if it exceeds the actual number of \ndefendants appropriate for OCRP.  We have broached this subject with both parties, and both \nare amenable to a marginally smaller percentage goal if indeed all appropriate OCRP referrals \nare made.  We will continue to monitor the rate; we believe it can certainly increase with \ncontinued judicial education, coordination with the Bridges program, onboarding of new OCRP \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 40 of 41\nPage 40 \n \nproviders, and clearer guidelines for Court Services evaluators.   \n \nSecond, we have begun to realize a conceptual weakness in how both referral rates and the \nsubsequent aspirational goals are determined.  As it currently stands, the rates are calculated by \ndividing the number of OCRP referrals by the total number of persons ordered to restoration, \nregardless of where that evaluation occurred.  However, the resultant referral rate is likely \ncomposed largely of persons ordered to OCRP whose competency evaluations were completed \nwhile on bond.  In other words, persons ordered to OCRP are most likely pulled from the pool of \npersons already living in the community — not those in jails.  Likewise, these individuals are \ntypically not recommended for inpatient restoration.  In sum, the overall rate of OCRP \nrestoration referrals appears to include people who would likely never have been referred to the \nstate hospital in the first place.  Of course, this is not what this section of the Consent Decree \nwas meant to address.  We consider this an oversight in mediation, which failed to consider this \nnuance.     \n \nFortunately, the Consent Decree requires a modification of the base rates around June 1, 2020:  \n \n41. (c) The Department currently estimates that 10-20% of Pretrial Detainees admitted for inpatient \nrestoration do not need hospital-level care.  Dkt. 146 at 29.  The Department will make best efforts to \nreduce inpatient restoration hospitalizations by 10% and increase community restorations by 10% in \nsix-month increments beginning June 1, 2019.  The baseline for the preceding sentence will be \ndetermined by the Special Master by June 1, 2019, utilizing data provided by the Department.  On \nJune 1, 2020, the Special Master will establish a modification of this guideline based upon a survey of \nthe data collection and implementation of the Department’s Plan. \nWe have asked OBH to provide us with the numbers of persons found ITP in jails who are \nreferred to OCRP (i.e., excluding those referred to OCRP after on-bond evaluations).  We believe \nthis is the population that the Consent Decree was designed to address, and that a revision of \nthe calculation of OCRP referrals rates (and concordant calculation of inpatient referral rates) is \nlikely necessary.  All parties have agreed that, given the demands caused by the current \npandemic, these revised calculations can occur shortly after the June 1 prescribed deadlines.  \n \nFinally, we again reinforce the need for OBH to provide outcome data on OCRP.  We have \nreceived one basic report of OCRP outcomes to date.  While helpful, more regular reporting and \nmore sophisticated data analyses are critically needed.  We sent a request of OCRP data \nelements to OBH and discussed them in mid-February 2020.  COVID-19 pre-empted OBH’s ability \nto pull this data in the midst of other priorities.  However, as the impact of COVID-19 becomes \nmore manageable, we have again requested this data.  Although OBH has many concurrent data \nrequests, we continue to strongly request empirical outcome data for OCRP.   \n   \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 197   Filed 06/05/20   USDC Colorado   Page 41 of 41\nPage 41 \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nAs detailed throughout this report, we perceive the Department has made significant and \nmeaningful progress in enacting changes prescribed in the Consent Decree.  Indeed, several key \ninterventions prescribed by the Consent Decree (e.g., the triage system, the Forensic Support \nTeam) have become fully operational during this reporting period.  These have begun to \nsignificantly change the overall key metrics, in that the Department is generally responding \npromptly to those identified as Tier 1.  Put simply, the most acutely ill defendants — those \nwhose welfare was a primary focus in the current legislation and Consent Decree — do seem to \nbe receiving more prompt treatment upon launch of the Triage System.  Other improvements are \nalso clear, as the overall wait list has decreased meaningfully in the past quarter, and is lower \nthan at any point in recent history.  Amid the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the \nDepartment has generally responded rapidly and well, minimizing infections in their facilities, \nand seeking ways to provide care for defendants in jail. \n \nLooking forward, we anticipate continuing challenges attributable to COVID-19 (e.g., careful \ncohort admissions will need to continue at CMHIP), including the potential for a resurgence of \nCOVID-19 infections.  We also anticipate increased orders for competency-related services as \ncourts resume more normal operations, and as jail-based evaluations can increase.  Even facing \nthese challenges, it remains important for the Department to further accelerate inpatient \nrestoration treatment for Tier 2 defendants, and further the reductions to the waitlist.  We will \ncontinue to work with the Department on these and related matters, and we encourage you to \ncontact us with any questions or requests.  We appreciate the opportunity to serve the court, \nand the state of Colorado, in these important efforts. \n \n \nNeil Gowensmith, Ph.D. \nPresident, Groundswell Services Inc.   \n \n \n \nDaniel Murrie, Ph.D. \n \n \n ",

Dismissal of the Action; Court's Retention of Jurisdiction.  Within five days \nof the full execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall file in the Action the Joint Motion for \nDismissal and [Proposed] Order of Dismissal that are attached hereto as Appendix 1.  In filing \nthe Joint Motion and [Proposed] Order, it is the intention of the Parties that the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Colorado retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing the terms of this \nAgreement for the entire duration of this Agreement and for sixty days after the Hospital \nprovides the final monthly report. The Department will not raise the issue of standing in an \naction to enforce this agreement, but in doing so, does not waive this defense in any future or \nancillary actions. \n6.  Special Circumstances.  The Parties recognize that to some extent the \nDepartment's ability to perform its statutory obligations and its obligations under this Agreement \nis based on factors beyond its control.  The Parties agree that, subject to the terms and conditions \nof this Paragraph 6, the time frame requirements of Paragraph 2 of this Agreement may be \ntemporarily suspended. \n(a)  Special Circumstances. The Department may invoke, under this Paragraph 6, two \ncategories of Special Circumstances: \n(i)  \"Individual Special Circumstances\" means a situation that delays \nthe Offer of Admission to a Pretrial Detainee, where the circumstances are not within the control \nof the Department.  Historically, these situations have included requests by the court, County \nJail, defense counsel or CMHIP that admission be delayed because they are seeking an out \npatient arrangement or a more appropriate placement; additional information or testing required \nfor the evaluation is outstanding; the court has ordered a hold and wait evaluation and the sheriff \nmust transport the Pretrial Detainee to the nearest county where there are services available; or \nthe inmate is not Medically Cleared for admission due to illness or other non-psychiatric medical \nneed.  These examples are provided for illustration only.  Individual Special Circumstances is a \nflexible concept, due to the unique and often unforeseen nature of these events. \n(ii)  \"Departmental Special Circumstances,\" means circumstances \nbeyond the control of the Department which impact the Department's ability to comply with the \ntimeframes set forth in Paragraph 2.  This could mean an unanticipated spike in referrals, a \n-10-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 78-1   Filed 07/28/16   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 24\nnational or statewide disaster impacting admissions decisions system wide. These examples are \nprovided for illustration only.  Departmental Special Circumstances is a flexible concept, due to \nthe unique and often unforeseen nature of these events. \n(b)  Effect oflnvocation oflndividual Special Circumstances.  DLC will \nreview the reporting of Individual Special Circumstances. If DLC questions the Department's \ninvocation of Individual Special Circumstances, the Parties will confer to review the reasons for \ninvocation of Individual Special Circumstances and to determine issues for \nresolution.  Additionally, the Hospital may proactively seek confirmation that an event qualifies \nas an Individual Special Circumstance by contacting a representative of DLC in advance of \nformal reporting of the event.  Ifthe Department believes Individual Special Circumstances have \nbecome a systemic issue, it will follow the Departmental Special Circumstances procedure \nbelow.  The Parties shall use good faith efforts to try and resolve any disputes concerning the \ninvocation of Individual Special Circumstances.  However, if the Parties do not reach an \nagreement through good faith efforts at resolution, either party may seek judicial enforcement of \nthis Agreement. \n(i)  If the parties agree to the invocation of Individual Special \nCircumstances for a particular Pretrial Detainee, the timeframe requirements of Paragraph 2 shall \nbe suspended as to that individual Pretrial Detainee for a period of 60 days from the maximum \ntime frame for admission of that particular Pretrial Detainee, as defined in Paragraph 2. \n(ii)  The Hospital may invoke Individual Special Circumstances more \nthan once for the same Pretrial Detainee, but it must follow the notification and conferral \nprocedures in Paragraph 6(b) each time it seeks to invoke Individual Special Circumstances. \n(c)  Effect of Invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances. If the \nDepartment determines that Departmental Special Circumstances exist, it shall notify DLC \npursuant to theN otice provisions of Paragraph 20 of this Agreement, and in such notification, \nthe Department shall provide a detailed explanation of the basis for invoking Departmental \nSpecial Circumstances, a plan to remedy the Departmental Special Circumstance, and the \nprojected timeframe for resolution.  The period of Departmental Special Circumstances shall \ncommence on the date that the Notice of Departmental Special Circumstances is transmitted to \n-11-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 78-1   Filed 07/28/16   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 24\nDLC. Upon the invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances, the time frame requirements \nof Paragraph 2 shall be automatically suspended for six months, unless the Department notifies \nDLC that a shorter time period is sufficient to resolve Departmental Special Circumstances, \ncommencing with the month in which the Notice of Departmental Special Circumstances is \ntransmitted to DLC. The Department shall provide written notice to DLC of its intent to \nterminate Departmental Special Circumstances. Upon DLC's receipt of a Notice ofDepartmental \nSpecial Circumstances, it may request supporting documentation for the Department's Notice \nand the Parties shall confer to review the reasons for invocation of Departmental Special \nCircumstances, to resolve questions that the Consultant or DLC may have about the \ncircumstances that triggered the Notice, and to assess whether the parties are able to reach \nresolution of any disagreement concerning invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances. If \nDLC decides to challenge the invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances, it may do so \nby filing a motion to reopen the Action to seek enforcement of this Agreement.  The Department \nagrees that it will not oppose a motion to reopen the Action challenging the invocation of \nDepartmental Special Circumstances and DLC may designate any such motion as \"unopposed.\" \nThe Department, however, shall retain and may assert in the reopened action any and all \ndefenses to a claim that it has breached this Agreement. \n(d)  Effect on Reporting Requirements.  A Notice of Departmental Special \nCircumstances shall not affect the Department's reporting obligations under Paragraph 3 of this \nAgreement. \n7.  Independent Consultant. \n(a)  Selection of an Independent Consultant. The Parties shall appoint an \nIndependent Consultant who is knowledgeable in the management and oversight of programs \nserving individuals with mental illness.

The Parties will jointly select an Independent Consultant from the \nlist within seven days of receiving the list of qualified nominees. If the Parties are unable to \nreach agreement by that date, each party will nominate one person to serve as Consultant and \n-12-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 78-1   Filed 07/28/16   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 24\nJudge Boland (or Judge Boland's successor) will select the Consultant from those nominees. \nJudge Boland's decision shall be final. In the event the Independent Consultant resigns or \notherwise becomes unavailable, the process described above will be used to select a replacement. \nAfter appointment, the Parties may mutually agree to replace the Independent Consultant with \nanother individual through the process described above or by joint agreement. \n(b)  Duties and Reporting.

The Independent Consultant shall include its findings of each audit in its quarterly \nreports. All reports issued by the Independent Consultant shall be confidential, other than DLC's \nuse pursuant to their authority as PAlMI under 42 C.F.R. §§ 51.45- 51.46 .. \n-13-\n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 78-1   Filed 07/28/16   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 24\n(c)  Review and Evaluation of Data and Information.

The Consultant shall, within the year \n2016 upon reasonable notice, make an initial in-person visit to the Department's facilities related \nto the provision of competency evaluations and restorative treatment, to coincide with the 2016 \nquarterly meeting. The Consultant shall visit the facilities once a year thereafter, and shall \ncoincide those visits with a quarterly meeting as indicated in Section 3(d).

      "text": "Case 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 62   Filed 12/18/15   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 2\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \n \nCivil Action No. 11-cv-02285-NYW \nCENTER FOR LEGAL ADVOCACY, d/b/a DISABILITY LAW COLORADO, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nREGGIE BICHA, in his official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of \nHuman Services; and \nRONALD B. HALE, in his official capacity as Superintendent of the Colorado Mental Health \nInstitute at Pueblo, \n \n  Defendants. \n_____________________________________________________________________________ \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO REOPEN ACTION \nFOR ENFORCEMENT OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n______________________________________________________________________________ \nMagistrate Judge Nina Y. Wang \n  This matter is before the court on the Motion to Reopen Action for Enforcement of \nSettlement Agreement [#53, filed on November 18, 2015] pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), the \nOrder of Reference for all purposes dated February 21, 2012 [#44], and the Reassignment dated \nNovember  19,  2015  [#58].    The  court  has  reviewed  the  Parties’  briefing  [#57,  #59],  the \nSettlement Agreement [#53-1], the entire case file including the court’s Order of Dismissal \n[#52], and the applicable case law.  There is no dispute between the Parties that this court retains \njurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  [#57 at 7].  Nevertheless, Defendants contend \nthat this court should decline to re-open the case because they are not in violation of the \nSettlement Agreement or it should only be re-opened for the purposes of formal mediation.  \n[#57].  Respectfully, Defendants’ position puts the cart before the horse. \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 62   Filed 12/18/15   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 2\n  The only question that is ripe before the court on the Motion to Reopen is whether this \ncase should be re-opened to consider Plaintiff’s allegation that the Settlement Agreement has \nbeen breached.  In light of Defendants’ concession that errors in reporting did, in fact, occur \nrepeatedly [#57 at 11], and Plaintiff’s articulated concern regarding mentally-ill detainees, this \ncourt finds that it is appropriate for this case to the re-opened.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED \nthat: \n  (1)  The Motion to Reopen Action for Enforcement of Settlement Agreement [#53] is \nGRANTED, insofar as it seeks to reopen the case to allow the court to consider whether the \nSettlement Agreement has been breached and whether to order enforcement; and  \n  (2)  This matter is set for a Status Conference on December 29, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. to \ndiscuss Plaintiff’s request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing.  On or before December 27, \n2015, the Parties will meet and confer about and file a Joint Status Report addressing Plaintiff’s \nrequested discovery and a proposed scope and procedure for hearing. \n \nDATED:  December 18, 2015      BY THE COURT: \n \n              s/ Nina Y. Wang       \n              Nina Y. Wang \n              United States Magistrate Judge \n \n ",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No. 11-cv-02285-NYW \nCENTER FOR LEGAL ADVOCACY, d/b/a DISABILITY LAW COLORADO, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nREGGIE BICHA, in his official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado Department of \nHuman Services; and \nJILL MARSHALL, in her official capacity as Superintendent of the Colorado Mental Health \nInstitute at Pueblo, \n \n  Defendants. \n \nORDER APPOINTING SPECIAL MASTER \n \nMagistrate Judge Nina Y. Wang \n  This matter comes before the court on Plaintiff Center for Legal Advocacy d/b/a Disability \nLaw Colorado’s (“DLC” or “Plaintiff”) Motion for Appointment of Special Master (or “Motion”) \n[#117] and the Order on Motion for Appointment of Special Master [#123].  On December 18, \n2018, the undersigned granted the Plaintiff’s Motion for Appointment of Special Master and \nadvised the Parties that a separate, written Order appointing the Special Master would follow.  See \n[#123 at 4-5].  Having reviewed the affidavits of Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie and \nfinding no grounds for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455, the Parties’ submissions regarding \nthe duties of the Special Master, and the entire docket, and pursuant to the court’s authority under \nRule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court hereby APPOINTS Groundswell \nServices and its team of Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie as Special Master in this matter \nas set forth below.    \n   \n \n \n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSION OF LAW \nREGARDING THE NEED FOR A SPECIAL MASTER \n \nThe court hereby incorporates its factual findings and conclusions of law as reflected in its \nMemorandum Opinion and Order dated November 9, 2018.  [#113].  In particular, the court finds \nas follows: \n1.  Since  at  least  2007,  the  Colorado  Department  of  Human  Services  (“the \nDepartment”) and the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (“CMHIP”) have been subject \nto contempt citations issued in the Denver District Court relating to the extended period of wait \ntimes for pretrial detainees to access competency evaluations. \n2.  Those 2007 contempt citations were resolved through litigation involving a special \ncounsel appointed by Denver District Court Judge Egelhoff, and resulted in a settlement agreement \nthat required CMHIP to offer admission to pretrial detainees within 28 days of a court order \nrequiring in-patient competency evaluations or restorative treatment, and to maintain a quarterly \naverage of 24 days for both categories. \n3.  Sometime after the expiration of this first settlement agreement, the Department \nand CMHIP did not transport pretrial detainees to CMHIP for competency evaluation or restoration \ntreatment within 28 days after they were ready for admission, prompting this action. \n4.  Plaintiff alleged that Defendants failed to timely admit pretrial detainees in jails \nacross Colorado into CMHIP, the State’s only forensic mental health hospital charged with \nproviding court-ordered evaluations and accepting custody of pretrial detainees for restorative \ntreatment, for competency evaluations, and restorative treatment for those determined to be \nincompetent to stand trial.  [#1].  The complaint alleged this failure created unconstitutional delays \n2 \n \n\nto provide competency evaluations and treatment for up to 80 pretrial detainees for as long as six \nmonths.  [Id.]. \n5.  The Parties settled this action first in 2012, with an agreement (“2012 Agreement”) \nthat required the Department to: 1) complete outpatient (in-jail) competency evaluations; 2) offer \nadmission for inpatient competency evaluations; and 3) offer admission for inpatient restoration \nservices in a certain timeframe.  [#51-1; #105-15].  Under the 2012 Agreement, the Department \nwas required to complete all out-patient evaluations of a pretrial detainee no later than 30 days \nafter CMHIP’s receipt of a court order directing the evaluation and receipt of collateral materials.  \n[#51-1 at ¶ 2(b)].  The Department was also required to admit pretrial detainees to CMHIP no later \nthan 28 days after such detainee is ready for admission and maintain a monthly average of 24 days \nor less for admissions for restorative treatment and in-patient competency evaluations.  [Id. at ¶ \n2(a)]. \n6.  The 2012 Agreement included a provision called Special Circumstances, which \n“recognizes that to some extent the Department’s ability to perform its statutory obligations and \nits obligations under [the 2012 Agreement] is based on factors beyond the Department’s control.” \n7.  In August 2015, the Department invoked DSC. \n8.  In October 2015, the Plaintiff moved to reopen the matter for enforcement of the \n2012 agreement, in part because it disputed the invocation of DSC.  [#53]. \n9.  The Parties were able to resolve this 2015 dispute through an Amended and \nRestated Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement” or “2016 Agreement”) [#78-1].  The \n2016 Agreement was effective as of July 28, 2016.  [Id. at ¶ 9, 22-23].  \n10.  The term of the 2016 Agreement extended until July 31, 2021, unless modified by \nother provisions arising from the Department’s adherence or lack of adherence to the timeframes \n3 \n \n\nset forth in the 2016 Agreement.  [#78-1 at ¶ 4(a)].  The Parties agreed that the 2016 Agreement \nwould not be modified to terminate prior to January 1, 2019 – approximately 29 months after its \neffective date. \n11.  This Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the Settlement Agreement.  [#78 at \n¶¶ 3, 4; #105-16].  Under the 2016 Settlement Agreement, the Department is required to offer \nadmission to pretrial detainees to the hospital for restorative treatment or inpatient competency \nevaluations no later than 28 days after the pretrial detainee is ready for admission.    [#105-16 at \n¶ 2(a)].  The Department also must maintain a monthly average of 24 days or less for both types \nof offers of admission.  See [id.]. \n12.  The 2016 Agreement includes a provision called Special Circumstances, which \nrecognizes that “to some extent the Department’s ability to perform its statutory obligations and \nits obligations under [the Settlement Agreement] are based on factors beyond its control.” \n13.  In June and December 2017, the Department invoked DSC. [#105-2; #105-3].  The \nParties dispute whether these invocations of DSC are proper. \n14.  In June 2018, the Department did not invoke DSC.  \n15.  The Department has not complied with the Settlement Agreement timeframes \nconcerning inpatient restoration treatment since June 2017 and remains out of compliance. \n16.  The  Department  has  complied  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes \nconcerning outpatient competency evaluations since July 2015. \n17.  The  Department  has  complied  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes \nconcerning inpatient competency evaluations since May 2018. \n18.  Chart 1 details the timelines since June 2017 for restorative treatment at CMHIP or \na second facility in Arapahoe County, known as RISE, as calculated by the Department. \n4 \n \n\nChart 1 \n  Number of     \n     \nPretrial     \n \nDetainees on  Average  Longest Wait \nMonth \nReport A  Wait Time  Time \nWaiting 28+ \nDays \nJune 2017  3  23.5  29 \nJuly 2017  33  27.2  45 \nAugust 2017  73  39.5  56 \nSeptember 2017  90  46.7  68 \nOctober 2017  114  59.4  88 \nNovember 2017  133  67.2  87 \nDecember 2017  147  66.4  129 \nJanuary 2018  165  69.8  129 \nFebruary 2018  175  72.6  114 \nMarch 2018  203  93.6  133 \nApril 2018  195  82.4  136 \nMay 2018  200  91.7  144 \nJune 2018  189  94.6  144 \nJuly 2018  175  81.7  149 \nAugust 2018  170  81.1  149 \n[#105-9].  In each month from July 2017 through present, Defendants have failed to maintain a \n24-day monthly average for inpatient restorative treatment. \n19.  This court found Defendants in breach of the 2016 Agreement as of June 2018 when \nit did not invoke DSC but continued to fail to comply with the timeframe requirements for inpatient \nrestoration services.  As of August 2018, the average wait time for inpatient restoration services \nwas almost four times the amount of time contemplated by the 2016 Agreement. \n20.  On  December  17,  2018,  pursuant  to  court  order,  Defendants  submitted  a \n“Comprehensive Plan for Compliance,” [#122; #122-1; #122-2; #122-3] that was then subject to \nerrata filed on December 19, 2018.  [#128].  According to the Comprehensive Plan for Compliance, \nas of December 17, 2018, 69 pretrial detainees are waiting more than 28 days for inpatient \nrestoration services.  [#128 at 2].   \n5 \n \n\n21.  Defendants have represented that they believe in good faith that the Department \ncan resume compliance with the 2016 Agreement timeframes for inpatient competency restoration \nservices in May 2019.  [#122-1 at 30; #128, #128-1]. \n22.  Defendants further represent that a new unit of CMHIP with an additional 24 beds \nwill come online in August 2020, and needs no further funding.  [#122-1 at 31]. \n23.  Defendants also represent that they are attempting to increase further bed capacity, \nbut that those proposals require additional funding that has not been secured from the Colorado \nGeneral Assembly. \nAPPOINTMENT \nA.  Special Master Duties: \n1)  Review  the  Department’s  Plan  [#122-1;  #128]  to  increase  timeliness  of \nperformance of competency services, including inpatient and outpatient competency evaluations \nand restorative treatment (“competency services”). \n \n2)  Recommend a plan for the Department’s consideration that proposes methods for \naddressing short- and long- term compliance with the timeframes for competency services that \nmay ultimately be adopted in whole or in part as part of the court’s injunctive relief to address the \nongoing breach of the Amended and Restated Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”).1 \n \n3)  Develop a system of data collection, review, and analysis of Departmental data and \ncontinued  monitoring  related  to  competency  services,  to  include  monthly  reporting  by  the \nDepartment to the Special Master, and monthly reporting by the Special Master analyzing such \ndata and making recommendations to the Court based on such data. \n \n                                                           \n1 Defendants request that this duty and the one set forth in Paragraph 8 be modified by “provided \nthat the interpretation of such duties does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.”  As the \ncourt noted in its prior Memorandum Opinion and Order, the  very terms of the Amended \nSettlement Agreement and the Defendants’ breach of such agreement has necessarily altered the \napplication of the doctrine.  [#113 at 22 n.2].  Accordingly, while the court remains mindful of its \nauthority and basis for subject matter jurisdiction, Kort v. Hufnagel, 729 P. 2d 270 (Colo. 1986) \n(en banc), the court clearly retains jurisdiction to enforce the Amended Settlement Agreement and \nprovide relief for the breach thereunder.  In addition, the Special Master’s duties are limited to a \nrecommendation for a plan for the Department’s consideration that may ultimately be adopted as \npart of the court’s injunctive relief, and therefore the duties of the Special Master do not implicate \nthe separation of powers doctrine. \n6 \n \n\n4)  Identify actual areas within the statewide system which have caused, are causing, \nor may cause non-compliance with the timeframe requirements of the Settlement Agreement \nconcerning competency services. \n \n5)  Make recommendations to the Department for improved performance in the timely \ndelivery of competency services. \n \n6)  Assist the Department in designing and implementing a plan to address compliance \nwith the Settlement Agreement timeframes concerning inpatient competency restoration treatment, \nsupport the Department’s implementation of its plan, and monitor the Department’s compliance \nwith such Settlement Agreement during the duration of the Appointment. \n \n7)  Survey  the  Department’s  efforts  to  attain  compliance  with  the  Settlement \nAgreement’s timeframe requirements concerning competency services and report to the Court and \nparties on the progress towards reaching compliance on those timeframes on a monthly basis, \nincluding documenting which efforts require action or approval by third-parties. \n \n8)  Assist the court in fashioning and evaluating compliance with any injunctive relief \nordered by the court. \n \n9)  The Department shall report monthly to the Special Master, the Court, and the \nPlaintiff on the status of the waitlist, the progress toward reaching the goal, and what impediments, \nif any, exist. \n \n10)  Make other recommendations to the Court and the parties on how to improve \ndelivery of competency services for the purpose of effectuating compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement timelines concerning competency restoration services, including how to audit the \nState’s performance. \n \n11)  Submit reports to the Court and parties, as defined in the court’s Rule 53 Order \n \nB.  Duties and Reporting: \n \nIn order for the Special Master to make such recommendations to the Court and the \nDepartment as specified above, the Department shall provide information the Special Master seeks \nfor the purpose of carrying out his or her specific duties and obligations identified in this document. \n \nAs part of his or her duties, the Special Master shall provide the Court and the Parties with \nstatus reports every other month for the first six months (starting thirty days after receiving the \nDepartment’s report identified in number 3 above), and then quarterly thereafter. Such reports shall \naddress  the  Department’s  compliance  with  the  timeframe  requirements  of  the  Settlement \nAgreement concerning competency services, and shall provide a detailed summary of information \nand recommendations the Special Master believes the Court and Parties should consider relating \nto  the  Department’s  compliance  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes  concerning \ncompetency services. The Special Master’s report shall include, but not be limited to, reporting on \n7 \n \n\nthe number of Pretrial Detainees ordered to receive competency services and admission and/or \nevaluation timeframes for those Pretrial Detainees, an assessment of the Department’s operations, \nsystems, and admissions practices and policies relating to the Department’s ability to comply with \nthe Settlement Agreement timeframes concerning provision of competency services, and guidance \nto the Department for improvement and increasing efficiencies in these areas. \n \nThe Special Master shall have reasonable access  to  all records that the Department \ndetermines  are  reasonably  related  to  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes  concerning \ncompetency services or the Department’s ability to meet and comply with the proposed Plan \n[#122-1]. The Special Master shall be able to request the Department organize the data in a format \nwhich is necessary for the Special Master’s efficient review. As a component of his or her \nreporting, the Special Master may select a sample of Pretrial Detainees from the Department’s \nmonthly reporting and audit the timeliness by the Department of that sample’s Offered Admission \ndates for competency evaluations or restoration treatment. The Special Master shall include its \nfindings of any such audit in his or her reports, and those reports shall be provided to the parties \nand filed with the Court, with any private or confidential information redacted from the public \nfiling. \n \n  The Special Master shall have the right to confer and subcontract with additional experts (but \nnot allow double billing), as he or she determines in the exercise of his or her professional judgment \nwould be helpful to the Court or the Parties, including for preparation of additional reports, studies, \nor research. \n \nC.  Visitation and Access: \n \nThe Special Master shall have the authority and responsibility to visit and access Colorado \nfacilities, confer with stakeholders in the criminal justice and mental health systems, review \ndocuments, staff procedures, patient records, access to budget and resources available and funding \nstreams related to the Department’s duties under the Settlement Agreement and competency \nevaluations and restorative treatment, generally. Neither the Special Master nor the Parties shall \npublicly disclose information obtained by the Special Master pursuant to this paragraph, which \nwould otherwise be privileged or confidential, without consent of all Parties and/or order of the \ncourt. \n \nD.  Compensation: \n \nAs a result of the Department’s ongoing breach of the Settlement Agreement since June \n2018, and as an interim remedy to the breach, the Special Master’s invoices must be submitted to \nthe Court for payment by the Department. \n \nWhile the Special Master is appointed, the Independent Consultant’s duties are stayed, \nalleviating the Department of paying two individuals. The Department shall compensate the \nSpecial Master and his or her staff at his or her standard rates. The Department shall reimburse all \nreasonable expenses of the Special Master and Special Master’s staff consistent with the State’s \ngovernment  rates,  procurement  guidelines,  and  Department  policy,  including  for  travel  and \naccommodations. \n8 \n \n\n \nE.  Duration: \n \nThe Special Master shall be engaged and paid for by the Department until the Department \ncomes  into  compliance  with  the  Settlement  Agreement  timeframes  concerning  inpatient \ncompetency restoration services and maintains such compliance for a continuous period of 18 \nmonths.  The Parties may file motions with the court to alter the duration of the Special Master’s \nengagement (either terminate or extend the services of the Special Master), upon good cause \nshown. \n \nCONCLUSION \nConsistent with the directives set forth herein, this Order hereby APPOINTS Groundswell \nServices and its team of Drs. Neil Gowensmith and Daniel Murrie as Special Master in this matter.  \n \nDATED:  December 28, 2018        BY THE COURT: \n                 \n \n______________________ \n                Nina Y.

      "text": "Case 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 23\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \n \nCivil Action No. 11-CV-02285-BNB \n \nCENTER FOR LEGAL ADVOCACY, d/b/a  \nDISABILITY LAW COLORADO, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \n \nREGGIE BICHA,  \nin his official capacity as Executive Director  \nof the Colorado Department of Human Services, and  \n \nRONALD B.

Disability Law Colorado respectfully \nmoves the Court to reopen this action for enforcement of the settlement agreement between \nPlaintiff and Defendants. In support of this Motion, Disability Law Colorado (“DLC”) states as \nfollows: \nCertification pursuant to D.C.Colo.LCivR 7.1 \nCounsel for Plaintiff and Defendants have had substantial dialogue beginning in July 2015 \nabout the matters raised in this motion. That conferral has included numerous letters, emails, \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 23\nphone calls, and face-to-face meetings, but the parties have been unable to resolve what DLC \nbelieves are breaches of the agreement that settled this action. On October 23, 2015, Defendants \ninformed Plaintiffs that they oppose the relief sought herein. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Plaintiff filed a complaint on August 31, 2011, against Defendants, Reggie Bicha, \nExecutive Director of the Colorado Department of Human Services and Teresa A. Bernal, \nInterim Superintendent of the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (“CMHIP”) in their \nofficial capacities. (Doc. 1.) The complaint alleged that these Colorado Officials failed to timely \nadmit pre-trial detainees in jails across the State of Colorado into CMHIP, the State’s only \nforensic mental health facility, for competency evaluations and restorative treatment for those \ndetermined to be incompetent to stand trial.  This failure created unconstitutional delays to \nprovide competency evaluations and treatment for up to eighty pretrial detainees, for as long as \nsix months.  As a result, presumptively innocent pretrial detainees were languishing in \nColorado’s jails in violation of their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution. Colorado was denying people with serious mental illness their \nconstitutionally protected liberty interest in freedom from incarceration absent a criminal \nconviction.  \n2.  The parties participated in several settlement conferences with Magistrate Judge \nBoyd N. Boland, which produced a Settlement Agreement. (Doc. 51-1, attached hereto as Exhibit \n1.) The Agreement was incorporated by reference in the Court’s Order of Dismissal under Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 41(a)(2) (the “Dismissal Order”). (Doc. No.  52, attached hereto as Exhibit 2.)  \n- 2 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 23\n3.  As set forth below, Defendants have breached the Settlement Agreement and \nDLC seeks the aid of this Court to enforce the Agreement, a role the Court expressly reserved for \nitself in the Dismissal Order. \n4.  The current situation is tragic and disturbing. There are an estimated 100 people \nlocked up in jails across the State of Colorado waiting for court-ordered competency \nexaminations or for restorative treatment.  They are waiting in jail for competency evaluations \nand treatment for far longer than the 28 days permitted for admission to CMHIP for inpatient \ncompetency evaluations or admission for restorative treatment and 30 days for outpatient \ncompetency evaluations (evaluations in jails).  \n5.  Many of these people who are suffering from serious mental illness are being held \nin jail due to an arrest on minor offenses, but they cannot afford the most minimal bail to be \nreleased from jail as they wait resolution of their cases.  As a result of the lengthy wait times to be \nadmitted to CMHIP for medication, competency evaluation, and restoration, they often stay in \njails waiting for admission to CMHIP longer than, while presumptively innocent, the offered plea \nbargain would have afforded them if they had plead guilty on arrest, or in some cases, if they even \nserved the entire sentence on the top charge. \n6.  One example of this involves the case of J.L.  On May 2, 2015, J.L. was arrested \nand charged with relatively minor offenses of verbal harassment and misdemeanor menacing.  \nWhile out on a personal recognizance bond, he was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor \nviolation of a protection order in Elbert County.  J.L. was housed in a county jail of a rural county.  \nJ.L. is severely mentally ill and went off his schizophrenia medications shortly before the events \ngiving rise to his charges.  (See Affidavit of Douglas K. Wilson, attached hereto as Exhibit 3.) \n- 3 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 23\n7.  J.L.'s attorney, and deputy public defender, raised competency on June 18, 2015.  \nOn July 24, 2015 the Elbert County Court received the outpatient competency report.  On \nAugust 12, 2015, J.L. was found incompetent and ordered to be committed to CMHIP for \ntreatment and restoration.   Since then, CMHIP has kept pushing his anticipated admittance date \nback, from October to November and now December.  His anticipated admission date now is \nearly December, 2015.  J.L's father (who is one of the victims) has been in constant contact with \nJ.L's attorney and is worried about how debilitating a long county jail stint will be for J.L. because \nof his schizophrenia.  J.L. has been without medication for so long and is so delusional that if \nprovided a personal recognizance bond without support from a community mental health \nprovider, his mental illness will land him derelict on the streets or he will pick up new charges \nand end up back in jail.   On or about October 1, J.L. was moved from the Elbert County jail to \nDouglas County jail due to the availability of a mental health unit in the Douglas County Jail. (See \nid. ¶ 4(e)). As of this date, J.L., who was found incompetent to proceed, has been waiting to be \nadmitted to CMHIP for 90 days—well beyond the 28 day timeframe agreed upon by the \nDefendants in the Settlement Agreement. \n8.  J.L. and all of the others currently awaiting competency evaluations or restoration \ntreatment are stranded between Colorado’s criminal justice and mental health systems, and \nbecause of their mental illness, many of them cannot comprehend the nature of the criminal \nproceedings, or assist counsel to defend against the criminal accusations, in accordance with \nC.R.S. § 16-8.5-102.  These people have a constitutional right to care and treatment to stop the \nsymptoms of their mental illness from interfering with their ability to comprehend the nature of \nwhy they have been arrested and how to assist in their defense.  In the last six months, courts \n- 4 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 23\nhave ordered immediate transport to CMHIP for these individuals, understanding that these \npeople need to be in a therapeutic environment and around mental health professionals that will \nassist them with the burdens of their illness, suicidal thoughts and actions.  But, as of now, \nCMHIP is refusing to admit these individuals in a timely manner, denying them of the help they \nneed.    \n9.  The cases of N.C. and S.D. exemplify this tragic situation.  N.C. was arrested in \nBoulder, Colorado in early September 2015 on low level felony offenses. He was extremely \nsuicidal on arrest, which included bringing razor blades into the jail upon arrest for the purpose of \ncommitting suicide.  N.C. swallowed the razor blades while in the jail, and once the court was \ninformed of his mental illness and risk to commit suicide, it ordered in September that N.C. be \ntransported to the hospital for a competency examination.   But CMHIP indicated it would not be \nadmitting N.C. until February 2016.  Since that time, N.C. attempted to commit suicide by \nhanging himself in his cell.  Adding a Kafkaesque element to N.C.’s situation, he was charged \nwith introducing contraband (razors) into the jail.  (Plaintiff can provide testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence supporting this account at a hearing on this motion.) \n10.  S.D. was charged and arrested in Arapahoe County on a Boulder warrant on June \n26, 2015 for allegedly driving under restraint in Boulder County Jail.  He was advised in Boulder \nCounty of the charges against him on June 29, 2015.  He was provided a plea bargain to plead \nguilty to a 3 point ticket and the case would be dismissed with no jail. However, after S.D. was \narrested he was unable to appear in court because he was experiencing serious symptoms of his \nmental illness.  After seeing the state he was in, his lawyer requested that S.D. be evaluated for \ncompetency in the jail (an outpatient evaluation) and the court ordered it on July 2, 2015.  S.D. \n- 5 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 23\nthen sat in the Boulder County Jail for another two-and-a-half months without receiving an \nevaluation.  Because of his severe illness, S.D. refused to bathe, was covered in his own feces, his \ncell was covered in feces, and he refused to speak or respond to questions in English or Spanish.  \nS.D. has no known family or friends. His lawyer indicates that he was one of the most severely ill \nclients she has ever seen.  On September 14, 2015, after waiting more than 90 days for a \ncompetency examination, with no confirmed date of examination in sight, S.D.'s lawyer was \nfinally capable of convincing the deputy district attorney to dismiss the case, and S.D. was taken \nby ambulance or sheriff to a psychiatric hospital and put on a mental health hold.  (See Ex. 3 ¶ \n4(a).) \n11.  A natural and desperate consequence to the extraordinary length of jail stays that \nare occurring in breach of the agreement is that there is no place to keep detainees safe from \nthemselves or other inmates while in jail except to lock them away in solitary confinement or \n“lock down.” Solitary confinement is not therapeutic, and most of the time it is contraindicated \nfor an individual who is experiencing psychosis or delusions.  In some cases, while being \nphysically restrained, or being forcibly taken to isolation, detainees may flail or intentionally hit \nthe corrections officers who are trying to move them, resulting in felony assault charges being \nadded to the list of criminal charges facing the detainee.   \n12.  The cases of C.R. and J.E. exemplify this terrible circumstance.  C.R. was charged \nwith minor crimes all as a result of conduct related to his untreated mental illness.  The court \ndetermined C.R. to be incompetent, and on July 8, 2015, an Adams County Judge ordered that \nhe be committed to CMHIP for restorative treatment.  C.R. was not transported to CMHIP \nuntil September 11, 2015, more than two months later.  In that time, his attorney reported that \n- 6 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 23\nAdams County jail records reflected that C.R. was getting taunted because he was concerned he \nwould be raped, and this perseveration about rape is alleged to be a part of his mental illness.  \nEventually, this taunting caused C.R. to get into an altercation with the inmate and C.R. was \ndisciplined and given three days of solitary confinement.  This caused him to become severely \nsuicidal and traumatized him.  Again, he got into an altercation with his new cellmate who tried \nto kick him out of his bunk.  He was disciplined again with three days in solitary confinement.   \nThis caused additional delusions and psychosis.  C.R. refused mental health medication, and he \ncannot be forcibly medicated in the jail, so C.R. was left untreated and very ill.    \n13.  C.R. was finally transported on September 11, 2015, more than 90 days past the \nagreed upon timeline for C.R.’s admission to CMHIP.   At CMHIP, where he was provided with \nmental health medication, C.R. was “restored” to competency in seven days and returned back \nto Adams County Jail.  But, that medication is not available to C.R. at the jail.  When he returned \nto the jail, the district attorney offered him a misdemeanor plea and immediate release, and \ninstead of another four month wait for a second competency evaluation in the jail, where he is left \nunmedicated, C.R. is declining to challenge the finding that he was competent.  (C.R.’s counsel \ncontacted Ms. Eytan in early July 2015 who told counsel of CMHIP’s delay. However, Ms. Eytan \nindicated she would investigate, but all the settlement reports indicated that CMHIP was \nmeeting all timelines and C.R.’s delay must be related to some administrative issue.  It was the \ninvestigation of this case that caused the revelation that CMHIP was in fact manufacturing data \nto make it appear as if it were complying with the Agreement.  Plaintiff can provide testimonial \nand documentary evidence supporting this account at a hearing on this motion.) \n- 7 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 23\n14.  J.E. was charged with misdemeanors of resisting arrest, harassment, and reckless \nendangerment.  After an order for an evaluation issued on July 30, 2015, J.E. was found \nincompetent to proceed on August 20, 2015 and ordered to be transferred to CMHIP.  While \nwaiting in Larimer County Jail for admission to CMHIP for restoration to competency, J.E. was \ncharged with a felony assault.  The victim of the alleged assault was a corrections officer that was \ntrying to subdue J.E.  And, upon information and belief, the true cause of this alleged assault is a \nresult of her untreated schizophrenia.  J.E. is not to be transferred to restoration until December \n29, 2015, more than 120 days past the date on which J.E. was ordered transferred to CMHIP.  \nAnd, when or if J.E. returns to court restored to competency she will have to defend not only \nagainst misdemeanor offenses, but new felony assault charges picked up while she was awaiting \nmental health treatment.  It is likely that five months in jail would be longer than any plea bargain \nshe would have been offered upon arrest in July.  (Plaintiff can provide testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence supporting this account at a hearing on this motion.). \n15.  As described more fully below, DLC did not immediately learn of the crisis \nbuilding in Colorado’s jails because the monthly reporting the Department was required to make \nunder the Settlement Agreement was false and misleading, and did not accurately report the \nstatus of all pretrial detainees referred for competency evaluations and restorative treatment.   \n16.  The first report under the Settlement Agreement was the July 2012 report due \nSeptember 1, 2012.  The August 2012 Report was due on October 1st and so on, such that the \nreports run one month behind.  (See Declaration of Jennifer L. Purrington ¶ 2, attached hereto as \nExhibit 4.)  Early on in the reporting process DLC’s Staff Attorney, Jennifer L. Purrington, \naudited several entries in the monthly settlement reports and determined that the information \n- 8 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 23\nand data being reported by the Department was accurate.  Thereafter, DLC relied exclusively on \nthe information and data provided by the Department in determining compliance with the \nSettlement Agreement deadlines.  (Id. ¶ 5.)   \n17.  All original monthly reports provided to DLC up through June 2015 showed that \nthe “days waiting,”  “averages,” and “out-patient” evaluation times were within the terms of \nthe Settlement Agreement other than requests for special circumstances which were granted. (Id. \n¶ 7.) \n18.  From the inception of the Settlement Agreement through mid-July 2015, DLC did \nnot receive any reports or complaints from or on behalf of inmates alleging excessive delays in the \nadmissions process. (Id. ¶ 6.)  \n19.  But in mid- July 2015, DLC began receiving reports and complaints from public \ndefenders, private attorneys, family members, and a judge that inmates were not being admitted \nto CMHIP for evaluation and restoration within the settlement deadlines and in some cases it \nwas taking months for inmates to be admitted to CMHIP.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  DLC later learned that \nreporting provided by the Defendants was false and misleading. (Id. ¶¶ 18-20, 25.) \nARGUMENT \n \nA.  This Court Is Authorized to Reopen this Action to Enforce the Settlement \nAgreement, and Good Cause Exists to Do So \n \n20.  During the pendency of this action, the Court had jurisdiction pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 2201-02, and pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  (Ex. 2 ¶ 1.)  \n21.  The Dismissal Order states, “The Parties shall comply with the terms of their \nSettlement Agreement entered into on April 6, 2012, a copy of which is attached hereto and \nincorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.” (Id. ¶ 3.)  The Dismissal Order also \n- 9 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 23\nretained continuing jurisdiction over the settlement and enforcement of the Settlement \nAgreement until after the conclusion of the term of the agreement under the authority of \nKokkenen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co., 511 U.S. 375, 381-82 (1994) and Bell v. Board of County \nCommissioners, 451 F.3d 1097, 1103 (10th Cir. 2006). (Id. ¶ 5.)   \n22.  The Agreement continues in effect and has not been modified or amended by \nmutual written agreement or waiver.  \n23.  A district court may reopen a case and retain jurisdiction over the implementation \nand enforcement of a settlement agreement when, as here, its dismissal order expressly states \nthat it will maintain continuing jurisdiction. Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 381-83; see also Mitchell v. \nEstrada, No. 03-cv-00387, 2012 WL 2919604, at *2 (D. Colo. 2012). \n24.  As illustrated by the circumstances described in the Introduction to this Motion, \nand as further explained below, there is good cause to reopen this action to permit DLC to \nenforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  Without such enforcement, many \npresumptively innocent pretrial detainees in Colorado will languish in jail, in dangerous and \ndebilitating conditions, waiting for competency evaluations and restorative treatment, for periods \nfar longer than is permitted under the United States Constitution.  \nB.  Defendants Failed to Meet the Requirements for Conducting Competency \nEvaluations and Restorative Treatment under the Express Terms of the Settlement \nAgreement \n \n25.  The keystone of the Settlement Agreement is a timeframe within which the \nDefendants are obligated to conduct competency evaluations and restorative treatment. The \nSettlement Agreement requires Defendants to admit pretrial detainees to CMHIP for in-patient \nrestorative treatment and competency evaluations no later than 28 days after the pretrial \n- 10 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 23\ndetainees’ “Ready for Admission Date,” with such date defined as, “the date on which the \nhospital has received the Court Order for admission to the Hospital, and, in the case of a court-\nordered Competency Evaluation, the Collateral Materials required for the evaluation must be \nreceived by the Hospital for a Pretrial Detainee to be ‘Ready for Admission.’” (Ex. 1 §§ 1(p), 2.)  \nThe Settlement Agreement also requires CMHIP to maintain a “Monthly Average of 24 days or \nless for all admissions within a calendar month.”   (Id. § 1(l).)  Defendants have breached the \nSettlement Agreement by failing to admit pretrial detainees within 28 days of their ready for \nadmission date and by failing to maintain a “Monthly Average” of 24 days. \n26.  The July 2015 monthly Monitoring Report shows that Defendants failed to meet \nthe 28-day admissions deadline in all but three cases out of 103.  In addition to the data provided \nbelow, the August data recently received from CMHIP shows that the Defendants again failed to \nmeet the 28-day admissions deadline in all but two cases out of 148 within the August report. (See \nEx. 4, pp. 6-12, Tables 1A & 1B.)  The average for May 2015, using the audited report, was 27.35 \ndays.  The average for June 2015, using the audited report, was 43.57.  The average for July was \n48.18 and the average for August was 58.87.  In each of those months, Defendants were in breach \nof the 24-day monthly average required by the Settlement Agreement. \n27.  Based upon reports provided in September 2015, wait times for pretrial detainees \nto be admitted to CMHIP for competency evaluations or restorative treatment have grown to \naround 100 days.  Individuals waiting for restorative treatment waited up to ninety days for their \nevaluation, and then another ninety days for transport to treatment, resulting in an up to six-\nmonth delay before they receive constitutionally required restorative treatment.  \n- 11 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 23\n28.  The Settlement Agreement also imposes time frames for the completion of out-\npatient competency evaluations in the county jails instead of at CMHIP.  The Agreement \nrequires that “[t]he Department shall complete all Out-Patient Evaluations of a Pretrial Detainee \nno later than 30 days after the Hospital’s receipt of a Court Order directing the evaluation and \nreceipt of Collateral Materials.”  (Ex. 1 § 2(b).) It has been recently reported that the \nDepartment is in breach of the Settlement Agreement by failing to complete outpatient \nevaluations within thirty days, some of which have taken up to one hundred days to complete. \n(See Ex. 3 ¶ 4(b).)  \n29.  It is estimated that 25% of pretrial detainees listed in the Department’s reports are \nindividuals being held in jail as a result of an arrest on petty or misdemeanor offenses. Tragically, \nthe length of their detention while waiting for an evaluation or treatment exceeds what jail \nsentence they likely would have received if they had pled guilty on the day they were arrested.  \nMany of these pretrial detainees are seriously mentally ill, psychotic, in danger of harming \nthemselves or others, and are victimized by other detainees as they wait for a humane \nenvironment to be evaluated and treated. (See id. ¶¶ 2-4.) \nC.  Defendants Also Breached the Settlement Agreement by Providing Plaintiffs’ \nCounsel, the Pro-Bono Monitors, with False and Misleading Monthly Monitoring \nReports \n \n30.   The Settlement Agreement requires Defendants to submit monthly monitoring \nreports to DLC setting forth dates and data that reflect, among other things, the “Days Waiting” \nthe “Ready for Admission” date; and the “Offered Admission” date for pretrial detainees.  (Ex. \n1, § 3(a)-(c).)  The Plaintiff has reviewed these reports and reconciled the data on a pro bono basis \nfor the last two-and-a-half years.   \n- 12 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 23\n31.  Defendants have breached the Settlement Agreement by submitting monthly \nmonitoring reports containing materially inaccurate and false dates and data. Audited reports \nrecently provided by the Defendants to DLC, after DLC confronted the Department, show that \ninaccurate data has been provided to DLC as early as March 2015, with six instances in March, \none in April, twenty-two in May, and sixty-four in June.  (See Ex. 4 ¶ 18.). Currently DLC has \ndetermined that Defendants provided them with incorrect data in four separate reports.  (See id. \n¶¶ 18-26.) DLC relied on the Department’s inaccurate monthly reports to determine compliance \nwith the Settlement Agreement.  (Id. ¶ 5.) \n32.  DLC believes that Defendants have been in breach of the Settlement Agreement \nfor months preceding mid-July 2015, the time when DLC first became aware that a problem \nexisted with timely performance under the Settlement Agreement.  DLC believes that \nDefendants have been in breach of the Settlement Agreement from at least March 2015.  (See id., \n¶ 25.)   \nD.  Defendants Took Unilateral Action Detrimentally Slowing Admissions, Creating a \nWait List, and Violating Hundreds of Individuals’ Constitutional Rights  \n \n33.  In late July 2015, DLC learned of a pretrial detainee whose attorney claimed had \nwaited more than sixty days to obtain restorative treatment at CMHIP.  DLC received similar \nreports around that time, consisting of desperate calls for help and complaints from inmates’ \nfamily members, public defenders, a county jail and a county court judge exposing that CMHIP \nwas taking months in some cases to admit pretrial detainees for competency evaluations and \nrestorative mental health treatment.  One source told DLC that the Department had issued an \ninternal directive limiting admissions to no more than one per day.  (See Declaration of Mark J., \nIvandick ¶ 3, attached hereto as Exhibit 5.) \n- 13 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 23\n34.  It was evident the data the Defendants had been providing DLC with was false \nand misleading, and the information regarding the directive limiting admissions was deeply \nconcerning.  Upon learning this information, Plaintiffs contacted counsel for the Defendants on \nJuly 31, 2015.  (See Ex. 4, ¶¶ 25-26; Ex. 5, ¶ 3.) \n35.  After tiresome inquiries, Defendants finally disclosed an email to Plaintiff in \nSeptember 2015 that proved Defendants issued a written directive to limit patient admissions to \nno more than one admission per day starting on June 2, 2015. (See Ex. 5 ¶ 3.) Plaintiff was never \nnotified of that policy change at the time it was implemented, or later on July 28, 2015, when \nSuperintendent Hale denied its existence, which is disturbing in light of the fact that such a \npolicy could only have the effect of causing the Department to fail to comply with the Settlement \nAgreement. The unilateral directive limiting admissions caused a wait list to grow to more than \n70 inmates waiting for admission to CMHIP for competency evaluations and restorative \ntreatment.   \n36.  Defendants’ unilateral action in developing a policy that delayed admissions, \nwithout consulting Plaintiff, denying that such a policy existed, and by submitting monthly \nreports containing false and misleading data and then invoking Departmental Special \nCircumstances, is a breach of their duties of good faith and fair dealing under the Settlement \nAgreement. See Amoco Oil Co. v. Ervin, 908 P.2d 493, 498 (Colo. 1995) (explaining that “every \ncontract contains an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing” to “effectuate the intentions of \nthe parties or to honor their reasonable expectations”). \n37.  At first, DLC did not detect the Department’s violation of the Settlement \nAgreement because the growing problem initially was hidden by the Department in the false and \n- 14 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of 23\nmisleading monthly reports. It was only through reports and complaints from families of \ndetainees, the lawyers representing them, and a judge’s report that DLC learned of the collapse \nof the Department’s compliance with the Settlement Agreement. By now, the waiting list for \ncompetency evaluations has grown to approximately 100 detainees. \n38.  Plaintiff has used good faith efforts to try and resolve the dispute concerning the \nDefendants invocation of Departmental Special Circumstances; however, these efforts have \nfailed to resolve the defendants’ breach of the Settlement Agreement and therefore Plaintiff is \nseeking judicial enforcement of the settlement agreement.  (See Ex 1. ¶ 6(c).) \nE.  Defendants Have Improperly Invoked “Departmental Special Circumstances” to \nJustify Their Breaches of the Settlement Agreement \n39.  On August 3, 2015, months after missing admission deadlines and submitting \nmisleading monthly reports to Plaintiff, the Defendants invoked “Departmental Special \nCircumstances” citing circumstances beyond the control of the Department which impact \nCMHIP’s ability to comply with the admission timeframes set by the Settlement Agreement.  \n(See Ex. 4 ¶ 10.) The Department also requested the invocation of “Departmental Special \nCircumstances” be applied retroactively to June 30, 2015.  Essentially, the Department claims it \ncan no longer meet the admissions timeframes because of two factors; (1) a dramatic increase in \nthe number of referrals for evaluations and treatment, and (2) unprecedented staffing shortages \nat CMHIP.  \n40.  On August 20, 2015, the parties conferenced and reviewed the reasons for \ninvoking “Departmental Special Circumstances” discussing various issues and options related to \nsolving the looming problem.  Plaintiffs being unaware of the severity of the problem, the cause, \nand the resources available, indicated that they were relying on the Department’s expertise in \n- 15 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of 23\noperating a mental health system and the Department was asked to develop a “short-term” \n“quick and innovative solution” to address the crisis at hand. (Ex. 5 ¶ 6.) The goal:  to clear the \nwait list and return to the admission time frames of the Settlement Agreement. \n41.  Additionally at the August 20th meeting, in anticipation of evaluating the \nDepartment’s Proposal, Plaintiffs requested the corrected monthly reports from March 2015 \nforward, as well as a copy of the current wait list and documentation of the alleged June 2015 \ndirective to only admit one patient a day.  Defendants agreed to provide the Plaintiff with these \nitems. (Id. ¶ 7.) \n42.  On September 3, 2015, the Department submitted its Proposal to cure its breach \nof the Settlement Agreement.  The Proposal did not offer a “short-term” “quick and innovative \nsolution” to address the crisis at hand.  (See Ex. D to the Purrington Declaration, Ex. 4.)   \nTherefore, Plaintiff found the Department’s Proposal to be ineffective to address the crisis it \ncreated, or allowed to develop.  (See Ex. E to the Purrington Declaration, Ex. 4.) \n43.  The current and historical staffing problems at CMHIP were discussed.   \nSignificantly, Plaintiff rejected that this crisis was the result of a “Departmental Special \nCircumstance.”  It was, rather, a failure to tend to the historical and systemic issues affecting the \nmental health system in Colorado, and a failure to work with and fund the community mental \nhealth system.  Indeed, Defendants have been aware of the systemic issues causing the problem \nof delayed admissions for at least the last twenty years. (Id. ¶ 8-9.) \n44.   Neiberger v. Hawkins, Civil Case No. 99-B-1120 (MJW), was filed in this court in \n1999 against the Colorado Department of Human Services and CMHIP’s superintendent, Robert \nHawkins, by a group of patients committed to CMHIP for care and treatment after being found \n- 16 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of 23\nnot guilty by reason of insanity. The third amended complaint alleged that these patients’ \nconstitutional rights were being violated for among other claims, a continued pattern of \nsubstandard care, as a result of Defendants’ failure to secure the financial and human resources \nnecessary to provide minimally adequate care.  Specifically, Defendants were accused of \noperating CMHIP’s forensic institute at staffing levels below the levels necessary to provide \nminimally adequate care to its patients.  The Plaintiffs requested relief including a request that \nthe Court mandate the Defendants to immediately take the steps necessary to reduce dangerous \nunderstaffing. (Id. ¶ 10.) \n45.  The Neiberger plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction supported by \nevidence alleging, among other things, that for the prior eight years, CMHIP had been \nunderstaffed.  That understaffing has been a persistent problem since at least 1994.  In 1994, a \nsituational analysis was reviewed at an executive retreat that stated CMHIP was understaffed by \nat least 80 positions of which 25-30 positions were nursing positions.  The understaffing pattern \ncontinued and was documented by the state agency, the Health Care Financing Administration, \n(HCFA), responsible for funding operations at CMHIP.  In 1996, HCFA surveyors found \nunderstaffing at CMHIP citing 26 nursing vacancies. (Id. ¶ 11.) \n46.  In fiscal years 2000 and 2001 the Joint Accreditation of Hospitals Commission  \n(JAHCO) threatened to de-certify CMHIP due to inadequate staffing.  Despite serious \nunderstaffing, the Neiberger defendants did not request funds from the legislature for the \nimmediate increases in staffing necessary to meet the minimum staffing levels. (Id. ¶ 12.) \n- 17 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 18 of 23\n47.  In 2002, Neiberger settled and Defendants agreed to fill vacant staff positions with \npermanent employees and committed to maintaining future staffing ratios at levels to avoid \nunderstaffing. (Id. ¶ 13.) \n48.   By late 2006, however, there were approximately 85 pretrial detainees in county \njails across Colorado, who were experiencing significant wait times, some as long as six months, \nto be admitted to CMHIP for competency evaluations and restorative mental health treatment. \n(Id. ¶ 14.) \n49.  Denver District Court Judge M. Egelhoff issued a show cause order in the cases \nPeople v. Zuniga, 06CR999, People v. Kirkwood, 06CR5797, and People v. Sims, 05CR2277.  Judge \nEgelhoff then found the Colorado Department of Human Services, (CDHS) and CMHIP in \ncontempt of his orders to admit three inmates to CMHIP for competency evaluations and \nrestorative mental health treatment. (Ex. 5 ¶ 15.) \n50.  Judge Egelhoff appointed special counsel (undersigned counsel among them) to \nprosecute the contempt citations, and the Department and CMHIP claimed staff shortages and \nlack of bed space as the principle reason for the delays in admitting pretrial detainees. Settlement \nconferences in those cases produced a global settlement agreement for all of the pre-trial \ndetainees on the wait-list, known as the “Zuniga agreement.”  The Zuniga agreement required \nCMHIP to admit pretrial detainees from across the state within 24 days of receipt of a court \norder for evaluation or restorative treatment. (Id. ¶ 16.) \n51.  The Zuniga agreement expired in June 2009, which by design coincided with the \nopening of the 200-plus bed Hawkin’s High Security Forensics Institute (HSFI) on the CMHIP \n- 18 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 19 of 23\ncampus.  The parties and mediator was assured that the HSFI would solve the admissions \nproblems in the future, thus a June 2009 expiration date. (Id. ¶ 17.) \n52.  With the opening of the HSFI and over the next year or so, CMHIP experienced \nsignificant stresses on its operations and staffing.  The economic downturn created high state \ndeficits and the need for budget cuts and hiring freezes, as well as administrative staff furloughs.  \nThe long-standing challenges in recruiting mental health staff remained as a significant \nimpediment to CMHIP’s ability to timely admit pretrial detainees for evaluation and treatment.  \nIn addition, the number of court-ordered referrals continued to increase. (Id. ¶ 18.) \n53.  After three patient deaths at CMHIP, CDHS hired a group of nationally \nrecognized mental health consultants to complete a thorough review of CMHIP’s operations.  \nThe consultants’ report delivered in November 2010 found that CMHIP was significantly \nunderstaffed by as much as 20%, which translated to approximately 50 nursing staff, with \npsychiatric staffing falling below the agreed upon levels of the most recent lawsuit, the Neiberger \ncase.  Requests for relief in hiring emergency staffing by way of locum tenens have been denied, \nthereby resulting in additional stress on CMHIP’s operations. (Id. ¶ 19.) \n54.  The consultants found that CMHIP’s understaffing appears to be related to, \namong other things, inadequate funding and recommended that CDHS should advocate for \nincreased funding for staffing at CMHIP as a priority with the Colorado legislature.  (Id. ¶ 20.)   \n55.  Staffing shortages, underfunding by the legislature, a long-standing pattern of \nincreases in forensic referrals and the Zuniga agreement requirements that pushed CMHIP for \nfaster admissions to the HSFI (24 days from court order to admission) combined once again to \nslow admissions of pretrial detainees below constitutional standards. (Id. ¶ 21.) \n- 19 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 20 of 23\n56.  After receiving the consultants’ report, Plaintiff began monitoring CMHIP’s \nrecruitment efforts and its progress in obtaining funding from the legislature to hire \napproximately 54 nursing positions.  But in April 2011, Defendants received a supplemental \nbudget increase for only 21.5 additional nursing staff.  (Id. ¶¶ 22-23.) \n57.  In June 2011, Interim Superintendent Bernal, in response to a recent survey by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services that noted staffing and patient acuity as areas of \nconcern, informed staff that obtaining additional funding to increase staffing would be unlikely \ndue to the distressed budget.  She also noted there were pressures from the community to admit \npatients from the jails as the wait list from the jails was then over 70 with the longest wait of over \n80 days. (Id. ¶ 24.) \n58.  With no end in sight to the understaffing problem, resulting in the development of \nyet another wait list resulting in unconstitutional delays in admissions and out-patient \nevaluations, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this action on August 31, 2011, which in turn led to \nthe Settlement Agreement at issue. (Id. ¶ 25.) \n59.  It is undeniable that the system has collapsed.  But, it also undeniable that the \nreason for the collapse is not due to unanticipated or special circumstances. From the perspective \nof the pretrial detainees in Colorado’s jails, the unconstitutional and unconscionable delay in the \nprovision of competency evaluations is the result of a tragic pattern of institutional indifference. \n   \n- 20 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 21 of 23\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion and enter \nan order: \na.  reopening this action to conduct proceedings to enforce the Settlement \nAgreement;  \n \nb.  setting an evidentiary hearing on Defendants’ performance under the \nSettlement Agreement;   \n \nc.  finding that the Defendants breached the Settlement Agreement as alleged \nherein;  \n \nd.   directing Defendants to eliminate the wait list by February 3, 2016, or \nsooner; \n \ne.  directing Defendants to comply with the deadlines set out in the \nSettlement Agreement for all referrals made on and after December 1, \n2015; \n \nf.   appointing an independent monitor, acceptable to Plaintiff, with real-time \naccess to necessary information to monitor Defendants’ performance \nunder the Settlement Agreement; \n \ng.  awarding Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees associated with \nthe preparation and filing of this motion and the conduct of any further \nproceedings; and \n \nh.  granting such other or further relief against Defendants as the Court \ndeems just and proper. \n \n   \n- 21 - \n \n \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 53   Filed 10/28/15   USDC Colorado   Page 22 of 23\nDated this 28th day of October, 2015. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Jason M.

The \nundersigned Magistrate Judge considers the Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), the Order of \nReference  for  all  purposes  dated  February  21,  2012  [#44],  and  the  Reassignment  dated \nNovember 19, 2015 [#58]. \n   \n  Plaintiff Center for Legal Advocacy d/b/a Disability Law Colorado filed a similar motion \non October 28, 2015, [#53], which the court granted insofar as it found good cause to reopen this \nmatter to allow the court to consider whether the Settlement Agreement had been breached.

Arraj United States Courthouse \n901 19th Street \nDenver, CO 80294 \n \nJudge Wang,  \n \nAs you may recall from our May 2020 Quarterly Report and our email correspondence of May \n26-27, we had been working with CDHDS OBH and Disability Law Colorado to reach some form \nof agreement regarding the fines that would accumulate amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nSpecifically, you may recall that all parties (including DLC and Special Master) agreed that \nCOVID-19 represents a special, unforeseeable circumstance, but also agreed that the Consent \nDecree explicitly forbids formally invoking Departmental Special Circumstances until a later \ndate.  Therefore, the parties were engaged in ongoing discussions about how to handle the \nfines that will inevitably result from COVID-attributable delays.  On the one hand, all parties \nagree that the Department should not be fined for delays that are solely, truly caused only by \nCOVID.  On the other hand, all parties want to ensure that the COVID pandemic does not \nabsolve the Department from any duties for the timely service they can provide, or relieve \nthem from any sanctions (fines) they should rightly face for non-COVID delays. \n \nAs we discussed in the weeks preceding our May report, OBH proposed the best solution was to \nagree upon a fines amount that the Department would have incurred this year were it not for \nCOVID.  Next, OBH provided estimates (i.e., their own, and a “second opinion,” similar estimate \nfrom a statistician who was not employed by OBH) that they would have likely accumulated \nroughly $2 million in fines absent the COVID-19 pandemic.  They proposed that OBH agree to \nthis fines amount for the following year, rather than attempt to estimate the fines on a monthly \nbasis, which would require invoking Individual Special Circumstances (ISC) for each defendant \nwhose movement was hindered by precautions or procedures necessitated by the COVID-19 \npandemic.  From the perspective of OBH, this negotiated agreement would have been much \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 200   Filed 07/06/20   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 3\nPage 2 \n \nmore efficient than invoking ISC for individual cases, because the latter would require \nconsiderable effort from OBH, and considerable effort from DLC to review.  \n \nAt the time of our correspondence with you in late May, it seemed likely that DLC would accept \nthis proposal from the Department.  However, DLC ultimately (around mid-June) declined this \nproposal from the Department. Absent an agreement, OBH has defaulted back to an approach \nin which they will invoke ISC on every individual case whose progress has been slowed by the \nCOVID pandemic response.  This includes, for example, defendants who cannot be evaluated \npromptly because jails forbade external evaluators and did not allow for video-conferenced \nevaluations, and defendants who were found incompetent but could not be promptly \ntransitioned to the hospital because of delays necessary for safety (such as admitting \ndefendants in cohorts to monitor for infection). DLC’s stated rationale for preferring the \ninvocation of ISC on individual cases was to ensure that OBH could provide specific information \nabout each defendant’s status: what the barriers to transfer have been, what efforts OBH has \nmade to move them, and what options remain. DLC believes that transparent communication \nand individualized attention to the waitlist will continue to force OBH to make concerted efforts \nfor persons in need of competency services.  \n \nWe have monitored this negotiation attempt since mid-June, and we discussed it in our first \ntwo-party monthly meeting held at the end of June. (We intentionally delayed updating you, \nbecause we wanted to have some sense of how this process would work, and whether the \nparties would return to negotiation; they have not).  Overall, it is clear the process of invoking \nISC requires considerable work by OBH staff.  We anticipate this approach may, ultimately, \nresult in fewer fines paid by OBH (as compared to the proposed agreement of $2.5 million).  \nNevertheless, DLC appears generally satisfied with the approach, and reportedly appreciates \nthe individualized attention and documentation the process requires.  Thus, it appears that \nparties will continue with this plan (i.e., invoking ISC on many defendants) as the response to \ndelays caused by the COVID pandemic. \n \nFrankly, we had some concerns that this process—in which OBH proposed and agreement and \nDLC ultimately declined—reflected a setback.  There were ways in which it suggested a \nreluctance to collaborate for an agreement, and ongoing DLC distrust of OBH (which may be \nreasonable in light of more distant history).  We were concerned this may suggest a regression \nto a less collaborative and collegial tone, even after such significant progress and collaboration \nover the past year.  However, as of our late-June two-party meeting, the tone between the two \nparties remained constructive and collaborative.  In short, we were relieved that—even though \nthey failed to reach an agreement—both parties returned to the table with a constructive \napproach, remaining eager to collaborate for the good of class members.  Though concerned \nthat this lack of resolution may have created a setback, we are generally encouraged that much \nof the progress in collaboration seems to remain. \n \nRegarding broader updates in the era of the COVID pandemic, we see good news and bad news.  \nOur greatest concern is that waiting times for Tier 1 defendants (those who most urgently need \nhospitalization) have increased, and the Department is not consistently meeting the 7-day \n\nCase 1:11-cv-02285-NYW   Document 200   Filed 07/06/20   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 3\nPage 3 \n \ndeadlines that they had previously been meeting so consistently.  On the other hand, there has \nbeen tremendous (and greater-than-expected) progress in reducing the overall number of \npeople on the waitlist.  Indeed, the waitlist has reached record lows, and appears roughly half \nthe size it was before the COVID pandemic.  Apparently, the reduction in arrests and \nincarcerations caused by the pandemic has provided some relief in the pace of evaluation and \nrestoration orders.  The Department has used this opportunity to make progress in some ways, \neven if progress in other ways is limited by COVID-related safety precautions.  The most recent \nMonthly Compliance report (July 7, 2020) reports that the numbers of court orders for \ncompetency evaluations are on the rise, and that they will likely approach pre-COVID levels \nwithin the next month or so; if so, we anticipate that waitlist numbers will rise accordingly.  We \nwill provide much more detailed updates on their progress in our next Quarterly Report, due in \nlate August. \n \nWe will continue to work with the Department on these and related matters, and we \nencourage you to contact us with any questions or requests.  As always, we appreciate the \nopportunity to serve the court, and the state of Colorado, in these important efforts. \n \n \nNeil Gowensmith, Ph.D. \nPresident, Groundswell Services Inc.   \n \n \n \nDaniel Murrie, Ph.D. \n \n \n ",
