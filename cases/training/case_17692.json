    "summary": "<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, F-1 visas (colloquially \"student visas\") can be granted to international students who attend American universities. However, regulations on the granting of these visas limit the amount of online or distance learning the student can engage in. According to these regulations, an international student can engage in only one such class or three credits of that class per semester. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G).</p>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 made this regulation untenable, as schools and universities had to shift to online learning systems. In response, defendant ICE issued an exemption on March 13, 2020, affirming that international students would be permitted to continue distance learning in the United States under their F-1 visas. The exemption would apply until the end of the emergency. However, on July 6, 2020, ICE issued a new directive stating that it would rescind that exemption. This directive would then mean that international students at schools that would still be fully online would have to either transfer to other schools that were at least partially in-person, go back to their countries voluntarily, or risk deportation. The directive also ordered schools that had gone fully online or had simply decided not to have classes to submit an \"operational change plan\" within nine days, and ordered schools that would have a hybrid system to certify each F-1 student to make sure that they were not taking entirely online courses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Lawsuit</strong></p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on July 10, 2020, four days after the directive was issued. Plaintiffs were seven foreign nationals attending University of California schools at the post-graduate level. They were represented by Public Counsel and private attorneys. Defendants were the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs claimed that the new directive violated the Administrative Procedure Act in four ways: 1) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to consider reliance interests of F-1 and M-1 visa holders; 2) the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to offer a reasoned basis to justify the policy; 3) defendants did not engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking when coming up with the new policy; and 4) the directive violated the Fifth Amendment in that it stripped plaintiffs of their visas without due process of law. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the agencies from enforcing the new directive. Plaintiffs also requested that the court vacate and set aside the new directive, in addition to declaratory relief and attorney's fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney and Magistrate Judge Karen E. Scott.</p>\r\n<p>The students filed an application for a temporary restraining order on July 14.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same directive, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17677&amp;search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CHarvard%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>President and Fellows of Harvard College</em></a>, the parties conferred and the defendants agreed to rescind their implementation of the directive and to return to the March policy.</p>\r\n<p>On July 16, the parties filed a joint stipulation that stated the government agreed to rescind the July directive by removing it from its website and replacing it with the March guidance, which mooted the students original claims. However, in an amendment to the students' application for a temporary restraining order, they noted that despite the removal, the government failed to issue a formal statement of rescission or explanation and failed to issue a statement confirming that the March guidance would remain in effect for the duration of the emergency. They sought an order directing the government to administer the student visa program in accordance with the March guidance for the duration of the emergency.</p>\r\n<p>The government filed a motion to dismiss and opposition to the students' application for a temporary restraining order. On August 3, the court denied the students' application for a temporary restraining order because the rescission satisfied much of the relief demanded by plaintiffs. The court also denied the government's motion to dismiss, allowing the students to amend their complaint to clarify the relief they continued to seek.</p>\r\n<p>The students filed an amended complaint on August 14. The complaint reiterated their demands from the amended application for a temporary restraining order. They sought a declaration that the July 6 directive was improperly issued in violation of the APA and the plaintiffs' due process rights and a directive that the government administer the student visa program in accordance with the March guidance for the duration of the emergency. The government filed a motion to dismiss on August 28.</p>\r\n<p>The court found that the students' claims were moot and granted the government's motion to dismiss on October 1, 2020.</p>",

In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance, but the plaintiffs in this case filed an amended complaint that sought a formal declaration that the July 6 directive was improperly issued and an order that the government administer the student visa program in accordance with the March guidance for the duration of the emergency.

Less than one month after the Supreme Court held that the Executive \n3  Branch must “turn square corners” before taking an action that profoundly disrupts the \n4  lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals, the Executive Branch once again acted \n5  recklessly and inexplicably to disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands more. In \n6  March 2020, as the coronavirus public health emergency exploded, Immigration and \n7  Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), through its Student and Exchange Visitor Program \n8  (“SEVP”), issued Guidance documents (the “March Guidance”) assuring international \n9  students that, for “the duration of the [coronavirus] emergency,” they could continue \n10  their studies in the United States even if their colleges or universities were offering \n11  exclusively online classes due to the coronavirus pandemic. But then, on July 6, \n12  Defendants abruptly and without notice reversed course, and issued a new Guidance \n13  (the “July 6 Guidance”) requiring such students to leave the United States if, in light \n14  of the ongoing crisis, their schools continued with online-only instruction. After a \n15  public outcry and the filing of this action and others, Defendants announced their \n16  intent to rescind the July Guidance and subsequently issued new guidance allowing \n17  online-only instruction, but only for returning students and only for the fall 2020 \n18  semester – not for the duration of the emergency should it extend for the remainder of \n19  the academic year. Plaintiffs continue to be at risk that Defendants may, at any time, \n20  reinstate the July 6 Guidance, thus necessitating Plaintiffs’ continued pursuit of this \n21  action.  \n22  2.  The July 6 Guidance was a cruel and politically motivated directive that \n23  upended the lives of foreign students who are lawfully present in this country and who \n24  contribute immeasurably to the quality of education at the institutions they attend. \n25  These students chose to come to the United States to pursue degrees in law, medicine, \n26  engineering, and every other academic field. They wish to prepare themselves to lead \n27  productive lives that serve and build community wherever they ultimately settle. \n  3 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 4 of 39   Page ID #:379\n \n1  Access to our outstanding institutions of higher education is one of the greatest gifts \n2  that the United States gives the world, and that gift is repaid many times over by the \n3  contributions that foreign students make to the United States and to the world as a \n4  whole by virtue of the learning they receive. Those contributions reflect their \n5  intelligence, compassion, and hard work. \n6  3.  In the midst of the most dangerous pandemic of the last hundred years, \n7  universities have reshaped their educational models to ensure the quality, continuity \n8  and safety of their educational programs. Utilizing their educational expertise and \n9  recognizing their paramount responsibility to the safety of the university community \n10  and the community at large, leadership at these schools have reluctantly accepted the \n11  judgments of our nation’s leading public health experts and CDC guidelines and have \n12  instituted remote learning and teaching strategies and regimens. It should go without \n13  saying that these decisions have not been easy. But it should also be readily \n14  recognized that a university’s decision to go all or principally remote is one of life and \n15  death. Universities are doing their part to flatten the curve and repel the deadly \n16  coronavirus that thrives on crowded settings inside buildings, precisely the \n17  circumstances of normal classroom teaching and university life. And until July 6, \n18  universities were doing so in reasonable reliance on guidance that ICE itself had \n19  provided in March 2020, and that promised a flexible approach of allowing students to \n20  maintain their visas while schools attempted, in good faith and with timely notice to \n21  ICE, to provide the best educational opportunities possible while fulfilling \n22  indispensable obligations to preserve the health of their students and their \n23  communities.    \n24  4.  On July 6, ICE abruptly changed course 180 degrees, without explanation \n25  or even acknowledgement. Its decision sought to punish foreign students because their \n26  universities prioritized the health and safety of their academic and local communities \n27  and of the nation by choosing to hold remote classes beginning in the fall term. \n  4 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 5 of 39   Page ID #:380\n \n1  5.  The July 6 Guidance offered no explanation whatsoever for the complete \n2  reversal in policy. But the facts are that the President of the United States, beset by \n3  falling poll numbers in a fast closing election year, has tweeted repeatedly that CDC \n4  guidelines must be altered and schools must open in the fall no matter the incongruity \n5  with fundamental public health principles and the sound, on-the-ground knowledge \n6  and expertise of university officials as to the safest course for their students and \n7  community. Indeed, on the day that the ICE message was issued, he tweeted that \n8  “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!”1 The next day, Acting Deputy \n9  Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, responding to a question about the \n10  July 6 Guidance, explained the guidelines were “setting the rules . . . that will, again, \n11  encourage schools to reopen.”2 \n12  6.  ICE’s announcement concerning international students attending \n13  institutions that did not offer in-person instruction, or who were not able to take the \n14  in-person classes that were offered, is part and parcel of the President’s approach. \n15  These guidelines, which adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to higher education, are \n16  blunt. They did not reflect the intensely local nature of university decisions, nor did \n17  they make exceptions for students at heightened risk from the novel coronavirus. \n18  Instead, the guidelines were designed to force institutions of higher education to \n19  reopen for the fall term, no matter the cost.  \n20  7.  Institutions and students pushed back, and between July 8 and July 13 \n21  filed over a half dozen lawsuits in 18 states challenging and seeking to invalidate the \n22  July 6 Guidance. Under pressure, Defendants again abruptly changed course and \n23  announced during a July 14 court hearing in the United States District Court for the \n24  District of Massachusetts that they would be rescinding and not implementing the July \n                                           \n25 \n1 Donald J.

Additional guidance \n2  followed on July 24 (the “July 24 Guidance”) and again on August 7 (the “August 7 \n3  Guidance”) stating students who held F-1 visas as of March 2020 could remain in the \n4  United States for the fall 2020 semester if their schools offered only online courses.  \n5  8.  But the July 24 Guidance and the August 7 Guidance have not mooted \n6  this dispute. On their face, the July 24 Guidance and August 7 Guidance apply only to \n7  the “fall school term” and conspicuously do not commit to keeping the March \n8  Guidance in place for the duration of the coronavirus emergency, leaving students \n9  guessing about their status for the remainder of the academic year if their schools \n10  remain only online. Defendants have not stated when they will issue guidance for the \n11  next semester (which starts in January), what criteria they will use, or what process \n12  and notice will be provided in connection with any new rule. Moreover, they have \n13  failed to acknowledge either in this litigation, or in other litigation, or in any public \n14  forum, that their July 6 Guidance was an unlawful agency action that ignored the \n15  significant reliance interests of international students.  They have also failed to \n16  commit to concrete steps that would ensure that they do not again arbitrarily and \n17  capriciously reverse course this fall. \n18  9.  Defendants thus have conspicuously left themselves all the running room \n19  they need to violate the law again this fall should it suit the political whim of the \n20  moment.  There is no reason to believe that they will not, again without notice or \n21  explanation, abruptly revert to the July 6 Guidance this week, next week, or later in \n22  the fall 2020 semester. \n23  10.  Plaintiffs are serious students whose lives were needlessly and cruelly \n24  thrown into disarray by the July 6 Guidance.  They remain at risk that Defendants, \n25  without sufficient notice or regard for Plaintiffs’ health and reliance interests, will \n26  attempt to expel them again, even if the coronavirus emergency is still ongoing. \n27  Defendants’ conduct not only puts Plaintiffs at continuing risk of harm but is causing \n  6 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 7 of 39   Page ID #:382\n \n1  Plaintiffs harm right now, insofar as it is interfering with their ability to plan for the \n2  remainder of the academic year concerning their education, training programs, and \n3  their lives as a whole. \n4  11.  This lawsuit seeks a declaration that the July 6 Guidance was improperly \n5  issued in violation of the APA and Plaintiffs’ due process rights, and a directive that \n6  Defendants administer the SEVP in accordance with the March Guidance throughout \n7  the entire academic year and until such time as the coronavirus crisis abates, unless \n8  replaced by a properly-promulgated agency rule.  The government has nothing to lose \n9  by giving orderly respect to the APA and students’ basic due process rights; the \n10  foreign students, their universities and communities, and those who stand by the rule \n11  of law, have everything. \n12  PARTIES \n13  12.  Plaintiff Z.W. is a 25 year-old Chinese national entering his second year \n14  of study at University of California Irvine School of Law in Irvine, California (“UCI \n15  Law”). After learning about UCI Law’s remote learning transition, he entered into a \n16  13-month lease for an apartment in Irvine with monthly rent of $1,730 and security \n17  deposit. He entered into the lease with the expectation that he would be able to \n18  continue his education through distanced, remote learning. Z.W. was preparing to \n19  apply for a CPT visa so he could intern over the next, 2L summer to further his legal \n20  education.  Similar to all plaintiffs who are Chinese nationals, he is deeply concerned \n21  with the financial costs associated with returning to China. He has paid a deposit for \n22  his apartment out of pocket, and does not know how he will manage to pay for a \n23  return flight to China, or the associated costs of China’s current mandatory 14-day \n24  quarantine. His education will also be essentially prematurely terminated or paused, \n25  because of China’s prohibition on Google and VPN use, in addition to the 12- hour \n26  time difference.  \n27 \n  7 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 8 of 39   Page ID #:383\n \n1  13.  Plaintiff C.Y. is a 27 year-old Chinese national entering her second year \n2  of law school at UCI Law. She currently lives in Irvine, California where she moved \n3  in 2019 to enroll in her first year of law school. When UCI Law switched to online \n4  classes in March 2020 and Defendants issued the March 13 Guidance, C.Y. believed \n5  she would be able to continue her studies in the United States for the 2020-21 \n6  academic year regardless of how UCI Law choose to offer classes in the fall. So she \n7  leased on-campus housing through spring 2021, and pre-paid rent at a total cost of \n8  $10,380. If she were to have to return to China at any point in this academic year, she \n9  would not be able to recover that rent. Additionally, it would be prohibitively \n10  expensive for C.Y. to return to China, as the price of airline ticket from Los Angeles \n11  to China has increased several fold since the start of the pandemic and could easily \n12  exceed $10,000. Her family cannot afford to pay the price of her plan ticket back to \n13  China, nor can she. It will also be cost-prohibitive to pay for the hotel room in which \n14  she would currently be required to self-quarantine for 14 days after returning to China. \n15  If she were forced to return to China, C. Y. also fears she will be exposed to the novel \n16  coronavirus on the flight to China and become infected, as she heard happened to \n17  more than a dozen people on a recent international flight to China. Once in China, \n18  C.Y. would not be able to continue to take law school classes due to, among other \n19  things, the unavailability in China of tools that UCI Law uses to facilitate online \n20  learning, including Google products (e.g., Google Drive) and secure VPNs. \n21  Additionally, the 15 to 16 hour time change would make it practically impossible for \n22  her to engage in clinical programs in which she has enrolled and to engage in \n23  important conferences with fellow students and professors. C.Y. does not feel safe \n24  attending in-person classes due to the health risks and therefore planned to take all of \n25  her courses online in the fall. The prospect of making C.Y. choose between a \n26  potentially unsafe in-person class and a prohibitively costly emergency journey home \n27 \n  8 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 9 of 39   Page ID #:384\n \n1  is causing her severe distress, which she will worries will negatively impact her \n2  grades. \n3  14.  Plaintiff X.Y. is a 25-year-old Chinese national who has attended UCI \n4  Law on an F-1 visa since 2018 and this fall, will be entering her third and final year at \n5  UCI Law. In reliance upon the SVEP’s March guidance and UCI’s June statements \n6  that the fall semester would be held remotely, X.Y. and her partner, a UCLA student, \n7  entered into a 12-month lease for an apartment in Los Angeles. She also cancelled an \n8  August trip to visit family at home in China because she anticipated complications, \n9  including travel difficulties and the possibility of not being able to return to the United \n10  States to finish her program, resulting from the pandemic. She thought it was safer to \n11  stay in place.  X.Y. is deeply concerned about the prospect of travel at a time of \n12  increased risk of community transmission both nationally in the United States and \n13  locally in Los Angeles. Her healthcare plan is effective through UCI enrollment, so \n14  she doesn’t know if she would have healthcare coverage in China.  X.Y. is concerned \n15  she will have to drop out of school if she is forced to return to China, because \n16  attending live-streamed classes would mean that X.Y. would need to attend school in \n17  the middle of the night, and she would have no way to obtain required casebooks. The \n18  process of applying for a permanent work visa from China, rather than while in the \n19  U.S. as she had planned, will be considerably more difficult, too.    \n20  15.  Plaintiff A.G. is a 25-year-old German national who has been attending \n21  the University of Southern California Law School (“USC Law”) in Los Angeles, \n22  California, on an F-1 visa, will be entering her third and final year. She lives in Los \n23  Angeles, where she is responsible for a lease and is employed through the summer by \n24  a law firm. Her responsibilities in the United States include being the sole familial \n25  caretaker for her almost 90 year-old great aunt who lives in Los Angeles. A.G. drives \n26  her to doctor’s appointments and goes grocery shopping for her. A.G. is nervous about \n27  the prospect of having to fly if she were forced to return to Germany, where she would \n  9 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 10 of 39   Page ID #:385\n \n1  need to live with her immediate family. She fears that the return flight will expose her \n2  to the novel coronavirus and then put her family members at risk because of their high \n3  risk for COVID-19 complications. Her father has four stents in his heart and her \n4  mother has high blood pressure. She herself has no known pre-existing conditions, but \n5  she would be unable to take advantage of her U.S. health insurance in Germany. If \n6  forced to return to Germany, A.G. would have difficulties continuing her studies, as \n7  she would need to take her classes in the middle of the night, due to the nine-hour time \n8  difference, and textbooks may be difficult to obtain. If USC Law were to transition to \n9  hybrid instruction, A.G. would not feel safe attending in-person classes. \n10  16.  Plaintiff M.X. is a 26-year-old Chinese national entering her second year \n11  of study at UCI Law. Because of the exemption granted by ICE, and UCI’s June \n12  announcement of remote instruction in the fall, M.X. decided to plan for the upcoming \n13  year by renewing her on-campus lease for a year, and has been paying rent under the \n14  lease for several months. M.X. planned to continue her studies in the United States, \n15  and planned to intern in the summer of 2021. In order to do so, she would need a CPT \n16  visa. Her eligibility for the CPT visa, however, will be foreclosed if her F-1 visa is \n17  terminated. She faces the additional financial burden of extremely expensive return \n18  flights to China and expenses associated with China’s current mandatory 14-day \n19  quarantine. M.X. does not have the financial means to pay these required costs out of \n20  pocket on such short notice. Similarly, it would be effectively impossible for her to \n21  continue her studies while in China, due to the time difference and restrictions against \n22  Google and VPN use, meaning she would not be able to attend or participate in school \n23  even if the time zone were not an issue. If UCI were to offer in-person or hybrid \n24  learning, M.X. would be reluctant to attend classes due to concerns about the risk of \n25  infection in a classroom requiring physical attendance. \n26  17.  Plaintiff Z.L. is a 25 year-old Chinese national who lives in Los Angeles \n27  and is enrolled as a PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles (“UCLA”), \n  10 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 11 of 39   Page ID #:386\n \n1  focusing on cinema and media studies. She enrolled at UCLA in 2017 and holds an F-\n2  1 visa. After UCLA switched to online operations in late March, Z.L. remained in the \n3  United States because she did not want to risk her or her parents’ health and safety by \n4  traveling to China during a pandemic. She worries about returning to China because \n5  traveling will place her at risk of contracting COVID-19, as she will be exposed to \n6  people who may be infected with the virus at airports and inside the plane. If she were \n7  forced to return to China, Z.L. would not be able to continue her studies for several \n8  reasons. For instance, due to the 15-hour time difference between Los Angeles and \n9  China, Z.L. will have to attend her online classes at unconventional times. For \n10  example, Z.L. will have to call into a 1 p.m. Monday class at 4 a.m. on Tuesday, \n11  Beijing time. Watching recorded classes is not an option for her because graduate-\n12  level courses are designed to be centered around conversations and dialogue with \n13  other students than lecture. Relying on class recordings would deprive her of \n14  important opportunities to learn from and with her peers. Z.L. is concerned that taking \n15  in-person classes will jeopardize her health, and has been planning to take all of her \n16  fall 2020 courses online and, if necessary, do the same for the remainder of the \n17  academic year. In China, Z.L. will not be able to access the print and digital media \n18  resources she needs to complete her dissertation, and strict quarantine requirements \n19  will likely impair her ability to study for her PhD qualifying exam. Failure of the \n20  exam could jeopardize the funding she needs to complete the years-long program she \n21  has undertaken. Z.L.’s housing situation is unsettled and if she returns to China she \n22  will have to pay costs of storage for her belongings and car. Not knowing whether she \n23  may have to leave the country on short notice or risk serious illness—or even death—\n24  by attending in-person classes is keeping Z.L. tense and causing her great distress. \n25  18.  Plaintiff W.R. is a 26-year-old Chinese national entering his second year \n26  of school at UCI Law School who currently lives near Irvine, California in San Juan \n27  Capistrano. Several months ago in March, UCI Law announced its decision to conduct \n  11 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 12 of 39   Page ID #:387\n \n1  remote instruction. Around that same time, W.R. received an exemption from ICE to \n2  remain in the United States with his wife, who is a permanent resident alien living in \n3  San Juan Capistrano and owns a business in the United States. If he is forced to return \n4  to China, he will be separated from his wife. He will also suffer financial losses based \n5  on decisions made in reliance on his ability to stay in the United States for his studies. \n6  If he is required to return to China, W.R.’s financial burden will also be compounded \n7  by the high cost of travel to China in the era of COVID-19, with average one-way \n8  economy flights priced at close to $10,000 (more than eight times the cost of a single \n9  flight to China before the pandemic). Additionally, passengers arriving from outside \n10  China currently are financially responsible for room and board associated with \n11  China’s mandatory 14-day quarantine, which would also be a financial hardship for \n12  W.R. If he is required to return to China, W.R.’s legal education will not be able to \n13  continue for all practical purposes. He will not be able to participate in classes, \n14  important group, or conduct necessary research due to the 15 to 16 hour time zone \n15  difference and China’s strict ban against Google and VPN usage, both of which are \n16  required to access the research databases and at UCI Law. W.R. will also be unable to \n17  benefit from the student legal clinic in which he is enrolled for the upcoming school \n18  year if he has to return to China. If he is required to attend in-person instruction, W.R. \n19  is concerned for his health and safety due to threat of exposure to the novel \n20  coronavirus. \n21  19.  Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security is a federal \n22  agency of the United States. \n23  20.  Defendant United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a \n24  division of the United States Department of Homeland Security. \n25  21.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is the Acting Secretary of the United States \n26  Department of Homeland Security. He is sued in his official capacity. \n27 \n  12 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 13 of 39   Page ID #:388\n \n1  22.  Defendant Matthew Albence is the Acting Director of the United States \n2  Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n3  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4  23.  This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n5  and 5 U.S.C. § 702. Plaintiffs are persons aggrieved by a final agency action \n6  promulgated by Defendants. See 5 U.S.C. § 702. Plaintiffs bring this suit for \n7  declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside Defendants’ action as contrary to law and \n8  arbitrary and capricious, see id. §§ 705–706, and as a violation of due process under \n9  the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution—thus presenting a federal \n10  question, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n11  24.  Venue is proper in this Court because Plaintiffs reside in this District—\n12  specifically, a majority attend UCI and reside in or near Irvine—and no real property \n13  is involved. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C). \n14  25.  Plaintiffs have standing to bring this case. Defendants’ actions will cause \n15  an imminent, concrete, and irreparable risk of harm to Plaintiffs, their families, their \n16  educations, their short-term and long-term health, and their future education and \n17  employment prospects unless halted by this Court. \n18  26.  This Court is authorized to grant the requested injunctive relief pursuant \n19  to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n20  FACTS \n21  Higher Education and the COVID-19 Pandemic \n22  27.  The world is in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic.  \n23  28.  Because humans lack built-up immunity to, or a vaccine against or \n24  effective treatment for, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, the only \n25  way to mitigate the effects of the virus today is to stop its spread. \n26  29.  State and local governments have responded to the pandemic with \n27  unprecedented containment measures such as stay-at-home orders that instructed state \n  13 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 14 of 39   Page ID #:389\n \n1  residents to avoid leaving their residences. At one point, 42 states instituted such \n2  orders.3 \n3  30.  On March 4, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state \n4  of emergency in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.4 \n5  31.  On March 9, the University of California at Berkeley suspended in-\n6  person instruction.5 \n7  32.  On March 10, the University of California campuses at Davis, Irvine, Los \n8  Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara followed suit, as did the University of Southern \n9  California.6 \n10  33.  On March 19, Governor Newsom announced a statewide stay-at-home \n11  order.7 Among other things, this order forbade universities from continuing to operate \n12  in-person classes, including the schools Plaintiffs attend. \n13  34.  While the order has been amended to loosen restrictions, the order could \n14  be tightened again at any time.  \n15  35.  COVID-19 infections are continuing to plague much of the country and \n16  California in particular. Nationwide, over five million COVID-19 cases have been \n17  diagnosed, and more than 165,000 people have died.8  \n18  36.  Both in California and nationwide, the COVID-19 pandemic is worse \n19  than at any point during the spring academic semester. \n20  37.  In recognition of the continuing threat COVID-19 posed to its students, \n21  staff, and faculty, on June 23, the University of California, Irvine School of Law \n22  (“UCI Law”) announced that all second- and third-year law students would only be \n23                                             \n3 Jasmine C.

Likewise, on June 26, the University California at Berkeley Law School \n4  (“Berkeley Law”) announced that it would conduct the fall 2020 term entirely \n5  online.10 Berkeley Law determined that restrictions on the number of students in a \n6  classroom and the requirement that classrooms be disinfected between classes would \n7  make offering safe, in-person instruction infeasible. Online orientation for new \n8  students has already taken place, and the fall semester is scheduled to commence on \n9  Monday, August 17.  \n10  39.  Schools in the University of California system are not alone in moving \n11  some or all students fully online in the fall semester. More than 150 schools will now \n12  offer exclusively online instruction to all students, including Harvard University,11 \n13  Princeton University, the University of Southern California,12 and the University of \n14  Santa Clara, and over 700 other schools are offering most classes online.13  As of \n15  August 7, over 700 schools have yet to announce their reopening plans.   \n16  40.  Schools are right to be cautious. Public health leaders believe the United \n17  States is still contending with the first wave of coronavirus infections,14 and there is \n18  widespread concern that re-opening college campuses will cause the virus to spread \n19  and endanger the lives of staff, faculty, students, and those who live in surrounding \n20  communities.15 Indeed, the Pac-12 and Big 10 college athletic conferences recently \n21  decided to postpone their 2020 fall seasons for football and other fall sports due to \n22  concerns about student-athletes’ safety.  \n23 \n                                           \n24  9 https://www.law.uci.edu/news/press-releases/2020/fall-2020-semester-planning-update-06232020.pdf \n10 https://www.law.berkeley.edu/article/fall-instruction-memo-6-26-20/ \n25  11 https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/07/06/all-harvard-university-students-will-take-online-classes-this-fall-amid- \ncoronavirus/ \n12 https://coronavirus.usc.edu/2020/07/01/7-1-letter-on-student-housing-and-course-schedules/ \n26 \n13 https://collegecrisis.shinyapps.io/dashboard/ (last accessed on Aug. 14, 2020) \n14 https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/first-and-second-waves-of-coronavirus \n27 \n15 See, e.g., https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/cancel-college/615064/. \n  15 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 16 of 39   Page ID #:391\n \n1  41.   Forecasts of continued virus spread through the winter coupled with \n2  stringent state guidelines for reopening colleges and universities cast doubt on the \n3  viability or likelihood that schools will be able to legally or safely offer in-person \n4  classes after the conclusion of the fall 2020 term. For example, under August 7, 2020 \n5  draft guidance issued by the State of California, colleges and universities will not be \n6  permitted to resume in-person classes unless local epidemiologic conditions meet \n7  certain thresholds, testing resources are available and public health capacity exists to \n8  respond to outbreaks, and the schools are able to implement extensive (and expensive) \n9  social distancing and virus prevention protocols.16     \n10  The F-1 Student Visa Program \n11  42.  The United States has labeled students as “non-immigrants” and operated \n12  a student visa program since at least 1921.17 Although the F-1 program has changed \n13  over the years, millions of students have entered the country with F-1 visas since at \n14  least 2000, as far back as public records are available.18 \n15  43.  For the fall 2019 term, there were 44,485 international students in the \n16  University of California (“UC”) system. 27,189 of those were undergraduate students, \n17  and 17,295 were graduate students.19 \n18  44.  According to a report published by ICE, the total number of Student and \n19  Exchange Visitor Information System (“SEVIS”) records for active F-1 and M-1 \n20  students was 1,551,373 in the calendar year 2018. Asia remains the number-one \n21  continent of origin for nonimmigrant students, with 1,165,483 student records. China \n22  (478,732), India (251,290), and South Korea (88,867) sent the largest numbers of \n23  students in both calendar years 2017 and 2018.20 \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n16 https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-higher-education--en.pdf \n26  17 https://web.archive.org/web/20140205165423/http://www.iie.org/Who-We-Are/History \n18 https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html \n19 https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance \n27 \n20 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/sevisByTheNumbers2018.pdf \n  16 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 17 of 39   Page ID #:392\n \n1  45.  There were 145,564 Optional Practical Training (“OPT”) students in the \n2  calendar year 2018, including 69,650 science, technology, engineering, and \n3  mathematics OPT students.21 There were 151,525 curricular practical training \n4  (“CPT”) students who reported working for an employer in the calendar year 2018, a \n5  14-percent increase since 2017.22 \n6  46.  In 2018, California hosted 302,073 nonimmigrant students, 19.5 percent \n7  of all nonimmigrant students in the United States, and more than any other state.23 \n8  Defendants’ Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \n9  47.  On March 9, 2020, ICE’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program \n10  (“SEVP”) issued a Broadcast Message providing guidance on COVID-19 and its \n11  implications for nonimmigrant F and M students (“March 9 Guidance”). In this \n12  guidance, Defendants recognized that “SEVP-certified schools may need to adapt \n13  their procedures and policies to address the significant public health concerns \n14  associated with the COVID-19 crisis.” Defendants provided schools with a template \n15  that schools could use to report those changes to SEVP. Defendants assured schools \n16  and students, however, both that “SEVP is focused on ensuring that nonimmigrant \n17  students are able to continue to make normal progress in a full course of study as \n18  required by federal regulations,” and that “SEVP intends to be flexible with temporary \n19  adaptations.” Defendants further recognize[d] that the COVID-19 crisis is fluid and \n20  rapidly changing” and “[f]or that reason” assured schools that it was “leaving room \n21  for schools to comply with state or local health emergency declarations.”    \n22  48.  On March 13, 2020, President Donald J. Trump declared that COVID-19 \n23  had created a national emergency.24 This emergency is ongoing. \n24 \n                                           \n25 \n21 Id. \n26  22 Id. \n23 Id. \n24 https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency- concerning-novel-\n27 \ncoronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak  \n  17 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 18 of 39   Page ID #:393\n \n1  49.  On March 13, 2020, as governors across the country began to sign stay-\n2  at-home orders and many institutions of higher education began to switch to remote-\n3  teaching options, the Defendants issued a follow-up to the March 9 Guidance (“March \n4  13 Guidance”) addressing “inquiries” that SEVP had received about various “different \n5  scenarios” a school or student might face, and instructing schools and students how \n6  the transition to online classes would affect nonimmigrant students’ visa status.25 \n7  50.  The March 13 Guidance presented students with three scenarios they \n8  might face: a complete school shutdown, a switch to online learning while the student \n9  remained in the United States, and a switch to online learning while the student moved \n10  outside of the United States.26 In all three scenarios, Defendants assured students that \n11  they would be able to remain in compliance with the terms of their visas. \n12  51.  Defendants assured students and schools that it would treat school \n13  shutdowns the same way it treated “short-term breaks in the school calendar.” \n14  International students would remain eligible for their visas if they “intend[ed] to \n15  resume their course of study when classes resume.”27 \n16  52.  For institutions that switched to online education, and “[g]iven the \n17  extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 emergency,” Defendants waived the limits for \n18  online courses laid out in 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 214.2(m)(9)(v). \n19  Defendants waived these limits for both international students who remained in the \n20  United States and those who chose to travel abroad during the period of online \n21  instruction.28 Defendants explained that these waivers would remain in place for “the \n22  duration of the [COVID-19] emergency . . . .” \n23  53.  At the end of the March 13 Guidance, Defendants noted that “[d]ue to \n24  “the fluid nature of this difficult situation, this guidance may be subject to change.” \n25 \n                                           \n26  25 https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2020/Coronavirus%20Guidance_3.13.20.pdf \n26 Id. \n27 Id. \n27 \n28 Id. \n  18 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 19 of 39   Page ID #:394\n \n1  Nowhere in the March 13 Guidance, however, did Defendants suggest or even hint \n2  that they intended to change the values that underlay the March 9 and March 13 \n3  guidance (together, the “March Guidance”), such as to abandon the “focus” they had \n4  announced, just six days before, on “ensuring that nonimmigrant students are able to \n5  continue to make normal progress in a full course of study.” March 9 Guidance. \n6  Similarly, nowhere in the March 13 Guidance did Defendants suggest or hint that they \n7  no longer “intend[ed] to be flexible with temporary adaptations” or would deny \n8  schools “room … to comply with state or local health emergency declarations.” March \n9  9 Guidance. To the contrary, Defendants made clear that they planned to monitor \n10  factual changes in the COVID-19 situation: “SEVP will continue to monitor the \n11  COVID-19 situation and will adjust its guidance as needed.”   \n12  54.  On March 20, 2020, ICE posted links to the March 9 and March 13 \n13  guidance documents on its website together with some sample Questions and Answers \n14  geared to be helpful to students. One such Q and A read:  \n15  “Can nonimmigrant students participate in online classes?  \n16  “SEVP is committed to remaining flexible in allowing schools to make temporary \n17  procedural adaptations so nonimmigrant students can continue to make normal \n18  forward progress in their program of study. They can temporarily engage in distance-\n19  learning, either from within the U.S. or outside the country, in light of COVID-19. \n20  SEVP will provide updated guidance as additional information concerning the scope \n21  and length of this situation becomes clearer.” (Emphasis added.) \n22  55.  For the four months following the release of the March 9 and March 13 \n23  Guidance, students and schools engaged in extensive efforts to plan for the fall \n24  academic year, trusting that Defendants’ March Guidance, as reiterated in the other \n25  communications, accurately reflected the approach that Defendants would take to the \n26  visa status of international students during the COVID-19 emergency.   \n27 \n  19 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 20 of 39   Page ID #:395\n \n1  56.  The nation’s COVID-19 emergency has continued. President Trump has \n2  not withdrawn the declaration of a national state of emergency. In California, COVID-\n3  19 infection and death rates have only climbed since the March Guidance was issued.  \n4  57.  Yet on July 6, 2020, Defendants suddenly and without notice announced \n5  a rollback of the exemptions put in place in the March Guidance.29 This was done \n6  despite the fact that the nation was still in the midst of the emergency, with COVID-\n7  19 infection and death rates exceeding their March levels in many states, including in \n8  California.  \n9  58.  These guidelines (“July 6 Guidance”) required students whose \n10  institutions choose to conduct the fall 2020 term entirely online to exit the United \n11  States. The announcement stated that: \n12 \nNonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating \nentirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the \n13 \nUnited States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to \n14 \nstudents enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for \nthe fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit \n15 \nthese students to enter the United States. Active students currently in \n16 \nthe United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or \ntake other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person \n17 \ninstruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face \n18 \nimmigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation \n19  of removal proceedings.30 \n20  59.  The July 6 Guidance also made clear that students whose in-person \n21  classes were switched online partway through the term would be required to leave the \n22  United States: \n23 \nSchools should update their information in the Student and Exchange \n24  Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the change if \nthey begin the fall semester with in-person classes but are later \n25 \n                                           \n26 \n29 https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online- \ncourses-during \n27 \n30 Id. \n  20 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 21 of 39   Page ID #:396\n \nrequired to switch to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student \n1 \nchanges their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an \n2  entirely online course load. Nonimmigrant students within the United \nStates are not permitted to take a full course of study through online \n3 \nclasses. If students find themselves in this situation, they must leave \n4  the country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant \nstatus such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave.31  \n5 \n6 \n60.  The July 6 Guidance further barred students whose institutions have gone \n7 \neither hybrid or in-person from taking a fully online curriculum: \n8 \nThese schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, \n9  “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” certifying \nthat the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an \n10 \nentirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking \n11  the minimum number of online classes required to make normal \nprogress in their degree program.  \n12 \n13 \n61.  Nowhere in the July 6 Guidance did Defendants state that the COVID-19 \n14 \nemergency had ended (it had not), whether as a formal or a factual matter. Indeed, the \n15 \nJuly 6 Guidance was entirely silent on “the COVID-19 situation” that Defendants had \n16 \nearlier said they were planning to monitor and would make the basis of any change in \n17 \nguidance.    \n18 \n62.  Nowhere in the July 6 Guidance did Defendants acknowledge their prior \n19 \ncommitment, in the March 9 Guidance, to allow international students “to make \n20 \nnormal progress in a full course of study,” “to be flexible with temporary \n21 \nadaptations,” or allow schools “room … to comply with state or local health \n22 \nemergency declarations.” \n23 \n63.  Nowhere in the July 6 Guidance did Defendants give any consideration \n24 \nto the reliance that international students and schools may have placed, in making \n25 \ntheir respective plans for the coming academic year, on the March 9 and March 13 \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n31 Id. \n  21 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 22 of 39   Page ID #:397\n \n1  guidance documents, on the nation’s longstanding commitment to the F-1 Visa \n2  program, and on the expectation that any changes Defendants would announce to the \n3  March 9 and 13 Guidance would reflect a good-faith assessment of materially changed \n4  circumstances in light of the values expressed in those documents. \n5  64.  The July 6 Guidance thus reflected a complete but unacknowledged \n6  repudiation of the approach Defendants laid out on March 9 and March 13 to \n7  addressing the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for holders F-1 and M-1 \n8  visas.      \n9  65.  The July 6 Guidance also failed to address numerous important issues \n10  that any reasoned decision maker would consider. For example, the July 6 Guidance \n11  did not include an exception for students who cannot attend classes because they are at \n12  an elevated risk to COVID-19 due to pre-existing health conditions, nor did it contain \n13  an exception for students living with family members or roommates who are at an \n14  elevated risk to COVID-19. \n15  66.  The July 6 Guidance also failed to  include an exception for students who \n16  are forced into online classes because the state institutes a stay-at-home order that \n17  shuts down their educational institution. \n18  67.  The July 6 Guidance also did not include an exception for students who \n19  cannot access the internet in their country of origin, for students who cannot safely \n20  travel or who cannot travel at all to their country of origin, or for students who fear \n21  suffering injury or death if they return to their country of origin. \n22  68.  In summary, the July 6  Guidance completely abandoned, without \n23  explanation, both the substantive guidance Defendants provided on March 9 and \n24  March 13 and the approach Defendants announced they would take to considering any \n25  changes to that guidance. The July 6 Guidance also ignored the public-health-\n26  informed decisions of schools and government officials to limit or cease in-person \n27  teaching. It did not include a safety valve for even the worst coronavirus outbreaks. It \n  22 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 23 of 39   Page ID #:398\n \n1  did not allow for any of the flexibility necessary to safely manage an increasingly \n2  dangerous pandemic. The July 6 Guidance did nothing but mandate the expulsion of \n3  students from the United States because of circumstances outside of the students’ \n4  control, no matter the consequences for the students, the schools, or the country.   \n5  69.  When issuing the July 6 Guidance, the Defendants did not provide an \n6  explanation for their departure from the March 9 and March 13 guidance documents.  \n7  But on July 7, Ken Cuccinelli, the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the \n8  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and the Senior Official Performing \n9  the Duties of the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \n10  (“USCIS”), made clear his views about students enrolled in online courses, or enrolled \n11  at institutions offering only online courses. “There isn’t a reason for a person holding \n12  a student visa to be present in the country . . . they don’t have a basis to be here. . . . I \n13  don’t frankly follow why a student visa holder would be here if their school isn’t \n14  functioning.”32 \n15  70.  On July 6, at 2:40 p.m. Eastern Time, President Donald Trump tweeted \n16  his support for the opening of schools by stating, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE \n17  FALL!!!”33 \n18  71.  President Trump continued to pressure other institutions beyond \n19  universities to open in the fall by threatening to cut funding otherwise.34 \n20  72.  At 4:11 p.m., he accused the Democratic Party and the presidential \n21  candidate Joe Biden of supporting closure of schools for political reasons and not \n22  health reasons.35 \n23   \n24   \n                                           \n25 \n32 https://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-ken-cuccinelli-and-cnns-brianna-keilar-battle-in-absurd-20-minute-debate-on- \n26  immigration-covid-and-confederate-flags/ \n33 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280209946085339136 \n34 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html \n27 \n35 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280232979781111808 \n  23 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 24 of 39   Page ID #:399\n \n1  In Response to Lawsuits, Defendants Suddenly Change Course For Fall 2020 \n2  73.  Soon after the July 6 Guidance was issued, students and universities and \n3  states attorneys general filed over a half-dozen lawsuits in 18 states to challenge the \n4  legality of the July 6 Guidance, including this lawsuit brought on behalf of seven \n5  student Plaintiffs.   \n6  74.  As the cases progressed and TROs were being sought, Defendants again \n7  abruptly changed the rules for international students. During a court hearing in the \n8  United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 14, counsel for \n9  Defendants suddenly announced they would rescind the July 6 Guidance and its \n10  implementation.   \n11  75.  Although the announcement impacted the lives of hundreds of thousands \n12  of international students, Defendants did not accompany it with a formal statement of \n13  rescission or any express acknowledgement that the July 6 Guidance was both \n14  unlawful and legally indefensible. Defendants also declined to issue any explanation \n15  or offer any principled basis for their abrupt reversal.  Defendants even refused to \n16  confirm that the March Guidance would remain in effect for the duration of the \n17  coronavirus emergency.  \n18  76.  Instead, on the next day (July 15), ICE deleted from its website the July 6 \n19  Broadcast Message from the “Guidance Documents” and a related July 7 FAQ from \n20  the “Frequently Asked Questions” sections of the site. But Defendants did not \n21  disseminate any other information about the policy change to students through any \n22  official channels. Visitors to the ICE website hoping to find out more, for example, \n23  still saw a press release dated July 6 describing the July 6 Guidance, even though the \n24  lengthy documents describing that guidance had been removed.      \n25  77.  It wasn’t until July 24 that Defendants finally informed students and \n26  schools in any detail about the changed policy. In a Broadcast Message accompanied \n27  by FAQs and a press release (together, the “July 24 Guidance”), Defendants clarified \n  24 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 25 of 39   Page ID #:400\n \n1  that for the fall 2020 semester, “active nonimmigrant students” may remain in the U.S. \n2  to engage in a full course of study if their school offers only online instruction. \n3  However, the same policy would not apply to students outside of the country who \n4  were not enrolled in a program of study as of March 9, 2020 and whose schools were \n5  offering only online classes.36 The July 24 Guidance says nothing about what students \n6  can expect to happen for the balance of the academic year (e.g., semesters or quarters \n7  beginning in January 2021), should their schools offer only online classes.   \n8  78.  On August 7, 2020, Defendants issued another FAQ, “Frequently Asked \n9  Questions for SEVP Stakeholders about COVID-19, Last Updated: Aug. 7, 2020,” \n10  (the “August 7 Guidance”) which incorporated the July 24 Guidance for fall 2020. \n11  The August 7 Guidance also announced the “rescission” of answers to a handful \n12  questions that appeared in the July 6 Guidance.  However, none of the rescinded \n13  answers addressed the gravamen of the July 6 Guidance: whether F-1 visa holders \n14  could remain in the U.S. if their schools did not offer in-person classes.37  The August \n15  7 Guidance also failed to address students’ fates for the balance of the academic year.  \n16  Instead of offering assurances that the March Guidance would remain the policy \n17  during the pandemic, the August 7 Guidance conceded explicitly that it is “subject to \n18  change.”  \n19  79.  In short, nothing prevents Defendants from abandoning the August 7 \n20  Guidance on a whim. By failing to acknowledge that the July 6 Guidance was \n21  unlawful, to formally rescind the July 6 Guidance, or to make any express \n22  commitment (let alone a binding one) to keep the March Guidance in place for the \n23  duration of the pandemic emergency, Defendants have kept the door open to \n24  reinstating the July 6 Guidance at any time and for any reason. \n25 \n26 \n                                           \n36 See https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcmFall2020guidance.pdf. \n27 \n37 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/coronavirus/covid19faq.pdf. \n  25 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 26 of 39   Page ID #:401\n \n1  The Impact of Uncertainty About the Academic Year on International Students \n2  80.  Plaintiffs attend schools that are offering only online classes to all \n3  students, or at least to all international students on F-1 visas.  \n4  81.  Based on the Defendants’ guidance in March 2020 confirming they could \n5  remain in the U.S. to continue their studies online “throughout the duration of the \n6  emergency,” Plaintiffs secured housing and made other advance commitments for the \n7  2020-21 academic year.    \n8  82.   Plaintiffs have no assurances, however, that Defendants will allow them \n9  to remain in the U.S. for the remainder of the academic year -- or even through the fall \n10  2020 semester.  If they are forced to leave the country at the conclusion of the fall \n11  2020 semester, or even before that time should Defendants abruptly change the rules \n12  without warning or valid explanation yet again, Plaintiffs will be ripped from their \n13  communities and their academic programs. Their carefully-laid financial, health, \n14  employment, immigration, and personal plans -- made under the assumption that \n15  Defendants would not revoke the March Guidance for the “duration of the \n16  emergency” -- will be upended. \n17 \nHousing \n18 \n83.  Some Plaintiffs have signed leases and acquired housing under the \n19 \nassumption that they would be present in the United States for the academic year. If \n20 \nthese Plaintiffs are forced to leave the United States during the academic year, they \n21 \nwill either have to break their leases and lose their security deposits, which would \n22 \nresult in a loss to their credit score, or lose money by continuing to pay rent until the \n23 \nend of the lease term. \n24 \n84.  Plaintiffs will likewise have to procure housing in their country of origin. \n25 \nWhile some Plaintiffs may be able to live with family, others have no safety net in that \n26 \n27 \n  26 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 27 of 39   Page ID #:402\n \n1  country, and will be forced to find housing with adequate internet connections and \n2  access to study space with little notice, perhaps before they leave the United States. \n3  85.  When some Plaintiffs relocated to the United States to enter their \n4  respective academic programs, they brought all of their belongings and livelihoods. \n5  Because they justifiably expected to remain in the United States for years of \n6  education, they did not build a safety net in their countries of origin. They terminated \n7  their housing, sold their furniture, and gave away the belongings that they could not \n8  bring with them to the United States. These Plaintiffs do not have a ready-made home \n9  in their respective home countries. \nTravel \n10 \n86.  The COVID-19 pandemic affects countries worldwide. Multiple \n11 \ncountries have shut down their borders and banned all transnational flights. Others \n12 \nhave specifically barred flights from the United States. If Plaintiffs are forced to \n13 \nsuddenly leave the country without adequate warning, they may not be able to find \n14 \nflights back to their home countries. \n15 \n87.  Even if each Plaintiff is able to find a flight itinerary that will eventually \n16 \ntake her home, the limited availability of international flights will mean that their \n17 \nitineraries will likely include multiple stops over different continents. \n18 \n88.  Multi-city itineraries are not simply inconvenient. They pose health risks. \n19 \nAs an airline passenger, the Plaintiff would spend hours in a confined space \n20 \nsurrounded by shared surfaces - exactly the kind of prolonged exposure that creates \n21 \nsubstantial risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. This is in addition to the added \n22 \nrisks associated with airports, whether it be standing in security lines or waiting at the \n23 \ngate to board an aircraft.   \n24 \n89.  Such an itinerary is also exorbitantly, perhaps prohibitively, expensive. \n25 \nAs noted above, airfare may exceed $10,000 – especially given the need to book on \n26 \nshort notice. In addition, for students returning to countries, such as China, that have \n27 \n  27 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 28 of 39   Page ID #:403\n \n1  imposed a quarantine on incoming travelers, the students would have to pay for 14 \n2  days’ lodging while they quarantine. \n3  90.  The financial and logistical challenges that Plaintiffs face multiply for \n4  international students with dependents. \n5  Health Risks \n6  91.  Forcing students to return to their countries of origin does more than put \n7  them at increased risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus during transit. In order to \n8  accommodate the course schedule and participate in extracurricular activities, \n9  plaintiffs, some of whom will not be given the option of asynchronous class \n10  participation, will be forced to maintain irregular sleep schedules.38 These sleep \n11  schedules will put students at a disadvantage compared to their peers, which poses a \n12  particular harm to plaintiff in classes that are graded on a curve. \n13  92.  Plaintiffs would also be burdened with health insurance costs. Many \n14  Plaintiffs have already paid for their 2020–21 health insurance plans through their \n15  university—plans that will do nothing for them in their country of origin. These \n16  Plaintiffs may need to buy health insurance in their home countries. Foregoing health \n17  insurance during the pandemic is not a realistic nor preferred option for Plaintiffs. \n18  However, given the costs associated with health insurance and the price of their now-\n19  useless American insurance, Plaintiffs may go uncovered. \n20  Education Inequities \n21  93.  If Plaintiffs are forced to return to their home countries, it could be \n22  difficult or impossible for them to participate fully in classes and complete the \n23  academic year. Students in different time zones would be forced to choose between \n24  attending online classes in the middle of the night or watching recorded classes.39 \n25 \n                                           \n26  38 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09291016.2015.1103942; https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/ \nFMfcgxwJWjBjvRFDqNrMVnNJctWDlNWW?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1 \n39 See, e.g., Kelsey J. Griffin, Hundreds of Harvard Law Students Criticize Plans for Online Fall Semester, Harv. \n27 \nCrimson (June 17, 2020, 9:11 PM), https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/17/hls-online-fall-semester/. \n  28 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 29 of 39   Page ID #:404\n \n1  Students watching recordings will be harmed because they cannot ask questions \n2  during class, participate in class discussion, or otherwise have a visible presence. But \n3  students who attempt to participate as the class occurs must stay alert for two to three \n4  hours of lecture at inopportune times, often in the middle of the night. Either way, \n5  students will be put at a substantial disadvantage compared to their classmates taking \n6  the same class during normal hours. \n7  94.  Forcing Plaintiffs to return to their countries of origin will severely limit \n8  their practical learning opportunities. In law school, meeting and communicating with \n9  clients, supervisors, and team members constitute a large part of clinical experience. \n10  While any remote learning complicates these experiences, substantial time differences \n11  like those faced by Plaintiffs make them almost impossible. For example, students \n12  enrolled in legal clinical programs often have trouble scheduling meetings with clients \n13  even when the all reside in the same city; these meetings simply will not occur when \n14  the student attorney and the client must contend with a 16-hour difference. \n15  95.  The same applies to pro bono opportunities, many of which involve client \n16  intake interviews or group work. Limiting international students’ pro bono \n17  opportunities will disadvantage them, as some law schools confer graduation honors \n18  based on the number of pro bono hours completed.40 \n19  96.  For some Plaintiffs, participating in online classes in their countries of \n20  origin may not be an option at all. Internet access, which is absolutely necessary for \n21  remote learning, is not guaranteed in some countries. Some countries have restricted \n22  internet access while others, like Ethiopia,41 block it altogether. Without adequate \n23  internet access, students cannot take online classes at all. \n24 \n25 \n                                           \n26  40 See, e.g., Pro Bono Program Code and Guidelines, UCI Law, https://www.law.uci.edu/about/public-service/public-\ninterest/probono/program-guidelines.html (last visited July 8, 2020). \n41 Bethlehem Feleke, Internet Cut Off in Ethiopia amid Outcry over Death of Singer-Activist, CNN (June 30, 2020, 2:59 \n27 \nPM), https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/africa/ethiopia-singer-killing-sparks-protest-intl/index.html. \n  29 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 30 of 39   Page ID #:405\n \n1  97.  Other countries heavily monitor internet activity and curtail access to \n2  some resources. Beyond potentially exposing students to government harassment \n3  because of the contents of their studies, these restrictions will make it difficult or \n4  impossible for students in these countries to continue their studies. \n5  98.  China, for example, limits access to Google web products.42 Many \n6  schools, including UC Irvine, use Google products like Gmail and Google Drive to \n7  communicate and collaborate on academic and clinical assignments – and this is even \n8  more true now that teaching has moved online. If students cannot access these \n9  resources, they will be locked out of their education.43  \n10  Immigration Consequences \n11  99.  The July 6 Guidance prevented students whose schools will operate \n12  entirely online from applying for Curricular Practical Training and Optional Practical \n13  Training (“OPT”) visa programs. CPT allows international students to work in their \n14  field of study while they are enrolled in their academic program.44 OPT allows \n15  students to work in the United States for one year after graduation.45 To be eligible for \n16  OPT, students must have been enrolled in school full-time for one year, maintain valid \n17  F-1 status, and be physically present in the United States at the time of application.46  \n18  Cancelling the F-1 visa or forcing international students to return to their countries of \n19  origin will make these students ineligible for CPT and will prevent them from \n20 \n21 \n                                           \n22  42 https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5 \n43 Virtual Private Networks (“VPNs”), the typical solution to internet tracking and restrictions imposed by authoritarian \n23  regimes, are heavily restricted in China. Because only government-approved VPNs are accessible, the VPN does nothing \nto secure against government intrusion. See https://www.techradar.com/news/coronavirus-sees-china-crack-down-on-\n24  vpns. And, in plaintiffs’ experience, the VPNs which are available so severely throttle internet speeds that video chat – \nnecessary to participate in online courses – is almost impossible to use.  \n25  44 F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Berkeley Int’l Office, \nhttps://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/employment/cpt (last visited July 8, 2020). \n26  45 Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 Students, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/opt (last updated Apr. 22, 2020). \n46 Id.; see also F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT), Berkeley Int’l Office, \n27 \nhttps://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/employment/opt (last visited July 8, 2020). \n  30 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 31 of 39   Page ID #:406\n \n1  applying to OPT. No changes were made to the restrictions for CPT and OPT \n2  programs in the July 24 Guidance or August 7 Guidance.  \n3  100.  Some international students have applied for permanent resident status, \n4  better known as the green card, and are waiting for approval. Plaintiffs are concerned \n5  that the new SEVP rule may extend the waiting time for students who must leave the \n6  United States because their schools will operate entirely online. \n7  Inequities in Employment Opportunities \n8  101.  Because of the risks associated with COVID-19, law schools across the \n9  nation have postponed to January their On-Campus Interviews (“OCI”), a yearly event \n10  where law firms travel to law school campuses to interview and recruit students for \n11  summer associate positions and eventual full-time employment. OCI is a competitive \n12  and important process for students. \n13  102.  If the July 24 Guidance is not extended beyond the fall 2020 semester (or \n14  if it is revoked during the fall semester), Plaintiffs will need to leave the country and \n15  will not be able to physically attend or fully participate in OCI.  \n16  103.  If schools decide to hold virtual OCI, Plaintiffs have to interview in the \n17  middle of the night and compete against domestic students who are interviewing in \n18  normal business hours.  \n19  104.  Furthermore, employers will easily be able to identify the immigration \n20  status of Plaintiffs. By simply asking about the time zone or city that Plaintiffs are in, \n21  employers can filter out international students among their interviewees. Due to the \n22  additional cost and precarious nature of sponsoring foreign nationals, some employers \n23  may avoid hiring international students for summer associate positions.47 \n24   \n25 \n                                           \n26 \n47 The disadvantages imposed to international students who are not participating in OCI are similar to Plaintiffs’ \ndisadvantages. The students will still have to interview in odd hours via Zoom and will indirectly disclose their \n27 \nimmigration status. \n  31 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 32 of 39   Page ID #:407\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n1 \nCount 1: (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706) \n2 \nDefendants’ Issue of the July 6 Guidance was Arbitrary and Capricious Both \n3 \nBecause It Failed Adequately to Consider the Reliance Interests of Millions of F-\n4 \n1 and M-1 Visa Holders and Because It Failed to Provide a Reasoned \n5  Explanation. \n6  105.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations contained in the preceding \n7  paragraphs. \n8  106.  The APA requires this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \n9  action, findings, and conclusions found to be…arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n10  discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A). Agency \n11  action must be the result of reasoned analysis. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of United \n12  States, Inc. v. State Farm Mu. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 57 (1983).  \n13  107.  This standard applies even when an agency is altering existing guidance. \n14  When an agency changes course, the agency must “be cognizant that longstanding \n15  policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into \n16  account.” Encino Motorcars LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2120 (2016). \n17  108.  As noted above, the United States has a long history of inviting \n18  international students to study as “non-immigrants” pursuant to a student visa \n19  program. International students admitted to well-established and high-quality \n20  institutions, such as those in the UC system, often have multiple options available to \n21  them. They choose to come study in the United States in reliance on the integrity of \n22  the visa program and the expectation that their student visas will remain valid as long \n23  as they are committed to their studies at their academic institutions. \n24  109.  The March 9 and March 13 guidance documents set forth a reasonable \n25  framework for addressing the implications of COVID-19 for F-1 and M-1 visas, as \n26  well as for updating the guidance in light of changes to the COVID-19 situation. The \n27  July 6 Guidance failed to identify any material changes to the COVID-19 situation \n  32 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 33 of 39   Page ID #:408\n \n1  that had occurred since March 13, and ignored entirely the approach and rationale \n2  underlying the March 9 and March 13 guidance documents.   \n3  110.  The July 6 Guidance ignored the assurances Defendants have made to \n4  hundreds of thousands of students for well over twenty years that, as long as they \n5  remain in compliance with their academic programs, they will be able to remain in the \n6  United States at the institutions where they study.  \n7  111.  The July 6 Guidance also ignored the reasonable reliance that students \n8  and schools alike placed in the approach to reconciling the impact of COVID-19 on F-\n9  1 and M-1 visa requirements set forth in the March 9 and March 13 guidance \n10  documents.  \n11  112.  The Supreme Court has recently emphasized that agencies modifying a \n12  previous policy are “required to assess whether there were reliance interests, \n13  determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against \n14  competing policy concerns.” Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of \n15  California 591 U.S. ___ (slip op., at 26) (2020). \n16  113.  The July 6 Guidance was arbitrary and capricious because it failed to \n17  consider these important reliance interests. Revoking international students’ visas \n18  when students have done everything in their power to remain in compliance with U.S. \n19  immigration law in the midst of a pandemic—and after Defendants announced at the \n20  outset of the pandemic that the United States would honor these visas during the \n21  pandemic despite the shift to online classes—disregarded the reliance interests of \n22  these students in maintaining their visa status and their ability to continue studying in \n23  the United States. The long history of the United States’ F-1 visa program, together \n24  with the March 13 Guidance, created a reasonable and justifiable expectation among \n25  students that they could maintain their visa status so long as they progressed in their \n26  particular course of study in whatever way that course of study was offered by their \n27  academic institution. \n  33 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 34 of 39   Page ID #:409\n \n1  114.  The reliance interests of F-1 visa holders extend further still. As \n2  discussed above, Plaintiffs have executed leases worth thousands of dollars for the \n3  upcoming school year. Many have paid for expensive health insurance plans that are \n4  now useless. Many will be forced to store or abandon property in the United States if \n5  they are required to exit the country on short notice or mid-way through the academic \n6  year. Many would not have paid tens of thousands of dollars in tuition to American \n7  universities had they known they could not be present in the country for the full 2020-\n8  21 academic term. \n9  115.  This reliance was justifiably premised on Defendants’ March 9 and \n10  March 13 Guidance. For example, the March 13 Guidance advised F-1 Visa holders \n11  that the spring 2020 exemptions from online learning restrictions would exist “in \n12  effect for the duration of the emergency.”  \n13  116.  Apart from the failure to address reliance interests, an agency’s failure to \n14  provide “reasoned analysis” for this sudden change in policy is “arbitrary, capricious, \n15  an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.” 5 U.S.C. \n16  §706(2)(a). Here, the July 6 Guidance failed to offer any reasonable consideration of \n17  the painful consequences of the Guidance for students, schools, and communities. For \n18  example, the Guidance contain no discussion of the implications of this new policy for \n19  public health, of the status of the COVID-19 situation and how it was different in July \n20  than March in a way that was material for this guidance, or of how and why the \n21  guidance better served the purposes of the F-1 visa program, such as allowing \n22  “students to make normal forward progress in their studies,” than did the March \n23  guidance. The July 6 Guidance lacked even an acknowledgment of, let alone a \n24  justification for, the extraordinary human suffering it would have caused.   \n25  117.  The Defendants’ voluntary and unexplained decision to change the July 6 \n26  Guidance does not mean they can avoid adjudication of the APA violations because \n27  there are no procedural or other safeguards to ensure Defendants won’t arbitrarily \n  34 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 35 of 39   Page ID #:410\n \n1  revert to the July 6 Guidance, nor have Defendants provided a rationale for their \n2  changed practices that would ensure the arbitrary and capricious manner in which they \n3  sought to effect the forced removal of Plaintiffs and other international students \n4  through the July 6 Guidance will not happen again.    \n5  118.  For these reasons and others, the July 6 Guidance must be declared to \n6  have been issued in a manner that was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n7  otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n8  Count II: (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553,706) \n9  The July 6 Guidance Violates the APA’s Notice-And-Comment Requirements. \n10  119.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations contained in the preceding \n11  paragraphs. \n12  120.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \n13  action taken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n14  § 706(2)(D). \n15  121.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, requires that any agency desiring to implement \n16  a rule go through the process of notice-and-comment in order to give the agency the \n17  benefit of the expertise of those most impacted by the potential rule-making. \n18  122.  The July Guidance did not go through any such process. Instead, DHS \n19  stated it planned to “publish the procedures and responsibilities in the Federal Register \n20  as a Temporary Final Rule.”48 \n21  123.  The July 6 Guidance formalized a reversal of previous ICE guidance and \n22  thus is subject to notice and comment requirements. It is not an interpretive rule that \n23  could be issued without notice and comment requirements. Mt. Diablo Hospital Dist. \n24  v. Bowen, 860 F.2d 951, 956 (9th Cir. 1988).  \n25 \n26 \n                                           \n48 https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online- \n27 \ncourses-during \n  35 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 36 of 39   Page ID #:411\n \n1  124.  DHS has failed to provide any “good cause” that would justify bypassing \n2  the notice and comment period. 5 U.S.C. §553 (b)(3)(B). The good cause exception is \n3  only available to agencies if the agency has “good cause” to believe the process would \n4  be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Western Oil & Gas \n5  Ass’n v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 633 F.2d 803, 810 (9th Cir. 1980). \n6  125.  The agency never “published reasons for thinking” the good cause \n7  applied to the rules in question. Id. \n8 \n126.  DHS has failed to demonstrate how threatening to deport over one \n9 \nmillion students in the middle of a global pandemic could possibly qualify as good \n10 \ncause.  \n11 \n127.  The Defendants’ voluntary and unexplained decision to change the July 6 \n12 \nGuidance does not mean they can avoid adjudication of the APA violations because \n13 \nthere are no procedural or other safeguards to ensure Defendants won’t arbitrarily \n14 \nrevert to the July 6 Guidance, nor have Defendants provided a rationale for the \n15 \nchanged practices that would ensure the arbitrary and capricious manner in which \n16 \nDefendants sought to effect the forced removal of Plaintiffs and other international \n17 \nstudents through the July 6 Guidance will not happen again.    \n18 \n128.  By promulgating the July 6 Guidelines without notice and comment, ICE \n19 \nviolated 5 U.S.C. § 553 and § 706. The modifications it announced should be declared \n20 \nunlawful. \n21 \n \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n  36 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 37 of 39   Page ID #:412\n \nCount III: (Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment) \n1   \nThe July 6 Guidance Deprive Plaintiffs of Their Visa Status \n2  Without Due Process of Law. \n3  129.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n4  contained in the preceding paragraphs. \n5  130.  Due process protections extend to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, \n6  including [non-citizens], whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, \n7  or permanent.” Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). Nonimmigrant students \n8  are lawfully present in this country. \n9  131.  Nonimmigrant students have significant liberty and property interests, \n10  protected by the Due Process Clause, in their visas and/or access to educational \n11  programs to which they have been admitted and in which they have invested time, \n12  energy, and money. The “very essence” of due process is the “protection of the \n13  individual against arbitrary action.” Board of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n14  564, 584 (1972). The July 6 Guidance was so arbitrary, both in substance and the \n15  manner in which it was implemented, that it threatened to unlawfully deprive \n16  Plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected liberty and property interests. \n17  132.  Defendants’ voluntary and unexplained decision to change the July 6 \n18  Guidance does not mean they can avoid adjudication of the due process violations \n19  because there are no procedural or other safeguards to ensure Defendants will not \n20  arbitrarily revert to the July 6 Guidance, nor have Defendants provided a rationale for \n21  their changed practices that would ensure the July 6 policy will not be reinstated.  \n22  133.  Provisions of the July 24 and August 7 Guidance that limit their \n23  applicability to the fall 2020 terms also threaten to deprive Plaintiffs of their due \n24  process rights as Defendants could again implement a policy without due process \n25  protections that would force students to leave the country if their classes are offered \n26  only online.  \n27 \n  37 \n28 \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 50   Filed 08/14/20   Page 38 of 39   Page ID #:413\n \n1  134.  As a result of the foregoing constitutional violations, Plaintiffs will suffer \n2  irreparable injury. \n3  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n4 \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully seek the following relief: \n5 \n1.  A declaration that the policy announced in the July 6 Guidance was \n6 \nunlawful and unlawfully promulgated; \n7 \n2.  Permanent injunctive relief preventing Defendants from re-enacting or \n8 \nenforcing the policy announced in July 6 Guidance, or promulgating it as a Final Rule;  \n9 \n3.  Declaratory and/or injunctive relief requiring Defendants to administer \n10 \nthe SEVP program in accordance with the March Guidance throughout the academic \n11 \nyear and for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency, unless replaced by a legally-\n12 \nsufficient agency rule promulgated through appropriate procedures, including notice \n13 \nand comment; \n14 \n4.  An order requiring Defendants to modify the July 24 Guidance and \n15 \nAugust 7 Guidance consistent with the foregoing;  \n16 \n5.

Less than one month after the Supreme Court held that the Executive \n3 Branch must “turn square corners” before taking an action that profoundly disrupts the \n4 lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals, the Executive Branch has once again \n5 acted recklessly and inexplicably to disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands more. \n6 On July 6, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) issued a press release \n7 announcing that students at colleges and universities that are offering exclusively \n8 online classes in the fall 2020 academic term because of the coronavirus pandemic \n9 would be required to leave the United States. This politically motivated directive \n10 upended the lives of foreign students who are lawfully present in this country and who \n11 contribute immeasurably to the quality of education at the institutions they attend. \n12 These students chose to come to the United States to pursue degrees in law, medicine, \n13 engineering, and every other academic field. They wish to prepare themselves to lead \n14 productive lives that serve and build community wherever they ultimately settle. \n15 Access to our outstanding institutions of higher education is one of the greatest gifts \n16 that the United States gives the world, and that gift is repaid many times over by the \n17 contributions that foreign students make to the United States and to the world as a \n18 whole by virtue of the learning they receive. Those contributions reflect their \n19 intelligence, compassion, and hard work. \n20 2.  In the midst of the most dangerous pandemic of the last hundred years, \n21 universities and graduate schools have reshaped their educational models to ensure the \n22 quality, continuity and safety of their educational programs. Utilizing their educational \n23 expertise and recognizing their paramount responsibility to the safety of the university \n24 community and the community at large, leadership at these schools have reluctantly \n25 accepted the judgments of our nation’s leading public health experts and CDC \n26 guidelines and have instituted remote learning and teaching strategies and regimens. It \n27 should go without saying that these decisions have not been easy. But it should also be \n28\n  3 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 4 of 35   Page ID #:4\n \n1 readily recognized that a university’s decision to go all or principally remote is one of \n2 life and death. Universities are doing their part to flatten the curve and repel the \n3 deadly coronavirus that thrives on crowded settings inside buildings, precisely the \n4 circumstances of normal classroom teaching and university life. And until July 6, \n5 universities were doing so in reasonable reliance on guidance that ICE itself had \n6 provided in March 2020, and that promised a flexible approach of allowing students to \n7 maintain their visas while schools attempted, in good faith and with timely notice to \n8 ICE, to provide the best educational opportunities possible while fulfilling \n9 indispensable obligations to preserve the health of their students and their \n10 communities.    \n11 3.  On July 6, ICE abruptly changed course 180 degrees, without explanation \n12 or even acknowledgement.  Its decision effectively punishes foreign students because \n13 their universities have prioritized the health and safety of their academic and local \n14 communities and of the nation by choosing to hold remote classes in the fall term. \n15 4.  The July 6 Guidelines offer no explanation whatsoever for the complete \n16 reversal in policy. But the facts are that the President of the United States, beset by \n17 falling poll numbers in a fast closing election year, has tweeted repeatedly that CDC \n18 guidelines must be altered and schools must open in the fall no matter the incongruity \n19 with fundamental public health principles and the sound, on-the-ground knowledge \n20 and expertise of university officials as to the safest course for their students and \n21 community. Indeed, on the day that the ICE message was issued, he tweeted that \n22 “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!”1 The next day, Acting Deputy \n23 Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, responding to a question about the \n24 July 6 Guidelines, explained the guidelines were “setting the rules . . . that will, again, \n25 encourage schools to reopen.”2 \n                                           \n26\n1 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (July 6, 2020, 2:40 PM EDT), \nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280209946085339136?s=20. \n27 2 \nJohe Bowden, Cuccinelli Says Rule Forcing International Students to Return Home Will 'Encourage Schools to \nReopen', The Hill (July 7, 2020),  \n28\n  4 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 5 of 35   Page ID #:5\n \n1 5.  ICE’s announcement concerning international students attending \n2 institutions that did not offer in-person instruction, or who were not able to take the \n3 in-person classes that were offered, is part and parcel of the President’s approach. \n4 These guidelines, which adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to higher education, are \n5 blunt. They do not reflect the intensely local nature of university decisions, nor do \n6 they make exceptions for students at heightened risk from the novel coronavirus. \n7 Instead, the guidelines are designed to force institutions of higher education to reopen \n8 for the fall term, no matter the cost.  \n9 6.  This life-threatening action makes foreign students pawns in a political \n10 drama. Tragically, but unsurprisingly, ICE’s press release was not accompanied by \n11 any of the safeguards the APA requires to insure “reasoned decision making” and \n12 accountability: notice and comment, rational explanation for the attack on prudent and \n13 grounded university decision making, and careful examination of the reliance interests \n14 of the students who are suddenly confronted with life and death choices. The ICE \n15 announcement makes no sense except as an irrational and cruel action designed to \n16 advance objectives having nothing to do with public health, learning, and reasonable \n17 immigration policy. The policy is indefensible, and the absence of any record or \n18 explanation for its sudden imposition is not just proof of illegality – it is evidence that \n19 no rational explanation exists.  \n20 7.  The narratives of plaintiffs, all serious students pursuing meaningful \n21 careers, illustrate the irrationality of the ICE announcement and describe the terrible \n22 consequences of allowing it to take effect. Students required to come to campus and \n23 expose themselves to the coronavirus cannot do so without risking both their health \n24 and the health of others. Some students have preexisting conditions that heighten the \n25 danger. But if they act in keeping with essential public health practices, maintaining \n26 social distancing measures in enclosed spaces with strangers, they will be left asunder, \n27\n                                           \nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506248-cuccinelli-says-rule-forcing-international-students-to-return-home. \n28\n  5 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 6 of 35   Page ID #:6\n \n1 many with literally no place to go because of international travel restrictions to their \n2 home nations. They will jeopardize their immigration status and future education and \n3 career prospects. Their education will come to a screeching halt. They will be placed \n4 in financial calamity. \n5 8.  This lawsuit seeks the invalidation of the ICE guidelines upon the \n6 bedrock principles underlying the APA: reasoned decision making, public notice and \n7 hearing, and sensitive consideration of reasonable reliance interests. The government \n8 has nothing to lose by giving orderly respect to these mandates; the foreign students, \n9 their universities and communities, and those who stand by the rule of law, have \n10 everything. \n11 PARTIES \n12 9.

After \n14 learning about UCI Law’s remote learning transition, he entered into a 13-month lease \n15 for an apartment in Irvine with monthly rent of $1,730 and security deposit. He \n16 entered into the lease with the expectation that he would be able to continue his \n17 education through distanced, remote learning. Z.W. was preparing to apply for a CPT \n18 visa so he could intern over the next, 2L summer to further his legal education.  His \n19 eligibility for the CPT visa, however, will be foreclosed if his F-1 visa is terminated.  \n20 Similar to all plaintiffs who are Chinese nationals, he is deeply concerned with the \n21 financial costs associated with returning to China. He has paid a deposit for his \n22 apartment out of pocket, and does not know how he will manage to pay for a return \n23 flight to China, or the associated costs of China’s mandatory 14-day quarantine. His \n24 education will also be essentially prematurely terminated or paused, because of \n25 China’s prohibition on Google and VPN use, in addition to the 12 hour time \n26 difference.  \n27\n28\n  6 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 7 of 35   Page ID #:7\n \n1 10.  Plaintiff C.Y. is a 27 year-old Chinese national entering her second year \n2 of law school at UCI Law. She currently lives in Irvine, California where she moved \n3 in 2019 to enroll in her first year of law school. When UCI Law switched to online \n4 classes in March 2020 and SEVP issued the March 13 Guidance, C.Y. believed she \n5 would be able to continue her studies in the United States regardless of how UCI Law \n6 choose to offer classes in the fall. So she leased on-campus housing through spring \n7 2021, and pre-paid rent at a total cost of $10,380. If she were to have to return to \n8 China, she would not be able to recover that rent. Additionally, it would be \n9 prohibitively expensive for C. Y. to return to China, as the price of airline ticket from \n10 Los Angeles to China has increased several fold since the start of the pandemic and \n11 could easily exceed $10,000. Her family cannot afford to pay the price of her plan \n12 ticket back to China, nor can she. It will also be cost-prohibitive to pay for the hotel \n13 room in which she would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days after returning to \n14 China. If she were forced to return to China in the coming months, C. Y. also fears she \n15 will be exposed to the novel coronavirus on the flight to China and become infected, \n16 as she heard happened to more than a dozen people on a recent international flight to \n17 China. Once in China, C. Y. would not be able to continue to take law school classes \n18 due to, among other things, the unavailability in China of tools that UCI Law uses to \n19 facilitate online learning, including Google products (e.g., Google Drive) and secure \n20 VPNs. Additionally, the 15 to 16 hour time change would make it practically \n21 impossible for her to engage in clinical programs in which she has enrolled and to \n22 engage in important conferences with fellow students and professors. C. Y. does not \n23 feel safe attending in-person classes due to the health risks and therefore planned to \n24 take all of her courses online in the fall. The prospect of making C. Y. choose between \n25 a potentially unsafe in-person class and a prohibitively costly emergency journey \n26 home is causing her severe distress, which she will worries will negatively impact her \n27 grades. \n28\n  7 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 8 of 35   Page ID #:8\n \n1 11.  Plaintiff X. Y. is a 25-year-old Chinese national who has attended UCI \n2 Law on an F-1 visa since 2018 and this fall, will be entering her third and final year at \n3 UCI Law. In reliance upon the SVEP’s March guidance and UCI’s June statements \n4 that the fall semester would be held remotely, X.Y. and her partner, a UCLA student, \n5 entered into a 12-month lease for an apartment in Los Angeles. She also cancelled an \n6 August trip to visit family at home in China because she anticipated complications, \n7 including travel difficulties and the possibility of not being able to return to the United \n8 States to finish her program, resulting from the pandemic. She thought it was safer to \n9 stay in place. X. Y. is deeply concerned about the prospect of travel at a time of \n10 increased risk of community transmission both nationally in the United States and \n11 locally in Los Angeles. Her healthcare plan is effective through UCI enrollment, so \n12 she doesn’t know if she would have healthcare coverage in China. X. Y. is concerned \n13 she will have to drop out of school if she is forced to return to China, because \n14 attending live-streamed classes would mean that X. Y. would need to attend school in \n15 the middle of the night, and she would have no way to obtain required casebooks. X. \n16 Y. had planned to work as a research assistant for a professor during the upcoming \n17 semester, but it will be impossible to do so if she is in China. Her ability to apply for a \n18 permanent work visa, after being forced to return to China, will be considerably more \n19 burdensome than if she remained in the United States, as she had planned.   \n20 12.  Plaintiff A. G. is a 25-year-old German national who has been attending \n21 the University of Southern California Law School (USC Law) in Los Angeles, \n22 California, on an F-1 visa, will be entering her third and final year. She lives in Los \n23 Angeles, where she is responsible for a lease and is employed through the summer by \n24 a law firm. Her responsibilities in the United States include being the sole familial \n25 caretaker for her almost 90 year-old great aunt who lives in Los Angeles. A. G. drives \n26 her to doctor’s appointments and goes grocery shopping for her. A. G. is nervous \n27 about the prospect of having to fly if she were forced to return to Germany, where she \n28\n  8 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 9 of 35   Page ID #:9\n \n1 would need to live with her immediate family. She fears that the return flight will \n2 expose her to the novel coronavirus and then put her family members at risk because \n3 of their high risk for COVID-19 complications. Her father has four stents in his heart \n4 and her mother has high blood pressure. She herself has no known pre-existing \n5 conditions, but she would be unable to take advantage of her US health insurance in \n6 Germany. If forced to return to Germany, A. G. would have difficulties continuing her \n7 studies, as she would need to take her classes in the middle of the night, due to the \n8 nine-hour time difference, and textbooks may be difficult to obtain. If USC Law were \n9 to transition to hybrid instruction, A. G. would attend in-person classes in order to stay \n10 in the country, but would not feel safe doing so. \n11 13.  Plaintiff M. X. is a 26-year-old Chinese national entering her second year \n12 of study at UCI Law. Because of the exemption granted by ICE, and UCI’s June \n13 announcement of remote instruction in the fall, M. X. decided to plan for the \n14 upcoming year by renewing her on-campus lease for a year, and has already begun \n15 paying rent under the lease. M. X. planned to continue her studies in the United States, \n16 and planned to intern next summer. In order to do so, she would need the CPT visa. \n17 Her eligibility for the CPT visa, however, will be foreclosed if her F-1 visa is \n18 terminated. She faces the additional financial burden of extremely expensive return \n19 flights to China and expenses associated with China’s mandatory 14-day quarantine. \n20 M. X. does not have the financial means to pay these required costs out of pocket on \n21 such short notice. Similarly, it would be effectively impossible for her to continue her \n22 studies while in China, due to the time difference and restrictions against Google and \n23 VPN use, meaning she would not be able to attend or participate in school even if the \n24 time zone were not an issue. If UCI were to transition to hybrid learning solely for \n25 international students, M. X. is concerned about the risk of infection in a classroom \n26 requiring physical attendance. \n27\n28\n  9 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 10 of 35   Page ID #:10\n \n1 14.  Plaintiff Z. L. is a 25 year-old Chinese national who lives in Los Angeles \n2 and is enrolled as a PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles (“UCLA”), \n3 focusing on cinema and media studies. She enrolled at UCLA in 2017 and holds an F-\n4 1 visa. After UCLA switched to online operations in late March, Z. L. remained in the \n5 United States because she did not want to risk her or her parents’ health and safety by \n6 traveling to China during a pandemic. She worries about returning to China because \n7 traveling will place her at risk of contracting COVID-19, as she will be exposed to \n8 people who may be infected with the virus at airports and inside the plane.  If she were \n9 forced to return to China, Z. L. would not be able to continue her studies for several \n10 reasons.  For instance, due to the 15-hour time difference between Los Angeles and \n11 China, Z. L. will have to attend her online classes at unconventional times. For \n12 example, Z. L. will have to call into a 1 p.m. Monday class at 4 a.m. on Tuesday, \n13 Beijing time.  Watching recorded classes is not an option for her because graduate-\n14 level courses are designed to be centered around conversations and dialogue with \n15 other students than lecture. Relying on class recordings would deprive her of \n16 important opportunities to learn from and with her peers.  Z. L. is concerned that \n17 taking in-person classes will jeopardize her health, and had been planning to take all \n18 of her fall 2020 courses online.  In China, Z. L. will not be able to access the print and \n19 digital media resources she needs to complete her dissertation, and strict quarantine \n20 requirements will likely impair her ability to study for her PhD qualifying exam.  \n21 Failure of the exam could jeopardize the funding she needs to complete the years-long \n22 program she has undertaken.  Z. L. housing situation is unsettled and if she returns to \n23 China she will have to pay costs of storage for her belongings and car.  Not knowing \n24 whether she must leave the country or risk serious illness—or even death—is keeping \n25 Z. L. tense and causing her great distress. \n26 15.  Plaintiff W. R. is a 26-year-old Chinese national entering his second year \n27 of school at UCI Law School who currently lives near Irvine, California in San Juan \n28\n  10 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 11 of 35   Page ID #:11\n \n1 Capistrano. Several months ago in March, UCI Law announced its decision to conduct \n2 remote instruction. Around that same time, W.R. received an exemption from ICE to \n3 remain in the United States with his wife, who is a permanent resident alien living in \n4 San Juan Capistrano and owns a business in the United States. If he is forced to return \n5 to China, he will be separated from his wife. He will also suffer financial losses based \n6 on decisions made in reliance on his ability to stay in the United States for his studies. \n7 If he is required to return to China, W. R.’s financial burden will also be compounded \n8 by the high cost of travel to China in the era of COVID-19, with average one-way \n9 economy flights priced at close to $10,000 (more than eight times the cost of a single \n10 flight to China before the pandemic). Additionally, passengers arriving from outside \n11 China are financially responsible for room and board associated with China’s \n12 mandatory 14-day quarantine, which would also be a financial hardship for W. R. If \n13 he is required to return to China, W. R.’s legal education will not be able to continue \n14 for all practical purposes. He will not be able to participate in classes, important \n15 group, or conduct necessary research due to the 15 to 16 hour time zone difference \n16 and China’s strict ban against Google and VPN usage, both of which are required to \n17 access the research databases and at UCI Law.  W. R. will also be unable to benefit \n18 from the student legal clinic in which he is enrolled for the upcoming fall semester if \n19 he has to return to China.  If he is required to attend in-person instruction, W. R. is \n20 concerned for his health and safety due to threat of exposure to the novel coronavirus. \n21 16.  Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security is a federal \n22 agency of the United States. \n23 17.  Defendant United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a \n24 division of the United States Department of Homeland Security. \n25 18.  Defendant Chad F.

Defendant Matthew Albence is the Acting Director of the United States \n2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He is sued in his official capacity.  \n3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4 20.  This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \n5 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. Plaintiffs are persons aggrieved by a final agency action \n6 promulgated by Defendants. See 5 U.S.C. § 702. Plaintiffs bring this suit for \n7 declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside Defendants’ action as contrary to law and \n8 arbitrary and capricious, see id. §§ 705–706, and as a violation of due process under \n9 the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution—thus presenting a federal \n10 question, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n11 21.  Venue is proper in this Court because Plaintiffs reside in this District—\n12 specifically, a majority attend UCI and reside in or near Irvine—and no real property \n13 is involved. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C). \n14 22.  Plaintiffs have standing to bring this case. Defendants’ actions will cause \n15 an imminent, concrete, and irreparable risk of harm to Plaintiffs, their families, their \n16 educations, their short-term and long-term health, and their future education and \n17 employment prospects unless halted by this Court. \n18 23.  This Court is authorized to grant the requested injunctive relief pursuant \n19 to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n20 FACTS \n21 Higher Education and the COVID-19 Pandemic \n22 24.  The world is in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic.  \n23 25.  Because humans lack built-up immunity to, or a vaccine against or \n24 effective treatment for, the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, the only \n25 way to mitigate the effects of the virus today is to stop its spread. \n26 26.  State and local governments have responded to the pandemic with \n27 unprecedented containment measures such as stay-at-home orders that instructed state \n28\n  12 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 13 of 35   Page ID #:13\n \n1 residents to avoid leaving their residences. At one point, 42 states instituted such \n2 orders.3 \n3 27.  On March 4, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state \n4 of emergency in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.4 \n5 28.  On March 9, the University of California at Berkeley suspended in-\n6 person instruction.5 \n7 29.  On March 10, the University of California campuses at Davis, Irvine, Los \n8 Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara followed suit, as did the University of Southern \n9 California.6 \n10 30.  On March 19, Governor Newsom announced a statewide stay-at-home \n11 order.7 Among other things, this order forbade universities from continuing to operate \n12 in-person classes, including the schools plaintiffs attend. \n13 31.  While the order has been amended to loosen restrictions, the order could \n14 be tightened again at any time.  \n15 32.  COVID-19 infections are surging across the country and in California. \n16 Nationwide, three million COVID-19 cases have been diagnosed, and more than \n17 132,000 people have died.8 Meanwhile, cases are on the upswing: 50,000 new cases \n18 were reported nationwide on six of the first eight days in July. The total reported cases \n19 on ten days since June 26 has exceeded the prior single-day record set on April 6. And \n20 on July 8, the number of reported daily cases broke 60,000 for the first time.9 \n21\n22\n                                           \n23\n3 Jasmine C.

In California, over 296,000 people have tested positive for the novel \n2 coronavirus.10 On July 8, an average of 7,000 new cases were reported in the state \n3 every day. Since June 29, California has reported its five highest daily new case totals \n4 since the pandemic began. These new cases are not the result of more testing - \n5 California’s test positivity rate has also increased over the last several weeks.11 Daily \n6 hospital admissions for COVID-19 patients have risen every day since June 18. And \n7 the trendline is positive, suggesting COVID-19 in California is likely to get even \n8 worse. On July 8, the state reported is highest number of COVID-19 deaths to date. \n9 34.  Both in California and nationwide, the COVID-19 pandemic is worse \n10 than at any point during the spring academic semester. \n11 35.  In recognition of the continuing threat COVID-19 posed to its students, \n12 staff, and faculty, on June 23, the University of California, Irvine School of Law \n13 (“UCI Law”) announced that all second- and third-year law students would only be \n14 able to take on-line courses.12  \n15 36.  Likewise, on June 26, the University California at Berkeley Law School \n16 (“Berkeley Law”) announced that it would conduct the fall 2020 term entirely \n17 online.13 Berkeley Law determined that restrictions on the number of students in a \n18 classroom and the requirement that classrooms be disinfected between classes would \n19 make offering safe, in-person instruction infeasible. \n20 37.  Schools in the University of California system are not alone in moving \n21 some or all students fully online in the fall semester. Harvard University14 and the \n22 University of Southern California15 will offer exclusively online instruction to all \n23\n                                           \n24\n10 COVID-19 Statewide Update, STATE OF CAL., https://update.covid19.ca.gov (last updated July 10, 2020). \n25 11 Daily State-by-State Testing Trends:California, Johns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronaivirus Research Center, \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/california (last visited July 10, 2020). \n12 https://www.law.uci.edu/news/press-releases/2020/fall-2020-semester-planning-update-06232020.pdf \n26\n13 https://www.law.berkeley.edu/article/fall-instruction-memo-6-26-20/ \n14 https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/07/06/all-harvard-university-students-will-take-online-classes-this-fall-amid- \n27\ncoronavirus/ \n15 https://coronavirus.usc.edu/2020/07/01/7-1-letter-on-student-housing-and-course-schedules/ \n28\n  14 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 15 of 35   Page ID #:15\n \n1 students. Massachusetts Institute of Technology16 and Yale University17 will bring \n2 some students back to campus for a handful of in-person classes, but most classes will \n3 be offered exclusively online. Other schools, like Brown University,18 California \n4 Institute of Technology,19 and Johns Hopkins University,20 have not yet announced \n5 their plans. \n6 38.  Schools are right to be cautious. Public health leaders believe the United \n7 States is still contending with the first wave of coronavirus infections.21 Most public \n8 health experts expect that, even if the first wave is eventually contained, a second \n9 wave of infections will take hold in the fall or winter.22 \n10 The F-1 Student Visa Program \n11 39.  The United States has labeled students as “non-immigrants” and operated \n12 a student visa program since at least 1921.23 Although the F-1 program has changed \n13 over the years, millions of students have entered the country with F-1 visas since at \n14 least 2000, as far back as public records are available.24 \n15 40.  For the Fall 2019 term, there are currently 44,485 international students \n16 in the University of California (“UC”) system. 27,189 of those are undergraduate \n17 students, and 17,295 are graduate students.25 \n18 41.  According to a report published by the U.S. Immigration and Customs \n19 Enforcement (“ICE”), the total number of Student and Exchange Visitor Information \n20 System (“SEVIS”) records for active F-1 and M-1 students was 1,551,373 in the \n21 calendar year 2018.

In 2018, California hosted 302,073 nonimmigrant students, 19.5 percent \n10 of all nonimmigrant students in the United States, and more than any other state.29 \n11 SEVP’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \n12 44.  On March 9, 2020, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (“SEVP”) \n13 issued a Broadcast Message providing guidance on COVID-19 and its implications for \n14 nonimmigrant F and M students (“March 9 Guidance”). In this guidance, SEVP \n15 recognized that “SEVP-certified schools may need to adapt their procedures and \n16 policies to address the significant public health concerns associated with the COVID-\n17 19 crisis.”  SEVP provided schools with a template that schools could use to report \n18 those changes to SEVP. SEVP assured schools and students, however, both that \n19 “SEVP is focused on ensuring that nonimmigrant students are able to continue to \n20 make normal progress in a full course of study as required by federal regulations,” and \n21 that “SEVP intends to be flexible with temporary adaptations.”  SEVP further \n22 recognize[d] that the COVID-19 crisis is fluid and rapidly changing” and “[f]or that \n23 reason” assured schools that it was “leaving room for schools to comply with state or \n24 local health emergency declarations.”    \n25\n                                           \n26\n26 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/sevisByTheNumbers2018.pdf \n27 Id. \n27\n28 Id. \n29 Id. \n28\n  16 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 17 of 35   Page ID #:17\n \n1 45.

On March 13, 2020, as governors across the country began to sign stay-\n4 at-home orders and many institutions of higher education began to switch to remote-\n5 teaching options, the SEVP issued a follow-up to the March 9 Guidance (“March 13 \n6 Guidance”) addressing “inquiries” that SEVP had received about various “different \n7 scenarios” a school or student might face, and instructing schools and students how \n8 the transition to online classes would affect nonimmigrant students’ visa status.31 \n9 47.  The March 13 Guidance presented students with three scenarios they \n10 might face: a complete school shutdown, a switch to online learning while the student \n11 remained in the United States, and a switch to online learning while the student moved \n12 outside of the United States.32 In all three scenarios, SEVP assured students that they \n13 would be able to remain in compliance with the terms of their visas. \n14 48.  SEVP assured students and schools that it would treat school shutdowns \n15 the same way it treated “short-term breaks in the school calendar.” International \n16 students would remain eligible for their visas if they “intend[ed] to resume their \n17 course of study when classes resume.”33 \n18 49.  For institutions that switched to online education, and “[g]iven the \n19 extraordinary nature of the COVID-19 emergency,” SEVP waived the limits for \n20 online courses laid out in 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 214.2(m)(9)(v). SEVP \n21 waived these limits for both international students who remained in the United States \n22 and those who chose to travel abroad during the period of online instruction.34 SEVP \n23 explained that these waivers would remain in place for “the duration of the [COVID-\n24 19] emergency . . . .” \n                                           \n25\n30 https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency- concerning-novel-\ncoronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak  \n26\n31 https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2020/Coronavirus%20Guidance_3.13.20.pdf \n32 Id. \n27\n33 Id. \n34 Id. \n28\n  17 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 18 of 35   Page ID #:18\n \n1 50.  At the end of the March 13 Guidance, SEVP noted that “[d]ue to “the \n2 fluid nature of this difficult situation, this guidance may be subject to change.” \n3 Nowhere in the March 13 Guidance, however, did SEVP suggest or even hint that it \n4 intended to change the values that underlay the March 9 and March 13 guidance, such \n5 as to abandon the “focus” it had announced, just six days before, on “ensuring that \n6 nonimmigrant students are able to continue to make normal progress in a full course \n7 of study.” March 9 Guidance.  Similarly, nowhere in the March 13 Guidance did \n8 SEVP suggest or hint that it no longer “intend[ed] to be flexible with temporary \n9 adaptations” or would deny schools “room … to comply with state or local health \n10 emergency declarations.” March 9 Guidance.  To the contrary, SEVP made clear that \n11 it planned to monitor factual changes in the COVID-19 situation: “SEVP will \n12 continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and will adjust its guidance as needed.”   \n13 51.  On March 20, 2020, ICE posted links to the March 9 and March 13 \n14 guidance documents on its website together with some sample Questions and Answers \n15 geared to be helpful to students. One such Q and A read:  \n16 “Can nonimmigrant students participate in online classes?  \n17 “SEVP is committed to remaining flexible in allowing schools to make temporary \n18 procedural adaptations so nonimmigrant students can continue to make normal \n19 forward progress in their program of study. They can temporarily engage in distance-\n20 learning, either from within the U.S. or outside the country, in light of COVID-19. \n21 SEVP will provide updated guidance as additional information concerning the scope \n22 and length of this situation becomes clearer.”  (Emphasis added.) \n23 52.  For the four months following the release of the March 9 and March 13 \n24 guidance documents, students and schools engaged in extensive efforts to plan for the \n25 fall academic year, trusting that SEVP’s March 9 Guidance and March 13 Guidance, \n26 as reiterated in the other communications, accurately reflected the approach that SEVP \n27\n28\n  18 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 19 of 35   Page ID #:19\n \n1 would take to the visa status of international students during the COVID-19 \n2 emergency.   \n3 53.  The nation’s COVID-19 emergency is not over.  President Trump has not \n4 withdrawn the declaration of a national state of emergency.  In California, COVID-19 \n5 infection and death rates remain consistent with—and indeed are exceeding—the \n6 levels when the March Guidances were issued, as noted above.  \n7 54.  Yet on July 6, 2020, SEVP suddenly and without notice announced a \n8 rollback of the exemptions put in place for the spring and summer 2020 terms.35 \n9 55.  The new guidelines (“July 6 Guidelines”) require students whose \n10 institutions choose to conduct the fall 2020 term entirely online to exit the United \n11 States. The announcement states that: \n12\nNonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating \nentirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the \n13\nUnited States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to \n14\nstudents enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for \nthe fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit \n15\nthese students to enter the United States. Active students currently in \n16\nthe United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or \n17 take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person \ninstruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face \n18\nimmigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation \n19 of removal proceedings.36 \n20 56.  The July 6 Guidelines also made clear that students whose in-person \n21 classes were switched online partway through the term would be required to leave the \n22 United States: \n23\nSchools should update their information in the Student and Exchange \n24 Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the change if \nthey begin the fall semester with in-person classes but are later \n25\nrequired to switch to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student \n26\n                                           \n35 https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online- \n27\ncourses-during \n36 Id. \n28\n  19 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 20 of 35   Page ID #:20\n \nchanges their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an \n1\nentirely online course load. Nonimmigrant students within the United \n2 States are not permitted to take a full course of study through online \nclasses. If students find themselves in this situation, they must leave \n3\nthe country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant \n4 status such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave.37  \n5\n57.  The July 6 Guidelines further bar students whose institutions have gone \n6\neither hybrid or in-person from taking a fully online curriculum: \n7\nThese schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, \n8\n“Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” certifying \n9 that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an \nentirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking \n10\nthe minimum number of online classes required to make normal \n11 progress in their degree program.  \n12\n58.  Nowhere in the July 6 Guidelines does SEVP state that the COVID-19 \n13\nemergency has ended, whether as a formal or a factual matter.  Indeed, the July 6 \n14\nGuidelines are entirely silent on “the COVID-19 situation” that SEVP had said it was \n15\nplanning to monitor and would make the basis of any change in guidance.    \n16\n59.  Nowhere in the July 6 Guidelines does SEVP acknowledge its prior \n17\ncommitment, in the March 9 Guidance, to allow international students “to make \n18\nnormal progress in a full course of study,” “to be flexible with temporary \n19\nadaptations,” or allow schools “room … to comply with state or local health \n20\nemergency declarations.” \n21\n60.  Nowhere in the July 6 Guidelines does SEVP give any consideration to \n22\nthe reliance that international students and schools may have placed, in making their \n23\nrespective plans for the coming academic year, on the March 9 and March 13 \n24\nguidance documents, on the nation’s longstanding commitment to the F-1 Visa \n25\nprogram, and on the expectation that any changes SEVP would announce to the March \n26\n27\n                                           \n37 Id. \n28\n  20 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 21 of 35   Page ID #:21\n \n1 9 and 13 guidance would reflect a good-faith assessment of materially changed \n2 circumstances in light of the values expressed in those documents. \n3 61.  The July 6 Guidelines thus reflect a complete but unacknowledged \n4 repudiation of the approach SEVP laid out on March 9 and March 13 to addressing the \n5 implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for holders F-1 and M-1 visas.      \n6 62.  The July 6 Guidelines also fail to address numerous important issues that \n7 any reasoned decision would consider.  For example, the July 6 Guidelines do not \n8 include an exception for students who cannot attend classes because they are at an \n9 elevated risk to COVID-19 due to pre-existing health conditions, nor do they contain \n10 an exception for students living with family members or roommates who are at an \n11 elevated risk to COVID-19. \n12 63.  The July 6 Guidelines also do not include an exception for students who \n13 are forced into online classes because the state institutes a stay-at-home order that \n14 shuts down their educational institution. \n15 64.  The July 6 Guidelines also do not include an exception for students who \n16 are forced to come back to the United States because their schools have gone hybrid \n17 or remained in-person. \n18 65.  The July 6 Guidelines also do not include an exception for students who \n19 cannot access the internet in their country of origin, for students who cannot safely \n20 travel or who cannot travel at all to their country of origin, or for students who fear \n21 suffering injury or death if they return to their country of origin. \n22 66.  In summary, the July 6 Guidelines completely abandon, without \n23 explanation, both the substantive guidance SEVP provided on March 9 and March 13 \n24 and the approach SEVP announced it would take to considering any changes to that \n25 guidance.  The July 6 Guidelines also ignore the public-health-informed decisions of \n26 schools and government officials to limit or cease in-person teaching. They do not \n27 include a safety valve for even the worst coronavirus outbreaks. They do not allow for \n28\n  21 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 22 of 35   Page ID #:22\n \n1 any of the flexibility necessary to safely manage an increasingly dangerous pandemic. \n2 The July 6 Guidelines do nothing but expel students from the United States because of \n3 circumstances outside of the students’ control, no matter the consequences for the \n4 students, the schools, or the country. \n5 67.  Students at schools that have not yet announced their fall plans do not \n6 know if the July 6 Guidelines apply to them or whether they will be able to remain in \n7 the United States for the fall term. \n8 68.  Even students at schools who have announced some in-person course \n9 offerings may not have not yet assigned students to classes. International students at \n10 these schools do not know if they will be able to enroll in an in-person class, a \n11 necessity of continuing to study in the United States under the July 6 Guidelines. \n12 Some of these schools do not finalize class schedules until after the beginning of the \n13 academic term, creating a possibility that students will be required to leave the United \n14 States in the middle of the semester. \n15 69.  In a Broadcast Message released on the same day as the July 6 \n16 Guidelines, SEVP stated that schools are required to notify SEVP if they intend to \n17 only offer remote instruction by July 15, 2020.38 Schools choosing to offer some in-\n18 person instruction are required to notify SEVP by August 1. If a school decides or is \n19 required to cease in-person instruction over the course of the semester, it must notify \n20 SEVP of that change within 10 calendar days. \n21 70.  The SEVP has not provided an explanation for its departure from the \n22 March 9 and March 13 guidance documents \n23 71.  But on July 7, Ken Cuccinelli, the Senior Official Performing the Duties \n24 of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and the Senior Official \n25 Performing the Duties of the Director of the United States Citizenship and \n26 Immigration Services (“USCIS”), made clear his views about students enrolled in \n27\n                                           \n38 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf \n28\n  22 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 23 of 35   Page ID #:23\n \n1 online courses, or enrolled at institutions offering only online courses. “There isn’t a \n2 reason for a person holding a student visa to be present in the country . . . they don’t \n3 have a basis to be here. . . . I don’t frankly follow why a student visa holder would be \n4 here if their school isn’t functioning.”39 \n5 72.  On July 6, at 2:40 p.m. Eastern Time, President Donald Trump tweeted \n6 his support for the opening of schools by stating, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE \n7 FALL!!!”40 \n8 73.  President Trump continued to pressure other institutions beyond \n9 universities to open in the fall by threatening to cut funding otherwise.41 \n10 74.  At 4:11 p.m., he accused the Democratic Party and the presidential \n11 candidate Joe Biden of supporting closure of schools for political reasons and not \n12 health reasons.42 \n13 The Effects of the July 6 Guidelines on International Students \n14 75.  Plaintiffs either attend schools that are exclusively offering online \n15 education in the fall to all students or to students similarly situated to plaintiffs.  \n16 76.  It is impossible for students to transfer to a different law school for the \n17 start of the fall 2020 term. Even if it were possible to transfer, it would be impractical \n18 to move, perhaps across the country, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n19 77.  Under the July 6 Guidelines, plaintiffs will have no choice but to leave \n20 the United States. They will be ripped from their communities and their academics. \n21 Their carefully-laid financial, health, employment, immigration, and personal plans—\n22 made under the assumption that SVEP would not revoke its March 13 Guidance for \n23 the “duration of the emergency”—will be upended. \n24  \n25\n                                           \n39 https://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-ken-cuccinelli-and-cnns-brianna-keilar-battle-in-absurd-20-minute-debate-on- \n26\nimmigration-covid-and-confederate-flags/ \n40 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280209946085339136 \n27\n41 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/us/politics/trump-schools-reopening.html \n42 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1280232979781111808 \n28\n  23 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 24 of 35   Page ID #:24\n \nHousing \n1\n78.  Some plaintiffs have signed leases and acquired housing under the \n2\nassumption that they would be present in the United States during the fall term. If the \n3\nJuly 6 Guidelines are enforced and these plaintiffs are forced to leave the United \n4\nStates, these plaintiffs will either have to break their lease and lose their security \n5\ndeposits, which would result in a loss to their credit score, or continue to pay rent until \n6\nthe lease terminates. \n7\n79.  Plaintiffs will likewise have to procure housing in their country of origin. \n8\nWhile some plaintiffs may be able to live with family, others have no safety net in that \n9\ncountry, and will be forced to find housing with adequate internet connections and \n10\naccess to study space with little notice, perhaps before they leave the United States. \n11\n80.  When some plaintiffs relocated to the United States to enter their \n12\nrespective academic programs, they brought all of their belongings and livelihoods. \n13\nBecause they justifiably expected to remain in the United States for years of \n14\neducation, they did not build a safety net in their countries of origin. They terminated \n15\ntheir housing, sold their furniture, and gave away the belongings that they could not \n16\nbring with them to the United States. These plaintiffs do not have a ready-made home \n17\nin their respective home countries. \n18\n81.  If schools reopen in the spring, plaintiffs who were forced to leave the \n19\nUnited States under the July 6 Guidelines will be forced to return to the United States, \n20\nlikely on short notice, in order to maintain their visa status. \n21\n82.  These students, who may have abandoned the housing they secured for \n22\nthe fall term because of the July 6 Guidelines, will find it difficult or impossible to \n23\nsecure adequate, affordable housing. When it comes to signing leases, plaintiffs often \n24\ndo not have the luxury of choice. Foreign students often do not have robust credit \n25\nscores because of their shorter credit histories and newer bank accounts. Any \n26\nabandonment of housing secured for the fall semester only accentuates these problems \n27\n28\n  24 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 25 of 35   Page ID #:25\n \n1 – as does the possibility of having to find housing remotely in their institution’s city \n2 with only a few weeks’ notice once spring term plans are announced. \n3  \nTravel \n4\n5 83.  The COVID-19 pandemic affects countries worldwide. Multiple \n6 countries have shut down their borders and banned all transnational flights. Others \n7 have specifically barred flights from the United States. Plaintiffs attempting to comply \n8 with the July 6 Guidelines may not be able to find flights back to their home countries. \n9 84.  Even if each plaintiff is able to find a flight itinerary that will eventually \n10 take her home, that itinerary will necessarily include multiple stops over different \n11 continents.  \n12 85.  This itinerary is not simply inconvenient. It is a health risk. As an airline \n13 passenger, the plaintiff would spend hours in a confined space surrounded by shared \n14 surfaces - exactly the kind of prolonged exposure that creates substantial risk of \n15 contracting the novel coronavirus.  This is in addition to the added risks associated \n16 with airports, whether it be standing in security lines or waiting at the gate to board an \n17 aircraft.   \n18 86.  Such an itinerary is also exorbitantly, perhaps prohibitively, expensive. \n19 As noted above, airfare may exceed $10,000 – especially given the need to book on \n20 short notice. In addition, for students returning to countries, such as China, that have \n21 imposed a quarantine on incoming travelers, the students would have to pay for 14 \n22 days’ lodging while they quarantine. \n23 87.  If a plaintiff’s academic institution decides to permit in-person teaching \n24 in the spring semester, Plaintiffs will have to once again pay for another set of flights \n25 and expose themselves to other travelers in order to return to the United States. \n26 88.  The financial and logistical challenges that Plaintiffs face multiply for \n27 international students with dependents. \n28\n  25 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 26 of 35   Page ID #:26\n \nHealth Risks \n1\n89.  Forcing students to return to their countries of origin does more than put \n2\nthem at increased risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus during transit. In order to \n3\naccommodate the course schedule and participate in extracurricular activities, \n4\nplaintiffs, some of whom will not be given the option of asynchronous class \n5\nparticipation, will be forced to maintain irregular sleep schedules.43 These sleep \n6\nschedules will put students at a disadvantage compared to their peers, which poses a \n7\nparticular harm to plaintiff in classes that are graded on a curve. \n8\n90.  Plaintiffs are also burdened with health insurance costs. Many plaintiffs \n9\nhave already paid for their 2020–2021 health insurance plans through their \n10\nuniversity—plans that will do nothing for them in their country of origin. These \n11\nplaintiffs may need to buy health insurance in their home countries. Foregoing health \n12\ninsurance during the pandemic is not a realistic nor preferred option for plaintiffs. \n13\nHowever, given the costs associated with health insurance and the price of their now-\n14\nuseless American insurance, plaintiffs may go uncovered. \n15\n \n16\nEducation Inequities \n17\n91.  The July 6 Guidelines make it difficult or impossible for plaintiffs to \n18\nparticipate fully in class. Students in different time zones are forced to choose between \n19\nattending online classes in the middle of the night or watching recorded classes.44 \n20\nStudents watching recordings will be harmed because they cannot ask questions \n21\nduring class, participate in class discussion, or otherwise have a visible presence. But \n22\nstudents who attempt to participate as the class occurs must stay alert for two to three \n23\nhours of lecture at inopportune times, often in the middle of the night. Either way, \n24\n25\n                                           \n26\n43 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09291016.2015.1103942; https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/ \nFMfcgxwJWjBjvRFDqNrMVnNJctWDlNWW?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1 \n27\n44 See, e.g., Kelsey J. Griffin, Hundreds of Harvard Law Students Criticize Plans for Online Fall Semester, Harv. \nCrimson (June 17, 2020, 9:11 PM), https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/6/17/hls-online-fall-semester/. \n28\n  26 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 27 of 35   Page ID #:27\n \n1 students will be put at a substantial disadvantage compared to their classmates taking \n2 the same class during normal hours. \n3 92.  Forcing plaintiffs to return to their countries of origin will severely limit \n4 their practical learning opportunities. In law school, meeting and communicating with \n5 clients, supervisors, and team members constitute a large part of clinical experience. \n6 While any remote learning complicates these experiences, substantial time differences \n7 like those faced by plaintiffs make them almost impossible. For example, many \n8 clinical students have trouble scheduling meetings with clients who lack access to \n9 technology when they all reside in the same city; these meetings simply will not occur \n10 when the student attorney and the client must contend with a 16-hour difference. \n11 93.  The same applies to pro bono opportunities, many of which involve client \n12 intake interviews or group work. Limited pro bono opportunities will disadvantage \n13 international students, as some law schools confer graduation honors based on the \n14 number of pro bono hours completed.45 \n15 94.  For some plaintiffs, participating in online classes in their countries of \n16 origin may not be an option at all. Internet access, which is absolutely necessary for \n17 remote learning, is not guaranteed in some countries. Some countries have restricted \n18 internet access while others, like Ethiopia,46 block it altogether. Without adequate \n19 internet access, students cannot take online classes at all. \n20 95.  Other countries heavily monitor internet activity and curtail access to \n21 some resources. Beyond potentially exposing students to government harassment \n22 because of the contents of their studies, these restrictions will make it difficult or \n23 impossible for students in these countries to continue their studies. \n24\n25\n                                           \n26\n45 See, e.g., Pro Bono Program Code and Guidelines, UCI Law, https://www.law.uci.edu/about/public-service/public-\ninterest/probono/program-guidelines.html (last visited July 8, 2020). \n27\n46 Bethlehem Feleke, Internet Cut Off in Ethiopia amid Outcry over Death of Singer-Activist, CNN (June 30, 2020, 2:59 \nPM), https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/30/africa/ethiopia-singer-killing-sparks-protest-intl/index.html. \n28\n  27 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 28 of 35   Page ID #:28\n \n1 96.  China, for example, limits access to Google web products.47 Many \n2 schools, including UC Irvine, use Google products like Gmail and Google Drive to \n3 communicate and collaborate on academic and clinical assignments – and this is even \n4 more true now that teaching has moved online. If students cannot access these \n5 resources, they will be locked out of their education.48  \n6 Immigration Consequences \n7 97.  The July 6 Guidelines prevents students whose schools will operate \n8 entirely online from applying for Curricular Practical Training (“CPT”) and Optional \n9 Practical Training (“OPT”) visa programs. CPT allows international students to work \n10 in their field of study while they are enrolled in their academic program.49 OPT allows \n11 students to work in the United States for one year after graduation.50 To be eligible for \n12 OPT, students must have been enrolled in school full-time for one year, maintain valid \n13 F-1 status, and be physically present in the United States at the time of application.51 \n14 Cancelling the F-1 visa or forcing international students to return to their countries of \n15 origin will make these students ineligible for CPT and will prevent them from \n16 applying to OPT. \n17 98.  Some international students have applied for permanent resident status, \n18 better known as the green card, and are waiting for approval. Plaintiffs are concerned \n19 that the new SEVP rule may extend the waiting time for students who must leave the \n20 United States because their schools will operate entirely online. \n21\n22                                            \n47 https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5 \n23 48 Virtual Private Networks (“VPNs”), the typical solution to internet tracking and restrictions imposed by authoritarian \nregimes, are heavily restricted in China. Because only government-approved VPNs are accessible, the VPN does nothing \n24 to secure against government intrusion. See https://www.techradar.com/news/coronavirus-sees-china-crack-down-on-\nvpns. And, in plaintiffs’ experience, the VPNs which are available so severely throttle internet speeds that video chat – \n25 necessary to participate in online courses – is almost impossible to use.  \n49 F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Berkeley Int’l Office, \nhttps://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/employment/cpt (last visited July 8, 2020). \n26\n50 Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 Students, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/opt (last updated Apr. 22, 2020). \n27\n51 Id.; see also F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT), Berkeley Int’l Office, \nhttps://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/employment/opt (last visited July 8, 2020). \n28\n  28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 29 of 35   Page ID #:29\n \nInequities in Employment Opportunities \n1\n99.  Because of the risks associated with COVID-19, law schools across the \n2\nnation have postponed to January their On-Campus Interviews (OCI), a yearly event \n3\nwhere law firms travel to law school campuses to interview and recruit students for \n4\nsummer associate positions and eventual full-time employment. OCI is a competitive \n5\nand important process for students. \n6\n100.  The July 6 Guidelines, however, deny plaintiffs the opportunity to \n7\nphysically attend OCI or fully participate in OCI. If schools hold OCI in person, \n8\nPlaintiffs are practically blocked from participating because Plaintiffs will be required \n9\nto find flights, find housing, self-quarantine, and ensure that they are free from \n10\nCOVID-19—if they are eligible to enter the United States at all. \n11\n101.  If schools decide to hold virtual OCI, plaintiffs have to interview in the \n12\nmiddle of the night and compete against domestic students who are interviewing in \n13\nnormal business hours.  \n14\n102.  Furthermore, employers will easily be able to identify the immigration \n15\nstatus of plaintiffs. By simply asking about the time zone or city that plaintiffs are in, \n16\nemployers can filter out international students among their interviewees. Due to the \n17\nadditional cost and precarious nature of sponsoring foreign nationals, some employers \n18\nmay avoid hiring international students for summer associate positions.52 \n19\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n20\nCount 1: (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §706) \n21\nThe July 6 Guidelines are Arbitrary and Capricious Both Because They Fail to \n22\nAdequately Consider the Reliance Interests of Millions of F-1 and M-1 Visa \n23\nHolders and Because They Fail to Provide a Reasoned Explanation. \n24\n103.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations contained in the preceding \n25\nparagraphs. \n26\n                                           \n52 The disadvantages imposed to international students who are not participating in OCI are similar to Plaintiffs’ \n27\ndisadvantages. The students will still have to interview in odd hours via Zoom and will indirectly disclose their \nimmigration status. \n28\n  29 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 30 of 35   Page ID #:30\n \n1 104.  The APA requires this Court to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \n2 action, findings, and conclusions found to be…arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n3 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A). Agency \n4 action must be the result of reasoned analysis. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of United \n5 States, Inc. v. State Farm Mu. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 57 (1983).  \n6 105.  This standard applies even when an agency is altering existing guidance. \n7 When an agency changes course, the agency must “be cognizant that longstanding \n8 policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into \n9 account.” Encino Motorcars LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2120 (2016). \n10 106.  As noted above, the United States has a long history of inviting \n11 international students to study as “non-immigrants” pursuant to a student visa \n12 program. International students admitted to well-established and high-quality \n13 institutions, such as those in the UC system, often have multiple options available to \n14 them. They choose to come study in the United States in reliance on the integrity of \n15 the visa program and the expectation that their student visas will remain valid as long \n16 as they are committed to their studies at their academic institutions. \n17 107.  The March 9 and March 13 guidance documents set forth a reasonable \n18 framework for addressing the implications of COVID-19 for F-1 and M-1 visas, as \n19 well as for updating the guidance in light of changes to the COVID-19 situation.  The \n20 July 6 Guidelines identify no material changes to the COVID-19 situation since \n21 March 13, and ignore entirely the approach and rationale underlying the March 9 and \n22 March 13 guidance documents.   \n23 108.  The July 6 Guidelines ignores the assurances SEVP has made to \n24 hundreds of thousands of students for well over twenty years that, as long as they \n25 remain in compliance with their academic programs, they will be able to remain in the \n26 United States at the institutions where they study.  \n27\n28\n  30 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 31 of 35   Page ID #:31\n \n1 109.  The July 6 Guidelines also ignore the reasonable reliance that students \n2 and schools alike placed in the approach to reconciling the impact of COVID-19 on F-\n3 1 and M-1 visa requirements set forth in the March 9 and March 13 guidance \n4 documents.  \n5 110.  The Supreme Court has recently emphasized that agencies modifying a \n6 previous policy are “required to assess whether there were reliance interests, \n7 determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against \n8 competing policy concerns.” Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of \n9 California 591 U.S. ___ (slip op., at 26) (2020). \n10 111.  The July 6 Guidelines are arbitrary and capricious because they fail to \n11 consider these important reliance interests. Revoking international students’ visas \n12 when the students have done everything in their power to remain in compliance with \n13 U.S. immigration law in the midst of a pandemic—and after SEVP announced at the \n14 outset of the pandemic that the United States would honor these visas during the \n15 pandemic despite the shift to online classes—disregards the reliance interests of these \n16 students in maintaining their visa status and their ability to continue studying in the \n17 United States. The long history of the United States’ F-1 visa program, together with \n18 the SEVP’s March 13 announcement, created a reasonable and justifiable expectation \n19 among students that they could maintain their visa status so long as they progressed in \n20 their particular course of study in whatever way that course of study was offered by \n21 their academic institution. \n22 112.  The reliance interests of F-1 visa holders extend further still.  As \n23 discussed above, plaintiffs have executed leases worth thousands of dollars for the \n24 upcoming school year. Many have paid for expensive health insurance plans that are \n25 now useless. Many will be forced to store or abandon property in the United States if \n26 they are required to exit the country on short notice. Many would not have paid tens of \n27\n28\n  31 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 32 of 35   Page ID #:32\n \n1 thousands of dollars in tuition to American universities had they known they could not \n2 be present in the country for the fall term. \n3 113.  This reliance was justifiably premised on SEVP’s March 9 and March 13 \n4 guidance. For example, the March 13 guidance advised F-1 Visa holders that the \n5 spring 2020 exemptions from online learning restrictions would exist “in effect for the \n6 duration of the emergency.”  \n7 114.  Apart from the failure to address reliance interests, an agency’s failure to \n8 provide “reasoned analysis” for this sudden change in policy is “arbitrary, capricious, \n9 an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.” 5 U.S.C. \n10 §706(2)(a). Here, the July 6 Guidelines fail to offer any reasonable consideration of \n11 the painful consequences of the Guidelines for students, schools, and communities. \n12 For example, the Guidelines contain no discussion of the implications of this new \n13 policy for public health, of the status of the COVID-19 situation and how it is \n14 different now than it was in March in a way that is material for this guidance, or of \n15 how and why this guidance better serves the purposes of the F-1 visa program, such as \n16 allowing “students to make normal forward progress in their studies,” than does the \n17 prior guidance.  The Guidelines lack even an acknowledgment of, let alone a \n18 justification for, the extraordinary human suffering they will cause.       \n19 115.  For these reasons and others, the July 6 Guidelines must be vacated and \n20 “set aside” as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n21 accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n22 Count II: (Violation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 553,706) \n23 The July 6 Guidelines Violates the APA’s Notice-And-Comment Requirements. \n24 116.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations contained in the preceding \n25 paragraphs. \n26\n27\n28\n  32 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 33 of 35   Page ID #:33\n \n1 117.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency \n2 action taken “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n3 § 706(2)(D). \n4 118.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, requires that any agency desiring to implement \n5 a rule go through the process of notice-and-comment in order to give the agency the \n6 benefit of the expertise of those most impacted by the potential rule-making. \n7 119.  The July Guidelines did not go through any such process. Instead, DHS \n8 plans to “publish the procedures and responsibilities in the Federal Register as a \n9 Temporary Final Rule.”53 \n10 120.  The July 6 Guidelines formalize a reversal of previous ICE guidance and \n11 thus is subject to notice and comment requirements. They are not an interpretive rule \n12 that could be issued without notice and comment requirements. Mt. Diablo Hospital \n13 Dist. v. Bowen, 860 F.2d 951, 956 (9th Cir. 1988).  \n14 121.  DHS has failed to provide any “good cause” that would justify bypassing \n15 the notice and comment period. 5 U.S.C. §553 (b)(3)(B) The good cause exception is \n16 only available to agencies if the agency has “good cause” to believe the process would \n17 be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Western Oil & Gas \n18 Ass’n v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 633 F.2d 803, 810 (9th Cir. 1980). \n19 122.  The agency has yet to “publish[] reasons for thinking” the good cause \n20 applies to the rules in question. Id. \n21 123.  DHS has failed to demonstrate how threatening to deport over one \n22 million students in the middle of a global pandemic could possibly qualify as good \n23 cause.  \n24 124.  By promulgating the July 6 Guidelines without notice and comment, ICE \n25 violated 5 U.S.C. § 553 and § 706. The modifications it announced are unlawful and \n26 must be vacated. \n                                           \n27\n53 https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online- \ncourses-during \n28\n  33 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 34 of 35   Page ID #:34\n \nCount III: (Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment) \n1  \nThe July 6 Guidelines Deprive Plaintiffs of their Visa Status \n2 Without Due Process of Law. \n3 125.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n4 contained in the preceding paragraphs. \n5 126.  Due process protections extend to “all ‘persons’ within the United States, \n6 including [non-citizens], whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, \n7 or permanent.” Zadvydasv. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). Nonimmigrant students \n8 are lawfully present in this country. \n9 127.  Nonimmigrant students have significant liberty and property interests, \n10 protected by the Due Process Clause, in their visas and/or access to educational \n11 programs to which they have been admitted and in which they have invested time, \n12 energy, and money.  The “very essence” of due process is the “protection of the \n13 individual against arbitrary action.” Board of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. \n14 564, 584 (1972). The July 6 Guidelines are so arbitrary, both in substance and the \n15 manner in which they were implemented, that they unlawfully deprive Plaintiffs of \n16 their constitutionally protected liberty and property interests. \n17 128.  As a result of the foregoing constitutional violations, Plaintiffs will suffer \n18 irreparable injury. \n19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n20\nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully seek the following relief: \n21\n1.  A declaration that the policy announced in the July 6 Guidelines is \n22\nunlawful and unlawfully promulgated; \n23\n2.  A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive \n24\nrelief preventing Defendants from enforcing the policy announced in July 6 \n25\nGuidelines, or promulgating it as a Final Rule; \n26\n/ / / \n27\n/ / / \n28\n  34 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220   Document 1   Filed 07/10/20   Page 35 of 35   Page ID #:35\n \n1 3.  An order vacating and setting aside the policy announced in the July 6 \n2 Guidelines and reinstating the March 13 Guidance; \n3 4.

Each of Plaintiffs’ schools has announced that, due to the \n8  ongoing (and worsening) COVID-19 crisis, instruction for Plaintiffs’ fall semesters \n9  will be online only. \n10  Under Guidance issued by SEVP in March, Plaintiffs would be able to continue \n11  living and studying in the United States for the fall semester. But on July 6, 2020, \n12  Defendants abruptly announced a policy change: if a school proceeds with online-only \n13  instruction for the fall semester, then SEVP students “must leave the country or take \n14  alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as transfer to a school \n15  with in-person instruction.” At this point, Plaintiffs have no feasible ability to transfer \n16  to a different school, and if forced to leave the United States would be subject to \n17  extreme financial hardship, health risks, and disruption to their courses of study.  \n18  On July 10, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint challenging the July 6 policy \n19  change on the following grounds: (1) it is “arbitrary and capricious” in the violation \n20  the APA because Defendants failed to consider stakeholders’ reliance interests on the \n21  prior policy, and because Defendants failed to provide a reasoned explanation; (2) it \n22  was improperly issued without meeting notice-and-comment requirements, also in \n23  violation of the APA; and (3) it violates the Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs now \n24  request a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) enjoining the implementation of the \n25  July 6 policy change on the grounds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, \n26  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm absent emergency relief, and the balance of \n27  hardships and public interest tip sharply in favor of Plaintiffs and maintaining the \n28  status quo.  \n  5 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 8 of 35   Page ID #:118\n \n1  On July 13, 2020, counsel for Plaintiffs Mark D.

When the COVID-19 crisis hit, SEVP initially responded appropriately. On \n6  March 9, 2020, it issued a guidance assuring visa students that they could remain in \n7  the country, even if their universities went to online-only instruction.1 It further \n8  advised that the adapted procedures were “for the duration of the emergency.”2 \n9  The COVID-19 emergency has not abated; to the contrary, COVID-19 cases are \n10  surging. Given these conditions, and in reliance on the March Guidance, numerous \n11  universities have already committed to online instruction for the fall, and students \n12  have also planned accordingly. Yet on July 6, Defendants abruptly shifted course: they \n13  announced that, if a school continues with online-only instruction for the fall semester, \n14  SEVP students “must leave the country or take alternate steps … such as transferring \n15  to a school with in-person instruction.”3  \n16  Just one month ago, the Supreme Court warned that, when the Executive \n17  Branch changes course, it must “turn square corners” by considering all important \n18  aspects of the problem, including people’s reliance on the prior policy. Dep’t of \n19  Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1909, 1914 (2020) ( \n20  “Regents”). Defendants again have failed to heed that requirement.  \n21  The July 6 policy change is unsupported by any reasoned explanation and is \n22  entirely arbitrary, whether viewed from the perspective of public health, the integrity \n23                                             \n1 Broadcast Message: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Potential \n24  Procedural Adaptations for F and M nonimmigrant students, No. 2003-01 (Mar. 9, \n2020) (hereinafter “March 9 Guidance”), attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of \n25  Sheri Porath Rockwell (“Rockwell Decl.”). \n2 COVID-19: Guidance for SEVP Stakeholders, March 13, 2020 (emphasis added) \n26 \n(hereinafter the “March 13 Guidance,” and together with the March 9 Guidance, the \n“March Guidance”), attached as Rockwell Decl. Ex. B. \n27 \n3 Broadcast Message: COVID-19 and Fall 2020, No. 2007-01 (July 6, 2020) \n28  (hereinafter “July 6 Guidance”), attached as Rockwell Decl. Ex. C.  \n  8 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 11 of 35   Page ID #:121\n \n1  of the student-visa program, or the March Guidance. It ignores the ongoing COVID-\n2  19 crisis and the on-the-ground expertise of university officials as to the safest course \n3  for their communities. It fails to consider the extraordinary impact on students and the \n4  significant reliance interests created by the March Guidance. The July 6 policy change \n5  makes sense only as a cruel pretext to use SEVP students as leverage “to encourage \n6  schools to reopen”—which is the explanation for the policy given to reporters by \n7  Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli,4 consistent with the \n8  President’s July 6 tweet, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!”5 \n9  Plaintiffs are SEVP students who are in law school or graduate programs in \n10  California and will be irreparably harmed by the policy change. If they are forced to \n11  leave the country, they will face exorbitant financial costs and health risks to return to \n12  places where continuing their studies will be impractical, if not impossible. Contrary \n13  to what Defendants glibly suggest, they cannot simply transfer to a different school \n14  just one month before the semester starts. Even if it were possible to attend classes in-\n15  person, Plaintiffs cannot do so without risking exposing themselves to the coronavirus \n16  and thus risking their health and the health of others. \n17  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs now seek a temporary restraining order \n18  (“TRO”) preventing Defendants from implementing the July 6 policy change. \n19  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, as the policy change violates the \n20  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) in multiple ways, and so arbitrarily impairs \n21  students’ liberty and property interests as to violate due process. Plaintiffs have also \n22  shown irreparable harm and that the balance of hardships and public interest tip \n23  decisively in favor of a TRO to preserve the status quo. Accordingly, Plaintiffs \n24  respectfully request that their application be granted in full. \n                                           \n25  4See John Bowden, Cuccinelli Says Rule Forcing International Students to Return \nHome Will 'Encourage Schools to Reopen, The Hill (July 7, 2020), \n26  https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506248-cuccinelli-says-rule-forcing-\ninternational-students-to-return-home.

The F-1 Student Visa Program and Its Goal of Attracting \nInternational Students to Study in the United States \n3 \nFor decades, the United States has labeled students as “non-immigrants” and \n4 \noperated a student-visa program. Section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Immigration and \n5 \nNationality Act of 1952, as amended (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(F)(i), establishes \n6 \nthe current F-1 nonimmigrant classification for “bona fide student[s] qualified to \n7 \npursue a full course of study” at an academic institution certified by SEVP, which is a \n8 \nsubdivision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), within the \n9 \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See also 81 Fed. Reg. 13040, 13044-45 \n10 \n(Mar. 11, 2016) (providing background to statutory and regulatory history). The \n11 \ncurrent requirements for the F-1 student visa program, and the related ability to \n12 \nengage in optional practical training (“OPT”), are set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f). \n13 \nThe visa program exists not just for the benefit of the students but because of \n14 \n“the substantial economic, scientific, technological, and cultural benefits provided by \n15 \nthe F-1 nonimmigrant program generally.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 13047. “International \n16 \nstudents have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both \n17 \nthrough the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as \n18 \nby significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses \n19 \nthroughout the United States.” Id.; see also Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 18-20. For that \n20 \nreason, the United States “promotes U.S. higher education to students around the \n21 \nworld,” including through programs such as the State Department’s EducationUSA, \n22 \nwhich sets up “advising centers” around the world to persuade students to choose to \n23 \ncome to this country and assist qualified candidates in accessing U.S. higher education \n24 \nopportunities.6 \n25 \nAccording to studies cited by DHS, as of 2013, nearly 900,000 international \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n6 See U.S. Dep’t of State, EducationUSA, https://educationusa.state.gov/about-\neducationusa, https://educationusa.state.gov/educationusa-advising-centers. \n28 \n  10 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 13 of 35   Page ID #:123\n \n1  students were affiliated with U.S. colleges and universities, and they contributed $26.8 \n2  billion to the U.S. economy in the form of tuition, housing payments, and living \n3  expenses for themselves and family. 81 Fed. Reg. at 13047-48. The numbers have \n4  only grown since then, with over 1,090,000 international students attending higher \n5  education institutions in 2018 and collectively contributing $44.7 billion to the U.S. \n6  economy.7 In 2018, California hosted more than 300,000 nonimmigrant students, \n7  more than any other state.8  \n8 \nB.  The COVID-19 Crisis, and SEVP’s Initial, Appropriate Response \n9  In early March 2020, the world began to acknowledge the onset pf  what we \n10  know today is a global COVID-19 pandemic. Mishori Decl. ¶ 7. California’s \n11  institutions quickly responded. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals \n12  contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19 \n13  disease, through respiration (e.g., coughing, sneezing, or talking) and by touching and \n14  thereby contaminating surfaces. Id. ¶ 8. The primary interventions to stop the spread \n15  of coronavirus are (1) social distancing, (2) engaging in optimal hygiene practices, and \n16  (3) quarantining. Id. ¶ 25. \n17  In response to the growing crisis, on March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom \n18  declared a state of emergency.9 Within a week, on March 9, universities began \n19  suspending in-person instruction, including schools in the University of California \n20  (“UC”) system and the University of Southern California (“USC”).10 As the threat \n21  progressed, on March 19, Governor Newsom announced a statewide stay-at-home \n22 \n                                           \n23  7 See https://www.iie.org/Why-IIE/Announcements/2019/11/Number-of-International-\nStudents-in-the-United-States-Hits-All-Time-High. \n24 \n8 https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/sevisByTheNumbers2018.pdf. \n25  9 https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.4.20-Coronavirus-SOE-\nProclamation.pdf. \n26 \n10 See Richardson Decl. ¶ 5 (UCI); see also https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/03/09/as-\ncoronavirus-spreads-uc-berkeley-suspends-in-person-instruction/; https://covid-\n27 \n19.ucla.edu/transitioning-ucla-to-online-instruction; \nhttps://coronavirus.usc.edu/2020/03/10/update-to-university-policies-and-plans. \n28 \n  11 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 14 of 35   Page ID #:124\n \n1  order that, among other things, confirmed that universities could not continue \n2  operating in-person classes.11  \n3  Consistent with these unprecedented developments, on March 9, SEVP issued a \n4  Broadcast Message—the March 9 Guidance. Rockwell Decl. Ex. A. The purpose of \n5  the March 9 Guidance was to address the requirement that visa students maintain a \n6  “full course of study,” which by regulation generally precludes F-1 students from \n7  taking more than one class “on-line or through distance education and does not require \n8  the student’s physical attendance for classes.” 8 C.F.R. 212.4(f)(6)(i)(G). The March 9 \n9  Guidance recognized that “SEVP-certified schools may need to adapt their procedures \n10  and policies to address the significant public health concerns associated with the \n11  COVID-19 crisis.” Rockwell Decl. Ex. A, at 1. It assured schools and students that \n12  “SEVP is focused on ensuring that nonimmigrant students are able to continue to \n13  make normal progress in a full course of study as required by federal regulations,” and \n14  that “SEVP intends to be flexible with temporary adaptations.” Id. at 1. \n15  On March 13, President Trump declared a COVID-19 national emergency.12  \n16  On that same date, SEVP issued additional guidance (the March 13 Guidance) to \n17  address inquiries it had received concerning the “different scenarios” a school or \n18  student might face as the pandemic played out. Rockwell Decl. Ex. B at 1. In \n19  particular, SEVP assured stakeholders that, if a school closes temporarily but offers \n20  online instruction, SEVP will allow F-1 students to “count online classes towards a \n21  full course of study,” notwithstanding the limits in 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G). Id. The \n22  March 13 Guidance cautioned that this accommodation was “temporary” in that it was \n23  intended to be only in effect “for the duration of the emergency,” and could change as \n24  SEVP continued “to monitor the COVID-19 situation.” Id. at 1-2.  \n25 \n                                           \n26  11 See Executive Order N-33-20, Executive Dep’t State of California (March 19, \n2020). \n27 \n12 https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-\nemergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/. \n28 \n  12 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 15 of 35   Page ID #:125\n \n1  C.  The COVID-19 Emergency Continues, Yet Defendants Abruptly \nChange Course to Require In-Person Instruction \n2 \nWhile the spring semester has concluded, the COVID-19 emergency has not. \n3 \nMishori Decl. ¶ 40. Summer did not cause the virus to disappear, and the President \n4 \nhas not withdrawn the national emergency declaration. To the contrary, in California \n5 \nand elsewhere, COVID-19 infection and death rates remain consistent with—and \n6 \nindeed are exceeding—the levels when the March Guidance was issued. Id. ¶¶ 20-22. \n7 \nSchools have seen an increase in positive cases among students and faculty since June. \n8 \nRichardson Decl. ¶ 16. \n9 \nGiven these conditions and in reliance on the March Guidance, schools in \n10 \nCalifornia and across the country expended significant time and expense to assess and \n11 \ncraft plans for the Fall 2020 academic year aimed at protecting the health and safety of \n12 \nthe students, faculty and staff, while allowing students to attend classes. See, e.g., \n13 \nRichardson Decl. ¶¶ 15, 6-14, 22. After careful consideration, schools adopted various \n14 \neducation programs, which include online-only class schedules for some or all \n15 \nstudents. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. \n16 \nThe ongoing effects of the COVID-19 crisis are, unfortunately, not surprising. \n17 \nEven members of the State Department had recognized the possibility that “the fall \n18 \nsemester on U.S. campuses is largely conducted online,” yet continued “to encourage \n19 \ninternational students to choose U.S. institutions,” because “U.S. higher education’s \n20 \nacademic quality, rigor and values, including critical thinking and academic freedom, \n21 \nwill be fully maintained through its virtual offerings as well.”13 \n22 \nNotwithstanding the ongoing crisis, on July 6, 2020, Defendants abruptly \n23 \nreversed course and effectively rescinded the March Guidance. In the opening \n24 \nparagraph of the July 6 announcement, SEVP stated as follows: \n25 \n26                                             \n13 Statement of Caroline Casagrande, Bureau of Educ. & Cultural Affairs, U.S. Dept. \n27 \nof State, Apr. 22, 2020, https://educationusa.state.gov/us-higher-education-\nprofessionals/eca-das-casagrande-statement-academic-exchanges-and-covid19. \n28 \n  13 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 16 of 35   Page ID #:126\n \n1 \nTemporary procedural adaptations related to online courses \npermitted by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program \n2 \n(SEVP) during the height of the Coronavirus Disease \n3 \n(COVID-19) crisis will be modified for the fall 2020 \nsemester. There will still be accommodations to provide \n4 \nflexibility to schools and nonimmigrant students, but as \n5 \nmany institutions across the country reopen, there is a \nconcordant need to resume the carefully balanced \n6 \nprotections implemented by federal regulations.  \n7 \nRockwell Decl., Ex. C. at 114 With that preface, SEVP announced that it “is modifying \n8 \nthe temporary exemptions” announced in March. Under the new policy, nonimmigrant \n9 \nstudents “attending schools operating entirely online [for the fall] may not take a full \n10 \nonline course load and remain in the United States.” Id. Instead, they “must depart the \n11 \ncountry or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person \n12 \ninstruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face immigration consequences \n13 \nincluding, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceeding.” Id. The Guidance \n14 \nfurther states that, if a school begins the semester with in-person instruction, but then \n15 \nswitches to online-only instruction, students “must leave the country or take \n16 \nalternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status.” Id. at 2.  \n17 \nReflecting that the July 6 Guidance would have immediate effect, SEVP stated \n18 \nthat schools are required to notify SEVP by July 15, 2020 if they intend to only offer \n19 \nremote instruction. Id. (emphasis added). The Guidance also imposes on schools the \n20 \nnearly impossible burden of issuing, by August 4, new “Form I-20” certifications for \n21 \n“each” of their international students, confirming that each student is not taking an \n22 \nentirely online course load for the fall. Id. at 2; see also Richardson Decl. ¶ 26. \n23 \nAlso on July 6, at 2:40 p.m. Eastern Time, President Donald Trump tweeted his \n24 \nsupport for the opening of schools by stating, “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE \n25 \n                                           \n26  14 The paragraph continued by stating that DHS “publish the procedures and \nresponsibilities … in the near future as a Temporary Final Rule in the Federal \n27 \nRegister. This message is intended to provide additional time to facilitate the \nimplementation of these procedures.” Id. \n28 \n  14 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 17 of 35   Page ID #:127\n \n1  FALL!!!”15 The next day, Acting DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, in response to \n2  questions from reporters about the policy change, confirmed his view that, if a \n3  university is not holding in-person classes, then “[t]here isn’t a reason for a person \n4  holding a student visa to be present in the country;” he further acknowledged the real \n5  purpose behind the policy, explaining that the agency was setting the rules to \n6  “encourage schools to reopen.” Id. \n7  Also on July 7, in an apparent response to the uproar over the policy change, \n8  Defendants issued an FAQ purporting to provide a different rationale. It claimed, \n9  among other things, the policy was designed to “maximize flexibility for students to \n10  continue their studies, while minimizing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 by not \n11  admitting students into the country who do not need to be present to attend classes in-\n12  person.” Rockwell Decl. Ex. D. \n13 \nD.  Plaintiffs Are International Students Who Will Be Irreparably \nHarmed by the Policy Change \n14 \nPlaintiffs are international students currently enrolled in graduate degree \n15 \nprograms, including law schools, at prominent universities in southern California on \n16 \nF-1 student visas.

Decl. ¶ 9; Richardson Decl. ¶ 13. \n22 \nTransfer is not a realistic option. For Plaintiffs attending law school, it is not \n23 \nfeasible to transfer to a different school because, for example, the transfer deadline \n24 \neither had already passed prior to July 6 or is so imminent that students would have no \n25 \ntime to assemble the materials for their application. Zearfoss Decl. ¶¶ 4-7. Moreover, \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n15 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (July 6, 2020, 2:40 PM); see also \nDonald J.

Further, law \n3  schools and other postgraduate programs are not fungible, as they often serve specific \n4  markets or have other specializations. Id. ¶ 8. \n5  Thus, under the July 6 Guidance, Plaintiffs will be forced to leave the United \n6  States and be ripped from their communities and their academics. Their carefully-laid \n7  financial, health, employment, immigration, and personal plans will be upended. For \n8  example: \n9  Housing. By July 6, several Plaintiffs had already entered into leases and \n10  secured housing in reliance on their ability to be present in the United States during \n11  the fall term, regardless of how their schools decided to hold class.

If their schools reopen again during this coming \n17  academic year, they will incur additional moving costs, assuming they are even able to \n18  find housing on short notice. \n19  Travel. Multiple countries have shut their borders and banned all transnational \n20  flights due to the pandemic; others have specifically barred flights from the United \n21  States.16 As airline passengers, Plaintiffs would spend hours in a confined space \n22  surrounded by shared surfaces—exactly the kind of prolonged exposure that creates \n23  substantial risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. Mishori Decl. ¶ 36; W.R. Decl. \n24  ¶ 4. Further, travel to Plaintiffs’ home countries has become exorbitantly, and for \n25  some prohibitively, expensive. X.Y. Decl. ¶ 6; M.X. Decl. ¶ 6; W.R.

Richardson Decl. ¶ 23; Z.L. Decl. \n23  ¶ 5. Either way, students will be put at a substantial disadvantage compared to their \n24  classmates who are able to take the same classes during their normal waking hours. \n25  Richardson Decl. ¶ 23; Z.L.

These \n16  restrictions and impediments will make it difficult, if not impossible, for many \n17  Plaintiffs to continue their studies abroad.  \n18  Inequities in Employment and Training Opportunities. The July 6 Guidance \n19  also will effectively prevent Plaintiffs who are in law school from physically attending \n20  on campus interviews for summer employment. C.Y. Decl. ¶ 12. If schools decide to \n21  hold virtual on campus interview, Plaintiffs will have to interview in the middle of the \n22  night and compete against domestic students who are interviewing during normal \n23  business hours.

Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n24  555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 989-90 (9th Cir. 2017).  \n25  Under the Ninth Circuit’s “sliding scale” approach, “a stronger showing of one \n26  element may offset a weaker showing of another.” Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 989-90 \n27  (quoting Pimentel v. Dreyfus, 670 F.3d 1096, 1105 (9th Cir. 2012) (per curiam)).

Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017) \n5  (quoting All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2011)). \n6  ARGUMENT \n7  I.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS \n8  As set forth in Plaintiffs’ Complaint and below, the July 6 Guidance violates the \n9  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706, because it is arbitrary and \n10  capricious in failing to consider the reliance interests of student visa holders and \n11  failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the change in policy, notwithstanding the \n12  fact that the COVID-19 crisis is continuing and, indeed, surging. The July 6 Guidance \n13  was also issued without meeting notice-and-comment requirements for actions \n14  affecting substantial rights and is so arbitrarily imposed as to violate due process.  \n15 \nA.  The July 6 Policy Change Is Arbitrary and Capricious, in Violation \nof the APA. \n16 \nThe APA provides a mechanism for courts to review final agency action, 5 \n17 \nU.S.C. § 702, and it directs courts “[to] hold unlawful and set aside” actions that are \n18 \n“arbitrary” or “capricious,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). See Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1905. At \n19 \nits core, the APA requires agencies “to engage in ‘reasoned decisionmaking.’” Id. \n20 \n(citation omitted). Agency action will be found arbitrary and capricious where the \n21 \nagency has “‘failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.’” Id. at 1910 \n22 \n(quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \n23 \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)); see also Amerijet Int’l, Inc. v. Pistole, 753 F.3d \n24 \n1343, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining that it is “a fundamental requirement of \n25 \nadministrative law … that an agency set forth its reasons for decision[s]; an agency’s \n26 \nfailure to do so constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action”) (citation omitted).  \n27 \nHere, the July 6 policy change qualifies as final agency action under the APA. \n28 \n  20 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 23 of 35   Page ID #:133\n \n1  It announces a definitive decision that SEVP procedures and responsibilities “will be \n2  modified for the fall 2020 semester” through publication of a Temporary Rule, and it \n3  immediately alters students’ and schools’ obligations by telling them what they “must” \n4  do under the new rule. Rockwell Decl. Ex. C, at 1. For schools, the July 6 Guidance \n5  directs that they “must complete an operational change plan … no later than \n6  Wednesday, July 15, 2020.” Id. at 2 (emphasis in original). For students, it instructs \n7  that, if their program will be online only, then they “must depart the country or take \n8  other measures … or potentially face immigration consequences including, but not \n9  limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.” Id. at 1. In these respects, the July 6 \n10  Guidance squarely satisifies the conditions for finality, as it cannot be considered \n11  “merely tentative or interlocutory,” and it is clearly intended to trigger changes in \n12  schools’ and students’ conduct and obligations, as well as the legal consequences that \n13  flow from them. Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-178 (1997); see also U.S. Army \n14  Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1810 (2016).  \n15  As explained below, Defendants’ action should be set aside as arbitrary and \n16  capricious, as it is devoid of reasoned decisionmaking and fails to consider important \n17  aspects of the problems. \n18 \n1.  Defendants Failed to Adequately Consider the Reliance \nInterests of Student Visa Holders. \n19 \nIn Regents, the Supreme Court explained that when an agency changes policy in \n20 \na way that affects substantial interests, it must “turn square corners.” 140 S. Ct. at \n21 \n1909 (internal quotation omitted). That includes considering “whether there was \n22 \n‘legitimate reliance’” on the prior policy, even if the prior policy was merely an \n23 \nexception to the enforcement of the law as written and did not purport to provide any \n24 \npermanent rights. Id. at 1913. In other words, when an agency is “not writing on a \n25 \nblank slate,” it is “required to assess whether there were reliance interests, determine \n26 \nwhether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy \n27 \nconcerns.” Id. at 1915 (emphasis added). The failure to do so, by itself, renders an \n28 \n  21 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 24 of 35   Page ID #:134\n \n1  action arbitrary and capricious. Id. at 1913-15; see also Encino Motorcars, LLC v. \n2  Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016).  \n3  Here, when SEVP announced the March 9 Guidance, it did so out of \n4  recognition that “SEVP-certified schools may need to adapt their procedures and \n5  policies to address the significant public health concerns associated with the COVID-\n6  19 crisis.” Rockwell Ex. A, at 1. And it assured students and schools that “SEVP \n7  intends to be flexible with temporary adaptations.” Id. Then, in the March 13 \n8  Guidance—when President Trump declared a national emergency—SEVP specifically \n9  advised that, if schools transitioned to online only instruction, students could still \n10  count those online courses toward their “full course of study.” Rockwell Ex. B, at 1.  \n11  To be sure, the March Guidance reflected that the accommodations for online \n12  instruction were “temporary,” in that they were intended to be “only in effect for the \n13  duration of the emergency.” Id. (emphasis added). Similarly, SEVP advised that the \n14  guidance “may be subject to change” due to “the fluid nature of this difficult \n15  situation,” and that “SEVP will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and will \n16  adjust its guidance as needed.” But the plain meaning of those caveats is that any \n17  changes in policy would be based on changes in the COVID-19 situation. Nothing \n18  suggested that Defendants would rescind the policy while the emergency was still \n19  ongoing, even though students and schools are still facing “the significant public \n20  health concerns” that motivated the initial policy.  \n21  Schools acted in reliance on the March Guidance when, facing ongoing health \n22  risks, they made the difficult decision to continue with virtual instruction during the \n23  fall semester. Richardson Decl. ¶ 15. And students, including Plaintiffs, acted in \n24  reliance on the March Guidance in committing to housing and planning for the fall \n25  semester, believing that they would be able to continue living and studying in the \n26  United States, even if the continuing spread of the coronavirus required virtual \n27  programming. A.G. Decl. ¶ 16; C.Y. Decl. ¶ 6; M.X. Decl. ¶ 4; X.Y. Decl. ¶ 4; Z.W. \n28  Decl. ¶ 4. See Background Part D, supra. \n  22 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 25 of 35   Page ID #:135\n \n1  Yet Defendants took none of this into account in issuing the July 6 Guidance. It \n2  is undisputed that the President’s emergency proclamation remains in effect, and the \n3  July 6 Guidance does not suggest that the public health crisis has materially lessened, \n4  such that schools and students should have expected a policy change. Defendants also \n5  nowhere accounted for the fact that, by July 6, many schools had already committed \n6  to online instruction for the fall. Nor did Defendants consider the fact that students \n7  had already committed to their fall program and, with barely a month before the start \n8  of classes, likely would have no ability to transfer to a comparable program.  \n9  If Defendants had determined upfront that in-person learning would be required \n10  in the fall, regardless of the COVID-19 situation, they could have said so. But having \n11  given students assurances that the March Guidance would be in effect for “the \n12  duration of the emergency,” Defendants were not writing on blank slate and could not \n13  change the policy without at least considering students’ legitimate reliance interests. \n14  Defendants’ failure to do so, by itself, renders the policy change arbitrary and \n15  capricious and therefore void. \n16 \n2.  Defendants Failed to Provide a Reasoned Explanation. \n17  Even if one puts the reliance interests aside, the July 6 Guidance is still \n18  unsupported by any adequate, reasoned explanation and manifestly failed to consider \n19  important aspects of the problem. Indeed, to the extent Defendants have provided an \n20  explanation, it is patently insufficient and likely pretextual. \n21  1. At the outset, the July 6 Guidance is devoid of any reasoned explanation at \n22  all. At less than three pages long, the July 6 Guidance is replete with directions on \n23  what schools and students “must” do, but it absolutely no discussion – none at all – of \n24  any factors that Defendants considered.   \n25  The closest the July 6 Guidance comes to providing a policy explanation is the \n26  opaque assertion that there is a “need to resume the carefully balanced protections \n27  implemented by federal regulations.” Rockwell Decl. Ex. C. But this is merely \n28 \n  23 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 26 of 35   Page ID #:136\n \n1  conclusory: it fails even to articulate what the “need” is or what those “carefully \n2  balanced protections” are, let alone to explain what the “need” is now “to resume” \n3  them. Id. Presumably, the latter statement is referring to the regulations’ definition of \n4  a “full course of study” as involving mostly in-person classes, 8 C.F.R. § \n5  214.2(f)(6)(i)(G)—a requirement that ensures that visa student have a bona fide reason \n6  for being in the United States and are not using enrollment in pay-to-attend online \n7  courses as an excuse to immigrate here. Those concerns are entirely inapplicable to \n8  Plaintiffs and other SEVP students who came to this country to attend competitive and \n9  well-established universities, and who would be committed to a full course of in-\n10  person study but for the unprecedented conditions created by the novel coronavirus. \n11  Meanwhile, the July 7 FAQ provides a different, but equally deficient, rationale \n12  for the shift in guidance. The July 7 FAQ did not refer to the “carefully balanced \n13  protections” of federal regulations, but instead suggested that the policy was \n14  implemented “to maximize flexibility for students to continue their studies, while \n15  minimizing the risk of the risk of transmission of COVID-19 by not admitting \n16  students into the country who do not need to be present to attend classes in-person.” \n17  Rockwell Decl. Ex. D, at 3.  \n18  That makes no sense. First, this “explanation” does not account for the fact that \n19  the policy change impacts students already in the United States. As to this group, the \n20  July Guidance pressures students to attend in-person classes, which would increase \n21  the risk of transmission―precisely the opposite objective the new Guidance purports \n22  to achieve with respect to students currently overseas. Second, even as to students \n23  currently overseas, the July 6 Guidance specifically invites them to return to the U.S. \n24  by transferring to other schools providing in-class instruction. Thus, even as to that \n25  group, the policy is not rationally designed to limit the transmission of COVID-19.  \n26  Thus, if anything, the July 7 FAQ only confirms the lack of reasoned \n27  decisionmaking, as it is neither consistent with the reasons given in the July 6 \n28  Guidance, nor is it internally coherent or rationally related to the policy change. \n  24 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 27 of 35   Page ID #:137\n \n1  2. The lack of a reasoned explanation for the July 6 policy change alone \n2  establishes that it is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Regents, 140 S. Ct. at \n3  1915. But the July 6 Guidance is independently arbitrary and capricious because it is \n4  devoid of evidence that Defendants “pa[id] attention to the advantages and the \n5  disadvantages of [their] decisions.” Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015). \n6  First, nothing in the Guidance purports to consider current COVID-19 \n7  conditions, or their ongoing impact on the health and safety of students. Indeed, the \n8  words “health” and “safety” do not even appear in the July 6 Guidance. Obviously, \n9  students will be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 if they are forced to attend in-\n10  person instruction. Mishori Decl. ¶¶ 25-35. Nor do Defendants acknowledge that \n11  many students will have pre-existing conditions, or live with people with pre-existing \n12  conditions, thus making in-person attendance particularly dangerous for them.  \n13  Second, while the July 6 Guidance asserts that “many institutions across the \n14  country are reopen[ing],” Rockwell Ex. C, it ignores that in many other areas, the \n15  COVID-19 crisis is worsening and may lead to further lockdowns. Even if certain \n16  institutions are re-opening, Defendants nowhere consider that the safety and \n17  advisability of reopening any given school will depend on numerous school-specific \n18  factors. Those include, for example, local COVID-19 spread, testing capabilities, the \n19  particular school’s facilities and typical class sizes, whether a significant number of \n20  students must rely on public transit to attend class, and whether in-person capabilities \n21  should be prioritized for certain portions of the student body (such as at UCI Law \n22  School, where the school committed to providing in-person instruction for first-year \n23  law students, even as it decided to go online only for second- and third-year students). \n24  For these reasons, the on-the-ground school administrators are best positioned to \n25  determine what is safe, feasible and most academically appropriate, for their given \n26  student body. But Defendants did not consider any of these school-specific factors, or \n27  how their policy change would disrupt the academic preparation for the upcoming \n28  semester. See Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 6-14, 17. \n  25 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 28 of 35   Page ID #:138\n \n1  Third, the July 6 Guidance does not take into account the extreme hardship and \n2  disruption imposed on the students. International students such as Plaintiffs came to \n3  the United States based on their strong academic qualifications. They obtained \n4  admission to competitive universities and worked diligently toward their degrees as \n5  part of a student-visa program that exists not just for their benefit, but the benefit of \n6  their academic institutions and the country as whole. See Richardson Decl. ¶¶ 18-20. \n7  If students are forced to leave the country, they will suffer extreme financial cost and \n8  will put their health at risk, and many students simply will not be able to continue \n9  their education while abroad. See supra at Background Part D; see also Part II, infra. \n10  While the July 6 Guidance also implies that students could simply transfer to a school \n11  with in-person instruction, Rockwell Ex. C, that clearly is not true for Plaintiffs and \n12  many other students. See generally Zearfoss Decl.; see also Z.W. Decl. ¶ 9; Z.L. Decl. \n13  ¶ 11; C.Y. Decl. ¶ 13; M.X. Decl. ¶ 8; A.G. Decl. ¶ 14; X.Y. Decl. ¶ 10. It is not only \n14  arbitrary and capricious but unconscionable for Defendants to disregard the ways in \n15  which the policy change jeopardizes the students’ health and educational interests—\n16  and indeed throws their entirely lives into disarray—based on circumstances beyond \n17  the students’ control. \n18  3. While it is unnecessary to go any further in the analysis, there are other bases \n19  for concluding that any purported justifications given for the July 6 Guidance are \n20  purely pretextual. As the Supreme Court has recently explained, “in order to permit \n21  meaningful judicial review, an agency must ‘disclose the basis’ of its action.” Dep’t of \n22  Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2573 (2019). “The reasoned explanation \n23  requirement of administrative law, after all, is meant to ensure that agencies offer \n24  genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by \n25  courts and the interested public. Accepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose \n26  of the enterprise.”  Id. at 2575-76. Thus, agency action will violate the APA if there is \n27  “a significant mismatch” between the actual reasons for agency action and the \n28  rationale provided. \n  26 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 29 of 35   Page ID #:139\n \n1  Given the absence of any explanation within the July 6 Guidance for the abrupt \n2  policy change, the true motivation lies in the contemporaneous public statements of \n3  Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Secretary of DHS, as well as the President himself. Mr. \n4  Cuccinelli admitted that the policy change was made “to encourage schools to \n5  reopen,” Bowden, supra n. 4. In other words, by threatening international students \n6  with removal proceedings, he could strong arm universities into reopening their \n7  campuses in conformance with the President’s agenda. While politicized influence is \n8  not alone a reason to set aside agency action, courts can and should reject agency \n9  action that treats innocents as political pawns and puts both their health and \n10  educational interests at risk, simply to serve an ulterior motive.  \n11  For these reasons, the July 6 Guidance effects a policy change that is arbitrary \n12  and capricious. Defendants thus are likely to prevail on the merits, and the Court \n13  should issue the TRO. \n14 \nB.  The July 6 Policy Change Violates the APA’s Notice-and-Comment \nProcedures.   \n15 \nThe policy change violates the APA for a separate and independent reason. \n16 \nWhen an agency is promulgating a new substantive rule, it must follow notice-and-\n17 \ncomment ruling procedures. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(4), 553. That includes (1) publication of \n18 \nnotice of the proposed rule in the Federal Register; (2) a period for interested \n19 \nindividuals to comment on the proposed rule; and (3) publication of the adopted rule \n20 \nnot less than thirty days before its effective date.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c), (d) (2006); \n21 \nMora-Meraz v. Thomas, 601 F.3d 933, 939 (9th Cir. 2010). If a new substantive rule \n22 \nis promulgated “without observance of procedure required by law,” then it must be set \n23 \naside. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n24 \nThe July 6 policy change violates these requirements. It reflects a new \n25 \nsubstantive rule because it redefines what students must do “to maintain their F-1 and \n26 \nM-1 nonimmigrant status during the COVID-19 emergency”—i.e., they must appear \n27 \nfor in-person instruction “to remain in lawful status” or else “face immigration \n28 \n  27 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 30 of 35   Page ID #:140\n \n1  consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.” \n2  Rockwell Decl. Ex. C, at 1. The policy change therefore “impose[s] obligations, or \n3  effect[s] a change in existing law pursuant to authority delegated by Congress.” Hemp \n4  Indus. Ass'n v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 333 F.3d 1082, 1087 (9th Cir. 2003); see \n5  also Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006, 1014 (9th Cir. 1987).   \n6  In announcing the July 6 policy change, Defendants indicated that a \n7  “Temporary Final Rule” would soon be published in the Federal Register, further \n8  confirming Defendants’ intent to engage in rulemaking changing the SEVP \n9  “procedures and responsibilities” during the COVID-19 crisis. Notably, however, \n10  there is no suggestion that Defendants intend to engage in any notice-and-comment \n11  period. To the contrary, and as noted above, the July 6 Guidance is clear that \n12  Defendants expect schools and students to comply with new rules now, with students \n13  otherwise being subject to removal proceedings.  \n14  Had Defendants complied with the APA’s require procedures, they would have \n15  received comments from schools and students alike, reflecting how ill-conceived, \n16  unfair, and harmful the policy change is. Regardless, the procedural violation itself \n17  requires the Court to set the policy change aside. See Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr. v. \n18  Shalala, 939 F. Supp. 1457 (C.D. Cal. 1996) (citing Linoz v. Heckler, 800 F.2d 871, \n19  878 (9th Cir. 1986)); 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). Accordingly, Defendants have shown a \n20  likelihood of success on this issue as well. \n21 \nC.  The July 6 Guidance Violates Due Process \n22  Even apart from if the APA violation, the July 6 Guidance imposes an arbitrary \n23  and irrational deprivation of Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected liberty and property \n24  interest, in violation of the Due Process Clause.  \n25  “[T]he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary \n26  action of government, whether the fault lies in a denial of fundamental procedural \n27  fairness, or in the exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service \n28 \n  28 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 31 of 35   Page ID #:141\n \n1  of a legitimate governmental objective.” Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, \n2  845-46 (1998) (citations omitted). The Due Process Clause forbids the deprivation of \n3  “life, liberty, or property, without the due process of law,” and applies to all ‘persons’ \n4  within the United States, including noncitizens like Plaintiffs who are in the country. \n5  U.S. Constitution, Art. V; see Zadvyadas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (“[T]he \n6  Due Process Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within the United States ... whether their \n7  presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”). \n8  Here, Plaintiffs have complied with the rigorous SEVP requirements and have \n9  secured admission to highly competitive institutions while investing time, money, and \n10  energy into pursuing their degrees in this county. They have a cognizable liberty \n11  interest in not being arbitrarily subject to removal proceedings. See Chew v. Colding, \n12  344 U.S. 590 (1953). And they have a cognizable property interest in their visas and \n13  being able to continue the educational endeavors in which they have invested so \n14  heavily, in reliance on the integrity of the student-visa program and their ability to \n15  remain in the United States so as long as they remain committed to pursuing the full \n16  course of study offered by their SEVP-certified institutions. See Board of Regents of \n17  State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972) (it is the purpose of the institution of \n18  “property” to “protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, \n19  reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined.”). \n20  For all of the reasons explained above, the July 6 Guidance is so arbitrary and \n21  irrational as to violate due process’s protection of these constitutional interests. The \n22  July 6 Guidance is not rationally related to mitigating the spread of the coronavirus, \n23  because forcing students to attend in-person instruction will only increase the \n24  likelihood of transmission. Nor can the July 6 Guidance be justified as responding to \n25  changing conditions, because it was imposed notwithstanding the fact that the public \n26  health emergency continues. Finally, the date it was issued—after schools and \n27  students had already committed to their fall programs, and with no meaningful \n28  opportunity to make alternative arrangements—confirms the arbitrariness of \n  29 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 32 of 35   Page ID #:142\n \n1  Defendants’ actions, all in total disregard for Plaintiffs’ substantial and \n2  constitutionally protected interests. While courts use counsel and restraint when \n3  considering substantive due process claims, “history does not counsel abandonment” \n4  of all such claims particularly when, as here, government policies are so obviously \n5  arbitrary and serve no rational governmental interest.  See Moore v. City of East \n6  Cleveland Ohio, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977). Accordingly, Plaintiffs have established a \n7  likelihood of success on this claim as well. \n8 \nII.  PLAINTIFFS WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT \nEMERGENCY RELIEF.  \n9 \nPlaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the July 6 Guidance is allowed to stand.  \n10 \nThere is no safe or realistic option for Plaintiffs to stay in the country to \n11 \ncomplete their studies. Transferring to a school offering in person classes is not a \n12 \nrealistic possibility at this late stage, with deadlines fast approaching and with schools \n13 \nalready struggling to implement social distancing and online learning plans that will \n14 \nprotect the health and safety of their existing student body. See generally Zearfoss \n15 \nDecl. In any event, attending in-person classes in the midst of a raging pandemic \n16 \nwould subject the Plaintiffs and the people around them –including high-risk family \n17 \nmembers – to risk of infection with COVID-19. Mishori Decl. ¶ 25-34. Thus, as a \n18 \npractical matter, if the July Guidance stands, Plaintiffs will be forced to leave the \n19 \ncountry, incurring numerous harmful impacts on Plaintiffs. \n20 \nFor one, Plaintiffs cannot practically continue their education if they are forced \n21 \nto leave the country. Several Plaintiffs have limited internet access and limits imposed \n22 \nby the government of their home country on the computer tools that their schools use \n23 \nto communicate and collaborate, preventing them from fully accessing the curriculum. \n24 \nTo the extent Plaintiff could access class remotely, the difference in time zones would \n25 \nrequire them to attend classes in the middle of the night or lose the opportunity to \n26 \nactively participate in class by attending recorded sessions. Plaintiffs also will be \n27 \nseverely limited in their opportunities to participate in clinics or pro bono work, which \n28 \n  30 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 33 of 35   Page ID #:143\n \n1  impacts their academic standing. These limitations will disadvantage Plaintiffs with \n2  respect to job and training opportunities. See supra at Background Part D. \n3  Further, Plaintiffs will face extreme financial losses and hardship if they are \n4  forced to return to their home countries at this late stage. Plaintiffs have already \n5  signed leases and put down money on housing that would be lost; they would have to \n6  incur travel and moving expenses not only to move back to their home countries, but \n7  also to return to the U.S. if their schools return to in person classes. Plaintiffs who \n8  have purchased U.S. health insurance also would lose both the money they invested \n9  and the benefit of that insurance–in the midst of a global pandemic. See supra at \n10  Background Part D. \n11  Traveling back to their home countries may also be extremely difficult for \n12  certain Plaintiffs. Multiple countries have banned all transnational flights in response \n13  to the pandemic, and others—including China the home country of several \n14  Plaintiffs—require incoming travelers to quarantine at their own expense for two \n15  weeks upon arrival. Moreover, the travel itself would expose Plaintiffs to healthy \n16  risks, as lengthy transnational flights present multiple infection risks. See supra at \n17  Background Part D. \n18  Finally, Plaintiffs will suffer severe personal hardships if the July Guidance \n19  were allowed to stand, including separation from spouses, partners, family and \n20  friends. Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer stress and anxiety at the \n21  prospect of being deported, losing their expected educational and employment \n22  opportunities, and the detrimental and even devastating financial burden of being \n23  forced out of the country. See supra at Background Part D. \n24 \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS AND PUBLIC INTEREST TIP \nSHARPLY IN FAVOR OF EMERGENCY RELIEF. \n25 \nThe final factors in evaluating a TRO or preliminary injunction involve the \n26 \nbalance of hardships and public interest—factors that generally merge when the \n27 \nGovernment is a party. See League of Wilderness Defenders v. Connaughton, 752 \n28 \n  31 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 34 of 35   Page ID #:144\n \n1  F.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014). Here, the balance of hardships and public interest tip \n2  sharply in favor of emergency relief.  \n3  Plaintiffs are students whom the United States invited and encouraged to come \n4  here to study. They have invested time, money, and energy into their courses of study, \n5  and obviously would be attending classes in person, but for exceptional circumstances \n6  beyond their control. Defendants’ threat to deport them thrown their lives—and the \n7  lives of other international students—into complete disarray, impacting their \n8  educational pursuits, their financial well-being, and the health and safety of \n9  themselves, their families, and their communities.  \n10  On the flip side, Defendants have not identified any material interest supporting \n11  the policy. Rather, the very point of the policy change is to impose severe hardship on \n12  international students to leverage schools into reopening. See Bowden, supra n.4. \n13  Even were that a valid government interest, it proves that the balance of hardships tips \n14  decisively in Plaintiffs’ favor. Moreover, the Government “cannot suffer harm from \n15  an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice,” Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d \n16  1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013), and the “public interest is served by compliance with the \n17  APA.” East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 950 F.3d 1242, 1280-81 (9th Cir. \n18  2020) (quoting  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018)). \n19 \nCONCLUSION \n20  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue a \n21  TRO enjoining Defendants’ implementation of the July 6 Guidance. Such TRO should \n22  include requiring Defendants to issue a further broadcast message that the July 6  \n   \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  32 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-01220-CJC-KES   Document 16   Filed 07/14/20   Page 35 of 35   Page ID #:145\n \n1  policy change and any related compliance obligations have been enjoined, pending \n2  resolution on the merits.  \n3   \nDATED: July 14, 2020  By:  /s/ David R.

(Dkt. 1 [Complaint].)  The July 6 Guidance barred student visa holders from remaining in \nthe United States during the upcoming fall semester if their universities cancelled in-person \nclasses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Four days after filing suit, Plaintiffs applied for \na temporary restraining order that would enjoin Defendants from implementing the July 6 \nGuidance.  (Dkt. 16 [TRO Application, hereinafter “TRO”].)  Later that same day, however, \nDefendants rescinded the challenged Guidance.  (Dkt. 18.)  Defendants’ rescission of the July 6 \nGuidance was finalized on July 24, 2020 when the United States Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) issued updated guidance confirming that it will “abide by SEVP guidance \noriginally issued in March 2020” which “enables schools and students to engage in distance \nlearning in excess of regulatory limits due to the public health emergency generated by COVID-\n19.”  (Dkt. 46-1 [July 24 Broadcast Message].) \n \nNow before the Court are Plaintiffs’ application for a temporary restraining order (TRO), \nPlaintiffs’ amended application for a temporary restraining order (Dkt. 36 [hereinafter “Amended \nTRO”].), and Defendants’ motion to dismiss, (Dkt. 45 [hereinafter “Mot.”].).

(See Mot.)  Plaintiffs \noppose that motion and request leave to amend their Complaint so that they can clarify the relief \nthey continue to seek.  (Id. at 3.)  The Court finds that such amendments are necessary so that the \noperative pleading aligns with the current state of affairs.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  Plaintiffs are hereby ORDERED to file an \namended pleading that sets forth the relief they continue to seek by August 14, 2020.  The \nhearing on Defendants’ motion set for August 24, 2020 is hereby vacated and taken off calendar.   \n \n \njy \n \nMINUTES FORM 11 \nCIVIL-GEN                         Initials of Deputy Clerk GGA \n ",
