As to CFMG, the parties will arrange a site visit to take place after October 21, will schedule depositions of the two plaintiffs with individual damages claims (to take place after the next settlement conference, and presumably in December or January), and will update the court by email by 10/15/2019 about their progress.

          "description": "Minute Entry for proceedings held before Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler: Settlement Conference held on 2/27/2023. The court had a settlement conference. The non-monetary (Rule 23(b)) case against the County settled. The court worked out a process to finalize the non-monetary cases against Wellpath and Aramark as follows: (1) Wellpath will send policies and NHHC by next Monday, March 6, and the plaintiffs will respond back ten days later (including whether they want an in-person meeting with N.P. Possani, and (2) the plaintiffs will send a draft back to Aramark by next Monday, and Aramark will then reply with proposed menus. Given the pending class-certification motion, the court sets an overall time period of three weeks to resolve the non-monetary components. The non-monetary case will not resolve on a class basis and instead will resolve in the form of non-monetary relief. As to the damages cases for the individual plaintiffs, the case to the extent it involves food settled against the County and Aramark, subject to the contingency of finalizing the non-monetary piece. As to the damages case against the County, the County said that it would email the plaintiffs on February 27 with their summary of the claims against the County that remain. The parties will confer on Wednesday, March 1, and update the court. Assuming the County is correct, the court proposed a settlement number to resolve the County piece. If all of this works, then the only remaining claims will be the monetary claims against Wellpath, and the court will continue to work with the parties to resolve those. Total Time in Court: 4 hours, 34 minutes. Digital Recording Time: 3:56 - 4:04, matter transcribed by Peggy Schuerger of Ad Hoc Reporting. Plaintiffs' Attorney: Yolanda Huang. Also appearing: Plaintiffs Christine Zepeda and Jaclyn Mohrbacher.Defendants' Attorneys: Peter G. Bertling, Charles J. Reitmeyer, and Temitayo Peters. Also appearing: Chris Bowker via Zoom, Rick Huking, Jennifer Solopow, Lt. Tya Modeste, Lt. Leticia Davis, Captain April Luckett-Fahimi, Patricia Atkinson and Ken Maiolini and Ben Oram via Zoom.

    "summary": "<p>On January 4, 2018, six women prisoners filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging systematic, misogynistic mistreatment of women prisoners at the Alameda County Jail in Santa Rita, California. The plaintiffs sued Alameda County, the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and California Forensic Medical Group (CFMG) under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law. Represented by private counsel, they sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the complaint alleges that pregnant women prisoners were denied medical attention and other accommodations including weather-appropriate clothing, nutritious food, feminine hygiene products, and fresh air. The specific conduct targeted toward pregnant women took place within an environment marked by general hostility toward women prisoners and indifference to women&rsquo;s medical and hygienic needs. Further, the complaint alleged that the Alameda County Jail systematically discriminated against the women prisoners, compared to men prisoners, in access to reasonable facilities and services. In the complaint, the women prisoners sought recognition of class certification consisting of a main class of women prisoners with a sub-class of pregnant prisoners. The plaintiffs claimed that the conduct of the Alameda County Jail staff violated women prisoners&rsquo; rights protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day that the initial complaint was filed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent further harm to the pregnant plaintiffs. The women prisoners also sought relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys&rsquo; fees for the litigation. The case proceeded before Judge James Donato.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The plaintiffs elaborated on the allegations in the original complaint of the mistreatment against pregnant women prisoners and discrimination against women prisoners in general. The second amended complaint also added additional causes of action under California state law. The second amended complaint delineated the named plaintiffs into various groups: current women prisoners, women who were formerly imprisoned, pregnant prisoners currently in custody, and formerly pregnant prisoners who suffered a miscarriage due to mistreatment while in custody. The complaint also identified additional named defendants beyond the Alameda County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and individuals employed therein, including the California Forensic Medical Group, retained to provide medical services to prisoners and Aramark Correctional Services, a for-profit food services provider at the Jail.</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint also amended the relief sought by the women prisoners. The plaintiffs requested that the court certify the plaintiff class of women prisoners and the subclass of pregnant women prisoners, and that the court issue emergency remedy, by decree, to ensure that the women prisoners receive the medical care and other accommodations they needed to be safe while in custody at the Alameda County Jail. Finally, in addition to the injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages requested in the original complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the court affirmatively direct the defendants to fully comply with all state statutes and regulations regarding medical treatment, nutrition, activities, and personal hygiene for women prisoners.</p>\r\n<p>On December 31, 2018, one named plaintiff moved to relate the case to <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upshaw v. County of Alameda</a>. The parties began engaging in settlement negotiations and entered an agreement in principle on May 14, 2018. Settlement proceedings were heard by Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler. The parties initially agreed to resolve money damages and other substantive relief and the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw the motion for class certification. The parties held a number of settlement conferences between May 14, 2018 and December 12, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>A named plaintiff moved to relate the case to Gonzalez v. Ahern on May 7, 2019. Though opposed by the defendants, on May 15, 2020, the court related this case to Gonzalez v. Ahern. For further information, refer to the Clearinghouse page, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17341\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available at this link</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On November 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They filed a fourth amended complaint on April 6, 2021, adding Well-Path Management as a party to the case as a successor of CFMG. The complaint also added Aramark Correctional Services as a defendant, a private contractor who contracted with the County to operate kitchens at Santa Rita Jail. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the fourth amended complaint between April 20-30, 2021. While the motions remained pending before the court, a settlement conference was held on April 4, 2022, in which the parties were unable to reach a settlement.</p>\r\n<p>From September 30, 2022, to October 3, 2022, the defendants filed various motions for summary judgment. Prior to a hearing on the summary judgment motions, the court held another settlement conference on February 27, 2023. Following the conference, the non-monetary claims against the County were settled in a private settlement agreement. The court also implemented a process for settling the non-monetary claims against Aramark and Well-Path, and proposed a monetary amount for the damages claims against the County. The monetary claims against Well-Path remained pending, the parties having been unable to reach an agreement on an amount. On April 4, 2023, the monetary claims against the County, as well as the monetary and non-monetary claims against Aramark, were settled in full in a private settlement agreement. Both the monetary and non-monetary claims against Well-Path were unable to settle. The court vacated a scheduled settlement conference, stating that the court had exhausted its ability to help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of December 2023, the trial remained pending, and litigation remains ongoing.</p>",

Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 1   Filed 01/04/18   Page 2 of 18\n \nINTRODUCTION \n1 \n1. This case arises from a strong and highly reprehensible pattern and practice of aggressively \n2 \nmisogynist, apparently programmatic, maltreatment of women prisonersโso severe as to \n3 \nhave resulted in two recent miscarriages, and a third woman giving birth, alone and \n4 \nunattended, in a solitary confinement cellโat the Alameda County jail at Santa Rita, \n5 \nCalifornia.  Several of the named plaintiffs (including those three) complain of specific, \n6 \npurposeful and aggravated violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth and \n7  Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and parallel provisions of the California \n8  Constitution, detailed within, resulting in serious injury and deprivation under federal and \n9  state civil rights laws.   \n2. At any given time, Alameda County has approximately 250 women prisoners under its custody \n10 \nand control.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that of these 250 women prisoners, at \n11 \nany given moment, approximately 10 are pregnant, and that over 2500 women with 150 of \n12 \nwhom are pregnant, cycle through Santa Rita Jail in a year.  \n13 \n3. Plaintiffs Jaclyn Mohrbacher, Erin Ellis, Dominique Jackson, are three pregnant, female \n14 \nprisoners, currently incarcerated in Santa Rita Jail, who urgently seek emergency relief \n15 \nagainst defendants because they are pregnant, two of them four or five months pregnant and \n16 \nexperiencing frequent โspottingโ and bleeding from their vaginas, but have been repeatedly \n17  abused by being held in isolation cells, kept outdoors without sufficient warm clothing, and \n18  subjected to repeated accusations of drug abuse and strip searched.  In concert with this abuse, \n19  plaintiffs and proposed class members are denied medical attention, denied required \nmedication and all other needed accommodation โincluding warm clothing, blankets, healthy \n20 \nnutritious and sufficient food, fresh air, etcโby defendant staff members.  Instead, defendants \n21 \nhave repeatedly demanded that plaintiffs agree to have an abortion, accused said plaintiffs of \n22 \nbeing a drug addict, and refused all other recognition and assistance for each plaintiffโs \n23 \ndelicate condition.  Other pregnant womenโincluding those who miscarriedโhave similarly \n24 \nbeen scorned, branded and mistreated in the jail in recent timesโto a further, under a regime \n25 \nmarked by intense general hostility to women prisoners, and studied indifference to their \n26 \nserious medical and hygienic needs. \n27  4. .

These women also seek injunctive relief, under the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth \n6 \nAmendments requiring a total cessation of inhumane and sexually biased treatment and forms \n7  of treatment of women prisoners by defendants, and effective, outside monitoringโon behalf \n8  of themselves and all others similarly situated, namely all women prisoners currently held or \n9  to be held in the future at the Santa Rita Jail, as a Class, per Rule 23, F.R.

At all times relevant herein, all of the above individual Defendants AHERN, KETELES, and \n2 \nMADIGAN were officers and employees were acting under the color of law, under color of \n3 \nauthority and in the scope of their employment as Command and Supervisory Personnel of the \n4 \nAlameda County Sheriffโs Office.  Additionally, upon information and belief, one or more of \n5 \nthese Defendants failed, with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ and class membersโ rights, \n6 \nto adequately train and supervise ACSO sheriffโs deputies and staff who were involved in \n7  violating the rights of the Plaintiffs and class members. All of the above individual defendants \n8  are sued in their official capacities.  \n9  20. Defendant D. SKOLDQVIST was and is the Watch Commander for Santa Rita Jail. \nDefendants D.

Defendant COUNTY OF ALAMEDA is a โpublic entityโ within the definition of Cal. Gov. \n21 \nCode ยง 811.2. \n22 \n23. Plaintiff is informed and believe and therefore allege that each of said defendants DOES 1 \n23 \nthrough 50, are and/or were agents or employees of Defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA \n24 \nand ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE, and acted within the scope of that agency \n25 \nor employment or under color of state law.    DOE 1-50 are defendants who caused, and are \n26 \nresponsible for, the below-described unlawful conduct and resulting injuries by, among other \n27  things, personally participating in the unlawful conduct or acting jointly or conspiring with \n28  others who did so; by authorizing, acquiescing in or setting in motion policies, plans or \n \nPage 6 of 18 \nMohrbacher v.

Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and/or capacities of defendants sued herein \nas DOE 1 through 50, inclusive, and therefore sue said defendants by such fictitious names.  \n10 \nPlaintiff will amend this complaint to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained \n11 \nand will ask leave to amend this complaint to insert further charging allegations when such \n12 \nfacts are ascertained.  DOE 1 through 50 are sued in their individual and official capacities. \n13 \nEMERGENCY RELIEF \n14 \n24. As spelled out in moving papers filed herein of even date, prisoner-plaintiffs JACLYN \n15 \nMOHRBACHER, ERIN ELLIS, DOMINIQUE JACKSON are in dire straits in the Santa Rita \n16 \nJail at this moment, and continuously, all being pregnant and in substantial discomfort, with \n17  intermittent bleeding, having health complications including plaintiff ELLIS having \n18  previously suffered a mild stroke, and plaintiff JACKSON behaving previously suffered a \n19  heart attack and being pregnant with twins and having her physician, who was treating her \nprior to her incarceration, declaring that she is a high risk pregnancy, and having been \n20 \nexplicitly and pointedly denied and refused any and all assistance or accommodation for her \n21 \nconditionโincluding but not limited to any meaningful attention by a doctor or other \n22 \nqualified practitioner.  Defendant MOHRBACHER โbeing told by every defendant staff \n23 \nmember she has had contact with that her only and best recourse is to agree to an abortion.   \n24 \n25. In circumstances whereโas all the plaintiff-prisoners are acutely awareโtwo pregnant \n25 \nwomen have recently miscarried in the jail after beingโ pointedly, again, and with \n26 \nunmistakable maliceโdenied any and all medical assistance, this plaintiff is in legitimate \n27  great fear that she will be ignored and left to languish without help, even if she begins to \n28  miscarry, unless this Court intervenes with Order(s) sufficient to guarantee protection of her \n \nPage 7 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 1   Filed 01/04/18   Page 8 of 18\n \nhealth and well-being, and that of her unborn child. \n1 \nCLASS CLAIM \n2 \n26. This abuse and mistreatment is part and parcel of defendants and each of their violations of \n3 \nexisting jail policies and procedures, California statutes and California regulations.  Despite \n4 \nrepeated complaints and even prior lawsuits, defendants and each of them failure and refusal \n5 \nto comply with policies and procedures, California statutes and California regulations, even \n6 \nafter notification of resulting injuries and harms, indicates callous and wanton and deliberate \n7  disregard for the safety, health and well being of the women prisoners under their control, and \n8  clearly shows programmatic mistreatment and abuse of women prisoners. \n9  27. The class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable. In any given year, there are over one \nhundred pregnant women who are in defendantsโ custody. Joinder is inherently impractical \n10 \nbecause the number of unnamed, future class members who will be pregnant while in \n11 \ndefendantsโ custody is unknown and unknowable, especially given the transient nature of the \n12 \nplaintiff population in defendantsโ custody and the temporal limitations of pregnancy. \n13 \nProposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own behalf given \n14 \nthe practical, legal, monetary, and fear-based barriers that prevent their ability to access \n15 \nindependent counsel to challenge defendantsโ abusive, coercive and punitive measures; not to \n16 \nmention defendantsโ active measures preventing proposed class members from \n17  communicating amongst themselves and with legal counsel. \n18  28. The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of law, including but not \n19  limited to whether: i) discrimination against women in access to services, classes, ability to \nwork, rights and privileges; and ii) failure to comply with state laws and regulations on \n20 \nmeeting the needs of womenโs reproductive and menstrual needs; iii) disparate and unequal \n21 \ntreatment of women in ways that are inferior to the treatment of men, including the priority \n22 \ngiven to processing, always, the men first, meting out stricter and more severe punishments to \n23 \nwomen particularly for minor infractions, limiting and prohibiting women but not men from \n24 \ncommunicating and conversing amongst themselves; iv)   prohibiting class members from \n25 \ncommunicating amongst themselves and with legal counsel; violate the Constitution. \n26 \n29. The claims of the Plaintiff Sub-Class members who are pregnant while under the custody and \n27  control of defendants, share common issues of law, including but not limited to whether: i) \n28  defendantsโ programmatic coercion for abortions; ii) abuse and mistreatment of pregnant \n \nPage 8 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 1   Filed 01/04/18   Page 9 of 18\n \nprisoners which threaten the viability of fetuses and often terminate the viability of fetuses; \n1 \niii) defendantsโ failure to develop and or appropriate implement statutorily required care \n2 \nplans; violate the Constitution. \n3 \n30. The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of fact, including but not \n4 \nlimited to the implementation of Defendantsโ policy and practice is discriminatory against all \n5 \nwomen prisoners, and of harm to pregnant women so as to impair the viability of their fetuses \n6 \nand programmatic coercion to abortions. \n7  31. The claims of plaintiffs are typical of the claims of members of the Plaintiff Class. \n8  32. The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Plaintiff Class. The \n9  named Plaintiff has no interest that is now or may be potentially antagonistic to the interests \nof the Plaintiff Class. The attorneys representing the named Plaintiff are experienced civil \n10 \nrights attorneys and are considered able practitioners in federal constitutional litigation. These \n11 \nattorneys should be appointed as class counsel. \n12 \n33. Defendants have acted, have threatened to act, and will act on grounds generally applicable to \n13 \nthe Plaintiff Class, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the \n14 \nclass as a whole. The Plaintiff Class may therefore be properly certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15 \n23(b)(2). \n16 \n34. Prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Plaintiff Class would create the \n17  risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications and would establish incompatible standards of \n18  conduct for individual members of the Plaintiff Class. The Plaintiff Class may therefore be \n19  properly certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n20 \n35. The Alameda County Sheriffโs Office , authorized under the Alameda County Charter to run \n21 \nand operate the county jails, runs two jails in Alameda County, one in Dublin named Santa \n22 \nRita, the other in Oakland, named glen Dyer.  Currently, the Sheriff processes and holds \n23 \nwomen only at Santa Rita jail.  At any one time, there averages 250 women prisoners with \n24 \nabout 10 pregnant women in Santa Rita Jail, and on information and belief, 2500 women \n25 \nprisoners with 150 pregnant women through the year.    \n26 \n36. The sheriffโs mission statement says that the Sheriff is to provide โhumane treatment to hose \n27  in our custody.โ While: \n28 \n Ability to enforce the law fairly; \n \nPage 9 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 1   Filed 01/04/18   Page 10 of 18\n \n1   Commitment to professionalism; \n2   Service to the community with integrity and trust;   \n3   Obligation to duty with honor and pride. \n   \n4 \nThe facts pled herein show that women prisoners are not treated humanely, and the law is not \n5 \nfairly applied.  Women receive discriminatory and unfair treatment on a routine daily basis \n6 \nincluding being short changed on access to education and work, and greater limitations than \n7 \nmale prisoners to clean laundry, feminine hygiene products, the ability to converse, the ability \n8 \nto choose even where to sit during meals.   \n9 \n37.  As part of the Sheriffโs obligations, pursuant to 15 CCR ยง3355.2, the Sheriff is required \n10  to have each pregnant inmate examined by an Obstetrical Physician or Obstetrical Nurse \n11  Practitioner, and to develop a plan of care.    Defendant Gregory Ahern, the current Sheriff of \n12  Alameda County does not develop a plan of care for each pregnant prisoner, and if a care plan \nis developed, the appropriate measures are not implemented.  The actual care or rather abuse \n13 \nprovided does not  take into consideration the harmful and detrimental consequences to \n14 \nmother and fetus of the unnecessary punitive, and stress inducing regimens at Santa Rita jail, \n15 \nincluding the frequent and all pervasive strip searches and body cavity searches, the excessive \n16 \nincarceration in cold, concrete holding cells, the rampant use of solitary confinement, the \n17 \nroutine and regular disregard of pregnant women prisonerโs request for medical attention, and \n18 \nthe harassment of pregnant women prisonerโs as engaged in the use of illegal drugs, and the \n19 \nover arching administrative policy of coercing women to abort their babies, or the \n20  programmatic maltreatment which results in a majority of miscarriages amount pregnant \n21  women prisoners. \n22  38.  Plaintiffs are women in the custody and control of defendants.  The first three named \nplaintiffs are pregnant.  None of them have received an appropriate plan of care.   None of \n23 \nthem have received an appropriate or thorough examination by an Obstetrical Physician or an \n24 \nObstetrical Nurse.  Instead, the regimen and care includes minor additions in food allotments, \n25 \ndisturbed sleep, and regular intimidation, harassment and physical abuse in the form of \n26 \nfrequent strip searches, body cavity searches and incarceration in solitary confinement cells, \n27 \nheld outdoors or in cold, concrete holding cells without adequate clothing and encouragement \n28 \nand coercion to abort their fetus.   \n \nPage 10 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 1   Filed 01/04/18   Page 11 of 18\n \n39.  The plan of care includes vital signs monitoring which interrupt the vital sleep of \n1 \npregnant prisoners.  The only additional nutrition is peanut butter and jelly twice a day and \n2 \nextra ratios of milk.  And whereas some of the women have vital signs monitored daily with \n3 \nsleep disruption.  Others receive no monitoring for weeks on end. \n4 \n40.  Instead of medical care, complaints of feeling ill are treated with solitary confinement, \n5 \nstrip searches and cavity searches.  Pregnant prisoners are told that their illness is due to drug \n6 \nabuse.     \n7  41.  The provision of food is at such odds with human needs, that breakfast is served between \n8  3:30 am, and 4:30 a.m. and missing breakfast results in a 19 hour fast, which is detrimental to \n9  the nutrition needs of fetuses and pregnant women. \n42.  Instead of providing Plaintiffs with adequate menstrual pads as required by State law for \n10 \nPlaintiffsโ hygiene and reproductive needs, Plaintiffs are left to bleed over their clothing, or at \n11 \ntimes have been offered used menstrual pads out of garbage cans. \n12 \n43.  For women who end up in incarceration during a late term pregnancy, Santa Rita does not \n13 \nprovide even adequate care.  Recently, one woman who complained of cramps and pain, was \n14 \nplaced into solitary confinement per Santa Ritaโs standard routine of meting out punishment \n15 \nand abuse onto pregnant prisoner. This woman was forced to deliver her baby, alone, in \n16 \nsolitary confinement.  \n17  44.  Defendantsโ abuse and mistreatment of women prisoners is part and parcel of the \n18  discrimination and unequal treatment meted out to women prisoners as compared to male \n19  prisoners.  Women prisoners are denied the same educational classes and opportunities \navailable to male prisoners.  Women prisoners are denied the same access to outdoor or yard \n20 \ntime and yard space available to male prisoners.  Defendants impose greater repression and \n21 \nrestrictions on plaintiffs which male prisoners are not subject to,  including being prohibited \n22 \nfrom talking during meals, and being forced to sit on the seats that defendants assigned.  \n23 \n45.  This abuse and mistreatment is part and parcel of defendants and each of their violations \n24 \nof existing jail policies and procedures, California statutes and California regulations.  Despite \n25 \nrepeated complaints and even prior lawsuits, defendants and each of them failure and refusal \n26 \nto comply with policies and procedures, California statutes and California regulations, even \n27  after notification of resulting injuries and harms, indicates callous and wanton and deliberate \n28  disregard for the safety, health and well being of the women prisoners under their control, and \n \nPage 11 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 1   Filed 01/04/18   Page 12 of 18\n \nclearly shows programmatic mistreatment and abuse of women prisoners. \n1 \n46.  Defendants also have actively prevented and interfered with plaintiffsโ and proposed class \n2 \nmembers ability to speak with counsel, and have taken actions in retaliation of plaintiffsโ \n3 \nefforts to file grievances and highlight these abuses.    \n4 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n5 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n6 \nViolation of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments To United States \n7  Constitution and Against Cruel & Unusual Punishment \n8  (42  .S.C. ยง 1983) \n9  47.   Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 45 of this \ncomplaint.  \n10 \n48.  Plaintiffs advance this claim on their own behalf, and on behalf of all class members \n11 \n      against all defendants. \n12 \n49.  Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive plaintiffs and the class of the minimal \n13 \ncivilized measure of lifeโs necessities, and have violated their basic human dignity and their \n14 \nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth \n15 \nAmendments to the United States Constitution for each of the reasons set forth below. \n16 \n50.  There is no valid penological reason to pointedly and systematically refuse and deprive \n17  female prisoners, particularly pregnant prisoners of needed and necessary medical care, and \n18  accommodation of any sortโbalanced, healthy and adequate diet; counseling, exercise, \n19  blankets and warm clothes, and a minimum of cleanliness, soap and cleaning supplies. \n51.  There is no valid penological reason to pointedly and systematically use isolation cells \n20 \nand strip searches as a tool of punishment and intimidation particularly with pregnant \n21 \nprisoners. \n22 \n52.  There is no valid penological reason to coerce and threaten pregnant prisoners into \n23 \nconsenting to an abortion. \n24 \n53.  There is no valid penological reason to programmatically abuse pregnant women so as to \n25 \nimpair the viability of their fetuses and potentially or actually cause a miscarriage including \n26 \nholding women outdoors in the cold without adequate outwear and for extended periods of \n27  time. \n28  54.

Then, \n3 \nwith its leave, we would ask the Court to consolidate the UPSHAW et al. vs. ALAMEDA \n4 \nCOUNTY, et al. 3:18-cv-07814-JD (herein after the โSleep caseโ) with the main case \n5 \nMOHRBACHER, ET AL. V. ALAMEDA COUNTY  SHERIFFโS OFFICE, et al. 3:18-cv-00050-JD, \n6 \n(hereinafter the โMain caseโ), and give us 20-30 days to submit an amended, omnibus complaint, \n7  charging systemic, endemic, categorically  unconstitutional maltreatment of women at Santa Rita \n8  Jailโespecially including pregnant women, and in violation of rights of those unbornโ\n9  encompassing all the particulars of apparent ongoing constitutional wrongdoing, under both 8th \nand 14th Amendments, including other emergent claims, which we have detected in a year of \n10 \ndetailed communications with women in and out of Santa Rita.1 \n11 \nWe will be seeking intervention by the Court in the form of specific directions for reform, \n12 \nand change, prohibitions on various wrong actions, and setting standards, all based on findings \n13 \nacross a broad front of particular claims.  \n14 \nA working but unrefined outline of these Claims or categories of claims, could be as \n15 \nfollows: \n16 \n1.  Constantly Bad, Insufficient, non-nourishing Food (especially for pregnant women); \n17  after earnest promises; for example live, wriggling maggots in the beans, one night about  two  \n18  weeks ago, on five trays randomly chosen by the deputy.2 \n19  2.  Bad Medical Care; poorly trained, incompetent, careless, indifferent personnel, and \ndefective equipment; poor and dangerously inaccurate record-keeping and medicine scans; \n20 \nwretched mistreatment of women in drug withdrawal; and more; the onerous $3.00 fee to submit, \n21 \nsimply submit, a request to see a medical person remains, despite defendantsโ promise way last \n22 \nSpring, and menstrual pads are still in constant short supply, etc; \n23 \n                                                                    \n24 \n1    This has been mainly accomplished and recorded by our invaluable Investigator, Carey \n25  Lamprecht, a certified paralegal, who is a true and accurate repository and source of good \ninformation about daily life and events in the Womenโs section of Santa Rita Jail from early Spring, \n26 \n2018 to now.  Such investigation necessitated by the lack and failure of defendants to provide \naccurate data and information about the workings of the  jail. \n27 \n2 This shocking episode is recounted for its shock value, without a doubt; because it illustrates the \n28  degree of abandon, and, objectively, wantonness, as it were, with which the women are treated in this \njail. \n \n2 \nPLAINTIFFSโ PROPOSAL TO TERMINATE MEDIATION AND CONSOLIDATE CASES \nMohrbacher v.

A Corrupted, disrupted grievance process, wherein forms are withheld or disappeared \n1 \nby hostile deputies after submission, and complaints which do make it through are invariably \n2 \nwhitewashed, and offending deputies never held accountable;  \n3 \n4.  A Corrupted disciplinary process; frequent illicit group punishments, etc, and no clear \n4 \nwritten rules, but mostly made-up on the spot, ongoing denial of (useless) handbooks, random \n5 \nsummary punishment by unreasonable and humiliating strip and โsquat and coughโ searches, and \n6 \nundue denial of yard, classes and mail; more; \n7    5. Maladministration in so many ways: prolonged, unjustified, punitive confinement to cells; \n8  the limited โPODโ (outโofโcell) time then often scheduled at 6:00 am, then cut off early; access to \n9  phones limited to these early hour POD times when lawyers, etc. cannot be reached, 3 a.m. pill call \nand much-too-early wake-up times (as we saw); reclassification as punishment; great over-use of \n10 \nshackling; a gross ITR room where women must wait hours for โprocessingโ when returning from \n11 \nCourt, and pregnant ones get no priority, etc, etc, etc.  Women required to maintain cell cleanliness \n12 \nbut provided only Cleaning times and supplies have not improved, etc, etc.  These defendants are \n13 \ndeep dug in;  \n14 \n  6.  Failure to properly screen, train, supervise and discipline line officers to counter and block \n15 \nabusive tendencies; indulgence of misconduct, and โmean deputiesโ whose tyranniesโin what has \n16 \nbeen called an โoperational disconnectโ, whereby the commanders have no โsituational awarenessโ of \n17  how officers on the line behaving---and other warning signs are ignored.  The mean deputies are at \n18  the heart of the problem here, along with obtuse, prejudiced administrative policy & practice.  \n19  Examples are replete including the regular discard of the few, but important personal possession these \nwomen have, including family photos, cards from children, and in one instance, a womanโs ring, the \n20 \nlast memento from her deceased father; \n21 \n  7. Unspoken Policy of constant, deliberate, unjustifiably punitive and abusive infliction of \n22 \nfear, guilt, shaming, discomfort, neglect, misery and suffering, all unjustified, and gratuitous and \n23 \nlaced with malice, by officers in charge of daily life; and, \n24 \n  8.  An ongoing factual dispute wherein defendants deny these wrongdoings, particularly \n25 \nclaims that guards are mean and nasty with repeated assertions that the guards have families and love \n26 \ntheir children, to which plaintiffs respond with the research and findings of Phillip Zimbardo, author \n27 \n28 \n \n3 \nPLAINTIFFSโ PROPOSAL TO TERMINATE MEDIATION AND CONSOLIDATE CASES \nMohrbacher v.

To consider initiating specific inquiries with an eye to developing both a record of \n9  things that have happened, and evidence of the violations alleged, and disposition of \nspecific issues; and, \n10 \n4.  Class Certification - to make short work of the decision to certify the class of these \n11 \nwomen, booked into SRJ (and out, for some relevant period after), and a subclass of \n12 \nthose who are pregnantโwhere we will also be asserting a second sub-class, of \n13 \naddicted women, who go into withdrawal in custody, and are all too often treated \n14 \npunitively and inadequately, and with callous and deliberate indifference, if not \n15 \noutright cruelty under an 8th Amendment standard. \n16 \n5.  To make specific provisions for ample, effective access to the Women for counselโ\n17  well beyond the current apparently baseless restrictions on access which defendants \n18  enforce 4, let alone the types of harassment, resistance, and delay we meet so oftenโto \n19  and including prohibiting counsels from meeting with more than one prisoner at a \ntime.  The bar on group meetings denies opportunities for the women to discuss, \n20 \nunderstand and reach agreement(s) about the case, and for development of live, \n21 \ncurrent evidence of the ongoing tyrannies plaintiffs suffer under as complained of \n22 \nherein.   \n23 \n6.   \n24 \n25 \n26                                                                      \n3 Zimbardo, Philip G.

INTRODUCTION \n7 \n1.  Plaintiffs have alleged a strong and reprehensible, and unconstitutional pattern and practice of \n8  aggressively misogynist, apparently programmatic, maltreatment of women prisoners, and pregnant \n9  women in particularโso severe as to have resulted inter alia in at least three recent miscarriages, and \n10  another woman giving birth after screaming in labor pain all night, while alone and unattended in a \nsolitary confinement cellโat the Alameda County jail at Santa Rita, California.  The named \n11 \nindividual plaintiffs describe and complain of specific, purposeful, aggravated violations of the First, \n12 \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and parallel \n13 \nprovisions of the California Constitution, along with flagrant violations of statute and official \n14 \nregulations, all detailed within, resulting in serious injury and deprivation under federal and state civil \n15 \nrights laws for which various individuals seek damages herein.  \n16 \n2.  More to the point, the representative plaintiffs have alleged that the Sub-class of pregnant \n17 \nprisoners, and each of them, are strongly threatened with irreparable harm---and have no adequate \n18 \nremedy at Law for it, obviously---resulting from grossly inadequate nourishment, warmth, sanitation \n19  medical care and other necessities of pregnancy, unless this honorable Court will intervene in a \n20  strong and comprehensive way, either by causing the Sheriffโs Department to hold or assign women \nprisoners who are pregnant in some place besides the Jail, or making a preliminary and permanent \n21 \ndecree, with prohibitions and remedial directions, and follow through to ensure compliance.  \n22 \nDefendantsโ maltreatment and abuse of prisoners who are pregnant involves apparently willful \n23 \nviolations of existing jail policies and procedures, and California statutes and Regulations, as well as \n24 \nfundamental constitutional principles.  Despite repeated complaints and even prior lawsuits, \n25 \ndefendants have repeatedly failed to follow policies, statutes and regulations, even after being \n26 \nnotified of resulting injuries and harms.   \n27 \n3.  Described within, the plaintiffsโ evidence shows callous, deliberate and systematic disregard for \n28 \nthe safety, health and wellbeing of pregnant women prisoners in defendantsโ custody and control, and \n \nPage 2 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 3 of 18\n \ntheir unborn children---whose interests surely deserve independent protection---and the Court must \n1 \nput a stop to it.  At a minimum, every pregnant prisoner must be provided with an individualized, \n2 \nappropriate and implemented plan of care---as required by statute and regulation!---which will \n3 \ngenuinely assist and enable those who desire it to carry their babies to term and deliver healthy \n4 \nbabies, \n5 \n4.  New Defendant(s).   As we learned at the hearing, the Sheriff and the County defendants \n6 \nbroadly deny any responsibility for care of pregnant prisoners, and assert that their contract medical \n7  provider, the California Forensic Medical Group (โCFMGโ), a for-profit corporate enterprise, is \n8  wholly responsible for all aspects of the care and treatment of pregnant women prisoners; and they \n9  insist CFMG is an indispensible party, at least.  Plaintiffs reject any notion that blame is to be shifted \nhere, but are glad to include these others who apparently share it, or some of it.  The proper care of \n10 \npregnant women clearly goes beyond provision of adequate medical attention. \n11 \n5.  Accordingly, plaintiffs do hereby add as defendants and complain against the \n12 \nCALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL GROUP (CFMG), a corporation, and its MANAGERS \n13 \nand EMPLOYEES assigned to Santa Rita, as jointly and severally liable with the County and \n14 \nSheriffโs Department defendants to the plaintiffs and the pregnant Subclass in particular, for \n15 \nthe injuries and deprivations, caused and being caused, and the ongoing urgent default in, and legal \n16 \nand constitutional inadequacies of, and urgent remedial needs regarding reform of, the care and \n17  custody of pregnant women held at Santa Rita, all as complained of herein. \n18  6.  Plaintiffs also hereby add Captain T. RUSSELL who is a captain within the command chain of \n19  Santa Rita Jail and the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. \n \n20 \n**     **      **      ** \n21 \n7.  Beyond the urgent issues involving pregnancy, the plaintiffs herein (in their final grouping), on \n22 \nbehalf of themselves and all women prisoners at Santa Ritaโwhose injuries and deprivations at the \n23 \nhands of defendants do not involve pregnancy, but very often do involve nasty and hostile refusals to \n24 \nacknowledge or respond to feminine hygienic needsโnow also again complain as a Class, as \n25 \ndescribed and asserted within, of extensive, systematic discrimination against the women prisoners at \n26 \nSanta Rita, compared to the men.  Invidious treatment of women occurs in all aspects of life in the \n27  jail: jobs, food, access to bathrooms, showers, hygiene, clean clothes, fresh air and out-of-cell time, \n28  education classes and activities, counseling, phone calls, family visits, and more.  These women also \n \nPage 3 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 4 of 18\n \nseek injunctive relief, under the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments per R.65 F.R.Civ P., \n1 \nand the Bane Act (Cal Civil Code #52.1)โrequiring a total cessation of inhumane and sexually and \n2 \ngender-biased unequal treatment and forms of treatment of women prisoners by defendants, and \n3 \nproviding effective, outside monitoringโon behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, \n4 \nnamely women prisoners currently held or to be held in the future at the Santa Rita Jail, as a \n5 \nClass, per Rule 23, F.R.Civ P.  Plaintiffs likewise seek full compliance with 15 CCR 3355.2; and \n6 \nimplementation of California Penal Code ยง3409, on the proper care and treatment of women \n7  prisoners. \n8  i.  **    **    **    ** \n9  8.  This First Amended Complaint thus adds additional named plaintiffs, listed below;  adds \nmedical provider CFMG and its involved personnel as defendants, and re-presents the equitable \n10 \nclaims of the pregnant Sub-class, the larger discrimination claims by the broad class, and the \n11 \nindividual claims at Law of named plaintiffs and class membersโincluding money damages for the \n12 \nEstates and the mothers of stillborn children, as well as for the sadistic denial of bathroom use, \n13 \nwithholding of feminine hygiene materials, and other physical depredations and specific deprivations \n14 \nof right that have been reportedโwith a framework for adding others who may be encountered as \n15 \ninvestigation proceeds. \n16 \n9.  As before, plaintiffs have named several high-ranking members of the defendant Sheriffโs \n17  Department individually, along with a number of John and Jane Does who are guards and other staff \n18  members who have been involved in the various tyrannies against women prisoners complained of \n19  hereinโand whose number will now include various unknown, named CFMG practitioners and other \nemployees assigned to the Santa Rita accountโall of whom will or would be subject to the \n20 \ninjunctional orders, directions and prohibitions sought herein.  These worthies, depending on the \n21 \nCourtโs outlook, may be more readily dealt with herein as a defendant class.   \n22 \n10.  Also named are the Sheriffโs Department and the County itself, and now CFMG, inc. also, in \n23 \nrespondeat with respect to the State Law claims herein; and also for their unconstitutional explicit \n24 \nand de facto polic(ies) of discrimination and systematic maltreatmentโparticularly of pregnant and \n25 \nmenstruating women, within the rule of Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 US 568. \n26 \n \n27    II.  JURISDICTION & VENUE    \n28 \n  The Jurisdiction of this honorable Court derives from the provisions of the First, Fourth, Fifth, \n \nPage 4 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 5 of 18\n \nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United State Constitution, by way of the Civil Rights \n1 \nActs, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง1981 (as to certain plaintiffs), 1983 et seq. and 1988;  28 U.S.C. ยง1331 (claims \n2 \narising under the United States Constitution) and ยง1343 (claims brought to address deprivations, \n3 \nunder color of state authority, of rights privileges, and immunities secured by the United  States \n4 \nConstitution), and, by pendent jurisdiction,  Secs. 52.1, and 50, of the California Civil Code.   \n5 \n   Intradistrict Assignment.  The claims alleged herein arose in the County of Alameda, State \n6 \nof California. Therefore, venue and assignment, under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b), lies in the United States \n7  District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division or Oakland Division. \n8   \n9    III.  PARTIES \n10  Plaintiffs. ERIN ELLIS and DOMINIQUE JACKSON are each pregnant prisoners currently in the \ncustody and control of the Alameda County Sheriffโs office. 1  Each of them wishes to carry her \n11 \npregnancy to term and have a healthy baby, and each of them wants and demands the necessary \n12 \nnutrition, medical and other support which that minimally requires.  In this First Amended Complaint \n13 \nthe following additional present and former Santa Rosa prisoners, pregnant and otherwise, are joining \n14 \nthe original plaintiffs, some as members of the pregnant Subclass and all as would-be representatives \n15 \nof the Class as a whole.  JACLYN MOHRBACHER and CHRISTINE ZEPEDA are formerly \n16 \npregnant prisoners who suffered a miscarriage due to the mistreatment received at the hands of \n17 \ndefendants, while under the custody and control of the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.  ALEXIS \n18 \nWAH and KELSEY ERWIN who, during their incarcerations, endured the repeat, rampant, and \n19  continual and mistreatment including the unequal (as compared to men) treatment, that women \n20  prisoners receive.  \nDefendants \n21 \n1.  Defendant ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE is a โpublic entityโ within the \n22 \ndefinition of Cal. Govt. Code ยง 811.2; Defendant GREGORY J. AHERN is the Sheriff of Alameda \n23 \nCounty.  As such, he has caused, created, authorized, condoned, ratified, approved or knowingly \n24 \nacquiesced in the illegal, unconstitutional, and inhumane conditions, actions, policies, customs and \n25 \npractices that prevail at Alameda County jails, as described below. He has, therefore, wholly or in \n26 \n                                                                    \n1      Immediately after this action was filed on 1/4/18, named plaintiff  JACLYN  MOSBACHER was transferred to the \n27 \nfederal detention center at Dublin, California, for reasons Counsel at this writing have not yet learned.  She persists in her \nclaims herein. \n28 \n \n \nPage 5 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 6 of 18\n \npart, directly and proximately caused, and will continue in the future to cause, the injuries and \n1 \nviolations of rights set forth below. Defendant Ahern is sued in his official capacity only. \n2 \n2.  Defendant BRETT M. KETELES is the Assistant Sheriff for Alameda County in charge of \n3 \nthe Detentions and Corrections Unit and defendant TOM MADIGAN is the commander in charge of \n4 \nthe Detentions and Corrections Unit which includes the two Alameda County jails, Glen Dyer and \n5 \nSanta Rita, and was so in charge of Santa Rita Jail on December 26, 2016. Defendants BRETT \n6 \nKETELES, TOM MADIGAN, and T. RUSSELL as employees of the Sheriffโs Office and as the \n7  detention and corrections commander for the Sheriffโs Office, held command and policymaking \n8  positions.  They, along with Defendant Ahern, participated in the planning, supervision, and the \n9  execution of the manner in which plaintiffs and class members are incarcerated in the Alameda \ncounty jail facilities and ACSOโs conduct complained of herein.   Defendants BRETT KETELES, \n10 \nTOM MADIGAN, and T. RUSSELL caused, created, authorized, condoned, ratified, approved or \n11 \nknowingly acquiesced in the illegal, unconstitutional, and inhumane conditions, actions, policies, \n12 \ncustoms and practices that prevail at Alameda County jails, particularly as to the treatment of women \n13 \nas described below.  \n14 \n3.  Defendant D. SKOLDQVIST was and is the Watch Commander for Santa Rita Jail. \n15 \nDefendants D. SKOLDQVIST, T. RUSSELL, LT. HATTAWAY and  SGT. CALAGARI (sp), were \n16 \nthe responsible officers for Santa Rita Jail.    Defendants, D. SKOLDQVIST, T. RUSSELL,  LT. \n17  HATTAWAY, SGT. CALAGARI (sp) at all times relevant herein, are and were employees of the \n18  Sheriff who held supervisory, command and/or policy-making positions, and who participated in the \n19  authorization, planning, supervision, and the execution of the sheriffโs conduct complained of herein.  \n4.  At all times relevant herein, the individual Defendants AHERN, KETELES, MADIGAN and \n20 \nRUSSELL were officers and employees acting under the color of law, under color of their official \n21 \nauthority and in the scope of their employment as Command and Supervisory Personnel of the \n22 \nAlameda County Sheriffโs Office.  Additionally, upon information and belief, one or more of these \n23 \nDefendants failed, with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ and class membersโ rights, to adequately \n24 \ntrain and supervise ACSO sheriffโs deputies and staff who were involved in violating the rights of the \n25 \nPlaintiffs and class members. All of the above individual defendants are sued in their individual and \n26 \nofficial capacities.  \n27  5.  At all times relevant herein, all of the above individual Defendants Deputies, DIVINE (sp), \n28  DEBRA FARMANIAN, CAINE (sp), DEPUTY TANIA POPE, DEPUTY โAโ, and DEPUTY โSโ ,  \n \nPage 6 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 7 of 18\n \nwere officers and employees were acting under the color of law, under color of authority and in the \n1 \nscope of their employment with the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, and were the guards and \n2 \ndeputies on duty at Santa Rita Jail with direct control over plaintiffs and members of the class.   \n3 \n6.  The newly added defendants, CFMG and its various employees and sub-contractors, are \n4 \napparently retained by the County to provide medical services to Santa Rita prisoners on behalf of the \n5 \ndefendant Sheriffโs Department; and the County defendants apparently believe, and assert, that, in \n6 \nmaking a contract with CFMG for that purpose, the Department and its defendant minions shed and \n7  shifted and absolved themselves of any responsibility or liability for timely and effective delivery of \n8  such services to prisoners in their custody. Needless to say, plaintiffs disagree absolutely that the \n9  County defendants are to any degree โoff the hook,โ or insulated from legal responsibility for \nprovision of proper care to prisoners in their custody by virtue of such a third-party arrangement.  \n10 \nRather, the newly-added medical personnel---unknown individuals named herein as RICK & RUTH \n11 \nROEs Nos. 1-50---and their employer are jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs and the Subclass, \n12 \nwith the County defendants, for the failures and deficiencies in the care and attention provided to \n13 \npregnant prisoners. \n14 \n7.  Plaintiff is informed and believe and therefore allege that each of said defendants DOES 1 \n15 \nthrough 50, are and/or were agents or employees of Defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA and \n16 \nALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE, and acted within the scope of that agency or \n17  employment or under color of state law.    The same is true with respect to the relations between \n18  defendant CFMG and its practitioners and other employees assigned to the Santa Rita account, ROEs \n19  1-50, and their involvement in the matters at issue herein.  DOEs 1-50 and ROEs 1-50 are defendants \nwho caused, and are responsible for, the below-described unlawful conduct and resulting injuries by, \n20 \namong other things, personally participating in the unlawful conduct or acting jointly or conspiring \n21 \nwith or aiding and abetting others who did so; by authorizing, acquiescing in or setting in motion \n22 \npolicies, plans or actions that led to the unlawful conduct; by failing to take action to prevent the \n23 \nunlawful conduct; by failing and refusing with deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' rights to initiate \n24 \nand maintain adequate training and supervision; and by ratifying the unlawful conduct that occurred \n25 \nby agents and officers under their direction and control, including failing to take remedial or \n26 \ndisciplinary action. Plaintiffs allege that DOEs 1-50 and ROEs 1-50 proximately caused said \n27  incidents, injuries, violation of constitutional and legal rights,  and damages by reason of their \n28  negligence, breach of duty, negligent supervision, management or control, or by reason of other \n \nPage 7 of 18 \nMohrbacher v.

Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and/or capacities of defendants sued herein as DOE \n3 \n1-50 and ROE 1-50, and therefore sue said defendants by such fictitious names.  Plaintiff will amend \n4 \nthis FAC further to supply true names and capacities when the same are ascertained and will seek \n5 \nleave to amend further facts involving them are ascertained.  DOEs 1-50 are sued in their individual \n6 \nand official capacities.  \n7    IV.  EMERGENCY RELIEF \n8  1.  As previously recounted, prisoner-plaintiffs ERIN ELLIS and DOMINIQUE JACKSON \n9  remain in dire straits in the Santa Rita Jail, continuously, both being more than four months pregnant \n10  and in substantial discomfort, with intermittent bleeding, and suffering health complications.  \nPlaintiff ELLIS has previously suffered a mild stroke, and plaintiff JACKSON has had a heart attack, \n11 \nand is pregnant with twins, and the physician who was treating her prior to her incarceration declared \n12 \nthat her pregnancy is โhigh risk.โ  Both women have been explicitly and pointedly denied and refused \n13 \nassistance or accommodation for their condition by defendants, including but not limited to \n14 \nmeaningful attention from a doctor or other qualified practitioner, adequate and sufficient nutrition.  \n15 \nInstead, they are repeatedly advised they should agree to abortion, or defendants disregard these \n16 \nplaintiffsโ requests for medical and nutritional assistance. \n17 \n2.  Instead, defendants have repeatedly demanded that plaintiffs agree to have an abortion, \n18 \naccused plaintiffs of being drug addicts, and refused all other recognition and assistance for each \n19  plaintiffโs delicate condition.  Other pregnant womenโincluding those who miscarriedโhave \n20  similarly been scorned, branded and mistreated in the jail in recent timesโunder a regime marked by \na striking and most distasteful animosity towards women prisoners---and particularly those thought, \n21 \nrightly or wrongly, to have addiction issues, and studied, often openly scornful, indifference to their \n22 \nserious medical and hygienic needs. \n23 \n3.  These women now seek extraordinary relief from this Court on an emergency basis, in \n24 \ncircumstances where all the plaintiff-prisoners are acutely aware that three pregnant women have \n25 \nrecently miscarried in the jail or just after getting out, after being denied medical assistance; and a \n26 \nthird was left in labor, screaming all night, in a solitary confinement cell.  Thus all plaintiffs must \n27 \nlegitimately fear that they will be ignored and left to languish without help, even if beginning to \n28 \nmiscarry, unless this Court intervenes with Order(s) sufficient to guarantee protection of their health \n \nPage 8 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 9 of 18\n \nand well-being, and that of her unborn child. \n1 \n4.  Plaintiffs therefore seek a comprehensive remedy, by decree involving big oversight, \n2 \ndiscussed further below, which will ensure that they and all pregnant women prisoners who come \n3 \ninto defendantsโ custody receive all needed accommodationโincluding decent, nourishing food, \n4 \nwarm clothing and blankets, proper rest, fresh air and exercise, etc, as well as timely medical \n5 \nattention and monitoring, doctor and hospital visits, and pre-natal counseling along with, where \n6 \nneeded, addiction servicesโfrom defendant Sheriffโs and CFMG staff members while they are in \n7  custody. \n8    V.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n9  1.  The โmission statementโ for the defendant Alameda County Sheriffโs Department states \n10  that the Department will provide โHumane treatment to those in our custody, while demonstrating: \nAbility to enforce the law fairly; Commitment to professionalism; Service to the community with \n11 \nintegrity and trust;  and, Obligation to duty with honor and pride.โ  But the facts show that women \n12 \nprisoners are not treated humanely, and the law is not fairly applied.  Women receive unfair and \n13 \ndiscriminatory treatment on a routine basis, including being short changed on access to education and \n14 \nwork, and  \n15 \n2.  greater limitations than male prisoners to clean laundry, feminine hygiene products, the \n16 \nability to converse with others, and even the freedom to choose where to sit during meals.   \n17 \n3.  The Santa Rita jail is one of two jails in Alameda County, located in the remote eastern \n18 \nreaches, near Dublin.  The other jail is in downtown Oakland.  Women are held only at Santa Rita.  \n19  On information and belief, there are approximately 250 women held there at any given time, of \n20  whom, on average, about ten are pregnant.  Most of these women prisoners are pre-trial detainees \nunable to afford bail, but quite a number are also serving time, mostly for probation violations.  In the \n21 \ncourse of a year, roughly 150 pregnant women will have been under the custody and control of the \n22 \nAlameda County Sheriffโs Office at Santa Rita for some period of time.  \n23 \n4.  The Sheriffโs Department has a contract with the California Forensic Medical Group, \n24 \nCFMG, to provide necessary medical care and services to prisoners at Santa Rita, under which \n25 \nCFMG apparently assigns various practitioners and other personnel who work at the jail, and others \n26 \nwho visit intermittently for various purposes.  CFMG is said to set the procedures and protocols by \n27 \nwhich prisoners receive (or donโt receive) medical attention and care, and the Undersigned have been \n28 \nadvised that the Sheriffโs Department regards CFMG as wholly and solely responsible for dealing \n \nPage 9 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 10 of 18\n \nwith any and all medical problems that Santa Rita prisoners may have, including pregnancies.   \n1 \nA.   Maltreatment of Pregnant Women Prisoners \n2 \n5.  In point of fact, the practice of CFMG practitioners and other personnel in monitoring and \n3 \nattending to the progress of pregnancies amount women at Santa Rita, and the level of concern or \n4 \nengagement in the project of such care, is simply dismal.   \n5 \n6.  Pursuant to 15 CCR ยง3355.2, the Sheriff is required to have each pregnant inmate \n6 \nexamined by an Obstetrical Physician or Obstetrical Nurse Practitioner, and to develop a specific \n7  โplan of care.โ    To plaintiffsโ knowledge, no plan of care is or has been since longtime developed \n8  for each pregnant prisoner, and the โcareโ provided ignores altogether the harmful and detrimental \n9  consequences to mother and fetus of the unnecessarily and unjustifiably punitive and stress-inducing \nregimens for women prisoners at Santa Rita.  These include madly frequent, all pervasive strip \n10 \nsearches and body cavity searches, a profligate, also unjustified use of solitary confinement, routine \n11 \nand regular disregard of pregnant women prisonersโ requests for medical assistance, and the general \n12 \npractice of scorn and harassment of pregnant women prisoners by both CFMG and Sheriffโs \n13 \nDepartment personnel.   \n14 \n7.  None of the plaintiffs or anyone they know of have been given or told of any plan of care; \n15 \nand  none of them have been examined by an Obstetrical Physician or an Obstetrical Nurse.  Women \n16 \nwho complain of not feeling well or ask to see a doctor are often harshly accused of using illegal \n17  drugs---particularly by defendant DIVINE, a Sheriffโs deputy---and often punished in Solitary \n18  Confinement, or by baseless, wholly unjustified, unconstitutional strip searches or body cavity \n19  searches, or by being put outside in the cold for hours on end without warm clothes or blankets;  \nWhen plaintiffs request that a urine test be administered to disprove the false accusations levied \n20 \nagainst them by defendants, defendants refuse, and insist instead on the invasive, humiliating and \n21 \noften injurious strip and body cavity searches. \n22 \n8.  Further, rather than provide and implement plans of care for plaintiffs as required by \n23 \nRegulation, defendants have instituted a program of constant monitoring of pregnant womenโs vital \n24 \nsigns, consisting of recording blood pressure and pulse at least three times a day.  As part of this \n25 \nโprogram,โ plaintiffs are awakened between midnight and 4:00 a.m., every night---notwithstanding \n26 \npregnant womanโs well-known, vital need to get adequate rest---in order for vital signs to be taken \n27  and recorded.   \n28  9.  Plaintiffs receive an extra ration of 8 ounces of milk, but otherwise get no additional fresh \n \nPage 10 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 11 of 18\n \nfruits, vegetables or other good protein nutrition, and certainly no balanced diet.  Meat products \n1 \nserved at the jail are widely regarded, including by plaintiff, as unfit for human consumption.   \n2 \nPregnant prisoners are fed a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with perhaps a cookie or an apple, and \n3 \ntheir extra cup of milk, for lunch and snack.  Dinner is beans, boiled vegetables and pasta, with some \n4 \nbread.  In one striking element of the daily routine, coldly illustrating the essentially anti-human \n5 \ncharacter of the Santa Rita regime, breakfast is served at 3:30 a.m. each day.  Many women and these \n6 \nand other pregnant women in particular donโt have the energy to get up and eat at that hour, or are \n7  unwilling to trade their rest for the crappy repast they know awaits them.  In short, the diet provided \n8  is grossly inadequate for the basic nutritional needs of a pregnant woman and her developing child. \n9  10. As a result of defendantโs apparently programmatic, ingrained habits of maltreatment, and \nvindictiveness, on the part of individual deputies---especially where women have or have had \n10 \naddiction problems---pregnant women have suffered termination of pregnancy either through \n11 \nmiscarriage, or the fetus losing viability. Plaintiff CHRISTINA ZEPEDA, who was in custody from \n12 \nAugust through November, 2017, and as a result of defendantsโ described maltreatment, began \n13 \nbleeding so badly she was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, where she had a miscarriage.  And \n14 \nplaintiffs are informed and believe that another woman, Paramdeep Kaur who was pregnant and in \n15 \ncustody at Santa Rita this past Fall, also suffered a miscarriage.  And plaintiff JACLYN \n16 \nMOHRBACHER, who at the initiation of this action was pregnant, but due to the brutal treatment of \n17  defendants, including denial of medical care, repeated abusive confinement in solitary, with repeated \n18  strip and body cavity searches, suffered a miscarriage in the interim.  The Defendant Deputies instead \n19  of calling for medical assistance, allowed plaintiff MOHRBACHER to continue bleeding; treating \nher in such a heartless manner as demonstrated by their refusal to provide her with menstrual pads but \n20 \nforced her for many hours to bleed all over her clothing, while continually falsely accusing her of \n21 \nmisusing drugs. \n22 \n11. Also this past Fall, in keeping with Santa Ritaโs routine of punishment and abuse for \n23 \npregnant prisoners as already recounted, a woman was placed into solitary confinement after she \n24 \ncomplained of cramps and pain, Then, despite the mandate for half-hour checks on her condition, all \n25 \nthe deputies and medical personnel ignored her, throughout the night.  The woman was experiencing \n26 \nlabor pains, and she began screaming; her screams went on for hours, and of course were agony for \n27  the other women prisoners to hear echoing throughout the night; and no deputy, or CFMG person, \n28  checked on her welfare before morning; by when this woman, known only as โCandaceโ had \n \nPage 11 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 12 of 18\n \ndelivered her baby, alone.  She reported that the umbilical cord was wound around the babyโ neck \n1 \nwhen it emerged, and that she had to poke her finger down its throat---acting on instinct---to get it \n2 \nstarted breathing.  Defendants have asserted that---where such a person, and, implicitly, such an event \n3 \napparently occurred---it was because Candace was medically examined and said to be experiencing \n4 \nfalse labor---the Braxton-Hicks syndrome---but have failed to justify their wrongful seclusion of \n5 \nCandace in solitary confinement, the failure to make regular checks on her welfare, actions to muffle \n6 \nher screaming and patent refusal to summon medical aid.  \n7  12. In sum, from the accounts of these women, and more who continue to connect and add \n8  their voices---and notwithstanding disclaimers by the County defendants, or CFMG defendants \n9  hiding behind obscure provisions of a contract---it is clear there are gross deficiencies in the \naccommodation of pregnant women prisoners at Santa Rita, which have caused and continue to cause \n10 \ngreat injury to numerous women (e.g, the wrongful death of stillborn children), and deprivation of \n11 \nfundamental rights in the form of widespread, indeed systemic Deliberate Indifference to Serious \n12 \nMedical Needs these women obviously have, and gross denial of Due Process, especially for the \n13 \nunborn, and will go on causing and risking such injuries, losses and deprivations if nothing is done. \n14 \nB.  Discrimination Against Women in General. \n15 \n13.  Furthermore, Defendantsโ abuse and mistreatment of women prisoners is part and parcel \n16 \nof the discrimination and unequal treatment meted out to women prisoners as compared to male \n17  prisoners.  Women prisoners are denied the educational classes and opportunities available to male \n18  prisoners; denied the access to outdoor (fresh air) or yard time and yard space available to male \n19  prisoners.  Defendants impose greater repression and restrictions, including being prohibited from \ntalking during meals, so that one prisoner cannot offer extra unwanted food to another, or one cannot \n20 \nask for anotherโs unwanted food.  Women prisoners cannot exchange information nor share support \n21 \nregarding defendantsโ programmatic abuse during the one period of time they are together.  Women \n22 \nprisoners have greater restrictions than male prisoners, including being told where to sit during meals.  \n23 \nWomen prisoners are strip searched and subjected to body cavity searches for little or no good \n24 \nreason---except to maintain domination---with greater frequency and regularity than male prisoners.   \n25 \n14.  This abuse and mistreatment also directly involves violations of existing jail policies and \n26 \nprocedures, California statutes and California regulations.  Despite repeated complaints and even \n27  prior lawsuits, defendants and each of them failure and refusal to comply with policies and \n28  procedures, California statutes and California regulations, even after notification of resulting injuries \n \nPage 12 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 13 of 18\n \nand harms, indicates callous and wanton and deliberate disregard for the safety, health and well being \n1 \nof the women prisoners under their control, and clearly shows programmatic mistreatment and abuse \n2 \nof women prisoners compared to men. \n3 \n  VI.  CLASS CLAIM \n4 \n1.  Within the meaning of Rule 23, F.R.Civ. P., the Class of women prisoners, and \n5 \nparticularly the Subclass of pregnant prisoners, are both numerous and indeterminate, as women \n6 \ncome into and leave the Jail, so that joinder of all the claims already in view is clearly impracticable. \n7 \n(R. 23(a)(1).  In any given year, there are as many as 150 pregnant women in defendantsโ custody for \n8  some period of time. Joinder is inherently impractical because the number of unnamed, future class \n9  members who will be pregnant while in defendantsโ custody is unknown and unknowable, and, given \n10  the transient nature of the plaintiff population and the temporal limitations of pregnancy, their \nidentities will vary. Proposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own \n11 \nbehalf given the practical, legal, monetary, and fear-based barriers that impede their access to counsel \n12 \nto challenge defendantsโ abusive, coercive and punitive regime---not to mention defendantsโ active \n13 \nmeasures preventing proposed class members from communicating amongst themselves and with \n14 \nlegal counsel.  \n15 \n2.  There are numerous common issues of both law and fact (R. 23(a)(2)), including but not \n16 \nlimited to the factual occurrence, vel non, of:  i) defendantsโ programmatic coercion for abortions, ii) \n17 \nabuse and mistreatment of pregnant prisoners which threaten the viability of fetuses and often \n18 \nterminate pregnancies, iii) prohibiting class members from communicating amongst themselves and \n19  with legal counsel, iv) failure to develop statutorily required care plans, v) discrimination against \n20  women in access to services, classes, ability to work, rights and privileges, and, vi) failure to comply \nwith state laws and regulations on meeting the needs of womenโs reproductive and menstrual needs.  \n21 \nLegal questions, regarding, e.g, the applicability of the various state statutes mentioned above, the \n22 \nConstitutional standards to be applied in assessing the plaintiffsโ claims, and the like, will plainly be \n23 \nthe same with respect to all individual class members. \n24 \n3.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of members of the Plaintiff \n25 \nClass, (R.23(a)(3)), and of members of the Subclass in particular, where all the pregnant women \n26 \nprisoners, past, present and to come, complain in the same terms of the ill effects of  defendantsโ \n27 \nnonfeasance and maltreatment, and failure to follow the law.  The fact that different individuals \n28 \nsuffered or may suffer different degrees of injury---obviously only certain ones suffered miscarriage, \n \nPage 13 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 14 of 18\n \nfor example---is not a bar to certification, particularly where, as here, the defendants have โacted or \n1 \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final \n2 \ninjunctive relief;โ per Section (b)(2) of the Rule.  The underlying injuries flowing from practice and \n3 \npolicy are common to all pregnant women at Santa Rita to some serious, health-threatening degree, as \n4 \nwe have shown and will show.  \n5 \n4.  The named Plaintiffs will---and are able to---fairly and adequately protect the interests of \n6 \nthe Plaintiff Subclass, per Sub.(a)(4) of the Rule. The named Plaintiffs have no interest at odds in any \n7  way with those of the Subclass, and each has affirmed to counsel her desire and willingness to pursue \n8  the matter on behalf of the other women who will come into Santa Rita with child. The attorneys \n9  representing the named plaintiffs are experienced civil rights practitioners, well able to prosecute and \ncarry on substantial federal constitutional litigation such as this, and with access to additional help \n10 \nwhich is even now being assembled for the larger work.  The Undersigned represent to the Court \n11 \ntheir determination to see this matter through---both as to the urgent immediate pregnancy issues and \n12 \nthe County defendantsโ broader gender/sex discrimination practices against women---and, btw, we \n13 \nhereby respectfully request that we be designated by the Court as counsel for the Class of present and \n14 \nfuture women prisoners at Santa Rita, and the Subclass of those among them who are pregnant. \n15 \n5.  From the pleadings, and particularly the many sworn affidavits submitted with plaintiffsโ \n16 \npending renewed injunction motion, it is clear the defendants acted and now act and will act โon \n17  grounds generally applicable toโ the Subclass, in any case, thereby โmaking final injunctive relief \n18  appropriateโ to the class as a whole. The Plaintiff Class may therefore be properly certified under \n19  R.23(b)(2),   Certainly also it is patent that both factual and legal questions common to the Subclass \npredominate here over individual concerns, so certification is also proper under Section (b)(3). \n20 \n6.  In sum, plaintiffs are entitled to have the Subclass of pregnant prisoners certified pro \n21 \ntanto at the very least, or otherwise separately from the main class alleged herein, so that the \n22 \nproceedings regarding emergency relief for all pregnant women who are in or may come into Santa \n23 \nRita can go forward without hindrance; and work on the claims of the Class as a Whole can abide \n24 \nfurther attention from the parties and the Court in the near future. \n25 \n  VII.  PLAINTIFFSโ CLAIMS \n26 \n  ONE.  The pattern and practice of nonfeasance and maltreatment of pregnant women prisoners \n27 \nby Both Groups of defendants, as shown and to be shown herein reflects and includes violation of \n28 \nthose women plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment rights to Due Process of Law---in the form of decent \n \nPage 14 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 15 of 18\n \nand humane treatment all prisoners are entitled to---to a degree here which forcibly shocks the \n1 \nconscience, well within the meaning of Sacramento v. Lewis2 and requires strong intervention by the \n2 \nCourt to end abuses and set things right for pregnant women sent to Jail in Alameda County.  This \n3 \nwill require a preliminary and permanent Injunction under the Civil Rights Acts, 42 U.S. Code ยง1983 \n4 \net seq.  An as yet undetermined number of Subclass plaintiffs---such as those who suffered \n5 \nmiscarriage or stillbirth---also are clearly entitled to Judgment at Law for compensatory damages for \n6 \nthose losses. \n7    In addition, plaintiffs assert pro tanto, and particularly as it affects prisoner-plaintiffs who are \n8  serving time in Santa Rita, convicted, as opposed to awaiting trial, that the described nonfeasance and \n9  maltreatment violate the Eighth Amendment also; and, conversely, \n  The Subclass women who are pre-trial detainees also complain that the Seizure they are under, \n10 \nin the circumstances shown---and certainly that of their unborn children---is unreasonable in violation \n11 \nof the Fourth Amendment; and, \n12 \n  All plaintiffs complain their First Amendment rights were violated by the silence rule at meals, \n13 \nfor sure, and more specifically to the Subclass plaintiffs, by retaliation and punishment of them in \n14 \nresponse to requests and entreaties for medical and other assistance. \n15 \n \n16 \n  TWO.  The same pattern and practice, and the events and injuries and deprivations which have \n17  arisen therefrom as described and to be shown, also violate Sections One, Seven, Thirteen and \n18  Seventeen of the Constitution of the State of California, together with the state laws that have been \n19  invoked hereinbefore---and particularly Penal Code ยงยง3409, 3410-3426, 6030; 15 C.C.R. ยง3355.2---\nand tortious and wrongful actions including that for the wrongful deaths of the stillborn or miscarried, \n20 \ninjuries engendered by the miscarriage to plaintiffsโ own person, constitutionally-protected right of \n21 \nfamilial association, companionship, and society by plaintiffs with their respective child; these \n22 \ntransgressions obviously involve coercion, as such, since they occur in jail, at the hands of armed \n23 \nguards, and they are thus actionable under the Bane Act, which provides for injunction and damages, \n24 \npenalties, fees, etc, for violation of constitutional or statutory rights โby threat, intimidation or \n25 \ncoercion.โ  Cal Civil Code ยง52.1 et seq. \n26 \n  While the lawful authority for an injunction may be duplicative, or overlapping, as between \n27  Civil Code ยง52.1 and U.S. Code ยง1983, there may well be actions at law that are separate, and the \n                                                                    \n28 \n2    523 U.S. 833 (1998) \n \nPage 15 of 18 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. First Amended Complaint     \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 18   Filed 02/01/18   Page 16 of 18\n \nCounty of Alameda will be liable in respondeat for state law judgment(s).  Both statutes provide clear \n1 \nauthority for comprehensive relief in this case, and surely, they can be jointly relied on and invoked  \n2 \nby this Court. \n3 \n  NB:   As of this writing (and filing), because of the haste in which this matter was initiated, \n4 \nplaintiffs are only just now submitting their Notices of Claim, under Sec. 910 of the Government \n5 \nCode, to the Sheriffโs Department, and we recognize that the inevitable denial of these claims by \n6 \ndefendants may take up to 45 days under the Code.  Therefore we agree this Count Two is submitted \n7  in advance, as it were---and in anticipation of denial of the claims---and can be in abeyance until the \n8  inevitable happens or the time runs. \n9   \n  THREE.   In terms of medical care of the Subclass plaintiffs in particular, as noted, plaintiffs \n10 \naccuse the defendants from CFMG, and CFMG as their employer and director, and the County \n11 \ndefendants from deputies on duty in the housing units on up the chain to an undetermined level of \n12 \nsupervision and command in the Department, all acting much in concert with defendant CFMG folk \n13 \n(and they with themโฆ), of โdeliberate indifference to serious medical needsโ under the rule of Estelle \n14 \nv. Gamble 3 as applied to this mixed group in this jail setting, again by way of Sec. 1983.  They \n15 \nclearly, clearly know and are held to know that the law, the official regulations, and their own written \n16 \npolicies arising from the agreement they made in this Court three decades ago, require them to make \n17  an initial examination of all pregnant prisoners, and formulate a treatment plan for each, and to seek \n18  outside placements for them.  They donโt bother with any of it.  This flouts the statutes and the \n19  Constitution, and does amount inter alia to completely illicit punishment under the Fourteenth and \nwe say also the Eighth Amendment \n20 \n  In addition there are claim under state law for tortious and wrongful actions including for the \n21 \nwrongful deaths of the stillborn or miscarried children, injuries engendered by the miscarriages to \n22 \nplaintiffsโ own person, constitutionally-protected right of familial association, companionship, and \n23 \nsociety by plaintiffs with their respective child. \n24 \n   \n25 \n  VIII.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF  \n26 \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court to: \n27 \n                                                                    \n28 \n3   429 U.S. 97 (1976) \n \nPage 16 of 18 \nMohrbacher v.

Certify the Class of women prisoners at Santa Rita under Rule 23, F.R. Civ P., and also \n1 \nthe Subclass of women prisoners who are pregnant, and permit the named plaintiffs and \n2 \ntheir counsel to represent the Class and Subclass and to proceed accordingly.  In the \n3 \nalternative, hold certification of the broad class in abeyance pending further development of \n4 \nthe grounds for it, but recognize the Subclass for all purposes connected with its plea(s) for \n5 \nequitable relief herein. \n6 \n2.  Make findings of fact reflecting the general and specific failings and inadequacies of both \n7  groups of defendantsโ approaches to and practice in the care of pregnant prisoners, the \n8  pattern and practice of defendantsโ non-feasance and maltreatment of pregnant prisoners, \n9  and defendantsโ violations of statutory, regulatory and constitutional requirements in \ndealing with pregnant prisoners. \n10 \n3.  Initiate a serious effort, perhaps with a Rule to Show Cause, to bring about defendantsโ \n11 \nearly compliance with the community treatment program law, and/or any other feasible and \n12 \navailable means and steps to get and keep pregnant women out of the Santa Rita jail. \n13 \n4.  In the event a ready process for getting and keeping plaintiffs out of the jail is not readily \n14 \nfound, and to the extent and for the time any pregnant women are ordered held in the \n15 \nSheriffโs custody, enter a preliminary and permanent Injunction which will,  \n16 \n5.  A. Prohibit defendants from: \n17  a.  coercion or pressure on pregnant prisoners to consent to a preterm termination of \n18  their pregnancy; \n19  b.  placing pregnant prisoners in solitary confinement, and/or ordering them to submit \nto multiple strip searches and body cavity searches without first utilizing less punitive \n20 \nand intrusive means including urine tests and having objectively reasonable grounds \n21 \nto suspect them of hiding contraband; \n22 \nc.  placing pregnant prisoners outdoors without adequate outerwear, and clothing; \n23 \nd.  holding pregnant prisoners outdoors against their will for any length of time, or \n24 \nkeeping the heat down in residential units, and the bright lights on all night; \n25 \ne.  punishing or threatening to punish women prisoners for exercising their right to free \n26 \nspeech during meals or during โpod timeโ; \n27  f.  touching or searching plaintiffโs food unless defendantsโ hands are covered in clean, \n28  and new sanitary gloves; \n \nPage 17 of 18 \nMohrbacher v.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n16 \n1.  This Second Amended Complaint is submitted in response to the Courtโs recognition \n17 \nthat the case evolved, while the Motion demanding emergency intervention was pending, as \n18 \nplaintiffsโ ongoing investigation of maltreatment endured by pregnant women in Santa Rita has \n19 \nrevealed a broadly degraded, oppressive regime in the jail, which violates the rights of all the women \n20 \nheld there in substantial, concrete, injurious ways; the harmfulness of which to pregnant women and \n21 \ntheir babies is obviously then magnified, intolerably. \n22  2.  Pregnant Women Prisoners at Santa Rita are held in conditions, and (mis)treated by its \n23  custody and medical staff, in ways which are wrongful, and oppressive, wholly unjustified by any \n24  legitimate jail purposeโindeed counterproductive to all good faith custody practiceโand harmful, \ninjurious and threatening to the womenโs health and well-being and that of their unborn children, all \n25 \nto a degree which violates their fundamental rights under the Constitutions of the United States, and \n26 \nCalifornia, and also fails to satisfy statutory and regulatory standards and requirements, and indeed \n27 \nthe jailโs own policies.   \n28 \n3.  Sheriffโs Department practices and attitudes towards women prisoners and their needs \n \nPage 2 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 3 of 24\n \nand wants, regarding medical problems, feminine hygiene, sanitation (and rodent infestation), \n1 \nnutrition, the storage, preparation and service of food, laundry, clean-up, etc.โnot to mention harsh \n2 \ndiscipline and illicit punishment, stultified grievance practice, and all the other hot and cold \n3 \ninterpersonal aspects between the keepers and the kept, in the myriad processes of jail lifeโproduce \n4 \na group living environment which is loud, mean, chaotic, remorseless, endlessly stressful and unsafe \n5 \nin all ways.  Pregnant prisoners suffer from a poor, meager and often unwholesome diet, which leaves \n6 \nthemโall of themโconstantly hungry. There is a near-complete lack of regular exercise, and proper \n7  rest, and, truly, basic respect for their singular medical and other needs.  Except for being offered \n8  abortion, sometimes quite urgently; and sometimes, randomly being taken to the hospital for check-\n9  up, they basically get no help, no information, no counseling, no nothing.   \n4.  That is to say that daily life in Santa Rita is toxic and dangerous to a pregnant woman \n10 \nwithout a doubt; and even more so to her baby, that is elementary.  Plaintiffs mean to assert fully the \n11 \nmaterial rights of each unborn child affected hereinโincluding those where the life was lost under \n12 \ndefendantsโ mindless tyranniesโand all other cases found lurking and festering in these dismal \n13 \ncircumstances.  Incrediblyโin the midst of such a hot, joined-battle stage in the case, we received a \n14 \nreport this week of March 26 that a woman prisoner gave birth during her current incarceration and \n15 \nthe baby was immediately taken from her and has not been returned.  Several days later this new \n16 \nmother has been denied any opportunity even to touch her new baby โlet alone hold it, feed it, \n17  comfort it and comfort and console herself in the warmth of the miracle of its whole birth.  It is \n18  beyond any expression of outrage that defendants would employ or associate with anyone with the \n19  deep cruelty, sadism, and perversity of mind and soul that would be required to carry out such a \nmonstrous act, because the mother is a prisoner.  That the pretense will be that โsecurityโ or some \n20 \nother supposed rule required it only makes the story more sickening. \n21 \n5.  Even in the limited amount of investigation we have managed to accomplish since the \n22 \ninception of the case, it is beyond clear, and patent, that the county jail environment is radically \n23 \nunsuitable, deleterious, and gravely threatening and dangerous to expectant mothers; and that the \n24 \nsituation cannot be truly remedied without establishment of calm, appropriate, separate quarters for \n25 \ntheir confinement.  The obvious, fundamental rights, and above all the minimum physical and health \n26 \nneeds of the altogether blameless babies in wombsโgiven the inevitably harsh and unforgiving \n27  nature of county jail life, as shown herein and to be shown; and, more crucially here, the relentless \n28  antagonism and heartless nastiness so frequently shown to women prisoners by so many staff \n \nPage 3 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 4 of 24\n \nmembers, both deputies and so-called medical peopleโrequire no less.   \n1 \n6.  While the effects are less severe, perhaps, and for sure innocent lives-to-be are not \n2 \ndirectly affected, it is obvious that the conditions complained of herein are injuriouslyโand we say \n3 \nunconstitutionallyโvisited upon all the women prisoners at Santa Rita as it is being operated today.  \n4 \nIn the original Complaint, plaintiffs had included an assertion on behalf of all women Santa Rita \n5 \nprisoners that they were all victims of wrongful discrimination vis-a-vis men prisoners there, with \n6 \nrespect to almost all aspects of Life in Jail: jobs, out-of-cell time, programs, family visits, the list goes \n7  on.  A class of all women prisoners was proposed for these claims, which we now seek to adjust, to \n8  accommodate these emergent claims about the harmful conditions all women endure and the \n9  remedies, legal and equitable, they may be entitled to, individually where appropriate, and as a class.  \nAs to which we then alleged a Subclass of the pregnant ones.  \n10 \n7.   Howeverโand this may mean that a separate class is needed rather than a subclassโ\n11 \nplaintiffs mean specifically to include former prisoners who were pregnant, and were or may have \n12 \nbeen maltreated as several of our initial plaintiffs were โwith their various birth outcomes having \n13 \nbeen affected by their time in Santa Rita in whatever demonstrable ways, if anyโgoing back at least \n14 \nthree years; letโs say from January One, 2015, to now.   \n15 \n8.  In contrast, the broad equitable reliefโand, we believe, ongoing supervision by the \n16 \nCourtโwhich will be needed to stop and rectify the miserable, egregious flow of nonfeasance, \n17  misfeasance and malfeasance, which denies basic rights on a wholesale basis, to a degree which \n18  absolutely shocks the conscience, with which this jail is run.  But it must be noted, as the Court saw, \n19  that the case has expanded factually to include claims of all women, the Class, against the lousy \nconditions the plight of pregnant women first brought to light.   \n20 \n9.  So here we will adopt and re-allege the descriptions and stories and events recounted \n21 \nby the many women who have come forward, and asked to be included, who we are also naming as \n22 \nadditional plaintiffs, whose sworn declarations recounting their experience and knowledge of events \n23 \nand conditions in Santa Rita are already before the Court.  These serve as a cumulating factual \n24 \npredicate for the Injunction claims the actions and practices of the defendants gave rise and still give \n25 \nrise to, as well as to possible damage actions by or for individual class or Subclass members, or either \n26 \nen masse. \n27  10.  Of course, this Second Amended Complaint is made and submitted upon the Courtโs \n28  own determination that the previous vehicle wouldnโt do, and so it is doubly subject to scrutiny as \n \nPage 4 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 5 of 24\n \nhere proposed, and the undersigned prays for approval of this Second Amended Complaint โwith \n1 \nlooks forward to the further refinement and exploration of the issues, and rules, and needs... \n2 \n**     **      **      ** \n3 \n11.  Beyond the urgent issues involving pregnancy, the plaintiffs herein (in their final \n4 \ngrouping), on behalf of themselves and all women prisoners at Santa Ritaโwhose injuries and \n5 \ndeprivations at the hands of defendants do not involve pregnancy, but very often do involve nasty and \n6 \nhostile refusals to acknowledge or respond to feminine hygienic needsโnow also again complain as \n7  a Class, as described and asserted within, of extensive, systematic discrimination against the women \n8  prisoners at Santa Rita, compared to the men.  Invidious treatment of women occurs in all aspects of \n9  life in the jail: jobs, food, access to bathrooms, showers, hygiene, clean clothes, fresh air and out-of-\ncell time, education classes and activities, counseling, phone calls, family visits, and more.  These \n10 \nwomen also seek injunctive relief, under the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments per \n11 \nR.65 F.R.Civ P., and the Bane Act (Cal Civil Code ยง52.1)โrequiring a total cessation of inhumane \n12 \nand sexually and gender-biased unequal treatment and forms of treatment of women prisoners by \n13 \ndefendants, and providing effective, outside monitoringโon behalf of themselves and others \n14 \nsimilarly situated, namely women prisoners currently held or to be held in the future at the \n15 \nSanta Rita Jail, as a Class, per Rule 23, F.R.Civ. P.  Plaintiffs likewise seek full compliance with 15 \n16 \nCCR Titles 11 and 12; full and appropriate compliance with California Penal Code ยง6030, full \n17  implementation of California Penal Code ยง3409, and implementation of Penal Code ยง1170.06 and \n18  California Health & Safety Code ยง11222, particularly for the benefit of pregnant women; all to \n19  ensure the proper care and treatment of women prisoners. \n12.  This Second Amended Complaint thus adds additional named plaintiffs, listed below; \n20 \nadds as defendants ARAMARK Correction Services, LLC (โAramarkโ) and its involved personnel. \n21 \n13.  As before, plaintiffs have named several high-ranking members of the defendant \n22 \nSheriffโs Department individually, along with a number of John and Jane Does who are guards and \n23 \nother staff members who have been involved in the various tyrannies against women prisoners \n24 \ncomplained of hereinโand whose number will now include various unknown and named contractors \n25 \nand their other employees assigned to the Santa Rita accountโall of whom will or would be subject \n26 \nto the injunctional orders, directions and prohibitions sought herein, as co-defendants;  \n27  14.  Also named are the Sheriffโs Department and the County itself, CFMG, Inc. also, in \n28  respondeat with respect to the State Law claims herein; and also for their unconstitutional explicit \n \nPage 5 of 24 \nMohrbacher v.

New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 US \n2 \n568 (1978). \n3 \n15.  Plaintiffs name ARAMARK Correctional Services, L.L.C.โand JOHN & JANE \n4 \nROEs Nos. 51-100, their involved cooperators and employeesโas co-defendants; where, in truth, \n5 \nthey are third party defendants vis-a-vis the defendant Sheriff et al, who plaintiffs continue to charge \n6 \nare fully responsible for all the food-related horrors and defaults that have befallen plaintiffs, and \n7  who cannot be permitted to foist responsibility on this deep-pocket corporate behemoth, who the \n8  Sheriff is in the Meals Ready to Eat business with resulting in the sadistic denial of adequate food, \n9  service f stale, expired, old and spoilt food, food that has been contaminated by rodents and other \nvermin, the requirement that pregnant women and women prisoners in general are deprived of decent, \n10 \nfresh,  nutritious and tasty food; resulting in pregnant women and women prisoners remaining hungry \n11 \nin order to encourage and require that the prisoners purchase commissary. \n12 \nII. JURISDICTION & VENUE \n13 \n15.  The Jurisdiction of this honorable Court derives from the provisions of the First, \n14 \nFourth, Fifth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United State Constitution, by way of the \n15 \nCivil Rights Acts, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง1981 (as to certain plaintiffs), 1983 et seq. and 1988;  28 U.S.C. \n16 \nยง1331 (claims arising under the United States Constitution) and ยง1343 (claims brought to address \n17 \ndeprivations, under color of state authority, of rights privileges, and immunities secured by the United  \n18  States Constitution), and, by pendent jurisdiction,  Secs. 52.1, and 50, of the California Civil Code.   \n19  Intradistrict Assignment \n20  16.  The claims alleged herein arose in the County of Alameda, State of California. \nTherefore, venue and assignment, under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b), lies in the United States District Court \n21 \nfor the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division or Oakland Division. \n22 \nIII.  PARTIES \n23 \nPlaintiffs \n24 \n17.  In this Second Amended Complaint the following additional present and former Santa \n25 \nRita prisoners, pregnant and otherwise, are joining the original plaintiffs, some as members of the \n26 \npregnant Subclass and all as would-be representatives of the Class as a whole.  ERIN ELLIS, \n27 \nDOMINIQUE JACKSON, JAIME JOHNSTON are each pregnant prisoners currently in the custody \n28 \nand control of the Alameda County Sheriffโs office. Each of them wishes to carry her pregnancy to \n \nPage 6 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.

JACLYN MOHRBACHER and CHRISTINA \n2 \nZEPEDA are formerly pregnant prisoners who suffered a miscarriage due to the mistreatment \n3 \nreceived at the hands of defendants, while under the custody and control of the Alameda County \n4 \nSheriffโs Office.  ALEXIS WAH, KELSEY ERWIN, DENISE ROHRBACH, SHANI JONES, \n5 \nDAWN DEDRICK, JAMILA LONGMIRE, NATALIE GARRIDO, JAZMINE TATE, MONICA \n6 \nNUNES, are women who were formerly imprisoned at Santa Rita jail. MARCAYSHA \n7  ALEXANDER, ANDANNA IBE, ANDRANIA YANCY, SANDRA GRIFFIN, DIAMOND \n8  COOPER, MARY MAPA, ROSE PEREZ, MARTINA GOMEZ, TIKISHA UPSHAW, ANNETTE \n9  KOZLOWSKI are currently incarcerated prisoners in Santa Rita Jail.   \n18.  All plaintiffs whether formerly incarcerated or currently incarcerated, experienced and \n10 \nendured the repeat, rampant, and continual and mistreatment including the unequal (as compared to \n11 \nmen) treatment, that women prisoners receive include insufficient classes and work opportunities, \n12 \nlack of clean laundry; insufficient laundry; lack of sanitation, and unhygienic conditions;  insufficient \n13 \nand lack of feminine hygiene supplies; unhygienic, frequently rodent infested, insufficient and poor \n14 \nquality food; denial of First Amendment rights by being denied the right to speak during meals upon \n15 \npain of punishment and being told where to sit; enduring the arbitrary infliction of punishment \n16 \ndepending on the mood or often whim of the sheriffโs deputy on duty; lack of adequate mental health \n17  care; denial of regular outdoor recreation opportunity; and denial of POD time.  \n18  19.  In addition, JAMILA LONGMIRE, experienced an egregious lack of medical care in \n19  Santa Rita Jail when she fell off a bunk and fractured her back, was made to sleep on a mat on the \nfloor of her pod and was not given medical care for weeks after the fall.   \n20 \n20.  ANDANNA IBE, currently incarcerated in Santa Rita, gave birth while incarcerated in \n21 \nNovember 2017 at Highland Hospital, was unable to call any family or friends to be present during \n22 \nlabor, had to endure labor while being viewed by two deputies, including male deputies.  \n23 \nImmediately following the delivery of her child, was forced to be chained and shackled to her \n24 \nhospital bed, spread-eagle with two male guards in her hospital room minutes after giving birth.  Her \n25 \nbaby was taken away without being given the opportunity to even touch her baby.  She was denied \n26 \nthe use of a breast pump.

Defendant ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE is a โpublic entityโ within the \n3 \ndefinition of Cal. Govt. Code ยง 811.2; Defendant GREGORY J. AHERN is the Sheriff of Alameda \n4 \nCounty.  As such, he has caused, created, authorized, condoned, ratified, approved or knowingly \n5 \nacquiesced in the illegal, unconstitutional, and inhumane conditions, actions, policies, customs and \n6 \npractices that prevail at Alameda County jails, as described below. He has, therefore, wholly or in \n7  part, directly and proximately caused, and will continue in the future to cause, the injuries and \n8  violations of rights set forth below. Defendant Ahern is sued in his official capacity only. \n9  23.  Defendant BRETT M. KETELES is the Assistant Sheriff for Alameda County in \ncharge of the Detentions and Corrections Unit and defendant TOM MADIGAN is the commander in \n10 \ncharge of the Detentions and Corrections Unit which includes the two Alameda County jails, Glen \n11 \nDyer and Santa Rita, and was so in charge of Santa Rita Jail on December 26, 2016. Defendants \n12 \nBRETT KETELES, TOM MADIGAN, and T. RUSSELL as employees of the Sheriffโs Office and as \n13 \nthe detention and corrections commander for the Sheriffโs Office, held command and policymaking \n14 \npositions.  They, along with Defendant Ahern, participated in the planning, supervision, and the \n15 \nexecution of the manner in which plaintiffs and class members are incarcerated in the Alameda \n16 \ncounty jail facilities and ACSOโs conduct complained of herein.  Defendants BRETT KETELES, \n17  TOM MADIGAN, and T. RUSSELL caused, created, authorized, condoned, ratified, approved or \n18  knowingly acquiesced in the illegal, unconstitutional, and inhumane conditions, actions, policies, \n19  customs and practices that prevail at Alameda County jails, particularly as to the treatment of women \nas described below.  \n20 \n24.  Defendant D. SKOLDQVIST was and is the Watch Commander for Santa Rita Jail. \n21 \nDefendants D. SKOLDQVIST, T. RUSSELL, LT. HATTAWAY and SGT. CALIGARI, were the \n22 \nresponsible officers for Santa Rita Jail.  Defendants, D. SKOLDQVIST, T. RUSSELL, LT. \n23 \nHATTAWAY, SGT. CALIGARI at all times relevant herein, are and were employees of the Sheriff \n24 \nwho held supervisory, command and/or policy-making positions, and who participated in the \n25 \nauthorization, planning, supervision, and the execution of the sheriffโs conduct complained of herein.  \n26 \n25.  At all times relevant herein, the individual Defendants AHERN, KETELES, \n27  MADIGAN and RUSSELL were officers and employees acting under the color of law, under color of \n28  their official authority and in the scope of their employment as Command and Supervisory Personnel \n \nPage 8 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.

Additionally, upon information and belief, one or more of \n1 \nthese Defendants failed, with deliberate indifference to plaintiffsโ and class membersโ rights, to \n2 \nadequately train and supervise ACSO sheriffโs deputies and staff who were involved in violating the \n3 \nrights of the plaintiffs and class members. All of the above individual defendants are sued in their \n4 \nindividual and official capacities.  \n5 \n26.  At all times relevant herein, all of the above individual Defendants Deputies DIVINE, \n6 \nDEBRA FARMANIAN, CAINE, TANIA POPE, DEPUTY โAโ, and DEPUTY โSโ, were officers \n7  and employees were acting under the color of law, under color of authority and in the scope of their \n8  employment with the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, and were the guards and deputies on duty at \n9  Santa Rita Jail with direct control over plaintiffs and members of the class.   \nMedical services defendants \n10 \n27.  CFMG and its various employees and sub-contractors, are apparently retained by the \n11 \nCounty to provide medical services to Santa Rita prisoners on behalf of the defendant Sheriffโs \n12 \nDepartment; and the County defendants apparently believe, and assert, that, in making a contract with \n13 \nCFMG for that purpose, the Department and its defendant minions shed and shifted and absolved \n14 \nthemselves of any responsibility or liability for timely and effective delivery of such services to \n15 \nprisoners in their custody. Needless to say, plaintiffs disagree absolutely that the County defendants \n16 \nare to any degree โoff the hook,โ or insulated from legal responsibility for provision of proper care to \n17  prisoners in their custody by virtue of such a third-party arrangement.  Rather, the newly-added \n18  medical personnel---unknown individuals named herein as RICK & RUTH ROEs Nos. 1-50---and \n19  their employer are jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs and the Subclass, with the County \ndefendants, for the failures and deficiencies in the care and attention provided to pregnant prisoners. \n20 \nFood services defendants \n21 \n28.  Aramark Correction Services, LLC, has self-identified as the entity with whom the \n22 \nprimary defendant, Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, and the County of Alameda, contracts with to \n23 \nprovide MRE or meals ready to eat for the prisoners under the Sheriffโs custody and control as well \n24 \nas a profit business center in preparing these MREs for sale and distribution to other jail and custodial \n25 \nfacilities.  The County defendants apparently believe, and assert, that, in making a contract with \n26 \nAramark for that purpose, the Department and its defendant minions shed and shifted and absolved \n27  themselves of any responsibility or liability for timely and effective delivery of such services to \n28  prisoners in their custody. Needless to say, plaintiffs disagree absolutely that the County defendants \n \nPage 9 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 10 of 24\n \nare to any degree โoff the hook,โ or insulated from legal responsibility for provision of proper \n1 \nnutrition to prisoners in their custody nor for the maintenance of sanitary and healthy food \n2 \npreparation facilities by virtue of such a third-party arrangement.  Rather, the newly-added MRE \n3 \npreparation staff---unknown individuals named herein as RICK & RUTH ROEs Nos. 51-100---and \n4 \ntheir employer are jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs and the Subclass, with the County \n5 \ndefendants, for the failures and deficiencies in the food preparation and the actual nutrition and food \n6 \nprovided to pregnant prisoners and other prisoners. \n7  29.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and therefore allege that each of said defendants \n8  DOES 1 through 50, are and/or were agents or employees of Defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA \n9  and ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE and acted within the scope of that agency or \nemployment or under color of state law.  The same is true with respect to the relations between \n10 \ndefendant CFMG and its practitioners and other employees assigned to the Santa Rita account, ROEs \n11 \n1-50, and their involvement in the matters at issue herein; and Aramark and its staff and other \n12 \nemployees assigned to the Santa Rita account, ROEs 51-100 and their involvement in the matters at \n13 \nissue herein;  DOEs 1-50 and ROEs 1-100  are defendants who caused, and are responsible for, the \n14 \nbelow-described unlawful conduct and resulting injuries by, among other things, personally \n15 \nparticipating in the unlawful conduct or acting jointly or conspiring with or aiding and abetting others \n16 \nwho did so; by authorizing, acquiescing in or setting in motion policies, plans or actions that led to \n17  the unlawful conduct; by failing to take action to prevent the unlawful conduct; by failing and \n18  refusing with deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' rights to initiate and maintain adequate training and \n19  supervision; and by ratifying the unlawful conduct that occurred by agents and officers under their \ndirection and control, including failing to take remedial or disciplinary action. Plaintiffs allege that \n20 \nDOEs 1-50 and ROEs 1-100 proximately caused said incidents, injuries, violation of constitutional \n21 \nand legal rights,  and damages by reason of their negligence, breach of duty, negligent supervision, \n22 \nmanagement or control, or by reason of other personal, vicarious or imputed negligence, fault, or \n23 \nbreach of duty, whether severally or jointly, or whether based upon agency, employment, or control \n24 \nor upon any other act or omission.   \n25 \n30.  Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and/or capacities of defendants sued herein as \n26 \nDOE 1-50 and ROE 1-100 and therefore sue said defendants by such fictitious names.  Plaintiff will \n27  amend this FAC further to supply true names and capacities when the same are ascertained and will \n28 \n \nPage 10 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.

DOEs 1-50 are sued in their \n1 \nindividual and official capacities.  \n2 \nIV.  EMERGENCY RELIEF \n3 \n31.  As previously recounted, prisoner-plaintiffs ERIN ELLIS and DOMINIQUE \n4 \nJACKSON remain in dire straits in the Santa Rita Jail, continuously, both being more than four \n5 \nmonths pregnant and in substantial discomfort, with intermittent bleeding, and suffering health \n6 \ncomplications.  Plaintiff JACKSON has a pre-existing cardiac condition, is pregnant with twins, and \n7 \nthe physician who was treating her prior to her incarceration declared that her pregnancy is โhigh \n8  risk.โ  Both women have been explicitly and pointedly denied and refused assistance or \n9  accommodation for their condition by defendants, including but not limited to meaningful attention \n10  from a doctor or other qualified practitioner, adequate and sufficient nutrition.  Instead, they are \nrepeatedly advised they should agree to abortion, or defendants disregard these plaintiffsโ requests for \n11 \nmedical and nutritional assistance. \n12 \n32.  Instead, defendants have repeatedly demanded that plaintiffs agree to have an \n13 \nabortion, accused plaintiffs of being drug addicts, and refused all other recognition and assistance for \n14 \neach plaintiffโs delicate condition.  Other pregnant womenโincluding those who miscarriedโhave \n15 \nsimilarly been scorned, branded and mistreated in the jail in recent timesโunder a regime marked by \n16 \na striking and most distasteful animosity towards women prisoners---and particularly those thought, \n17 \nrightly or wrongly, to have addiction issues, and studied, often openly scornful, indifference to their \n18  serious medical and hygienic needs. \n19  33.  These women now seek extraordinary relief from this Court on an emergency basis, in \n20  circumstances where all the plaintiff-prisoners are acutely aware that three pregnant women have \nrecently miscarried in the jail or just after getting out, after being denied medical assistance; and a \n21 \nthird was left in labor, screaming all night, in a solitary confinement cell.  Thus, all plaintiffs must \n22 \nlegitimately fear that they will be ignored and left to languish without help, even if beginning to \n23 \nmiscarry, unless this Court intervenes with Order(s) sufficient to guarantee protection of their health \n24 \nand well-being, and that of her unborn child. \n25 \n34.  Plaintiffs therefore seek a comprehensive remedy, by decree involving big oversight, \n26 \ndiscussed further below, which will ensure that they and all pregnant women prisoners who come \n27 \ninto defendantsโ custody receive all needed accommodationโincluding decent, nourishing food, \n28 \nwarm clothing and blankets, proper rest, fresh air and exercise, etc, as well as timely medical \n \nPage 11 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 12 of 24\n \nattention and monitoring, doctor and hospital visits, and pre-natal counseling along with, where \n1 \nneeded, addiction servicesโfrom defendant Sheriffโs and CFMG staff members while they are in \n2 \ncustody. \n3 \nV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n4 \n35.  The โmission statementโ for the defendant Alameda County Sheriffโs Department \n5 \nstates that the Department will provide โHumane treatment to those in our custody, while \n6 \ndemonstrating: Ability to enforce the law fairly; Commitment to professionalism; Service to the \n7 \ncommunity with integrity and trust; and, Obligation to duty with honor and pride.โ  But the facts \n8  show that women prisoners are not treated humanely, and the law is not fairly applied.  Women \n9  receive unfair and discriminatory treatment on a routine basis, including being short changed on \n10  access to education and work, and;  \n36.  Greater limitations than male prisoners to clean laundry, feminine hygiene products, \n11 \nthe ability to converse with others, and even the freedom to choose where to sit during meals.   \n12 \n37.  The Santa Rita jail is one of two jails in Alameda County, located in the remote \n13 \neastern reaches, near Dublin.  The other jail is in downtown Oakland.  Women are held only at Santa \n14 \nRita.  On information and belief, there are approximately 250 women held there at any given time, of \n15 \nwhom, on average, about ten are pregnant.  Most of these women prisoners are pre-trial detainees \n16 \nunable to afford bail, but quite a number are also serving time, mostly for probation violations.  In the \n17 \ncourse of a year, roughly 150 pregnant women will have been under the custody and control of the \n18  Alameda County Sheriffโs Office at Santa Rita for some period of time.  \n19  38.  The Sheriffโs Department has a contract with the California Forensic Medical Group, \n20  CFMG, to provide necessary medical care and services to prisoners at Santa Rita, under which \nCFMG apparently assigns various practitioners and other personnel who work at the jail, and others \n21 \nwho visit intermittently for various purposes.  CFMG is said to set the procedures and protocols by \n22 \nwhich prisoners receive (or donโt receive) medical attention and care, including the supervision and \n23 \nmanagement of the โinfirmaryโ and the Undersigned have been advised that the Sheriffโs Department \n24 \nregards CFMG as wholly and solely responsible for dealing with any and all medical problems that \n25 \nSanta Rita prisoners may have, including pregnancies.   \n26 \n39.  The Sheriffโs Department has a contract with the Aramark Correctional Services, \n27 \nLLC, to produce over 15,000 meals a day, on the premises at Santa Rita Jail.  These meals are used to \n28 \nfeed the prisoners, including plaintiffs and class members, incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail, as well as \n \nPage 12 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 13 of 24\n \nto provide a revenue stream through sales of MRE to other county jails in the area.   On information \n1 \nand belief, the Undersigned asserts on information and belief that the Sheriffโs Department and \n2 \nAramark are jointly responsible for the operation, management and maintenance of the food \n3 \nproduction, inasmuch as the Sheriff provides the prison labor, at no cost, to staff and work in the food \n4 \npreparation, and deputies provide security and oversight along side Aramark employees.    \n5 \nA.  Maltreatment of Pregnant Women Prisoners \n6 \n40.  In point of fact, the practice of CFMG practitioners and other personnel in monitoring \n7  and attending to the progress of pregnancies amount women at Santa Rita, and the level of concern or \n8  engagement in the project of such care, is simply dismal.   \n9  41.  Pursuant to 15 CCR ยง1210(b) the Sheriff is required to have each pregnant inmate \nexamined by an Obstetrical Physician or Obstetrical Nurse Practitioner, and to develop an \n10 \nindividualized โtreatment plan.โ  To plaintiffsโ knowledge, no plan of care is or has been since \n11 \nlongtime developed for each pregnant prisoner, and the โcareโ provided ignores altogether the \n12 \nharmful and detrimental consequences to mother and fetus of the unnecessarily and unjustifiably \n13 \npunitive and stress-inducing regimens for women prisoners at Santa Rita.  These include madly \n14 \nfrequent, all pervasive strip searches and body cavity searches, a profligate, also unjustified use of \n15 \nsolitary confinement, routine and regular disregard of pregnant women prisonersโ requests for \n16 \nmedical assistance, and the general practice of scorn and harassment of pregnant women prisoners by \n17  both CFMG and Sheriffโs Department personnel.   \n18  42.  None of the plaintiffs or anyone they know of have been given or told of any treatment \n19  plan.  Women who complain of not feeling well or ask to see a doctor are often harshly accused of \nusing illegal drugs---particularly by Defendant DIVINE, a Sheriffโs deputy---and often punished in \n20 \nSolitary Confinement, or by baseless, wholly unjustified, unconstitutional strip searches or body \n21 \ncavity searches, or by being put outside in the cold for hours on end without warm clothes or \n22 \nblankets. When plaintiffs request that a urine test be administered to disprove the false accusations \n23 \nlevied against them by defendants, defendants refuse, and insist instead on the invasive, humiliating \n24 \nand often injurious strip and body cavity searches. \n25 \n43.  Further, rather than provide and implement plans of care for plaintiffs as required by \n26 \nRegulation, defendants have instituted a program of constant monitoring of pregnant womenโs vital \n27  signs, consisting of recording blood pressure and pulse at least three times a day.  As part of this \n28  โprogram,โ some plaintiffs are awakened between midnight and 4:00 a.m., every night---\n \nPage 13 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 14 of 24\n \nnotwithstanding pregnant womanโs well-known, vital need to get adequate rest---in order for vital \n1 \nsigns to be taken and recorded.   \n2 \n44.  Due to the lack of care plans and refusal to provide for the medical needs of the \n3 \nwomen, women who have been abusing opioids are generally forced to enter immediately into \n4 \nwithdrawal without use of medical intervention.  Defendant Sheriff and Jailโs conduct violate \n5 \nCalifornia Health & Safety Code ยง11222. These women are not provided โmedical aid as necessary \n6 \nto ease any symptoms of withdrawal from the use of controlled substancesโ as required but placed \n7  into the general housing unit and subjected to immediate withdrawal.  Since pregnant women are \n8  assigned the lower bunk, they, not infrequently share bunks with prisoners in the throes of opioid \n9  withdrawal which can involve vomiting and loss of bowel and urinary tract control.  Pregnant women \nthen are at the down-stream reception of these human wastes.  There are no chairs in the Units.  The \n10 \nonly place for pregnant women to sit or lie down is on their bunks.  When these human wastes infest \n11 \ntheir bunks, pregnant women have no place to go, and must weight for the convenience of sheriffโs \n12 \ndeputies to respond with cleaning supplies and fresh linens and blankets.  Nonetheless, these \n13 \nprisoners in withdrawal are not provided any assistance and withdrawal can be ongoing for hours, if \n14 \nnot days. \n15 \n45.  The Defendant Sheriff and Jail are unconcerned about the welfare and safety of their \n16 \nprisoners, and think only in rigid, institutional frameworks of punishment, coercion and control.  \n17  Showers have no shower curtains, and water gets on the bathroom floor.  The bathroom floor has no \n18  drain and the floors are wet, slippery and dangerous.  Prisoners, to remedy these problems, fashion \n19  shower curtains out of plastic bags, and place towels on the floor.  Defendant Sheriff in their frequent \nraids and shakedowns of the housing units, have deemed these shower curtains illegal and routinely \n20 \nrip these shower curtains off and take them away.  As a result of these raids, there have been not \n21 \ninfrequent slips and falls, including slips and falls of pregnant women, who have no means to access \n22 \nthe toilets except to traverse these wet, slippery floors. \n23 \n46.  Plaintiffs receive an extra ration of eight (8) ounces of milk, but otherwise get no \n24 \nadditional fresh fruits, vegetables or other good protein nutrition, and certainly no balanced diet.  \n25 \nMeat products served at the jail are widely regarded, including by plaintiff, as unfit for human \n26 \nconsumption.  Pregnant prisoners are fed a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with perhaps a cookie or \n27  an apple, and their extra cup of milk, for lunch and snack.  Dinner is beans, boiled vegetables and \n28  pasta, with some bread.  In one striking element of the daily routine, coldly illustrating the essentially \n \nPage 14 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 15 of 24\n \nanti-human character of the Santa Rita regime, breakfast is served at 3:30 a.m. each day.  Many \n1 \nwomen and these and other pregnant women in particular donโt have the energy to get up and eat at \n2 \nthat hour or are unwilling to trade their rest for the crappy repast they know awaits them.  In short, \n3 \nthe diet provided is grossly inadequate for the basic nutritional needs of a pregnant woman and her \n4 \ndeveloping child. \n5 \n47.  When the pregnant women report to the staff that they are hungry, the response is that \n6 \nthey should purchase food from the commissary.  The commissary food is overpriced, high in \n7  sodium, additives and preservatives, and low on nutritional value.  Many of these women are from \n8  low income families, and the Sheriff uses every transactional chain to pad his budget.  Family \n9  members must travel to Santa Rita and personally deposit cash into their loved onesโ commissary.  \nUse of the electronic deposits results in up to a 10% of higher surcharge.  Many of these commissary \n10 \nfoods are dried and would normally be rehydrated with boiling or very hot water.  Hot water is \n11 \navailable to the women only during POD time.  And POD time is frequently denied based upon the \n12 \nwhims or the ill-humor of the sheriffโs deputies, sometimes for days.  When denied POD time, the \n13 \nonly means of hydrating food is through the bathroom spigot, which warm produces warm water and \n14 \nhydrates packaged food so that is neither tasty, nor palatable. \n15 \n48.  Many of these women are desperate for food, and yet still refuse to eat the food \n16 \nprovided by defendants.  This is due to the obvious rampant rodent infestation in the kitchen, and \n17  regular reports by the kitchen workers of unsanitary conditions.  There have been reports of rodents \n18  cooked into the beans.  Prisoners have been served meals with live rodents in the food bag or on the \n19  tray.  Prisoners have received meals with rodent feces in the meals.  Prisoners frequently receive \nmeals with clear indications that rodents have partaken of the food before its arrival.  Prisoners report \n20 \nsightings of rodents exiting food carts as food carts arrive at the housing units and exiting \n21 \nrefrigerators holding trays of food in the Housing Unit. \n22 \n49.  As a result of defendantโs apparently programmatic, ingrained habits of maltreatment, \n23 \nand vindictiveness, on the part of individual deputies---especially where women have or have had \n24 \naddiction problems---pregnant women have suffered termination of pregnancy either through \n25 \nmiscarriage, or the fetus losing viability. Plaintiff CHRISTINA ZEPEDA, who was in custody from \n26 \nAugust through November 2017, and as a result of defendantsโ described maltreatment, began \n27  bleeding so badly she was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, where she had a miscarriage.  And \n28  plaintiffs are informed and believe that another woman, Paramdeep Kaur who was pregnant and in \n \nPage 15 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 16 of 24\n \ncustody at Santa Rita this past fall, also suffered a miscarriage.  And Plaintiff JACLYN \n1 \nMOHRBACHER, who at the initiation of this action was pregnant, but due to the brutal treatment of \n2 \ndefendants, including denial of medical care, repeated abusive confinement in solitary, with repeated \n3 \nstrip and body cavity searches, suffered a miscarriage in the interim.  The Defendant Deputies instead \n4 \nof calling for medical assistance, allowed Plaintiff MOHRBACHER to continue bleeding; treating \n5 \nher in such a heartless manner as demonstrated by their refusal to provide her with menstrual pads but \n6 \nforced her for many hours to bleed all over her clothing, while continually falsely accusing her of \n7  misusing drugs. \n8  50.  Also, this past July, in keeping with Santa Ritaโs routine of punishment and abuse for \n9  pregnant prisoners as already recounted, a woman was placed into solitary confinement after she \ncomplained of cramps and pain, Then, despite the mandate for half-hour checks on her condition, all \n10 \nthe deputies and medical personnel ignored her, throughout the night.  The woman was experiencing \n11 \nlabor pains, and she began screaming; her screams went on for hours, and of course were agony for \n12 \nthe other women prisoners to hear echoing throughout the night; and no deputy, or CFMG person, \n13 \nchecked on her welfare before morning; by when this woman, known as Candace Steele had \n14 \ndelivered her baby, alone.  She reported that the umbilical cord was wound around the babyโ neck \n15 \nwhen it emerged, and that she had to poke her finger down its throat---acting on instinct---to get it \n16 \nstarted breathing.  Defendants have asserted that---where such a person, and, implicitly, such an event \n17  apparently occurred---it was because Candace was medically examined and said to be experiencing \n18  false labor---the Braxton-Hicks syndrome---but have failed to justify their wrongful seclusion of \n19  Candace in solitary confinement, the failure to make regular checks on her welfare, actions to muffle \nher screaming and patent refusal to summon medical aid.  \n20 \n51.  This practice of solitary confinement, while labeled differently, results in the same \n21 \nconfinement, being placed in a small cell, with only a bed and toilet, isolated from others, and having \n22 \nvery limited human contact, often up to 23 hours a day of isolation.  This is the same condition when \n23 \npregnant women are placed in the โinfirmaryโ. The infirmary alleged is wholly subject to the control \n24 \nand regulation of defendant CFMG.  The conditions in the infirmary are often even harsher as \n25 \npregnant women are denied beds and forced to sleep on a thin pad on the floor, and the rooms are \n26 \nkept dark so that the only light comes in from the glass in the doorway, so dark that it is not even \n27  possible to read or pick out mouse fecal matter served in meal trays. \n28  52.  In sum, from the accounts of these women, and more who continue to connect and add \n \nPage 16 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 17 of 24\n \ntheir voices---and notwithstanding disclaimers by the County defendants, or CFMG defendants \n1 \nhiding behind obscure provisions of a contract---it is clear there are gross deficiencies in the \n2 \naccommodation of pregnant women prisoners at Santa Rita, which have caused and continue to cause \n3 \ngreat injury to numerous women (e.g., the wrongful death of stillborn children), and deprivation of \n4 \nfundamental rights in the form of widespread, indeed systemic Deliberate Indifference to Serious \n5 \nMedical Needs these women obviously have, and gross denial of Due Process, especially for the \n6 \nunborn, and will go on causing and risking such injuries, losses and deprivations if nothing is done. \n7  B.   Discrimination Against Women in General \n8  53.   Furthermore, Defendantsโ abuse and mistreatment of women prisoners is part and \n9  parcel of the discrimination and unequal treatment meted out to women prisoners as compared to \nmale prisoners.  Women prisoners are denied the educational classes and opportunities available to \n10 \nmale prisoners; denied the access to outdoor (fresh air) or yard time and yard space available to male \n11 \nprisoners.  Defendants impose greater repression and restrictions, including being prohibited from \n12 \ntalking during meals, so that one prisoner cannot offer extra unwanted food to another, or one cannot \n13 \nask for anotherโs unwanted food.  Women prisoners cannot exchange information nor share support \n14 \nregarding defendantsโ programmatic abuse during the one period of time they are together.  Women \n15 \nprisoners have greater restrictions than male prisoners, including being told where to sit during meals.  \n16 \nWomen prisoners are strip searched and subjected to body cavity searches for little or no good \n17  reason---except to maintain domination---with greater frequency and regularity than male prisoners.  \n18  54.  Grievance Procedures.  In order to commence grievance procedures, prisoners are \n19  required to request a grievance form from a Sheriffโs deputy.  The Sheriffโs deputy, per defendant \nSheriffโs policy 16.03 โshallโ provide the prisoner with a grievance form.  However, these deputies \n20 \nfrequently fail or refuse to provide the grievance forms, either informing the women prisoner that she \n21 \nshould not grieve the issue, that the issue is not grievable, or to simply grossly delay and then fail to \n22 \nprovide the forms requested.  While the procedure prescribes that the prisoner is provided a pink \n23 \ncarbon of the completed form with a grievance number, at times the pink carbon is not provided to \n24 \nthe prisoner.  And while the Jailโs โGrievance Unitโ is required to store all grievances filed and \n25 \naddress the grievances, clearly that is not the case. \n26 \n55.  This abuse and mistreatment also directly involves violations of existing jail policies \n27  and procedures, California statutes and California regulations.  Despite repeated complaints and even \n28  prior lawsuits, defendants and each of them failure and refusal to comply with policies and \n \nPage 17 of 24 \nMohrbacher v.

Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 18 of 24\n \nprocedures, California statutes and California regulations, even after notification of resulting injuries \n1 \nand harms, indicates callous and wanton and deliberate disregard for the safety, health and well being \n2 \nof the women prisoners under their control, and clearly shows programmatic mistreatment and abuse \n3 \nof women prisoners compared to men. \n4 \nVI.  CLASS CLAIM \n5 \n56.  Within the meaning of Rule 23, F.R.Civ. P., the Class of women prisoners, and \n6 \nparticularly the Subclass of pregnant prisoners, are both numerous and indeterminate, as women \n7 \ncome into and leave the Jail, so that joinder of all the claims already in view is clearly impracticable. \n8  (R. 23(a)(1).  In any given year, there are as many as 150 pregnant women in defendantsโ custody for \n9  some period of time. Joinder is inherently impractical because the number of unnamed, future class \n10  members who will be pregnant while in defendantsโ custody is unknown and unknowable, and, given \nthe transient nature of the plaintiff population and the temporal limitations of pregnancy, their \n11 \nidentities will vary. Proposed class members are highly unlikely to file individual suits on their own \n12 \nbehalf given the practical, legal, monetary, and fear-based barriers that impede their access to counsel \n13 \nto challenge defendantsโ abusive, coercive and punitive regime---not to mention defendantsโ active \n14 \nmeasures preventing proposed class members from communicating amongst themselves and with \n15 \nlegal counsel.  \n16 \n57.  There are numerous common issues of both law and fact (R. 23(a)(2)), including but \n17 \nnot limited to the factual occurrence, vel non, of:  i) defendantsโ programmatic coercion for abortions, \n18  ii) abuse and mistreatment of pregnant prisoners which threaten the viability of fetuses and often \n19  terminate pregnancies, iii) prohibiting class members from communicating amongst themselves and \n20  with legal counsel, iv) failure to develop statutorily required care plans, v) discrimination against \nwomen in access to services, classes, ability to work, rights and privileges, and, vi) failure to comply \n21 \nwith state laws and regulations on meeting the needs of womenโs reproductive and menstrual needs.  \n22 \nLegal questions, regarding, e.g, the applicability of the various state statutes mentioned above, the \n23 \nConstitutional standards to be applied in assessing the plaintiffsโ claims, and the like, will plainly be \n24 \nthe same with respect to all individual class members. \n25 \n58.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of members of the Plaintiff \n26 \nClass, (R.23(a)(3)), and of members of the Subclass in particular, where all the pregnant women \n27 \nprisoners, past, present and to come, complain in the same terms of the ill effects of defendantsโ \n28 \nnonfeasance and maltreatment, and failure to follow the law.  The fact that different individuals \n \nPage 18 of 24 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office. Second Amended Complaint, Case No. 3:18-cv-00050-JD \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 72   Filed 04/12/18   Page 19 of 24\n \nsuffered or may suffer different degrees of injury---obviously only certain ones suffered miscarriage, \n1 \nfor example---is not a bar to certification, particularly where, as here, the defendants have โacted or \n2 \nrefused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final \n3 \ninjunctive relief;โ per Section (b)(2) of the Rule.  The underlying injuries flowing from practice and \n4 \npolicy are common to all pregnant women at Santa Rita to some serious, health-threatening degree, as \n5 \nwe have shown and will show.  \n6 \n59.  The named plaintiffs will---and are able to---fairly and adequately protect the interests \n7  of the Plaintiff Subclass, per Sub.(a)(4) of the Rule. The named plaintiffs have no interest at odds in \n8  any way with those of the Subclass, and each has affirmed to counsel her desire and willingness to \n9  pursue the matter on behalf of the other women who will come into Santa Rita with child. The \nattorneys representing the named plaintiffs are experienced civil rights practitioners, well able to \n10 \nprosecute and carry on substantial federal constitutional litigation such as this, and with access to \n11 \nadditional help which is even now being assembled for the larger work.  The Undersigned represent \n12 \nto the Court their determination to see this matter through---both as to the urgent immediate \n13 \npregnancy issues and the County defendantsโ broader gender/sex discrimination practices against \n14 \nwomen---and, by the way, we hereby respectfully request that we be designated by the Court as \n15 \ncounsel for the Class of present and future women prisoners at Santa Rita, and the Subclass of those \n16 \namong them who are pregnant. \n17  60.  From the pleadings, and particularly the many sworn affidavits submitted with \n18  plaintiffsโ pending renewed injunction motion, it is clear the defendants acted and now act and will \n19  act โon grounds generally applicable toโ the Subclass, in any case, thereby โmaking final injunctive \nrelief appropriateโ to the class as a whole. The Plaintiff Class may therefore be properly certified \n20 \nunder R.23(b)(2).  Certainly, also it is patent that both factual and legal questions common to the \n21 \nSubclass predominate here over individual concerns, so certification is also proper under Section \n22 \n(b)(3). \n23 \n61.  In sum, plaintiffs are entitled to have the Subclass of pregnant prisoners certified pro \n24 \ntanto at the very least, or otherwise separately from the main class alleged herein, so that the \n25 \nproceedings regarding emergency relief for all pregnant women who are in or may come into Santa \n26 \nRita can go forward without hindrance; and work on the claims of the Class as a Whole can abide \n27  further attention from the parties and the Court in the near future. \n28  // \n \nPage 19 of 24 \nMohrbacher v.

Defendants have a duty of care to plaintiffs and class members to ensure that \n13 \ndefendants did not cause unnecessary or unjustified harm to plaintiffs, and a duty of care to hire, \n14 \ntrain, supervise and discipline Jail employees so as to not cause harm to plaintiff and class members \n15 \nand to prevent violations of their constitutional, statutory and common law rights. \n16 \n75.

Defendants ARAMARK CORRECTIONAL SERVICES, LLC and the ALAMEDA \n11  COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE have implemented and enforced, and without the Courtโs \n12  intervention will continue to implement and enforce, a policy, practice, and/or custom of denying \n13  pregnant women prisoners at Santa Rita Jail food that is adequate to maintain health in violation of \n14  the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment and Article 1, ยงยง7 and 17 of the California Constitution.   \n15  6.  This action seeks to end the barbaric conditions at SRJ regarding medical care and \n16  food.  These practices result in almost universal and inevitable miscarriages suffered by women \n17  who enter SRJ while pregnant.  These practices include coercion by ACSO and \n18  WELLPATH/CFMG staff to force inmates to have abortions.  These practices include the denial of \n19  materials necessary for personal hygiene with regard to inmatesโ menstrual cycle and reproductive \n20  systems.  The practices complained of herein are cruel and inhumane and violate the  most minimal \n21  standards of decency of a civilized society. \n22  7.  Plaintiffs bring this action for injunctive relief, and for monetary damages, \n23  individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated who have been and will be incarcerated at \n24  Santa Rita Jail, and to redress all Defendantsโ violations of their rights under the First, Fourth, \n25  Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and Article 1, ยงยง7 and 17 of \n26  the California Constitution.   \n27 \n28 \n \nPage 3 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.

Plaintiff JAIME JOHNSTON was a pregnant prisoner under the custody and control \n14  of the Alameda County Sheriffโs office.  Plaintiff JAIME JOHNSTON wished to carry her \n15  pregnancy to term and to deliver and have a healthy baby, and accordingly wants and demands no \n16  less than the minimum necessary nutrition, medical and other support which that requires and to \n17  which they are entitled by the U.S. Constitution.  Along with Plaintiffs MOHRBACHER and \n18  ZEPEDA, Plaintiffs  ELLIS, JACKSON, and JOHNSTON also seek to represent a Subclass of \n19  pregnant Santa Rita Jail prisoners. \n20  16.

Defendant ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE (โACSOโ) is a โpublic \n24 \nentityโ within the definition of Cal. Govt. Code ยง 811.2. \n25 \n18.  Defendant GREGORY J. AHERN is, and at all times relevant to this Complaint was, \n26 \nthe Sheriff of Alameda County.  As Sheriff of Alameda County, Defendant Ahern has at times \n27 \nrelevant to this Complaint held a command and policy making position with regard to County Jails, \n28 \n \nPage 5 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.

Defendant Sheriff AHERN has caused, created, authorized, condoned, \n2  ratified,  approved  or  knowingly  acquiesced  in  the  illegal,  unconstitutional,  and  inhumane \n3  conditions, actions, policies, customs and practices that prevail at Santa Rita Jail, as described fully \n4  below.  Sherriff AHERN has, wholly or in part, directly and proximately caused and, in the absence \n5  of the injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek in this Complaint, will continue in the future to \n6  proximately cause, the injuries and violations of rights set forth fully below. Defendant Sheriff \n7  AHERN is sued in his official capacity only.  \n8  19.  Each and every Defendant named herein was at all times relevant to this Complaint \n9  an officer or employee of the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, acting under the color of law within \n10  the meaning of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and acting pursuant to the authority of ASCO and within the \n11  scope of their employment with ASCO. \n12  The Private Contractor Defendants \n13  20.  Defendant WELL-PATH MANAGEMENT, INC  (hereinafter referred to as โWELL-\n14  PATHโ) is an active, for-profit corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware with its principal \n15  place of business in California, located at San Diego, California.   Previously, defendant WELL-\n16  PATH was defendant CALIFORNIA FORENSIC MEDICAL CORPORATION \n17  (โWELLPATH/CFMGโ).  Defendant WELL-PATH and its predecessor defendant CFMG had \n18  entered into written contracts with defendant SHERIFF to provide and is currently engaged in \n19  providing general medical, dental, prenatal and opioid treatment services at Santa Rita Jail.  \n20  Defendants RICK and RUTH ROEs 1-50 are WELL-PATH employees who work at Santa Rita Jail.  \n21  At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants WELL-PATH and RICK and RUTH ROEs 1-25 \n22  were agents of the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, acting under the color of law within the \n23  meaning of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and acting pursuant to the authority of ASCO and within the scope of \n24  their agency with ASCO. \n25  21.  Defendant ARAMARK CORRECTIONAL SERVICES LLC (โARAMARKโ) is an \n26  active, foreign, for-profit Limited Liability Company registered  in the State of Delaware and \n27  licensed to do business in the State of California.  Defendant ARAMARK contracts with ASCO to \n28  operate the kitchens at Santa Rita Jail for the purpose of feeding Santa Rita prisoners.  Defendants \n \nPage 6 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 7 of 40\n \n1  RICK and RUTH ROEs 51-100 are ARAMARK employees who work at Santa Rita Jail.  At all \n2  times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants ARAMARK and RICK and RUTH ROEs 51-100 \n3  were agents of the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, acting under the color of law within the \n4  meaning of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and acting pursuant to the authority of ASCO and within the scope of \n5  their agency with ASCO. \n6  22.  Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued in this \n7  complaint as ROES and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive and therefore sue these defendants by such \n8  fictitious names.  Plaintiffs will amend this complaint to allege their true names and capacities when \n9  ascertained.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that each of the fictitiously \n10  named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the occurrences alleged in this complaint.   \n11  23.  At all times mentioned in this complaint, each Defendant was the agent of the others, \n12  was acting within the course and scope of this agency, and all acts alleged to have been committed \n13  by any one of them was committed on behalf of every other Defendant. \n14  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n15 \n24.  Pursuant to Rules 23(a), (b2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the \n16 \nnamed Plaintiffs seek to represent a Plaintiff class consisting of all women incarcerated at Santa \n17 \nRita Jail (โSRJโ)from January 8, 2016 to the present, or will be in the future.  All women inmates \n18 \nwere discriminated against on the basis of their sex by defendant SHERIFF as follows:  (a) denial to \n19 \nwomen, necessary menstrual pads and the ability to maintain personal and feminine hygiene, (b) \n20 \ndirect and indirect discrimination based upon their sex regarding the provision of clothing; (c) direct \n21 \nand indirect discrimination based upon their sex regarding the provision of clothing; (d) (c) direct \n22 \nand indirect discrimination based upon their sex regarding the provision of clothing;     regarding \n23 \nexercise opportunities, access to exercise opportunities, (c) denial of equal access to classes and \n24 \nother inmate programming.    \n25 \n25.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  In the \n26 \nyear from July 2016 through June 2017 alone, over 9,700 women are incarcerated at SRJ. \n27 \n28 \n \nPage 7 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 8 of 40\n \n1  26.  In addition, joinder is impracticable because, upon information and belief, many \n2  members of the class are not aware of the fact that their constitutional rights were violated and that \n3  they have the right to seek redress in court.  Many members of the class are without the means to \n4  retain an attorney to represent them in a civil rights lawsuit.  There is no appropriate avenue for the \n5  protection of the class membersโ constitutional rights other than a class action. \n6  27.  The  class  members  share  a  number  of  questions  of  law  and  fact  in  common, \n7  including, but not limited to: \n8  a)  whether  ACSO  had  policies  and  practices  directly  and  indirectly  discriminated \n9  against women prisoners in Santa Rita Jail based upon their sex which results in women \n10  prisoners being denied equal privileges and rights; subjected to harsher and more restrictive \n11  conditions  of  confinement;  and  subjected  to  sexual  harassment  as  compared  to  male \n12  prisoners; \n13  b)  whether  ACSO  and  WELLPATH/CFMG  jointly  established  and  implemented \n14  policies specifically designed and intended to deny access to necessary and appropriate \n15  medical care to pregnant women in order to increase the profits of WELLPATH/CFMG and \n16  to reduce WELLPATH/CFMG and ACSOโs costs; \n17  c)  whether  ACSO  and  ARAMARK  jointly  established  and  implemented  policies \n18  specifically designed and intended to deny access to food that is adequate to maintain health \n19  of pregnant women and their unborn fetuses, in order to increase the profits of ARAMARK \n20  and to reduce ACSOโs costs; \n21  d)  whether at all times relevant to this Complaint Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG acted \n22  under color of State law; and, \n23  e)  whether at all times relevant to this Complaint Defendant ARAMARK acted under \n24  color of State law. \n25  28.  The Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of those of the class.  Like the other members of the \n26  class, the Plaintiffs were victims of the Defendantsโ policy, practice, and/or custom of direct and \n27  indirect discrimination against women prisoners. \n28 \n \nPage 8 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 9 of 40\n \n1  29.  The legal theories under which the Plaintiffs seek relief are the same or similar to \n2  those on which all members of the class will rely, and the harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are \n3  typical of the harms suffered by the class members. \n4  30.  The Plaintiffs have a strong personal interest in the outcome of this action, have no \n5  conflicts of interests with members of the class, and will fairly and adequately protect the interests \n6  of the class.  The Plaintiffs have all been subject to conditions of confinement that violate the First, \n7  Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.   \n8  31.  The Plaintiffs are represented by experienced civil rights and class action counsel.  \n9  Plaintiffsโ Counsel have the resources, expertise, and experience to prosecute this action.  Plaintiffsโ \n10  Counsel know of no conflicts among members of the class or between the attorneys and members \n11  of the class. \n12  32.  The Plaintiff class should be certified pursuant to Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the \n13  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  because  the  Defendants  have  acted  on  grounds  generally \n14  applicable to class members, the interests of the Plaintiffs and potential class members are aligned, \n15  and a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \n16  case. \n17  STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n18 \nGeneral Conditions For Women Inmates At SRJ \n19 \n20  33.  SRJโs treatment of and rules and regulations governing women prisoners as compared \n21  to men prisoners are more restrictive and far harsher than, SRJโs rules and regulations governing \n22  male prisoners.  Women prisoners have fewer freedoms, less access to exercise and opportunities \n23  for exercise, less access to out of cell time, and less access to classes and programming. \n24  34.  Holding cells are in area called Intake, Transfer and Release (โITRโ).  Any prisoner \n25  coming into or going out of SRJ must go through ITR, including each and every time a prisoner \n26  goes to court.  Male prisoners are always processed through ITR before women prisoners.  Because \n27  all prisoners entering or leaving SRJ on a given day arrive at ITR at approximately the same time, \n28  women prisoners are thus systematically held in holding cells for a far longer time than are male \n \nPage 9 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 10 of 40\n \n1  prisoners.  Holding cells are concrete boxes, which are almost always very cold and filthy.  They \n2  are rarely cleaned and are full of garbage.  Because women are processed after the jail is finished \n3  processing the men, women are held for significantly longer periods of time in these awful holding \n4  cells.   \n5  35.  Women have fewer jobs available to them, and the jobs are not as good, and for fewer \n6  hours. \n7  36.  The male workers are provided greater perks and freedoms, including the fact that in \n8  the worker pod for the male workers, the cell doors are open in the morning and left open all day, so \n9  that even when a male worker is not on shift, they are not locked in their cell at all.  Women \n10  workers do not have these perks or  freedom.   \n11  37.  Title 15 Section 1240 provides that prisoners should have 15 minutes to eat their \n12  meals.  When the women in HU 21 requested their full 15 minutes to eat a hot meal together on the \n13  tables of the housing unit, the deputies stated that the time for the meals would be deducted from \n14  their pod time.  After that, as retaliation for the women requesting their rights under California \n15  regulations, the deputies then refused to let the women in HU 21 out at all, and required all of the \n16  women to eat their meals inside their cells.  Male prisoners in HU 21 are not and have not been \n17  subjected to this type of restriction.  Male prisoners are permitted out of their cells to eat their \n18  meals, together, in the common area of the housing unit.   \n19  38.  Women have fewer educational classes available for them, and the classes are less \n20  relevant to what women are interested in, want to learn or which would provide real job skills.  \n21  Takisha Upshaw, during her four years of incarceration in Santa Rita Jail was never able to sign up \n22  for a single class. \n23  39.  California Rules of Regulation, Title 15, Section 1265 states that โEach female \n24  inmate shall be provided sanitary napkins, panty liners or tampons as requested.โ  Defendant Sheriff \n25  does not comply with this section1265 Title 15.  Instead, plaintiffs and class members are permitted \n26  to request, only once a day, and upon request, are provided only 4 menstrual pads per day.  The \n27  pads are tiny and thin to begin with and have poor quality glue.  Most women have to use two or \n28  sometimes three pads at a time, in order to prevent bleeding through their clothes.  These pads only \n \nPage 10 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 11 of 40\n \n1  last two hours at the most.  As a result, women routinely suffer from insufficient menstrual pads, \n2  such that women bleed through their clothes.  Because laundry is only once a week, women are \n3  forced to endure dirty bloody clothing for long periods of time.  And if the laundry is short, as it \n4  often is, a prisoner can be stuck in disgusting, filthy, blood stained clothes for longer than a week. \n5  40.  Women prisoners in Santa Rita Jail, in preparation for their monthly menstrual cycle, \n6  start requesting menstrual pads, daily in advance.  However, defendant Sheriff has promulgated and \n7  enforce jail rules that bans โstockpilingโ of menstrual pads, and if a deputy finds a woman prisoner \n8  with more than the allotted 4 menstrual pads, the deputy confiscates the pads, and subjects the \n9  woman prisoner to disciplinary action.  This policy and practice underscores defendant ACSOโs \n10  policies to deny women the ability to maintain \n11  41.  While State regulations mandate that women prisoners have clean laundry once a \n12  week, and clean underwear twice a week, women prisoners are never provided with clean \n13  underwear, much less once a week.  The laundry process at the jail does not get the blood stains out \n14  of the underwear so that underwear for women, distributed by the jail is normally stained and has \n15  pubic hairs stuck to it.  Many prisoners hand wash the supposedly clean laundry exchange \n16  underwear in the shower in a bucket.  When they do so, the water coming off the laundry exchange \n17  underwear is brown.  The condition of underwear distributed by SRJ is a major cause of the \n18  transmission of bacteria from vaginal fluids that are not laundered out by SRJ.  This has resulted in \n19  an epidemic of trichomonas vaginalis, or fungal infections among women prisoners.  \n20  42.  As to other clothing, SRJ staff frequently tells women prisoners that they ran have out \n21  of womenโs underwear.  This is especially difficult for women because ACSOโs rules require \n22  women to wear bras, and the bras in the laundry are generally in the wrong sizes and in short \n23  supply.  Women have gotten fungal rashes on their breasts from the bras that have not been \n24  properly laundered.  Other clothing is also often returned from laundry exchange blood-stained and \n25  dirty.  Therefore, most women prisoners try to hand wash clothes to guarantee some level of \n26  personal hygiene.  Pre-Covid,  SRJ did not provide soap.  A prisoner had to purchase the body wash \n27  from the commissary to use for hand washing clothing.  After  Covid, the jail now provides small \n28  bars of Bob Barker soap which is very harsh and caustic to use.   \n \nPage 11 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 12 of 40\n \n1  43.  Except for panties and bras, the clothing provided by defendant Sheriff are neither \n2  designated nor manufactured for women.  All the other clothing, (all clothing except for panties and \n3  bras) have, as the smallest size, menโs large.  For the majority of women, the tee shirts and jail outer \n4  wear is too large, particularly with the length of the pants, which must be repeatedly rolled up or \n5  else will cause a tripping hazard.  The socks are menโs size socks and are always several inches too \n6  long.  Wearing too long socks with jail plastic slip on shoes that are too large, make it difficult for \n7  women to properly walk, much less be able to run and exercise.  No woman prisoner is provided \n8  shorts or boxers.  No woman prisoner is permitted to wear shorts. \n9  44.  Defendant Sheriff has promulgated rules which prohibit only the women inmates \n10  from being out of cell unless they are fully dressed with all underwear, tee shirt and the top and \n11  bottom outer wear.  This includes for exercise.  Because of the size of the outwear, and the fact that \n12  the socks and plastic slip on shoes provided by defendant Sheriff, are generally significantly larger \n13  than the women prisonerโs feet, most women find it difficult if not impossible, to engage in active \n14  movement, such as running or jumping, or other forms of vigorous aerobic exercise in the too-large \n15  pants and too-large socks, and plastic slip-on shoes without the threat of a tripping hazard.  The \n16  weight of the clothing and the size of the clothing binds the movement of women prisonerโs arms \n17  and legs.  Furthermore, because only women (and not men) are not provided appropriate exercise \n18  clothing such as shorts, and required to wear underwear, tee shirt and all outerwear whenever they \n19  are out of cell, women more easily overheat when they try to exercise, and are deterred from \n20  exercising because they do not want to sweat into clothing that they have to wear for an entire \n21  week.  Male prisoners are permitted to exercise shirtless in just a pair of boxer shorts.  Defendant \n22  Sheriffโs rule deter women prisoners from exercising and are objectively discriminatory against \n23  women prisoners based upon their gender. \n24  45.  Women inmates at SRJ receive fewer privileges than men and are subject to more \n25  restrictions, with no valid penological interest.  Men are allowed to hand wash clothing and hang \n26  them from the bars of their bed.  Women are not and when they hang laundry off their beds, the \n27  guards confiscate these items.   Women have less access to yard time and exercise opportunities.  \n28  Santa Rita Jail has a Big Yard which has grass, is large and spacious, is open to the sky and has  a \n \nPage 12 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 13 of 40\n \n1  view of the east bay hills.  Male prisoners , on a daily basis, have access to the Big Yard.   The large \n2  size of the yard, the view of the sky and the east bay hills gives relief from the oppression of jail.   \n3  Women almost never have access to the Big Yard and are almost always given access for outside \n4  recreation only to a concrete pen that is jail structure on all sides and the top is covered with netting.  \n5  There is no grass or open space in the concrete pen.   Women report that if they get access to the \n6  large yard, once a year, they are lucky. \n7  46.  The womenโs small yard is a concrete pen about the size of a basketball court.   The \n8  menโs yard is the size of several football fields, and has exercise equipment and exercise stations.  \n9  The womenโs concrete pen has one basketball hoop and one rusted chin up bar.  Women prisonersโ \n10  fewer privileges and have significantly less access to exercise and outdoor exercise when compared \n11  to male prisoners, is objectively discriminatory. \n12  47.  Women prisoners at Santa Rita Jail regularly are deprived of and lack the ability to \n13  maintain personal sanitation; do so at the peril of being subjected to discipline and punishment; and \n14  are in fact subjected to discipline for the effort to maintain personal sanitation.    The jail provides a \n15  free kit to those who do not have funds to purchase commissary.  The free kit contains a bottle of \n16  body wash which is appropriate for use on body parts with mucus membranes.  For those who have \n17  funds to purchase commissary, the jail will refuse to provide a free kit, and so the women have to \n18  purchase their own soaps and shampoos which is appropriate for use on body parts with mucus \n19  membranes.    When a woman prisoner is disciplined, a common punishment is to deny the woman \n20  the ability to purchase commissary for some period of time.  Women are subjected to greater \n21  restrictions and discipline is more frequently handed out over minor infractions.   However, if the \n22  woman is not indigent, the jail refuses to provide the free kit and because a woman prisoner on \n23  discipline cannot purchase soap through the commissary, she will often be deprived of soap for the \n24  time period she is on discipline.  The Bob Barker soap provided by the jail has the active ingredient \n25  of benzethonium chloride which is harsh on the skin and especially caustic on mucus membranes.  \n26  Because of its harsh and caustic qualities, women are unable to use the Bob Barker soap for \n27  feminine hygiene.  Therefore, when subject to discipline and the ban from purchasing commissary, \n28  a female prisoner who does not qualify for the free kit, is unable to purchase appropriate and \n \nPage 13 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 14 of 40\n \n1  necessary soap and is unable to properly wash and maintain personal sanitation and feminine \n2  hygiene.  This is particularly onerous during the time of menstruation.  These jail rules are \n3  indirectly discriminatory against women, creating barriers and difficulties for women in \n4  maintaining necessary personal cleanliness and feminine hygiene. \n5  48.  Defendant Sheriff has also promulgated rules banning prisoners from having plastic \n6  bags.  However, in HU 21, the showers are not in the cells, but are outside in the POD area.  Many \n7  women need to have a plastic bag in order to hold their comb, soap, shampoo and other items \n8  necessary for a womanโs personal hygiene, and carry these items to the shower.  However, having \n9  such a plastic bag, again subjects the woman prisoners to discipline from the deputy, if the deputy \n10  sees the plastic bag.  The rule against plastic bags indirectly discriminates against women, creating \n11  barriers and difficulties for women in maintaining personal cleanliness and hygiene, which the male \n12  prisoners do not suffer. \n13  49.  Prisoners are prohibited from having hair ties or other means of tying their hair up.  \n14  This rule indirectly discriminates against women because women generally have longer hair than \n15  men, and as a result have no means to tie up or back their hair or otherwise keep their hair tidy.  The \n16  hair grooming equipment which the jail provides are electric clippers, a curling iron and a hair \n17  dryer.  Electric clippers are useful for maintaining male hairstyles and most menโs hair, particularly \n18  for men who buzz their hair.  Electric clippers are not usable for cutting womenโs generally longer \n19  hair  when compared to men. longer.  The jail does not provide or permit hair brushes.  The only \n20  hair care implements available are a comb with fine teeth that break on or gets easily snarled on \n21  longer hair, an afro pick, or a palm brush.  None of those items work as a hair brush for women and \n22  long hair.  Therefore, most women, during their incarceration in Santa Rita Jail, are unable to comb \n23  their hair, are unable to properly groom their hair and are unable to get haircuts.  The men, in \n24  housing unit 21 have a mirror in the common area of the housing pod, which they can use to \n25  perform self-grooming.  The women are not provided a mirror and cannot do self-grooming.  The \n26  rule against hair ties, the lack of hair brushes and the male oriented hair clippers indirectly \n27  discriminates against women, creating barriers and difficulties for women in maintaining personal \n28  appearances, which is especially detrimental when women have to appear in court, and are required \n \nPage 14 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 15 of 40\n \n1  to appear in court with their face and hair in disheveled and unkempt physical state, whereas men \n2  are able to appear in court with tidy and neat hair.   \n3  50.  Furthermore, ACSO has installed surveillance cameras in the womenโs bathrooms \n4  and showers, with a direct view of women when they are on the toilet or in the shower.  The \n5  overwhelming number of deputies and technicians at Santa Rita Jail are male.  The presence of \n6  these surveillance cameras subject these women to invasion of their personal privacy, is a form of \n7  sexual harassment, and a deterrent for women to conduct personal hygiene and feminine sanitation. \n8  51.  All women prisoners are subjected to the conditions described herein in paragraphs \n9  33 through 50. \n10  Sheriff Ahearnโs Private Contracts for Food & Medical Services \n11  52.  Over the past five years, Sheriff Ahearn has overseen an unprecedented increase in \n12  the salaries of Sheriffโs office personnel at Santa Rita Jail.  Salaries and benefits at SRJ have \n13  increased by $12.44 million dollars since 2013.  As a result, being a jail guard at SRJ is one of โ if \n14  not the most โ remunerative jobs in the entire country that a high school graduate with no college \n15  education can get.  A starting jail guards make approximately $100,000 per year in salary and \n16  benefits.  This is not counting overtime payments available. \n17  53.  That $12.4 million dollar salary increase, and the $1.7 million increase in overtime \n18  between 2013 and 2018 amounted to almost 50% of the Sherriffโs office SRJ budget increases over \n19  that period. \n20  54.  Over the same period, while remuneration for Sheriffโs office deputies and personnel \n21  at SRJ increased by nearly 18%, the SRJ jail population for whom the Sherriff was responsible, \n22  declined.   \n23  55.  According to ACSO, the average daily population at SRJ was 3,431 inmates in June \n24  2013 and had fallen to 2,825 by June 2015.  Upon information and belief, the current average daily \n25  population is approximately 2,200.  Thus, the population at SRJ has declined by about 30% at the \n26  same time that remuneration for Sheriffโs office deputies and personnel at SRJ increased by over \n27  18%.  \n28 \n \nPage 15 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 16 of 40\n \n1  56.  Moreover, during this period, ACSO entered into contracts with private, for-profit \n2  companies to provide basic and crucial services to SRJ inmates.   \n3  ACSOโs Contract with WELLPATH/CFMG \n4  57.  In this regard, ACSO contracts with Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG to provide all \n5  health care services of any type needed by any inmate at SRJ.  WELLPATH/CFMGโs contract \n6  specifies a set price based on average daily inmate population (โADPโ). \n7  58.  Crucially, the WELLPATH/CFMG contract specifies that WELLPATH/CFMG itself \n8  is solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with any health care services provided to \n9  inmates outside the jail and that WELLPATH/CFMG is not entitled to and will not receive any \n10  reimbursement from ACSO for the cost of services provided to inmates by hospitals or by any non-\n11  WELLPATH/CFMG  personnel.  The  cost  for  all  such  services  is  borne  solely  by \n12  WELLPATH/CFMG.  \n13  59.  ACSOโs contract with WELLPATH/CFMG explicitly states that \n14  WELLPATH/CFMG will pay for any and all โinpatient hospitalization costs, emergency room \n15  visits, ambulance transportation expenses, outpatient surgeries, outpatient physician consultations, \n16  outside specialist fees, off-site diagnostic procedures.โ  If an inmate receives such medical services, \n17  WELLPATH/CFMG must pay the total cost of the medical care provided, โregardless of the level \n18  of cost incurred.โ \n19  60.  The contract specifies that WELLPATH/CFMG alone will determine โthe necessity \n20  and appropriateness of inpatient hospital care and other outside medical services.โ \n21  61.  Incredibly, the contract also specifies that in the event a third-party payor such as an \n22  insurer pays for part or all of any medical service provided to an inmate outside the walls of SRJ, \n23  WELLPATH/CFMG must turn over half of that third-party payment to the Sheriffโs office.  In \n24  other words, even if WELLPATH/CFMG is reimbursed for its costs for outside medical care \n25  provided to inmates, the Sheriffโs office takes half of the reimbursement even though it paid \n26  nothing for the outside medical care. \n27  62.  By requiring WELLPATH/CFMG to pay for any and all medical care provided \n28  outside of SRJ to any SRJ inmate, and by limiting WELLPATH/CFMGโs ability to recover any \n \nPage 16 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 17 of 40\n \n1  amount WELLPATH/CFMG pays for such care, ACSOโs contract with WELLPATH/CFMG \n2  creates a financial incentive and imperative for WELLPATH/CFMG to refuse and withhold needed \n3  and appropriate outside medical services to all inmates, including pregnant inmates, when the \n4  needed and appropriate medical services consist of โinpatient hospitalization costs . . . outpatient \n5  physician consultations, outside specialist[s, or] off-site diagnostic procedures,โ among other \n6  services. \n7  63.  By specifying that WELLPATH/CFMG alone will determine โthe necessity and \n8  appropriateness of inpatient hospital care and other outside medical services,โ ACSOโs contract \n9  with WELLPATH/CFMG enables WELLPATH/CFMG to refuse and withhold needed and \n10  appropriate outside medical services to SRJ inmates, including pregnant inmates, when the needed \n11  and appropriate medical services consist of โinpatient hospitalization costs . . . outpatient physician \n12  consultations, outside specialist[s, or] off-site diagnostic procedures,โ among other services. \n13  64.  โ[O]utpatient  physician  consultations,  outside  specialist[s  and]  off-site  diagnostic \n14  proceduresโ within the meaning of the WELLPATH/CFMG contract include any outside or off-site \n15  OBGYN services, including prenatal care, provided to pregnant SRJ inmates. \n16  65.  โ[I]npatient hospitalization costsโ within the meaning of the WELLPATH/CFMG \n17  contract includes hospitalization of an SRJ inmate to deliver a baby or for other prenatal care. \n18  66.  The medical provider in the San Francisco County jail is not a for-profit correctional \n19  healthcare company such as WELLPATH/CFMG.  It is the County Department of Public Health, \n20  which has no financial incentive to deny care. \n21  67.  The medical provider in the Contra Costa County jail is not a for-profit correctional \n22  healthcare company such as WELLPATH/CFMG.  It is the County Department of Public Health, \n23  which has no financial incentive to deny care. \n24  68.  The price provisions of the WELLPATH/CFMG contract which create a financial \n25  incentive to deny care have had a devastating impact on the provision of medical services to \n26  inmates at SRJ, including pregnant inmates.  That impact is detailed below at Paragraphs 89 to 118. \n27  ACSOโs Contract with ARAMARK \n28 \n \nPage 17 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 18 of 40\n \n1  69.  ACSO contracts with ARAMARK to prepare food for inmates at SRJ and to prepare \n2  food which is used to feed inmates at other Alameda County jails including Glen Dyer Jail, as well \n3  as adult facilities in Colusa, Solano, San Benito, San Joaquin, Amador and Lake counties, and a \n4  juvenile facility in San Joaquin County.  ARAMARK prepares 20,000 meals a day, with the labor \n5  of 150 inmate workers who are not paid but receive food treats. \n6  70.  Through its contract with ARAMARK, ACSO instituted a 25% cut in the inmate food \n7  budget at SRJ.  \n8  71.  ARAMARK implemented the reduction in the inmate food budget at SRJ in the \n9  amount of $1.65 million. \n10  72.  The  cost  reductions  which  ACSO  instituted  in  the  ARAMARK  contract  and \n11  implemented by ARAMARK have had a devastating impact on the quantity and quality of food \n12  provided to inmates at SRJ.  That impact is detailed below at Paragraphs 71 to 88. \n13  Food Shortages and Dangerous Food Conditions at SRJ \n14  73.  The kitchen at SRJ is staffed by inmate workers under the supervision of Defendant \n15  ARAMARK.  By 2016, inmates were no longer even consistently tested for communicable diseases \n16  before being permitted to work in the kitchen. \n17  74.  Santa Ritaโs kitchen prepares food not just for prisoners in the jail, but also for other \n18  jails under the jurisdiction of ACSO.   \n19  75.  According to women inmate kitchen worker at SRJ, the kitchen at SRJ is filthy.1  \n20  Birds live in the kitchen and bird droppings fall all over counter surfaces, including food \n21  preparation surfaces.  Rats run across the kitchen floor and there are frequently rat droppings in the \n22  food.  When this is brought to the attention of a paid ARAMARK supervisor, paid supervisors \n23  brush the rat droppings off the food and instruct inmate kitchen workers to continue working. \n24  76.  Food in the kitchen is kept such that rats access it.  Bread is kept in plastic bags in \n25  open plastic crates.  Rats climb over the bread and chew open packages.  When bread bags are \n26  chewed by rats, a few pieces are thrown away but the rest of the bread is served to prisoners. \n27 \n28   \n \n \nPage 18 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 19 of 40\n \n1  77.  Sandwich meat, primarily bologna, often is spoiled, with raised white spots of \n2  unknown origin and type on it.  That spoiled meat is given to prisoners to eat.   \n3  78.  Cooked beans are not properly stored, and not labeled, so that old, leftover beans are \n4  frequently reheated and served, or combined with newer cooked beans.  As a result, the beans \n5  decompose, and frequently become slimy and start to bubble as part of its bacterial decomposition.  \n6  These decomposing spoilt beans are regularly served to prisoners. \n7  79.  Commercial kitchens normally have a daily clean-up crew which comes in and cleans \n8  all ovens, stoves, vent hoods, floors, and other surfaces and equipment in the kitchen.  Commercial \n9  clean-up crews normally come in the early morning, before a commercial kitchen opens.  Inmate \n10  kitchen workers have never seen a clean-up crew at the SRJ kitchen.  It is clear, simply by looking \n11  at the SRJ kitchen, that it is never cleaned. \n12  80.  The walk-in refrigerators in the SRJ kitchen are disorganized and filthy.  There is no \n13  cleaning schedule for the refrigerators, which are seldom if ever cleaned.  Water collects on the \n14  floor, indicating condensation due to frequent temperature variations above acceptable food safety \n15  levels.   \n16  81.  Ingredients are not marked or dated when they are received into the kitchen so there \n17  is no way to track use-by dates of the inventory.  As a result, kitchen workers are unable to tell \n18  which ingredients should be used first or to follow standard first-in, first-out inventory control to \n19  prevent spoilage.  As an inevitable result, ingredients frequently spoil.  Sandwich meats are \n20  frequently become green or purple.  Beans become slimy and bubble.  Meals prepared from these \n21  spoiled ingredients are given to inmates to eat. \n22  82.  Meals are the same day in and day out.  Even pregnant women do not receive \n23  sufficient amounts or types of food.  Day after day, week after week, month after month, prisoners \n24  are given: \n25  Breakfast: oatmeal or Cream of Wheat with bread and canned fruit; \n26  Lunch: Primarily Peanut butter sandwich or 1-2x a week, hard boiled eggs; once every two weeks \n27  or so some bologna, milk and 4 to 5 carrot nubs; a piece of fruit once or twice a week at most; \n28  Snack: (for pregnant women only) Peanut butter sandwich, milk; \n \nPage 19 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 20 of 40\n \n1  Dinner: Protein patty, potatoes, cooked carrots. \n2  83.  In November, 2020, when the women kitchen workers, as whistle blowers, publicly \n3  described the conditions in the kitchen, the vermin, the rodents, the birds, the inadequate sanitation, \n4  Margarita, an Aramark employee, stated that she did not like the women workers because the \n5  women workers โcomplainedโ about the lack of sanitation in the kitchen.  As a result, all of the \n6  women kitchen workers lost their jobs preparing food, and lost the ability to work the second shift \n7  from 3:30  p.m.to 11p.m.  Instead, all of the women were relegated to a short shift from 8 to 11, and \n8  made to do all the dirty work, all the kitchen cleaning, which the men did not do.  With the \n9  shortened hours and the workload of all the cleaning, the women are highly pressured to go through \n10  the motions of cleaning, as with the cleaning work load, and the small women kitchen worker crew, \n11  it is not possible to actually get all the cleaning done, much less done right.   \n12  84.  In addition, as a result, the women kitchen received fewer perks, including food.  The \n13  main motivation for the women kitchen workers was to be able to eat a slightly higher quality of \n14  food because the jail food was so deficient, unsanitary and insufficient.  Furthermore, because \n15  women prisoners were locked down excessively, working was one of the few means that women \n16  had to get out of their cells and be active.  The men kitchen workers received none of these \n17  limitations, and instead received the additional perks of being allowed out of cell, all day, every \n18  day. \n19  85.  Until 2019, on a daily basis, breakfast was served between 3:30 and 4:00 a.m.  \n20  Pregnant inmates, who need rest, are woken at 2:00 a.m. to have vital signs checked, are then forced \n21  to get up at 4:00 a.m. if they want to have breakfast.  Many cannot, because they need to rest.  If a \n22  pregnant woman skips breakfast, she must wait until 12:00 noon for lunch.  From dinner to lunch is \n23  19 hours, so a pregnant woman who cannot rise at 4:00 a.m. after having been woken at 2:00 a.m. \n24  for a blood pressure check must go 19 hours without food. \n25  86.  Pregnant women are not provided with adequate amounts or types of food as defined \n26  by community standards memorialized in California Regulations governing the feeding of \n27  California inmates.  Pregnant women fail to gain weight as is necessary for a healthy pregnancy. \n28 \n \nPage 20 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 21 of 40\n \n1  87.  Podworkers report that there are regularly vermin and vermin feces in the food and \n2  food trays.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON reported that while serving meals, she saw both rodent feces in \n3  one personโs food tray and another tray with limbs and a rodent fetus cooked into the beans and \n4  served.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON brought this to the attention of Deputies Farmanian and Pope, who \n5  were on duty.  One of Deputies Farmanian or Pope took a picture of the tray, treating it like it was a \n6  joke.  The tray was then served to an inmate with instructions to โeat around it.โ  Another time, \n7  when a prisoner showed one of the deputies evidence that a rodent had eaten part of her lunch, one \n8  of the deputies, Farmanian or Divine said, โMice gotta eat tooโ.  As a result of the chronic \n9  unsanitary food preparation conditions, the infestation of rodents, wild animals and vermin in the \n10  kitchen, pregnant women receive inedible food, or are shorted food, and frequently are hungry. \n11  88.  Food shortages led to frequent fights among the inmates for the little food that is \n12  available.  For example, on March 20, 2018, a pregnant pre-trial detainee was given one extra \n13  serving of milk.  Another inmate demanded that she turn over her extra milk.  A physical fight then \n14  ensued over that extra milk between the second inmate and a third inmate.  A second fight over \n15  milk also occurred during the same week. \n16  89.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON was pregnant when she was arrested in early March, 2018 and \n17  booked into SRJ.  WELLPATH/CFMG staff at SRJ confirmed her pregnancy upon her entry into \n18  SRJ.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON was not provided the extra food that is required for pregnant women.  \n19  Plaintiff JOHNSTON complained to the guards on Housing Unit 24 several times that she has not \n20  been given the required extra food and requested that she be given the food.  Despite her requests, \n21  SRJ staff did not provide Plaintiff JOHNSTON with the extra food required to be given to pregnant \n22  inmates.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON frequently fell asleep hungry.  \n23  90.  On March 10, 2018, despite the presence of extra trays at dinner, Defendant Deputy \n24  CAIN did not allow Plaintiff JOHNSTON to have any extra food.  On March 11, 2018, while lined \n25  up for breakfast, Plaintiff JOHNSTON fainted from hunger.   \n26  91.  On March 21, 2018, Plaintiff JOHNSTON asked for an extra tray of food because she \n27  was still hungry and there were extra trays visible. The deputy on duty denied her request and \n28 \n \nPage 21 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 22 of 40\n \n1  withheld the food as punishment citing as a reason that โyou guys are being too loud.โ  Plaintiff \n2  JOHNSTON is a pre-trial detainee. \n3  92.  On March 27, 2018, Plaintiff JACKSON, an inmate approximately 27 weeks \n4  pregnant at the time, was given food on a cardboard tray that was soggy and foul smelling because \n5  it was splattered underneath with food debris.  Plaintiff JACKSON asked the Deputy on duty, \n6  โwould you eat this if the tray is soggy and smells bad?โ  The Deputy said she would get Plaintiff \n7  JACKSON another tray, but did not.  On April 11, 2018 Plaintiff JACKSON was given spoiled \n8  milk to drink. \n9  93.  Plaintiff JACKSON was pregnant with twins during her incarceration and due to the \n10  insufficient jail food, had difficulty with the required weight gain for healthy fetuses.   \n11  Medical Care Is Grossly Inadequate At Santa Rita Jail \n12  94.  As a result of the cost provisions of ACSOโs contract with WELLPATH/CFMG, \n13  medical care provided to SRJ inmates at SRJ is grossly inadequate.   In addition, SRJ inmates are \n14  regularly denied necessary and appropriate outside medical care by WELLPATH/CFMG because \n15  the provision of such care comes directly out of SFMGโs bottom  line profits. The following \n16  example of grossly inadequate and entirely withheld medical care are given by way of illustration \n17  only and not by way of limitation.  \n18  General Medical Care \n19  95.  Savanah OโNeill is a Certified Addiction Treatment Counselor and Associate Clinical \n20  Social Worker who served as the Opioid Treatment Program Coordinator at SRJ from February, \n21  2017 through December 6, 2017 as an employee of WELLPATH/CFMG.  She resigned her position \n22  with WELLPATH/CFMG due to the โunethical medical treatment of pregnant inmates that falls \n23  below the accepted standard of careโ at SRJ. \n24  96.  Standard treatment protocols mandate that pregnant women prisoners with opioid \n25  dependence of any type are to be initiated into methadone treatment or maintained in their current \n26  treatment during their incarceration.   \n27  97.  Despite this, beginning in or about October, 2017, WELLPATH/CFMG implemented \n28  its own, non-standard, practice.  Under its non-standard practice, WELLPATH/CFMG puts all \n \nPage 22 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 23 of 40\n \n1  opioid  dependent inmates into detox, regardless of the prisonerโs physical condition or opioid use \n2  history.  Although WELLPATH/CFMG maintains written protocols which call for it to initiate \n3  treatment for pregnant women using opioids, Ms. OโNeill witnessed at least two pregnant women \n4  who were placed into a fast and severe detox regimen.  One of these pregnant inmates was given \n5  one 5 mg dose of methadone and told she would receive no further medication; the other was given \n6  10 mg.  Federal regulations, specifically 42 CFR Part 8 call for an initial dose of 40 mg on the first \n7  day of treatment, after which the dosage is increased every other day until cravings cease.   \n8  98.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have issued an opinion \n9  that pregnant women should be maintained on methadone during their pregnancy and not placed in \n10  withdrawal.  WELLPATH/CFMG and SRJโs treatment of pregnant prisoners with opioid \n11  dependence is contrary to the standards issued by the American College of Obstetricians and \n12  Gynecologists. \n13  99.  WELLPATH/CFMG and SRJโs practice is also contrary to the practice at the San \n14  Francisco County Jail and the Contra Costa County Jail, both of which comply with the accepted \n15  standard practice that all pregnant prisoners with opioid dependence be maintained on methadone \n16  during the term of their incarceration.  WELLPATH/CFMG and SRJ do not comply. \n17  Pregnancy-Related Medical Care \n18  100.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON entered SRJ while pregnant. Prior to her incarceration at SRJ, \n19  Plaintiff JOHNSTON was provided with a pregnancy treatment plan by the Native American \n20  Health Clinic.  The plan called for a standard test, called a nuchal translucency scan or NT scan, at \n21  10-12 weeks pregnancy to gauge various developmental indicators, including development of the \n22  spinal cord, as well as other developmental milestones.  Plaintiff JOHNSTON has several times \n23  requested this test at SRJ.  WELLPATH/CFMG staff initially told her only that โwe will talk about \n24  it more.โ  On March 17, 2018 WELLPATH/CFMG staff at SRJ denied her requests for the standard \n25  NT developmental scan.   \n26  101.  Plaintiff  JOHNSTON  has  been  diagnosed  with  gestational  diabetes.    She  was \n27  scheduled to be taken to Highland Hospital on Friday, March 16, 2018 for testing.  The test was \n28  administered instead by WELLPATH/CFMG at SRJ.  WELLPATH/CFMG staff administered the \n \nPage 23 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 24 of 40\n \n1  test incorrectly.  Blood sugar readings are supposed to be taken twice, once before being given a \n2  drink and again afterwards. The test was administered only after the drink was given.   \n3  102.  Plaintiff IBE gave birth while she was a pre-trial detainee at SRJ.  At about the 37th \n4  week of pregnancy, she was  moved  to  O.P.H.U. (Out-Patient Housing Unit), where  she was \n5  frequently not given the diet mandated for pregnant women.  Despite her requests, SRJ did not \n6  provide her with proper meals on these occasions.  \n7  103.  While  Plaintiff  IBE  was  being  transported  to  Highland  Hospital,  a  male  deputy \n8  attempted to restrain her in the ambulance with a waist chain while she was in active labor.  \n9  Plaintiff IBE gave birth on November 9, 2017.  After the birth, Deputy Thomas said they needed to \n10  chain her to the bed, despite the facts that she had a high fever and complications, including a rip in \n11  her vagina that needed to be stitched up.  Plaintiff IBE was not permitted to hold or even touch her \n12  baby. \n13  104.  On November 10, 2017, two deputies grabbed Plaintiff IBEโs legs and chained her to \n14  the bed with leg irons.  Although the tear in her vagina had just been stitched, they chained her to \n15  the bed in a spread-eagle position, leaving her uncomfortable and in pain with two male guards in \n16  her room. \n17  105.  Also, on November 10, 2017, a Highland Hospital pediatrician told Plaintiff IBE that \n18  the โCounty Sherriff made a ruleโ that โyou cannot bond, hold, touch or see your baby.โ  Plaintiff \n19  IBE was not allowed any contact with her baby. \n20  106.  Plaintiff ELLIS was approximately 20 weeks pregnant at SRJ when she began \n21  bleeding and spotting.  WELLPATH/CFMG placed her into the Infirmary, which consists of \n22  several small rooms, essentially cages, where she was totally alone.  She received no care other than \n23  periodic blood pressure readings.   \n24  107.  Until Plaintiff ELLIS was past four months pregnant, WELLPATH/CFMG staff \n25  continually gave her pamphlets about abortion and told her that โabortion is available,โ despite her \n26  repeated statements that she wanted to carry the child to term.  Similarly, Plaintiff ELLIS heard \n27  WELLPATH/CFMG staff repeatedly say that Plaintiff MOHRBACHER โneeds to have an \n28 \n \nPage 24 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 25 of 40\n \n1  abortion.โ  SRJ guards have physically shaken and assaulted Plaintiff ELLIS, presumably in an \n2  attempt to induce a miscarriage.  \n3  108.  Plaintiff MOHRBACHER was pregnant when she entered SRJ.  Plaintiff \n4  MOHRBACHER has never been told of any of any โcare planโ developed by WELLPATH/CFMG \n5  for her pregnancy.  Like all pregnant inmates at SRJ, Plaintiff MOHRBACHER was not allowed \n6  the three hours of outdoor recreation per week mandated for pregnant inmates.  Other than for a \n7  single week when all female inmates were allowed regular outdoor time, Plaintiff MOHRBACHER \n8  was permitted only two pregnancy weeks walks while incarcerated at SRJ.  \n9  109.  Plaintiff MOHRBACHER was seen by WELLPATH/CFMG staff in connection with \n10  her pregnancy.  The WELLPATH/CFMG staff had from the beginning of her pregnancy urged her \n11  to have abortion.  Plaintiff MOHRBACHER informed CGMG that she did not want an abortion and \n12  that she wanted to have the baby, the WELLPATH/CFMG staff.  Following this, \n13  WELLPATH/CFMG staff told Plaintiff MOHRBACHER that her baby was dead and that she \n14  should have an abortion.  Plaintiff MOHRBACHER knew that the baby was not dead and refused \n15  consent to an abortion.  WELLPATH/CFMG nonetheless scheduled Plaintiff MOHRBACHER for \n16  an abortion.  When Plaintiff MOHRBACHER refused to go, WELLPATH/CFMG had two male \n17  Deputies go to her Housing Unit and try to forcibly take her to have an abortion.  She resisted and \n18  refused, and when she again refused to agree to an abortion, the Deputies yelled at her and claimed \n19  she was on drugs.  Defendants Farmanian and Pope have told Plaintiff MOHRBACHER that she \n20  โneeded to getโ an abortion.  Defendant Pope told her that she must โobviously be on drugs, which \n21  is why you refuseโ to abort the baby. \n22  110.  Finally, one day in December, 2017, Deputies entered the Housing Unit at 6:00 a.m. \n23  and demanded that all inmates stand so that the Deputies could conduct a search.  Plaintiff \n24  MOHRBACHER was placed into solitary confinement, handcuffed, for an extremely long period of \n25  time.  After a significant amount of time, defendant DIVINE returned, moved Plaintiff \n26  MOHRBACHER to another room and conducted yet another strip search.  Plaintiff \n27  MOHRBACHER was bleeding vaginally due to the stress and harassment.  Although Plaintiff \n28  MOHRBACHER was not once found to be in possession of drugs at SRJ, Deputy DIVINE stated \n \nPage 25 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 26 of 40\n \n1  that she was bleeding because she was โdoing meth.โ  During or shortly following this search, \n2  which was the third in less than a week, Plaintiff MOHRBACHERโs continued bleeding and \n3  suffered a miscarriage.  WELLPATH/CFMG never provided medical attention to Plaintiff \n4  MOHRBACHER in connection with her miscarriage. \n5  111.  Plaintiff ZEPEDA was arrested and booked into SRJ on Sunday, August 13, 2017, at \n6  which time she was pregnant.  On that day, WELLPATH/CFMG staff at SRJ administered a \n7  pregnancy test and confirmed the pregnancy.  Plaintiff ZEPEDA informed WELLPATH/CFMG \n8  staff that she was not feeling well.  Nonetheless, she was placed in a filthy holding cell with walls \n9  covered in human secretions, decaying food on the floor, and human waste in the cell and in the \n10  toilet.  Because the toilet had human waste floating in it and no toilet paper, she could not use it and \n11  ended up urinating on her clothes. \n12  112.  On the same day, although she continued to not feel well, Plaintiff ZEPEDA received \n13  no medical care.  Eventually, WELLPATH/CFMG personnel spoke with her, but instead of trying \n14  to provide medical care, the WELLPATH/CFMG staff only told Plaintiff ZEPEDA that she could \n15  have an abortion anytime.  The guards also encouraged her to have an abortion.  When Plaintiff \n16  ZEPEDA requested medical attention, such care was refused and she was instead treated as a pest.  \n17  Plaintiff ZEPEDA felt that the guards were trying to coerce her into aborting her fetus or, failing \n18  that, into suffering a miscarriage.   \n19  113.  By Thursday, August 17, 2017, four days after entering SRJ, Plaintiff ZEPEDA was \n20  bleeding very badly and did suffer a miscarriage.  Grieving and distraught, she received no \n21  counseling or support of any kind. \n22  114.  Other inmates, including Paramdeep Kaur, have also suffered miscarriages due to the \n23  filthy conditions, abuse by staff, and inadequate and dangerous food at SRJ, and due to the policy, \n24  custom and practice of ACSO and WELLPATH/CFMG to deny needed and appropriate medical \n25  care to pregnant women at SRJ. \n26  115.  Adanna Ibe was pregnant and delivered her son at Highland Hospital.  During the \n27  delivery, she experienced a vagina tear which required stitches.  After the birth, but before she \n28  received stitches, male sheriffโs deputies, insisted that she had to be chained by the leg, to her \n \nPage 26 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 27 of 40\n \n1  hospital bed, even before she received any medical treatment.  This caused her severe pain and \n2  discomfort. \n3  116.  After she received stitches, the deputies insisted that she had to be chained, spread \n4  eagle to the hospital bed, and forcibly chained Andanna.  She was allowed to see her baby, but not \n5  allowed to hold him.  She was told that the Sheriff and the County had policies forbidding her from \n6  holding or even touching her baby.  This caused her great emotional distress and she became \n7  exceedingly distressed and distraught. \n8  Applicable Community Standards \n9  117.  SRJโs treatment of women prisoners falls far short of acceptable conditions under the \n10  United States Constitution. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that \n11  correctional facilities โmust ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and \n12  medical care.โ  Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807, 812 (9th Cir. 2009) quoting Farmer v. Brennan, \n13  511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) \n14  118.  California Regulations provide a ready benchmark for what constitutes โadequate \n15  food, clothing, . . . and medical care.โ \n16  119.  California Code of Regulations (hereinafter โCCRโ) ยง 1210(b) specifies that โ[f]or \n17  each inmate treated for health conditions for which additional treatment, special accommodations \n18  and/or a schedule of follow-up care is/are needed during the period of incarceration, responsible \n19  health care staff shall develop a written treatment plan.โ \n20  120.  CCR ยง 1248 specifies that, โThe medical diets utilized by a facility shall be planned, \n21  prepared and served with consultation from a registered dietitian. The facility manager shall comply \n22  with any medical diet prescribed for an inmate. \n23  121.   CCR ยง 1248 further specifies that, โ[t]he facility manager and responsible physician \n24  shall ensure that the medical diet manual, which includes sample menus of medical diets, shall be \n25  available in both the medical unit and the food service office for reference and information. A \n26  registered dietitian shall review, and the responsible physician shall approve, the diet manual on an \n27  annual basis. \n28 \n \nPage 27 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.

CCR ยง 1248 further specifies that, โ[p]regnant women shall be provided a balanced, \n2  nutritious diet approved by a doctor.โ \n3  123.  CCR ยง 1240 specifies that, โ[p]rovisions shall be made for inmates who may miss a \n4  regularly scheduled facility meal. They shall be provided with a substitute meal and beverage, and \n5  inmates on medical diets shall be provided with their prescribed meal.โ \n6  124.  CCR ยง 1242 specifies that โMenus shall be planned to provide a variety of foods, thus \n7  preventing repetitive meals.โ \n8  125.  CCR ยง 1241 specifies that โA wide variety of food should be served.โ \n9  126.  CCR ยง 1241(b) specifies that โFor . . . pregnant and lactating women, the requirement \n10  is four servings of milk or milk productsโ of 8 ounces of liquid milk per day.  \n11  127.  CCR ยง 1241(c) specifies that โThe daily requirement of fruits and vegetables shall be \n12  five servings. At least one serving shall be from each of the following three categories: \n13  128.   CCR ยง 1241(c)(1) specifies that โOne serving of a fresh fruit or vegetable per day, or \n14  seven (7) servings per week.โ \n15  129.  CCR ยง 1241(c)(2) specifies that โOne serving of a Vitamin C source containing 30 \n16  mg. or more per day or seven (7) servings per week.โ \n17  130.   CCR ยง 1241(c)(3) specifies that โOne serving of a Vitamin A source, fruit or \n18  vegetable, containing 200 micrograms Retional Equivalents (RE) or more per day, or seven \n19  servings per week.โ \n20  131.  CCR ยง 1241 further specifies that โProviding only the minimum servings outlined in \n21  this regulation is not sufficient to meet the inmatesโ caloric requirements. Additional servings from \n22  the dairy, vegetable-fruit, and bread-cereal groups must be provided in amounts to meet caloric \n23  requirements.โ \n24  132.  Further, CCR ยง 3050(a)(3) specifies that: โPregnant inmates shall receive two extra \n25  eight ounce cartons of milk or a calcium supplement if lactose intolerant, two extra servings of \n26  fresh fruit, and two extra servings of fresh vegetables daily.โ \n27 \n28 \n \nPage 28 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 29 of 40\n \n1  133.  CCR ยง 1230 specifies that, โ[t]he responsible physician, in cooperation with the food \n2  services manager and the facility administrator, shall develop written procedures for medical \n3  screening of inmate food service workers prior to working in the facility kitchenโ \n4  134.  In addition, CCR ยง 1243 specifies that, โFacilities shall have a written food service \n5  plan that shall comply with the applicable California Retail Food Code.โ \n6  135.  Among other things, the California  Retail Food Code ยง 113980 requires that โAll \n7  food shall be manufactured, produced, prepared . . . stored . . . and served so as to be pure and free \n8  from . . . spoilage; . . . shall be protected from dirt, vermin, . . . droplet contamination, overhead \n9  leakage, or other environmental sources of contamination; shall otherwise be fully fit for human \n10  consumption.โ \n11  136.  As alleged above in Paragraphs 89-118, ACSO and ARAMARK comply with none of \n12  the standards cited above which clearly define what constitutes the provision of adequate foods to \n13  inmates. \n14  137.  CCR ยง 1260 specifies that, โThe standard issue of climatically suitable clothing to \n15  inmates held after arraignment . . . shall include (c) clean undergarments . . . (2) for females - bra \n16  and two pairs of panties.โ  Further, CCR ยง 1262 specifies that, โUndergarments and socks shall be \n17  exchanged twice each week.โ   \n18  138.  CCR ยง 1248 also provides that โThe inmatesโ personal undergarments and footwear \n19  may be substituted for the institutional undergarments and footwear specified in this regulation. \n20  This option notwithstanding, the facility has the primary responsibility to provide the personal \n21  undergarments and footwear.โ \n22  139.  CCR ยง 1263 specifies that โWritten policy and procedures shall specify handling of \n23  laundry that is known or suspected to be contaminated with infectious material.โ \n24  140.  As alleged above in Paragraphs 71-88, ACSO complies with none of the standards \n25  cited above which clearly define what constitutes the provision of adequate foods to inmates. \n26  141.  CCR ยง 1265 specifies that โEach female inmate shall be issued sanitary napkins \n27  and/or tampons as requested.โ  Further, California Penal Code ยง 3409(a) specifies that โAny \n28  incarcerated person in state prison who menstruates shall, upon request, have access to, and be \n \nPage 29 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 30 of 40\n \n1  allowed to use, materials necessary for personal hygiene with regard to their menstrual cycle and \n2  reproductive system...at no costโฆ.โ \n3  142.  As alleged above in Paragraphs 33-51, ACSO complies with none of the standards \n4  cited above which clearly define what constitutes the provision of materials necessary for personal \n5  hygiene with regard to inmatesโ menstrual cycle and reproductive systems, upon request.  Instead at \n6  Santa Rita Jail, women prisoners are only permitted to request โ no more than once a day โ for four \n7  (4) menstrual pads, a wholly inadequate supply to meet the needs of female inmatesโ menstrual \n8  cycle. \n9  143.  Under CCR ยง 3355.2(b), all inmates with a confirmed pregnancy are entitled by \n10  California law to a treatment and care plan regimen. \n11  144.  As alleged above in Paragraphs 89-118, ACSO and WELLPATH/CFMG do not \n12  comply with standards clearly defined in CCR ยง 3355.2(b).  To the contrary, it is the policy, custom \n13  and practice of ACSO, carried out in concert with WELLPATH/CFMG, to deny inmates with a \n14  confirmed pregnancy with access to such a treatment and care plan.  For example, and not by way \n15  of limitation, no plan of care is determined by an Obstetrical Physician or Obstetrical Nurse \n16  Practitioner, diagnostic studies are not ordered as needed, and obstetrics examinations are not \n17  scheduled in accordance with the schedule mandated by CCR ยง 3355.2(c).   \n18  145.  CCR ยง 3355.2(e) requires that pregnant women who are โreceiving methadone \n19  treatment, shall be enrolled in the Methadone Maintenance Program and recommended for \n20  immediate transfer to the California Institution for Women.โ \n21  146.  As alleged above in Paragraphs 94-97, ACSO and WELLPATH/CFMG do not \n22  comply with standards clearly defined in CCR ยง 3355.2(e).  To the contrary, it is the policy, custom \n23  and practice of ACSO, carried out in concert with WELLPATH/CFMG, to refuse to enroll such \n24  pregnant women in the Methadone Maintenance Program or to recommend them for immediate \n25  transfer to the California Institution for Women. \n26  147.  Women who have opiate addiction issues are denied medical care and thrust into the \n27  general population housing unit.  These women are forced to withdraw cold turkey, and this \n28  withdrawal frequently involves vomiting or loss of bowel or bladder control.  The housing units \n \nPage 30 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 31 of 40\n \n1  consist of 9 sets of bunk beds.  Pregnant women and women with disabilities are issued the bottom \n2  bunk.  Frequently these women withdrawing from opiates are placed on the top bunk, forcing \n3  pregnant women to be on the receiving end of vomit or other human secretions, and the terrible \n4  smell.  Given the short supply of clean linens, and cleaning supplies and equipment, pregnant \n5  women are forced to endure these conditions for hours at a time. \n6   \n7 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n8 \n9  DEPRIVATION OF FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS \n10  UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AGAINST ACSO \n11 \n148. Plaintiffs  repeat  and  re-allege  each  and  every  allegation  contained  in  the  above \n12 \nparagraphs with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n13 \n149. At all relevant times herein, ACSO has been responsible for operating the Santa Rita \n14 \nJail. \n15 \n150. At  all  relevant  times  herein,  Defendant  ACSO  has  established  and/or  followed \n16 \npolicies, procedures, customs, and or practices, and those policies were the cause of violation of the \n17 \nPlaintiffsโ and the class membersโ constitutional rights granted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \n18 \nincluding those under the First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n19 \n151.  At all relevant times herein, ACSO has followed a custom, policy and practice of \n20 \nimposing greater restrictions and other hardships on women prisoners at SRJ than on male \n21 \nprisoners, with no valid penological purpose.  By way of example only, these greater restrictions \n22 \nand hardships include, but are not limited to, denial of the right to eat together in the common area \n23 \nof the pod, and when the women exercised their first amendment rights to request their full fifteen \n24 \nminutes to eat the meat, Defendant ACSO retaliated by refusing to allow the women out into the \n25 \ncommon area at all, and forcing all of them to eat their meals in their cells; denial of appropriate \n26 \nclothing; denial of access to laundry and undergarments that meet minimum community standards; \n27 \ndenial of materials necessary for personal hygiene with regard to their menstrual cycle and \n28 \n \nPage 31 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.

The policies, practices and customs described above are the official policies, practices \n7  and customs of Defendant COUNTY OF ALAMEDA and ACSO, and are the direct and proximate \n8  cause of the harm and discrimination described herein in violation of the First Amendment, the \n9  Eighth Amendmentโs bar against cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendmentโs \n10  equal protection and bar against punishment. \n11  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they represent request relief as outlined \n12  below. \n13  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n14  DEPRIVATION OF FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AGAINST ACSO \n15  AND WELL-PATH/ CFMG \n16 \n153. Plaintiffs  repeat  and  re-allege  each  and  every  allegation  contained  in  the  above \n17 \nparagraphs with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n18 \n154.  At all relevant times herein, Defendant WELL-PATH/CFMG acted under color of \n19 \nState law.  \n20 \n155. At  all  relevant  times  herein,  Defendant  WELLPATH/CFMG  established  and/or \n21 \nfollowed policies, procedures, customs, and or practices, and those policies were the cause of \n22 \nviolation of the Plaintiffsโ and the class membersโ constitutional rights granted pursuant to 42 \n23 \nU.S.C.  ยง  1983,  including  those  under  the  Eighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments.    All  of  the \n24 \naforementioned acts of the Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG, their agents, servants and employees, \n25 \nwere carried out jointly with ACSO under the color of state law. \n26 \n156. At all relevant times herein, Defendant ALAMDEA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE \n27 \ndelegated to Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG the traditional public function of determining and \n28 \n \nPage 32 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 33 of 40\n \n1  controlling the provision of medical services to pregnant inmates, in such a way as was deliberately \n2  calculated to deny such inmates access to adequate medical care.  The denial of necessary and \n3  appropriate medical services was imposed in order to reduce WELLPATH/CFMGโs costs under its \n4  contract with ASCO, specifically pursuant to the pricing provisions of that contract which penalized \n5  WELLPATH/CFMG for allowing the provision of any outside medical care, regardless of the \n6  medical necessity of such care.  \n7  157. At  all  relevant  times  herein,  Defendant  WELLPATH/CFMG  acted  jointly  and \n8  intentionally with Defendant ACSO, pursuant to a customary plan to restrict Plaintiffs and class \n9  members from obtaining medically necessary and appropriate medical care.  \n10  158. At  all  relevant  times  herein,  Defendant  WELLPATH/CFMG  intentionally \n11  participated with the Defendant ACSO in a customary plan to restrict Plaintiffs and class members \n12  from obtaining medically necessary and appropriate medical care.  \n13  159.  At all relevant times herein, an inmate's right to necessary and appropriate medical \n14  services was clearly established.  The contours of the right to necessary and appropriate medical \n15  services was made sufficiently clear by, among other things, the California Regulations cited \n16  herein. \n17  160.  At all relevant times herein, Defendants WELLPATH/CFMG and ACSO acted with \n18  deliberate indifference to the violation of Plaintiff's class members' rights.  As shown above, \n19  WELLPATH/CFMG and ACSO were aware of the substantial risk of serious harm to a pregnant \n20  inmate's health and safety created by the denial of necessary and appropriate medical services and \n21  appropriate nutrition and WELLPATH/CFMG and ACSO deliberately disregarded that risk.  At all \n22  relevant times, the California Regulations cited herein put WELLPATH/CFMG and ACSO on \n23  actual notice that such substantial risk of serious harm is not one that today's society chooses to \n24  tolerate. \n25  161. At  all  relevant  times  herein,  there  existed  a  pervasive  entwinement  between \n26  Defendant  WELLPATH/CFMG and Defendant ACSO, in that WELLPATH/CFMG was at all \n27  relevant times delegated by ACSO the traditional public function of determining and providing \n28  medical care to inmates.  \n \nPage 33 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.

The deprivation of Plaintiffsโ and class membersโ constitutional rights was caused by \n2  the close nexus between Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG and Defendant ACSO that was created by \n3  the direct role of Defendant ACSO in enforcing WELLPATH/CFMGโs determination to deny and \n4  withhold necessary and appropriate medical care to SRJ inmates. \n5  163. The close nexus between Defendants WELLPATH/CFMG and ACSO is the legal \n6  cause of injuries to Plaintiffs and the class as alleged herein and, as a result, Plaintiffs and the class \n7  have  sustained  general  and  special  damages,  as  well  as  incurring  attorneysโ  fees,  costs,  and \n8  expenses, including those as authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, to an extent and in an amount subject \n9  to proof at trial. \n10  Wherefore, plaintiffs and the prisoner class they represent request relief as outlined below. \n11   \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12 \nDEPRIVATION OF FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AGAINST  \n13 \n14  ACSO AND ARAMARK CORRECTIONAL SERVICES LLC \n15 \n164. Plaintiffs  repeat  and  re-allege  each  and  every  allegation  contained  in  the  above \n16 \nparagraphs with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n17 \n165.  At all relevant times herein, Defendant ARAMARK CORRECTIONAL SERVICES \n18 \nLLC acted under color of State law.  \n19 \n166. At all relevant times herein, Defendant  ARAMARK  established  and/or followed \n20 \npolicies, procedures, customs, and or practices, and those policies were the cause of violation of the \n21 \nPlaintiffsโ and the class membersโ constitutional rights granted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \n22 \nincluding those under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  All of the aforementioned acts of \n23 \nthe Defendant ARAMARK, their agents, servants and employees, were carried out under the color \n24 \nof state law. \n25 \n167. At all relevant times herein, Defendant ALAMDEA COUNTY SHERIFFโS OFFICE \n26 \ndelegated to Defendant ARAMARK the traditional public function of feeding municipal inmates \n27 \nand allowed and enabled Defendant ARAMARK to cause constitutionally inadequate food to be \n28 \nprovided to SRJ inmates and to deny SRJ food that is adequate to sustain health.  The denial of food \n \nPage 34 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 35 of 40\n \n1  that is adequate to sustain health was imposed in order to reduce ARAMARKโs costs under its \n2  contract with ASCO.  \n3  168. At all relevant times herein, Defendant ARAMARK acted jointly and intentionally \n4  with Defendant ACSO, pursuant to a customary plan to prevent Plaintiffs and class members from \n5  having access to food that is adequate to maintain health.  \n6  169. At all relevant times herein, Defendant ARAMARK intentionally participated with \n7  the Defendant ACSO in a customary plan to retaliate against women kitchen workers who, as \n8  whistle-blowers, publicly reported on the unsanitary kitchen, and the food handling practices that \n9  violate Californiaโs health and safety codes,  \n10  170.  At all relevant times herein, an inmate's right to food that is adequate to maintain \n11  health was clearly established.  The contours of the right to food that is adequate to maintain health \n12  was made sufficiently clear by, among other things, the California Regulations cited herein. \n13  171.  At all relevant times herein, Defendants ARAMARK and ACSO acted with deliberate \n14  indifference to the violation of Plaintiff's class members' rights.  As shown above, ARAMARK and \n15  ACSO were aware of the substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate's health created by the denial \n16  of food that is adequate to maintain health and ARAMARK and ACSO deliberately disregarded \n17  that risk.  At all relevant times, the California Regulations cited herein put ARAMARK and ACSO \n18  on actual notice that such substantial risk of serious harm is not one that today's society chooses to \n19  tolerate. \n20  172. At  all  relevant  times  herein,  there  existed  a  pervasive  entwinement  between \n21  Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG and Defendant ACSO, in that ARAMARK was at all relevant \n22  times delegated by ACSO the traditional State function of feeding inmates.  \n23  173. The deprivation of Plaintiffsโ and class membersโ constitutional rights was caused by \n24  the close nexus between Defendant WELLPATH/CFMG and Defendant ACSO that was created by \n25  the direct role of Defendant ACSO in enforcing ARAMARKโs determination to prevent Plaintiffs \n26  and class members from having access to food that is adequate to sustain health. \n27  174. The close nexus between Defendants ARAMARK and ACSO is the legal cause of \n28  injuries to Plaintiffs and the class as alleged herein and, as a result, Plaintiffs and the class have \n \nPage 35 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.

Plaintiffs  repeat  and  re-allege  each  and  every  allegation  contained  in  the  above \n9  paragraphs with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n10  176.   By their policies and practices described above, Defendants subjected Plaintiffs and \n11  the Class they represent, to a substantial risk of harm and injury from inability to meet womenโs \n12  menstrual and feminine hygiene needs, inadequate medical care and insufficient nourishment to \n13  maintain life for pregnant women, and abuse treatment and hardships.  These policies and practices \n14  have been, and continue to be, implemented by Defendants and their agents or employees in their \n15  official capacities, and are the proximate cause of Plaintiffsโ and the Classโs ongoing deprivation of \n16  rights secured by the California Constitution, Article I, Section 17.  \n17  177.  Defendants have been and are aware of all of the deprivations complained of herein, \n18  and have condoned or been deliberately indifferent to such conduct. \n19  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they represent request relief as \n20  outlined below. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21 \nDEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS \n22 \n23  UNDER ARTICLE I, SECTION 7 OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AGAINST \nDEFENDANTS ALAMEDA COUNTY AND ACSO \n24 \n25  178. Plaintiffs  repeat  and  re-allege  each  and  every  allegation  contained  in  the  above \n26  paragraphs with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n27  179. By  their  policies  and  practices  described  above,  Defendants  inflicted  direct  and \n28  indirect discrimination against women prisoners solely on the basis of these prisoners are women.  \n \nPage 36 of 40 \nMohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriffโs Office 3:18-cv-00050,  Fourth Amended Complaint \n  \n \n\nCase 3:18-cv-00050-JD   Document 193   Filed 04/28/21   Page 37 of 40\n \n1  By their policies and practices described above, Defendants subject Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class \n2  they represent, to substantial violations of their right to equal protection in relationship to access to \n3  laundry, means to maintain personal and feminine hygiene; out of cell time; access to exercise; \n4  outdoor exercise; work; and classes and programs.  These policies and practices have been, and \n5  continue  to  be,  implemented  by  Defendants  and  their  agents  or  employees  in  their  official \n6  capacities, and are the proximate cause of Plaintiffsโ and the Prisoner Classโ ongoing deprivation of \n7  rights secured by the California Constitution Article 1, Section 7. \n8  180. Defendants have been and are aware of all the deprivations complained of herein, and \n9  have condoned or been deliberately indifferent to such conduct. \n10  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the Prisoner Class they represent request relief as outlined \n11  below. \n12  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court to: \n14 \n1. Certify the Class of women prisoners at Santa Rita under Rule 23, F.R.

In the alternative, \n17 \nhold certification of the broad class in abeyance pending further development of the grounds \n18 \nfor it, but recognize the Subclass for all purposes connected with its plea(s) for equitable \n19 \nrelief herein. \n20 \n2. Make findings of fact reflecting the general and specific failings and inadequacies of both \n21 \ngroups of defendantsโ approaches to and practice in the care of pregnant prisoners, the \n22 \npattern and practice of defendantsโ non-feasance and maltreatment of pregnant prisoners, and \n23 \ndefendantsโ violations of statutory, regulatory and constitutional requirements in dealing with \n24 \npregnant prisoners. \n25 \n26  3. Initiate a serious effort, perhaps with a Rule to Show Cause, to bring about defendantsโ \n27  early compliance with the community treatment program law Penal Code ยง1170., and/or any \n28 \n \nPage 37 of 40 \nMohrbacher v.
