          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Virginia M. Kendall. Motion hearing held on 4/8/2020 regarding Plaintiff's Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction 3 (Dkt. 154 in 20 C 1792). Plaintiff has completed his sentence and remains detained because of the \"One Person Per Address\" provision in 730 ILCS 5/3-3- 7(a)(7.6). This Court has already held that detaining sex offenders long after their period of incarceration has been completed is unconstitutional. See Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3rd 781 (N.D. Ill. 2019). Here, Plaintiff has found a place to live that will be supportive of his transfer back into the community. The building is operated by Jordan's Dreams, a nonprofit organization aiding individuals in assimilating back into the community. Another sex offender resides in the building already and therefore Defendants will not permit him to reside there. Plaintiff is clearly suffering a constitutional harm each day he is detained past his release date (which is now nearly a year and a half) and that harm can only be remedied by release. In response to the question about what penological or rehabilitative support the Defendants have for the \"one Person One Address\" provision, Defendants were unable to give any. The public's interest in only have one sex offender live at one residence is not supported by any testimony, expert opinion, or evidence. Therefore, the Court finds that the statute is unconstitutional as it applies to Plaintiff and Defendants are enjoined from prohibiting his release to the address presented by Plaintiff. To the extent that the COVID-19 situation in the facility plays a factor, it is only minor at this stage because of the speculative nature of the claim that he could be harmed. Yet certainly, being held in a facility where he may be exposed to the virus is not taken lightly, his real harm at this stage is his continued incarceration beyond his release date when he has a suitable location to live.Mailed notice (lk, ) (Entered: 04/08/2020)"

Motion hearing held on 4/8/2020 regarding Plaintiff's Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction 3 (Dkt. 154 in 20 C 1792). Plaintiff has completed his sentence and remains detained because of the \"One Person Per Address\" provision in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). This Court has already held that detaining sex offenders long after their period of incarceration has been completed is unconstitutional. See Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3rd 781 (N.D. Ill. 2019). Here, Plaintiff has found a place to live that will be supportive of his transfer back into the community. The building is operated by Jordan's Dreams, a nonprofit organization aiding individuals in assimilating back into the community. Another sex offender resides in the building already and therefore Defendants will not permit him to reside there. Plaintiff is clearly suffering a constitutional harm each day he is detained past his release date (which is now nearly a year and a half) and that harm can only be remedied by release. In response to the question about what penological or rehabilitative support the Defendants have for the \"one Person One Address\" provision, Defendants were unable to give any. The public's interest in only have one sex offender live at one residence is not supported by any testimony, expert opinion, or evidence. Therefore, the Court finds that the statute is unconstitutional as it applies to Plaintiff and Defendants are enjoined from prohibiting his release to the address presented by Plaintiff. To the extent that the COVID-19 situation in the facility plays a factor, it is only minor at this stage because of the speculative nature of the claim that he could be harmed. Yet certainly, being held in a facility where he may be exposed to the virus is not taken lightly, his real harm at this stage is his continued incarceration beyond his release date when he has a suitable location to live.Mailed notice (lk, ) (Entered: 04/08/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>This case involved a challenge to the continued imprisonment of individuals who completed prison sentences for sex offenses but remained incarcerated because they could not find housing that complied with an Illinois statute. On April 5, 2020, a male individual filed a class action lawsuit against the Illinois Department of Corrections (&ldquo;IDOC&rdquo;) under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Manish S. Shah.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, the plaintiff was a member of the certified class in <em>Murphy v. Raoul</em>. The plaintiffs in <em>Murphy</em> were individuals who had been convicted of sex offenses and had served the entirety of their sentences but remained incarcerated in Illinois prisons because of their inability to find a suitable host site at which to live while on mandatory supervised release (&ldquo;MSR&rdquo;). The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that Illinois&rsquo;s statutory and regulatory scheme violated the <em>Murphy</em> class&rsquo;s constitutional rights. On January 15, 2020, the district court issued a permanent injunction requiring the IDOC to set forth the specific steps it would take to ensure that no member of the class would remain imprisoned after January 2, 2021, due to an inability to comply with the host-site requirement.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged that the plaintiff remained incarcerated 18 months beyond his court-ordered term of imprisonment. The plaintiff asserted that the sole reason his release was denied was because of Illinois&rsquo;s &ldquo;One-Per-Address&rdquo; statute, which prohibited individuals on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same condominium complex or apartment complex. The plaintiff also emphasized the health risks of detention amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The complaint claimed that the challenged scheme violated the Eighth Amendment, and substantive due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day the complaint was filed, April 5, 2020, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2020, the plaintiff moved to certify the class.</p>\r\n<p>The case was reassigned to Judge Virginia M. Kendall on April 8, 2020, because of its similarity to another case before Judge Kendall.</p>\r\n<p>The court ordered the plaintiff released to MSR on April 8, 2020, ruling that he was &ldquo;clearly suffering a constitutional harm each day he [was] detained past his release date,&rdquo; and that the harm &ldquo;can only be remedied by release.&rdquo; The court held that the defendants were unable to justify the One Per Address provision with penological or rehabilitative support and that the &ldquo;public's interest in only hav[ing] one sex offender live at one residence is not supported by any testimony, expert opinion, or evidence.&rdquo; Therefore the court held the statute unconstitutional as it applied to the named plaintiff and enjoined the defendants from prohibiting his release.</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, more than a dozen additional <em>Murphy</em> class members filed an amended complaint, adding a Fourteenth Amendment claim that alleged a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. They sought to represent the same class that the original plaintiff had proposed. The plaintiffs filed a second motion for a preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from enforcing the statute and an amended motion to certify the class. The court ordered their release to MSR on May 13, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Yet another group of plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on May 26, 2020; their release was ordered on June 3, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2020, the court granted class certification. On the same day, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all their claims, challenging the constitutionality of the One-Per-Address statute.</p>\r\n<p>In a series of over 50 preliminary injunction orders from April 2020 to August 2022, the court ordered the release of the named plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2021, the summary judgment motion filed on July 1, 2020 was granted with respect to the plaintiffs&rsquo; Eighth Amendment claims, and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claims but was denied with respect to their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Eighth Amendment claim: This claim was upheld because prolonged incarceration is a punishment under the Eighth Amendment, and the court found that the One-Per-Address statute &ldquo;operates to keep indigent and homeless sex offenders incarcerated beyond their term of imprisonment.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim: This claim was upheld because the court found that IDOC&rsquo;s application of the One-Per-Address Statute created an &ldquo;illegal classification based on wealth&rdquo; and deprived Plaintiffs of their conditional liberty on MSR as a result of their inability to pay.</li>\r\n<li>Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim: This claim was dismissed based on the court&rsquo;s reasoning that it created an analytical redundancy to bring a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment when the Eighth Amendment provided an &ldquo;explicit textual source&rdquo; of constitutional protection against the governmental behavior at issue.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On August 22, 2022, the civil suit was terminated. The court permanently enjoined the defendant from enforcing the One-Per-Address Statute.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2023, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for fees in part.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

As set forth in their \nprevious motions (ECF Nos. 3 and 17), Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of \nOne-Per Address Statute, a section of the Illinois Code of Corrections which \nprohibits an individual on MSR for a sex offense from living “at the same address or \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:221\nin the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably \nshould know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision for a sex \noffense.”  \n  Urgent court intervention is necessary to halt the application of the Statute to \nthe Plaintiffs identified in this motion. In the absence of injunctive relief, (1) \nPlaintiffs Kevin Manson and Luis Aponte, who have been released to approved host \nsites in the community, will be revoked and sent back to prison because their \nhousing no longer complies with the One-Per-Address Statute; and (2) Plaintiffs \nGalindo, Medina, Escamilla, Shaffer, Barguen, Givens, Dean, Fluckert, Boykin, \nGarrison, Huddleston, Aleman, Lloyd, Kelley, Dunn, Reginald Harris and Johnny \nHarris, all of whom are entitled to release on MSR, will continue to be incarcerated \nbeyond the completion of their sentences. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND1 \nI.  Enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute Will Result in the Unjust \nImprisonment of Plaintiffs  \n \nA. Luis Aponte and Kevin Manson are at Risk of Revocation of their \nMSR Because of the One-Per-Address Statute  \n \n1.  Luis Aponte \n \n  Plaintiff Luis Aponte was released from IDOC onto MSR in January 2020 to his \nfather’s home in Waukegan, Illinois. Ex. 1, Decl. of Aponte, at ¶1. The host site is in \n                                                        \n1   For purposes of brevity, Plaintiffs do not reiterate factual matters set forth in full in \nPlaintiffs’ first two motions for a preliminary injunction (ECF Nos. 3 and 17), including \ndetails about the Murphy litigation and the risks posed by the spread of COVID-19 in IDOC \nfacilities. \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:222\na four-story apartment building that contains approximately 12 separate units. Id. \nat ¶2. When Aponte was released, no other registrant lived in the building. Id. \nIDOC determined that the address complies with the prohibition on residing within \n500 feet of a school, playground or daycare, and approved Aponte to live there while \non MSR. Id. Aponte is doing well on MSR. He has full-time employment in a \nwarehouse and consistently has been attending required sex offender therapy since \nhis release. Id. at ¶3.   \n  In March 2020, another registrant (not on MSR) moved into a different unit in \nthe same building where Aponte resides with his father. Id. at ¶4. Aponte had no \nknowledge that this person had moved in until Aponte has received notice from his \nparole agent that if he does not find somewhere else to live, he will have his MSR \nrevoked and be sent back to prison because the One-Per-Address Statute prohibits \nhim from living in the same apartment building as another registrant. Id. at ¶5. \n  Aponte has not been able to find another host site that IDOC will approve and \nthat he can afford on his current income. Id. at ¶6. He wants to keep residing with \nhis father, which has been a good environment for him and has been fostering his \nsuccess on MSR. Id. at ¶7. If the One-Per-Address Statute is enforced against him, \nhe will be revoked and sent back to prison, resulting in loss of his job, halting the \nprogress he has made on MSR so far, and forcing him to serve “dead time” until he \ncan secure a new place to live.  \n   \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:223\n2.  Kevin Manson \n  Plaintiff Kevin Manson was released from IDOC onto MSR on May 6, 2020. He \ncurrently resides in Chicago Heights, Illinois, with his aunt. Ex. 2, Decl. of Kevin \nManson, at ¶1. IDOC approved Manson for release to his aunt’s home, but that \napproval was given in error. Id. at ¶2. When Manson tried to register with Chicago \nHeights police after his release, he was informed that his aunt’s house is too close to \na school and thus he may not register there. Id. If he does not move, he will be \ncharged with violation of the registration statute and the prohibition on residing \nwithin 500 feet of a school. Id. \n  Manson does not have funds to pay for housing of his own at present. Id. at ¶3. \nThe Cook County Justice Advisory Council (“CCJAC”), a governmental entity that \nprovides reentry assistance to citizens returning to Cook County after \nimprisonment, is willing to pay for Manson’s housing. Id. New Beginnings, a not-\nfor-profit corporation that provides transitional housing and supportive services on \nthe South Side of Chicago, has a bed available for Manson at 11934 S. Lowe, \nChicago, Illinois, 60628, and is able to take him immediately. Id. at ¶4; Ex. 3, Decl. \nof New Beginnings CEO Otis Williams, at ¶¶2,3. This placement complies with the \nrestriction on residence within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and daycares. \nCCJAC is prepared to pay to house Manson at this location. Ex. 2 at ¶3. \n  IDOC has not approved Manson to move to New Beginnings pursuant to the \nOne-Per-Address Statute because another registrant already lives at that address. \nId. at ¶5. If the One-Per-Address Statute is enforced against Manson, he will be \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:224\nrevoked and sent back to prison. Id. at ¶6.  He will also be at serious risk of new \ncriminal charges for failure to register and/or for residing too close to a school. Id. \nB. New Beginnings Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class Members \nand Is Prepared to Immediately Offer Housing to Plaintiffs Galindo, \nHuddleston, Givens, Dean, Fluckert, Boykin, Garrison, Johnny \nHarris, Aleman, Lloyd, Kelly, Dunn and Manson  \n \n  New Beginnings Recovery Homes Inc. is a Chicago-based not-for-profit \ncorporation that was established in 1993. Ex. 3, Decl. of New Beginnings CEO Otis \nWilliams at ¶1. New Beginnings owns and operates five buildings on the South Side \nof Chicago at which it provides affordable transitional housing, meals and \nsupportive services to individuals who are released from prison or have experienced \nhomelessness. Id. Residents at New Beginnings receive meals and have access to \nservices, including peer support groups, counseling with licensed providers and case \nmanagement. Id. at ¶2. All of New Beginnings’ properties are compliant with the \nhousing restrictions that prohibit people who have been convicted of sex offenses \nfrom living within 500 feet of schools, daycares or playgrounds. Id. Each of these \nbuildings has 24-hour a day security and structured supervision for residents. Id. \nNew Beginnings has significant experience with housing individuals recently \nreleased from prison and assisting with their successful transition back into the \ncommunity. Id. \n  Plaintiffs Galindo, Huddleston, Givens, Dean, Fluckert, Boykin, Garrison, \nJohnny Harris, Aleman, Lloyd and Kelley have all completed their sentences of \nincarceration and are entitled to release from IDOC on MSR, but they all remain \nimprisoned because they have been unable to secure compliant housing. Each of \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:225\nthese Plaintiffs would like to reside while on MSR at properties operated by New \nBeginnings. Galindo, Huddleston, Givens, Dean, Boykin, Garrison, Johnny Harris \nand Dunn would like to be released to 6655 S. Perry, Chicago, Illinois 60621; and \nFluckert, Aleman, Lloyd, and Kelley would like to be released to 11934 S. Lowe, \nChicago, Illinois 60628. Id. at ¶¶3, 4. Plaintiffs all have a satisfactory way to pay for \nhousing at New Beginnings. Id. at ¶3. New Beginnings has sufficient beds available \nat each of these locations and is prepared to accept the Plaintiffs immediately. Id. \nThe sole reason IDOC cannot approve Plaintiffs for release to New Beginnings \nproperties is the One-Per-Address Statute. Thus, the Plaintiffs remain imprisoned.  \nC. Wayside Cross Ministries Can Accept Additional Class Members \n \n  As set forth in Plaintiffs’ previous motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. \n17), Wayside Cross Ministries is a Christian ministry that has operated in Aurora, \nIllinois, for more than 90 years. See ECF No. 17-5, Declaration of Jonathan Beall, at \n¶1. The Master’s Touch Ministry at Wayside Cross is a Bible-based, residential life-\ntransformation program for troubled men. Id. at ¶2. The program offers room and \nboard at no cost, and empowers its participants to change their lives through \nprayer, Bible study, daily church services, mentoring with local clergy, and work \nrehabilitation programs. Id. It takes a minimum of seven months for a resident to \ncomplete the Master’s Touch Ministry program. The goal of the program is to give \nthe men the tools they need to secure employment and housing and to live healthy, \nlaw-abiding lives through their faith in God. Id. at ¶4. The participants in the \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:226\nMaster’s Touch Ministry all reside together in a dormitory setting at Wayside \nCross, located at 215 E. New York Street in Aurora. Id. at ¶10. \n  Pursuant to the Court’s May 13, 2020, Order (ECF No. 22), eight Plaintiffs \nalready have been released to Wayside Cross Ministries and are currently \nparticipating in the Master’s Touch Ministry program there. Wayside Cross has \nseveral additional openings in the Master’s Touch Ministry and is willing to accept \nother members of the proposed class at no cost to the IDOC or to the program \nparticipants. Id. at ¶5.2  \n  Plaintiffs Juan Medina, Adam Escamilla, Ashief Shaffer, Reginald Harris and \nEdward Bartgen are all members of the proposed class who have completed their \nsentences of incarceration and are entitled to release from IDOC on MSR, but they \nremain imprisoned because they do not have resources to secure compliant housing. \nThese Plaintiffs all would like to participate in the Master’s Touch Ministry at \nWayside Cross and have been determined preliminarily to meet the criteria for \nadmission to the program. Id. at ¶11. IDOC is currently prohibited from allowing \nthese individuals to be released to Wayside Cross because of the One-Per-Address \nStatute. Thus, Plaintiffs Medina, Escamilla, Shaffer, Bartguen and Harris remain \nimprisoned indefinitely.  \n                                                        \n2   Because of its proximity to what the City of Aurora deems to be a playground, Wayside \nCross cannot accept into its program individuals who are classified as “child sex offenders,” \nbut it can accept individuals whose offenses involved an adult victim. Id. at ¶9. \nUndersigned counsel has confirmed with Aurora Corporation Counsel Rick Veenstra that \nAurora police are willing to register parolees at Wayside Cross provided they are not \nclassified as “child sex offenders.” None of the ten Plaintiffs seeking placement at Wayside \nCross is classified as a “child sex offender.” \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:227\nII. The Challenged Statute \n  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). The sole mechanism through which the \nOne-Per-Address Statue is enforced is through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of \nparolees’ proposed host sites. That is, it is not a criminal offense for an individual on \nMSR for a sex offense to live at the same address as another registrant.3 \n  The One-Per-Address Statute went into effect on July 11, 2005. Prior to that \ndate, individuals on MSR for sex offenses were permitted to live in the same \nresidence as other registrants. On information and belief, the One-Per-Address \nStatute is a major cause, if not the single largest cause, of the continued \nimprisonment of members of the Murphy class. This is so because other statutes \n(e.g., the 500-foot rules) already strictly circumscribe the areas where individuals \nconvicted of sex offenses may live, and the One-Per-Address Statute makes it so \nonly one parolee can live at each compliant property, even if it is a large apartment \ncomplex with many units.  \n  There is no reason to conclude that allowing people who have been convicted of \nsex offenses to live near one another contributes to criminality. At least one analysis \nfound that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re-offense and \nimproves supervision. A Minnesota Department of Corrections report concluded as \nfollows:  \n                                                        \n3   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:228\nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative \neffect related to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In \nfact, supervision agents in both Hennepin and Ramsey County have noted \nbenefits from having more than one level three offender living in one \nlocation. Closer supervision is possible because travel time between \noffenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who live with other level \nthree offenders experience more visits from a supervising agent because \nagents for both offenders visit the same property. Finally, offenders tend \nto inform on each other when supervision restrictions are violated or \ncrimes are committed.4  \n \n  There is no logical reason to believe that there is a compelling public safety need \nto prohibit people on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same address as one \nanother. In the Murphy litigation, the IDOC did not come forth with any safety or \nrehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute. In acknowledgement of \nthe restriction’s excessiveness, IDOC has already reinterpreted the restriction so as \nnot to apply to trailer parks or adjacent apartment buildings. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-\ncv-11471, ECF No. 161. \nARGUMENT \nI. Preliminary Injunction Standard \n  To be entitled to a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish four \nelements: (1) some likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the lack of an adequate \nremedy at law; (3) a likelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm if the \ninjunction is not granted; and (4) the balance of hardships tips in the moving party’s \nfavor. Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001). \n                                                        \n4   See “Level Three Sex Offender Residential Placement Issues,” Minnesota Department of \nCorrections (available at: \nhttps://mn.gov/doc/assets/Lvl%203%20SEX%20OFFENDERS%20report%202003%20(revise\nd%202-04)_tcm1089-272828.pdf) (last visited April 3, 2020) \n \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:229\n  As shown below, Plaintiffs meet each element for establishing an entitlement to \ninjunctive relief, and accordingly this Court should issue a preliminary injunction to \nhalt enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute.  \nII. Plaintiffs Have a Likelihood of Success on their Claims that Continued \nEnforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute Violates the U.S. \nConstitution   \n \n  As this Court determined in ruling on Plaintiffs’ previous motions for \npreliminary injunctive relief, Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on their claim \nthat the continued enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute violates the \nconstitutional rights of the Plaintiffs.  \n  In Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019), this Court has \nalready determined that it violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth \nAmendment to subject individuals to indefinite incarceration solely because they \ncannot meet the host site requirement, holding as follows:  \nAt the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is freedom \nfrom indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The … current application \nof  the  host  site  requirement  results  in  the  continued  deprivation  of  the \nplaintiffs’  fundamental  rights  and  therefore  contravenes  the  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. \n \nIn particular, this Court concluded that the continued imprisonment of individuals \nwho do not have the money or outside support to comply with the host site \nrequirement violates the Eighth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause \nbecause it is solely “the consequence of [the plaintiffs’] indigency, homelessness, and \nthe attendant powerlessness to procure housing that will satisfy the IDOC.” Id. at \n756.  \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:230\n  The Plaintiffs who bring this motion are all in the same boat as the members of \nthe Murphy class because they are all entitled to be released from prison to serve \ntheir MSR time in the community, but they remain imprisoned (or in the case of \nAponte and Manson, face the imminent possibility of re-imprisonment) because they \nlack the resources to obtain housing that complies with the onerous restrictions \nimposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy.5   \n  For these Plaintiffs, there is one particular aspect of law that stands in the way \nof their being able to reside at otherwise compliant and affordable host sites: the \nOne-Per-Address Statute. Significantly, over the course of the Murphy litigation, \nwhich has been ongoing for four years and generated hundreds of pages of summary \njudgment briefing, the IDOC never put forth a public safety or rehabilitative \njustification for the One-Per-Address Statute. Indeed, when this Court granted an \ninjunction prohibiting enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute as to Marcus \nBarnes, another member of the Murphy class who had a suitable place to live but \nfor the One-Per-Address rule, this Court noted the lack of evidentiary support for \nthe Statute, writing as follows: \nIn response to the question about what penological or rehabilitative support \nthe  Defendants  have  for  the  “One  Person  One  Address”  provision, \nDefendants were unable to give any. The public’s interest in only hav[ing] \none sex offender live at one residence is not supported by any testimony, \n                                                        \n5   Plaintiffs Columbo Galindo, Juan Medina, Adam Escamilla, Aishef Shaffer, Reginald \nHarris, Edward Bartgen, Lavonne Givens, Lashaun Dean, Justin Fluckert, Dontae Boykin, \nJoshua Huddleston, Manuel Aleman, Melvin Kelley and Andre Dunn are members of the \nMurphy class. Plaintiffs Luis Aponte and Kevin Manson are former Murphy class members \nwho will become members of the class again if they are revoked. Plaintiffs Ronald Garrison \nand Johnny Harris are not members of the Murphy class because they have determinate \nMSR sentences, but they also remain imprisoned beyond the completion of their court-\nimposed sentences.  \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:231\nexpert opinion, or evidence. Therefore, the Court finds that the statute is \nunconstitutional as it applies to Plaintiff and Defendants are enjoined from \nprohibiting his release to the address presented by Plaintiff. \n \nECF No. 11.  \n  The same result should occur here. Each of the Plaintiffs has a safe host site at \nwhich to live outside of prison. The host sites at which Plaintiffs wish to live will be \nsupportive of their reintegration into the community and meet every requirement \nimposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy, save the One-Per-Address Statute. In the \nabsence of a legitimate justification for the prohibition on more than one parolee’s \nliving at a particular address, the continued application of the One-Per-Address \nStatute to Plaintiffs violates their constitutional rights for all of the reasons the \nCourt recognized in Murphy. \nIII.  Plaintiffs and Others Similarly Situated are Suffering and Will \nContinue to Suffer Irreparable Injury in the Absence of an Injunction  \n \n  If an injunction is not granted, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated will suffer \ntwo forms of irreparable injury. One, they will continue to be imprisoned in \nviolation of their constitutional right to be released from prison on MSR. And two, \nthey will continue to be exposed to a high risk of being infected with COVID-19.6 \nSuch harms unquestionably constitute irreparable injury. Aguilar v. Gaston-\nCamara, 861 F.3d 626, 631 (7th Cir. 2017) (“additional incarceration without \n                                                        \n6   As set forth in full in Plaintiffs’ previous motions for a preliminary injunction, \nimprisoned individuals are at a particularly high risk of contracting COVID-19. COVID-19 \ninfections in IDOC facilities continue to rise. At the time the initial complaint was filed, 56 \nIDOC inmates had tested positive. ECF No. 1 at ¶46. Now, that number is 215 (See IDOC, \nCOVID-19 Response, available at: \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx). \n \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:232\npenological justification” violates the Eighth Amendment); Hampton v. Leibach, 99 \nC 5473, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20983, at *5-6 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2001) (a plaintiff \n“suffers irreparable harm each day that he is imprisoned in violation of the United \nStates Constitution.”); Harris v. Board of Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. \n2004) (accepting “pain,” “infection,” and “medical complications” as forms of \nirreparable harm warranting injunctive relief). \n  Moreover, it is well established that when a plaintiff establishes a likelihood of \nsuccess on a claim that a government action violates his constitutional rights, he \nmeets the element of showing irreparable harm. See Ezell v. City of Chi., 651 F.3d \n684, 699 (7th Cir. 2011) (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is \ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is \nnecessary.”) (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \n§ 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)); Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978) \n(“The existence of a continuing constitutional violation constitutes proof of an \nirreparable harm.”).  \nIV.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor Granting Relief \n \n  The public interest also favors the granting of the requested relief. First, there is \nno public safety justification for refusing to release Plaintiffs to New Beginnings or \nWayside Cross Ministries. New Beginnings has 27 years of experience with helping \nindividuals successfully transition from prison to the community. All of its \nproperties have 24-hour a day security and structured supervision for residents.   \nSimilarly, Wayside Cross Ministries has nearly 100 years of experience helping \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:233\nindividuals just like the Plaintiffs reintegrate into society through its highly \nstructured faith-based programming. Kane County State’s Attorney Joe McMahon \nhas lauded Wayside’s long track record of success with individuals who have been \nconvicted of sex offenses, stating, “The work that they’ve done there at the Mission \nhas been remarkable for decades.”7  \n  Thus, Wayside Cross and New Beginnings are precisely the type of rehabilitative \nsettings to which IDOC should be releasing the Plaintiffs. Moreover, both of these \nhousing options are available at no additional cost to the State of Illinois, which is \ncurrently paying tens of thousands of dollars a year to keep the Plaintiffs in prison \nbeyond their release dates.8 \n  Likewise, there is no public safety justification for refusing to allow Plaintiff \nAponte to remain at his father’s home. The IDOC approved Aponte for release to his \nfather’s home six months ago after determining it met all of the requirements of \nstate law and IDOC policy. Since his release in January, Aponte has done well on \nMSR. He has had no violations of the terms of his MSR; he is working full time; and \nhe has consistently attended sex offender therapy. Aponte should not be sent back \n                                                        \n7   See “Convicted Sex Offenders’ Ministry Housing Too Close To Playground, City Says,” \nNational Public Radio, January 15, 2020; audio recording available at: \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796021411/convicted-sex-offenders-ministry-housing-too- \nclose-to-playground-city-says  \n \n8   See “IDOC Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Report” at 80 (In 2018, the average annual cost of \nkeeping a person incarcerated in an IDOC facility was $27,930) (available at \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/reportsandstatistics/Documents/FY18%20Annual%20Report\n%20FINAL.pdf). \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:234\nto prison simply because another registrant (whom he does not know and has never \nmet) lives in another unit in the same building.   \n  During this pandemic, other public safety factors also strongly favor issuance of \nan injunction that will allow Plaintiffs and others to be released to safe host sites \noutside of prison. Other persons imprisoned in IDOC who cannot be released at \npresent are endangered by overcrowding, which increases the risk of disease \ntransmission; and the public at large is put at risk if medical resources are \noverwhelmed by the hospitalization of imprisoned people in downstate communities \nwith few hospital beds.  \n  Finally, the public has a strong interest in protecting constitutional rights that \nwould be well served by granting injunctive relief here. See ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 \nF.3d 583, 589-90 (7th Cir. 2012) (“[T]he public interest is not harmed by \npreliminarily enjoining the enforcement of a statute that is probably \nunconstitutional.”)  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nHonorable Court enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of 730 \nILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) as to Plaintiffs so they can be released from prison to the \notherwise compliant host sites identified above. \n                        Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Adele D.

My name is Luis Aponte. I was released from IDOC onto mandatory supervised release \nin January 2020 to my father’s home in Waukegan, Illinois. I have three-years-to-life of MSR. \n2.  My father’s home is in a four-story apartment building that contains approximately 12 \nseparate units. When I was released, no other registrant lived in the building. IDOC determined \nthat the address complies with the prohibition on residing within 500 feet of a school, \nplayground or daycare, and approved me to live there while on MSR.  \n3.  I am doing well on MSR. I have a full-time job in a warehouse and have been attending \nrequired sex offender therapy regularly. \n4.  In March 2020, another registrant (not on parole) moved into a different unit in the \nsame building where I live with my father.  \n5.  I received notice from my parole agent that I have to move because of this other \nregistrant in the building. If I do not find somewhere else to live, I will have my MSR revoked \nand will be sent back to prison. If I go back to prison, I will lose my job and will be stuck in IDOC \nuntil I can find another place to live.  \n6.  I have been looking for another place to live, but I have not been able to find a host site \nthat IDOC will approve and that I can afford with my current income.  \n7.  I want to keep living with my father while I adjust to life on parole and get back on my \nfeet.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:237\n \n_________________      _5_-2_4_-_2_0_____ \nLuis Aponte         Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:238\nDeclaration of Kevin Manson \n1.  My name is Kevin Manson. I was released from IDOC onto mandatory supervised \nrelease on May 6, 2020. I currently reside in Chicago Heights, Illinois, with my aunt. I have \nthree-years-to life of MSR.  \n2.  IDOC approved me for release to my aunt’s home, but when I tried to register with \nChicago Heights police, I was informed that my aunt’s house is too close to a school and I have \nto move somewhere else.  \n3.  I just got out of prison and don’t have funds to pay for housing of my own. The Cook \nCounty Justice Advisory Council (“CCJAC”), a governmental entity that provides reentry \nassistance to citizens returning to Cook County after imprisonment, is willing to pay for my \nhousing through an agency called New Beginnings.  \n4.  It is my understanding that New Beginnings has a bed available for me at 11934 S. Lowe \nChicago Illinois, 60628, and is able to take me immediately. \n5.  I have not yet been approved to go to New Beginnings because there is another \nregistrant living at 11934 S. Lowe and I am prohibited from living at the same address as \nanother sex offender.  \n6.  If I am not allowed to go to New Beginnings I will not have a compliant place to live and \nwill be sent back to prison. I could also be criminally charged with failure to register and \nresiding too close to a school.  \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:239\n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n_________________      ___________ \nKevin Manson        Date \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25-3 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:240\nDeclaration of Otis Williams \n1.  My name is Otis Williams. I am the founder and CEO of New Beginnings Recovery \nHomes Inc. (NBRHI). NBRHI is a Chicago-based not-for-profit corporation that has been in \noperation since 1993. NBRHI provides affordable transitional housing and supportive services to \npeople transitioning from prison to the community, individuals who are experiencing housing \ninsecurity, and individuals who are in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. \n2.  NBHRI  owns five buildings on the south side of Chicago at which it provides dormitory \nstyle or semi-private shared living accommodations. Residents at NBHRI buildings receive meals \nand have access to services including peer support groups, counseling with licensed providers \nand case management. Our properties are compliant with the housing restrictions that prohibit \npeople who have been convicted of sex offenses from living within 500 feet of schools, \ndaycares or playgrounds. Each of these buildings has 24-hour a day security and structured \nsupervision for residents. Our goal is to help our residents become positive, productive citizens. \nWe have significant experience with housing individuals who are being released from prison \nand assisting with their successful transition back into the community.  \n3.  We currently have openings in our buildings located at 6655 S Perry Chicago, IL 60621 \nand 11934 S. Lowe Chicago Illinois, 60628. We are prepared to immediately accept Columbo \nGalindo, Joshua Huddleston, Lavonne Givens, Lashaun Dean, Justin Fluckert, Dontae Boykin, \nRonald Garrison, Johnny Harris, Manuel Aleman, Arnold Lloyd, Melvin Kelley, Andre Dunn, and \nKevin Manson to reside at these locations. These individuals meet the requirements for \nenrollment in our program and each has a satisfactory way to make payment for his room and \nboard.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 25-3 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:241\n4.  We are aware that each of these individuals will be on parole for a sex offense and \ntherefore is legally prohibited from living at the same address as another person with a sex \noffense conviction. That is the only barrier standing in the way of these individuals’ being \nreleased to NBRHI.  \n5.  If the restriction on housing more than one sex offender at the same address is \neliminated, we are willing and able to house additional parolees at these and other properties, \nspace permitting.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n___________________ \nOtis J.

They remain in prison because they \nhave been unable to secure an approved “host site” at which to live while on MSR.  \n  In Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019), this Court has \nalready concluded that it violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth \nAmendment to subject individuals to indefinite incarceration solely because they \ncannot meet the host site requirement, holding as follows:  \nAt the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is freedom \nfrom indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The Attorney General and \nDirector’s  current  application  of  the  host  site  requirement  results  in  the \ncontinued  deprivation  of  the  plaintiffs’  fundamental  rights  and  therefore \ncontravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \nthe United States. \n \n  That decision was entered more than a year ago on March 31, 2019. As of April \n29, 2020, 317 members of the Murphy class remain imprisoned in violation of their \nconstitutional rights. Presently, the world is in the grip of an unprecedented public \nhealth emergency that poses a particular danger to incarcerated individuals. There \nhave been diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in 15 IDOC facilities.1 Now, not only are \nthe members of the Murphy class being detained in prison in violation of their \nconstitutional rights; but every day that class members remain incarcerated poses a \ngrave risk to their health and safety.  \n                                                        \n1    “COVID-19 Response,” Illinois Dept. of Corrections,  \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx (last visited April 27, \n2020) \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 3 of 30 PageID #:103\n  Each of the named Plaintiffs has identified a safe place to live outside of prison \nthat satisfies almost all of the statutory requirements restricting where he is \npermitted to live while on MSR.  \n•  Plaintiffs Galindo, Sampson and Margarella seek release to the vacant rooms \nin the four properties IDOC leases from NewDay Apartments for the purpose \nof providing transitional housing to Murphy class members;  \n \n•  Plaintiffs Green, Chamblis, Crowe, Monson, Easton, Atkins, Schroeder, \nCouncil, Shelton, Faller, and Hubbard seek release to Wayside Cross \nMinistries, a Bible-based transitional housing program in Aurora, Illinois; \n \n•  Plaintiff Kenneth Sparks seeks release to his mother’s home in Chappell, \nNebraska, to live with his mom and uncle; and \n \n•  Plaintiff Joshua Huddleston seeks release to InTown Suites, an extended-\nstay motel in Villa Park, Illinois.  \n \n  IDOC is currently unable to release Plaintiffs to these host sites because a \nsection of the Illinois Uniform Code of Corrections prohibits individuals on MSR for \nsex offenses from living “at the same address or in the same condominium unit or \napartment unit or in the same condominium complex or apartment complex with \nanother person he or she knows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex \noffender or has been placed on supervision for a sex offense.” 730 ILCS 5/3-3-\n7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute” or “the Statute”). \n  Plaintiffs now ask this Court to enjoin enforcement of the One-Per-Address \nStatute because, for the reasons set forth below, its application to the named \nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated violates the Equal Protection Clause and the  \nEighth Amendment.  \n   \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 4 of 30 PageID #:104\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  All of the Named Plaintiffs Could Be Released to Approved Host Sites \nBut for the One-Per-Address Statute \n \nA. NewDay Apartments Has Four Valid Host Sites Available for Murphy \nClass Members and Seeks to Provide More Housing to Registrants   \n \n  NewDay Apartments, located in Lake County, Illinois, specializes in providing \ncompliant housing to registrants. NewDay has partnered with the IDOC to provide \nhousing to individuals with sex offense convictions being released from prison onto \nMSR. Ex. 1, Declaration of Bob McKelvey, at ¶2. NewDay currently owns seven \nproperties which are more than 500 feet away from any schools, playgrounds and/or \ndaycares. Id. at ¶2. It leases four of these properties directly to the IDOC for the  \npurpose of housing Murphy class members who cannot otherwise secure housing. \nId. at ¶3.   \n  There are currently four parolees living in the four properties IDOC leases from \nNewDay. Id. at ¶4. These units have the capacity to house four additional residents \nin separate bedrooms that are currently empty. Id. at ¶5. But under the One-Per-\nAddress Statute, NewDay is prohibited from having more than one registrant-\nparolee per property. Id. As a result, four bedrooms currently sit vacant in the \nproperties IDOC is leasing from NewDay. IDOC could release four additional \nMurphy class members to NewDay right now at no additional cost to the state for \nhousing them. \n  In addition to the four units NewDay currently leases to IDOC, NewDay seeks to \ngreatly expand the housing it offers to registrant-parolees over the next several \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 5 of 30 PageID #:105\nyears. Id. at ¶6. NewDay’s goal is to double the number of units it makes available \nto registrants each year for at least the next three years. Id. The founder and \nmanager of NewDay Apartments, Bob McKelvey, states that “[p]ermitting multiple \nregistrant-parolees at the same address would easily double the number of available \nunits compared to the current one-per-address rule, and would make the housing \nwe provide more affordable for our registrant tenants.” Id. at ¶¶6, 7. But for the \nOne-Per-Address Statute, NewDay would be willing to lease to parolees the \napartments it currently makes available only to individuals who are off parole. For \nexample, Alvin Goldberg, a member of the Murphy class is on the waiting list to \nrent a unit from NewDay, subject to Alvin’s being able to obtain “a court order \nallowing NewDay to house Alvin with other registrants who live in other units at \nthe same address.” Ex. 10, Declaration of Stephen N. Goldberg.    \n   Plaintiff Columbo Galindo is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center. In \n2008, he was convicted of criminal sexual assault and sentenced to five years in \nIDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. Ex. 2, Galindo IDOC Inmate Status. According \nto IDOC records provided to Plaintiffs, Galindo completed his prison term on March \n11, 2011, and has been entitled to release from prison on MSR since that date, but \nremains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure compliant housing. \nBecause of his inability to find housing, Galindo has spent more than nine years of \n“dead time” in prison. On information and belief, Plaintiff Galindo is next in line for \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 6 of 30 PageID #:106\nplacement at NewDay Apartments because he has done the most “dead time” of any \nmember of the Murphy class who remains in prison.2  \n  On January 23, 2020, Galindo met with a representative of Field Services  at \nTaylorville.3 Galindo was told that he is approved for release to NewDay \nApartments and will be released when one of the units at NewDay becomes \navailable. He was not given any definitive timeline of when a unit would be \navailable for him. He remains imprisoned indefinitely until a unit at NewDay \nbecomes available. \n  Plaintiff Andra Sampson is a prisoner at Big Muddy River Correctional Center. \nIn 2007, he was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault and sentenced to six \nyears in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. Ex. 3, Sampson IDOC Inmate Status. \nAccording to IDOC records provided to Plaintiffs, Sampson completed his prison \nterm on March 18, 2011, and has been entitled to release from prison on MSR since \nthat date, but remains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure compliant \nhousing. Because of his inability to find housing, Sampson has spent more than \n                                                        \n2   The First Amended Complaint and this motion for an injunction were drafted based on \ninformation given to Plaintiffs by the IDOC which indicated that Plaintiffs Columbo \nGalindo and Andra Sampson were the next in line for placement at NewDay. After \nPlaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on April 29, 2020, IDOC gave Plaintiffs a \nrevised database of Murphy class members that contains information different from the \nprevious database Plaintiffs have been working from for the past several months. In \nparticular, additional class members (at least one of whom has been detained for more than \nnine years beyond his release date) were added to the database, and many class members’ \nout dates (e.g., when their original sentences ended) were changed because of errors in the \nIDOC’s recordkeeping. Based on this revised database, IDOC now contends that other \nindividuals have done more dead time than Galindo and will be prioritized for release \nbefore him. \n \n3   Field Services is the IDOC unit charged with responsibility for investigation and \napproval of host sites. \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 7 of 30 PageID #:107\nnine years of “dead time” in prison. On information and belief, Sampson is second in \nline (behind Galindo) for placement at NewDay Apartments because he has done \nthe second most “dead time” among Murphy class members who remain in prison.  \n  In April 2020, Sampson met with Connie Halliday, a counselor in the Field \nServices office at Big Muddy River Correctional Center. Ms. Halliday informed \nSampson that he is approved for placement at NewDay Apartments and will be \nreleased when one of the units at NewDay becomes available. He was not given any \ndefinitive timeline of when a unit would be available for him, but Ms. Halliday \nexpressed hope that he would be released “soon.” He remains imprisoned \nindefinitely until a unit at NewDay becomes available. \n  Plaintiff John Margarella is a prisoner at Dixon Correctional Center. In 2012, he \nwas convicted of possession of child pornography and sentenced to three years in \nIDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. With “good time” credits, he completed his \nprison term on December 30, 2013, and has been entitled to release from prison on \nMSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure \ncompliant housing. Ex. 4, Declaration of Rosemary Margarella, at ¶2. Because of his \ninability to find housing, Margarella has spent more than six years of “dead time” in \nprison. Id. \n  Every member of Margarella’s family who is able has offered to have him come \nlive with them, but IDOC has rejected all proposed host sites because of their \nproximity to schools or playgrounds, or because of the presence of children at the \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 8 of 30 PageID #:108\nhost site. Id. at ¶3. Margarella’s family cannot afford to pay for separate housing for \nhim. Id. at ¶4. \n  Margarella is at high risk for suffering serious health complications if he \ncontracts COVID-19. Id. at ¶5. Margarella is 57 years old and has suffered two \nheart attacks while imprisoned at Dixon Correctional Center beyond his out date. \nId. While he was being treated for one of the heart attacks, he received medication \nthat caused internal hemorrhaging resulting in a blood transfusion. Id.  \n  There is no logical reason why Galindo, Sampson and Margarella remain in \nprison in violation of their constitutional rights while IDOC has vacant bedrooms in \nhousing it currently leases from NewDay apartments. If the One-Per-Address \nStatute were lifted, these individuals could be immediately released to housing that \nthe IDOC has already deemed to be suitable. In addition, lifting the One-Per-\nAddress Statute would empower NewDay to offer significantly more housing to \nother Murphy class members who need host sites. \nB. Wayside Cross Ministries Seeks to Provide Host Sites to at Least 10 \nMurphy Class Members \n \n  Wayside Cross Ministries is a Bible-based mission that has operated in Aurora, \nIllinois, for more than 90 years. Ex. 5, Declaration of Jonathan Beall, at ¶1. The \nMaster’s Touch Ministry at Wayside Cross is a Bible-based, residential life-\ntransformation program for troubled men. Id. at ¶2. The program offers room and \nboard at no cost, and empowers its participants to change their lives through \nprayer, Bible study, daily church services, mentoring with local clergy and business \nleaders, and work rehabilitation programs. Id. It takes a minimum of seven months \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 9 of 30 PageID #:109\nfor a resident to complete the Master’s Touch Ministry program. The goal of the \nprogram is to give the men the tools they need to secure employment and housing \nand to live healthy, law abiding lives through their faith in God. Id. at ¶4. \n  Wayside Cross currently has several openings in the Master’s Touch Ministry \nand is willing to accept members of the Murphy class at no cost to the IDOC or to \nthe program participants. Id. at ¶5.4 The participants in the Masters Touch \nMinistry all reside together in a dormitory setting at Wayside Cross, located at 215 \nE. New York Street in Aurora. Id. at ¶10. \n  Plaintiffs Kenneth Green, Fredrick Chamblis, Corey Crowe, Dana Monson, \nDavid Easton, Joshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, Wade Council, Christopher \nShelton and Mark Faller are all members of the Murphy class who have completed \ntheir sentences of incarceration and are entitled to release from IDOC on MSR, but \nremain imprisoned because they do not have resources to secure compliant housing. \nPlaintiffs Green, Chamblis, Crowe, Monson, Easton, Atkins, Schroeder, Council, \nShelton and Faller all would like to participate in the Master’s Touch Ministry at \nWayside Cross. Id. at ¶11. \n  Staff at Wayside Cross have conducted phone interviews with these ten \nPlaintiffs and determined that each meets the criteria for admission to the Master’s \n                                                        \n4   Because of its proximity to what the City of Aurora deems to be a playground, Wayside \nCross cannot accept into its program individuals who are classified as “child sex offenders,” \nbut it can accept individuals whose offenses involved an adult victim. Id. at ¶9. \nUndersigned counsel has confirmed with Aurora Corporation Counsel Rick Veenstra that \nAurora police are willing to register parolees at Wayside Cross provided they are not \nclassified as “child sex offenders.” None of the ten Plaintiffs seeking placement at Wayside \nCross is classified as a “child sex offender.” \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 10 of 30 PageID #:110\nTouch Ministry. Id. at ¶9. Wayside Cross is prepared to accept these individuals \nimmediately, provided they test negative for COVID-19 and the information they \nprovided in their intake screening was true and complete. Id. at ¶12.   \n  In connection with these phone interviews, Jon Beall, the program director of the \nMaster’s Touch Ministry, along with members of his staff spoke to Field Services \nofficials from the IDOC facilities at which these Plaintiffs are imprisoned. Id. at \n¶13. The Field Services officials stated that the Plaintiffs will not be approved for \nrelease to Wayside Cross in the absence of a “court order” allowing them to reside \nthere. Id. \n  The sole reason IDOC has not allowed individuals on MSR for sex offenses \nagainst adult victims to serve their MSR time at Wayside Cross Ministries is the \nOne-Per-Address Statute. \nC. Murphy Class Member Jonathan Sparks Should Be Released to His \nMother’s House  \n \n  Plaintiff Jonathan Sparks is a member of the Murphy class. He is currently a \nprisoner at Big Muddy River Correctional Center. Ex. 6, Declaration of Sparks at \n¶1.5 In 2010, Sparks was convicted of criminal sexual assault and sentenced to four \nyears in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. Id. He completed his prison term on \nJuly 29, 2013, and has been entitled to release from prison on MSR since that date, \nbut remains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure housing. Id. at ¶2. \n                                                        \n5   Mr. Sparks submitted a signed declaration in connection with Plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgment in Murphy in February 2018. Mr. Sparks’ situation has not changed \nsince that time, and the same declaration is submitted here.  \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 11 of 30 PageID #:111\nBecause of his inability to find housing, Sparks has spent nearly seven years of \n“dead time” in prison. Id. \n  All of Sparks’ family is out of state. Id. at ¶5. Sparks seeks to live with his \nmother who resides in Chappell, Nebraska, while on MSR. Id. Sparks’ mother is \nwilling and able to house and support Sparks if he is released to her home. Sparks \nsought approval for interstate transfer to Nebraska to reside with his mother. Id. \nIDOC rejected the placement solely because Sparks’ mother lives with her brother \n(Mr. Sparks’ uncle) who was convicted of a sex offense in the 1990s. Id. \n  The One-Per-Address Statute is the sole reason Mr. Sparks has not been \napproved to reside with his mother and uncle. \nD. Members of the Murphy Class Could Be Released to Single-Room \nOccupancies and Extended-Stay Motels \n \n  Plaintiff Joshua Huddleston is a member of the Murphy class. He is currently a \nprisoner at Robinson Correctional Center. Ex. 7, Huddleston IDOC Inmate Status.  \nIn 2013, Huddleston was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault and \nsentenced to six years in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. Id. He completed his \nprison term on January 22, 2019, and has been entitled to release from prison on \nMSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure \nhousing. Id. Because of his inability to find housing, Huddleston has spent 15 \nmonths of “dead time” in prison. Id. \n  Huddleston does not have any family outside of prison who can offer him a place \nto stay or help him secure housing. Huddleston is retired from the U.S. military and \nhas a savings account with sufficient funds to pay for his own housing for at least a \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 12 of 30 PageID #:112\nyear. However, because he is imprisoned, he is not able to search for housing, sign a \nlease, or set up utilities. For an individual in Mr. Huddleston’s position, an \nextended-stay motel or a single-room occupancy (SRO) building are the only viable \noptions for securing housing at which to live while on MSR. This is so because IDOC \nrequires functioning utilities at the host site prior to approving an individual for \nrelease, and an individual who doesn’t have outside help can’t set up a phone line \nand electric service while imprisoned. Ex. 8, Excerpt of Deposition of Deputy Chief \nDixon, at 75. \n  Mr. Huddleston would like to parole to an extended-stay motel or an SRO. Such \na host site would be ideal for him because such locations are furnished and have \nutilities included. Staying at such a location for a period of several months would \nenable Huddleston to start his MSR time, get back on his feet and locate suitable \nhousing of his own.  \n  InTown Suites, located at 350 East Roosevelt, Villa Park 60181, offers furnished \nrentals on a monthly basis. InTown is willing to rent to an individual on parole \nprovided they have funds to pay for a month in advance and can show valid \nidentification when they check in. On information and belief, InTown Suites \ncomplies with the restriction on living within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and \ndaycares. Ex. 9, Google Maps Aerial View of 350 E. Roosevelt and surrounding area. \n  As a matter of long-standing past practice, IDOC has not considered motels, \nSROs, or shelters to be approvable host sites for individuals who are required to \nregister as sex offenders due to the One-Per-Address Statute. Ex. 8, Excerpt of \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 13 of 30 PageID #:113\nDeposition of Deputy Chief Dixon, at 172-73. It has been the IDOC’s position that \nsuch a placement is not sufficiently stable because an individual could be forced to \nmove if another registrant moves into the same building. Id. (“It’s too transient of a \nsituation. You can have another sex offender that moves or takes up shelter there, \nand then now … our guy’s in violation, and will have to be returned home.”) \nII. The Murphy Litigation \n  The plaintiffs in Murphy challenged the constitutionality of the “host site” \nrequirement as it was being applied to individuals who have been sentenced to an \nindeterminate term of “three years to life” on MSR. Such individuals face the \npossibility of being imprisoned for life if they are unable to find and/or pay for \nhousing that meets the requirements imposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy \nbecause their MSR time never begins to run until they are released from prison to \nan approved host site. See 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(e).  \n  The Murphy plaintiffs identified several layers of restrictions that limit where \npeople sentenced to indeterminate MSR can live, which together make it impossible \nfor the members of the class to find host sites. Among the restrictions are the \nfollowing: \n•   Sections of the Illinois Criminal Code which make it a crime for any \nindividual classified as a “child sex offender” to live within 500 feet of a \nschool, playground, or daycare (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10));  \n \n•   Sections of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections which prohibit persons \nrequired to register as sex offenders from living “near” “parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places \nwhere minor children congregate without advance approval of an agent of \nthe Department of Corrections” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)); \n \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 14 of 30 PageID #:114\n•   The One-Per-Address Statute, which requires individuals on MSR for sex \noffenses to “refrain from residing at the same address or in the same \ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender” unless residing at a \n“licensed transitional housing facility for sex offenders,” a facility \n“operated or licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services \nor by the Department of Human Services,” or a “licensed medical facility” \n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6));  \n \n•   Housing restrictions imposed purely as a matter of IDOC policy, including \nprohibiting living in a host site where children visit or reside (including \nthe parolee’s own children), where there are computers or Wi-Fi access, \nand/or where there is no land-line telephone;  \n \n•   The unavailability of half-way houses, transitional housing, homeless \nshelters or other free or low-cost housing for indigent parolees; and \n \n•   The IDOC’s interpretation of the One-Per-Address Statute as prohibiting \na sex offender parolee from living in a building adjacent to a building \nwhere another registrant lives and/or from living in the same trailer park \nas another registrant. \n \n  On April 5, 2018, Murphy was certified as a class action on behalf of “all \nindividuals sentenced to serve three-years-to-life on MSR currently detained in the \nIDOC who have been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been \ndenied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved \nhost site.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 63. The named Plaintiffs are all \nmembers of the Murphy class.  \n  On March 31, 2019, this Court granted the Murphy plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgement on their claim that the State’s statutory and regulatory \nscheme violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment. Murphy \nv. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 132; Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. \n2019). The Court’s summary judgment decision did not single out a particular \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 15 of 30 PageID #:115\nIllinois law or IDOC policy that violated the constitution. Rather, the Court held \nthat the State’s “statutory and regulatory scheme” as a whole (i.e., the overlapping \nrestrictions imposed by Illinois law, the IDOC’s interpretation of the law, and the \nIDOC’s policies) violates the Murphy class’s constitutional rights.  \n  On January 15, 2020, the Court entered a permanent injunction requiring the \nIDOC to put forth a plan “setting forth the specific steps [the Defendants] will take \nto ensure that by no later than January 2, 2021, no member of the class will remain \nimprisoned due to an inability to comply with the host site requirement.” Murphy v. \nRaoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. The IDOC filed its compliance plan on February \n27, 2020. 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. The permanent injunction also calls for the \nIDOC to provide the Court with periodic status reports concerning its \nimplementation of the compliance plan and its progress towards meeting the \nJanuary 2, 2021 compliance deadline. 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. \n  The IDOC’s compliance plan includes several worthwhile proposals, including \nchanges to IDOC interpretation of statutory restrictions (e.g., not applying the One-\nPer-Address Statute to trailer parks and adjacent buildings); changes to restrictive \nIDOC policies (e.g., allowing individuals to reside at addresses with Wi-Fi, \nrelaxation of the land-line requirement); and contracting with private vendors to \nprovide transitional housing. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. The plan \nalso notes that “[t]here are many statutory provisions that impede the Department’s \nability to approve prospective host sites for sex offenders” states that the \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 16 of 30 PageID #:116\nDepartment and “hopes that some of the statutory impediments to identifying host \nsites can be reduced or eliminated through legislative change.”  Id. at 3-4. \n  At the time of this filing, the Murphy class comprises 317 individuals who \nremain in prison beyond the completion of their court-ordered sentence of \nimprisonment, some for as long as nine years past their MSR date, due to an \ninability to meet the host site requirement. \nIII.  The Challenged Statute \n  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). The sole mechanism through which the \nOne-Per-Address Statue is enforced is through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of \nparolees’ proposed host sites. That is, it is not a criminal offense for an individual on \nMSR for a sex offense to live at the same address as another registrant, and local \npolice departments and states attorneys play no role in enforcement of the statute.6 \n  The One-Per-Address Statute went into effect on July 11, 2005. Prior to that \ndate, individuals on MSR for sex offenses were permitted to live in the same \nresidence as other registrants. On information and belief, the One-Per-Address \nStatute is a major cause, if not the single largest cause, of the continued \nimprisonment of members of the Murphy class. This is so because other statutes \n(e.g., the 500-foot rules) already strictly circumscribe the areas where individuals \nconvicted of sex offenses may live, and the One-Per-Address Statute makes it so \n                                                        \n6   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 17 of 30 PageID #:117\nonly one parolee can live at each compliant property, even if it is a large apartment \ncomplex with many units.  \n  There is no reason to conclude that people who have been convicted of sex \noffenses’ living near one another contributes to criminality. At least one analysis \nfound that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re-offense and \nimproves supervision. A Minnesota Department of Corrections report concluded as \nfollows:  \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative \neffect related to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In \nfact, supervision agents in both Hennepin and Ramsey County have noted \nbenefits from having more than one level three offender living in one \nlocation. Closer supervision is possible because travel time between \noffenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who live with other level \nthree offenders experience more visits from a supervising agent because \nagents for both offenders visit the same property. Finally, offenders tend \nto inform on each other when supervision restrictions are violated or \ncrimes are committed.7  \n \n  There is no logical reason to believe that there is a compelling public safety need \nto prohibit people on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same address as one \nanother. In the Murphy litigation, the IDOC did not come forth with any safety or \nrehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute. In acknowledgement of \nthe restriction’s excessiveness, IDOC has already reinterpreted the restriction so as \nnot to apply to trailer parks or adjacent apartment buildings. Murphy v.

Health Risks of Detention in IDOC Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n  We are in the midst of a world-wide health crisis caused by the rapid spread of \ncoronavirus and COVID-19. The number of known COVID-19 infections is rising at \nan alarming rate. As of April 27, 2020, there have been more than 3 million \ninfections globally8; and Illinois alone has nearly 46,000 known cases.9 More than \n210,000 people have died.10 The risks to the health of individuals detained in close \nproximity to one another in prisons—as well as the staff, attorneys, medical \nprofessionals, and clergy who visit and work in these prisons—cannot be overstated. \nCOVID-19 is highly contagious between people who are in close contact with one \nanother.11  The virus is transmissible through coughing, sneezing, and contact with \nsurfaces.12 Experts advise that “talking” and “normal breathing” also likely \ntransmit the disease.13 The CDC urges social distancing—i.e., every person should \nremain at least six feet away from every other person—to avoid transmission of the \n                                                        \n8  Johns Hopkins University, Coronavirus Resource Center,  \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html (last visited April 27, 2020). \n \n9   Illinois Department of Public Health, Corona Virus Response, \nhttps://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19 (last visited April 27, 2020). \n \n10   See note 8, supra. \n \n11   “How COVID-19 Spreads,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html)  \n \n12   Id. \n \n13    “Experts tell White House coronavirus can spread through talking or even just \nbreathing, CNN, April 2, 2020 (available at: \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/health/aerosol-coronavirus-spread-white-house-\nletter/index.html)  \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 19 of 30 PageID #:119\ndisease.14 Social distancing is of paramount importance because even entirely \nasymptomatic persons can be infected with COVID-19 and unknowingly transmit it \nto others.15 Proper sanitation measures, including frequent hand washing and \nfrequent cleaning of surfaces with approved disinfectants, are also recommended.16 \nGovernor Pritzker has issued a state-wide “stay at home” order to slow the disease’s \nspread.17  \n  None of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 are \npossible for persons confined in prisons and those who must interact with them. \nSuch individuals live in close quarters to one another where proper social distancing \ncannot be maintained. Illinois officials have publicly acknowledged the severe risk \nCOVID-19 poses to those detained in IDOC and the impossibility of proper \nmitigation measures in correctional facilities.

However, that can’t always be \npossible given the constraints of space. \n \n  At Stateville Correctional Center, 122 prisoners have been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19. There are confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 15 IDOC facilities to date.19  \nARGUMENT \nI. Preliminary Injunction Standard \n  To be entitled to a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish four \nelements: (1) some likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the lack of an adequate \nremedy at law; (3) a likelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm if the \ninjunction is not granted; and (4) the balance of hardships tips in the moving party’s \nfavor. Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001). \n  As shown below, Plaintiffs meet each element for establishing an entitlement to \ninjunctive relief, and accordingly this Court should issue a preliminary injunction to \nhalt enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n   \n                                                        \n19    “COVID-19 Response,” Illinois Dept. of Corrections,  \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx (last visited April 29, \n2020). \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 21 of 30 PageID #:121\nII. Plaintiffs Have a Likelihood of Success on their Claims that Continued \nEnforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute Violates the U.S. \nConstitution   \n \n  There are two ways in which the continued enforcement of the One-Per-Address \nStatute violates the constitutional rights of the named Plaintiffs and others \nsimilarly situated. First, as this Court observed in its decision in Murphy, the \ncontinued imprisonment of individuals who do not have the money or outside \nsupport to comply with the host site requirement violates the Eighth Amendment \nand the Equal Protection Clause because it “discriminates against the plaintiffs \nbecause of their poverty.” Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at 755. Second, the continued \nincarceration of the Plaintiffs unnecessarily exposes them to an unreasonable risk \nof exposure to COVID-19 in violation of their right to “reasonable safety” while \nincarcerated under the Eighth Amendment. Plaintiffs address each in turn below. \nA. Continued Enforcement of the One-Per-Address Rule Violates the \nEighth Amendment and Equal Protection Clause  \n \n  As explained in §§I and II of the Factual Background above, all of the named \nPlaintiffs are entitled to release from prison onto MSR in the community. This \nCourt has already found that it is a violation of the constitution to keep individuals \nwho have completed their court-ordered terms of incarceration in prison simply \nbecause they cannot meet the “host site” requirement due to their “indigence and \nlack of support.” Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019).  \n  In particular, this Court held that the continued imprisonment of the Plaintiffs \nconstitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and a \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause because it is solely “the consequence of [the \n  21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 22 of 30 PageID #:122\nplaintiffs’] indigency, homelessness, and the attendant powerlessness to procure \nhousing that will satisfy the IDOC.” Id. at 756. The IDOC is under a permanent \ninjunction which requires it to release the members of the Murphy class. Murphy v. \nRaoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. Significantly, over the course of the Murphy \nlitigation, which has been ongoing for four years and generated hundreds of pages of \nsummary judgment briefing, the IDOC never put forth a public safety or \nrehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n  On April 8, 2020, this Court granted an injunction prohibiting enforcement of \nthe One-Per-Address Statute as to Marcus Barnes, another member of the Murphy \nclass who had a suitable place to live but for the One-Per-Address rule. This Court \nwrote as follows: \nPlaintiff has found a place to live that will be supportive of his transfer back \ninto the community. … Another sex offender resides in the building already \nand therefore Defendants will not permit him to reside there. Plaintiff is \nclearly suffering a constitutional harm each day he is detained past his \nrelease date (which is now nearly a year and a half) and that harm can only \nbe remedied by release. In response to the question about what penological \nor rehabilitative support the Defendants have for the “One Person One \nAddress”  provision,  Defendants  were  unable  to  give  any.  The  public’s \ninterest  in  only  hav[ing]  one  sex  offender  live  at  one  residence  is not \nsupported by any testimony, expert opinion, or evidence. Therefore, the \nCourt finds that the statute is unconstitutional as it applies to Plaintiff and \nDefendants  are  enjoined  from  prohibiting  his  release  to  the  address \npresented by Plaintiff. \n \nECF No. 11.  \n  The same result should occur here. Each of the Plaintiffs has a safe host site at \nwhich to live outside of prison. The host sites Plaintiffs wish to be released to will be \nsupportive of their reintegration into the community and meet every requirement \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 23 of 30 PageID #:123\nimposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy, save the One-Per-Address Statute. In the \nabsence of a legitimate justification for the prohibition on more than one parolee’s \nliving at a particular address, the continued application of the One-Per-Address \nStatute to Plaintiffs violates their constitutional rights for all of the reasons the \nCourt recognized in Murphy. \nB. Continued Imprisonment of Individuals Who Are Entitled to Release \nDuring the COVID-19 Pandemic Constitutes Deliberate Indifference  \n   \n  The Eighth Amendment mandates that persons confined in prisons must “be \nfurnished with the basic human needs, one of which is ‘reasonable safety.’” Helling \nv. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 (1993) (citing DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. \nof Soc. Serv., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989)). In Helling, the Supreme Court held that a \nprisoner stated an Eighth Amendment claim that he was exposed to unsafe levels of \nenvironmental tobacco smoke even though he personally experienced no adverse \nhealth effects because the health risk posed by involuntary exposure to second-hand \nsmoke is “sufficiently imminent.” Id. at 509 U.S. at 35.  \n  Courts have consistently interpreted Helling to authorize an Eighth Amendment \ncause of action when an inmate is exposed to a risk of contracting contagious \ndiseases. See Loftin v. Dalessandri, 3 F. App’x 658, 662-63 (10th Cir. 2001) (inmate \nstated an Eighth Amendment violation where he alleged he was housed in a cell \nwith two cellmates who had tuberculosis); DeGidio v. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 533 (8th \nCir. 1990) (failure by prison officials to prevent the unchecked spread of \ntuberculosis violated the Eighth Amendment). Indeed, in Helling itself, the \nSupreme Court approvingly cited Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974), in \n  23 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 24 of 30 PageID #:124\nwhich the court held that inmates were entitled to relief under the Eighth \nAmendment when they proved threats to their personal safety from “the mingling of \ninmates with serious contagious diseases with other prison inmates.” Helling, 506 \nU.S. at 34. \n  The Seventh Circuit has similarly recognized that the Eighth Amendment \nprotects prisoners from known exposure to serious diseases, holding that in such a \ncircumstance, “[t]he prison must be allowed to choose between removing the \nprisoner from the unhealthy environment and protecting him from its consequences \n. . . provided, of course, that the protection is efficacious.” Powers v. Snyder, 484 \nF.3d 929, 931 (7th Cir. 2007); see also McDonald v. Hardy, 821 F.3d 882, 889 (7th \nCir. 2016) (explaining that the Eighth Amendment does not excuse deliberate \nindifference simply because harms “have not yet reached the point of causing acute \nor life-threatening injuries”). \n  To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim, a plaintiff must show that the \ndefendant has acted with “deliberate indifference.” Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d \n469, 478 (7th Cir. 2005). That standard is met when the plaintiff establishes that he \nhas been exposed to an “objectively serious” risk of harm and defendant acted with \n“conscious disregard of known or obvious dangers” to the plaintiff. Id. (citing \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)). Both components of the deliberate \nindifference standard are met here. \n  First, imprisonment during the COVID-19 pandemic exposes plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated to a known and objectively serious risk of harm. As \n  24 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 25 of 30 PageID #:125\noutlined in §IV of the Factual Background above, imprisoned individuals are at a \nparticularly high risk of contracting COVID-19. COVID-19 cases are skyrocketing in \nIllinois. At the time the initial complaint was filed in this case on April 5, 2020, \nIllinois had fewer than 9,000 cases. ECF No. 1 at ¶36. Three weeks later, Illinois \nhas more than 48,000 confirmed cases.20 Likewise, infections in IDOC facilities \ncontinue to rise. At the time the initial complaint was filed, 56 IDOC inmates had \ntested positive. ECF No. 1 at 46. Now, that number is 155. 21 For an individual such \nas Plaintiff John Margarella, who has serious pre-existing health conditions, \nincluding two recent heart attacks, the risk of life threatening illness if exposed to \nCOVID-19 is elevated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n“[p]eople who have serious heart conditions” are “at high-risk for severe illness from \nCOVID-19.”22  \n  Second, IDOC is acting in conscious disregard of these known dangers by \nkeeping Plaintiffs in prison during the pandemic when they have safe places to go \nin the community. It cannot be disputed that the IDOC is aware of the grave risk \nthat the coronavirus poses to imprisoned individuals. As explained in §IV of the \nFactual Background above, the top public health official of the State of Illinois has \npublicly acknowledged the risk that COVID-19 poses to prisoners and the \n                                                        \n20   See COVID-19 Homepage, Illinois Department of Public Health, \nhttp://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19 \n \n21  https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx  \n \n22   “People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness,” Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-\nhigher-risk.html \n  25 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 26 of 30 PageID #:126\nimpossibility of proper mitigation measures in an institutional setting. Moreover, \nthe IDOC knows that Plaintiffs are constitutionally entitled to be released. This \nCourt’s permanent injunction requires IDOC to release the members of the Murphy \nclass. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. Under these circumstances, \ncontinued enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute constitutes deliberate \nindifference to Plaintiff’s right to “reasonable safety.” Plaintiffs could be living in \nsafe places outside of prison where they would be able to comply with the statewide \nStay-at-Home order and observe other recommended disease mitigation measures. \nTo expose Plaintiffs and others who have completed their sentences and have \nhousing outside of prison to the unmitigated risk of contracting COVID-19 falls \nshort of the Eighth Amendment’s mandates. \nIII.  Plaintiffs and Others Similarly Situated are Suffering and Will \nContinue to Suffer Irreparable Injury in the Absence of an Injunction  \n \n  If an injunction is not granted, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated will suffer \ntwo forms of irreparable injury. One, they will continue to be imprisoned in \nviolation of their constitutional right to be released from prison on MSR. And two, \nthey will continue to be exposed to an unreasonable risk of being infected with \nCOVID-19. Such harms unquestionably constitute irreparable injury. Aguilar v. \nGaston-Camara, 861 F.3d 626, 631 (7th Cir. 2017) (“additional incarceration \nwithout penological justification” violates the Eighth Amendment); Hampton v. \nLeibach, 99 C 5473, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20983, at *5-6 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2001) (a \nplaintiff “suffers irreparable harm each day that he is imprisoned in violation of the \nUnited States Constitution.”); Harris v. Board of Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 766 \n  26 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 27 of 30 PageID #:127\n(9th Cir. 2004) (accepting “pain,” “infection,” and “medical complications” as forms \nof irreparable harm warranting injunctive relief). \n  Moreover, it is well established that when a plaintiff establishes a likelihood of \nsuccess on a claim that a government action violates his constitutional rights, he \nmeets the element of showing irreparable harm. Ezell v. City of Chi., 651 F.3d 684, \n699 (7th Cir. 2011) (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is \ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is \nnecessary.”) (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \n§ 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)); Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978) \n(“The existence of a continuing constitutional violation constitutes proof of an \nirreparable harm.”).  \nIV.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor Granting Relief \n \n  The public interest also favors the granting of the requested relief. First, there is \nno public safety justification for refusing to release Plaintiffs to NewDay \nApartments or Wayside Cross Ministries. IDOC has leased the housing units at \nNewDay for the specific purpose of fostering transition back into the community for \nmembers of the Murphy class. NewDay Apartments considers its primary mission \nto be “to keep communities safe by housing registrants responsibly.” Ex. 1, Decl. of \nMcKelvey at ¶7. To date, NewDay has a zero percent recidivism rate among its \nregistrant tenants and notes that “it is our experience that housing registrants at \nthe same address allows for more effective (and cost-effective) law enforcement \noversight.” Id. \n  27 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 28 of 30 PageID #:128\n  Similarly, Wayside Cross Ministries has nearly 100 years of experience helping \nindividuals just like the Plaintiffs reintegrate into society through its highly \nstructured faith-based programming. Kane County State’s Attorney Joe McMahon \nhas lauded Wayside’s long track record of success with individuals who have been \nconvicted of sex offenses, stating, “The work that they’ve done there at the Mission \nhas been remarkable for decades.”23  \n  Thus, Wayside Cross and NewDay Apartments are precisely the type of \nrehabilitative settings to which IDOC should be releasing Murphy class members. \nMoreover, both of these housing options are available at no additional cost to the \nState of Illinois, which is currently paying tens of thousands of dollars a year to \nkeep the Plaintiffs in prison beyond their release dates.24 \n  Likewise, there is no public safety justification for refusing to allow members of \nthe proposed class such as Mr. Sparks and Mr. Huddleston to parole to host sites \nthat comply with every aspect of Illinois law except the One-Per-Address Statute. If \nan injunction is granted, Plaintiffs Huddleston and Sparks (and others similarly \nsituated) will still be required to comply with restrictions on their living within 500 \nfeet of schools, playgrounds and daycare centers, and they will still be subject to all \n                                                        \n23   See “Convicted Sex Offenders’ Ministry Housing Too Close To Playground, City Says,” \nNational Public Radio, January 15, 2020; audio recording available at: \nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796021411/convicted-sex-offenders-ministry-housing-too- \nclose-to-playground-city-says  \n \n24   See “IDOC Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Report” at 80 (In 2018, the average annual cost of \nkeeping a person incarcerated in an IDOC facility was $27,930) (available at \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/reportsandstatistics/Documents/FY18%20Annual%20Report\n%20FINAL.pdf). \n  28 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 29 of 30 PageID #:129\nof the restrictions attendant to being on MSR, including GPS monitoring, curfews, \nmandatory sex offender therapy, and restrictions on unauthorized contact with \nminors.   \n  During this pandemic, other public safety factors also strongly favor issuance of \nan injunction that will allow Plaintiffs and others to be released to safe host sites \noutside of prison. Other persons imprisoned in IDOC who cannot be released at \npresent are endangered by overcrowding, which increases the risk of disease \ntransmission; and the public at large is put at risk if medical resources are \noverwhelmed by the hospitalization of imprisoned people in downstate communities \nwith few hospital beds.  \n  Finally, the public has a strong interest in protecting constitutional rights that \nwould be well served by granting injunctive relief here. See ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 \nF.3d 583, 589-90 (7th Cir. 2012) (“[T]he public interest is not harmed by \npreliminarily enjoining the enforcement of a statute that is probably \nunconstitutional.”)  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nHonorable Court enter a preliminary injunction granting the following relief: \n•  An immediate order prohibiting enforcement of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) \n(hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute”) as to the named Plaintiffs so \nthey can be released from prison to the otherwise compliant host sites \nidentified above; and \n \n•  A preliminary injunction prohibiting the IDOC from enforcing the One-\nPer-Address Statute against individuals who have completed their court-\n  29 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 30 of 30 PageID #:130\nordered sentences of incarceration and remain in prison due to an \ninability to identify a host site that satisfies the One-Per-Address Rule.  \n \n \n                        Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Adele D.

My name is Rosemary Margarella (legally Frank J Margarella). I am the daughter of \nJohn Margarella, one of the plaintiffs who has been detained in the Illinois Department of \nCorrections beyond his release date because he can’t secure approved housing.  \n2.  My father was supposed to be released from prison in December 2013. He remains in \nprison at Dixon Correctional Center because we cannot find housing for him that the IDOC will \napprove. He has been in prison for more than six years beyond the time he was sentenced to \nserve. \n3.  We have asked IDOC to release my father to homes with every family member who \nhas the ability to offer him a place to stay. All potential placements with members of our family \nhave been rejected because we live too close to schools or playgrounds or have children \nresiding with or frequenting the residences. \n4.  No one in our family has the money to buy or rent a separate place for my father.  \n5.  My father is 57 and has had serious health issues while in the IDOC. I am very \nconcerned for his wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. He has suffered two heart attacks \nwhile imprisoned and has had stents inserted in his blood vessels. While undergoing treatment \nfor one of the heart attacks, he received medication that caused internal hemorrhaging and \nalmost died. He also has a degenerative spine disorder. I am concerned that my father is at very \nhigh risk if he is exposed to the corona virus in prison.  \n6.  We have no hope of securing my father’s release unless the IDOC gives him a place to \nstay in transitional housing or a halfway house.   \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17-4 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:138\n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n      4/29/2020 \n_____________________      ___________ \nRosemary Margarella       Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17-5 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:139\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17-5 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:140\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17-6 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:141\nDeclaration\tof\tJonathan\tEric\tJoseph\tSparks\t\n\t\nPursuant\tto\t28\tU.S.C\t§\t1746,\tI\tcertify\tunder\tpenalty\tof\tperjury\tthat\tthe\tfollowing\t\nstatements\tare\ttrue\tand\tcorrect:\t\n\t\n1.

My name is Stephen N. Goldberg.  I was formerly a member of the State Bar of Illinois \nand a member of the bar of this Court.  I am also a now-retired inactive member of the State \nBar of California and a member of the bar of various California federal district courts, the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court.  I am familiar with the facts \nstated herein and could testify about them if called as a witness. \n2.  I am the brother of Alvin Lee Goldberg, who pleaded guilty in November of 2012 to \ntwo offenses:  PRED CRIM SEX ASLT/VICTIM <13; and AGG CRIM SEX ABUSE/FAMILY.  My \nbrother will be 81 on May 14 of this year. \n3.  My brother currently is an inmate at the Taylorville Correctional Center, 1144 Illinois \nRte 29, Taylorville IL 62568. His IDOC number is M36526.  He was scheduled for release in \nNovember of 2018, subject to required mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) with a discharge \ndate of three years to life.  He is actively looking for an apartment to move to that is acceptable \nto the IDOC while he is on MSR. \n4.  I have applied on behalf of my brother to NewDay Apartments, an organization that \nrents apartments to convicted sex offenders.  I have spoken with their representatives.  The \nlatter have told me (1) that NewDay will put my brother, if he passes a background and credit \ncheck, on a waiting list for apartments it owns that currently are allowed by the IDOC only to \nhouse registered sex offenders who are no longer on parole or probation (i.e. MSR) and (2) that \nthey are precluded from renting to him in such facilities by the Illinois statute precluding more \nthan one registrant from residing at a residence housing more than one registrant. 730 ILCS \n5/5-6-3(a)(8.6). \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17-10 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:151\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 17-10 Filed: 04/30/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:152",

(Dkt. 24-2).  The \nPlaintiffs have been convicted of sex offenses and are in the custody of the Illinois \nDepartment of Corrections. (Dkt. 24-1 ¶ 1).  They challenge the constitutionality of \n730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6), which they refer to as the One-Per-Address Statute.  (Dkt. \n24-1 ¶ 2).  The statute prevents those convicted of a sex offense from “residing at the \nsame address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same \ncondominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision \nfor a sex offense.”  730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  Plaintiffs argue that enforcement of the \nstatute violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and seek an injunction \nbarring its continued enforcement.  (Dkt. 24-1 ¶ 7).   \n \n  The class that Plaintiffs propose to certify is: “All individuals who have been \nconvicted of sex offenses and completed their court-imposed sentence of incarceration \nwho cannot find housing that complies with 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) at which to \nreside while on Mandatory Supervised Release.”  (Dkt. 24-2 at 1).  Defendant does \nnot oppose certification of the class or appointment of the proposed class counsel.  \n(Dkt. 30).   \n \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 31 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:258\n  The Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion.  For the reasons set forth by Plaintiffs in \ntheir motion, which are uncontested by the Defendant, the Court concludes that the \nclass meets the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of \nRule 23, and that relief is appropriate for the class as a whole as the grounds raised \nby Plaintiffs apply generally to the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) &(b)(2); see also Orr v. \nShicker, 953 F.3d 490, 497 (7th Cir. 2020) (“Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \nrequires a plaintiff seeking class certification to satisfy all four requirements of Rule \n23(a)—numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation—and \nany one of the general categories of Rule 23(b).”). \n \n  As to numerosity, “[a] class can be certified without determination of its size, \nso long as it’s reasonable to believe it large enough to make joinder impracticable and \nthus justify a class action suit,” and “[w]hile there is no magic number that applies to \nevery  case,  a  forty–member  class  is  often  regarded  as  sufficient  to  meet  the \nnumerosity  requirement.”    Orr,  953  F.3d  at  497–98  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).  Here, Plaintiffs have already identified 36 class members and reasonably \nanticipate there will be many more.  Defendant does not contest this. The Court \nconcludes that the numerosity requirement is met. \n \n  As  to  commonality,  “Plaintiffs’  claims  ‘must  depend  upon  a  common \ncontention. . . of  such  a  nature  that it is  capable  of  classwide  resolution—which \nmeans that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to \nthe validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.’” Id. at 498 (quoting Wal-Mart \nStores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  564  U.S.  338,  350  (2011)).    The  class  seeks  a  common \ndetermination—whether they are being subjected to an unconstitutional statute.  The \nsame questions of law and fact apply across class members and the resolution of that \nissue is central to the claims of all class members.  Defendant does not contest this. \nThe Court concludes that the commonality requirement is met. \n \n  As to typicality, “Plaintiffs must show that the ‘claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.’”  Id. at 500 \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)).  As Plaintiffs state, “[e]ach named Plaintiff has a \nplace to live that would meet IDOC approval but for the One-Per-Address Statute,” \nthey are or risk being “imprisoned beyond the completion of their court-ordered term \nof incarceration unless and until they find housing that satisfies this rule,” and “the \napplication of the challenged Statute keeps them in prison in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause.”  (Dkt. 24-2 at 7).  These claims are \ntypical of the class as a whole.  Though the specific facts for each individual may \ndiffer, e.g., where they plan to reside or how long they have been incarcerated, the \nclaims all share these key similarities.  There is “enough congruence” between the \nclaims of the named Plaintiffs and the class to justify allowing the named plaintiffs \nto litigate on the class’s behalf.  Orr, 953 F.3d at 500 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Defendant does not contest this. The Court concludes that the typicality \nrequirement is met. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 31 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:259\n  As to adequacy, Plaintiffs must show that “the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  “A class \nrepresentative must be part of the class and must possess the same interest and \nsuffer the same injury as the other class members.”  Orr, 953 F.3d at 499 (internal \nquotation  marks  omitted).    Plaintiffs  set  forth  36  named  Plaintiffs  as \nrepresentatives.1  As noted above, the named Plaintiffs have suffered the same \nalleged injury as the class.  And, as the Plaintiffs raise, they have a strong personal \nstake  in  diligently  pursuing  this  litigation.    Even  if  they  are  released  from \nincarceration, they may still face reincarceration as a result of the statute, and so \ntheir personal stake continues to remain strong.  Defendant does not contest this. The \nCourt concludes that the named Plaintiffs will adequately represent the interests of \nthe class.  \n \n  The adequacy inquiry has two parts: “(1) the adequacy of the named plaintiffs \nas representatives of the proposed class’s myriad members, with their differing and \nseparate interests, and (2) the adequacy of the proposed class counsel.”  Gomez v. St. \nVincent Health, Inc., 649 F.3d 583, 592 (7th Cir. 2011).  For the reasons set forth by \nPlaintiffs  in  their  motion,  which  are  uncontested  by  the  Defendant,  the  Court \nconcludes that Adele D. Nicholas and Mark G. Weinberg are qualified under Rule \n23(g) to serve as class counsel and will fairly and adequately represent the interests \nof the class.  The Court notes in particular that counsel was appointed to represent \nthe class in a related case and did so with diligence.  See Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. \nSupp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (counsel successfully advocated on behalf of plaintiffs \nwith related claims).  Counsel has the necessary skill, experience, knowledge, and \nresources to represent the class, and has already done substantial work to develop \nthe claims at issue.  Defendant does not contest this. The Court concludes that \ncounsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion for \nClass Certification and for Appointment of Class Counsel. \n   \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \n              Virginia M.

Kendall \nROB JEFFREYS, \n)   \n \n)    \n              Defendant. \n) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nApproximately  1,200  inmates  imprisoned  in  the  Illinois  Department  of \nCorrections  (“IDOC”)  who  have  completed  their  court-ordered  sentences  of \nincarceration  and  are  entitled  to  release  to  a  community  setting  on  mandatory \nsupervised release (“MSR”) remain in prison because they are unable to secure an \napproved “host site” to live while on mandatory supervised release.  Title 730 ILCS \n5/3-3-7(a)(7.6), a section of the Illinois Uniform Code of Corrections, prohibits an \nindividual on mandatory supervised release for a sex offense from living “at the same \naddress  or  in  the  same  condominium  unit  or  apartment  unit  or  in  the  same \ncondominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision \nfor a sex offense.” (hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute”).   \nPlaintiff Marcus Barnes was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for criminal \nsexual assault in 2008.  Upon completing his sentence, Barnes was entitled to start \n1 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 2 of 27 PageID #:616\nhis  term  of  mandatory  supervised  release  (“MSR”),  a  form  of  post-confinement \nmonitoring intended to assist individuals transition from prison to liberty.  Under the \n“One-Per-Address Statute” convicted sex offenders on MSR may not live in the same \nbuilding as another registered sex offender.  Because he was unable to secure housing \nwhich complied with the One-Per-Address Statute, Barnes spent an additional 18 \nmonths imprisoned at the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”). \nBarnes,  and  a  class  of  similarly  situated  plaintiffs,  challenges  the \nconstitutionality  of  the  One-Per-Address  Statute  on  Eighth  Amendment  and \nFourteenth Amendment grounds.  In Murphy et al. v. Raoul et al., No. 1:16-cv-\n11471—a  related  case  brought by  the  narrower  class  of  convicted  sex  offenders \nsentenced to an indeterminate term of MSR—this Court identified a protectable \nliberty interest in release from prison onto MSR once eligible and awarded the class \nsummary judgment as to their Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment \nequal protection claims. \nPlaintiffs in the present suit move for summary judgment on all their claims \nagainst Defendant Robert Jeffreys, Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections \n(“IDOC”).  For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. \n32)  is  granted  as  to  both  their  Eighth  Amendment  (Count  I)  and  Fourteenth \nAmendment equal protection claims (Count II) but denied as to their Fourteenth \nAmendment substantive due process claim. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 3 of 27 PageID #:617\nBACKGROUND \nI.  The One-Per-Address Statute \nIn Illinois, almost every criminal sentence includes a period of MSR following \nthe term of imprisonment.  See 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-15(c).  Authority over MSR is vested \nin both the IDOC and the Prisoner Review Board (“PRB”).  See Cordrey v. Prisoner \nReview Bd., 21 N.E.3d 423, 428 (Ill. 2014).  Broadly, the PRB is responsible for setting \nthe conditions of MSR, but the IDOC assists inmates locating a suitable “host site” \nfor residential placement.  See id. at 430. \nThe One-Per-Address Statute precludes convicted sex offenders on MSR from \nliving “at the same address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit in \nthe same condominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she \nknows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on \nsupervision for a sex offense[.]”  730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  The One-Per-Address \nStatute is a mandatory condition, meaning neither the IDOC nor the PRB has the \ndiscretion to impose the condition.  730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  Until April 7, 2020, the \nIDOC interpreted the One-Per-Address Statute to prohibit sex offenders on MSR \nfrom living in the same trailer parks as other sex offenders or from living in adjacent \napartment buildings.  Id.  (Dkt. 50 ¶ 2).  When evaluating proposed host sites, a \nparole agent verifies compliance with the One-Per-Address Statute.  (Dkt. 50 ¶ 1).  If \na host site is denied, the offender is notified in writing of the reason for the denial \nand afforded the opportunity to file a grievance.  (Dkt. 50 ¶ 3).  Sex offenders on MSR \nmust register with the local police department and, in the past, local registering \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 4 of 27 PageID #:618\nagencies have occasionally refused to register sex offenders at sites which violate the \nOne-Per-Address Statute or rearrested them for living at such locations.  (Dkt. 50 \n¶¶ 7–8, 10).  Once a host site is approved and the sex offender moves in, a parole \nagent conducts monthly checks to ensure the host site remains compliant with the \nOne-Per-Address Statute.  (Dkt. 50 ¶ 5).  If the parole agent determines the host site \nviolates the One-Per-Address Statute, he provides the sex offender written notice of \nthe need to find a new host site.  (Dkt. 50 ¶ 6).  The IDOC will only reincarcerate a \nsex offender for a violation of the One-Per-Address Statute to keep local authorities \nfrom arresting the offender on the new charge of failure to register.  (Dkt. 50 ¶ 12). \nWhen questioned at his deposition in Murphy as to the basis of the IDOC’s \nprevious application of the One-Per-Address Statute to trailer parks, Dion Dixon, the \nIDOC’s Deputy Chief of Parole, did not reference any safety or rehabilitative purpose.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶ 1).  Instead, Dixon said registering entities and the state police understood \nthe One-Per-Address Statute to prohibit a sex offender on MSR from living in the \nsame trailer park as another registrant.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 1; Dkt. 49 ¶ 1; Dkt. 34-6 at 3–5).  \nBecause allowing sex offenders on MSR to live in the same trailer park as another \nregistrant might prove counterproductive or result in reincarceration, the IDOC \nsimilarly refused to permit such placements.  (Dkt. 49 ¶ 1; Dkt. 34-6 at 6).  Subject to \nthe permanent injunction ordered in Murphy, the IDOC altered the way it interprets \nthe One-Per-Address Statute.  No. 16-cv-11471, Dkt. 161.   \nA study produced by the Minnesota Department of Corrections examined the \nimpact  of  permitting  convicted  sex  offenders  to  live  “in  close  proximity  to  one \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 5 of 27 PageID #:619\nanother.”  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 2).  The report found no negative effects from such close living \nand, instead, identified a handful of benefits.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 2).  For example, the reduced \ntravel time between offenders affords closer supervision of registrants, more visits \nper registrant, and registrants tend to inform on one another for restriction violations \nor crimes.  (Dkt. 32 ¶ 2).  These findings are consistent with the deposition testimony \nof Bob McKelvey, the founder of NewDay Apartments.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 7). \nII.  Other Restrictions \nSeparate  and  apart  from  the  One-Per-Address  Statute,  host  sites  for  sex \noffenders on MSR are subject to myriad other restrictions.  For example, it is a crime \nfor child sex offenders to “knowingly reside within 500 feet of a school building” or \n“playground, child care institution, day care center, party day child care facility, day \ncare  home,  group  day  care  home,  or  a  facility  providing  programs  or  services \nexclusively directed towards [children].”  720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(b.5), (b.10).  Registered \nsex offenders are further restricted from living “near . . . parks, schools, day care \ncenters, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places where minor children \ncongregate” without preapproval by the IDOC.  730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12).  Finally, \nuntil April 7, 2020, IDOC policy would not approve a host site with computers, \nrouters, wi-fi access, smart TVs or other internet-related devices, where children lived \nor resided, or without a land-line telephone.  Murphy, No. 16-cv-11471, Dkt. 161. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 6 of 27 PageID #:620\nIII.  Housing Availability \nA.  NewDay Apartments \nNewDay Apartments (“NewDay”), located in Lake County, Illinois, specializes \nin providing compliant housing to registered sex offenders.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 3).  Bob \nMcKelvey,  the  founder  of  NewDay,  views  its  primary  purpose  as  keeping \n“communities safe by housing registrants responsibly.”  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 12).  NewDay has \na 0% recidivism rate among its registrant tenants.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 12). \nNewDay  currently  owns  eight  properties  which  comply  with  the  various \nstatutory prohibitions on sex offender host sites and has plans to expand its holdings \nover the next three years.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 4, 11).  NewDay contracts with the IDOC to \nmake four of these properties available to house indigent members of the Murphy \nclass otherwise unable to procure housing.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 4).  Prior to the Court’s Order \ngranting preliminary injunctive relief in Murphy, NewDay was limited to housing a \nsingle registrant per location.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 5).  NewDay also owns multi-unit properties \nwhich, under the One-Per-Address Statute, are limited to registrants off MSR.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶ 12).  Permitting multiple registrants on MSR would “easily double” the number \nof units NewDay could offer and would make the housing more affordable.  (Dkt. 33 \n¶ 12).  Several registrants have been released to NewDay on preliminary injunction.  \n(Dkt. 68). \nB.  Wayside Cross Ministries \nWayside Cross Ministries (“Wayside”), located at 215 E. New York Street, \nAurora,  Illinois,  is  a  “Bible-based  residential  program”  with  over  90  years  of \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 7 of 27 PageID #:621\nexperience.    (Dkt.  33  ¶ 13).    Its  Master’s  Touch  Ministry  program  targets  men \nstruggling  with  drug  and  alcohol  addiction  and  transitioning  after  a  period  of \nincarceration for sex offenses.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 13).  The program takes a minimum of seven \nmonths to complete and is highly structured with a strict code of conduct.  (Dkt. 33 \n¶¶ 15–16).    Program  participants  are  subject  to  a  curfew,  required  to  attend \nscheduled Bible study and church services, prohibited from using drugs or alcohol, \nnot allowed to use profane or abusive language, limited to listening to music that \nglorifies God, and only allowed to use technology in “a manner that conforms to God’s \nhigh standards.”  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 16).  Participants may only complete the program by \nsuccessfully completing random drug and alcohol tests, actively participating in \nprogramming, and adhering to the program’s rules.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 16). \nProgram participants live together in a dormitory and are provided free room \nand board.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 17–18).  The Master’s Touch Ministry program is willing to \naccept registrants on MSR from the IDOC and several have been admitted to the \nprogram on preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 33 ¶ 19). \nC.  Pastor James Cockrell \nJames  Cockrell,  a  pastor  with  Abundant  Faith  Ministries  in  Springfield, \nIllinois, with experience ministering to convicted sex offenders imprisoned in the \nIDOC, owns and oversees a house at 1611 E. Matheny Avenue, Springfield, Illinois.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 20–21).  Cockrell intends to provide housing and supportive services to, \namong others, convicted sex offenders.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 21).  Cockrell will offer one month \nrent-free and help finding employment and housing.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 22–23).  Cockrell \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 8 of 27 PageID #:622\nhas a relationship with a local employer open to hiring convicted sex offenders and \nwhich will provide a shuttle service to residence to and from work.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 22).  \nCockrell is willing to accept convicted sex offenders on MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 25). \nD.  New Beginnings Recovery Homes, Inc. \nNew Beginnings Recovery Homes, Inc. (“New Beginnings”) is a not-for-profit \nthat provides affordable shared transitional housing and case management services \nto those newly released from prison.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 27–28).  New Beginnings targets \nthose  experiencing  housing  or  food  insecurity,  lacking  gainful  employment,  or \nrecovering from drug or alcohol addiction and has significant experience helping \nconvicted sex offenders successfully transition back into the community.  (Dkt. 33 \n¶¶ 28, 31).  New Beginnings has five buildings on the south side of Chicago compliant \nwith housing restrictions applicable to convicted sex offenders where residents live in \na  dormitory  or  semi-private  shared  living  setting.    (Dkt.  33  ¶¶ 29–30).    New \nBeginnings residents receive meals and have access to services such as peer support \ngroups, counseling with licensed providers, case management, and 24-hour security.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 29, 31).  Residents must adhere to New Beginning’s rules, which include \na  curfew,  abstinence  from  drugs  and  alcohol,  and  no  minors  or  women  on  the \npremises.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 32).  New Beginnings is willing to accept registrants on MSR \nfrom the IDOC and several have been released to New Beginnings on preliminary \ninjunction.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 34; Dkt. 52; Dkt. 60; Dkt. 64). \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 9 of 27 PageID #:623\nIV.  Class Members \nA.  Luis Aponte \nLuis Aponte was released from the IDOC on MSR in January 2020 to his \nfather’s home in a four-story apartment building with approximately 12 units.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶ 45).  Aponte is doing well on MSR and has a full-time job in a warehouse and \nhas been regularly attending his required sex offender therapy.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 47).  In \nMarch 2020, another registrant off MSR moved into a different unit in the same \nbuilding where Aponte’s father lives.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 48).  Aponte’s parole agent notified \nhim that, because the One-Per-Address Statute prohibits him from living in the same \nbuilding as another registrant, he needed to find another host site or return to prison.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶ 48).  Aponte has not been able to find alternate living accommodations and \nwishes to continue living with his father.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 49). \nB.  Marcus Barnes \nMarcus Barnes completed his prison sentence on December 17, 2018, at which \npoint he was approved for release on MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 35).  Barnes’s family identified \n11 potential host sites, all of which were rejected for various reasons by the IDOC.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶ 35).  Among the potential host sites was a building owned by Jordan’s \nDream, which provides transitional housing and supportive services to convicted sex \noffenders.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 36).  The IDOC rejected this site under the One-Per-Address \nStatute because another registrant lived there.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 37).  Barnes spent more \nthan 18 months of “dead time” in prison after the completion of his sentence of \nincarceration because of his inability to find an acceptable host site.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 35).  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 10 of 27 PageID #:624\nBarnes was released to Jordan’s Dream on April 14, 2020, on preliminary injunction.  \n(Dkt. 11). \nC.  Fredrick Chamblis \nFredrick  Chamblis  was  convicted  of  criminal  sexual  assault  in  2012  and \nsentenced to four years’ imprisonment and three-years-to-life of MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 61).  \nChamblis completed his sentence of incarceration on January 22, 2016, at which point \nhe was eligible for release on MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 61).  Chamblis could not afford \nindependent housing and the IDOC rejected all potential residences with family \nmembers as host sites and, therefore, Chamblis was not released from the IDOC at \nthat time.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 61).  Chamblis was released on preliminary injunction to \nWayside Cross Ministries on May 19, 2020, more than four years after he became \neligible for MSR.  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 33 ¶ 62). \nD.  Corey Crowe \nCorey Crowe was convicted of criminal sexual assault in 2013 and sentenced \nto six years’ imprisonment followed by three-years-to-life of MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 64).  \nCrowe became eligible for MSR on June 5, 2018, but remained imprisoned for almost \ntwo years due to his inability to find or afford a suitable host site.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 65).  \nCrow was released to Wayside Cross Ministries on May 19, 2020, on preliminary \ninjunction.  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 65–66). \nE.  Jerry Davis \nJerry Davis was convicted of criminal sexual assault in 2006 and sentenced to \nfour years’ imprisonment followed by thee-years-to-life MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 67).  Davis \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 11 of 27 PageID #:625\nbecame eligible for MSR on December 30, 2008, but was not released at this point \nbecause he was unable to locate a host site.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 67).  In June 2016, Davis was \nreleased to Hand-n-Hand Outreach, a transitional housing provider, where he lived \nfor a year and a half.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 68).  While on MSR, Davis was employed and was \nenrolled in school.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 68).  When Davis lost his placement at Hand-n-Hand \nin November 2017, he was returned to prison where he remained until he was \nreleased to NewDay in December 2019.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 68).  Davis is employed in a \nwarehouse and seeking independent housing.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 69).  In total, Davis served \nten years of “dead time.”  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 68). \nF.  Ronald Garrison \nRonald Garrison was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault in 2009 \nand sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment followed by three years of MSR.  (Dkt. 33 \n¶ 73).  Garrison completed his prison sentence on March 6, 2019, at which point he \nbecame eligible for MSR but remained imprisoned because he was unable to secure a \nhost site.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 73).  With financial assistance from his mother and a friend, \nGarrison was released to New Beginnings on June 12, 2020, after serving 15 months’ \n“dead time.”  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 73). \nG.  Alvin Goldberg \nAlvin  Goldberg  is  81-years-old  and  currently  incarcerated  at  Taylorville \nCorrectional Center.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 8).  Although he completed his prison sentence on \nNovember 11, 2018, at which point he became eligible for MSR, he has been unable \nto secure an appropriate host site and remains imprisoned.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 8).  Goldberg \n11 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 12 of 27 PageID #:626\nis able to pay for an apartment at NewDay and is on the waiting list for a unit.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶ 10).  Goldberg has spent more than 18 months of “dead time” in prison.  (Dkt. 33 \n¶ 9). \nH.  Joshua Huddleston \nJoshua Huddleston was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault in 2013 \nand sentenced to six years’ imprisonment followed by three-years-to-life MSR.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶ 70).  Huddleston completed his prison sentence on January 22, 2019, at which \npoint he became entitled to MSR but remained imprisoned because he was unable to \nsecure a host site.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 70).  While Huddleston is financially able to afford \nhousing, he does not have family who could either offer him accommodations or assist \nhim finding housing and he was unable to search for housing, sign a lease, or set up \nutilities  while  imprisoned.    (Dkt.  33  ¶ 71).    Huddleston  was  released  to  New \nBeginnings on June 8, 2020, after spending 16 months “dead time” in prison.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶¶ 71–72). \nI.  J.D. Lindenmeier and Stanley Meyer \nJ.D. Lindenmeier and Stanley Meyer are convicted sex offenders on MSR who \nwish  to  rent  an  apartment  together  once  they  secure  jobs.    (Dkt.  33  ¶ 42).  \nLindenmeier and Meyer wish to share living expenses such as rent and utilities.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶ 42).  Meyer would have trouble affording an apartment on his own.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶ 43). \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 13 of 27 PageID #:627\nJ.  Kevin Manson \nKevin Manson was released on MSR on May 6, 2020, to live with his aunt.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 50–51).  The IDOC rescinded its approval of Manson’s aunt’s house as a \nhost site based on its proximity to a school.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 51).  Because Manson was \nunable to pay for housing on his own, The Cook County Justice Advisory Council \nassisted  him  with  financing  housing  at  New  Beginnings  to  which  Manson  was \nreleased on preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 29; Dkt. 33 ¶ 52). \nK.  John Margarella \nJohn Margarella completed his sentence in December 2013, at which point he \nwas entitled to MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 58).  Because Margarella is indigent and his family \ncould neither house him nor afford separate accommodations, Margarella remained \nimprisoned.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 57–58).  Margarella was released on preliminary injunction \nto NewDay on June 23, 2020, after serving six years of “dead time.”  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 58, \n60). \nL.  Dana Monson \nDana Monson completed his sentence on March 25, 2012, at which point he \nwas entitled to MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 54).  Monson is indigent and does not have family \nwho can assist him with money or housing.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 53).  On May 20, 2020, Monson \nwas released to Wayside Cross Ministries on preliminary injunction after spending \nmore than eight years of “dead time.”  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 54, 56). \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 14 of 27 PageID #:628\nM.  Thomas Smith \nThomas Smith was sentenced to three-years-to-life MSR and wished to live \nwith his mother and stepfather.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 38–39).  Smith’s parents have a three-\nbedroom home where he would have his own bedroom and bathroom.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 39).  \nThe IDOC rejected Smith’s parents’ house as a host site because his stepfather was \nconvicted of a sex offense in 1986 and the One-Per-Address Statute prohibits Smith \nfrom living in the same house as a convicted sex offender.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 40).  Smith was \nreleased on preliminary injunction on September 11, 2020.  (Dkt. 60). \nLEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is proper when “the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.”  Fed R. Civ. P. 56(a); see, e.g., Reed v. Columbia St. Mary’s Hosp., 915 F.3d 473, \n485 (7th Cir. 2019).  The parties genuinely dispute a material fact when “‘the evidence \nis such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party’.”  \nDaugherty v. Page, 906 F.3d 606, 609–10 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  The Court “consider[s] all of the evidence in \nthe record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.”  Skiba v. Ill. Centr. \nR.R. Co., 884 F.3d 708, 717 (7th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted).  “Rule 56 ‘mandates the \nentry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, \nagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an \nelement essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 15 of 27 PageID #:629\nof proof at trial.’”  Zander v. Orlich, 907 F.3d 956, 959 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Celotex \nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)). \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs move for summary judgment on three grounds, arguing that the \nchallenged scheme violates the Eighth Amendment (Count I) and substantive due \nprocess and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment (Count II).  As a \nthreshold matter, the parties dispute whether an independent civil suit under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is the \nappropriate vehicle for these constitutional claims. \nI.  § 1984 vs. § 2254 \n  Defendant argues Plaintiffs’ claims must be brought under § 2254 because they \nultimately challenge a restriction on their post-incarceration life.  (Dkt. 48 at 6); see \nalso  Williams  v.  Wisconsin,  336  F.3d  576,  579  (7th  Cir.  2003)  (“Challenges  to \nconditions of confinement . . . fall under § 1983.  Attacks on the fact or duration of \nconfinement come under § 2254.  For parolees . . . the ‘conditions’ of parole are the \nconfinement.”).  This is the same argument raised and rejected both on motion to \ndismiss and summary judgment in Murphy.  See 380 F. Supp. 3d at 750–52.  The \nCourt again rejects this argument. \n  Plaintiffs challenge neither their convictions nor their sentences, including \ntheir MSR terms.  Instead, Plaintiffs challenge the procedures used in host site \nreview.  (Dkt. 24-1 ¶¶ 2, 4, 7, 95–100); see Richmond v. Scibana, 387 F.3d 602, 606 \n(7th Cir. 2004) (“[A] challenge to the rules that affect placement in community \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 16 of 27 PageID #:630\nconfinement [shall be treated] the same way as rules that affect placement in parole \nsystems.”).  The One-Per-Address Statute “in no way affects the duration, much less \nthe fact, of confinement” and, absent the statutory limitation, “supervised release will \nstill be in place, and it will last just as long.”  Bunn v. Conley, 309 F.3d 1002, 1007–\n08 (7th Cir. 2002).  Even were Defendant’s framing of the issue as prison versus \nsupervised  release  correct,  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  nonetheless  appropriate  under \n§ 1983 as they do not request early release.  Moran v. Sondalle, 218 F.3d 647, 652 \n(7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that § 1983 is the appropriate vehicle for prisoners who do \nnot  demand  early  release  but  contest  the  procedures  used  to  make  those \ndeterminations).  Plaintiffs’ claims are proper under § 1983. \nII.  Eighth Amendment \n  The Eighth Amendment restricts the government’s power to punish criminal \noffenders, including imposing “substantive limits on what can be made criminal and \npunished as such.”  Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667 (1977) (citing Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962)).  Criminal laws may punish conduct but may not \npunish status.  See generally Powell v. State of Tex., 392 U.S. 514 (1968); Robinson, \n370 U.S. 660.  The Eighth Amendment proscription against punishing status includes \nboth criminalizing an individual’s status itself as well as an individual’s involuntary \nconduct otherwise inseparable from his status.  See Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at 763 \n(collecting cases).  In Count I, Plaintiffs claim Defendant’s application of the One-Per-\nAddress Statute violates their Eighth Amendment rights because it penalizes their \nhomeless and indigent status.  (Dkt. 24-1 ¶¶ 95–98; Dkt. 32 at 30). \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 17 of 27 PageID #:631\n  Convicted sex offenders must secure a qualifying host site at which to reside \nbefore being released on MSR and the IDOC has the discretion to approve or reject \nthe proposed site.  See Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at 764.  Indigent and homeless \nconvicted sex offenders face a virtually insurmountable obstacle in complying with \nthe IDOC’s application of the One-Per-Address Statute.  The undisputed evidence \nestablishes Plaintiffs are indigent and their families and friends are unable to secure \nhousing acceptable to the IDOC.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 8–10, 35–40, 42–43, 45–62, 64–73).  \nMoreover,  absent  preliminary  injunctive  relief,  affordable  housing  units  and \nresidential rehabilitative programs willing and capable of accepting sex offenders on \nMSR are not compliant with the IDOC’s application of the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n(Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 3–5, 11–13, 15–23, 25, 27–32, 34).  As a result, Plaintiffs are imprisoned \nbeyond the terms of their sentences.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 9, 35, 54, 58, 62, 65, 68, 71, 73).  \nPlaintiffs’  failure  to  procure  an  acceptable  host  site  is  involuntary  conduct \ninseparable from their indigent or homeless status.  Defendant’s application of the \nOne-Per-Address  Statute  constitutes  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  under  the \nEighth Amendment. \n  As in Murphy, Defendant responds that the One-Per-Address Statute doesn’t \ncriminalize status or involuntary conduct relating to homelessness in part because \n“there is no criminal charge here based on the offender’s mere status as homeless.”  \n(Dkt. 48 at 15–17).  The Eighth Amendment addresses punishment; it is not limited \nto a new indictment.  C.f. Martin v. City of Boise, 902 F.3d 1031, 1048 (9th Cir. 2018) \n(referring to “criminal penalties”); Diaz v. Lampela, 601 F. App’x 670, 675–76 (10th \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 18 of 27 PageID #:632\nCir. 2015).  Prolonged incarceration is a punishment under the Eighth Amendment.  \nSee, e.g., Murphy, 308 F. Supp. 3d at 764–65 (collecting cases).  Here, Plaintiffs spent \nas long as 10 years in prison past their release date.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 68).  The One-Per-\nAddress Statute operates to keep indigent and homeless sex offenders incarcerated \nbeyond  their  term  of  imprisonment  and  is  unconstitutional  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \n  Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment claim \n(Count I) is granted. \nIII.  Fourteenth Amendment \nA.  Substantive Due Process \nAs an initial matter, Defendant argues Plaintiffs should be precluded from \nmoving for summary judgment on their substantive due process claim because it was \nnot pled in the Second Amended Complaint.  (Dkt. 48 at 9).  Defendant is correct \nCount II expressly brings a claim under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment and the Second Amended Complaint makes no mention of due process, \nsubstantive  or  otherwise.    (Dkt.  24-1  ¶¶ 99–100).    However,  Plaintiffs  are  not \nrequired to plead legal theories and, when they do, may later alter those theories.  \nChessie Logistics Co. v. Krinos Holdings, Inc., 867 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2017) (citing \nVidimos, Inc. v. Laser Lab Ltd., 99 F.3d 217, 222 (7th Cir. 1996); CMFG Life Ins. Co. \nv. RBS Sec., Inc., 799 F.3d 729, 743–44 (7th Cir. 2015); Rabé v. United Air Lines, Inc., \n636 F.3d 866, 872 (7th Cir. 2011)).  Courts should not hold plaintiffs to their earlier \nlegal theories unless the changes unreasonably harm the defendant or the case’s \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 19 of 27 PageID #:633\ndevelopment by, for example, causing unreasonable delay or making it more “costly \nor difficult” to defend the case, or if the alteration amounts to a change in the factual \ntheory.  Chessie Logistics Co., 867 F.3d at 859 (citing Vidimos, Inc., 99 F.3d at 222; \nWhitaker v. Milwaukee County, 772 F.3d 802, 808–09 (7th Cir. 2014)). \n  Plaintiffs’ newly added substantive due process claim does not alter the factual \ntheory underpinning their suit.  Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim alleges the \nOne-Per-Address Statute impermissibly deprives convicted sex offenders of their \nliberty because it does not serve a government purpose.  (Dkt. 32 at 23; Dkt. 53 at 9).  \nThis new legal theory relies upon the same facts as Plaintiffs’ other claims; namely, \nthat the One-Per-Address Statute does not serve a public safety or rehabilitative \npurpose.    Indeed,  Defendant  tacitly  concedes  this  point  by  arguing  Plaintiffs’ \nsubstantive due process claim is duplicative of their Eighth Amendment claim.  (Dkt. \n48 at 10–11).  Nor does allowing Plaintiffs to add a substantive due process theory at \nthis stage hinder the progress of the case or unduly burden Defendant.  Defendant \ndid not articulate any way in which allowing the substantive due process claim to \nproceed disadvantages him and the Court can identify none. \n  However,  Plaintiffs’  substantive  due  process  claim  is  duplicative  of  their \nEighth Amendment claim.  Despite Plaintiffs’ attempts to distinguish these causes of \naction based on the cross-section of convicted sex offenders to which they apply, both \nallege the One-Per-Address Statute acts to keep convicted sex offenders incarcerated \nbeyond  their  terms  of  imprisonment.    (Dkt.  53  at  8).    While  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment and Eighth Amendment both limit the government’s authority to confine \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 20 of 27 PageID #:634\na person, they are temporally distinct.  See Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389, \n400–01 (2015).  Although it is uncertain which applies to hybrid forms of detention, \nlike that at issue in the present suit, the Seventh Circuit analyzes instances of \ninmates incarcerated beyond their release date under the Eighth Amendment.  See, \ne.g., Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at 765 (collecting cases).  Regardless, “the Eighth \nAmendment standard . . . is at least as difficult for a plaintiff to satisfy as the \nFourteenth Amendment standard.”  Estate of Clark v. Walker, 865 F.3d 544, 546 n.1 \n(7th Cir. 2017), cert denied, 138 S. Ct. 1285 (2018). \n  Based on this understanding, the Court follows the Justices’ admonition that \n“[w]here  a  particular  Amendment  ‘provides  an  explicit  textual  source  of \nconstitutional protection’ against a particular sort of government behavior, ‘that \nAmendment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due process,’ must be \nthe guide for analyzing these claims.’”  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994) \n(citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989)); see Graham, 490 U.S. at 395 \nn.10 (“After conviction, the Eighth Amendment ‘serves as the primary source of \nsubstantive protection . . .’  Any protection that ‘substantive due process’ affords \nconvicted prisoners against excessive force is, we have held, at best redundant of that \nprovided by the Eighth Amendment.”) (citing Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 \n(1986)).  Because of this analytical redundancy, Plaintiffs’ claim is appropriately \nbrought under the Eighth Amendment, not the Fourteenth Amendment. \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 21 of 27 PageID #:635\nB.  Equal Protection \n  The  equal  protection  clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibits  the \ngovernment from treating similarly situated persons differently.  While a prisoner’s \nindigence does not generally call for equal protection analysis, the Supreme Court \nhas at least twice invalidated facially neutral criminal laws that authorized the \ndetention of poor individuals because of their indigence.  See Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. \n395, 397–99 (1971); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 241–42 (1970).  Plaintiffs’ \nFourteenth Amendment claim is analyzed under the standard of scrutiny articulated \nin Turner v. Safley.  482 U.S. 78, 89–91 (1987); see, e.g., Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at \n752–54 (“Custody determinations, to the extent they fall within the ambit of the \nFourteenth Amendment, come under the scope of Turner because they lie at the core \nof running a correctional system.”) (internal citations omitted).  Turner holds that \n“when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights, the regulation \nis valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Turner, 482 \nU.S. at 89.  In applying the Turner standard, courts consider (1) “whether there is a \nvalid, rational connection between the regulation and the legitimate governmental \ninterest put forward to justify it”; (2) whether alternative means of exercising the \nburdened constitutional right are available; (3) the impact accommodation of the \nasserted constitutional right will have on “the allocation of prison resources”; and \n(4) “the existence or absence of ready alternatives” to the challenged restriction.  \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89–91.  Although all four factors are important, “the first one can \nact as a threshold factor regardless which way it cuts.”  Riker v. Lemmon, 798 F.3d \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 22 of 27 PageID #:636\n546, 553 (7th Cir. 2015) (quoting Singer v. Raemisch, 593 F.3d 529, 534 (7th Cir. \n2010)). \n  As  in  Murphy,  Defendant  suggests  the One-Per-Address  Statute  does  not \nimplicate the equal protection clause because it does not obligate Plaintiffs to pay a \nfee directly to the State.  (Dkt. 48 at 14–15).  However, the relevant question is \nwhether indigent and homeless sex offenders remain incarcerated while non-indigent \nand non-homeless sex offenders are not solely because the former cannot afford \nhousing outside prison while the latter can.  See, e.g., Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at 755.  \nPlaintiffs maintain this is the case and, as applied, the One-Per-Address Statute \ntreats wealthy sex offenders differently from those who are poor. \n  On its face, the One-Per-Address Statute applies equally to all convicted sex \noffenders.    As  applied,  however,  the  opportunity  for  indigent  or  homeless  sex \noffenders  to  procure  release  from  confinement  upon  completing  their  term  of \nincarceration is virtually nonexistent.  As the undisputed and material evidence \ndemonstrates, only those sex offenders with access to funds to pay for their own \naccommodations  at  an  approved  location  will  be  free  from  incarceration.    To \nillustrate, Fredrick Chamblis completed his sentence of incarceration for criminal \nsexual assault on January 22, 2016, and became eligible for release on MSR.  (Dkt. \n33 ¶ 61).  The IDOC rejected Chamblis’s family members’ residences as host sites \nand,  because  Chamblis  could  not  independently  afford  housing,  he  remained \nimprisoned for more than four additional years until released on MSR on preliminary \ninjunction.  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 33 ¶ 62).  Similarly, Corey Crowe became eligible for MSR \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 23 of 27 PageID #:637\non June 5, 2018, but was unable to locate or afford appropriate housing.  (Dkt. 33 \n¶ 65).  Crowe remained imprisoned for almost two more years until released on MSR \non preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 65–66).  John Margarella became \neligible for MSR in December 2013 but, due to indigency and his family’s inability to \neither house or financially support him, remained imprisoned for a further six years \nuntil released on MSR on preliminary injunction.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 57–58, 60).  Finally, \nDana Monson completed his sentence of incarceration on March 25, 2012, and became \nentitled to MSR.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 54).  However, Monson is indigent and does not have \nfamily capable of providing him housing or financial support.  (Dkt. 33 ¶ 53).  As a \nresult, Monson spend more than eight years in prison after he became eligible for \nMSR until he was released on preliminary injunction on May 20, 2020.  (Dkt. 22; Dkt. \n33 ¶¶ 54, 56). \n  Plaintiffs’ periods of post-sentence incarceration were not a consequence of \ntheir underlying offense but of their indigent or homeless status, a condition wholly \nbeyond their control.  Defendant’s argument that the IDOC’s requirements that sex \noffenders have a stable host site (applied collectively through statute, regulation, and \npolicy) is rationally related to protecting the public, especially children, misses the \npoint.    In  the  equal  protection  context,  the  relevant  inquiry  is  whether  the \ngovernment’s  separate  and  discriminatory  treatment  of  similarly  situated \nindividuals rationally relates to a legitimate penological interest. \n  Defendants point to no legitimate government interest, such as public safety \nor  rehabilitation,  in  creating  separate  consequences  for  indigent,  homeless  sex \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 24 of 27 PageID #:638\noffenders and non-indigent, non-homeless sex offenders.  “[I]ndigency . . . is itself no \nthreat to the safety or welfare of society” and Defendant’s application of the One-Per-\nAddress Statute to keep indigent and homeless sex offenders incarcerated while non-\nindigent and non-homeless sex offenders are released on MSR is not rationally related \nto public protection.  Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 669 n. 9 (1983).  There is no \nmeaningful penological distinction between indigent and non-indigent sex offenders: \nthe state’s public safety objective is constant.  A homeless or indigent sex offender \npresumably poses the same risk to the community as one capable of affording housing \nand Defendant does not suggest the contrary.  A Minnesota study suggests permitting \nregistrants to live together reduces recidivism and improves supervision, findings \nconsistent with McKelvey’s anecdotal experience.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 2, 7).  Even without \nthe One-Per-Address Statute, the IDOC retains the ability to carefully vet potential \nhost sites and registrants will still be subject to the multitude requirements of MSR.  \nSee 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a), (b-1)(1)–(18).  The host sites at which Plaintiffs which to \nreside comply with all other restrictions under Illinois law and IDOC policy and \nseveral  separately  offer  a  highly  structured  environment  with  strict  rules  for \nresidents.  (Dkt. 33 ¶¶ 12, 14–16, 31–32, 36).  Defendants offer no evidence to the \ncontrary.  The first Turner factor, then, favors invalidating this practice. \n  So, too, does the second Turner factor.  Plaintiffs lack an alternative means of \nexercising their constitutionally protected liberty interest.  The IDOC’s application of \nthe  One-Per-Address  Statute  deprives  indigent  and  homeless  sex  offenders  of \nconditional liberty on MSR. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 25 of 27 PageID #:639\n  Plaintiffs argue on reply that accommodating the right will actually have a \npositive effect on prison resources.  (Dkt. 53 ¶ 19).  In 2019, the average annual cost \nof keeping a person incarcerated in an IDOC facility was $30,419.  See Illinois Dept. \nof  Corrections,  Fiscal  Year  2019  Annual  Report,  101,  available  at   \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/reportsandstatistics/Documents/Annual%20Report%2\n0FY19.pdf (last visited Feb. 26, 2021); see also Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2) (“The court may \njudicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can be \naccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably \nbe questioned.”).  By comparison, “the average cost to the State of supervising a \nparolee on release in the community is approximately $2,000/year.”  (Dkt. 53 at 14) \n(citing Murphy, 380 F. Supp. 3d at 749).  Accommodating the right will positively \nimpact  prison  resources.    The  third  Turner  factor  weighs  in  favor  of  Plaintiffs’ \nposition. \n  Alternative,  constitutional  methods  are  already  in  place  to  effectuate  the \nIllinois Legislature’s compelling state interest in public safety.  Even without the \nOne-Per-Address Statute, the IDOC retains the discretion to deny release to host \nsites deemed unsafe or likely to impede the sex offender’s rehabilitation.  See 730 \nILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(1) (“[Registered] sex offenders . . . may be required by the [IDOC] \nto . . . reside only at a Department approved location[.]”); 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(15) \n(“[Registered] sex offenders . . . may be required by the [IDOC] to . . . comply with all \nother special conditions that the Department may impose that restrict that person \nfrom high-risk situations and limit access to potential victims.”).  Moreover, Illinois \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 26 of 27 PageID #:640\nlaw already severely circumscribes where convicted sex offenders may live.  See 720 \nILCS 5/11-9.3(b.5) (prohibiting child sex offenders from “knowingly resid[ing] within \n500 feet of a school building”); 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(b.10) (prohibiting child sex offenders \nfrom “knowingly resid[ing] within 500 feet of a playground, child care institution, day \ncare center, party day child care facility, day care home, group day care home, or a \nfacility providing programs or services exclusively directed towards [children]”); 730 \nILCS  5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)  (prohibiting  registered  sex  offenders  from  living  “near  . . . \nparks, schools, day care centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other \nplaces where minor children congregate” without preapproval by the IDOC).  Finally, \nthe other conditions of MSR continue to apply to Plaintiffs and the IDOC may impose \nothers deemed necessary to promote community safety and rehabilitation.  See 730 \nILCS 5/3-3-7(a), (b)(1)–(18).  The final Turner factor favors invalidating the One-Per-\nAddress Statute. \n  Defendant’s  application  of  the  One-Per-Address  Statute  creates  an  illegal \nclassification based on wealth which deprives Plaintiffs of their liberty as a result of \ntheir inability to pay.  Nothing in this opinion should be construed to entitle Plaintiffs \nto  release—immediate  or  otherwise.    The  Court  merely  holds  that  Defendant \ncurrently applies the One-Per-Address Statute in an unconstitutional fashion. \n  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  their  equal  protection  claim \n(Count II) is granted. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 95 Filed: 03/26/21 Page 27 of 27 PageID #:641\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is granted \nwith respect to their Eighth Amendment (Count I) and Fourteenth Amendment equal \nprotection claims (Count II) but is denied with respect to their substantive due \nprocess claim.  Although the Court today decides liability, it reserves ruling on the \nproper remedy to afford the plaintiffs.  A status hearing will follow to discuss the need \nfor a remedial hearing to determine the scope of equitable relief. \n   \n \n \n \n____________________________________ \n              Virginia M.

In the midst of a global pandemic that poses an acute risk to the health and \nsafety of imprisoned individuals, Plaintiff Marcus Barnes remains imprisoned in \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) 16 months beyond the completion of \nhis court-ordered term of imprisonment.  \n2.  On Sunday, April 5, 2020, IDOC confirmed that a staff member at Graham \nCorrectional Center (where Plaintiff is imprisoned) has been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19, putting the entire population of individuals imprisoned at Graham in \nimminent danger of infection. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:2\n3.  As outlined in detail in this Court’s decision in Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. \n3d 731 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (Kendall, J.) (hereinafter “Murphy”), the IDOC will not \nrelease individuals who have an indeterminate term of Mandatory Supervised \nRelease (“MSR”) from prison unless and until they obtain an approved “host site” at \nwhich to reside while on MSR. Plaintiff Barnes is a member of the class in Murphy.1 \n4.  After extensive efforts by his family over the past 18 months, Plaintiff Barnes \nhas identified a host site at which to serve his MSR time that meets almost every \nrestriction imposed by Illinois law—it is more than 500 feet away from any schools, \nplaygrounds, and daycares (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10)); and it is not “near” any \n“parks, … swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places where minor \nchildren congregate.” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)).  \n5.  The sole reason the IDOC will not release Barnes to this host site is because \nanother individual who is required to register as a sex offender lives at the same \naddress, and Illinois law prohibits individuals on MSR for sex offenses from living \n“at the same address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the \nsame condominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she \nknows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on \nsupervision for a sex offense.” 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter the “One-Per-\nAddress Statute”).  \n6.  Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, contends \nthat continued enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Eighth \n                                                        \n1   This case is being filed as “related” to Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471 and should be \nassigned to Judge Kendall pursuant to L.R. 40.4(a). \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:3\nAmendment as applied to members of the Murphy class and seeks an injunction \nprohibiting Defendant Jeffreys from continuing to enforce the Statute.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, this Court has jurisdiction to declare the rights of the parties and to \ngrant all further relief deemed necessary and proper.  \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in \nthis district. \nTHE PARTIES \n9.  Defendant Rob Jeffreys is sued in his official capacity as director of the \nIllinois Department of Corrections. In his capacity as the director of IDOC, he has \nfinal authority to set the Department of Corrections’ policies with regard to \napproval of prisoners’ host sites. The Department of Corrections’ power to approve \nor deny proposed host sites is the sole mechanism through which the One-Per-\nAddress Statute is enforced.    \n10. Plaintiff Marcus Barnes is a prisoner at Graham Correctional Center. He \ncompleted his prison term on December 17, 2018, and has been entitled to release \nfrom prison on MSR since that date. He remains in prison because he has been \nunable to obtain a “host site” that meets the IDOC’s approval. At present, the sole \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:4\nreason he is not being released is that another individual who is required to register \nas a sex offender resides at the proposed host site at which he seeks to reside. \n11.  Plaintiff Barnes seeks to represent a class of all individuals who have \nserved their entire sentence of imprisonment and are entitled to release on MSR but \nremain in prison because they cannot obtain a host site that satisfies the One-Per-\nAddress Statute.  \nRELEVANT FACTS \nPlaintiff Marcus Barnes \n12.  Marcus Barnes is 42 years old. He was convicted in 2008 of criminal sexual \nassault and sentenced to serve 12 years in IDOC plus an indeterminate term of \n“three years to life” on MSR. \n13.  With good time credits, Barnes completed his prison sentence on December \n17, 2018, and was approved for release on MSR by the Prisoner Review Board. \n14.  Barnes has a caring family that has worked tirelessly for the past 18 \nmonths to find him a place to live while on MSR.  \n15.  Barnes has submitted 11 different potential host sites. Some of the sites \nwere with family members; others were private residences where Barnes would \nhave lived alone.  \n16.  IDOC has rejected every one of these proposed host sites. The IDOC has \ngiven Barnes various reasons for rejection of the sites, including the proposed site \nbeing too close to a daycare; in a “motel”; and too close to an “after school program.”  \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:5\n17.  In February 2020, Barnes’ family found him a place to stay on the 5700 \nblock of South Sangamon in Chicago. The building is owned and operated by an \norganization called Jordan’s Dream, which provides transitional housing and \nsupportive services (such as help with locating employment, religious services, and \nconnections to mental health providers) to individuals who have been convicted of \nsex offenses.  \n18.  The building is a typical Chicago two-flat with two apartments, one on the \nsecond floor and one on the first floor.  \n19.  IDOC investigated the address and confirmed that it complies with the \nstatutory restrictions on proximity within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds, daycares \nand other places where children congregate.   \n20.  The sole reason the address has been rejected is that another registrant \nlives at the address.  \n21.  Because this address has been rejected, Barnes remains imprisoned in \nIDOC. \n22.  Jordan’s Dream still has an opening for Barnes at the Sangamon address \nand would still like to have Barnes live there.  \n23.  Barnes’ father died on March 31, 2020.  \n24.  Marcus Barnes remains in prison and is unable to mourn the loss of his \nfather with the rest of his family, although he has already served his time and \nshould have been released 16 months ago.    \n \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:6\nThe Murphy Litigation \n25.  The plaintiffs in Murphy challenged the constitutionality of the “host site” \nrequirement as it was being applied to individuals who have been sentenced to an \nindeterminate term of “three years to life” on MSR. Such individuals face the \npossibility of being imprisoned for life if they are unable to find and/or pay for \nhousing that meets the requirements imposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy \nbecause their MSR time never begins to run until they are released from prison to \nan approved host site. See 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(e). \n26.  The Murphy plaintiffs identified several layers of restrictions that limit \nwhere people sentenced to indeterminate MSR can live, which together make it \nimpossible for the members of the class to find host sites. Among the restrictions are \nthe following: \n•   Sections of the Illinois Criminal Code which make it a crime for any \nindividual classified as a “child sex offender” to live within 500 feet of a \nschool, playground, or daycare (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10));  \n \n•   Sections of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections which prohibit persons \nrequired to register as sex offenders from living “near” “parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places \nwhere minor children congregate without advance approval of an agent of \nthe Department of Corrections” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)); \n \n•   The One-Per-Address Statute, which requires individuals on MSR for sex \noffenses to “refrain from residing at the same address or in the same \ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender” (unless residing at a \n“licensed transitional housing facility for sex offenders,” a facility \n“operated or licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services \nor by the Department of Human Services,” or a “licensed medical facility”) \n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6));  \n \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:7\n•   Housing restrictions imposed as a matter of IDOC policy including \nprohibitions on living in a host site where children visit or reside \n(including the parolee’s own children), where there are computers or Wi-Fi \naccess, and/or where there is no land-line telephone;  \n \n•   The unavailability of half-way houses, transitional housing, homeless \nshelters or other free or low-cost housing for indigent parolees; and \n \n•   The IDOC’s interpretation of the One-Per-Address Statute as prohibiting \na sex offender parolee from living in a building adjacent to a building \nwhere another registrant lives and/or from living in the same trailer park \nas another registrant. \n \n27.  Murphy was certified as a class action on behalf of “all individuals \nsentenced to serve three-years-to-life on MSR currently detained in the IDOC who \nhave been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been denied release \nfrom IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved host site.” \nMurphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 63. Marcus Barnes is a member of the \nMurphy class. \n28.  On March 31, 2019, this Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgement on their claim that the State’s statutory and regulatory scheme violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-\n11471, ECF No. 132; Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. 2019). \n29.  The Court’s summary judgment decision did not single out a particular \nIllinois law or IDOC policy that violated the constitution. Rather, the Court held \nthat the State’s “statutory and regulatory scheme” as a whole (i.e., the overlapping \nrestrictions imposed by Illinois law, the IDOC’s interpretation of the law, and the \nIDOC’s policies) violates the Murphy class’s constitutional rights. \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:8\n30.  On January 15, 2020, the Court entered a permanent injunction requiring \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections to put forth a plan “setting forth the specific \nsteps [the Defendants] will take to ensure that by no later than January 2, 2021, no \nmember of the class will remain imprisoned due to an inability to comply with the \nhost site requirement.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156.     \n31.   The permanent injunction also calls for the IDOC to provide the Court with \nperiodic status reports concerning its implementation of the compliance plan and \nprogress towards the January 2, 2021, compliance deadline. Id. \n32.  At the time of this filing, it is counsel’s understanding that the IDOC has \nsucceeded in releasing only three members of the Murphy class from IDOC. Each of \nthose individuals were detained in IDOC for more than eight years beyond the \ncompletion of his prison sentence.   \n33.  As of March 2020, the Murphy class comprises 297 individuals who remain \nin prison beyond the completion of their court-ordered sentence of imprisonment \ndue to an inability to meet the host site requirement.  \n34.  The IDOC’s compliance plan for meeting the January 2, 2021, deadline \nincludes several worthwhile proposals, including changes to IDOC interpretation of \nstatutory restrictions (e.g., not applying the One-Per-Address Statute to trailer \nparks and adjacent buildings); changes to IDOC policy (e.g., allowing individuals to \nreside at addresses with Wi-Fi, relaxation of the land-line requirement); and \ncontracting with private vendors to provide transitional housing. Murphy v. Raoul, \n16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:9\n35.  The plan also notes that “[t]here are many statutory provisions that impede \nthe Department’s ability to approve prospective host sites for sex offenders” and \nstates that the Department “hopes that some of the statutory impediments to \nidentifying host sites can be reduced or eliminated through legislative change.”  Id. \nat 3-4.   \nHealth Risks of Detention in IDOC Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n36.  We are in the midst of a world-wide health crisis caused by the rapid spread \nof coronavirus and COVID-19. The number of known COVID-19 infections is rising \nat an alarming rate. As of April 5, 2020, there have been more than 1.2 million \ninfections globally2; and Illinois alone has nearly 9,000 known cases.3 Nearly 70,000 \npeople have died.4   \n37.  The risks to the health of individuals detained in close proximity to one \nanother in prisons—as well as the staff, attorneys, medical professionals, and clergy \nwho visit and work in these prisons—cannot be overstated. COVID-19 is highly \ncontagious between people who are in close contact with one another.5  \n                                                        \n2  See Johns Hopkins University, Coronavirus Resource Center,  \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html (last visited April 3, 2020). \n \n3    “Coronavirus in Illinois Updates,” Chicago Tribune, April 3, 2020 (available at: \nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-pandemic-chicago-illinois-news-\n20200403-dr4twatabrcx5ccwzcws4uwngu-story.html) \n \n4   See note 2, supra. \n \n5   “How COVID-19 Spreads,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html)  \n \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:10\n38.  The virus is transmissible through coughing, sneezing, and contact with \nsurfaces.6 Experts advise that “talking” and “normal breathing” also likely transmit \nthe disease.7 The CDC urges social distancing—i.e., every person should remain at \nleast six feet away from every other person—to avoid transmission of the disease.8  \n39.  Social distancing is of paramount importance because even entirely \nasymptomatic persons can be infected with COVID-19 and unknowingly transmit it \nto others.9  \n40.  Proper sanitation measures, including frequent hand washing and frequent \ncleaning of surfaces with approved disinfectants, are also recommended.10 Governor \nPritzker has issued a state-wide “stay at home” order to slow the disease’s spread.11  \n41.  None of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 \nare possible for persons confined in prisons and those who must interact with them. \n                                                        \n6   Id. \n \n7    “Experts tell White House coronavirus can spread through talking or even just \nbreathing, CNN, April 2, 2020 (available at: \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/health/aerosol-coronavirus-spread-white-house-\nletter/index.html)  \n \n8    “Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission,” Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Mar. 12, 2020 (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf) \n \n9   See n. 5, supra. \n \n10    “How to Protect Yourself,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)  \n \n11    “Read the Governor’s Full Order Requiring Illinois Residents to Stay at Home,” NBC 5 \nChicago (Mar. 20, 2020) (available at: https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/read-the-\ngovernors-full-order-requiring-illinois-residents-to-stay-at-home/2241196/) \n \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:11\n42.  Many IDOC facilities are overcrowded. For example, Graham Correctional \nCenter, where Plaintiff Barnes is imprisoned, is currently 20 percent above its \nmaximum operating capacity. According to the IDOC’s website, Graham has an \noperational capacity of 1,596 prisoners and currently houses 1,919 prisoners.12  \n43.  Prisoners at Graham are housed two men to a cell; 20 men to a wing. All of \nthese individuals are in close proximity to one another day-in and day-out. It is not \npossible for them to practice “social distancing” from one another.  \n44.  On Sunday, April 5, 2020, IDOC confirmed that a staff member at Graham \nCorrectional Center was diagnosed with COVID-19, thus greatly increasing the \nlikelihood that prisoners at Graham will be infected.13  \n45.  When a prisoner or staff member at a detention facility is infected with \nCOVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly. For example, at the Cook County Jail, 210 \ndetainees and 34 staff have been diagnosed with COVID-19, despite the jail’s \nhaving taken the drastic step of releasing approximately 10 percent of its \npopulation to alleviate crowding. The disease spread exponentially among detainees \nat the jail, from two infections on March 23, to 210 just nine days later.14    \n                                                        \n12   Graham Correctional Center Facility Data, Illinois Department of Corrections \n(available at:  https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/grahamcorrectionalcenter.aspx) \n(last visited April 3, 2020). \n \n13   https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx (last visited April \n5, 2020) \n \n14    “Cook County Jail Now Reports 210 Inmates Have Tested Positive for COVID-19,” \nNBC5 Chicago, April 4, 2020 (https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/coronavirus/cook-county-\njail-now-reports-210-inmates-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19/2250366/) \n \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:12\n46.  At Stateville Correctional Center, 56 prisoners have been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19 and two have died.  \n47.  With COVID-19 cases on the rise throughout the State, it is inevitable that \nother IDOC facilities will become loci for the spread of the disease.  \nThe Challenged Statute \n48.  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n49.  The sole mechanism through which the One-Per-Address Statue is enforced \nis through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of parolees’ proposed host sites. That is, \nit is not a criminal offense for an individual on MSR for a sex offense to live at the \nsame address as another registrant.15 \n50.  The One-Per-Address Statute went into effect on July 11, 2005. Prior to \nthat date, individuals on MSR for sex offenses were permitted to live in the same \nresidence as other registrants. \n51.  On information and belief, the One-Per-Address Statute is a major cause, if \nnot the single largest cause, of the continued imprisonment of members of the \nMurphy class. This is so because other statutes (e.g., the 500-foot rules) already \nstrictly circumscribe the areas where individuals convicted of sex offenses may live. \nPursuant to the One-Per-Address Statute, if a building complies with the other \n                                                        \n15   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:13\nrestrictions, only one parolee may live there, even if it is a large apartment complex \nwith hundreds of units.  \n52.  There is no reason to conclude that people who have been convicted of sex \noffenses’ living near one another contributes to criminality. At least one analysis \nfound that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re-offense and \nimproves supervision. A Minnesota Department of Corrections report concluded as \nfollows:  \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative \neffect related to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In \nfact, supervision agents in both Hennepin and Ramsey County have noted \nbenefits from having more than one level three offender living in one \nlocation. Closer supervision is possible because travel time between \noffenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who live with other level \nthree offenders experience more visits from a supervising agent because \nagents for both offenders visit the same property. Finally, offenders tend \nto inform on each other when supervision restrictions are violated or \ncrimes are committed.16  \n \n53.  There is no logical reason to believe that there is a compelling public safety \nneed to prohibit people on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same address as \none another, and in the Murphy litigation, the IDOC did not come forth with any \nsafety or rehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n   \n                                                        \n16   See “Level Three Sex Offender Residential Placement Issues,” Minnesota Department of \nCorrections (available at: \nhttps://mn.gov/doc/assets/Lvl%203%20SEX%20OFFENDERS%20report%202003%20(revise\nd%202-04)_tcm1089-272828.pdf) (last visited April 3, 2020) \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:14\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n54.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiff seeks certification of this \ncomplaint as a class action for purposes of equitable relief on behalf of a class \ndefined as follows.  \n•  All individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and completed their \ncourt-imposed sentence of incarceration but remain imprisoned in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections because they cannot find housing that \ncomplies with the One-Per-Address Statute, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n \n55.  The Class seeks a declaration that the One-Per-Address Statute violates the \nEighth Amendment as applied to them and an injunction prohibiting Defendant \nfrom continuing to enforce the statute.   \n56.  The proposed class is numerous. According to the final report of the Illinois \nSex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration Task Force, published in December 2017, \n“[o]n average, the Illinois Department of Corrections houses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders \nwho may not be released from custody because they are unable to secure \npermanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute requirements or agency \npolicy.”17 On information and belief, the number of individuals imprisoned in IDOC \ndue to a lack of compliant housing has grown substantially since the publication of \nthat report. If only five percent of those individuals are being held due to the One-\nPer-Address Statute, the class would easily satisfy the numerosity requirement.  \n57.   There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, \nincluding but not limited to the following: \n•  What are the rationales for the One-Per-Address Statute;  \n                                                        \n17   Available at: http://www.icjia.state.il.us/news/sex-offenses-and-sex-offender-\nregistration-task-force-final-report \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:15\n \n•  Whether there is any compelling interest served by the Statute; \n \n•  Whether the Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as applied to the \nmembers of the class.   \n \n58.   All individuals falling within the class definition are subject to the same \nStatute. Given the commonality of the questions pertinent to all class members, a \nsingle judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. \n59.   Defendant has acted and continues to act in a manner adverse to the \nrights of the proposed class, making final declaratory relief appropriate with respect \nto the class as a whole. \n60.   The named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe class; and the named Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of all members \nof the proposed class. \n61.   Plaintiff’s counsel has extensive experience and has devoted substantial \nprofessional and financial resources to representing individuals in cases involving \nthe same type of claim raised here—namely, the Murphy class action. Plaintiff’s \ncounsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \nCOUNT I   \n42 U.S.C. §1983 – EIGHTH AMENDMENT \n \n62.

R. CIV. P. 23(B)(2) AND FOR APPOINTMENT  \nOF CLASS COUNSEL PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 23(G)(1) \n \n  Plaintiff, through counsel, respectfully requests that this Court enter an order \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) certifying this case as a class \naction on behalf of all individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and \ncompleted their court-imposed sentence of incarceration but remain imprisoned in \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections because they cannot find housing that \ncomplies with 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). Plaintiff further requests that this Court \nenter an order appointing the undersigned attorneys as class counsel. In support \nthereof, Plaintiff states as follows. \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  Plaintiff challenges the constitutionality of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter \n“the One-Per-Address Statute.”). The Statute prohibits any individual on \nmandatory supervised release for a sex offense from residing “at the same address \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:46\nor in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably \nshould know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision for a sex \noffense.” \n  Plaintiff Marcus Barnes, and the members of the class he seeks to represent, \nhave all completed their court-ordered terms of incarceration and are entitled to \nrelease on Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”). They remain in prison because \nthey cannot find an approved “host site” at which to live while on MSR due to the \nenforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n  Plaintiff claims enforcement of the Statute against him and others similarly \nsituated violates the Eighth Amendment. Plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory \nrelief on behalf of the class against Rob Jeffreys in his official capacity as the \ndirector of the Illinois Department of Corrections. Mr. Jeffreys is the public official \nwith ultimate authority for enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute. \n  Plaintiff’s claims are ideally suited to proceed as a class action under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). As set forth below, the proposed class satisfies each \nelement of Rule 23(a) because (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims of the named Plaintiff are typical of the claims of the class; and (4) the \nnamed Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a). Moreover, this matter meets the requirements for class certification \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendant has acted in a manner that applies \n\t 2\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:47\ngenerally to the class as a whole, rendering class-wide injunctive and declaratory \nrelief appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Court Should Certify the Proposed Class   \n \n  For a district court to certify a class action, the named plaintiff and the proposed \nclass must satisfy the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a) and the requirements of at least one subsection of Rule \n23(b). Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992). Here, because the \nnamed Plaintiff and the proposed class meet all four Rule 23(a) requirements and \nthe requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), the class should be certified. \nA.  The Proposed Class Meets All of the Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and 23(b)(2) \n \n1.  Numerosity \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  A class \n“including more than 40 members” generally meets this standard. Barragan v. \nEvanger’s Dog and Cat Food Co., 259 F.R.D. 330, 333 (N.D.Ill. 2009); Streeter v. \nSheriff of Cook County, 256 F.R.D. 609, 612 (N.D. Ill. 2012) (same); accord William \nB. Rubenstein, et al., Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:12 (5th ed. 2011) (“a class of 40 \nor more members raises a presumption of impracticability of joinder based on \nnumbers alone.”)  \n  Here, the proposed class easily satisfies this standard. According to the final \nreport of the Illinois Sex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration Task Force, \n\t 3\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:48\npublished in December 2017, “[o]n average, the Illinois Department of Corrections \nhouses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders who may not be released from custody because they \nare unable to secure permanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute \nrequirements or agency policy.”1 If only five percent of those individuals are being \nheld due to the One- Per-Address Statute, the class would easily satisfy the \nnumerosity requirement. Moreover, the number of individuals imprisoned in IDOC \ndue to a lack of compliant housing has grown substantially since the publication of \nthe Task Force Report and continues to grow every month as additional individuals \nfinish their sentences of imprisonment and become eligible for release on MSR. \n2.  Commonality \n \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). The Seventh Circuit has observed that a “common \nnucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement.” \nRosario, 963 F.2d at 1018; Streeter, 256 F.R.D. at 612 (same).  \n  An injunctive challenge to a statute that applies generally to all members of the \nclass is a textbook example of a case that satisfies the commonality requirement \nand warrants class certification. Indeed, this Court and the Seventh Circuit have \nrepeatedly recognized that “[a] class action is … an appropriate vehicle to address \nwhat is alleged to be a systemic problem.” Coleman v. County of Kane, 196 F.R.D. \n505, 507 (N.D. Ill. 2000) (finding commonality in case challenging sheriff’s policy \nregarding bond fees); Corey H. v. Board of Educ. of City of Chicago, No. 92 C 3409, \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1   Available at: http://www.icjia.state.il.us/news/sex-offenses-and-sex-offender-\nregistration-task-force-final-report \n\t 4\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:49\n2012 WL 2953217, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Jul. 19, 2012) (“Plaintiffs have attacked … \nsystemic failures and district-wide policies that apply to every member of the \ncertified class …”); Olson v. Brown, 594 F.3d 577 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding a class \naction was an appropriate vehicle to challenge jail policies concerning responding to \ninmates’ grievances and opening inmates’ legal mail); Streeter v. Sheriff of Cook \nCounty, 256 F.R.D. 609, 612–13 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (certifying class of detainees \nchallenging the Cook County jail’s strip search policy).  \n  Here, the named Plaintiff and all members of the proposed are challenging the \nconstitutionality of the same statute. Accordingly, all of the core factual and legal \nquestions are appropriate for resolution on a class-wide basis. These common \nquestions include the following: \n•  What are the rationales for the One-Per-Address Statute;  \n \n•  Whether there is any compelling interest served by the Statute; \n \n•  Whether the Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as applied to the \nmembers of the class.   \n \n  Because there are common questions of law and fact pertaining to all members \nof the class, this matter meets the commonality requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(2). \n3.  Typicality \n \n  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The \nstandard for determining typicality is not an identity of interest between the named \nplaintiffs and the class, but rather a “sufficient homogeneity of interest.” Jones v. \n\t 5\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:50\nBlinziner, 536 F. Supp. 1181, 1190 (N.D. Ind. 1982) (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. \n393, 403 n.13 (1975)). “[T]he typicality requirement is liberally construed.” Gaspar \nv. Linvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 57 (N.D. Ill. 1996). A “plaintiff’s claim is typical if \nit arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members and [is] based on the same legal theory.” De La \nFuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983). This \nrequirement “is meant to assume that the named representative’s claims ‘have the \nsame essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.’” Oshana v. Coca–\nCola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 514 (7th Cir. 2006). \n  Where, as here, the named plaintiffs’ injuries arise from a generally applicable \nstatute affecting all members of the class, typicality exists even if there are factual \ndifferences in precisely how the policy was applied to each plaintiff. Streeter v. \nSheriff of Cook County, 256 F.R.D. 609, 612-13 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (certifying class of \ndetainees strip searched upon entry to Cook County Jail, despite the Sheriff’s \nargument that there were differences in the circumstances of each search “because \n‘the likelihood of some range of variation in how different groups of … detainees \nwere treated does not undermine the fact that the claims of each class [member] \nshare a common factual basis and legal theory.’”); Areola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, \n798 (7th Cir. 2008) (typicality satisfied where plaintiff was in the “same boat” as \nother Cook County Jail detainees who had been denied crutches); Bullock v. \nSheahan, 225 F.R.D. 227, 230 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (“[p]otential factual differences” \n\t 6\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:51\nrelating to individual searches held insufficient to defeat typicality in a jail strip \nsearch case). \n  In this case, the named Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the class as a whole. \nPlaintiff Barnes is currently detained in IDOC despite having completed his term of \nincarceration because he is subject to the One-Per-Address Statute. Each member of \nthe proposed class is in the same situation. As such, Plaintiff is subject to the same \npolicy applicable to every member of the class. Moreover, the named plaintiff and \neach class member has the same legal theories—that is, that the challenged statute \nviolates the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, the named Plaintiff satisfies Rule \n23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement. See Fonder v. Sheriff of Kankakee County, No. 12-\nCV-2115, 2013 WL 5644754, at *6 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 15, 2013) (typicality satisfied where \n“Plaintiff is challenging the same strip search policy as the class he seeks to \nrepresent”); Olson, 284 F.R.D. at 411 (typicality satisfied where class representative \nand members of proposed class had their legal mail opened improperly by \ncorrectional officers). \n4.  Adequacy \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiffs “will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The adequate \nrepresentation inquiry consists of two parts: “(1) the adequacy of the named \nplaintiffs as representatives of the proposed class’ myriad members, with their \ndiffering and separate interests, and (2) the adequacy of the proposed class counsel.” \n\t 7\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:52\nGomez v. St. Vincent Health, Inc., 649 F.3d 583, 592 (7th Cir. 2011). Both elements \nare met here.  \na.  Plaintiff Is an Appropriate Representative of the Interests of \nthe Class  \n \n  The named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nThe named Plaintiff is currently being detained in IDOC pursuant to the allegedly \nunconstitutional statute. Both the named Plaintiff and the members of the proposed \nclass have a common interest in ensuring that this statute is enjoined. The named \nPlaintiff and the class members raise the same claims and seek the same relief, and \nthe class representative does not have interests antagonistic to the interests of the \nclass. Plaintiff Barnes is committed to obtaining an injunction to prevent future \nviolations of detained individuals’ constitutional rights. Accordingly, Plaintiff \nBarnes has a strong personal stake in the proceedings that will “insure diligent and \nthorough prosecution of the litigation.” Rodriguez v. Swank, 318 F. Supp. 289, 294 \n(N.D. Ill.1970), aff'd 403 U.S. 901 (1971).  \nb.  Adequacy of Representation \n  The named Plaintiff is represented by experienced civil rights counsel who are \nwell qualified to represent the interests of the members of the class and have \ndevoted substantial time and resources to vigorously prosecuting this case. Ms. \nNicholas and Mr. Weinberg have successfully litigated numerous constitutional \ncases in which broad equitable relief was sought, including the Murphy class action \nwhich raised claims closely related to the claim raised here. See, e.g., Murphy v. \nRaoul, 16 C 11471, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill., 2019) (Kendall, J.) (certified class \n\t 8\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:53\naction; obtained permanent injunction governing IDOC procedures for releasing sex \noffenders on MSR); RCP Publications Inc. v. City of Chicago, 15 C 11398 (certified \nclass action; obtained permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of City’s sign-\nposting ordinance and class-wide damages); Adair v. Town of Cicero, No. 18 C 3526, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110949 (N.D. Ill. July 3, 2019) (pending certified class action \non behalf of women detained in Town of Cicero police lockup); Koger v. Dart, 114 F. \nSupp. 3d 572 (N.D. Ill., 2015) (obtained declaratory judgment holding ban on \nnewspapers in the Cook County Jail unconstitutional); Pindak v. Dart, 10 C 6237 \n(N.D. Ill. 2016) (Pallmeyer, J.) (obtained a permanent injunction ordering the \nsheriff to train deputies concerning First Amendment rights); Norton v. City of \nSpringfield, 806 F. 3d 411 (7th Cir. 2015) (obtained a injunction barring the City of \nSpringfield from enforcing its municipal panhandling ordinance).  \n  Because the Plaintiff Barnes has demonstrated a commitment to vigorously \npursuing class-wide relief and because he is represented by competent and \nexperienced counsel, he satisfies Rule 23(a)(4)’s adequacy requirements. \n5.  Plaintiff Satisfies Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) Because this Case \nSeeks Declaratory and Injunctive Relief from Policies that \nImpact the Entire Proposed Class \n \n  The final requirement for class certification is that the named plaintiff must \nmeet the requirements of at least one of the subsections of Rule 23(b). Subsection \n(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \n\t 9\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:54\nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Courts have long recognized that civil rights class \nactions are the paradigmatic 23(b)(2) suits, “for they seek classwide structural relief \nthat would clearly redound equally to the benefit of each class member.” Marcera v. \nChinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1240 (2d Cir. 1979), vacated on other grounds, 442 U.S. \n915 (1979); see also Alliance to End Repression v. Rochford, 565 F. 2d 975, 979 n.9 \n(7th Cir. 1977) (“Rule 23(b)(2) … is devoted primarily to civil rights class actions \nwhich allege violations of constitutional rights.”) (citing Advisory Committee Notes \nto the 1966 Amendments to Rule 23.) As stated in the leading treatise on class \nactions: \nRule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights \nsuits. Most class actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas \nseek primarily declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class \nand therefore readily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) class action criteria. \n \nA. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002). Because \nthis case seeks class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief, it is appropriate for \ncertification as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nII.   The Court Should Designate Plaintiff’s Counsel as Class Counsel \nUnder Rule 23(g)(1) \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) requires that the district court appoint \nclass counsel for any class that is certified. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). The attorneys \nappointed to serve as class counsel must “fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B). The appointed class counsel must \nbe listed in a court’s class certification order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(B). \n\t 10\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:55\n  Rule 23(g) provides four factors for a court to consider in appointing class \ncounsel: (1) “the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential \nclaims in the action;” (2) “counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other \ncomplex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action;” (3) “counsel’s \nknowledge of the applicable law”; and (4) “the resources that counsel will commit to \nrepresenting the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  \n  The undersigned attorney satisfies each of these requirements. First, Plaintiff’s \ncounsel have invested substantial work into preparation of this case, including \nspeaking to numerous families and individuals affected by the challenged policies, \ndrafting a complaint, drafting a motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary \nrestraining order, and conducting extensive legal research concerning the class \nmembers’ claims. Second, as set forth in §I(A)(4)(c) above, Plaintiff’s counsel have \ndevoted substantial professional resources to litigation on behalf of individuals who \nhave been convicted of sex offenses and have significant experience in handling \ncomplex civil rights litigation, including the kind of claims asserted in this case. \nFinally, Plaintiff’s counsel have dedicated and will continue to commit substantial \nresources to the representation of this class. In sum, Plaintiff’s counsel fully satisfy \nthe criteria for class counsel set forth in Rule 23(g), and Plaintiff respectfully \nrequests that the Court appoint undersigned counsel to represent the class. \n \n \n   \n\t 11\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 5 Filed: 04/06/20 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:56\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant \nthe motion for class certification and appoint the undersigned attorney as Class \nCounsel. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Adele D.

Kendall. Motion \nhearing held on 4/8/2020 regarding Plaintiff's Emergency Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction 3 (Dkt. 154 in \n20 C 1792). Plaintiff has completed his sentence and remains detained \nbecause of the \"One Person Per Address\" provision in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-\n7(a)(7.6). This Court has already held that detaining sex offenders long \nafter their period of incarceration has been completed is unconstitutional. \nSee Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3rd 781 (N.D. Ill. 2019). Here, \nPlaintiff has found a place to live that will be supportive of his transfer \nback into the community. The building is operated by Jordan's Dreams, a \nnonprofit organization aiding individuals in assimilating back into the \ncommunity. Another sex offender resides in the building already and \ntherefore Defendants will not permit him to reside there. Plaintiff is \nclearly suffering a constitutional harm each day he is detained past his \nrelease date (which is now nearly a year and a half) and that harm can \nonly be remedied by release. In response to the question about what \npenological or rehabilitative support the Defendants have for the \"one \nPerson One Address\" provision, Defendants were unable to give any. \nThe public's interest in only have one sex offender live at one residence \nis not supported by any testimony, expert opinion, or evidence. \nTherefore, the Court finds that the statute is unconstitutional as it applies \nto Plaintiff and Defendants are enjoined from prohibiting his release to \nthe address presented by Plaintiff. To the extent that the COVID-19 \nsituation in the facility plays a factor, it is only minor at this stage \n\nbecause of the speculative nature of the claim that he could be harmed. \nYet certainly, being held in a facility where he may be exposed to the \nvirus is not taken lightly, his real harm at this stage is his continued \nincarceration beyond his release date when he has a suitable location to \nlive.Mailed notice (lk, ) (Entered: 04/08/2020) \n04/08/2020  12   EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ORDER: Case reassigned to the Honorable \nVirginia M.

This  Court  has  already  determined  that  it  is \nunconstitutional  to  imprison  sex  offenders  after  their  period  of incarceration  has \nbeen  completed  solely  because  they  are  unable  to  find  suitable  host  sites.  See \nMurphy  v.  Raoul,  380  F.  Supp.  3d  781  (N.D.  Ill.  2019).\nThe  following  class  members  have  identified  host  sites  that  will  be  supportive  of \ntheir  transition  back  into  the  community: \nWayside  Cross  Ministries,  215  E.

R. Civ. P. 56, respectfully move this \nCourt for entry of summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs and the class they \nrepresent and against Defendant Rob Jeffreys, Director of the Illinois Department \nof Corrections, on Plaintiffs’ claim that 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) violates the Eighth \nand Fourteenth Amendments on its face and as applied to them.  \nINTRODUCTION \n  There are currently at least 1,200 people imprisoned in the Illinois Department \nof Corrections (“IDOC”) who have completed their court-ordered sentences of \nincarceration and are entitled to release to a community setting on mandatory \nsupervised release (“MSR”). These individuals remain in prison because they are \nunable to secure an approved “host site” at which to live while on MSR.1 \n  One of the principal barriers to these individuals’ finding host sites is 730 ILCS \n5/3-3-7(a)(7.6), a section of the Illinois Uniform Code of Corrections which prohibits \nan individual on MSR for a sex offense from living “at the same address or in the \nsame condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium complex or \napartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably should know \n \n1   The precise number of individuals currently imprisoned in IDOC due to a lack of \nhousing is not currently known. A report published by the Illinois Criminal Justice \nInformation Authority estimates the number to be between 1,200 and 1,400 people. See \nIllinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, Sex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration \nTask Force Final Report (Jan. 2017) at 6 (“On average, the Illinois Department of \nCorrections houses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders who may not be released from custody because \nthey are unable to secure permanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute requirements \nor agency policy.”) (citing the Illinois Department of Corrections’ Research and Planning \nUnit).  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 5 of 35 PageID #:264\nis a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision for a sex offense.” \n(hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute” or “the Statute”).  \n  But for the One-Per-Address Statute, members of the class who remain in prison \nbeyond the completion of their sentences could be released to safe, affordable \nhousing that would foster their reintegration into the community and support their \nsuccess on MSR. The Statute puts off limits every halfway house and shelter in the \nState, including the only provider (Wayside Cross Ministries) that is willing to \nhouse indigent persons on MSR for sex offenses at no cost to the releasee or the \nIDOC. Moreover, because of the One-Per-Address Statute, members of the class who \nhave been released from IDOC to approved host sites in the community are at \nconstant risk of being revoked and re-imprisoned if another individual with a sex \noffense conviction moves into the same building or apartment complex.  \n  Meanwhile, there is not a shred of evidence in the record that the One-Per-\nAddress Statute serves any legitimate government interest. Indeed, when this \nCourt granted an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the One-Per-Address \nStatute as to Plaintiff Marcus Barnes, this Court noted the lack of evidentiary \nsupport for the Statute, writing as follows: \nIn response to the question about what penological or rehabilitative \nsupport the Defendants have for the “One Person One Address” provision, \nDefendants were unable to give any. The public’s interest in only hav[ing] \none sex offender live at one residence is not supported by any testimony, \nexpert opinion, or evidence. Therefore, the Court finds that the statute is \nunconstitutional as it applies to Plaintiff and Defendants are enjoined \nfrom prohibiting his release to the address presented by Plaintiff. \n \nECF No. 11.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 6 of 35 PageID #:265\n  For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on \ntheir claims that the One-Per-Address Statute violates their rights under the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \nMATERIAL FACTS \nI.  The Murphy Litigation \n  The plaintiffs in Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, challenged the constitutionality \nof the “host site” requirement as it was being applied to individuals who have been \nsentenced to an indeterminate term of “three years to life” on MSR. Such \nindividuals face the possibility of being imprisoned for life if they are unable to find \nand/or pay for housing that meets the requirements imposed by Illinois law and \nIDOC policy because their MSR time never begins to run until they are released \nfrom prison to an approved host site. See 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(e).  \n  The Murphy plaintiffs identified several layers of restrictions that limit where \npeople who have been convicted of sex offenses can live while on MSR, which \ntogether make it impossible for the members of the class to find host sites. Among \nthe restrictions are the following: \n•  Sections of the Illinois Criminal Code which make it a crime for any \nindividual classified as a “child sex offender” to live within 500 feet of a \nschool, playground, or daycare (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10));  \n \n•  Sections of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections which prohibit persons \nrequired to register as sex offenders from living “near” “parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places where \nminor children congregate without advance approval of an agent of the \nDepartment of Corrections” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12));   \n \n•  The One-Per-Address Statute, which requires individuals on MSR for sex \noffenses to “refrain from residing at the same address or in the same \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 7 of 35 PageID #:266\ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium complex or \napartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably \nshould know is a convicted sex offender” unless residing at a “licensed \ntransitional housing facility for sex offenders,” a facility “operated or licensed \nby the Department of Children and Family Services or by the Department of \nHuman Services,” or a “licensed medical facility” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6));  \n \n•  Housing restrictions imposed as a matter of IDOC policy, including \nprohibiting living in a host site where children visit or reside (including the \nparolee’s own children), where there are computers or Wi-Fi access, and/or \nwhere there is no land-line telephone;  \n \n•  The unavailability of licensed half-way houses, transitional housing, \nhomeless shelters or other free or low-cost housing for indigent parolees; and \n \n•  The IDOC’s interpretation of the One-Per-Address Statute as prohibiting a \nsex offender parolee from living in a building adjacent to a building where \nanother registrant lives and/or from living in the same trailer park as \nanother registrant.2 \n \n  On April 5, 2018, Murphy was certified as a class action on behalf of “all \nindividuals sentenced to serve three-years-to-life on MSR currently detained in the \nIDOC who have been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been \ndenied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved \nhost site.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 63. \n  On March 31, 2019, this Court granted the Murphy plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgement on their claim that the State’s statutory and regulatory \nscheme violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment. Murphy \nv. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 132; Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. \n2019). The Court’s summary judgment decision did not single out a particular \n \n2   These restrictions were discussed at length in this Court’s summary judgment decision \nin Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738–743 (N.D. Ill. 2019). Because this Court has \nalready thoroughly analyzed the facts relevant to Murphy, Plaintiffs have not included \nthese facts in their L.R. 56.1 Statement of Facts in support of this motion.   \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 8 of 35 PageID #:267\nIllinois law or IDOC policy that violated the constitution. Rather, the Court held \nthat the State’s “statutory and regulatory scheme” as a whole (i.e., the overlapping \nrestrictions imposed by Illinois law, the IDOC’s interpretation of the law, and the \nIDOC’s policies) violates the Murphy class’s constitutional rights.  \n  On January 15, 2020, the Court entered a permanent injunction requiring the \nIDOC to put forth a plan “setting forth the specific steps [the Defendants] will take \nto ensure that by no later than January 2, 2021, no member of the class will remain \nimprisoned due to an inability to comply with the host site requirement.” Murphy v. \nRaoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. The IDOC filed its compliance plan on February \n27, 2020. 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. The permanent injunction also calls for the \nIDOC to provide the Court with periodic status reports concerning its \nimplementation of the compliance plan and its progress towards meeting the \nJanuary 2, 2021 compliance deadline. 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. \n  The IDOC has taken several steps to ease the difficulty Murphy class members \nhave with finding housing, including changes to IDOC interpretation of statutory \nrestrictions (e.g., not applying the One-Per-Address Statute to trailer parks and \nadjacent buildings); changes to restrictive IDOC policies (e.g., allowing individuals \nto reside at addresses with Wi-Fi, relaxation of the land-line requirement); and \ncontracting with private vendors to provide transitional housing. Murphy v. Raoul, \n16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. \n  Notwithstanding these efforts, the IDOC’s first compliance report (filed on June \n15, 2020), states that the Murphy class currently comprises 327 individuals who \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 9 of 35 PageID #:268\nremain in prison beyond the completion of their court-ordered sentence of \nimprisonment due to an inability to meet the host site requirement, up from 290 at \nthe time the permanent injunction was entered. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF \nNos. 156, 172. \nII.  The Challenged Statute \n  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). The sole mechanism through which the \nOne-Per-Address Statue is enforced is through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of \nparolees’ proposed host sites. That is, it is not a criminal offense for an individual on \nMSR for a sex offense to live at the same address as another registrant, and local \npolice departments and states attorneys play no role in enforcement of the statute.3 \n  The One-Per-Address Statute is a major cause, if not the single largest cause, of \nthe continued imprisonment of members of the Murphy class and other individuals \nwho have been convicted of sex offenses. This is so because other statutes (e.g., the \n500-foot rules) already strictly circumscribe the areas where individuals convicted of \nsex offenses may live, and the One-Per-Address Statute makes it so only one parolee \ncan live at each compliant property, even if it is a large apartment complex with \nmany units.  \n   \n \n3   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 10 of 35 PageID #:269\nIII.  There Is No Evidence in the Record that The One-Per-Address Statute \nServes Government Interests  \n \n  In the Murphy litigation, the IDOC did not come forth with any safety or \nrehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute. In his deposition in \nMurphy, the IDOC’s Deputy Chief of Parole, Dion Dixon, was asked what the \nreason was for the Department’s application of the One-Per-Address Statute to \ntrailer parks. SOF at ¶1.4 He did not reference any safety or rehabilitative purpose. \nRather, he simply stated that the state police had interpreted the Statute to apply \nto trailer parks and IDOC followed suit. Id. In acknowledgement of the restriction’s \nexcessiveness, IDOC has already reinterpreted the restriction so as not to apply to \ntrailer parks or adjacent apartment buildings. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF \nNo. 161. \n  Not only is there no evidence in the record supporting the One-Per-Address \nStatute, there is no logical reason to conclude that allowing people who have been \nconvicted of sex offenses to live near one another contributes to criminality. At least \none analysis found that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re- \noffense and improves supervision. SOF at ¶2. A Minnesota Department of \nCorrections report concluded as follows:  \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative effect \nrelated to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In fact, \nsupervision agents … have noted benefits from having more than one level \nthree offender living in one location. Closer supervision is possible because \ntravel time between offenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who \n \n4   References to factual statements in this brief are to the numbered paragraphs of \nPlaintiffs’ L.R. 56.1 Statement of Facts (“SOF”). The paragraphs of the Statement of Facts \nare supported by reference to declarations, deposition testimony and other evidence in the \nrecord. \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 11 of 35 PageID #:270\nlive  with  other  level  three  offenders  experience  more  visits  from  a \nsupervising agent because agents for both offenders visit the same property. \nFinally,  offenders  tend  to  inform  on  each  other  when  supervision \nrestrictions are violated or crimes are committed. \n \nId. \n \n  Similarly, Bob McKelvey, the founder and manager of NewDay Apartments, \nwhich specializes in providing housing to registrants, testified that in his experience \n“housing registrants at the same address allows for more effective (and cost-\neffective) law enforcement oversight” and “also allows registrants to police one \nanother and share resources to better support themselves, which ultimately helps \nthem focus on the future and reduces recidivism.” SOF at ¶7. \nIV.  The One-Per-Address Statute Results in the Imprisonment of Class \nMembers Who Could Otherwise Reside in Safe, Rehabilitative Housing \nWhile on MSR \n \nA.  New Day Apartments Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class \nMembers \n \n  NewDay Apartments, located in Lake County, Illinois, has partnered with the \nIDOC to provide housing to individuals with sex offense convictions being released \nfrom prison onto MSR. SOF at ¶3. NewDay specializes in providing compliant \nhousing to registrants. Id. It currently owns eight properties, all of which comply \nwith the prohibition on residence within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and \ndaycares. Id. at ¶4. NewDay currently leases four of these properties to IDOC for \nthe purpose of housing indigent members of the Murphy class who cannot otherwise \nsecure housing. Id. \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 12 of 35 PageID #:271\n  Placement at the units IDOC leases from NewDay is intended to give individuals \nwho do not have the means to secure a host site an opportunity to get out of prison \nand begin their MSR time in the community. Murphy class members released to \nNewDay are given three to four months rent-free to give them an opportunity to \nfind work, obtain government benefits to which they are entitled, and to secure \nhousing of their own. See Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161 at 2.  \n  Under the One-Per-Address Statute, NewDay is limited to housing four \nregistrant-parolees in these four units. Pursuant to the Court’s May 13, 2020, Order \ngranting preliminary injunctive relief (ECF No. 22), three additional registrants \nwere permitted to move into these units.5 SOF at ¶5. \n  In addition to the units NewDay Apartments leases to IDOC, NewDay also owns \nseveral other multi-unit properties that it privately rents to registrants. SOF at ¶6. \nBecause of the One-Per-Address Statute, these properties are currently only \navailable to registrants who are off MSR. Id. But for the One-Per-Address Statute, \nNewDay would be willing to lease to individuals on MSR the apartments it \ncurrently makes available only to individuals who are off MSR. Id. \n  Plaintiff Alvin Goldberg is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center. With \n“good time” credits, Goldberg completed his prison term on November 11, 2018, and \nhas been entitled to release from prison on MSR since that date, but he remains \nimprisoned because he has been unable to secure compliant housing. SOF at ¶8. \n \n5   The seven class members currently residing at NewDay are Stan Meyer, J.D. \nLindenmeier, Jerry Davis, Clay Trench, DeJuan Wright, John Margarella, and Jerrand \nMiller. \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 13 of 35 PageID #:272\nBecause of his inability to find housing, Goldberg, who is 81 years old, has spent \nmore than 18 months of “dead time” in prison. Id. at ¶9. Plaintiff Goldberg and his \nfamily are able to privately pay for an apartment through NewDay Apartments. \nGoldberg is on the waiting list to rent a unit from NewDay, subject to his being able \nto obtain “a court order allowing NewDay to house Alvin with other registrants who \nlive in other units at the same address.” Id. at ¶10. Pursuant to this Court’s May 13, \n2020, Order (ECF No. 22), Plaintiff Goldberg has been approved for release to \nNewDay when a unit becomes available and can reside at NewDay pending further \norder of the Court. \n  NewDay is expanding despite the current pandemic. SOF ¶11. It plans to double \nthe number of registrant units available year-over-year for at least the next three \nyears. Id. The long term goal of NewDay is to become the No. 1 provider of safe, \naffordable registrant housing in the United States. Id. According to Bob McKelvey, \nthe founder of NewDay, permitting multiple registrant-parolees at the same \naddress would easily double the number of units NewDay can offer compared to \nwhat is possible under current law, and would make the housing NewDay provides \nmore affordable for registrant-tenants.

Wayside Cross Ministries Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class \nMembers \n \n  Wayside Cross Ministries is a Bible-based residential program that has operated \nin Aurora, Illinois, for more than 90 years. SOF at ¶13. The Master’s Touch \nMinistry is a life-transformation program for men with various destructive \nbehaviors not limited to drug and alcohol addiction. Id. The program offers room \nand board at no cost, and empowers its participants to change their lives through \nthe Gospel of Christ, prayer, Bible study, daily chapel services, mentoring with local \nchurch and business leaders, and work rehabilitation programs. Id. at ¶14. It takes \na minimum of seven months for a resident to complete the Master’s Touch Ministry \nprogram. Id. at ¶15. The end goal of the program is to give the men the tools they \nneed to live healthy, law abiding lives through their faith. Id. \n  The Master’s Touch Ministry is a highly structured program with a strict code of \nconduct, which includes adherence to a curfew, attendance at scheduled Bible study \nand church services, no use of drugs or alcohol, refraining from the use of profane or \nabusive language, listening only to music that glorifies God, and only using \ntechnology in a manner that conforms to God’s high standards. Id. at ¶16. \nSuccessful completion of the program hinges on successful random drug and alcohol \ntests, active participation in programming, as well as adherence to all the rules of \nMaster’s Touch. Id. \n  The participants in the Master’s Touch Ministry all reside together in a \ndormitory setting at Wayside Cross, located at 215 E. New York Street in Aurora. \nId. at ¶17.

Jordan’s Dream Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class Members \n  Plaintiff Marcus Barnes was convicted in 2008 of criminal sexual assault and \nsentenced to serve 12 years in IDOC plus an indeterminate term of “three years to \nlife” on MSR. With good time credits, Barnes completed his prison sentence on \nDecember 17, 2018, and was approved for release on MSR.  \n  Barnes’ family identified 11 different potential host sites, all of which IDOC \nrejected for various reasons, including proximity to daycares and schools. SOF at \n¶35. Because of his inability to secure compliant housing, Barnes spent more than \n18 months of “dead time” in prison. Id. In February 2020, Barnes’ family found him \na place to stay on the 5700 block of South Sangamon in Chicago. Id. at ¶36.

Id. \n  IDOC investigated the address and confirmed that it complies with the statutory \nrestrictions on proximity within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds, daycares and \nother places where children congregate. Id. at ¶37. However, IDOC rejected the host \nsite pursuant to the One-Per-Address Statute because another registrant resided \nthere. Id. Pursuant to this Court’s April 8, 2020, Order (ECF No. 11), Plaintiff \nBarnes was released to Jordan’s Dream on April 14, 2020, and can reside there \npending further order of the court.  \nF.  Placements with Families Are Put Off Limits by the One-Per-\nAddress Statute  \n \n  Plaintiff Thomas Smith is an individual who is currently imprisoned in IDOC \nand is seeking a host site at which to reside while on “three-to-life” MSR. SOF at \n¶38. Plaintiff Smith’s mother Tammy and step-father Jerry would like to have \nThomas live with them at their home in Pocahontas, Illinois, while he is on MSR. \nSOF at ¶39. Plaintiff Smith’s parents have a three-bedroom home and can give \nThomas his own bedroom and bathroom. The home is in a rural area, and it is not \nwithin 500 feet of any schools, playgrounds, or daycares. Id. \n  Plaintiff Smith submitted his parents’ home as a proposed host site. SOF at ¶40. \nIDOC rejected the host site because his stepfather was convicted of a sex offense 34 \nyears ago (in 1986), and the One-Per-Address Statute prohibits Thomas from \nresiding at the same address as another person who has been convicted of a sex \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 20 of 35 PageID #:279\noffense—no matter how long ago. Id. The only barrier to Plaintiff Smith’s being \nallowed to serve his MSR time at his parents’ home is the One-Per-Address Statute.  \nG.  Class Members Are Prohibited from Sharing Living Expenses \nBecause of the One-Per-Address Statute  \n \n  Class members of limited means who have been released from IDOC custody \nwould like to reside together and share living expenses, but they are currently \nprohibited from doing so pursuant to the One-Per-Address Statute. In particular, \nPlaintiffs J.D. Lindenmeier and Stan Meyer are currently residing in units IDOC \nleases from NewDay apartments. SOF at ¶41. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Lindenmeier are \ncurrently seeking work. SOF at ¶42. Once they both have jobs and the means to \nsupport themselves, they would like to rent an apartment together to share living \nexpenses such as rent and utilities. Id. Many one bedroom apartments in North \nChicago and Waukegan rent for approximately $750 to $850 per month, which is \ndifficult for an individual earning minimum wage to afford on his own. Id. at ¶43. \nHowever, two-bedroom apartments in the area often rent for approximately $900 to \n$1,100 per month, which is more affordable when split between two people. Id. at \n¶44. \nH.  Class Members Are At Risk of Revocation and Reimprisonment \nBecause of the One-Per-Address Statute  \n \n  Plaintiff Luis Aponte was released from IDOC onto MSR in January 2020 to his \nfather’s home in Waukegan, Illinois. SOF at ¶45. The host site is in a four-story \napartment building that contains approximately 12 separate units. Id. When \nAponte was released, no other registrant lived in the building. SOF at ¶46. IDOC \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 21 of 35 PageID #:280\ndetermined that the address complies with the prohibition on residing within 500 \nfeet of a school, playground or daycare, and approved Aponte to live there while on \nMSR. Id. Aponte is doing well on MSR. He has full-time employment in a \nwarehouse and has been attending required sex offender therapy regularly. Id. at \n¶47. \n  In March 2020, another registrant (not on MSR) moved into a different unit in \nthe same building where Aponte resides with his father. Id. at ¶48. Aponte received \nnotice from his parole agent that he had to find somewhere else to live or he would \nbe sent back to prison because the One-Per-Address Statute prohibits him from \nliving in the same apartment building as another registrant. Id. Aponte was not \nable to find another host site that met IDOC approval that he could afford and \nwanted to keep residing with his father. Id. at ¶49. \n  Pursuant to preliminary injunctive relief granted by the Court on June 3, 2020, \n(ECF No. 29), Aponte has been able to remain in his father’s home pending further \norder of the Court. If the One-Per-Address Statute is enforced against Aponte, he \nwill have his MSR revoked and be sent back to prison, resulting in loss of his job, \nhalting the progress he has made on MSR so far, and forcing him to serve dead time \nuntil he can secure a new place to live. Id. \n  Plaintiff Kevin Manson was released from IDOC onto MSR on May 6, 2020, to a \nhost site in Chicago Heights, Illinois, with his aunt. Id. at ¶50. IDOC approved \nManson for release to his aunt’s home, but the approval was given in error. When \nManson tried to register with Chicago Heights police after his release, he was \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 22 of 35 PageID #:281\ninformed that his aunt’s house is too close to a school. Id. at ¶51. Chicago Heights \npolice told him that he must move. Id. Manson did not have funds to pay for \nhousing of his own. The Cook County Justice Advisory Council (“CCJAC”), a \ngovernmental entity that provides reentry assistance to citizens returning to Cook \nCounty after imprisonment, was willing to pay for Manson’s housing and secured a \nplace for him at New Beginnings. Id. at ¶52. \n  Pursuant to preliminary injunctive relief granted by the Court (ECF No. 29), \nManson has been permitted to reside at New Beginnings pending further order of \nthe Court. If the One-Per-Address Statute is enforced against Manson, he will have \nhis MSR revoked and be sent back to prison because he cannot secure housing that \ncomplies with the rule.  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Summary Judgment Standard \n  Summary judgment is proper when “the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Reed v. Columbia St. Mary’s Hosp., 915 F.3d 473, 485 \n(7th Cir. 2019). \nII. The One-Per-Address Statute Violates the Substantive Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n \n  For a government policy that infringes on “fundamental rights and liberties” to \nsurvive scrutiny under the substantive due process clause, the government must \nshow that the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state \ninterest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (“the Fourteenth \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 23 of 35 PageID #:282\nAmendment ‘forbids the government to infringe . . . fundamental liberty interests at \nall, no matter what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored \nto serve a compelling state interest.’”) (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 \n(1993)).  \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on their substantive due process claim \nbecause, as set forth below, the One-Per-Address Statute interferes with the \nfundamental liberty interest in freedom from bodily restraint and is not narrowly \ntailored to serve state interests in public safety or rehabilitation.  \nA. There is a Fundamental Right to Freedom from Bodily Restraint  \n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that “freedom from \nimprisonment—from government custody, detention, or other forms of physical \nrestraint—lies at the heart of the liberty that [the due process clause] protects.” \nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 \n(1992) (“Freedom from bodily restraint has always been at the core of the liberty \nprotected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental action.”); Demore \nv. Kim, 538 U.S. 510 (2003) (the constitution “permits detention only where \n‘heightened, substantive due process scrutiny’ finds a ‘sufficiently compelling’ \ngovernmental need.”) (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 748 (1987)); \nReno, 507 U.S. at 316 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“The institutionalization of an \nadult by the government triggers heightened, substantive due process scrutiny.”)  \n  The fact that Plaintiffs have a term of MSR after their sentence of imprisonment \ndoes not negate their liberty interest in release into the community. In Murphy, this \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 24 of 35 PageID #:283\nCourt recognized that individuals in IDOC custody have a protectable “liberty \ninterest” in release from prison onto MSR once the Prisoner Review Board has \napproved them for release. Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 760 (N.D. Ill. \n2019) (concluding that “the language and structure of the supervised release system \nin Illinois creates an expectancy of release, which would entitle releasees to \nconditional liberty” once the PRB “granted the plaintiffs their release.”); see also \nMurdock v. Walker, No. 08 C 1142, 2014 WL 916992, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 10, 2014) \n(After the PRB approved prisoners for release “that approval [becomes] a form of \nstatutory liberty...”). Similarly, Courts have recognized that “a person serving a \nsentence of probation or parole in the community has a limited liberty interest in \nhis freedom that cannot be curtailed without the procedural protections of notice \nand hearing.” Werner v. Wall, 836 F.3d 751, 760 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing Gagnon v. \nScarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972)). \nB. The One-Per-Address Statute Is Not Narrowly Tailored to Meet a \nCompelling Government Interest \n \n  Narrow tailoring requires the government entity that seeks to restrict a person’s \nliberty to make a showing that its justification for the detention is compelling and \nthat the government interest served by the detention cannot be met without \ndetention. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 557 (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“In \nsum, due process requires a special justification for physical detention that \noutweighs the individual’s constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical \nrestraint as well as adequate procedural protections. There must be a sufficiently \ncompelling governmental interest to justify such an action, usually a punitive \n  21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 25 of 35 PageID #:284\ninterest in imprisoning the convicted criminal or a regulatory interest in \nforestalling danger to the community.”) (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690–691; \nFlores, 507 U.S. at 316 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Salerno, 481 U.S. at 748) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \n  On the record before this Court, Defendant cannot meet his burden to show that \nenforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute is an appropriately tailored means of \nachieving any government objective. This is so for at least seven reasons. \n1.  The Department has not put forth any evidence (or even argument) that \nthere’s a public safety or rehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address \nStatute. Over the course of the Murphy litigation, which has been ongoing for \nfour years and generated hundreds of pages of summary judgment briefing, \nthe IDOC never put forth a public safety or rehabilitative justification for the \nOne-Per-Address Statute. Similarly, in litigation of the three motions for \npreliminary injunctive relief in this case, the only justification the \nDepartment has offered for the One-Per-Address Statute is that IDOC has an \nobligation to enforce the statutes that the legislature has written;  \n \n2.  In his deposition in Murphy, when Deputy Chief Dixon was asked what the \nreason was for the Department’s application of the One-Per-Address Statute \nto individuals who seek to reside in trailer parks, he did not reference any \nsafety or rehabilitative purpose. Rather, he simply stated that the state police \nhad interpreted the Statute to apply to trailer parks and IDOC followed suit. \nSOF at ¶1; \n \n3.  There is evidence that allowing releasees to reside together reduces the \nincidence of re-offense and improves supervision. A Minnesota Department of \nCorrections report concluded that when releasees reside together, “closer \nsupervision is possible because travel time between offenders is reduced,” and \nreleasees “experience more visits from a supervising agent because agents for \nboth offenders visit the same property.” The report also noted that offenders \nwho reside together “tend to inform on each other when supervision \nrestrictions are violated or crimes are committed.” SOF at ¶2;  \n \nSimilarly, Bob McKelvey, the founder and manager of NewDay Apartments, \ntestified that in his experience “housing registrants at the same address \nallows for more effective (and cost-effective) law enforcement oversight” and \n“also allows registrants to police one another and share resources to better \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 26 of 35 PageID #:285\nsupport themselves, which ultimately helps them focus on the future and \nreduces recidivism.” SOF at ¶7. \n \n4.  The host sites at which Plaintiffs and members of the class seek to live \ncomply with all of the other restrictions imposed by Illinois law and IDOC \npolicy, including the restrictions set forth in 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10) (prohibiting any individual classified as a “child sex offender” from living \nwithin 500 feet of a school, playground, or daycare) and the prohibition on \nresiding at a host site where minor children reside;  \n \n5.  If the One-Per-Address Statute is eliminated, the IDOC will retain discretion \nto deny a host site if the reviewing parole agent determines the host site \nwould be unsafe or would not foster the parolee’s rehabilitation. See 730 ILCS \n5/3-3-7(b-1)(1), (15); \n \n6.  Releasees who reside at Wayside Cross, Jordan’s Dream, New Beginnings \nand New Day Apartments are required to abide by house rules and \nparticipate in structured, supervised programming that is designed to insure \ntheir compliance with parole conditions, foster their reintegration, and \nprevent re-offense. See SOF at ¶¶12, 14-16, 31-32, 36; \n \n7.  Plaintiffs released to host sites that do not comply with the One-Per-Address \nStatute will remain subject to all of the other constraints of MSR, including \nGPS monitoring; employment restrictions; drug testing; polygraph \nexaminations; sex offender therapy; regular reporting to their parole agents; \ncurfews; and any other conditions that the Department deems necessary to \nensure safety and limit risk. See 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7 (a) and (b-1)(1)-(18). \n \n  In its detention cases, the Supreme Court has stressed the importance of \nconfining restrictions on liberty to “a sphere of real need,” and has required the \nGovernment to prove “by clear and convincing evidence” that a detention is justified \nbased on “an identified and articulable threat to an individual or the community.” \nDemore, 538 U.S. at 550 (quoting Salerno, 481 U.S., at 748). Defendant has not \nshown and cannot show that there is a “real need” to detain in prison those \nindividuals who wish to reside at otherwise compliant host sites at which other \nindividuals who have been convicted of sex offenses also reside. Accordingly, the  \n  23 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 27 of 35 PageID #:286\nOne-Per-Address Statute does not survive strict scrutiny and should be found \nunconstitutional under the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nIII.  The One-Per-Address Statute Violates the Eighth Amendment and the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause  \n \n  In Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. 2019), this Court concluded \nthat it violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment to subject \nindividuals to indefinite incarceration solely because they cannot meet the host site \nrequirement, holding as follows:  \nAt the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is freedom \nfrom indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The Attorney General and \nDirector’s  current  application  of  the  host  site  requirement  results  in  the \ncontinued  deprivation  of  the  plaintiffs’  fundamental  rights  and  therefore \ncontravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \nthe United States. \n \nId. at 738. In particular, this Court concluded that the continued imprisonment \nof individuals who do not have the money or outside support to comply with the \nhost site requirement runs afoul of the Eighth Amendment and the Equal \nProtection Clause because their detention is solely “the consequence of [their] \nindigency, homelessness, and the attendant powerlessness to procure housing \nthat will satisfy the IDOC.” Id. at 756.  \n  For the members of the Barnes class who are impoverished and lack outside \nfinancial support, the One-Per-Address Statute is an insurmountable roadblock \ncutting them off from access to free or low cost housing that would enable them \nto secure their release. Thus, as shown below, the continued enforcement of the \n  24 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 28 of 35 PageID #:287\nstatute violates their rights under the Eighth Amendment and the Equal \nProtection Clause.  \nA. The One-Per-Address Statute Violates the Eighth Amendment \n  The Eighth Amendment “imposes substantive limits on what can be made \ncriminal and punished as such.” Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 667-668 (1977) \n(internal citations omitted). In particular, the Eighth Amendment forbids the \ngovernment from imposing criminal penalties that punish “status.” See Robinson v. \nCalifornia, 370 U.S. 660 (1962); Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514 (1968). In Robinson, \nthe Supreme Court struck down a California statute making it illegal to “be \naddicted to the use of narcotics,” Robinson, 370 U.S. at 660, as constituting cruel \nand unusual punishment because the statute punished the defendant solely for the \nstatus of being an addict and not for any particular conduct. In Powell, a plurality of \nthe Court upheld a Texas statute making it illegal to “be in a state of intoxication in \nany public place,” Powell, 392 U.S. at 516, despite evidence indicating that the \ndefendant was a chronic alcoholic, on the ground that the statute punished the \ndefendant’s conduct of being intoxicated in public and not his status as an alcoholic. \nAs this Court observed in its summary judgment decision in Murphy, “the relevant \ndistinction lies in applying criminal laws to punish conduct, which is \nconstitutionally proper, and applying criminal laws to punish status, which is \nconstitutionally improper.” 380 F.Supp.3d at 763. \n  In State v. Adams, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals applied Robinson \nand Powell in circumstances similar to those the Plaintiffs face here. The defendant \n  25 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 29 of 35 PageID #:288\nin Adams challenged the constitutionality of a statute that required people \nconvicted of sex offenses to provide the Alabama Department of Corrections “the \nactual address at which he or she will reside or live upon release” and provided that \nany individual who did not comply with the requirement to identify a residential \naddress would be “remanded to the custody of the sheriff of the county in which the \nviolation occurred.” Adams, 91 So.3d at 734. Adams was indigent and homeless and, \nas a result, was unable to comply with the statute, leading to his re-incarceration \nafter the completion of his prison sentence. The Adams court determined that the \nstatute violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual \npunishment because it “punishes the defendant solely for his status of being \nhomeless.” Id. at 739. Relying on Jones v. City of Los Angeles, 444 F.3d 1118 (9th \nCir. 2006), the Adams court found that “[r]ead together, [Powell and Robinson] \nstand for the proposition that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the \nEighth Amendment forbids punishing criminally not only a person’s pure status, \nbut also a person’s involuntary conduct that is inseparable from that person’s \nstatus.” Id. at 754. The court concluded that imprisoning Adams solely because of \nhis inability to afford housing essentially punished him for his status, writing as \nfollows: \n  The undisputed evidence ... established that Adams was indigent, that he \nhad no family or friends with whom he could live, and that, despite his \nefforts, he had not been accepted to any homeless shelter or halfway house \n... For Adams, then, the failure to provide an ‘actual address at which [he \nwould] reside or live’ ... was not voluntary conduct merely related to, or \nderivative from, the status of homelessness, but was entirely involuntary \nconduct that was inseparable from his status of homelessness. \n \n  26 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 30 of 35 PageID #:289\nId. \n  Applying these precedents in Murphy, this Court observed that because “it is \nvirtually impossible” for a homeless individual to comply with the host site \nrequirement, the IDOC’s application of the host site requirement to homeless \nindividuals “constitutes cruel and unusual punishment” in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment. Murphy, 380 F.Supp.3d at 764. \n  The same result is appropriate here. The One-Per-Address Statute inevitably \nresults in the continued imprisonment of homeless and indigent offenders beyond \nthe completion of their sentences of incarceration because it prohibits them from \nseeking release to all free and low-cost placements such as shelters, religious \nmissions, and halfway houses. But for the One-Per-Address Statute, indigent and \nhomeless individuals would be able to secure their release from prison to otherwise \ncompliant locations such as Wayside Cross Ministries or the units IDOC rents from \nNewDay Apartments.  \n  For example, Dana Monson is indigent and does not have family outside of \nprison who can offer him financial support or a place to live. SOF at ¶53. Monson \ncompleted his sentence of incarceration and was entitled to release from IDOC on \nMarch 25, 2012. Id. at ¶54. Because he lacked funds to secure approved housing, \nMonson remained incarcerated for more than eight additional years until May, 20 \n2020. Id. Because of the One-Per-Address Statute, Monson was not eligible for \nrelease to any free placement (such as a halfway house, shelter, or religious \nministry) because other individuals with sex offense convictions may also reside at \n  27 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 31 of 35 PageID #:290\nsuch locations. Id. at ¶55. Thus, Monson remained incarcerated until this Court \ngranted a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 22), which allowed him to be released to \nWayside Cross Ministries, where he now resides along with other individuals who \nare on MSR for sex offenses. Id. at ¶56.9  \n  Similarly, Plaintiff John Margarella is indigent. Id. at ¶57. His family was \nunable to take him in, and no one in his family had the funds to rent or buy a \nseparate place for him. Id. He completed his sentence of incarceration and was \nentitled to release on MSR in December 2013. Id. at ¶58. Because he lacked funds to \nsecure approved housing, Margarella remained incarcerated for more than six \nadditional years, until June 23, 2020. Id. Because of the One-Per-Address Statute, \nMargarella was not eligible for release to any free placement (such as a halfway \nhouse, shelter, or religious ministry) because other individuals with sex offense \nconvictions may also reside at such locations. Id. at ¶59. Thus, Margarella remained \nincarcerated until this Court granted a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 22), which \nallowed him to be released to one of the units IDOC leases from NewDay \nApartments where he now resides with Jerry Davis, another individual who is on \nMSR for a sex offense.10 Id. at ¶60. \n  For indigent individuals, their failure to find housing that complies with the \nOne-Per-Address Statute is not a voluntary act, but involuntary conduct \n \n9   Plaintiffs Corey Crowe, Fredrick Chamblis, and others who have now been released to \nWayside Cross Ministries are in the same situation. See SOF at ¶¶ 61-66.  \n \n10   Other Plaintiffs currently at NewDay Apartments, including J.D. Lindenmeier, Jerry \nDavis, and Stanley Meyer are in similar situations. See SOF at ¶¶ 67-69. \n  28 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 32 of 35 PageID #:291\ninseparable from their status as being homeless and indigent. Thus, continued \nenforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Eighth Amendment. \n  B. The One-Per-Address Statute Violates the Equal Protection Clause \n  The Equal Protection Clause “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. \n432, 439 (1985). There are two primary ways an equal protection violation occurs. \nOne is when the disparate treatment among similarly situated groups results in the \ndenial of a fundamental right. The other is when disparate treatment among \nsimilarly situated groups is based on a person’s membership in a “suspect” class. \nSrail v. Village of Lisle, Ill., 588 F.3d 940, 943 (7th Cir. 2009). Plaintiffs’ equal \nprotection claim rests on the first theory, namely, that the One-Per-Address Statute \ndenies Plaintiffs the fundamental right to be free from confinement based solely on \ntheir indigence. Where a challenged restriction impinges on a fundamental right, it \nis subject to strict scrutiny and can only survive if it is “suitably tailored to serve a \ncompelling state interest.” Cleburne at 440; see also Vision Church v. Vill. of Long \nGrove, 468 F.3d 975, 1000 (7th Cir. 2006) (“Government action [that] interferes with \na person’s fundamental rights” is subject to strict scrutiny.)  \n  In Murphy, this Court found that continued imprisonment of indigent \nindividuals who cannot afford housing violated the Equal Protection Clause because \nit “creates an illegal classification based on wealth, which indefinitely deprives the \nclass members of their liberty as a result of their incapacity to pay.” 380 F.Supp.3d \nat 759. \n  29 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 33 of 35 PageID #:292\n  The same result should occur here. The One-Per-Address Statute fails strict \nscrutiny because it draws a wealth-based classification that deprives indigent \nindividuals of a fundamental right (i.e., the right to be released from prison on MSR \nafter the completion of one’s sentence) and is not suitably tailored to serve any \ncompelling interest. \n1.  The Statute Discriminates Based on Wealth   \n  The record shows that the One-Per-Address Statute discriminates against the \npoor by making it impossible for indigent individuals to obtain housing and secure \ntheir release from prison.11 See SOF at ¶¶53-69 (Plaintiffs Monson, Margarella, \nCrowe, and Chamblis remained imprisoned well past their release dates until the \ncourt ordered relief from the One-Per-Address Statute that allowed them to be \nreleased to free placements at Wayside Cross Ministries and NewDay Apartments).  \n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down practices that deprive a person \nof liberty because of indigency. In Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), the Court \nfound that an Illinois rule permitting a criminal appeal only if a defendant could \npay for a trial transcript violated due process and equal protection. Likewise, in \nWilliams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235 (1970), the Court overturned an Illinois law that \npermitted extended prison sentences, beyond the statutory maximum, for those \nprisoners who could not pay a fine, writing that “[o]nce the State has defined the \nouter limits of incarceration necessary to satisfy its penological interests and \n \n11   The fact that the One-Per-Address Statute applies to all individuals who have been \nconvicted of sex offenses is of no consequence. A law that is “nondiscriminatory on its face \nmay be grossly discriminatory in its operation.” Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17, n. 11 \n(1956).  \n  30 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 34 of 35 PageID #:293\npolicies, it may not then subject a certain class of convicted defendants to a period of \nimprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of their indigency.” \nId. at 241-42.  \n2.  The Wealth-Based Distinction Does Not Serve a Compelling \nGovernment Interest \n \n  As this Court has already held in Murphy, keeping “homeless sex offenders \nlocked up (while non-indigent sex offenders roam free) has no reasonable relation to \npublic protection. Quite the contrary, ‘the condition at issue here—indigency—is \nitself no threat to the safety or welfare of society.’” 380 F. Supp. 3d at 756-57 \n(quoting Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 669 n. 9 (1983)); See also, Adams, 91 \nSo.3d at 741-42 (finding a state statute requiring sex offenders to provide a home \naddress prior to release violated the Equal Protection Clause because it “create[d] a \nclassification based on wealth, depriving a certain class of citizens indefinitely of \ntheir liberty as a result of their inability to pay.”) \n  The One-Per-Address Statute produces the same type of discrimination \ncondemned by the Supreme Court in Griffin and by this Court in Murphy—wealth-\nbased discrimination that deprives individuals of their fundamental rights solely \nbecause of their indigency. Thus, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on \ntheir claim that the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Equal Protection Clause.   \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this \nHonorable Court grant summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their claim that the One-\nPer-Address Statute violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n  31 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 32 Filed: 07/01/20 Page 35 of 35 PageID #:294\nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/ Adele D.

My name is Otis Williams. I am the founder and CEO of New Beginnings Recovery \nHomes Inc. (NBRHI). NBRHI is a Chicago private minority-based not-for-profit corporation that \nhas been in operation since 1993.  NBRHI provides affordable shared transitional housing, \nsocial, supportive and case management services to people transitioning from prison to the \ncommunity especially, individuals who are experiencing housing insecurity, lacking gainful \nemployment and food as well as individuals who are in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse. \n2.  NBHRI leases five buildings on the south side of Chicago at which it provides dormitory \nstyle or semi-private shared living accommodations.  Residents at NBHRI buildings receive \nmeals and have access to services including peer support groups, counseling with licensed \nproviders and case management.   Our properties are sex offender compliant with the housing \nrestrictions that prohibit people who have been convicted of sex offenses from living within 500 \nfeet of schools, daycares or playgrounds.  Each building has 24-hour a day security and \nstructured supervision for residents.  Our goal is to help our residents become positive, \nproductive citizens.  We have significant experience with housing sex offenders who are being \nreleased from prison and assisting with their successful transition back into the community.  \n3.  Program participants agree to abide by the rules of our program, including adherence \nto a curfew, no use of drugs or alcohol and no minors or women on the premises of our \nresidential buildings. \n4.  We currently are currently housing 12 individuals on mandatory supervised release \nwho have been convicted of sex offenses at our buildings located at 6655 S Perry Chicago, IL \n60621 and 11934 S. Lowe Chicago Illinois, 60628. These parolees are adjusting well to being on \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-1 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:315\nMSR in the community and we are assisting them with obtaining identification, searching for \njobs, and compliance with the terms of their supervision.  \n5.  We are aware that individuals on parole for a sex offense and are currently legally \nprohibited from living at the same address as another person with a sex offense conviction. If \nthe restriction on housing more than one sex offender at the same address is eliminated, we \nare willing and able to house additional parolees at these and other properties in the future, \nspace permitting.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n___________________ \nOtis J. Williams            July 1, 2020       \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-2 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:316\nDeclaration of Jonathan Beall \n1.  My name is Jonathan Beall. I am the program director of the Master’s Touch Ministry, \na division of Wayside Cross Ministries.  \n2.  Wayside Cross Ministries is a Christ-centered Bible-based residential program that has \noperated in Aurora, Illinois, for more than 90 years. \n3.  The Master’s Touch Ministry is a life-transformation program for men with various \ndestructive behaviors not limited to drug and alcohol addiction. The program offers room and \nboard at no cost, and empowers its participants to change their lives through the Gospel of \nChrist, prayer, Bible study, daily chapel services, mentoring with local church and business \nleaders, and work rehabilitation programs.  \n4.  It takes a minimum of seven months for a resident to complete the Master’s Touch \nMinistry program. The end goal of the program is to give the men the tools they need to live \nhealthy, law abiding lives through trust in Jesus Christ for their faith and conduct.  \n5.  Wayside Cross currently has fourteen residents in the Master’s Touch Ministry who \nare on parole from the Illinois Department of Corrections. Wayside Cross provides room and \nboard to these individuals at no cost to them or to the IDOC. Each of these individuals has \nsuccessfully registered with the Aurora Police Department. \n6.  The Master’s Touch Ministry is a highly structured program with a strict code of \nconduct, which includes adherence to a curfew, attendance at scheduled Bible study and \nchurch services, no use of drugs or alcohol, refraining from the use of profane or abusive \nlanguage, listening only to music that glorifies God, and only using technology in a manner that \nconforms to God’s high standards. Acceptance into the program is at the sole discretion of the \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-2 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:317\nDirector of Master’s Touch. Successful completion of the program hinges on successful random \ndrug and alcohol tests, active participation in programming, as well as adherence to all the rules \nof Master’s Touch. \n7.  Because of its proximity to McCarty Park, Wayside Cross cannot accept into its \nprogram individuals who are classified as “child sex offenders,” but it can accept individuals \nwhose offenses involved an adult victim. \n8.  The participants in the Master’s Touch Ministry all reside together in a dormitory \nsetting at Wayside Cross, located at 215 E. New York Street in Aurora.   \n9.  The Master’s Touch Ministry is currently near its capacity for program participants. But \nin the future, when space in the building and in the program permits, we are willing to accept \nother individuals on mandatory supervised release from the Illinois Department of Corrections \nwho meet our program criteria, pending the parolee’s successful completion of a phone \nscreening interview.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n_________________      _7_-_1_-2_0______ \nJonathan Beall       Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-3 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:318\nDeclaration of Bob McKelvey \n \n1.  My name is Bob McKelvey. I am the founder and Manager of NewDay Apartments \nLLC.  \n2.  NewDay Apartments has partnered with the Illinois Department of Corrections to \nprovide housing to individuals with sex offense convictions being released from prison onto \nsupervised release.  \n3.  NewDay Apartments currently owns eight properties which are more than 500 feet \naway from any schools, playgrounds and/or daycare centers. NewDay Apartments currently \nleases four properties to the Illinois Department of Corrections. Two properties are \nreserved for private-pay registrants.  One unit currently houses a non-registrant but will be \navailable to house registrants when the current tenant moves out.  One property houses \nseven registrants who are neither on parole nor probation. \n4.  There are currently seven parolees living in the four properties IDOC leases from \nNewDay. Under current law, we are limited to housing four registrant-parolees in these \nunits because we are permitted to have a maximum of one registrant-parolee per address \n(unless a court approves otherwise). \n5.  The permission of the court to house additional registrants at the same address has \nallowed NewDay to quickly house and provide services for additional parolees in these \nunits. That number will increase once current, non-registrant tenants move out over time.  \n6.  NewDay is expanding despite the current pandemic.  We plan to double the number \nof registrant units available year-over-year for at least the next three years.  The long term \ngoal of NewDay is to become the #1 provider of safe, affordable registrant housing in the \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-3 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:319\nUnited States. Permitting multiple registrant-parolees at the same address would easily \ndouble the number of available units compared to the current one-per-address rule, and \nwould make the housing we provide more affordable for our registrant-tenants. \n7.  While our housing obviously helps registrants, NewDay's primary purpose is to keep \ncommunities safe by housing registrants responsibly. To-date, we have a 0% recidivism rate \namong our registrant tenants. It is our experience that housing registrants at the same address \nallows for more effective (and cost-effective) law enforcement oversight. It also allows \nregistrants to police one another and share resources to better support themselves, which \nultimately helps them focus on the future and reduce recidivism. \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements \nare true and correct to the best of my ability. \n \n__________________         __7_-1_-_2_0____________ \nBob McKelvey             Date \nManager, NewDay Apartments LLC               \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-4 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:320\nDeclaration of James Cockrell \n1.  My name is James Cockrell. I am a pastor with Abundant Faith Ministries in Springfield, \nIllinois.

Our program offers individuals one month rent-free, during which time we assist the \nindividual with finding employment. We have a relationship with an employer near Springfield \nthat is willing to hire individuals with sex offense convictions. We provide our residents a \nshuttle to and from this job.  \n4.  Once someone is working, we charge $300/month for their continued residence in our \nhousing, or in the alternative, we assist them with finding their own housing.  \n5.  We currently have three openings in our building and are prepared to accept three \nindividuals who are on mandatory supervised release if the Department of Corrections will \napprove them for release to our address.  \n6.  I have a personal relationship with Henry Smith (IDOC Number R12201), who is \nimprisoned in Jacksonville Correctional Center. We are prepared to accept him to reside at  \n1611 E.

I am also a now-retired inactive member of the State \nBar of California and a member of the bar of various California federal district courts, the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court.  I am familiar with the facts \nstated herein and could testify about them if called as a witness. \n2.  I am the brother of Alvin Lee Goldberg, who pleaded guilty in November of 2012 to \ntwo offenses:  PRED CRIM SEX ASLT/VICTIM <13; and AGG CRIM SEX ABUSE/FAMILY.  My \nbrother will be 81 on May 14 of this year. \n3.  My brother currently is an inmate at the Taylorville Correctional Center, 1144 Illinois \nRte 29, Taylorville IL 62568. His IDOC number is M36526.  He was scheduled for release in \nNovember of 2018, subject to required mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) with a discharge \ndate of three years to life.  He is actively looking for an apartment to move to that is acceptable \nto the IDOC while he is on MSR. \n4.  I have applied on behalf of my brother to NewDay Apartments, an organization that \nrents apartments to convicted sex offenders.  I have spoken with their representatives.

\nissues regarding residential locations of level three sex offenders (see Appendix A: Minnesota \nSession Laws 2002, Chapter 385, Sec. 10). \n \n \nOffender Characteristics \n \nAs of December 31, 2002, there are 329 designated level three offenders in Minnesota.  Of those, \n97 are in residential settings in a Minnesota community.  All are male.  Fifty of those live in \nHennepin County, 14 in Ramsey County, six in Olmsted County, and four in St. Louis County.  \nTwenty-three live elsewhere, with no county having more than two. \n \n \nIssues \n \nLegislation mandating this report directed the commissioner of corrections to report on eight is-\nsues concerning level three sex offenders.  This section of the report responds to that directive. \n  \n1.  How level three offenders re-enter the community, including how housing and jobs are \nfound and the role that corrections agents play in helping an offender find housing and \njobs. \n \n  The specific resource for offenders is the institutional caseworker at each Minnesota correc-\ntional facility (MCF).  While level three offenders may be released from any correctional fa-\ncility, the majority of releases are done from the MCF-Lino Lakes.  The MCF-Moose Lake, \nMCF-Rush City, and MCF-Stillwater are the release institutions for the greatest number of \nremaining releasees. \n \n  In anticipation of release, the caseworker will work with the offender on transition plans.  \nThis may include a three-day workshop on effective transition from incarceration.  Topics \ncovered include residential and job issues.  In addition, the transitions program will cover re-\nlated areas of identification, money management, education, health and life skills, fam-\nily/friend reunification and relationships, and living under supervision.  For those leaving to a \nsupervised release status, the caseworker will coordinate with the prospective supervising \nagent on a re-entry plan.  That re-entry plan must include an acceptable residence.  At that \ntime, special conditions may be applied to the supervision plan.  Special conditions may in-\nclude restrictions on proximity to victims, minors, or vulnerable adults.  Special conditions \nare applied on an individual basis to each offender.  Common conditions subject to agent ap-\nproval may be: \n \na)  No residence in a building where children are present; \nb)  No direct or indirect contact with minors; \nc)  No direct or indirect contact with vulnerable adults; \nd)  No direct or indirect contact with victims; \ne)  No membership in groups or organizations; \n  1\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:334\nf)  Must not be in any location where children or minors tend to congregate; or \ng)  Other variations as determined by the supervising agent. \n \n  Residential placement is dependent on the offender’s personal and financial resources in the \ncommunity.  The caseworker and agent may be able to help the offender find placement, but \nlimited opportunities exist if an acceptable supervision location is not provided by the of-\nfender. \n \n  Halfway house placement is one of the most common first steps in the transition, but there \nare a limited number of beds available at those placements.  St. Paul, Minneapolis, Golden \nValley, and Duluth each provide a halfway house facility but fall far short in meeting the \nhousing needs of all sex offenders in need of transitional housing.  These halfway houses \nprovide not only for level three offenders but also level two and one offenders as well as non-\nsex offenders in need of such transition (primarily person offenders convicted of such crimes \nas Assault, Aggravated Robbery, Murder, etc.).  Approximately 60 percent of level three \npredatory offenders are first released to a halfway house placement. \n \n  Transition services for offenders leaving prison at expiration of sentence are even more lim-\nited.  These offenders leave an MCF without supervision.  They are required to register an \naddress with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) but receive no assistance other \nthan that provided by a caseworker prior to release.  Keeping track of these offenders is diffi-\ncult due to their often transient housing options.  Anecdotally, it appears that a small number \n(at least 12) of level three offenders have left Minnesota once their sentences expired, and \nseveral other level three offenders have come out of compliance with registration after the \nexpiration of their sentences (although it appears they have stayed in Minnesota).  \n \n  Generally, the housing options available to offenders are limited and well known to supervis-\ning agents.  Specific properties and landlords are amenable to providing housing for level \nthree offenders.  In Minneapolis, certain landlords appear to have developed a specialty in \nrenting to level three offenders.  This has resulted in a concentration of level three offenders \nin some areas of the city.  According to corrections agents, when a landlord rents one unit of \na duplex to a level three offender, occupants of the other unit feel uncomfortable and seek \nother housing.  The resulting vacancy is likely to be filled by another level three (or lower \nlevel) sex offender.  Subsequent vacancies are also filled by sex offenders.  The landlords \nthen post information about vacancies at halfway houses, and level three offenders learn \nabout potential openings through word of mouth.  Such housing is a limited and finite re-\nsource in Minneapolis but can be even scarcer in other counties where the placement of level \ntwo offenders causes as much of a problem. \n \n  Job search is another topic covered in the transition program but, again, the offender bears \nmost of the responsibility for finding employment.  Halfway house placement provides the \nbest transition period for job search.  Without connections to a previous employer or family \nassistance, most employment tends to be in low-pay, non-public service jobs.  Knowledge of \nthe offender’s level three status is an impediment to seeking employment.  Fear of liability if \nre-offense occurs is a common roadblock to employer willingness to hire offenders.  A com-\nmon release condition is that offenders must maintain 40 hours per week of work or other \nproductive activity.  Corrections agents become aware of employers who are willing to hire \nex-inmates, including sex offenders.  If an offender has difficulty obtaining employment on \nhis or her own, the agent will refer the offender to one of these employers.   \n \n  2\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:335\n  In meetings and discussions with community corrections agents working throughout Minne-\nsota, the common issue expressed was the ever-increasing difficulty in procuring residences \nand employment by level three offenders.  The close connection between residence and job \nmeans that limiting residential options concurrently limits job options.  For example, if of-\nfenders are required because of residential restrictions to live in largely unpopulated areas, it \nis likely that they will have difficulty securing employment as many do not own automobiles \n(and even have release conditions prohibiting ownership).   \n \n  Expansion of halfway house beds and expansion of emergency housing funds were most \ncommonly cited as needs when planning for level three releases and moves.  Landlords will-\ning to rent to a level three offender are non-existent in many communities, according to cor-\nrections agents. \n \nRecent release plans for selected level three offenders: \n \na)  Offender A \nReleased in early 2002 (expiration of sentence).  Release address was his parent’s home \nin St. Paul.  Maintained that address until mid 2002.  This initial placement with a family \nmember is often the ideal placement for transition.  Upon leaving that residence, he has \nbeen in a transient stage to this date.  Registered address was in an outer-ring suburb for \none day, the Minneapolis Salvation Army for 18 days, a Bloomington apartment for 19 \ndays, another metro address for 11 days, South Minneapolis for 16 days, an inner ring \nsuburban motel for seven days, and at a downtown St. Paul boarding house for the last 30 \ndays.  He has spoken with local law enforcement about living under a bridge.  He has \nmade numerous complaints about inability to find acceptable housing of any kind.  He \nhas done a fairly good job of maintaining his registration, but constant moving makes \ntracking difficult. \n  \nb)  Offender B \nReleased in mid 2002 (intensive supervised release).  His release was to a halfway house \nfrom which he absconded in late 2002.  He was apprehended and returned to the MCF-\nLino Lakes in the same month.  He was then released in one month later (expiration of \nsentence).  He was unable to provide a release address prior to release and has no support \nnetwork.  His responsibility for registration was explained to him.  He did provide notice \nof a shelter address in Minneapolis for the first night.  He moved to a second shelter the \nsecond night and is now officially registered with the BCA as “homeless.” \n \nc)  Offender C \nReleased in late 2002 (intensive supervised release).  Initial release plan was to a friend’s \nhouse in rural Minnesota.  Due to neighborhood pressure, the invitation was rescinded.  \nHis release address then became a transitional motel in a southeastern Minnesota city.  \nHis plan is to move into a house he owns in southeastern Minnesota as soon as the cur-\nrent tenant vacates the property.  His ownership of property has solved this housing issue. \n  \nd)  Offender D \nReleased in mid 2000 (intensive supervised release).  His release was to a halfway house.  \nHe then moved to South Minneapolis in early 2001.  He moved to a trailer park in an \nouter-ring suburb two months later.  He then purchased rural property in an outstate  \n \n(revised 2/04)\n  3\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:336\ncounty.  He was returned to prison for violating a release condition and was released \nagain in late 2002, to his rural property.  With financial resources available, he has been \nable to provide his own housing. \n \ne)  Offender E \nReleased in mid 2000 (intensive supervised release) to a halfway house.  Two months \nlater, he moved into the community in North Minneapolis.  This is one of the limited \nnumber of rental properties available to level three offenders.  In early 2001 he registered \nhis address as his father’s home but was infrequently there.  His release was revoked two \nmonths later, due to use of chemicals.  He was again released in mid 2001, to his father’s \nhome in Minneapolis.  He left his father’s home two months later.  He registered in St. \nPaul for two weeks before returning to a North Minneapolis residence and then eventu-\nally registered at his father’s house once again in early 2002.  That same month, his sen-\ntence expired and he was no longer on supervision.  Since that time, while he has been \nregistered at his father’s address, most contacts with police have pointed to a status as \nhomeless. \n \n \n2.  Statewide locations and concentrations of the level three offenders.   \n \n  As of December 31, 2002, there were 97 level three offenders in residential locations in Min-\nnesota.  Of these, 50 were in Hennepin County, 14 were in Ramsey County, and 33 others \nwere scattered in other counties.  Olmsted County had six level three offenders and St. Louis \nCounty had four; they were the only counties other than Hennepin and Ramsey with more \nthan two level three offenders (see maps for locations, Appendices B-1 to B-4). \n \n \n3.  Effects of having the offenders live in close proximity to one another.   \n \n  There have been 13 level three offenders released in 1997, 1998, or 1999 who are known to \nhave been re-arrested for a new sex offense by March 2002.  Each case has been reviewed to \ndetermine the offender’s circumstances at the time of the new sex offense.  This includes \nexamining whether the re-offense was related to the offender’s proximity to a school or park, \nand whether the offender was living with another sex offender at the time that he re-offended.  \nEach case is summarized below. \n \nLevel three offenders released from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 1999, who \nhave been rearrested for a new sex offense: \n \na)  Offender F \nReleased in early 1997 (he was previously released in mid 1994, prior to notification, but \nwas re-incarcerated for a serious release violation and served an additional two years).  \nHe had been referred for civil commitment, but Hennepin County chose not to pursue the \ncase.  He was re-released twice and re-incarcerated both times before he was released at \nthe expiration of his sentence in late 1997.  He re-offended in early 1998, against his live-\nin girlfriend.  He was intoxicated and demanded that she have sex with him.  When she \nrefused, he slapped her in the face and raped her.  He was registered as living at an ad-\ndress in Minneapolis, and the offense occurred at that location.  He was not living with  \n \n(revised 2/04)\n  4\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:337\nanother sex offender at the time of the offense.  He was sentenced to 90 months in prison \nand was identified as a Minnesota Sex Offender Program-DOC (MSOP-DOC) referral.  \nHe has been in treatment at the MSOP-DOC site since late 2001. \n \nb)  Offender G \nReleased in early 1997 to the custody of a southwestern Minnesota county and placed in \nthe county jail.  He had been referred for civil commitment, and the county attorney was \ndeliberating on whether to pursue commitment.  This offender sexually assaulted a fellow \ninmate at the jail the following month.  He pled guilty to 4th Degree Criminal Sexual \nConduct (CSC) and received a sentence of 60 months.  He has since stipulated to being a \nSexually Dangerous Person and has been released to the custody of the Department of \nHuman Services (DHS).  He was incarcerated at the time of the offense, but it is unclear \nif any of his fellow inmates at the time were sex offenders. \n \nc)  Offender H \nReleased in early 1997, at the expiration of his sentence.  He sought to have his risk level \nreduced by administrative review but was denied.  He had been referred for civil com-\nmitment, but Hennepin County determined it was unlikely they could prove that he met \ncommitment criteria.  He was rearrested and charged with 5th Degree CSC for an offense \nthat occurred in the following month.  At the time, this offender had two addresses regis-\ntered with the BCA: in South Minneapolis and a rural route address in a small town in the \nsoutheastern region of the state.  It appears that he was not living with another sex of-\nfender.  His re-offense was committed in downtown Minneapolis.  He was in a bookstore \nwhere he harassed two separate victims –  a juvenile female and an adult female.  He was \nintoxicated.  In both cases he grabbed the breast of the victim, but the victims were able \nto escape.  The offender was arrested at the scene, ironically by the lieutenant in charge \nof Minneapolis’ community notification at the time.  He received a sentence to the county \nworkhouse.  He was re-incarcerated for Possession of Controlled Substance, 5th Degree, \nin mid 2000 and was again referred to Hennepin County for civil commitment   Again, \nHennepin County determined it was unlikely they could prove that he met commitment \ncriteria.  He is reportedly now living in Chicago. \n \nd)  Offender I \nReleased in mid 1997 to a halfway house.  He had been referred for civil commitment, \nbut Hennepin County determined it was unlikely they could prove that he met commit-\nment criteria.  While at the halfway house during the following month, this offender fon-\ndled the genitals of a fellow resident.  There were other level three offender residents at \nthe halfway house at the time of his re-offense.  He was convicted of 4th Degree CSC and \nreceived a sentence of 36 months.  At the same time there were allegations that he had \nfondled the genitals of a 13-year-old family member, but he was not convicted of this.  \nHe has since been re-released to the community in mid 1999 and has apparently not been \narrested for a new sex offense since that time. \n \ne)  Offender J \nReleased in mid 1997, but detained until early 1998 at the Minnesota Security Hospital \nwhile he was undergoing a civil commitment trial.  He was found not to meet the criteria \nfor commitment and was released to a South Minneapolis address (his sentence had ex-\npired in late 1997).  He left Minneapolis in early 1998 and lived in New Mexico for six  \n \n(revised 2/04)\n  5\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:338\nmonths.  He then relocated to Nebraska where he was arrested for molesting children (re-\nports are that it was in a Greyhound Bus Station).  He was not known to be living with \nanother sex offender at the time of this offense.  He was convicted of Sexual Assault on a \nChild and received a sentence of one year, eight months to five years.  He was impris-\noned in Nebraska from late 1998 until his mandatory release date in late 2000.  He is cur-\nrently registered as living in Nebraska. \n \nf)  Offender K \nReleased in early 1998.  Absconded from supervision in early 1999 and reincarcerated \nwithin 30 days.  Not referred for civil commitment either time.  Released again in late \n2000.  In early 2001, found to be in possession of child pornography involving children \nas young as three to five years old.  Supervising agent made unannounced visit to his \nresidence and found a videotape containing child pornography.  Offender had subscribed \nto a Web TV service (without permission of agent) and recorded the videotape.  He was \nliving with a level two sex offender at the time.  This roommate provided information to \nhis therapist, who passed it along to his supervising agent, which led to discovery of the \nsexually-explicit material.  He absconded again but was apprehended within two weeks.  \nHe pled guilty to three counts of Possession of Pornographic Work Involving Minors and \nreceived a sentence of 36 months.  He is currently incarcerated with an expected release \ndate of early 2004.  He is currently involved in treatment at the MSOP-DOC site. \n \ng)  Offender L \nReleased in early 1998 (expiration of sentence).  Referred for civil commitment, but \nRamsey County determined it was unlikely they could prove he met commitment criteria.  \nRearrested in late1998 and convicted of False Imprisonment in early 1999.  Registered as \nliving in southwestern Minnesota at the time of the offense.  He was not living with an-\nother sex offender.  The offense occurred in his house.  The victim (an adult female ac-\nquaintance) voluntarily entered his apartment after they had been out drinking.  She lay \ndown on the bed where the offender coerced her to take off her clothes, after which she \nfell asleep.  She awoke to find he had tied her hands and legs to the bed.  He threatened to \nrape her but didn’t.  He did slap the victim across the face and struck her breast.  He was \nsentenced to 19 months but was civilly committed upon his release from prison. \n \nh)  Offender M  \nReleased in late 1998; sentence expired two months later.  Referred for civil commitment \nto Hennepin County, but they determined it was unlikely they could prove he met com-\nmitment criteria.  Rearrested in late 1999, after exposing himself to four female children \n(ages four to eight).  He called the children over to his truck and identified himself as a \npoliceman, saying he was looking for a suspect.  He opened the door and exposed himself \nto the children.  He had reportedly been driving around the neighborhood during the \nsummer and fall months watching children.  Offenses were committed in Northeast Min-\nneapolis; he was living in South Minneapolis at the time.  Unknown if he was living with \nanother sex offender at time of the offense.  Convicted of felony-level 5th Degree CSC \nand sentenced to 43 months in prison.  Reincarcerated in early 2000, and released 26 \nmonths later in early 2002, when his release date was reached.  Currently on intensive \nsupervised release and living in North Minneapolis.  Again referred for civil commitment \nto Hennepin County, but they determined it was unlikely they could prove he met com-\nmitment criteria. \n \n(revised 2/04) \n  6\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:339\ni)  Offender N \nReleased in late 1999 and returned to prison twice on technical violations.  He was not re-\nferred for civil commitment and sought by administrative review to have his risk level \nlowered, but his request was denied.  He was most recently released in late 2000 to inten-\nsive supervised release.  Three months later, in early 2001, he abducted a 17-year-old fe-\nmale stranger and sexually assaulted her.  He was registered as living in South Minneapo-\nlis.  He was not living with another sex offender.  The offense occurred in a neighbor-\nhood a couple of miles south of the offender’s residence.  He has been convicted of 1st \nDegree CSC and recently received the statutory maximum sentence of 30 years. \n \nj)  Offender O \nReleased in late 1998 but immediately placed at the MSOP after being civilly committed.  \nHe was arrested for 3rd Degree CSC in mid 2001 for sexually assaulting a fellow resident \nof the MSOP.  It appears that he was never convicted of this offense but instead was re-\nturned to MSOP where he remains today.  He was incarcerated with other sex offenders \nat the time of his offense. \n  \nk)  Offender P \nReleased in late 1998 at expiration of sentence.  He was not referred for civil commit-\nment.  In mid 2000 he requested that his risk level be lowered but withdrew this request \nafter finding out that the End of Confinement Review Committee (ECRC) had received a \nrecommendation from a sex offender treatment professional that his risk level not be \nlowered.  He was rearrested in early 2001 and convicted of 1st Degree CSC in 2001.  He \nwas registered as living in outstate Minnesota at the time of the offense.  He was not liv-\ning with another sex offender.  The offense occurred in his house.  He was allowed access \nto the victims by the victims’ parent/family.  He was sentenced to 144 months in prison \nand is currently at the MSOP-DOC site. \n \nl)  Offender Q \nReleased in late 1999.  He had been referred for civil commitment, but Hennepin County \ndetermined it was unlikely they could prove that he met commitment criteria.  He was re-\nincarcerated on three occasions after violating the conditions of his release.  His most re-\ncent release was in early 2002, and his sentence expired the following month.  Later that \nsame month he was arrested after having accosted a female stranger and attempted to \nkidnap and possibly sexually assault her.  The offense occurred near downtown Minnea-\npolis; he was registered as living in North Minneapolis at the time of the offense.  He has \nbeen convicted of 4th Degree CSC but has not yet been sentenced.  The Hennepin County \nAttorney is preparing to ask the judge to sentence this offender to more than the 10-year \nstatutory maximum sentence for 4th Degree CSC by recommending that he be sentenced \nunder the Patterned Sex Offender statute. \n \nm) Offender R \nReleased as a level two offender in late 1999, but due to his extensive history (more than \n20 sex offense convictions, all for indecent exposure, mostly misdemeanors and gross \nmisdemeanors), he was warned by the ECRC that any violation, especially for a new sex-\nrelated offense, would likely result in an increase in his risk level.  He was not referred \nfor civil commitment, as courts have on more than one occasion rejected commitment of \noffenders whose history is exclusively “hands-off” sex offending.  His sentence expired  \n \n(revised 2/04)\n  7\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:340\nin late December, but he had already been arrested five months earlier for another Inde-\ncent Exposure offense against children.  At the time he was registered as residing in \nNortheast Minneapolis.  He was not living with another sex offender at the time of the of-\nfense.  The offense occurred in Fridley, approximately four miles from his residence.  He \nwas sentenced to 16 months in prison for Attempted 5th Degree CSC and was assigned \nrisk level three in early 2001.  He was released in mid 2001.  He was going to appeal his \nrisk level but was again arrested for a gross misdemeanor exposure and was confined in \nthe Hennepin County Workhouse until late 2002.  Since that time he has returned to his \nNortheast Minneapolis address. \n \n \n \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative effect related to a \nlevel three offender living with another sex offender.  In fact, supervision agents in both \nHennepin and Ramsey County have noted benefits from having more than one level three of-\nfender living in one location.  Closer supervision is possible because travel time between of-\nfenders is reduced.  Also, level three offenders who live with other level three offenders ex-\nperience more visits from a supervising agent because agents for both offenders visit the \nsame property.  Finally, offenders tend to inform on each other when supervision restrictions \nare violated or crimes are committed.  There is one case described above of an offender who \nre-offended by downloading child pornography from a Web TV service that was discovered \nonly after the offender’s roommate (a sex offender) told his therapist about the existence of \nthe unapproved Web TV equipment in the house. \n \nVoluntary relocations of neighborhood residents have not been evident, but real estate agents \nreport that sale of properties are limited by any negative information about a neighborhood.  \nThis may involve the perception of a high concentration of level three offenders but can also \ninclude information that suggests a neighborhood is, in general, a high-crime area in which \ngang activities are prevalent and drug dealing takes place on street.  Discussions with real es-\ntate agents indicated that the presence of level three sex offenders tends to have the greatest \neffect on prospective buyers with young children. \n \nAt a December 2002 community meeting, residents of the Phillips neighborhood in South \nMinneapolis expressed frustration with the concentration of sex offenders in their neighbor-\nhood.  Many stated that their neighborhood is always first to get treatment centers and hous-\ning for social problems.  The concentration of sex offenders is just one of many concentration \nissues for these residents.  An additional problem expressed was that once a neighborhood \ndevelops a reputation for being a focus area for this type of housing and treatment, it is diffi-\ncult to maintain housing and economic stability. \n \nThis meeting was attended by residents of both the Phillips and Jordan neighborhoods as well \nas members of the Minneapolis City Council and Minnesota Legislature.  Representatives \nfrom the Department of Corrections (DOC), Hennepin County Community Corrections, and  \n \n \n(revised 2/04)\n  8\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:341\nthe Minneapolis Police Department were present to explain the roles of their organizations in \nfulfilling responsibilities under the community notification law and to listen to the concerns \nof residents.  A map was produced detailing residency patterns of all offenders on probation \nand supervised release in Minneapolis that revealed a similarity to the residency patterns of \nlevel three offenders as displayed in Appendix B-3. \n \nBased on the examination of level three re-offenders, there were no examples that residential \nproximity to a park or school was a contributing factor in any of the sexual re-offenses noted \nabove.  Enhanced safety due to proximity restrictions may be a comfort factor for the general \npublic, but it does not have any basis in fact.   The two level three offenders described above \nwhose re-offenses took place near parks both drove from their residences to park areas that \nwere several miles away.  Because neither was under supervision, there were no supervision \nconditions that would prohibit them from driving near parks.  Based on these cases, it ap-\npears that a sex offender attracted to such locations for purposes of committing a crime is \nmore likely to travel to another neighborhood in order to act in secret rather than in a \nneighborhood where his or her picture is well known. \n \n \n4.  Efforts to mitigate the concentration of the offenders, especially with regard to proximity to \nschools.   \n \nAccording to Minnesota Statute §244.052, subdivision 4a, “the agency responsible for the of-\nfender’s supervision shall take into consideration the proximity of the offender’s residence to \nthat of other level three offenders and proximity to schools and, to the greatest extent feasi-\nble, shall mitigate the concentration of level three offenders and concentration of level three \noffenders near schools.”  Because of limited placement options, rarely does a supervising \nagency have a choice between two separate placements for an offender that would allow \nmitigation of the concentration of level three offenders near schools or other level three of-\nfenders to be taken into consideration.  Mitigation of concentration of and proximity to \nschools can be a factor if two essentially equal placement options are available.  If on an in-\ndividual basis supervision restrictions preclude location near schools, then that is taken into \naccount as a high priority factor.  So far, there has not been one example of a level three of-\nfender re-offending at a nearby school. \n \n \n5.  Likely effects of a policy requiring that offenders live a certain distance from schools.   \n \nResidential choices are already limited under current statutes that do not prohibit level three \noffenders from living near schools.  Additional restrictions would severely affect already \nmeager placement choices.  Minneapolis and St. Paul have a well-disbursed system of \nneighborhood schools that would create a restriction on the majority of residential property in \nboth cities.  (See Appendices C-1 and C-2 for a map of Minneapolis that indicates areas in \nwhich residence of level three offenders would be prohibited if a 1,500-foot restriction were \nto become law.)  Having such restrictions in the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul would \nlikely force level three offenders to move to more rural areas that would not contain nearby \nschools and parks but would pose other problems, such as a high concentration of offenders \nwith no ties to the community; isolation; lack of work, education, and treatment options; and \nan increase in the distance traveled by agents who supervise offenders.  Again, no evidence \npoints to any effect on offense rates of school proximity residential restrictions. \n  9\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:342\n6.  Likely effects of a policy requiring that offenders not live within a certain distance of each \nother.   \n \nIn Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Rochester there are some concentrated areas where offenders \nlive together or in the same building.  Of the 50 level three offenders living in Hennepin \nCounty as of December 31, 2002, 30 lived in just three zip codes.  A proximity restriction \nwould mean that 15 to 20 of these offenders would have to relocate or face being sanctioned \nunder the law.  Given the current difficulty that a single offender has in finding placement, it \nis highly likely that many of these offenders would become transient, which would severely \nrestrict an agent’s ability to closely supervise their activities. \n \n \n7.  Restricted zones that would result if a 1,500-foot proximity restriction were adopted in \nrelation to schools, parks, and other offenders.   \n \nAdoption of a 1,500-foot restriction would exclude every residential area of Minneapolis and \nSt. Paul with minor exceptions.  (See map of Minneapolis school and park zones, Appendices \nC-1, C-2, and C-3).  Again, the well-disbursed location of schools and parks in both cities \nwould lead to overlapping restriction zones that essentially forbid any residential options in \neither city. \n \n \n8.  Policies adopted by other states relating to the mitigating concentration of sex offenders. \n \nIowa and Alabama are two states with general proximity restrictions on the location of sex \noffenders (see Appendices E and F).  \n \nAlabama originally set a 2,000-foot proximity restriction from schools.  This was amended in \n2001 to a 1,000-foot restriction, as of July 1, 2002.  It appears that this law has not yet been \nenforced. \n \nIowa adopted Senate File 2197 in May 2002 with an effective date of July 1, 2002.  The law \nincludes a 2,000-foot proximity restriction from schools and child care facilities for any of-\nfender who offended against a minor.  This has severely restricted residential options, espe-\ncially in urban areas.  In October 2002, the first charge under this law was made.  The of-\nfender was living within 2,000 feet of a school and several registered child care centers. \n \nAdditional information on Minneapolis child care centers is attached (Appendix D). \n \nOther states have held to the position that, except for court-ordered restrictions, the state has \nno authority to impose residency or proximity restrictions. \n \n \n  10\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:343\nFindings \n \n1.  Proximity restrictions have been adopted in other states, but there has been little experience \nwith actual implementation of these laws.  Two states, Alabama and Iowa, recently enacted \nor revised proximity restrictions.  In October 2002, Iowa had the first charge against an of-\nfender for violating their law.  This is considered a test case for the restrictions. \n \n2.  Proximity restrictions would severely limit already scarce residential options for level three \noffenders. \n \n3.  There is no evidence in Minnesota that residential proximity to schools or parks affects re-\noffense.  Thirteen level three offenders released between 1997 and 1999 have been rearrested \nfor a new sex offense since their release from prison, and in none of the cases has residential \nproximity to schools or parks been a factor in the re-offense. \n \n4.  There is no evidence that concentration of level three sex offenders increases the likelihood \nof reoffense within the community.  Four of the 13 level three reoffenders were living with \nother sex offenders at the time of their re-arrest.  However, in three of these cases, the sex of-\nfenders were living together while in county jail, civilly committed, or in a halfway house.  \nIn the fourth instance, a level three offender re-offended while he was living with a level two \nsex offender.  This offender provided information to his therapist, which eventually led to the \nre-arrest of the level three offender for a child pornography offense. \n \n5.  Information on sex offenders has a negative effect on the perception of safety in a neighbor-\nhood.  Increased information on sex offenders has a negative effect on property values.  In-\ncreased residential concentration of level three offenders – in addition to other negative \nneighborhood issues such as crime, housing deterioration, environmental hazards, and traffic \nproblems – expands that negative effect.   \n \n6.  Proximity restrictions will have the effect of restricting level three offenders to less populated \nareas, with fewer supervising agents and fewer services for offenders (i.e., employment, edu-\ncation, and treatment).  The result of proximity restrictions would be to limit most level three \noffenders to rural, suburban, or industrial areas. \n \n \nRecommendations   \n \n1.  Since blanket proximity restrictions on residential locations of level three offenders do \nnot enhance community safety, the current offender-by-offender restrictions should be \nretained.  Proximity restrictions, based on circumstances of an individual offender, serve as \na valuable supervision tool. Continued use – through extension of conditional release and \nspecific release conditions and restrictions – is appropriate.  Most of these supervision prox-\nimity restrictions address the issue of the offender associating or interacting with children or \nminors, rather than where the offender resides. \n  \n2.  Public notification of residential locations of level three offenders serves a valuable ser-\nvice and should continue.  Community residents with this knowledge are able to determine \nwhat level of interaction they feel is acceptable for their family safety.  The information \nraises awareness, dispels rumors, and allows greater knowledge of safety issues. \n  11\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:344\n \n3.  A legislative hearing on the expansion of housing options should be held.  Appropriate \nhousing is the key to dispersal and successful placement of the sex offender population.  A \nlegislative hearing to address all the issues related to housing of released level three sex of-\nfenders would prove valuable.  The DOC is currently conducting an interagency work group \non offender housing.  Included in this group’s study are the unique challenges of finding \nhousing options for level three offenders.  Options under exploration are public/private part-\nnerships, charitable and nonprofit efforts, changes in policy, and other outreach programs \n \n4.  Explore various housing options.  The interagency work group on offender housing spon-\nsored by the DOC is approaching the need for offender housing through several methods. \nThese methods include identifying ways to assist offenders in becoming more attractive ten-\nants, as well as identifying ways to encourage and assist landlords in providing housing to of-\nfenders. Also, the work group is identifying various models of existing housing programs \nthat may be adaptable to address the housing needs of offenders as they transition from \nprison to the community. Approaches such as master leases and “three-quarter way” houses \nseem appropriate for the offender population for several reasons – among them the flexibility \nto expect many offenders to reach and maintain housing self-sufficiency fairly soon after re-\nlease.  \n \n  The population that presents the most daunting housing issues is sex offenders who are iden-\ntified as levels two and three through the community notification process. At present, no spe-\ncial solutions have been identified for this population.  \n \n  Although the work group has not completed its task the time of this report, the following rec-\nommendations are offered: \n \na)  Increase the number and capacity of halfway houses.  In some cases the needs of the \noffender and public safety are best served when the offender transitions to the community \nthrough the highly structured environment of a halfway house.  Current halfway house \nresources are inadequate to meet the number of offenders who need services.  Also, there \nare regions of the state that have no halfway house resources. \n \nb)  Provide funding to establish “three-quarter way” houses.  These houses provide an-\nother step in a continuum of housing options.  Three-quarter way houses provide afford-\nable housing for offenders and a positive supportive community within the house.  There \nis no staff on the premises, but some degree of monitoring of the house is done by off-site \nstaff.  Such a facility also allows for an increased level of community supervision by \nagents, law enforcement, and the public.  Most often these houses are expected to be \nnearly financially self-sufficient after an initial start-up period. \n \nc)  Provide funding for scattered site lease programs.  Housing for offenders can be eco-\nnomically provided by contracting with housing programs.  Housing programs can lease \nproperties from owners and sublease to offenders.  Included in this plan is the expectation \nthat the offender is assessed payment on a sliding fee schedule.  It is also an expectation \nthat the offender will assume responsibility for all housing expenses soon after release. \n  12\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-7 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 15 of 15 PageID #:345\n \nd)  Increase funding of the emergency housing fund.  Some offenders are released to re-\ngions of the state in which there is no housing program available.  Increased funds in this \naccount will allow the DOC to provide assistance to an offender in meeting housing ex-\npenses during transition.  Repayment would be assessed on a sliding fee schedule. \n \ne)  Evaluate the feasibility of building and operating regional correctional centers.  \nThese centers would provide a comprehensive set of correctional services.  The services \nmay range from probationary supervision, an alternative to incarceration for short-term \noffenders, and supervision services for offenders on release from state correctional facili-\nties.  The services would include housing for some offenders. \n \n \n \n  13\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-8 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 4 PageID #:346\nDeclaration of Delshay McDaniel \n \n1.  My name is Delshay McDaniel. Marcus Barnes is my cousin. I speak with Marcus \nregularly and have made extensive efforts over the past year and a half to find housing \nfor him. \n \n2.  Marcus was supposed to be released from prison in December 2018. But he remains in \nprison because we have not been able to find a host site for Marcus to live at that the \nIDOC will approve. \n \n3.  We have submitted 11 different potential host sites as places for Marcus to live, \nincluding my home, my father’s home (Marcus’s uncle), several transitional housing \nfacilities, and several motels.  \n \n4.  Every proposed host site has been rejected. According to paperwork Marcus received \nfrom IDOC in response to a request he submitted (see attached), my home was rejected \nbecause there is a daycare within 500 feet of my house. My father’s home was rejected \nbecause there is a daycare within 500 feet of his home. Other sites were rejected \nbecause they are “motels” or “half-way houses.”  \n \n5.  Several months ago, I began working with Jordan’s Dream, a Chicago-based organization \nthat provides housing and supportive services to individuals who have been convicted of \nsex offenses, to try to find housing for Marcus. \n \n6.  The last address we submitted is 5726 S. Sangamon, which is a two flat owned and \noperated by Jordan’s Dream. The address has been rejected for the sole reason that \nthere is a “sex offender registered at this address.” It is my understanding based on \nconversations with the landlord, Richard Boykins, that this address meets all of the \nother requirements for housing of individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses. \nIt is not within 500 feet of a school, playground, daycare, or other facility that provides \nservices to children.  \n \n7.  Jordan’s Dream still has room available for Marcus at 5726 S. Sangamon. I and Marcus’ \nother family members are willing and able to pay for Marcus to live there. We have no \nother housing options for Marcus at this time.  \n \n8.  On March 31, 2020, Marcus’ father, my uncle, passed away. I unfortunately had to \ncommunicate the information that his dad had died to Marcus while he remains \nimprisoned at Graham Correctional Center. \n \n9.  Marcus has told me that he has heard that a prison guard employed at Graham \nCorrectional Center has been diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result he feels that he and \nthe other prisoners at Graham, who remain confined in units containing 20 prisoners, \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-8 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:347\nare now at serious risk of contracting the disease. He does not feel safe remaining at \nGraham. \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements are \ntrue and correct. \n \n \n \n__________________________       April 3, 2020 \nDelshay McDaniel \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-8 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:348\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-8 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:349",

Each of the \nPlaintiffs has identified housing that would otherwise be approved by IDOC, but for \nthe “One Person Per Address” provision in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). This Court has \nalready determined that it is unconstitutional to imprison sex offenders long after \ntheir period of incarceration has been completed solely because they are unable to \nfind suitable host sites. See Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 781 (N.D. Ill. 2019).  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 29 Filed: 06/03/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:253\n  The following Plaintiffs have identified host sites that will be supportive of their \ntransition back into the community:  \n•  Plaintiff Luis Aponte seeks to continue residing with his father at 2120 \nLorraine Avenue, Apt. 5C, Waukegan, Illinois, 60085; \n \n•  Plaintiffs Kevin Manson, Columbo Galindo, Joshua Huddleston, Lavonne \nGivens, Lashaun Dean, Justin Fluckert, Dontae Boykin, Ronald Garrison, \nJohnny Harris, Manuel Aleman, Arnold Lloyd, Melvin Kelley, Andre Dunn, \nCharles Rucker and Michael Johnstone seek to reside at properties operated \nby New Beginnings, a transitional housing provider with locations at 6655 S. \nPerry, Chicago, Illinois 60621 and 11934 S. Lowe, Chicago, Illinois 60628; \nand \n \n•  Plaintiffs Juan Medina, Adam Escamilla, Ashief Shaffer, Reginald Harris, \nEdward Bartgen and John Berry seek to reside at Wayside Cross Ministries, \na Bible-based transitional housing program at 215 E. New York Street, \nAurora, Illinois, 60505. \n \n  At each of these proposed housing locations, another person who has been \nconvicted of a sex offense already resides in the same building and therefore \nDefendant cannot release these individuals to the proposed locations because of its \nobligation to follow 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n  There has been no legitimate public interest articulated in only having one sex \noffender live at one residence. Therefore, the Court finds that the statute is \nunconstitutional as it applies to the 22 individuals identified above, and Defendant \nis enjoined from enforcing the “One Person Per Address” provision in 730 ILCS 5/3-\n3-7(a)(7.6) as to these individuals to the extent they seek release to the locations \nidentified above, or in the case of Mr. Aponte, to the extent that he seeks to continue \nresiding at the location identified above. Defendant is enjoined from prohibiting \nthese individuals’ release to the locations identified above, subject to the approval of \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 29 Filed: 06/03/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:254\nthe program operators at New Beginnings and Wayside Cross Ministries.

Since filing the motion, Plaintiffs’ counsel have gathered additional \ninformation relevant to the Court’s decision on the motion and submit this brief \nsupplement for the Court’s consideration. \nI.  Thomas Smith Seeks to Serve His MSR at His Parents’ Home, But Is \nProhibited from Doing So Pursuant to the One-Per-Address Statute \n \n  After filing Plaintiffs’ second motion for a preliminary injunction, counsel was \ncontacted by Jerry Calvin. Mr. Calvin is the step-father of Thomas Smith, an \nindividual who is currently imprisoned in IDOC and is seeking a host site at which \nto reside while on “three-to-life” MSR. Ex. 1, Declaration of Jerry Calvin, at ¶¶1, 2. \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 20 Filed: 05/05/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:158\nMr. Calvin and his wife, Tammy (Thomas’ mother), would like to have Thomas live \nwith them at their home in Pocahontas, Illinois, while he is on MSR. Id. at ¶3. They \nhave a three-bedroom home and can give Thomas his own bedroom and bathroom. \nId. The home is in a rural area, and it is Mr. Calvin’s understanding that it is not \nwithin 500 feet of any schools, playgrounds, or daycares. Id. \n  Thomas submitted his parents’ home as a proposed host site. IDOC rejected the \nhost site because Mr. Calvin was convicted of a sex offense 34 years ago (in 1986), \nand the One-Per-Address Statute (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6)) prohibits Thomas from \nresiding at the same address as another person who has been convicted of a sex \noffense—no matter how long ago. Id. at ¶4. Mr. Calvin has no arrests or convictions \nsubsequent to his 1986 offense. Id. at ¶5. \n  The only barrier to Thomas Smith’s being allowed to serve his MSR time at his \nparents’ home is the One-Per-Address Statute. His situation is another example of \nhow the Statute works to keep Murphy class members in prison when they could \notherwise be released to safe, welcoming homes that would foster their success on \nparole. \nII. Plaintiffs Have Identified 19 Motels that Local Law Enforcement \nEntities Consider to Be Registrable Addresses \n \n  As set forth in Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, motels that offer \nweekly or monthly rental rates would be a good housing option for members of the \nMurphy class who have funds to pay for housing, but lack outside supporters who \ncan lease apartments on their behalf. ECF No. 17 at 11-12.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 20 Filed: 05/05/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:159\n  After filing the motion for a preliminary injunction, counsel began researching \nother motels that comply with the Residency Restrictions set forth in 720 ILCS \n5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-10) (i.e., they are not located within 500 feet of any schools, \nplaygrounds, or daycares). Counsel contacted police departments in 15 Illinois \njurisdictions to inquire about motels that local registration authorities consider to \nbe lawful, registrable addresses. Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a list of 19 motels \nat which local registration officials have previously permitted individuals with \nconvictions for “child sex offenses” to register. Some of these motels offer monthly \nrental rates that would be affordable even for individuals of modest means. Counsel \nwould like to assemble a comprehensive, statewide list of similar properties and \noffer this list to Murphy and Barnes class-members and their families who are \nseeking host sites.  \n  According to the local law enforcement officials to whom counsel spoke, most, if \nnot all, of the identified motels currently have other registrants residing there. \nThus, these addresses do not comply with the One-Per-Address Statute.1 If the \nStatute were enjoined, all 19 of these properties (and more) would become potential \nhost sites that would facilitate the transition of Murphy and Barnes class-members \nback into the community.  \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above and in Plaintiffs’ second motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable \n                                                        \n1   The One-Per-Address Statute applies only to registrants who are on probation or MSR; \nnot to those who are no longer under supervision.  \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 20 Filed: 05/05/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:160\nCourt enjoin Defendant from enforcing the One-Per-Address Statute (730 ILCS 5/3-\n3-7(a)(7.6)).  \n                        Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Adele D.

My name is Jerry Calvin. I am the step-father of Thomas Smith (IDOC Number S10842), \nwho is currently imprisoned at Taylorville Correctional Center. \n2.  Thomas was convicted of criminal sexual assault. He is scheduled to be released from \nprison on Mandatory Supervised Release on January 14, 2021. He will be on MSR for \nthree years to life.  \n3.  My wife, Tammy (Thomas’ mother), and I would like to have Thomas live with us at our \nhome in Pocahontas, Illinois, while he is on parole. We have a three-bedroom home and \ncan give Thomas his own bedroom and bathroom. We are prepared to make whatever \narrangements are necessary for our home to be a suitable host site for Thomas. It is our \nunderstanding that our home is not within 500 feet of any schools, playgrounds, or \ndaycares. \n4.  The IDOC told us that Thomas cannot parole to our home because I was convicted of a \nsex offense 34 years ago (in 1986) and Thomas is prohibited from living while on parole \nwith another person who has been convicted of a sex offense.  \n5.  I have no arrests or convictions subsequent to my 1986 sex offense. I have lived a law \nabiding life since my release from prison. I am not on the sex offender registry and am \nnot under any kind of criminal justice supervision.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n_______________________      ___________ \nJerry Calvin          Date \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 20-2 Filed: 05/05/20 Page 1 of 1 PageID #:162\nExhibit 2 \n \nMotel Name  Address  Phone Number \nMotel 6  3551 Mall Loop Dr.   (815) 439-1332 \nJoliet, IL 60431 \nRed Roof Inn  1750 McDonough St.   (815) 741-2304 \nJoliet, IL 60436 \nStar Inn  2219 1/2 W Jefferson St.   (815) 744-1220 \nJoliet, IL 60435 \nBrer Rabbit  65 W.

R. CIV. P. 23(B)(2) AND FOR APPOINTMENT  \nOF CLASS COUNSEL PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 23(G)(1) \n \n  Plaintiffs, through counsel, respectfully request that this Court enter an order \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) certifying this case as a class \naction on behalf of all individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and \ncompleted their court-imposed sentence of incarceration but remain imprisoned in \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections because they cannot find housing that \ncomplies with 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). Plaintiffs further request that this Court \nenter an order appointing the undersigned attorneys as class counsel. In support \nthereof, Plaintiffs state as follows. \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter \n“the One-Per-Address Statute” or “the Statute”). The Statute prohibits any \nindividual on Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) for a sex offense from residing \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 2 of 13 PageID #:167\n“at the same address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the \nsame condominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she \nknows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on \nsupervision for a sex offense.” Id. \n  The named Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent have \nall completed their court-ordered terms of incarceration and are entitled to release \non MSR. They remain in prison because they cannot find an approved “host site” at \nwhich to live while on MSR due to the enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n  Plaintiffs claim the enforcement of the Statute against them and others \nsimilarly situated violates the Eighth Amendment and Equal Protection Clause. \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of the class against Rob \nJeffreys in his official capacity as the director of the Illinois Department of \nCorrections. Mr. Jeffreys is the public official with ultimate authority for \nenforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute. \n  Plaintiffs’ claims are ideally suited to proceed as a class action under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). As set forth below, the proposed class satisfies each \nelement of Rule 23(a) because (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class; and (4) \nthe named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Moreover, this matter meets the requirements for class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendant has acted in a manner that \n\t 2\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 3 of 13 PageID #:168\napplies generally to the class as a whole, rendering class-wide injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Court Should Certify the Proposed Class   \n \n  For a district court to certify a class action, the proposed class must satisfy the \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a) and \nthe requirements of at least one subsection of Rule 23(b). Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 \nF.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992). Here, because the proposed class meets all four \nRule 23(a) requirements and the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), the class should be \ncertified. \nA.  The Proposed Class Meets All of the Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and 23(b)(2) \n \n1.  Numerosity \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  A class \n“including more than 40 members” generally meets this standard. Barragan v. \nEvanger’s Dog and Cat Food Co., 259 F.R.D. 330, 333 (N.D.Ill. 2009); Streeter v. \nSheriff of Cook County, 256 F.R.D. 609, 612 (N.D. Ill. 2012) (same); accord William \nB. Rubenstein, et al., Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:12 (5th ed. 2011) (“a class of 40 \nor more members raises a presumption of impracticability of joinder based on \nnumbers alone.”)  \n  Here, the proposed class easily satisfies this standard. According to the final \nreport of the Illinois Sex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration Task Force, \n\t 3\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 4 of 13 PageID #:169\npublished in December 2017, “[o]n average, the Illinois Department of Corrections \nhouses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders who may not be released from custody because they \nare unable to secure permanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute \nrequirements or agency policy.”1 Many such individuals remain incarcerated solely \nbecause of the One-Per-Address provision. Plaintiffs’ pleadings to date have \nidentified 17 individuals who have otherwise compliant addresses that have not \nbeen approved because of the One-Per-Address Statute.2  \n  As explained in Plaintiffs’ most recent preliminary injunction motion (ECF No. \n17), these individuals fall into three broad categories: (1) individuals such as \nMarcus Barnes, Kenneth Green and Dana Monson who would like to reside at \ncharitably operated transitional housing such as Jordan’s Dream or Wayside Cross \nMinistries; (2) individuals such as Alvin Goldberg and Joshua Huddleston who \ncould obtain privately financed housing at addresses where other individuals with \nsex offense convictions already reside; (3) individuals such as Andra Sampson and \nJohn Margarella who are eligible for placement at the units IDOC leases from \nNewDay Apartments. Each of these categories likely contains dozens of other people \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1   Available at: http://www.icjia.state.il.us/news/sex-offenses-and-sex-offender-\nregistration-task-force-final-report \n \n2   Marcus Barnes, Kenneth Green, Fredrick Chamblis, Corey Crowe, Dana Monson, David \nEaston, Joshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, Wade Council, Christopher Shelton, Mark \nFaller, Paul Hubbard, Alvin Goldberg, DeJuan Wright, Andra Sampson, John Margarella, \nand Joshua Huddleston. \n\t 4\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 5 of 13 PageID #:170\nwho could identify housing but for the restriction on residing at the same address as \nanother offender.3  \n  Moreover, as noted in Plaintiffs’ second motion for a preliminary injunction, \nmembership in the class is growing as additional individuals finish their sentences \nof incarceration and become eligible for release on MSR but remain imprisoned due \nto an inability to obtain compliant housing. Accordingly, the class easily meets the \nnumerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1). \n2.  Commonality \n \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Where, as here, the named Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class they seek to represent bring a facial challenge to an allegedly \nunconstitutional statute, the central questions of law and fact are necessarily \ncommon to all members of the class. See Smiley v. Calumet City, No. 08 C 3017, \n2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41701, at *15-16 (N.D. Ill. May 15, 2009) (Where the \nPlaintiff brings “a facial challenge to the validity of [a statute] … the statute itself \nserves as the required ‘common nucleus of operative fact.’”) (citing Keele v. Wexler, \n149 F. 3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) and Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th \nCir. 1992)).  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n3   Indeed, since the May 6, 2020, hearing on Plaintiffs’ second motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, Plaintiffs have identified several additional transitional housing providers who \ncould accept members of the proposed class but for the One-Per-Address restriction and \nseveral additional extended-stay motels that will accept individuals with sex offense \nconvictions. \n\t 5\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:171\n  Here, the named Plaintiff and all members of the proposed are challenging the \nconstitutionality of the same statute. Accordingly, all of the core factual and legal \nquestions are appropriate for resolution on a class-wide basis. These common \nquestions include the following: \n•  What are the rationales for the One-Per-Address Statute;  \n \n•  Whether there is any compelling interest served by the Statute; \n \n•  Whether the Statute violates the Eighth Amendment and/or Equal \nProtection Clause as applied to the members of the class.   \n \n  Because there are common questions of law and fact pertaining to all members \nof the class, this matter meets the commonality requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(2). \n3.  Typicality \n \n  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The \nstandard for determining typicality is not an identity of interest between the named \nplaintiffs and the class, but rather a “sufficient homogeneity of interest.” Jones v. \nBlinziner, 536 F. Supp. 1181, 1190 (N.D. Ind. 1982) (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. \n393, 403 n.13 (1975)). “[T]he typicality requirement is liberally construed.” Gaspar \nv. Linvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 57 (N.D. Ill. 1996). A “plaintiff’s claim is typical if \nit arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members and [is] based on the same legal theory.” De La \nFuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983). This \nrequirement “is meant to assume that the named representative’s claims ‘have the \n\t 6\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:172\nsame essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.’” Oshana v. Coca–\nCola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 514 (7th Cir. 2006). \n  Where, as here, the named Plaintiffs’ injuries arise from a generally applicable \nstatute affecting all members of the class, typicality exists even if there are factual \ndifferences in precisely how the statute was applied to each plaintiff. Sherman v. \nTwp. High Sch. Dist. 214, 540 F. Supp. 2d 985, 992 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (“variations in \nfactual circumstances … do not defeat the typicality of the class representative’s \ndefenses.”) (citing Brown v. Kelly, 244 F.R.D. 222, 230 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“if factual \ndistinctions could preclude findings of commonality and typicality under Rule 23(a), \nthey would be the death knell for class actions challenging the systemic \nenforcement of an unconstitutional statute.”); Areola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 798 \n(7th Cir. 2008) (typicality satisfied where plaintiff was in the “same boat” as other \nCook County Jail detainees who had been denied crutches). \n  In this case, the named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class as a whole. Each \nnamed Plaintiff has a place to live that would meet IDOC approval but for the One-\nPer-Address Statute. The members of the proposed class are in the same situation—\nthat is, they will be imprisoned beyond the completion of their court-ordered term of \nincarceration unless and until they find housing that satisfies this rule. Moreover, \nthe named Plaintiffs and each class member have the same legal theories—that is, \nthe application of the challenged statute keeps them in prison in violation of the \nEighth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, the named \nPlaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement. See Fonder v. Sheriff of \n\t 7\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 8 of 13 PageID #:173\nKankakee County, No. 12-CV-2115, 2013 WL 5644754, at *6 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 15, 2013) \n(typicality satisfied where “Plaintiff is challenging the same strip search policy as \nthe class he seeks to represent”); Olson v. Brown, 284 F.R.D. 398, 411 (N.D. Ind. \n2012) (typicality satisfied where class representative and members of proposed class \nhad their legal mail opened improperly by correctional officers). \n4.  Adequacy \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiffs “will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The adequacy inquiry \nconsists of two parts: “(1) the adequacy of the named plaintiffs as representatives of \nthe proposed class’ myriad members, with their differing and separate interests, \nand (2) the adequacy of the proposed class counsel.” Gomez v. St. Vincent Health, \nInc., 649 F.3d 583, 592 (7th Cir. 2011). Both elements are met here.  \na.  The Named Plaintiffs Are Appropriate Representatives of the \nInterests of the Class  \n \n  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nThe named Plaintiffs and the class members raise the same claims, seek the same \nrelief, and their interests are aligned. The named Plaintiffs are a diverse group who \nrepresent the various ways in which the One-Per-Address Statute keeps individuals \nin prison beyond their release dates. Each of the named Plaintiffs has a strong \npersonal stake in the proceedings that will “insure diligent and thorough \nprosecution of the litigation.” Rodriguez v. Swank, 318 F. Supp. 289, 294 (N.D. \nIll.1970), aff'd 403 U.S. 901 (1971). At present, there are 16 named Plaintiffs who \n\t 8\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 9 of 13 PageID #:174\nremain in prison because of the One-Per-Address Statute.4 Even if such individuals \nare released pursuant to preliminary injunctive relief, they will remain invested in \nseeing this litigation through to its conclusion because in the absence of permanent \ninjunctive relief, they will be returned to prison on a technical violation of their \nparole (i.e., their housing will no longer be valid because of the One-Per-Address \nStatute). Accordingly, the name Plaintiffs will adequately represent the interests of \nthe class.  \nb.  Adequacy of Representation \n  The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced civil rights counsel who are \nwell qualified to represent the interests of the members of the class and have \ndevoted substantial time and resources to vigorously prosecuting this case. Ms. \nNicholas and Mr. Weinberg have successfully litigated numerous constitutional \ncases in which broad equitable relief was sought, including the Murphy class action \nwhich raised claims closely related to the claims raised here. See, Murphy v. Raoul, \n16 C 11471, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill., 2019) (Kendall, J.) (certified class action; \nobtained permanent injunction governing IDOC procedures for releasing sex \noffenders on MSR); RCP Publications Inc. v. City of Chicago, 15 C 11398 (certified \nclass action; obtained permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of City’s sign-\nposting ordinance and class-wide damages); Adair v. Town of Cicero, No. 18 C 3526, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110949 (N.D. Ill. July 3, 2019) (pending certified class action \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n4   Columbo Galindo, Joshua Huddleston, Alvin Goldberg, Kenneth Green, Fredrick \nChamblis, Corey Crowe, Dana Monson, David Easton, Joshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, \nWade Council, Christopher Shelton, Mark Faller, Paul Hubbard, Andra Sampson, and John \nMargarella. \n\t 9\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 10 of 13 PageID #:175\non behalf of women detained in Town of Cicero police lockup); Koger v. Dart, 114 F. \nSupp. 3d 572 (N.D. Ill., 2015) (obtained declaratory judgment holding ban on \nnewspapers in the Cook County Jail unconstitutional); Pindak v. Dart, 10 C 6237 \n(N.D. Ill. 2016) (Pallmeyer, J.) (obtained a permanent injunction ordering the \nsheriff to train deputies concerning First Amendment rights); Norton v. City of \nSpringfield, 806 F. 3d 411 (7th Cir. 2015) (obtained an injunction barring the City of \nSpringfield from enforcing its municipal panhandling ordinance).  \n  Because the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated a commitment to vigorously \npursuing class-wide relief and because they are represented by competent and \nexperienced counsel, they satisfy Rule 23(a)(4)’s adequacy requirements. \n5.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) Because this Case \nSeeks Declaratory and Injunctive Relief from Policies that \nImpact the Entire Proposed Class \n \n  The final requirement for class certification is that the named plaintiff must \nmeet the requirements of at least one of the subsections of Rule 23(b). Subsection \n(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Courts have long recognized that civil rights class \nactions are the paradigmatic 23(b)(2) suits. See Alliance to End Repression v. \nRochford, 565 F. 2d 975, 979 n.9 (7th Cir. 1977) (“Rule 23(b)(2) … is devoted \nprimarily to civil rights class actions which allege violations of constitutional \nrights.”) (citing Advisory Committee Notes to the 1966 Amendments to Rule 23);  \n\t 10\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 11 of 13 PageID #:176\nChi. Teachers Union, Local No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. of Chi., 797 F.3d 426, 441 (7th Cir. \n2015) (“23(b)(2) is the appropriate rule to enlist when the plaintiffs’ primary goal is \nnot monetary relief, but rather to require the defendant to do or not do something \nthat would benefit the whole class. Not surprisingly, civil rights cases … are prime \nexamples of Rule 23(b)(2) classes.”) (citations omitted). \n  As stated in the leading treatise on class actions: \nRule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights \nsuits. Most class actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas \nseek primarily declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class \nand therefore readily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) class action criteria. \n \nA. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002). Because \nthis case seeks class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief, it is appropriate for \ncertification as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nII.   The Court Should Designate Plaintiffs’ Counsel as Class Counsel \nUnder Rule 23(g)(1) \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) requires that the district court appoint \nclass counsel for any class that is certified. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). The attorneys \nappointed to serve as class counsel must “fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B). The appointed class counsel must \nbe listed in a court’s class certification order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(B). \n  Rule 23(g) provides four factors for a court to consider in appointing class \ncounsel: (1) “the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential \nclaims in the action;” (2) “counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other \ncomplex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action;” (3) “counsel’s \n\t 11\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 12 of 13 PageID #:177\nknowledge of the applicable law”; and (4) “the resources that counsel will commit to \nrepresenting the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  \n  The undersigned attorneys satisfy each of these requirements. First, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel have invested substantial work into preparation of this case, including \nspeaking to numerous families and individuals affected by the challenged statute, \ndrafting a Complaint and First Amended Complaint, drafting two successful \nmotions for a preliminary injunctive relief, and conducting extensive legal research \nconcerning the class members’ claims. Second, as set forth in §I(A)(4)(c) above, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have devoted substantial professional resources to litigation on \nbehalf of individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and have significant \nexperience in handling complex civil rights litigation, including the kind of claims \nasserted in this case. Finally, Plaintiffs’ counsel have dedicated and will continue to \ncommit substantial resources to the representation of this class. In sum, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel fully satisfy the criteria for class counsel set forth in Rule 23(g), and \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court appoint undersigned counsel to \nrepresent the class. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant \nthe motion for class certification and appoint the undersigned attorneys as Class \nCounsel. \n \n   \n\t 12\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 23 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 13 of 13 PageID #:178\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Adele D.

My name is Stanley Meyer. I was convicted of one count of criminal sexual assault in 2008 \nand was sentenced to serve 48 months in the Illinois Department of Corrections at 85 percent, \nwith a MSR term of three years to life. The victim of my offense was an adult. The PRB \napproved me for release on MSR on July 15, 2011. \n \n2. I remained imprisoned for more than eight years after my release date because I did not \nhave money to pay for housing and did not have family outside of prison who were willing or \nable to help me.  \n \n3. On January 13, 2020, I was released on MSR to an apartment in North Chicago operated by \nNewDay Apartments. I resided there by myself for approximately four months. The apartment \nhas two bedrooms and could easily accommodate two people. On May 27, 2020, another \nperson on MSR from the Illinois Department of Corrections, Jerrand Miller, came and lived with \nme. We are currently both residing here. \n \n4. I am currently looking for work in Lake County. Once I find a job and have a means to support \nmyself, I will rent an apartment in the area. I have spoken to J.D. Lindenmeier, another \nindividual who is on MSR and currently residing at NewDay Apartments, about the possibility of \nbeing roommates when we move.  \n \n5. It would be beneficial for J.D. and I to live together and share expenses like rent and utilities \nwhile we both serve our MSR sentences. J.D. and I get along well. Because I was released before \nhim, I have tried to offer him help with things like obtaining clothing, applying for SNAP \nbenefits, and navigating public transit in the area.  \n \n6. I have researched apartments for rent in the North Chicago and Waukegan areas. Many one \nbedroom apartments rent for approximately $750 to $850 per month, would be very difficult \nfor me to afford on my own. However, two-bedroom apartments in the area often rent for \napproximately $900 to $1,100 per month, which is more affordable when split between two \npeople.  \n \n7. It would enable both J.D. and me to move out of NewDay Apartments more quickly if we \ncould live together and share living expenses. \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements are \ntrue and correct. \n \n \n7-1-20\n________________          ___________ \nStanley Meyer           Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-11 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:352\nDeclaration of Luis Aponte \n1.  My name is Luis Aponte. I was released from IDOC onto mandatory supervised release \nin January 2020 to my father’s home in Waukegan, Illinois. I have three-years-to-life of MSR. \n2.  My father’s home is in a four-story apartment building that contains approximately 12 \nseparate units. When I was released, no other registrant lived in the building. IDOC determined \nthat the address complies with the prohibition on residing within 500 feet of a school, \nplayground or daycare, and approved me to live there while on MSR.  \n3.  I am doing well on MSR. I have a full-time job in a warehouse and have been attending \nrequired sex offender therapy regularly. \n4.  In March 2020, another registrant (not on parole) moved into a different unit in the \nsame building where I live with my father.  \n5.  I received notice from my parole agent that I have to move because of this other \nregistrant in the building. If I do not find somewhere else to live, I will have my MSR revoked \nand will be sent back to prison. If I go back to prison, I will lose my job and will be stuck in IDOC \nuntil I can find another place to live.  \n6.  I have been looking for another place to live, but I have not been able to find a host site \nthat IDOC will approve and that I can afford with my current income.  \n7.  I want to keep living with my father while I adjust to life on parole and get back on my \nfeet.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-11 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:353\n \n_________________      _5_-2_4_-_2_0_____ \nLuis Aponte         Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-12 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:354\nDeclaration of Kevin Manson \n1.  My name is Kevin Manson. I was released from IDOC onto mandatory supervised \nrelease on May 6, 2020. I currently reside in Chicago Heights, Illinois, with my aunt. I have \nthree-years-to life of MSR.  \n2.  IDOC approved me for release to my aunt’s home, but when I tried to register with \nChicago Heights police, I was informed that my aunt’s house is too close to a school and I have \nto move somewhere else.  \n3.  I just got out of prison and don’t have funds to pay for housing of my own. The Cook \nCounty Justice Advisory Council (“CCJAC”), a governmental entity that provides reentry \nassistance to citizens returning to Cook County after imprisonment, is willing to pay for my \nhousing through an agency called New Beginnings.  \n4.  It is my understanding that New Beginnings has a bed available for me at 11934 S. Lowe \nChicago Illinois, 60628, and is able to take me immediately. \n5.  I have not yet been approved to go to New Beginnings because there is another \nregistrant living at 11934 S. Lowe and I am prohibited from living at the same address as \nanother sex offender.  \n6.  If I am not allowed to go to New Beginnings I will not have a compliant place to live and \nwill be sent back to prison.

I remained imprisoned for more than six years beyond the completion of my sentence \nbecause couldn’t secure housing. My family asked IDOC to release me to homes with every \nfamily member who was willing to take me in. Every proposed location with members of my \nfamily was rejected because of proximity to schools or playgrounds or the presence of children. \nNo one in my family has the money to buy or rent a separate place for me to live and I do not \nhave savings to pay for my own housing. \n \n3. While in IDOC, I was told that I was not eligible for release to a halfway house or shelter.  \n \n4. On June 23, 2020, I was released on MSR to an apartment operated by NewDay Apartments \nin Waukegan, Illinois. I reside with Jerry Davis, another person on MSR from the Illinois \nDepartment of Corrections. It is a two-bedroom apartment. Jerry and I get along well. We are \nboth grateful for the opportunity to be out of prison and to have the ability to get our lives back \non track and reestablish our relationships with our families.  \n \n5. Since my release, I have been looking for work and talking with my family frequently.  \n \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements are \ntrue and correct. \n \n \n7-1-20\n________________          ___________ \nJohn Margarella          Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-15 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 2 PageID #:358\nDeclaration of Fredrick Chamblis \n1.    My name is Fredrick Chamblis. My date of birth is July 13, 1992. I was convicted of \ncriminal sexual assault in 2012 and was sentenced to serve four years in the Illinois Department \nof Corrections plus three years to life of mandatory supervised release. \n2.  My original out date for release from prison was January 22, 2016. I was not released \nfrom prison at that time because I could not find housing. I did not have savings to pay for my \nown housing. I submitted addresses with every member of my family who was willing to take \nme in both in Illinois and in Wisconsin, but every address was rejected.  \n3.  I remained in prison until May 19, 2020, when I was approved for release to Wayside \nCross Ministries, where I currently reside.  \n4.  Wayside Cross has a positive, uplifting and motivating atmosphere that makes it a \ngreat place for me to build a foundation for reentry into society. There are many resources and \nservices that help with parole, and there is a strong sense of love, brotherhood and fellowship. \nThe daily routine and schedule here helps all of the residents focus on our priorities and set \nhigh standards and expectations for ourselves. It has helped me look at the bigger picture and \nbegin thinking about and planning for short and long term goals such as successfully completing \nthe program at WCM, obtaining employment, and saving up to go back to college to earn a \ndegree. Most importantly, it allows me a chance to really establish a close relationship with God \nthat will be the foundation for my future. \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-15 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:359\n \n6-30-2020\n_____________________      ___________ \nFredrick Chamblis        Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-16 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 1 PageID #:360\nDeclaration of Corey Crowe \n1.    My name is Corey Crowe. My date of birth is February 7, 1979. I was convicted of \ncriminal sexual assault in 2013 and was sentenced to serve six years in the Illinois Department \nof Corrections plus three years to life of mandatory supervised release. \n2.  My original out date was June 5, 2018. I was held for almost two years past my out \ndate because I could not find housing. My family in Illinois and Kentucky tried to help me find a \nplace to live, but all of their homes were rejected by the IDOC. I didn’t have money to pay for \nmy own housing, and my family was unable to pay for a place on my behalf. My mother is older \nand has minimal income.  \n3.  Before I learned about the possibility of going to Wayside Cross, I was convinced I \nwould die in prison. My mental state was in jeopardy and I was becoming depressed because I \nsaw no way that I would ever be able to get out of prison. It was also an emotional burden on \nmy family who worried about me but helpless to get me out.  \n4.  On May 19, 2020, I was released to Wayside Cross Ministries. I now have the \nopportunity to move past my conviction and have a normal life. I am looking forward to \nworking, helping my mother, and being a father to my daughter again.  \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n \n7-1-20\n_____________________      ___________ \nCorey Crowe          Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-17 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 1 PageID #:361\nDeclaration of Jerry Davis \n \n1. My name is Jerry Davis. I was convicted of criminal sexual assault in 2006 and was sentenced \nto four years in prison plus three years to life of mandatory supervised release. I became \neligible for release on MSR on December 30, 2008. I was not released at that time because I \ncould not find housing.  \n \n2. I had family members who were willing to take me in, but IDOC did not approve any family \nmembers’ addresses because they were all deemed to be too close to schools or parks.  \n \n3. In June 2016, nearly eight years after my out date, I was released to Hand-n-Hand Outreach, \na transitional housing provider in Chicago. I was out on MSR for approximately a year and half. I \nwas doing well on MSR. I had a job and was enrolled in school. Unfortunately, in November \n2017, I lost my housing at Hand-n-Hand because I returned there after curfew.  \n \n4. The PRB did not revoke my MSR. I was immediately eligible for re-release if I could find a \nplace to live. But, I was not able to find housing for the next two years. In total I served ten \nyears of dead time before I was released to NewDay Apartments in December 2019. \n \n5. I am currently residing at NewDay Apartments in Waukegan with John Margarella. I have \nobtained employment in a warehouse and will be able to move into my own place in the near \nfuture.     \n \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements are \ntrue and correct. \n \n \n7-2-20\n________________          ___________ \nJerry Davis            Date \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-18 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 1 PageID #:362\nDeclaration of Joshua Huddleston \n1.  My name is Joshua Huddleston. I was convicted in 2013 of predatory criminal sexual \nassault and sentenced to six years in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. I completed my \nprison term on January 22, 2019, but I remained imprisoned because I was unable to \nsecure housing.   \n2.  My parents were unable to help me find a place to stay outside of prison and did not \nhave room to let me stay with them.  \n3.  I am medically retired from the U.S. military and have savings sufficient to pay for my \nown housing for at least a year. But, while I was imprisoned, I wasn’t able to secure \nhousing because I couldn’t search for housing, sign a lease or set up utilities. Because of \nmy inability to find housing, I spent 16 months of “dead time” in prison.   \n4.  On June 8, 2020, I was released to New Beginnings at 6655 S. Perry in Chicago, where I \ncurrently resides with eight other parolees. New Beginnings is a very encouraging and \npositive place. Everyone here is very committed to succeeding on parole and highly \nmotivated to stay out of prison.  \n5.  We offer each other mutual support and encouragement; share our respective faiths; \nand all pitch in to make the house a home.   \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nstatements are true and correct. \n \n_______________________      __7-_1_-2_0______ \nJoshua Huddleston        Date \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 34-19 Filed: 07/02/20 Page 1 of 1 PageID #:363\nDeclaration of Ronald Garrison \n1.  My name is Ronald Garrison. I was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault in \n2009. I was sentenced to serve 12 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections and \nthree years of mandatory supervised release.  \n2.  I completed my sentence and became entitled to be released on MSR on March 6, 2019. \nHowever, because I was unable to secure housing, I remained imprisoned for 15 \nadditional months. I was released to New Beginnings at 6655 S. Perry, on June 12, 2020, \nwhen my mother and a friend agreed to help me pay for a month’s rent. I am currently \nresiding at New Beginnings with eight other parolees at this address.  \n3.  New Beginnings is a structured environment where the residents look out for and \nsupport one another. We have a brief meeting every day where we discuss ways to stay \npositive and hopeful for the future. We have a support group twice a week where we \nshare insights and advice and offer each other support.   \n4.  I am looking for full-time employment that will enable me to pay rent and remain at \nNew Beginnings.

The named Plaintiffs are all members of the certified class in Murphy v. \nRaoul, 16-cv-11471. Each of the Plaintiffs remains imprisoned in the Illinois \nDepartment of Corrections (“IDOC”) beyond the completion of his court-ordered \nterm of imprisonment because he does not have an approved “host site” at which to \nreside while on Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”). \n2.  Currently, the sole barrier to each of the named Plaintiffs’ release is an \nIllinois law that prohibits an individual on MSR for sex offense from living “at the \nsame address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the same \ncondominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows \nor reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on \nsupervision for a sex offense.” 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter the “One-Per-\nAddress Statute” or “the Statute”).  \n3.  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, contend \nthat continued enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Eighth \nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause and seek an injunction prohibiting \nDefendant Jeffreys from continuing to enforce the Statute.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, this Court has jurisdiction to declare the rights of the parties and to \ngrant all further relief deemed necessary and proper.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 3 of 23 PageID #:80\n5.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in \nthis district. \nTHE PARTIES \n6.  Defendant Rob Jeffreys is sued in his official capacity as director of the \nIllinois Department of Corrections. In his capacity as the director of IDOC, he has \nfinal authority to set the Department of Corrections’ policies with regard to \napproval of prisoners’ host sites. The Department of Corrections’ power to approve \nor deny proposed host sites is the sole mechanism through which the One-Per-\nAddress Statute is enforced.    \n7.  The named Plaintiffs are individuals who are entitled to release from IDOC \nand, as set forth in full below, have places to live outside of IDOC that would be \napprovable host sites but for the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n8.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all individuals who have \nserved their entire sentence of imprisonment and are entitled to release on MSR but \nremain in prison because they cannot obtain a host site that satisfies the One-Per-\nAddress Statute.  \nRELEVANT FACTS \nThe Murphy Litigation \n9.  The plaintiffs in Murphy challenged the constitutionality of the “host site” \nrequirement as it was being applied to individuals who have been sentenced to an \nindeterminate term of “three years to life” on MSR. Such individuals face the \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:81\npossibility of being imprisoned for life if they are unable to find and/or pay for \nhousing that meets the requirements imposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy \nbecause their MSR time never begins to run until they are released from prison to \nan approved host site. See 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(e). \n10.  The Murphy plaintiffs identified several layers of restrictions that limit \nwhere people sentenced to indeterminate MSR can live, which, taken together, \nmake it virtually impossible for the members of the class to find host sites. Among \nthe restrictions are the following: \n•   Sections of the Illinois Criminal Code which make it a crime for any \nindividual classified as a “child sex offender” to live within 500 feet of a \nschool, playground, or daycare (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10));  \n \n•   Sections of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections which prohibit persons \nrequired to register as sex offenders from living “near” “parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places \nwhere minor children congregate without advance approval of an agent of \nthe Department of Corrections” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)); \n \n•   The One-Per-Address Statute which requires individuals on MSR for sex \noffenses to “refrain from residing at the same address or in the same \ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender,” unless residing at a \n“licensed transitional housing facility for sex offenders,” a facility \n“operated or licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services \nor by the Department of Human Services,” or a “licensed medical facility” \n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6));  \n \n•   Housing restrictions imposed purely as a matter of IDOC policy, including \nprohibiting living in a host site where children visit or reside (including \nthe parolee’s own children), where there are computers or Wi-Fi access, \nand/or where there is no land-line telephone;  \n \n•   The unavailability of half-way houses, transitional housing, homeless \nshelters or other free or low-cost housing for indigent parolees; and \n \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 5 of 23 PageID #:82\n•   The IDOC’s interpretation of the One-Per-Address Statute as prohibiting \na sex offender parolee from living in a building adjacent to a building \nwhere another registrant lives and/or from living in the same trailer park \nas another registrant. \n \n11.  On April 6, 2018, Murphy was certified as a class action on behalf of “all \nindividuals sentenced to serve three-years-to-life on MSR currently detained in the \nIDOC who have been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been \ndenied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved \nhost site.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 63.  \n12.  On March 31, 2019, this Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgement on their claim that the State’s statutory and regulatory scheme violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-\n11471, ECF No. 132; Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. 2019). \n13.  This Court’s summary judgment decision did not single out a particular \nIllinois law or IDOC policy that violated the constitution. Rather, the Court held \nthat the State’s “statutory and regulatory scheme” as a whole (i.e., the overlapping \nrestrictions imposed by Illinois law, the IDOC’s interpretation of the law, and \nIDOC’s policies) violates the Murphy class’s constitutional rights. \n14.  On January 15, 2020, the Court entered a permanent injunction requiring \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections to put forth a plan “setting forth the specific \nsteps [the Defendants] will take to ensure that by no later than January 2, 2021, no \nmember of the class will remain imprisoned due to an inability to comply with the \nhost site requirement.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156.     \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:83\n15.   The permanent injunction also calls for the IDOC to provide the Court with \nperiodic status reports concerning its implementation of the compliance plan and \nprogress towards the January 2, 2021, compliance deadline. Id. \n16.  At the time of this filing, it is counsel’s understanding that the IDOC has \nsucceeded in releasing only four members of the Murphy class from IDOC. Each of \nthose individuals was detained in IDOC for more than eight years beyond the \ncompletion of his prison sentence.   \n17.  As of March 2020, the Murphy class comprises 297 individuals who remain \nin prison beyond the completion of their court-ordered sentence of imprisonment \ndue to an inability to meet the host site requirement.  \n18.  The IDOC’s compliance plan for meeting the January 2, 2021, deadline \nincludes several worthwhile proposals, including changes to IDOC interpretation of \nstatutory restrictions (e.g., not applying the One-Per-Address Statute to trailer \nparks and adjacent buildings); changes to restrictive IDOC policies (e.g., allowing \nindividuals to reside at addresses with Wi-Fi; relaxation of the land-line \nrequirement); and contracting with private vendors to provide transitional housing. \nMurphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. \n19.  The compliance plan also notes that “[t]here are many statutory provisions \nthat impede the Department’s ability to approve prospective host sites for sex \noffenders” and states that the Department “hopes that some of the statutory \nimpediments to identifying host sites can be reduced or eliminated through \nlegislative change.”  Id. at 3-4.     \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:84\nThe Challenged Statute \n20.  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n21.  The sole mechanism through which the One-Per-Address Statue is enforced \nis through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of parolees’ proposed host sites. That is, \nit is not a criminal offense for an individual on MSR for a sex offense to live at the \nsame address as another registrant.1 \n22.  The One-Per-Address Statute went into effect on July 11, 2005. Prior to \nthat date, individuals on MSR for sex offenses were permitted to live in the same \nresidence as other registrants. \n23.  On information and belief, the One-Per-Address Statute is a major cause, if \nnot the single largest cause, of the continued imprisonment of members of the \nMurphy class. This is so because other statutes (e.g., the 500-foot rules) already \nstrictly circumscribe the areas where individuals convicted of sex offenses may live, \nand the One-Per-Address Statute makes it so only one parolee can live at each \ncompliant property, even if it is a large apartment complex with many units.  \n24.  There is no reason to conclude that people who have been convicted of sex \noffenses’ living near one another contributes to criminality. At least one analysis \nfound that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re-offense and \n                                                        \n1   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:85\nimproves supervision. A Minnesota Department of Corrections report concluded as \nfollows:  \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative \neffect related to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In \nfact, supervision agents in both Hennepin and Ramsey County have noted \nbenefits from having more than one level three offender living in one \nlocation. Closer supervision is possible because travel time between \noffenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who live with other level \nthree offenders experience more visits from a supervising agent because \nagents for both offenders visit the same property. Finally, offenders tend \nto inform on each other when supervision restrictions are violated or \ncrimes are committed.2  \n \n25.  There is no logical reason to believe that there is a compelling public safety \nneed to prohibit people on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same address as \none another, and in the Murphy litigation the IDOC did not come forth with any \nsafety or rehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute. \nMany Murphy Class Members Would Be Out of Prison But For the One-Per-\nAddress Statute \n \nA. NewDay Apartments Has Four Valid Host Sites Available for Murphy \nClass Members  \n \n26.  NewDay Apartments, located in Lake County, Illinois, has partnered with \nthe IDOC to provide housing to individuals with sex offense convictions being \nreleased from prison onto MSR. \n27.  NewDay specializes in providing compliant housing to registrants. It \ncurrently owns seven properties which are more than 500 feet away from any \n                                                        \n2   See “Level Three Sex Offender Residential Placement Issues,” Minnesota Department of \nCorrections (available at: \nhttps://mn.gov/doc/assets/Lvl%203%20SEX%20OFFENDERS%20report%202003%20(revise\nd%202-04)_tcm1089-272828.pdf) (last visited April 3, 2020) \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:86\nschools, playgrounds and/or daycares. One of these properties is reserved for a \nprivate-pay registrant on parole; one property currently houses a non-registrant \n(but will be leased to a registrant when the current tenant moves out); and one \nproperty houses six registrants who are not on parole or probation.  \n28.  NewDay currently leases the other four properties to IDOC for the purpose \nof housing Murphy class members who cannot otherwise secure housing. Placement \nat NewDay is intended to give individuals who do not have the means or ability to \nsecure a host site an opportunity to get out of prison and begin their MSR time in \nthe community.  \n29.  Murphy class members released to NewDay are given three to four months \nrent-free to give them an opportunity to find work, obtain government benefits to \nwhich they are entitled, and to secure housing of their own.  \n30.  IDOC has begun releasing Murphy class members to NewDay Apartments. \nTo date, four Murphy class members have been placed at NewDay. IDOC has been \nprioritizing the release of individuals who have done the most “dead-time” (i.e., \nextra time in prison beyond the completion of their sentence).  \n31.  Due to the One-Per-Address Statute, the IDOC is only using half of its \ncapacity for housing Murphy class members at the properties it leases from \nNewDay. That is, the units IDOC leases from NewDay have eight separate \nbedrooms and could comfortably accommodate eight parolees at no additional cost \nto the IDOC. But because of constraints imposed by the One-Per-Address Statute, \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:87\nIDOC has only released four Murphy class members to these properties—one at \neach separate address.  \n32.  Plaintiff Columbo Galindo is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center. \nIn 2008, he was convicted of criminal sexual assault and sentenced to five years in \nIDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. With “good time” credits, he completed his \nprison term on March 11, 2011, and has been entitled to release from prison on \nMSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure \ncompliant housing. Because of his inability to find housing, Galindo has spent more \nthan nine years of “dead time” in prison.  \n33.  On information and belief, Plaintiff Galindo is next in line for placement at \nNewDay Apartments because he has done the most “dead time” of any member of \nthe Murphy class who remains in prison.  \n34.  On January 23, 2020, Galindo met with a representative of Field Services  \nat Taylorville.3 Galindo was told that he is approved for release to NewDay \nApartments and will be released when one of the units at NewDay becomes \navailable. He was not given any definitive timeline of when a unit would be \navailable for him. He remains imprisoned indefinitely until a unit at NewDay \nbecomes available. \n35.  Plaintiff Andra Sampson is a prisoner at Big Muddy River Correctional \nCenter. In 2007 he was convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault and \nsentenced to six years in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. With “good time” \n                                                        \n3   Field Services is the IDOC unit charged with responsibility for investigation and \napproval of host sites. \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:88\ncredits, he completed his prison term on March 18, 2011, and has been entitled to \nrelease from prison on MSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has \nbeen unable to secure compliant housing. Because of his inability to find housing, \nSampson has spent more than nine years of “dead time” in prison.  \n36.  On information and belief, Sampson is second in line (behind Galindo) for \nplacement at NewDay Apartments because he has done the second most “dead \ntime” among Murphy class members who remain in prison.  \n37.  In April 2020, Sampson met with Connie Halliday, a counselor in the Field \nServices office at Big Muddy River Correctional Center. Ms. Halliday informed \nSampson that he is approved for placement at NewDay Apartments and will be \nreleased when one of the units at NewDay becomes available. He was not given any \ndefinitive timeline of when a unit would be available for him, but Ms. Halliday \nexpressed hope that he would be released “soon.” He remains imprisoned \nindefinitely until a unit at NewDay becomes available. \n38.  Plaintiff John Margarella is a prisoner at Dixon Correctional Center. In \n2012, he was convicted of possession of child pornography and sentenced to three \nyears in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. With “good time” credits, he completed \nhis prison term on December 30, 2013, and has been entitled to release from prison \non MSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has been unable to \nsecure compliant housing. Because of his inability to find housing, Margarella has \nspent more than six years of “dead time” in prison. \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:89\n39.  Margarella is at high risk for suffering serious health complications if he \ncontracts COVID-19 while imprisoned. Margarella has suffered two heart attacks, \ninternal bleeding, and dangerously low blood pressure while imprisoned at Dixon \nCorrectional Center beyond his out date. In the past five years, he has needed an \nemergency blood transfusion and insertion of five stents to adequately open his \nblood vessels.   \n40.  Margarella does not have any friends or family outside of prison who can \noffer him a place to live while on MSR or help him pay for housing. He remains \nimprisoned indefinitely until a unit at NewDay Apartments becomes available.  \n41.  There is no reason why the properties IDOC leases from NewDay \nApartment should sit half vacant when individuals such as Galindo, Sampson and \nMargarella are entitled to release and could be serving their MSR time in the \ncommunity at no additional expense to IDOC.   \nB. Wayside Cross Ministries Seeks to Provide Host Sites to at Least 10 \nMurphy Class Members \n \n42.  Wayside Cross Ministries is a Bible-based mission that has operated in \nAurora, Illinois, for more than 90 years. \n43.  The Master’s Touch Ministry at Wayside Cross is a Bible-based, residential \nlife-transformation program for troubled men. The program offers room and board \nat no cost, and empowers its participants to change their lives through prayer, Bible \nstudy, daily church services, mentoring with local clergy, and work rehabilitation \nprograms. It takes a minimum of seven months for a resident to complete the \nMaster’s Touch Ministry program. The end goal of the program is to give the men \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:90\nthe tools they need to live healthy, law abiding lives, and the ability to secure their \nown employment and housing.  \n44.  Wayside Cross currently has 20 openings in the Master’s Touch Ministry \nand is willing to accept members of the Murphy class at no cost to the IDOC or to \nthe men.4 \n45.  The participants in the Masters Touch Ministry all reside together in a \ndormitory setting at Wayside Cross, located at 215 E. New York Street in Aurora. \nThus, placement at Wayside Cross does not comply with the One-Per-Address \nStatute.  \n46.  Plaintiffs Kenneth Green, Fredrick Chamblis, Corey Crowe, Dana Monson, \nDavid Easton, Joshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, Wade Council, Christopher \nShelton and Mark Faller are all members of the Murphy class who have completed \ntheir sentences of incarceration and are entitled to release from IDOC on MSR, but \nremain imprisoned because they do not have resources to secure compliant housing.  \n47.  Plaintiffs Green, Chamblis, Crowe, Monson, Easton, Atkins, Schroeder, \nCouncil, Shelton and Faller all would like to participate in the Master’s Touch \nMinistry at Wayside Cross. \n48.  Staff at Wayside Cross have conducted phone interviews with Plaintiffs \nGreen, Chamblis, Crowe, Monson, Easton, Atkins, Schroeder, Council, Shelton and \n                                                        \n4   Because of its proximity to a playground, Wayside Cross cannot accept into its program \nindividuals who are classified as “child sex offenders,” but it can accept individuals whose \noffenses involved an adult victim. Undersigned counsel has confirmed with Aurora \nCorporation Counsel Rick Veenstra that Aurora police are willing to register parolees at \nWayside Cross provided they are not classified as “child sex offenders.”  The ten Plaintiffs \nseeking placement at Wayside Cross are not classified as “child sex offenders.” \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:91\nFaller. Wayside Cross has determined that each of these men meets the criteria for \nadmission to the Master’s Touch Ministry. Wayside Cross is prepared to accept \nthese individuals immediately, provided they test negative for COVID-19. \n49.  In connection with these phone interviews, Jon Beall, the program director \nof the Master’s Touch Ministry, spoke to Field Services officials from the IDOC \nfacilities at which the Plaintiffs are imprisoned. The Field Services officials stated \nthat the Plaintiffs will not be approved for release to Wayside Cross in the absence \nof a “court order” allowing them to reside there.  \n50.  The sole reason Plaintiffs Green, Chamblis, Crowe, Monson, Easton, \nAtkins, Schroeder, Council, Shelton and Faller have not been approved for release \nto Wayside Cross is the One-Per-Address Statute, which prohibits them from living \nat the same address as one another or as others who are required to register as sex \noffenders. \nC. Members of the Murphy Class Could Be Released to Placements with \nFamily   \n \n51.  Plaintiff Jonathan Sparks is a member of the Murphy class. He is currently \na prisoner at Big Muddy River Correctional Center. In 2010, Sparks was convicted \nof criminal sexual assault and sentenced to four years in IDOC plus three-years-to-\nlife MSR. He completed his prison term on July 29, 2013, and has been entitled to \nrelease from prison on MSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has \nbeen unable to secure housing. Because of his inability to find housing, Sparks has \nspent nearly seven years of “dead time” in prison. \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:92\n52.  All of Sparks’ family is out of state. Sparks seeks to live with his mother \nwho resides in Chappell, Nebraska, while on MSR. Sparks’ mother is willing and \nable to house and support Sparks if he is released to her home. \n53.  Sparks sought approval for interstate transfer to Nebraska to reside with \nhis mother. IDOC rejected the placement solely because Sparks’ mother lives with \nher brother (Mr. Sparks’ uncle) who was convicted of a sex offense in the 1990s and \nreleased from prison in 2000.  \n54.  The One-Per-Address Statute is the sole reason Mr. Sparks has not been \napproved to reside with his mother and uncle. \nD. Members of the Murphy Class Could Be Released to Single-Room \n  Occupancies and Extended-Stay Motels \n \n55.  Plaintiff Joshua Huddleston is a member of the Murphy class. He is \ncurrently a prisoner at Robinson Correctional Center. In 2013, Huddleston was \nconvicted of predatory criminal sexual assault and sentenced to six years in IDOC \nplus three-years-to-life MSR. He completed his prison term on January 22, 2019, \nand has been entitled to release from prison on MSR since that date, but remains \nimprisoned because he has been unable to secure housing. Because of his inability \nto find housing, Huddleston has spent 15 months of “dead time” in prison. \n56.  Huddleston does not have any family outside of prison who can offer him a \nplace to stay or help him secure housing.  \n57.  Huddleston is retired from the U.S. military and has a savings account with \nsufficient funds to pay for his own housing for at least a year. However, because he \nis imprisoned, he is not able to search for housing, sign a lease, or set up utilities.  \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:93\n58.  For an individual in Mr. Huddleston’s position, an extended-stay motel or a \nsingle-room occupancy (SRO) building are the only viable options for securing \nhousing at which to live while on MSR. This is so because IDOC requires \nfunctioning utilities at the host site prior to approving an individual for release, and \nan individual who doesn’t have outside help can’t set up a phone line and electric \nservice while imprisoned. \n59.  Mr. Huddleston would like to parole to an extended-stay motel or an SRO. \nSuch a host site would be ideal for him because such locations are furnished and \nhave utilities included. Staying at such a location for a period of several months \nwould enable Huddleston to start his MSR time, get back on his feet and locate \nsuitable housing of his own.  \n60.  InTown Suites, located at 350 East Roosevelt, Villa Park 60181, offers \nfurnished rentals on a monthly basis. InTown is willing to rent to an individual on \nparole provided they have funds to pay for a month in advance and can show valid \nidentification. On information and belief, InTown Suites complies with the \nrestriction on living within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and daycares.  \n61.  As a matter of long-standing past practice, IDOC has not considered motels \nor SROs to be approvable host sites for individuals who are required to register as \nsex offenders due to the One-Per-Address statute. It has been the IDOC’s position \nthat such a placement is not sufficiently stable because an individual could be \nforced to move if another registrant moves into the same building. \n   \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:94\nHealth Risks of Detention in IDOC Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n62.  We are in the midst of a world-wide health crisis caused by the rapid spread \nof coronavirus and COVID-19. The number of known COVID-19 infections is rising \nat an alarming rate. As of April 27, 2020, there have been more than 3 million \ninfections globally5; and Illinois alone has nearly 46,000 known cases.6 More than \n210,000 people have died.7   \n63.  The risks to the health of individuals detained in close proximity to one \nanother in prisons—as well as the staff, attorneys, medical professionals, and clergy \nwho visit and work in these prisons—cannot be overstated. COVID-19 is highly \ncontagious between people who are in close contact with one another.8  \n64.  The virus is transmissible through coughing, sneezing, and contact with \nsurfaces.9 Experts advise that “talking” and “normal breathing” also likely transmit \n                                                        \n5  Johns Hopkins University, Coronavirus Resource Center,  \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html (last visited April 27, 2020). \n \n6   Illinois Department of Public Health, Corona Virus Response, \nhttps://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19 (last visited April 27, 2020). \n \n7   See note 5, supra. \n \n8   “How COVID-19 Spreads,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html)  \n \n9   Id. \n \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 18 of 23 PageID #:95\nthe disease.10 The CDC urges social distancing—i.e., every person should remain at \nleast six feet away from every other person—to avoid transmission of the disease.11  \n65.  Social distancing is of paramount importance because even entirely \nasymptomatic persons can be infected with COVID-19 and unknowingly transmit it \nto others.12  \n66.  Proper sanitation measures, including frequent hand washing and frequent \ncleaning of surfaces with approved disinfectants, are also recommended.13 Governor \nPritzker has issued a state-wide “stay at home” order to slow the disease’s spread.14  \n67.  None of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 \nare possible for persons confined in prisons and those who must interact with them.  \n68.  Illinois officials have publicly acknowledged the severe risk COVID-19 \nposes to those detained in IDOC and the impossibility of proper mitigation \nmeasures in correctional facilities. At Governor Pritzker’s April 4, 2020, press \n                                                        \n10    “Experts tell White House coronavirus can spread through talking or even just \nbreathing, CNN, April 2, 2020 (available at: \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/health/aerosol-coronavirus-spread-white-house-\nletter/index.html)  \n \n11    “Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission,” Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Mar. 12, 2020 (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf) \n12   See note 8, supra. \n \n13    “How to Protect Yourself,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)  \n \n14    “Governor Pritzker’s Executive Orders and Rules,” Illinois Dept. of Public Health \nhttps://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/governor-pritzkers-executive-orders-and-rules. \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:96\nbriefing,15 Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike stated as \nfollows: \nWe have seen clusters of cases in ... correctional centers.... I want to touch on \nthe difficulty of preventing the virus from infiltrating these congregate \nsettings and the challenges of stopping that spread. The natural movement of \npeople needing to come in and out of those settings, even when they’re \ndecreased to the minimal amount, still ... increases the potential for rapid \nspread of the virus to people who live, eat and recreate all in the same space. \nOptions for medical isolation of these COVID-19 patients are limited. ... \nIdeally, people who are positive should be isolated individually, and close \ncontacts should be quarantined individually. However, that can’t always be \npossible given the constraints of space. \n \n69.  At Stateville Correctional Center, 122 prisoners have been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19. There are confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 15 IDOC facilities to date.16  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n70.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs seek certification of this \ncomplaint as a class action for purposes of equitable relief on behalf of a class \ndefined as follows.  \n•  All individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and completed their \ncourt-imposed sentence of incarceration but remain imprisoned in the \nIllinois Department of Corrections because they cannot find housing that \ncomplies with the One-Per-Address Statute, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n \n                                                        \n15  “Daily Corona Virus Press Briefings, Illinois Dept. of Public Health, \nhttp://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and- conditions/diseases-a-z-\nlist/coronavirus/media-publications/daily-press-briefings  \n16    “COVID-19 Response,” Illinois Dept. of Corrections,  \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx (last visited April 27, \n2020) \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:97\n71.  The class seeks a declaration that the One-Per-Address Statute violates the \nEighth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause as applied to them and an \ninjunction prohibiting Defendant from continuing to enforce the Statute.    \n72.  The proposed class is numerous. According to the final report of the Illinois \nSex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration Task Force, published in December 2017, \n“[o]n average, the Illinois Department of Corrections houses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders \nwho may not be released from custody because they are unable to secure \npermanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute requirements or agency \npolicy.”17 On information and belief, the number of individuals imprisoned in IDOC \ndue to a lack of compliant housing has grown substantially since the publication of \nthat report. If only five percent of those individuals are being held due to the One-\nPer-Address Statute, the class would easily satisfy the numerosity requirement.  \n73.   There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, \nincluding but not limited to the following: \n•  What are the rationales for the One-Per-Address Statute;  \n \n•  Whether there is any compelling interest served by the Statute; \n \n•  Whether the Statute violates the Eighth Amendment and Equal \nProtection Clause as applied to the members of the class.   \n \n74.   All individuals falling within the class definition are subject to the same \nStatute. Given the commonality of the questions pertinent to all class members, a \nsingle judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. \n                                                        \n17   Available at: http://www.icjia.state.il.us/news/sex-offenses-and-sex-offender-\nregistration-task-force-final-report \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:98\n75.   Defendant has acted and continues to act in a manner adverse to the \nrights of the proposed class, making final declaratory relief appropriate with respect \nto the class as a whole. \n76.   The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe class; and the named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all members \nof the proposed class. \n77.   Plaintiffs’ counsel has extensive experience and has devoted substantial \nprofessional and financial resources to representing individuals in cases involving \nthe same type of claim raised here—namely, the Murphy class action. Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \nCOUNT I   \n42 U.S.C. §1983 – EIGHTH AMENDMENT \n \n78.   Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the class they seek to represent, \nreallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, each and every \nallegation contained above.  \n79.   In Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019), this Court \nhas already concluded that it violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth \nAmendment to subject individuals to indefinite incarceration solely because they \ncannot meet the host-site requirement, holding as follows:  \nAt the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is \nfreedom from indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The Attorney \nGeneral and Director’s current application of the host site requirement \nresults in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs’ fundamental rights and \ntherefore contravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nConstitution of the United States.  \n \n  21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:99\n80.   The One-Per-Address Statute is the sole reason the named Plaintiffs and \nthe members of the proposed class remain imprisoned in violation of their Eighth \nAmendment rights. \n81.   Thus, the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as \napplied to the named Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class.  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)  Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(2); \n \nb)  Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g); \n \nc)  Enter judgment declaring that 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) as applied to \nPlaintiffs and the members of the class violates the Eighth Amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution; \n \nd)  Enter a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendant from continuing to \nenforce 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6); \n \ne)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and cost pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law; and \n \nf)   Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \n COUNT II   \n42 U.S.C. §1983 – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT – EQUAL PROTECTION \n \n82.   Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the class they seek to represent, \nreallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, each and every \nallegation contained above.  \n83.   The One-Per-Address Statute violates the Equal Protection Clause as \napplied to the named Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class.  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 16 Filed: 04/28/20 Page 23 of 23 PageID #:100\na)  Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to Fed.

Here, Plaintiffs have \nidentified housing that would otherwise be approved by IDOC, but for the “One \nPerson Per Address” provision in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). This Court has already \ndetermined that it is unconstitutional to detain sex offenders long after their period \nof incarceration has been completed solely because they are unable to find suitable \nhost sites. See Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3rd 781 (N.D. Ill. 2019).  \n    The following Plaintiffs have identified host sites that will be supportive of \ntheir transition back into the community:  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 22 Filed: 05/13/20 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:165\n•  Kenneth Green, Fredrick Chamblis, Corey Crowe, Dana Monson, David \nEaston, Joshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, Wade Council, Christopher \nShelton, Mark Faller and Paul D. Hubbard seek to reside at Wayside Cross \nMinistries, a Bible-based transitional housing program in Aurora, Illinois; \n \n•  DeJuan Wright, Jerrand Miller, Andra Sampson and John Margarella seek \nto reside at transitional housing leased by IDOC through NewDay \nApartments; and \n \n•  Alvin Goldberg seeks to reside in a private-pay unit in an apartment building \nowned by NewDay Apartments. \n \n    At each of these proposed housing locations, another person who has been \nconvicted of a sex offense already resides in the same building and therefore \nDefendant cannot release these individuals to the proposed locations because of its \nobligation to follow 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n    There has been no legitimate public interest articulated in only having one \nsex offender live at one residence. Therefore, the Court finds that the statute is \nunconstitutional as it applies to the 16 individuals identified above and Defendant \nis enjoined from prohibiting their release to the locations identified only to the \nextent that it is prohibiting their release based upon the “One Person Per Address” \nprovision in 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). It is further ordered that Defendant is \nenjoined from enforcing the statute as to the parolees currently residing at NewDay \nApartments for so long as they continue to reside there: Stanley Meyer, J.D. \nLindenmeier, Clay Trench, and Jerry Davis.  \n \n \n___________________________          _May 13, 2020___ \nHon.

In support, Plaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of a proposed class, challenge the \nconstitutionality of 730 ILCS5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter the “One-Per-Address \nStatute” or “the Statute”), a section of the Illinois Code of Corrections that prohibits \nan individual on Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) for a sex offense from \nliving “at the same address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or \nin the same condominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or \nshe knows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed \non supervision for a sex offense.” Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on April 5, \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:180\n2020, and their First Amended Complaint on April 28, 2020. Defendant has not yet \nfiled a responsive pleading.  \n2.  Plaintiffs request leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (attached hereto \nas Exhibit 1) for the purpose of adding additional named Plaintiffs who seek \nimmediate injunctive relief. The Second Amended Complaint also expands the \ndefinition of the proposed class. In particular, the initial proposed class definition \nencompassed only those individuals who remained in prison and were unable to \nsecure their release on MSR because of the One-Per-Address Statute. The class \ndefinition in the Second Amended Complaint includes those individuals who have \nbeen released on MSR into the community but face a risk of having their MSR \nrevoked and being sent back to prison for violation of the One-Per-Address Statute. \nThe Second Amended Complaint puts forth the same legal theories as the First \nAmended Complaint.  \n3.  Plaintiffs also seek leave to file an amended motion to certify the class \n(attached hereto as Exhibit 2) to address this broader class definition. In their \namended motion for class certification, Plaintiffs offer a proposed class definition \nencompassing both those who are unable to secure their release from prison due to \nthe One-Per-Address Statute and those who face a risk of revocation due to the \nStatute.  \n4.  Defendant does not oppose Plaintiffs’ request for leave to file a Second \nAmended Complaint and Amended Motion for Class Certification.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:181\n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court grant \nthem leave to file instanter their Second Amended Complaint and Amended Motion \nfor Class Certification. \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Adele D.

All of the named Plaintiffs are in the custody of the Illinois Department of \nCorrections (“IDOC”) and have been convicted of sex offenses. \n2.  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) \n(hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute” or “the Statute”), a section of the Illinois \nCode of Corrections that prohibits an individual on Mandatory Supervised Release \n(“MSR”) for a sex offense from living “at the same address or in the same \ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium complex or \napartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably should know \nis a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision for a sex offense,” on \nits face and as applied to them.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 3 of 25 PageID #:184\n3.  In order to be released from the physical custody of an IDOC facility at the \ncompletion of their court-imposed sentences of incarceration, Plaintiffs must \nidentify an approved “host site” at which to reside while on MSR. \n4.  As of this filing, 25 of the named Plaintiffs have completed their court-\nimposed sentences of incarceration and are approved for release on MSR, but they \nall remain imprisoned because they do not have an approved “host site” at which to \nreside while on MSR. Each of these individuals has a suitable place to live outside \nof prison that would meet IDOC approval but for the One-Per-Address Statute.1  \n5.  Eleven of the named Plaintiffs have been released from prison to host sites in \nthe community, but they all are at risk of having their MSR revoked and being sent \nback to IDOC because their housing does not comply with the One-Per-Address \nStatute.2  \n6.  One of the named Plaintiffs (Thomas Smith) has not yet completed his \nsentence of incarceration, but is currently making a plan for his release on MSR \n(scheduled for January 2021). Solely because of the One-Per-Address Statute, he \nwill be unable to obtain IDOC approval to serve his MSR at his parents’ home. \n                                                        \n1   The 25 Plaintiffs who remain imprisoned are Columbo Galindo, Andra Sampson, \nDeJuan Wright, Jerrand Miller, John Margarella, Kenneth Green, David Easton, Paul D. \nHubbard, Juan Medina, Adam Escamilla, Aishef Shaffer, Edward Bartgen, Reginald \nHarris, Johnny Harris, Lavonne Givens, Lashaun Dean, Justin Fluckert, Dontae Boykin, \nRonald Garrison, Joshua Huddleston, Manuel Aleman, Arnold Lloyd, Melvin Kelley, Andre \nDunn, and Alvin Goldberg. \n \n2  The 11 Plaintiffs who have been released but are at risk of revocation are Marcus \nBarnes, Luis Aponte, Kevin Manson, Fredrick Chamblis, Corey Crowe, Dana Monson, \nJoshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, Wade Council, Christopher Shelton and Mark Faller. \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 4 of 25 PageID #:185\n7.  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, contend \nthat continued enforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Eighth \nAmendment and the Equal Protection Clause and seek an injunction prohibiting \nDefendant Jeffreys from continuing to enforce the Statute.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, this Court has jurisdiction to declare the rights of the parties and to \ngrant all further relief deemed necessary and proper.  \n9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), as a \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in \nthis district. \nTHE PARTIES \n10.  Defendant Rob Jeffreys is sued in his official capacity as director of the \nIllinois Department of Corrections. In his capacity as the director of IDOC, he has \nfinal authority to set the Department of Corrections’ policies with regard to \napproval of prisoners’ host sites. The Department of Corrections’ power to approve \nor deny proposed host sites is the sole mechanism through which the One-Per-\nAddress Statute is enforced.    \n11.  The named Plaintiffs are individuals who have been convicted of sex \noffenses and have identified places to live outside of IDOC that would be approvable \nhost sites but for the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 5 of 25 PageID #:186\n12.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all individuals who have \nbeen convicted of sex offenses and cannot identify a host site at which to live while \non MSR that satisfies the One-Per-Address Statute.  \nRELEVANT FACTS \nThe Murphy Litigation \n13.  The plaintiffs in Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, challenged the \nconstitutionality of the “host site” requirement as it was being applied to \nindividuals who have been sentenced to an indeterminate term of “three years to \nlife” on MSR. Such individuals face the possibility of being imprisoned for life if they \nare unable to find and/or pay for housing that meets the requirements imposed by \nIllinois law and IDOC policy because their MSR time never begins to run until they \nare released from prison to an approved host site. See 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(e). \n14.  The Murphy plaintiffs identified several layers of restrictions that limit \nwhere people sentenced to indeterminate MSR can live, which, taken together, \nmake it virtually impossible for the members of the class to find host sites. Among \nthe restrictions are the following: \n•   Sections of the Illinois Criminal Code which make it a crime for any \nindividual classified as a “child sex offender” to live within 500 feet of a \nschool, playground, or daycare (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10));  \n \n•   Sections of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections which prohibit persons \nrequired to register as sex offenders from living “near” “parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places \nwhere minor children congregate without advance approval of an agent of \nthe Department of Corrections” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)); \n \n•   The One-Per-Address Statute which requires individuals on MSR for sex \noffenses to “refrain from residing at the same address or in the same \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 6 of 25 PageID #:187\ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender,” unless residing at a \n“licensed transitional housing facility for sex offenders,” a facility \n“operated or licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services \nor by the Department of Human Services,” or a “licensed medical facility” \n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6));  \n \n•   Housing restrictions imposed purely as a matter of IDOC policy, including \nprohibiting living in a host site where children visit or reside (including \nthe parolee’s own children), where there are computers or Wi-Fi access, \nand/or where there is no land-line telephone;  \n \n•   The unavailability of half-way houses, transitional housing, homeless \nshelters or other free or low-cost housing for indigent parolees; and \n \n•   The IDOC’s interpretation of the One-Per-Address Statute as prohibiting \na sex offender parolee from living in a building adjacent to a building \nwhere another registrant lives and/or from living in the same trailer park \nas another registrant. \n \n15.  On April 6, 2018, this Court certified Murphy as a class action on behalf of \n“all individuals sentenced to serve three-years-to-life on MSR currently detained in \nthe IDOC who have been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been \ndenied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved \nhost site.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 63.  \n16.  On March 31, 2019, this Court granted the Murphy plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgement on their claim that the State’s statutory and regulatory \nscheme violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment. Murphy \nv. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 132; Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. \n2019). \n17.  This Court’s summary judgment decision did not single out a particular \nIllinois law or IDOC policy that violated the constitution. Rather, the Court held \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 7 of 25 PageID #:188\nthat the State’s “statutory and regulatory scheme” as a whole (i.e., the overlapping \nrestrictions imposed by Illinois law, the IDOC’s interpretation of the law, and \nIDOC’s policies) violates the Murphy class’s constitutional rights. \n18.  On January 15, 2020, this Court entered a permanent injunction requiring \nthe Illinois Department of Corrections to put forth a compliance plan “setting forth \nthe specific steps [the Defendants] will take to ensure that by no later than January \n2, 2021, no member of the class will remain imprisoned due to an inability to comply \nwith the host site requirement.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156.     \n19.   The permanent injunction also calls for the IDOC to provide the Court with \nperiodic status reports concerning its implementation of the compliance plan and \nprogress towards the January 2, 2021, compliance deadline. Id. \n20.  As of this filing, the Murphy class comprises more than 300 individuals who \nremain in prison beyond the completion of their court-ordered sentence of \nimprisonment due to an inability to meet the host site requirement.  \n21.  The IDOC’s compliance plan for meeting the January 2, 2021, deadline \nincludes several worthwhile proposals, including changes to IDOC’s interpretation \nof certain statutory restrictions (e.g., not applying the One-Per-Address Statute to \ntrailer parks and adjacent buildings); changes to restrictive IDOC policies (e.g., \nallowing individuals to reside at addresses with Wi-Fi; relaxation of the land-line \nrequirement); and contracting with private vendors to provide transitional housing. \nMurphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 8 of 25 PageID #:189\n22.  The compliance plan also notes that “[t]here are many statutory provisions \nthat impede the Department’s ability to approve prospective host sites for sex \noffenders” and states that the Department “hopes that some of the statutory \nimpediments to identifying host sites can be reduced or eliminated through \nlegislative change.”  Id. at 3-4.   \nThe Challenged Statute \n23.  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n24.  The sole mechanism through which the One-Per-Address Statue is enforced \nis through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of parolees’ proposed host sites. That is, \nit is not a criminal offense for an individual on MSR for a sex offense to live at the \nsame address as another registrant.3 \n25.  The One-Per-Address Statute went into effect on July 11, 2005. Prior to \nthat date, individuals on MSR for sex offenses were permitted to live in the same \nresidence as other registrants. \n26.  On information and belief, the One-Per-Address Statute is a major cause, if \nnot the single largest cause, of the continued imprisonment of members of the \nproposed class. This is so because other statutes (e.g., the 500-foot rules) already \nstrictly circumscribe the areas where individuals convicted of sex offenses may live, \n                                                        \n3   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 9 of 25 PageID #:190\nand the One-Per-Address Statute makes it so only one parolee can live at each \ncompliant property, even if it is a large apartment complex with many units.  \n27.  There is no reason to conclude that allowing people who have been \nconvicted of sex offenses to live near one another contributes to criminality. At least \none analysis found that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re-\noffense and improves supervision. A Minnesota Department of Corrections report \nconcluded as follows:  \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative \neffect related to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In \nfact, supervision agents in both Hennepin and Ramsey County have noted \nbenefits from having more than one level three offender living in one \nlocation. Closer supervision is possible because travel time between \noffenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who live with other level \nthree offenders experience more visits from a supervising agent because \nagents for both offenders visit the same property. Finally, offenders tend \nto inform on each other when supervision restrictions are violated or \ncrimes are committed.4  \n \n28.  There is no logical reason to believe that there is a compelling public safety \nneed to prohibit people on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same address as \none another, and in the Murphy litigation the IDOC did not come forth with any \nsafety or rehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute. \n   \n                                                        \n4   See “Level Three Sex Offender Residential Placement Issues,” Minnesota Department of \nCorrections (available at: \nhttps://mn.gov/doc/assets/Lvl%203%20SEX%20OFFENDERS%20report%202003%20(revise\nd%202-04)_tcm1089-272828.pdf) (last visited April 3, 2020) \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 10 of 25 PageID #:191\nPlaintiffs and the Members of the Proposed Class Would Have Compliant \nPlaces to Live while on MSR But for the One-Per-Address Statute  \n \nA. NewDay Apartments Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class Members  \n \n29.  NewDay Apartments, located in Lake County, Illinois, has partnered with \nthe IDOC to provide housing to individuals with sex offense convictions being \nreleased from prison onto MSR. \n30.  NewDay specializes in providing compliant housing to registrants. It \ncurrently owns seven properties, all of which comply with the prohibition on \nresidence within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and daycares.  \n31.  NewDay currently leases four of these properties to IDOC for the purpose of \nhousing Murphy class members who cannot otherwise secure housing. Placement at \nNewDay is intended to give individuals who do not have the means or ability to \nsecure a host site an opportunity to get out of prison and begin their MSR time in \nthe community.  \n32.  Murphy class members released to NewDay are given three to four months \nrent-free to give them an opportunity to find work, obtain government benefits to \nwhich they are entitled, and to secure housing of their own.  \n33.  IDOC has begun releasing Murphy class members to NewDay Apartments. \nTo date, four Murphy class members have been placed at NewDay. IDOC has been \nprioritizing the release of individuals who have done the most “dead time” (i.e., \nextra time in prison beyond the completion of their sentence).  \n34.  Due to the One-Per-Address Statute, the IDOC is only using half of its \ncapacity for housing Murphy class members at the properties it leases from \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 11 of 25 PageID #:192\nNewDay. That is, the units IDOC leases from NewDay have eight separate \nbedrooms and could comfortably accommodate eight parolees at no additional cost \nto the IDOC. But because of constraints imposed by the One-Per-Address Statute, \nIDOC has only released four Murphy class members to these properties—one at \neach separate address.  \n35.  Plaintiffs DeJuan Wright, Jerrand Miller and Andra Sampson are members \nof the Murphy class. Wright, Miller and Sampson have each spent more than eight \nyears of “dead time” in prison due to their indigence and inability to secure housing. \nOn information and belief, they are the next three individuals in line for placement \nat NewDay Apartments because they have done the most “dead time” among the \nmembers of the Murphy class who remain in prison.  \n36.  Plaintiff John Margarella is a prisoner at Dixon Correctional Center. In \n2012, he was convicted of possession of child pornography and sentenced to three \nyears in IDOC plus three-years-to-life MSR. With “good time” credits, he completed \nhis prison term on December 30, 2013, and has been entitled to release from prison \non MSR since that date, but remains imprisoned because he has been unable to \nsecure compliant housing. Because of his inability to find housing, Margarella has \nspent more than six years of “dead time” in prison. \n37.  Margarella is at high risk for suffering serious health complications if he \ncontracts COVID-19 while imprisoned. Margarella has suffered two heart attacks, \ninternal bleeding, and dangerously low blood pressure while imprisoned at Dixon \nCorrectional Center beyond his out date.  \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 12 of 25 PageID #:193\n38.  Margarella does not have any friends or family outside of prison who can \noffer him a place to live while on MSR or help pay for his housing. He remains \nimprisoned indefinitely until a unit at NewDay Apartments becomes available.  \n39.  There is no reason why the properties IDOC leases from NewDay \nApartment should sit half vacant when individuals such as Plaintiffs Miller, \nWright, Sampson and Margarella are entitled to release and could be serving their \nMSR time in the community at no additional expense to IDOC.   \n40.  Pursuant to this Court’s May 13, 2020, Order (ECF No. 22), Plaintiffs \nMiller, Wright, Sampson and Margarella have been approved for release to these \nunits and can reside at NewDay Apartments pending further order of the Court. In \nthe absence of permanent injunctive relief, however, this housing will no longer be \nconsidered compliant, and these individuals will be at risk of having their MSR \nrevoked and being sent back to prison because of the One-Per-Address Statute. \n41.  In addition to the units NewDay Apartments leases to IDOC, NewDay also \nowns several other multi-unit properties that it privately rents to registrants. These \nproperties are considered compliant addresses for individuals subject to the \nprohibition on living within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and daycares.  \n42.  Because of the One-Per-Address Statute, these properties are currently only \navailable to registrants who are off MSR. But for the One-Per-Address Statute, \nNewDay would be willing to lease to individuals on MSR the apartments it \ncurrently makes available only to individuals who are off MSR.  \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 13 of 25 PageID #:194\n43.  Plaintiff Alvin Goldberg is a prisoner at Taylorville Correctional Center. \nWith “good time” credits, Goldberg completed his prison term on November 11, \n2018, and has been entitled to release from prison on MSR since that date, but he \nremains imprisoned because he has been unable to secure compliant housing. \nBecause of his inability to find housing, Goldberg has spent more than 18 months of \n“dead time” in prison. \n44.  Goldberg, who is 81 years old, is at high risk for suffering serious health \ncomplications if he contracts COVID-19 while imprisoned.  \n45.  Plaintiff Goldberg and his family are able to privately pay for an apartment \nthrough NewDay Apartments. Goldberg is on the waiting list to rent a unit from \nNewDay, subject to his being able to obtain “a court order allowing NewDay to \nhouse Alvin with other registrants who live in other units at the same address.” \n46.  Pursuant to this Court’s May 13, 2020, Order (ECF No. 22), Plaintiff \nGoldberg has been approved for release to NewDay when a unit becomes available \nand can reside at NewDay pending further order of the Court. In the absence of \npermanent injunctive relief, however, this housing will no longer be considered \ncompliant because of other registrants at the same address, and Goldberg will be at \nrisk of having his MSR revoked and being sent back to prison because of the One-\nPer-Address Statute. \nB. Wayside Cross Ministries Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class \nMembers \n \n47.  Wayside Cross Ministries is a Bible-based mission that has operated in \nAurora, Illinois, for more than 90 years. \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 14 of 25 PageID #:195\n48.  The Master’s Touch Ministry at Wayside Cross is a Bible-based, residential \nlife-transformation program for troubled men. The program offers room and board \nat no cost, and empowers its participants to change their lives through prayer, Bible \nstudy, daily church services, mentoring with local clergy, and work rehabilitation \nprograms. It takes a minimum of seven months for a resident to complete the \nMaster’s Touch Ministry program. The end goal of the program is to give the men \nthe tools they need to live healthy, law abiding lives, and the ability to secure their \nown employment and housing.  \n49.  The participants in the Masters Touch Ministry all reside together in a \ndormitory setting at Wayside Cross, located at 215 E. New York Street in Aurora. \nThus, placement at Wayside Cross does not comply with the One-Per-Address \nStatute.  \n50.  Pursuant to this Court’s May 13, 2020, Order (ECF No. 22), Plaintiffs \nAtkins, Schroeder, Chamblis, Crowe, Faller, Shelton, Monson and Council have \nbeen released to Wayside Cross Ministries and are currently participating in the \nMaster’s Touch Ministry program. Pursuant to the preliminary injunction order, \nthese Plaintiffs may reside at Wayside Cross pending further order of the court. In \nthe absence of permanent injunctive relief, however, these individuals will be at \nrisk of having their MSR revoked and being sent back to prison because of the One-\nPer-Address Statute.  \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 15 of 25 PageID #:196\n51.  Wayside Cross currently has additional openings in the Master’s Touch \nMinistry and is willing to accept additional members of the Murphy class at no cost \nto the IDOC or to the parolees.5 \n52.  Plaintiffs Kenneth Green, Paul Hubbard, David Easton, Juan Medina, \nAdam Escamilla, Ashief Shaffer, Reginald Harris and Edward Bartgen are all \nmembers of the Murphy class who have completed their sentences of incarceration \nand are entitled to release from IDOC on MSR, but remain imprisoned because they \ndo not have resources to secure compliant housing. Each of these Plaintiffs would \nlike to participate in the Master’s Touch Ministry at Wayside Cross. \n53.  On information and belief, each of these Plaintiffs meets the criteria for \nrelease to Wayside Cross and participation in the Master’s Touch Ministry.  \n54.  But for the One-Per-Address Statute, Wayside Cross Ministries would be \nwilling to accept these Plaintiffs and other individuals being released from IDOC on \nMSR for admission to the Master’s Touch Ministry. \nC. Jordan’s Dream Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class Members \n \n55.  Plaintiff Marcus Barnes was convicted in 2008 of criminal sexual assault \nand sentenced to serve 12 years in IDOC plus an indeterminate term of “three years \nto life” on MSR. With good time credits, Barnes completed his prison sentence on \nDecember 17, 2018, and was approved for release on MSR.  \n                                                        \n5   Because of its proximity to a playground, Wayside Cross cannot accept into its program \nindividuals who are classified as “child sex offenders,” but it can accept individuals whose \noffenses involved an adult victim. Undersigned counsel has confirmed with Aurora \nCorporation Counsel Rick Veenstra that Aurora police are willing to register parolees at \nWayside Cross provided they are not classified as “child sex offenders.”  The Plaintiffs \nseeking placement at Wayside Cross are not classified as “child sex offenders.” \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 16 of 25 PageID #:197\n56.  Barnes’ family identified 11 different potential host sites, all of which IDOC \nrejected for various reasons, including proximity to daycares and schools. Because of \nhis inability to secure compliant housing, Barnes spent more than 18 months of \n“dead time” in prison. \n57.  In February 2020, Barnes’ family found him a place to stay on the 5700 \nblock of South Sangamon in Chicago. The building is owned and operated by an \norganization called Jordan’s Dream, which provides transitional housing and \nsupportive services (such as help with locating employment, religious services, and \nconnections to mental health providers) to individuals who have been convicted of \nsex offenses.  \n58.  IDOC investigated the address and confirmed that it complies with the \nstatutory restrictions on proximity within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds, daycares \nand other places where children congregate.   \n59.  However, IDOC rejected the host site pursuant to the One-Per-Address \nStatute because another registrant resided there.  \n60.  Pursuant to this Court’s April 8, 2020, Order (ECF No. 11), Plaintiff Barnes \nwas released to Jordan’s Dream on April 14, 2020, and can reside there pending \nfurther order of the court. In the absence of permanent injunctive relief, however, \nthis housing will no longer be considered compliant, and Barnes will be at risk of \nhaving his MSR revoked and being sent back to prison because of the One-Per-\nAddress Statute. \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 17 of 25 PageID #:198\n61.  But for the One-Per-Address Statute, Jordan’s Dream would be willing to \noffer housing to other registrants being released from IDOC on MSR whenever \nopenings become available.  \nD. New Beginnings Has Valid Host Sites Available for Class Members \n62.  New Beginnings is a Chicago-based not-for-profit corporation. New \nBeginnings owns and operates five buildings on the South Side of Chicago at which \nit provides affordable transitional housing, meals and supportive services to \nindividuals who have been released from prison or have experienced homelessness.  \n63.  All five of the buildings New Beginnings owns are compliant with the \nrestriction on living within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds and daycares. \n64.  Plaintiffs Galindo, Huddleston, Givens, Dean, Fluckert, Boykin, Garrison, \nHarris, Aleman, Lloyd and Kelley have all completed their sentences of \nincarceration and are entitled to release from IDOC on MSR, but they all remain \nimprisoned because they have been unable to secure compliant housing. Each of \nthese Plaintiffs would like to reside while on MSR at properties operated by New \nBeginnings. Galindo, Huddleston, Givens, Dean, Boykin, Garrison, Harris and \nDunn would like to be released to 6655 S. Perry, Chicago, Illinois 60621; and \nFluckert, Aleman, Lloyd, and Kelley would like to be released to 11934 S. Lowe, \nChicago, Illinois 60628.  \n65.  Plaintiffs and/or their families are prepared to pay for their placements at \nthese locations. \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 18 of 25 PageID #:199\n66.  New Beginnings has sufficient beds available at each of these locations and \nis prepared to accept the Plaintiffs immediately.   \n67.  In the future, New Beginnings is prepared to offer housing to other \nmembers of the proposed class, space permitting. \n68.  The sole reason IDOC cannot approve Plaintiffs for release to New \nBeginnings properties is the One-Per-Address Statute. \nE. Individuals Who Have Been Released to Host Sites Outside of Prison \nare at Risk of Revocation  \n \n69.  Plaintiff Luis Aponte was released from IDOC onto MSR in January 2020 to \nhis father’s home in Waukegan, Illinois.  \n70.  The host site is in a four-story apartment building that contains \napproximately 12 separate units. When Aponte was released, no other registrant \nlived in the building. IDOC determined that the address complies with the \nprohibition on residing within 500 feet of a school, playground or daycare, and \napproved Aponte to live there while on MSR.  \n71.  Aponte is doing well on MSR. He has full-time employment in a warehouse \nand has been attending required sex offender therapy regularly. \n72.  In March 2020, another registrant (not on MSR) moved into a different unit \nin the same building where Aponte resides with his father.  \n73.  Aponte has received notice from his parole agent that if he does not find \nsomewhere else to live, he will have his MSR revoked and will be sent back to \nprison because the One-Per-Address Statute prohibits him from living in the same \napartment building as another registrant. \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 19 of 25 PageID #:200\n74.  Aponte has not been able to find another host site that IDOC will approve \nand that he can afford. He wants to keep residing with his father.  \n75.  If the One-Per-Address Statute is enforced against Aponte, he will have his \nMSR revoked and be sent back to prison, resulting in loss of his job, halting the \nprogress he has made on MSR so far, and forcing him to serve dead time until he \ncan secure a new place to live.  \n76.  Plaintiff Kevin Manson was released from IDOC onto MSR on May 6, 2020. \nHe currently resides in Chicago Heights, Illinois, with his aunt.  \n77.  IDOC approved Manson for release to his aunt’s home, but the approval \nwas given in error. When Manson tried to register with Chicago Heights police after \nhis release, he was informed that his aunt’s house is too close to a school. Chicago \nHeights police told him that he must move because he in violation of the prohibition \non residing within 500 feet of a school.  \n78.  Manson does not have funds to pay for housing of his own at present. The \nCook County Justice Advisory Council (“CCJAC”), a governmental entity that \nprovides reentry assistance to citizens returning to Cook County after \nimprisonment, is willing to pay for Manson’s housing.  \n79.  New Beginnings has a bed available for Manson at 11934 S. Lowe Chicago \nIllinois, 60628, and is able to take him immediately. As set forth above, this \nplacement complies with the restriction on residence within 500 feet of schools, \nplaygrounds and daycares. CCJAC is prepared to pay to house Manson at this \nlocation. \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 20 of 25 PageID #:201\n80.  IDOC cannot approve Manson to move to New Beginnings pursuant to the \nOne-Per-Address Statute because another registrant already lives at that address. \n81.  If the One-Per-Address Statute is enforced against Manson, he will have his \nMSR revoked and be sent back to prison. He will also be at serious risk of new \ncriminal charges for failure to register and/or for residing too close to a school. \nF. Class Members Could Be Released to Placements with Family   \n82.  Plaintiff Thomas Smith is an individual who is currently imprisoned in \nIDOC and is seeking a host site at which to reside while on “three-to-life” MSR.  \n83.  Plaintiff Smith’s mother Tammy and step-father Jerry would like to have \nThomas live with them at their home in Pocahontas, Illinois, while he is on MSR.  \n84.  Plaintiff Smith’s parents have a three-bedroom home and can give Thomas \nhis own bedroom and bathroom. The home is in a rural area, and it is not within \n500 feet of any schools, playgrounds, or daycares.  \n85.  Plaintiff Smith submitted his parents’ home as a proposed host site. IDOC \nrejected the host site because his stepfather was convicted of a sex offense 34 years \nago (in 1986), and the One-Per-Address Statute (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6)) prohibits \nThomas from residing at the same address as another person who has been \nconvicted of a sex offense—no matter how long ago.  \n86.  The only barrier to Plaintiff Smith’s being allowed to serve his MSR time at \nhis parents’ home is the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n   \n  20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 21 of 25 PageID #:202\nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n87.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs seek certification of this \ncomplaint as a class action for purposes of equitable relief on behalf of a class \ndefined as follows.  \n•  All individuals who are or will in the future be on Mandatory Supervised \nRelease for a sex offense and cannot secure housing that complies with the \nOne-Per-Address Statute, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6).  \n \n88.  The class seeks a declaration that the One-Per-Address Statute violates the \nEighth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause on its face and as applied to \nthem and an injunction prohibiting Defendant from continuing to enforce the \nStatute.   \n89.  The proposed class is numerous. According to the final report of the Illinois \nSex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration Task Force, published in December 2017, \n“[o]n average, the Illinois Department of Corrections houses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders \nwho may not be released from custody because they are unable to secure \npermanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute requirements or agency policy.”6 \nOn information and belief, the number of individuals imprisoned in IDOC due to a \nlack of compliant housing has grown substantially since the publication of that \nreport. This complaint identifies 37 people who have been unable to secure housing \nsolely because of the challenged Statute and there are likely hundreds more who \nare, or will be in the future, in the same situation.  \n                                                        \n6   Available at: http://www.icjia.state.il.us/news/sex-offenses-and-sex-offender-\nregistration-task-force-final-report \n  21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 22 of 25 PageID #:203\n90.  There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, including \nbut not limited to the following: \n•  What are the rationales for the One-Per-Address Statute;  \n \n•  Whether there is any compelling interest served by the Statute; \n \n•  Whether the Statute violates the Eighth Amendment and Equal \nProtection Clause as applied to the members of the class.   \n \n91.    All individuals falling within the class definition are subject to the same \nStatute. Given the commonality of the questions pertinent to all class members, a \nsingle judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. \n92.  Defendant has acted and continues to act in a manner adverse to the rights \nof the proposed class, making final declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \n93.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe class; and the named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of all members \nof the proposed class. \n94.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has extensive experience and has devoted substantial \nprofessional and financial resources to representing individuals in cases involving \nthe same type of claim raised here—namely, the Murphy class action. Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \n   \n  22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 23 of 25 PageID #:204\nCOUNT I   \n42 U.S.C. §1983 – EIGHTH AMENDMENT \n \n95.  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the class they seek to represent, \nreallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, each and every \nallegation contained above.  \n96.  In Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019), this Court \nhas already concluded that it violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth \nAmendment to subject individuals to indefinite incarceration solely because they \ncannot meet the host-site requirement, holding as follows:  \nAt the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is \nfreedom from indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The Attorney \nGeneral and Director’s current application of the host site requirement \nresults in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs’ fundamental rights and \ntherefore contravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nConstitution of the United States.  \n \n97.   The One-Per-Address Statute is the sole reason the named Plaintiffs and \nthe members of the proposed class cannot secure housing that will enable them to \nbe released on MSR (or remain in the community while on MSR). \n98.   Thus, the One-Per-Address Statute violates the Eighth Amendment on its \nface and as applied to the named Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class.  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)  Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(2); \n \nb)  Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g); \n \nc)  Enter judgment declaring that 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) violates the Eighth \nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution; \n \n  23 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-1 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 24 of 25 PageID #:205\nd)  Enter a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendant from continuing to \nenforce 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6); \n \ne)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and cost pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988, and other applicable law; and \n \nf)   Grant such other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n \n COUNT II   \n42 U.S.C. §1983 – FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT – EQUAL PROTECTION \n \n99.   Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the class they seek to represent, \nreallege and reincorporate, as though fully set forth herein, each and every \nallegation contained above.  \n100.  The One-Per-Address Statute violates the Equal Protection Clause on its \nface and as applied to the named Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class.  \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \na)  Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(2); \n \nb)  Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

P. 23(G)(1) \n \n  Plaintiffs, through counsel, respectfully request that this Court enter an order \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) certifying this case as a class \naction on behalf of a class defined as follows: \n•  All individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and completed their \ncourt-imposed sentence of incarceration who cannot find housing that \ncomplies with 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) at which to reside while on Mandatory \nSupervised Release.  \n \n  Plaintiffs further request that this Court enter an order appointing the \nundersigned attorneys as class counsel. In support thereof, Plaintiffs state as \nfollows. \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter \n“the One-Per-Address Statute” or “the Statute”). The Statute prohibits any \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 2 of 13 PageID #:208\nindividual on Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) for a sex offense from residing \n“at the same address or in the same condominium unit or apartment unit or in the \nsame condominium complex or apartment complex with another person he or she \nknows or reasonably should know is a convicted sex offender or has been placed on \nsupervision for a sex offense.” Id. \n  The named Plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent have \nall completed their court-ordered terms of incarceration and are entitled to release \non MSR. As of this filing, 25 of the named Plaintiffs remain imprisoned because \nthey do not have an approved “host site” at which to reside while on MSR.  \nEleven of the named Plaintiffs have been released from prison to host sites in the \ncommunity, but they are at risk of having their MSR revoked and being sent back to \nIDOC because their housing does not comply with the One-Per-Address Statute.  \n  Plaintiffs claim the enforcement of the Statute against them and others \nsimilarly situated violates the Eighth Amendment and Equal Protection Clause. \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of the class against Rob \nJeffreys in his official capacity as Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections. \nMr. Jeffreys is the public official with ultimate authority for enforcement of the \nOne-Per-Address Statute. \n  Plaintiffs’ claims are ideally suited to proceed as a class action under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). As set forth below, the proposed class satisfies each \nelement of Rule 23(a) because (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n\t 2\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 3 of 13 PageID #:209\n(3) the claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class; and (4) \nthe named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Moreover, this matter meets the requirements for class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendant has acted in a manner that \napplies generally to the class as a whole, rendering class-wide injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Court Should Certify the Proposed Class   \n \n  For a district court to certify a class action, the proposed class must satisfy the \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a) and \nthe requirements of at least one subsection of Rule 23(b). Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 \nF.2d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 1992). Here, because the proposed class meets all four \nRule 23(a) requirements and the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), the class should be \ncertified. \nA.  The Proposed Class Meets All of the Requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a) and 23(b)(2) \n \n1.  Numerosity \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1) requires that the class be “so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  A class \n“including more than 40 members” generally meets this standard. Barragan v. \nEvanger’s Dog and Cat Food Co., 259 F.R.D. 330, 333 (N.D.Ill. 2009); Streeter v. \nSheriff of Cook County, 256 F.R.D. 609, 612 (N.D. Ill. 2012) (same); accord William \nB. Rubenstein, et al., Newberg on Class Actions, § 3:12 (5th ed. 2011) (“a class of 40 \n\t 3\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 4 of 13 PageID #:210\nor more members raises a presumption of impracticability of joinder based on \nnumbers alone.”)  \n  Here, the proposed class easily satisfies this standard. According to the final \nreport of the Illinois Sex Offenses & Sex Offender Registration Task Force, \npublished in December 2017, “[o]n average, the Illinois Department of Corrections \nhouses 1,200 to 1,400 offenders who may not be released from custody because they \nare unable to secure permanent, stable housing meeting Illinois statute \nrequirements or agency policy.”1 Many such individuals remain incarcerated solely \nbecause of the One-Per-Address provision. Plaintiffs’ pleadings to date have \nidentified 36 individuals who have otherwise compliant addresses that have not \nbeen approved because of the One-Per-Address Statute. \n  As explained in Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, these individuals fall \ninto four broad categories: (1) individuals, such as Marcus Barnes, Dana Monson, \nand Columbo Galindo, who would like to reside at charitably operated transitional \nhousing such as Jordan’s Dream, New Beginnings or Wayside Cross Ministries; (2) \nindividuals, such as Alvin Goldberg, who could obtain privately financed housing at \naddresses where other individuals with sex offense convictions already reside;  \n(3) individuals, such as Andra Sampson and John Margarella, who are eligible for \nplacement at the units IDOC leases from NewDay Apartments; and (4) individuals, \nsuch as Luis Aponte and Thomas Smith, who could reside with members of their \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1   Available at: http://www.icjia.state.il.us/news/sex-offenses-and-sex-offender-\nregistration-task-force-final-report \n \n\t 4\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 5 of 13 PageID #:211\nfamilies but for the One-Per-Address restriction. Each of these categories likely \ncontains dozens of other people who could identify housing but for the restriction on \nresiding at the same address as another offender. \n  Moreover, as noted in Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. \n17), membership in the class is growing as additional individuals finish their \nsentences of incarceration and become eligible for release on MSR but remain \nimprisoned due to an inability to obtain compliant housing. Accordingly, the class \neasily meets the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1). \n2.  Commonality \n \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Where, as here, the named Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class they seek to represent bring a facial challenge to an allegedly \nunconstitutional statute, the central questions of law and fact are necessarily \ncommon to all members of the class. See Smiley v. Calumet City, No. 08 C 3017, \n2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41701, at *15-16 (N.D. Ill. May 15, 2009) (Where the \nPlaintiff brings “a facial challenge to the validity of [a statute] … the statute itself \nserves as the required ‘common nucleus of operative fact.’”) (citing Keele v. Wexler, \n149 F. 3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) and Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th \nCir. 1992)).  \n  Here, the named Plaintiffs and all members of the proposed class are \nchallenging the constitutionality of the same statute. Accordingly, all of the core \n\t 5\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:212\nfactual and legal questions are appropriate for resolution on a class-wide basis. \nThese common questions include the following: \n•  What are the rationales for the One-Per-Address Statute;  \n \n•  Whether there is any compelling interest served by the Statute; \n \n•  What evidence supports the restriction imposed by the Statute; \n \n•  Whether the Statute violates the Eighth Amendment and/or Equal \nProtection Clause as applied to the members of the class.   \n \n  Because there are common questions of law and fact pertaining to all members \nof the class, this matter meets the commonality requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(2). \n3.  Typicality \n \n  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The \nstandard for determining typicality is not an identity of interest between the named \nplaintiffs and the class, but rather a “sufficient homogeneity of interest.” Jones v. \nBlinziner, 536 F. Supp. 1181, 1190 (N.D. Ind. 1982) (citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. \n393, 403 n.13 (1975)). “[T]he typicality requirement is liberally construed.” Gaspar \nv. Linvatec Corp., 167 F.R.D. 51, 57 (N.D. Ill. 1996). A “plaintiff’s claim is typical if \nit arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the \nclaims of other class members and [is] based on the same legal theory.” De La \nFuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983). This \nrequirement “is meant to assume that the named representative’s claims ‘have the \n\t 6\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:213\nsame essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.’” Oshana v. Coca–\nCola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 514 (7th Cir. 2006). \n  Where, as here, the named Plaintiffs’ injuries arise from a generally applicable \nstatute affecting all members of the class, typicality exists even if there are factual \ndifferences in precisely how the statute was applied to each plaintiff. Sherman v. \nTwp. High Sch. Dist. 214, 540 F. Supp. 2d 985, 992 (N.D. Ill. 2008) (“variations in \nfactual circumstances … do not defeat the typicality of the class representative’s \ndefenses.”) (citing Brown v. Kelly, 244 F.R.D. 222, 230 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“if factual \ndistinctions could preclude findings of commonality and typicality under Rule 23(a), \nthey would be the death knell for class actions challenging the systemic \nenforcement of an unconstitutional statute.”); Areola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 798 \n(7th Cir. 2008) (typicality satisfied where plaintiff was in the “same boat” as other \nCook County Jail detainees who had been denied crutches). \n  In this case, the named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the class as a whole. Each \nnamed Plaintiff has a place to live that would meet IDOC approval but for the One-\nPer-Address Statute. The members of the proposed class are in the same situation—\nthat is, they will be imprisoned beyond the completion of their court-ordered term of \nincarceration unless and until they find housing that satisfies this rule. Moreover, \nthe named Plaintiffs and each class member have the same legal theories—that is, \nthe application of the challenged Statute keeps them in prison in violation of the \nEighth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. Accordingly, the named \nPlaintiffs satisfy Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement. See Fonder v. Sheriff of \n\t 7\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 8 of 13 PageID #:214\nKankakee County, No. 12-CV-2115, 2013 WL 5644754, at *6 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 15, 2013) \n(typicality satisfied where “Plaintiff is challenging the same strip search policy as \nthe class he seeks to represent”); Olson v. Brown, 284 F.R.D. 398, 411 (N.D. Ind. \n2012) (typicality satisfied where class representative and members of proposed class \nhad their legal mail opened improperly by correctional officers). \n4.  Adequacy \n \n  Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiffs “will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The adequacy inquiry \nconsists of two parts: “(1) the adequacy of the named plaintiffs as representatives of \nthe proposed class’ myriad members, with their differing and separate interests, \nand (2) the adequacy of the proposed class counsel.” Gomez v. St. Vincent Health, \nInc., 649 F.3d 583, 592 (7th Cir. 2011). Both elements are met here.  \na.  The Named Plaintiffs Are Appropriate Representatives of the \nInterests of the Class  \n \n  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nThe named Plaintiffs and the class members raise the same claims, seek the same \nrelief, and their interests are aligned. The named Plaintiffs are a diverse group who \nrepresent the various ways in which the One-Per-Address Statute results in the \nunnecessary imprisonment of individuals who have completed their sentences of \nincarceration and who should be permitted to serve their MSR time in the \ncommunity. Each of the named Plaintiffs has a strong personal stake in the \nproceedings that will “insure diligent and thorough prosecution of the litigation.” \nRodriguez v. Swank, 318 F. Supp. 289, 294 (N.D. Ill.1970), aff'd 403 U.S. 901 (1971). \n\t 8\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 9 of 13 PageID #:215\nAt present, there are 25 named Plaintiffs who remain in prison because of the One-\nPer-Address Statute and 11 named Plaintiffs who are at risk of revocation because \nof the Statute.2 Even if every named Plaintiff is released pursuant to preliminary \ninjunctive relief, they will remain invested in seeing this litigation through to its \nconclusion because in the absence of permanent injunctive relief, they risk being \nreturned to prison on a technical violation of their parole (i.e., their housing will no \nlonger be valid because of the One-Per-Address Statute). Accordingly, the named \nPlaintiffs will adequately represent the interests of the class.  \nb.  Adequacy of Representation \n  The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced civil rights counsel who are \nwell qualified to represent the interests of the members of the class and have \ndevoted substantial time and resources to vigorously prosecuting this case. Ms. \nNicholas and Mr. Weinberg have successfully litigated numerous constitutional \ncases in which broad equitable relief was sought, including the Murphy class action \nwhich raised claims closely related to the claims raised here. See, Murphy v. Raoul, \n16 C 11471, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill., 2019) (Kendall, J.) (certified class action; \nobtained permanent injunction governing IDOC procedures for releasing sex \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2   The 25 Plaintiffs who remain imprisoned are Columbo Galindo, Andra Sampson, \nDeJuan Wright, Jerrand Miller, John Margarella, Kenneth Green, David Easton, Paul D. \nHubbard, Juan Medina, Adam Escamilla, Aishef Shaffer, Edward Bartgen, Reginald \nHarris, Johnny Harris, Lavonne Givens, Lashaun Dean, Justin Fluckert, Dontae Boykin, \nRonald Garrison, Joshua Huddleston, Manuel Aleman, Arnold Lloyd, Melvin Kelley, Andre \nDunn, and Alvin Goldberg. The 11 Plaintiffs who have been released but are at risk of \nrevocation are Marcus Barnes, Luis Aponte, Kevin Manson, Fredrick Chamblis, Corey \nCrowe, Dana Monson, Joshua Atkins, Kenneth Schroeder, Wade Council, Christopher \nShelton and Mark Faller. \n\t 9\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 10 of 13 PageID #:216\noffenders on MSR); RCP Publications Inc. v. City of Chicago, 15 C 11398 (certified \nclass action; obtained permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of City’s sign-\nposting ordinance and class-wide damages); Adair v. Town of Cicero, No. 18 C 3526, \n2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110949 (N.D. Ill. July 3, 2019) (pending certified class action \non behalf of women detained in Town of Cicero police lockup); Koger v. Dart, 114 F. \nSupp. 3d 572 (N.D. Ill., 2015) (obtained declaratory judgment holding ban on \nnewspapers in the Cook County Jail unconstitutional); Pindak v. Dart, 10 C 6237 \n(N.D. Ill. 2016) (Pallmeyer, J.) (obtained a permanent injunction ordering the \nsheriff to train deputies concerning First Amendment rights); Norton v. City of \nSpringfield, 806 F. 3d 411 (7th Cir. 2015) (obtained an injunction barring the City of \nSpringfield from enforcing its municipal panhandling ordinance).  \n  Because the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated a commitment to vigorously \npursuing class-wide relief and because they are represented by competent and \nexperienced counsel, they satisfy Rule 23(a)(4)’s adequacy requirements. \n5.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) Because this Case \nSeeks Declaratory and Injunctive Relief from Policies that \nImpact the Entire Proposed Class \n \n  The final requirement for class certification is that the named plaintiff must \nmeet the requirements of at least one of the subsections of Rule 23(b). Subsection \n(b)(2) requires that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Courts have long recognized that civil rights class \n\t 10\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 11 of 13 PageID #:217\nactions are the paradigmatic 23(b)(2) suits. See Alliance to End Repression v. \nRochford, 565 F. 2d 975, 979 n.9 (7th Cir. 1977) (“Rule 23(b)(2) … is devoted \nprimarily to civil rights class actions which allege violations of constitutional \nrights.”) (citing Advisory Committee Notes to the 1966 Amendments to Rule 23);  \nChi. Teachers Union, Local No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. of Chi., 797 F.3d 426, 441 (7th Cir. \n2015) (“23(b)(2) is the appropriate rule to enlist when the plaintiffs’ primary goal is \nnot monetary relief, but rather to require the defendant to do or not do something \nthat would benefit the whole class. Not surprisingly, civil rights cases … are prime \nexamples of Rule 23(b)(2) classes.”) (citations omitted). \n  As stated in the leading treatise on class actions: \nRule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights \nsuits. Most class actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas \nseek primarily declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class \nand therefore readily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) class action criteria. \n \nA. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 25.20 (4th ed. 2002). Because \nthis case seeks class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief, it is appropriate for \ncertification as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nII.   The Court Should Designate Plaintiffs’ Counsel as Class Counsel \nUnder Rule 23(g)(1) \n \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) requires that the district court appoint \nclass counsel for any class that is certified. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). The attorneys \nappointed to serve as class counsel must “fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B). The appointed class counsel must \nbe listed in a court’s class certification order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(B). \n\t 11\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 12 of 13 PageID #:218\n  Rule 23(g) provides four factors for a court to consider in appointing class \ncounsel: (1) “the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential \nclaims in the action;” (2) “counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other \ncomplex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action;” (3) “counsel’s \nknowledge of the applicable law”; and (4) “the resources that counsel will commit to \nrepresenting the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  \n  The undersigned attorneys satisfy each of these requirements. First, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel have invested substantial work into preparation of this case, including \nspeaking to numerous families and individuals affected by the challenged Statute, \ndrafting a Complaint and two amended Complaints, drafting two successful motions \nfor a preliminary injunctive relief, and conducting extensive legal research \nconcerning the class members’ claims. Second, as set forth in §I(A)(4)(c) above, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel have devoted substantial professional resources to litigation on \nbehalf of individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses and have significant \nexperience in handling complex civil rights litigation, including the kind of claims \nasserted in this case. Finally, Plaintiffs’ counsel have dedicated and will continue to \ncommit substantial resources to the representation of this class. In sum, Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel fully satisfy the criteria for class counsel set forth in Rule 23(g), and \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court appoint undersigned counsel to \nrepresent the class. \n   \n\t 12\t\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 24-2 Filed: 05/26/20 Page 13 of 13 PageID #:219\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant \nthe motion for class certification and appoint the undersigned attorneys as Class \nCounsel. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Adele D.

They remain in prison because they cannot \nfind an approved “host site” at which to live while on MSR.  \n  In Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019), this Court has \nalready concluded that it is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and the \nEighth Amendment to subject individuals to indefinite incarceration solely because \nthey cannot meet the host-site requirement, holding as follows:  \nAt the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is freedom \nfrom indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The Attorney General and \nDirector’s  current  application  of  the  host  site  requirement  results  in  the \ncontinued  deprivation  of  the  plaintiffs’  fundamental  rights  and  therefore \ncontravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \nthe United States. \n \n  That decision was entered more than a year ago on March 31, 2019. Today, 297 \nmembers of the Murphy class still remain imprisoned in violation of their \nconstitutional rights. Presently, the world is in the grip of an unprecedented public \nhealth emergency that poses a particular danger to incarcerated individuals. On \nSunday, April 5, 2020, IDOC confirmed that a staff member at Graham \nCorrectional Center (where Plaintiff is imprisoned) has been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19, putting the entire population of individuals imprisoned at Graham in \nimminent danger of infection. Every day that the members of the class remain \nincarcerated poses a grave risk to their health and safety.  \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 3 of 20 PageID #:22\n  Plaintiff Marcus Barnes has a safe place to live outside of prison (5726 S. \nSangamon, Chicago, Illinois) that satisfies almost every one of the onerous \nrequirements for where individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses are \npermitted to reside—i.e., it is not within 500 feet of a school, playground, daycare, \nor any other location where children congregate. Yet, the IDOC will not permit him \nto be released to the aforementioned address because another registrant resides at \nthe same address, and a section of the Illinois Uniform Code of Corrections prohibits \nindividuals on MSR for sex offenses from living “at the same address or in the same \ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium complex or \napartment complex with another person he or she knows or reasonably should know \nis a convicted sex offender or has been placed on supervision for a sex offense.” 730 \nILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) (hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute”). \n  Plaintiff now asks this court to enjoin enforcement of the One-Per-Address \nStatute because, for the reasons set forth below, its application to Plaintiff Barnes \nand others similarly situated to him violates the Eighth Amendment.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  Plaintiff Marcus Barnes \n  Plaintiff Marcus Barnes is 42 years old. He was convicted in 2008 of criminal \nsexual assault and sentenced to serve 12 years in IDOC plus an indeterminate term \nof “three years to life” on MSR. With good time credits, Barnes completed his prison \nsentence on December 17, 2018, and was approved for release on MSR by the \nPrisoner Review Board. \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 4 of 20 PageID #:23\n  Barnes has a caring family that has worked tirelessly for the past 18 months to \nfind him a place to live while on MSR. Ex. 1, Decl. of Delshay McDaniel at ¶1. \nBarnes has submitted 11 different potential host sites. Id. at ¶¶2, 3. Some of the \nsites were with family members; others were private residences where Barnes \nwould have lived alone. Id. at ¶3. IDOC has rejected every one of these proposed \nhost sites. Id. at ¶4. The IDOC has given Barnes various reasons for rejection of the \nsites, including the proposed site is too close to a daycare; in a “motel”; and within \n500 feet of an “after school program.” Id. \n  In February 2020, Barnes’ family found him a place to stay at 5726 S. Sangamon \nin Chicago. Id. at ¶¶5, 6. The building is owned and operated by an organization \ncalled Jordan’s Dream, which provides transitional housing and supportive services \n(such as help with locating employment and connections to mental health providers) \nto individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses. Id. The building is a typical \ntwo-flat with two apartments, one on the second floor and one on the first floor. Id. \n  IDOC investigated the address and confirmed that it complies with the statutory \nrestrictions on proximity within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds, daycares and \nother places where children congregate. The sole reason the address was rejected is \nthat another registrant also lives at the address. Id. Because this address has been \nrejected, Barnes remains imprisoned in IDOC. At the time of filing, Jordan’s Dream \nstill has an opening for Barnes at the Sangamon address and would still like to \nhave Barnes live there. Id. at ¶7. \n  Barnes’ father died on March 31, 2020. Id. at ¶8. Barnes remains in prison and \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 5 of 20 PageID #:24\nis unable to mourn the loss of his father with the rest of his family, although he has \nalready served his time and should have been released 16 months ago. Barnes has \nalso learned that a guard at Graham Correctional Center has been diagnosed with \nCOVID-19 and fears for his safety remaining imprisoned there. Id. at ¶9.   \nII. The Murphy Litigation \n  The plaintiffs in Murphy challenged the constitutionality of the “host site” \nrequirement as it was being applied to individuals who have been sentenced to an \nindeterminate term of “three years to life” on MSR. Such individuals face the \npossibility of being imprisoned for life if they are unable to find and/or pay for \nhousing that meets the requirements imposed by Illinois law and IDOC policy \nbecause their MSR time never begins to run until they are released from prison to \nan approved host site. See 730 ILCS 5/3-14-2.5(e).  \n  The Murphy plaintiffs identified several layers of restrictions that limit where \npeople sentenced to indeterminate MSR can live, which together make it impossible \nfor the members of the class to find host sites. Among the restrictions are the \nfollowing: \n•   Sections of the Illinois Criminal Code which make it a crime for any \nindividual classified as a “child sex offender” to live within 500 feet of a \nschool, playground, or daycare (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5), (b-10));  \n \n•   Sections of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections which prohibit persons \nrequired to register as sex offenders from living “near” “parks, schools, day \ncare centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places \nwhere minor children congregate without advance approval of an agent of \nthe Department of Corrections” (730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12)); \n \n•   The One-Per-Address Statute, which requires individuals on MSR for sex \noffenses to “refrain from residing at the same address or in the same \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 6 of 20 PageID #:25\ncondominium unit or apartment unit or in the same condominium \ncomplex or apartment complex with another person he or she knows or \nreasonably should know is a convicted sex offender” (unless residing at a \n“licensed transitional housing facility for sex offenders,” a facility \n“operated or licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services \nor by the Department of Human Services,” or a “licensed medical facility”) \n(730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6));  \n \n•   Housing restrictions imposed as a matter of IDOC policy including \nprohibitions on living in a host site where children visit or reside \n(including the parolee’s own children), where there are computers or wi-fi \naccess, and/or where there is no land-line telephone;  \n \n•   The unavailability of half-way houses, transitional housing, homeless \nshelters or other free or low-cost housing for indigent parolees; and \n \n•   The IDOC’s interpretation of the One-Per-Address Statute as prohibiting \na sex offender parolee from living in a building adjacent to a building \nwhere another registrant lives and/or from living in the same trailer park \nas another registrant. \n \n  Murphy was certified as a class action on behalf of “all individuals sentenced to \nserve three-years-to-life on MSR currently detained in the IDOC who have been \napproved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been denied release from IDOC \ncustody because of their inability to obtain an approved host site.” Murphy v. Raoul, \n16-cv-11471, ECF No. 63. Plaintiff Marcus Barnes is a member of the Murphy class.  \n  On March 31, 2019, this Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgement on their claim that the state’s statutory and regulatory scheme violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause and the Eighth Amendment. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-\n11471, ECF No. 132; Murphy v. Raoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731 (N.D. Ill. 2019). The \nCourt’s summary judgment decision did not single out a particular Illinois law or \nIDOC policy that violated the constitution. Rather, the Court held that the state’s \n“statutory and regulatory scheme” as a whole (i.e., the overlapping restrictions \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 7 of 20 PageID #:26\nimposed by Illinois law, the IDOC’s interpretation of the law, and the IDOC’s \npolicies) violates the Murphy class’s constitutional rights.  \n  On January 15, 2020, the Court entered a permanent injunction requiring the \nIllinois Department of Corrections to put forth a plan “setting forth the specific \nsteps [the Defendants] will take to ensure that by no later than January 2, 2021, no \nmember of the class will remain imprisoned due to an inability to comply with the \nhost site requirement.” Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. The IDOC filed \nits compliance plan on February 27, 2020. 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 161. The \npermanent injunction also calls for the IDOC to provide the court with periodic \nstatus reports concerning its implementation of the compliance plan and progress \ntowards the January 2, 2021 compliance deadline. 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. \n  At the time of this filing, it is counsel’s understanding that the IDOC has \nsucceeded in releasing only three members of the Murphy class from IDOC. Each of \nthose individuals were detained in IDOC for more than eight years beyond the \ncompletion of his prison sentence. Presently, the Murphy class comprises at least \n297 individuals who remain in prison beyond the completion of their court-ordered \nsentence of imprisonment due to an inability to meet the host site requirement, \nsome for as long as eight years past their MSR date.  \n  The IDOC’s compliance plan for meeting the January 2, 2021 deadline includes \nseveral worthwhile proposals, including changes to IDOC interpretation of statutory \nrestrictions (e.g., not applying the One-Per-Address Statute to trailer parks and \nadjacent buildings); changes to IDOC policy (e.g., allowing individuals to reside at \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 8 of 20 PageID #:27\naddresses with Wi-Fi, relaxation of the land-line requirement); and contracting with \nprivate vendors to provide transitional housing. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF \nNo. 161. The plan also notes that “[t]here are many statutory provisions that \nimpede the Department’s ability to approve prospective host sites for sex offenders” \nstates that the Department and “hopes that some of the statutory impediments to \nidentifying host sites can be reduced or eliminated through legislative change.”  Id. \nat 3-4. \nIII.  Health Risks of Detention in IDOC Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n  We are in the midst of a world-wide health crisis caused by the rapid spread of \ncoronavirus and COVID-19. The number of known COVID-19 infections is rising at \nan alarming rate. As of April 5, 2020, there have been more than 1.2 million \ninfections globally1; and Illinois alone has nearly 9,000 known cases.2 Nearly 67,000 \npeople have died.3   \n  The risks to the health of individuals detained in close proximity to one another \nin prisons—as well as the staff, attorneys, medical professionals, and clergy who \nvisit and work in these prisons—cannot be overstated. COVID-19 is highly \n                                                        \n1  See Johns Hopkins University, Coronavirus Resource Center,  \nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html (last visited April 4, 2020). \n \n2    “Coronavirus in Illinois Updates,” Chicago Tribune, April 3, 2020 (available at: \nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-pandemic-chicago-illinois-news-\n20200403-dr4twatabrcx5ccwzcws4uwngu-story.html) \n \n3   See note 1, supra. \n \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 9 of 20 PageID #:28\ncontagious between people who are in close contact with one another.4 The virus is \ntransmissible through coughing, sneezing, and contact with surfaces.5 Experts \nadvise that “talking” and “normal breathing” also likely transmit the disease.6 The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) urges social distancing—i.e., \nevery person should remain at least six feet away from every other person—to avoid \ntransmission of the disease.7 Social distancing is of paramount importance because \neven entirely asymptomatic persons can be infected with COVID-19 and \nunknowingly transmit it to others.8 Proper sanitation measures, including frequent \nhand washing and frequent cleaning of surfaces with approved disinfectants are \nalso recommended.9 Governor Pritzker has issued a state-wide “stay at home” order \nto slow the disease’s spread.10  \n                                                        \n4   “How COVID-19 Spreads,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html)  \n \n5   Id. \n \n6    “Experts tell White House coronavirus can spread through talking or even just \nbreathing, CNN, April 2, 2020 (available at: \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/health/aerosol-coronavirus-spread-white-house-\nletter/index.html)  \n \n7    “Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission,” Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Mar. 12, 2020 (available at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf) \n \n8   See n. 4, supra. \n \n9    “How to Protect Yourself,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available at: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html)  \n \n10    “Read the Governor’s Full Order Requiring Illinois Residents to Stay at Home,” NBC 5 \nChicago, March 20, 2020 (available at: https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/read-the-\ngovernors-full-order-requiring-illinois-residents-to-stay-at-home/2241196/) \n \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 10 of 20 PageID #:29\n  None of the recommended measures for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 are \npossible for persons confined in prisons and those who must interact with them. \nMany IDOC facilities are overcrowded. For example, Graham Correctional Center, \nwhere Plaintiff Barnes is imprisoned, is currently 20 percent above its maximum \noperating capacity. According to the IDOC’s website, Graham has an operational \ncapacity of 1,596 prisoners and currently houses 1,919 prisoners.11 Prisoners at \nGraham are housed two men to a cell; 20 men to a wing. All of these individuals are \nin close proximity to one another day-in and day-out. It is not possible for them to \npractice “social distancing” from one another. On Sunday, April 5, 2020, IDOC \nconfirmed that a staff member at Graham Correctional Center was diagnosed with \nCOVID-19, thus greatly increasing the likelihood that prisoners at Graham already \nare, or soon will be, infected.12  \n  When a prisoner or staff member at a detention facility is infected with COVID-\n19, the disease spreads rapidly. For example, at the Cook County Jail, 210 \ndetainees and 34 staff have been diagnosed with COVID-19, despite the jail’s \nhaving taken the drastic step of releasing approximately 10 percent of its \npopulation to alleviate crowding. The disease spread exponentially among detainees \n                                                        \n11   Graham Correctional Center Facility Data, Illinois Department of Corrections \n(available at:  https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/grahamcorrectionalcenter.aspx) \n(last visited April 3, 2020). \n \n12   COVID-19 Response, Illinois Department of Corrections (available at: \nhttps://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx) (last visited April 5, \n2020) \n \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 11 of 20 PageID #:30\nat the jail, from two infections on March 23 to 210 just nine days later.13 With \nCOVID-19 cases on the rise throughout the state, it is inevitable that IDOC \nfacilities will become loci for the spread of the disease.  \nIV.   The Challenged Statute \n  The One-Per-Address Statute is set forth in the Illinois Uniform Code of \nCorrections at 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6). The sole mechanism through which the \nOne-Per-Address Statue is enforced is through the IDOC’s approval or rejection of \nparolees’ proposed host sites. That is, it is not a criminal offense for an individual on \nMSR for a sex offense to live at the same address as another registrant.14 \n  The One-Per-Address Statute went into effect on July 11, 2005. Prior to that \ndate, individuals on MSR for sex offenses were permitted to live in the same \nresidence as other registrants. On information and belief, the One-Per-Address \nStatute is a major cause, if not the single largest cause, of the continued \nimprisonment of members of the Murphy class. This is so because other statutes \n(e.g., the 500-foot rules) already strictly circumscribe the areas where individuals \nconvicted of sex offenses may live. Pursuant to the One-Per-Address Statute, if a \nbuilding complies with the other restrictions, only one parolee may live there, even \nif it is a multi-unit building or a large apartment complex with dozens of units.  \n                                                        \n13    “Cook County Jail Now Reports 210 Inmates Have Tested Positive for COVID-19,” \nNBC5 Chicago, April 4, 2020 (https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/coronavirus/cook-county-\njail-now-reports-210-inmates-have-tested-positive-for-covid-19/2250366/). \n \n14   In contrast, the statutes prohibiting individuals classified as “child sex offenders” from \nliving within 500 feet of schools, daycares and playgrounds (720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 (b-5) and (b-\n10)) are part of the criminal code. It is a Class 4 felony for a “child sex offender” to \n“knowingly” live at a prohibited location. 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3(f).   \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 12 of 20 PageID #:31\n  There is no reason to conclude that people who have been convicted of sex \noffenses’ living near one another contributes to criminality. At least one analysis \nfound that it has the opposite effect: it reduces the incidence of re-offense and \nimproves supervision. A Minnesota Department of Corrections report concluded as \nfollows:  \nThis examination of level three re-offenders does not reveal a negative \neffect related to a level three offender living with another sex offender. In \nfact, supervision agents in both Hennepin and Ramsey County have noted \nbenefits from having more than one level three offender living in one \nlocation. Closer supervision is possible because travel time between \noffenders is reduced. Also, level three offenders who live with other level \nthree offenders experience more visits from a supervising agent because \nagents for both offenders visit the same property. Finally, offenders tend \nto inform on each other when supervision restrictions are violated or \ncrimes are committed.15  \n \n  There is no logical reason to believe that there is a compelling public safety need \nto prohibit people on MSR for sex offenses from living at the same address as one \nanother. In the Murphy litigation, the IDOC did not come forth with any safety or \nrehabilitative justification for the One-Per-Address Statute. In acknowledgement of \nthe restriction’s excessiveness, IDOC has already reinterpreted the restriction so as \nnot to apply to trailer parks or adjacent apartment buildings. Murphy v. Raoul, 16-\ncv-11471, ECF No. 161. \n   \n                                                        \n15   See “Level Three Sex Offender Residential Placement Issues,” Minnesota Department of \nCorrections (available at: \nhttps://mn.gov/doc/assets/Lvl%203%20SEX%20OFFENDERS%20report%202003%20(revise\nd%202-04)_tcm1089-272828.pdf) (last visited April 3, 2020) \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 13 of 20 PageID #:32\nARGUMENT \nI. Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction Standards \n  To be entitled to a temporary restraining order a plaintiff must demonstrate that \nhe has “(1) some likelihood of succeeding on the merits and (2) that he has ‘no \nadequate remedy at law’ and will suffer irreparable harm” if relief is denied. Abbott \nLaboratories v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, 11 (7th Cir. 1992) (internal \ncitations omitted). If these two elements are established, a court should consider \n“(3) the irreparable harm the non-moving party will suffer if preliminary relief is \ngranted, balancing that harm against the irreparable harm to the moving party if \nrelief is denied; and (4) the public interest, meaning the consequences of granting or \ndenying the injunction to non-parties.” Id. In deciding this motion, the court “[is] \nsitting as would a chancellor in equity,” and should weigh all four factors “seeking \nat all times to minimize the costs of being mistaken.” Id.  \n  Similarly, in order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must establish \nfour elements: (1) some likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the lack of an \nadequate remedy at law; (3) a likelihood that they will suffer irreparable harm if \nthe injunction is not granted; and (4) the balance of hardships tips in the moving \nparty’s favor. Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001). \n  As shown below, Plaintiff meets each element for establishing an entitlement to \ninjunctive relief, and accordingly this Court should issue a temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the One-Per-Address \nStatute.  \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 14 of 20 PageID #:33\nII. Plaintiff Has a Likelihood of Success on his Claim that Continued \nEnforcement of the One-Per-Address Statute During the COVID-19 \nPandemic Violates The Eighth Amendment   \n \n  The Eighth Amendment mandates that persons confined in prisons must “be \nfurnished with the basic human needs, one of which is ‘reasonable safety.’” Helling \nv. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 (1993) (citing DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. \nof Soc. Serv., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989)). In Helling, the Supreme Court held that a \nprisoner stated an Eighth Amendment claim that he was exposed to unsafe levels of \nenvironmental tobacco smoke even though he personally experienced no adverse \nhealth effects because the health risk posed by involuntary exposure to second-hand \nsmoke is “sufficiently imminent.” Id. at 509 U.S. at 35.  \n  Courts have consistently interpreted Helling to authorize an Eighth Amendment \ncause of action when an inmate is exposed to a risk of contracting contagious \ndiseases. See Loftin v. Dalessandri, 3 F. App’x 658, 662-63 (10th Cir. 2001) (inmate \nstated an Eighth Amendment violation where he alleged he was housed in a cell \nwith two cellmates who had tuberculosis); DeGidio v. Pung, 920 F.2d 525, 533 (8th \nCir. 1990) (failure by prison officials to prevent the unchecked spread of \ntuberculosis violated the Eighth Amendment). Indeed, in Helling itself, the \nSupreme Court approvingly cited Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974) in \nwhich the court held that inmates were entitled to relief under the Eighth \nAmendment when they proved threats to their personal safety from “the mingling of \ninmates with serious contagious diseases with other prison inmates.” Helling, 506 \nU.S. at 34. \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 15 of 20 PageID #:34\n  The Seventh Circuit has similarly recognized that the Eighth Amendment \nprotects prisoners from known exposure to serious diseases, holding that in such a \ncircumstance, “[t]he prison must be allowed to choose between removing the \nprisoner from the unhealthy environment and protecting him from its consequences \n. . . provided, of course, that the protection is efficacious.” Powers v. Snyder, 484 \nF.3d 929, 931 (7th Cir. 2007); see also McDonald v. Hardy, 821 F.3d 882, 889 (7th \nCir. 2016) (explaining that the Eighth Amendment does not excuse deliberate \nindifference simply because harms “have not yet reached the point of causing acute \nor life-threatening injuries”). \n  To succeed on an Eighth Amendment claim, a plaintiff must show that the \ndefendant has acted with “deliberate indifference.” Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d \n469, 478 (7th Cir. 2005). That standard is met when the plaintiff establishes that he \nhas been exposed to an “objectively serious” risk of harm and defendant acted with \n“conscious disregard of known or obvious dangers” to the plaintiff. Id. (citing \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)). Both components of the deliberate \nindifference standard are met here. \nA. Imprisonment During the COVID-19 Pandemic Exposes Plaintiff \nBarnes and Others Similarly Situated to an Known and Objectively \nSerious Risk of Harm \n \n  As outlined in §III of the factual background above, the spread of COVID-19 \nposes a very serious risk to imprisoned individuals. COVID-19 cases are \nskyrocketing in Illinois, doubling every two days.16 Hospitals will soon be \n                                                        \n16   See https://fox40.com/news/national/chicagos-covid-19-cases-doubling-every-2-days-says-\nmayor/ \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 16 of 20 PageID #:35\noverwhelmed with patients in need of critical care. Id. A case of COVID-19 has \nalready been confirmed at Graham Correctional Center, and additional cases are \nimminent.17 At Stateville Correctional Center, 56 inmates have been diagnosed. Id. \n  Illinois officials have publicly acknowledged the severe risk COVID-19 poses to \nthose detained in IDOC and the impossibility of proper mitigation measures in \ncorrectional facilities. At Governor Pritzker’s April 4, 2020, press briefing,18 Illinois \nDepartment of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike stated as follows: \nWe have seen clusters of cases in … correctional centers…. I want to touch \non the difficulty of preventing the virus from infiltrating these congregate \nsettings and the challenges of stopping that spread. The natural movement \nof people needing to come in and out of those settings, even when they’re \ndecreased to the minimal amount, still … increases the potential for rapid \nspread of the virus to people who live, eat and recreate all in the same space. \nOptions for medical isolation of these COVID-19 patients are limited. … \nIdeally, people who are positive should be isolated individually, and close \ncontacts should be quarantined individually. However, that can’t always be \npossible given the constraints of space.19 \n \n   \n                                                        \n \n17  https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/facilities/Pages/Covid19Response.aspx  \n18   Available at: http://www.dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-\nconditions/diseases-a-z-list/coronavirus/media-publications/daily-press-briefings \n \n19   This is not the only case that seeks to address the pressing need to reduce the \npopulation in IDOC facilities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In Money, et al. v. \nJeffreys, et al., No. 20-cv-2094, filed April 2, 2020, the plaintiffs have asked the court to \nrequire Governor Pritzker to release two classes of individuals from IDOC custody—\nindividuals who have serious underlying medical conditions and people 55 years of age and \nolder who are eligible for medical furlough pursuant to 730 ILCS 5/3-11-1. Expedited \nbriefing has been ordered in that case as follows: Defendants’ brief is due on April 6, 2020 \nby 5 p.m.; Plaintiffs’ reply is due on April 8, 2020 by 5 p.m. See 20-cv-2094, ECF No. 14. \nNotably, the plaintiffs in Money seek release of individuals who still have time left on their \nprison sentences. The Plaintiffs here, in contrast, have completed their sentences and are \nconstitutionally entitled to release on MSR.  \n  16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 17 of 20 PageID #:36\nB. Despite Knowing of the Serious Risk, Defendant Acts With \nDeliberate Indifference towards Plaintiff Barnes and the Members of \nthe Class by Continuing to Enforce the One-Per-Address Rule  \n \n  As explained in §§I and II of the Factual Background above, Marcus Barnes and \nthe other members of the Murphy class have done their time and are entitled to \nrelease. This Court has already found that it is a violation of the constitution to \nkeep individuals who have completed their court ordered terms of incarceration in \nprison simply because they cannot meet the “host-site” requirement. Murphy v. \nRaoul, 380 F. Supp. 3d 731, 738 (N.D. Ill. 2019). The IDOC is under a permanent \ninjunction that requires it to release the members of the Murphy class. Murphy v. \nRaoul, 16-cv-11471, ECF No. 156. In the Murphy litigation, which has been ongoing \nfor four years and generated hundreds of pages of summary judgment briefing, \nIDOC never put forth a public safety or rehabilitative justification for the One-Per-\nAddress Statute.  \n  Under these circumstances, continued enforcement of the One-Per-Address \nStatute constitutes deliberate indifference to Plaintiff’s right to “reasonable safety.” \nPlaintiff Barnes could be living in a safe place outside of prison where he would be \nable to comply with the statewide Stay-at-Home order and observe other \nrecommended disease mitigation measures. The proposed host site on Sangamon \nmeets every requirement imposed by Illinois law, save the One-Per-Address \nStatute. To expose Barnes and others who have completed their sentences and have \nhousing outside of prison to the unmitigated risk of contracting COVID-19 falls \n  17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 18 of 20 PageID #:37\nshort of the Eighth Amendment’s mandates. Accordingly, Plaintiff has a likelihood \nof success on his Eighth Amendment claim. \nIII.  Plaintiff and Others Similarly Situated are Suffering and Will \nContinue to Suffer Irreparable Injury in the Absence of an Injunction  \n \n  If an injunction is not granted, Plaintiff and others similarly situated will suffer \ntwo forms of irreparable injury. One, they will continue to be imprisoned in \nviolation of their constitutional right to be released from prison on MSR. And two, \nthey will continue to be exposed to an unreasonable risk of being infected with \nCOVID-19. Such harms unquestionably constitute irreparable injury. See Adams v. \nCarlson, 488 F.2d 619, 629 (7th Cir. 1973) (“Imprisonment in segregation” is \n“perhaps most paradigmatic” form of “irreparable harm”); Hampton v. Leibach, 99 C \n5473, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20983, at *5-6 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2001) (a plaintiff \n“suffers irreparable harm each day that he is imprisoned in violation of the United \nStates Constitution.”); Harris v. Board of Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. \n2004) (accepting “pain,” “infection,” and “medical complications” as forms of \nirreparable harm warranting injunctive relief). \n  Moreover, it is well established that when a plaintiff establishes a likelihood of \nsuccess on a claim that a government action violates his constitutional rights, he \nmeets the element of showing irreparable harm. Ezell v. City of Chi., 651 F.3d 684, \n699 (7th Cir. 2011) (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is \ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is \nnecessary.”) (quoting 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \n§ 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995)); Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978) \n  18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 19 of 20 PageID #:38\n(“The existence of a continuing constitutional violation constitutes proof of an \nirreparable harm.”).  \nIV.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor Granting Relief \n \n  The public interest also favors the granting of the requested relief. First, other \npersons imprisoned in IDOC who cannot be released at present are also endangered \nby overcrowding, which increases the risk of disease transmission; and the public at \nlarge is put at risk if medical resources are overwhelmed by the hospitalization of \nimprisoned people in downstate communities with few hospital beds. Second, the \npublic has a strong interest in protecting constitutional rights that would be well \nserved by granting injunctive relief here. See ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589-90 \n(7th Cir. 2012) (“[T]he public interest is not harmed by preliminarily enjoining the \nenforcement of a statute that is probably unconstitutional.”)  \n  Plaintiffs anticipate that Defendant will argue that a balance of equities does \nnot favor Plaintiff’s request because it poses an alleged “public safety” risk. But \nPlaintiff is not asking this Court to release any individuals from IDOC custody. \nPlaintiff will still be under IDOC supervision and subject to all the constraints of \nthose on MSR, including GPS monitoring. \nV. Notice \n  Plaintiff has provided the best practicable notice of this motion to Defendant. \nThe complaint and this motion are being served electronically on counsel for the \ndefendants in Murphy on Monday, April 6, 2020. \n \n  19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 20 of 20 PageID #:39\nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this \nHonorable Court enter a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction \ngranting the following relief: \n•  An immediate order prohibiting enforcement of 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(a)(7.6) \n(hereinafter the “One-Per-Address Statute”) as to Plaintiff Marcus Barnes \nso he can be released from prison to a host site at 5726 S. Sangamon, \nChicago, Illinois; and \n \n•  A preliminary injunction prohibiting the IDOC from enforcing the One-\nPer-Address Statute against individuals who have completed their court-\nordered sentences of incarceration and remain in prison due to an \ninability to identify a host site that satisfies the One-Per-Address Rule.  \n \n \n                        Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Adele D.

My name is Delshay McDaniel. Marcus Barnes is my cousin. I speak with Marcus \nregularly and have made extensive efforts over the past year and a half to find housing \nfor him. \n \n2.  Marcus was supposed to be released from prison in December 2018. But he remains in \nprison because we have not been able to find a host site for Marcus to live at that the \nIDOC will approve. \n \n3.  We have submitted 11 different potential host sites as places for Marcus to live, \nincluding my home, my father’s home (Marcus’s uncle), several transitional housing \nfacilities, and several motels.  \n \n4.  Every proposed host site has been rejected. According to paperwork Marcus received \nfrom IDOC in response to a request he submitted (see attached), my home was rejected \nbecause there is a daycare within 500 feet of my house. My father’s home was rejected \nbecause there is a daycare within 500 feet of his home. Other sites were rejected \nbecause they are “motels” or “half-way houses.”  \n \n5.  Several months ago, I began working with Jordan’s Dream, a Chicago-based organization \nthat provides housing and supportive services to individuals who have been convicted of \nsex offenses, to try to find housing for Marcus. \n \n6.  The last address we submitted is 5726 S. Sangamon, which is a two flat owned and \noperated by Jordan’s Dream. The address has been rejected for the sole reason that \nthere is a “sex offender registered at this address.” It is my understanding based on \nconversations with the landlord, Richard Boykins, that this address meets all of the \nother requirements for housing of individuals who have been convicted of sex offenses. \nIt is not within 500 feet of a school, playground, daycare, or other facility that provides \nservices to children.  \n \n7.  Jordan’s Dream still has room available for Marcus at 5726 S. Sangamon. I and Marcus’ \nother family members are willing and able to pay for Marcus to live there. We have no \nother housing options for Marcus at this time.  \n \n8.  On March 31, 2020, Marcus’ father, my uncle, passed away. I unfortunately had to \ncommunicate the information that his dad had died to Marcus while he remains \nimprisoned at Graham Correctional Center. \n \n9.  Marcus has told me that he has heard that a prison guard employed at Graham \nCorrectional Center has been diagnosed with COVID-19. As a result he feels that he and \nthe other prisoners at Graham, who remain confined in units containing 20 prisoners, \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3-1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:41\nare now at serious risk of contracting the disease. He does not feel safe remaining at \nGraham. \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements are \ntrue and correct. \n \n \n \n__________________________       April 3, 2020 \nDelshay McDaniel \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3-1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:42\n\nCase: 1:20-cv-02137 Document #: 3-1 Filed: 04/05/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:43",
