    "summary": "<p>This is a case about Houston police arresting individuals without warrants and detaining them without probable cause. On December 5, 2016, two plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated sued the City of Houston under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Represented by private counsel and the Civil Rights Corps, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and attorneys&rsquo; fees. They claimed that the City of Houston regularly arrested individuals without warrants and detained them without probable cause hearings for longer than permitted by the United States Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Kennth M. Hoyt on December 7, 2016. The City filed a motion to dismiss the initial complaint. One of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case and on March 1, 2017, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add three more named plaintiffs. As a result, on March 7, the court denied the City's motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness because the filing of an amended complaint renders a prior complaint void and moots any motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>The City filed an amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on June 6, 2017. The court found that the defendants had essentially admitted that the facts the plaintiffs pleaded were true.</p>\r\n<p>The case proceeded to discovery, and the parties engaged in lengthy discovery disputes. On August 30, 2018, the District Court issued an order stating that the City of Houston had intentionally destroyed evidence pertinent to the lawsuit. As a result, the Court held that inferences were appropriate: (1) throughout the class period, the City of Houston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who had not received neutral determinations of probable cause within the constitutionally required period of time; (2) throughout the class period, the City&rsquo;s policymakers were aware of this policy; and (3) the City acted with deliberate indifference with respect to its unconstitutional policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who hadn&rsquo;t received probable cause hearings in the appropriate amount of time.</p>\r\n<p>On December 11, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify their class. The first amended complaint detailed a single class of plaintiffs seeking compensatory relief, which applied to all those arrested without warrant and held for more than 48 hours without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 13, 2018, which added a fifth named plaintiff. Additionally, this second amended complaint defined two classes seeking compensatory relief. The first subclass included all those arrested and held held by the City of Houston without a warrant or a judicial determination of probably cause for 48 hours or more, and the second subclass included those who were arrested and held between 24 and 48 hours.</p>\r\n<p>In spring 2019, the District Court issued an order overruling a motion from the City that asked the Court to exclude certain documents that they claimed to be privileged from evidence. The plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the city to produce these documents, which was stayed by Judge Hoyt pending the City&rsquo;s appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals then vacated the District Court&rsquo;s order with respect to one document, and denied the City&rsquo;s claim of privilege in all other respects. Upon remand, the District Court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to compel.</p>\r\n<p>In late June 2019, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On July 3, 2019, Judge Hoyt granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; earlier motion for class certification. One week later, the City filed a motion to stay the case pending interlocutory appeal regarding the class certification issue, which was denied by the district court in early August. And, shortly after on August 8, 2020 the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants leave to appeal the grant of class certification.</p>\r\n<p>At some during the summer of 2019, the parties began going through mediation and started settlement negotiations, and on August 13, 2019, a joint order to stay the case pending the finalization of settlement was granted.</p>\r\n<p>In July 2020, Houston City Council voted to pass a settlement awarding the plaintiffs $1.17 million in exchange for indemnity. The court granted a joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on October 22, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2021, the court approved the settlement agreement determining it was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class. The settlement payment was $1.17 million.</p>\r\n<p>On August 9, 2022, the plaintiffs' attorney filed an unopposed motion for attorneys' fees and costs. On September 7, 2022, the court granted the motion for fees and costs. Attorneys' fees were $93, 241.28 (part of the total $1.17 million settlement). On December 20, 2024, the case was formally closed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Bradley, Clerk\nHOUSTON DIVISION \n \nJUAN  HERNANDEZ, et al,  ยง  \n  ยง  \n              Plaintiffs,  ยง  \nVS.  ยง     CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:16-CV-3577 \n  ยง  \nCITY OF HOUSTON,  ยง  \n  ยง  \n              Defendant.  ยง  \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  Before the Court is the defendantโs, City of Houston (the City), amended motion to \ndismiss  or,  in  the  alternative,  amended  motion  for  summary  judgment  [DE#  25]  and  the \nplaintiffโs, Juan Hernandez, Dequan Kirkwood, Kent Wheatfall, and Manuel Trevino, on behalf \nof themselves and all others similarly situated, response [DE# 26] to the Cityโs motion(s).  The \nCourt, having fully considered the motion(s) and response, the memoranda in support and in \nopposition and the Memorandum and Opinion โ Finding of Fact and Conclusions of Law in a \nrelated case, determines that the Cityโs motion should be denied.  See Maranda Lynn OโDonnell, \net. al. v. Harris County, Texas, et. al., [CA No. H-16-1414 [DE# 302]. \nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  This suit was filed as an original complaint by plaintiffs, Hernandez and Dossett.  The \nCity filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffโs complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure (โFRCPโ), Rule 12(b)(6) and agreed, alternatively, that a summary judgment was \nproper under FRCP 56 [DE# 15].  In response, Dossett voluntarily dismissed his claims and \nHernandez amended his suit adding Kirkwood, Wheatfall and Trevino as additional plaintiffs.  \n1 / 11 \n\nSee [DE# 18 and 19].  Thereafter, the City promptly amended its motion seeking the same relief \npreviously sought [DE# 25]. \nIII.  THE CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES \n  A.  The Plaintiffsโ Contentions \n  The plaintiffs assert that the City makes approximately 80,000 arrests persons each year.  \nNinety percent, they assert, are warrantless arrests.  In the instance where the person arrested \ncannot pay a pre-set secured money bail immediately, he or she is held in City jail until the \nHarris County [the County] jail officials effect a transfer to its facility.  Only after the person \narrested is transferred does he or she receive a probable cause hearing.  The plaintiffs assert that \nof the 80,000 persons arrested, several hundred, perhaps as many as 1,000, are detained in the \nCity jail in excess of 48 hours without a probable cause hearing or other judicial authorization.  \nBoth  the  Mayor  and  the  Chief  of  Police  of  the  City  are  aware  of  this  practice  and  even \nacknowledge the truth of the plaintiffโs statements. \n  In their pleadings each of the plaintiffs contends that he was held in the Cityโs jail for \nmore than 48 hours without a judicial determination or a probable cause hearing.  In separate \npleadings, Kirwood asserts that: \nOn July 25, 2016, DeQuan Kirkwood drove to visit his probation \nofficer. (ยถ 40.) When he arrived, Houston police officers arrested Mr. \nKirkwood for evading arrest with a vehicle. (ยถ 41.) Mr. Kirkwoodโs \narrest was entered into the Cityโs and the Countyโs electronic records \nat 11:15 PM on July 25, 2016. (ยถ 42.) According to the Countyโs \npublicly available records, on July 28, 2016, at 1:23 AM, more than \n50  hours  later,  Mr.  Kirkwood  was  transferred  to  Harris  County \ncustody. (ยถ 43.)  \n \nAt 7:00 AM on July 28, 2016โmore than 55 hours after his arrestโ\nMr. Kirkwood appeared for his probable cause hearing. (ยถ 44.) The \njudge found that there was no probable cause for Mr. Kirkwoodโs \narrest and continued detention. (ยถ 46.) Mr. Kirkwood was promptly \nreleased. (ยถ 46.) \n \n2 / 11 \n\nSee Kirkwood [DE# 26, at p. 6].  In like manner, Trevino asserts that he was held over 48 hours.  He \nasserts that: \n \nOn July 27, 2016, Manuel Trevino was visiting a friendโs house when \nthe Houston Police arrived and searched the house without a warrant. \n(ยถ 47.) The police found narcotics in the home, and arrested Mr. \nTrevino, along with others in the house. Mr. Trevinoโs arrest was \nentered into the Cityโs and the Countyโs electronic records at 1:55 PM \non July 27, 2016. (ยถ 48.)  \n \nAccording to the Countyโs publicly available records, on July 30, \n2016, at 10:42 PM, Mr. Trevino was booked into Harris County \ncustody. (ยถ 49.) He had been detained in City custody 7 for almost 81 \nhours without a probable cause hearing. According to the Cityโs arrest \ndata, Mr. Trevino was released from the Cityโs custody on July 30, \n2016, at 9:39 PM, almost 80 hours after his arrest. (ยถ 50.)  \n \nOn July 31, 2016, at 10:00 PM, a judge found probable cause for his \narrest and continued detention, i.e., almost 104 hours after his arrest. \n(ยถ 52.) On October 28, 2016, Mr. Trevino pleaded guilty and received \na deferred adjudication. (ยถ 53.) He was not sentenced to any jail time, \nand his sentence was not credited with any time he spent in pre-trial \ncustody.  \n \nSee Trevino [DE# 26 at pp. 6-7].  Wheatfall, also a plaintiff, asserts that his pleadings render the \nCityโs motions a nullity.  He asserts that he, too, was held in excess of 48 hours before receiving \na probable cause hearing.  He pleads the follows: \n \nKent Wheatfall is a retired U.S. Postal Service worker. (ยถ 54.) On \nJanuary 7, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was arrested for aggravated assault. (ยถ \n55.)  Mr.  Wheatfallโs  arrest  was  entered  into  the  Cityโs  and  the \nCountyโs  electronic  records  at  10:30  PM  on  January  7,  2016. \nAccording to the Countyโs publicly available records, on January 10, \n2016, at 1:52 AM, Mr. Wheatfall was booked into County custody. (ยถ \n56.) At that point, he had been in Houston custody for more than 51 \nhours. At 4:00 AM that dayโmore than 53 hours after his arrestโ\nMr. Wheatfall received a probable cause hearing, where a judge found \nprobable cause for his arrest and continued detention.   \n \nOn February 4, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was released on a surety bond. (ยถ \n58.) He was indicted on February 18, 2016. (Id.) On May 17, 2016, \nMr. Wheatfall was rearrested, and could not make bail. (ยถ 59.) He was \nheld until he pleaded guilty and received a deferred adjudication on \n3 / 11 \n\nFebruary 10, 2017. (Id.) He was not sentenced to any jail time, and \nhis sentence was not credited with any time he spent in pre-trial \ncustody. (Id.) \n \nSee Wheatfall [DE# 26, p. 7].  Finally, the plaintiff, Hernandez contends that like Wheatfall, \nKirkwood and Trevino, he was detained by the City in violation of the federal Constitution.  In \nhis pleadings, he asserts: \n \nOn  January  7,  2016,  at  about  4:30  PM,  Houston  police  officers \narrested Juan Hernandez, without a warrant, for misdemeanor assault. \n(ยถ 60.) Mr. Hernandezโs arrest was entered into the Cityโs and the \nCountyโs electronic records at 4:53 PM on January 7, 2016. (ยถ 61.)  \n \nWhen Mr. Hernandez was brought to the City Jail, a jail employee \nthere told him that the County Jail was full and that his transfer to \nHarris County would be delayed. (ยถ 62.) She told Mr. Hernandez to \nโbe  patient.โ  (ยถ  62.)  Later  on,  Mr.  Hernandez  saw  a  City  Jail \nemployee that he knew and the employee said: โYou still here? You \nshouldโve been gone by now.โ (ยถ 63.)  \n \nAccording to the Countyโs publicly available records, on January 10, \n2016, at 12:49 AM, Mr. Hernandez was booked into County custody \nwithout having received a probable cause hearingโalmost 56 hours \nafter his arrest. (ยถ 64.) Mr. Hernandez remembers being held for three \ndays in the City jail. (ยถ 65.) Although, the Countyโs records reflect \nthat Mr. Hernandez was booked into County custody about 56 hours \nafter his arrest, the records reflect that he received a probable cause \nhearing before a judge on January 9, 2016, at 6:00 PMโmore than 49 \nhours after his arrest. (ยถ 66.) Five days after his hearingโafter a week \nin custodyโMr. Hernandez pleaded guilty. (ยถ 68.) He was released \nand given community supervision without jail time, and his sentence \nwas not credited with any time he spent in pre-trial custody.  \n \n  In summary, the plaintiffs contend that the City has established a โpolicy and practiceโ \ni.e., โdo not release arrested until [Harris County] can take them, even though there has been no \nneutral finding of probable cause.โ  Arguing further, the plaintiffs contend that it is the Cityโs \nresponsibility to ensure that arrests are promptly brought before a magistrate or release them.  \nFailing, the City violates both state and federal law by illegally detaining the plaintiffs. \n \n4 / 11 \n\n  B.  The Cityโs Contentions \n  The City seeks dismissal of the plaintiffsโ suit or alternatively a summary judgment that \nterminates the plaintiffsโ suit.  In three contentions, the City asserts that: \n(1)  The plaintiffs have failed to state a ยง 1983 claim against the City because the \nplaintiffs โconcede that their constitutional deprivations, if any, were caused by \nthe policies if Harris County, which is not the Cityโs agent or subject to the Cityโs \ncontrol.โ    See  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983.    In  this  regard,  the  City  points  to  the \nโexceptionally high burdenโ that is imposed on a litigant who seeks to establish \nmunicipal  liability  under  Monell.    See  Monell  v.  New  York  Depโt  of  Social \nServices, 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  Nevertheless, the City concedes that ยง 1983 \nauthorizes suits for constitutional deprivations where the governmentโs conduct \neither by edits or by custom and practice, even though not formal edits by a \ngoverning body operates in such a manner that it may be said represents official \npolicy.  Id. at 690-91, 94.  In further argument, the City argues that the plaintiffs \ncannot โaggregateโ the Cityโs alleged policies with those of the County, and to \nassert that the Cityโs failure to transfer arrestees to outlying counties where a \nmagistrate judge is available, does not constitute a constitutional violation; \n(2)  The  City  contends  that  the  plaintiffโs  individual  claims  fail  because,  as  to \nHernandez, he was not held by the City more than 48 hours, citing to compliance \nwith state law.  See Tex. Code. Crim. Proc. ยง 15.17(a).  With regard to Wheatfall, \nKirkwood and Trevino, the City asserts that they were in the Cityโs custody over \n48 hours but due to โextraordinary circumstances.โ  The City attributes the delay \nin transferring the arrestees to the lack of availability of a judge because the \n5 / 11 \n\nCounty canceled the โdrags [?] for prisoner transport.โ  Therefore, any delay was \ndue to acts of the County, not the City.  In this regard, the City analyzes its \ncircumstance to that in Waganfeald v. Gusman, 674 F.3d 475, 582 (5th Cir. 2012).  \nThere, the Circuit Court, allegedly, excused the delay in releasing arrestees due to \nHurricane Katrina.  See also Brown v. Sudduth, 675 F.3d 472 (5th Cir. 2012).  \n[Here, the Circuit Court declared the unavailability of a magistrate judge as an \nextraordinary circumstance thus excusing delay in releasing arrestees]; \n(3)  Finally, the City asserts that the plaintiffโs do not have standing to assert a cause \nof action against the City under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.  The City \npoints to case law authority from the state Supreme Court where, it asserts, the \ncourt held that persons claiming injury by the application of the Penal Code or the \nCode of Criminal Procedure have no common law remedy.  See City of Beaumont \nv. Bouillion, 896 S.W. 2d 143, 150 (Tex. 1995).  Therefore, the City urges the \nCourt to dismiss any state common law claim that the plaintiffs allege arises as a \nresult  of  alleged  violations  of  Texas  code  of  Criminal  Procedures,  sections \n14.06(a); 15.17(a) and 17.033(a-1) and/or (b). \nIV.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW \n  A.  Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes a defendant to move to  dismiss for \nโfailure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  Under the \ndemanding strictures of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, โ[t]he plaintiff's complaint is to be construed in \na light most favorable to the plaintiff, and the allegations contained therein are to be taken as \ntrue.โ  Oppenheimer v. Prudential Sec., Inc., 94 F.3d 189, 194 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing Mitchell v. \n6 / 11 \n\nMcBryde, 944 F.2d 229, 230 (5th Cir. 1991)).  Dismissal is appropriate only if, the โ[f]actual \nallegations  [are  not]  enough  to  raise  a  right  to  relief  above  the  speculative  level,  on  the \nassumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).โ  Bell Atl. \nCorp.  v.  Twombly,  550  U.S.  544,  555,  127  S.  Ct.  1955,  1965,  167  L.Ed.2d  929  (2007).  \nMoreover, in light of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), โ[s]pecific facts are not necessary; \nthe [factual allegations] need only โgive the defendant fair notice of what the  . . . claim is and the \ngrounds upon which it rests.โ  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 \nL.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964.  Even  \nso, โa plaintiffโs obligation to provide the โgroundsโ of his โentitle[ment] to reliefโ requires more \nthan labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will \nnot do.โ  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S. Ct. at 1964 - 65 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. \n265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986).    \n  Therefore, โ[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ โ Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L. Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 570, 127 S. Ct. at 1974).  โA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.โ  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S. \nCt. at 1955).  โBut where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the \nmere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not โshow [n]โ-โthat the \npleader is entitled to relief.โโ  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \nNevertheless, when considering a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Courtโs task is limited to \ndeciding whether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence in support of his or her claims, not \n7 / 11 \n\nwhether the plaintiff will eventually prevail.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563, 1969 n.8 (citing Scheuer \nv. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed.2d 90 (1974));  see also Jones v. \nGreninger, 188 F.3d 322, 324 (5th Cir. 1999).    \n  B.  Summary Judgment Standard \n  Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the \nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  A fact is โmaterialโ \nif its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.  \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  โFactual disputes that are irrelevant \nor unnecessary will not be counted.โ  Id. at 248.  An issue is โgenuineโ if the evidence is \nsufficient for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  Id.   If the evidence \nrebutting the motion for summary judgment is only colorable or not significantly probative, \nsummary judgment should be granted.  Id. at 249-50; see also Shields v. Twiss, 389 F.3d 142, \n149-50 (5th Cir. 2004). \n  Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the moving party bears the \ninitial burden of โinforming the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying those \nportions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue for trial.โ  \nMatsushita Elec. Ind. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 - 87 (1986); Adams v. \nTravelers Indem. Co. of Connecticut, 465 F.3d 156, 163 (5th Cir. 2006).  Where the moving \nparty has met its Rule 56(c) burden, the nonmovant must come forward with โspecific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.โ  Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586-87 (quoting Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(e)) (emphasis in original); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986); and Adams, \n465 F.3d at 164.  To sustain the burden, the nonmoving party must produce evidence admissible \nat trial showing that reasonable minds could differ regarding a genuine issue of material fact.  \n8 / 11 \n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 250-51; 255; Morris v. Covan World Wide Moving, Inc., 144 F.3d 377, \n380 (5th Cir. 1998).  In deciding a summary judgment motion, โ[t]he evidence of the nonmovant \nis to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.โ  Anderson, 477 U.S. \nat 255. \nThe City asserts that FRCP 12(b)(6) dictates that the plaintiffsโ suit be dismissed because \nthe plaintiffsโ pleading fail to assert factual claim allegations that apply to the City.  In this \nregard, the City asserts that the plaintiffsโ pleadings fail to state facts from which a reasonable \ninference of wrongdoing or misconduct may be drawn for which the City might be held liable. \n  The Court accepts the well-pleaded facts stated in the plaintiffs amended complaint and \nconcludes that, on its face, a plausible claim is stated.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009).  On its face, the plaintiffโs complaint asserts that the Cityโs policymakers have adopted a \npolicy or practice of failing to release arrestees for an unreasonable period of time without \nproviding the arrestees with a probable cause hearing and that that practice is the โmoving forceโ \nbehind the plaintiffsโ allegations of violations of federal Constitutional and state law.  The City, \nall but admits that these facts are true yet argues that extraordinary circumstances or Harris \nCounty is the cause.    \nThe Court holds that the City claim of extraordinary circumstances is merely a defense to \nan  otherwise  legitimate  claim.    Whether  the  Cityโs  defense(s)  carry  the  day,  rest  on  a \ndetermination  of  disputed  facts  and  law.    The  Court  accepts  the  well-pleaded  facts  in  the \nplaintiffsโ amended complaint as true and determines that the Cityโs motion to dismiss should be \ndenied. \n  The City also seeks summary judgment on the plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims. In order for the \nplaintiffs to prevail on their ยง 1983 claim they must establish that a policymaker, by edit or by \n9 / 11 \n\nestablished practice permitted a violation of a constitutional right which violation is the โmoving \nforceโ of the policy or custom.  Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir. 2001).  \nThe alleged unconstitutional conduct must be directly attributable to the municipality.  Id. at 578.  \nAssuming the plaintiffsโ pleading to be true, the plaintiffs have stated a custom or practice that is \ndirectly related to the plaintiffsโ claim for constitutional deprivation.  It might be said that the \nCity violates both state and federal law, but places the blame on Harris County.  It is of no \nconsequence  that  state  common  law  does  not  provide  a  remedy  for  the  Cityโs  conduct.  \nAssuming a violation of the plaintiffsโ Fourth and/or Eighth Amendment rights to a prompt \ndetention hearing, a state law violation may show deliberate indifference on the part of the City.  \nSee Jackler v. Byrne 658 F.3d 225, 236 (2nd Cir. 2011).  A disrespect and disregard for a known \nstatute may become a method or means by which a federal Constitutional right is abridged.  See \nZarnow v. City of Wichita Falls, 614 F.3d 161, 169 (5th Cir. 2010). \n  The City argues that it has no control over the arrestees and that it is not the Cityโs fault \nthat the arrestees do not receive timely Constitutional probable cause hearings.  This argument \nsuggests that the City is at the โmercyโ of Harris County.  If that is the case, that fact establishes \nthe Cityโs policy.  The City becomes an agent for Harris County and/or an โaider and abetterโ in \nHarris  Countyโs  unconstitutional  conduct.    This  is  so  because  the  City  has  consistently \nparticipated  in  Harris  Countyโs  alleged  conduct  with  full  knowledge  of  the  constitutional \nimplications; yet, over the years has failed to demonstrate governance over its own affairs and \nthe Cityโs separate duty to comply with federal law.  Such knowledge and conduct demonstrates \na course of conduct that may be determined as callous to the plaintiffsโ alleged violations.  See \nZarnow, 614 F.3d at 169 (5th Cir. 2010). \n10 / 11 \n\n  Therefore, the Court is of the opinion that disputed fact issue also defeats the Cityโs \namended motion for summary judgment.  The motion is Denied in the entirety. \n  It is so Ordered.  \n  SIGNED on this 6th day of June, 2017. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nKenneth M.

Bradley, Clerk\nHOUSTON DIVISION \n \nJUAN HERNANDEZ, et al.,  ยง  \n  ยง  \n              Plaintiffs,  ยง  \nvs.  ยง     CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:16-CV-3577 \n  ยง  \nTHE CITY OF HOUSTON, TEXAS,  ยง  \n  ยง  \n              Defendant.  ยง  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n  This matter is before the Court on the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification.  (Dkt. \nNos. 86).  The defendant, the City of Houston, has filed a response in opposition to the \nmotion (Dkt. No. 112), the plaintiffs have filed a reply (Dkt. No. 115), and the City of \nHouston  has  filed  a  sur-reply.    (Dkt.  No.  119).    After  having  carefully  considered  the \nplaintiffsโ motion, the opposition and reply briefs filed thereto, and the applicable law, the \nCourt determines that the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification should be GRANTED.   \nII.  BACKGROUND \n  The named plaintiffs, Juan Hernandez, DeQuan Kirkwood, Manuel Trevino, Kent \nWheatfall, and Eric Aguirre (collectively, the โplaintiffsโ), are five individuals who were \narrested without a warrant after December 5, 2014, and detained by the City of Houston \neither for more than 48 hours or for more than 24 hours but less than 48 hours.  The \ndefendant is the City of Houston, Texas (โthe Cityโ).  The plaintiffs have initiated this \nlawsuit against the City, alleging that the City routinely and callously disregards the Fourth \nAmendment to the U. S. Constitution and Texas state law by arresting individuals without a \n1 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 2 of 12\nwarrant and detaining them in the City of Houston Jail for unreasonable periods of detention, \nwithout the requisite judicial probable cause determination.   \n  Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that as a matter of policy and practice, probable \ncause determinations for warrantless arrestees in the Cityโs custody, who have not otherwise \nposted bail, are provided only after the arrestees have been transferred to the Harris County \nJail.  The plaintiffs maintain that whenever it takes longer than 48 hours to transfer such \narrestees to the Harris County Jail, the City, as a matter of practice and custom, continues to \ndetain the arrestees in its jail cells, without a neutral probable cause finding, instead of \nreleasing them after 48 hours as the Fourth Amendment requires.   \n  The plaintiffs have commenced this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Texas law seeking compensatory \ndamages for the Cityโs practice and custom of overdetaining warrantless arrestees.  They \nnow seek certification of the following classes: \nClass A:  All people arrested without a warrant after December 5, 2014, and \ndetained by the City of Houston for more than 48 hours. \n \nClass B:  All people arrested without a warrant after December 5, 2014, and \ndetained by the City of Houston for more than 24 hours and less than 48 hours. \n \n \n  The  City,  in  opposition,  disputes  the  plaintiffsโ  allegations  and  argues  that  the \nplaintiffsโ case is fundamentally flawed.  It maintains that such delays, if any, are due to \nextraordinary circumstances, such as overcrowding.  Further, the City opposes certification, \nclaiming that the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proof necessary to certify a \nclass under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Specifically, the City argues \nthat: (1) under Rule 23(a)(1), the plaintiffsโ claims of numerosity are inaccurate; (2) under \n2 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 3 of 12\nRule 23(a)(2), the plaintiffsโ Class A and Class B claims lack commonality and cannot be \nresolved class-wide; (3) under Rule 23(a)(3), the plaintiffsโ Class A and Class B claims are \nnot typical of the claims of the putative class members; (4) under Rule 23(a)(4), the named \nplaintiffs would be inadequate class representatives; and (5) under Rule 23(b)(3), individual \nissues predominate over common questions and a class action is not the superior method for \nresolving the plaintiffsโ claims. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n  Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs federal class actions.  Unger \nv. Amedisys Inc., 401 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir. 2005).  โThe party seeking [class] certification \nbears the burden of establishing that all requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied.โ  Id. \n(citing Berger v. Compaq Comput. Corp., 257 F.3d 475, 479 - 80 (5th Cir. 2001) (emphasis \nin original)).  To certify a class, a plaintiff must show that the putative class meets the four \nprerequisites  contained  in  Rule  23(a),1  which  are  often  referred  to  as  โnumerosity, \ncommonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.โ  Gene And Gene LLC v. BioPay \nLLC, 541 F.3d 318, 325 (5th Cir. 2008); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition to the \naforementioned prerequisites, a plaintiff must establish that the action satisfies at least one of \nthe three enumerated categories contained in Rule 23(b).  Gene, 541 F.3d at 325 (citing \n                                                 \n1 Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifically provides: \n \n(a)  Prerequisites.  One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties \non behalf of all members only if:  \n \n(1)  the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are \nquestions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  the  class;  (3)  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n \nFed. R. Civ .P. 23(a). \n \n3 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 4 of 12\nAmchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 - 14, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed.2d 689 \n(1997)). \nAlthough a district court has broad discretion when deciding whether to certify a \nclass, a court must, nonetheless, exercise that discretion โwithin the framework of [R]ule \n23.โ  Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 1996) (citing Gulf Oil Co. v. \nBernard, 452 U.S. 89, 100, 101 S. Ct. 2193, 2200, 68 L. Ed.2d 693 (1981)).  District courts \nare to โconduct a โrigorous analysis of the Rule 23 prerequisitesโ before certifying a class.โ  \nOโSullivan v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 319 F.3d 732, 738 (5th Cir. 2003) (quoting \nCastano, 84 F.3d at 740).  When performing such an analysis, a district court is permitted to \nโlook beyond the pleadings to โunderstand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable \nsubstantive lawโโ in order to make a determination as to whether Rule 23โs prerequisites \nhave been satisfied.  OโSullivan, 319 F.3d at 738 (quoting Castano, 84 F.3d at 744).  \nIV.  ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION \n  A.  Prerequisites Under Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a) \n    1.  Rule 23(a)(1):  Numerosity \nIn order to satisfy the first prerequisite under Rule 23(a), the numerosity requirement, \na plaintiff must demonstrate that โthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  A โmere allegation that the class is too numerous \nto make joinder practicableโ will not suffice.  Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 868 \n(5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Fleming v. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., 707 F.2d 829, 833 (5th Cir. \n1983)).    Instead,  โa  plaintiff  must  ordinarily  demonstrate  some  evidence  or  reasonable \nestimate of the number of purported class members.โ  Pederson, 213 F.3d at 868 (quoting \nZeidman v. J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. 1981)).  Generally, \n4 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 5 of 12\na  class  of  more  than  40  members  is  presumptively  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  numerosity \nrequirement.  See Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(citing 1 Newberg on Class Actions ยง 3.05, at 3โ25 (3d ed. 1992) (โsuggesting that any class \nconsisting  of  more  than  forty  members  โshould  raise  a  presumption  that  joinder  is \nimpracticableโโ)). \nThe plaintiffs have tendered a spreadsheet, produced by the City, reflecting the jail, \narrest, and charging information for all individuals arrested during the class period.  (See \nDkt. No. 86, Ex. 1).  Based on the spreadsheet, the plaintiffs contend that the City detained \nโat least 1,560 people in excess of 48 hours and at least 6,111 people in excess of 24 hours, \nall without the constitutionally required finding of probable cause.โ  (Dkt. No. 86 at 3; see \nalso Ex. 1).  The members of the proposed classes are ascertainable using objective standards \nand the data submitted.  While the City disputes the accuracy of the plaintiffsโ calculations, \nasserting that โ[e]liminating persons who were the subject of issued warrants at the time of \ntheir arrest [would] yield[] a materially smaller number of people,โ it, nevertheless, concedes \nthat even a few hundred class members would suffice to satisfy Rule 23(a)โs numerosity \nrequirement.  (Dkt. No. 112 at 22).  Since the number of individuals who were detained for \nthe requisite timeframes during the class period is quite substantial, and more likely than not \ngreater than 100, the Court concludes that the number of potential class members in this \nlawsuit satisfies the numerosity requirement.  See Mullen, 186 F.3d at 624 โ 25. \n2.  Rule 23(a)(2):  Commonality \nIn  order  to  establish  the  second  prerequisite  under  Rule  23(a),  the  commonality \nrequirement, a plaintiff must demonstrate that โthere are questions of law or fact common to \nthe  class.โ    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)(2).    The  threshold  for  establishing  the  commonality \n5 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 6 of 12\nrequirement is not extraordinary and merely aims, at least partly, at โdetermining whether \nthere is a need for combined treatment and a benefit to be derived therefrom.โ  Jenkins v. \nRaymark Indus., Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986) (internal citations omitted).  To \nsatisfy the commonality prerequisite, โplaintiff[s] need only show that โthere is at least one \nissue whose resolution will affect all or a significant number of the putative class members.โโ  \nDoiron v. Conseco Health Ins. Co., No. 07-30357, 2008 WL 2199821, *2 (5th Cir. May 28, \n2008) (quoting Forbush v. J.C. Penney Co., 994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir. 1993) (citation \nomitted)).   \nThe issue, however, โneed not relate specifically to the damages component of the \nclass membersโ claims.โ  In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d 790, 810 (5th Cir. 2014).  \nRather, โthe legal requirement that class members have all โsuffered the same injuryโ can be \nsatisfied  by  an  instance  of  the  defendantโs  injurious  conduct,  even  when  the  resulting \ninjurious effectsโthe damagesโare diverse.โ  Id. at 810 โ 11.  The fact โ[t]hat some of the \nplaintiffs may have different claims, or claims that may require some individualized analysis, \nis not fatal to [the] commonalityโ requirement.  Doiron, 2008 WL 2199821, at *2 (internal \nquotations and citation omitted).  \nThe  City  maintains  that  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  satisfy  the  commonality \nrequirements with regard to the proposed classes because neither Class A nor Class Bโs \nclaims can be resolved class-wide and the Cityโs defenses are plaintiff-specific.  (See Dkt. \nNo. 112 at 15 โ 18).  These alleged disparities, without more, are insufficient to defeat the \ncommonality requirement.  See Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 177 (3d Cir. 1988) (โRule 23 \ndoes not require that the representative plaintiff have endured precisely the same injuries that \nhave been sustained by the class members, only that the harm complained of be common to \n6 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 7 of 12\nthe class, and that the named plaintiff demonstrate a personal interest or โthreat of injury . . . \n[that]  is  โreal  and  immediate,โ  not  โconjecturalโ  or  โhypothetical.โโ)  (internal  citations \nomitted).  In this case, there are questions of law and fact that are common to the class, such \nas whether the City has a policy or follows an alleged practice or custom of overdetention \nand whether such overdetention violates the Constitution and/or Texas state law.  Despite the \nfactual distinctions that might differentiate one class member from another, all purported \nclass members will share these common questions.  Accordingly, the Court determines that \nthe plaintiffs have satisfied the commonality requirement. \n3.  Rule 23(a)(3): Typicality \n  To  satisfy  the  third  prerequisite  under  Rule  23(a),  the  typicality  requirement,  a \nplaintiff must demonstrate that  โthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  Much like the test \nfor commonality, โthe test for typicality is not demanding.โ  Mullen, 186 F.3d at 625.  The \ntypicality test โfocuses on the similarity between the named plaintiffsโ legal and remedial \ntheories and the theories of those whom they purport to represent.โ  Id. (quoting Lightbourn \nv. Cty. of El Paso, 118 F.3d 421, 426 (5th Cir. 1997).  The Supreme Court has explained the \ntest as follows: \nThe commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge.  \nBoth  serve  as  guideposts  for  determining  whether  under  the  particular \ncircumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the \nnamed  plaintiffโs  claim  and  the  class  claims  are  so  interrelated  that  the \ninterests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their \nabsence. \n  \nGen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 2371, 72 L. \nEd. 2d 740 (1982). \n7 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 8 of 12\nThe City argues that the named plaintiffsโ damages are not typical of the classes they \nseek to represent, as each seeks individualized damages.  (See Dkt. No. 112 at 15 โ 18).  This \nvariance, alone, is not fatal to a finding of typicality, as diverse injurious effects, such as \ndamages, are permitted as long as the named plaintiffsโ injuries arise from the same course of \nconduct that gives rise to the other putative class membersโ claims.  See In re Deepwater \nHorizon, 739 F.3d at 810 โ 811.  Here, the named plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims \nof the putative class members because they arise from an identical factual predicate and/or \nthe same course of conduct and are premised on the same legal theory.  The fact that some \nclass members may have been overdetained for varying lengths of time is not determinative.  \nThus, the Court determines that the plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement. \n      4.   Rule 23(a)(4): Adequacy of Representation \n  To  meet  the  prerequisites  of  Rule  23(a)(4),  the  adequacy  of  representation \nrequirement, the plaintiffs are required to establish that โthe representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Stated another \nway,  โthe  court  must  find  that  class  representatives,  their  counsel,  and  the  relationship \nbetween the two are adequate to protect the interests of absent class members.โ  Unger, 401 \nF.3d at 321 (citing Stirman v. Exxon Corp., 280 F.3d 554, 562 (5th Cir. 2002)).  โThe \nadequacy inquiry . . . โserves to uncover conflicts of interest between the named plaintiffs \nand the class they seek to represent.โโ  Berger, 257 F.3d at 479 - 80 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting \nAmchem, 521 U.S. at 625).  Class representatives are required to have a sufficient level of \nknowledge and understanding so as to be capable of prosecuting or controlling the litigation.  \nSee Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 429 F.3d 125, 129 - 30 (5th Cir. 2005).  Likewise, class \ncounsel must be competent and zealous; all representatives must possess a willingness and \n8 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 9 of 12\nability โto take an active role in and control the litigation and to protect the interests of \nabsentees.โ  Id. at 130 (internal citations omitted).  โDifferences between named plaintiffs \nand class members [will] render the named plaintiffs inadequate representatives only where \nthose differences create conflicts between the named plaintiffsโ and the class membersโ \ninterest.โ  Berger, 257 F.3d at 480 (emphasis added); see also Mullen, 186 F.3d at 626 \n(acknowledging that while the differences described by the defendant could create variances \nin  the  ways  that  the  named  plaintiffs  and  putative  class  members  prove  causation  and \ndamages, the alignment of their interests will not be affected). \n     The City challenges the named plaintiffsโ adequacy on various grounds, namely that \nthey lack sufficient knowledge and understanding of this case to adequately serve as class \nrepresentatives and direct or control the instant litigation.  The City does not, however, \ndispute class counselโs adequacy and extensive litigation experience.  Such adequacy is well \nestablished in the records now before the Court.  With regard to the named plaintiffs, the City \nhas set forth no evidence supporting a disparity between the interests of the named plaintiffs \nand those of the absent class members.  Nor has it tendered any evidence of any internal class \nconflicts.  The plaintiffs, on the other hand, have demonstrated that no conflicts of interest \nexist between the named plaintiffs and the putative class members.  The plaintiffs have also \nestablished that the named plaintiffs share the same interest as the putative class members, in \nthat they have suffered the same harm as that encountered by other putative members, and \nhave a general understanding of their position as plaintiff representatives and knowledge \nconcerning the wrongdoing alleged against the class as a whole.  Accordingly, this Court \ndetermines that the plaintiffs have satisfied the adequacy of representation requirement.  \n \n9 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 10 of 12\n  B.  Prerequisites Under Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 23(b)(3) \n  After Rule 23(a)โs prerequisites are satisfied, a putative class must demonstrate that it \nqualifies under one of Rule 23(b)โs categories.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b).  In this case, the \nplaintiffs  seek  to  certify  Class  A  and  Class  B  under  Rule  23(b)(3).2    โTo  gain  class \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3), a proposed class must satisfy Rule 23(a) and โ[c]ommon \nquestions must โpredominate over any questions affecting only individual membersโ[,] and \nclass  resolution  must  be  โsuperior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient \nadjudication of the controversy.โโ  Maldonado v.

The  first  prong  of  Rule  23(b)(3),  the  predominance  inquiry,  โis  โmore \ndemanding than the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)โ and requires courts โto consider \nhow a trial on the merits would be conducted if a class were certified.โโ  Maldonado, 493 \nF.3d at 525 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 339 F.3d 294, 301 - 02 (5th Cir. 2003) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \n                                                 \n2 Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part, as follows: \n \n(b) Types of Class Actions.  A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: \n \n(3)  the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate \nover any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior \nto other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.  The \nmatters pertinent to these findings include: \n \n(A) the class membersโ interests in individually controlling the prosecution or \ndefense of separate actions; \n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun \nby or against class members; \n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in \nthe particular forum; and \n(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. \n \nFed. R. Civ .P. 23(b)(3). \n \n \n10 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 11 of 12\nThe City argues that individual issues of law and fact predominate over common \nones.  This Court does not agree, as the plaintiffs have shown that the factual and legal issues \nthat are common to the class members predominate over any such individualized issues.  \nIndeed, the dominant issues in this case hinge on liability derived from the same course of \nconduct and premised on the same legal theory.  The fact that the damages award for each \nclass member may vary does not preclude a finding that common questions of law and fact \npredominate over any individualized issues because, here, the plaintiffs seek to litigate only \nthe issue of general damages on a class-wide basis.  Specifically, the plaintiffs โpropose that \nthe  Court  ask  the  jury  to  determine  the  appropriate  general  damages  for  each  hour  of \nunlawful detention but . . . leave any question of specific damages to individual resolution.โ  \n(Dkt. No. 86 at 14); see also In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d at 815 - 16 (quoting Bell \nAtl., 339 F.3d at 306) (โโEven wide disparity among class members as to the amount of \ndamagesโ does not preclude class certification โand courts, therefore, have certified classes \neven  in  light  of  the  need  for  individualized  calculations  of  damages.โโ).    Under  these \ncircumstances, this Court determines that the predominance prerequisite has been satisfied.   \n  The second prong of Rule 23(b)(3) requires that a class action be โsuperior to other \navailable methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(3).  The superiority requirement is  โfact-specific and will vary depending on the \ncircumstances of any given case.โ  In re TWL Corp., 712 F.3d 886, 896 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(quoting Robertson v. Monsanto Co., 287 Fed. Appx. 354, 361 (5th Cir. 2008)).  When, as \nhere, the potential individual recovery for extremely similar individual claims is so slight that \nit would not be economically efficient to maintain individual lawsuits, class treatment is \nappropriate.   See Castano, 84 F.3d  at 748 (โThe  most compelling rationale for finding \n11 / 12 \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 154   Filed on 07/03/19 in TXSD   Page 12 of 12\nsuperiority in a class action [is] the existence of a negative value suit.โ).  Thus, the Court \ndetermines that a class action is superior to other mechanisms for adjudicating the underlying \ncontroversy. \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  Based on the foregoing, the plaintiffsโ motion for class certification is GRANTED. \nIt is so ORDERED. \n  SIGNED on this 3rd day of July, 2019. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nKenneth M.

INTRODUCTION \nHouston  police  make  hundreds  of  warrantless  arrests  every  week.    The  Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Texas state law require that anyone arrested \nwithout  a  warrant  be  released  promptlyโafter  48  hours  at  the  longestโunless  a  neutral \nmagistrate has concluded that there was probable cause for her arrest and continued detention.  \nHouston has a policy and practice of disregarding this simple obligation.  Whenever the Harris \nCounty Jail (where Houston sends all warrantless arrestees for probable cause hearings) refuses \nto accept custody of an arrestee, or whenever Houstonโs own arrest procedures are delayed, \nHouston continues to detain arrestees in its jail cells without probable cause rather than release \nthem after 48 hours as the Constitution requires.  In July and August 2016 alone, there were \nhundreds  of  people  arrested  without  a  warrant  who  did  not  receive  a  probable  cause \ndetermination within 48 hours but were still kept in City custody.   \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 2 of 14\n \nII.  NATURE OF THE ACTION1 \n1.  The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.  \nMisdemeanor and felony arrestees in City custody who do not post bail are eventually transferred \nto the Harris County Jail, where they receive probable cause hearings conducted by video.  As a \nmatter  of  policy  and  practice,  the  City  of  Houston  does  not  provide  probable  cause \ndeterminations  for  warrantless  arrestees  in  its  custody.    Probable  cause  determinations  are \nprovided only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail.  When it takes \nlonger than 48 hours to transfer an arresteeโand it often doesโHouston, as a matter of policy \nand practice, simply continues to detain the arrestee rather than provide a prompt probable cause \nhearing or release.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, seek \ncompensatory damages for Houstonโs policy of detaining warrantless arrestees in violation of the \nUnited States Constitution and state law. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n3.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \n4.  This  Court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  the  state  law  causes  of  action \nasserted in this Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 because the state law claims form part of \nthe same case or controversy as the federal law claim. \nIV.  PARTIES \n5.  Named Plaintiff Juan Hernandez is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n                                                 \n1  Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they \nhad personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 3 of 14\n \n6.  Named Plaintiff James Dossett is a resident of Baytown, Texas.  \n7.  Defendant City of Houston is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of \nthe State of Texas.  It is the most populous city in Texas and is located in Harris County, the \nmost populous county in the state.  The City operates the Houston Police Department and the \nHouston Municipal Jail (โHouston Jailโ).   \nV.  THE CITY OF HOUSTONโS PRACTICES \n8.  Approximately 80,000 people were arrested by the City of Houston in 2014 and \n2015.  Almost 90 percent of those people were arrested without a warrant.   \n9.  As a matter of policy and practice, the City transfers felony and misdemeanor \narrestees to the Harris County Jail for booking if they are unable to immediately pay a money \nbail amount set by a predetermined schedule.  Harris County then assembles groups of arrestees \nto appear before a Harris County Hearing Officer for a probable cause hearing.  These hearings \noccur by video link: the arrestees remain in the jail and a hearing officer and an assistant district \nattorney participate in the hearing from a room in the courthouse. The assistant district attorney \nreads  the  alleged  facts  supporting  the  charges  against  the  arrestee,  and  the  hearing  officer \ndetermines whether there was probable cause for the arrest. \n10.  As a matter of policy and practice, judicial determinations of probable cause for \nwarrantless arrests are not conducted while an individual is in the City of Houstonโs custody.  \nThey take place only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail. \n11.  Therefore, any individual arrested without a warrant who remains in the City of \nHoustonโs custody has not had a judicial determination of probable cause. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 4 of 14\n \n12.  As a matter of policy and practice, the City does not release people who do not \npay bail even if 48 hours or more have passed since their arrest.2   \n13.  The Harris County Jail is notoriously overcrowded.3  In July and August 2016, the \novercrowding  was  so  dire  that  the  County  told  the  Houston  Police  Department  to  stop \ntransferring inmates to the County Jail, and refused to accept busloads of inmates from the \nHouston Jail. 4  A spokesman for the Harris County Sheriffโs Office told the City that there was \nโno room at the inn.โ   \n14.  As a result, many individuals arrested by the City without a warrant were kept in \nthe  Houston  Jail  longer  than  48  hours  without  a  judicial  determination  of  probable  cause.  \nBooking records for 2016 show that in July and August alone, Houston held hundreds of inmates \nin its jail for longer than three days before transferring them to Harris County. \n15.  The  large  number  of  illegal  detentions  in  July  and  August  of  2016  reflects \nHoustonโs broad, longstanding, and consistent policy of refusing to release warrantless arrestees \neven if more than 48 hours have passed since their warrantless arrest.  For example, booking \n                                                 \n2  Houston releases all arrestees who can pay predetermined financial conditions of release immediately.  It \nkeeps in detention only those who are unable to afford release.  At no point do City officials conduct any inquiry \ninto whether arrestees have the ability to pay the predetermined amount of money required for release.   \n3  See, e.g., St. John Barned-Smith, Inmates transferred, jails overcrowded, Houston Chronicle (Apr. 17, \n2016), available at http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Inmates-transferred-jails-\novercrowded-7251977.php; Michael Barajas, Why the Harris County Jail is Overcrowded with Legally Innocent \nPeople, Houston Press (July 1, 2015), available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/why-the-harris-county-jail-\nis-overcrowded-with-legally-innocent-people-7555627; Meagan Flynn, Harris County Sheriff May Hand Over 17-\nYear-Olds  to  Private  Prison  Contractor,  Houston  Press  (Sept.  29,  2016),  available  at \nhttp://www.houstonpress.com/news/harris-county-sheriff-may-hand-over-17-year-olds-to-private-prison-contractor-\n8812196; Meagan Flynn, Nearly 200 People Have Died in Harris County Sheriffโs Office Custody in 10 Years, \nHouston Press (Aug. 1, 2016), available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/nearly-200-people-have-died-in-\nharris-county-sheriffs-office-custody-in-10-years-8616676. \n4  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston \nPress (Sept. 8, 2016), available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-the-\nsheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391 (quoting Sheriffโs Office Spokesman Ryan Sullivan as saying, โWe \ncouldnโt keep up with the rate of people we had coming here. . . . We are limited to a certain number of people, and \nthatโs that.โ). \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 5 of 14\n \nrecords show that one person arrested on July 25 did not receive a probable cause determination \nuntil July 31 (more than 144 hours after arrest); another person, arrested on July 23, did not \nreceive a probable cause determination until July 30 (more than 168 hours after arrest); and at \nleast 35 other people in the months of July and August waited more than four days (96 hours) \nbetween arrest and a probable cause determination.   \n16.  The City of Houston โoperates under a permanent injunction preventing it from \ndetaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-four hours without taking the person \nbefore a magistrate.โ   Lockett v. State, 2006 WL 940648 at *1 (Tex. App. Apr. 13, 2006) (citing \nSanders v. City of Houston, 543 F. Supp. 694 (S.D. Tex. 1982), affโd 741 F.2d 1379 (5th Cir. \n1984)).  \n17.  As a practical matter, there is no reason to delay probable cause determinations \nbeyond 24 hours, which is the time limit provided by local court rule for such hearings for \nmisdemeanor defendants.  See Harris Cnty. Crim. Ct. Rule 4.2.  And, within counties that have \nmore than three million residentsโHarris County has approximately 4.1 million residentsโ\nTexas state law requires the detaining agency to release warrantless misdemeanor arrestees from \njail without secured bail if probable cause has not been determined within 36 hours.  Tex. Code \nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.033 (West 2015).  Harris County does not combine the probable cause \nhearing  with  other  pretrial  proceedings  or  the  appointment  of  counsel,  and  it  has  robust \ntechnological resources to provide judicial probable cause findings well in advance of the 48-\nhour limit, even if an arrestee is not physically brought to the Harris County jail.  The County \nconducts probable cause hearings by video link many times per day, throughout the day, every \nday of the year.    \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 6 of 14\n \nJuan Hernandez \n18.  On January 7, 2016, at about 4:30 PM, Houston police officers arrested Juan \nHernandez, without a warrant, for misdemeanor assault.  \n19.  Mr.  Hernandezโs  arrest  was  entered  into  the  City  of  Houstonโs  and  Harris \nCountyโs electronic records at 4:53 PM on January 7, 2016. \n20.  When Mr. Hernandez was brought to the Houston City Jail, a jail employee there \ntold him that the Harris County Jail was full and that his transfer to Harris County would be \ndelayed.  She told Mr. Hernandez to โbe patient.โ  \n21.  Mr. Hernandez was not brought before a judge until January 9, 2016, at 6:00 PM.  \nHe had been held over 49 hours without receiving a judicial determination of probable cause. \n22.  Five days after his hearingโafter a week in custodyโMr. Hernandez pled guilty.  \nHe was released and given community supervision without jail time.    \nJames Dossett \n23.  On January 7, 2016, at approximately 8:00 PM, Houston police officers arrested \nJames Dossett, without a warrant, for possession of a controlled substance. \n24.  His arrest was entered into the Cityโs computerized records at 8:10 PM that day. \n25.   Mr. Dossett was held in the Houston Jail until January 10, 2016, when he was \ntransferred to the Harris County Jail and received a probable cause hearing by video link at 4:00 \nAM.  He had been held for 56 hours without receiving a probable cause hearing. \n26.  While Mr. Dossett was held in City custody, his friends attempted to find him to \nbail him out.  But they could not locate him until the fifth day of his detention, after he had \nalready been transferred to County custody. \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 7 of 14\n \n27.  Two days after his probable cause hearing, on January 12, 2016, Mr. Dossett \nposted bond through a surety and was released. \n28.  On April 22, 2016, Harris County dropped the charges against Mr. Dossett.  Court \nrecords indicate that no controlled substance was found in the evidence against him.  \nVI.  CLASS ACTION \n29.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action, on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common \nbasis. \n30.  A class action is a superior means, and the only practicable means, by which the \nnamed Plaintiffs and unknown Class Members can challenge the Cityโs unlawful detention \npolicy. \n31.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant \nto Rule 23(a)(1)โ(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n32.  This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  adequacy, \npredominance, and superiority requirements of those provisions. \n33.  The named Plaintiff proposes a single Class seeking compensatory relief.  The \nClass is defined as: All persons who were arrested without a warrant and who were detained by \nthe City of Houston without the provision of a prompt judicial determination of probable causeโ\n48 hours at the longestโat any time within two years before the filing of this Complaint until the \ndate of the order granting class certification.5  \n                                                 \n5  The statute of limitations for both claims is two years. Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 576 \n(5th Cir. 2001).  Plaintiffs reserve the right to argue that under the circumstances of this case detaining warrantless \narrestees for periods less than 48 hours may be unreasonable.  See Sanders v. City of Houston, 543 F. Supp. 694 \n(S.D. Tex. 1982), affโd 741 F.2d 1379 (5th Cir. 1984) (issuing a permanent injunction against the City of Houston \nenjoining it from detaining warrantless arrestees for more than 24 hours without a proper determination of probable \ncause); see also Lockett v. State, 2006 WL 940648 at *1 (Tex. App. Apr. 13, 2006) (โthe Houston police department \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 8 of 14\n \nA.  Numerosity. Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n34.  The individuals in the class are so numerous that joinder of all members would be \nimpractical. \n35.  In June and July of 2016 alone, the Cityโs records show that the City of Houston \nconfined hundreds of warrantless arrestees longer than 48 hours without a judicial determination \nof probable cause.  \n36.  The Cityโs records show that violations occurred throughout 2016. Thousands of \narrestees  were  likely  subjected  to  this  policy  during  the  class  period.    Because  joinder  of \nthousands of plaintiffs would be impracticable, this case satisfies the numerosity requirement. \nB.  Commonality. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n37.  The relief sought is common to all Class Members, and common questions of law \nand fact exist as to all Class Members.  The named Plaintiffs seek relief concerning whether the \nCityโs policies, practices, and procedures violated the rights of the Class Members. \n38.  Common legal and factual questions arise from one central scheme: the Cityโs \npolicy of detaining warrantless arrestees even beyond 48 hours when there has not been a \nprobable cause determination by a neutral magistrate.  The City has operated this policy openly \nand in materially the same manner every day.  The resolution of these legal and factual issues \nwill determine whether all of the Class Members are entitled to the relief that they seek. \n39.  There are questions of law and fact common to all Class Members.  Among these \ncommon questions are: \na.  Whether  it  violates  the  United  States  Constitution  to  detain  warrantless \narrestees for unreasonable periods of time, including in excess of 48 hours, \nwithout a judicial determination of probable cause for the detention; \n                                                                                                                                                             \noperates under a permanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons without a warrant for more than twenty-\nfour hours without taking the person before a magistrate.โ).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 9 of 14\n \nb.  Whether it violates state law to detain warrantless arrestees for unreasonable \nperiods  of  time,  including  in  excess  of  48  hours,  without  a  judicial \ndetermination of probable cause for the detention;  \nc.  Whether the City of Houston maintained a policy, custom, or widespread \npractice of detaining warrantless arrestees for unreasonable periods of time, \nincluding routinely in excess of 48 hours, without a judicial determination of \nprobable cause for the detention. \nC.  Typicality.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).   \n40.  The named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the other Class Members, \nand the named Plaintiffs have the same interests in this case as all other Class Members.  Each \nClass Member was arrested without a warrant and did not receive a probable cause hearing \nwithin a reasonable period of time.  Each was kept in custody longer than 48 hours without a \njudicial determination of probable cause.  Defendant City of Houston failed to release each of the \nClass Members after 48 hours had passed without a judicial determination of probable cause.  \nThe answer to whether the City maintains an unlawful policy of detaining warrantless arrestees \nfor an unreasonable period, including for longer than 48 hours, in the absence of a judicial \ndetermination of probable cause will determine the claims of the named Plaintiffs and every \nother Class Member. \n41.  If  the  named  Plaintiffs  succeed  in  their  claims  that  the  Cityโs  policies  and \npractices concerning warrantless arrestees violate their rights, that ruling will likewise benefit \nevery other member of the Class.   \nD.  Adequacy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).   \n42.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  adequate  representatives  of  the  Class  because  their \ninterest in the vindication of the legal claims that they raise is entirely aligned with the interests \nof the other Class Members, each of whom has the same basic constitutional and statutory \nclaims.  The named Plaintiffs are members of the Class, and there are no known conflicts of \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 10 of 14\n \ninterest among the members of the Class, all of whom have a similar interest in vindicating their \nconstitutional rights in the face of Defendantโs policy. \n43.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Civil Rights Corps, the Texas Fair \nDefense Project, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, who have experience in litigating complex civil \nrights matters in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the details of Defendantโs \nscheme and the relevant constitutional and statutory law.  Counsel from Civil Rights Corps has \nbeen  lead  counsel  in  well  over  a  dozen  major  federal  class  actions  challenging  the \nconstitutionality of post-arrest systems in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, \nTexas, and other states. \n44.  Class counsel have conducted an investigation into the City of Houstonโs policy \nof detaining arrestees for longer than 48 hours without a judicial determination of probable cause \nand the near constant overcrowding in Harris County Jail.  This investigation has included \ninterviews with witnesses, city officials and employees, inmates, attorneys practicing in courts \nthroughout the region, community members, and national experts in constitutional law, post-\narrest procedure, law enforcement, judicial procedures, criminal law, pretrial services, and jails. \n45.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of state law and practices as they \nrelate to federal constitutional requirements.  Counsel have studied the way that these systems \nfunction in other cities and counties in order to investigate the wide array of lawful options \navailable to municipalities who seek to comply with the Constitution. \n46.  As a result, counsel have devoted significant time and resources to becoming \nintimately familiar with the Cityโs scheme and with the relevant state and federal laws and \nprocedures that can and should govern it.  The interests of the Class Members will be fairly and \nadequately protected by the Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 11 of 14\n \nE.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n47.  Class treatment under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate because common questions of \nlaw and fact overwhelmingly predominate over individual ones and a class action is the only \npracticable wayโand, therefore, the superior wayโof resolving this case.  This case turns, for \nevery Class Member, on what the Cityโs policies and practices were and whether those policies \nwere lawful. \n48.  The common questions of law and fact listed above are dispositive questions in \nthe case of every Class Member.  The question of liability can therefore be determined on a \nclass-wide basis.  Class-wide treatment of liability is a far superior method of determining the \ncontent and legality of the Cityโs policies and practices than individual suits by hundreds or \nthousands of arrestees.  \n49.  The question of damages will also be driven by class-wide determinations of \ncommon questions, such as the policies, practices, and conditions at the Houston Jail. To the \nextent that individual damages will vary, they will vary depending in large part on the amount of \ntime the individual was unlawfully jailed.  Determining damages for individual Class Members \ncan be handled in a ministerial fashion based on easily verifiable records of the length of \nunlawful incarceration.  If need be, damages sub-classes can be formed, and individual damages \nhearings based on special circumstances can be held, after class-wide liability is determinedโa \nmethod far more efficient than litigating hundreds or thousands of individual lawsuits on the \nmerits. \nVII.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One:  Defendant Violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights by Failing to Release Them When They Did Not \nReceive A Timely Judicial Determination of Probable Cause \n50.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-49. \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 12/05/16   Page 12 of 14\n \n51.  The Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable \ncause after a warrantless arrest.  Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991); Gerstein v. \nPugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975).  This constitutional provision is presumptively violated after 48 \nhours absent extraordinary circumstances, which are not present here.6  Defendant violated \nPlaintiffsโ  rights  by  failing  to  release  them  after  it  failed  to  provide  a  prompt  judicial \ndetermination of probable cause. \nCount Two:  Defendant Falsely Imprisoned Plaintiffs by Failing to \nRelease  Them  When  They  Did  Not  Receive  A  Timely  Judicial \nDetermination of Probable Cause as Required by Texas State Law  \n52.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-51.   \n53.  The City of Houston may not detain someone without the personโs consent and \nwithout a legal basis for the detention.  Houston falsely imprisoned the named Plaintiffs when it \ndetained them in jail without a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.  That detention \nwas unlawful under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nand Articles 14.06(a), 15.17(a), and 17.033 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, which \nrequire the City to bring warrantless arrestees before a neutral magistrate within 48 hours.  \nVIII.  REQUESTS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the named Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of others \nsimilarly situated, request that this Court issue the following relief: \na.  A judgment compensating named Plaintiffs and the Class Members for the damages \nthey suffered as a result of Defendantโs unconstitutional and unlawful conduct. \nb.  An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 18 U.S.C. ยง 1964, and any other relief this Court deems just \nand proper. \n                                                 \n6  See, e.g., Waganfeald v.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Houston police make hundreds of warrantless arrests every week.  The Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Texas state law require that anyone arrested \nwithout  a  warrant  be  released  promptlyโafter  48  hours  at  the  longestโunless  a  neutral \nmagistrate has concluded that there was probable cause for her arrest and continued detention.  \nHouston has a policy and practice of disregarding this simple obligation.  Whenever the Harris \nCounty Jail (where Houston sends warrantless arrestees for probable cause hearings) refuses to \naccept  custody  of  an  arrestee,  or  whenever  Houstonโs  own  arrest  procedures  are  delayed, \nHouston continues to detain arrestees in its jail cells without a neutral finding of probable cause \nrather than release them after 48 hours as the Constitution requires.  Publicly available arrest \nrecords and booking data show that in 2015 and 2016, the City detained thousands of individuals \nbeyond  the  constitutionally  permissible  time  without  ensuring  that  they  received  prompt \nprobable cause hearings. \n \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 2 of 24\nII.  NATURE OF THE ACTION1 \n2.  The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.  \nMisdemeanor and felony arrestees in City custody who do not post bail are eventually transferred \nto the Harris County Jail, where they receive probable cause hearings conducted by video.  As a \nmatter  of  policy  and  practice,  the  City  of  Houston  does  not  provide  probable  cause \ndeterminations  for  warrantless  arrestees  in  its  custody.    Probable  cause  determinations  are \nprovided only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail.  When it takes \nlonger than 48 hours to transfer an arrestee to Harris Countyโand it often doesโHouston, as a \nmatter of policy and practice, continues to detain the arrestee unlawfully, rather than release him \nas the Fourth Amendment requires.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, seek compensatory damages for Houstonโs policy of detaining warrantless arrestees in \nviolation of the United States Constitution and state law. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n4.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \n5.  This  Court  has  supplemental  jurisdiction  over  the  state  law  causes  of  action \nasserted in this Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 because the state law claims form part of \nthe same case or controversy as the federal law claim. \nIV.  PARTIES \n6.  Named Plaintiff Juan Hernandez is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n                                                 \n1  Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they had \npersonal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 3 of 24\n7.  Named Plaintiff DeQuan Kirkwood is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n8.  Named Plaintiff Manuel Trevino is a resident of Katy, Texas. \n9.  Named Plaintiff Kent Wheatfall is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n10.  Defendant City of Houston is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of \nthe State of Texas.  It is the most populous city in Texas and is located in Harris County, the \nmost populous county in the state.  The City of Houston operates the Houston Police Department \n(โHPDโ) and the City of Houston Jail (โHouston Jailโ).   \nV.  THE  CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  RIGHT  TO  A  PROMPT \nPROBABLE CAUSE HEARING  \n11.  The Fourth Amendment โrequires a prompt judicial determination of probable \ncause as a prerequisite to an extended pretrial detention following a warrantless arrest.โ Cty. of \nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 47 (1991). โ[A]s a general matter,โ the Supreme Court \nhas explained, โjudicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will . . . \ncomplyโ with the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 56.  The United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit has similarly explained that probable cause determinations made โ[b]eyond 48 \nhoursโ after arrestโ can be justified only by โthe existence of a bona fide emergency or other \nextraordinary circumstance.โ  Brown v. Sudduth, 675 F.3d 472, 477 (5th Cir. 2012). \n12.  The right to a probable cause determination within at most 48 hours of arrest is \nnot only enshrined in the United States Constitution; it is also guaranteed by numerous other \nstate and local rules.  For example, the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires that โthe \nperson making the arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall without \nunnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the person is arrested, take the person \narrested or have him taken before some magistrate of the county where the accused was arrested \nor, to provide more expeditiously to the person arrested . . . before a magistrate in any other \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 4 of 24\ncounty of this state.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยงยง 14.06(a), 15.17(a).  It is the arresting authorityโs \nduty to ensure that a warrantless arrestee receives a probable cause hearing before a magistrate \nwithin 48 hours.   \n13.  In the event that a prompt probable cause hearing has not been provided, Texas \nstate law mandates the release of the arrestee, stating, โa person who is arrested without a \nwarrant and who is detained in jail must be released . . . not later than the 48th hour after the \npersonโs arrest if the person was arrested for a felony and a magistrate has not determined \nwhether probable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense.โ  Tex. Code \nCrim. Proc. ยง 17.033(b). \n14.  With respect to persons arrested for misdemeanors in counties that have over 3 \nmillion  residentsโHarris  County  has  approximately  4.1  million  residentsโTexas  state  law \nimposes an even stricter requirement, providing that โa person . . . arrested without a warrant and \nwho is detained in jail must be released . . . not later than the 36th hour after the personโs arrest \nif the person was arrested for a misdemeanor and a magistrate has not determined whether \nprobable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยง \n17.033(a-1). \n15.  The  Rules  of  the  Harris  County  Criminal  Courts  also  require  the  arresting \nauthority  to  ensure  a  neutral  probable  cause  determination  within  48  hours  of  arrest.    In \nparticular, they obligate โ[t]he arresting officer, or the person having custody of the arrestee, [to] \nensure that every arrestee . . . be brought before a judicial officer without unnecessary delay, but \nnot later than 48 hours after the person is arrested.โ  Harris Cnty. Crim. Ct. Rule 24.2.1 (2017). \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 5 of 24\n16.  The Harris County local rules expressly permit probable cause hearings to occur \nremotely, using โhigh-speed, two-way audio/video transmission technology.โ  Harris Cnty. Crim. \nCt. Rule 4.2.1 (2017). \n17.  In addition to the numerous state and local provisions requiring a prompt probable \ncause hearing, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas has previously \nenjoined  the  City  of  Houston  to  ensure  that  arrestees  receive  prompt  probable  cause \ndeterminations.  This Court, after a trial in 1982, found that Houstonโs policy of โdetain[ing] \narrestees on โinvestigative holdsโ violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution . . . and Articles 14.06 and 15.17 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.โ  \nSanders v. City of Houston, 543 F. Supp. 694, 696 (S.D. Tex. 1982), affโd 741 F.2d 1379 (5th \nCir. 1984).  To remedy the City of Houstonโs constitutional and state-law violations, this Court \nโpermanently enjoinedโ the โCity of Houston, its agents and employees . . . from detaining \nanyone arrested without a warrant for a period of more than twenty-four (24) hours without \ntaking the person before a judicial officer for a determination of probable causeโ and further \nordered โthat routinely every effort should be made to effect such procedures within a lesser \nperiod of time.โ  Id.  Twenty-five years later, it is clear thatโdespite this Courtโs orderโthe \nCity of Houston is not living up to its obligations to comply with the Fourth Amendment. \nVI.  THE CITY OF HOUSTONโS POLICIES AND PRACTICES CAUSE RAMPANT \nVIOLATIONS  OF  THE  RIGHT  TO  A  PROMPT  PROBABLE  CAUSE \nDETERMINATION BY A NEUTRAL MAGISTRATE \n18.  Approximately 80,000 people were arrested by the City of Houston in 2014 and \n2015; almost 90 percent of those people were arrested without a warrant.   \n19.  As a matter of policy and practice, the City transfers felony and misdemeanor \narrestees to the Harris County Jail for booking if they are unable to immediately pay a money \nbail amount set by a predetermined schedule.  Harris County then assembles groups of arrestees \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 6 of 24\nto appear before a Harris County Hearing Officer for a probable cause hearing.  These hearings \noccur by video link: the arrestees remain in the Harris County Jail, and a hearing officer and an \nassistant  district  attorney  participate  from  a  room  in  the  courthouse.  These  probable  cause \nhearings are conducted many times per day, throughout the day, every day of the year.  The \nassistant district attorney reads the alleged facts supporting the charges against the arrestee, and \nthe hearing officer determines whether there was probable cause for the arrest.  Harris County \ndoes not combine the probable cause hearing with other pretrial proceedings or the appointment \nof counsel.   \n20.  As a matter of policy and practice, judicial determinations of probable cause for \nwarrantless arrests are not conducted while an individual is in the City of Houstonโs custody.  \nThey take place only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail. \n21.  Therefore, any individual arrested without a warrant who remains in the City of \nHoustonโs custody has not had a judicial determination of probable cause. \n22.  As a matter of policy, custom, or practice, the City does not release people who \ndo not pay bail, even if 48 hours or more have passed since their arrest.2   \n23.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Houston  Mayor  Sylvester  Turner  and  Chief  of \nPolice Art Acevedo have long been aware of this policy, custom, or practice, and through their \nawareness and inaction, have officially adopted and executed it on behalf of the city.  Former \nMayor Annise Parker (2010โ2016) and Former Chiefs of Police Charles McClelland (2010โ\nFebruary  2016)  and  Martha  Montalvo  (FebruaryโDecember  2016)  were  also  aware  of  this \npolicy, custom, or practice, and adopted and executed it as well. \n                                                 \n2  Houston releases all arrestees who can pay predetermined financial conditions of release immediately.  It keeps \nin detention only those who are unable to afford release.  At no point do City officials conduct any inquiry into \nwhether arrestees have the ability to pay the predetermined amount of money required for release.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 7 of 24\n24.  The Harris County Jail is notoriously overcrowded.3  Both the Houston Chronicle \nand the Houston Press reported that the County has experienced extreme overcrowding since at \nleast 2007, when โovercrowding prompted then-Sheriff Tommy Thomas to ship more than 600 \ninmates to lock-ups in Louisiana.โ Two years later, in 2009, โthen-Sheriff Adrian Garcia sent \nbuses of inmates to facilities in Texas and Louisiana due to the overcrowding.โ Those transfers \nโcontinued through 2012,โ and spiked again in 2015, when the jail found itself at โ95 percent of \nits 9,400-bed capacity.โ4  \n25.  The  overcrowding  continued  through  2016.    In  July  and  August  2016,  the \nsituation was so dire that Harris County told HPD to stop transferring inmates to the County Jail, \nand refused to accept busloads of inmates from the Houston Jail.  As a spokesman for Harris \nCounty explained, โ[w]e couldnโt keep up with the rate of people we had coming here.โ  There \nwas, as he put it, โ[n]o room at the inn โ thatโs literally the phrase that we use.โ  The Harris \nCounty spokesman also stated that, due to the overcrowding and other issues causing delay, at \n                                                 \n3  See, e.g., Michael Barajas, Why the Harris County Jail is Overcrowded with Legally Innocent People, Houston \nPress  (July  1,  2015),  available  at  http://www.houstonpress.com/news/why-the-harris-county-jail-is-\novercrowded-with-legally-innocent-people-7555627;  St.  John  Barned-Smith,  Inmates  transferred,  jails \novercrowded,  Houston  Chronicle  (Apr.  17,  2016),  available  at \nhttp://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Inmates-transferred-jails-overcrowded-\n7251977.php; Meagan Flynn, Nearly 200 People Have Died in Harris County Sheriffโs Office Custody in 10 \nYears, Houston Press (Aug. 1, 2016), available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/nearly-200-people-have-\ndied-in-harris-county-sheriffs-office-custody-in-10-years-8616676; Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got \nSo  Crowded  the  Sheriff  Delayed  Inmate  Transfers,  Houston  Press    (September  8,  2016),   available  at \nhttp://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-the-sheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-\n8745391; Meagan Flynn, Harris County Sheriff May Hand Over 17-Year-Olds to Private Prison Contractor, \nHouston Press (Sept. 29, 2016), available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/harris-county-sheriff-may-\nhand-over-17-year-olds-to-private-prison-contractor-8812196. \n4  St. John Barned-Smith, Inmates transferred, jails overcrowded, Houston Chronicle (Apr. 17, 2016); Michael \nBarajas, Why the Harris County Jail is Overcrowded with Legally Innocent People, Houston Press (July 1, \n2015). \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 8 of 24\none point, the average time for inmates to be transferred from the Houston Police Department \nJail to the Harris County Jail was โ36 to 72 hours.โ5 \n26.  In  November  2016,  the  Houston  Chronicle  reported  that  as  a  result  of  the \npersistent overcrowding, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards approved a request from \nHarris County โto let nearly 200 inmates sleep on plastic cots on the floorโ while โwarning that \nthe county needs to think ahead about how to reduce its inmate population before its over-\ncrowded jail system worsens.โ  The Houston Chronicle went on to explain that โHarris County \nSheriff Ron Hickman said additional beds are needed because the jail population has ballooned \nfrom 8,500 inmates daily to 9,400 last month.โ Throughout this period, Harris County continued \nto send hundreds of detainees to other county jails and to refuse transfers from the Houston Jail.6   \n27.  The City of Houston and its chief policymakers, including the Mayor and Chief of \nPolice at all times relevant to this class action, have long been aware of these delays and the \nconstitutional violations that result. \n28.  In  fact,  Mayor  Sylvester  Turner  himself  has  publicly  acknowledged  the \nsignificant overcrowding at the Harris County Jail.  A report published by Mayor Turner in \nMarch 2016 stated that โthe Harris County Jail is woefully overcrowded,โ and that โHarris \nCounty is notorious for needlessly jailing Houstonians pretrial.โ7 \n                                                 \n5  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston Press \n(Sept.  8,  2016),  available  at  http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-the-\nsheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391. \n6  Andrea  Zelinski,  The  Houston  Chronicle,  Jail  commission  approves  COT  plan  request  (Nov.  4,  2016), \navailable  at  http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Jail-commission-OKs-county-\nrequest-for-temporary-10592050.php. \n7  Mayor  Sylvester  Turner,  Transition  Committee  on  Criminal  Justice  (Mar.  1,  2016),  available  at \nhttps://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/transitionreports/criminal_justice.pdf. \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 9 of 24\n29.  Even though the City of Houston and its key policymakers know that the Harris \nCounty Jail is over capacity, the HPD still waits to transfer warrantless arrestees to the Harris \nCounty Jail for probable cause hearings, rather than release them after 48 hours, or bring them to \na different county for a prompt hearing. \n30.  Due  to  the  ongoing  issues  in  Harris  County,  the  City  of  Houston  and  its \npolicymakers are also aware that a transfer to Harris County slightly before the 48-hour mark is \nunlikely  to  result  in  a  timely  probable  cause  hearing.  But  they  detain  people  in  these \ncircumstances nonetheless, despite knowing of the constitutional and statutory violations that \nresult. \n31.  Furthermore,  the  City  of  Houston  remains  under  a  federal-court  injunction \nrequiring it to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a \nneutral determination of probable cause. The City and its chief policymakers are, therefore, on \nnotice that there is a problem with their pre-trial detention system as a matter of law, and act with \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  Plaintiffsโ  constitutional  rights  by  allowing  these  unlawful \ndetentions to continue.  \n32.  This policy, custom, or practiceโwhich has remained unchanged despite the \ninjunctionโhas the inevitable and foreseeable result that numerous individuals arrested by the \nHPD without a warrant are denied their constitutional and statutory right to a prompt probable \ncause hearing. \n33.  Plaintiffsโ analysis of the Countyโs public booking records shows that between \nJanuary 1, 2016, and July 15, 2016, over 1,400 arrestees were held in Houstonโs City Jail for \nover 72 hours, and thousands more were held for over 48 hours.  The Houston Press reported that \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 10 of 24\nin July and August 2016, over 1,000 inmates waited over 72 hours before being transferred to \nHarris County in those two months alone.8     \n34.  Approximately 90% of arrests in Houston are made without warrants.  Harris \nCountyโs  publicly  available  data,  therefore,  indicates  that  hundreds,  if  not  thousands,  of \nindividuals were held unlawfully in 2015 and 2016, and denied their right to a neutral and \nprompt determination of probable cause. \n35.  The large number of illegal detentions in 2015 and 2016 reflects the City of \nHoustonโs broad, longstanding, and consistent policy of refusing to release warrantless arrestees \neven if more than 48 hours have passed since their warrantless arrest.  For example, booking \nrecords show that one person arrested on July 25, 2016, did not receive a probable cause \ndetermination until July 31, 2016 (more than 144 hours after arrest); another person, arrested on \nJuly 23, 2016, did not receive a probable cause determination until July 30, 2016 (more than 168 \nhours after arrest); and at least 35 other people in the months of July and August 2016 waited \nmore than four days (96 hours) between arrest and a probable cause determination.   \n36.  Nor has the City of Houston taken any other steps to ensure that individuals its \nPolice Department arrests without a warrant receive their constitutional and statutory right to a \nprompt probable cause hearing.  The City of Houston has authority, under the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure, to have arrestees taken โbefore a magistrate in any other county of this \nstateโ in order to ensure a prompt probable cause hearing.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยงยง \n14.06(a), 15.17(a).  According to the Texas Jail Project, there are 273 county jails in Texas.  \nMany are a short drive from the Harris County Jail, including the Montgomery County Jail in \n                                                 \n8  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston Press  \n(September 8, 2016),  available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-\nthe-sheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391. \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 11 of 24\nConroe, Texas (1 hour), the Walker County Jail in Huntsville, Texas (1.5 hours),  and the \nWashington County Jail in Brenham, Texas (1.5 hours). But, ignoring widespread deprivations \nof Fourth Amendment rights, the City of Houston does not utilize this provision and instead \ntransfers all of its warrantless arrestees to the Harris County Jail, exclusively. \n37.  Knowingly keeping arrestees beyond the constitutionally required time, or in the \nalternative transferring them to Harris County after a substantial delay with no expectation that \nthey will receive a prompt hearing, demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the arresteesโ \nconstitutional rights.   \n38.  Houstonโs policy, custom, or practice of continuing to detain arrestees after they \nhave failed to receive prompt probable cause determinations is the moving force and direct cause \nof  Plaintiffsโ  unreasonable  detentions,  and  is  the  moving  force  of  the  deprivation  of  their \nconstitutional rights. \n39.  This persistent and widespread practice in the City of Houston continues despite \nthe City of Houstonโs awareness that the obvious consequence of this practice is the systematic \ndenial of constitutional rights to individuals in its custody. Specifically, the Mayor and Chief of \nPolice,  at  all  relevant  times,  were  aware  of  the  policy,  custom  or  practice,  had  actual  or \nconstructive  knowledge  that  it  was  the  moving  force  behind  the  violation  of  numerous \nindividualsโ constitutional rights, and executed the policy, custom, or practice nonetheless.  \nDeQuan Kirkwood9 \n40.  On July 25, 2016, DeQuan Kirkwood drove to visit his probation officer.   \n41.  When he arrived, Houston police officers arrested Mr. Kirkwood for evading \narrest with a vehicle.  \n                                                 \n9     Mr. Kirkwoodโs first name is misspelled as โDeJuanโ in some of his records. \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 12 of 24\n42.  Mr.  Kirkwoodโs  arrest  was  entered  into  the  City  of  Houstonโs  and  Harris \nCountyโs electronic records at 11:15 PM on July 25, 2016.  \n43.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on July 28, 2016, at 1:23 \nAM, more than 50 hours later, Mr. Kirkwood was transferred to Harris County custody.   \n44.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Kirkwood  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n45.  At  7:00  AM  on  July  28,  2016โmore  than  55  hours  after  his  arrestโMr. \nKirkwood appeared for his probable cause hearing.  \n46.  The judge found there was no probable cause for Mr. Kirkwoodโs arrest and \ncontinued detention. Mr. Kirkwood was promptly released.  \nManuel Trevino \n47.  On  July  27,  2016,  Manuel  Trevino  was  visiting  a  friendโs  house  when  the \nHouston Police arrived and searched the house without a warrant.  The police found narcotics in \nthe home, and arrested Mr. Trevino along with others in the house. \n48.  Mr. Trevinoโs arrest was entered into the City of Houstonโs and Harris Countyโs \nelectronic records at 1:55 PM on July 27, 2016.    \n49.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on July 30, 2016, at \n10:42 PM, Mr. Trevino was booked into Harris County custody.  He had been detained in \nHouston custody for almost 81 hours without receiving a probable cause hearing. \n50.  According to the Cityโs arrest data, Mr. Trevino was released from the Cityโs \ncustody on July 30, 2016, at 9:39 PM, almost 80 hours after his arrest.  \n51.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Trevino  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 13 of 24\n52.  On July 31, 2016, at 10:00 PM, a judge found probable cause for his arrest and \ncontinued detentionโalmost 104 hours after his arrest.   \n53.  On  October  28,  2016,  Mr.  Trevino  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  deferred \nadjudication. He was not sentenced to any jail time, and his sentence was not credited with any \ntime he spent in pre-trial custody.  \nKent Wheatfall \n54.  Kent Wheatfall is a retired U.S. Postal Service worker.   \n55.  On January 7, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was arrested for aggravated assault.  Mr. \nWheatfallโs arrest was entered into the City of Houstonโs and Harris Countyโs electronic records \nat 10:30 PM on January 7, 2016. \n56.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on January 10, 2016, at \n1:52 AM, Mr. Wheatfall was booked into Harris County custody. He had been in Houston \ncustody for more than 51 hours.  At 4:00 AM that dayโmore than 53 hours after his arrestโMr. \nWheatfall received a probable cause hearing, where a judge found probable cause for his arrest \nand continued detention. \n57.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Wheatfall  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n58.  On February 4, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was released on bond.  He was indicted on \nFebruary 18, 2016.  \n59.  On May 17, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was rearrested, and could not post bond.  He \nwas held until he pleaded guilty and received a deferred adjudication on February 10, 2017.  He \nwas not sentenced to any jail time, and his sentence was not credited with any time he spent in \npre-trial custody. \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 14 of 24\nJuan Hernandez \n60.  On January 7, 2016, at about 4:30 PM, Houston police officers arrested Juan \nHernandez, without a warrant, for misdemeanor assault.  \n61.  Mr.  Hernandezโs  arrest  was  entered  into  the  City  of  Houstonโs  and  Harris \nCountyโs electronic records at 4:53 PM on January 7, 2016. \n62.  When Mr. Hernandez was brought to the Houston City Jail, a jail employee there \ntold him that the Harris County Jail was full and that his transfer to Harris County would be \ndelayed.  She told Mr. Hernandez to โbe patient.โ  \n63.  Later on, Mr. Hernandez saw a Houston City Jail employee that he knew. The \nemployee said: โYou still here? You shouldโve been gone by now.โ  \n64.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on January 10, 2016, at \n12:49 AM, Mr. Hernandez was booked into County custody without having received a probable \ncause hearingโalmost 56 hours after his arrest. \n65.  Mr. Hernandez remembers being held for three days in the Houston City jail. \n66.  Harris Countyโs records reflect that Mr. Hernandez received a probable cause \nhearing before a judge on January 9, 2016, at 6:00 PMโmore than 49 hours after his arrest.  \n67.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Hernandez  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n68.  Five days after his hearingโafter a week in custodyโMr. Hernandez pleaded \nguilty.  He was released and given community supervision without jail time.   \nVII.  CLASS ACTION \n69.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action, on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common \nbasis. \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 15 of 24\n70.  A class action is a superior means, and the only practicable means, by which the \nnamed Plaintiffs and unknown Class Members can challenge the Cityโs unlawful detention \npolicy. \n71.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant \nto Rule 23(a)(1)โ(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n72.  This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  adequacy, \npredominance, and superiority requirements of those provisions. \n73.  The named Plaintiffs propose a single Class seeking compensatory relief.  The \nClass is defined as: All persons who were arrested without a warrant by the City of Houston, and \nnot provided a prompt judicial determination of probable causeโ48 hours at the longestโat any \ntime between December 6, 2014 (two years before the filing of this Complaint) and the date of \nthe order granting class certification.10  \nA.  Numerosity. Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n74.  The individuals in the class are so numerous that joinder of all members would be \nimpractical. \n75.  Harris Countyโs public booking records shows that between January 1, 2016, and \nJuly 15, 2016, over 1,400 arrestees were held in Houstonโs City Jail for over 72 hours, and that \nthousands more were held over 48 hours.  The Houston Press separately concluded that in July \n                                                 \n10  The statute of limitations for both claims is two years. Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th \nCir. 2001).  Plaintiffs reserve the right to argue that under the circumstances of this case, detaining warrantless \narrestees for periods less than 48 hours may be unreasonable.  See Sanders, 543 F. Supp. at 705 (issuing a \npermanent injunction against the City of Houston enjoining it from detaining warrantless arrestees for more \nthan 24 hours without a proper determination of probable cause); see also Lockett v. State, No. 06-05-00138-\nCR, 2006 WL 940648 at *1 (Tex. App. Apr. 13, 2006) (โthe Houston police department operates under a \npermanent injunction preventing it from detaining persons arrested without a warrant for more than twenty-four \nhours without taking the person before a magistrate.โ).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 16 of 24\nand August 2016 alone, over 1,000 inmates waited more than 72 hours before being transferred \nto Harris County.11   \n76.  Publicly available data show that violations occurred throughout 2016 and have \nnot abated. Thousands of arrestees were likely subjected to this policy during the class period.  \nBecause  joinder  of  thousands  of  plaintiffs  would  be  impracticable,  this  case  satisfies  the \nnumerosity requirement. \nB.  Commonality. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n77.  The relief sought is common to all Class Members, and common questions of law \nand fact exist as to all Class Members.  The named Plaintiffs seek relief concerning whether the \nCity of Houstonโs policies, practices, and procedures violated the rights of the Class Members. \n78.  Common legal and factual questions arise from one central scheme: the Cityโs \npolicy of detaining warrantless arrestees, even beyond 48 hours, when there has not been a \nprobable cause determination by a neutral magistrate.  The City of Houston has operated this \npolicy  openly  and in materially the same manner every day during the class period.  The \nresolution of these legal and factual issues will determine whether all of the Class Members are \nentitled to the relief that they seek. \n79.  There are questions of law and fact common to all Class Members.  Among these \ncommon questions are: \na.  Whether  it  violates  the  United  States  Constitution  to  detain  warrantless \narrestees for unreasonable periods of time, including in excess of 48 hours, \nwithout a judicial determination of probable cause for the detention; \n                                                 \n11  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston Press  \n(September 8, 2016),  available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-\nthe-sheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391. \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 17 of 24\nb.  Whether it violates state law to detain warrantless arrestees for unreasonable \nperiods  of  time,  including  in  excess  of  48  hours,  without  a  judicial \ndetermination of probable cause for the detention;  \nc.  Whether the City of Houston maintained a policy, custom, or widespread \npractice of detaining warrantless arrestees for unreasonable periods of time, \nincluding routinely in excess of 48 hours, without a judicial determination of \nprobable cause for the detention. \nC.  Typicality.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)  \n80.  The named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the other Class Members, \nand the named Plaintiffs have the same interests in this case as all other Class Members.  Each \nClass Member was arrested without a warrant and did not receive a probable cause hearing \nwithin  a  reasonable  period  of  time.    Each  waited  longer  than  48  hours  without  a  judicial \ndetermination of probable cause.  Defendant City of Houston denied each Plaintiff a prompt \njudicial determination of probable cause.  The answer to whether the City of Houston maintains \nan unlawful policy of detaining warrantless arrestees for an unreasonable period, including for \nlonger than 48 hours, in the absence of a judicial determination of probable cause will determine \nthe claims of the named Plaintiffs and every other Class Member. \n81.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in their claims that the City of Houstonโs policies \nand  practices  concerning  warrantless  arrestees  violate  their  rights,  that  ruling  will  likewise \nbenefit every other member of the Class.   \nD.  Adequacy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4)  \n82.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  adequate  representatives  of  the  Class  because  their \ninterest in the vindication of the legal claims that they raise is entirely aligned with the interests \nof the other Class Members, each of whom has the same basic constitutional and statutory \nclaims.  The named Plaintiffs are members of the Class, and there are no known conflicts of \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 18 of 24\ninterest among the members of the Class, all of whom have a similar interest in vindicating their \nconstitutional and statutory rights in the face of Defendantโs policy. \n83.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Civil Rights Corps, the Texas Fair \nDefense Project, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, who have experience in litigating complex civil \nrights matters in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the details of Defendantโs \nscheme and the relevant constitutional and statutory law.  Counsel from Civil Rights Corps has \nbeen  lead  counsel  in  well  over  a  dozen  major  federal  class  actions  challenging  the \nconstitutionality of post-arrest systems in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, \nTexas, and other states. \n84.  Class counsel have conducted an investigation into the City of Houstonโs policy, \ncustom, or practice of detaining arrestees for unreasonable periods of time without a judicial \ndetermination of probable cause, and the near constant overcrowding in Harris County Jail.  This \ninvestigation has included interviews with witnesses, city officials and employees, inmates, \nattorneys practicing in courts throughout the region, community members, and national experts \nin constitutional law, post-arrest procedure, law enforcement, judicial procedures, criminal law, \npretrial services, and jails. \n85.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of state law and practices as they \nrelate to federal constitutional requirements.  Counsel have studied the way that these systems \nfunction in other cities and counties in order to investigate the wide array of lawful options \navailable to municipalities that seek to comply with the Constitution. \n86.  As a result, counsel have devoted significant time and resources to becoming \nintimately familiar with the Cityโs scheme and with the relevant state and federal laws and \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 19 of 24\nprocedures that can and should govern it.  The interests of the Class Members will be fairly and \nadequately protected by the Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n87.  Class treatment under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate because common questions of \nlaw and fact overwhelmingly predominate over individual ones and a class action is the only \npracticable wayโand, therefore, the superior wayโof resolving this case.  This case turns, for \nevery Class Member, on what the Cityโs policies, customs, or practices were and whether those \npolicies, customs, or practices were lawful. \n88.  The common questions of law and fact listed above are dispositive questions in \nthe case of every Class Member.  The question of liability can therefore be determined on a \nclass-wide basis.  Class-wide treatment of liability is a far superior method of determining the \ncontent and legality of the Cityโs policies and practices than individual suits by hundreds or \nthousands of arrestees.  \n89.  The question of damages will also be driven by class-wide determinations of \ncommon questions, such as the policies, practices, and conditions at the Houston Jail. To the \nextent that individual damages will vary, they will vary depending in large part on the amount of \ntime the individual was unlawfully jailed.  Determining damages for individual Class Members \ncan be handled in a ministerial fashion based on easily verifiable records of the length of \nunlawful incarceration.  If need be, damages sub-classes can be formed, and individual damages \nhearings based on special circumstances can be held, after class-wide liability is determinedโa \nmethod far more efficient than litigating hundreds or thousands of individual lawsuits on the \nmerits. \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 20 of 24\nVIII.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One:  Defendant Violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights by Failing to Release Them When They Did Not \nReceive A Timely Judicial Determination of Probable Cause \n90.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1โ89. \n91.  The Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable \ncause after a warrantless arrest.  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 47; Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 \n(1975).    This  constitutional  provision  is  presumptively  violated  after  48  hours  absent \nextraordinary circumstances, which are not present here.12  Plaintiffs allege, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983, that Defendant violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by \nfailing to release them after it failed to ensure a prompt judicial determination of probable cause. \n92.  Defendantโs  policy,  custom,  or  practice  of  continuing  to  detain  individuals \narrested without a warrant even after they have not received a prompt probable cause hearing, \nrather than releasing them, is the moving force of the McLaughlin violations occurring in the \nCity of Houston Jail.   \n93.  This practice of the City is persistent and widespread, and is so common and well \nsettled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.  \n94.  Defendant and its chief policymakers, including the Mayor and Chief of Police at \nall relevant times, had actual or constructive knowledge of this policy, custom, or practice long \nenough to recognize and correct it.   \n95.  By doing nothing to correct an ongoing pattern of constitutional deprivations of \nwhich it is well aware and has been aware for years, Defendant and its policymakers, including \n                                                 \n12  See, e.g., Waganfeald v. Gusman, 674 F.3d 475, 482 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding that the detention of warrantless \narrestees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina fell within the emergency exception to McLaughlinโs 48-\nhour rule).  \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 21 of 24\nthe Mayor and Chief of Police at all relevant times, adopted and executed this policy, custom, or \npractice on behalf of the City. \n96.  This policy, custom, or practice continues with the express or implied authority of \nHoustonโs Mayor and Chief of Police.   \n97.  In allowing this widespread policy, custom, or practice to persist, Defendant has \ndemonstrated deliberate indifference to the ongoing and numerous constitutional violations that \nhave affected thousands of individuals in the class period alone. \nCount Two:  Defendant Violated Plaintiffsโ Rights Under Texas State \nLaw by Refusing to Release Them When They Did Not Receive A \nTimely Judicial Determination of Probable Cause   \n98.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1โ97.   \n99.  Texas state law requires that, where an individual is arrested without a warrant, \nโthe person making the arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall without \nunnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the person is arrested, take the person \narrested or have him taken before some magistrate of the county where the accused was arrested \nor, to provide more expeditiously to the person arrested . . . before a magistrate in any other \ncounty of this state.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยงยง 14.06(a), 15.17(a).  In the event that a prompt \nprobable cause hearing has not been provided, Texas state law mandates that โa person who is \narrested without a warrant and who is detained in jail must be released . . . not later than the 48th \nhour after the personโs arrest if the person was arrested for a felony and a magistrate has not \ndetermined whether probable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense.โ  \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. ยง 17.033(b). \n100.  With respect to persons arrested for misdemeanors in counties that have over 3 \nmillion  residents  (Harris  County  has  approximately  4.1  million  residents),  Texas  state  law \nrequires that warrantless arrestees โmust be released . . . not later than the 36th hour after the \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:16-cv-03577   Document 19   Filed on 03/01/17 in TXSD   Page 22 of 24\npersonโs arrestโ if a magistrate โhas not determined whether probable cause exists.โ  Tex. Code \nCrim. Proc. ยง 17.033(a-1). \n101.  The City of Houston unlawfully detained Plaintiffs under Texas State law when it \nfailed to release them as required by Articles 14.06(a), 15.17(a), and 17.033(a-1) and (b) of the \nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure.   \nIX.  REQUESTS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the named Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of others \nsimilarly situated, request that this Court issue the following relief: \na.  A judgment compensating named Plaintiffs and the Class Members for the damages \nthey suffered as a result of Defendantโs unconstitutional and unlawful conduct, in an \namount to be determined at trial; \nb.  An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 18 U.S.C. ยง 1964, and any other relief this Court deems just \nand proper; and \nc.

Bradley, Clerk\nHOUSTON DIVISION \n \nJUAN  HERNANDEZ, et al,  ยง  \n  ยง  \n              Plaintiffs,  ยง  \nVS.  ยง     CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:16-CV-3577 \n  ยง  \nCITY OF HOUSTON,  ยง  \n  ยง  \n              Defendant.  ยง  \n \nORDER AND FINDING ON SANCTIONS AND MOTIONS \n \nI. \nBefore  the  Court  are  the  plaintiffsโ  proposed  statement  of  undisputed  facts  and  the \ndefendantโs counter findings of fact and/or objections to the plaintiffโs proposed statement.  See \n[Des 76, 77 sealed].  The Court has examined the plaintiffsโ proposed findings, in light of their \nmotion  for  sanctions  and  determines  them  appropriate,  and  supported  by  the  record  of \nproceedings.  Therefore, the Court adopts the plaintiffsโ statement of finding, as modified, and \nrejects the Cityโs finding that are not incorporated. \nII. \nA.  The November 8, 2017 ESI Order \nOn November 8, 2017, this Court entered the agreed Stipulation and Order Concerning \nProduction of Electronically Stored Information, ECF Doc. No. 40 [hereinafter ESI Order], \nwhich was the product of four months of negotiations between the parties.  The ESI Order \nprescribed a specific process for handling discovery in this case and states that โ[t]he Parties \nshall conduct discovery in a cooperative manner, including . . . producing ESI in accordance \nwith Fed R. Civ. P. 34; and by meeting and conferring in good faith on  topics such as \nidentification  of  custodians  of  relevant  ESI,  potentially  relevant  data  sources,  search \n1 / 13 \n\nmethodologies, and such other issues as may arise during the course of discovery.โ   The ESI \nOrder further provides that โ[t]he parties shall apply agreed-upon search terms to custodian \nemail as a mechanism to cull the volume of data subject to manual attorney review.โ  The \npartiesโ agreed-upon search terms (henceforth the โESI Order Search Termsโ) were attached to \nthe ESI Order as Appendix B. \nIn addition to the agreed-upon search terms, the ESI Order imposed  a continuing \nobligation  on  the  parties  โto  disclose  additional  search  terms  if  manual  review  or  other \ninvestigation identifies words, abbreviations, or phrases that are necessary to gather records \nresponsive to document requests.โ The ESI Order also defined the scope  of discoverable \nsources of information, including โmainframe computers or local and network computers or \ndrives or servers or any other media or location where ESI can be or is stored.โ   \nFinally, the ESI Order designated specific custodiansโi.e., Houston Police Department \n(โHPDโ) officialsโwhose records the plaintiffs were seeking, attached to the ESI Order as \nAppendix A.   The thirteen custodians listed in Appendix A of the ESI Order were: Chief of \nPolice Art Acevedo, Executive Assistant Chief of Police George Buenik, Assistant Chief of \nPolice John Chen, Lieutenant Patrick Dougherty, Captain Paul Follis, Chief of Police Charles \nMcClelland, Chief of Police Martha Montalvo, Mayor Annise Parker, Captain Stephen Spears, \nMayor Sylvester Turner, Captain Colin Weatherly, Assistant Chief of Police Charles Vazquez, \nand Sergeant Amanda Zimmerman.  \n \n \n \n \n2 / 13 \n\nB.  The City Violated the ESI Order (November 2017 โ April 2018) \nWeeks after the Court entered an ESI Order, the City had still not supplemented the \nmissing metadata from an earlier production to bring the production into compliance with \nthe Courtโs Order.  Though counsel engaged in several meet and confers by phone, the Cityโs \ncounsel repeatedly requested an in-person meeting in Houston. \nOn  December  13,  2017,  during  an  in-person  meeting  in  Houston  at  which  the \nparties discussed the Cityโs technical issues relating to the production of arrest records, the \nCity represented that (i) it had not interviewed any of the custodians listed in the ESI Order, \n(ii) it had not collected documents from any of the custodians listed in the ESI Order and (iii) it \nhad โwipedโ the hard drives of six custodians listed in Appendix B of the ESI Order who were \nno longer employed by the City \nAt  that  meeting,  the plaintiffs  offered  to  provide  names  of  vendors  to  help  with \ndocument processing and review and offered to pay a substantial portion, if not all, of the costs \nthat might be incurred.  The City refused this offer and missed its December 15, 2017 deadline \nto certify document production was complete.   \nOn  January  24,  2018,  during  a  meet  and  confer,  the  City  represented  that  it  had \ncollected 72,000 documents from the HPD database, but had yet to review them, despite the \npassage  of  the  December  15,  2017  deadline  for  the  completion  of  document  discovery. \nBetween January 24, 2018 and February 28, 2018, when the plaintiffs moved this Court to \ncompel the Cityโs production of documents, the Cityโs only production of documents consisted \nof 126 files from the Mayorโs office on February 2, 2018.  Each of the 126 documents was \nunresponsive to the plaintiffsโ document requests. \n3 / 13 \n\nDuring the April 3, 2018 hearing on the plaintiffsโ Motion to Compel, the City claimed it \nhad collected 2.6 million documents by running โword searches based on the ESI Protocol,โ Ex. \nA at 22:9-15, and it would take 17,000 hours to review all of those documents. During the April 3 \nhearing, the City stated on numerous occasions that it had gathered documents based on \nthe plaintiffsโ request.  When this statement was disputed, the City said it could provide \nthe search parameters that were run, but stated that the protocol was the same ones that are in the \nESI protocol.  Based  on  these  representations,  the plaintiffs  agreed  at  the  hearing  to  \nprovide  a narrower set of search terms that would encompass only those documents related to \nRFPs 1โ4, 8 and 9, and agreed to run the narrowed search terms as the plaintiffs requested.  \nC.  The April 10, 2018 Order \nThe Courtโs April 10, 2018 Order compelled the City to โproduce all non-privileged \ndocuments responsive to the plaintiffsโ requests for production nos. 1-4, 8 and 9 in accordance \nwith the Courtโs November 8, 2017, ESI Order.โ   \nThe Court further notified the City that \n[f]ailure to comply with this Order will result in sanctions, \nincluding but not limited to monetary sanctions and an adverse \ninference  instruction  to  a  jury  that  any  hard  drives  not \nproduced of former Chief of Police Charles McLelland, Chief \nof Police Martha Montalvo, Executive Assistant Chief George \nT. Buenik, Lieutenant Patrick Dougherty, Assistant Chief John \nChen, and Assistant Chief Charles Vazquez, were intentionally \ndestroyed  and  contained  documents  and  communications \nestablishing that: (a) throughout the class period, the City of \nHouston  had  a  policy  and/or  practice  of  not  releasing \nwarrantless  arrestees  who  had  not  received  neutral \ndeterminations of probable cause within the constitutionally \nrequired  period  of  time;  (b)  throughout  the  class  period, \npolicymakers were aware of this policy and/or practice; and \n(c) although aware of the policy and/or practice took no action \nto correct the unconstitutional conduct through fully aware that \nsuch  inaction  would continue an unconstitutional policy of \ndeliberate indifference to a known constitutional violation. \n \n4 / 13 \n\nId. at 1โ2. \nThe following day, on April 11, 2018, the plaintiffs provided the City with their list of \nnarrowed search terms (โPlaintiffsโ April 2018 Search Termsโ). These search terms were identical \nto the ESI Order Search Terms except that four of the search terms were removed.  The April \n2018 Search Terms contained 55 individual terms.  The Martinez Affidavit attests that when the \nCity ran the ESI Order Search Terms, it retrieved 78,702 documents from the Cityโs databases.  \nWhen the City applied the plaintiffsโ April 2018 Search Terms, it retrieved 48,976 documents.  \nInstead of reviewing this set of documents, the City then asked HPD members to identify their \nown search terms.   \nAs support for the Cityโs Response to the plaintiffsโ motion to enforce the April 10, \n2018 Order, the City provided an affidavit from Joe Martinez, a systems support analyst at the City \nof Houstonโs Legal Department. ECF Doc. No. 62-1. The Martinez Affidavit attests that the City \napplied the HPD membersโ proposed search terms: the so-called โHPD Terms of Art,โ which \nconsisted of 13 additional terms that were not disclosed to the plaintiffs until the filing of the \nCityโs response on June 8, 2018.   \nThe 13 โHPD Terms of Artโ were as follows: โholds,โ โ48 hours,โ โafis,โ โdrags,โ โdaily \nstats,โ โcounty rejects,โ โcancelled drags,โ โdaily shift population,โ โcounty transfer se,โ โcounty \ntransfer central,โ โshift 2 count,โ โshift 1 count,โ and โshift 3 count.โ  The 13 โHPD Terms of \nArtโ retrieved 9,992 documents.  It was these 9,992 documents that the City reviewed one by one \nfor responsiveness.  The  City  later  admitted  it  never  reviewed  the  remaining  approximately \n39,000 documents retrieved by the plaintiffsโ April 11, 2018 Search Terms.   \nThe Cityโs production of all relevant documents responsive to RFPs 1โ4, 8 and 9 was \ndue April 30, 2018.  On April 30, 2018, the plaintiffs received the Cityโs production, containing \n5 / 13 \n\nsome 368 responsive documents.  The  City  admitted  that  it  only  produced  368  responsive \ndocuments in response to the April 10, 2018 Order.   \nNone of the 368 documents produced on April 30, 2018 contained documents from the \ndisputed hard drives.  Moreover, the April 30, 2018 production did contain several documents \nfrom Lieutenant Patrick Doughertyโs โthumb driveโโa removable drive.   It is unclear whether \nany of these documents originated from his computer hard drive.  Each  of  the  documents \nproduced on April 30, 2018, and the vast majority of the documents the City has produced to \ndate, are missing crucial metadata that the City is required to provide under the ESI Order.   \nThe plaintiffs requested a meet and confer on May 16, 2018.  During that May 16, 2018 \nmeet and confer, the City admitted that it had not actually reviewed all of the documents retrieved \nby the plaintiffsโ April 2018 Search Terms. Rather, the City represented to the plaintiffs that it \nhad applied a different set of search termsโwhich it did not disclose to the plaintiffs during that \ncallโin order to ease its production burden.   \nUpon questioning from the Court at the June 13, 2018 hearing, the City admitted that it \nhad agreed to apply the ESI Order Search Terms, as narrowed by the plaintiffsโ April 2018 \nSearch  Terms.    Nonetheless,  the  City  admitted  that  it  had  applied  its  own  search  terms \ninsteadโ the 13 โHPD Terms of Artโ mentioned in the Martinez Affidavitโto unilaterally \nnarrow the scope of their document collection and review.  The  City  also admitted  that  it  \napplied  the  new  search  terms  on  its  own,  without conferring with the Court and without \nproposing a change in the terms to the plaintiffs or informing the plaintiffs of the new terms.  \nThe Cityโs admission that it unilaterally changed the search terms constitutes a violation of the \nESI Order. \n \n6 / 13 \n\nE.  The City Intentionally Destroyed Evidence \nOn December 13, 2017, during an in-person meeting in Houston to discuss the Cityโs \ntechnical issues relating to the production of arrest records, the City represented that it had wiped \nthe hard drives of several custodians listed in Appendix B of the ESI Order, who were no longer \nemployed by the City.  On  December  14,  2017,  the plaintiffs  asked  the  City  to  identify \nโwhich custodians [listed in the ESI Order] are no longer employed by the City.  On December \n18, 2017, the Cityโs counsel, Connica Lemond, identified those six custodians as Chief of Police \nCharles McClelland, Chief of Police Martha Montalvo, Executive Assistant Chief George T. \nBuenik, Assistant Chief John Chen, Lieutenant Patrick Dougherty and Assistant Chief Charlie \nVazquez.  Those hard drives contained ESI that should have been preserved by the City as \nsoon as it anticipated litigation, and definitely after the instant lawsuit was filed.  The City \nacknowledged its โclear obligationโ to preserve all responsive documents after the litigation was \npending.  Yet the City failed to take reasonable steps to preserve the data on the hard drives and \nintentionally wiped the drives.  The Court determines that the  information  on  the  hard  drives  \ncannot  be  restored  or  replaced  through additional discovery. \nIn connection with its response to the plaintiffsโ motion to compel and for discovery \nsanctions, the City provided the affidavit of Gregory Banks, which detailed certain HPD document \npolicies (the โBanks Affidavitโ).  ECF Doc. No. 51-4.  The Banks Affidavit confirmed that HPD \nemployeesโ computer hard drives are โre-imaged and re-issued as necessaryโ when the employee \nleaves the department.  It also stated that documents saved to only a personal hard drive โonly \nresideโ on the personal hard drive.  The City admitted that any reimaging of hard drives โwould \nhave wiped out anythingโ from the time period relevant to this litigation.  The Court concludes \nthat litigation hold was not properly issued in this case. \n7 / 13 \n\nOn April 26, 2018, the City emailed the plaintiffsโ counsel saying that it was โsending a \ndisk containing everything to you by FedEx/USPS so that you can have everything in hand by \n4/30.โ  When the plaintiffs requested clarification on what the City meant by โeverythingโ and \nwhether that included documents from the hard drives, the City responded on April 27, 2018, \nsaying that โthe production we sent you does satisfy the requirement that the responsive, non-\nprivileged documents that would be on the hard drives of those individuals named in the judgeโs \norder. [sic]โ  \nThe City further represented that: \nNo  responsive  documents  were  found  on  the  hard  drives  of  the  chiefs. \nFurthermore, in an abundance of caution, we reached out to the chiefs to ensure \nthat we were looking at all of the areas that would have responsive documents. \nAfter speaking to each of the chiefs (as suggested by Judge Hoyt), it was clear \nthat they saved documents on the shared drives for HPD and not their individual \nhard drives. \n \nId. (emphasis added). \nIn response, the plaintiffsโ counsel requested โthe date and time of the conversations [the \nCityโs counsel] had with the former City officials in question, as well as the names of all \nindividuals who participated in those conversations.โ  The City returned with this  list  of  the \ncustodians and the dates and times of its conversations with each custodian: \n \n8 / 13 \n\nAt   the   June   13,   2018   hearing,   the   Court   noted   that   the   Cityโs   counselโs \nconversations with HPD officials, unsupported by sworn affidavits, were insufficient to establish \nthe absence of responsive documents on the wiped hard drives.  The Court determined that the \nCity has failed to comply with the Courtโs orders and directed the plaintiffsโ counsel to prepare \nproposed findings of fact and a proposed remedy.   \nF.  The City Made Misrepresentations to the Court About Its Flawed Discovery \nProcess \n   \n1.  The City represented that it needed to review 2.6 million documents \n  In the Cityโs Response to the plaintiffsโ motion to compel, the City claimed that the \nplaintiffsโ discovery requests were disproportionate to the needs of the case, representing that the \nCity had collected 2.6 million documents in response to the requests.  Again, during the April 3, \n2018 hearing on the plaintiffsโ motion to compel, the City claimed that it had collected 2.6 \nmillion documents by running โword searches based on the ESI Protocol,โ Ex. A at 22:9โ15, and \nthat it would take 17,000 hours to review these documents.   \nDuring  the  April  3,  2018  hearing,  the  City  stated  numerous  times  that  it  had \nโcollected based on what the plaintiffs told us to collect.โ  The plaintiffs noted their lack of \nvisibility into the Cityโs search process, see, e.g., id. at 39:19โ21 (โ[W]e really donโt understand \nthe 2.6 million number; but we do not expect from our experience that it should be that high.โ).  \nTo this remark, the Court suggested that the City was โcreating a problem and then . . . . \ntaking advantage of the problem . . . [by] creating a vastness of documents and then saying, โAh, \nproportionality.โ  You canโt have it both ways.โ  Id. at 29:14โ17.  In response, the City said it \ncould โprovide the search parameters that were run . . . to the plaintiffsโ counsel, but itโs the same \nones that are in the ESI protocol.โ Id. at 44:16โ18; see also id. at 55:2โ7 (the City again claimed \nthat the search terms that generated 2.6 million documents were those contained in Appendix B \n9 / 13 \n\nof the ESI Order).  These statements contradict the Martinez Affidavit that shows that when the \nCity actually ran the ESI Order Search Terms, the terms retrieved only 78,702 documents.  The \nCity has failed to explain which search terms elicited 2.6 million documents. \nIn fact, the Martinez Affidavit lists yet another set of search terms run by the City \nand does not indicate how many documents these terms generated, suggesting these may be \nthose terms.  Pursuant to these search terms, the City searched documents for words like โ24,โ \nโarrest,โ โchief,โ โcounty,โ โday,โ โmayor,โ and โwithoutโ with no search delimiters.  Id. at 2โ3. \nThe search terms listed in Paragraph 5 of the Martinez Affidavit were not the ESI Order Search \nTerms or the plaintiffsโ April 2018 Search Terms.  Compare ECF Doc. No. 62-1, at 2โ3, with \nECF Doc. No. 40 at app. B, and ECF Doc. No. 59-3. \n2.  The City did not review the 78,702 documents generated by the plaintiffโs \nApril 2018 search terms. \n \nAccording  to  the  Martinez  Affidavit,  it  was  only  after  winnowing  the  document \npopulation to 9,992 using the 13 โHPD Terms of Artโ that the City reviewed each document for \nresponsiveness.    ECF  Doc.  No.  62-1,  at  6.    Contrary  to  the  Martinez  Affidavit,  the  City \nrepresented to this Court that the City attorneys had reviewed each of the 78,702 documents \nretrieved by the ESI Order Search Terms. Ex. B at 18:11โ12 (โSo the 76,000 documents were \nreviewed one by one by the attorneys in the office.โ).  Upon  being  reminded  by  the plaintiffsโ  \ncounsel  of  the  contents  of  the  Martinez Affidavit, the Cityโs counsel then reversed her \nposition and clarified that the City had only reviewed the 9,992 documents individually for \nresponsiveness.  Id. at 23:8โ24:9. \n  3.  The City represented that it had issued a litigation hold. \nThe City had previously claimed that it โsent out a litigation holdโ when the plaintiffs \ninitially filed suit.  Ex. A at 24:2โ4; see also ECF Doc. No. 47-10, at 2.  However, this appears to \n10 / 13 \n\nbe contradicted by the Banks Affidavit.   The Banks Affidavit indicated that the City had not \nissued a litigation hold notice to any City employees, stating, โCurrently, all HPD email is \narchived indefinitely, so there has been no need to actually put a hold on any employeeโs email.โ  \nECF Doc. No. 51-4 at 2. \n  4.  The City obfuscated the status of the hard drives \nAt the April 3, 2018 hearing on the plaintiffsโ motion to compel, the City informed \nthe Court that it had no reason to believe any relevant documents had been destroyed even \nthough it had not reviewed any documents on the relevant hard drives.  Ex. A at 25:19โ22.  The \nCity went further, informing the Court that it could still search and produce the data on the hard \ndrives it had previously represented were wiped.  Id. at 48:24โ25 (โWe will have our people go \nthrough each personโs hard drive.โ).  Then, on  April  26,  2018,  the  City  represented  that  its \nlast  production,  produced  in  response  to  the  Courtโs  April  10,  2018  Order,  contained \nโeverythingโ responsive to the RFPs listed in the Order.  ECF Doc. No. 59-7. \nWhen the plaintiffs requested clarification on what the City meant by โeverything,โ the \nCity responded on April 27, 2018, saying that โthe production we sent you does satisfy the \nrequirement that the responsive, non-privileged documents that would be on the hard drives of \nthose individuals named in the judgeโs order. [sic]โ  ECF Doc. No. 59-7.  The  City  further \nrepresented that โ[n]o responsive documents were found on the hard drives of the chiefs.โ  ECF \nDoc. No. 59-7, Apr. 27, 2018 Email from C. Lemond. \n At the June 13, 2018 hearing, the City admitted that each of the six hard drives was \nindeed  wiped  clean  after  the  litigation  commenced,  Ex.  B  at  32:11โ33:7,  contrary  to  its \nrepresentations  at  the  prior  hearing  and  to  the plaintiffs,  see  supra,  ยถยถ  89โ91.   The  City \n11 / 13 \n\nconfirmed there were no longer any documents on those hard drives from the relevant time \nperiod.  Ex. B at 35:17โ23. \nIII. \nIt is clear to the Court and the Court concludes that the Cityโs representation to the \nCourt that it would โhave our people go through each personโs hard drive,โ Ex. A at 48:24โ25, \nand that the Cityโs representation to the plaintiffs that โ[n]o responsive documents were found on \nthe hard drives of the chiefs,โ ECF Doc. No. 59-7, were deliberate mischaracterizations. The \nCityโs actions as found, heretofore, were intentional or the result of deliberate indifference.  The \nCity knew well that the evidence existed, that it was material to this litigation and that spoliation \nwas an affront to discovery rules and the Courtโs order.  The affirmative acts that caused the \nspoliation found has not been credibly explained. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) provides that an order establishing contested \nfacts as true is an appropriate remedy when a party violates a discovery order.   See Rule \n37(b)(2)(i)-(ii).  This type remedy cures the violation without inflicting additional costs on the \nparties, and for that reason, the Court determines, in its discretion that entering an adverse \ninference finding is appropriate.  See Compaq Comput. Corp. v. Ergonome Inc., 387 F.3d 403, \n413 (5th Cir. 2004). \n  Therefore, the Court HOLDS that the following inference is appropriate based on the \nCityโs conduct: \nIt is established that (a) throughout the class period, the City of \nHouston had a policy of not releasing warrantless arrestees who \nhad not received neutral determinations of probable cause within \nthe constitutionally required period of time; (b) throughout  the \nclass period, the Cityโs policymakers were aware of this policy; \nand (c) the Cityโs policymakers acted with deliberate indifference \nto the unconstitutional policy and the constitutional violations that \nresulted. \n12 / 13 \n\n \n  It is so Ordered. \n  SIGNED on this 30th day of August, 2018. \n \n \n___________________________________ \nKenneth M. Hoyt \nUnited States District Judge \n13 / 13 ",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Houston police make hundreds of warrantless arrests every week.  The Fourth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and Texas state law require that anyone arrested \nwithout a warrant be released promptlyโafter 48 hours at the longestโunless a neutral magistrate \nhas concluded that there was probable cause for her arrest and continued detention.  Houston has \na policy and practice of disregarding this simple obligation.  Whenever the Harris County Jail \n(where Houston sends warrantless arrestees for probable cause hearings) refuses to accept custody \nof an arrestee, or whenever Houstonโs own arrest procedures are delayed, Houston continues to \ndetain arrestees in its jail cells without a neutral finding of probable cause rather than release them \nafter 48 hours as the Constitution requires.  Publicly available arrest records and booking data \nshow that in 2015 and 2016 the City detained thousands of individuals beyond the constitutionally \npermissible time without ensuring that they received prompt probable cause hearings. \n \n \n\nII.  NATURE OF THE ACTION1 \n2.  The City of Houston arrests hundreds of people each week without a warrant.  \nMisdemeanor and felony arrestees in City custody who do not post bail are eventually transferred \nto the Harris County Jail, where they receive probable cause hearings conducted by video.  As a \nmatter of policy and practice, the City of Houston does not provide probable cause determinations \nfor warrantless arrestees in its custody.  Probable cause determinations are provided only after an \narrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail.  When it takes longer than 48 hours to \ntransfer an arrestee to Harris Countyโand it often doesโHouston, as a matter of policy and \npractice,  continues  to  detain  the  arrestee  unlawfully  rather  than  release  him  as  the  Fourth \nAmendment requires.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, seek \ncompensatory damages for Houstonโs policy of detaining warrantless arrestees in violation of the \nUnited States Constitution and state law. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n4.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \n5.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law causes of action asserted \nin this Complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 because the state law claims form part of the same \ncase or controversy as the federal law claim. \n                                                 \n1  Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they had \npersonal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. \n2 \n \n\nIV.  PARTIES \n6.  Named Plaintiff Juan Hernandez is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n7.  Named Plaintiff DeQuan Kirkwood is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n8.  Named Plaintiff Manuel Trevino is a resident of Katy, Texas. \n9.  Named Plaintiff Kent Wheatfall is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n10.  Named Plaintiff Eric Aguirre is a resident of Houston, Texas. \n11.  Defendant City of Houston is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of \nthe State of Texas.  It is the most populous city in Texas and is located in Harris County, the most \npopulous county in the state.  The City of Houston operates the Houston Police Department \n(โHPDโ) and the City of Houston Jail (โHouston Jailโ).   \nV.  THE  CONSTITUTIONAL  AND  STATUTORY  RIGHT  TO  A  PROMPT \nPROBABLE CAUSE HEARING  \n12.  The Fourth Amendment โrequires a prompt judicial determination of probable \ncause as a prerequisite to an extended pretrial detention following a warrantless arrest.โ Cty. of \nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 47 (1991). โ[A]s a general matter,โ the Supreme Court has \nexplained, โjudicial determinations of probable cause within 48 hours of arrest will . . . complyโ \nwith the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 56.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \nhas similarly explained that probable cause determinations made โ[b]eyond 48 hours after arrestโ \ncan  be  justified  only  by  โthe  existence  of  a  bona  fide  emergency  or  other  extraordinary \ncircumstance.โ  Brown v. Sudduth, 675 F.3d 472, 477 (5th Cir. 2012). \n13.  The right to a probable cause determination within at most 48 hours of arrest is not \nonly enshrined in the United States Constitution, it is also guaranteed by numerous other state and \nlocal rules.  For example, the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure requires that โthe person making \nthe arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall without unnecessary delay, but \n3 \n \n\nnot later than 48 hours after the person is arrested, take the person arrested or have him taken \nbefore some magistrate of the county where the accused was arrested or, to provide more \nexpeditiously to the person arrested . . . before a magistrate in any other county of this state.โ  Tex. \nCode Crim. Proc. ยงยง 14.06(a), 15.17(a).  It is the arresting authorityโs duty to ensure that a \nwarrantless arrestee receives a probable cause hearing before a magistrate within 48 hours.   \n14.  In the event that a prompt probable cause hearing has not been provided, Texas \nstate law mandates the release of the arrestee, stating, โa person who is arrested without a warrant \nand who is detained in jail must be released . . . not later than the 48th hour after the personโs \narrest if the person was arrested for a felony and a magistrate has not determined whether probable \ncause exists to believe that the person committed the offense.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยง 17.033(b). \n15.  With respect to persons arrested for misdemeanors in counties that have over 3 \nmillion  residentsโHarris  County  has  approximately  4.1  million  residentsโTexas  state  law \nimposes an even stricter requirement, providing that โa person . . . arrested without a warrant and \nwho is detained in jail must be released . . . not later than the 24th hour after the personโs arrest if \nthe person was arrested for a misdemeanor and a magistrate has not determined whether probable \ncause exists to believe that the person committed the offense.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยง 17.033(a). \n16.  The Rules of the Harris County Criminal Courts also require the arresting authority \nto ensure a neutral probable cause determination within 48 hours of arrest.  In particular, they \nobligate โ[t]he arresting officer, or the person having custody of the arrestee, [to] ensure that every \narrestee . . . be brought before a judicial officer without unnecessary delay, but not later than 48 \nhours after the person is arrested.โ  Harris Cnty. Crim. Ct. Rule 24.2.1 (2017). \n4 \n \n\n17.  The Harris County local rules expressly permit probable cause hearings to occur \nremotely, using โhigh-speed, two-way audio/video transmission technology.โ  Harris Cnty. Crim. \nCt. Rule 4.2.1 (2017). \n18.  In addition to the numerous state and local provisions requiring a prompt probable \ncause hearing, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas has previously \nenjoined  the  City  of  Houston  to  ensure  that  arrestees  receive  prompt  probable  cause \ndeterminations.  This Court, after a trial in 1982, found that Houstonโs policy of โdetain[ing] \narrestees on โinvestigative holdsโ violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution . . . and Articles 14.06 and 15.17 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.โ  \nSanders v. City of Houston, 543 F. Supp. 694, 696 (S.D. Tex. 1982), affโd 741 F.2d 1379 (5th Cir. \n1984).  To remedy the City of Houstonโs constitutional and state law violations, this Court \nโpermanently enjoinedโ the โCity of Houston, its agents and employees . . . from detaining anyone \narrested without a warrant for a period of more than twenty-four (24) hours without taking the \nperson before a judicial officer for a determination of probable causeโ and further ordered โthat \nroutinely every effort should be made to effect such procedures within a lesser period of time.โ  Id.  \nTwenty-five years later, it is clear thatโdespite this Courtโs orderโthe City of Houston is not \nliving up to its obligations to comply with the Fourth Amendment. \nVI.  THE CITY OF HOUSTONโS POLICIES AND PRACTICES CAUSE RAMPANT \nVIOLATIONS  OF  THE  RIGHT  TO  A  PROMPT  PROBABLE  CAUSE \nDETERMINATION BY A NEUTRAL MAGISTRATE \n19.  Approximately 80,000 people were arrested by the City of Houston in 2014 and \n2015; almost 90 percent of those people were arrested without a warrant.   \n20.  As a matter of policy and practice, the City transfers felony and misdemeanor \narrestees to the Harris County Jail for booking if they are unable to immediately pay a money bail \namount set by a predetermined schedule.  Harris County then assembles groups of arrestees to \n5 \n \n\nappear before a Harris County Hearing Officer for a probable cause hearing.  These hearings \nprimarily occur by video link: the arrestees remain in the Harris County Jail, and a hearing officer \nand an assistant district attorney participate from a room in the courthouse. These probable cause \nhearings are conducted many times per day, throughout the day, every day of the year.  The \nassistant district attorney reads the alleged facts supporting the charges against the arrestee, and \nthe hearing officer determines whether there was probable cause for the arrest.  Harris County does \nnot combine the probable cause hearing with other pretrial proceedings or the appointment of \ncounsel.   \n21.  As a matter of policy and practice, judicial determinations of probable cause for \nwarrantless arrests are not conducted while an individual is in the City of Houstonโs custody.  They \ntake place only after an arrestee has been transferred to the Harris County Jail. \n22.  Therefore, any individual arrested without a warrant who remains in the City of \nHoustonโs custody has not had a judicial determination of probable cause. \n23.  As a matter of policy, custom, or practice, the City does not release people who do \nnot pay bail, even if 48 hours or more have passed since their arrest.2   \n24.  Upon information and belief, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Chief of Police \nArt Acevedo have long been aware of this policy, custom, or practice, and through their awareness \nand inaction, have officially adopted and executed it on behalf of the city.  Former Mayor Annise \nParker (2010โ2016) and Former Chiefs of Police Charles McClelland (2010โFebruary 2016) and \nMartha Montalvo (FebruaryโDecember 2016) were also aware of this policy, custom, or practice, \nand adopted and executed it as well. \n                                                 \n2  Houston releases all arrestees who can pay predetermined financial conditions of release immediately.  It keeps \nin detention only those who are unable to afford release.  At no point do City officials conduct any inquiry into \nwhether arrestees have the ability to pay the predetermined amount of money required for release.   \n6 \n \n\n25.  The Harris County Jail is notoriously overcrowded.3  Both the Houston Chronicle \nand the Houston Press reported that the County has experienced extreme overcrowding since at \nleast 2007, when โovercrowding prompted then-Sheriff Tommy Thomas to ship more than 600 \ninmates to lock-ups in Louisiana.โ Two years later, in 2009, โthen-Sheriff Adrian Garcia sent buses \nof  inmates  to  facilities  in  Texas  and  Louisiana  due  to  the  overcrowding.โ  Those  transfers \nโcontinued through 2012,โ and spiked again in 2015, when the jail found itself at โ95 percent of \nits 9,400-bed capacity.โ4  \n26.  The overcrowding continued through 2016.  In July and August 2016, the situation \nwas so dire that Harris County told HPD to stop transferring inmates to the County Jail, and refused \nto accept busloads of inmates from the Houston Jail.  As a spokesman for Harris County explained, \nโ[w]e couldnโt keep up with the rate of people we had coming here.โ  There was, as he put it, โ[n]o \nroom at the inn โ thatโs literally the phrase that we use.โ  The Harris County spokesman also \nstated that, due to the overcrowding and other issues causing delay, at one point, the average time \n                                                 \n3  See, e.g., Michael Barajas, Why the Harris County Jail is Overcrowded with Legally Innocent People, Houston \nPress  (July  1,  2015),  available  at  http://www.houstonpress.com/news/why-the-harris-county-jail-is-\novercrowded-with-legally-innocent-people-7555627;  St.  John  Barned-Smith,  Inmates  transferred,  jails \novercrowded, Houston Chronicle (Apr. 17, 2016), available at http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-\ntexas/houston/article/Inmates-transferred-jails-overcrowded-7251977.php; Meagan Flynn, Nearly 200 People \nHave Died in Harris County Sheriffโs Office Custody in 10 Years, Houston Press (Aug. 1, 2016), available at \nhttp://www.houstonpress.com/news/nearly-200-people-have-died-in-harris-county-sheriffs-office-custody-in-\n10-years-8616676; Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, \nHouston Press  (September 8, 2016),  available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-\nso-crowded-the-sheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391; Meagan Flynn, Harris County Sheriff May Hand \nOver  17-Year-Olds  to  Private  Prison  Contractor,  Houston  Press  (Sept.  29,  2016),  available  at \nhttp://www.houstonpress.com/news/harris-county-sheriff-may-hand-over-17-year-olds-to-private-prison-\ncontractor-8812196. \n4  St. John Barned-Smith, Inmates transferred, jails overcrowded, Houston Chronicle (Apr. 17, 2016); Michael \nBarajas, Why the Harris County Jail is Overcrowded with Legally Innocent People, Houston Press (July 1, 2015). \n7 \n \n\nfor inmates to be transferred from the Houston Police Department Jail to the Harris County Jail \nwas โ36 to 72 hours.โ5 \n27.  In November 2016, the Houston Chronicle reported that, as a result of the persistent \novercrowding, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards approved a request from Harris County \nโto let nearly 200 inmates sleep on plastic cots on the floorโ while โwarning that the county needs \nto think ahead about how to reduce its inmate population before its over-crowded jail system \nworsens.โ  The Houston Chronicle went on to explain that โHarris County Sheriff Ron Hickman \nsaid additional beds are needed because the jail population has ballooned from 8,500 inmates daily \nto 9,400 last month.โ Throughout this period, Harris County continued to send hundreds of \ndetainees to other county jails and to refuse transfers from the Houston Jail.6   \n28.  The City of Houston and its chief policymakers, including the Mayor and Chief of \nPolice at all times relevant to this class action, have long been aware of these delays and the \nconstitutional violations that result. \n29.  In fact, Mayor Sylvester Turner himself has publicly acknowledged the significant \novercrowding at the Harris County Jail.  A report published by Mayor Turner in March 2016 stated \nthat โthe Harris County Jail is woefully overcrowded,โ and that โHarris County is notorious for \nneedlessly jailing Houstonians pretrial.โ7 \n                                                 \n5  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston Press \n(Sept.  8,  2016),  available  at  http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-the-\nsheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391. \n6  Andrea Zelinski, The Houston Chronicle, Jail commission approves COT plan request (Nov. 4, 2016), available \nat  http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/houston/article/Jail-commission-OKs-county-request-for-\ntemporary-10592050.php. \n7  Mayor  Sylvester  Turner,  Transition  Committee  on  Criminal  Justice  (Mar.  1,  2016),  available  at \nhttps://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/transitionreports/criminal_justice.pdf. \n8 \n \n\n30.  Even though the City of Houston and its key policymakers know that the Harris \nCounty Jail is over capacity, the HPD still waits to transfer warrantless arrestees to the Harris \nCounty Jail for probable cause hearings rather than release them after 48 hours or bring them to a \ndifferent county for a prompt hearing. \n31.  Due  to  the  ongoing  issues  in  Harris  County,  the  City  of  Houston  and  its \npolicymakers are also aware that a transfer to Harris County slightly before the 48-hour mark is \nunlikely to result in a timely probable cause hearing. But they detain people in these circumstances \nnonetheless, despite knowing of the constitutional and statutory violations that result. \n32.  Furthermore, the City of Houston remains under a federal court injunction requiring \nit to bring warrantless arrestees before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest for a neutral \ndetermination of probable cause. The City and its chief policymakers are, therefore, on notice that \nthere is a problem with their pre-trial detention system as a matter of law, and act with deliberate \nindifference to the Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights by allowing these unlawful detentions to \ncontinue.  \n33.  This policy, custom, or practiceโwhich has remained unchanged despite the \ninjunctionโhas the inevitable and foreseeable result that numerous individuals arrested by the \nHPD without a warrant are denied their constitutional and statutory right to a prompt probable \ncause hearing. \n34.  Plaintiffsโ analysis of the Countyโs public booking records shows that between \nJanuary 1, 2016, and July 15, 2016, over 1,400 arrestees were held in Houstonโs City Jail for over \n72 hours, and thousands more were held for over 48 hours.  The Houston Press reported that in \n9 \n \n\nJuly and August 2016, over 1,000 inmates waited over 72 hours before being transferred to Harris \nCounty in those two months alone.8     \n35.  Approximately 90% of arrests in Houston are made without warrants.  Harris \nCountyโs publicly available data, therefore, indicates that hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals \nwere held unlawfully in 2015 and 2016, and were denied their right to a neutral and prompt \ndetermination of probable cause. \n36.  The large number of illegal detentions in 2015 and 2016 reflects the City of \nHoustonโs broad, longstanding, and consistent policy of refusing to release warrantless arrestees \neven if more than 48 hours have passed since their warrantless arrest.  For example, booking \nrecords show that one person arrested on July 25, 2016, did not receive a probable cause \ndetermination until July 31, 2016 (more than 144 hours after arrest); another person, arrested on \nJuly 23, 2016, did not receive a probable cause determination until July 30, 2016 (more than 168 \nhours after arrest); and at least 35 other people in the months of July and August 2016 waited more \nthan four days (96 hours) between arrest and a probable cause determination.   \n37.  Nor has the City of Houston taken any other steps to ensure that individuals its \nPolice Department arrests without a warrant receive their constitutional and statutory right to a \nprompt probable cause hearing.  The City of Houston has authority, under the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure, to have arrestees taken โbefore a magistrate in any other county of this stateโ \nin order to ensure a prompt probable cause hearing.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยงยง 14.06(a), \n15.17(a).  According to the Texas Jail Project, there are 273 county jails in Texas.  Many are a \nshort drive from the Harris County Jail, including the Montgomery County Jail in Conroe, Texas \n                                                 \n8  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston Press  \n(September 8, 2016),  available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-\nthe-sheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391. \n10 \n \n\n(1 hour), the Walker County Jail in Huntsville, Texas (1.5 hours), and the Washington County Jail \nin Brenham, Texas (1.5 hours). But, ignoring widespread deprivations of Fourth Amendment \nrights, the City of Houston does not utilize this provision and instead transfers all of its warrantless \narrestees to the Harris County Jail, exclusively. \n38.  Knowingly keeping arrestees beyond the constitutionally required time, or in the \nalternative transferring them to Harris County after a substantial delay with no expectation that \nthey will receive a prompt hearing, demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the arresteesโ \nconstitutional rights.   \n39.  Houstonโs policy, custom, or practice of continuing to detain arrestees after they \nhave failed to receive prompt probable cause determinations is the moving force and direct cause \nof  Plaintiffsโ  unreasonable  detentions,  and  is  the  moving  force  of  the  deprivation  of  their \nconstitutional rights. \n40.  This persistent and widespread practice in the City of Houston continues despite \nthe City of Houstonโs awareness that the obvious consequence of this practice is the systematic \ndenial of constitutional rights to individuals in its custody. Specifically, the Mayor and Chief of \nPolice at all relevant times were aware of the policy, custom or practice, had actual or constructive \nknowledge  that  it  was  the  moving  force  behind  the  violation  of  numerous  individualsโ \nconstitutional rights, and executed the policy, custom, or practice nonetheless.  \nDeQuan Kirkwood9 \n41.  On July 25, 2016, DeQuan Kirkwood drove to visit his probation officer.   \n42.  When he arrived, Houston police officers arrested Mr. Kirkwood for evading arrest \nwith a vehicle.  \n                                                 \n9     Mr. Kirkwoodโs first name is misspelled as โDeJuanโ in some of his records. \n11 \n \n\n43.  Mr. Kirkwoodโs arrest was entered into the City of Houstonโs and Harris Countyโs \nelectronic records at 11:15 PM on July 25, 2016.  \n44.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on July 28, 2016, at 1:23 \nAM, more than 50 hours later, Mr. Kirkwood was transferred to Harris County custody.   \n45.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Kirkwood  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n46.  At 7:00 AM on July 28, 2016โmore than 55 hours after his arrestโMr. Kirkwood \nappeared for his probable cause hearing.  \n47.  The judge found there was no probable cause for Mr. Kirkwoodโs arrest and \ncontinued detention. Mr. Kirkwood was promptly released.  \nManuel Trevino \n48.  On July 27, 2016, Manuel Trevino was visiting a friendโs house when the Houston \nPolice arrived and searched the house without a warrant.  The police found narcotics in the home \nand arrested Mr. Trevino along with others in the house. \n49.  Mr. Trevinoโs arrest was entered into the City of Houstonโs and Harris Countyโs \nelectronic records at 1:55 PM on July 27, 2016.    \n50.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on July 30, 2016, at 10:42 \nPM, Mr. Trevino was booked into Harris County custody.  He had been detained in Houston \ncustody for almost 81 hours without receiving a probable cause hearing. \n51.  According to the Cityโs arrest data, Mr. Trevino was released from the Cityโs \ncustody on July 30, 2016, at 9:39 PM, almost 80 hours after his arrest.  \n52.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Trevino  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n12 \n \n\n53.  On July 31, 2016, at 10:00 PM, a judge found probable cause for his arrest and \ncontinued detentionโalmost 104 hours after his arrest.   \n54.  On  October  28,  2016,  Mr.  Trevino  pleaded  guilty  and  received  a  deferred \nadjudication. He was not sentenced to any jail time, and his sentence was not credited with any \ntime he spent in pre-trial custody.  \nKent Wheatfall \n55.  Kent Wheatfall is a retired U.S. Postal Service worker.   \n56.  On January 7, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was arrested for aggravated assault.  Mr. \nWheatfallโs arrest was entered into the City of Houstonโs and Harris Countyโs electronic records \nat 10:30 PM on January 7, 2016. \n57.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on January 10, 2016, at \n1:52 AM, Mr. Wheatfall was booked into Harris County custody. He had been in Houston custody \nfor more than 51 hours.  At 4:00 AM that dayโmore than 53 hours after his arrestโMr. Wheatfall \nreceived a probable cause hearing, where a judge found probable cause for his arrest and continued \ndetention. \n58.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Wheatfall  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n59.  On February 4, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was released on bond.  He was indicted on \nFebruary 18, 2016.  \n60.  On May 17, 2016, Mr. Wheatfall was rearrested and could not post bond.  He was \nheld until he pleaded guilty and received a deferred adjudication on February 10, 2017.  He was \nnot sentenced to any jail time, and his sentence was not credited with any time he spent in pre-trial \ncustody. \n13 \n \n\nJuan Hernandez \n61.  On January 7, 2016, at about 4:30 PM, Houston police officers arrested Juan \nHernandez, without a warrant, for misdemeanor assault.  \n62.  Mr. Hernandezโs arrest was entered into the City of Houstonโs and Harris Countyโs \nelectronic records at 4:53 PM on January 7, 2016. \n63.  When Mr. Hernandez was brought to the Houston City Jail, a jail employee there \ntold him that the Harris County Jail was full and that his transfer to Harris County would be \ndelayed.  She told Mr. Hernandez to โbe patient.โ  \n64.  Later on, Mr. Hernandez saw a Houston City Jail employee that he knew. The \nemployee said: โYou still here? You shouldโve been gone by now.โ  \n65.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on January 10, 2016, at \n12:49 AM, Mr. Hernandez was booked into County custody without having received a probable \ncause hearingโalmost 56 hours after his arrest. \n66.  Mr. Hernandez remembers being held for three days in the Houston City jail. \n67.  Harris Countyโs records reflect that Mr. Hernandez received a probable cause \nhearing before a judge on January 9, 2016, at 6:00 PMโmore than 49 hours after his arrest.  \n68.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Hernandez  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances.   \n69.  Five days after his hearingโafter a week in custodyโMr. Hernandez pleaded \nguilty.  He was released and given community supervision without jail time.   \nEric Aguirre \n70.  On March 10, 2018, at about 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM, Houston police offers arrested \nEric Aguirre, without a warrant, for assaulting a family member. \n14 \n \n\n71.  Mr. Aguirreโs arrest was entered into Harris Countyโs electronic records at 1:15 PM \non March 10, 2018. \n72.  While in Houston custody, Mr. Aguirre was told that the reason that the jail was so \ncrowded was because the Harris County Jail was too full. \n73.  According to Harris Countyโs publicly available records, on March 12, 2018, at \n4:49 AM, Mr. Aguirre was booked into Harris County custody. He had been in Houston custody \nfor more than 39 hours. \n74.  Mr. Aguirre remembers being brought to the courthouse around 10:00 AM on \nMarch 12, 2018 but having to wait with around nine other arrestees and not appearing before a \njudge until 8:00 or 9:00 PM that nightโapproximately 55 hours after his arrest. \n75.  Harris Countyโs records reflect that Mr. Aguirre received a probable cause hearing \nbefore a judge on March 12, 2018, at 10:00 AMโmore than 44 hours after his arrest. \n76.  The  Cityโs  delay  in  bringing  Mr.  Aguirre  to  the  Harris  County  Jail  was \nunreasonable and not justified by extraordinary circumstances. \n77.  On March 14, 2018, Mr. Aguirre was released on $3,000.00 bond.  \n78.  On July 26, 2018, a judge dismissed the charges. \nVII.  CLASS ACTION \n79.  The named Plaintiffs bring this action, on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common \nbasis. \n80.  A class action is a superior means, and the only practicable means, by which the \nnamed Plaintiffs and unknown Class Members can challenge the Cityโs unlawful detention policy. \n81.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(a)(1)โ(4) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n15 \n \n\n82.  This  action  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  adequacy, \npredominance, and superiority requirements of those provisions. \n83.  The named Plaintiffs propose two classes seeking compensatory relief. \n84.  The first subclass is defined as: All persons who were arrested without a warrant \nby the City of Houston and held for 48 hours or more without a prompt judicial determination of \nprobable cause at any time between December 6, 2014 (two years before the filing of this \nComplaint) and the date of the order granting class certification.10  \n85.  The second subclass is defined as: All persons who were arrested without a warrant \nby the City of Houston and held for more than 24 hours and less than 48 hours without a prompt \njudicial determination of probable cause at any time between December 6, 2014 (two years before \nthe filing of this Complaint) and the date of the order granting class certification. \nA.  Numerosity. Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n86.  The individuals in the class are so numerous that joinder of all members would be \nimpractical. \n87.  Harris Countyโs public booking records show that between January 1, 2016, and \nJuly 15, 2016, over 1,400 arrestees were held in Houstonโs City Jail for over 72 hours, and that \nthousands more were held over 48 hours.  Thousands more were held over 24 hours.  The Houston \nPress separately concluded that in July and August 2016 alone over 1,000 inmates waited more \nthan 72 hours before being transferred to Harris County.11   \n                                                 \n10  The statute of limitations for both claims is two years. Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir. \n2001).  \n11  Meagan Flynn, The Harris County Jail Got So Crowded the Sheriff Delayed Inmate Transfers, Houston Press  \n(September 8, 2016), available at http://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-harris-county-jail-got-so-crowded-the-\nsheriff-delayed-inmate-transfers-8745391. \n16 \n \n\n88.  Publicly available data shows that violations occurred throughout 2016 and have \nnot abated. Thousands of arrestees were likely subjected to this policy during the class period.  \nBecause  joinder  of  thousands  of  plaintiffs  would  be  impracticable,  this  case  satisfies  the \nnumerosity requirement. \nB.  Commonality. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n89.  The relief sought is common to all Class Members, and common questions of law \nand fact exist as to all Class Members.  The named Plaintiffs seek relief concerning whether the \nCity of Houstonโs policies, practices, and procedures violated the rights of the Class Members. \n90.  Common legal and factual questions arise from one central scheme: the Cityโs \npolicy of detaining warrantless arrestees beyond 48 hours when there has not been a probable cause \ndetermination by a neutral magistrate.  The City of Houston has operated this policy openly and in \nmaterially the same manner every day during the class period.  The resolution of these legal and \nfactual issues will determine whether all of the Class Members are entitled to the relief that they \nseek. \n91.  There are questions of law and fact common to all Class Members.  Among these \ncommon questions are: \na.  Whether  it  violates  the  United  States  Constitution  to  detain  warrantless \narrestees for unreasonable periods of time, including in excess of 48 hours, \nwithout a judicial determination of probable cause for the detention; \nb.  Whether it violates state law to detain warrantless arrestees for unreasonable \nperiods  of  time,  including  in  excess  of  48  hours,  without  a  judicial \ndetermination of probable cause for the detention;  \nc.  Whether the City of Houston maintained a policy, custom, or widespread \npractice of detaining warrantless arrestees for unreasonable periods of time, \nincluding routinely in excess of 48 hours, without a judicial determination of \nprobable cause for the detention. \nC.  Typicality.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3)  \n17 \n \n\n92.  The named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the other Class Members, \nand the named Plaintiffs have the same interests in this case as all other Class Members.  Each \nClass Member was arrested without a warrant and did not receive a probable cause hearing within \na reasonable period of time.  Each waited longer than 48 hours without a judicial determination of \nprobable cause.  Defendant City of Houston denied each Plaintiff a prompt judicial determination \nof probable cause.  The answer to whether the City of Houston maintains an unlawful policy of \ndetaining warrantless arrestees for an unreasonable period, often for longer than 48 hours, in the \nabsence of a judicial determination of probable cause will determine the claims of the named \nPlaintiffs and every other Class Member. \n93.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in their claims that the City of Houstonโs policies \nand practices concerning warrantless arrestees violate their rights, that ruling will likewise benefit \nevery other member of the Class.   \nD.  Adequacy.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4)  \n94.  The named Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the Class because their interest \nin the vindication of the legal claims that they raise is entirely aligned with the interests of the \nother Class Members, each of whom has the same basic constitutional and statutory claims.  The \nnamed Plaintiffs are members of the Class, and there are no known conflicts of interest among the \nmembers of the Class, all of whom have a similar interest in vindicating their constitutional and \nstatutory rights in the face of Defendantโs policy. \n95.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Civil Rights Corps, the Texas Fair \nDefense Project, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP, who have experience in litigating complex civil rights \nmatters in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the details of Defendantโs scheme and \nthe relevant constitutional and statutory law.  Counsel from Civil Rights Corps have been lead \n18 \n \n\ncounsel in well over a dozen major federal class actions challenging the constitutionality of post-\narrest systems in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and other states. \n96.  Class counsel have conducted an investigation into the City of Houstonโs policy, \ncustom, or practice of detaining arrestees for unreasonable periods of time without a judicial \ndetermination of probable cause, and the near constant overcrowding in Harris County Jail.  This \ninvestigation has included interviews with witnesses, city officials and employees, inmates, \nattorneys practicing in courts throughout the region, community members, and national experts in \nconstitutional law, post-arrest procedure, law enforcement, judicial procedures, criminal law, \npretrial services, and jails. \n97.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of state law and practices as they relate \nto federal constitutional requirements.  Counsel have studied the way that these systems function \nin other cities and counties in order to investigate the wide array of lawful options available to \nmunicipalities that seek to comply with the Constitution. \n98.  As a result, counsel have devoted significant time and resources to becoming \nintimately familiar with the Cityโs scheme and with the relevant state and federal laws and \nprocedures that can and should govern it.  The interests of the Class Members will be fairly and \nadequately protected by the Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n99.  Class treatment under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate because common questions of \nlaw and fact overwhelmingly predominate over individual ones and a class action is the only \npracticable wayโand, therefore, the superior wayโof resolving this case.  This case turns, for \nevery Class Member, on what the Cityโs policies, customs, or practices were and whether those \npolicies, customs, or practices were lawful. \n19 \n \n\n100.  The common questions of law and fact listed above are dispositive questions in the \ncase of every Class Member.  The question of liability can therefore be determined on a class-wide \nbasis.  Class-wide treatment of liability is a far superior method of determining the content and \nlegality of the Cityโs policies and practices than individual suits by hundreds or thousands of \narrestees.  \n101.  The question of damages will also be driven by class-wide determinations of \ncommon questions, such as the policies, practices, and conditions at the Houston Jail. To the extent \nthat individual damages will vary, they will vary depending in large part on the amount of time the \nindividual was unlawfully jailed.  Determining damages for individual Class Members can be \nhandled in a ministerial fashion based on easily verifiable records of the length of unlawful \nincarceration.  If need be, damages sub-classes can be formed, and individual damages hearings \nbased on special circumstances can be held, after class-wide liability is determinedโa method far \nmore efficient than litigating hundreds or thousands of individual lawsuits on the merits. \nVIII.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One:  Defendant Violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment Rights by Failing to Release Them When They Did Not \nReceive Timely Judicial Determination of Probable Cause \n102.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1โ89. \n103.  The Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause \nafter a warrantless arrest.  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 47; Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975).  \nThis  constitutional  provision  is  presumptively  violated  after  48  hours  absent  extraordinary \ncircumstances, which are not present here.12  Plaintiffs allege, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, that \n                                                 \n12  See, e.g., Waganfeald v. Gusman, 674 F.3d 475, 482 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding that the detention of warrantless \narrestees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina fell within the emergency exception to McLaughlinโs 48-hour \nrule).  \n20 \n \n\nDefendant violated Plaintiffsโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to release them \nafter it failed to ensure a prompt judicial determination of probable cause. \n104.  Defendantโs policy, custom, or practice of continuing to detain individuals arrested \nwithout a warrant even after they have not received a prompt probable cause hearing, rather than \nreleasing them, is the moving force of the McLaughlin violations occurring in the City of Houston \nJail.   \n105.  This practice of the City is persistent and widespread, and is so common and well \nsettled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy.  \n106.  Defendant and its chief policymakers, including the Mayor and Chief of Police at \nall relevant times, had actual or constructive knowledge of this policy, custom, or practice long \nenough to recognize and correct it.   \n107.  By doing nothing to correct an ongoing pattern of constitutional deprivations of \nwhich it is well aware and has been aware for years, Defendant and its policymakers, including \nthe Mayor and Chief of Police at all relevant times, adopted and executed this policy, custom, or \npractice on behalf of the City. \n108.  This policy, custom, or practice continues with the express or implied authority of \nHoustonโs Mayor and Chief of Police.   \n109.  In allowing this widespread policy, custom, or practice to persist, Defendant has \ndemonstrated deliberate indifference to the ongoing and numerous constitutional violations that \nhave affected thousands of individuals in the class period alone. \nCount Two:  Defendant Violated Plaintiffsโ Rights Under Texas State \nLaw by Refusing to Release Them When They Did Not Receive Timely \nJudicial Determination of Probable Cause   \n110.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1โ97.   \n21 \n \n\n111.  Texas state law requires that, where an individual is arrested without a warrant, โthe \nperson making the arrest or the person having custody of the person arrested shall without \nunnecessary delay, but not later than 48 hours after the person is arrested, take the person arrested \nor have him taken before some magistrate of the county where the accused was arrested or, to \nprovide more expeditiously to the person arrested . . . before a magistrate in any other county of \nthis state.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยงยง 14.06(a), 15.17(a).  In the event that a prompt probable cause \nhearing has not been provided, Texas state law mandates that โa person who is arrested without a \nwarrant and who is detained in jail must be released . . . not later than the 48th hour after the \npersonโs arrest if the person was arrested for a felony and a magistrate has not determined whether \nprobable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. ยง \n17.033(b). \n112.  With respect to persons arrested for misdemeanors in counties that have over 3 \nmillion residents (Harris County has approximately 4.1 million residents), Texas state law requires \nthat warrantless arrestees โmust be released . . . not later than the 36th hour after the personโs \narrestโ if a magistrate โhas not determined whether probable cause exists.โ  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. \nยง 17.033(a-1). \n113.  The City of Houston unlawfully detained Plaintiffs under Texas State law when it \nfailed to release them as required by Articles 14.06(a), 15.17(a), and 17.033(a-1) and (b) of the \nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure.   \n22 \n \n\nIX.  REQUESTS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the named Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of others \nsimilarly situated, request that this Court issue the following relief: \na.  A judgment compensating named Plaintiffs and the Class Members for the damages \nthey suffered as a result of Defendantโs unconstitutional and unlawful conduct, in an \namount to be determined at trial; \nb.  An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 18 U.S.C. ยง 1964, and any other relief this Court deems just \nand proper; and \nc.  Such other relief as this Court deems equitable, just, and proper. \n \n23 \n \n\nDated:  December 10, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Patrick King \n  Patrick King (TX Bar No. 24095186) \nAttorney-in-Charge \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \n609 Main Street \nHouston, Texas 77002 \n(713) 836-3632 Telephone \n(713) 835-3601 Facsimile \npatrick.king@kirkland.com \n \nAmanda Elbogen  \n(Admitted pro hac vice) \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \n333 South Hope Street \nLos Angeles, California 90071 \n(213) 680-8400 Telephone \n(213) 680-8500 Facsimile \namanda.elbogen@kirkland.com \n \nAlex S.
