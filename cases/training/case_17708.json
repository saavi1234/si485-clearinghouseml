    "summary": "<p>The complaint for this case was filed on July 2, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The complaint challenged an ordinance in Graham, North Carolina that forced would-be organizers of protests to obtain a permit from the city at least twenty-four hours in advance. The ordinance gave the police chief total discretion to grant or deny permits based on whether the protest would cause a disturbance. Plaintiffs were individuals and organizations, including the Alamance County Branch of the NAACP and the national NAACP, who wanted to protest systemic racism, police brutality, and a local Confederate monument in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. They were represented by counsel from the ACLU of North Carolina, the national ACLU, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and private attorneys. Defendants were various city and county officials, including the Mayor of Graham, the Chief of Police of Graham Police Department, and the Sheriff of Alamance County. Plaintiffs brought the suit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, alleging that the ordinance and its enforcement violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The First Amendment claim alleged that the ordinance was content-based regulation of speech and unconstitutional prior restraint. The Fourteenth Amendment claim alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague since it did not provide notice of what standards were required to get a permit and that it violated the plaintiffs' right to travel. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as attorney's fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Catherine C. Eagles and Magistrate Judge L. Patrick Auld.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants consented to a temporary restraining order (TRO) that would prohibit defendants from enforcing the ordinance for fourteen days. The court granted this consent motion on July 6. Then, on July 14, the city council repealed the ordinance, which rendered any issued or prospective injunctive relief moot. The court granted the order withdrawing motions for injunctive relief on July 16.</p>\r\n<p>However, on July 17, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which made the same legal complaints (violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments), but this time focused on being allowed to protest at the courthouse, rather than the ordinance. On July 28, the plaintiffs submitted a second motion for a temporary restraining order that would enjoin the defendants from prohibiting their protests at the courthouse.</p>\r\n<p>In early August, Judge Eagles issued her opinion regarding the motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 457284. She held that, while the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed on the merits, the balance of equities was in the defendants' favor as to the temporary restraining order. She found that the wording of the order was problematic and wanted to give defendants a chance to put in place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to protect public property. Therefore, she denied the motion for a temporary restraining order and left the motion for preliminary injunction pending.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2020, the court issued an order granting the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 4738015. The court found that defendants' actions restricting protests at the courthouse constituted a total prohibition, rather than a time, place, or manner restriction. The total prohibition was not narrowly tailored, and so the court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction. The order enjoined the defendants from prohibiting protests at the courthouse steps, the courthouse lawns, the sidewalks, and the area between the courthouse and the Confederate monument. However, the order left an exemption that allowed the defendants to impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions or to temporarily prohibit protests in the event of a short-term emergency (for example, if a person had a heart attack and emergency services needed to interrupt the protest).</p>\r\n<p>A few months later, the parties moved for stipulated consent decree. The district court approved their request on April 21, 2021. The consent decree required that: (1) specified areas around the courthouse must be open for first amendment activity; (2) any restrictions of free speech in these areas must be reasonable time, place, and manner restriction, and viewpoint- and content-neutral; (3) adopt amendments to their Facility Use Policy within thirty days such as \"use fee waiver;\" and (4) county defendants shall undergo implicit racial bias and racial equity training by September 24, 2021. The court retained jurisdiction over this matter for three years.</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed pending defendants' compliance with the consent decree.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This complaint, filed on July 2, 2020, came amidst the nationwide protests that occurred after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020. The complaint alleged that a local ordinance in Graham, North Carolina violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The ordinance required would-be protesters to acquire a permit at least twenty-four hours in advance of their protest, and the Chief of Police had the authority to issue the permits. Plaintiffs, including the NAACP of Alamance County, the national NAACP, and several individual plaintiffs, sought injunctive relief and declaratory relief against the Mayor of Graham, the Graham Chief of Police, and the Sheriff of Alamance County. \r\n\r\nThe city repealed the ordinance on July 14. Then on July 17, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which focused on the ability to protest at the historic courthouse, which contained a Confederate monument. They claimed that anti-racist groups were consistently denied permits to protest at the courthouse, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. \r\n\r\nOn August 5 the court denied the motion for a TRO, but left undecided the motion for a preliminary injunction. On August 14 the court granted the preliminary injunction. The court approved a stipulated consent decree on April 21, 2021 and retained jurisdiction over the matter for three years.",

Kersey, Carleen Tenae \nTurner, Terence Colin Dodd, Destiny Clarke, Annie Simpson, Nerissa Rivera, \nAdam Rose, and Gregory Drumwright, have moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 \nand LR 65.1 for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction \nrestraining enforcement of Chapter 18, Art. VI, Sections 18-172 and 18-174 \nthrough 181 of the City of Graham (“City”), North Carolina’s Code of Ordinances \n(“the Ordinance”). Among other things, the Ordinance makes it unlawful for any \nperson to gather with anyone else “for the purpose of protesting” or “making \nknown any position or thought” anywhere in the City without first obtaining the \nChief of Police’s permission at least 24 hours in advance. Plaintiffs argue that the \nOrdinance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \n \n1 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 1 of 7\n\nAfter review of the declarations, documentary evidence, briefing submitted \nby Plaintiffs, the response of Defendants Jerry Peterman, Frankie Maness, Chip \nTurner, Melody Wiggins, Jennifer Talley, Ricky Hall and Jeffrey Prichard \n(hereafter collectively referred to as “Graham Defendants”) that they do not oppose \nthe entry of a temporary restraining order pending further orders of the Court, and \nthe parties’ Joint Motion for Consent Temporary Restraining Order, which sets \nforth, among other things, that the Graham defendants and Defendant Sheriff Terry \nS. Johnson agrees to the same, the Court hereby GRANTS the joint motion for a \ntemporary restraining order as to the Graham ordinance referenced in the complaint \nexisting as of July 2, 2020. \nBACKGROUND \nThe Ordinance provides that “[n]o parade, picket line or group \ndemonstration is permitted on the sidewalks or streets of the city unless a permit \ntherefor has been issued by the city.” Chapter 18, Art. VI. § 18-175. It defines \ngroup demonstration as “any assembly together or concert of action between two \nor more persons for the purpose of protesting any matter or making known any \nposition or thought of the group or of attracting attention thereto,” parade as “any \nparade, march, ceremony, show, exhibition or procession of any kind in or upon \nthe public streets, sidewalks, parks or other public places,” and picket line as “any \npersons formed together for the purpose of making known any position or \npromotion of said persons or on behalf of any organization.” Id. § 18-172. \nTo enforce the Ordinance, the Chief of Police is authorized to: \n \n(1) Require a written application . . . to be filed 24 hours in advance \nof such parade, picket line or group demonstration . . . \n2 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 2 of 7\n\n \n(2) Refuse to issue such permit when the activity or purpose stated in \nthe application would violate any ordinance of the city or statute \nof the state, or when the activity or purpose would endanger the \npublic health or safety, or hinder or prevent the orderly movement \nof pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the sidewalks or streets of the \ncity. \n \n(3) Specify in the permit whether or not minors below the age of 18 \nyears will be permitted to participate. The chief of police or, in his \nabsence, the next highest ranking police officer of the city on duty \nshall pass upon whether or not minors below the age of 18 years \nshall be permitted to participate . . \n. and shall base his determination upon whether or not the purpose, time  \nor place of the participation will be detrimental to or endanger the health, \nwelfare or safety of said minors. \n \nId. § 18-178. \n \nMoreover, the Ordinance provides that the Chief or other designated \nofficer must, “among other considerations provided,” find as a requisite before \nissuing any permit that the activity will not (1) “require excessive diversion of \npolice from other necessary duties”; (2) “interfere with the right of property \nowners in the area to enjoy peaceful occupancy and use of their property”; or (3) \n“unreasonabl[y] interfere[] with normal vehicular or pedestrian traffic in the \narea, . . . prevent normal police or fire protection to the public, [or] . . . be likely \nto cause injury to persons or property or provoke   disorderly conduct or create a \npublic disturbance.” Id. § 18-179. \nIf the Chief of Police grants the permit, he then has discretion to limit the \nprotest or other gathering to “not more than six persons . . . [in] the entire width of \n[the] street or sidewalk within . . . 100 feet.” Id. § 18-181. During a permitted \nprotest, parade, demonstration, or picket, he has discretion to order individuals to \ndisperse upon a violation of any of the terms of the permit. Id. § 18-176. If \n3 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 3 of 7\n\nindividuals fail to disperse, they may be subject to arrest under NC Gen. Stat. § \n14-288.5. \nThe Ordinance also makes it illegal for any minor to be present at an \nexpressive gathering without explicit permission from the Chief or other \ndesignated officer. It authorizes them to deny such permission upon their own \ndetermination that attending would be “detrimental to or endanger [the minor’s] \nhealth, welfare or safety.” Art. VI § 18-178. Each violation of the Ordinance is \n“punishable as a misdemeanor, subject to a fine not to exceed $500.” Ch. 1 § 1-\n12. Defendants Prichard and Johnson both enforce criminal statutes.  \nIn their Complaint and in declarations, Plaintiffs assert that they regularly \nattempt to exercise their First Amendment rights to protest, assemble, and \nassociate in Graham. In particular, Plaintiffs describe recent efforts to protest \ninstitutionalized racism, police violence against Black people, and the continued \npresence of the Confederate monument in front of the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse in Graham. Because of the Ordinance, however, Plaintiffs contend \nthat their exercise of their First Amendment rights has been impermissibly \nburdened and restrained.  \nOn July 2, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nalleging that the Ordinance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. They also filed a motion for a temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction. On July 5, 2020, the Graham Defendants filed a \nresponse indicating they did not oppose entry of a temporary restraining order. On \nJuly 5, 2020, the parties jointly moved for a consent temporary restraining order \n4 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 4 of 7\n\nenjoining the Graham Defendants and Defendant Johnson.  \n  ANALYSIS   \nTo obtain a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims; they are \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief; the equities favor a \ntemporary restraining order; and a temporary restraining order serves the public \ninterest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \nI.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \nPlaintiffs challenge the Ordinance on First Amendment grounds because: (1) \nthe Ordinance is a content-based restriction that cannot survive strict scrutiny; (2) the \nOrdinance is an impermissible prior restraint on speech; and (3) the Ordinance’s \nrestrictions excessively burden speech and are not reasonable time, place, and \nmanner restrictions. Plaintiffs also challenge the Ordinance on Fourteenth \nAmendment grounds because the Ordinance is void for vagueness under the Due \nProcess Clause. The Court finds Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their First and \nFourteenth Amendment claims.  \nII.  Irreparable Injury \n \n“[L]oss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976). As the Court finds Plaintiffs likely to prevail on their First and Fourteenth \nAmendment claim, the Court finds them likely to suffer irreparable injury as well. \nPlaintiffs’ injury is particularly imminent and immediate preliminary injunctive \nrelief is necessary because several Plaintiffs state that they intend to protest in the \n5 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 5 of 7\n\nnear future. For these reasons, the Court finds it appropriate to issue this Order. \nIII.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \n \nPlaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury without preliminary relief. The \nGraham Defendants concede that they will less likely be harmed by issuance of a \nTRO. The equities therefore weigh in favor of an injunction. See Giovani \nCarandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. 2002) (injunction of a \nlikely unconstitutional law does not harm the state). Furthermore, the Fourth \nCircuit has held that upholding constitutional rights “surely serves” the public \ninterest. Id. Plaintiffs have therefore satisfied these factors. \nCONCLUSION \n \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order is GRANTED. The \nGraham Defendants and Defendant Johnson are hereby RESTRAINED from \nenforcing the Ordinance and the Ordinance shall have no force or effect pending \nfurther orders of the Court.  \nIn the Court’s discretion, the bond requirement under Rule 65(c) is \nwaived. \nThis Order shall be in effect for 14 days. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n65(d)(2), Plaintiffs shall provide Defendants with notice of this Order and \nDefendants shall immediately provide Notice to their officers, attorneys, agents, \nemployees, and other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nthem.  \n \n \n \n6 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Court will continue to review Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction, and a hearing on that motion will be held by the undersigned on July \n20, 2020 at 9:00 a.m. \nThis the 6th day of July, 2020. \n \n \n                 \n_________________________________________ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n7 \n  Case 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 15   Filed 07/06/20   Page 7 of 7",

Eagles, District Judge. \nThe plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from \nprohibiting protests in the immediate vicinity of the Alamance County Courthouse.  The \nplaintiffs are likely to be successful on their claims that the County defendants are \nviolating their First Amendment rights by prohibiting protests on the steps, grounds, and \nsidewalks surrounding the Historic Alamance County Courthouse, and they are likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief.   \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis case began on July 2, 2020, when the plaintiffs filed a complaint and a \nmotion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directed towards \nenforcement of an ordinance enacted by the City of Graham that governed parade and \nprotest permits.  See Docs. 1, 2.  The plaintiffs are the Alamance County Branch of the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People and several individuals \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 1 of 16\n\nactively engaged in protesting against a monument outside the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse in Graham, North Carolina.  Doc. 27 at ¶¶ 14–22.  The defendants fall into \ntwo groups:  the City Defendants—the mayor, city council members, city manager, and \npolice chief for the City of Graham—and the County Defendants—the Sheriff, county \ncommissioners, and county manager for Alamance County.  Id. at ¶¶ 23–36. \nShortly before a scheduled hearing, the parties agreed to a consent TRO enjoining \nenforcement of the contested City ordinance, see Doc. 11, which was entered.  Doc. 15.  \nSoon thereafter on July 14, the City repealed the ordinance at issue.  Doc. 27-1.  The \nplaintiffs withdrew their motion for preliminary injunction, Doc. 23, as it had become \nmoot.  See Doc. 24. \nOn July 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint directed at what they \nallege are continued actions by the defendants to suppress their First Amendment rights, \nas well as the rights of other protestors, by prohibiting protests around the Alamance \nCounty Courthouse and by imposing restrictions on protests by the repeated issuance of \n“State of Emergency Declarations.”  See Doc. 27 at ¶¶ 5–10.  The pending motion for a \nTemporary Restraining Order was filed on July 28, 2020 and is directed towards both \npractices.  Doc. 47.  The City of Graham defendants filed a written response with \nevidence, Docs. 53, 53-1–53-4, as did the Alamance County defendants.  Docs. 54, 54-1–\n54-9.  A hearing was held on July 30, 2020.  Minute Entry 07/30/2020.  Following the \nhearing, the plaintiffs filed a reply brief, Doc. 55, and the County Defendants filed a sur-\nreply.  Doc. 56. \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 2 of 16\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court denied the motion to the extent it was \ndirected against the City Defendants, based on facts found and reasons stated in open \ncourt; that aspect of the pending motion will not be addressed further here.  See Minute \nEntry 07/30/2020.  The Court took the motion under advisement to the extent it was \ndirected against the County Defendants.   \nIn a written order entered shortly thereafter, the Court found that the plaintiffs \nwere likely to be successful on the merits in their claims against the County Defendants \nand were likely to suffer irreparable harm.  See generally Doc. 57.  The Court denied the \nmotion for a temporary restraining order because of the need to evaluate the specific \nlanguage for a preliminary injunction and to give the defendants a short time to plan for \nthe end of their long-term prohibition.  Doc. 57 at 17-18.  The Court indicated it would \nlikely grant the motion for preliminary injunction but allowed the parties to submit \nadditional evidence and briefing; it also invited submissions on appropriate language for \nan injunction.  See id.   \nThe County Defendants filed a response, Doc. 58, establishing that they had a \npost-injunction plan for managing the space and providing a revised operating procedure \nfor the Alamance County Courthouse grounds.  Doc. 58-1.  Despite the specific invitation \nfrom the Court, see Doc. 57 at 19, the defendants did not suggest any language for the \npreliminary injunction, see Doc. 58, nor did they suggest any language to cover \nemergency situations.  See id.    \nThe plaintiffs also filed a supplemental brief with evidence.  Doc. 59; Docs. 59-1 \nto 59-19.  They asked the Court to specifically enjoin the County Defendants from \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 3 of 16\n\nprohibiting protests on:  the steps on all sides of the courthouse; the lawns on the \ncourthouse grounds; the sidewalk encircling the courthouse inside the traffic roundabout; \nthe walkway from the courthouse steps to the sidewalk; the area between the monument \nand the courthouse marked “RESERVED”; and the red portion of the crosswalk that runs \nbeside the monument.  Doc. 59 at 1.  In response to the defendants’ submission, the \nplaintiffs contended that the new policy, while an improvement, still violates their \nconstitutional rights.  See Doc. 60.   The County Defendants argue otherwise.  Doc. 61. \nThe motion for preliminary injunction is now ripe for review.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nFor purposes of this Order only, the Court makes the following findings of fact, \nafter consideration of all the evidence submitted.  As is necessary and in the context of \nspecific issues, the Court will address and find other relevant facts throughout this Order. \nThe plaintiffs regularly attempt to exercise their First Amendment rights to protest, \nassemble, and associate in Graham, and recently they have organized, engaged in, or \nattempted to organize or engage in protests against institutionalized racism, police \nviolence against Black people, and the continued presence of a Confederate monument in \nfront of the Alamance County Historic Courthouse1 in Graham.  The Alamance NAACP \nhas planned and organized such protests, Doc. 2-1 at ¶¶ 7–8, and many of the individual \nplaintiffs have participated in vigils, rallies, protests, and other expressive acts directed \nagainst systemic racism and the Confederate monument.  See, e.g., Doc. 2-2 at ¶ 3; Doc. \n                                                 \n1 All references in this opinion are to the Historic Courthouse, not to the other, newer courthouses \nin Alamance County. \n4 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 4 of 16\n\n2-3 at ¶ 6; Doc. 2-4 at ¶ 3; Doc. 47-8 at ¶ 2; Doc. 50-1 at ¶¶ 2–6.  On some of these \noccasions, counter-protesters who favor keeping the monument in place have also \nappeared.  Doc. 2-6 at ¶¶ 20–21; Doc. 53-3; Doc. 52 at ¶¶ 26, 44; Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 8. \nThe Historic Alamance County Courthouse is located in the center of downtown \nGraham.  See Doc. 50-1 at ¶ 7; Doc. 48 at 2; Doc. 53 at 2.  It is a working courthouse that \nis open Monday through Friday.  Doc. 52 at ¶ 17.  The courthouse sits in the middle of a \nsquare, on a relatively small piece of land.  Doc. 50-1 at ¶ 7.  There are small open spaces \non each corner with what appear to be grass and trees, which the Court will refer to as the \ncourthouse grounds.  Id.; Doc. 52 at ¶ 17 (characterizing the space as “small ‘lawns’”).  \nThe courthouse and these grounds are surrounded by a sidewalk and parking spaces, \nwhich are themselves surrounded by what is essentially a vehicular roundabout.  Doc. 50-\n1 at ¶ 7.   \nHighway 87, also known as Main Street, enters and exits the square from the south \nand north, and Elm Street enters and exits the square from the west and the east.  Doc. \n50-1 at ¶ 7.  There are businesses and sidewalks around the outside of the square with on-\nstreet parking, and vehicular traffic circles the courthouse inside the square.  Id.; Doc. 52 \nat ¶ 19.  There is a small park, known as Sesquicentennial Park, on the northwest corner \nof the square, caddy-cornered from the courthouse.  Doc. 50-1 at ¶¶ 2, 6–7. \nThere are four pedestrian crosswalks providing access from the outer rim of \nsidewalks to the sidewalks surrounding the courthouse, one on each side of the building.  \nDoc. 50-1 at ¶ 7; Doc. 52 at ¶ 17.  The crosswalks are parts of the roadway accessible to \nmotor vehicles.  While the crosswalk space beside the monument cannot be “driven \n5 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 5 of 16\n\nthrough” because of the monument, it is part of the roadway, as the evidence shows it is \nvery close to a parking space and could be used by a vehicle to back out of the parking \nspace.  See Doc. 59-14.   \nThe only functioning entrance to the courthouse is on the northern side of the \nbuilding; this entrance has a wide flat area between the “RESERVED” space, see infra, \nand several very wide steps that ascend to the entrance.  See, e.g., Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 5; Doc. \n59-6. \nOutside of the northern entrance to the courthouse is a large Confederate \nmonument.  Doc. 50-1 at ¶ 7.  One of the crosswalks runs level with the street beside the \nmonument, connecting the sidewalk around the courthouse with the northwestern and \nnortheastern corners of the town square.  Id.; Doc. 59-15.  The monument itself is \nsurrounded by low concrete posts with links of chain running between them and a raised \ncurb which encloses small landscaped flower beds at the base of the statue.  Id. at ¶¶ 7–8, \nDoc. 59-12.  This is in turn surrounded by temporary, movable barriers that are about \nwaist-high.  See Doc. 59-12.     \nBetween the flower bed and the sidewalk outside the courthouse steps, there is a \npaved area level and in line with the parking space marked as “RESERVED” that is \nconsidered part of the courthouse grounds.  See Doc. 59-15.  Vehicles do not drive \nthrough this space, Doc. 59-1 at ¶ 9, which functions like a sidewalk.2  See, e.g., Doc. 54-\n                                                 \n2 The Court’s order denying the temporary restraining order found as a fact that “no \nvehicles travel” through this space and that “it is not used as a parking space.”  Doc. 57 at 5.  In \ntheir submission afterwards, the defendants did not contest or address this fact.  In their new policy, \nthe County Defendants say that this area is used as a parking space, Doc. 58-1 at 2, but there is no \n6 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 6 of 16\n\n9 at ¶ 6 (characterizing the entire area between the North entrance and the monument as a \nsidewalk.) \nHighway 87 is a state highway.  Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 3.  Elm Street is a city street.  The \ncourthouse, the grounds inside the sidewalks, the monument itself, and the small piece of \nland currently planted with flowers which surrounds the monument are owned and \ncontrolled by Alamance County.  Id. at ¶ 6; see Doc. 52 at ¶¶ 14–15.  The Alamance \nCounty Sheriff’s Office is responsible for law enforcement on courthouse grounds and \nother county property, Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 4, and the Sheriff and his deputies routinely police \nand manage access to the public sidewalks immediately adjacent to the courthouse.  Doc. \n52 at ¶ 15.   \nDemonstrations and protests have historically been held on the courthouse steps \nand in the spaces immediately outside and around the courthouse.  Doc. 2-9 at ¶ 7; Doc. \n50-1 at ¶ 18; Doc. 52 at ¶ 14; Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 7.  The courthouse steps and grounds and the \nsidewalks immediately surrounding the courthouse are a traditional public forum.  See \nDoc. 48 at 14; Doc. 53 at 9–10; Doc. 54 at 6.   \nAfter the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in May, protests \nnear the courthouse increased.  Doc. 52 at ¶¶ 6, 9–10.  In late May and early June, law \nenforcement in Graham and Alamance County became aware of news reports of violence \nand property damage during protests in Fayetteville, Greensboro, and Raleigh, larger \n                                                 \naffidavit  or  declaration  on  this  point,  nor  did  the  County  Defendants  address  this  in  their \nsupplemental briefing.  See Doc. 58.  Therefore, the Court has not changed this finding of fact.   \n    \n7 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 7 of 16\n\ncities not far from Graham.  Id. at ¶¶ 32–34; Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 9.  According to news reports, \nthese incidents included a fire that damaged the Guilford County Courthouse in \nGreensboro, Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 9; vandalization and rock throwing in Greensboro, Doc. 52 at \n¶ 33; property damage and looting in Raleigh, id. at ¶ 32; and unspecified violence and \nlooting in Fayetteville.  Id. at ¶ 34.  There is some evidence that there were a few threats \nof property damage in Graham, see id. at ¶ 49; Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 10; Doc. 52-1 at 5, but \nthere is no evidence of actual property damage in or around the courthouse square. \nAt some point around this time, the Alamance County Sheriff’s Office decided to \ndeny access to the grounds immediately surrounding the courthouse to all protest groups.  \nDoc. 54-9 at ¶ 11.  The Sheriff’s Office considers this to be a “temporary policy” \nintended to stay in place “during this time of heightened tension” and “while the political \nprocess plays out.”  Id.  The Sheriff’s Office considers this total prohibition to be \nnecessary in light of the violence and property damage in other North Carolina cities, the \ndifficulty in ensuring the safety of protestors and the public given the limited space on the \ncourthouse grounds inside the roundabout if two competing groups both wish to have \naccess to the location at the same time, and the need to prevent conflict on the courthouse \ngrounds from escalating into violence or destruction of property.  Id. at ¶¶ 9–11.   \nWhile the scope of the prohibition is not entirely clear, as best the Court can tell, \nthe Sheriff prohibits any protestors on the courthouse steps, the sidewalks immediately \nadjacent to and surrounding the courthouse, the space between the sidewalk and the \nmonument, the crosswalk beside the monument, and on or beside the monument itself.  \nSee Doc. 54-9 at ¶¶ 11, 13.  The prohibition remained in place for approximately two \n8 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 8 of 16\n\nmonths, though since the Court indicated a preliminary injunction was likely the \nprohibition has been somewhat relaxed.  See Doc. 59-1.   \nDespite the prohibition, individual plaintiffs engaged in protests or attempted to \nengage in protests.  See, e.g., Doc. 2-2; Doc. 2-9.  The protestors regularly gather in \nSesquicentennial Park, on the northwest corner of the square, Doc. 50-1 at ¶¶ 2, 6–7; \nDoc. 54-9 at ¶ 13, and, while not completely clear, the Court infers that protestors are \nallowed on the sidewalks on the outer rim of the square.  See Doc. 2-4 at ¶¶ 13–14.  \nProtestors have attempted to protest on the courthouse grounds but have been \nprevented from doing so on multiple occasions by Sheriff’s deputies and physical \nimpediments such as barricades put up by the County Defendants.   Doc. 2-4 at ¶¶ 3–13; \nDoc. 47-8 at 2–3; Doc. 59-19 at ¶ 2-3.  On multiple occasions throughout June and July \nand into August, the plaintiffs and other protestors have been explicitly threatened with \narrest, see, e.g., Doc. 2-5 at ¶¶ 2-10, or had access restricted, often upon implicit threat of \narrest.  Docs. 47-8 at ¶ 3; 59-18 at ¶¶ 6-7, 10; 59-19 at ¶¶ 5, 8.  Others have been arrested \nfor coming too close to, but not on, the monument or flower bed, or coming onto the \ncourthouse sidewalks or steps.  Doc. 52 at ¶ 46; Doc. 47-8 at ¶ 6; Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 14.  Doc. \n50-1 at ¶¶ 10–12.   \nDespite tensions between protestors and counter-protestors, the protests have been \noverwhelmingly peaceful.  Doc. 52 at ¶ 44.  Two pro-monument protestors were arrested \nfor simple assault and disorderly conduct on June 2, see id., two people were arrested \nfollowing a physical altercation on June 21, Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 8, and one person was arrested \nfor carrying a weapon at a protest.  Id. at ¶ 10.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of actual \n9 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 9 of 16\n\nviolence.  See Doc. 59-19 at ¶ 8.  There is also no evidence that any property has been \ndefaced or destroyed during any of the protests.  There have, however, been a few threats \nof violence, including the use of weapons, and a few threats to damage the monument on \nsocial media.  See, e.g., Doc. 52-1; see also 54-9 at ¶¶ 9–10.   \nAfter the Court indicated a preliminary injunction was likely and, inter alia, gave \nthe County Defendants time to plan, the County Defendants enacted a new policy \ngoverning the use of the courthouse grounds.  See Doc. 58-1.  There is no affirmative \nevidence in the form of an affidavit or declaration that the County Defendants will not \nreturn to a total prohibition on protests if the injunction does not issue, and the County \nDefendants have not contended that the motion for preliminary injunction is moot. \nThe plaintiffs contend this new policy remains overly broad and otherwise is \nconstitutionally infirm.  Doc. 60.  The defendants contend the new policy imposes \nreasonable time, place, and manner restrictions that are narrowly tailored.  But the only \nquestion raised in the pending motion is whether the total prohibition on protests should \nbe enjoined.  Whether the new policy violates the plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights is \nnot ripe for review; if the plaintiffs wish to challenge it, they will need to amend their \npleadings and file a new motion for preliminary injunction.   The Court expresses no \nopinion on the new policy.   \nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n  To obtain a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits; they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \npreliminary relief; the equities favor a temporary restraining order; and a temporary \n10 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 10 of 16\n\nrestraining order serves the public interest.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008). \nI.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nThe First Amendment prohibits the enactment of laws “abridging the freedom of \nspeech . . . or the right of the people to peaceably assemble . . . .” U.S. CONST. amend. 1; \nReed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015).  Under long-established First \nAmendment law, governmental entities are “strictly limited” in their ability to regulate \nprivate speech in public fora.  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 469 \n(2009); Davison v. Randall, 912 F.3d 666, 681 (4th Cir. 2019), as amended (Jan. 9, \n2019).  When the government maintains property which has been used as a traditional \npublic forum for the expression of opinions, the government is required to accommodate \nall speakers and may only restrict the time, manner, and place of speech.  See, e.g., Am. \nCivil Liberties Union v. Mote, 423 F.3d 438, 443 (4th Cir. 2005).  Such restrictions must \nbe content-neutral, narrowly drawn to serve a significant state interest, and leave open \nample channels of communication of the information.  Id.  “Additional restrictions such \nas an absolute prohibition on a particular type of expression will be upheld only if \nnarrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.”  United States v. \nGrace, 461 U.S. 171, 177, (1983). \n“Sidewalks, of course, are among those areas of public property that traditionally \nhave been held open to the public for expressive activities and are clearly within those \nareas of public property that may be considered, generally without further inquiry, to be \npublic forum property.”  Grace, 461 U.S. at 179; accord Occupy Columbia v. Haley, 738 \n11 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 11 of 16\n\nF.3d 107, 121 (4th Cir. 2013) (treating area outside South Carolina State House as a \npublic forum for First Amendment purposes); see also O’Connell v. Town of Burgaw, \n262 F. Supp. 3d 316, 320 (E.D.N.C. 2017) (finding the Pender County Courthouse \nSquare and its surrounding public streets and sidewalks was a public forum).  For \npurposes of this motion, it is undisputed that the courthouse steps, the sidewalks \nsurrounding it, including the paved “reserved” space between the sidewalk and the \nmonument, and the lawns at the courthouse corners are a traditional public forum.  See \nDoc. 54 at ¶ 18.   \nThe Sheriff’s long-term policy prohibits all protests on the courthouse steps, \ngrounds, and sidewalks, regardless of content, and in this sense it is content-neutral.  See \ngenerally Ross v. Early, 746 F.3d 546, 550, 552 (4th Cir. 2014) (finding a city policy that \napplied to all protestors was content-neutral).  The plaintiffs have not contended \notherwise for purposes of this motion.  See Doc. 48.   \nIt is highly doubtful that the Sheriff’s total prohibition on protests on the \nsidewalks, grounds, and steps of the courthouse, should it continue or resume, will \nsurvive scrutiny.  The Supreme Court has held that a total prohibition against protests on \nthe sidewalks surrounding a courthouse is unconstitutional where the prohibition does not \nsufficiently serve those public interests that are urged as its justification.  Grace, 461 U.S. \nat 181.  The Supreme Court acknowledged “the necessity to protect persons and property \nor to maintain proper order and decorum” within a courthouse’s grounds but noted that a \n“total ban” on protests which do not “obstruct[ ] the sidewalks or access to the Building, \nthreaten[ ] injury to any person or property, or in any way interfere[ ] with the orderly \n12 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 12 of 16\n\nadministration of the building or other parts of the grounds” is “no more necessary for the \nmaintenance of peace and tranquility on the public sidewalks surrounding the \n[courthouse] than on any other sidewalks in the city.”  Id. at 182. \nThe County Defendants contend that the need to prevent damage to the courthouse \nand to protect the public justify the total prohibition.  Doc. 54-9 at ¶11.  The County \nDefendants must show that the proffered harms are “real, not merely conjectural,” and \nthat the policy “alleviate[s] these harms in a direct and material way.”  Satellite Broad. & \nComm’cns Ass’n v. F.C.C., 275 F.3d 337, 356 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Turner Broad. \nSys. v. F.C.C., 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994).3  But here, just as in Grace, there is no evidence \nof any obstruction of the sidewalks or access to the courthouse.  There is no evidence that \nprotests have ever disrupted the ordinary functions at the courthouse or even that protests \nhave ever taken place at times when the courthouse is open for operation.  Like Grace, \nthere is no evidence that the plaintiffs here have threatened injury to any person or have \ninterfered with the orderly administration of the building.  There is limited evidence of a \nvery small number of vague threats of property damage, see Doc. 54-9 at ¶ 10; Doc. 52 at \n¶ 49, but it is not recent.  Likewise, the evidence of property damage in other cities and \ncounties is now many weeks old.  A total prohibition on protests on the courthouse \ngrounds is an extreme remedy, it is not narrowly tailored, and it does not sufficiently \nserve these proposed justifications.  Grace, 461 U.S. at 182. \n                                                 \n3 The Court omits internal citations, alterations, and quotation marks throughout this opinion, \nunless otherwise noted.  See United States v. Marshall, 872 F.3d 213, 217 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). \n13 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 13 of 16\n\nThe County Defendants also point out that the space around the monument, which \nis the focus of the protests, is small and that conflict is likely to result from allowing \nprotestors and counter-protestors access to the space between the monument and the \ncourthouse.  If that is so, and it appears to be, the County is free to impose reasonable \ntime, place, and manner restrictions on protests in this small space.  But a total, long-term \nprohibition is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction.  See Ward v. Rock \nAgainst Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 800 (1989).   The plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the \nmerits of their claim that the Sheriff’s total long-term prohibition on protests on the steps, \ngrounds, and sidewalks surrounding the courthouse is unconstitutional. \nTo the extent the plaintiffs contend that the narrow curb separating the monument \nflower beds from the street on the north, a parking space on the east, the area between the \nmonument and the sidewalk on the north, and the crosswalk on the west is a traditional \npublic forum, the present record does not support that conclusion.  There is no evidence \nthat the government has historically “made the space available—either by designation or \nlong-standing custom—for ‘expressive public conduct’ or ‘expressive activity,’ and the \nspace is compatible with such activity.”  Davison, 912 F.3d at 681 (quoting Am. Civil \nLiberties Union v. Mote, 422 F.3d 438, 443 (4th Cir. 2005)).  As to the crosswalk space \nbeside the monument, that is part of the roadway.  The evidence shows it is very close to \na parking space and could be used by a vehicle to back out of the parking space.4  As to \n                                                 \n4The evidence does disclose that Sheriff’s deputies prohibited access to the crosswalk by \nthe monument during a protest when the streets were closed to vehicular traffic.  See Doc. 47-8 at \n2-3.  The plaintiffs contend that the crosswalk should always be available for protest and have not \n14 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 14 of 16\n\nthe narrow curb separating the monument flower beds from the street and reserved space \nand as to the crosswalk beside the monument, the plaintiffs have not established that they \nare likely to prevail on the merits.   \nII.  Irreparable Injury \n“[L]oss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373–74 \n(1976).  The plaintiffs here have already been denied their First Amendment free speech \nrights for some weeks by the total prohibition of protests on the courthouse grounds.  The \nissues are matters of intense public interest and discussion in the here and now.  The \nplaintiffs are thus likely to suffer irreparable injury.  This injury is imminent and \nimmediate as the plaintiffs have ongoing plans for protests about and near the monument, \nthey have been blocked from accessing the courthouse grounds, and they have been \nthreatened with arrest if they attempt to pass through the Sheriff’s barricades.  There have \nbeen shifting enforcement practices recently as to the prohibition, but the total prohibition \nwas in place for weeks and there is no evidence it will not be resumed.     \nIII.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nAn injunction of a likely unconstitutional governmental practice ordinarily does \nnot harm the government, see Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th \nCir. 2002), and upholding constitutional rights “surely serves” the public interest.  Id.  \nThese factors favor a preliminary injunction against the total prohibition of protests. \n                                                 \nsuggested the County Defendants should be enjoined from restricting access to the crosswalk when \nthe street was closed.   \n15 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 15 of 16\n\nNo party took advantage of the Court’s invitation to submit language for an \nemergency exception.  The Court nonetheless concludes an exception is appropriate and \nin the public interest.  For example, if someone on the sidewalk had a heart attack and \nwas unresponsive, prohibiting access so emergency personnel could reach the person is a \ngood idea; one can imagine any number of exigent situations, however unlikely or rare, \nwhere a very short total prohibition would be necessary.  An injunction which enjoined \nthe defendants from acting in the face of such an emergency would be overbroad. \nTherefore, the Court will include an explicit provision that the injunction does not \nprohibit the defendants from “temporarily restricting access” to the outdoor Courthouse \nspaces “during short-term emergency situations.”  For clarity, even though it seems \nobvious, a protest, even a large protest, does not constitute a short-term emergency \nsituation; if it did, the injunction would be meaningless in the context of this case.   \nCONCLUSION  \n  The County Defendants imposed a total prohibition on protests in the traditional \npublic forum of outdoor areas surrounding the Alamance County Historic Courthouse.  \nThe total prohibition is not a time, place, and manner restriction, and however strong the \ngovernmental interests are, the total prohibition is not narrowly tailored.  The plaintiffs \nare entitled to a preliminary injunction, which will issue by separate order.  \nThis the 14th day of August, 2020. \n \n            ________________________________ \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n16 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 62   Filed 08/14/20   Page 16 of 16",

(HILL, WILLIAM) (Entered: \n08/04/2020) \n08/05/2020     TEXT ORDER issued by JUDGE CATHERINE C. EAGLES: The \nplaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits and \nirreparable harm, but the Court concludes in its discretion that the \nbalance of the equities and the public interest support denial of a \n\nTRO, to give the defendants a short period of time to implement \nreasonable time, place, and manner rules for access to courthouse \ngrounds, if they so choose. In the absence of immediate \nimplementation of reasonable restrictions or other material change of \ncircumstances, and subject to further briefing, the Court will likely \ngrant the motion for a preliminary injunction, as a long-term \nprohibition on protests on courthouse grounds traditionally used as a \npublic forum violates the First Amendment. Written order with \nspecific findings and discussion to follow by the end of the week. The \nCourt anticipates holding the record open for a week or so for any \nadditional evidence or briefing; a specific schedule will be set in the \nforthcoming order.

R. Civ. P. 65 and LR 65.1, Plaintiffs Alamance County Branch of \nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”), Tamara O. \nKersey, Colleen Tenae Turner, Terence Colin Dodd, Destiny Clarke, Annie Simpson, \nNerissa Rivera, Adam Rose, and Gregory Drumwright move this Court to temporarily \nrestrain and preliminarily enjoin Defendants from enforcing Art. VI, Sections 18-172, 18-\n174–181 of Graham, North Carolina’s Code of Ordinances (hereinafter, “The Ordinance”). \n1The Ordinance unconstitutionally (1) blocks two or more people who wish to protest—\nand even single individuals who seek to march while carrying a sign—in Graham from \ndoing so without a permit, (2) subjects those seeking a permit to vague and, in effect, \n                                                 \n1 Links to the City of Graham’s ordinances are available at \nhttps://www.cityofgraham.com/ordinances/ \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 7\n\n \ncontent- and viewpoint-based standards, and (3) severely restricts the size and conduct of \nprotests for which a permit is obtained. In support of this Motion, Plaintiffs state as follows: \n1.  The Ordinance makes it unlawful for two or more people to gather “for the purpose \nof protesting” or “making known any position or thought” anywhere in the City \nwithout first obtaining the Chief of Police’s permission at least 24 hours in advance. \nChapter 18, Art VI. §§ 18-172, 18-175, 18-178. \n2.  The Ordinance additionally makes it unlawful for any individual to parade or march \n“in or upon the public streets, sidewalks, parks or other public places” without first \nobtaining the Chief of Police’s permission at least 24 hours in advance. Chapter 18, \nArt VI. §§ 18-172, 18-175, 18-178.  \n3.  The Ordinance allows the Chief to limit even permitted gatherings to six people and \norder their dispersal upon any violation of the permit, no matter how small. Chapter \n18, Art VI. § 18-181. \n4.  The Ordinance also bans the exercise of any speech or assembly rights by minors \nunless they obtain the discretionary permission of the Chief.  Chapter 18, Art VI. § \n18-177. \n5.  Plaintiffs  are  organizations  or  individuals  who  have  recently  engaged  in  or \nattempted to engage in protests near the Alamance County courthouse in the central \nsquare of Graham, North Carolina, where a Confederate monument prominently \nstands.  Plaintiffs  seek  to  organize  and  engage  in  imminent  future  protests  in \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 7\n\n \nGraham, including as soon this July 4 weekend, but will not be able to do so without \nobtaining  a  permit.  The  Ordinance  impermissibly  burdens  and  violates  the \nconstitutional  rights  of  Plaintiffs  and  others  like  them  who  seek  to  protest  in \nGraham. \n6.  On July 2, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in this Court pursuant to 42 U.SC. § \n1983 alleging that the Ordinance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief. \n7.  As demonstrated in the attached exhibits and their brief accompanying this Motion, \nPlaintiffs  meet  all  four  requirements  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  and \npreliminary injunction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 and LR 65.1. \n8.  First, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Ordinance \nviolates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because: (a) it is not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve any compelling government interest; (b) it constitutes \nan unconstitutional prior restraint; and (c) it is not a reasonable time, place, and \nmanner restriction.  Plaintiffs are also likely to succeed on their claim that the \nOrdinance violates the Fourteenth Amendment because it is impermissibly vague.  \n9.   Second,  the  Ordinance  forces  Plaintiffs  to  choose  between  forgoing  their \nconstitutional rights to protest or facing arrest and fines, and thus imposes ongoing, \nirreparable harm on Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs show by their declarations attached to this \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2   Filed 07/02/20   Page 3 of 7\n\n \nMotion that they will suffer immediate and irreparable loss of their rights to protest \nthis weekend and in the days imminently following, necessitating that a restraining \norder be entered before Defendants may be heard in opposition. \n10. Third, entry of an injunction poses no harm to Defendants, as it would restrain \nenforcement of an unconstitutional law.  \n11. Fourth, an injunction would be in the public interest because it would uphold \nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights and enable them and countless other speakers to \nexercise their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights during the pendency of this \nlitigation. \n12. Plaintiffs’ counsel hereby certifies that they have attempted to provide notice to \nDefendants of this Motion by contacting the offices of the Graham City attorney \nand the Alamance County attorney by telephone and email on the afternoon of July \n2, 2020, and by emailing them the Complaint and the instant Motion, brief, and \nattachments contemporaneously with this filing. \n13. Plaintiffs should not be required to post a security bond because no harm, pecuniary \nor otherwise, will result to Defendants if an injunction is granted. See Pashby v. \nDelia, 709 F.3d 307, 332 (4th Cir. 2013) (“[T]he district court retains the discretion \nto set the bond amount as it sees fit or waive the security requirement.”); Planned \nParenthood of Cent. N.C. v. Cansler, 804 F. Supp. 2d 482, 501 (M.D.N.C. 2011) \n(“Given the lack of any monetary injury to Defendant, no bond will be required.”); \n4 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2   Filed 07/02/20   Page 4 of 7\n\n \nDoe v.

City of Clearwater, Fla., 607 \nF. Supp. 2d 1326, 1335 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (“Waiving the bond requirement is \nparticularly appropriate where a plaintiff alleges the infringement of a fundamental \nconstitutional right.”). \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n(a) Immediately enter an order temporarily restraining Defendants from enforcing \nthe Ordinance; \n(b) Set a date on which to hear oral argument on Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction; \n(c)  Preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Ordinance;  \n(d)  Order  Defendants  to  immediately  notify  their  officers,  attorneys,  agents, \nemployees, and other persons in active concert or participation with them, of any \ntemporary restraining order or preliminary injunction that is entered; \n(e) If a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is entered, waive the \nrequirement of a security bond; and \n(f) Order such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable.   \n \n5 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2   Filed 07/02/20   Page 5 of 7\n\n \nRespectfully submitted this 2nd day of July, 2020, \n/s/ Kristi L.

I am of legal age and competent to provide this affidavit. All the \ninformation herein is based on my own personal knowledge. \n \n2.  I am an adult African American resident of Graham, North Carolina, and \nserve as President of the Alamance County Branch of the NAACP. I am authorized to \nprovide this affidavit on the West Chatham NAACP’s behalf.  \n  \n3.  The NAACP has pursued its mission to ensure the political, educational, \nsocial and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and \ndiscrimination since 1909. Our branch has pursued a variety of strategies to carry out this \ngoal, including public education and advocacy, and, where necessary, litigation, for the \nbenefit of our members and our mission. \n \n4.   As part of that mission, our Branch has advocated for the removal of the \nConfederate monument located in front of the Historic County Courthouse in Graham, \nbecause it glorifies the legacy of slavery and racial oppression of African Americans in \nAlamance County. For that reason, our Branch joined Alamance and Elon University \nleaders in a written request to the County to remove the Confederate monument from \nGraham’s town square. We have also advocated for criminal justice, against racialized \npolicing of our communities of color, and against police violence against African \nAmericans in Alamance County and nationally.  \n \n5.  The NAACP is an expressive association that seeks to promote the interests \nof our members and equality for all people, free from racial discrimination. NAACP \nengages in expression, including protest, to advance the interests of our members and \nequality for all people, free from racial discrimination.  \n \n6.  NAACP has a direct and immediate interest in the issues presented in \nrecent protests of racialized police violence and the Confederate monument in Graham, \nand in the rights of our members to participate, now and in the future, in such public \ndemonstrations and protests against institutionalized racism, police violence and the \nConfederate monument-- rights enshrined in the laws and traditions of this state and \nnation, including the right to assemble with others and to freedom of speech and \nmovement. Those rights have been trampled through the City of Graham’s ordinance \nprovisions and so-called “State of Emergency” orders issued since the killing by police of \nGeorge Floyd in Minneapolis.  \n \n7.  Due to Graham’s permit ordinance and “emergency” orders banning \nprotest, our Branch has been forced to divert resources to assess, plan for and educate our \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 2\n\n \nmembers about public gatherings, demonstrations and protests which it has organized or \nin which its members wish to participate that would trigger unlawful conduct by law \nenforcement officers in Graham. We have also been deterred from exercising our rights to \nprotest.  We plan to nevertheless protest at the monument site this July 4, 2020, despite \nthe reasonable and justified fears many of our members have of being arrested and/or \nharassed. \n \n8.  That diversion of resources includes applying for a permit under the City’s \nordinance on June 26, 2020 for a gathering organized by faith leaders in Alamance County \nand the NAACP to protest the continued presence of the Confederate monument in \nGraham’s public square. We are concerned that the City’s delay in responding to our \npermit application will limit attendance and hinder planning for that event. We also \ndivert resources to hear from and talk with our members about their concerns about \ngetting arrested or harassed by Alamance Sheriff deputies and Graham police just for \ngoing out into the street with a “Black Lives Matter” sign or other message about the \nConfederate monument, white supremacy, racial justice or equal treatment. Our \nmembers are also reasonably concerned that if white supremacists / neo-confederate \ndemonstrators were to threaten or harass them on public property near the monument, \nneither GPD nor the Sheriff’s department would protect them. \n \n9.  The time and effort we have expended due to the unlawful permit \nordinance and repeated “State of Emergency” orders has reduced our capacity to plan \nevents and programming consistent with our organizational mission. The City, County \nand Sheriff Department’s actions are directly frustrating our capacity to fulfill our mission \nof effecting community and institutional change through peaceful public demonstrations \nin downtown Graham and at the Confederate monument site. \n \nThis the 2nd day of July, 2020, I affirm, under the penalties for perjury, that the \nforegoing representations are true and accurate.  \n \nBarrett Brown \n           \nBarrett Brown, President, Alamance County NAACP \n \n \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 2\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF TAMARA O. KERSEY \n \nI, Tamara O. Kersey, do hereby say under oath the following: \n  \n1.  I am of legal age and competent to provide this affidavit. All the \ninformation herein is based on my own personal knowledge. \n \n2.  I am an adult African American resident of Graham, North Carolina, \nAssociate Pastor of Wayman Chapel AME in Graham, and a member of the Alamance \nCounty Branch of the NAACP (“the Branch” or “NAACP”). I currently serve as the \nBranch’s Community Coordination Committee Chairperson. \n \n3.  I have wanted on a number of occasions, most recently in response to the \nkilling of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, to protest in Graham.  I have attended \nvigils, rallies and/or protests in Mebane and in Burlington against racist police brutality in \nthe wake the killing of George Floyd. I want to organize a protest, sponsored by the \nNAACP and faith leadership, in resistance to the feeling of a pall over the city of Graham \nstemming from national and local police brutality and to protest the continued presence \nof the Confederate monument in our public square. I desired to organize and/or join faith \nleaders and those with religious conviction on public property in Graham.  \n \n4.  However, because of Art. VI of Graham’s Code of Ordinances, which \nrequires any group of “two or more persons” gathering “for the purpose of protesting any \nmatter or making known any position or thought of the group or of attracting attention \nthereto,” I had to apply for a permit from the Graham police chief at least 24 hours in \nadvance. In addition, because of the additional authority given to the police under the \nMayor of Graham’s “Declaration of State of Emergency” on June 25 and June 27 to further \nrestrict people’s freedom of movement and ability to protest on public property, I have \nnot exercised my constitutional rights to assemble and speak out against injustice out of \nfear I will be arrested. \n \n5.  Before the City’s June 27 “Amended Declaration of State of Emergency” \ncame out, I petitioned Graham Police Department for a permit the morning of Friday, \nJune 26 to hold a \"Prayer in the Park\" in the Sesquicentennial Park in downtown Graham \nfor the dates July 18 or 25.  The park is approximately 30 feet across from the courthouse. I \nam organizing this event with other faith leaders in Alamance County and the NAACP. \nOur message at this event is to call on our local government and law enforcement officials \nto address their inequitable treatment of individuals who have gathered near the \nConfederate monument in Graham. Those government officials, City police and the \nAlamance County Sheriff Department have allowed neo-confederate demonstrators to \ncongregate with their firearms and other weapons on display, while anti-racist \ndemonstrators have been ordered to disperse. This is not only a threat to public safety, it \nis also a suppression of our constitutional rights in the public square. \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-2   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 2\n\n \n6.  In fact, the City’s June 25 curfew and June 27 prohibition on protests or \npermits looks to me to have been motivated by a demonstration that was to be held on \nJune 25 to protest racialized policing and the continued presence of the Confederate \nmonument. \n \n7.  As an African American resident of Graham, I experience the Confederate \nmonument as racist government speech. It venerates the Confederate States of America, \nwhose primary, if not only, purpose was to keep African Americans enslaved. The Graham \nmonument’s inscription celebrates the soldiers who fought to preserve slavery and \npromotes the mythical, racist and dangerous “Lost Cause” narrative. Because of where it is \nlocated, on the North side of the Alamance County Courthouse, the monument speaks for \nthe whole county, and the message is that the Confederacy should have been the victor \nover the United States in the Civil War to preserve slavery, that black people are inferior \nand should be enslaved.  \n \n8.  I would like to be able to join with others who feel as I do about this \nmonument to peaceably protest it without having to first seek permission from the same \ngovernment entities that engage in racially inequitable treatment of protestors, and \nwithout risking arrest. I plan to go to exercise my rights to protest at the monument on \nJuly 4, 2020, although I am fearful of being arrested and/or harassed.  \n \n9.  I have not received any response to my permit application, despite repeated \nrequests to the Graham Police Chief, which makes it impossible for me to plan the Prayer \nVigil for later this month. I also worry that the permit will be denied based on the \nordinance’s vague standards and the viewpoint I, the NAACP and my fellow faith leaders \nseek to express. It is a violation of my First Amendment rights for me to even have to \napply for this permit. For that reason, and to stop the City’s continued violation of my \nrights through it’s “State of Emergency” declarations that have been issued regularly since \nGeorge Floyd’s killing by police on May 25, 2020, I am suing the City of Graham. \n \nI affirm, under the penalties for perjury, that the foregoing representations are true \nand accurate.  \n \n \n          ________ \nTamara O.

My name is Colleen Tenae Turner and I am over the age of eighteen and am \ncompetent to provide the information that follows based upon my personal knowledge. \n \n2.  I have lived in Alamance County for almost my entire life. I went to Graham \nMiddle School. I graduated from Graham High School. During my time in the marching band, \nwe marched about the court square. It was a time filled with joy and happiness. When I was on \nthe courthouse square, trying to become Homecoming Queen, we rode around that same square \nand waved at the town.  \n \n3.  It pains me to know that I am not allowed to express my concerns for my \ncommunity in the same manner I once celebrated it. I sought to gather with others to express \nsupport for black lives, advocate for the removal of the monument and advocate for equally \nrepresentative government, and I was denied that right.  \n \n4.  I believe that all black lives matter, but not because I believe that any other \nperson’s life is less than, but because I recognize the underrepresentation of the black \ncommunity, even within the community. I recognize the struggle of all underrepresented people \nand their intersections, which includes women, LGBTQ+, the latinx community, the poor, the \nindigenous and the immigrant communities and others. \n \n5.   I believe the monument is a symbol for the white supremacy that oppresses us all. \nRemoving and placing the monument in a safe museum would be an important gesture of \nsupport against the white supremacy that is ingrained in our small community and in the broader \nworld.  \n \n6.  Since the killing of George Floyd, I have been feeling trapped. I have felt trapped \nwithin a system that will never cater to me. There is a sobering reality that at any point in time, \nthat could have been any black man in my life. It could have even been me. I did not feel relief \nuntil I was able to gather with others in protest. While protesting I found relief and comfort \nbecause I knew that gathered with others, we were being heard. \n  \n7.  I submitted an application for a group demonstration to the Graham City Police \non June 24, 2020 at 4:33pm. In my application, I requested a permit for a group of one hundred \nto three hundred (100-300) people to demonstrate at the Alamance County Historical Courthouse \nin Graham on June 27, 2020.   \n \n8.  On June 26, 2020 at 9:15pm, Graham Assistant Chief of Police, Kristy Cole, \nemailed me a document denying my application.  \n \n9.  The document stated multiple reasons for the denial of my application including:  \n \na.  an incomplete address;  \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-3   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 3\n\nb.  the potential for the demonstration to interfere with orderly movement of \nindividuals and property owner’s right to “enjoy peaceful occupancy and use \nof their property”;  \nc.   excessive diversion of police from other necessary duties; and  \nd.   that “[r]ecent events in Court Square on 6/20/20 has already placed business \nowners in fear for the safety of their property, as well as, their employees. We feel \nthat this event would further enhance the fear and concerns that they have.”  \n \n10.  On June 27, 2020, I submitted a new application for permit to demonstrate that I \nhoped would address the concerns outlined in the “recommendations” section of the denial email \nfrom my June 24, 2020 application.  \n \n11.  In this new application, I requested a permit for a demonstration on June 28, 2020 \nat the Alamance County Historical Courthouse from 6pm to 8pm for up to eight people, \nincluding one minor.  \n \n12.  The application included my complete address and stated that protestors would be \nsocial distancing at least 6 feet, wearing masks, and not yelling or chanting, though they would \nbe holding signs.  \n \n13.  On June 27, 2020 at 7:04pm, Chief Cole wrote to me saying I would “need to \nseek written permission from Alamance County to be on the grounds of county property” and \nasked me to resubmit my application with this written permission included.  \n \n14.  I replied that demonstrators would protest on the grass at the courthouse or on the \nsidewalk immediately adjacent to the courthouse.  \n \n15.  Chief Cole replied that she was unable to issue a permit for group demonstration \ndue to the June 27, 2020 State of Emergency. \n \n16.  Our nation takes pride in our freedoms of speech and assembly. It is something \nthat is typically used to show why our nation is greater than the next. We aren’t supposed to be \ndeprived of it, but Graham and the larger Alamance County found a way to strip us of the \nfreedoms afforded to us by the Constitution.  Graham’s ordinance requiring us to get a permit to \nprotest and their policies, and practices to stop protesting have blocked us from exercising our \nrights. We must now limit how we exercise our constitutional rights to only what the Sheriff and \nthe Police Department with allow. \n \n17.  This Fourth of July weekend, I would like to be able to spontaneously go with a \nsmall group of people (less than 10), and walk on the public sidewalks of Graham and the steps \nat the Alamance Historical Courthouse in Graham without having to first seek a permit from the \nCity of Graham, and without seeking the permission of the Alamance County Manager. \n \n18.  I am participating in this lawsuit because I want Graham and Alamance County to \nopen up the city of Graham and the courthouse grounds to peaceful demonstration. I want all law \nenforcement—including the Graham Police Department, the Alamance County Sheriff, and the \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-3   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 3\n\nState Police—to respect my right to demonstrate against symbols of government-endorsed white \nsupremacy such as the Confederate monument in front of the county courthouse in Graham. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on July 2, 2020.  \n           \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-3   Filed 07/02/20   Page 3 of 3\n\n \nAFFIDAVIT OF TERENCE COLIN DODD \n \nI, Terence Colin Dodd, do hereby say under oath the following: \n  \n1. I am of legal age and competent to provide this affidavit. All the \ninformation herein is based on my own personal knowledge. \n \n2. I am a Caucasian male resident of Hillsborough, North Carolina.  On the \nevening of June 26, 2020, I read online about communications from the Alamance \nSheriff's department and City of Graham about the City permit requirement for any \nprotest and the City’s “State of Emergency” refusal to issue permits. I was quite angered \nabout this, because it is my right to peaceably assemble and be on public property to \nexercise my First Amendment rights to protest. \n \n3. I wanted to protest the presence of the Confederate monument in Graham \nbecause it symbolizes white supremacy and the continuing suppression of the rights of \nAfrican Americans to be treated equally. So I drove to Graham the next morning, arriving \naround 5:30am on Saturday, June 27. I parked in a municipal lot downtown. I had \nprepared a poster sign that read “Black Lives Matter.”  I peacefully and calmly approached \nthe monument at around 6:00am.  My plan was to stay there with my sign for as long as I \ncould, and to use my mobile phone to videotape any encounter with law enforcement \nofficers. \n \n4. I coordinated with no one. I am not a member of any group, or affiliated \nwith any civil rights organization, although I support many civil rights causes when I vote.  \n \n5. As I approached the monument, I became very nervous as I saw the \nAlamance Sheriff Department cruiser parked on one side of the monument. I stopped \nabout 6 feet away from the cruiser, and a deputy in uniform promptly got out. \n \n6. I was nervous and my voice was shaking with emotion as I asked the deputy \nwhere I was allowed to be. I was completely by myself, so there was no danger to anyone \nor to any property, including the monument.  I thought if ever there was a good time to \nlet a citizen demonstrate freely, surely this was it, just one month after the killing of \nGeorge Floyd by police in Minneapolis. \n \n7. I had already stepped back away from the deputy, but he immediately \nordered me to step back further. He then walked towards me, and he was not wearing any \ncovering over his mouth and nose, which clearly demonstrated that he had no intention \nof protecting me or my health or my civil rights. \n \n8. I asked him to explain the ordinance or other legal authority that permitted \nhim to prevent me from demonstrating at the Confederate monument on the courthouse \nsteps. He did not answer me, but instead called on his radio for backup. At this point I \nnoticed that the red light and the green light on his body camera on.  \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-4   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 3\n\n \n \n9. Within seconds, it seemed to me, a half dozen squad cars joined us as well \nas a parade of Sheriff deputies.  I estimate there were eight to ten.  I felt overwhelmed and \nfearful in their presence, despite the privilege my race affords me. I just kept saying to \nthem, “Tell me the law, tell me what law I'm breaking,” and asking if I was under arrest. \n \n10. I asked who would arrest me if I refused to move. They told me Graham \nPolice Department (GPD). I told them to call GPD. At that point I reminded all of the \ndeputies that they needed to be wearing a mask, especially if they had any intention of \ngetting within 6 ft of me. \n \n11. A GPD officer soon arrived on the scene and eventually told me that   I \ncould peacefully walk on the sidewalk around the town square as much as I liked, but that \nI had to be alone, because if anyone else joined me, I would be in violation of the \nordinance.  \n \n12. I insisted on being allowed to be there with my sign near the monument on \nCounty property. \n \n13. I was very afraid for my safety. I stood my ground for a few minutes until \nthey gave me a 2-minute warning, threating to arrest me if I did not leave. Intimidated \nand angry, I retreated to the sidewalk across the street with about 30 seconds to spare. \n \n14. I spent the next three hours walking around the courthouse square. I was \nnot harassed further.  I left in my car shortly before 10:00 a.m.  \n \n15. I know I walked into the situation with a lot of privilege, but I did not feel at \nall safe, not one bit, having been forced by those law enforcement officers off of public \nproperty and restricted to the sidewalk around the square. The three hours I spent doing \nthat were some of the most stressful I've ever experienced. \n \n16. I am participating in this lawsuit because I want Alamance County to open \nup the courthouse grounds to peaceful demonstration. I want all law \nenforcement—including GPD and Alamance County and State Police-- to respect my \nright to demonstrate against symbols of government-endorsed white supremacy such as \nthe Confederate monument in front of the county courthouse in Graham. I intend to \nreturn to Graham to protest in the near future. However, I do not feel safe protesting \nthere because of the way the Sheriff deputies and Graham police officers treated me on \nJune 27, and because of what I have seen in the news and online about their very different \nand favorable treatment of neo-confederate demonstrators near the monument. \n \n   \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-4   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 3\n\n \nI affirm, under the penalties for perjury, that the foregoing representations are true \nand accurate.  \n \n \n \n    T.

My name is Destiny Clarke and I am over the age of eighteen and am competent \nto provide the information that follows based upon my personal knowledge.\n2. I arrived in downtown Graham, North Carolina on June 28, 2020 at approximately\n7:00pm. \n3. I exited my car and began walking alone and silently on W Elm St in Graham \ncarrying a “Black Lives Matter” sign. \n4. As I turned onto the sidewalk on NW Court Square, I was stopped by a Graham \npolice officer who threatened to arrest me if I did not leave the area. \n5. The officer told me that there was no protesting allowed and that I needed to leave\nor be arrested. \n6. I replied, “I don’t have to leave because it’s a public place and it’s before \ncurfew.” \n7. The officer persisted in threatening to arrest me if I didn’t leave.\n8. I offered to throw away my sign and then threw it away.\n9.  As I was throwing away my “Black Lives Matter” sign, the officer continued to \nthreaten to arrest me if I didn’t leave. \n10. Once I threw away my sign, the officer left. \n11. During the interaction, a family passed me, carrying ice cream, and the officer did\nnot interact with them or ask them to leave. \n12. I believe that I was being threatened with arrest specifically because I was \ncarrying a sign with a political message. \n13. I effectively was not allowed to walk alone on a public sidewalk in Graham solely\nbecause I was carrying a poster with political speech on it. \n14. I would like to be able to spontaneously take a small group of people (less than \n10), and walk on the public sidewalks and steps at the historic courthouse in downtown Graham, \nNorth Carolina without having to first seek a permit from the City of Graham in advance, and \nwithout seeking the permission of the Alamance County Manager.\n15.

My name is Nerissa Rivera and I am over the age of eighteen and am competent \nto provide the information that follows based upon my personal knowledge. \n \n2.  I am a fifty-nine year-old female Latina resident of Burlington, North Carolina. \n \n3.  On June 27, 2020 I was planning to go to a protest that was organized by Tenae \nTurner. I had seen the group demonstration announced on Facebook. \n \n4.  I had previously joined with another small group of people to walk around \nGraham in black T-shirts in support of Black Lives Matter in mid-June. \n \n5.  I oppose the Confederate Monument standing outside the Alamance Historic \nCourthouse in downtown Graham because it represents murder, inequality, and racism. It \nfrustrates me to see police officers wasting taxpayer money protecting the monument when there \nis real police work that needs to be done.  \n \n6.  I learned that Ms. Turner cancelled the demonstration because she didn’t get a \npermit, and didn’t want anyone to get arrested or injured.  \n \n7.  Then I learned about an announcement from the Alamance County sheriff’s office \nthat no more permits would be issued. \n \n8.  I decided to go to downtown Graham anyone and conduct a protest of one.  \n \n9.  I found out about a lunch meeting downtown to strategize. I met with a group of \nfriends. Some of them were members of an organization I belong to: Down Home North \nCarolina.  \n \n10.  The restaurant where we met was near the Historic Alamance County Courthouse \nin downtown Graham. \n \n11.  When we left, one of the Black members of our groups asked people to walk her \nback to her car because she didn’t feel safe.  \n \n12.  I joined a group to walk with her back to her car, and we walked in pairs, socially \ndistanced apart on the sidewalk together.  \n \n13.  We were not holding signs. \n \n14.  When we crossed the street, two law enforcement officers approached us and said \nwe could not protest. \n \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-6   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 2\n\n15.  Members of our group responded to the officers that we were not protesting, and \nexplained we were walking the woman to her car. \n \n16.  Officers said they would allow us to walk to the car, but would not allow us to \nprotest. Officers instructed us that if we started to protest they would order us to leave.  \n \n17.  We entered a local business owned by an African American woman, and then \nexited to walk our colleague to her car. \n \n18.  We walked a second time along the path we had just taken. \n \n19.  Officers approached again and ordered us to disperse. \n \n20.  Across the street, there were a group of white people with confederate flags. And \nwe asked the officers why the other group was not ordered to leave.  \n \n21.  Officers responded that they had not been instructed to concentrate on the area \nwhere the other group with the Confederate flags was located.  \n \n22.  I left the scene without being able to demonstrate with my group.  \n \n23.  This Fourth of July weekend, I would like to be able to spontaneously go with a \nsmall group of people (less than 10), and walk on the public sidewalks of Graham and the steps \nat the Alamance Historical Courthouse in Graham without having to first seek a permit from the \nCity of Graham, and without seeking the permission of the Alamance County Manager. \n \n24.

My name is Adam Rose and I am over the age of eighteen and am competent to \nprovide the information that follows based upon my personal knowledge. \n \n2.  I have lived in Alamance County all of my life, except for time spent in various \ncountries with the Army NC National Guard that I retired from in 2017.  I now reside in Graham, \nNC and am proud to call Graham home.  Graham and Alamance County have always strived to \npresent an image of welcoming and forward thinking, but recent actions have spoken louder than \nthose words.   \n \n3.  On June 2nd 2020, I was shocked to see in the media that 33 officers from the \nAlamance County Sheriff’s Office and the Graham Police Department arrived in response to a \ngroup of 8 citizens wanting to demonstrate and express their thoughts on current situations.  I \nbegan looking at the city of Graham’s handling of the situations that arose thereafter with \ncurfews being imposed on the city.  During the curfews, I rode through downtown Graham after \ncurfew. I saw that the curfew wasn’t being enforced, as there were police present and plenty of \nfoot and vehicle traffic, yet I didn’t see anyone being stopped.   \n \n4.  I began to question if the curfew was truly necessary or if it’s only purpose was to \ngive law enforcement another tool to use to arrest someone that they felt was a threat.  I \nattempted to present these concerns to the Graham City Council at their meeting on June 9th, \n2020.   \n \n5.  My comments didn’t receive any response and City Councilman Ricky Hall left \nthe meeting while my comments were being read so they weren’t even received by the full \nboard.   \n \n6.  On June 21, 2020 I saw Facebook posts calling for all “Patriots” to come protect \nthe Confederate Soldier monument.  On my way home, I rode through Court Square and was \nsurprised to see that numerous groups wearing Confederate flags, waving Confederate flags on \nmakeshift sticks, and with Presidential campaign flags were being allowed to congregate on the \nsidewalks around the monument.  I even saw that some of these groups were armed with pistols \non their hips.  I was confused by this because I knew that NC law prevented carrying weapons at \ndemonstrations and yet they were being openly carried around what constitutes a demonstration \nunder Graham’s ordinances.  After seeing this, it became apparent that various groups were \nhaving the laws applied to them differently.   \n \n \n7.  On June 26th, 2020 I heard that a Black Lives Matter group was planning an \nunpermitted demonstration in Graham, NC.  Soon after that I saw the Alamance County Sheriff’s \nOffice post on Facebook that there would be no permits to protest issued for the foreseeable \nfuture and that any group attempting to protest without a permit would be subject to arrest.   \n \n8.  This announcement struck me to my core.  I couldn’t believe that a government \nentity would so flagrantly deny protestors their First Amendment rights.   \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-7   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 3\n\n \n9.  At my first opportunity, I went to the Graham Police Department to immediately \nfile for a permit to protest because I felt I needed to express my thoughts to everyone possible \nthat this declaration was unconstitutional. \n \n10.  When I joined the Army, I swore to an oath to “Support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true \nfaith and allegiance to the same”.   \n \n11.  For 17 years I strived to live the 7 Army Values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, \nSelfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage that are so deeply instilled in everyone \nthat serves.  I’m not aware of an expiration date on my oath of enlistment and I can’t forget those \nvalues that I learned for so long just because I don’t wear the uniform any longer.   \n \n12.  The United States of America isn’t defined by where our borders fall on a map, \nit’s defined by the principles and ideology listed in the Constitution.  I can’t sit idly by and watch \nas those principles are eroded by government entities without letting my voice be heard. \n \n13.  I filed for a permit for a group demonstration on June 26th, 2020 with the Graham \nPolice Department.  I wanted to celebrate First Amendment rights and to protest the statement \npublished by the Alamance County Sheriff’s Office of banning demonstrations.   \n \n14.  Being that I knew there was a demonstration already planned for Saturday June \n27th, 2020 and that the process required 24 hours’ notice, I applied for a demonstration planned \nto take place on Sunday June 28th, 2020.  I chose 9:30 am to 10:30 am as there would be less \ntraffic on a Sunday morning and would be longer than the 24 hours’ notice required.   \n \n15.  I also chose a location of the corner of Main Street and Court Square as there is a \ngarden there that would allow pedestrian traffic to bypass the demonstration and travel \nunaffected.  I kept the number small at only 6 people as I thought that would be an easy number \nfor law enforcement to devote resources to and wouldn’t require too many resources in order to \nfacilitate. \n \n16.  I was told Lieutenant Duane Flood of the Graham PD would be in touch with me \nabout the approval or denial, and on Saturday June 27th, 2020 when I hadn’t heard from anyone \non the status of my application I called and left a voicemail with my contact information.   \n \n17.  On Saturday June 28th, 2020 Assistant Chief Kristy Cole of the Graham Police \nDepartment called me at around 8:45 pm to tell me that my permit had been denied due to the \nState of Emergency proclamation by the Mayor.  The accommodations I had made in my \napplication in order to help keep the demonstration as small and easy to facilitate as possible \nweren’t enough and they could not approve ANY permits for demonstration during the \nproclamation.  \n \n18.   Assistant Chief Cole offered to accommodate the demonstration after the \nproclamation was lifted, which I explained to her that this defeated the purpose of protesting the \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-7   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 3\n\nproclamation and showed the irony of their policy requiring a citizen to get permission of the \norganizations they feel are oppressing them in order to protest the oppression that they feel they \nare experiencing. \n \n19.  As a veteran that served my country honorably and was rightfully prevented from \nexercising my first amendment right to the fullest during that time, it is painful and humiliating \nthat after so many years of service the time that I decide to exercise my rights I am denied with \nno rightful justification.  Instead, the Court Square is turned into a defensive position and anyone \ntrying to exercise their rights are too intimidated to try because of the statements of law \nenforcement and by their overwhelming presence. My rights were denied based on the actions of \nothers and with me having no recourse in order to regain them in a timely manner. \n \n20.  In the words of one of our Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin, “They who can \ngive up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety”. \n \n21.  This weekend, I would like I would like the option to spontaneously go with a \nsmall group of people (less than 10), and walk on the public sidewalks of Graham and the steps \nat the Alamance Historical Courthouse in Graham without having to first seek a permit from the \nCity of Graham, and without seeking the permission of the Alamance County Manager. \n \n22.  I am participating in this lawsuit because I want Graham and Alamance County to \nopen up the city of Graham and the courthouse grounds to peaceful demonstration.

DRUMWRIGHT \n \nI, Gregory B. Drumwright, do hereby say under oath the following: \n  \n1.  I am of legal age and competent to provide this affidavit. All the \ninformation herein is based on my own personal knowledge. \n \n2.  I am an adult African American resident of Greensboro, North Carolina, \nProfessor of Communications at High Point University, a community organizer and social \njustice activist, and Senior Minister of the Citadel Church in Greensboro.  \n \n3.  On July 1, 2020, I applied for a permit for a peaceful demonstration to take \nplace at the courthouse square in Graham on July 11, 2020 to protest racialized policing \nand police brutality against Black people and our communities, and to protest the \nConfederate monument there.  Soon after emailing the permit application to the Graham \nPolice Department (GPD), I received an emailed acknowledgement of receipt of my \napplication stating that it would be forwarded to GPD Lieutenant Flood, who would then \nfollow up with me. \n \n4.   I later telephoned Lt. Flood, who told me that he had seen my application \nand would get back to me about it.   \n \n5.  Lieutenant Flood has not responded to my subsequent calls or otherwise \ngiven me any information about the status of my application.The delay is making it very \ndifficult for me to plan and make arrangements for our demonstration on July 11, 2020.   \n \n6.  Later on July 1, I called Graham’s Assistant City Manager, Aaron Holland, \nconcerning my permit application. Mr. Holland told me that Sheriff Johnson was not \nallowing any permits for protests to be issued. \n \n7.  I plan to go to Graham on July 4, 2020, accompanied by other community \nmembers who have been denied their civil rights, to demonstrate and protest peaceably \nin and around the courthouse square in Graham. These community members have \nwitnessed white people who want to keep the Confederate monument demonstrating in \nthe same public space without any interference by any law enforcement officers. \nHowever, the GPD and Sheriff deputies have ordered those of us who oppose the \nmonument because it glorifies the legacy of slavery and racial oppression of African \nAmericans in Alamance County to leave that same property.  \n \n8.   Based on the language of Graham’s ordinance and officers’ and deputies’ \ntreatment of those with a social justice message, I don’t expect to ever be granted a \npermit by GPD. In addition to protesting the Confederate monument and police \nracialized brutality, my message is also about the disproportionate numbers of African \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-9   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 2\n\nAmericans arrested, charged and convicted by Alamance County law enforcement and \ncourt.   \nThis the 2nd day of July, 2020, I affirm, under the penalties for perjury, that the \nforegoing representations are true and accurate.  \n \n \n       \n \n \nGregory B.

Kersey, Colleen Tenae Turner, \nTerence Colin Dodd, Destiny Clarke, Annie Simpson, Nerissa Rivera, Adam Rose, and \nGregory Drumwright, have moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 and LR 65.1 for a \ntemporary  restraining  order  and  a  preliminary  injunction  restraining  enforcement  of \nChapter 18, Art. VI, Sections 18-172 and 18-174 through 181 of the City of Graham \n(“City”), North Carolina’s Code of Ordinances (“the Ordinance”). Among other things, the \nOrdinance makes it unlawful for any person to gather with anyone else “for the purpose of \nprotesting” or “making known any position or thought” anywhere in the City without first \nobtaining the Chief of Police’s permission at least 24 hours in advance. Plaintiffs argue \nthat the Ordinance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution. \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 20\n\n \nAfter review of the declarations, documentary evidence, and briefing submitted by \nPlaintiffs, the Court will grant the motion for a temporary restraining order.  \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe Ordinance provides that “[n]o parade, picket line or group demonstration is \npermitted on the sidewalks or streets of the city unless a permit therefor has been issued by \nthe city.” Chapter 18, Art. VI. § 18-175. It defines group demonstration as “any assembly \ntogether or concert of action between two or more persons for the purpose of protesting \nany matter or making known any position or thought of the group or of attracting attention \nthereto,” parade as “any parade, march, ceremony, show, exhibition or procession of any \nkind in or upon the public streets, sidewalks, parks or other public places,” and picket \nline as “any persons formed together for the purpose of making known any position or \npromotion of said persons or on behalf of any organization.” Id. § 18-172.  \nTo enforce the Ordinance, the Chief of Police is authorized to:  \n(1) Require a written application . . . to be filed 24 hours in advance of such \nparade, picket line or group demonstration . . . \n \n(2) Refuse to issue such permit when the activity or purpose stated in the \napplication would violate any ordinance of the city or statute of the state, \nor when the activity or purpose would endanger the public health or safety, \nor hinder or prevent the orderly movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic \non the sidewalks or streets of the city. \n \n(3) Specify in the permit whether or not minors below the age of 18 years will \nbe permitted to participate. The chief of police or, in his absence, the next \nhighest ranking police officer of the city on duty shall pass upon whether \nor not minors below the age of 18 years shall be permitted to participate . . \n. and shall base his determination upon whether or not the purpose, time or \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 20\n\n \nplace of the participation will be detrimental to or endanger the health, \nwelfare or safety of said minors. \n \nId. § 18-178.  \nMoreover, the Ordinance provides that the Chief or other designated officer must, \n“among other considerations provided,” find as a requisite before issuing any permit that \nthe activity will not (1) “require excessive diversion of police from other necessary \nduties”; (2) “interfere with the right of property owners in the area to enjoy peaceful \noccupancy and use of their property”; or (3) “unreasonabl[y] interfere[] with normal \nvehicular or pedestrian traffic in the area, . . . prevent normal police or fire protection to \nthe public, [or] . . . be likely to cause injury to persons or property or provoke \ndisorderly conduct or create a public disturbance.” Id. § 18-179.  \nIf the Chief of Police grants the permit, he then has discretion to limit the protest \nor other gathering to “not more than six persons . . . [in] the entire width of [the] street or \nsidewalk within . . . 100 feet.” Id. § 18-181. During a permitted protest, parade, \ndemonstration, or picket, he has discretion to order individuals to disperse upon a \nviolation of any of the terms of the permit. Id. § 18-176. If individuals fail to disperse, \nthey may be subject to arrest under NC Gen. Stat. § 14-288.5. \nThe Ordinance also makes it illegal for any minor to be present at an expressive \ngathering without explicit permission from the Chief or other designated officer. It \nauthorizes them to deny such permission upon their own determination that attending \nwould be “detrimental to or endanger [the minor’s] health, welfare or safety.” Art. VI §§ \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 3 of 20\n\n \n18-177, 178. Each violation of the Ordinance is “punishable as a misdemeanor, subject \nto a fine not to exceed $500.” Ch. 1 § 1-12. \nIn their Complaint and in declarations, Plaintiffs assert that they regularly attempt \nto exercise their First Amendment rights to protest, assemble, and associate in Graham. In \nparticular,  Plaintiffs  describe  recent  efforts  to  protest  institutionalized  racism,  police \nviolence against Black people, and the continued presence of the Confederate monument \nin  front  of  the  Alamance  County  Historic  Courthouse  in  Graham.  Because  of  the \nOrdinance, however, Plaintiffs contend that their exercise of their First Amendment rights \nhas been impermissibly burdened and restrained. The Court summarizes pertinent parts of \nPlaintiffs’ allegations, as set forth in their sworn declarations, as follows: \n Plaintiff  Alamance  County  Branch  of  the  National  Association  for  the \nAdvancement of Colored People (“NAACP”) and its members seek to protest racialized \npolice violence and the Confederate monument in Graham. Due to the Ordinance, NAACP \nasserts it has been forced to divert resources to assess, plan for, and educate its members \nabout public assemblies and demonstrations in Graham, including by applying for a permit \nto protest the Confederate monument. NAACP says that it fears that its permit applications \nwill be denied due to the viewpoint it and its members wish to express. In addition, because \nthe Ordinance does not set forth a deadline by which Defendant Prichard or his designee \nmust respond to an application, NAACP asserts that it fears that any approval or denial will \nissue too close in time to the planned protest for them to sufficiently publicize and plan the \nevent. NAACP further states that some of its members plan to protest near the Confederate \nmonument on July 4, but fear harassment and arrest when they do so. \n4 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 4 of 20\n\n \nPlaintiff Tamara O. Kersey, who is from Graham, asserts that she has attended vigils \nand rallies elsewhere in Alamance County to protest police brutality in the wake of the \nkilling of George Floyd, but she has not protested in her hometown. She states that the \nOrdinance has placed her in fear of being sanctioned for doing so without a permit. Rather \nthan forgo exercising her constitutional rights, she states that she has subjected herself to \nGraham’s permit system, but is concerned that her request may be denied under the \nOrdinance’s subjective standards, and also that the delay caused by waiting for the City’s \nresponse will limit attendance and hinder her planned protest. She also plans to protest at \nthe Confederate monument on July 4, 2020, despite fears she will be harassed or arrested. \nPlaintiff Colleen Tenae Turner grew up in Alamance County and went to school in \nGraham. She asserts that she would like to be able to gather with others and protest there \nto raise her concerns with racism in Graham, to express support for Black lives, and \nadvocate for removal of the Confederate monument. She sought a permit for a protest in \nGraham on June 27, 2020, but Graham Police Department Assistant Chief Kristy Cole \ndenied her request in part because the protest might interfere with the orderly movement \nof individuals and with property owners’ rights to “enjoy peaceful occupancy and use of \ntheir property,” might divert excessive police from other necessary duties, and might \n“further enhance the fear and concerns that [local business owners] have.” Following that \ndenial, she sought a permit for a smaller gathering on that same day. Assistant Chief Cole \ndenied that request as well, on the basis of a State of Emergency order that the City has \nsince rescinded. Plaintiff Turner testifies that she intends to continue her attempts to \norganize permitted protests, but is concerned that the City will continue to stifle her efforts \n5 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 5 of 20\n\n \nand silence her voice. She would also like to be able to protest spontaneously at the \nmonument this July 4, 2020. \nPlaintiff Nerissa Rivera planned to attend the June 27, 2020 protest for which Ms. \nTurner sought a permit because she opposes the continued presence of the Confederate \nmonument in downtown Graham, which she sees as a representation of murder, inequality, \nand racism. After learning that the City denied Ms. Turner’s permit, Ms. Rivera decided to \ngo to downtown Graham and protest by herself. While in Graham, she met a group of \nfriends for lunch. As they were walking back to one woman’s car, they were stopped by \nGraham police officers who told them they could not protest and that, if they started to \nprotest, the officers would order them to leave. Plaintiff Rivera and her friends left briefly \nand then walked back along the same path. That time, the officers ordered them to disperse, \nthough Plaintiff Rivera, who is Latina, asserts that the police allowed a group of white \npeople with Confederate flags to congregate across the road. Plaintiff Rivera states that she \nwould like to spontaneously protest with a small group on the public sidewalks near the \nmonument in Graham this Fourth of July weekend, but is unable to do so due to the \nOrdinance’s advance permit requirement. \nPlaintiff Destiny Clarke lives near Graham and has sought to demonstrate in the \nCity to protest white supremacy, support the Black Lives Matter movement, and oppose \nthe Confederate monument near the Alamance Courthouse. On June 28, 2020, Plaintiff \nClarke walked alone in downtown Graham, silently carrying a “Black Lives Matter” sign. \nAs she neared the courthouse square, a City officer stopped her, told her that protesting is \nprohibited, and threatened to arrest her if she did not leave the area. Concerned that she \n6 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 6 of 20\n\n \nwould be arrested for exercising her First Amendment rights, Plaintiff Clarke offered to \nthrow away her sign, and subsequently did so. The officer then left. Ms. Clarke wants to \ncontinue protesting in Graham, but is reasonably concerned that she may be arrested or \nfined for doing so. \nPlaintiff Terence Colin Dodd asserts that he approached the Confederate \nmonument in front of the Alamance County Historic Courthouse around 6:00am on \nSaturday, June 27, 2020 with a poster that read “Black Lives Matter.” He alleges that one \nof Defendant Sheriff Terry Johnson’s deputies was in a squad car parked beside the \nmonument at the crosswalk. As Plaintiff Dodd approached the monument with his sign, \nthe deputy got out of the car, walked toward Plaintiff Dodd and ordered him to step back.  \nPlaintiff Dodd asked the deputy to explain the ordinance or other legal authority that \npermitted him to prevent Plaintiff Dodd from demonstrating at the Confederate \nmonument on the Historic Courthouse steps. According to Plaintiff Dodd, the deputy did \nnot answer him, but instead called on his radio for backup. A half dozen squad cars and \neight to ten Sheriff deputies subsequently arrived, causing Plaintiff Dodd to feel fearful. \nGraham police officers then arrived and told Plaintiff Dodd that he could not be on County \nproperty but could walk on the sidewalk across the street from the Confederate monument \nso long as he was alone, not with a group. Because he did not want to get arrested, Plaintiff \nDodd obeyed the officers and the deputies and walked alone on the sidewalk with his sign \nuntil close to 10:00am, when he left. \nPlaintiff Annie Simpson is a resident of Concord, North Carolina who asserts that \nshe has sought to organize protests in downtown Graham at the Alamance Courthouse to \n7 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 7 of 20\n\n \nprotest white supremacy, support the Black Lives Matter movement, and oppose the \nConfederate Monument situated there. On June 29, 2020, Plaintiff Annie Simpson called \nthe GPD to inquire about how to apply for a permit to demonstrate at the Alamance \nCounty Historic Courthouse. Assistant Chief Cole informed Plaintiff Simpson that she \nwould have to submit written permission from the Alamance County Manager’s Office \nalong with her application for demonstration permit in order to hold a permitted \ndemonstration at the Historic Courthouse. That same day, Plaintiff Simpson called the \nAlamance County Manager’s Office to inquire about the process of acquiring a permit to \ndemonstrate at the Alamance County Historic Courthouse.  Plaintiff Simpson says she \nwas told by the County Manager’s Office that no protests are allowed on courthouse \ngrounds.  \nPlaintiff Adam Rose asserts that he became concerned about police and \ngovernmental overreaction to peaceful protests in Graham in early June 2020. On June \n26, 2020 Plaintiff Rose filed an application for a permit to demonstrate at Historic \nCourthouse Square. Plaintiff Rose indicated he planned to attend with 5 others on June 28 \nfor a two-hour period.  On June 27, Plaintiff Rose was informed by Assistant Chief Cole \nthat his permit had been denied, and that no permits would be issued for an indefinite \nperiod of time.  \nPlaintiff Gregory Drumwright grew up just outside the city limits of Graham, and \nstill has family living there. He is a social justice activist and organizer, university professor \nand Senior Minister at the Citadel Church in Greensboro, North Carolina where he now \nlives. Although Plaintiff Drumwright subjected himself to Graham’s permit system for a \n8 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 8 of 20\n\n \nracial justice demonstration at the Historic Courthouse square on July 11, the City Assistant \nManager informed him that Defendant Peterman has disallowed the issuance of any \npermits for protests. Plaintiff Drumwright plans to go to the Courthouse square without \nseeking a permit on July 4, 2020 to peacefully protest with other community members.  \nOn July 2, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that \nthe  Ordinance  violates  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. That same date, they filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction. \nANALYSIS \n  To obtain a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims; they are likely to suffer \nirreparable harm absent preliminary relief; the equities favor a temporary restraining order; \nand a temporary restraining order serves the public interest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \nI.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \nPlaintiffs present three arguments: (1) The Ordinance is a content-based restriction \nthat does cannot survive strict scrutiny; (2) the Ordinance is an impermissible prior restraint \non  speech;  (3)  the  Ordinance’s  restrictions  excessively  burden  speech  and  are  not \nreasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, and (4) the Ordinance is void for vagueness \nunder the Due Process Clause. \nThe Court finds Plaintiffs likely to succeed on all four of these claims. \nA. Content-based restriction \n9 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 9 of 20\n\n \nThe First Amendment prohibits the government from “defin[ing] regulated speech \nby its function or purpose.” Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015). A law is \n“content-based [if] it applie[s] or [does] not apply as a result of content, that is, ‘the topic \ndiscussed or the idea or message expressed.’” Cent. Radio Co. Inc. v. City of Norfolk, 811 \nF.3d 625, 633 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting  Reed, 576 U.S. at 163). “[T]he Constitution \ndemands  that  content-based  restrictions  on  speech  be  presumed  invalid  and  that  the \nGovernment bear the burden of showing their constitutionality,” Ashcroft v. Am. Civil \nLiberties Union, 542 U.S. 656, 660 (2004) (internal citations omitted), by establishing that \n“the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that \ninterest.” Reed, 576 U.S. at 171.  \nHere, the Ordinance is content-based. The Ordinance specifically regulates those \nwho assemble “for the purpose of protesting.” Chapter 18, Art. VI § 18-172. And it \nexpressly  exempts  funeral  processions,  students  going  to  educational  activities,  and \ngovernment agencies. Id. § 18-173. Therefore, the Ordinance must survive strict scrutiny. \nThe Court finds that it likely does not. The text of the Ordinance shows it is aimed at \nlimiting protest. See, e.g., id. § 18-172 (defining “group demonstration” specifically to \ninclude those “protesting any matter”). That is not a legitimate, let alone compelling, \ngovernment interest.   \nEven if the City’s interest in the Ordinance were compelling, the ban on any protest, \nassembly, and parades by any individual or group anywhere in the City without a permit \nwould violate the Constitution because it is not narrowly tailored. As the Supreme Court \n10 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 10 of 20\n\n \nhas recognized, a total ban on expression on public sidewalks does not substantially serve \nany government purpose. See United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 182 (1983). \nThe Fourth Circuit’s opinion in Cox v. City of Charleston is instructive. There, the \ncourt struck down a city ordinance similar to this one on First Amendment grounds. The \nordinance  made  it  illegal  to  “organize,  hold  or  participate  in  any  parade,  meeting, \nexhibition, assembly, or procession . . . on the streets or sidewalks of the city” without a \npermit. 416 F.3d 281, 283 (4th Cir. 2005). While recognizing that “it may be true that the \npermit requirement succeeds in mitigating the potential of any of the activities listed in the \nOrdinance to threaten the safety, order, and accessibility of city streets and sidewalks,” the \nFourth Circuit held that “it does so at too high a cost, namely, by significantly restricting a \nsubstantial quantity of speech that does not impede the City’s permissible goals.” Id. at 285 \n(alterations, marks, and citation omitted). Recognizing this lack of tailoring, the Fourth \nCircuit held “that the Ordinance ‘burden[s] substantially more speech than is necessary to \nfurther the government's legitimate interests,’ and therefore facially violates the First \nAmendment.” Id. (Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989)).  The court \nalso held that “the unflinching application of the Ordinance to groups as small as two or \nthree renders it constitutionally infirm” and that “[s]pontaneous expression, which is often \nthe most effective kind of expression, is prohibited by the Ordinance,” id. at 285–86 \n(alterations omitted).  \nHere, the Graham Ordinance appears to share those constitutional infirmities, which \nhighlight the lack of sufficient tailoring. Accordingly, the Court finds it likely that the \nOrdinance violates the Constitution as a content-based restriction on speech.  \n11 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 11 of 20\n\n \n \nB. Prior restraint  \nWhile the Supreme Court has approved reasonable permit requirements for large \ndemonstrations, Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 574 (1941), “any system of prior \nrestraints” bears “a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.” Bantam Books, \nInc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963). “An ordinance that requires individuals or groups \nto obtain a permit before engaging in protected speech is a prior restraint on speech” and \n“the City bears the burden of proving its constitutionality.” Cox v. City of Charleston, 416 \nF.3d 281, 284 (4th Cir. 2005) (internal citations omitted).   \n“[A] law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint \nof a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing \nauthority, is unconstitutional.” Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 150-51 \n(1969). “It is settled [. . .] than an ordinance which [. . .] makes the peaceful enjoyment of \nfreedoms which the Constitution guarantees contingent upon the uncontrolled will of an \nofficial—as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted or withheld in the \ndiscretion of such official—is an unconstitutional [. . .] prior restraint.” Staub v. City of \nBaxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322 (1958)). Applying this standard in Shuttlesworth, the Supreme \nCourt invalidated an Alabama law that, much like the Ordinance, required a permit for \n“any parade or procession or other public demonstration.” 394 U.S. at 149. There, much \nlike here, the licensing authority could deny a permit if in “its judgment, the public welfare, \npeace,  safety,  health,  decency,  good  order,  morals  or  convenience  require  that  it  be \n12 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 12 of 20\n\n \nrefused.” Id. at 149-50. The Court held that this gave the administrator “virtually unbridled \nand absolute power.” Id. at 150.  \nHere, the Graham Ordinance requires a permit for any “parade, picket line or group \ndemonstration” gathering “for the purpose of protesting any matter.” Ch. 18, Art. VI §§  \n18-172, 175. The Police Chief has discretion to deny a permit if it endangers “the public \nhealth or safety,” hinders “orderly movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic,” id. § 18-\n178(2), or is likely to “create a public disturbance,” id. § 18-179(3). Moreover, the Police \nChief may limit gatherings to six people in areas with “normally heavy pedestrian or \nvehicular traffic,” or set another higher number if “in his judgment, conditions permit” it. \nId. § 18-181. The Ordinance does not provide notice for how long the permit review \nprocess will take or to require the government to provide a justification when a permit is \ndenied.  \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  the  Ordinance  invites  discriminatory  enforcement  against \ndisfavored views by authorizing the Police Chief to deny a permit where, in their judgment, \na proposed assembly will “require excessive diversion of police from other necessary \nduties,” without any objective standards. Plaintiffs further argue that this provision allows \nthe government to suppress views that officials fear will draw large crowds either of \nsupporters or counter-demonstrators, and they plausibly contend that they have in fact been \nthreatened and prohibited from protesting because of their support for racial justice and \nequality.  Accordingly, the Court finds it likely that the Ordinance places a prior restraint \non free speech in violation of the First Amendment.  \nC. Excessive Burdening of Protected Speech \n13 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 13 of 20\n\n \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the Ordinance also likely violates the First \nAmendment by burdening Plaintiffs’ speech with restrictions on their rights to gather and \nprotest  publicly  that  are  not  reasonable  “time,  place,  and  manner”  restrictions.  The \nOrdinance regulates speech in traditional public forums such streets, sidewalks, and parks. \nThese places have “immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out \nof mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thought between \ncitizens, and discussing public questions.” Hague v. Comm. for Indust. Org., 307 U.S. 496, \n515 (1939). In such spaces, the government may only impose “reasonable restrictions on \nthe time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions ‘are justified \nwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative \nchannels for communication of the information.’” Ward, 491 U.S. at 791 (quoting Clark v. \nCommunity for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984)).  \n “To prove that a content-neutral restriction on protected speech is narrowly tailored \nto serve a significant governmental interest . . . the government is obliged to demonstrate \nthat  it  actually  tried  or  considered  less-speech-restrictive  alternatives  and  that  such \nalternatives  were  inadequate  to  serve  the  government’s  interest.”  Billups  v.  City  of \nCharleston, 961 F.3d 673, 688 (4th Cir. 2020). “Absent such a showing, [courts] cannot \nsimply accept the City’s assurances that those other ordinances would be too difficult to \nenforce or would not sufficiently safeguard its interest.” Id. at 689. “Rather than enforcing \na prior restraint on protected expression, cities can enforce ordinances prohibiting and \npunishing conduct that disturbs the peace, blocks the sidewalks, or impedes the flow of \n14 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 14 of 20\n\n \ntraffic.” Cox, 416 F.3d at 286. “Cities can also pass ordinances that ‘regulate only the \nvolume, location, or duration of [protected] expression,’ rather than subjecting all speech \nto a permit requirement.” Id. (quoting Community for Creative Nonviolence v. Turner, 893 \nF.2d 1387, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). “At bottom, the legislative body can enact a permit \nrequirement that burdens expression only to the extent necessary to effectuate the city’s \nsignificant interests, and no more so.” Id. at 287. \nHere, as noted above, the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve a significant \ngovernment interest. The Ordinance presumptively bans all protest and assembly absent \ngovernment permission everywhere in the City, without any attempt to tailor the restriction \nto, for example, the level of traffic in a particular place. And because the Ordinance \nprohibits any expressive assembly or parade anywhere in the City  without 24 hours \nadvance notice to and permission from Defendants—and allow the City police to “establish \nlines for separation of the general public from [protest] activity,” thereby impermissibly \nremoving land from traditional public forum status at their whim—it does not provide \nalternative channels for communication. Finally, because the Ordinance allows the Chief \nto limit gatherings to six people for every hundred feet, it functionally bars any mass protest \nor assembly.  \nPlaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that the Ordinance excessively burdens \ntheir speech in violation of the First Amendment. \nD.  Void for vagueness \n“It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its \nprohibitions are not clearly defined.” Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 \n15 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 15 of 20\n\n \n(1972). Due process requires clarity in statutes and ordinances for two reasons. First, a \nvague law “fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes,” Johnson v. \nUnited  States,  135  S.  Ct.  2551,  2556  (2015),  and  second,  it  invites  “arbitrary  and \ndiscriminatory application” by failing to provide “explicit standards for those [government \nactors]  who  apply  [it].”  Grayned,  408  U.S.  at  108-09.  This  principle  applies  to \nadministrative, civil, and criminal prohibitions. See, e.g., FCC v. Fox Television Stations, \nInc., 567 U.S. 239, 253–54 (2012) (civil fines); Gentile v. State Bar, 501 U.S. 1030, 1048–\n51 (1991), (state bar rule); United States v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 128 F.3d 216, 224 \n(4th Cir. 1997) (environmental regulations).  \nWhere First Amendment rights are at stake, it is especially important that laws are \nclear. See Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. at 253–54. Vague laws threaten to chill \nspeech because they “inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone.” \nGrayned, 408 U.S. at 109 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, clarity is \nrequired “based in part on the need to eliminate the impermissible risk of discriminatory \nenforcement, for history shows that speech is suppressed when either the speaker or the \nmessage is critical of those who enforce the law.” Gentile, 501 U.S. at 1051 (citations \nomitted).  \nThe Supreme  Court has repeatedly held that  laws that  turn  on terms such  as \n“disturbing the peace” are void for vagueness. In Cox v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court \ndeclared unconstitutional a statute that prohibited “congregating with others with intent to \nprovoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may \nbe occasioned.” 379 U.S. 536, 551 (1965) (marks and citation omitted). Breach of the peace \n16 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 16 of 20\n\n \nstatutes are impermissibly vague because they condition legality on the reaction of the \nspeakers’  critics,  making  it  impossible  for  speakers  to  predict  whether  they  will  be \npunished for their constitutionally protected speech. See id. at 552. \nFifty years ago, the District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina struck \ndown another North Carolina city ordinance that was nearly identical to the Ordinance at \nissue here as void for vagueness. Underwood v. City Council of Greenville, 316 F. Supp. \n956 (E.D.N.C. 1970). In that case, the ordinance read: \n[T]he chief of police . . . may refuse to issue a permit to march, parade, \nassemble, picket or demonstrate in any way when and if he determines \nthat said activity would either constitute a clear and present danger to \nthe public health or safety or would ‘hinder or prevent the orderly \nmovement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the streets, alleys, or \nsidewalks.’ Further the chief or his designee may specify whether or \nnot  minors  will  be  allowed  to  participate  .  .  .  \n \n[A]mong other considerations, [the chief may] consider and find as a \nrequisite to issuance the following:  \n \n(1) the activity will not require excessive diversion of police \nfrom other necessary duties;  \n \n(2) the activity will not interfere with the right of property \nowners in the area to enjoy peaceful and lawful occupancy \nand use of their property;  \n \n(3) the  activity  can  be  conducted  without  unreasonable \ninterference with normal pedestrian or vehicular traffic in \nthe  area,  and  will  not  prevent  normal  police  and  fire \nprotection to the public, and will not be likely to cause \ninjury  to  persons  or  property  or  to  provoke  disorderly \nconduct or to create a public disturbance. \n \n17 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 17 of 20\n\n \nId. at 960. The court held that it was “[c]lear[]” that this law—which is nearly identical to \nthe Ordinance—was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give notice as to what is \nconsidered a permissible assembly, and it failed to cabin the police chief’s discretion. Id.  \nHere, neither the Police Chief nor Plaintiffs can know whether their acts will \nprovoke disorderly conduct or create a public disturbance. Like the ordinance declared void \nfor vagueness in Underwood, the Ordinance enables the Chief of Police to “[r]efuse to \nissue [a] permit . . . when the activity or purpose would endanger the public health or \nsafety,” Chapter 18, Art VI § 18-178(2), and permits are allowed only when the protest \n“will  not  interfere  with  the  right  of  property  owners  in  the  area  to  enjoy  peaceful \noccupancy” and “will not be likely to cause injury to persons or property or provoke \ndisorderly conduct or create a public disturbance.” Id. § 18-179(2)–(3). As in Cox and \nUnderwood,  it  is  unclear  how  speakers  or  the  Police  Chief  will  know  whether  a \ndemonstration will be likely to create a public disturbance or provoke disorderly conduct. \nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their \nDue Process claim as well.   \nII.  Irreparable Injury \n“[L]oss of  First  Amendment  freedoms,  for  even  minimal  periods  of  time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). \nAs the Court finds Plaintiffs likely to prevail on their First Amendment claims, the Court \nfinds them likely to suffer irreparable injury as well.  Plaintiffs’ injury is particularly \nimminent  and  immediate  preliminary  injunctive  relief  is  necessary  because  several \nPlaintiffs state that they intend to protest this weekend and fear being unable to lawfully \n18 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 18 of 20\n\n \nprotest or threatened with arrest if they do so without a permit. For these reasons, the Court \nfinds it appropriate to issue this Order immediately and without notice to Defendant. \nIII.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nWhile Plaintiffs will likely suffer irreparable injury without preliminary relief, \nDefendants  will  not  be  harmed  by  issuance  of  a  TRO. See  Giovani Carandola,  Ltd. \nv. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. 2002) (injunction of a likely unconstitutional law \ndoes  not  harm  the  state). Furthermore,  the  Fourth  Circuit  has  held  that  upholding \nconstitutional  rights  “surely  serves”  the  public  interest.  Id.  Plaintiffs  have  therefore \nsatisfied these factors.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order is GRANTED.  Defendants are \nhereby RESTRAINED from enforcing the Ordinance. In the Court’s discretion, the bond \nrequirement under Rule 65(c) is waived.   \nThis Order shall be in effect for 14 days. The Court will continue to review \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and will set a hearing prior to the expiration \nof this Order as it deems appropriate. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2), Plaintiffs shall \nprovide Defendants with notice of this Order and Defendants shall immediately provide \nNotice to their officers, attorneys, agents, employees, and other persons who are in active \nconcert or participation with them.  \n \n \n  This the ___ day of July, 2020, at ______________ AM/PM \n19 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 19 of 20\n\n \n \n            __________________________ \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \n20 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 2-10   Filed 07/02/20   Page 20 of 20",

Eagles, District Judge. \nThe plaintiffs move for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction \nrestraining the defendants from prohibiting protests in the immediate vicinity of the \nAlamance County Courthouse.  The plaintiffs are likely to be successful on their claims \nthat the County defendants are violating their First Amendment rights by prohibiting \nprotests on the steps, grounds, and sidewalks surrounding the Historic Alamance County \nCourthouse, and they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief. \nWhile it is highly likely that the Court will ultimately conclude that the equities and the \npublic interest favor a preliminary injunction, the Court concludes that they do not favor \na temporary restraining order.  The precise wording of the injunction needs further \nconsideration, and it seems advisable to give the defendants a short period of time to plan \nfor entty of the preliminary injunction and, if they choose, to develop reasonable time, \n1 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 1 of 19\n\nplace, and manner restrictions to protect public safety and county property during \nongoing protests on courthouse grounds.  Therefore, the motion for a temporary \nrestraining order will be denied and the motion for preliminary injunction remains \npending subj~ct to further evidence and briefing. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis ca~e began on July 2, 2020, when the plaintiffs filed a complaint and a \nmotion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directed towards \nenforcement of an ordinance enacted by the City of Graham that governed parade and \nprotest permits.  See Docs. 1, 2.  The plaintiffs are the Alamance County Branch of the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People and several individuals \nactively engaged iri protesting against a monument outside the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse in Graham, Nor:th Carolina.  Doc. 27 at~~ 14-22.  The defendants fall into \ntwo groups:  the City Defendants-the mayor, city council members, city manager, and \npolice chief for the City of Graham-and the County Defendants-the Sheriff, county \ncommissioners, and county manager for Alamance County.  Jd.  at~~ 23-36. \nShortly before a scheduled hearing, the parties agreed to a consent TRO enjoining \nenforcement of the contested City ordinance, see Doc. 11, which was entered.  Doc. 15. \nSoon thereafter on July 14, the City repealed the ordinance at issue.  Doc. 27-1.  The \nplaintiffs withdrew their motion for preliminary injunction, Doc. 23, as it had become \nmoot.  See Doc. 24. \nOn July 17, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint directed at what they \nallege are continued actions by the defendants to suppress their First Amendment rights, \n2 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 2 of 19\n\nas well as the rights of other protestors, by prohibiting protests around the Alamance \nCounty Courthouse and by imposing restrictions on protests by the repeated issuance of \n\"State of Emergency Declarations.\"  See Doc. 27 at~~ 5-10.  The pending motion for a \nTemporary Restraining Order was filed on July 28, 2020 and is directed towards both \npractices.  Doc. 4 7.  The City of Graham defendants filed a written response with \nevidence, Docs. 53, 53-1-53-4, as did the Alamance County defendants.  Docs. 54, 54-1-· \n54-9.  A hearing was held on July 30, 2020.  Minute Entry 07/30/2020.  Following the \nhearing, the plaintiffs filed a reply brief, Doc. 55, and the County Defendants filed a sur \nreply.  Doc. 56. \nAt the hearing, the plaintiffs clarified that the request for a TRO related to the \nEmergency Declarations was directed towards the City Defendants, and the request for a \nTRO related to access to the space immediately outside the courthouse was primarily, but \nnot exclusively, directed to the County Defendants. \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court denied the motion to the extent it was \ndirected against the City Defendants, based on facts found and reasons stated in open \ncourt; that aspect of the pending motion will not be addressed further here.  See Minute \nEntry 07/30/2020.  The Court took the motion under advisement to the extent it was \ndirected against the County Defendants, which this Order now resolves. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nFor purposes of this Order only, the Court makes the following findings of fact, \nafter consideration of all th<? evidence submitted.  As is necessary and in the context of \nspecific issues, the Court will address and find other relevant facts throughout this Order. \n3 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 3 of 19\n\nThe plaintiffs regularly attempt to exercise their First Amendment rights to protest, \nassemble, and associate in Graham, and recently they have organized, engaged in, or \nattempted to organize or engage in protests against institutionalized racism, police \nviolence against Black people, and the continued presence of a Confederate monument in \nfront ofthe Alamance County Historic Courthouse1 in Graham.  The Alamance NAACP \nhas planned and organized such protests, Doc. 2-1 at~~ 7-8, and many of the individual \nplaintiffs have participated in vigils, rallies, protests, and other expressive acts directed \nagainst systemic racism and the Confederate monument.  See, e.g., Doc. 2-2 at~ 3; Doc. \n2-3 at~ 6; Doc. 2-4 at~ 3; Doc. 47-8 at~ 2; Doc. 50-1 at~~ 2-6.  On.some of these \noccasions, counter-protesters who favor keeping the monument tn place have also \nappeared.  Doc. 2-6 at~~ 20-21; Doc. 53-3; Doc. 52 at~~ 26, 44; Doc. 54-9 at~ 8. \nThe Historic Alamance County Courthouse is located in the center of downtown \nGraham.  See Doc. 50-1 at~ 7; Doc. 48 at 2; Doc. 53 at 2.  It is a working courthouse that \nis open Monday through Friday.  Doc. 52 at~ 17.  The courthouse sits in the middle of a \nsquare, on a relatively small piece ofland.  Doc. 50-1 at~ 7.  There are small open spaces \non each comer with what appears to be grass and trees, which the Court will refer to as \nthe courthouse grounds.  !d.; Doc. 52 at~ 17 (characterizing the space as \"small \n'lawns\"').  The courthouse and these grounds are surrounded by a sidewalk and parking \nspaces, which are themselves surrounded by what is essentially a vehicular roundabout. \n' \nDoc. 50-1 at~7. \n1 All references in this opinion are to the Historic Courthouse, not to the other, newer courthouses \nin Alamance County. \n4 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 4 of 19\n\nHighway 87, also known as Main Street, enters and exits the square from the south \nand north, and Elm Street enters and exits the square from the west and the east.  Doc. \n50-1 at~ 7.  There are businesses and sidewalks around the outside of the square with on-\nstreet parking, and vehicular traffic circles the courthouse inside the square. !d.; Doc. 52 \nat~ 19.  There is a small park, known as Sesquicentennial Park, on the northwest comer \nof the square, caddy-cornered from the courthouse.  Doc. 50-1 at~~ 2, 6-7. \nThere are four pedestrian crosswalks providing access from the outer rim of \nsidewalks to the sidewalks s~rrounding the courthouse, one on each side of the building. \nDoc. 50-1 at~ 7; Doc. 52 at~ 17.  The only functioning entrance to the courthouse is on \nthe northern side of the building; this entrance is accessed by ascending a number of wide \nsteps.  Doc. 54-9 at~ 5. \nOutside of the northern entrance to the courthouse is a large Confederate \n' \nmonument.  Doc. 50-1 at~ 7.  One of the crosswalks runs beside the monument, \nconnecting the sidewalk around the courthouse with the northwestern and northeastern \ncomers of the town square.  !d.  The monument itself is surrounded by a small, decorative \nchain fence and a raised curb which encloses small landscaped flower beds at the base of \nthe statue.  !d. at~~ 7--,-8.  Between the flower bed and the sidewalk outside the \ncourthouse steps, there is a paved area level and in line with the parking spaces, but no \nvehicles travel between the statute and the courthouse and it is not used as a parking \nspace.  See id. at~ 7; Doc. 54-9 at~ 6.  For purposes of this Order, this paved area \nbetween the sidewalk and the monument is considered part of the sidewalk. \n5 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 5 of 19\n\nHighway 87 is a state highway.  Doc. 54-9 at \"J[3.  Elm Street is a city street.  The \ncourthouse, the grounds inside the sidewalks, the monument itself, and the small piece of \nland currently planted with flowers which surrounds the monument are owned and \ncontrolled by Alamance County.  !d. at \"J[6; see Doc. 52 at \"J[\"J[14-15.  The Alamance \nCounty Sheriffs Office is responsible for law enforcement on courthouse grounds and \nother county property, Doc. 54-9 at \"J[4, and the Sheriff and his deputies routinely police \nthe public sidewalks im111ediately adjacent to the courthouse.  Doc. 52 at \"J[15.2 \nDemonstrations and protests have historically been held on the courthouse steps \nand in the spaces immediately outside and around the courthouse.

The courthouse steps and grounds and the \nsidewalks immediately sUrrounding the courthouse are a traditional public forum.  See \nDoc. 48 at 14; Doc. 53 at 9-10; Doc. 54 at 6. \nAfter the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in May, protests \nnear the courthouse increased.  Doc. 52 at \"J[\"J[6, 9-10.  In late May and early June, law \nenforcement in Graham and Alamance County became aware of news reports of violence \nand property damage during protests in Fayetteville, Greensboro, and Raleigh, larger \ncities not far from Graham.  !d. at \"J[\"J[32-34; Doc. 54-9 at \"J[9.  According to news reports, \nthese incidents included a fire that damaged the Guilford County Courthouse in \nGreensboro, Doc. 54-9 at \"J[9; vandalization and rock throwing in Greensboro, Doc. 52 at \n2The Acting Police Chief testified that although the Sheriff of Alamance County contends these \nsidewalks are under County control, she does not actually agree that is so.  The evidence is not \nclear that the County owns the sidewalks.  The evidence is equally ambiguous about the paved \nspace between the sidewalk and the monument. \n6 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 6 of 19\n\n~ 33; property damage and looting in Raleigh, id. at~ 32; and unspecified violence and \nlooting in'Fayetteville.  ld: at~ 34.  There is some evidence that there were a few threats \nof property damage in Graham, see id. at~ 49; Doc. 54-9 at~ 10; Doc. 52-1 at 5; but \nthere is no evidence of actual property damage in or around the courthouse square. \nAt some point around this time, the Alamance County Sheriffs Office decided to \ndeny access to the grounds immediately surrounding the courthouse to all protest groups. \nDoc. 54-9 at ~ 11.  The Sheriffs Office considers this to be a \"temporary policy\" \nintended to stay in place \"during this time of heightened tension\" and \"while the political \nprocess plays out.\" !d.  The Sheriffs Office considers this total prohibition to be \nnecessary in light of the violence and property damage in other North Carolina cities, the \ndifficulty in ensuring the safety of protestors and the public given the limited space on the \ncourthouse grounds inside the roundabout if two competing groups both wish to have \naccess to the location at the same time, and the need to prevent conflict on the courthouse \ngrounds from escalating into violence or destruction of property.  Jd at ~~ 9-11. \nWhile the scope of the prohibition is not entirely clear, as best the Court can tell, \nthe Sheriff prohibits any protestors on the courthouse steps, the sidewalks immediately \nadjacent to and surrounding the courthouse, the space between the sidewalk and the \nmonument, the crosswalk beside the monument, and on or beside the monument itself. \nSee Doc. 54-9 at~~ 11, 13.  The prohibition remains in place to date and has. been in \nplace for approximately two months.3 \n' \n3 In their reply brief, the Plaintiffs refer to a July 31 announcement on the Sheriffs Facebook \npage prohibiting protest on the north side of the courthouse or anywhere else for the ftrst \n7 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 7 of 19\n\nUntil recently, the City of Graham had an ordinance requiring protestors to obtain \na permit from the city before they could protest in downtown Graham.  See Doc~ 52 at~~ \n7-8.  The Graham City Police Department was involved in the issuance and enforcement \nof the permitting ordinance.  !d. \nIn late June to early July, the City of Graham Police Department began either \nrefusing to issue any permits for protests, see, e.g., Doc. 2-7 at~ 17 (June 26 application); \nDoc. 2-9 at~~ 3, 6 (July 1 application), or significantly limiting such per.mits.  See Doc. \n52 at~ 9 (noting permitted protests on June 19, June 30, and July 1).  While not \ncompletely clear from the record, it appears that these denials or refusals to act occurred \nboth during a \"state of emergency\" proclaimed by the mayor and after the \"state of \nemergency\" ceased. \nDespite the absence of permits, individual plaintiffs engaged in protests or \nattempted to engage in protests.  See, e.g., Doc. 2-2; Doc. 2-9.  On June 28, a single \nprotester approached the vicinity ofthe courthouse with a protest sign and was threatened \nwith arrest by a Graham police officer if she did not leave the area.  Doc. 2-5 at~~ 2-10. \nOnce she threw away her protest sign, the officer ceased his threats of arrest and left her \nalone.  !d.  Another lone protester approached the courthouse at 6 a.m. on June 27, a \nweekend in August.  Doc. 55 at 1 n.l.

And, as the County defendants point out in their sur-reply, the brief \ndoes little more than characterize the post, rather than providing its language in full.  See Doc. \n56.  The Court has not considered counsel's characterization of the Facebook post, and the Court \nhas not accessed the post online. \n8 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 8 of 19\n\nSaturday, where he was surrounded by several Alamance County Sheriffs Office cars \nand eight to ten Sheriff deputies who threatened him with arrest if he did not leave the \narea.

Eventually he was allowed to protest on a nearby sidewalk, so \nlong as he was alone.  !d. at~~ 11, 14. \nAfter the consent TRO was entered on July 6 prohibiting the defendants from \nenforcing the parade permitting ordinance, Doc. 15, the City of Graham repealed the \npermitting ordinance ori July 14.  Doc. 27-1; Doc. 51 at~ 6.  Since then, protesters have \ncontinued to regularly appear at the courthouse square.  See Doc. 52 at~~ 9-10.  The \nprotestors regularly gather in Sesquicentennial Park, on the northwest comer ofthe \nsquare, Doc. 50-1 at~~ 2, 6-7; Doc. 54-9 at~ 13, and, while not completely clear, the \nCourt infers that protestors are allowed on the sidewalks on the outer rim of the square. \nSee Doc. 2-4 at~~ 13-14; Doc. 54-9 at~ 7. \nGregory D~umwright, one of the plaintiffs, obtained permission from the State \nDepartment of Transportation to close Highway .87 around the north side of the \ncourthouse on July 11 for the Burlington-Graham March for Justice and Community, \nwhich ended with a rally at the northern intersection of the courthouse square.  Doc. 27 at \n~ 187; Doc. 47-8 at~ 2; Doc. 52 at~ 20.  The City of Graham arranged for barricades to \nblock vehicular traffic so that the protest could safely take place.  Doc. 52 at~~ 20, 21, \n22, 42.  Graham City Police received information that counter-protestors planned to \nattend the July 11 protest in order to \"protect[] the Confederate monument,\" and there \nwas reason to believe these individuals would bring weapons in furtherance of that \npurpose.  !d. at~~ 37-39.  In advance of the protest, the mayor for the City of Graham \n9 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 9 of 19\n\nissued a State of Emergency Declaration on July 10.  !d. at~ 40; Doc. 53-1.  The. \nEmergency Order made it unlawful to ''disobey any barriers, warning signs or other \nstructures that restrict vehicular or pedestrian travel due to road closure, detours and/o  r \nhazardous conditions\" and prohibited the use of\"dangerous weapons\" and unlawful \nsubstances.  Doc. 53-1.  The Emergency Order was in effect for the July 11 protest and \nwas rescinded on July 12.  Doc. 53-4. \nIn advance of the July 11 protests, and consistent with its policy of prohibiting \nprotests on courthouse grounds, Sheriffs deputies blocked access to the monument, the \nsidewalks around the courthouse, the crosswalk, and courthouse grounds, using \nbarricades and police tape.

Protestors4 set up a stage in the street in \nfront of the monument.  !d.; Doc. 54-9 at~ 14. \nThe July 11, 2020 demonstration involved approximately 520 protestors and \ncounter-protestors.  Doc. 52 at~ 26; see Doc. 54-9 at~ 14.  When protestors arrived on \nthe morning of July 11, Alamance County Sherriff deputies were stationed around the \ncourthouse and informed protestors they were prohibited from accessing the grounds, \nsteps, and sidewalks.  Doc. 47-8 at~ 3.5 \n4 For clarity and brevity, the Court refers to individuals attending in support of the Burlington \nGraham March for Justice and Community as \"protestors,\" and refers to individuals opposed to \nthis demonstration and in support of keeping the monument as \"counter-protestors.\"  In the past, \nprotests have been arranged by the supporters of the monuments, and persons opposed to the \nmonument have been counter-protestors, \n5 The evidence is not clear about whether and to what extent Graham police officers also \ninformed protestors they were prohibited from accessing the grounds.  See Doc. 47-8 at~ 3; \nDoc. 52 at~ 14, 42.  · \n10 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 10 of 19\n\nA Graham Police Department officer escorted one protestor across the \"safety  · \nzone\" by the courthouse to retrieve something from a vehicle.

While there were threats of violence made by counter-protestors \nbeforeh;md on social media, Doc. 52-1, there is no evidence of any violence between the \nprotestors and counter-protestors at the July 11 event. \nOn Saturday, July 25, protestors, including some of the plaintiffs, demonstrated in \nGraham.  See Doc. 50-1.  Sheriff deputies arrested four protestors, including one of the \nplaintiffs.  Jd.  at~~ 10-12.  According to one of the protestors, he walked over towards \nthe monument and stood on the concrete curb separating the flower bed around the \nmonument from the crosswalk; a sheriffs deputy told him he could not starid there and \ninstructed him to leave the courthouse space; and when he refused, he was arrested.' Jd. at \n~ 9.  The charging document shows that the protestor was charged with loitering in the \n.  I \ntraveled portion of a state highway or street and resisting an officer who. was discharging \nhis duty to keep individuals from loitering on the street or highway. I d.  at 8. \nDespite tensions between prote'stors and counter-protestors, the protests have been \noverwhelmingiy peaceful.  Doc. 52 at~ 44.  Two pro-monument protestors were arrested \nfor simple assault and disorderly conduct on June 2, see id., two people were arrested \n11 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 11 of 19\n\nfollowing a physical altercation on June 21, Doc. 54-9 at~ 8, and one person was arrested \nfor carrying a weapon at a protest.  !d. at~ 10.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of actual \nviolence.  There is also no evidence that any property has been defaced or destroyed \nduring any of the protests.  There have, however, been a few threats of violence; \nincluding the use of weapons, and a few threats to damage the monument on social \nmedia.  See, e.g., Doc. 52-1; see also 54-9  9-10. \nat~~ \nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nTo obtain a temporary restraining order, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits; they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent \n'· \npreliminary relief; the equities favor a temporary restraining order; and a temporary \nrestraining order serves the public interest.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 \nu.s. \n7, 20 (2008). \nI.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe First Amendment prohibits the enactment oflaws \"abridging the freedom of \nspeech ... or the right of the people to peaceably assemble ....\" U.S. CONST. amend. 1; \nReed v.  Town ofG  ilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015).  Under long-established First \nAmendment law, governmental entities are \"strictly limited\" in their ability to regulate \nprivate speech in public fora.  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 469 \n(2009); Davison v. Randall, 912 F.3d 666, 681 (4th Cir. 2019), as amended (Jan. 9, \n2019).  When the government maintains property which has been used as a traditional \npublic forum for the expression of opinions, the government is required to accommodate \nall speakers and may only restrict the time, manner, and place of speech.  See, e.g., Am. \n12 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 12 of 19\n\nCivil Liberties Union v. Mote, 423 F.3d 438, 443 (4th Cir. 2005).  Such restrictions must \nbe content-neutral, narrowly drawn to serve a significant state interest, and leave open \nample channels of communication of the information.  I d.  \"Additional restrictions such \nas an absolute prohibition on a particular type of expression will be upheld only if \nnarrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling goverrunental interest.\"  United States v. \nGrace, 461 U.S. 171,-17?, (1983). \n\"Sidewalks, of course, are among those areas of public property that traditionally \nhave been held open to the public for expressive activities and are clearly within those \n·areas of public property that may be considered, generally without further inquiry, to be \npublic forum property.\"  Grace, 461 U.S. at 179; accord Occupy Columbia v. Haley, 738 \nF.3d 107, 121 (4th Cir. 2013) (treating area outside South Carolina State House as a \npublic forum for First Amendment purposes); see also O'Connell v.  Town ofB  urgaw, \n262 F. Supp. 3d 316, 320 (E.D.N.C. 2017) (finding the Pender County Courthouse \nSquare and its surrounding public streets and sidewalks was a public forum).  F oi: \npurposes of this motion, it is undisputed that the courthouse steps, the sidewalks \nsurrounding it, including the paved space between the sidewalk and the monument, and \nthe grounds at the courthouse comers are a traditional public forum.  See Doc. 54 at~ 18. \nThe Sheriff's policy prohibits all protests on the courthouse steps, grounds, and \nsidewalks, regardless of content, and in this sense it is content-neutral.  See generally \nRoss v. Early, 746 F.3d 546, 550, 552 (4th Cir. 2014) (fmding a city policy that applied to \nall protestors was content-neutral).  The plaintiffs have not contended otherwise for \npurposes of this motion.  See Doc. 48. \n13 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 13 of 19\n\nIt is highly doubtful that the Sheriffs total prohibition on protests on the \nsidewalks, grounds, and steps of the courthouse, should it continue, will survive scrutiny. \nThe Supreme Court has held that a total prohibition against protests on the sidewalks \nsurrounding a courthouse is unconstitutional where the prohibition does not sufficiently \nserve those public interests that are urged as its justification.  Grace? 461 U.S. at 181. \nThe Supreme Court acknowledged \"the necessity to protect persons and property or to \nmaintain proper order and decorum\" within a courthouse's grounds but noted that a \"total \nban\" on protests which do not \"obstruct[ ] the sidewalks or access to the Building, \nthreaten[ ] injury to any person or property, or in any way interfere[ ] with the orderly \nadministration of the building or other parts of the grounds\" is \"no more necessary for the \nmaintenance of peace and tranquility on the public sidewalks surrounding the \n[courthouse] than on any other sidewalks in the city.\"  Id.  at 182. \nThe County defendants contend that the need to prevent damage to the courthouse \nand to protect the public justifY the total prohibition.  Doc. 54c9 at ~11. The County \ndefendants· must show that the proffered harms are \"real, not merely conjectural,\" and \nthat the policy \"alleviate[s] these harms in a direct and material way.\"  Satellite Broad. & \nComm'cns Ass'n v. FCC, 275 F.3d 337, 356 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Turner Broad. \nSys. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994).6  But here, just as in Grace, there is no evidence \nof any obstruction of the sidewalks or access to the courthouse.  There is no evidence that \n0. \nprotests have ever disrupted the ordinary functions at the courthouse or even that protests \n6 The Court omits internal citations, alterations, and quotation marks throughout this opinion, \nunless otherwise noted.  See United States v. Marshall, 872 F.3d 213, 217 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). \n14 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 14 of 19\n\nhave ever taken place at times when the courthouse is open for operation.  Like Grace, \nthere is no evidence that the plaintiffs here have threatened injury to any person or have \ninterfered with the orderly administration of the-building.  There is limited evidence of a \nvery small number of vague threats of property damage, see Doc. 54-9 at 'If 10; Doc. 52 at \n'If 49, but it is not recent.  Likewise, the evidence of property damage in other cities and \ncounties is now many weeks old.  A total prohibition on protests on the courthouse \ngrounds is an extreme remedy, it is not narrowly tailored, and it does not sufficiently \nserve these proposed justifications:  Grace, 461 U.S. at 182. \nThe County defendants also point out that the space around the monument, which \nis the focus of the protests, is small and that conflict is likely to result from allowing \nprotestors and counter-protestors access to the space between the monument and the \ncourthouse.  If that is so, and it appears to be, the Comity is free to impose reasonable \n. time, place, and manner restrictions on protests in this small space. 7  But a total, long-\nterm prohibition is not a reasonable time, place, and marmer restriction.8  See Ward v. \nRock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 800 (1989).  The plaintiffs are likely to prevail on \n7 At the July 30 hearing, the County defendants suggested that they had not yet enacted a \nreasonable time, place, and manner restriction in part because the plaintiffs had not been willing \nto communicate with them about what restrictions would be agreeable to the plaintiffs.  It is the \ndefendants' obligation to act within the bounds of the Constitution, and the County defendants \ncannot prolong an unconstitutional practice because the plaintiffs have not told them how to \nconform to the Constitution. \n8 That said, it may be that when there is a short-term an' d immediate, real threat to property or \npersons, a total short-term prohibition may be appropriate.  But that is not the case here, and the \nCourt need not decide that issue. \n15 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 15 of 19\n\nthe merits of their claim that the Sheriffs total ongoing prohibition on protests on the \nsteps, grounds, and sidewalks surrounding the courthouse is unconstitutional. \nTo the extent the plaintiffs contend that the narrow curb separating the monument \nflower beds from the street on the north, a parking space on the east, the area between the \n· monument and the sidewalk on the north, and the crosswalk on the west is a traditional \npublic forum, the present record does not support that conclusion.  There is no evidence \nthat the government has historically \"made the space available-either by designation or \nlong-standing custom-for 'expressive public conduct' or 'expressive activity,' and the \nspace is compatible with such activity.\" Davison, 912 F.3d at 681 (quoting Am. Civil \nLiberties Union v. Mote, 422 F.3d 438,443 (4th Cir. 2005)).9  To this narrow extent, the \nplaintiffs have not established that they are likely to prevail on the merits. \nII.  Irreparable Injury \n\"[LJ oss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 \n(1976).  The plaintiffs here have already been denied their First Amendment free speech \nrights for some weeks by the total prohibition of protests on the courthouse grounds.  The \nissues are matters of intense public interest and discussion in the here and now.  The \n9 The Court does not understand the plaintiffs to contend that they have a First Amendment right \nto'protest on the monument itself or on the flower beds surrounding it.  There is no evidence in the \nrecord that the monument itself or the flowers  beds are a public forum.  Nor does the Court \nunderstand the plaintiffs to  contend that they have a First Amendment right to protest in the \ncrosswalk running beside the monument. If this is not correct, the plaintiffs can address it in the \nsupplemental briefing the Court is authorizing infra on the motion for preliminary injunction. \n16 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 16 of 19\n\nplaintiffs are thus likely to suffer irreparable injury.  This injury is imminent and \nimmediate, as the plaintiffs have ongoing plans for protests about and near the monument, \nas they have been blocked from accessing the courthouse grounds, and as they have been \nthreatened with arrest if they attempt to pass through the Sheriffs barricades. \nIII.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nAn injunction of a likely unconstitutional goverrunental practice ordinarily does \nnot harm the state, see Giovani Carandola,. Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. \n2002), and upholding constitutional rights \"surely serves\" the public interest.  Id.  On the \nother hand, the circumstances here are unusual.  The Court concludes in its discretion that \non these unusual facts, the balance of the equities and the public interest favor denying \nthe motion for temporary restraining order.  See In reSearch Warrant Issued June 13, \n2019, 942 F.3d 159, 171 (4th Cir. 2019) (noting the decision whether to grant preliminary \ninjunctive relief is within the discretion of the court). \nWhile there is no evidence that the plaintiffs will engage in illegal conduct \ninvolving counter-protestors or property damage, there is some evidence that others may \nnot share their restraint.  There is evidence that counter-protestors may seek to·harm \nprotestors or engage in violence.  See Doc. 52-1.  The paved area immediately behind the \nmonument, where protestors will most likely want to be, is quite small and is very near a \nwell-travelled roundabout in regular use by cars and trucks.  The evidence tends to \nindicate that some governmental management of access to thespace immediately \nadjoining the monument would promote public safety for drivers using the roundabout as \nwell as protestors and counter-protestors who might otherwise physically jockey for \n17 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 17 of 19\n\nspace.  Until very recently, the City of Graham had a permit requirement in place which \nrestrict(1d protests on the courthouse grounas to one group at a time, so the need for other \ntime, place, and manner restrictions only recently became ripe.  A short delay before \nentry of an injunction is appropriate to allow the defendants time to plan. \nIn addition, while the 'motion for preliminary injunction will almost certainly be \ngranted absent a change in circumstances, the specific terms of that injunction require \nfurther consideration.  Rule 65 requires that injunctions must \"describe in reasonable \ndetail ... the act or acts restrained.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d)(1)(B).  The language proposed \nby the plaintiffs refers only to \"Courthouse grounds,\" see Doc. 47-10 at 19, which does \nnot seem to be specific enough given the variety of spaces in and around the courthouse \nand the monument.  It may also be appropriate to include language which recognizes the \npossibility of an emergency situation.  The Court does not contemplate prohibiting the \ndefendants from reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.  Supplemental briefing \non the appropriate language will be helpful. \nIn view of the length of time the prohibition has been a place, the ongoing \nirreparable harm to the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights, and the fact that the existing \nbriefs largely address most of the issues, the Court will allow only a short period of time \nfor additional submissions on the motion for preliminary injunction. \nCONCLUSION \nThe plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the Sheriffs \ntotal prohibition of protests on courthouse steps, sidewalks, and grounds violates their \nFirst Amendment rights, and they have established irreparable harm if injunctive relief is \n18 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 18 of 19\n\nnot granted.  But on the quite unusual facts here, the balance of the equities and the \npublic interest favor a delay in the entry of injunctive relief so the defendants have time \nto plan and so that the precise wording of the injunction can be carefully crafted.  In the \nmeantime, a temporary restraining order should be denied.  Absent a change of \ncircumstances or other persuasive evidence or argument, the Court expects to grant the \nmotion for preliminary injunction.  A prohibition that has been in place for over two \nmonths and which the County defendants have shown no inclination to remove is not \ntemporary, and a long-term prohibition of protests on property that has historically been \nused as a public forum is not constitutional. \nIf any party wishes to submit additional evidence or briefing in connection with \nthe motion for preliminary injunction, it must be filed no later than August 12, 2020.  The \nCourt is particularly amenable to suggested language for enjoining l.anguage in the \nexpected preliminary injunction. If any party files such evidence or briefing, the other \nparty may file a reply brief and evidence no later than noon on August 14, 2020.  In the \nabsence of a change of circumstances or additional evidence undermining the Court's \nfactual fmdings herein, the Court contemplates granting the motion for preliminary \ninjunction against the County defendants. \nthe1~ay \nThis  of August, 2020. \n19 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 57   Filed 08/07/20   Page 19 of 19",

On  July  2,  2020,  Plaintiffs  filed  their  Complaint  challenging  the \nconstitutionality of Chapter 18, Art. VI, Sections 18-172 and 18-174–181 of the City of \nGraham, North Carolina’s Code of Ordinances (“the Ordinance”), which required any \ngroup of “two or more persons” gathering “for the purpose of protesting any matter or \nmaking known any position or thought of the group or of attracting attention thereto” and \nanyone at all “march[ing] . . . upon the public streets, sidewalks, parks, or other public \nplaces” to acquire a permit from the Graham police chief at least 24 hours in advance. The \nOrdinance gave the police chief complete discretion to limit gatherings to no more than six \nindividuals and deny permit applications based on the chief’s judgment that the gathering \nmight cause “a public disturbance,” and restricted all First Amendment-protected speech \nand assembly rights of minors absent discretionary permission by the police chief. \n2.  The July 2 Complaint alleged the Ordinance was an unconstitutional prior \nrestraint  on  First  Amendment  rights  to  free  speech  and  assembly,  violated  the  First \nAmendment’s prohibition against unreasonable and content-based time, place, and manner \nrestrictions of speech in traditional public forums, and was void for vagueness under the \nFourteenth Amendment’s due process provision.  \n3.  On July 6, 2020, this Court entered a Consent Temporary Restraining Order \n(DE 15) restraining Defendants Jerry Peterman, Frankie Maness, Chip Turner, Melody \n  2 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 2 of 46\n\n \nWiggins, Jennifer Talley, Ricky Hall, and Jeffrey Prichard (collectively, “the Graham \nDefendants”) and Terry Johnson from enforcing the Ordinance, and scheduled a hearing \non Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (DE 2) for July 20, 2020. \n4.  On July 14, the Graham City Council repealed Article VI of its Code of \nOrdinances.  See attached Exhibit 1. (All exhibits are incorporated by reference into this \nComplaint). Plaintiffs withdrew their Motion for Preliminary Injunction and the parties \njointly moved to cancel the July 20 hearing on that motion on July 15, 2020. DE 23. On \nJuly 16, the Court entered an order allowing Plaintiffs’ motion and canceling the July 20 \nhearing. DE 24.  \n5.  Notwithstanding  the  Ordinance’s  repeal,  and  as  pled  in  the  original \nComplaint, Defendants continue to prohibit and obstruct Plaintiffs and countless other \nspeakers from protesting in front of the Alamance County Historic Courthouse in Graham’s \ntown square (“Historic Courthouse” or “Courthouse”). Defendants have a current policy \nand  practice  of  prohibiting  protesters  from  speaking  or  assembling  at  or  near  the \nCourthouse, including on the sidewalk in front of the Courthouse and on the Courthouse \nsteps, despite a long tradition of allowing residents to assemble there. \n6.  Protesting in that location is central to Plaintiffs’ message because they seek \nto protest the continued presence of the Confederate monument in the public square, which \nglorifies the legacy of slavery, white supremacy, and racial oppression of Black people in \nAlamance  County.  Plaintiffs  have  protested  and  intend  to  continue  to  protest \ninstitutionalized racism and police violence against Black individuals and communities.   \n  3 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 3 of 46\n\n \n7.  This action also challenges Defendant Peterman’s repeated issuance, and \nDefendants Johnson, Maness, and Prichard’s enforcement via Sheriff deputies and Graham \npolice officers, of the so-called “State of Emergency” Declarations (“Emergency Orders”) \nwhich have severely limited the rights of protesters in Graham over the past two months. \nDefendant Peterman issued the first such order on May 31, 2020, prohibiting people from \n“gathering or demonstrating on any public street, sidewalk, or public property” between \nthe hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Many of these orders completely restricted the ability \nof  people  to  protest  in  Graham  during  several  weekends  in  June.  The  most  recent \nEmergency Order was issued on July 10, 2020, and restricted the activities of protesters \nwithin a six-block area surrounding the Confederate Monument and Historic Courthouse.  \n8.  On  July  12,  2020  the  City  of  Graham  posted  on  its  website  “SOE  – \nRescinded”; however, the text of that post reads: “Mayor Jerry Peterman has rescinded the \nDeclaration of the State of Emergency initiating the curfew for the City of Graham (June \n29, 2020).” See https://www.cityofgraham.com/soe-rescinded-july-12-2020/ (last accessed \nJuly 16, 2020).  \n9.  None of Defendant Peterman’s orders were or are justified by any actual state \nof emergency or imminent threat to public health or safety. They were and are instead \nmotivated  by  the  Defendants’  desire  to  prevent  individuals  and  groups  (including \nPlaintiffs) from protesting the Confederate monument, institutionalized racism, and police \nviolence against Black individuals and communities in Graham’s Historic Courthouse \nsquare.  \n  4 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 4 of 46\n\n \n10.  In light of ongoing and imminent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, including the \nongoing  threat  of  criminal  prosecution  and  civil  enforcement,  Plaintiffs  respectfully \nrequest preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to ensure immediate cessation of \nDefendants’ unlawful restrictions on and prohibitions of Plaintiffs’ protected speech and \nassembly rights. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this case arises under the U.S. Constitution and laws of the United States; and \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 because this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under \ncolor of state law, of Plaintiffs’ civil rights, and to secure equitable or other relief for the \nviolation of those rights. \n12.

Gen. Stat. § 153A-82 (4).  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Confederate Monument at the Alamance Historic Courthouse in Downtown \nGraham, NC \n \n37.  The Confederate monument outside the Historic Courthouse was erected in \n1914  as  a  result  of  a  coordinated  statewide  effort  of  the  United  Daughters  of  the \nConfederacy (“UDC”) to place Confederate monuments in public squares across the State. \n38.  Founded  in  1894,  the  UDC  raised  funds  for  Confederate  monuments, \nsupported Confederate veterans and widows, and promoted and published textbooks for \nuse in schools across the South. \n39.  The  UDC  also  advanced  and  supported  a  political  white  supremacy \ncampaign which disenfranchised and terrorized Black people.   \n40.  The UDC officially recognized the Ku Klux Klan for its role in helping to \nrestore southern home rule and advance white supremacy.    \n41.  The UDC’s objective was to vindicate and glorify the Confederacy and to \npromote the “Lost Cause” mythology, a false historical narrative which downplayed the \nharm and significance of slavery and promoted policies of racial segregation and white \nsupremacy.   \n  12 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 12 of 46\n\n \n42.  According to the inscription on the Confederate monument in Graham, it was \n“erected through the efforts of the Graham Chapter” of the UDC. The total cost for the \nmonument was $2,100, plus an additional $305 for the mound, post, chain, and curbing \nenclosure surrounding the monument. On January 5, 1914, the Alamance County Board of \nCommissioners appropriated $1,000 to contribute to the project.  \n43.  Upon information and belief, the Graham Chapter of the UDC covered the \nmajority of the costs for the project. \n44.  Confederate  veteran  Jacob  A.  Long—who  founded  Alamance  County’s \nbranch of the Ku Klux Klan and participated in the 1870 lynching of Wyatt Outlaw, a \nprominent Black councilman in Graham, in the courthouse square where the monument \nstands today—spoke at the May 1914 dedication of  the monument. Long told those \nattending that they shared “a common interest: to recall the achievements of the great and \ngood of our own race and blood.” \n45.  The  monument consists of a statue of a Confederate soldier. There are \ncrossed Confederate  battle  flags on the front of the shaft. In addition to the  above-\nreferenced  inscription  attributed  to  the  UDC,  the  monument  contains  the  following \ninscriptions:  \n(a) “To  Commemorate  With  Grateful  Love  the  Patriotism,  Valor,  and \nDevotion  to  Duty,  of  the  Brave  Soldiers  of  Alamance  County,  Our \nConfederate Soldiers” \n  13 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 13 of 46\n\n \n(b) “On Fame’s Eternal Camping Ground, Their Silent Tents are Spread, and \nGlory Guards, with Solemn Round, the Bivouac of the Dead.\" \n(c) “Faithful Unto Death, They are Crowned with Immortal Glory.\"  \nOpposition to the Confederate Monument at the Historic Courthouse \n46.  Groups of pro-Confederate demonstrators gather in front of the Confederate \nmonument annually in May to celebrate Confederate Memorial Day. They are often met \nby  individuals  who  oppose  the  Confederate  monument’s  presence  in  the  Historic \nCourthouse square and the neo-confederate white supremacist ideology. \n47.  Anti-racism protesters have gathered at the Historic Courthouse in greater \nfrequency and in greater numbers since 2015, after white supremacist Dylann Roof, under \nthe banner of the Confederate  flag,  murdered  nine  Black people  worshipping at  the \nEmanuel Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina on June \n17, 2015.   \n48.  The  murders  sparked  a  new  national  discussion  around  Confederate \nmonuments, and many states and municipalities began removing them. \n49.  However, the North Carolina General Assembly instead passed a law in 2015 \npreventing  local  governments  from  moving  any  government-owned  “object  of \nremembrance” located on public property. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 100-2.1.   \n50.  Recently, the Mayor of Burlington, fifty other elected officials, Plaintiff \nNAACP,  and  other  community  leaders  called  for  the  relocation  of  the  Confederate \n  14 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 14 of 46\n\n \nmonument from the Historic Courthouse grounds because of the risk it poses to public \nsafety and because of its white supremacist message.   \nNationwide Protests After the Killing of George Floyd \n51.  On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis Police Department officer, \nknelt on the neck of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for nearly nine minutes, \nkilling him. Mr. Floyd died as three other officers looked on. The police killing of Mr. \nFloyd sparked protests in more than 2,000 cities and towns and over 60 countries in support \nof the Black Lives Matter movement. \nDefendants’ Weekend “State of Emergency” Orders \n52.  As the protests in response to Mr. Floyd’s death and against police violence \nspread nationwide, Defendant Peterman began regularly issuing “State of Emergency \nDeclarations” (“Emergency Orders”) to suppress such protests. \nMay 31-June 1, 2020 Emergency Order \n53.  On May 31, Defendant Peterman issued the first such Emergency Order, \nwhich was publicized via a press release on the City’s website, stating that it was “due to \nthe potential for damage or injury, due to civil unrest.” See Exhibit 2, May 31 Emergency \nOrder.  \n54.  Defendant Peterman did not cite any examples of threatened or actual civil \nunrest, damage to property or injury in its municipal city limits. Id. \n55.  In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nMay 31, 2020. \n  15 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 15 of 46\n\n \n56.  Defendant Peterman’s May 31 order included the following restrictions: \n(a) Restricted Access: It shall be unlawful to disobey any barriers, warning \nsigns or other structures that restrict vehicular or pedestrian travel due to \nroad closure, detours, hazards, etc. \n(b) Furthermore, this declaration denies or restricts access to areas, streets, \nhighways or locations within the City in which that restriction or denial \nof access or use is reasonably necessary to promote efforts being made to \novercome  the  emergency  or  to  prevent  further  aggravation  of  the \nemergency. \nId. \n \n57.  On May 31, the Mayor amended the order to include the following additional \nterms, publicized by the City of Graham in a notice on its website: \n(a) A  curfew  of  9  p.m.  with  the  exception  of  Public  Safety  personnel, \nDoctors, Nurses and such other classes of persons as may be essential to \nthe preservation of public order  and immediately necessary to serve \nsafety, health and welfare needs of the people within the City; \n(b) a prohibition against travel to or within the Fire Limits as prescribed in \nSection 6-31 of the City of Graham Code of Ordinances; \n(c) a prohibition against the possession, transportation, sale, purchase, and \nconsumption of alcoholic beverages away from one’s own premises; \n(d) a prohibition against the use of dangerous weapons and substances unless \npermitted or exempted by Section 2-54(4) of the City of Graham Code of \nOrdinances or application General Statute. \n \nSee Exhibit 3, May 31 Amended Emergency Order. \n \n58.  On  June  1,  2020,  the  Mayor  lifted  the  order  and  curfew  effective \nimmediately,  as  announced  by  the  City  of  Graham  on  its  website, \nhttps://www.cityofgraham.com/. \nJune 4–June 9, 2020 Emergency Order \n59.  On June 4, 2020 at 9:01 p.m., the City of Graham posted a press release on \nits  website  announcing  another  order  by  Defendant  Peterman  restricting  people’s \n  16 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 16 of 46\n\n \nmovement “due to the potential for widespread or severe damage, injury, loss of life or \nproperty due to civil unrest.” See Exhibit 4, June 4 Emergency Order. \n60.  Neither Defendant Peterman nor the City cited any examples of threatened \nor actual civil unrest, damage to property or injury within the municipal city limits. Id. \n61.  In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nJune 4, 2020. \n62.  Defendant Peterman’s order stated that it would “remain in effect until June \n9 at 6 a.m. unless it is rescinded prior.” Id. \n63.  The June 4 Emergency Order included restrictions and conditions identical \nto the amended May 31-June 1 Amended Emergency Order with two amendments: \n(a) Extending the curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Id. \n(b) Clarifying  that  “citizens  traveling  to  or  from  places  of  employment”  were \nexempted from the curfew. Id. \n64.  On June 5, 2020, the City of Graham posted an “FAQ sheet” about the curfew \nand order on its website. See Exhibit 5, June 5 FAQ for June 4 Emergency Order. The FAQ \nincluded additional restrictions that were not explicitly included in the written order: \n(a) The curfew prohibits anyone within the City of Graham, between the \nhours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., from gathering or demonstrating on any public \nstreet, sidewalk, or public property. \n(b) It also prohibits travel upon any public street unless it is for the purpose \nof seeking medical care, food, or other necessities for yourself or a family \nmember. \n(c) Violation of the curfew is punishable as a class 2 misdemeanor. \n(d) All businesses are permitted to remain open during the nightly curfew if \nthey choose to do so. \n(e) Unnecessary additional travel or lingering in public space is prohibited. \n  17 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 17 of 46\n\n \n \nId. \n \n65.  On June 5, 2020 at 4:52 p.m., the City of Graham posted a comment on its \nofficial Facebook page, alongside a photo of the order, that “[p]reventative actions are \nbeing taken to manage the potential for widespread damage, injury, or loss of life or \nproperty due to civil unrest.” See Exhibit 6, June 5 Facebook Comment.  \n66.  On  June  5,  2020,  the  City  of  Graham  posted  a  letter  from  Defendant \nPeterman to its website. See Exhibit 7, Letter from Peterman. This letter included the \nfollowing statement regarding the State of Emergency: \nThere are several instances where a State of Emergency is declared in advance \nand disseminated with an excess of time. For events such as hurricanes or winter \nstorms, we often have days to prepare based on scientific forecasts. The threat \nof civil unrest is generally not a planned instance shared with the City. The \npriority of notice in these types of circumstances quickly creates the scenario of \nemergency management. \n \nId. \n \n67.  On June 9, 2020, the City of Graham posted to its website that the order had \nbeen rescinded. See Exhibit 8, June 9 Rescinded Order.  \nJune 20–June 22, 2020 Emergency Order \n68.

In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nJune 25, 2020. \n76.  This June 25 order was identical to the June 20 order. Id. \n77.  On June 26, 2020 at 12:00 p.m., the Alamance County Sheriff posted on his \nofficial Facebook page the following: “[E]ffective June 26, 2020, no permits to protest in \nthe city of Graham, NC to include the Alamance County Courthouse have been granted, \nnor will be granted for the foreseeable future. Any group(s) attempting to protest without \na permit, will be in violation and subject to arrest.” See Exhibit 12, June 26 Sheriff Protest \nStatement.  \n78.  On June 26, 2020 at 3:55 p.m., the Alamance County Sheriff posted the \nfollowing on his official Facebook page: “The Alamance County Sheriff’s Office DOES \nNOT participate in the permitting process for the city of Graham, NC. We are assisting the \ncity of Graham, NC by providing them our social media platforms to help get the word out \nof their decision, so the public may be so informed.” See Exhibit 13, June 26 Sheriff Second \nStatement.  \n79.  At the time the Sheriff declared a protest permit ban, the City of Graham had \nnot yet done so.  \n80.  On June 27, 2020, the City of Graham posted an Amended Declaration of \nState of Emergency on its website. See Exhibit 14, June 27 Amended Order. This amended \norder included two changes to the original: \n(a) The curfew was to begin at 8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. Id. \n  20 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 20 of 46\n\n \n(b) “A temporary suspension of the issuance of parade and demonstration [sic] \nbased on a clear and imminent threat to public safety.” Id. \n \n81.  This amended order differed from the Alamance Sheriff’s protest ban in that \nit made the ban “temporary” rather than “for the foreseeable future.” Id. \n82.  The  City  of  Graham  posted  a  Media  Release  from  the  Graham  Police \nDepartment about the Amended order which stated the following:  \nGraham Police Department has been receiving viable intelligence about a \nlarge group of individuals demonstrating at the historic courthouse located at \nthe court square on June 27, 2020. A peaceful protest was planned for this \ndate, but a permit was denied. The coordinators of that event have since \ncanceled their planned event. However, we found that another group of \npeople were planning to come that were unrelated to the original group. The \nintel we received showed that the people had been involved with other \nprotests in the state that had turned violent. In response to this potential threat \nwe upstaffed to prepare for the crowed [sic] and requested mutual aid from \nmultiple agencies. The mayor also amended the current state of emergency \nto  include  a  temporary  suspension  of  the  issuance  of  parade  and \ndemonstration permits due to the clear and imminent threat to public safety. \n \nSee Exhibit 15, June 27 Police Statement.  \n \n83.  On June 29, 2020 at 3:52 p.m., the City of Graham posted on its official \nFacebook page that the order had been rescinded. \nJuly 10, 2020 Emergency Order \n84.  On July 10, 2020, Defendant Peterman issued another “Declaration of State \nof Emergency” covering the below area outlined in red1: \n                                                 \n1 Image copied from https://www.cityofgraham.com/declaration-of-a-state-of-emergency-\nby-the-mayor-of-the-city-of-graham-2/. \n  21 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 21 of 46\n\n \n \n85.  The July 10 order made it “unlawful to disobey any barriers, warning \nsigns or other structures that restrict vehicular or pedestrian travel due to road closure, \ndetours and/ or hazardous conditions,” and “to use dangerous weapons and substances \nas those terms are defined in N.C.G.S. 14-288.1 unless permitted or exempted by \nSection 2- 54(4) of the City of Graham Code of Ordinances or applicable General \nStatute.” See Exhibit 16, July 10 Emergency Order.  \n86.  The July 10 order has not been rescinded. \n \n \n \n  22 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 22 of 46\n\n \nThe Historic Courthouse as a Site of Protest \n87.  The Historic Courthouse is located in the middle of the rotary in Graham \nwhich connects Main and Elm Streets. The road circling the Historic Courthouse is called \nCourt Square.  \n88.  A sidewalk encircles the Courthouse, with steps going into the Courthouse \nand grassy areas on all four sides.  Pedestrians use the sidewalk to go to the Courthouse, \nand also to cross through the square on their way elsewhere. \n89.  The north and south entrance steps are wider than the east and west sides, \nand a row of stately columns line the north entrance. \n90.  The Confederate monument is positioned in front of the north entrance, and \nis accessed by a reddish brick-face crosswalk from N Main St., which runs alongside the \nwest side of the monument to the north entrance of the Historic Courthouse.   \n91.  Similar reddish brick crosswalks lead from West and East Elm Street across \nthe Court Square rotary to the east and west entrances, and from S Main to the south \nentrance. \n92.  The Historic Courthouse has long served  as a traditional public  forum, \nincluding the steps on the north side, where people gather to make speeches on matters of \npublic concern.  \n93.  For  example,  large  numbers  of  people  supporting  Confederate  symbols \ngathered in a protest on the courthouse steps and area around the Confederate Monument \n  23 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 23 of 46\n\n \non July 18, 2015. People supporting Confederate symbols also gathered on the courthouse \nsteps and area around the Confederate Monument to express themselves on May 20, 2017.  \nDefendants’ Prohibitions on Protest at or Near the Courthouse \n94.  Defendants have a policy or practice of selectively prohibiting protesters \nfrom being on the steps of, or the sidewalk surrounding, the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse.  \n95.  Defendants Boswell, Carter, Lashley, Galey and Sutton (hereinafter, “the \nBoard of Commissioners”) supervise the use of all county property, including the Historic \nCourthouse grounds, through the County Manager, Defendant Hagood. Plaintiff Simpson \nwas told by an Alamance County civilian official that no protests of any kind are allowed \n“on courthouse grounds.” DE 2 #8, Affidavit of Annie Simpson ¶ 8. Alamance Sheriff \ndeputies and Graham police prohibited Plaintiff Dodd from being on the Courthouse \ngrounds or near the monument. DE 2 #4, Affidavit of Terence Colin Dodd ¶¶ 5-11.  \n96.  Since the nationwide protests began in reaction to the police killing of \nGeorge Floyd on May 26, 2020, Defendant Johnson, either on his own or at the direction \nof Defendant Hagood or the Board of Commissioners, has surrounded the Confederate \nmonument and at times, the Historic Courthouse, with physical barriers, prohibiting protest \nby anti-racists and people opposing the monument on the sidewalk and steps of the Historic \nCourthouse.  \n97.  Since the nationwide protests began in reaction to the police killing of \nGeorge Floyd on May 26, 2020, Graham Defendants have  misused their Emergency \n  24 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 24 of 46\n\n \nPowers to preemptively prohibit otherwise peaceful protest by anti-racist demonstrators in \nthe downtown area. \n98.  Alamance Sheriff personnel also blocked access to the Historic Courthouse \ngrounds on June 9, 2020 using their vehicles.  \n99.  Alamance Sheriff personnel also blocked access to the Historic Courthouse \ngrounds on June 27, 2020. \n100.  As shown in the following two photos, Alamance Sheriff personnel and \nGraham police blocked access to the Historic Courthouse grounds on July 11, 2020: \n  \n  25 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 25 of 46\n\n \n \n101.  Defendants blocked access to the Historic Courthouse grounds again on July \n12, 2020. \n102.  Alamance County Sheriff deputies and Graham police officers have ordered \nindividuals, including Plaintiffs Dodd and Simpson, off of the sidewalks of the Historic \nCourthouse and prohibited them from standing on its steps.  \n103.  Defendants have a history of allowing protesters who want to keep the \nConfederate monument to demonstrate in the Historic Courthouse square and on the north \nsteps at the front of the courthouse without any interference by any law enforcement \nofficers.  \n  26 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 26 of 46\n\n \n104.  On July 18, 2015 and May 20, 2017, public demonstrations in support of the \nConfederacy and Graham’s Confederate Monument were held on the front steps of the \nHistoric Courthouse.  \n105.  At those demonstrations, neo-confederate supporters were allowed on the \nsteps and in front of the courthouse, while Defendants employed an extensive police \npresence to defend them from possible counter-protesters.  \n106.  However, those who oppose the monument because it glorifies the legacy of \nslavery and racial oppression of Black people in Alamance County are now prohibited from \nprotesting on the steps of the Courthouse and area around the Confederate Monument.  \nIndividual Plaintiff Allegations \n107.  Plaintiff NAACP is an expressive association that seeks to promote the \ninterests  of its members  and  equality for all people, free from racial  discrimination. \nNAACP engages in expression, including protest, to advance the interests of its members \nand equality for all people, free from racial discrimination.  \n108.  The NAACP joined Alamance County and Elon University leaders in a \nwritten request to the County to remove  the Confederate  monument from Graham’s \nHistoric Courthouse square. \n109.  The NAACP has a direct and immediate interest in the issues presented in \nrecent protests of racialized police violence and the Confederate monument in Graham, \nand in the rights of its members to participate, now and in the future, in such public \ndemonstrations  and  protests  against  institutionalized  racism,  police  violence,  and  the \n  27 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 27 of 46\n\n \nConfederate monument—rights enshrined in the laws and traditions of this State and \nNation,  including  the  right  to  assemble  with  others  and  to  freedom  of  speech  and \nmovement.  \n110.  Those rights are trampled by Defendants through the orders and prohibition \non access to Graham’s Historic Courthouse and courthouse square that are the subject of \nthis action. \n111.  In response to Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff NAACP has been forced to \ndivert resources to assess, plan for, and educate its members about public gatherings, \ndemonstrations, and protests which it has organized or in which its members wish to \nparticipate in Graham.  \n112.  The time and effort Plaintiff NAACP has expended due to Defendants’ now-\nrepealed Ordinance, repeated “State of Emergency” orders, and prohibition on access to \nthe Historic Courthouse grounds has reduced its capacity to plan events and programming \nconsistent with its organizational  mission.  Defendants’ actions are directly  inhibiting \nPlaintiff NAACP’s capacity to fulfill its mission of effecting community and institutional \nchange  through  peaceful  public  demonstrations  in  downtown  Graham  and  at  the \nConfederate monument site.  \nTamara O. Kersey \n113.  Plaintiff Tamara O. Kersey has attended vigils and rallies in the Alamance \nCounty towns of Mebane and Burlington to protest racist police brutality in the wake the \nkilling of George Floyd, but has not yet protested in her hometown of Graham due to \n  28 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 28 of 46\n\n \nDefendants’ unlawful actions. When Graham’s (now-repealed) Ordinance was in place, \nand now with Defendants’ Johnson’s and Prichard’s orders and practice of prohibiting anti-\nracist demonstrators from accessing the Historic Courthouse grounds still in place, Plaintiff \nKersey has reasonably feared being arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for violating \nthem.  \n114.  On June 26, 2020, Plaintiff Kersey applied to Defendant Prichard for a permit \nas was required under the now-repealed Ordinance, for a prayer vigil on July 18 or 25, \nsponsored by the NAACP and faith leaders in Alamance County to protest police brutality \nagainst Black people and communities of color nationwide and in Alamance County, and \nto protest the continued presence of the Confederate monument in Graham’s public square.  \n115.  Plaintiff Kersey received a response from Graham Police Lieutenant Flood \non July 3 that the City was open to working with Plaintiff on either date. Plaintiff Kersey \nhas reserved July 25 for the prayer vigil and demonstration.  \n116.  Plaintiff Kersey wishes to exercise her First Amendment freedoms to hold \nher vigil and demonstration on the Historic Courthouse grounds near the monument. But \nshe reasonably expects that, as they did at the March for Justice and Community on July \n11, 2020, Defendant Johnson and/or the Board of Commissioners and Defendant Hagood \nwill prohibit social justice demonstrators from accessing the Historic Courthouse grounds \nor being anywhere near the Confederate monument, and will arrest any such demonstrator \nwho goes near that public property. \n \n  29 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 29 of 46\n\n \nTenae Turner \n117.  Plaintiff Tenae Turner sought to organize a protest of one hundred to three \nhundred people at the Historic Courthouse in Graham that she had scheduled for June 27, \n2020.  \n118.  Plaintiff Turner submitted a permit application for the protest and gathering \npursuant to the then-applicable Ordinance for a group demonstration to the Graham City \nPolice on June 24, 2020 at 4:33 p.m.  \n119.  On June 26, 2020 at 9:15 p.m., Graham Assistant Chief of Police Kristy Cole \nemailed Plaintiff Turner a document denying her application. \n120.  Assistant Chief Cole’s email stated multiple reasons for the denial of Plaintiff \nTurner’s application including:  \na.  an incomplete address;  \nb.  the potential for the demonstration to interfere with orderly movement of  \n    individuals and property owner’s right to “enjoy peaceful occupancy and use \n    of their property”;  \n \nc.  excessive diversion of police from other necessary duties; and  \n \nd.  that “[r]ecent events in Court Square on 6/20/20 has [sic] already placed  \n    business owners in fear for the safety of their property, as well as, their  \n    employees. We feel that this event would further enhance the fear and  \n    concerns that they have.” \n  \n121.  Assistant Chief Cole’s email also stated that no protests are allowed at the \nHistoric Courthouse.  \n  30 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 30 of 46\n\n \n122.  On June 27, 2020, Plaintiff Turner submitted a new application for a permit \nto demonstrate that she hoped would address the concerns outlined in Defendants’ denial \nemail for her June 24, 2020 application.  \n123.  In this new permit application, Plaintiff Turner requested a permit for a \ndemonstration on June 28, 2020 at the Historic Courthouse from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. for up to \neight people.  \n124.  The application included Plaintiff Turner’s complete address and stated that \nprotesters would be social distancing at least six feet apart, wearing masks, and not yelling \nor chanting, although they would be holding signs.  \n125.  On June 27, 2020 at 7:04 p.m., Assistant Chief Cole wrote to Plaintiff Turner \ninforming her that she would “need to seek written permission from Alamance County to \nbe on the grounds of county property” and asked her to resubmit her application with that \nwritten permission included.  \n126.  Plaintiff Turner replied that demonstrators would protest on the grass at the \nHistoric Courthouse or on the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Historic Courthouse.  \n127.  Assistant Chief Cole replied that she was unable to issue a permit for group \ndemonstration due to the Mayor’s June 27, 2020 State of Emergency order.  \n128.  Plaintiff Turner then cancelled the planned demonstration out of fear that \nparticipants would be arrested or fined if they demonstrated in Graham without a permit. \n129.  Plaintiff Turner plans to continue to organize group demonstrations outside \nthe Historic Courthouse in the near future. \n  31 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 31 of 46\n\n \nTerence Colin Dodd \n130.  Plaintiff Dodd, with his mouth and nose covered for COVID-19 transmission \nprevention, peacefully approached the Confederate monument in front of the Alamance \nCounty Historic Courthouse around 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, June 27, 2020 holding a poster \nthat read “Black Lives Matter.” \n131.  Plaintiff Dodd intended to demonstrate with his sign at the areas marked with \nred “Xs” in the photos below: \n \n  32 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 32 of 46\n\n \n \n \n132.  One of Defendant Johnson’s deputies was in a squad car parked beside the \nmonument at the crosswalk (see lower right red “X” in street view Google photo above and \ntop red “X” in aerial Google map photo above). \n133.  As Plaintiff Dodd approached the monument with his sign, the deputy got \nout of the car, walked toward Plaintiff Dodd and ordered him to step back.   \n134.  The deputy had no mouth or nose covering to protect against COVID-19 \ntransmission. \n  33 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 33 of 46\n\n \n135.  Plaintiff Dodd asked the deputy to explain the ordinance or other legal \nauthority that allowed the deputy to prevent Plaintiff Dodd from demonstrating at the \nConfederate monument and on the Historic Courthouse steps.  \n136.  The deputy did not answer Plaintiff Dodd, but instead called on his radio for \nbackup. \n137.  A half dozen squad cars arrived, and eight to ten Sheriff deputies. \n138.  Plaintiff Dodd felt overwhelmed and fearful, but kept saying to the deputies, \n“Tell me the law, tell me what law I’m breaking,” and asking if he was under arrest.  \n139.  GPD officers then arrived and told Plaintiff Dodd that he could not be on \nCounty property but could walk on the city sidewalks on the other side of Court Square so \nlong as he was alone, not with a group. \n140.  Because he did not want to get arrested, Plaintiff Dodd obeyed the officers \nand the deputies and walked alone on the city sidewalks with his sign until close to 10:00 \na.m., when he left. \nNerissa Rivera \n141.  On June 27, 2020 Plaintiff Nerissa Rivera was planning to go to the protest \nin Graham organized by Plaintiff Turner. She had seen the protest announced on Facebook.  \n142.  Plaintiff Rivera opposes the Confederate monument standing outside the \nHistoric Courthouse because it represents murder, inequality, and racism. It frustrates her \nto see law enforcement wasting taxpayer money protecting the monument when there is \nreal public safety work that needs to be done in the county.  \n  34 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 34 of 46\n\n \n143.  Before she got to Graham on June 27, she learned that Plaintiff Turner had \ncancelled the demonstration because she could not get a permit from the City and did not \nwant anyone to get arrested or injured.  \n144.  Plaintiff Rivera decided to go to downtown Graham and protest alone.  \n145.  Before going out to the monument to protest, Plaintiff Rivera joined some \nfriends at a restaurant near the Historic Courthouse.  \n146.  Plaintiff Rivera joined a racially diverse group of about ten people, some of \nwhom were wearing Black Lives Matter shirts, to walk one member of the group back to \nher car. They walked in pairs, six feet apart on the sidewalk together to comply with \nCOVID-19 precautions.  \n147.  Plaintiff Rivera and the group walked down the east side of N. Main Street, \ncrossing Main Street at a point in between the Harden Street intersection and the Graham \nCinema. As they walked on the sidewalk down N Main St and towards the Historic \nCourthouse, on the block between E Harden St and N Court Square, they were stopped by \nGraham police who told them they could not protest. \n148.  Members of the group responded to the officers that they were not protesting, \nand explained they were walking their friend to her car.  \n149.  Officers said they would allow them to walk to the car but would not allow \nthem to protest. Officers instructed the group that if they started to protest, they would be \nordered to leave or disperse. Plaintiff Rivera's group walked south down North Main Street \nand turned left onto NE Court Square. They saw white people with Confederate flags \n  35 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 35 of 46\n\n \ncongregating at Sesquicentennial Park (across the street from the courthouse on NW Court \nSquare at the intersection of N Main St and W Elm St).  \n150.  Graham police stopped Plaintiff Rivera and her group a little later at NE \nCourt Square, across from N Main St. Plaintiff Rivera and others in her groups asked the \nofficers why the group with the Confederate flags was not being ordered to leave. The \nofficers responded that they had not been instructed to concentrate on the area where the \nother group with the Confederate flags was located. Plaintiff Rivera left Graham without \nbeing able to demonstrate with her group.  \n151.  Plaintiff Rivera had intended to join a protest at the Historic Courthouse \nwhich was cancelled as a result of the denial of Plaintiff Turner’s permit. She attempted to \nwalk around the Historic Courthouse in protest and was threatened by police. She intends \nto continue her efforts to protest the presence of the Confederate monument at the Historic \nCourthouse.  \nDestiny Clarke \n152.  Plaintiff Destiny Clarke arrived in downtown Graham on June 28, 2020 at \napproximately 7:00 p.m. \n153.  Defendant Johnson’s June 26 Facebook post (referenced in above paragraph \n77) and Defendant Peterman’s June 27, 2020 order prohibiting protests were in effect.  \n154.  Plaintiff Clarke exited her car and began walking alone and silently on West \nElm Street carrying a “Black Lives Matter” sign.  \n  36 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 36 of 46\n\n \n155.  As she turned onto the sidewalk on NW Court Square, she was stopped by a \nGPD officer who threatened to arrest her if she did not leave the area.  \n156.  The officer told Plaintiff Clarke that there is no protesting allowed and she \nneeded to leave or be arrested.  \n157.  Plaintiff Clarke replied, “I don’t have to leave because it’s a public place and \nit’s before curfew.”  \n158.  The officer persisted in threatening to arrest her if she did not leave.  \n159.  Plaintiff Clarke offered to throw away her sign and then threw it away.  \n160.   As she was throwing away “Black Lives Matter” sign, the officer continued \nto threaten to arrest her if she did not leave.  \n161.  Once she threw away her sign, the officer left.  \n162.  During the interaction, a family passed by carrying ice cream and the officer \ndid not interact with them or ask them to leave.  \n163.  Plaintiff Clarke believes that she was threatened with arrest specifically \nbecause she was carrying a sign with a political message. \n164.  She was not permitted to walk alone on the public sidewalk in Graham, \napparently because she was carrying a poster with anti-racist speech on it.  \n165.  Plaintiff  Clarke  plans  to  continue  to  protest  at  the  Alamance  Historic \nCourthouse in the near future.  \n \n \n  37 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 37 of 46\n\n \nAnnie Simpson \n166.  On June 29, 2020 at 3:25 p.m., Plaintiff Annie Simpson called the GPD to \ninquire about how to apply for a permit to demonstrate at the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse.  \n167.  Assistant Chief Kristy Cole informed Plaintiff Simpson that she would have \nto submit written permission from the Alamance County Manager’s Office along with her \napplication for demonstration permit in order to hold a demonstration at the Historic \nCourthouse. \n168.  On June 29, 2020 at 4:02 p.m., Plaintiff Simpson called Defendant \nHagood’s office to inquire about the process of acquiring written permission to \ndemonstrate at the Alamance County Historic Courthouse.  \n169.  Plaintiff Simpson informed the individual who answered the phone in \nDefendant Hagood’s office that she was applying for a protest permit with GPD and that \nthe protest would be on county property at the Historic Courthouse.  \n170.  Plaintiff Simpson asked for Defendant Hagood’s email address so she could \nrequest the written permission GPD told her was needed. The person she spoke with \nasked her what she needed the permit for, and she answered that she was applying for a \nprotest permit. After waiting on hold, Plaintiff Simpson was told, “I’m not sure why \nGraham is telling you to contact the County Manager because the county does not issue \nany kind of protest permits. You’ll have to go through the City of Graham.”  \n  38 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 38 of 46\n\n \n171.  Plaintiff Simpson explained again that she had been told by Assistant Chief \nCole that she needed to gain written permission from the County Manager before she \ncould even apply for a permit to demonstrate on the grass or steps outside the Alamance \nCounty Historic Courthouse.  \n172.  Defendant Hagood’s staff person responded that no protest would be \nallowed on courthouse grounds.  \n173.  Plaintiff Simpson asked for clarification and Defendant’s staff person \nrepeated that no protests are allowed on courthouse grounds.  \nAdam Rose \n174.  Plaintiff Adam Rose became concerned about police and governmental \noverreaction to peaceful protests in Graham in early June 2020.  \n175.  On June 2, 2020, Plaintiff Rose passed by the Historic Courthouse Square \nand was surprised to see neo-confederate demonstrators near the monument openly \ncarrying firearms, in contravention of state law regarding public demonstrations.  \n176.  At Graham’s video (Zoom) City Council meeting June 9, 2020, Plaintiff \nRose’s written public comment was read aloud, expressing his concerns about the City’s \nrespecting free speech rights.  \n177.  One of the Council Members stood up and left the meeting while Plaintiff \nRose’s comment was being read. \n  39 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 39 of 46\n\n \n178.  On June 26, 2020 Plaintiff Rose filed an application for a permit to \ndemonstrate at the Historic Courthouse Square. Plaintiff Rose indicated he planned to \nattend with five others on June 28 for a two-hour period.  \n179.  On June 27, Assistant Chief Cole informed Plaintiff Rose that his permit \nhad been denied, and that no permits would be issued for an indefinite period of time.  \nPlaintiff Gregory Drumwright \n180.  On July 1, 2020, Plaintiff Drumwright applied for a permit to hold a large \ndemonstration at the Historic Courthouse square in Graham on July 11, 2020. \n181.  Soon after emailing the permit application to the GPD, Plaintiff Drumwright \nreceived an emailed acknowledgement of receipt of his application stating that it would be \nforwarded to GPD Lieutenant Flood, who would then follow up with Plaintiff Drumwright.   \n182.   Plaintiff  Drumwright  later  telephoned  Lt.  Flood,  who  told  Plaintiff \nDrumwright that he had seen Plaintiff’s application and would get back to him about it.   \n183.  On July 3, Lieutenant Flood contacted Plaintiff Drumwright and said he was \ncontinuing to work on processing the permit application. Plaintiff Drumwright requested \nto meet with Lieutenant Flood on July 7, and Lieutenant Flood agreed. \n184.  Plaintiff Drumwright was concerned that Defendants would not advise him \nwhether his permit was granted in sufficient time to be able to plan and make arrangements \nfor the July 11 demonstration.  \n  40 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 40 of 46\n\n \n185.  For that reason, on July 1, Plaintiff Drumwright called the Graham City \nManager’s office concerning his permit application. He was told during that call that \nDefendant Johnson was not allowing any permits for protests to be issued. \n186.  On July 7 at the meeting with Lieutenant Flood, Plaintiff was told that \nbecause of the Temporary Restraining Order entered by this Court on July 6, the City’s \npermit requirement was suspended, and that he would have to get a permit from the North \nCarolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) to have marchers use the roundabout \naround the Historic Courthouse. \n187.  Plaintiff  Drumwright  obtained  permission  from  the  NCDOT  for  street \nclosures going into Graham from Burlington and near the Historic Courthouse for the \nBurlington- Graham March for Justice and Community (“the March for Justice”) on July \n11, 2020.  \n188.  The March for Justice ended with a rally at the stage on the Courthouse \nSquare where there were various speakers and musical selections. \n189.  Graham police and Alamance Sheriff personnel set up barriers, using tape, \npatrol cars, officers and deputies, to prevent people from accessing the Historic Courthouse \ngrounds before, during, and after the March for Justice on July 11, 2020. \n190.  Graham police and Alamance Sheriff personnel told Plaintiff Drumwright \nand those assisting him in setting up the stage and sound system on the morning of July 11 \nthat they and everyone participating in their demonstration were prohibited from accessing \nthe Historic Courthouse grounds, which they said was “county property.” \n  41 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 41 of 46\n\n \n191.  A young Black man who was assisting Plaintiff Drumwright with the March \nfor Justice stage event was arrested at around 1:00pm on July 11 when he attempted to \ncross the Court Square on the southeast side near West Elm Street to deliver some papers \nto one of the speakers at the stage. \n192.  Prior to his arrest, Graham Police Sargent Payne had given the young man \npermission to cross the Court Square to retrieve some papers for Plaintiff Drumwright from \nhis vehicle on South Main Street.   \n193.  Plaintiff Drumwright plans to continue to go to Graham accompanied by \nother community members to demonstrate and protest peaceably in and around the Historic \nCourthouse  square  in  Graham  against  white  supremacy,  police  brutality  and  racial \noppression.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nVIOLATION OF FREE EXPRESSION, FREE ASSOCIATION, AND ASSEMBLY \nRIGHTS UNDER THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE \nUNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants \n \n194.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n195.  Plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the free \nexpression, free association, and assembly rights protected under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiff NAACP asserts this claim on behalf of \nitself and its members. \n  42 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 42 of 46\n\n \n196.  In the following paragraphs, references to the First Amendment include the \nFirst Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n197.  Defendants’ policy and practice of prohibiting and restricting public protest \nin the Historic Courthouse square, including the sidewalk in front of and the steps of the \nCourthouse, is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech and assembly.  \n198.  Defendants’  practice  of  allowing  protesters  who  support  Confederate \nsymbols to gather on the Historic Courthouse steps and area around the Confederate \nMonument, but prohibiting anti-racism protesters in the same place is a content- and \nviewpoint-based unconstitutional restriction on free speech and assembly. \n199.  Defendant Peterman’s practice of declaring—and all Defendants’ practice of \nenforcing—repeated Emergency Orders that suppress and restrict peaceful protests in \nGraham and its Historic Courthouse square is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech \nand assembly. \nCOUNT TWO \nVIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants \n \n200.

Plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of due \nprocess  rights  protected  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S.  Constitution. \nPlaintiff NAACP asserts this claim on behalf of itself and its members. \n202.  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  with  respect  to  unlawful  Emergency \nOrders and restricting access to the Courthouse violate Plaintiffs’ right to travel and \nfreedom of movement under the Fourteenth Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored \nto a compelling or substantial government interest.  \n203.  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  with  respect  to  unlawful  Emergency \nOrders and restricting access to the Courthouse violate Plaintiffs’ rights to due process \nbecause they are pretextual, and because Defendants issue and enforce these policies and \npractices arbitrarily.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the following relief:  \n(a)  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin, and enter a declaratory judgment stating \nthat Defendants’ policies and practices of prohibiting protest at the Historic \nCourthouse grounds violates Plaintiffs’ rights to free speech and assembly \nunder the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and to due process under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \n(b)  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin, and enter a declaratory judgment stating \nthat  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  of  promulgating  and  enforcing \nEmergency Orders violates Plaintiffs’ rights to free speech and assembly under \n  44 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 27   Filed 07/17/20   Page 44 of 46\n\n \nthe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and to due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \n(c)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and as otherwise permitted by law; and \n(d)  Order such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable. \nRespectfully submitted this 17th day of July 2020, \n/s/ Kristi L.

DRUMWRIGHT           \nCivil Action No. ____________ \nPlaintiffs,                 \nv.                       \nJERRY PETERMAN, in his official capacity as  \nMayor of the City of Graham, North Carolina;  \nFRANKIE MANESS, in his official capacity as \nGraham City Manager; CHIP TURNER, in his  \nofficial capacity as Mayor Pro-Tem of the City  \nof Graham; MELODY WIGGINS, JENNIFER  \nTALLEY, and RICKY HALL, in their official  \ncapacities as Graham City Council Members;  \nJEFFREY PRICHARD, in his official capacity  \nas Chief of the Graham Police Department; \nTERRY S. JOHNSON, in his official capacity as  \nSheriff of Alamance County; BRYAN HAGOOD,  \nin his official capacity as Alamance County Manager,  \nDefendants.            \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n \n \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 1 of 39\n\n \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1.  This action challenges Chapter 18, Art. VI, Sections 18-172, 18-174–181 of \nthe City of Graham, North Carolina’s Code of Ordinances (hereinafter, “the Ordinance”). \nThe Ordinance requires any group of “two or more persons” gathering “for the purpose of \nprotesting any matter or making known any position or thought of the group or of attracting \nattention thereto” and anyone at all “march[ing] . . . upon the public streets, sidewalks, \nparks, or other public places” to acquire a permit from the Graham police chief at least 24 \nhours in advance. The Ordinance gives the police chief complete discretion to limit \ngatherings to no more than six individuals and deny permit applications based on the \nchief’s judgment that the gathering might cause “a public disturbance,” and restricts all \nFirst Amendment-protected speech and assembly rights of minors absent discretionary \npermission by the police chief. \n2.  The Ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint on First Amendment \nrights to free speech and assembly, violates the First Amendment’s prohibition against \nunreasonable and content-based time, place and manner restrictions of speech in traditional \npublic forums and violates due process because it is void for vagueness.  \n3.  This  action  also  challenges  Defendants’  repeated  denial  of  attempts  by \nPlaintiffs and countless other speakers to protest in front of the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse in Graham’s town square (hereinafter, “Historic Courthouse”). Protesting in \nthat location is central to Plaintiffs’ message because they seek to protest the continued \npresence in the public square of the Confederate monument, which glorifies the legacy of \n  2\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 2 of 39\n\n \nslavery,  white  supremacy,  and  racial  oppression  of  African  Americans  in  Alamance \nCounty. Plaintiffs have protested and intend to continue to protest institutionalized racism \nand police violence against Black individuals and communities.   \n4.  This action also challenges Defendant Peterman’s repeated issuance, and \nDefendants Johnson, Maness and Prichard’s enforcement via Sheriff deputies and Graham \npolice officers of the so-called “State of Emergency” Declarations (hereinafter “orders”). \nDefendant Peterman issued the first such order on May 31, 2020, prohibiting people from \n“gathering or demonstrating on any public street, sidewalk, or public property” between \nthe hours of 9:00p.m. and 6:00am. The most recent order issued on June 27, 2020 and \ncompletely suspended individuals’ rights to free movement, assembly and speech.   \n5.  None of Defendant Peterman’s orders were justified by any actual state of \nemergency or imminent threat to public health or safety. They were instead motivated by \nthe  Defendants’  desire  to  prevent  individuals  and  groups,  including  Plaintiffs,  from \nprotesting the Confederate monument, institutionalized racism and police violence against \nBlack individuals and communities in Graham’s town square.  \n6.  In light of ongoing and imminent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, including the \nongoing  threat  of  criminal  prosecution  and  civil  enforcement,  Plaintiffs  respectfully \nrequest preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to ensure immediate cessation of \nenforcement of Graham’s unlawful permit and protest ordinance. \n \n \n  3\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 3 of 39\n\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nbecause this case arises under the U.S. Constitution and laws of the United States; and \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343 because this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under \ncolor of state law, of Plaintiffs’ civil rights, and to secure equitable or other relief for the \nviolation of those rights. \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, as well as Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n9.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (c). \nPlaintiffs regularly engage in expressive and associative activities in this District.

The Confederate Monument outside the Historic Courthouse was erected in \n1914  as  a  result  of  a  coordinated  statewide  effort  of  the  United  Daughters  of  the \nConfederacy (“UDC”) to place these monuments in public squares across the State. \n30.  Founded in 1894, the UDC organized and built Confederate Monuments, \ncared for Confederate veterans and widows, and promoted and published textbooks for use \nin schools across the South. \n31.  The  UDC  also  advanced  and  supported  a  political  white  supremacy \ncampaign which disenfranchised and terrorized Black people.   \n32.  The UDC officially recognized the Ku Klux Klan for helping to restore \nsouthern home rule and white supremacy.    \n33.  The UDC’s objective was to vindicate and glorify the Confederacy and to \npromote the “Lost Cause” mythology, a false historical narrative which downplayed the \nharm and significance of slavery and promoted a policy of racial segregation and white \nsupremacy.   \n34.  According to the inscription on the Confederate monument in Graham, it was \n“erected through the efforts of the Graham Chapter” of the UDC. The total cost for the \nmonument was $2,100, plus an additional $305 for the mound and post, chain and curbing \nenclosure surrounding the monument. On January 5, 1914, the Alamance County Board of \nCommissioners appropriated $1,000 to contribute to the project.  \n35.  Upon information and belief, the Graham Chapter of the UDC covered the \nmajority of the costs for the project. \n  9\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 9 of 39\n\n \n36.  The monument consists of a statue of a Civil War infantryman, wearing a \nbrimmed, floppy slouch hat and a butternut cloth uniform, standing at parade rest with his \nrifle and attached bayonet at his right side. The sculpture rests upon a shaft mounted on a \nmiddle base with tiered upper and lower sections atop a stepped bottom. There are crossed \nConfederate battle flags on the front of the shaft. \n37.  In addition to the above referenced inscription attributed to the UDC, the \nmonument contains the following inscriptions:  \n(a) “To  Commemorate  With  Grateful  Love  the  Patriotism,  Valor,  and \nDevotion  to  Duty,  of  the  Brave  Soldiers  of  Alamance  County,  Our \nConfederate Soldiers” \n(b) “On Fame's Eternal Camping Ground, Their Silent Tents are Spread, and \nGlory Guards, with Solemn Round, the Bivouac of the Dead.\" \n(c) “Faithful Unto Death, They are Crowned with Immortal Glory.\"  \nOpposition to the Confederate Monument at the Historic Courthouse \n38.  Groups of pro-Confederate demonstrators gather in front of the Confederate \nMonument annually in May to celebrate Confederate Memorial Day. They are often met \nby citizens who oppose the Confederate monument’s presence in the public square and the \nneo-confederate white supremacist ideology. \n39.  Anti-racism protesters have gathered at the Historic Courthouse in greater \nfrequency and in greater numbers since 2015, when white supremacist Dylann Roof \nmurdered nine Black people worshipping at the Emanuel Methodist Episcopal Church in \n  10\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 10 of 39\n\n \ndowntown  Charleston,  South  Carolina  on  June  17,  2015  under  the  banner  of  the \nConfederate flag.   \n40.  The  attack  sparked  a  new  national  discussion  around  Confederate \nmonuments, and many states and municipalities began removing them. \n41.  However, the North Carolina General Assembly instead passed a law in 2015 \npreventing  local  governments  from  moving  any  government-owned  “object  of \nremembrance” located on public property. N.C. Gen. Stat.§100-2.1.   \n42.  Recently the Mayor of Burlington was joined by fifty other elected officials, \nPlaintiff  NAACP,  and  other  community  leaders  in  calling  for  the  relocation  of  the \nConfederate Monument from the steps of the Historic Courthouse.   \nNationwide Protests After the Killing of George Floyd \n43.  On May 25, 2020, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis Police Department officer, \nknelt on the neck of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for nearly nine minutes, \ncausing his death. Mr. Floyd died as three other officers looked on. The police killing of \nMr. Floyd sparked protests across the country against police brutality in more than 2,000 \ncities and towns in more than 60 countries in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. \nDefendants’ Weekend So-Called “State of Emergency” Orders \n44.  As the protests in response to Mr. Floyd’s death and against police violence \nspread  nationwide,  Defendant  Peterman  began  issuing  regular  so-called  “State  of \nEmergency Declarations” (hereinafter, “orders”) each weekend to suppress such protests. \n \n  11\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 11 of 39\n\n \n \n \nMay 31-June 1, 2020 Order \n45.  On May  31, the City of Graham posted a press release on its  website \nannouncing the Mayor’s first such order, stating that it was “due to the potential for damage \nor injury, due to civil unrest.”  \n46.  Neither Defendant Peterman nor the City cited any examples of threatened \nor actual civil unrest, damage to property or injury in its municipal city limits.  \n47.  In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nMay 31, 2020. \n48.  Defendant Peterman’s May 31 order included the following restrictions: \n(a) “Restricted Access: It shall be unlawful to disobey any barriers, warning signs \nor other structures that restrict vehicular or pedestrian travel due to road closure, \ndetours, hazards, etc.” \n \n(b) “Furthermore,  this  declaration  denies  or  restricts  access  to  areas,  streets, \nhighways or locations within the City in which that restriction or denial of access \nor use is reasonably necessary to promote efforts being made to overcome the \nemergency or to prevent further aggravation of the emergency.” \n \n49.  On May 31, the City of Graham posted a notice on its website announcing \nthe following additional terms of the order: \n(a) “A curfew of 9 p.m. with the exception of Public Safety personnel, Doctors, \nNurses and such other classes of persons as may be essential to the preservation \nof public order and immediately necessary to serve safety, health and welfare \nneeds of the people within the City;” \n \n(b) “a prohibition against travel to or within the Fire Limits as prescribed in Section \n6-31 of the City of Graham Code of Ordinances;” \n  12\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 12 of 39\n\n \n \n(c) “a  prohibition  against  the  possession,  transportation,  sale,  purchase,  and \nconsumption of alcoholic beverages away from one’s own premises;” and \n \n(d) “a prohibition against the use of dangerous weapons and substances unless \npermitted or exempted by Section 2-54(4) of the City of Graham Code of \nOrdinances or application General Statute.” \n \n50.  On June 1, 2020, the City of Graham posted on its official Facebook page \nthat it was lifting the order and curfew effective immediately.  \nJune 4–June 9, 2020 Order \n51.  On June 4, 2020 at 9:01p.m., the City of Graham posted a press release on \nits Facebook page and its website announcing another order by Defendant Peterman’s \nrestricting people’s movement “due to the potential for widespread or severe damage, \ninjury, loss of life or property due to civil unrest.” \n52.  Neither Defendant Peterman nor the City cited any examples of threatened \nor actual civil unrest, damage to property or injury in its municipal city limits.  \n53.  In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nJune 4, 2020. \n54.  Defendant Peterman’s order stated that it would “shall remain in effect until \nJune 9 at 6am unless it is rescinded prior.”   \n55.  The June 4 order included restrictions and conditions identical to the May \n31-June 1 order with two amendments: \n(a) Extending the curfew from 9p.m. to 6a.m. \n  13\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 13 of 39\n\n \n(b) Clarifying  that  “citizens  traveling  to  or  from  places  of  employment”  were \nexempted from the curfew.  \n56.  On June 5, 2020 at 3:57 p.m., the City of Graham posted an “FAQ sheet” \nabout the curfew and order to its official Facebook page and website. The FAQ included \nadditional restrictions that were not explicitly included in either of the prior written orders: \n(a) \"The curfew prohibits anyone within the City of Graham, between the hours of \n9  p.m.  and  6  a.m.,  from  gathering  or  demonstrating  on  any  public  street, \nsidewalk, or public property.\" \n \n(b) The curfew “prohibits travel upon any public street unless it is for the purpose \nof seeking medical care, food, or other necessities for yourself or a family \nmember.” \n \n(c) “Violation of the curfew is punishable as a class 2 misdemeanor.” \n(d) “All businesses are permitted to remain open during the nightly curfew if they \nchoose to do so.” \n \n(e) “Unnecessary additional travel or lingering in public space is prohibited.” \n57.  On June 5, 2020 at 4:52p.m., the City of Graham posted a comment on its \nofficial Facebook page, alongside a photo of the order, that “[p]reventative actions are \nbeing taken to manage the potential for widespread damage, injury, or loss of life or \nproperty due to civil unrest.” \n58.  On June 5, 2020 at 4:57 p.m., the City of Graham posted a letter from \nDefendant Peterman to its official Facebook page. This letter included the following \nstatement regarding the State of Emergency: \n“There are several instances where a State of Emergency is declared in advance \nand disseminated with an excess of time. For events such as hurricanes or winter \nstorms, we often have days to prepare based on scientific forecasts. The threat \n  14\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 14 of 39\n\n \nof civil unrest is generally not a planned instance shared with the City. The \npriority of notice in these types of circumstances quickly creates the scenario of \nemergency management.” \n \n59.  On June 9, 2020 at 6 a.m., the City of Graham posted to its official Facebook \npage that the order had been rescinded.  \nJune 20–June 22, 2020 Order \n60.  On June 20, 2020 at 8:32p.m., the City of Graham posted a press release to \nits Facebook page and its website announcing another order by Defendant Peterman “due \nto the potential for widespread or severe damage, injury, loss of life or property due to civil \nunrest.” \n61.  Neither Defendant Peterman nor the City cited any examples of threatened \nor actual civil unrest, damage to property, injury or loss of life within city limits.  \n62.  In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nJune 20, 2020. \n63.  The June 20 order included restrictions and conditions identical to the June \n4 order.  \n64.  On June 22, 2020 10:07a.m., the City of Graham posted to its official \nFacebook that the order had been rescinded.  \nJune 25–June 29, 2020 City of Graham “Emergency” \n65.  On June 25, 2020 at 7:44p.m., the City of Graham posted a press release to \nits Facebook page and its website announcing another order by Defendant Peterman “due \n  15\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 15 of 39\n\n \nto the potential for widespread or severe damage, injury, loss of life or property due to civil \nunrest.” \n66.  Neither Defendant Peterman nor the City cited any examples of threatened \nor actual civil unrest, damage to property, injury or loss of life within city limits.  \n67.  In fact, there was no threatened or actual civil unrest occurring in Graham on \nJune 25, 2020. \n68.  This June 25 order was identical to the June 20 order. \n69.  On June 26, 2020 at 12:00 p.m., the Alamance County Sheriff posted to its \nofficial Facebook the following: “[E]ffective June 26, 2020, no permits to protest in the \ncity of Graham, NC to include the Alamance County Courthouse have been granted, nor \nwill be granted for the foreseeable future. Any group(s) attempting to protest without a \npermit, will be in violation and subject to arrest.” \n70.  On  June  26,  2020  at  3:55  p.m.,  the  Alamance  County  Sheriff  official \nFacebook page posted the following: “The Alamance County Sheriff's Office DOES NOT \nparticipate in the permitting process for the city of Graham, NC. We are assisting the city \nof Graham, NC by providing them our social media platforms to help get the word out of \ntheir decision, so the public may be so informed.” \n71.  At the time the Sheriff declared a protest permit ban, the City of Graham had \nnot yet done so.  \n  16\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 16 of 39\n\n \n72.  On June 27, 2020 at 11:51a.m., the City of Graham posted an Amended \nDeclaration of State of Emergency to its official Facebook page. This amended order \nincluded two changes to the original: \n(a) The curfew was to begin at 8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. \n(b) “A temporary suspension of the issuance of parade and demonstration [sic] \nbased on a clear and imminent threat to public safety.”  \n \n73.  This amended order differed from the Alamance Sheriff’s protest ban in that \nit made the ban temporary rather than “for the foreseeable future.” \n74.  The  City  of  Graham  posted  a  Media  Release  from  the  Graham  Police \nDepartment  about  the  Amended  order  which  stated  the  following:  “Graham  Police \nDepartment has been receiving viable intelligence about a large group of individuals \ndemonstrating at the historic courthouse located at the court square on 6/27/20. A peaceful \nprotest was planned for this date, but a permit was denied. The coordinators of that event \nhave since canceled their planned event. However, we found that another group of people \nwere planning to come that were unrelated to the original group. The intel we received \nshowed that the people had been involved with other protests in the state that had turned \nviolent. In response to this potential threat we upstaffed to prepare for the crowed [sic] and \nrequested mutual aid from multiple agencies. The mayor also amended the current state of \nemergency to include a temporary suspension of the issuance of parade and demonstration \npermits due to the clear and imminent threat to public safety.”  \n75.  On June 29, 2020 at 3:52 p.m., the City of Graham posted to its official \nFacebook that the order had been rescinded. \n  17\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 17 of 39\n\n \nThe Graham City Permit Ordinance \n76.  Graham City Code Sec. 18-175 provides: “No parade, picket line or group \ndemonstration is permitted on the sidewalks or streets of the city unless a permit therefor \nhas been issued by the city; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued  to  prevent  the  peaceful  assembly  of  any  group  for  orderly  expression  or \ncommunication between those assembled.”  \n77.  Graham City Code Sec. 18-172 defines a “group demonstration” as “any \nassembly together or concert of action between two or more persons for the purpose of \nprotesting any matter or making known any position or thought of the group or of attracting \nattention thereto.”  \n78.  The  ordinance  defines  parade  as  “any  parade,  march,  ceremony,  show, \nexhibition or procession of any kind in or upon the public streets, sidewalks, parks or other \npublic places.”  \n79.  It defines picket line as “any persons formed together for the purpose of \nmaking known any position or promotion of said persons or on behalf of any organization.” \n80.  Graham  City  Ordinance  Sec.  18-178  provides  for  the  application  and \nissuance of permits and states: “The chief of police or, in his absence, the next highest \nranking officer of the city police department is authorized to issue permits as required in \nthis article, and in the issuance thereof shall: \n(1) Require a written application therefor to be filed 24 hours in advance of such \nparade,  picket  line  or  group  demonstration  on  a  form  prescribed  by  said \ndepartment, and shall require the application to be signed by the person filing \nsuch application and the applicant shall therein state the proposed site, time, \n  18\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 18 of 39\n\n \npurpose and size of such parade, picket line or group demonstration, and whether \nor not any minors below the age of 18 years shall participate. \n \n(2) Refuse to issue such permit when the activity or purpose stated in the application \nwould violate any ordinance of the city or statute of the state, or when the activity \nor purpose would endanger the public health or safety, or hinder or prevent the \norderly movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the sidewalks or streets \nof the city.  \n \n(3) Specify in the permit whether or not minors below the age of 18 years will be \npermitted to participate. The chief of police or, in his absence, the next highest \nranking police officer of the city on duty shall pass upon whether or not minors \nbelow the age of 18 years shall be permitted to participate in the parade, picket \nline or group demonstration, and shall base his determination upon whether or \nnot the purpose, time or place of the participation will be detrimental to or \nendanger the health, welfare or safety of said minors. \n \n81.  Graham City Ordinance Sec. 18-179 sets out the “prerequisites” for issuing \npermits as follows: “The chief of police or other designated officer in considering the \nissuance of a permit shall, among other considerations provided, consider and find as a \nrequisite for issuance that: \n(1) The activity will not require excessive diversion of police from other necessary \nduties. \n \n(2) The activity will not interfere with the right of property owners in the area to \nenjoy peaceful occupancy and use of their property. \n \n(3) The activity can be conducted without unreasonable interference with normal \nvehicular or pedestrian traffic in the area, will not prevent normal police or fire \nprotection to the public, and will not be likely to cause injury to persons or \nproperty or provoke disorderly conduct or create a public disturbance. \n \n82.  Graham City Ordinance Sec. 18-180 provides for the contents of the permit \nas follows:  \n(a) A permit under this article may set the starting time and duration of a parade, \ndemonstration or picket line and may set the speed of its travel; the space \n  19\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 19 of 39\n\n \nbetween persons or vehicles; the portions or areas of the streets and sidewalks to \nbe used; the length of the parade, group or line; and such other requirements as \nthe chief of police or other designated officer may include in the permit for the \ncontrol of free movement of traffic upon the streets and sidewalks, or for the \nhealth, safety and property rights of the participants and the general public. \nFailure to comply with such requirements, as set forth in the permit, shall be \nunlawful. \n \n(b) The applicant for a permit shall specify and the permit shall designate the person \nin charge of the parade, group demonstration or picket line, and such person in \ncharge shall accompany such parade, demonstration, or picket line and shall \ncarry such permit with him at that time. \n \n83.  Graham City Ordinance Sec. 18-181 restricts the number of participants as \nfollows: “Any picket line or group demonstration which is located in any area subject to \nnormally heavy pedestrian or vehicular traffic may be limited in the permit issued to a \nconcentration of not more than six persons participating within any designated area of the \nstreet or sidewalk; provided that the officer issuing the permit may specify a larger number \nin the designated area where, in his judgment, conditions permit a higher concentration. \nThe term \"designated area\" is defined as the entire width of said street or sidewalk “within \na distance measured along its length for 100 feet.” \n84.  Graham City Ordinance Sec. 18-177 requires that the presence of minors be \nidentified in the permit, and that minors are prohibited from participating in demonstrations \nunless the permit specifically allows it. It provides: “In any parade, picket line or group \ndemonstration, it shall be unlawful: \n(1) For  any  minor  below  the  age  of  18  years  to  participate  or  be  allowed  to \nparticipate, and any person encouraging, leading or allowing such minor to so \nparticipate, unless a permit therefor has been issued, shall be guilty of a violation \nof this section. \n  20\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 20 of 39\n\n \n(2) For any person to lead, guide, participate in or in any way support or encourage \nsuch parade, picket line or group demonstration when a minor below the age of \n18 years is participating therein, unless a permit for such participation by such \nminor has been issued. \n(3) For any parent to knowingly permit any minor child of such parent under 18 \nyears of age to participate in such parade, picket line or group demonstration \nunless a permit for such participation by such minor has been issued. \n(4) To cause, participate in, lead or encourage any parade, picket line or group \ndemonstration to deviate in any manner from the authority therefor specified in \nthe permit. \n \nIndividual Plaintiff Allegations \nNAACP \n85.  Plaintiff NAACP is an expressive association that seeks to promote the \ninterests  of its members and equality  for all  people, free from racial discrimination. \nNAACP engages in expression, including protest, to advance the interests of its members \nand equality for all people, free from racial discrimination.  \n86.  The NAACP joined Alamance and Elon University leaders in a written \nrequest to the County to remove the Confederate monument from Graham’s town square. \n87.  NAACP has a direct and immediate interest in the issues presented in recent \nprotests of racialized police violence and the Confederate monument in Graham, and in the \nrights of their members to participate, now and in the future, in such public demonstrations \nand  protests  against  institutionalized  racism,  police  violence  and  the  Confederate \nmonument-- rights enshrined in the laws and traditions of this state and nation, including \nthe right to assemble with others and to freedom of speech and movement.  \n  21\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 21 of 39\n\n \n88.  Those rights are trampled by Defendants through the ordinance provisions \nand orders that are the subject of this action, and by the unlawful “State of Emergency” \norders that have been issued and will likely continue to issue absent an order from the \nCourt. \n89.  In response to Defendants’ actions, including the ordinance and orders, \nPlaintiff NAACP has been forced to divert resources to assess, plan for and educate its \nmembers about public gatherings, demonstrations and protests which it has organized or in \nwhich its members wish to participate that would trigger Defendants’ unlawful conduct in \nGraham. \n90.  Such diversion of resources includes applying for a permit under the subject \nordinance on June 26, 2020 for a gathering organized by faith leaders in Alamance County \nand the  NAACP  to protest the continued presence of  the Confederate  monument  in \nGraham’s public square.  \n91.  The time and effort Plaintiff NAACP has expended due to Defendants’ \nunlawful ordinance and repeated “State of Emergency” orders have reduced its capacity to \nplan events and programming consistent with its organizational mission. Defendants’ \nactions are directly frustrating Plaintiff NAACP’s capacity to fulfill its mission of effecting \ncommunity and institutional change through peaceful public demonstrations in downtown \nGraham and at the Confederate monument site.  \nTamara O. Kersey \n  22\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 22 of 39\n\n \n92.  Plaintiff Tamara O. Kersey has attended vigils and rallies in the Alamance \nCounty towns of Mebane and Burlington to protest racist police brutality in the wake the \nkilling  of  George  Floyd,  but  has  not  protested  in  her  hometown  of  Graham  due  to \nDefendants’ unlawful actions. While Defendant Peterman and Johnson’s orders have been \nin place, she has reasonably feared being arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for \nviolating them. At all other times, she has reasonably feared being cited for not obtaining \na permit from Defendant Prichard. \n93.  On June 26, 2020, Plaintiff Kersey applied to Defendant Prichard for a permit \nas required under the ordinance for a prayer vigil on either July 18 or 25, sponsored by the \nNAACP and faith leaders in Alamance County, to protest  police brutality against Black \npeople and communities of color nationwide and in Alamance County, and to protest the \ncontinued presence of the Confederate monument in Graham’s public square.  \n94.  Despite multiple requests to the Graham Police Department (GPD), Plaintiff \nKersey has not received any response from Defendant Prichard or anyone else in the GPD \nregarding her permit application, making it difficult for her to plan for the demonstration. \nBased on Defendants’ practice of waiting to grant or deny a permits until just before the \nday of the requested assembly, and the lack of any required deadline for a response in the \nOrdinance, Plaintiff Kersey fears that she will be unable to hold her demonstration despite \nhaving applied for the permit weeks in advance. \n95.  In light of the Ordinance’s vague and discretionary standards and Defendant \nJohnson’s and GPD’s prior treatment of those protesting the monument and racialized \n  23\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 23 of 39\n\n \npolice brutality, Plaintiff Kersey also fears that her permit request will be denied because \nof the viewpoint she seeks to express.  \n96.  Plaintiff  Kersey  has  been  unable  to  properly  publicize  her  planned \ndemonstration to the faith community, Plaintiff NAACP members, supporters, and the \npublic, due to fear of subjecting participants to arrest by Defendant Johnson, his deputies \nor the GPD should Plaintiff Kersey, her fellow faith leaders and the NAACP proceed with \nthe vigil without a permit.  \nTenae Turner \n97.  Plaintiff Tenae Turner submitted an application for a group demonstration \nto the Graham City Police on June 24, 2020 at 4:33p.m. \n98.  Plaintiff Turner’s application requested a permit for a group of one hundred \nto three hundred (100-300) people to demonstrate at the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse in Graham on June 27, 2020.   \n99.  On June 26, 2020 at 9:15p.m., Graham Assistant Chief of Police, Kristy \nCole emailed Plaintiff Turner a document denying her application.  \n100.  Assistant Chief Cole’s email stated multiple reasons for the denial of \nPlaintiff Turner’s application including:  \na.  an incomplete address;  \nb.  the potential for the demonstration to interfere with orderly movement of \nindividuals and property owner’s right to “enjoy peaceful occupancy and use of their \nproperty”;  \n \nc.  excessive diversion of police from other necessary duties; and  \n \n  24\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 24 of 39\n\n \nd.  that “[r]ecent events in Court Square on 6/20/20 has [sic] already placed \nbusiness owners in fear for the safety of their property, as well as, their employees. We \nfeel that this event would further enhance the fear and concerns that they have.”  \n \n101.  Assistant Chief Cole’s email also stated that no protests are allowed at the \nHistoric Courthouse.  \n102.  On June 27, 2020, Plaintiff Turner submitted a new application for a permit \nto demonstrate that she hoped would address the concerns outlined in Defendants’ denial \nemail for her June 24, 2020 application.  \n103.  In this new permit application, Plaintiff Turner requested a permit for a \ndemonstration on June 28, 2020 at the Historic Courthouse from 6p.m. to 8p.m. for up to \neight people.  \n104.  The application included Plaintiff Turner’s complete address and stated that \nprotestors would be social distancing at least 6 feet apart, wearing masks, and not yelling \nor chanting, although they would be holding signs.  \n105.  On June 27, 2020 at 7:04 p.m., Assistant Chief Cole wrote to Plaintiff \nTurner informing her that she would “need to seek written permission from Alamance \nCounty to be on the grounds of county property” and asked her to resubmit her \napplication with that written permission included.  \n106.  Plaintiff Turner replied that demonstrators would protest on the grass at the \nHistoric Courthouse or on the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Historic Courthouse.  \n107.  Assistant Chief Cole replied that she was unable to issue a permit for group \ndemonstration due to the Mayor’s June 27, 2020 State of Emergency order. \n  25\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 25 of 39\n\n \n108.  Plaintiff Turner then cancelled the planned demonstration out of fear that \nparticipants would be arrested if they demonstrated in Graham without a permit. \n109.  Plaintiff Turner plans to continue to organize group demonstrations outside \nthe Historic Courthouse in the near future. \nTerence Colin Dodd \n110.  Plaintiff Dodd, with his mouth and nose covered for COVID-19 \ntransmission prevention, peacefully approached the Confederate monument in front of \nthe Alamance County Historic Courthouse around 6:00a.m. on Saturday, June 27, 2020 \nholding a poster that read “Black Lives Matter.” \n111.  One of Defendant Johnson’s deputies was in a squad car parked beside the \nmonument at the crosswalk. \n112.  As Plaintiff Dodd approached the monument with his sign, the deputy got \nout of the car, walked toward Plaintiff Dodd and ordered him to step back.   \n113.  The deputy had no mouth or nose covering to protect against COVID-19 \ntransmission. \n114.  Plaintiff Dodd asked the deputy to explain the ordinance or other legal \nauthority that permitted him to prevent Plaintiff Dodd from demonstrating at the \nConfederate monument on the Historic Courthouse steps.  \n115.  The deputy did not answer Plaintiff Dodd, but instead called on his radio \nfor backup. \n116.  A half dozen squad cars arrived, and eight to ten Sheriff deputies. \n  26\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 26 of 39\n\n \n117.  Plaintiff felt overwhelmed and fearful, but kept saying to the deputies, “Tell \nme the law, tell me what law I'm breaking,” and asking if he was under arrest.  \n118.  GPD officers then arrived and told Plaintiff Dodd that he could not be on \nCounty property but could walk on the sidewalk across the street from the Confederate \nmonument so long as he was alone, not with a group. \n119.  Because he did not want to get arrested, Plaintiff Dodd obeyed the officers \nand the deputies and walked alone on the sidewalk with his sign until close to 10:00a.m., \nwhen he left. \nNerissa Rivera \n120.  On June 27, 2020 Plaintiff Nerissa Rivera was planning to go to the protest \nin Graham organized by Plaintiff Turner. She had seen the protest announced on \nFacebook. \n121.  Plaintiff Rivera opposes the Confederate Monument standing outside the \nAlamance Historic Courthouse because it represents murder, inequality, and racism. It \nfrustrates her to see law enforcement wasting taxpayer money protecting the monument \nwhen there was real public safety work that needed to be done in the county.  \n122.  Before she got to Graham on June 27, she learned that Plaintiff Turner had \ncancelled the demonstration because she could not get a permit from the City and did not \nwant anyone to get arrested or injured.  \n123.  Plaintiff Rivera decided to go to downtown Graham and protest alone.  \n  27\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 27 of 39\n\n \n124.  Before going out to the monument to protest, Plaintiff Rivera joined some \nfriends at a restaurant near the Historic Courthouse. \n125.  Plaintiff Rivera joined a group to walk with a friend back to her car, and \nthey walked in pairs, six feet apart on the sidewalk together to comply with COVID-19 \nprecautions.  \n126.  When they crossed the street, two Graham police officers approached \nPlaintiff Rivera and her friends and told them they could not protest. \n127.  Members of the group responded to the officers that they were not \nprotesting, and explained they were walking their friend to her car. \n128.  Officers said they would allow them to walk to the car but would not allow \nthem to protest. Officers instructed the group that if they started to protest, they would be \nordered to leave or disperse.  \n129.  Plaintiff Rivera and the group entered a local business owned by a Black \nwoman, and then exited to walk their friend to her car. \n130.  Plaintiff Rivera and her group walked a second time along the path they \nhad just taken. \n131.  Officers approached again and ordered Plaintiff Rivera and her group to \ndisperse. \n132.  Across the street, there was a group of white people with Confederate flags. \nMembers of Plaintiff Rivera’s group asked the officers why the other group with \nConfederate flags was not ordered to leave.  \n  28\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 28 of 39\n\n \n133.  Graham police officers responded that they had not been instructed to \nconcentrate on the area where the other group with the Confederate flags was located.  \n134.  Plaintiff Rivera left the scene without being able to demonstrate with her \ngroup.  \n135.  Plaintiff Rivera had intended to join a protest at the Historic Courthouse \nwhich was cancelled as a result of the denial of Plaintiff Turner’s permit. She attempted \nto walk around the Historic Courthouse in protest and was threatened by police. She \nintends to continue her efforts to protest the presence of the Confederate monument at the \nAlamance Historic Courthouse. \nDestiny Clarke \n136.  Plaintiff Destiny Clarke arrived in downtown Graham on June 28, 2020 at \napproximately 7:00p.m. \n137.  Defendant Peterman’s June 27, 2020 order prohibiting group \ndemonstrations was in effect.  \n138.  Plaintiff Clarke exited her car and began walking alone and silently on \nWest Elm Street carrying a “Black Lives Matter” sign.  \n139.  As she turned onto the sidewalk on NW Court Square, she was stopped by \na GPD officer who threatened to arrest her if she did not leave the area.  \n140.  The officer told Plaintiff Clarke that there is no protesting allowed and she \nneeded to leave or be arrested.  \n  29\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 29 of 39\n\n \n141.  Plaintiff Clarke replied, “I don’t have to leave because it’s a public place \nand it’s before curfew.”  \n142.  The officer persisted in threatening to arrest her if she did not leave. \n143.  Plaintiff Clarke offered to throw away her sign and then threw it away. \n144.   As she was throwing away “Black Lives Matter” sign, the officer \ncontinued to threaten to arrest her if she did not leave.  \n145.  Once she threw away her sign, the officer left.  \n146.  During the interaction, a family passed by carrying ice cream and the \nofficer did not interact with them or ask them to leave.  \n147.  Plaintiff Clarke believes that she was threatened with arrest specifically \nbecause she was carrying a sign with a political message.  \n148.  She was not permitted to walk alone on the public sidewalk in Graham, \napparently because she was carrying a poster with anti-racist speech on it.  \n149.  Plaintiff Clarke plans to continue to protest at the Alamance Historic \nCourthouse in the near future. \nAnnie Simpson \n150.  On June 29, 2020 at 3:25p.m., Plaintiff Annie Simpson called the GPD to \ninquire about how to apply for a permit to demonstrate at the Alamance County Historic \nCourthouse.  \n151.  Assistant Chief Kristy Cole informed Plaintiff Simpson that she would have \nto submit written permission from the Alamance County Manager’s Office along with her \n  30\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 30 of 39\n\n \napplication for demonstration permit in order to hold a permitted demonstration at the \nHistoric Courthouse. \n152.  On June 29, 2020 at 4:02p.m., Plaintiff Simpson called Defendant \nHagood’s office to inquire about the process of acquiring written permission to \ndemonstrate at the Alamance County Historic Courthouse.  \n153.  Plaintiff Simpson informed the individual who answered the phone in \nDefendant Hagood’s office that she was applying for a protest permit with GPD and that \nthe protest would be on county property at the Historic Courthouse.  \n154.  Plaintiff Simpson asked for Defendant Hagood’s email address so she could \nrequest the written permission GPD told her was needed. The person she spoke with \nasked her what she needed the permit for, and she answered that she was applying for a \nprotest permit. After waiting on hold, Plaintiff Simpson was told, “I’m not sure why \nGraham is telling you to contact the County Manager because the county does not issue \nany kind of protest permits. You’ll have to go through the City of Graham.”  \n155.  Plaintiff Simpson explained again that she had been told by Assistant Chief \nCole that she needed to gain written permission from the County Manager before she \ncould even apply for a permit to demonstrate on the grass or steps outside the Alamance \nCounty Historical Courthouse.  \n156.  Defendant Hagood’s staff person responded that no protest would be \nallowed on courthouse grounds.  \n  31\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 31 of 39\n\n \n157.  Plaintiff Simpson asked for clarification and Defendant’s staff  person \nrepeated that no protests are allowed on courthouse grounds.  \n158.  Plaintiff Simpson again requested Defendant Hagood’s email address so \nshe could send a written request and the staff person gave it to her. \n159.  On June 29, 2020 at 4:08p.m., Plaintiff Simpson sent Defendant Haygood \nthe following email requesting written permission to demonstrate on the steps and/or \ngrass of the Alamance County Historic Courthouse: \n \n160.  As of this filing, Plaintiff Simpson has yet to receive a reply to her email \nand is therefore unable to even begin the process of requesting a permit from Graham to \ndemonstrate at the Alamance County Historic Courthouse.  \n \n  32\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 32 of 39\n\n \n \n \nAdam Rose \n161.  Plaintiff Adam Rose became concerned about police and governmental \noverreaction to peaceful protests in Graham in early June 2020. \n162.  On June 9, 2020, Plaintiff Rose attended the Graham City Council meeting \nand attempted to express his concerns. One of the Council Members stood up and walked \nout of the room while Plaintiff Rose was presenting his case. \n163.  On June 2, 2020, Plaintiff Rose passed by the Historic Courthouse Square \nand was surprised to see neo-confederate demonstrators near the monument openly \ncarrying firearms, in contravention of state law regarding public demonstrations. \n164.  On June 26, 2020 Plaintiff Rose filed an application for a permit to \ndemonstrate at Historic Courthouse Square. Plaintiff Rose indicated he planned to attend \nwith five others on June 28 for a two-hour period.  \n165.  On June 27, Assistant Chief Cole informed Plaintiff Rose that his permit \nhad been denied, and that no permits would be issued for an indefinite period of time. \n166.  On June 28, after contacting Graham Police and getting their permission, \nPlaintiff Rose went by himself and displayed a sign across from the Historic Courthouse \nfor approximately two hours. He was not bothered by the police during this time. \nPlaintiff Gregory Drumwright \n  33\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 33 of 39\n\n \n167.  On July 1, 2020, Plaintiff Drumwright applied for a permit to hold a large \ndemonstration at the Historic Courthouse square in Graham on July 11. \n168.  Soon after emailing the permit application to the GPD, Plaintiff Drumwright \nreceived an emailed acknowledgement of receipt of his application stating that it would be \nforwarded to GPD Lieutenant Flood, who would then follow up with Plaintiff Drumwright, \n169.   Plaintiff Drumwright later telephoned Lt. Flood, who told Plaintiff that he \nhad seen Plaintiff’s application and would get back to him about it.   \n170.  To date, Lieutenant Flood has not responded to Plaintiff’s subsequent calls \nor otherwise given Plaintiff any information about the status of his application. \n171.  Plaintiff Drumwright was concerned that Defendants will not advise him \nwhether his permit is granted in sufficient time to be able to plan and make arrangements \nfor the July 11 demonstration.  \n172.  For that reason, on July 1, Plaintiff Drumwright called Graham’s Assistant \nCity Manager, Aaron Holland, concerning his permit application. \n173.  Mr. Holland told Plaintiff Drumwright that Defendant Johnson was not \nallowing any permits for protests to be issued. \n174.  Plaintiff Drumwright plans to go to Graham on July 4, 2020 accompanied by \nother community members who have been denied their civil rights, to demonstrate and \nprotest peaceably in and around the courthouse square in Graham.  \n  34\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 34 of 39\n\n \n175.  Those community members have witnessed white people who want to keep \nthe  Confederate  monument  demonstrating  in  the  same  public  space  without  any \ninterference by any law enforcement officers.  \n176.  However, those who oppose the monument because it glorifies the legacy of \nslavery  and  racial  oppression  of  African  Americans  in  Alamance  County  have  been \ndispersed from that same property by law enforcement officers.  \n177.  On July 4, Plaintiff Drumwright intends to protest Graham’s ordinance and \nDefendants’ violation of people’s rights to protest against white supremacy, police brutality \nand racial oppression. \n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \nVIOLATION OF FREE EXPRESSION, FREE ASSOCIATION, AND ASSEMBLY \nRIGHTS UNDER THE FIRST AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE \nUNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants \n \n178.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n179.  Plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the free \nexpression, free association, and assembly rights protected under the First and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiff NAACP asserts this claim on behalf of \nitself and its members. \n  35\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 35 of 39\n\n \n180.  In the following paragraphs, references to the First Amendment include the \nFirst Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n181.  The  ordinance  impermissibly  burdens  protected  speech,  assembly,  and \nassociation, including protests that oppose institutional racism, police brutality, and the \ncontinued presence of Confederate monuments in Graham. \n182.  The ordinance is a content-based regulation that prohibits constitutionally \nprotected speech meant to protest or make known “any position.” \n183.  The ordinance, which prohibits protests of any size anywhere in the city \nwithout 24 hours of advance notice and permission from the police chief, is not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling or substantial government interest, and fails to leave open \nample alternative channels of communication. \n184.  The ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint because it invests officers \nwith sweeping discretion to suppress speech. \n185.  Defendants’ denial of attempts by Plaintiffs and countless other speakers to \nprotest in front of the Alamance County Historic Courthouse in Graham’s town square is \nalso  an  unreasonable  time,  place,  and  manner  restriction  and  unconstitutional  prior \nrestraint. \nCOUNT TWO \nVIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nOn Behalf of All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants \n \n  36\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 36 of 39\n\n \n186.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set \nforth herein. \n187.  Plaintiffs assert a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of due \nprocess  rights  protected  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S.  Constitution. \nPlaintiff NAACP asserts this claim on behalf of itself and its members. \n188.  The ordinance is void for vagueness because it fails to provide Plaintiffs and \ncountless other speakers with fair notice of what standards they must satisfy in order to be \npermitted to protest, assemble, or march anywhere in the City, and because it invites \narbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. \n189.  The ordinance additionally violates Plaintiffs’ right to travel and freedom of \nmovement under the Fourteenth Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to a \ncompelling or substantial government interest.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the following relief:  \n(a)  Temporarily restrain and preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Ordinance; \n(b)   Order Defendants to immediately notify their officers, agents, employees, and \nother  persons  in  active  concert  or  participation  with  them,  if  preliminary \ninjunctive relief is entered; \n(c)  Enter a declaratory judgment stating that the Ordinance violates Plaintiffs’ \nrights to free speech and assembly, due process, and freedom of movement \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution;  \n  37\nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 1   Filed 07/02/20   Page 37 of 39\n\n \n(d)  Enter a permanent injunction enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance; \n(e)  Enter a  declaratory judgment  stating  that  Defendants  must allow the free \nexercise of First Amendment rights to assembly and speech at the Historic \nCourthouse square and on any other public property; \n(f)  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and as otherwise permitted by law; and \n(g)  Order such other relief as this Court deems just and equitable. \n \nRespectfully submitted this 2nd day of July 2020, \n/s/ Kristi L.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA \nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE  \nADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE, \net al.,   \nPlaintiffs, \nCivil Action No. ____________ \nv. \nORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED \nJERRY PETERMAN, et al., \nDefendants. \nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR  \nA TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nNATURE OF THIS ACTION \nPlaintiffs challenge and seek preliminary relief against enforcement of Chapter 18, \nArt. VI of the City of Graham (“City”), North Carolina’s Code of Ordinances (“the \nOrdinance”). The Ordinance makes it unlawful for any person to gather with anyone else, \nor even walk on their own, “for the purpose of protesting” or “making known any position \nor thought” anywhere in the City without first obtaining the Chief of Police’s permission \nat least 24 hours in advance. It grants the Chief discretion to deny a permit application \nbased on vague and, in effect, content- and viewpoint-based standards. It bans the exercise \nof any speech or assembly rights by minors unless they obtain the discretionary permission \nof the Chief. And it allows the Chief to limit even permitted gatherings to six people and \norder their dispersal upon any violation of the permit, no matter how small. \n1 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 1 of 26\n\nThe Ordinance unconstitutionally burdens Plaintiffs and countless others who seek \nto exercise their First Amendment rights to speak, assemble, and associate in Graham. This \nincludes individuals who, like Plaintiffs, have been moved by the recent killing of George \nFloyd and the broader reality of police brutality around the country, and who seek to protest \nthe continued presence of Confederate monuments on government property, including at \nthe Alamance County Historic Courthouse in the middle of Graham.  \nThe Ordinance targets expression and is not narrowly tailored to achieve any \ncompelling  government  interest.  In  addition,  it  constitutes  an  unconstitutional  prior \nrestraint. It thus violates the First Amendment both facially and as applied to Plaintiffs. \nThe  Ordinance  is  also  impermissibly  vague  in  violation  of  due  process.  By  forcing \nPlaintiffs to choose between forgoing their constitutional rights or facing the threat of \nsanctions or arrest, the Ordinance imposes ongoing, irreparable harm on Plaintiffs. Indeed, \nthe Supreme Court struck down a nearly identical ordinance more than 50 years ago in \nShuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147 (1969); the Eastern District of North \nCarolina did the same only one year later, see Underwood v. City Council of Greenville, \n316 F. Supp. 956 (E.D.N.C. 1970); and the Fourth Circuit did so just 15 years ago, see Cox \nv. City of Charleston, 416 F.3d 281 (4th Cir. 2005). This Court should do the same and \nenjoin enforcement of the Ordinance. \n \n \n \n  2 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 2 of 26\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  The Ordinance \nThe Ordinance provides that “[n]o parade, picket line or group demonstration is \npermitted on the sidewalks or streets of the city unless a permit therefor has been issued by \nthe city.” Ch.18, Art. VI. § 18-175.1 It defines group demonstration as “any assembly \ntogether or concert of action between two or more persons for the purpose of protesting \nany matter or making known any position or thought of the group or of attracting attention \nthereto”; defines parade as “any parade, march, ceremony, show, exhibition or procession \nof any kind in or upon the public streets, sidewalks, parks or other public places”; and \ndefines picket line as “any persons formed together for the purpose of making known any \nposition or promotion of said persons or on behalf of any organization.” Id. § 18-172.2  \nTo run the permit scheme, the Ordinance authorizes the Chief of Police to, in \nrelevant part,  \n(1) Require a written application . . . to be filed 24 hours in advance of such parade, \npicket line or group demonstration . . . \n \n(2) Refuse to issue such permit when the activity or purpose stated in the application \nwould violate any ordinance of the city or statute of the state, or when the activity \nor purpose would endanger the public health or safety, or hinder or prevent the \norderly movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic on the sidewalks or streets \nof the city. \n                                                 \n1 The full text of the ordinance is available through the City of Graham’s website at \nhttps://library.municode.com/nc/graham/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_\nCH18STSIOTPUPL_ARTVIPADEPE.  \n \n2 The Ordinance specifically exempts “funeral processions,” “students going to and from \nschool classes or participating in [supervised] educational activities,” and “governmental \nagenc[ies] acting within the scope of [their] functions.” Id. § 18-173. \n  3 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 3 of 26\n\n \n(3) Specify in the permit whether or not minors below the age of 18 years will be \npermitted to participate. The chief of police or, in his absence, the next highest \nranking police officer of the city on duty shall pass upon whether or not minors \nbelow the age of 18 years shall be permitted to participate . . . and shall base his \ndetermination upon whether or not the purpose, time or place of the participation \nwill be detrimental to or endanger the health, welfare or safety of said minors. \n \nId. § 18-178.  \nIn addition, the Ordinance provides that, before issuing a permit, the Chief of \nPolice or other designated officer must, “among other considerations provided,” find that \nthe activity will not (1) “require excessive diversion of police from other necessary \nduties”; (2) “interfere with the right of property owners in the area to enjoy peaceful \noccupancy and use of their property”; or (3) “unreasonabl[y] interfere[] with normal \nvehicular or pedestrian traffic in the area, . . . prevent normal police or fire protection to \nthe public, [or] . . . be likely to cause injury to persons or property or provoke \ndisorderly conduct or create a public disturbance.” Id. § 18-179.  \nIf the Chief grants the permit, he then has complete discretion to limit the protest \nor other gathering to “not more than six persons . . . [in] the entire width of [the] street or \nsidewalk within . . . 100 feet.” Id. § 18-181. During a permitted parade, demonstration, or \npicket, he also has discretion to “establish lines for separation of the general public from \nsuch [protest] activity” and make it “unlawful for any person to . . . cross such lines.” Id. \n§ 18-174. And he can order individuals to disperse upon a violation of any of the terms of \nthe permit. Id. § 18-176. If individuals fail to disperse, they may be arrested under N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 14-288.5. \n  4 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 4 of 26\n\nThe Ordinance also makes it illegal for any minor to be present at an expressive \ngathering without explicit permission from the Chief—and it authorizes him to deny \nsuch permission upon his own determination that attending would be “detrimental to or \nendanger [the minor’s] health, welfare or safety.” Ch. 18, Art. VI §§ 18-177, 178. Each \nviolation of the Ordinance is “punishable as a misdemeanor, subject to a fine not to \nexceed $500.” Ch. 1 § 1-12. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Protests \n \nPlaintiffs  regularly  seek  to  exercise  their  First  Amendment  rights  to  protest, \nassemble, and associate in Graham to speak out against institutionalized racism and white \nsupremacy,  police  violence against  Black  people,  and  the  continued  presence  of  the \nConfederate  monument  in  front  of  the  Alamance  County  Historic  Courthouse \n(“Confederate Monument”) in the City’s town square. Because of the Ordinance, however, \nPlaintiffs have been chilled from and threatened with arrest for exercising their rights.  \n Plaintiff  Alamance  County  Branch  of  the  National  Association  for  the \nAdvancement of Colored People (“NAACP”) and its members seek to protest racialized \npolice violence and the Confederate Monument. NAACP Decl. ¶ 4. Due to the Ordinance, \nNAACP has been forced to divert resources to assess, plan for, and educate its members \nabout public assemblies and demonstrations in Graham, including by applying for a permit \nto protest the Confederate Monument, racialized policing of their community, unjust and \nunequal treatment by Alamance courts and law enforcement officers of Black individuals, \nand police brutality. Id. ¶ 7.  The NAACP is concerned that its request may be denied under \n  5 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 5 of 26\n\nthe Ordinance’s subjective standards, and also that the delay caused by waiting for the \nCity’s response will limit attendance and hinder planning for their protest. Id. ¶ 8. \nPlaintiff Tamara O. Kersey, a Black woman who is from Graham, has attended \nvigils and rallies elsewhere in Alamance County to protest racist police brutality in the \nwake of the killing of George Floyd, but she has not protested in her hometown. Kersey \nDecl. ¶¶ 2, 3, 7. The Ordinance has placed her in reasonable fear of being sanctioned for \ndoing so without a permit. Id. ¶ 4. Rather than forgo exercising her constitutional rights, \nshe  has  subjected  herself  to  Graham’s  permit  system,  but,  like  the  NAACP,  she  is \nconcerned that her request may be denied under the Ordinance’s subjective standards, and \nalso that the delay caused by waiting for the City’s response will limit attendance and \nhinder her planned protest. Id. ¶¶ 5, 8–9. \nPlaintiff Gregory Drumwright is a Black man who grew up just outside the city \nlimits of Graham, North Carolina and still has family living there. Drumwright Decl. ¶ 2. \nHe is a social justice activist and organizer, university professor, and Senior Minister at the \nCitadel Church in Greensboro, North Carolina where he now lives. Although Plaintiff \nDrumwright subjected himself to Graham’s permit system to seek permission for a racial \njustice demonstration at the Historic Courthouse square on July 11, the City Assistant \nManager informed him that Defendant Peterman has disallowed the issuance of any \npermits for protests. Id. ¶ 6. Plaintiff Drumwright plans to go to the Courthouse square \nwithout seeking a permit on July 4, 2020 to peacefully protest with other community \nmembers. Id. ¶ 7.  \n  6 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 6 of 26\n\nPlaintiff Colleen Tenae Turner, a 23-year-old Black woman, grew up in Alamance \nCounty and went to school in Graham. Turner Decl. ¶ 2. She recalls joyously marching \naround the court square as a member of her school’s marching band; but now that she \nwould like to raise her concerns with racism in Graham, express support for Black lives, \nand advocate for removal of the Confederate Monument, she finds herself far less free to \nspeak out due to the Ordinance. Id. ¶¶ 2–6. In this moment, she would like to gather with \nothers because such assemblies have granted her relief and comfort in the past. Id. ¶¶ 3, \n17–18.  She  sought  a  permit  to  do  precisely  that  in  Graham  on  June  24,  2020,  but \nDefendants denied her request in part because Defendants believe the protest might (1) \ninterfere with property owners’ rights to “enjoy peaceful occupancy and use of their \nproperty,” (2) divert excessive police from other necessary duties, and (3) “further enhance \nthe fear and concerns that [local business owners] have.” Id. ¶ 9.   \nFollowing Defendants’ denial, Plaintiff Turner sought a permit on June 27, 2020 a \nsmaller gathering of eight people, including a minor, for the next day. Id. ¶¶ 10–12.  \nDefendants denied that request as well, on the basis of an unfounded State of Emergency \norder that the City has since rescinded.  Id. ¶ 15. This Fourth of July weekend, Plaintiff \nTurner would like to be able to spontaneously assemble with a group of less than 10 people \nand walk along the public sidewalks of Graham and protest, without seeking a permit. Id. \n¶ 17. She intends to continue her attempts to organize permitted protests, but is reasonably \nconcerned that the City will continue to stifle her efforts and silence her voice. Id. ¶¶ 17–\n18. \n  7 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 7 of 26\n\nPlaintiff Nerissa Rivera is a 59-year-old Latina woman who had planned to attend \nthe June 27, 2020 protest for which Plaintiff Turner sought a permit. She opposes the \ncontinued presence of the Confederate Monument, which she sees as a representation of \nmurder, inequality, and racism. Rivera Decl. ¶¶ 1–5. After learning that the City denied \nPlaintiff Turner’s permit and subsequently suspended the issuance of all permits under the \nbaseless State of Emergency order that has since been rescinded, Plaintiff Rivera decided \nto go to downtown Graham and protest by herself. Id. ¶¶ 6–8. While in Graham, she met a \ngroup of other activists for lunch. Id. ¶¶ 9–10. As they were walking back to one woman’s \ncar in pairs, socially distancing on the sidewalk, they were stopped by officers who told \nthem they could not protest and that, if they started to protest, the officers would order them \nto leave. Id. ¶¶ 11–16. Plaintiff Rivera and her fellow activists left briefly and then walked \nback along the same path. Id. ¶¶ 17–18. That time, the officers ordered them to disperse, \nalthough they allowed a group of white people with Confederate flags to congregate across \nthe road. Id. ¶¶ 19–21.  \nThis Fourth of July weekend, Plaintiff Rivera would like to be able to spontaneously \nprotest with a small group on the public sidewalks near the monument in Graham, but is \nunable to do so due to the Ordinance’s advance permit requirement. Id. Decl. ¶¶ 23–24. \nPlaintiff Destiny Clarke is a 27-year-old white woman who lives near Graham and \nhas sought to demonstrate in the City to protest white supremacy, support the Black Lives \nMatter movement, and oppose the Confederate Monument. Clarke Decl. ¶¶ 9, 15. On June \n28, 2020, Ms. Clarke walked alone in downtown Graham, silently carrying a “Black Lives \n  8 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 8 of 26\n\nMatter” sign. Id. ¶¶ 3–4. As she neared the courthouse square, a City officer stopped her, \ntold her that protesting is prohibited, and threatened to arrest her if she did not leave the \narea. Id. ¶¶ 4–7. Concerned that she would be arrested for exercising her First Amendment \nrights, Ms. Clarke offered to throw away her sign, and subsequently did so. Id. ¶¶ 8–10. \nThe officer then left. Ms. Clarke wants to continue protesting in Graham, but is reasonably \nconcerned that she may be arrested or fined for doing so. Id. ¶¶ 13–15. \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED \n1.  Do Plaintiffs demonstrate a likelihood of success on their claims that: \na.  the Ordinance violates the First Amendment?; \nb.  the Ordinance violates the Due Process Clause? \n2.  Do Plaintiffs satisfy the other requirements for preliminary injunctive relief? \nARGUMENT \n  To obtain a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of at least one of their claims; they \nare  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  a  temporary  restraining  order  or  preliminary \ninjunction is not granted; the equities favor preliminary injunctive relief; and such relief \nserves the public interest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); see \nalso U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Wolf Run Mining Co., 452 F.3d 275, 281 n.1 (4th Cir. 2006) \n(substantive standard for temporary restraining order is same as for preliminary injunction). \nPlaintiffs satisfy each of these requirements. \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \n \n  9 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 9 of 26\n\nPlaintiffs have a likelihood of success because the Ordinance imposes a content-\nbased restriction on their protected speech, assembly, and association in a manner that is \nnot tailored to any valid state interest. In addition, it constitutes an unconstitutional prior \nrestraint because it vests Defendants with sweeping discretion to suppress speech and is \nnot a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. The Ordinance is also void for \nvagueness. \nA. The Ordinance violates the First Amendment. \ni.  The Ordinance is a content-based law that fails strict scrutiny. \n“[I]t is a prized American privilege to speak one’s mind.” New York Times Co. v. \nSullivan,  376  U.S.  254,  269  (1964).  The  First  Amendment  was  designed  “to  assure \nunfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes \ndesired by the people.” Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484 (1957). And it reflects our \n“profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues”—including \npolice  brutality,  racism  in  government  institutions,  and  the  presence  of  Confederate \nmonuments on government land— “should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open[.]” New \nYork Times, 376 U.S. at 270. Such speech “is more than self-expression; it is the essence \nof self-government.” Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74–75 (1964). Political protest \n“has always rested on the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values.” Carey \nv. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 467 (1980). \nRather than recognize the value of free speech in a democracy, the Ordinance \nattempts to suppress it—and it does so in a content-based manner. The First Amendment \n  10 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 10 of 26\n\nprohibits the government from “defin[ing] regulated speech by its function or purpose.” \nReed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015). Yet that is precisely what the Ordinance \ndoes by specifically regulating those who assemble “for the purpose of protesting or \nmaking known any position or thought of the group or of attracting attention thereto.” \nCh. 18, Art. VI § 18-172. And it expressly exempts funeral processions, students going to \neducational activities, and government agencies. Id. § 18-173. “On its face, the [Ordinance \nis] content-based because it applie[s] or [does] not apply as a result of content, that is, ‘the \ntopic discussed or the idea or message expressed.’” Cent. Radio Co. Inc. v. City of Norfolk, \n811 F.3d 625, 633 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting Reed, 576 U.S. at 163).  \nPlaintiffs’ experience bears this out: Defendants told Ms. Rivera that she could not \nwalk in pairs with others in protest but could walk with them to get to her car. See Rivera \nDecl. ¶¶ 11–16. And Defendants threatened to arrest Ms. Clarke while she was walking \ndown the street carrying a “Black Lives Matter” sign, but left after she threw her sign away. \nSee Clarke Decl. ¶¶ 4–10. \n“[T]he Constitution demands that content-based restrictions on speech be presumed \ninvalid and that the Government bear the burden of showing their constitutionality,” \nAshcroft v. Am. Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. 656, 660 (2004) (citations omitted), by \nestablishing that “the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” Reed, 576 U.S. at 171. Defendants cannot satisfy this standard. It is \nclear from the face of the Ordinance that the only interest served by the law is silencing \n  11 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 11 of 26\n\nprotest, see, e.g., Ch. 18, Art. VI § 18-172 (defining “group demonstration” specifically to \ninclude those “protesting any matter”). That is plainly impermissible.  \nEven if the City’s interest in the Ordinance were compelling, the ban on any protest, \nassembly, and parade by any individual or group anywhere in the City without a permit \nwould violate the Constitution because it is not tailored to that interest. As the Supreme \nCourt has recognized, a total ban on expression on public sidewalks does not substantially \nserve any government purpose. See United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 182 (1983).  \nThe Fourth Circuit’s opinion in Cox v. City of Charleston is particularly instructive \non this point. There, the court struck down a city ordinance remarkably like the one at issue \nhere on First Amendment grounds. That ordinance made it illegal to “organize, hold or \nparticipate in any parade, meeting, exhibition, assembly, or procession . . . on the streets or \nsidewalks of the city” without a permit. Cox, 416 F.3d at 283. While recognizing that “it \nmay be true that the permit requirement succeeds in mitigating the potential of any of the \nactivities listed in the Ordinance to threaten the safety, order, and accessibility of city \nstreets and sidewalks,” the Fourth Circuit held that “it does so at too high a cost, namely, \nby significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not impede the City’s \npermissible goals.” Id. at 285 (alterations, marks, and citation omitted).  \nThe Fourth Circuit set forth a series of hypotheticals to highlight the troubling reach \nof that ordinance, each of which is equally applicable here: “Consider three friends who \nare walking along the sidewalk in downtown . . . They come upon a newspaper stand \ndisplaying a headline that outrages them. So moved by the headline, they walk to the end \n  12 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 12 of 26\n\nof the street and hold up handmade signs protesting the headline.” Under the Ordinance, \ntheir expression is illegal even if it “does nothing to disturb the peace, block the sidewalk, \nor interfere with traffic.” Id. at 286. “Similarly, the Ordinance criminalizes a small meeting \nof individuals who gather on the sidewalk [downtown] . . . to hand out religious tracts \nwithout first obtaining a permit, even if their expression does nothing to disturb or disrupt \nthe flow of sidewalk traffic.” Id. “Indeed, any group of individuals who gather together on \nthe sidewalks for a ‘meeting’ or ‘assembly’—no matter how innocuous—is in violation of \nthe Ordinance unless the group first obtains a permit from the city administrator.” Id.  \nRecognizing this lack of tailoring, the Fourth Circuit held “that the Ordinance \n‘burden[s]  substantially  more  speech  than  is  necessary  to  further  the  government's \nlegitimate interests,’ and therefore facially violates the First Amendment.” Id. (quoting \nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989)). The same reasoning applies to \nthe Ordinance at issue here.  \nIn  addition,  the  Fourth  Circuit  held  that  “the  unflinching  application  of  the \nOrdinance to groups as small as two or three renders it constitutionally infirm” and that \n“[s]pontaneous  expression,  which  is  often  the  most  effective  kind  of  expression,  is \nprohibited by the Ordinance,” id. at 285–86 (alterations omitted). The Ordinance also \nshares those constitutional infirmities, which further highlight the insufficient tailoring. \nii. The Ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint. \nWhile the Supreme Court has approved reasonable permit requirements for large \ndemonstrations, Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 574 (1941), “any system of prior \n  13 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 13 of 26\n\nrestraints” bears “a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.” Bantam Books, \nInc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963). The Fourth Circuit has stated unequivocally that \n“[a]n ordinance that requires individuals or groups to obtain a permit before engaging in \nprotected speech is a prior restraint on speech” and “the City bears the burden of proving \nits constitutionality.” Cox, 416 F.3d at 284 (citations omitted).   \nDecades of Supreme Court precedent make clear that “a law subjecting the exercise \nof First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, \nand definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional.” Shuttlesworth, \n394 U.S. at 150–51. “It is settled . . . that an ordinance which . . . makes the peaceful \nenjoyment  of  freedoms  which  the  Constitution  guarantees  contingent  upon  the \nuncontrolled will of an official—as by requiring a permit or license which may be granted \nor withheld in the discretion of such official—is an unconstitutional . . . prior restraint.” \nStaub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 322 (1958). See also Forsyth County v. Nationalist \nMovement, 505 U.S. 123, 133 (1992).   \nApplying this standard in Shuttlesworth, the Supreme Court invalidated an Alabama \nlaw that, much like the Ordinance, required a permit for “any parade or procession or other \npublic demonstration,” 394 U.S. at 149, and enabled the licensing authority to deny a \npermit if, in “its judgment[,] the public welfare, peace, safety, health, decency, good order, \nmorals or convenience require that it be refused,” id. at 149–50. The Court held that this \nwas unconstitutional because it gave the administrator “virtually unbridled and absolute \npower.” Id. at 150.  \n  14 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 14 of 26\n\nThe Graham Ordinance is no different. It requires a permit for any “parade, picket \nline or group demonstration” gathering “for the purpose of protesting any matter.” Ch. 18, \nArt. VI §§ 18-172, 175. The Police Chief has discretion to deny a permit if he believes the \nparade, picket line, or demonstration endangers “the public health or safety,” hinders \n“orderly movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic,” id. § 18-178(2), or is likely to “create \na public disturbance,” id. § 18-179(3). Moreover, the Police Chief may limit gatherings to \nsix people in areas with “normally heavy pedestrian or vehicular traffic,” or set another \nhigher number if “in his judgment, conditions permit” him to do so.  \nIndeed, the standards governing consideration of permits in the Ordinance are even \nmore constitutionally suspect than those at issue in Shuttlesworth. The Ordinance invites \ndiscriminatory enforcement against disfavored views by authorizing the Police Chief to \ndeny  a  permit  where,  in  his  judgment,  a  proposed  assembly  will  “require  excessive \ndiversion of police from other necessary duties,” without any objective standards. This \nprovision allows the government to suppress views that officials fear will draw large \ncrowds either of supporters or counter-demonstrators.  \nIn Forsyth, the Supreme Court squarely rejected such a basis for regulation, holding \nthat the government cannot burden assemblies because “a controversial political message” \nwill be “delivered before a hostile audience.” 505 U.S. at 136. Instead, the Supreme Court \nstruck down a permit fee requirement that covered “the cost of maintaining public order” \nbecause it gave the administrator too much discretion. Id. at 134. As the Supreme Court \nexplained, such a standard is based on “the public’s reaction to the speech” and is therefore \n  15 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 15 of 26\n\nan impermissible justification for denying the right to protest. Id. Here, such a standard is \nused not to impose a fee, but to ban expression entirely.  \nIn Graham, the Ordinance is not only susceptible to discriminatory application, but \nit has in fact repeatedly been used to threaten Plaintiffs and prohibit them from protesting \nbecause of their support for racial justice and equality. See, e.g., Clarke Decl. ¶¶ 9–13; \nRivera Decl. ¶¶ 19–22; Turner Decl. ¶¶ 17–18.  \nIn addition, the Ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint because it fails to \nprovide notice or standards regarding how long the permit review process will take, or to \nrequire the government to provide a justification when a permit is denied. See Freedman \nv. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 58–60 (1965). These infirmities have hindered Plaintiffs in \nplanning  protests  even  when  they  have  chosen  to  submit  applications  to  the \nunconstitutional scheme. See NAACP Decl ¶ 8; Kersey Decl. ¶ 9. \niii.  The  Ordinance  is  not  a  reasonable  time,  place,  and  manner \nrestriction. \nEven if the Ordinance were viewed as content-neutral, it would nevertheless violate \nthe First Amendment. The Ordinance regulates speech in traditional public forums—\nstreets, sidewalks, and parks, which have “immemorially been held in trust for the use of \nthe public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating \nthought between citizens, and discussing public questions.” Hague v. Comm. for Indust. \nOrg.,  307  U.S.  496,  515  (1939).  In  such  spaces,  the  government  may  only  impose \n“reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the \nrestrictions ‘are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they \n  16 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 16 of 26\n\nare narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open \nample alternative channels for communication of the information.’” Ward, 491 U.S. at 791 \n(quoting Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984)).  \nTo satisfy this standard, “the government is obliged to demonstrate that it actually \ntried or considered less-speech-restrictive alternatives and that such alternatives were \ninadequate to serve the government’s interest.” Billups v. City of Charleston, 961 F.3d 673, \n688 (4th Cir. 2020). “Absent such a showing, [courts] cannot simply accept the City’s \nassurances that those other ordinances would be too difficult to enforce or would not \nsufficiently safeguard its interest.” Id. at 689. Defendants cannot make such a showing \nhere. \nAs noted above, the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve a significant \ngovernment interest. See Part I.A.i supra. The Ordinance presumptively bans all protest \nand assembly absent government permission everywhere in the City, without any attempt \nto tailor the restriction to, for example, the level of traffic in a particular place. “Rather than \nenforcing  a  prior  restraint  on  protected  expression,  cities  can  enforce  ordinances \nprohibiting and punishing conduct that disturbs the peace, blocks the sidewalks, or impedes \nthe flow of traffic.” Cox, 416 F.3d at 286. “Cities can also pass ordinances that ‘regulate \nonly the volume, location, or duration of [protected] expression,’ rather than subjecting all \nspeech to a permit requirement.” Id. (quoting Community for Creative Nonviolence v. \nTurner, 893 F.2d 1387, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). “At bottom, the legislative body can enact \na permit requirement that burdens expression only to the extent necessary to effectuate the \n  17 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 17 of 26\n\ncity's significant interests, and no more so.” Id. at 287. That is far from what the City has \ndone here. \nEqually,  because  the  Ordinance  prohibits  any  expressive  assembly  or  parade \nanywhere in the City without 24 hours advance notice to and permission from Defendants, \nand because it grants Defendants discretion “to establish lines for separation of the general \npublic from [protest] activity,” essentially removing traditional public forum status from \npublic land at Defendants’ whim, it fails to leave open ample alternative channels for \ncommunication. In addition, because the Ordinance allows the Chief to limit gatherings to \nsix people for every hundred feet—that is, the length of a nine-story building—it can serve \nas a functional bar to any mass protest or assembly, period.   \nB. The Ordinance is void for vagueness. \n“It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its \nprohibitions are not clearly defined.” Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 \n(1972). Due process requires clarity for two reasons. First, a vague law “fails to give \nordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes,” Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. \n2551, 2556 (2015), and second, it invites “arbitrary and discriminatory application” by \nfailing  to  provide  “explicit  standards  for  those  [government  actors]  who  apply  [it].” \nGrayned, 408 U.S. at 108–09. This principle applies to administrative, civil, and criminal \nprohibitions. See, e.g., FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239, 253–54 (2012) \n(civil fines); Gentile v. State Bar, 501 U.S. 1030, 1048–51 (1991) (state bar rule); United \n  18 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 18 of 26\n\nStates v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 128 F.3d 216, 224 (4th Cir. 1997) (environmental \nregulations).  \nWhere First Amendment rights are at stake, it is especially important that laws are \nclear. See Fox Television Stations, 567 U.S. at 253–54; Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, \n573 (1974); see also Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. 1204, 1228–29 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). Vague laws threaten to chill speech because they “inevitably lead citizens to \nsteer far wider of the unlawful zone.” Grayned, 408 U.S. at 109 (marks and citation \nomitted).  Moreover,  clarity  is  required  “based  in  part  on  the  need  to  eliminate  the \nimpermissible  risk  of  discriminatory  enforcement,  for  history  shows  that  speech  is \nsuppressed when either the speaker or the message is critical of those who enforce the law.” \nGentile, 501 U.S. at 1051 (citations omitted). That danger is particularly stark where, as \nhere, Plaintiffs aim to join a worldwide movement specifically addressing their grievances \nabout those who enforce the law.  \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that laws that, like the Ordinance, turn on \nterms such as “disturbing the peace,” are void for vagueness.  See, e.g., Ch. 18, Art. VI § \n18-179 (conditioning police issuance of permit on determination of whether the protest is \nlikely to “provoke disorderly conduct or create a public disturbance”). In Cox v. \nLouisiana, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a statute that prohibited \n“congregating with others with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under \ncircumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned.” 379 U.S. 536, 551 \n(1965) (marks and citation omitted); accord Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 527 (1972) \n  19 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 19 of 26\n\n(holding a “breach of the peace” statute void for vagueness); Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 U.S. 296, 308 (1940) (same). \nIn Cox v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court held that breach of the peace statutes are \nimpermissibly vague because they condition legality on the reaction of the speakers’ critics, \nmaking it impossible for speakers to predict whether they will be punished for their \nconstitutionally protected speech. See 379 U.S. at 552; see also Terminiello v. City of \nChicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4–5 (1949). The same is true here. Neither the police chief nor \nPlaintiffs can know whether their acts will provoke disorderly conduct or create a public \ndisturbance. That is up to their listeners, including critics. This Court should not sanction \nsuch a heckler’s veto. \nIndeed, fifty years ago, the District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina \nstruck  down  another  North  Carolina  city  ordinance  that  was  nearly  identical  to  the \nOrdinance at issue here as void for vagueness. Underwood v. City Council of Greenville, \n316 F. Supp. 956 (E.D.N.C. 1970). In that case, the ordinance read: \n[T]he chief of police . . . may refuse to issue a permit to march, \nparade, assemble, picket or demonstrate in any way when and \nif he determines that said activity would either constitute a \nclear and present danger to the public health or safety or would \n‘hinder  or  prevent  the  orderly  movement  of  pedestrian  or \nvehicular traffic on the streets, alleys, or sidewalks.’ Further \nthe chief or his designee may specify whether or not minors \nwill  be  allowed  to  participate  .  .  .  \n \n[A]mong other considerations, [the chief may] consider and \nfind as a requisite to issuance the following:  \n \n(1) the activity will not require excessive diversion of police from \nother necessary duties;  \n  20 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 20 of 26\n\n \n(2) the activity will not interfere with the right of property owners \nin the area to enjoy peaceful and lawful occupancy and use of \ntheir property;  \n \n(3) the  activity  can  be  conducted  without  unreasonable \ninterference with normal pedestrian or vehicular traffic in the \narea, and will not prevent normal police and fire protection to \nthe public, and will not be likely to cause injury to persons or \nproperty or to provoke disorderly conduct or to create a public \ndisturbance. \n \nId. at 960. The court held that it was “[c]lear[]” that this law—which is nearly identical to \nthe Ordinance—was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give notice as to what is \nconsidered a permissible assembly, and it failed to cabin the police chief’s discretion. Id.  \nLike  the  ordinance  declared  void  for  vagueness  in  Underwood,  the  Graham \nOrdinance enables the chief of police to “[r]efuse to issue [a] permit . . . when the activity \nor purpose would endanger the public health or safety,” Ch.18, Art. VI § 18-178(2), and \npermits are allowed only when the protest “will not interfere with the right of property \nowners in the area to enjoy peaceful occupancy” and “will not be likely to cause injury to \npersons or property or provoke disorderly conduct or create a public disturbance.” Id. § 18-\n179(2)–(3).3 As in Cox and Underwood, it is entirely unclear how speakers or the Police \nChief will know whether a demonstration is likely to fail or satisfy these standards. \nFinally, to the extent that it does anything, the provision stating that “nothing in this \nsection shall be construed to prevent the peaceful assembly of any group for orderly \n                                                 \n3 In fact, the ordinance is even vaguer than the law in Cox v. Louisiana, which at least had \na scienter requirement. See 379 U.S. at 551. \n  21 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 21 of 26\n\nexpression or communication between those assembled” only exacerbates the Ordinance’s \nvagueness. As the Fourth Circuit has recognized, laws that equivocate about the legality of \nconstitutionally protected acts are impermissibly vague. In Lytle v. Doyle, the Fourth \nCircuit held that a statute prohibiting “loitering” on a bridge was unconstitutionally vague \nbecause it was unclear whether protesting there qualified as loitering. 326 F.3d 463, 469 \n(4th Cir. 2003) (citing Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 57 (1999)).  \nGraham’s  Ordinance  shares  this  defect.  It  purports  to  reserve  space  for \nconstitutionally  protected  free  expression,  while  simultaneously  prohibiting  “any \n[unpermitted] assembly together or concert of action between two or more persons for the \npurpose of protesting any matter or making known any position or thought of the group[.]” \nCh. 18, Art. VI §§ 18–172, 18–175. Protesters could rightfully be unsure of whether they \nmay gather in public without a permit to express their viewpoints. If the permissibility of \nsuch an action depends on whether the expression is “between” those assembled or is \n“ma[de] known” to those nearby, do they need to whisper? This reasonable question \nillustrates the great potential for confusion inherent in this Ordinance; it is unclear to \nprotesters and open to discriminatory enforcement by the police. \nII.  Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed. \nPreliminary relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs.  Absent \nsuch  relief,  Plaintiffs  will  not  be  able  to  exercise  their  First  Amendment  freedoms, \nincluding by protesting over the coming weekend in small groups, in response to breaking \nnews, and/or without obstructing any traffic. “[L]oss of First Amendment freedoms, for \n  22 \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 3   Filed 07/03/20   Page 22 of 26\n\neven minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).  \nIII. The balance of equities and public interest favor preliminary relief.\nThe balance of equities also weighs in favor of Plaintiffs. The Ordinance obstructs \nPlaintiffs’ exercise of their constitutional rights, causing them great harm. Meanwhile, no \nharm will come to Defendants if Plaintiffs are allowed to engage in protected speech. See \nGiovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Bason, 303 F.3d 507, 521 (4th Cir. 2002) (injunction of a likely \nunconstitutional law does not harm the government). The balance therefore weighs in favor \nof an injunction. And upholding constitutional rights “surely serves” the public interest. Id. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction should be granted.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Kristi L.

Kersey, Colleen Tenae Turner, Terence \nColin Dodd, Destiny Clarke, Annie Simpson, Nerissa Rivera, Adam Rose, and Gregory \nDrumwright, move pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 and LR 65.1 for a preliminary \ninjunction prohibiting the defendants from prohibiting protests on outdoor spaces around \nthe Alamance County Historic Courthouse grounds.  After review of the evidence and \nupon consideration of arguments of counsel, and as found in more detail in the opinion \nand order filed concomitantly herewith, the Court finds and concludes: \n1.  The plaintiffs are likely to be successful on their claims that the County \nDefendants’ total prohibition of protests on the steps of, sidewalks \nsurrounding, and grounds of the Alamance County Historic Courthouse \nviolates their First Amendment rights.  The long-term total prohibition of \nprotests on these traditional public forums is not a time, place and manner \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 63   Filed 08/14/20   Page 1 of 3\n\nrestriction of speech, nor is it narrowly tailored to protect legitimate \ngovernmental interests.   \n2.  The plaintiffs regularly protest and currently plan to protest in the imminent \nfuture in the public spaces around the Square in Graham and want to protest in \nthe traditional public forum where the County Defendants have prohibited \nprotests. They are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief.   \n3.  The equities favor a preliminary injunction.   \n4.  A preliminary injunction restraining unconstitutional prohibitions on First \nAmendment rights serves the public interest.   \nBased on these findings and conclusions, and for reasons explained in more detail \nin an Order entered concomitantly herewith, it is ORDERED that: \n1.  The plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, Doc. 47, is GRANTED \nto the extent stated herein.   \n2.  The defendants Terry S. Johnson,  in his official capacity as the Sheriff of \nAlamance County; Eddie Boswell, in his official capacity as Alamance County \nCommissioner; Steve Carter, in his official capacity as Alamance County \nCommissioner; Bill Lashley, in his official capacity as Alamance County Commissioner; \nAmy Scott Galey, in her official capacity as Alamance County Commissioner; Tim \nSutton, in his official capacity as Alamance County Commissioner; and Bryan Hagood, \nin his official capacity as Alamance County Manager, and their officers, attorneys, \nagents, and employees and other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nthem are hereby RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED from prohibiting all protests on the \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 63   Filed 08/14/20   Page 2 of 3\n\nfollowing spaces in and around the Alamance County Historic Courthouse in Graham, \nNorth Carolina: \na.  the steps on the north, east, south, and west sides of the Courthouse \nsteps; \nb.  the lawns between the sidewalks and the Courthouse;  \nc.  the sidewalk encircling the Courthouse and the shorter walkways \nconnecting the steps on each side to that encircling sidewalk; and \nd.  the area marked “reserved” between the Courthouse sidewalk and the \nConfederate monument, where cars do not drive or park. \n3.  Nothing in this Order prohibits the defendants from imposing reasonable \ntime, place, and manner restrictions for use of Courthouse spaces.  Nothing in this Order \nprohibits the defendants from temporarily restricting access to the outdoor Courthouse \nspaces set forth in Paragraph 2 during short-term emergency situations. \n4.  In the Court’s discretion, the bond requirement under Rule 65(c) is waived. \n5.  Upon receipt, the defendants Johnson and Hagood shall immediately \nprovide Notice of this Injunction to their officers, attorneys, agents, employees, and other \npersons who are in active concert or participation with them.  \nThis the 14th day of August, 2020, at 4:45 PM. \n \n \n            ________________________________ \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 63   Filed 08/14/20   Page 3 of 3",

Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this action on July 2nd, 2020 (D.E. 1).  To this \ndate, neither Defendant Hagood or Defendant Johnson have been served.  \n2.  The filing of the lawsuit provided the first notice to these Defendants that \nOrdinance 18-175 et seq. of the City of Graham was unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs \nsubmitted a letter (D.E. 8-1) to these Defendants on June 26, 2020, which \nexpressed concern regarding Facebook posts made by Defendant Johnson, but the \nletter did not address the ordinance in question (D.E. 8). \n3.  Neither the Alamance County Sheriff’s Office (hereinafter “A.C.S.O.”) or \nAlamance County issue parade permits.  See Declarations of Bryan Hagood and \nLt. Scott Gaither attached hereto as Exhibits “A” and “B.” \n4.  Upon receipt of this lawsuit and over the 4th of July holiday weekend, undersigned \nCounsel, and Counsel for the Graham Defendants were in frequent communication \nwith Plaintiffs’ Counsel.  These communications resulted in the entry of a Consent \nTemporary Restraining Order on July 6, 2020 (D.E. 15), which states, in part, that \nthe A.C.S.O. would no longer enforce the current Graham ordinance.  Defendant \nHagood is not mentioned in the Consent Order.  \n5.  Defendant Hagood is not a proper party to this suit.  Alamance County, \nspecifically the office of the manager, has no authority over the Office of Sheriff.  \nSee Parker v. Bladen Co., 583 F.Supp.2d 736 (E.D.N.C. 2008), Peele v. Provident \nMutual Life Ins. Co., 90 N.C. App 447, 368 S.E.2d, appeal dismissed, disc. review \ndenied, 323 N.C. 366, 373 S.E.2d 547 (1988), Clark v. Burke County, 117 \nN.C.App. 85, 450 S.E.2d 747 (1994), U.S. v. Johnson, 122 F.Supp. 3d 272 \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 22   Filed 07/15/20   Page 2 of 5\n\n(M.D.N.C. 2015), and Declaration of Bryan Hagood (Exhibit “A”).  The \nComplaint appears to seek to impose liability on Hagood for not responding to an \nemail (See Compl. ¶159-160).  These Defendants respectfully submit that these \nallegations are insufficient to impose liability on Hagood.  Moreover, it appears \nthe email was sent to an invalid address. Id. \n6.  On July 11th 2020, a large demonstration was held in Graham in front of the \ncourthouse.  It is estimated that protesters, advocating removal of a confederate \nmonument by the courthouse, numbered approximately five hundred (500) and \ncounter demonstrators numbering one hundred (100), were present.  During that \nevent two (2) people were arrested by law enforcement agencies.  One for \ndisorderly conduct and failure to disperse and another for second-degree \ntrespassing.  See Declaration of Lt. Scott Gaither (Exhibit “B”).  Upon information \nand belief, these demonstrators did not have a permit from Defendant City of \nGraham as none was required.  On July 14, 2020, the Graham City Council \nrepealed the ordinance.   The Ordinance Repealing Article VI, “Parade or \nDemonstration Permit,” of the Code of Ordinances, City of Graham, North \nCarolina, is attached hereto as Exhibit “C.” \n7.   These Defendants respectfully submit that the Consent Temporary Restraining \nOrder entered by the parties now renders this matter moot.  See Anderson v. North \nCarolina Board of Elections, 248 N.C. App. 1 (2016).  These Defendants further \nsubmit that the entry of an injunction is improper as to both as they have not been \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00613-CCE-LPA   Document 22   Filed 07/15/20   Page 3 of 5\n\nserved.  Finally, an injunction as to Defendant Hagood would be improper as he \nhas no authority over the Office of Sheriff.  \nWHEREFORE, having responded to Plaintiffs’ Request for a Preliminary Injunction, \nthese Defendants respectfully pray unto the Court the following: \n    1.  That Defendant Hagood be DISMISSED from this matter and; \n    2.  That the Motion for Preliminary Injunction be DENIED as moot. \n       RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED. \nThis the 15th day of July, 2020 \n \n              /s/ William L.
