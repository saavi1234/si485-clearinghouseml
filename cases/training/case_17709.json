    "summary": "<p>On January 30, 2014, a three year-old child was killed by her mother and her motherโs boyfriend. In the week leading up to the childโs death, her grandmother had contacted both the Napa Police Department and the Napa County Child Welfare Services, informing individual defendants of the dangerous environment that the child was in living with her mother and motherโs boyfriend. </p><p>On May 29, 2015, the childโs father, on his own behalf and also as the decedentโs successor in interest, along with her grandmother and grandfather filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The parties were represented by private counsel. They brought suit against the City of Napa and Napa County, as well as against a number of individual employees of the Napa Police Department and Napa County Child Welfare Services under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and state tort law causes of action. Specifically, they alleged that the defendants, by their violation of mandatory duties to investigate and/or report child abuse and/or neglect, in part caused the death of three year-old plaintiff, violating their Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights. The plaintiffs sought damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneyโs fees. The injunctive relief sought included policies and procedures for compliance with mandatory duties for handling reports and investigations of child abuse and/or neglect, prohibition of the โcode of silenceโ among law enforcement officers, and changes to law enforcement officer training surrounding mandatory duties. The case was originally assigned to Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero but was reassigned to Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong on June 3, 2015.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 1, 2015, further developing their 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and state law claims. In response, the defendants moved to dismiss the case on September 4. On December 12, 2015, the judge issued an order granting in part and denying in part the defendantsโ motions to dismiss. The order dismissed the substantive and procedural due process claims, among others, with leave to amend, and allowed the plaintiffsโ state law claims to proceed.</p><p>In response to the order, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on January 7, 2016 in attempts to remedy the deficiencies of the earlier complaint. The defendants again moved to dismiss on April 20, 2016 and filed a motion to stay the action. Judge Armstrong denied the motion to stay on June 9, 2016, but granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss on December 7, 2016. The latter order dismissed all of plaintiffsโ federal claims, without further leave to amend. In response to the December 7 order, plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 14, 2016, appealing the dismissal of their federal claims. USCA 16-17304.</p><p>While the appeal was pending, parties began settlement negotiations in the fall of 2017, which culminated with the finalization of a settlement agreement on December 6, 2018. </p><p>The case was settled for $5,000,000, as well as non-monetary relief in the form of policy and training changes. These changes included instituting explicit cross-reporting requirements and clarifying mandatory reporting duties.</p><p>The plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their pending appeal on December 20, 2018. The case is closed. </p>",

The murder of a child by her \ncaretakers is unfathomable, and an unspeakable tragedy for her family and loved ones.  Kayleighโs death \nshocked and saddened the entire Napa Community. \nNapa police officers saw Kayleigh in her home on two separate occasions the week she died.  Kayleighโs \nmother and then-boyfriend were convicted of her murder and are serving life sentences in prison. \nKayleighโs father, Jason Slusher, and grandparents, Benny and Robin Slusher, filed civil suit against the \nCity of Napa and police officers Garrett Wade, Dominic Deguilio, Robert Chambers, and Garrett Smith, \nand the County of Napa, its CWS Supervisor Ken Adams, and CWS social workers Rocio Diaz-Lara and \nNancy Lefler-Panela.  The parties to the civil suit have agreed to settle the case for $5 million, split \nequally between the County of Napa and City of Napa, as well as non-monetary relief changes in policies \nand training.  The settlement agreement between Plaintiffs and the City is attached as Exhibit A. \nKayleigh Slusherโs death was a terrible tragedy. The City of Napa has committed to doing everything in \nits power to prevent and protect other children from suffering child abuse and neglect, including with \nthe added policies and training set forth in Exhibit A. \nThe Napa Police Department and Napa County Child Welfare Services accept and encourage members of \nthe public to report any suspicion of child abuse and neglect.  Such reports can be made anonymously \nby calling 911 or contacting the Napa County Child Welfare Services hotline at (707) 253-4261 or (800) \n464-4216.  \n \n\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE \n \n \n  This Settlement Agreement and Release (โAgreementโ) is entered between and among \nDefendants City of Napa (โCityโ), on its own behalf and on behalf of its employees, Garrett Wade, \nDominic Deguilio, Robert Chambers, Joshua Smith and Garrett Smith, hereinafter collectively \nโNamed City Defendantsโ, and   Plaintiffs Jason Slusher, individually and as the representative of \nthe Estate of Kayleigh Slusher, and Robin and Benny Slusher and the estate of Benny Slusher, \nhereinafter collectively  โNamed Plaintiffs.โ  It is made with reference to and in consideration of \nthe circumstances reflected in the following recitals. \n \n \nRECITALS \n \n  A.

On or about December 20, 2016, Jason Slusher, individually and as successor in \ninterest to Kayleigh Slusher, filed a complaint in Napa County Superior Court against the Named \nCity Defendants, excluding Joshua Smith, entitled Slusher v.

This complaint may be pled in the alternative pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \n11 \nProcedure 8(d). \n12 \nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \n13   \n  25.  Plaintiffs reallege each and every paragraph in this complaint as if fully set forth \n14 \nhere. \n15 \n  26.  On or about January 30, 2014, KAYLEIGH SLUSHER died in her home due to \n16 \n17  prolonged and severe child abuse and neglect committed by her mother's boyfriend Ryan Scott \n18 \nWarner and/or her mother, Sara Krueger, at 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7, in the City of Napa, \n19 \nCounty of Napa, California.  KAYLEIGH was three years old.  At this time, Plaintiffs are unaware \n20 \nof all details concerning the exact circumstances and manner of Kayleigh Slusher's homicide, \n21 \nbecause the Napa Police Department has not provided such information in response to Plaintiffs' \n22 \nlawful requests for such information. \n23 \n24    27.  However, the preliminary hearing in the murder cases against Mr. Warner and Ms. \n25  Krueger occurred on November 9 and 10, 2015.  Plaintiffs supplement the facts here with sworn \n26 \ntestimony from the preliminary hearing. \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  6 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 8 of 37\n \n1    28.  At all relevant times herein, Decedent KAYLEIGH SLUSHER was a minor and was \n2 \na resident of the County of Napa and the City of Napa.  On information and belief, KAYLEIGH \n3 \nSLUSHER had been a Dependency client of County of Napa CWS from approximately October \n4 \n2010 until approximately April 2012. \n5 \n  29.  Prior to Kayleigh's death, PLAINTIFF ROBIN SLUSHER and others informed \n6 \nDefendants WADE and/or DOE NPD Officers on multiple occasions that Kayleigh was suffering \n7 \n8  abuse, neglect and was in immediate physical danger in her home due to the conduct, crimes, and \n9  activities of Mr. Warner and Ms. Krueger, including but not limited to abuse of unlawful controlled \n10 \nsubstances. \n11 \n  30.  KAYLEIGH SLUSHER was born on May 3, 2010, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHERโS \n12 \nbirthday. \n13 \n  31.  KAYLEIGH SLUSHER and her mother Sara Krueger, lived with KAYLEIGHโS \n14 \ngrandparents, Plaintiffs ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER, for over a year.  In addition, when \n15 \n16  KAYLEIGH moved from ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHERโS home into an apartment with her \n17  mother, Sara Krueger, Plaintiffs ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER paid for Ms. Kruegerโs rent and \n18 \ntelephone expenses for several months so that KAYLEIGH could have a safe place to live and \n19 \ncontact with her family. \n20 \n  32.  In addition, throughout KAYLEIGHโS life, Plaintiffs ROBIN and BENNY \n21 \nSLUSHER, in addition to JASON SLUSHER, paid for Kayleighโs clothing, toys, material needs, \n22 \nmedicine, and bought food for the household in which KAYLEIGH lived, including when \n23 \n24  KAYLEIGH and Ms. Krueger lived separately from ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER. \n25 \n  33.  In addition, ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER frequently had custody of KAYLEIGH \n26 \nfor overnight and weekend visits, and frequently had her with them during the day, even when \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  7 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 9 of 37\n \n1  KAYLEIGH did not live full-time in the SLUSHERSโ house.  The parties lived near each other, in \n2 \nthe City of Napa, and ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER saw KAYLEIGH regularly. \n3 \n  34.  In or around October 2013, Ms. Krueger began denying ROBIN and BENNY \n4 \nSLUSHER their usual access to, and contacts with, their granddaughter KAYLEIGH.  During this \n5 \ntime, Plaintiff JASON SLUSHER was in prison for a crime unrelated to his relationship with \n6 \nKAYLEIGH SLUSHER, and he was not able to protect his daughter. \n7 \n8    35.  During this time, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Ms. \n9  Krueger was using illegal drugs and had moved Ryan Warner, who was also using illegal drugs and \n10 \nhad a criminal history and a warrant for his arrest, into her home, thereby endangering the life and \n11 \nsafety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER.  Despite repeated attempts by Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER to see \n12 \nher granddaughter, Ms. Krueger repeatedly refused ROBIN access to KAYLEIGH for a matter of \n13 \nmonths. \n14 \n  36.  On or about October 6, 2013, unknown DOE officers and/or a Sergeant of the Napa \n15 \n16  Police Department went to KAYLEIGH SLUSHERโS home for a disturbing the peace call.  No \n17  officer did anything to maintain KAYLEIGHโS safety or report suspected child endangerment, \n18 \nabuse or neglect to any authority.  Plaintiffs do not yet have the facts concerning this law \n19 \nenforcement visit to KAYLEIGHโS home, because the City of Napa Defendants have not yet \n20 \nproduced the police reports in this matter.  \n21 \n  37.  On or about January 8, 2014, unknown DOE officers of the Napa Police Department \n22 \nwent to KAYLEIGH SLUSHERโS home on patrol.  No officer did anything to maintain \n23 \n24  KAYLEIGHโS safety or report suspected child endangerment, abuse or neglect to any authority.  \n25 \nPlaintiffs do not yet have the facts concerning this law enforcement visit to KAYLEIGHโS home, \n26 \nbecause the City of Napa Defendants have not yet produced the police reports in this matter. \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  8 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 10 of 37\n \n1    38.  On or about January 23, 2014, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER contacted NPD to \n2 \nrequest a welfare check on KAYLEIGH.  ROBIN SLUSHER called Defendant NPD to inform the \n3 \npolice that KAYLEIGH may be suffering severe abuse, neglect, was in immediate physical danger, \n4 \nand to request police intervention to save KAYLEIGH.  MS. SLUSHER called anonymously \n5 \nbecause she did not want Ms. Krueger to learn she had called the police and preclude her from \n6 \nseeing KAYLEIGH. \n7 \n8    39.  During the January 23, 2014, call, MS. SLUSHER informed Defendant NPD that \n9  KAYLEIGH was living in a dangerous household with โRyan,โ whose last name she did not know, \n10 \nbut who had a warrant for his arrest.  MS. SLUSHER informed Defendant NPD that Mr. Warner \n11 \nand Ms. Krueger were using illegal drugs such as โcrankโ (methamphetamine) in KAYLEIGHโS \n12 \nhome, and she was worried about whether or not KAYLEIGH was being given enough food and for \n13 \nKAYLEIGHโS safety. \n14 \n  40.  On or about January 23, 2014, around 6:10 p.m., Defendant WADE was dispatched \n15 \n16  to go to KAYLEIGH SLUSHERโS home at 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7, for a warrant arrest.  On \n17  information and belief, Defendant WADE was advised that a man who lived there (Mr. Warner), \n18 \nhad an outstanding warrant for his arrest.  On information and belief, Defendant WADE was also \n19 \nadvised that a small child of three or four years old, Kayleigh, was in immediate physical danger \n20 \ndue to Mr. Warner's and Ms. Krueger's illicit drug use in the home at 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7, \n21 \ndue to Mr. Warner's and Ms. Krueger's failure to provide food to Kayleigh, due to drug users \n22 \ncoming in and out of the home at all hours, and due to possible physical violence against Kayleigh.  \n23 \n24  On information and belief, Defendant WADE was also advised that Mr. Warner stays inside the \n25 \nhome with Kayleigh all the time, smokes all the time, uses โCrank,โ and he might be armed.  \n26 \n  41.  Rather than perform a welfare check or any investigation into Kayleigh's safety and \n27 \nwellbeing, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Defendant WADE decided \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  9 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 11 of 37\n \n1  not to go to the apartment where Kayleigh lived, not to investigate further, not to report suspected \n2 \nchild abuse or neglect even to Child Welfare Services (CWS) as he was mandated to do, not to seek \n3 \nfurther advice, assistance, or backup, not to serve any warrant there, and not to arrest any fugitive \n4 \nwho may be living with Kayleigh and using drugs around her, and instead Defendant WADE \n5 \ncleared the call.  On information and belief, Defendant WADE chose not to investigate the report of \n6 \nchild abuse and/or neglect in Kayleighโs home, because he determined that the environment in \n7 \n8  which Kayleigh lived was not safe for him or his partner to go there. \n9    42.  At all relevant times, Defendant WADE was a Mandated Reporter under the \n10 \nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (\"CANRA\"), including California Penal Code \n11 \nยง11165.7.  Despite the fact that Defendant WADE knew, had reason to know and/or reasonably \n12 \nsuspected that Kayleigh was suffering child abuse and/or neglect, Defendant WADE failed to \n13 \ninvestigate and/or report the abuse and neglect as required by California Penal Code ยงยง 11164 et \n14 \nseq, 11165.9, and 11166.  Defendant WADE never made any report of child abuse and/or neglect in \n15 \n16  relation to Kayleigh to Napa County CWS or any other authority. \n17    43.  If Defendant WADE had gone to Kayleighโs home on January 23, 2014, as he was \n18 \ndispatched to do, he would have seen that Kayleigh was gaunt, malnourished, had sunken eyes that \n19 \nher neighbors had seen, and had multiple bruises and blunt force injuries about her body, including \n20 \nher face, head, neck, arms, legs, front torso, back torso, and buttocks.  In addition, by January 23, \n21 \n2014, Kayleigh had suffered a broken left posterior 10th rib, which would have been excruciatingly \n22 \npainful, causing extreme pain every time she took a breath or moved her torso.  On autopsy, that rib \n23 \n24  fracture was noted to be in a healing stage such that the fracture was at least two weeks old at the \n25 \ntime of Kayleighโs death on January 30, 2014.  If Defendant WADE had gone to Kayleighโs home \n26 \non January 23, 2014, as required, he would have seen the extreme child abuse to which she was \n27 \nsubjected, and been required, based on generally accepted law enforcement standards and training, \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  10 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 12 of 37\n \n1  to take her into protective custody, obtain medical treatment for her, and immediately report the \n2 \nsuspected child abuse to Child Welfare Services, among other things. \n3 \n  44.  On or about the morning of January 27, 2014, according to Defendant ROBERT \n4 \nCHAMBERS, Defendant officers ROBERT CHAMBERS and GARRETT SMITH of the Napa \n5 \nPolice Department were dispatched to KAYLEIGHโS home due to a neighborโs report of a \n6 \ndomestic disturbance that was becoming physical, with subjects inside KAYLEIGHโS apartment \n7 \n8  yelling and a loud commotion.  At all relevant times, these Defendants were Mandated Reporters \n9  under the California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (\"CANRA\"), including California \n10 \nPenal Code ยง11165.7.  These Defendants knew, had reason to know and/or reasonably suspected \n11 \nthat Kayleigh was suffering child abuse and/or neglect, and failed to investigate and/or report the \n12 \nabuse and neglect as required by California Penal Code ยงยง 11164 et seq, 11165.9, and 11166.  \n13 \nBased on their mandatory duties under CANRA, and generally accepted law enforcement standards \n14 \nand training, and based on facts and information they knew and/or must have known as described in \n15 \n16  succeeding paragraphs, Defendant officers CHAMBERS and SMITH were required to take \n17  Kayleigh into protective custody, obtain medical treatment for her, and immediately report the \n18 \nsuspected child abuse to Child Protective Services, among other things.  These Defendants never \n19 \nmade any report of child abuse and/or neglect in relation to Kayleigh to Napa County CWS or any \n20 \nother authority, never made any mandated investigation, never took her into protective custody, and \n21 \nnever obtained medical care for her. \n22 \n  45.  By the time of Defendants CHAMBERSโ and GARRETT SMITHโs investigation at \n23 \n24  KAYLEIGHโS home on the morning of January 27, 2014, Kayleigh was obviously suffering from \n25 \nsevere child abuse and neglect.  She was โemaciatedโ according to the autopsy report and had a \n26 \npaucity of fatty tissue due to malnutrition.  She was also dehydrated.  While Kayleighโs height of \n27 \n41โ long was in the 90th percentile for her age, her weight, 34 pounds, was in the 20th percentile.  \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  11 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 13 of 37\n \n1  Kayleigh had dark bruising around her eyes, and her eyes and cheeks were sunken in.  She had a \n2 \nhuge, 4โ bruise on the front of her forehead, and another large bruise on her left temple.  She had \n3 \nmultiple bruises from blunt force trauma to her head, neck, arms, legs, back, torso and buttocks.  \n4 \nShe had 8 to 15 individual bruises and abrasions to her abdomen.  All of this information was \n5 \nreadily apparent and/or available to Defendant officers CHAMBERS and SMITH. \n6 \n  46.  Many of the bruises were in the healing phases, and up to a week or two old. \n7 \n8    47.  Also by the time of Defendants CHAMBERSโ and SMITHโs investigation on \n9  January 27, 2014, KAYLEIGH had suffered the blunt force trauma blow to her abdomen that would \n10 \nlead to her death.  Although she had multiple blunt force injuries to her abdomen, one was with so \n11 \nmuch force it caused hemorrhage to the front of her lumbar spine and another was so forceful that it \n12 \ntore a hole in her small intestine, causing stool to leak into the sterile area of her abdomen, the \n13 \nperitoneum, and become infected.   \n14 \n  48.  Immediately upon suffering the abdominal trauma, Kayleigh would have been \n15 \n16  โclearly and demonstrably illโ according to child abuse pediatrician James Crawford-Jakubiak, \n17  M.D., who is the director of the child abuse pediatrics center at Oakland Childrenโs Hospital and \n18 \ntestified in the preliminary hearing. \n19 \n  49.  Both Joseph I. Cohen, M.D. -- the pathologist who performed the autopsy on \n20 \nKAYLEIGH -- and Dr. Crawford-Jakubiak confirmed that the small intestine injury to KAYLEIGH \n21 \nwould have been immediately extremely painful. \n22 \n  50.  Then when the infectious peritonitis developed, KAYLEIGH would have been in \n23 \n24  even more, โagonizingโ and โexcruciatingโ pain. \n25 \n  51.  As the infection wore on, it caused extremely painful necrosis โ death โ of twelve \n26 \ninches of KAYLEIGHโS small intestine, and KAYLEIGH would have been โin agony.โ \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  12 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 14 of 37\n \n1    52.  Both physicians confirmed that the small intestine injury and infection were \n2 \nsurvivable, if KAYLEIGH had received medical attention. \n3 \n  53.  The fatal abdominal injury was present for four or more days before KAYLEIGH \n4 \ndied, and she would have survived if she had received medical attention. \n5 \n  54.  Defendant Officers CHAMBERS and GARRETT SMITH saw KAYLEIGH in this \n6 \ngrave and life-threatening medical condition with obvious signs of abuse and did not question her, \n7 \n8  examine her, conduct any child abuse investigation, report the suspected abuse to anyone, take \n9  KAYLEIGH into protective custody, or obtain necessary medical care for her, despite their \n10 \nmandatory duties under law and applicable standards to do all of those.  No reasonable officer \n11 \nwould have failed to examine and question KAYLEIGH, conduct a thorough child abuse \n12 \ninvestigation, immediately report the suspected abuse to CWS and other officials, take KAYLEIGH \n13 \ninto protective custody, or obtain emergency medical care for her. \n14 \n  55.  During this time, even neighbors had noticed KAYLEIGH, who was normally a \n15 \n16  happy and playful child who often played outside, had now become withdrawn, sullen, and had \n17  developed dark circles under her eyes, and was rarely allowed outside. \n18 \n  56.  Also on or about January 27, 2014, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER contacted Napa \n19 \nCounty CWS by phone and reported to Defendant CWS Workers DIAZ-LARA and LEFLER-\n20 \nPANELA that there had been a CWS dependency case open for KAYLEIGH in the past, and that \n21 \nMs. Krueger and her boyfriend were using drugs, which Ms. Slusher believed to be crank or crack, \n22 \nin the home.  ROBIN SLUSHER further informed Defendants DIAZ-LARA and LEFLER-\n23 \n24  PANELA that the drugs were accessible to KAYLEIGH, that Ms. Krueger and her boyfriend were \n25 \nintentionally depriving KAYLEIGH of food, that KAYLEIGH had lost weight, there was a lot of \n26 \ntraffic in and out of the home, and there was a warrant for the arrest of Ms. Kruegerโs boyfriend. \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  13 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 15 of 37\n \n1    57.  Shortly thereafter, Defendant LEFLER-PANELA called ROBIN SLUSHER back \n2 \nand said there was nothing CWS could do, and told Ms. Slusher she could call the police instead. \n3 \n  58.  At all relevant times, Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and DIAZ-LARA were \n4 \nmandated reporters, including under California Penal Code ยง 11165.7. \n5 \n  59.  Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and DIAZ-LARA had the mandatory duties to \n6 \nrespond, investigate and/or report the abuse and/or severe neglect under California law, including \n7 \n8  California Penal Code ยงยง 11165.9 and 11166, California Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 328, \n9  10553, 10554, 16501, 16504, and California Department of Social Services Child Welfare Services \n10 \nRegulations ยงยง 31-100, 31-101, 31-105, 31-110, 31-115, 31-120, 31-125, 31-130, and 31-501.  \n11 \nThese mandatory duties include, but are not limited to: \n12 \na)  The duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect to the police or sheriff's \n13  department (P.C. ยงยง 11165.9 and 11166(j); DSS Regulations Ch. 31-501); \n \n14 \nb)  The duty to immediately refer the case by telephone, fax, or electronic \ntransmission to an agency with proper jurisdiction, if the agency that takes a \n15 \nreport lacks jurisdiction (P.C. ยง11165.9); \n16   \nc)  The duty to make \"an initial report by telephone to the police or sheriff's \n17  department as soon as is practicably possible,\" and to \"prepare and send, fax, or \nelectronically transmit a written follow-up report within 36 hours of receiving \n18 \nthe information\" concerning the abuse and/or neglect (P.C. ยง11166(a)); \n \n19 \nd)  The duty to \"immediately make any investigation he or she deems necessary to \n20  determine whether child welfare services should be offered to the family and \nwhether proceedings in the juvenile court should be commenced\" (W&I ยง328); \n21   \ne)  The duty to \"respond to any report of imminent danger to a child immediately\" \n22 \n(W&I ยง16501(f)); \n \n23 \nf)  The duty to make \"an immediate in-person response\" in โemergency situations\" \n24  (W&I ยง16504(a)); \n \n25 \ng)  The duty to \"respond to all referrals for service which allege that a child is \nendangered by abuse, neglect, or exploitation\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-101.1); \n26 \n \nh)  The duty to \"immediately initiate and complete the Emergency Response \n27 \nProtocol process\" and to \"record all available and appropriate information on \n28  the Emergency Response Protocol Form\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-105); \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  14 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 16 of 37\n \n1   \ni)  The duty to conduct an in-person immediate investigation when the \"emergency \n2 \nresponse protocol indicates the existence of a situation in which imminent \ndanger to a child, such as physical pain, injury, disability, severe emotional \n3 \nharm or death, is likely\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-115); \n \n4 \nj)  The duty to request law enforcement assistance where \"the physical safety of \n5  family members. . .is endangered\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-130); \n \n6 \nk)    Other duties as provided by law and regulations. \n \n7 \n  60.  Despite the fact that Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA knew, had \n8 \nreason to know and/or reasonably suspected that Kayleigh was suffering child abuse, severe neglect, \n9 \nand an emergency situation, with deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of KAYLEIGH \n10 \nSLUSHER, they violated their mandatory duties to respond, investigate and/or report the abuse \n11 \n12  and/or neglect as required by law, including but not limited to California Penal Code ยงยง 11165.9 \n13  and 11166, California Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 328, 10553, 10554, 16501, 16504, and \n14 \nCalifornia Department of Social Services Child Welfare Services Regulations ยงยง 31-100, 31-101, \n15 \n31-105, 31-110, 31-115, 31-120, 31-125, 31-130, and 31-501. \n16 \n  61.  Further, Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA, with deliberate \n17 \nindifference to the rights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, failed to accept reports of \n18 \nsuspected child abuse and/or severe neglect without legal justification and did not properly maintain \n19 \n20  a record of all reports received as mandated by Penal Code ยง 11165.9. \n21    62.  Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA, with deliberate indifference to \n22 \nthe rights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, wrongfully delivered child protective services by \n23 \nfailing to conduct an assessment and develop a case plan as mandated by DSS Regulations ยงยง 31-\n24 \n201, 31-205, 31-206 and/or Welfare and Institutions Code ยง16501.1. \n25 \n  63.  Even though Defendants LEFLER-PANELA, DIAZ-LARA and/or DOE CWS \n26 \nWorkers received reports of abuse and/or severe neglect, with deliberate indifference to the rights \n27 \n28  and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, they violated their mandatory duties by choosing not \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  15 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 17 of 37\n \n1  conduct a basic evaluation of risks to determine whether an emergency situation existed as \n2 \nmandated by Welfare and Institutions Code ยง ยง 16504 and/or DSS Regulations ยง ยง 31-101, 31-105, \n3 \n31-110, 31-115, 31-120 and/or 31-128. \n4 \n  64.  Even though Defendants LEFLER-PANELA, DIAZ-LARA and/or DOE CWS \n5 \nWorkers received reports of abuse and/or severe neglect, with deliberate indifference to the rights \n6 \nand safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, they violated their mandatory duties by choosing not to \n7 \n8  control the conduct of Ryan Warner and/or Sara Krueger, and/or otherwise protect Kayleigh as \n9  mandated by Welfare and Institutions Code ยง ยง 16501 and 16504. \n10 \n  65.  With deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, \n11 \nDefendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA violated their duties as mandated reporters to \n12 \nreport suspected child abuse and/or severe neglect to appropriate authorities and to make initial \n13 \nreports or follow up reports within 36 hours of receiving said reports of abuse and/or severe neglect \n14 \nas mandated by Penal Code ยง ยง 11165.9 and 11166(a).  Rather, Defendants told Plaintiff ROBIN \n15 \n16  SLUSHER she could call the police instead. \n17    66.  On or about January 29, 2014, around 5:58 p.m., Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER again \n18 \ncontacted the Napa Police Department to inform them that her granddaughter was in grave danger, \n19 \nand to request police assistance.  The NPD again dispatched Defendant WADE, this time to do a \n20 \nwelfare check, for Kayleighโs benefit, at Kayleighโs home, located at 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7.  \n21 \nDefendant WADE spoke with Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER on the telephone, who told Defendant \n22 \nWADE that Kayleigh was in immediate physical danger due to Mr. Warner's and Ms. Krueger's \n23 \n24  illegal drug use in the home, their failure to provide food and care to Kayleigh, and possible \n25 \nphysical violence against Kayleigh.  Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER told Defendant WADE that she \n26 \nhad not been allowed to talk with her granddaughter, Kayleigh, since approximately Thanksgiving; \n27 \nthat she believed Kayleighโs mother, Ms. Krueger, was using drugs and allowing others to use drugs \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  16 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 18 of 37\n \n1  in Kayleighโs home, possibly crack cocaine or โcrankโ (methamphetamine); that Kayleigh was not \n2 \nbeing fed; and that when she has attempted to check on or see her granddaughter, Ms. Krueger has \n3 \nrefused and told her that Kayleigh has been sick since Thanksgiving.  \n4 \n  67.  On information and belief, Defendant WADE requested Defendant NPD Officer \n5 \nDEGUILIO to act as his cover officer, and the two Defendant officers visited Kayleigh's residence \n6 \non or about January 29, 2014, around 8:47 p.m.  On information and belief, the following facts in \n7 \n8  this paragraph occurred at that time.  Ms. Krueger refused Defendants permission to enter the home \n9  to perform a welfare check on Kayleigh, and Defendants were aware that Ms. Krueger actively tried \n10 \nto conceal the inside of her home from the officers by closing the front door against her body and \n11 \npeeking her head out to talk to them.  During that visit, Ms. Krueger brought Kayleigh to the front \n12 \ndoor and Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO observed the large and multiple bruises on Kayleigh's \n13 \nface described above.  Defendants could not see the rest of Kayleighโs body, including her arms and \n14 \nlegs, which were covered by her clothes.  Defendants did nothing to investigate whether Kayleigh \n15 \n16  had injuries that were covered by her clothes.  Defendants were able to observe a man walk out of a \n17  back bedroom and look very surprised to see the officers there.  Defendants saw that that man \n18 \nappeared to be very malnourished, with sunken cheekbones, and appeared to be a drug user.  That \n19 \nman told Defendants his name was โRyan Howard,โ and that he did not have, and he could not find, \n20 \nany identification.  Defendants ran a records check on โRyan Howard,โ and dispatch was unable to \n21 \nlocate any match.  Defendants later learned that the man who claimed to be โRyan Howardโ was \n22 \nactually โRyan Warner.โ  When Defendants first encountered Ryan โHowardโ (Warner) at \n23 \n24  Kayleighโs home, Defendants determined that he was under the influence of a controlled substance, \n25 \nbased on their training and experience due to his appearance and obvious symptoms of drug \n26 \nintoxication.  Ryan Warner admitted to Defendants that he had used marijuana and Ms. Kruegerโs \n27 \nprescription pain medication that day, without a prescription for it.  Defendants entered the \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  17 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 19 of 37\n \n1  residence.  Defendants did not search the residence, nor did Defendants observe every room, or \n2 \nwhether or not there were weapons or illegal drugs, or whether there was sufficient food for \n3 \nKayleigh.  While Defendants were there, another man walked out of a back bedroom, whom \n4 \nDefendants recognized from past contacts as Allen Epperson, a well-known methamphetamine \n5 \naddict who was currently on probation.  Mr. Epperson attempted to quickly leave the residence, and \n6 \nDefendants detained him for a probation search.  While Kayleigh was sitting on Ms. Kruegerโs lap \n7 \n8  on a couch, Defendants saw Kayleigh vomit, which was caused by the infectious peritonitis and \n9  necrotic small intestine that was killing her.  Ms. Krueger stated that Kayleigh had the flu, and \n10 \nimmediately took Kayleigh into the bathroom, away from the officers.  Defendants WADE and \n11 \nDEGUILIO also observed that Kayleigh appeared gaunt, sick, malnourished, and distressed, with \n12 \nthe dark circles under her eyes that her neighbors had recently noticed.  Defendants did not attempt \n13 \nto speak with Kayleigh.  Ms. Krueger asked Defendants to leave, and Defendants left.  Defendant \n14 \nWADE later determined that the man claiming to be โRyan Howardโ had lied to them about his \n15 \n16  identity, and that he was actually Ryan Warner.  On information and belief, Defendants WADE and \n17  DEGUILIO also confirmed that there was an active arrest warrant for Ryan Warner and/or legal \n18 \ncause for his immediate arrest.  Defendants made no effort to obtain a warrant to re-enter \n19 \nKayleighโs home, search Kayleighโs home, or arrest anyone in Kayleighโs home.  One of the \n20 \nDefendants briefly escorted Ryan Warner away from the apartment, but he was allowed to return \n21 \nafter Defendants left.  Defendant WADE then called Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER, and told her that \n22 \neverything appeared normal at Kayleighโs home, and that Kayleigh had food.  Defendant WADE \n23 \n24  also promised and reassured Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER that he would \"keep an eye on the \n25 \napartment.\" \n26 \n  68.  At the time of their investigation on January 29, 2014, Defendants WADE and \n27 \nDEGUILIO saw that KAYLEIGH had the above-described severe and multiple bruises, including a \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  18 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 20 of 37\n \n1  4โ bruise on her forehead and another bruise on her left temple.  She would have appeared to them \n2 \nas an โextremely sickโ child, โin agonyโ from the infectious peritonitis and necrotic bowel. \n3 \n  69.  Even Allen Epperson, the known methamphetamine addict who was at \n4 \nKAYLEIGHโS home at the same time as Defendant Officers WADE and DEGUILIO on January \n5 \n29, 2014, noted and later informed police that KAYLEIGH was sallow, hollow and sick looking \n6 \nwith bruises on her face at that time. \n7 \n8    70.  According to generally accepted police practices and training, police officers are \n9  trained they must interview and examine a child who is a possible abuse victim outside the presence \n10 \nof her caregivers because children are often afraid to speak of abuse in the presence of their \n11 \ncaregivers, and officers must inspect the childโs body for evidence of abuse.  If Defendants had \n12 \nfollowed generally accepted police practices and training, they would have interviewed and \n13 \nexamined KAYLEIGH outside the presence of her mother and Ryan Warner, and would have been \n14 \nrequired immediately to take her into protective custody and obtain immediate medical treatment \n15 \n16  for her, which would have saved her life.   \n17    71.  Defendant Officers WADE and DEGUILIO saw KAYLEIGH in this grave and life-\n18 \nthreatening medical condition with obvious signs of abuse and did not question her, examine her, \n19 \nconduct any child abuse investigation, report the suspected abuse to anyone, take KAYLEIGH into \n20 \nprotective custody, or obtain necessary medical care for her, despite their mandatory duties under \n21 \nlaw and applicable standards to do all of those things.  No reasonable officer would have failed to \n22 \nexamine and question KAYLEIGH, conduct a thorough child abuse investigation, immediately \n23 \n24  report the suspected abuse to CWS and other officials, take KAYLEIGH into protective custody, or \n25 \nobtain emergency medical care for her. \n26 \n  72.  If Defendants had followed generally accepted police practices and training, \n27 \nDefendants would have discovered Ryan Warner had an extensive criminal history including but \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  19 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 21 of 37\n \n1  not limited to, upon information and belief, assault and possession of drugs, and he had a restraining \n2 \norder entered against him for threatening to kill his pregnant ex-girlfriend, including telling her for \n3 \nexample, โI hope the kid dies or is born retarded,โ โsnitches get dealt with,โ โYouโll get whatโs \n4 \ncoming to you,โ โI hope you and it die in the process,โ โIโve been on the run many times,โ โI will \n5 \nscalp you,โ โIโll bust your teeth out with a pipe like mine were,โ and the woman was โnot worthy of \n6 \nhavingโ his child. \n7 \n8    73.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Defendant WADE \n9  violated his promise to ROBIN SLUSHER, and never went back to the apartment before Kayleigh \n10 \ndied.  On information and belief, Defendant WADE also did not ask any other member of the NPD \n11 \nto monitor the apartment or report the incident to any other officer, CWS or any other party. \n12 \n  74.  At all relevant times, Defendants WADE, DEGUILIO, CHAMBERS and SMITH \n13 \nwere Mandated Reporters under the California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act \n14 \n(\"CANRA\").  On information and belief, Defendants WADE, DEGUILIO, CHAMBERS and \n15 \n16  SMITH violated their mandatory duties to investigate and/or report the abuse and neglect as \n17  required by California Penal Code ยง ยง 11164 et seq, 11165.9, and 11166, despite knowing, having \n18 \nreason to know and/or reasonably suspecting that Kayleigh was suffering severe and sustained child \n19 \nabuse and neglect.  Neither Defendants WADE, DEGUILIO, CHAMBERS nor or SMITH ever \n20 \nmade any report of suspected child abuse and/or neglect in relation to Kayleigh to Napa County \n21 \nCWS or any other agency or authority. \n22 \n  75.  No Defendant officer ever conducted the child abuse investigation required of them \n23 \n24  by generally accepted police training, practices, and procedures, including interviewing and \n25 \nexamining KAYLEIGH outside the presence of her mother.  No Defendant officer ever took \n26 \nKAYLEIGH into protective custody or procured emergency medical treatment for her, as required \n27 \nby generally accepted police training, practices, and procedures and their mandatory duties.  No \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  20 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 22 of 37\n \n1  Defendant officer made an immediate report of suspected child abuse to CWS as required by their \n2 \nmandatory duties. \n3 \n  76.  Plaintiffs relied on the representations of Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO that \n4 \neverything appeared normal with Kayleigh and at Kayleighโs home, that there was food for \n5 \nKayleigh in the home, and that they would โkeep an eye on the apartment.โ  Those representations \n6 \nwere false.  Had Plaintiffs known the truth about what transpired during Defendantsโ welfare check \n7 \n8  on Kayleigh, Plaintiffs would have taken immediate action to protect Kayleigh, including making \n9  further efforts to seek protection for Kayleigh from the NPD and the Napa County CWS, contacting \n10 \nother authorities or child advocates for assistance, personally going to Kayleighโs home, or \n11 \nengaging in other self-help to try to protect Kayleigh.  Instead, Plaintiffs relied to their (and \n12 \nKayleighโs) detriment on Defendantsโ false representations that everything appeared normal at \n13 \nKayleighโs home, and that the NPD would monitor the apartment to protect Kayleigh.   \n14 \n  77.  The Defendant Officersโ failure to take KAYLEIGH into protective custody and take \n15 \n16  her to a hospital caused KAYLEIGH to die of the untreated abdominal trauma, infectious peritonitis \n17  and small intestine necrosis. \n18 \n  78.  The California Legislature has determined that the purpose of the child protection \n19 \nlaw โis to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically, \n20 \nsexually, or emotionally abused, being neglected, or being exploited, and to ensure the safety, \n21 \nprotection, and physical and emotional well-being of children who are at risk of that harm.โ  Cal. \n22 \nWelf. & Inst. Code ยง 300.2. \n23 \n24    79.  In addition, the California Legislature has determined that โThe provision of a home \n25 \nenvironment free from the negative effects of substance abuse is a necessary condition for the \n26 \nsafety, protection and physical and emotional well-being of the child.โ  Id. \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  21 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 23 of 37\n \n1    80.  All Defendants were trained that people who are using methamphetamine or other \n2 \ncontrolled substances can be violent, volatile, and are unsafe for children to be around.  All \n3 \nDefendants were trained that caregivers who are using methamphetamine or other controlled \n4 \nsubstances may fail to give their children necessary food, liquids, and basic necessities. \n5 \n  81.  Through their volitional, intentional, and deliberately indifferent acts, omissions, and \n6 \nmisrepresentations, Defendants WADE, DEGUILIO, CHAMBERS AND SMITH affirmatively \n7 \n8  placed Kayleigh Slusher in danger, exposing her to a danger which she would not have otherwise \n9  faced, and leaving her in a situation that was more dangerous than the one in which they found her.  \n10 \nThese Defendants did so by going to KAYLEIGHโs home, thereby tipping off Ryan Warner and \n11 \nSara Krueger that police were monitoring them and interested in them, while at the same time \n12 \nviolating their mandatory duties as described above, and causing Ryan Warner and Sara Krueger to \n13 \nconceal KAYLEIGH within their apartment and to not seek medical care for KAYLEIGH โ \n14 \nincluding taking KAYLEIGH to a hospital โ for fear that police would arrest them, or would \n15 \n16  remove KAYLEIGH from them, if they (Ryan and Sara) did anything so conspicuous.  \n17    82.  Leaving KAYLEIGH in a highly abusive home, and denying her the necessary life-\n18 \nsaving medical care and protective custody she needed, was extremely coercive. \n19 \n  83.  If Defendants had complied with their mandatory duties, the mandatory outcomes \n20 \nincluded immediately and thoroughly conducting an emergency investigation of child abuse, \n21 \nimmediately reporting the abuse to CWS, the police, sheriff and other law enforcement, examining \n22 \nand questioning KAYLEIGH outside the presence of her caregivers, immediately taking \n23 \n24  KAYLEIGH into protective custody, and immediately taking KAYLEIGH to the emergency room \n25 \nfor the life-saving emergency medical treatment KAYLEIGH needed. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  22 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 24 of 37\n \n1    84.  Both Doctors Cohen and Crawford-Jakubiak confirmed that KAYLEIGH was likely \n2 \nto survive the abdominal injuries, infection, and necrotic bowel if she had received medical \n3 \nattention, including surgical repair of the small intestine and antibiotic treatment for the infection. \n4 \n  85.  On or about February 1, 2014, NPD Officers responded to a call to do another \n5 \nwelfare check at Kayleigh's home.  When NPD Officers arrived there, they discovered Kayleigh \n6 \nSlusher in her bed, deceased, with the extensive evidence of ongoing and severe child abuse \n7 \n8  described above.  Although KAYLEIGHโS body was covered up to her neck with blankets, \n9  KAYLEIGH had โobvious facial injuries,โ and โobvious facial trauma consisting of large \n10 \ncontusions on her fore head, face, and neckโ that were in โvarious stages of healing.โ  Her eyes \n11 \nwere sunken in, โwith dark bruising around her eyes.โ  Defendants  CHAMBERS, SMITH, WADE, \n12 \nand DEGUILIO would have observed these severe injuries on KAYLEIGH when they saw her \n13 \nshortly before her death, and were required to conduct a child abuse investigation and take her into \n14 \nprotective custody and obtain life-saving medical care for her. \n15 \n16    86.  On February 1, 2014, KAYLEIGHโs home was in a shambles, with dirty dishes piled \n17  in the sick and a mess all over the floors.  The refrigerator was empty except for condiments and a \n18 \nbottle of Pedialyte. \n19 \n  87.  The Napa County District Attorney reported that KAYLEIGH died due to multiple \n20 \nblunt force trauma with impact injuries to her head, torso and extremities, child abuse and neglect, \n21 \nand on or about April 8, 2015, added torture to the criminal allegations against Mr. Warner and Ms. \n22 \nKrueger.  The Napa County Coronerโs pathologist, Dr. Cohen, determined KAYLEIGHโS cause of \n23 \n24  death to be complications of mesenteric contusions and small intestine hematoma, due to multiple \n25 \nblunt impact injuries to head, torso, and extremities, due to fatal child abuse and neglect.  He \n26 \ndetermined that KAYLEIGH suffered from โfatal child abuse and neglect over time leading to \n27 \ndeath.โ  (Emphasis added). \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  23 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 25 of 37\n \n1    88.  On exterior examination (just looking at the skin), much of KAYLEIGHโs abdomen \n2 \nwas green from the infection.  When Dr. Cohen cut into KAYLEIGHโS abdomen, 450 milliliters โ \n3 \nabout two cups โ of free-flowing, bloody and infectious fluid drained out of her abdomen.  It took \n4 \nseveral days for this bloody fluid to build up. \n5 \n  89.  Defendants' failure to investigate and/or report the abuse and/or neglect and failure to \n6 \ntake KAYLEIGH into protective custody and obtain emergency medical treatment for her was \n7 \n8  without legal justification, caused great pain and suffering to Plaintiffs, and caused Kayleigh \n9  Slusherโs death.  These injuries, including but not limited to physical abuse, torture, neglect and \n10 \ndeath, were of the type the California Legislature intended to prevent in enacting the Child Abuse \n11 \nand Neglect Reporting Act, Penal Code ยง 11164 et seq., and Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 300, \n12 \n305 et seq., 10550, 10553, 10554, and 10651.  Additionally, Defendants' affirmative acts and \n13 \nomissions, including failure to investigate, report, intervene and/or protect Kayleigh Slusher from \n14 \nknown and foreseeable harms, including physical and sexual abuse, torture and death, created \n15 \n16  danger and increased the risk of harm to Kayleigh.  Defendants further created danger and increased \n17  the risk of harm to Kayleigh, through their affirmative acts and omissions, by going to Kayleighโs \n18 \nhome without taking any action, and by lying to Robin Slusher about Kayleighโs condition and \n19 \ncreating a false sense of security and safety as to Plaintiffs and others who wished to protect \n20 \nKayleigh from harm.   In addition, Defendants increased the risk of harm to KAYLEIGH by going \n21 \nto her apartment and doing nothing, which informed Ms. Krueger and Mr. Warner that the police \n22 \nwere informed of Kayleighโs condition and caused their further avoidance of necessary medical care \n23 \n24  for KAYLEIGH. \n25 \n  90.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff KAYLEIGH SLUSHER had a due \n26 \nprocess right to life and a liberty interest in bodily integrity and security, including a protected \n27 \nliberty interest and right to the non-discretionary investigation, reporting, and protection mandated \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  24 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 26 of 37\n \n1  for her benefit by California law.  Plaintiffs JASON SLUSHER, ROBIN SLUSHER and BENNY \n2 \nSLUSHER had the right to familial relationships with Kayleigh.  Among other sources, these rights \n3 \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments derive from statutory mandates as created by California \n4 \nlaw.  Investigation and/or reporting of child abuse and/or neglect is mandatory under the California \n5 \nChild Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Penal Code ยง 11164 et seq., Welfare and Institutions Code \n6 \nยงยง 10550, 10553, 10554, and 10651, and is intended by law for the benefit and protection of \n7 \n8  children such as Kayleigh Slusher.  Such investigation and/or reporting is mandatory, ministerial, \n9  and is not discretionary under the CANRA.  Defendants unreasonably and unjustifiably violated \n10 \ntheir mandatory duties to investigate and/or report the abuse and/or neglect suffered by Kayleigh \n11 \nSlusher, despite Plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional entitlement to investigation and/or reporting \n12 \nunder California law.  Defendants violated Plaintiffs' rights under the First and Fourteenth \n13 \nAmendments by failing to respond to, investigate and/or report child abuse and neglect as mandated \n14 \nby the CANRA, and to remove KAYLEIGH from her obviously abusive and dangerous home and \n15 \n16  seek emergency medical care for her, as required by generally accepted law enforcement standards \n17  and training.  As a direct result of Defendants' conduct, including conduct that increased the risk of \n18 \nharm to Kayleigh Slusher, and Defendantsโ failure to investigate and/or report child abuse and/or \n19 \nneglect as required by the United States Constitution and California law, Plaintiff Kayleigh Slusher \n20 \nsuffered loss of life and liberty, and Plaintiffs JASON SLUSHER, ROBIN SLUSHER and BENNY \n21 \nSLUSHER suffered loss of their familial relationships with their daughter/granddaughter, including \n22 \nloss of love, companionship, comfort, affection, society, services, solace, and moral support.     \n23 \n24    91.  At all material times, and alternatively, the actions and omissions of each Defendant \n25 \nwere intentional, wanton and/or willful, conscience shocking, reckless, malicious, deliberately \n26 \nindifferent to Plaintiffsโ rights, done with actual malice, grossly negligent, negligent, and \n27 \nobjectively unreasonable. \n28 \n \n15-cv-02394 SBA:  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND  25 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 52   Filed 01/07/16   Page 27 of 37\n \n1    92.

Further, Defendantsโ violation of mandatory duties, \n7 \n8  standards, and of Plaintiffsโ rights, were so obvious and shocking, and the facts of this case have \n9  received such widespread media and public attention, that supervisors and policy-makers for the \n10 \nCITY and COUNTY, respectively, must have known of these egregious violations of law, \n11 \nstandards, and training, and on information and belief have decided to ratify and endorse the \n12 \nconduct of the Defendants in this matter who are under their supervision and control.

The federal claims are dismissed \n6  without further leave to amend.  The Court declines to assert supplemental jurisdiction over \n7  Plaintiffsโ remaining state law claims, which are dismissed without prejudice to refiling in \n8  state court.2 \n9  I.  BACKGROUND \n10  A.  FACTUAL SUMMARY \n11  The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, which are summarized herein to \n12  the extent they are pertinent to the instant motions.  The decedent child, Kayleigh Slusher \n13  (โKayleighโ), is the biological daughter of Jason Slusher (โJasonโ) and Sara Krueger \n14  (โKruegerโ).  During the relevant time period, Jason was incarcerated on a matter unrelated \n15  to this action.  As a result, Kayleigh and her mother initially lived with Kayleighโs paternal \n16  grandparents, Robin Slusher (โRobinโ) and Benny Slusher (โBennyโ).  Krueger eventually \n17  moved to an apartment and took Kayleigh with her.  After Kayleigh moved out, Robin and \n18  Benny became increasingly concerned for her welfare.  Their fears were heightened by the \n19  fact that Krueger and her boyfriend, Ryan Warner (โWarnerโ), were using illegal drugs.  In \n20  addition, Warner was a methamphetamine addict with an outstanding arrest warrant and \n21  extensive criminal history and who associated with similarly unsavory individuals.   \n22  Robin and Benny repeatedly called the Napa Police Department (โNPDโ) and Napa \n23  County Child Welfare Services (โCWSโ) to check on Kayleighโs welfare.  CWS social \n24 \n                                                 \n25  1 The County Defendants consist of the County of Napa and two county social \nworkers.  The City Defendants consist of the City of Napa and four of its police officers.  \n26  The identity of the individual defendants is discussed in the Factual Summary section of \nthis Order. \n27 \n2 The Court, in its discretion, finds this matter suitable for resolution without oral \n28  argument.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); N.D. Cal. Civ. L.R. 7-1(b). \n- 2 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 3 of 16\n \n1  workers Nancy Lefler-Panela (โLefler-Panelaโ) and Rocio Diaz-Lara (โDiaz-Laraโ) told \n2  Robin there was nothing CWS could do and directed her to contact the police.  Robin made \n3  a number of detailed reports to the NPD that Kayleigh was living in an unsafe household \n4  and asked that officers investigate the situation.  NPD did not inform CWS of those reports \n5  and did little to investigate Robinโs complaints.  Finally, on January 29, 2014, NPD \n6  Officers Garrett Wade and Deguilio visited the Krueger household to conduct a welfare \n7  check on Kayleigh.  The officers observed that Kayleigh had bruises on her face, and \n8  appeared gaunt, sick, malnourished and distressed.  The officers also observed Warner, who \n9  looked sickly and appeared to be under the influence of drugs.  Once inside the apartment, \n10  Kayleigh vomited in front of them, and was quickly taken to the bathroom by Krueger.  \n11  They also saw a male whom they knew was on probation attempt to depart from the \n12  premises.  Krueger asked the officers to leave.  The officers complied, but inexplicably \n13  without making any effort to speak with Kayleigh or physically examine her.   \n14  On or about February 1, 2014, unspecified NPD police officers returned to the \n15  Krueger residence for another welfare check.  The officers discovered Kayleigh in her bed, \n16  deceased.  Her body had obvious facial injuries and trauma consisting of large contusions \n17  on her forehead, face and neck that were in various stages of healing.  Her eyes \n18  were sunken in with dark bruising around her eyes.  The Napa County District Attorney \n19  later reported that Kayleigh died due to multiple blunt force trauma with impact injuries to \n20  her head, torso and extremities, child abuse and neglect.  Krueger and Warner were charged \n21  in the Napa County Superior Court with torture and murder.  See People v. Sara Krueger, \n22  CR169462; People v. Ryan Warner, CR 169461.  Trial is anticipated to commence in \n23  February 2017.3 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  3 The County Defendants previously moved to stay the instant action pending the \nconclusion of the state criminal proceedings.  The Court denied that motion on June 9, \n28  2016.  Dkt. 99. \n- 3 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 4 of 16\n \n1  B.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n2  On May 29, 2015, Jason, individually and as the successor in interest to Kayleigh, \n3  and grandparents Robin and Benny, in their individual capacities, filed the instant action \n4  against:  the City of Napa; County of Napa; the NPD; NPD Chief Richard Melton; NPD \n5  Officer Wade; NPD Officer Deguilo; CWS worker Diaz-Lara; and CWS worker Lefler-\n6  Panela.    \n7  On July 1, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (โFACโ) which asserted \n8  the following claims:  (1) violation of due process and interference with familial relations, \n9  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; (2) municipal liability pursuant to Monell v. Depโt of Soc. \n10  Serv. of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658 (1978); (3) violation of the Bane Act; and \n11  (4) negligence/negligence per se.   \n12  The County Defendants and City Defendants separately filed motions to dismiss all \n13  claims alleged in the FAC, which the Court granted in part and denied in part.  Dkt. 45.  \n14  The Court dismissed Plaintiffsโ first claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violation of due \n15  process and interference with familial association; second claim under Monell; and third \n16  claim for violation of the Bane Act.4  The Court denied the motion as to Plaintiffsโ claim \n17  for negligence/negligence per se.  Dkt. 45.  Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend their \n18  dismissed claims. \n19  Plaintiffs timely filed their Second Amended Complaint (โSACโ).  Dkt. 52.  The \n20  SAC re-alleges the four claims from the FAC, as amended to address the deficiencies \n21  identified by the Court in its earlier order.  In terms of party-defendants, the SAC omits \n22  Chief Melton, and adds NPD Officers Robert Chambers, Garrett Smith and Joshua Smith.  \n23  Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Defendants now move to dismiss all claims alleged therein.  The \n24  motions are fully briefed and are ripe for adjudication. \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n27  4 Plaintiffsโ familial association claim was premised on both the Fourteenth and First \nAmendment.  Because the parties did not adequately address the merits of the First \n28  Amendment claim, the Court declined to dismiss said claim. \n- 4 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 5 of 16\n \n1  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n2  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) โtests the legal sufficiency of a claim.โ  \n3  Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).  โDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \n4  proper when the complaint either (1) lacks a cognizable legal theory or (2) fails to allege \n5  sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.โ  Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, \n6  959 (9th Cir. 2013).  โRule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires \n7  not only โfair notice of the nature of the claim, but also grounds on which the claim rests.โโ  \n8  Zixiang Li v. Kerry, 710 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting in part Bell Atl. Corp. \n9  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 n.3 (2007)).  โTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \n10  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is \n11  plausible on its face.โโ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 \n12  U.S. at 570 (2007)).   \n13  In assessing the sufficiency of the pleadings, โcourts must consider the complaint in \n14  its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \n15  motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, \n16  and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.โ  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & \n17  Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).  The court is to โaccept all factual allegations in the \n18  complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \n19  party.โ  Outdoor Media Group, Inc. v. City of Beaumont, 506 F.3d 895, 899-900 (9th Cir. \n20  2007).  Where a complaint or claim is dismissed, leave to amend generally is granted, \n21  unless further amendment would be futile.  Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.,  \n22  656 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir. 2011). \n23  III.  DISCUSSION \n24  A.  CLAIMS UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n25  Count One of the SAC, which is predicated on 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleges claims for \n26  violation of substantive and procedural due process and interference with familial relations.  \n27  This set of claims is directed against the individual defendants:  Officers Wade, Deguilo, \n28 \n- 5 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 6 of 16\n \n1  Chambers and Smith; and CWS workers Diaz-Lara and Lefler-Panela.  SAC ยถยถ 94-99.  The \n2  Court analyzes Defendantsโ arguments for dismissing these claims below. \n3  1.  Substantive Due Process \n4  Generally, โa Stateโs failure to protect an individual against private violence simply \n5  does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.โ  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. \n6  Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989).  The Ninth Circuit recognizes two \n7  exceptions to this general rule: (1) the โspecial relationshipโ exception; and (2) the โdanger \n8  creationโ exception.  L.W. v. Grubbs, 974 F.2d 119, 121 (9th Cir. 1992).  Plaintiffs rely on \n9  the latter, which applies โwhen the state affirmatively places the plaintiff in danger by \n10  acting with โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a โknown or obvious dangerโ (the state-created \n11  danger exception) . . . .โ  Patel v. Kent School Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971-72 (9th Cir. 2011) \n12  (citations omitted).  In assessing the applicability of this exception, courts look to:  \n13  โ(1) whether any affirmative actions of the official placed the individual in danger he \n14  otherwise would not have faced; (2) whether the danger was known or obvious; and \n15  (3) whether the officer acted with deliberate indifference to that danger.โ  Henry A. v. \n16  Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Pauluk v. Savage, 836 F.3d 1117, \n17  1124-25 (9th Cir. 2016).   \n18  The Court previously found that Plaintiffs had failed to allege sufficient facts to \n19  demonstrate that Defendants affirmatively placed Kayleigh in a position that increased the \n20  risk of harm to her.   Dkt. 45 at 9.  The SAC does not cure that deficiency.  As before, \n21  Plaintiffs continue to allege that Kayleighโs death was caused by Defendantsโ โfailure to \n22  investigate and/or report child abuse and/or neglect . . . , remove KAYLEIGH from her \n23  obviously abusive and dangerous home and seek emergency medical care for her, as \n24  required by generally accepted law enforcement standards and training.โ  SAC ยถ 90.  They \n25  add that Defendantsโ failure to investigate and report the abuse โincreased the risk of harm \n26  to Kayleigh.โ  Id.  Although there is no dispute as to the second and third elements of the \n27  state-created danger exception (i.e., known or obvious danger and deliberate indifference), \n28  the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not pled facts showing that the Defendants engaged in \n- 6 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 7 of 16\n \n1  affirmative action that increased the risk of harm to Kayleigh.  See DeShaney, 489 U.S. at \n2  201 (โWhile the State may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the free \n3  world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more \n4  vulnerable to them.โ); Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, 439 F.3d 1055, 1062 (9th Cir. 2006) \n5  (noting that a failure to protect claim is actionable only where the official โaffirmatively \n6  created an actual, particularized danger [the victim] would not otherwise have faced . . . .โ).  \n7  Defendantsโ inaction, without more, does not give rise to a claim for a violation of \n8  substantive due process.  Because further amendment to this claim appears futile, this claim \n9  is dismissed without further leave to amend.5   \n10  2.  Procedural Due Process \n11  The procedural due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment protects \n12  individuals against the deprivation of liberty or property by the government without due \n13  process.  Portman v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).  Protected \n14  liberty interests may arise either from the Due Process Clause itself or from statutory or \n15  regulatory provisions.  Hewitt. v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 466 (1983), overruled on other \n16  grounds by Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995).  โState law can create a right that the \n17  Due Process Clause will protect only if the state law contains โ(1) substantive predicates \n18  governing official decisionmaking, and (2) explicitly mandatory language specifying the \n19  outcome that must be reached if the substantive predicates have been met.โโ  James v. \n20  Rowlands, 606 F.3d 646, 656 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 842 \n21  (9th Cir. 1995)).   \n22  a)  Substantive Predicates to Decisionmaking \n23  Plaintiffs allege that their protected property interest arises principally from the \n24  mandatory child abuse reporting requirements set forth in the California Child Abuse and \n25  Neglect Reporting Act (โCANRAโ), Cal. Pen. Code ยงยง 11164-11174.4.  SAC ยถยถ 89, 90, \n26 \n                                                 \n27  5 Certainly, should Plaintiffs uncover new facts to support this claim during the \ncourse of discovery, this Order does not foreclose them from pursuing such a claim in the \n28  event they refile this action in state court. \n- 7 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 8 of 16\n \n1  95.6  Under CANRA, a mandated reporter7 who, in the scope of his or her employment or \n2  professional capacity, knows about or observes a child that he or she reasonably suspects is \n3  a victim of child abuse or neglect, must report the abuse to the county welfare department \n4  or any police or sheriffโs department or other statutorily designated agency.  Cal. Pen. Code \n5  ยงยง 11166(a), 11165.9.  Section 11166(a) requires an initial report by telephone and the \n6  submission of a written, follow-up report.  Id. ยง 11166(a).  Separate from the duties \n7  imposed on a mandatory reporter, subsection (k) requires that a law enforcement agency in \n8  receipt of a report of suspected child abuse or neglect to make a cross-report to the county \n9  welfare or probation department as soon as possible.  Id. ยง 11166(k).  The duty imposed by \n10  ยง 11166(k) is independent of the reporting duties under ยง 11166(a).  B.H. v. Cty. of San \n11  Bernardino, 62 Cal.4th 168, 185 (2015). \n12  In their prior motion to dismiss, Defendants argued that CANRA only creates \n13  discretionaryโas opposed to mandatoryโduties, and therefore, fails to provide any \n14  โsubstantive predicates to decision-making.โ  Dkt. 23 at 13.  The Court disagreed, finding \n15  that the plain language of the statute made it clear that such duties were mandatory.  In the \n16  course of its analysis, the Court cited Alejo v. City of Alhambra, 75 Cal.App.4th 1180, \n17  1186-88 (1999), which held that, pursuant to ยง 11166(a), law enforcement officers who \n18  receive a report of child abuse have: (1) an implied duty to investigate and (2) an express \n19  duty to take further action when an objectively reasonable person in the same situation \n20  would suspect child abuse.  Dkt. 45 at 10.  The Court nonetheless dismissed Plaintiffsโ \n21  procedural due process claim on the ground that the pleadings failed to demonstrate the \n22  second requirement; to wit, that CANRA and the other cited statutes and regulations \n23 \n                                                 \n24  6 The SAC alleges:  โAmong other sources, these rights under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments derive from statutory mandates as created by California law. \n25  Investigation and/or reporting of child abuse and/or neglect is mandatory under the \nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Penal Code ยง 11164 et seq., Welfare \n26  and Institutions Code ยงยง 10550, 10553, 10554, and 10651, and is intended by law for the \nbenefit and protection of children such as Kayleigh Slusher.โ  SAC ยถ 90. \n27 \n7 A โmandated reporterโ is defined to include a police officer, see Cal. Pen. Code \n28  ยง 11165.7(16), and a social worker, see id. ยง 11165.7(15). \n- 8 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 9 of 16\n \n1  contain mandatory language specifying the particular outcome that must be reached if the \n2  substantive predicates have been met.  Id. at 9-13. \n3  In the instant motions, Defendants contend that the Courtโs analysis of CANRA is \n4  no longer valid in light of the California Supreme Court subsequent ruling in B.H.  In that \n5  case, a private citizen called a 911 operator to report an incident of suspected child abuse \n6  during the childโs visit with his father.  The dispatcher relayed the report to the county \n7  Sheriffโs Department, which, in turn, dispatched a deputy to the childโs home to investigate \n8  the matter.  Three days later, the deputy prepared a report in which she noted there was an \n9  ongoing custody dispute between the childโs parents and that such information should be \n10  noted for the file.  Weeks later, the child suffered serious, traumatic head injuries inflicted \n11  by his father.  The childโs mother, as his guardian ad litem, sued the county and the deputy \n12  for failing to comply with their duties under ยง 11166(a) and (k).  The trial court and court \n13  of appeal ruled that the deputy and the Sheriffโs Department had no duty to cross-report the \n14  information from the 911 call or report the results of the deputyโs investigation. \n15  The California Supreme Court considered two issues on review:  โ(1) whether \n16  CANRA imposed a mandatory duty on the Sheriffโs Department to cross-report the child \n17  abuse allegations to the relevant child welfare agency when it received the 911 report and \n18  (2) whether CANRA imposed a mandatory duty on the investigating deputy sheriff to \n19  report the child abuse allegations and her investigative findings to the relevant child welfare \n20  agency despite her conclusion of no child abuse.โ  B.H., 62 Cal.4th at 174.  As to the first \n21  issue, the court held that, upon receiving the 911 report, the Sheriffโs Department had a \n22  mandatory and ministerial duty under ยง 11166(k) to cross-report the child abuse allegations \n23  to the county child welfare agency, and that the failure to cross-report could support a \n24  finding of breach of a mandatory duty.  Id. at 183-86.  The court explained that, in enacting \n25  CANRA, โthe Legislature intended that the various law enforcement and child welfare \n26  agencies immediately communicate to each other information received on alleged child \n27  abuse or neglect so that they may in turn coordinate their investigative procedures.โ  Id. at \n28  185. \n- 9 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 10 of 16\n \n1  With regard to the second issue, the court concluded that the deputy had no duty \n2  under ยง 11166(a) to report the results of her investigation because she was merely \n3  investigating a report of child abuse, and was not acting as a mandatory reporter who had \n4  become aware of the abuse in the first instance.  The court noted that under its plain terms, \n5  ยง 11166(a) โonly requires mandated reporters to make reports if the reporter, in his or her \n6  professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment, knows or reasonably \n7  suspects child abuse or neglect.โ  Id. at 188 (emphasis added).   \n8  In circumscribing the obligations imposed under ยง 11166(a), the supreme court \n9  disagreed with the Alejo courtโs determination that ยง 11166(a) imposes mandatory duties \n10  on law enforcement officers who have received a report of child abuse.8  The court \n11  explained that Alejo โconflates an officerโs mandatory reporting duties with those of an \n12  officer investigating a reported instance of alleged child abuse or neglect.  It failed to \n13  recognize that there is โa dichotomy between reporter and reportee, i.e., . . . those who make \n14  the initial report and the officials who come laterโ in performing their investigatory or \n15  prosecutorial functions.โ  Id.  In the courtโs view, ยง 11166(a) is aimed specifically at \n16  defined mandatory reporters, who are obligated to report suspected child abuse when a \n17  reasonable person would suspect abuse.  Id. at 193.  That reporting obligation, however, \n18  does not extend to a reporteeโi.e., a person, such as the deputy, who merely received a \n19  third party report of abuse and was conducting an investigation based on information \n20  reported to her.  The court did note, however, that a reportee would, in some circumstances, \n21  have a reporting obligation if he or she observed abuse that was not contained in the \n22  original report.  For instance, the deputy โwould have been required to report were she \n23  dispatched to investigate a report of a suspected incident of child abuse and observed \n24  evidence that would sustain an objective suspicion that a different, previously unreported \n25  incident or instance of child abuse had occurred.โ  Id. at 197. \n26 \n                                                 \n27  8 The court did not, as City Defendants suggest, completely overrule Alejo.  See \nB.H., 62 Cal.4th at 188 n.6.  Rather, B.H. only rejects the Alejo courtโs interpretation of the \n28  duties imposed upon a law enforcement official who is investigating a report of child abuse.   \n- 10 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 11 of 16\n \n1  According to City Defendants, B.H. vitiates any claim by Plaintiffs that they had a \n2  mandatory duty to do anything in response to Robinโs reports of suspected abuse.  Dkt. 87 \n3  at 14.  This contention lacks merit.  The SAC alleges that on January 23, 2014, it was \n4  reported to the NPD and Officer Wade that Kayleigh was in immediate physical danger due \n5  to Krueger and Warnerโs failure to provide her with food, drug users coming in and out of \n6  the house at all hours, and the possibility of her being subjected to physical violence.  SAC \n7  ยถยถ 38-40.  Despite this information, Officer Wade, as a mandatory reporter, did not cross-\n8  report this information to CWS or otherwise undertake any other action.  Id. ยถยถ 41-42.  In \n9  failing to do so, the facts alleged are sufficient to demonstrate that Officer Wade violated \n10  his mandatory and ministerial duty under ยง 11166(k) to cross-report to the county child \n11  welfare agency.  B.H., 62 Cal.4th at 1181 (โSection 11166, subdivision (k) imposes an \n12  obligatory duty, and not merely a discretionary or permissive authorization, upon law \n13  enforcement agencies to cross-report the child abuse or neglect reports that it receives.โ).    \n14  Similarly, on January 29, 2014, Robin again contacted the NPD and Officer Wade to \n15  report that Kayleigh was in imminent physical danger due to illegal drug use in her home, \n16  lack of food and care, and potential physical violence.  SAC ยถ 66.  Neither cross-reported \n17  this information, as required by CANRA.  Id. ยถ 74.  Upon visiting the apartment where \n18  Kayleigh resided, Officers Wade and Deguilio observed indicia of long-term physical \n19  abuse.  Kayleigh appeared gaunt, sick, had multiple and severe contusions (including a 4-\n20  inch bruise on her forehead and another bruise on her temple).  They also saw her vomit as \n21  a result of infectious peritonitis and necrotic small intestine.  Id. ยถ 67.  Construing the facts \n22  in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, a trier-of-fact could reasonably conclude that the \n23  officers had observed that a โdifferent, previously unreported incident or instance of child \n24  abuse had occurred,โ thereby triggering their mandatory reporting obligation under \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n- 11 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 12 of 16\n \n1  CANRA.  See B.H., 62 Cal.4th at 197.9  The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have \n2  sufficiently alleged the existence of substantive predicates governing official \n3  decisionmaking. \n4  b)  Mandatory Language Specifying the Outcome \n5  The second aspect of a procedural due process claim requires Plaintiffs to \n6  demonstrate the existence of โexplicitly mandatory language specifying the outcome that \n7  must be reached if the substantive predicates have been met.โ  James, 606 F.3d at 656.  \n8  Here, Plaintiffs contend that if Defendants had complied with their mandatory duties to \n9  report and investigate Robinโs reports of child abuse, Kayleigh would have been taken into \n10  protective custody and received emergency medical treatment.  Dkt. 110 at 16; see SAC \n11  ยถ 83.  In particular, they point to language in CANRA stating that โall personsโ \n12  investigating child abuse โshall consider the needs of the child victim and shall do whatever \n13  is necessary to prevent psychological harm to the child victim.โ  Cal. Pen. Code ยง 11164(b) \n14  (emphasis added).  They also cite Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 16501(f) and 16504(a), \n15  which require that county welfare agencies โrespond to any report of imminent danger to a \n16  child immediatelyโ and to conduct an โimmediate in-person response . . . in emergency \n17  situations,โ respectively.   \n18  While the aforementioned provisions clearly impose specific duties on law \n19  enforcement officials and county welfare workers, they do not contain any โexplicitly \n20  mandatory languageโ requiring the immediate removal of a childโor any other particular \n21  actionโin every case where child abuse is suspected.  Rather, the statutes merely articulate \n22  the procedure for evaluating, reporting and investigating claims of abuse; they do not \n23 \n                                                 \n24  9 City Defendants argue the officersโ failure to cross-report Robinโs complaints \nwould have made no difference in terms of protecting Kayleigh from her mother and \n25  boyfriend, since CWS already knew about those complaints and decided to take no action.  \nThe flaw in that argument is that it overlooks Plaintiffsโ allegations regarding Officers \n26  Wade and Deguiloโs visit to Kayleighโs home on January 29, 2014.  At that time, the \nofficers observed clear signs that Kayleigh had been beaten and was malnourished and \n27  seriously ill.  The officers did not report this new, previously unknown information to \nCWS.  Thus, irrespective of Robinโs prior reports, the officersโ observations triggered their \n28  duty to cross-report their findings. \n- 12 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 13 of 16\n \n1  contain any โexplicitly mandatory language specifying the outcome that must be reachedโ \n2  upon the discharge of those procedural duties.  See James, 606 F.3d at 656.  Rather, \n3  California law provides that the ultimate decision as to what course of action to undertake \n4  following a report and investigation of suspected child abuse is highly discretionary and is \n5  not governed by objective and defined criteria.  See Jacqueline T. v. Alameda Cty. Child \n6  Protective Servs., 155 Cal.App.4th 456, 468 (2007); Cal. Wel. & Inst. ยง 306.  For those \n7  reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a right created under state \n8  law that is subject to protection under the Due Process Clause.  Kentucky Depโt of Corr. v. \n9  Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 464 (1989) (no viable due process claim established where the \n10  โregulations at issue . . . stop short of requiring that a particular result is to be reached upon \n11  a finding that the substantive predicates are met.โ).10  Because further amendment to this \n12  claim appears futile, Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim is dismissed without further \n13  leave to amend.   \n14  3.  Interference with Familial Relations \n15  A claim for interference with familial relations may be grounded on the First or the \n16  Fourteenth Amendment.  See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 685 (9th Cir. \n17  2001).  Plaintiffs state that โ[they] do not contest that the applicable liability standard for a \n18  familial association claim under either the First or Fourteenth Amendment is the same as \n19  for the underlying claim.โ  Dkt. 109 at 20.11  In view of the Courtโs determination that \n20 \n21 \n                                                 \n22  10 Plaintiffsโ reliance on Lyles v. City of Huntington Park, No. CV 16-3223-GW \n(KSx) (C.D. Cal. Jul. 7, 2016) is misplaced.  See Haddad Decl. Ex. A, Dkt. 111.  In Lyles, \n23  the district court found, as the Court does here, that the California Penal Code imposes the \nsufficient mandatory requirements for purposes of establishing a procedural due process \n24  claim.  The decision, however, does not reach the dispositive issue in this case, which is \nwhether those statutes recite an explicit, mandatory outcome upon discharge of those \n25  duties.  \n26  11 Plaintiffs erroneously contend that the applicable standard is โfailure to take \nobjectively reasonable measures in response to a serious risk of harm.โ Id. (citing Castro v. \n27  Cty. of L.A., 833 F.3d 1060, 1072, (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc)).  Castro involved the legal \nstandard applicable to claims by pretrial detainees for failure to protect from assault while \n28  in custody, and is inapposite to this case.   \n- 13 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 14 of 16\n \n1  Plaintiffs have failed to state any cognizable underlying due process claims, their claim for \n2  interference with familial association is dismissed without further leave to amend. \n3  B.  MONELL LIABILITY \n4  In the absence of an underlying constitutional violation, Count Two of the SAC for \n5  Monell liability similarly fails.  See Simmons v. Navajo Cty., 609 F.3d 1011, 1021 (9th Cir. \n6  2010) (โ[W]e hold that where there was no underlying constitutional violation, the \n7  [plaintiffs] cannot maintain a claim for municipal liability.โ).  The Court therefore \n8  dismisses said claim without further leave to amend. \n9  C.  SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION \n10  Plaintiffsโ remaining claims for violation of the Bane Act and for \n11  negligence/negligence per se are based upon California state law.  A district court may \n12  decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has \n13  original jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(c)(3); Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d \n14  550, 561 (9th Cir. 2010).  โโ[I]n the usual case in which all federal-law claims are \n15  eliminated before trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent \n16  jurisdiction doctrineโjudicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comityโwill point \n17  toward declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.โโ  Sanford, \n18  625 F.3d at 561 (quoting Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n.7 (1988), \n19  superseded on other grounds by statute as recognized in Fent v. Okla. Water Res. Bd., 235 \n20  F.3d 553, 557 (10th Cir. 2000)).  Having now dismissed all federal claims alleged against \n21  Defendants, the Court declines to assert supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ \n22  remaining claims.  See City of Colton v. Am. Promotional Events, Inc.-West, 614 F.3d 998, \n23  1008 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that district court acted within its discretion in declining to \n24  exercise supplemental jurisdiction after granting summary judgment on all federal claims); \n25  see also Harrell v. 20th Century Ins. Co., 934 F.2d 203, 205 (9th Cir. 1991) (โit is generally \n26  preferable for a district court to remand remaining pendant claims to state court . . . .โ). \n27  Plaintiffs request that the Court exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their state \n28  law claims so that they may appeal the dismissal of the federal claims.  Dkt. 109 at 22.  \n- 14 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 15 of 16\n \n1  Under Rule 54(b), Plaintiffs cannot separately appeal the dismissal of their federal claims \n2  unless the Court permits the entry of judgment on less than all of the claims.  Fed. R. Civ. \n3  P. 54(b).  However, this case is not suited for certification under Rule 54(b), as the state law \n4  claims are based on the same set of facts underlying the federal claims.  See Wood v. GCC \n5  Bend, LLC, 422 F.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir. 2005) (reversing Rule 54(b) certification where the \n6  dismissed claims were largely based on the same set of facts as the remaining claims); \n7  Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Archer, 655 F.2d 962, 965 (9th Cir. 1981) (โA similarity of legal \n8  or factual issues will weigh heavily against entry of judgment under [Rule 54(b)]โ).  \n9  Declining to assert supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims will, however, \n10  facilitate Plaintiffsโ ability to refile them in state court while simultaneously allowing them \n11  to pursue an appeal before the Ninth Circuit.   \n12  IV.  CONCLUSION \n13  The horrific murder of Kayleigh likely could have been prevented had the police \n14  officers and social workers involved in this case performed their jobs with any semblance \n15  of competence.  Robinโs numerous reports were all but ignored, with tragic consequences.  \n16  Nonetheless, binding case law requires this Court to dismiss the federal claims alleged in \n17  this action.  Accordingly,  \n18  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:  \n19  1.  Defendantsโ motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to Plaintiffsโ \n20  federal claims, as set forth above, which are dismissed without further leave to amend. \n21  2.  The Court declines to assert supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining \n22  state law claims for violation of the Bane Act and negligence/negligence per se.  Plaintiffs \n23  may re-file these claims in state court.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(d), the statute of \n24  limitations with respect to these claims shall be tolled during the time period that this suit \n25  has been pending and for thirty (30) days following entry of this Order, unless California \n26  law provides for a longer tolling period.  Defendantsโ motions to dismiss Plaintiffโs state \n27  law claims therefore are DENIED as moot. \n28   \n- 15 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 126   Filed 12/07/16   Page 16 of 16\n \n1  3.

This is a civil rights action arising from Defendantsโ violation of mandatory duties to \n6 \ninvestigate and/or report child abuse and/or neglect, and to refrain from creating danger and \n7 \n8  increasing Plaintiffsโ risk of harm, which resulted in the death of Plaintiff KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, \n9  Deceased, on or about January 30, 2014, in the City of Napa, Napa County, California.  This action \n10 \nis brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988; and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to \n11 \nthe United States Constitution, as well as the laws and Constitution of the State of California.  \n12 \nJurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and (4), and the aforementioned \n13 \nstatutory and constitutional provisions.  Plaintiffs further invoke the supplemental jurisdiction of \n14 \nthis Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง1367 to hear and decide claims arising under state law.   \n15 \n16  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n17    2.   A substantial part of the events and/or omissions complained of herein occurred in \n18 \nthe City of Napa, Napa County, California, and this action is properly assigned to the San Francisco \n19 \nor Oakland Divisions of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, \n20 \npursuant to Civil Local Rule 3-2(e). \n21 \n  PARTIES AND PROCEDURE \n22 \n  3.  Plaintiff JASON SLUSHER is the father of decedent, KAYLEIGH SLUSHER.  \n23 \n24  Plaintiff JASON SLUSHER brings these claims individually and as a Successor in Interest for his \n25 \ndaughter and only child, Kayleigh Slusher, Deceased, pursuant to California Code of Civil \n26 \nProcedure sections 377.20 et seq. and 377.60 et seq. which provide for survival and wrongful death \n27 \nactions.

Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER had the closest possible healthy relationship with \n9  her granddaughter, KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, that a grandmother could have.  For substantial periods \n10 \nof KAYLEIGH SLUSHERโS life, ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER provided for KAYLEIGHโS \n11 \nfinancial, emotional, and physical support, including while KAYLEIGH lived in ROBIN and \n12 \nBENNY SLUSHERโS home, and afterward.  ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER had a long-standing \n13 \ncustodial relationship with KAYLEIGH SLUSHER such that they constituted a family unit.   \n14 \nBesides Plaintiffs JASON SLUSHER, ROBIN SLUSHER, and BENNY SLUSHER, no other \n15 \n16  person had a closer, more intimate, healthy, familial relationship with KAYLEIGH SLUSHER.   \n17    5.  Plaintiff BENNY SLUSHER is the grandfather of Decedent KAYLEIGH SLUSHER \n18 \nand a resident of the State of California.  Plaintiff BENNY SLUSHER brings these claims \n19 \nindividually.  Plaintiff BENNY SLUSHER had the closest possible healthy relationship with his \n20 \ngranddaughter, KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, that a grandfather could have.  For substantial periods of \n21 \nKAYLEIGH SLUSHERโS life, ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER provided for KAYLEIGHโS \n22 \nfinancial, emotional, and physical support, including while KAYLEIGH lived in ROBIN and \n23 \n24  BENNY SLUSHERโS home, and afterward.

Doe Defendant CWS Workers are being sued in their \n7 \n8  individual capacities.  \n9    15.  The true names and capacities of other Defendants sued as DOES 1โ50 (โDOE \n10 \nDEFENDANTSโ), including Doe Police Officers and Doe CWS Workers, are unknown to \n11 \nPlaintiffs, who therefore sue these Defendants by such fictitious names, and Plaintiffs will seek \n12 \nleave to amend this complaint to show their true names and capacities when the same are \n13 \nascertained.

Plaintiffs reallege each and every paragraph in this complaint as if fully set forth \n21 \nhere. \n22 \n  23.  On or about January 30, 2014, KAYLEIGH SLUSHER was murdered in her home, \n23 \n24  on information and belief, by her mother's boyfriend Ryan Scott Warner and/or her mother, Sara \n25  Krueger, at 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7, in the City of Napa, County of Napa, California.  \n26 \nKAYLEIGH was three years old.  At this time, Plaintiffs are unaware of details concerning the \n27 \nexact circumstances and manner of Kayleigh Slusher's homicide, because the Napa Police \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    5 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 7 of 28\n \n1  Department has not provided such information in response to Plaintiffs' lawful requests for such \n2 \ninformation. \n3 \n  24.  At all relevant times herein, Decedent KAYLEIGH SLUSHER was a minor and was \n4 \na resident of the County of Napa and the City of Napa.  On information and belief, KAYLEIGH \n5 \nSLUSHER had been a client of County of Napa CWS from approximately October 2010 until \n6 \napproximately April 2012. \n7 \n8    25.  Prior to Kayleigh's death, PLAINTIFF ROBIN SLUSHER and others informed \n9  Defendant WADE and/or DOE NPD Officers on multiple occasions that Kayleigh was suffering \n10 \nabuse, neglect and was in immediate physical danger in her home due to the conduct, crimes, and \n11 \nactivities of Mr. Warner and Ms. Kreuger, including but not limited to abuse of unlawful controlled \n12 \nsubstances. \n13 \n  26.  KAYLEIGH SLUSHER was born on May 3, 2010, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHERโS \n14 \nbirthday. \n15 \n16    27.  KAYLEIGH SLUSHER and her mother Sara Krueger, lived with KAYLEIGHโS \n17  grandparents, Plaintiffs ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER, for over a year.  In addition, when \n18 \nKAYLEIGH moved from ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHERโS home into an apartment with her \n19 \nmother, Sara Krueger, Plaintiffs ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER paid for Ms. Kruegerโs rent and \n20 \ntelephone expenses for several months so that KAYLEIGH could have a safe place to live and \n21 \ncontact with her family. \n22 \n  28.  In addition, throughout KAYLEIGHโS life, Plaintiffs ROBIN and BENNY \n23 \n24  SLUSHER, in addition to JASON SLUSHER, paid for Kayleighโs clothing, toys, material needs, \n25 \nmedicine, and bought food for the household in which KAYLEIGH lived, including when \n26 \nKAYLEIGH and Ms. Krueger lived separately from ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER. \n27 \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    6 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 8 of 28\n \n1    29.  In addition, ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER frequently had custody of KAYLEIGH \n2 \nfor overnight and weekend visits, and frequently had her with them during the day, even when \n3 \nKAYLEIGH did not live full-time in the SLUSHERSโ house.  The parties lived near each other, in \n4 \nthe City of Napa, and ROBIN and BENNY SLUSHER saw KAYLEIGH regularly. \n5 \n  30.  In or around October 2013, Ms. Krueger began denying ROBIN and BENNY \n6 \nSLUSHER their usual access to, and contacts with, their granddaughter KAYLEIGH.  During this \n7 \n8  time, Plaintiff JASON SLUSHER was in prison for a crime unrelated to his relationship with \n9  KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, and he was not able to protect his daughter. \n10 \n  31.  During this time, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Ms. \n11 \nKrueger was using illegal drugs and had moved Ryan Warner, who was also using illegal drugs and \n12 \nhad a criminal history and a warrant for his arrest, into her home, thereby endangering the life and \n13 \nsafety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER.  Despite repeated attempts by Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER to see \n14 \nher granddaughter, Ms. Krueger repeatedly refused ROBIN access to KAYLEIGH for a matter of \n15 \n16  months. \n17    32.  On or about January 23, 2014, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER contacted NPD to \n18 \nrequest a welfare check on KAYLEIGH.  ROBIN SLUSHER called Defendant NPD to inform the \n19 \npolice that KAYLEIGH may be suffering severe abuse, neglect, was in immediate physical danger, \n20 \nand to request police intervention to save KAYLEIGH.  MS. SLUSHER called anonymously \n21 \nbecause she did not want Ms. Krueger to learn she had called the police and preclude her from \n22 \nseeing KAYLEIGH. \n23 \n24    33.  MS. SLUSHER informed Defendant NPD that KAYLEIGH was living in a \n25 \ndangerous household with โRyan,โ whose last name she did not know, but who had a warrant for \n26 \nhis arrest.  MS. SLUSHER informed Defendant NPD that Mr. Warner and Ms. Krueger were using \n27 \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    7 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 9 of 28\n \n1  illegal drugs such as โcrankโ (methamphetamine) in KAYLEIGHโS home, and she was worried \n2 \nabout whether or not KAYLEIGH was being given enough food and for KAYLEIGHโS safety. \n3 \n  34.  On or about January 23, 2015, around 6:10 p.m., Defendant WADE was dispatched \n4 \nto go to 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7, for a warrant arrest.  On information and belief, Defendant \n5 \nWADE was advised that a man who lived there (Mr. Warner), had an outstanding warrant for his \n6 \narrest.  On information and belief, Defendant WADE was also advised that a small child of three or \n7 \n8  four years old, Kayleigh, was in immediate physical danger due to Mr. Warner's and Ms. Kreuger's \n9  illicit drug use in the home at 2060 Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7, due to Mr. Warner's and Ms. Kreuger's \n10 \nfailure to provide food to Kayleigh, due to drug users coming in and out of the home at all hours, \n11 \nand due to possible physical violence against Kayleigh.  On information and belief, Defendant \n12 \nWADE was also advised that Mr. Warner stays inside the home with Kayleigh all the time, smokes \n13 \nall the time, uses โCrank,โ and he might be armed.  \n14 \n  35.  Rather than perform a welfare check or any investigation into Kayleigh's safety and \n15 \n16  wellbeing, Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Defendant WADE decided \n17  not to go to the house where Kayleigh lived, not to investigate further, not to report suspected child \n18 \nabuse or neglect, not to seek further advice, assistance, or backup, not to serve any warrant there, \n19 \nand not to arrest any fugitive who may be living with Kayleigh and using drugs around her, and \n20 \ninstead Defendant WADE cleared the call.  On information and belief, Defendant WADE chose not \n21 \nto investigate the report of child abuse and/or neglect in Kayleighโs home, because he determined \n22 \nthat the environment in which Kayleigh lived was not safe for him or his partner to go there. \n23 \n24    36.  At all relevant times, Defendant WADE was a Mandated Reporter under the \n25 \nCalifornia Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (\"CANRA\"), including California Penal Code \n26 \nยง11165.7.  Despite the fact that Defendant WADE knew, had reason to know and/or reasonably \n27 \nsuspected that Kayleigh was suffering child abuse and/or neglect, Defendant WADE failed to \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    8 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 10 of 28\n \n1  investigate and/or report the abuse and neglect as required by California Penal Code ยงยง 11164 et \n2 \nseq, 11165.9, and 11166.  Defendant WADE never made any report of child abuse and/or neglect in \n3 \nrelation to Kayleigh to Napa County CWS or any other authority. \n4 \n  37.  On or about January 27, 2014, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER contacted Napa County \n5 \nCWS by phone on more than one occasion and reported to Defendant CWS Workers DIAZ-LARA \n6 \nand LEFLER-PANELA that there had been a CWS case open for KAYLEIGH at some previous \n7 \n8  time, and that Ms. Krueger and her boyfriend were using drugs, which Ms. Slusher believed to be \n9  crank or crack, in the home.  ROBIN SLUSHER further informed Defendants DIAZ-LARA and \n10 \nLEFLER-PANELA that the drugs were accessible to KAYLEIGH, that Ms. Krueger and her \n11 \nboyfriend were intentionally depriving KAYLEIGH of food, that KAYLEIGH had lost weight, \n12 \nthere was a lot of traffic in and out of the home, and there was a warrant for the arrest of Ms. \n13 \nKruegerโs boyfriend. \n14 \n  38.  Shortly thereafter, Defendant LEFLER-PANELA called ROBIN SLUSHER back \n15 \n16  and said there was nothing CWS could do, and told Ms. Slusher she could call the police instead. \n17    39.  At all relevant times Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and DIAZ-LARA were \n18 \nmandated reporters, including under California Penal Code ยง 11165.7. \n19 \n  40.  Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and DIAZ-LARA had the mandatory duties to \n20 \nrespond, investigate and/or report the abuse and/or severe neglect under California law, including \n21 \nCalifornia Penal Code ยงยง 11165.9 and 11166, California Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 328, \n22 \n10553, 10554, 16501, 16504, and California Department of Social Services Child Welfare Services \n23 \n24  Regulations ยงยง 31-100, 31-101, 31-105, 31-110, 31-115, 31-120, 31-125, 31-130, and 31-501.  \n25 \nThese mandatory duties include, but are not limited to: \n26 \na)  The duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect to the police or sheriff's \ndepartment (P.C. ยงยง 11165.9 and 11166(j); DSS Regulations Ch. 31-501); \n27 \n \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    9 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 11 of 28\n \n1  b)  The duty to immediately refer the case by telephone, fax, or electronic \ntransmission to an agency with proper jurisdiction, if the agency that takes a \n2 \nreport lacks jurisdiction (P.C. ยง11165.9); \n \n3 \nc)  The duty to make \"an initial report by telephone to the police or sheriff's \ndepartment as soon as is practicably possible,\" and to \"prepare and send, fax, or \n4 \nelectronically transmit a written follow-up report within 36 hours of receiving \n5  the information\" concerning the abuse and/or neglect (P.C. ยง11166(a)); \n \n6 \nd)  The duty to \"immediately make any investigation he or she deems necessary to \ndetermine whether child welfare services should be offered to the family and \n7 \nwhether proceedings in the juvenile court should be commenced\" (W&I ยง328); \n8   \ne)  The duty to \"respond to any report of imminent danger to a child immediately\" \n9  (W&I ยง16501(f)); \n \n10 \nf)  The duty to make \"an immediate in-person response\" in โemergency situations\" \n(W&I ยง16504(a)); \n11 \n \n12  g)  The duty to \"respond to all referrals for service which allege that a child is \nendangered by abuse, neglect, or exploitation\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-101.1); \n13   \nh)  The duty to \"immediately initiate and complete the Emergency Response \n14 \nProtocol process\" and to \"record all available and appropriate information on \nthe Emergency Response Protocol Form\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-105); \n15 \n \n16  i)  The duty to conduct an in-person immediate investigation when the \"emergency \nresponse protocol indicates the existence of a situation in which imminent \n17  danger to a child, such as physical pain, injury, disability, severe emotional \nharm or death, is likely\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-115); \n18 \n \nj)  The duty to request law enforcement assistance where \"the physical safety of \n19 \nfamily members. . .is endangered\" (DSS Regulations Ch. 31-130). \n20   \n  41.  Despite the fact that Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA knew, had \n21 \nreason to know and/or reasonably suspected that Kayleigh was suffering child abuse and/or severe \n22 \nneglect, and an emergency situation, with deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of \n23 \n24  KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, they violated their mandatory duties to respond, investigate and/or report \n25 \nthe abuse and/or neglect as required by law, including California Penal Code ยงยง 11165.9 and 11166, \n26 \nby California Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 328, 10553, 10554, 16501, 16504 and by California \n27 \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    10 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 12 of 28\n \n1  Department of Social Services Child Welfare Services Regulations ยงยง 31-100, 31-101, 31-105, 31-\n2 \n110, 31-115, 31-120, 31-125, 31-130, and 31-501. \n3 \n  42.  Further, Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA, with deliberate \n4 \nindifference to the rights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER,  failed to accept reports of \n5 \nsuspected child abuse and/or severe neglect without legal justification and did not properly maintain \n6 \na record of all reports received as mandated by Penal Code ยง 11165.9. \n7 \n8    43.  Defendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA, with deliberate indifference to \n9  the rights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, wrongfully delivered child protective services by \n10 \nfailing to conduct an assessment and develop a case plan as mandated by DSS Regulations ยงยง 31-\n11 \n201, 31-205, 31-206 and/or Welfare and Institutions Code ยง16501.1. \n12 \n  44.  Even though Defendants LEFLER-PANELA, DIAZ-LARA and/or DOE CWS \n13 \nWorkers received various reports of abuse and/or severe neglect, with deliberate indifference to the \n14 \nrights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, they violated their mandatory duties by choosing not \n15 \n16  conduct a basic evaluation of risks to determine whether an emergency situation existed as \n17  mandated by Welfare and Institutions Code ยง ยง 16504 and/or DSS Regulations ยง ยง 31-101, 31-105, \n18 \n31-110, 31-115, 31-120 and/or 31-128. \n19 \n  45.  Even though Defendants LEFLER-PANELA, DIAZ-LARA and/or DOE CWS \n20 \nWorkers received various reports of abuse and/or severe neglect, with deliberate indifference to the \n21 \nrights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, they violated their mandatory duties by choosing not \n22 \nto control the conduct of Ryan Warner and/or Sara Kreuger, and/or otherwise protect Kayleigh as \n23 \n24  mandated by Welfare and Institutions Code ยง ยง 16501 and 16504. \n25 \n  46.  With deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of KAYLEIGH SLUSHER, \n26 \nDefendants LEFLER-PANELA and/or DIAZ-LARA violated their duties as mandated reporters to \n27 \nreport suspected child abuse and/or severe neglect to appropriate authorities and to make initial \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    11 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 13 of 28\n \n1  reports or follow up reports within 36 hours of receiving said reports of abuse and/or severe neglect \n2 \nas mandated by Penal Code ยง ยง 11165.9 and 11166(a).  Rather, Defendants told Plaintiff ROBIN \n3 \nSLUSHER she could call the police instead. \n4 \n  47.  On or around January 29, 2014, Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER again contacted NPD to \n5 \ninform them that her granddaughter was in grave danger, and requesting assistance.  The NPD again \n6 \ndispatched Defendant WADE, this time to do a welfare check for Kayleighโs benefit at 2060 \n7 \n8  Wilkins Avenue, Apt. 7.  Defendant WADE spoke with Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER on the \n9  telephone, who told Defendant WADE that Kayleigh was in immediate physical danger due to Mr. \n10 \nWarner's and Ms. Kreuger's illegal drug use in the home, their failure to provide food and care to \n11 \nKayleigh, and possible physical violence against Kayleigh.  Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER told \n12 \nDefendant WADE that she had not been allowed to talk with her granddaughter, Kayleigh since \n13 \napproximately Thanksgiving; that she believed Kayleighโs mother, Ms. Krueger, was using drugs \n14 \nand allowing others to use drugs in Kayleighโs home, possibly crack cocaine; that Kayleigh was not \n15 \n16  being fed; and that when she has attempted to check on or see her granddaughter, Ms. Krueger has \n17  refused and told her that Kayleigh has been sick since Thanksgiving.  \n18 \n  48.  On information and belief, Defendants WADE and NPD Officer DEGUILIO visited \n19 \nKayleigh's residence later on January 29, 2014.  On information and belief, the following facts in \n20 \nthis paragraph occurred at that time.  Ms. Krueger refused Defendants permission to enter the home \n21 \nto perform a welfare check on Kayleigh, and Defendants were aware that Ms. Krueger actively tried \n22 \nto conceal the inside of her home from the officers by closing the front door against her body and \n23 \n24  peeking her head out to talk to them.  During that visit, Ms. Krueger brought Kayleigh to the front \n25 \ndoor and Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO observed bruises on Kayleigh's face.  Defendants \n26 \ncould not see the rest of Kayleighโs body, including her arms and legs, which were covered by her \n27 \nclothes.  Defendants were able to observe a man walk out of a back bedroom and look very \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    12 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 14 of 28\n \n1  surprised to see the officers there.  Defendants saw that that man appeared to be very malnourished, \n2 \nwith sunken cheekbones, and appeared to be a drug user.  That man told Defendants his name was \n3 \nRyan Howard, and that he did not have, and he could not find, any identification.  Defendants ran a \n4 \nrecords check on โRyan Howard,โ and dispatch was unable to locate any match.  That man who \n5 \nclaimed to be โRyan Howardโ was actually โRyan Warner.โ  When Defendants first encountered \n6 \nRyan Howard (Warner) at Kayleighโs home, Defendants determined that he was under the influence \n7 \n8  of a controlled substance, based on their training and experience due to his appearance and obvious \n9  symptoms of drug intoxication.  Ryan Howard (Warner) admitted to Defendants that he had used \n10 \nmarijuana and Ms. Kruegerโs prescription pain medication that day, without a prescription for it.  \n11 \nDefendants entered the residence.  Defendants did not search the residence, nor did Defendants \n12 \nobserve every room, or whether or not there were weapons or illegal drugs, or whether there was \n13 \nsufficient food for Kayleigh.  While Defendants were there, another man walked out of a back \n14 \nbedroom, whom officers recognized from past contacts as someone currently on probation.  That \n15 \n16  second man attempted to quickly leave the residence, and Defendants detained him for a probation \n17  search.  While Kayleigh was sitting on Ms. Kruegerโs lap on a couch, Defendants saw Kayleigh \n18 \nvomit.  Ms. Krueger stated that Kayleigh had the flu, and immediately took Kayleigh into the \n19 \nbathroom, away from the officers.  Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO also observed that Kayleigh \n20 \nappeared gaunt, sick, malnourished, and distressed.  Defendants did not attempt to speak with \n21 \nKayleigh.  Ms. Krueger asked Defendants to leave, and Defendants left.  Defendant WADE later \n22 \ndetermined that the man claiming to be โRyan Howardโ had lied to them about his identity, and that \n23 \n24  he was actually Ryan Warner.  On information and belief, Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO also \n25 \nconfirmed that there was an active arrest warrant for Ryan Warner and/or legal cause for his \n26 \nimmediate arrest.  Defendants made no effort to obtain a warrant to re-enter Kayleighโs home, \n27 \nsearch Kayleighโs home, or arrest anyone in Kayleighโs home.  Defendant WADE then called \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    13 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 15 of 28\n \n1  Plaintiff ROBIN SLUSHER, and told her that everything appeared normal at Kayleighโs home, and \n2 \nthat Kayleigh had food.  Defendant WADE also promised and reassured Plaintiff ROBIN \n3 \nSLUSHER that he would \"keep an eye on the apartment.\" \n4 \n  49.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that Defendant WADE \n5 \nviolated his promise and never went back to the apartment before Kayleigh was murdered.  On \n6 \ninformation and belief, Defendant WADE also did not ask any other member of the NPD to monitor \n7 \n8  the apartment. \n9    50.  At all relevant times, Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO were Mandated Reporters \n10 \nunder the California Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (\"CANRA\").  On information and \n11 \nbelief, Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO violated their mandatory duties to investigate and/or \n12 \nreport the abuse and neglect as required by California Penal Code ยง ยง 11164 et seq, 11165.9, and \n13 \n11166, despite knowing, having reason to know and/or reasonably suspecting that Kayleigh was \n14 \nsuffering child abuse/neglect.  Neither Defendants WADE nor DEGUILIO ever made any report of \n15 \n16  suspected child abuse and/or neglect in relation to Kayleigh to Napa County CWS or any other \n17  agency or authority. \n18 \n  51.  Plaintiffs relied on the representations of Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO that \n19 \neverything appeared normal with Kayleigh and at Kayleighโs home, that there was food for \n20 \nKayleigh in the home, and that they would โkeep an eye on the apartment.โ  Those representations \n21 \nwere false.  Had Plaintiffs known the truth about what transpired during Defendantsโ welfare check \n22 \non Kayleigh, Plaintiffs would have taken immediate action to protect Kayleigh, including making \n23 \n24  further efforts to seek protection for Kayleigh from the NPD and the Napa County CWS, contacting \n25 \nother authorities or child advocates for assistance, personally going to Kayleighโs home, or \n26 \nengaging in other self-help to try to protect Kayleigh.  Instead, Plaintiffs relied to their (and \n27 \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    14 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 16 of 28\n \n1  Kayleighโs) detriment on Defendantsโ false representations that everything appeared normal at \n2 \nKayleighโs home, and that the NPD would monitor the apartment to protect Kayleigh.   \n3 \n  52.  Through their volitional, intentional, and deliberately indifferent acts, omissions, and \n4 \nmisrepresentations, Defendants WADE and DEGUILIO affirmatively placed Kayleigh Slusher in \n5 \ndanger, exposing her to a danger which she would not have otherwise faced, and leaving her in a \n6 \nsituation that was more dangerous than the one in which they found her. \n7 \n8    53.  On or about February 1, 2014, NPD Officers responded to a call to do another \n9  welfare check at Kayleigh's home.  When NPD Officers arrived there, they discovered Kayleigh \n10 \nSlusher in her bed, deceased, with evidence of having suffered severe physical abuse. \n11 \n  54.  Defendants' failure to investigate and/or report the abuse and/or neglect was without \n12 \nlegal justification, caused great pain and suffering to Plaintiffs, and caused Kayleigh Slusherโs \n13 \ndeath.  These injuries, including but not limited to physical abuse, neglect and death, were of the \n14 \ntype the California Legislature intended to prevent in enacting the Child Abuse and Neglect \n15 \n16  Reporting Act, Penal Code ยง 11164 et seq., Welfare and Institutions Code ยงยง 10550, 10553, 10554, \n17  and 10651.  Additionally, Defendants' affirmative acts and omissions, including failure to \n18 \ninvestigate, report, intervene and/or protect Kayleigh Slusher from known and foreseeable harms, \n19 \nincluding physical and sexual abuse and death, created danger and increased the risk of harm to \n20 \nKayleigh.  Defendants further created danger and increased the risk of harm to Kayleigh, through \n21 \ntheir affirmative acts and omissions, by creating a false sense of security and safety as to Plaintiffs \n22 \nand others who wished to protect Kayleigh from harm, and by encouraging and/or preventing \n23 \n24  Plaintiffs and others from seeking other assistance and from protecting Kayleigh themselves.  \n25 \n  55.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff KAYLEIGH SLUSHER had a due \n26 \nprocess right to life and a liberty interest in bodily integrity and security, including a protected \n27 \nliberty interest to the non-discretionary investigation, reporting, and protection mandated for her \n28 \n \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND    15 \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 1   Filed 05/29/15   Page 17 of 28\n \n1  benefit by California law.  Plaintiffs JASON SLUSHER, ROBIN SLUSHER and BENNY \n2 \nSLUSHER had the right to familial relationships with Kayleigh.  Among other sources, these rights \n3 \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments derive from statutory mandates as created by California \n4 \nlaw.  Investigation and/or reporting of child abuse and/or neglect is mandatory under the California \n5 \nChild Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Penal Code ยง 11164 et seq., Welfare and Institutions Code \n6 \nยงยง 10550, 10553, 10554, and 10651, and is intended by law for the benefit and protection of \n7 \n8  children such as Kayleigh Slusher.  Such investigation and/or reporting is mandatory, ministerial, \n9  and is not discretionary under the CANRA.  Defendants unreasonably and unjustifiably violated \n10 \ntheir mandatory duties to investigate and/or report the abuse and/or neglect suffered by Kayleigh \n11 \nSlusher, despite Plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional entitlement to investigation and/or reporting \n12 \nunder California law.  Defendants violated Plaintiffs' rights under the First and Fourteenth \n13 \nAmendments by failing to respond to, investigate and/or report child abuse and neglect as mandated \n14 \nby the CANRA.  As a direct result of Defendants' conduct, including conduct that increased the risk \n15 \n16  of harm to Kayleigh Slusher, and Defendantsโ failure to investigate and/or report child abuse and/or \n17  neglect as required by the United States Constitution and California law, Plaintiff Kayleigh Slusher \n18 \nsuffered loss of life and liberty, and Plaintiffs JASON SLUSHER, ROBIN SLUSHER and BENNY \n19 \nSLUSHER suffered loss of their familial relationships with their daughter/granddaughter, including \n20 \nloss of love, companionship, comfort, affection, society, services, solace, and moral support.     \n21 \n  56.  At all material times, and alternatively, the actions and omissions of each Defendant \n22 \nwere intentional, wanton and/or willful, conscience shocking, reckless, malicious, deliberately \n23 \n24  indifferent to Plaintiffsโ rights, done with actual malice, grossly negligent, negligent, and \n25 \nobjectively unreasonable. \n26 \n  57.

FACTUAL SUMMARY \n16  On May 3, 2010, Kaleigh was born to Sara and Jason.  FAC ยถ 26.  For over a year, \n17  Kaleigh and her mother lived with Jasonโs parents, Robin and Benny.  Id. ยถ 27.3  Sara \n18  eventually moved to her own apartment with Kayleigh.  Id.  Though no longer living with \n19  her grandparents, Kayleigh saw them regularly and often had weekend sleepovers at their \n20  home.  Id. ยถ 29. \n21  Around October 2013, Saraโs boyfriend, Ryan, a โcrankโ (methamphetamine) addict \n22  with an outstanding arrest warrant, moved into Saraโs apartment and began preventing the \n23  grandparents from seeing Kaleigh.  Id. ยถยถ 30-31.  The grandparents suspected that Sara and \n24  Ryan were engaging in illegal drug activity and placing Kayleigh at serious risk of harm.  \n25                                                   \n2 The City, Chief Melton and Officers Wade and Deguilo are referred to collectively \n26  as the โCity Defendants,โ while the County and CWS workers Diaz-Lara and Lefler-Panela \nare collectively referred to as the โCounty Defendants.โ \n27 \n3 During this time, Jason was in prison for a crime unrelated to his relationship with \n28  Kaleigh.  Id.   \n- 2 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 3 of 22\n \n1  Id.  NPD police officers were summoned to Saraโs apartment in October 2013 and January \n2  2014 regarding disturbances there, but took no action.  Id. ยถ 32.   \n3  By January 2014, the grandparents had become increasingly concerned about \n4  Kayleigh, whom they had not seen or had contact with since Thanksgiving.  Id. ยถยถ 33, 50.  \n5  On January 23, 2014, Robin called the NPD to request a welfare check on Kayleigh.  Id. \n6  ยถ 33.  She expressed concern that Kayleigh was under the care of drug addicts, that Ryan \n7  had an outstanding warrant and was armed, and that Kayleigh was being mistreated and \n8  abused.  Id.  Officer Wade responded to the call, but concluded that the situation was \n9  unsafe for him and his partner.  Id.  He did not to call for back up or investigate the report \n10  of suspected child abuse and neglect, and simply cleared the call.  Id.4    \n11  Also on January 23, 2014, Robin made numerous attempts to contact CWS social \n12  workers Diaz-Lara and Lefler-Panela to report her concerns regarding Kayleighโs safety \n13  and well-being.  Id. ยถ 40.  Lefler-Panela later returned Robinโs call, informing her that there \n14  was nothing CWS could do and to call the police instead.  Id. ยถ 41. \n15  On January 29, 2014, at around 5:58 p.m., Robin, fearing that Kayleigh was in grave \n16  danger, again contacted NPD for assistance.   Id. ยถ 50.  At around 8:47 p.m., Officers Wade \n17  and Deguilio went to Saraโs residence.  Id. ยถ 51.  Sara โactively tried to conceal the inside \n18  of her home from [them] by closing the front door against her body and peeking her head \n19  out to talk to them.โ  Id.  Sara brought Kayleigh to the front door.  Id.  The officers \n20  observed that Kayleigh had bruises on her face, appeared gaunt, sick, malnourished and \n21  distressed.  Id.  The officers also encountered Saraโs boyfriend, Ryan, who falsely \n22  identified himself as โRyan Howard.โ  Id.  Ryan appeared malnourished, with sunken \n23  cheekbones, and to be under the influence of narcotics.  Id.  After the officers entered the \n24  apartment, Kayleigh vomited in front of them, and was quickly taken to the bathroom by \n25  Sara.  Id.  They also saw a male whom they knew was on probation attempt to depart from \n26                                                   \n4 A few days later on the morning of January 27, 2014, unspecified NPD officers \n27  were again dispatched to Kaleighโs home due to a neighborโs report of a domestic \ndisturbance.  Id. ยถ 38.  The officers never made any report of child abuse and/or neglect to \n28  CWS or any other authority.  Id. ยถ 38.   \n- 3 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 4 of 22\n \n1  the premises.  Id.  Sara asked the officers to leave.  Id.  The officers complied, without \n2  making any effort to speak with Kayleigh or physically examine her.  Id.   \n3  After the visit, Officers Wade and Deguillo determined that the person who \n4  identified himself in the apartment as โRyan Howardโ had lied about his identity and, in \n5  fact, was Ryan Warner.  Id. ยถ 51.  They also confirmed that Ryan had an active, outstanding \n6  arrest warrant.  Id.  Despite this realization and their observations at the apartment, the \n7  officers made no effort to obtain a warrant to re-enter the apartment or arrest him.  Instead, \n8  Officer Wade called Robin and told her that Kayleigh had food and that everything \n9  appeared normal at the home.  Id.  Defendant Wade also reassured Robin that he would \n10  โkeep an eye on the apartment.โ  Id. ยถ 55.  Had Defendants investigated further, they would \n11  have discovered that Ryan had an extensive criminal history, which included, without \n12  limitation, assault and possession of drugs.  Id. ยถ 52.  Ryan also had a restraining order \n13  entered against him for threatening to kill his pregnant ex-girlfriend, among making other \n14  extremely sadistic and violent threats.  Id. ยถ 56.   \n15  On or about February 1, 2014, NPD police officers responded to a call to perform \n16  another welfare check on Kayleigh.  Id. ยถ 57.  When the officers arrived at Saraโs \n17  apartment, they discovered Kaleigh lying deceased in her bed, with evidence of having \n18  suffered severe physical abuse.  Id.  The Napa County District Attorney later reported that \n19  Kaleigh died from multiple blunt force trauma with impact injuries to her head, torso and \n20  extremities.  Id. ยถ 57.  Sara and Ryan have been charged with Kaleighโs murder.  Id.   \n21  B.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n22  On May 29, 2015, Plaintiffs filed the instant action in this Court and subsequently \n23  filed a FAC on July 1, 2015.  The FAC alleges the following claims:  (1) violation of due \n24  process, mandatory reporting requirements, and interference with familial relations, \n25  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; (2) Monell liability; (3) violation of the Bane Act, Cal. Civ. \n26  Code ยง 52.1; and (4) negligence/negligence per se.  The County Defendants and City \n27  Defendants have separately filed motions to dismiss all claims alleged in the FAC.  The \n28  motions are fully briefed and ripe for adjudication. \n- 4 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 5 of 22\n \n1  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n2  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) โtests the legal sufficiency of a claim.โ  \n3  Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001).  โDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \n4  proper when the complaint either (1) lacks a cognizable legal theory or (2) fails to allege \n5  sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.โ  Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, \n6  959 (9th Cir. 2013).  โRule 12(b)(6) is read in conjunction with Rule 8(a), which requires \n7  not only โfair notice of the nature of the claim, but also grounds on which the claim rests.โโ  \n8  Zixiang Li v. Kerry, 710 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting in part Bell Atl. Corp. \n9  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 n.3 (2007)).  โTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \n10  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to relief that is \n11  plausible on its face.โ โ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 \n12  U.S. at 570 (2007)).   \n13  In assessing the sufficiency of the pleadings, โcourts must consider the complaint in \n14  its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) \n15  motions to dismiss, in particular, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, \n16  and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.โ  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & \n17  Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322 (2007).  The court is to โaccept all factual allegations in the \n18  complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \n19  party.โ  Outdoor Media Group, Inc. v. City of Beaumont, 506 F.3d 895, 899-900 (9th Cir. \n20  2007).  Where a complaint or claim is dismissed, leave to amend generally is granted, \n21  unless further amendment would be futile.  Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.,  \n22  656 F.3d 1034, 1041 (9th Cir. 2011). \n23  III.  DISCUSSION \n24  A.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n25  Plaintiffsโ first claim for relief under ยง 1983 for denial of due process and \n26  interference with familial relations is directed against Officers Wade and Deguilo and CWS \n27  workers Diaz-Lara and Lefler Panela.  Section 1983 provides that individuals may sue \n28  government officials who violate their civil rights while acting โunder color of any statute, \n- 5 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 6 of 22\n \n1  ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  To maintain a \n2  claim pursuant to ยง 1983, a plaintiff must establish:  (1) the deprivation of any rights, \n3  privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or federal law, (2) by a person acting \n4  under the color of state law.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988); Nurre v. \n5  Whitehead, 580 F.3d 1087, 1092 (9th Cir. 2009).  In addition, defendantโs actions must \n6  both actually and proximately cause the deprivation of a federally protected right.  Lemire \n7  v. Caifornia Depโt of Corrections & Rehabilitation, 726 F.3d 1062, 1074 (9th Cir. 2013).  \n8  Section 1983 is not itself a source of substantive rights, but a jurisdictional vehicle for \n9  vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.  See Thornton v. City of St. Helens, 425 \n10  F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).  \n11  1.  Due Process \n12  โThe Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from โdepriv[ing] any person of life, \n13  liberty, or property, without due process of law.โโ  Newman v. Sathyavaglswaran, 287 F.3d \n14  786, 789 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ยง 1).  The Due Process Clause \n15  encompasses two types of protections:  procedural fairness (procedural due process) and \n16  substantive rights (substantive due process).  Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125-28 \n17  (1990).  A procedural due process claim challenges the procedures used in effecting a \n18  deprivation, whereas a substantive due process claim challenges the governmental action \n19  itself.  See Brittain v. Hansen, 451 F.3d 982, 991 (9th Cir. 2006).   \n20  Here, the gist of Plaintiffsโ due process claim is that Defendants violated their \n21  mandatory duties to investigate and report child abuse, which, in turn, led to Kayleighโs \n22  murder.  FAC ยถยถ 64-66.  Although the pleadings do not specify whether the due process \n23  claim is based on substantive or procedural due process, Plaintiffs state in their opposition \n24  that they are proceeding on both legal theories. \n25  a)  Substantive Due Process \n26  Generally, โa Stateโs failure to protect an individual against private violence simply \n27  does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.โ  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. \n28  Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 196 (1989) (holding that a social services agency and \n- 6 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 7 of 22\n \n1  social workers did not violate a child victimโs substantive due process rights by failing to \n2  protect him from his abusive father, notwithstanding significant evidence establishing that \n3  the child was subjected to beatings).  โThere are two exceptions to this rule:  (1) when a \n4  โspecial relationshipโ exists between the plaintiff and the state (the special-relationship \n5  exception) . . . ; and (2) when the state affirmatively places the plaintiff in danger by acting \n6  with โdeliberate  indifferenceโ to a โknown or obvious dangerโ (the state-created danger \n7  exception) . . . .โ  Patel v. Kent School Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971-72 (9th Cir. 2011) \n8  (citations omitted).  Plaintiffs rely on the state-created danger exception, sometimes simply \n9  referred to as the โdanger creationโ exception.  Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, 439 F.3d \n10  1055, 1062 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197). \n11  โ[A] police officerโs conduct that affirmatively places a plaintiff in a position of \n12  danger deprives him or her of a substantive due process right.โ  Johnson v. City of Seattle, \n13  474 F.3d 634, 639 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 589-90 (9th \n14  Cir. 1989)).  โTo determine whether an official affirmatively placed an individual in \n15  danger, we ask: (1) whether any affirmative actions of the official placed the individual in \n16  danger he otherwise would not have faced; (2) whether the danger was known or obvious; \n17  and (3) whether the officer acted with deliberate indifference to that danger.โ  Henry A. v. \n18  Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012).     \n19  For example, in Wood, a trooper stopped a car in which the plaintiff was a \n20  passenger, arrested the driver for drunk driving, and left the plaintiff in a high crime area at \n21  2:30 a.m.  The plaintiff later accepted a ride from a stranger and was raped.  The Ninth \n22  Circuit reversed a summary judgment ruling in favor of the trooper, finding that there was \n23  โa factual dispute regarding whether [the trooper] deprived her of a liberty interest \n24  protected by the Constitution by affirmatively placing her in danger and then abandoning \n25  her.โ  Id. at 596.  Similarly, in Maxwell v. County of San Diego, 708 F.3d 1075 (9th Cir. \n26  2013), the court found that the police officers affirmatively increased the danger to an \n27  individual who had been shot and later died by preventing her ambulance from leaving the \n28  scene.  Id. at 1082.  The court explained that the delay left the victim โworse off than if the \n- 7 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 8 of 22\n \n1  ambulance had been allowed to bring her to an air ambulance that had advanced medical \n2  capabilities and was ready to fly her to a trauma center.โ  Id. \n3  Plaintiffs argue that the Ninth Circuitโs decision in Kennedy, in particular, supports \n4  the application of the danger creation exception.  In Kennedy, the plaintiff, the mother of a \n5  nine year-old girl, reported to the police that a thirteen year-old neighbor had molested her \n6  daughter.  In response to the motherโs concern regarding the neighborโs history of violence, \n7  the officer told her that she would be given notice prior to any police contact with the \n8  neighborโs family regarding her allegations.  Kennedy, 439 F.2d at 1058.  Despite those \n9  assurances, the police officer, without first notifying the mother, informed the neighbor and \n10  his mother of the plaintiffโs claim of molestation.  When the plaintiff learned of this, she \n11  asked the officer why he had contacted the neighbor without first notifying her, and \n12  expressed serious concerns for her safety.  In response, the officer โassured [the plaintiff] \n13  that the police would patrol the area around both her house and the [neighborโs] house that \n14  night to keep an eye on [him].โ  Id.  Due to the late hour and the officerโs promise to patrol \n15  the neighborhood, the plaintiff and her husband decided to stay at their house.  Id.  The \n16  following morning, the neighbor broke into the plaintiffโs home and shot her and her \n17  husband, killing him, as they slept.  Id.  In upholding the denial of qualified immunity for \n18  the officer, the Ninth Circuit held that the officer โaffirmatively created a danger to [the \n19  plaintiff] she otherwise would not have faced, i.e., that [the neighbor] would be notified of \n20  the allegations before the [parents] had the opportunity to protect themselves from his \n21  violent response to the news.โ  Id. \n22  Plaintiffs contend that Defendantsโ failure to investigate and report on the suspected \n23  abuse of Kayleigh, in tandem with Officer Wadeโs โfalseโ assurance that โeverything \n24  appeared normalโ at Kayleighโs home and that he would โkeep an eye on the apartment,  \n25  affirmatively increased the risk of harm to Kayleigh.  Pls.โ Oppโn at City Defs.โ Mot. to \n26  Dismiss at 9-10.  The Court disagrees.  In Kennedy, the affirmative danger created by the \n27  officer was his informing the neighbor of the plaintiffโs accusations before she and her \n28  husband could protect themselves against the neighborโs violent responseโcoupled with \n- 8 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 9 of 22\n \n1  his assurance to monitor the defendant.  439 F.3d at 1058.  Here, the risk to Kayleigh was \n2  the fact that she lived with adults who were abusive.  While Defendants were allegedly \n3  derelict in their failure to extricate Kayleigh from that situation, no facts are alleged that \n4  suggest that they placed her in danger or affirmatively increased the risk of harm to her \n5  through their inaction.  Despite Plaintiffsโ intimations to the contrary, Kennedy does not \n6  support the proposition that false assurances by a law enforcement officer, standing alone, \n7  can affirmatively create a danger.  439 F.3d at 1063.  To the contrary, the court simply \n8  explained that such misrepresentations can constitute โan additional and aggravating factor, \n9  making [the plaintiff] more vulnerable to the danger he had already created.โ  Id. \n10  Construing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the pleadings, at most, \n11  demonstrate that Defendants knew or had reason to know that Kayleigh was at serious risk \n12  of harm.  Absent from the pleadings are any facts demonstrating that Defendants \n13  affirmatively placed Kayleigh in a position that increased such risk.  See DeShaney, 489 \n14  U.S. at 201 (โWhile the State may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the \n15  free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more \n16  vulnerable to them.โ).  As such, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim \n17  based on the denial of the right to substantive due process.  The foregoing notwithstanding, \n18  it is possible that Plaintiffs will be able to rectify these deficiencies through the presentation \n19  of additional facts.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend their substantive due \n20  process claim. \n21  b)  Procedural Due Process \n22  The procedural due process component of the Fourteenth Amendment protects \n23  individuals against the deprivation of liberty or property by the government without due \n24  process.  Portman v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).  โState law \n25  can create a right that the Due Process Clause will protect only if the state law contains \n26  โ(1) substantive predicates governing official decisionmaking, and (2) explicitly mandatory \n27  language specifying the outcome that must be reached if the substantive predicates have \n28 \n- 9 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 10 of 22\n \n1  been met.โโ  James v. Rowlands, 606 F.3d 646, 656 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Bonin v. \n2  Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 842 (9th Cir. 1995)). \n3  According to the FAC, Plaintiffsโ protected property interest arises principally from \n4  the mandatory child abuse reporting requirements set forth in the California Child Abuse \n5  and Neglect Reporting Act (โCANRAโ), Cal. Pen. Code ยงยง 11164-11174.4.  FAC ยถ 64.  \n6  Among other things, CANRA provides that specified โmandated reporters,โ which include \n7  social workers and police officers, โshall make a report to an agency specified in Section \n8  11165.9 whenever the mandated reporter, in his or her professional capacity or within the \n9  scope of his or her employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated \n10  reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect.โ  Cal. \n11  Pen. Code ยง 11166(a) (emphasis added); see also id. ยง 11165.7(a) (list of โmandated \n12  reportersโ).  California courts have construed this provision as imposing โtwo mandatory \n13  dutiesโ on a mandated reporter who receives an account of child abuse:  (1) the duty to \n14  investigate; and (2) the duty to file a report of child abuse when an objectively reasonable \n15  person in the same situation would suspect abuse.  Alejo v. City of Alhambra, 75 \n16  Cal.App.4th 1180, 1186 (1999).5  A violation of section 11166โs duties constitutes a \n17  misdemeanor offense.  Cal. Pen. Code ยง 11166(c). \n18  The County Defendants contend that CANRA only creates a discretionary as \n19  opposed to a mandatory duty and therefore fails to provide any โsubstantive predicates to \n20  decision-making.โ  County Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss at 6.  They posit that since the reporting \n21  obligation is triggered only upon a โreasonable suspicionโ of child abuse, a mandated \n22  reporter inherently must use discretion in determining whether to make a report of \n23  suspected child abuse in the first instance.  Id.  These contentions are uncompelling.  The \n24  plain language of the statute clearly states that a โmandated reporter shall make a reportโ to \n25  CPS, police, or other law enforcement agency upon a reasonable suspicion of child abuse or \n26 \n                                                 \n27  5 The Alejo court noted that while the duty to investigate is not express, it is clearly \nenvisioned by the statute so the officer can determine whether there is a reasonable \n28  suspicion of child abuse. 75 Cal.App.4th at 1186. \n- 10 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 11 of 22\n \n1  neglect.  Cal. Pen. Code ยง 11166(a) (emphasis added).  As noted, California courts have \n2  construed this obligation as a โmandatoryโ one.  Alejo, 75 Cal.App.4th at 1185-86; see also \n3  Tarrant Bell Property, LLC v. Superior Court, 51 Cal.4th 538, 542 (2011) (noting that the \n4  Legislatureโs use of the word โshallโ denotes a mandatory act).  Defendantsโ assertion that \n5  no mandatory duty is imposed under CANRA also is undermined by the fact that the statute \n6  explicitly requires that a mandated reporter apply an objective standard in determining \n7  whether there is reasonable suspicion a child has been abused or neglected.  Cal. Pen. Code \n8  ยง 11166(a)(1); see Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983) (โIf the decisionmaker is \n9  not โrequired to base its decisions on objective and defined criteria,โ but instead โcan deny \n10  the requested relief for any constitutionally permissible reason or for no reason at all,โ the \n11  State has not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest.โ) (citations omitted). \n12  Having concluded above that CANRA provides โsubstantive predicatesโ to guide the \n13  decisionmaker, the question becomes whether it also contains โโexplicitly mandatory \n14  language,โ i.e., specific directives to the decisionmaker that if the regulationsโ substantive \n15  predicates are present, a particular outcome must follow . . . .โ  Kentucky Dept. of \n16  Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 463 (1989).  In Thompson, the Supreme Court \n17  considered whether prison regulations governing visitation could give rise to a protected \n18  liberty interest.  The Court found that while the regulations โdo provide certain โsubstantive \n19  predicatesโ to guide the decisionmaker,โ they โlack the requisite relevant mandatory \n20  languageโ because โ[t]hey stop short of requiring that a particular result is to be reached \n21  upon a finding that the substantive predicates are met.โ  Id. at 463-64.  In particular, the \n22  procedures at issue granted administrative staff discretion whether to allow or disallow \n23  visits, such that the โoverall effect of the regulations is not such that an inmate can \n24  reasonably form an objective expectation that a visit would necessarily be allowed absent \n25  the occurrence of one of the listed conditions.โ  Id. \n26  The County Defendants assert that CANRA and the other statutes and regulations \n27  cited by Plaintiffs contain no mandatory language specifying the particular outcome that \n28  must be reached if the substantive predicates have been met.  More specifically, they assert \n- 11 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 12 of 22\n \n1  that โthe statutes [cited by Plaintiffs] articulate the procedure for evaluation, reporting and \n2  investigation; [however,] the substantive outcome as the report of Robin Slusher or other \n3  report is left open to the discretionary decisions of CWS personnel.โ  County Defs.โ Mot. to \n4  Dismiss at 6-7.  For their part, Plaintiffs do not respond to Defendantsโ argument or \n5  otherwise address that contention.  As for the pleadings, they do not allege that any of the \n6  cited authority mandates a particular outcomeโor what that outcome would be.  See FAC \n7  ยถ 64.  In the absence of such allegations, coupled with Plaintiffs failure to address this issue \n8  in their opposition, the Court cannot conclude at this juncture that Plaintiffs have alleged a \n9  plausible claim for procedural due process.  Since Plaintiffs may be able to rectify this \n10  deficiency, the Court dismisses this claim with leave to amend. \n11  2.  Familial Association \n12  The Fourteenth Amendment protects the liberty interest in familial companionship \n13  and association against unwarranted governmental interference.  See Wilkinson v. \n14  Torres, 610 F.3d 546, 554 (9th Cir. 2010); Crowe v. Cnty. of San Diego, 608 F.3d 406, 441 \n15  & n. 23 (9th Cir. 2010).  The liberty interest in familial companionship encompasses the \n16  familial relationship between parents and children.  Curnow By and Through Curnow v. \n17  Ridgecrest Police, 952 F.2d 321, 325 (9th Cir. 1991).  โMoreover, the First Amendment \n18  protects those relationships, including family relationships, that presuppose deep \n19  attachments and commitments to the necessarily few other individuals with whom one \n20  shares not only a special community of thoughts, experiences, and beliefs but also \n21  distinctively personal aspects of oneโs life.โ  Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 685 \n22  (9th Cir. 2001). \n23  Defendants contend that Plaintiffsโ familial association claim must be dismissed \n24  because the pleadings fail to demonstrate an underlying constitutional violation.  Though it \n25  has not addressed this issue directly, the Ninth Circuit has intimated that an underlying due \n26  process violation is a prerequisite to a claim for denial of familial association claim based \n27  on the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e.g., Lee, 250 F.3d at 685 (โ[T]he stateโs interference \n28  with [the right of familial association] without due process of law is remediable under 42 \n- 12 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 13 of 22\n \n1  U.S.C. ยง 1983.โ) (internal quotations omitted, emphasis added); accord McClurg v. \n2  Maricopa Cnty., No. CIV-09-1684-PHX-MHB, 2012 WL 3655318, at *9 (D. Ariz. Aug. \n3  27, 2012) (โ[T]he right to familial association can only be violated if there is an underlying \n4  due process violation.โ).   \n5  Plaintiffs fail to respond directly to Defendantsโ argument, and instead points out \n6  that in Lee the Ninth Circuit recognized that a familial association claim may also be \n7  predicated on the First Amendment.  Neither of the moving or reply memoranda filed by \n8  either set of Defendants addresses Plaintiffsโ familial association claim in that context.  The \n9  Court notes that there appears to be no controlling case law regarding the legal standard for \n10  stating a familial association claim under the First Amendment.  See Schwartz v. Lassen \n11  Cnty., No. 2:10-CV-03048-MCE), 2013 WL 5375588, at *10 (E.D. Cal., Sept. 24, 2013) \n12  (โ[T]he contours of a First Amendment familial association claim are unclear, and indeed \n13  the Court is aware of no Ninth Circuit case setting out specifically the conduct or elements \n14  that constitute violation of familial association under the First Amendment.โ).  Given the \n15  paucity of authority, along with Defendantsโ failure to meaningfully address this issue, the \n16  Court declines to dismiss Plaintiffโs familial association claim insofar as it is predicated on \n17  the First Amendment.  See Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Wash., 350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir. \n18  2003) (โIt is [the movantโs] burden . . . to present the court with legal arguments to support \n19  its claims.โ).6 \n20  3.  Monell Liability \n21  Plaintiffsโ second claim for municipal and supervisorial liability is alleged against \n22  the County, the City and Chief Melton.  โIn order to establish liability for governmental \n23  entities under Monell, a plaintiff must prove โ(1) that [the plaintiff] possessed a \n24  constitutional right of which [s]he was deprived; (2) that the municipality had a policy; \n25  (3) that this policy amounts to deliberate indifference to the plaintiffโs constitutional right; \n26                                                   \n6 In view of the Courtโs ruling on Plaintiffsโ due process claims, Plaintiffs ability to \n27  proceed on a familial association claim based on the Fourteenth Amendment is dependent \nupon their ability to rectify the deficiencies discussed above in connection with those \n28  claims. \n- 13 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 14 of 22\n \n1  and, (4) that the policy is the moving force behind the constitutional violation.โโ  Dougherty \n2  v. City of Covina, 654 F.3d 892, 900 (9th Cir. 2011) (alterations in original).   \n3  A Monell claim may take one of three forms:  (1) โwhen implementation of its \n4  official policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injuryโ; (2) when \n5  omissions or failures to act amount to a local government policy of โdeliberate \n6  indifferenceโ to constitutional rights7; or (3) when a local government official with final \n7  policy-making authority ratifies a subordinateโs unconstitutional conduct.  Clouthier v. \n8  Cnty. of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1249-50 (9th Cir. 2010).  To state a claim, the \n9  pleadings need only โcontain sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice \n10  and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively.โ  AE ex rel. Hernandez v. \n11  Cnty. of Tulare, 666 F.3d 631, 637 (9th Cir. 2012) (addressing the pleading requirements \n12  applicable to a Monell claim).  In addition, the facts alleged must โplausibly suggest an \n13  entitlement to relief, such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected \n14  to the expense of discovery and continued litigation.โ  Id.  Here, Plaintiffs seek to state a \n15  claim under each of three aforementioned theories of liability; to wit, the existence of a \n16  policy or custom, ratification and failure to train.   \n17  a)  Policy or Custom \n18  Defendants first contend that Plaintiffsโ allegations regarding the existence of a \n19  policy or custom are too vague and non-specific to state a claim.  The Court partially agrees \n20  with Defendantsโ assertion.  Although the pleadings specifically identify the various \n21  policies or customs allegedly implicated in the constitutional injury alleged suffered by \n22  Plaintiffs,  see FAC ยถ 70(a)-(f), they fail to distinguish between the acts or omissions of the \n23  County, City and Chief Melton.  Instead, Plaintiffs inappropriately allege a variety of \n24  policies which they attribute generally to these Defendants.  See Connick v. Thompson, โ \n25  U.S. โ, โ, 131 S.Ct. 1350, 1359 (2011) (โ[U]nder ยง 1983, local governments are responsible \n26                                                   \n7 An actionable policy can โbe one of action or inaction.โ  Waggy v. Spokane \n27  County Wash., 594 F.3d 707, 713 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. \n378, 388 (1989) (internal quotations omitted).  โ[A] municipalityโs failure to train its \n28  employees is one such claim of omission or inaction by the municipality.โ  Id. \n- 14 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 15 of 22\n \n1  only for โtheir own illegal acts.โ).  Because the pleadings fail to give each of the Defendants \n2  particular fair notice of the particular policies attributed to them, Plaintiffsโ policy and \n3  custom claim is dismissed with leave to amend.8 \n4  b)  Ratification \n5  โA municipality . . . can be liable for an isolated constitutional violation if the final \n6  policymaker โratifiedโ a subordinateโs actions.โ  Christie v. Iopa, 176 F.3d 1231, 1239 (9th \n7  Cir. 1999); see also Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342, 1346-47 (9th Cir. 1992) (noting \n8  than an โofficial with final policy-making authorityโ may be liable for ratifying a \n9  subordinateโs unconstitutional conduct).  โTo show ratification, a plaintiff must show that \n10  the โauthorized policymakers approve a subordinateโs decision and the basis for it.โโ  Lytle \n11  v. Carl, 382 F.3d 978, 987 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  The plaintiff must establish \n12  that the ratification was a โconscious, affirmative choice.โ  Clouthier, 591 F.3d at 1250.  A \n13  mere failure to overrule a subordinateโs actions, without more, is insufficient to support a \n14  ยง 1983 claim.  Lytle, 382 F.3d at 987. \n15  The FAC alleges that the County, City and Chief Melton โapproved, tolerated and/or \n16  ratifiedโ the acts and omissions of officers with the NPD and CWS, notwithstanding their \n17  โdirect knowledge of the facts of this incident.โ  FAC ยถ 72.  However, no facts are alleged \n18  to support this conclusory assertion.  There are no allegations specifying the particular \n19  actions at issue or how and by whom they were ratified.  Since it is possible that these \n20  deficiencies can be cured with additional factual allegations, the Court dismisses the claim \n21  with leave to amend. \n22  c)  Failure to Train \n23  โ[T]he inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for ยง 1983 liability only \n24  where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with \n25                                                   \n8 The City Defendants contend Plaintiffsโ Monell claim must be dismissed based on \n26  their failure to allege an underlying constitutional violation.  It is true that there can be no \nMonell liability without an underlying constitutional violation.  Scott v. Henrich, 39 F.3d \n27  912, 916 (9th Cir. 1994).  Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ ability to proceed on a Monell claim \nbased on an underlying due process violation is contingent on whether they are able to state \n28  a plausible due process violation. \n- 15 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 16 of 22\n \n1  whom the police come into contact.โ  City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989).  \n2  To state a claim for insufficient training, plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to show that \n3  the County, City and Chief Melton โdisregarded the known or obvious consequence that a \n4  particular omission in their training program would cause [the individual defendants] to \n5  violate citizensโ constitutional rights.โ  Flores v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 758 F.3d 1154, \n6  1159 (9th Cir. 2014). \n7  With respect to the failure to train, the pleadings allege that the City, County and \n8  Chief Melton โfailed to properly hire, train, instruct, monitor, supervise, evaluate, \n9  investigate, and discipline Defendants, with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffsโ \n10  constitutional rights, which were thereby violated as described above.โ  FAC ยถ 71.  This \n11  conclusory allegation, without more, is insufficient to state a claim for failure to train.  See \n12  Flores, 758 F.3d at 1159.  Plaintiffsโ failure to train claim is dismissed with leave to amend. \n13  d)  Chief Melton \n14  Chief Melton is named as a party-defendant in both his official and individual \n15  capacities.  Official capacity claims against an individual are the functional equivalent of a \n16  suit against the entity of which he is an agent.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159 (1985).  \n17  Since Chief Melton is alleged to be an agent of the City, the official capacity claims alleged \n18  against him are dismissed as duplicative.  See Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. Los \n19  Angeles Cnty Sheriff Dept., 533 F.3d 780, 799 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding that a county \n20  sheriff sued in โofficial capacityโ is a redundant defendant and should be dismissed when \n21  the county is also named).   \n22  To state an individual capacity claim against Chief Melton, Plaintiffs must allege \n23  facts showing that he โwas personally involved in the constitutional deprivation or a \n24  sufficient causal connection exists between the supervisorโs unlawful conduct and the \n25  constitutional violation.โ  Edgerly v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco, 599 F.3d 946, 961 \n26  (9th Cir. 2010); e.g., Hydrick v. Hunter, 669 F.3d 937, 941-42 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that \n27  to state an individual capacity claim, the complaint must identify the specific conduct that \n28  forms the basis of the claim against the individual defendant).  Because such facts are not \n- 16 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 17 of 22\n \n1  pled, the individual capacity claims against Chief Melton are dismissed with leave to \n2  amend.     \n3  4.  Qualified Immunity \n4  Defendants contend, in the alternative, that they are entitled to qualified immunity \n5  with respect to Plaintiffsโ federal claims.  โThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects \n6  government officials โfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not \n7  violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person \n8  would have known.โโ  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. \n9  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  When presented with a qualified immunity defense, \n10  the court considers: (1) whether the facts alleged, taken in the light most favorable to the \n11  plaintiff, demonstrate that the defendantโs conduct violated a statutory or constitutional \n12  right; and (2) whether the right at issue was โclearly established.โ  Saucier v. Katz, 533 \n13  U.S. 194, 201 (2001). \n14  In view of the dismissal of Plaintiffsโ due process claims with leave to amend, it is \n15  unnecessary at this juncture to determine whether those claims are precluded by the \n16  doctrine of qualified immunity.  As for Plaintiffsโ remaining First Amendment-based \n17  familial association claim, Defendants fail to discuss that claim specifically.  Accordingly, \n18  the Defendantsโ motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is denied at this time. \n19  B.  STATE LAW CLAMS \n20  1.  Bane Act \n21  Jason, as Kayleighโs successor-in-interest, asserts a survival claim under Californiaโs \n22  Bane Act, which provides that a person โwhose exercise or enjoymentโ of constitutional \n23  rights has been interfered with โby threats, intimidation, or coercionโ may bring a civil \n24  action for damages and injunctive relief.  Cal. Civ. Code ยง 52.1. โThe essence of a Bane \n25  Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper means (i.e., โthreats, intimidation \n26  or coercionโ), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from doing something he or she had the \n27  right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not \n28 \n- 17 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 18 of 22\n \n1  required to do under the law.โ  Austin B. v. Escondido Union Sch. Dist., 149 Cal.App. 4th \n2  860, 883 (2007) (citing Jones v. Kmart Corp., 17 Cal.4th 329, 334 (1998)).    \n3  Defendants argue that Plaintiffโs Bane Act claim should be dismissed because such a \n4  claim is personal to the victim and does not survive her death.9  As support, Defendants cite \n5  Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. v. Superior Court, 38 Cal.App.4th 141 (1995), which held \n6  that the parents of a child victim could not bring a wrongful death claim under the Bane Act \n7  because the statute only provides for โa personal cause of action for the victim[.]โ  Id. at \n8  144.  Notably, the court did not address or preclude a survival claim.  Here, Jason does not \n9  allege a Bane Act claim for injuries he sustained.  Rather, Jason seeks to vindicate rights \n10  personal to Kayleigh in the form of a survival claim under California Code of Civil \n11  Procedure ยง 377.20.  Courts within this District have concluded that such a claim is \n12  permissible.  See M.H. v. Cnty. of Alameda, 62 F.Supp.3d 1049, 1096 (N.D. Cal. 2014) \n13  (โA survival Bane Act claim, unlike a wrongful death Bane Act claim, is permissible.โ); \n14  accord Medrano v. Kern Cnty. Sheriffโs Officer, 921 F.Supp.2d 1009, 1016 (E.D. Cal. \n15  2013); Dela Torre v. City of Salinas, No. 09-cv-00626-RMW, 2010 WL 3743762, at *7 \n16  (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2010).10  The Court therefore rejects Defendantsโ contention that Jason \n17  lacks standing to bring a Bane Act claim. \n18  The above notwithstanding, the FAC fails to allege a plausible survival claim under \n19  the Bane Act.  To prevail on a Bane Act claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate, inter alia, \n20  โintimidation, threats or coercion.โ  Jones v. Kmart Corp., 17 Cal.4th 329, 334 (1998).  The \n21                                                   \n9 A survival action is a personal injury action that survives to permit a decedentโs \n22  estate to recover damages that would have been personally awarded to the decedent had he \nsurvived.  Cal. Civ. Pro.Code ยงยง 377.20, 377.30.  In contrast, a wrongful death action is an \n23  independent claim for damages personally suffered by a decedentโs heirs as a result of the \ndecedentโs death.  Id. ยง 377.60; see Davis v. Bender Shipbuilding & Repair Co., 27 F.3d \n24  426, 429 (9th Cir. 1994). \n25  10 Defendants cite Tolosko-Parker v. County of Sonoma, No. C 06-06841 CRB, \n2009 WL 498099, at *5 (N.D. Cal., Feb. 26, 2009) which concluded that the parents of the \n26  decedent could not bring a survival claim under the Bane Act.  The courtโs opinion offers \nno reasoning or analysis to support that conclusion, and merely cites Bay Area Rapid \n27  Transit District, which, as discussed, does not stand for that proposition a survival claim \ncannot be brought under the Bane Act.  The Court therefore finds Tolosko-Parker to be \n28  unpersuasive and declines to follow it. \n- 18 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 19 of 22\n \n1  FAC fails to allege such facts.  Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ third claim for relief is dismissed \n2  with leave to amend. \n3  2.  Negligence/Negligence Per Se \n4  Plaintiffsโ fourth and final claim for relief for negligence/negligence per se is \n5  brought against all Defendants.  โTo state a cause of action under the negligence per se \n6  doctrine, the plaintiff must plead four elements: (1) the defendant violated a statute or \n7  regulation, (2) the violation caused the plaintiffโs injury, (3) the injury resulted from the \n8  kind of occurrence the statute or regulation was designed to prevent, and (4) the plaintiff \n9  was a member of the class of persons the statute or regulation was intended to protect.โ  \n10  Alejo, 75 Cal.App.4th at 1184-85 (citing Cal. Evid. Code ยง 669); see Transamerica Title \n11  Ins. Co. v. Green, 11 Cal.App.3d 693, 702 (1970) (โThe breach of statutory duty is \n12  negligence per seโ).  At issue here are the duty and causation elements. \n13  Defendants contend that CANRA and the other statutes and regulations alleged in \n14  the FAC impose no mandatory duties on them, and by extension, cannot form the basis for \n15  a negligence per se claim.  Defendants further argue that, pursuant to California \n16  Government Code ยงยง 815.2 and 820.2, they are entitled to statutory immunity for \n17  discretionary acts.11  The California Court of Appeal in Alejo rejected virtually identical \n18  arguments.  In that case, the father of three year-old Alec Alejo (โAlecโ) had received \n19  reports from the motherโs friend and neighbor that the motherโs boyfriend was using drugs \n20  and physically abusing Alec.  Alejo, 75 Cal.App.4th at 1183.  The father reported the abuse \n21  to the local police department, which failed to conduct any investigation into Alecโs well-\n22  being.  Id.  Six weeks later, the motherโs boyfriend savagely beat Alec, causing him to \n23  suffer total and permanent disability.  Id.  The father, on behalf of Alec, filed suit against \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n26  11 Government Code ยง 820.2 provides that โa public employee is not liable for an \ninjury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the \n27  exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.โ  Section \n815.2 provides generally that a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act \n28  or omission of its employee if the employee himself is immune from liability. \n- 19 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 20 of 22\n \n1  the city and two police officers alleging that they were negligent in failing to investigate or \n2  report a reasonable suspicion of child abuse as mandated by CANRA.  Id. at 1183-84. \n3  The trial court sustained the cityโs demurrer on the grounds that its police \n4  department and officers had no special duty to protect a child from abuse, were immune \n5  from liability for discretionary conduct, and, in any event, their failure to act was not the \n6  cause of Alecโs injuries.  Id. at 1184.  The California Court of Appeal reversed, holding \n7  โthe duty to investigate and report child abuse is mandatory under [CANRA].โ  Id. at 1186.  \n8  In addition, the court found that โ[the officersโ] failure to investigate was clearly a breach \n9  of [that] duty,โ and therefore, the plaintiff could state a cause of action for negligence per se \n10  against the police officers.  Id. at 1189.  The court likewise rejected the cityโs claim of \n11  statutory immunity, concluding the immunity statutes do not bar liability for breach of a \n12  mandatory law enforcement duty.  Id. at 1194.  With regard to the issue of causation, the \n13  court concluded that the question of whether the defendantsโ alleged violation of their \n14  mandatory duty to investigate and report child abuse resulted in harm could not be decided \n15  at the pleading stage.  Id. at 1190-91. \n16  Despite the fact Alejo is directly on point and discussed extensively in Plaintiffsโ \n17  opposition briefs, Defendants offer no argument in rebuttal.  Instead, they contend that this \n18  case is controlled by Jacqueline T. v. Alameda County Child Protective Services, 155 \n19  Cal.App.4th 456 (2007), where the court rejected negligence and negligence per se claims \n20  brought against a county and two of its social workers who allegedly failed to adequately \n21  investigate reports of sexual abuse against several minors.  In that case, the plaintiff alleged \n22  that the defendants โbreached this mandatory duty [i.e., CANRA], not by failing to \n23  investigate the alleged abuse, but rather by failing to โreasonably and diligentlyโ investigate \n24  it.โ  Id. at 470.  In the instant case, however, Plaintiffs allege that the individual Defendants \n25  โfailed to investigate and/or report the abuse and neglectโ as required by California law.   \n26  FAC ยถ 37, 45, 54.  Thus, this case is more analogous to Alejo, which involved a complete \n27  abdication of their mandatory duty to investigate, as opposed to Jaqueline T., where the \n28  social workers conducted an investigation that was alleged to be inadequate.  See Ortega v. \n- 20 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 21 of 22\n \n1  Sacramento Cnty. Dept. of Health & Human Servs, 161 Cal.App.4th 713, 732 (2008) \n2  (distinguishing between a โfailure to investigate,โ which is โclearly a breachโ of the \n3  mandatory duty owed under Penal Code ยง 11166, and โa claim of inadequate \n4  investigation.โ) (emphasis added). \n5  The City Defendants separately argue that, like Jacqueline T., this is โnot a situation \n6  where officers performed no investigation.โ  City Defs.โ Mot. to Dismiss at 14.  They point \n7  out that in response to the reports of suspected child abuse, Officers Wade and Deguilo \n8  went to Kayleighโs home, but observed nothing that would have caused them to know or \n9  suspect that she was being abused.  Id.  This argument strains credulity.  Consistent with \n10  the information reported to them, the officers personally observed that Kayleigh had bruises \n11  on her face, โappeared gaunt, sick, malnourished, and distressed with dark circles under her \n12  eyes that her neighbors had recently noticed,โ and had vomited in front of them.  FAC ยถ 51.  \n13  The officers also observed a malnourished man with sunken cheek bones and obviously \n14  under the influence of drugs along with another suspicious individual known to be on \n15  probation attempting to flee the premises.  Id.  Despite these obvious signs of potential \n16  child abuse and neglect, the officers allegedly conducted no investigation.  Id.  Construing \n17  the facts alleged in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that โa reasonable \n18  person in [the officersโ] position would have suspected [child] abuse.โ  Alejo, 75 \n19  Cal.App.4th at 1186. \n20  Finally, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot show causation; to wit, that their \n21  failure to comply with their mandatory reporting and investigation duties resulted in harm.  \n22  In rejecting this argument, the court in Alejo explained that causation is a question for the \n23  finder of fact that cannot be resolved at the pleading stage.  75 Cal.App.4th at 1189 (โThe \n24  complaint in the case before us alleges that despite Hectorโs account of Alecโs abuse, \n25  Officer Doe performed no investigation and made no report and, as a result, Alec suffered \n26  further abuse. Therefore, the necessary linkage between the mandatory duty and the injury \n27  is established for pleading purposes.โ).  Defendantsโ reliance on Jacqueline T. is misplaced, \n28 \n- 21 - \n \n   \n\nCase 4:15-cv-02394-SBA   Document 45   Filed 12/11/15   Page 22 of 22\n \n1  as the issue of causation was decided on summary judgment, not at the pleading stage.  The \n2  Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for negligence/negligence per se. \n3  IV.  CONCLUSION \n4  For the reasons stated above, \n5  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:  \n6  1.  Defendantsโ respective motions to dismiss are GRANTED IN PART and \n7  DENIED IN PART.  The motions are GRANTED as to Plaintiffsโ first claim under 42 \n8  U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violation of due process, second claim under Monell and third claim for \n9  violation of the Bane Act, which are dismissed with leave to amend.  The motions to \n10  dismiss are DENIED in all other respects. \n11  2.  Plaintiffs shall file their Second Amended Complaint no later twenty-eight \n12  (28) days from the date this Order is entered into the docket.  Plaintiffs are hereby notified \n13  that any pleading filed in this Court is subject to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, and as \n14  such, they may amend only to the extent that they have a good faith basis for doing so. \n15  3.  This matter is REFERRED to Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu for a mandatory \n16  settlement conference to take place within ninety (90) days of the date this Order is filed.  \n17  The deadline for Defendants to file their response to the Second Amended Complaint shall \n18  be held in abeyance pending the settlement conference.  In the event the parties are unable \n19  to reach a settlement, Defendants shall file their responsive pleading or Rule 12(b) motion \n20  within fourteen (14) days of the conclusion of the settlement conference. \n21  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n22  Dated:  12/10/15          ______________________________ \nSAUNDRA BROWN ARMSTRONG \n23 \nSenior United States District Judge \n24   \n25   \n26   \n27 \n28 \n- 22 - \n \n   ",
