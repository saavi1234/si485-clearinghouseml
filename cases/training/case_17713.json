    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the legality of two rules issued by the Department of Homeland Security in June 2020 that would delay or eliminate employment authorization documents (EADs) for asylum seekers beginning in August 2020. On July 21, 2020, five nonprofit legal services organizations filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its Secretary in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The organizations sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. &sect; 701) and sought injunctive relief and vacatur of the rules.</p>\r\n<p>During the lengthy application process for asylum in the U.S., the government does not provide any economic or legal support to refugee applicants. Instead, EADs are often the sole opportunity for a refugee to earn an income and the only form of government-issued photo identification. EADs are therefore crucial for securing basic needs&mdash;such as housing, food, medical care, or legal counsel&mdash;and proving an individual&rsquo;s status as an asylum applicant. The organizations alleged that the new rules would complicate the EAD application process by repealing the requirement that DHS approve or deny EAD applications within 30 days of its filing, thereby delaying or eliminating some applicants&rsquo; access to work authorizations. The organizations further alleged that the two rules violated the APA by 1) failing to consider the Refugee Act of 1980, which allows refugees to apply for asylum in the U.S. 2) preventing the public from commenting on the proposed rules, 3) failing to reasonably explain the need for the new rules, and 4) acting through the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, who had not been confirmed by the Senate.</p>\r\n<p>This case was assigned to Judge Paula Xinis. On July 24, 2020, the legal services organizations filed motions for a preliminary injunction and to stay implementation of the rules. On September 11, 2020, the court filed a memorandum opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the organizations&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. The court preliminarily enjoined DHS from enforcing a subset of the rules, including the repeal of the 30-day processing requirement and other changes to the application process, against members of the organizations. But the court also declined to stay implementation of the rules while the case proceeded. Casa de Md., Inc. v. Mayorkas, 486 F. Supp. 3d 928 (D. Md. 2020).&nbsp; For more information on the preliminary injunction, see <a href=\"https://refugeerights.org/press-release-court-partially-blocks-rules-limiting-work-permits-for-asylum-seekers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The government filed an interlocutory appeal, but later withdrew it. The government then requested that the case be placed in abeyance, because the two rules at issue were under review pursuant to in section 3(b) of Executive Order 14,012, &ldquo;Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/05/2021-02563/restoring-faith-in-our-legal-immigration-systems-and-strengthening-integration-and-inclusion-efforts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86 Fed. Reg. 8,277</a> (Feb. 5, 2021).</p>\r\n<p>On February 7, 2022, in a different case, <a href=\"../../../../case/17996/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asylumworks v. Mayorkas</a>, No. 1:20-cv-03815-BAH (D.D.C.), the District Court entered an order vacating the relevant regulations. The government in this case argued that that order obviated the need for the preliminary injunction here, and more generally mooted the case; the plaintiffs disagreed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2022, the Court denied several pending Motions for Summary Judgment as moot. The parties continue to disagree about the need for ongoing litigation; defendants filed a motion to pause the case on August 26, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2022, the government <a href=\"https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2022-20228.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that the next day it would formally remove the challenged regulatory text and restore the regulatory provisions as they had previously appeared.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case remains open.&nbsp;</p>",

This case challenges two interrelated final rules issued by the Department of \nHomeland Security in June 2020 (“Asylum EAD Rules”) in utter disregard of the requirements of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. If permitted to take effect as scheduled \nstarting August 21, these rules would place a crushing and unlawful burden on asylum applicants \nby  upending  the  well-established  system  by  which  they  have  been  able  to  obtain  work \nauthorization in the form of employment authorization documents (“EADs”).  \n2.  The Asylum EAD Rules are part and parcel of the Trump Administration’s broader \nagenda to dismantle the U.S. commitment to assisting migrants fleeing persecution that was \ncodified into law through the Refugee Act of 1980.  \n3.  Congress has enshrined in law the right to apply for asylum in the United States, \nbut the federal government does not offer any economic support or legal representation to \napplicants during the process. Thus, EADs are essential for asylum applicants so that they can earn \nincome to secure housing, food, medical care, legal counsel, and other basic needs for themselves \nand their families as they pursue a safe, permanent life in this country. \n4.  The Asylum EAD Rules will eviscerate the current system that asylum applicants \nrely on to obtain work authorization by complicating and delaying the adjudication of EAD \napplications, depriving applicants of the predictability that they need about when and whether they \nmight obtain their EADs, and denying EADs even to applicants who will win their cases at the end \nof the asylum process. \n5.  By  DHS’s  own  estimate,  the  Asylum  EAD  Rules  will  deprive  hundreds  of \nthousands of asylum applicants of income in the magnitude exceeding $ 2.3 billion annually, even \nwhile recognizing that other harms of restricting applicants’ ability to work are unquantifiable. \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 3 of 54\n \n6.  The asylum applicants who will be harmed by these rules will be vulnerable to \nhomelessness, hunger, inadequate healthcare, and exploitation. They will not be able to afford an \nattorney  to  assist  with  their  asylum  process,  even  though  legal  representation  significantly \nincreases their chance of obtaining asylum. Some may have no choice but to abandon their asylum \nclaims and return home to danger even when they would have ultimately won asylum. \n7.  For example, W.L., a member of Plaintiff Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Inc., \nis a single mother with an 8-year-old son and an 8-month-old U.S. citizen daughter who fled \nGuatemala after being raped repeatedly, forced to have an abortion, and threatened with death by \na prominent man who used his connections to government officials to evade arrest. She is currently \nstaying in a family member’s home where she shares a single room with her children.  \n8.  W.L. filed her asylum application on April 3, 2020, and had been hoping to take \none of the jobs that had been offered through her contacts at her local church, or another stable \njob, once she receives an EAD. Under the current system, she would be eligible to apply for an \nEAD on August 31 and would receive a determination on her application at most 30 days later, or \nby the end of September.  \n9.  If the Asylum EAD Rules are permitted to take effect, however, W.L will be forced \nto wait an additional 7 months before she can even apply for an EAD and an indeterminate length \nof time for the government to process her application. During this time, she will not be able to \nprovide a better housing situation for her children, sustainably pay for adequate basic necessities, \nor hire an immigration attorney to pursue her asylum claim. \n10.  Delay in obtaining EADs will not be the only problem for asylum applicants if the \nAsylum EAD Rules are permitted to take effect, as many will be denied EADs altogether. Plaintiff \nOasis Legal Services, which serves LGBTQ+ asylum seekers who  have endured horrific violence \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 4 of 54\n \nbecause of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or HIV+ status, has a 99% success rate in \nhelping its clients obtain asylum but estimates that 80% of its clients will be denied EADs while \nthey await the adjudication of their asylum claims because of the new ineligibility grounds in the \nAsylum EAD Rules. \n11.  The Asylum EAD Rules will also harm—and in fact have already begun to \nirreparably  harm—plaintiff  organizations,  which  offer  legal  and  other  services  to  asylum \napplicants. The Asylum EAD Rules have already required these organizations to divert resources \nto  properly  advise  their  asylum-seeking  members  and  clients  on  their  asylum  and  EAD \napplications. If the rules take effect, Plaintiffs will have to devote significantly more resources to \nassist these members and clients with the more burdensome EAD application process and to \nconnect them to social and financial services during their extended period of unemployment.  Some \nPlaintiffs face the prospect of financial loss that will threaten their programming and operations. \nThese  harms  will  frustrate  the  organizations’  missions  to  serve  their  clients  and  members, \nincluding but not limited to asylum applicants. \n12.  The  Asylum  EAD  Rules  violate  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  and  are \notherwise unlawful in multiple ways, including because DHS failed to consider the impact of the \nrules on asylum applicants and the humanitarian purposes of the Refugee Act; prevented the public \nfrom commenting on the interplay among multiple proposed rules and refused to consider the \ninterrelated impact of the pending rules and other recent changes that affect the asylum process; \nfailed to reasonably explain the need for the new rules and the changes from its prior positions; \nand acted through Defendant Chad Wolf, who has no valid claim to the Office of Acting DHS \nSecretary and therefore lacked the authority to issue the rules.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 5 of 54\n \n13.  Plaintiffs ask that this Court ensure that the Asylum EAD Rules do not take effect, \nvacate the rules, and hold DHS to its obligation to follow the law.  \nTHE PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff  CASA  de  Maryland,  Inc.  (“CASA”)  is  a  nonprofit  organization \nheadquartered in Langley Park, Maryland, with offices in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. \nCASA’s mission is to create a more just society by building power and improving the quality of \nlife in low-income immigrant communities, including for those seeking asylum. \n15.

Defendant U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a cabinet agency \nof the United States Government. DHS is the agency that proposed and issued both of the Asylum \nEAD Rules and is charged with implementing them should they go into effect. Within DHS, the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is responsible for adjudicating asylum \napplications and EADs for asylum applicants. \n22.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf has purportedly held the title of Acting Secretary of the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security since November 13, 2019. He issued both of the Asylum \nEAD Rules under that purported authority. He is sued in that official capacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as this action \narises under the laws of the United States, including the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), \n5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.  \n24.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) and in this division \nbecause Defendants are agencies and officers of the United States, the action does not involve real \nproperty, and Plaintiff CASA resides in this district and division. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 8 of 54\n \nALLEGATIONS \nI.  WORK AUTHORIZATION BOLSTERS U.S. COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING \nREFUGE TO THOSE FLEEING PERSECUTION. \n \nA.  The Refugee Act Reflects U.S. Commitment to Asylum Applicants. \n \n25.  Congress enshrined the U.S. commitment to providing refuge to those fleeing \nviolence and persecution by passing the Refugee Act of 1980, § 101(a), Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 \nStat. 102, and signing on to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 19 U.S.T. 6223, \nT.I.A.S. No. 6577 (1968). \n26.  The Refugee Act declared it to be “the historic policy of the United States to \nrespond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands.” § 101(a), Pub. \nL. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102. \n27.  Under the Refugee Act, asylum in the United States is available to those who meet \nthe definition of a “refugee”—that is, they are unable or unwilling to return to their home country \n“because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, \nnationality,  membership  in  a  particular  social  group,  or  political  opinion.”  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(A); id. § 1101(a)(42). \n28.  The asylum laws guarantee the right to apply for asylum to all non-citizens arriving \nat the U.S. border or within the United States. Id. § 1158(a)(1).  \n29.  A person may apply for asylum when they arrive at the U.S. border or soon \nthereafter. In such instances, individuals may generally apply for asylum defensively in removal \nproceedings if an asylum officer or immigration judge determines in an initial screening process \n(called a “credible fear interview”) that there is a significant possibility that they could establish \neligibility for asylum. Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) & (B)(ii).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 9 of 54\n \n30.  A person in the United States may also become an asylum applicant by submitting \nan affirmative application to an asylum office of USCIS, 6 U.S.C. § 271, or as a defense to \ndeportation in removal proceedings, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A). \n31.  Regardless of how a person applies for asylum, an asylum applicant cannot be \ndeported to their home country before they receive a decision on their asylum claim after a full \nhearing in a removal proceeding. See id. § 1229a(b)(4), (c)(4); § 1231(a)(1).  \n32.  An asylum applicant who is found ineligible for asylum in a removal proceeding \nbefore an immigration judge has the right to appeal that determination, including to the federal \ncourt of appeals. See id. § 1252(b). \n33.  The asylum laws urge prompt processing of asylum applications. \n34.  For applications made directly to DHS, the agency must grant an asylum applicant \nan initial interview within 45 days of the filing of the application and reach a decision on the \napplication within 180 days absent exceptional circumstances. Id. § 1158(d)(5)(A)(ii), (iii). \n35.  For asylum requests made to an immigration court, the judge must grant a hearing \nwithin 45 days of the application and issue a decision within 180 days absent exceptional \ncircumstances. Id. \n36.  A grant of asylum allows the person to continue to live in the United States and \nautomatically gives work authorization as part of the status.   \n37.  A grant of asylum creates a pathway to lawful permanent resident status in the \nUnited States (i.e., a “green card”), and, ultimately, U.S. citizenship. \n38.  Each year, tens of thousands of asylum applicants are granted asylum in the United \nStates. Most of them eventually become U.S. citizens. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 10 of 54\n \nB.  Work Authorization Permits Asylum Applicants to Fully Exercise Their Right \nto Seek Asylum. \n39.  The  asylum  process  is  complicated,  expensive,  and  difficult  to  navigate, \nparticularly for those who are not trained in U.S. law or fluent in English.  \n40.  To substantiate their application, asylum applicants must often collect documentary \nevidence from their home countries, contact people who can testify in support of their applications, \ntranslate documents if necessary, retain experts, prepare written materials in accordance with \nchanging laws and rules, and travel to interviews or hearings to present their cases.  \n41.  In the affirmative asylum process, an asylum applicant must submit evidence to \nUSCIS and testify before an asylum officer, who can grant asylum or recommend the case be heard \nin immigration court by an immigration judge. \n42.  In immigration court, an asylum applicant faces an adversarial system and must \nrespond to arguments made by attorneys representing the government. \n43.  The asylum process can be lengthy. \n44.  The government routinely fails to meet the statutory time limits for processing \nasylum applications for reasons directly attributable to its decisions about staffing, case processing, \nand case management.   \n45.  For affirmative asylum applications, applications for which the agency does not \npromptly arrange an interview languish because of DHS’s “last-in, first-out” system by which \nnewer applications are decided first. \n46.  For defensive asylum applications, applicants wait on average three years for their \ncases to be decided in immigration court, with a quarter of the applicants waiting nearly four years. \n47.  The  federal  government  does  not  provide  any  economic  support  or  legal \nrepresentation to asylum applicants during the asylum application process. \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 11 of 54\n \n48.  Many asylum applicants lack independent financial resources and require a source \nof  income  to  support  themselves  and  their  families  during  the  pendency  of  their  asylum \napplications.   \n49.  For  many  asylum  applicants,  the  only  viable  source  of  income  is  through \nemployment, which requires an EAD.  \n50.  Many asylum applicants rely on income received from employment made possible \nby their EAD to be able to afford housing, medical care, food, and other basic provisions for \nthemselves and their families during the asylum process. \n51.  Additionally, for many asylum applicants, an EAD is the only government-issued \nphoto identification document that proves that the individual is lawfully in the country as an \nasylum applicant.  \n52.  Many  asylum  applicants  rely  on  their  EAD  for  identification  in  potential \ninteractions with government authorities, or for securing apartment leases, bank accounts, utilities, \nhealth care, and other necessities of life. \n53.  Many asylum applicants rely on their income from employment to retain attorneys \nand to help them fully exercise their right to seek asylum. \n54.  Legal representation in the asylum application process significantly increases an \napplicant’s chance of obtaining asylum. \n55.  In a defensive asylum proceeding, legal representation increases the chance of \nobtaining asylum five-fold.  \n \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 12 of 54\n \nII.  THE  ASYLUM  EAD  RULES  DRAMATICALLY  CHANGE  THE  EXISTING \nSYSTEM BY WHICH ASYLUM APPLICANTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN \nWORK AUTHORIZATION. \n \nA.  The  Existing  Work  Authorization  System  Generally  Allows  Asylum \nApplicants to Obtain Work Authorization 180 Days after Filing Their Asylum \nApplications. \n \n56.  The Refugee Act authorized the federal government to establish a regulatory system \nto grant work authorization to asylum applicants. \n57.  Work  authorization  has  long  been  available  to  asylum  applicants  under  this \nregulatory system. \n58.  In the 1990s, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor agency to \nthe DHS, engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to create the current EAD regulatory system. \n59.  The  current  EAD  regulatory  system  attempts  to  balance  the  need  of  asylum \napplicants to begin working promptly with the agency’s desire to impose a waiting period for an \nEAD in order to discourage fraudulent asylum filings made solely for the purpose of obtaining \nimmediate work authorization. \n60.  Under the current EAD system, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.7,1 an asylum applicant may \nsubmit an EAD application after a waiting period of 150 days after filing for asylum, discounting \nany applicant-caused delays to the asylum process. The EAD application and adjudication process \nare relatively simple: DHS must grant the EAD application within 30 days to any asylum \napplicants without an aggravated felony conviction whose asylum applications have been pending \nfor over 180 days. The initial EAD is renewable so that work authorization will continue to last \nthrough the end of the asylum process, including any federal appeals. \n \n1 Citations to the regulations are to the version in effect as of the filing of the Complaint, except \nwhere otherwise indicated. \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 13 of 54\n \n61.  When  Congress  passed  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant \nResponsibility Act in 1996 with the goal of restricting immigration, it amended the asylum laws \nto adopt the aspect of the regulatory system that requires asylum applicants to wait at least 180 \ndays after filing their asylum application to receive an EAD. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(2). Congress \notherwise continued DHS’s authority to implement an EAD system for asylum applicants through \nregulations. See id.   \nB.  The Asylum EAD Rules Will Introduce Delays, Uncertainties, and Unfair \nObstacles in the Existing System. \n \n62.  The  Asylum  EAD  Rules  published  during  the  week  of  June  22,  2020  will \ndramatically change the regulatory system that DHS has been operating for over two decades. \n63.  On June 22, 2020, DHS issued one final rule (“Timeline Repeal Rule”), which, in \nrelevant part, repeals the requirement that DHS rule on an EAD application within 30 days of its \nfiling.2 See Final Rule, Removal of 30-Day Processing Provision for Asylum Applicant-Related \nForm I-765 Employment Authorization Applicants, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,502, et seq. \n64.  The Timeline Repeal Rule is scheduled to become effective on August 21, 2020. \n65.  On June 26, 2020, DHS issued a second final rule (“Broader EAD Rule”), which \ndestroys  the  current  system  for  making  EADs  available  to  asylum  applicants  by  delaying, \nburdening, and in some instances eliminating asylum applicants’ access to work authorization. See \nFinal Rule, Asylum Application, Interview, and Employment Authorization for Applicants, 85 \nFed. Reg. 38,532, et seq.  \n66.  The Broader EAD Rule is scheduled to become effective on August 25, 2020. \n \n2 References to the “Timeline Repeal Rule” and “Asylum EAD Rules” do not include the rule \nchange requiring that EAD renewal applications be received 90 days prior to the expiration of \nthe EAD. This reflected a technical change to align the regulation with a final rule issued in 2017 \nand has no relationship to or impact on the Timeline Repeal Rule or the Broader EAD Rule. \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 14 of 54\n \n67.  Together, the two Asylum EAD Rules will introduce new delays, uncertainties, and \nunfair obstacles in the system that many asylum applicants, and the organizations that assist and \nprovide services to them, rely upon to ensure that they can safely remain in the United States and \nsupport themselves and their families during the pendency of their asylum applications. \n68.  First, the Asylum EAD Rules will eliminate the regulatory provision that generally \nallows asylum applicants to obtain work authorization 180 days after applying for asylum.  \n69.  Under the current system, the 180-day window is created through two components \nof one regulatory provision, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1). First, an asylum applicant may generally \nsubmit their EAD application 150 days after filing their asylum application. Second, DHS must \nrule on any such EAD application within 30 days if the application for asylum is still pending.  \n70.  The Broader EAD Rule will change this system by requiring asylum applicants to \nwait at least 365 days after they submit their asylum application, instead of 150 days, before \nsubmitting an EAD application. See id. § 208.7(a)(1)(ii) (new) (“365-Day Waiting Period”). \n71.  The Timeline Repeal Rule will eliminate the requirement that DHS adjudicate an \ninitial EAD application within 30 days of receipt, or on any prescribed timeline or priority basis. \nSee id. § 208.7(a)(1) (new). \n72.  These changes will delay asylum applicants’ access to EADs and deprive them of \nthe certainty and predictability of planning for when they can expect to begin receiving income. \n73.  Second, the Asylum EAD Rules will impose new ineligibility grounds even though \nthose grounds may not prevent a grant of asylum. \n74.  Under the current system, the sole ground for ineligibility for an EAD for asylum \napplicants is a conviction for an aggravated felony. See id. § 208.7(a)(1).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 15 of 54\n \n75.  The Asylum EAD Rules will make an asylum applicant presumptively ineligible \nfor work authorization if they did not file their underlying asylum application within one year of \narrival to the United States, even though asylum laws allow applicants to file past one year by \ndemonstrating justifiable circumstances, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D). These circumstances may \ninclude  changed  conditions  in  their  home  country  like  a  regime  change,  changed  personal \ncircumstances such as coming out as LGBTQ+, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder that hampers a \nperson’s ability to prepare an application. An asylum applicant who files past one year will \nnonetheless remain ineligible for an EAD under the Asylum EAD Rules unless and until an asylum \nofficer or an immigration judge decides in the underlying asylum proceeding that the applicant \nwas  justified  in  not  filing  their  asylum  application  within  the  first  year.  See  8  C.F.R.  § \n208.7(a)(1)(iii)(F) (new) (“One-Year Filing Bar”). \n76.  The Asylum EAD Rules will make an asylum applicant presumptively ineligible \nfor work authorization if they entered without inspection between ports of entry, even though entry \nwithout inspection is irrelevant to asylum eligibility, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). The applicant will \nremain ineligible unless and until an officer adjudicating the EAD application determines that the \napplicant: (1) presented themselves without delay but no later than 48 hours after entry, or \nattempted entry, to Border Patrol agents or other delegates of the DHS Secretary; (2) indicated an \nintention to apply for asylum or expressed a fear of persecution or torture; and (3) had “good \ncause” for the entry. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1)(iii)(G) (new) (“EWI Bar”).  \n77.  The  Asylum  EAD  Rules  will  make  an  asylum  applicant  ineligible  for  work \nauthorization if they have been convicted of or have committed a crime that an officer adjudicating \nthe EAD application believes would bar an asylum grant, even though an asylum officer or \nimmigration judge may later determine that such convictions and crimes do not render the \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 16 of 54\n \napplicant ineligible for asylum based on a full assessment of criminal records and applicable state, \nfederal, and foreign law. See id. § 208.7(a)(1)(iii)(B)-(D) (new) (“EAD Criminal Bar”). \n78.  These changes will burden the EAD adjudication process and increase delays in \nreceiving EADs. \n79.  These  changes  will  prevent  applicants  from  receiving  EADs  while  their \napplications are pending even if they will ultimately succeed on their asylum claims.  For example, \nPlaintiff Oasis has a 99% success rate in helping their clients obtain asylum but 80% of their \nasylum clients do not file their asylum claims within one year of arrival to the United States and \nover 67% entered the United States without inspection. Thus, many of Plaintiff Oasis’s clients will \nbe denied EADs under the Asylum EAD Rules even though they will likely ultimately succeed on \ntheir asylum claims. \n80.  Third, the Asylum EAD Rules will grant DHS new discretion to delay or deny \nwork authorization.  \n81.  Under the current system, DHS must inform asylum applicants within 30 days if it \nconsiders their asylum application to be incomplete, or else deem the application complete and \nproperly filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.3(c)(3). \n82.  Under the current system, applicant-caused delays in the asylum proceedings toll \nthe waiting period for an EAD application but do not serve as a ground for denying an EAD. See \nid. § 208.7(a)(2). \n83.  Under the current regulatory scheme, DHS must grant work authorization to asylum \napplicants who are eligible for an EAD. See id. § 274a.13(a)(1). \n16 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 17 of 54\n \n84.  The Asylum EAD Rules will give DHS discretion to deem an asylum application \nincomplete, and therefore not filed, at any point in the asylum application process. See id. \n§ 208.3(c)(3) (new) (“Deem Complete Removal”).  \n85.  As a matter of policy, DHS deems applications incomplete for minor, technical \nreasons, such as failing to write “n/a” next to any question that is inapplicable to the applicant or \nmarking the applicant’s name and identification number in pen rather than pencil on the back of \nan accompanying passport photo. \n86.  This change will mean that asylum applicants may learn long after they have filed \nthe application that DHS has determined that their asylum application was incomplete and \ntherefore must be refiled, triggering a new waiting period for the EAD application or the One-Year \nFiling Bar. \n87.  The Asylum EAD Rules will give DHS discretion to deny an EAD application if it \ndeems that an “applicant-caused delay” in an asylum proceeding is “outstanding or has not been \nremedied”  on  the  date  that  the  EAD  application  is  filed.  See  id.  §  208.7(a)(1)(iv)  (new) \n(“Applicant-Caused Delay Denial”). \n88.  DHS has not defined “outstanding” or “has not been remedied,” and has provided \na broad, non-exhaustive list of circumstances that it may deem to be “applicant-caused delay.”  \n89.  The Asylum EAD Rules will give DHS discretion to deny EADs to those who are \neligible for them. See id. § 274a.13(a)(1) (new) (“Discretionary Denials”). \n90.  These changes will increase delays in receiving EADs, deprive asylum applicants \nof the certainty and predictability of planning for future income, and prevent applicants from \nreceiving EADs while their applications are pending.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 18 of 54\n \n91.  Fourth, the Asylum EAD Rules will eliminate existing procedural options for \ncertain asylum applicants to obtain work authorization earlier than 180 days from the date of filing \ntheir asylum applications. \n92.  Under the current system, asylum applicants who have completed the asylum \nprocess successfully except for the government’s resolution of fingerprint and other final security \nchecks may receive “recommended approvals,” permitting the immediate issuance of their EADs. \nSee id. § 208.7(a)(1); § 274a.12(c)(8). \n93.  Separately, asylum seekers who have passed the credible fear screening (and thus \nhave been found to have a significant possibility that they could establish eligibility for asylum), \nand who have demonstrated that they should be paroled from custody for “urgent humanitarian \nreasons” or “significant public interest,” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A), are permitted to apply for work \nauthorization under a separate EAD regulation for parolees that does not require a waiting period. \nSee id. § 274a.12(c)(11). \n94.  The Asylum EAD Rules will eliminate recommended approvals. See 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.7(a)(1) (new), § 274a.12(c)(8) (new) (“Recommended Approval Removal”). \n95.  The  Asylum  EAD  Rules  will  prevent  asylum  seekers  who  are  paroled  from \napplying for work authorization under the EAD regulation for parolees. See id. § 274a.12(c)(11) \n(new) (“Parolee EAD Removal”). It will require asylum applicants who already have an EAD \nbased on parole to apply for an EAD based on an asylum application under the Broader EAD \nRules. \n96.  These changes will impose new delays, compounded by other changes in the \nAsylum EAD Rules, on asylum applicants who DHS had previously determined merit earlier \naccess to work authorization. \n18 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 19 of 54\n \n97.  Fifth,  the  Asylum  EAD  Rules  will  impose  a  new  and  redundant  biometrics \nrequirement  and  an  accompanying  new  fee.  See  id.  §  208.7(a)(1)(i)  (new)  (“Biometrics \nRequirement”). \n98.  Under the current system, asylum applicants are required to submit to fingerprinting \nand other biometrics collection in connection with their asylum application, but there is no fee for \nthe collection and asylum applicants are not required to resubmit the same information separately \nto support their EAD application. \n99.  The Asylum EAD Rules will require asylum applicants to attend another biometric \nappointment, to pay a fee, and to re-submit to the same biometric collection that was required for \ntheir asylum application in order to have their EAD application processed. \n100.  This change will burden the EAD adjudication process, cause delays, and require \nasylum applicants to travel to a redundant biometrics appointment and to pay for the processing at \na time when their resources are limited because of their inability to work.  \n101.  Sixth, the Asylum EAD Rules will impose new limitations on the validity period \nof work authorization. \n102.  Under the current system, EADs for asylum applicants are available during the time \nthat asylum applicants seek federal court review of a denial of their asylum application, whether \nthrough the initial EAD or through a renewal. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(b). \n103.  The Asylum EAD Rules will prevent asylum applicants from continuing to work \npursuant to their EADs while they pursue federal court review of a denial of their asylum \napplication. Instead, the Asylum EAD Rules will cap the maximum validity period for each EAD \nat 2 years, after which an applicant will have to renew, and the EADs will automatically terminate \nwhen an asylum officer denies an asylum application, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirms \n19 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 20 of 54\n \na denial of an asylum application by an immigration judge, or when a removal order becomes \nadministratively final. See id. § 208.7(a)(1)(i), (b) (new) (“Limited EAD Validity”). If an asylum \napplicant prevails in their federal court review, they must re-apply for an EAD and wait for their \napplication to be processed.  \n104.  These changes will impose new burdens, uncertainties, and delays on asylum \napplicants and prevent asylum applicants from continuing to work under an existing EAD while \nthey pursue federal court review to which they are statutorily entitled. \nIII.  THE  ASYLUM  EAD  RULES  WILL  HARM  PLAINTIFFS,  THEIR  CLIENTS, \nTHEIR MEMBERS, AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. \n \n105.  The costs of the Asylum EAD Rules to our society are significant. \n106.  DHS estimates costs of the Asylum EAD Rules to include lost compensation to \nasylum applicants exceeding $ 2.3 billion annually.   \n107.  Even  this  estimate  is  low  given  DHS’s  reliance  on  flawed  assumptions,  the \nlimitations in its data, and its refusal to consider the cumulative and interrelated impacts of the \nrules. \n108.  For asylum applicants, lost compensation means risks of homelessness, hunger, \ninadequate healthcare, vulnerability to exploitation, and inability to access legal counsel to pursue \ntheir right to seek asylum. \n109.  Lost compensation for asylum applicants increases burdens on their social support \nnetworks, which may include state and local entities, social and legal services organizations, \nreligious groups, and families and friends in the United States. \n110.  Lost compensation for asylum applicants means lost productivity for businesses \nthat employ them and lost tax revenue for federal and state governments. \n111.  The Asylum EAD Rules have already begun to cause irreparable harm. \n20 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 21 of 54\n \n112.  In light of the upcoming effective dates for the Asylum EAD Rules, each plaintiff \norganization has already begun to divert resources to address the problems raised by the rules, \nincluding by providing urgent legal services to clients and members who are seeking to file asylum \napplications or EADs prior to the effective dates, addressing questions from anxious clients and \nmembers, and/or educating their staff, clients, and members about the rules. \n113.  Plaintiffs ASAP, Centro Legal, Pangea, and Oasis have had to expend resources to \nprepare for the impact of the Asylum EAD Rules on their clients should they take effect. ASAP, \nCentro Legal, and Oasis have set aside or significantly reduced other programming—such as other \nemergency legal aid or legal assistance to vulnerable youth—to prioritize assisting in the filing of \nEAD applications before the effective dates of the Asylum EAD Rules and advising asylum \napplicants and attorneys on the impact of the rules. \n114.  Although Plaintiff CASA does not ordinarily assist members with their asylum \napplications, it has shifted its resources at the expense of other programming so that it can help its \nmembers file applications before the effective dates of the Asylum EAD Rules, both to preserve \ntheir eligibility and to minimize the delay they will now face. \n115.  The Asylum EAD Rules will further these harms if they take effect.  \n116.  Because the Asylum EAD Rules will complicate and prolong the EAD application \nprocess, Plaintiffs ASAP, Centro Legal, Pangea, and Oasis will have to permanently set aside or \nsignificantly reduce other programming in order to continue providing legal assistance to asylum \napplicants seeking EADs and to educate their clients and members on the new rules. It will take \nthese  legal  services  organizations  much  longer—at  least  twice  as  long  by  Centro  Legal’s \nestimate—to assist clients and members with the EAD application process under the Asylum EAD \nRules than under the current system, including because of the need to screen for, collect evidence \n21 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 22 of 54\n \non, and argue against the application of the EAD Criminal Bar or the EWI Bar. The lack of clarity \nin certain provisions of the rules, such as the vague definition of an “applicant-caused delay” in \ndefensive asylum proceedings that could result in an EAD denial (under the Applicant-Caused \nDelay Denial), will force plaintiffs to expend additional resources to understand the rules’ effect \non their members and clients.  \n117.  Because the Asylum EAD Rules will prolong the EAD process, Plaintiffs ASAP, \nCentro Legal, Pangea, and Oasis will be forced to keep EAD matters open on their docket for \nlonger and to dedicate resources to affirmatively inquiring about the status of the EAD application \nwith the agency and potentially filing mandamus actions to require an adjudication. \n118.  Because the Asylum EAD Rules will result in delay or denial of EADs to asylum \napplicants, Plaintiffs ASAP, Centro Legal, Pangea, and Oasis will have to dedicate additional legal \nresources  to  support  their  clients  and  members  who  now  cannot  afford  paid  private  legal \nrepresentation.  \n119.  The Asylum EAD Rules also make providing asylum representation more difficult \nand complicated, including by imposing draconian and vague rules on what may constitute \n“applicant-caused delay” (under the Applicant-Caused Delay Denial) and by eliminating the \nrequirement that DHS notify counsel of any technical problems with the asylum application within \n30  days  of  filing  (under  the  Deemed  Complete  Removal).  Plaintiffs  that  provide  asylum \nrepresentation will have to spend additional time communicating with clients and USCIS to ensure \nthat DHS has determined that the initial asylum application has been filed and ensuring that they \nare avoiding what DHS may characterize as “applicant-caused delay” in the asylum process even \nif the delay might be justified. \n22 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 23 of 54\n \n120.  Because the Asylum EAD Rules will result in delay or denial of EADs to asylum \napplicants, Plaintiffs CASA, ASAP, and Oasis will have to dedicate additional resources to \nproviding non-legal support to their members and clients.  \n121.  ASAP will have to dedicate additional resources to referring members to a wide \nrange of social services. \n122.  Oasis will have to dedicate additional resources, including hiring an additional staff \nmember, to providing case management services to their clients.  \n123.  CASA will have to divert more resources to sustain the financial assistance program \nthat it has offered to its members during the pandemic, which has already distributed more than \n$740,000 to almost 2,000 of its members. CASA anticipates that many of its asylum-seeking \nmembers will not receive EADs promptly under the Asylum EAD Rules and will rely more heavily \nthan under the current EAD system on CASA’s financial assistance program for basic life \nnecessities, such as groceries, rent, and healthcare costs.  \n124.  CASA will also be forced to spend additional resources to re-train staff on advising \nmembers about how to demonstrate eligibility for assistance programs, including health care, when \nthey lack an EAD to confirm identity.  \n125.  The Asylum EAD Rules will threaten some plaintiff organizations’ finances. \n126.  One-third of Oasis’s budget in 2019 came from client revenue. Oasis charges fees \nusing a sliding scale based on a client’s income and requires clients to start paying fees only when \nthey are able to do so. Currently, many clients begin paying Oasis for its services after they receive \nan EAD. Oasis anticipates that its ability to retain staff and stay open as an organization will be \njeopardized because Oasis believes that under the Asylum EAD Rules approximately 80% of its \nclients will be barred from receiving EADs while their asylum applications are pending and the \n23 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 24 of 54\n \nremaining 20% will be unable to receive EADs until at least 365 days after filing their asylum \napplication.  \n127.  CASA will also risk loss of funding if the Asylum EAD Rules take effect. CASA \noperates  worker  centers  for  its  members  that  are  funded  in  part  by  contracts  with  local \ngovernments. These contracts require that a certain percentage of the work placements made by \nthe  worker  centers  involve  work-authorized  individuals  placed  in  long-term  employment \npositions. If CASA’s members are unable to obtain EADs promptly as a result of the Asylum EAD \nRules, CASA may not be able to meet the contract requirements, which risks the sustainability of \nits worker centers for all of its membership.  \n128.  DHS recognized in the Asylum EAD Rules that the rules will burden nonprofit \norganizations that serve asylum applicants, like plaintiff organizations, because their clients and \nmembers will have to rely more heavily on their assistance. \n129.  Given limitations on organizational resources, all of these harms will frustrate the \nplaintiff  organizations’  ability  to  pursue  their  missions  to  serve  their  clients  and  members, \nincluding but not limited to asylum applicants. \n130.  While the harms to plaintiff organizations are serious, the harms to the clients and \nmembers that they serve will be devastating if the Asylum EAD Rules are allowed to take effect. \n131.  CASA is currently providing pro se application assistance to one of its members, \nM.C., in filing her asylum application. M.C. fled Guatemala with her two daughters after receiving \nmultiple threats to her life as a result of reporting a crime. Since M.C. will have recently filed her \nasylum application, she will not be eligible to apply for an EAD before the effective date of the \nAsylum EAD Rules. If the Asylum EAD Rules take effect, MC will be forced to wait an additional \n24 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 25 of 54\n \n7 months before she can even apply for an EAD, and an indeterminate length of time for the \ngovernment to process her application. \n132.  Another member of CASA, A.O., is a Venezuelan national, who entered the United \nStates in December of 2019 on a nonimmigrant visitors’ visa. A.O. was a journalist in Venezuela \nand her family has been extremely outspoken about their opposition to Venezuela’s President, \nNicolás Maduro. A.O. and her parents fled to the U.S. after being attacked by Maduro party \nofficials, who tied them up and robbed their house after threatening them. CASA is now providing \nA.O. with pro se assistance in filing her asylum application, but she too will have to wait a \nsignificantly longer time to obtain an EAD under the new Asylum EAD Rules, dramatically \nimpacting her ability to support herself while her application is pending. \n133.  In addition to W.L. mentioned above, ASAP’s member N.G., filed her asylum \napplication in April 2020. Under the current rules, she would be able to apply for an EAD in \nSeptember 2020 and would expect to receive a response from the government 30 days later.   \n134.  N.G.  fled  Honduras  with  her  young  daughter  because  she  and  her  family \nexperienced targeted violence and death threats after defying a drug cartel. The Honduran police \nwould not have protected her due to their corruption and collusion with drug traffickers. She and \nher daughter are currently staying in a trailer with a friend and her children, and she has been \nrelying on pandemic-related food benefits from her state to make ends meet. Once she obtains an \nEAD, she hopes to take up her neighbor’s offer to help her find employment at a local factory \nwhere they work. If her EAD is delayed or denied as a result of the Asylum EAD Rules, she will \nnot be able to provide more suitable housing for her daughter, alleviate her family’s food \ninsecurity, or save money to hire a lawyer for her immigration case. \n25 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 26 of 54\n \n135.  With the possibility of work authorization so distant and uncertain, some asylum \napplicants  who  cannot  otherwise  support  themselves  and  their  families  during  the  asylum \napplication process will have no choice but to abandon their claims and ultimately to return to their \nhome countries—notwithstanding the risk of persecution and even death.  \n136.  Given the prospect of forced destitution during the asylum application process, \nsome noncitizens fleeing persecution who would be eligible for asylum will be deterred from \nexercising their right to apply for asylum.   \nIV.  THE  ASYLUM  EAD  RULES  WERE  ISSUED  THROUGH  ARTIFICIALLY \nSEGREGATED RULEMAKINGS. \n \n137.  In April 2019, President Trump directed DHS to undertake rulemaking to transform \nthe  asylum  and  the  EAD  systems  as  a  part  of  his  broader  agenda  to  curtail  humanitarian \nimmigration to the United States. See Donald J. Trump, Memorandum on Additional Measures to \nEnhance Border Security and Restore Integrity to Our Immigration System (Apr. 29, 2019), \navailable at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/DCPD-201900251. \n138.  DHS began its efforts to dismantle the existing work authorization system for \nasylum applicants in the fall of 2019 through artificially segregated and staggered  rulemakings on \noverlapping issues, starting by issuing two notices that later became the Asylum EAD Rules \n(“Asylum EAD Notices”). \n139.  On September 9, 2019, DHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that initiated \nthe public comment period for what later became the Timeline Repeal Rule. See Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking, Removal of 30-Day Processing Provision for Asylum Applicant-Related \nForm I-765 Employment Authorization Applications, 84 Fed. Reg. 47,148 (“Timeline Repeal \nNotice”). \n26 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 27 of 54\n \n140.  The Timeline Repeal Notice informed the public that DHS would separately pursue \na “broader asylum EAD” rulemaking but claimed that the two rulemakings were “distinct.”  \n141.  The Timeline Repeal Notice limited the content of the comments DHS would \nconsider to comments it deemed related to only that specific proposal. \n142.  The comment period for the Timeline Repeal Notice closed on November 8, 2019. \n143.  DHS received over 3,200 comments in response to the Timeline Repeal Notice. \n144.  On November 14, 2019, six days after the comment period for the Timeline Repeal \nNotice closed, DHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that initiated the public comment \nperiod for what later became the Broader EAD Rule. See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Asylum \nApplication, Interview, and Employment Authorization for Applicants, 84 Fed. Reg. 62,374 \n(“Broader EAD Notice”). \n145.  The Broader EAD Notice referenced the Timeline Repeal Notice, and in fact \nincluded in its proposal the same change proposed in the Timeline Repeal Notice, but claimed that \nthe two rulemakings were “distinct.” \n146.  The Broader EAD Notice limited the content of the comments DHS would consider \nto comments it deemed related to only that specific proposal. \n147.  The comment period for the Broader EAD Notice closed on January 13, 2020. \n148.  DHS received a total of 1,074 comments in response to the Broader EAD Notice. \n149.  In addition to these rulemakings, DHS has issued other proposed rules to limit \nasylum that interact with the Asylum EAD Rules. \n150.  On the same day that it issued the Broader EAD Notice, DHS issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking that would, for the first time, require asylum applicants to pay a fee to file \nan asylum application and to file an initial application for an EAD. See Proposed Rule, U.S. \n27 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 28 of 54\n \nCitizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and Changes to Certain Other Immigration \nBenefit Request Requirements, 84 Fed. Reg. 62,280 (“Fee Notice”). It also increased the EAD \nrenewal fee and eliminated the availability of any fee waivers. See id. \n151.  If the Fee Notice is finalized as proposed, it will impose fees on the asylum and \nEAD process in addition to the fees that will be imposed by the Biometrics Requirement in the \nAsylum EAD Rules, at a time when asylum applicants will not have work authorization and will \nnot know when they will become work authorized. \n152.  On December 19, 2019, DHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would \nexpand criminal bars to asylum eligibility. See Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Procedures \nfor Asylum and Bars to Asylum Eligibility, 84 Fed. Reg. 69,640 (“Asylum Criminal Bars Notice”). \n153.  If the Asylum Criminal Bars Notice is finalized as proposed, the criminal bars will \nbecome the ineligibility grounds that EAD adjudication officers will apply to deny EADs under \nthe EAD Criminal Bar.   \n154.  On June 15, 2020, DHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose \nsignificant additional barriers to the asylum process. See Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, \nProcedures for Asylum and Withholding of Removal; Credible Fear and Reasonable Fear Review, \n85 Fed. Reg. 36,264 (“Broader Asylum Notice”). \n155.  If the Broader Asylum Notice is finalized as proposed, it will prevent many people \nfrom pursuing asylum and will substantially decrease the number of applications for EADs by \nasylum applicants.  \n156.  The comment periods for the Fee Notice, the Asylum Criminal Bars Notice, and \nthe Broader Asylum Notice have closed, but DHS has not issued the final rules. \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 29 of 54\n \nV.   THE ASYLUM EAD RULES WERE ISSUED BY DEFENDANT WOLF, WHO \nLACKED LAWFUL AUTHORITY TO DO SO. \n \n157.  As a consequence of President Trump’s chaotic effort to block humanitarian \nimmigration to the United States, there has been constantly rotating leadership at DHS. \n \n158.  Indeed, there has been no Senate-confirmed Secretary leading DHS since April 10, \n2019 at the latest.  \n \n159.  Defendant Chad Wolf issued both of the final Asylum EAD Rules under his \npurported authority as Acting DHS Secretary.  \n160.  However, Defendant Wolf is and has been serving as Acting Secretary in violation \nof both the Homeland Security Act (“HSA”) and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”).   \n161.  Accordingly, Defendant Wolf had no authority to issue the final Asylum EAD \nRules. \nA.  Defendant Wolf’s Service as Acting Secretary Violates the HSA, Which \nGoverns the Order of Succession for the Office.  \n \n162.  The HSA governs the order of succession for the office of Acting DHS Secretary. \nSee 6 U.S.C. § 113.  \n163.  Defendant Wolf’s service as Acting DHS Secretary violates the HSA because he \nwas not next in the order of succession at the time that he purported to succeed to that office. \n164.  Nor was Defendant Wolf next in the order of succession at any time since he \npurported to begin exercising the authority of Acting DHS Secretary. \n165.  The HSA requires that the DHS Secretary shall be “appointed by the President, by \nand with advice and consent of the Senate.” 6 U.S.C. § 112(a)(1). \n29 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 30 of 54\n \n166.  The HSA mandates that, in the event of the “absence, disability, or vacancy in \noffice” of the Secretary, the Deputy DHS Secretary is first in the order of succession as Acting \nSecretary and the Under Secretary of Management is second. Id. § 113(a)(1)(A), (g)(1). \n167.  After the Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary of Management, the HSA allows \nthe DHS Secretary to “designate such other officers of the Department in further order of \nsuccession to serve as Acting Secretary.” Id. § 113(g)(2).  \n168.  On December 15, 2016, then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memorandum \nadopting a succession order “[i]n case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform \nthe functions of the Office.” Department of Homeland Security, DHS Orders of Succession and \nDelegation of Authorities for Named Positions (Dec. 15, 2016) (“DHS Orders of Succession & \nDelegation”). \nB.  Secretary Nielsen’s Resignation Triggered a Line of Unlawful Appointments \nUnder the HSA. \n \n169.  The line of unlawful successions began when DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who \nhad been appointed by the President with consent of the Senate, resigned.  \n170.  President Trump announced Secretary Nielsen’s departure from office on April 7, \n2019 by tweet, and at the same time announced that her successor would be Kevin McAleenan, \nwho was then serving as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). \n171.   Secretary Nielsen announced her resignation later in the day on April 7, 2019 and \npublicly submitted her resignation letter, which stated that it was “effective April 7th, 2019.” \n172.  A few hours later in the day on April 7, 2019, however, former Secretary Nielsen \nannounced by tweet that she “ha[d] agreed to stay on as Secretary” until April 10, 2019. \n30 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 31 of 54\n \n173.  On April 7, 2019, former Secretary Nielsen’s effective resignation date, Claire \nGrady served as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Management, and in that capacity, had \nbeen the Acting DHS Deputy Secretary since April 16, 2018.  \n174.  Pursuant to the text of the HSA and DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation in \nplace at the time of Secretary Nielsen’s resignation, Grady became Acting DHS Secretary as soon \nas former Secretary Nielsen’s resignation was effective.  \n175.  Grady submitted her resignation as Acting DHS Secretary on April 9, 2019, which \nbecame effective April 10, 2019. \n176.  On April 10, 2019, former Secretary Nielsen, who had resigned three days earlier, \npurported to issue an amendment to the DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation “in the event \n[she  was]  unavailable  to  act  during  a  disaster  or  catastrophic  emergency.”  Department  of \nHomeland Security, DHS Orders of Succession and Delegation of Authorities for Named Positions \n(Dec. 15, 2016) as amended (Apr. 10, 2019) (emphasis added).  \n177.  Former Secretary Nielsen’s purported amendments, however, left intact the section \nof the DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation that governed succession in case of the Secretary’s \n“death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office.” Id.  \nC.  Kevin McAleenan’s Succession to the Office was Unlawful Under the HSA. \n178.  On April 11, 2019, Kevin McAleenan, who was then the CBP Commissioner, \npurported to assume the Office of Acting Secretary.  \n179.  Under the DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation, however, two other Senate-\nconfirmed individuals were ahead of McAleenan to succeed to that Office: Christopher Krebs, \nwho then served as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs, \n31 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 32 of 54\n \nand David Glawe, who then served as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Intelligence and \nAnalysis.  \n180.  Because McAleenan’s purported succession was unlawful under the HSA and DHS \nOrders of Succession & Delegation, he had no valid legal claim to the Office of Acting DHS \nSecretary. \n181.  Because  McAleenan  had  no  valid  legal  claim  to  the  Office  of  Acting  DHS \nSecretary, he could not lawfully exercise the authority of that Office, including the following \npurported actions in paragraphs 182, 183, and 185. \n182.  On September 9, 2019, McAleenan purported to cause the DHS to issue the \nTimeline Repeal Notice as the signing authority. \n183.  On November 8, 2019, McAleenan purported to issue a new amendment to the \nDHS Orders of Succession & Delegation that revised the order of succession “[i]n case of the \nSecretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office.” Department of \nHomeland Security, Amendment to the Order of Succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security \n(Nov. 8, 2019). \n184.  McAleenan resigned as Acting DHS Secretary on November 13, 2019. \n185.  On November 14, 2019, McAleenan purported to cause the DHS to issue the \nBroader EAD Notice as the signing authority, although he had resigned the day before. \nD.  Defendant Wolf’s Purported Succession to the Office Was Unlawful Under \nthe HSA. \n \n186.  On November 13, 2019, Defendant Wolf, who had been confirmed by the Senate \nthe same day as the DHS Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans after serving in an Acting \ncapacity until then, purported to assume the Office of Acting DHS Secretary upon McAleenan’s \nresignation.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 33 of 54\n \n187.  Defendant Wolf’s succession was pursuant to McAleenan’s unlawful amendment \nto the DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation, which purported to place the DHS Under Secretary \nfor Strategy, Policy, and Plans fourth in the line of succession after the Deputy Secretary, Under \nSecretary of Management, and CBP Commissioner to fill the role of Acting DHS Secretary. \n188.  Defendant Wolf had and has no valid legal claim to the Office of Acting DHS \nSecretary. Under the governing DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation, multiple DHS officials \nwere ahead of Wolf to succeed to that Office. \n189.  Because Defendant Wolf had no valid legal claim to the Office of Acting DHS \nSecretary, he could not lawfully exercise the authority of that Office, including the following \npurported actions in paragraphs 190-91. \n190.  On June 22, 2020, Defendant Wolf purported to issue the Timeline Repeal Rule. \n191.  On June 26, 2020, Defendant Wolf purported to issue the Broader EAD Rule.   \n192.  DHS  had  notice  that  McAleenan’s  and  Defendant  Wolf’s  service  as  Acting \nSecretary  was  unlawful,  including  through  press  accounts  that  immediately  noted  the  legal \nproblems posed by their service as Acting Secretary and through comments on the proposed \nAsylum EAD Rules.  \n193.  On November 15, 2019 Representative Bennie Thomas, Chairman on the House \nHomeland Security Committee, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, Acting Chairwoman of the \nHouse  Oversight  and  Reform  Committee,  also  submitted  a  letter  to  the  U.S.  Government \nAccountability Office detailing their concerns about McAleenan’s and Defendant Wolf’s service \nas Acting Secretary, and copied Defendant Wolf. \n \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 34 of 54\n \nE.  Defendant Wolf’s Service as Acting Secretary Also Violates the FVRA.  \n \n194.  The FVRA limits the time period for which any acting officer may fill a vacancy \nthat requires Senate confirmation. See 5 U.S.C. § 3346. \n195.  Congress  enacted  the  FVRA  to  prevent  the  President  from  avoiding  their \nobligations under the Appointments Clause, which requires certain high-ranking U.S. officials like \nthe DHS Secretary to be appointed through the Senate’s advice-and-consent process.  \n196.  The FVRA provides that an acting officer may serve in a vacancy that requires \nSenate confirmation “for no longer than 210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs,” with \nlimited exceptions that are inapplicable here. Id. § 3346(a)(1).  \n197.  After 210 days without a Senate-confirmed officer, the FVRA requires an office to \nremain vacant until the President submits a new nominee for Senate confirmation. See id. \n§ 3348(b)(1). \n198.  The FVRA requires that an “action taken by any person who is not acting” in \naccordance with its requirements “in the performance of any function or duty of a vacant \noffice . . . shall have no force or effect.” Id. § 3348(d)(1). \n199.  Although the FVRA provides guidance on succession when a Senate-confirmed \nposition becomes vacant, it permits another statute to expressly dictate a different means for \ntemporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and duties of any office of an \nExecutive agency that requires Senate confirmation. See id. § 3347(a).  \n200.  In the case of DHS, the HSA expressly governs the order of succession in the \nagency.  See ¶¶ 166-68. \n34 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 35 of 54\n \n201.  However, the HSA does not expressly extend the FVRA’s 210-day limit on the \nperiod for an acting official to hold a position that requires Senate confirmation. See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 113(g).  \n202.  On November 3, 2019, the office of DHS Secretary had been vacant for 210 days \nsince April 7, 2019, the effective date of Secretary Nielsen’s resignation letter. \n203.  On November 6, 2019, the office of DHS Secretary had been vacant for 210 days \nsince April 10, 2019, the date that former Secretary Nielsen purported to leave office.  \n204.  After November 6, 2019 at the latest, the FVRA required the office to “remain \nvacant” until the President submitted a new nominee for Senate Confirmation. Id. § 3348(b)(1). \n205.  After November 6, 2019 at the latest and continuing to today, no officer or \nemployee could perform the functions and duties of the Office of DHS Secretary under the FVRA, \nunless and until the President submitted a new nominee for Senate Confirmation.  \n206.  Since Secretary Nielsen left office, and as of the filing of the present complaint, \nPresident Trump has not submitted a new nominee for the position of DHS Secretary to the Senate \nfor confirmation. \n207.  Defendant Wolf began serving as Acting DHS Secretary on November 13, 2019, \nafter the 210-day period under the FVRA had passed.  \n208.  Any action that Defendant Wolf has taken during his tenure, including the issuance \nof the Asylum EAD Rules on June 22, 2020 and June 26, 2020, was taken without authority and \nhas no force or effect under the FVRA. \n209.  In addition, any action that McAleenan took after November 6, 2019 at the latest, \nincluding  the  issuance  of  his  amendments  to  DHS  Orders  of  Succession  &  Delegation  on \nNovember 8, 2019, was taken without authority and has no force or effect under the FVRA. \n35 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 36 of 54\n \n210.  Because McAleenan’s amendments to the DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation \nwere without force or effect under the FVRA, Defendant Wolf could not have lawfully assumed \nthe office of Acting Secretary by succession under those amendments. \nVI.  THE ASYLUM EAD RULES VIOLATE THE APA.   \n \n211.  The Asylum EAD Rules are legislative rules that will have the force and effect of \nlaw after their effective date, and DHS was required to follow the requirements of the APA for \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in issuing them. \n212.  The Asylum EAD Rules are final agency actions because they represent the \nconsummation  of  the  agency’s  decisionmaking  processes—in  this  case,  the  rulemaking \nprocesses—and because they have direct consequences for hundreds of thousands of asylum \napplicants and for the plaintiff organizations and others that serve them. \n213.  The Asylum EAD Rules are unlawful under the APA, including because:  \na.  DHS failed to adequately consider the interests of asylum applicants and the \nhumanitarian purposes of U.S. asylum laws (see ¶¶ 216-23);  \nb.  DHS engaged in flawed rulemaking processes that failed to consider the interrelated \nimpact of its segregated rulemakings and policy changes (see ¶¶ 224-36);  \nc.  DHS failed to reasonably explain the need for the Asylum EAD Rules and the \ndepartures from prior factual findings, legal conclusions, and policy positions (see \n¶¶ 237-51); and \nd.  DHS otherwise engaged in arbitrary and capricious rulemaking and acted without \nobservance of required procedure, in excess of statutory authority and limitations, \nand otherwise not in accordance with law (see ¶¶ 252-73). \n36 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 37 of 54\n \n214.  Each of the foregoing deficiencies, on its own and together, requires that the \nAsylum EAD Rules be vacated. \n215.  DHS received comments and/or otherwise was on notice during the rulemaking \nprocess regarding each of these ways in which the proposed rules are unlawful but did not cure the \ndefects in finalizing the Asylum EAD Rules. \nA.  DHS  Failed  to  Consider  the  Interests  of  Asylum  Applicants  and  the \nHumanitarian Purpose of the Refugee Act. \n \n216.  The APA requires agencies to consider important aspects of the problem in its \nrulemaking and to articulate a satisfactory explanation for their actions. \n217.  In issuing the Asylum EAD Rules, DHS failed to consider the interests of asylum \napplicants and the humanitarian purposes of the Refugee Act, which are important aspects of the \nEAD system for asylum applicants. \n218.  In responding to comments that raised concerns about the wellbeing of asylum \napplicants, DHS repeatedly relied on the notion that asylum applicants do not have the right to be \ngranted asylum in the United States or the right to an EAD while their asylum applications are \npending, without recognizing that even so it must consider the humanitarian purposes of U.S. \nasylum laws in changing and issuing its policies.  \n219.  In responding to comments that expressed concern about preventing or impeding \nasylum applicants from pursuing asylum, DHS stated repeatedly that the rules do not, as a technical \nmatter, bar anyone from seeking asylum, participating in the adjudication process, or seeking \nreview to which they are entitled, without recognizing and considering the practical effects of its \nown rules—including that delaying or denying work authorization burdens the right to seek asylum \nand erects a de facto barrier to pursuing relief. \n37 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 38 of 54\n \n220.  DHS’s principal stated purpose in issuing the Broader EAD Rules was not only to \ndeter frivolous and fraudulent applications, but also to deter bona fide applications that may be \ndenied at the conclusion of the asylum process. \n221.  In describing this purpose, DHS failed to recognize and consider that the asylum \nadjudication process exists to determine which applications are legally meritorious; there is no \nway for anyone to distinguish between meritorious and non-meritorious applications before the \nadjudication has taken place. \n222.  In responding to comments raising concerns about deterring and hindering asylum \napplications that will succeed at the end of the process, DHS stated in an irrational and conclusory \nmanner, without any support, that the Asylum EAD Rules will not deter such applications. \n223.  The Asylum EAD Rules will deter meritorious asylum applications and undermine \nthe humanitarian purpose of the Refugee Act.  \nB.  DHS Deprived the Public of a Meaningful Opportunity to Comment on, and \nFailed to Consider, the Interrelated Impact of Its Segregated Rulemaking \nProcesses and Other Policy Changes. \n \n224.  The APA requires agencies to give the public the meaningful opportunity to \ncomment when it engages in rulemaking. \n225.  In issuing the Asylum EAD Rules, DHS engaged in rulemaking that was artificially \nsegregated so as to deprive the public of the meaningful opportunity to comment on the interrelated \nimpact of its proposed rules and other policy changes. Accordingly, the public was not able to \nprovide meaningful comments regarding the full impact of each proposed rule against other \nchanges  to  the  asylum  landscape  that  DHS  is  simultaneously  pursuing  through  multiple \nrulemakings.   \n38 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 39 of 54\n \n226.  In issuing the Asylum EAD Rules, DHS failed to consider the interrelated impact \nof its segregated rulemaking processes and other policy changes, even though such interrelated \nimpact is an important aspect of the EAD system for asylum applicants. DHS only considered the \nimpact of each rule change on its own and considered comments regarding each rule as if it would \nbe in effect against the existing asylum landscape, instead of considering the impact of all of the \nrule changes in the aggregate and the rule changes as they would be in effect in the asylum \nlandscape that DHS is simultaneously changing through multiple rulemakings. \n227.  In issuing the Timeline Repeal Rule, DHS categorized comments related to the \nBroader EAD Notice as “out of scope” and refused to consider comments on the interaction of the \ntwo notices. \n228.  In  responding  to  comments  stating  that  it  is  “essentially  impossible”  to \nmeaningfully comment on the Timeline Repeal Notice without analyzing how the repeal would \ninteract with the Broader EAD Notice (which had not yet been issued at the time that the comment \nperiod for the Timeline Repeal Notice closed), DHS recognized that the two Asylum EAD Rules \ninteract but that “to the extent that there is interaction or overlap, DHS will address such concerns \nif it finalizes the broader rule.” \n229.  DHS broke that promise when it issued the Broader EAD Rule and refused to \nconsider comments that pointed to the problems with segregated and staggered rulemaking and the \ninteraction of the two rules. \n230.  In conducting the cost-benefit analysis on the Broader EAD Rule, as well as in \nanalyzing each rule change, DHS refused to consider the cumulative impact of the rule changes \nwithin the Broader EAD Rule or of the interrelated impact of the Timeline Repeal Rule or of other \npending rule changes. \n39 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 40 of 54\n \n231.  For example, in finalizing the EAD Criminal Bar, DHS abandoned its initial \nproposal to add certain specific criminal bars to EADs and decided instead to align the EAD \ncriminal bars to criminal grounds of ineligibility for asylum. DHS did so even though it is \nsimultaneously pursuing, and has not completed, another rulemaking through the Asylum Criminal \nBars Notice that proposes to change the asylum ineligibility grounds. This decision deprived the \npublic of a meaningful opportunity to comment on the new proposal, including whether the new \nasylum ineligibility grounds that may be adopted as a result of the Asylum Criminal Bars Notice \nare also appropriate grounds for denying EADs.  \n232.  In allowing Discretionary Denials, DHS justified granting itself discretion to deny \nEADs to eligible asylum applicants because it “cannot continue to provide EADs with virtually no \neligibility criteria and nearly limitless renewal opportunities,” without recognizing that in the same \nrulemaking it was imposing such limitations on eligibility and renewal opportunities. \n233.  In finalizing the Recommended Approval Removal and Parolee EAD Removal, \nDHS failed to consider the cumulative impact of the Asylum EAD Rules, which indefinitely delay \nwork authorization, on this group of asylum seekers who DHS had previously deemed should \nreceive earlier access to work authorization.  \n234.  DHS refused to consider the cumulative impact of other policies that the Trump \nAdministration has adopted related to asylum, including but not limited to the Presidential \nProclamation banning migrants from applying for asylum if they entered without inspection; the \nso-called “Migrant Protection Protocols” that force asylum applicants to return to Mexico and \nremain there for the duration of their asylum proceedings; and an interim final rule that disqualifies \npeople from receiving asylum unless they have already unsuccessfully sought similar protection \nin another country on their way to the United States. \n40 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 41 of 54\n \n235.  For example, in responding to comments raising concerns about curtailing asylum \napplicants’ access to attorneys, DHS assumed that low-cost or pro bono legal assistance will be \navailable  to  unemployed  asylum  applicants  who  cannot  afford  to  retain  a  lawyer  without \nconsidering how the cumulative impact of parallel rulemakings and other policies burdens the \navailability of resources. \n236.  In responding to comments raising concerns about the lack of socioeconomic \nsupport for asylum applicants, DHS assumed that social services provided by state and local \ngovernments and nonprofit organizations will be available to support asylum applicants who are \nnot permitted to work through the application process without considering how the cumulative \nimpact of parallel rulemakings and other policies burden these resources. \nC.  DHS Failed to Reasonably Explain the Need for the Asylum EAD Rules and \nto Explain Changes from Its Prior Positions. \n \n237.  The APA requires the agency to reasonably explain that there is a problem to be \nsolved in its rulemaking, which includes providing an explanation that makes a rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choices made. \n238.  The APA requires the agency to acknowledge and reasonably explain changes from \nits prior factual findings, legal conclusions, and policy positions. \n239.  DHS failed to reasonably explain the need for the Asylum EAD Rules. \n240.  In explaining the purpose of the Broader EAD Rule, DHS alleged that the rule was \nneeded to reduce incentives for “frivolous, fraudulent, or otherwise non-meritorious asylum \napplications,” but DHS provided no basis to support the conclusion that these problems exist or \nthat if such problems exist they would be addressed by the Broader EAD Rule.  \n241.  In support of its position, DHS relied solely on a decades-old body of work that \ndiscusses problems in the early 1990s that the current work authorization system was created to \n41 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 42 of 54\n \naddress, not problems with the current system—analysis that contradicts the agency’s position that \nthe current work authorization system requires and warrants further restriction. \n242.  In stating the need for the Broader EAD Rule, DHS alleged that the rule was \nnecessary because the asylum system has not changed in recent years to effectively address \nincentives for illegal immigration and frivolous asylum filings, but DHS ignored the pending \nparallel rulemakings and policy changes that it is undertaking to change asylum allegedly for these \nsame reasons. \n243.  Similarly, in describing the background for the Timeline Repeal Rule, DHS alleged \nthat the rule was necessary because the current rules do not reflect current operational realities, but \nDHS did not consider that the changes in the Broader EAD Rule and other parallel rulemakings \nand policy changes will significantly affect operational realities. \n244.  In explaining the purpose of the Timeline Repeal Rule, DHS alleged that the rule \nwas needed to address fraud in the EAD application process, but DHS provided no basis to support \nthe conclusion that problems of fraud exist in the EAD application process. \n245.  DHS further alleged that another purpose of the Timeline Repeal Rule was to \nprovide flexibility, but DHS failed to reasonably explain why “flexibility” was needed now when \nthe agency had faced backlogs and fluctuations in application volumes in the past, including at the \ntime of the prior rulemaking. DHS failed to reasonably explain why it departed from its prior \ndecision  that  the  current  regulatory  system  appropriately  balances  agency  flexibility  and \naccountability.  \n246.  In adopting the Asylum EAD Rules, DHS failed to reasonably explain why it \ndeparted from its prior decision that 180 days is adequate to reduce incentives to file fraudulent or \nfrivolous asylum applications for the purpose of obtaining work authorization and that the current \n42 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 43 of 54\n \nEAD system will appropriately incentivize the agency to adjudicate asylum applications within \nthe 180-day statutory timeline. \n247.  In adopting the Asylum EAD Rules, DHS failed to reasonably explain why it \ndeparted from its prior decision to adopt 180 days as the time period by which most asylum \napplicants should be able to obtain work authorization given the humanitarian concerns at stake. \n248.  In justifying the 365-Day Waiting Period, DHS alleged that the waiting period for \nfiling an EAD should be extended from 150 days because of current average delays in the asylum \nproceedings, but failed to reasonably explain why the waiting period should be tied to such data \nwhen the asylum laws continue to require the government to adjudicate applications within 180 \ndays and when the failure to meet that timeline is the government’s fault.  \n249.  In imposing the One-Year Filing Bar and the EAD Criminal Bar, DHS failed to \nreasonably explain why it departed from its previous decision to separate EAD adjudication from \nasylum eligibility because of the administrative burdens of attempting to duplicate the asylum \nadjudication process within the EAD adjudication process. \n250.  In finalizing the One-Year Filing Bar, DHS failed to explain why it departed from \nits previous decision to not impose a One-Year Filing Bar for EADs in part because it did not want \nto encourage people who are in lawful status during their first year of presence in the United States \nto prematurely submit an asylum application if they were hoping for the situation in their country \nto improve such that they could return at the end of their lawful stay. \n251.  In finalizing the Deemed Complete Removal, DHS failed to reasonably explain \nwhy it departed from its previous decision to promptly reject or deem complete applications for \nasylum  in  view  of  the  potentially  harsh  consequences  of  permitting  the  agency  to  reject \napplications later and on technical grounds.  \n43 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 44 of 54\n \nD.  DHS Violated the APA in Numerous Other Ways. \n252.  The APA prohibits an agency from relying on incorrect legal analysis in its \nrulemaking.  \n253.  In issuing the Broader EAD Rules, DHS violated this mandate by relying on \nreasoning that conflicts with the asylum laws, including as alleged in paragraphs 254-57. \n254.   In imposing the One-Year Filing Bar, DHS stated that it “believes that one year is \nample time for a bona fide asylum applicant to submit his or her application.” But the asylum laws \nrecognize that sometimes one year is definitely not “ample time for a bona fide asylum applicant \nto  submit [their asylum] application,” such as when the circumstances of the applicant or their \nhome  country  change  in  ways  that  materially  affect  their  asylum  eligibility,  or  because  of \ncircumstances, including trauma, that might pose barriers to filing within one year. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(2)(D). \n255.  In imposing the EWI Bar, DHS stated that it “believes that illegally entering the \nUnited States without good cause should be strongly deterred.” This “belief” is irreconcilable with \nthe right of all individuals to seek asylum under the asylum laws, including those who entered the \ncountry without inspection. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). DHS mistakenly imposed a strict “good \ncause” requirements on asylum applicants in order to obtain an exception to the EWI Bar, failing \nto understand that under Article 31(1) of the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is binding on the \nUnited States through the 1967 Protocol, fleeing persecution is itself good cause to enter a country \nwithout inspection. \n256.  In  imposing  Limited  EAD  Validity  and  depriving  asylum  applicants  of  the \nopportunity  to  continue  working  through  the  federal  review  process,  DHS  stated  that  the \nadministrative review that occurs prior to judicial review gives “sufficient time and a reasonable \n44 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 45 of 54\n \nprocess for asylum seekers to establish that they warrant a favorable exercise of discretion for a \ngrant of asylum.” This “belief” is irreconcilable with the right to pursue federal appeals court \nreview under the asylum laws, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), and the fact that administrative decisions \ndenying asylum are routinely reversed or vacated on review. \n257.  In imposing the Parolee EAD Removal, DHS stated that it sought to distinguish \nbetween asylum seekers and people “paroled truly for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant \npublic benefit.” This misstates the law, as asylum seekers released from custody receive parole \nbased on a finding of “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” 8 U.S.C. § \n1182(d)(5)(A). \n258.  The  APA  prohibits  the  agency  from  relying  on  unreasonable  or  irrational \nexplanations in its rulemaking. \n259.  In  issuing  the  Broader  EAD  Rules,  DHS  violated  this  mandate  by  offering \ninternally conflicting explanations for its rule changes, including as alleged in paragraphs 260-61.  \n260.  In  imposing  the  Biometrics  Requirement,  DHS  first  explained  that  this  was \nnecessary because it “is not able to refresh or reuse biometrics that were collected” for the asylum \napplication, but then stated that EAD biometrics will benefit security by allowing the agency to \ncompare  “EAD  biometrics  with  those  collected  [earlier]  from  the  asylum  applicant”—thus \nestablishing that DHS in fact plans on reusing the earlier-collected biometrics. \n261.  In responding to comments that sought an exception to the EWI Bar for victims of \nhuman trafficking and smuggling, DHS stated that it believes that such asylum applicants may be \nable to meet the bar’s exception, but it failed to explain how, given that the exception requires \nasylum applicants to present themselves to a border agent within 48 hours of crossing and indicate \nan intention to apply for asylum or expressing a fear of persecution or torture, in addition to \n45 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 46 of 54\n \nmeeting an undefined “good cause” standard. Victims of human trafficking and smuggling are \noften unable to encounter a border agent or other government officers within 48 hours of crossing \nbecause they are held captive. \n262.  The APA requires an agency to respond to significant comments about its proposals \nwhen engaging in rulemaking. \n263.  DHS violated this mandate by failing to respond to significant comments submitted \nin response to the Broader EAD Notice, including as alleged in paragraphs 264-268. \n264.  In finalizing the Broader EAD Rules, DHS failed to respond to comments that it \nunreasonably relied on decades-old research to attempt to justify the Broader EAD Rules. \n265.  In imposing the Biometrics Requirement, DHS failed to respond to comments \nquestioning how an asylum applicant can be required to pay a biometric fee for the initial EAD \napplication when the applicant has not been permitted to work yet.  \n266.  The APA requires the agency to consider reliance interests engendered by the \npolicy that it is changing in its rulemaking. \n267.  DHS violated this mandate by failing to consider reliance interests of asylum \nseekers. \n268.  For example, in imposing the Parolee EAD Removal, DHS failed to consider the \nreliance interests of approximately 13,000 paroled asylum applicants who are already working \nwith EADs and who will have to reapply under the Asylum EAD Rules when their work \nauthorization expires and may be found ineligible. DHS failed to consider that these asylum \nseekers will lose their jobs while they wait for their new EAD applications to be processed and \nmay not be eligible for another EAD under the Asylum EAD Rules. \n46 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 47 of 54\n \n269.  The APA requires the agency to consider reasonable alternatives to its rulemaking \nand reasonably explain its rejection of such alternatives. \n270.  DHS violated this mandate by failing to consider reasonable alternatives to the \nAsylum EAD Rules, including as alleged in paragraphs 271-73. \n271.  In issuing the Timeline Repeal Rule, DHS failed to reasonably explain its rejection \nof alternative time periods for adjudicating the EAD application. DHS alleged that it was rejecting \nan  alternative  90-day  timeline  for  adjudicating  EAD  applications  because  of  the  need  for \n“flexibility,” but the desire to avoid all accountability is not a reasonable explanation under the \nAPA. \n272.  In imposing the 365 Day Waiting Period and issuing the Timeline Repeal Rule, \nDHS failed to reasonably explain its rejection of the alternative of imposing a shorter waiting \nperiod. DHS alleged that it was rejecting this alternative because it would create an incentive to \nfile a “non-meritorious” asylum application, but failed to reasonably explain why this would be so \nwhen asylum applicants would not be guaranteed work authorization within any particular time \nframe under the Timeline Repeal Rule. DHS alleged that it was rejecting this alternative because \nit would necessitate the creation of a new system to ensure that EADs would not be issued prior to \n180 days as provided by statute, but failed to reasonably explain why a 180-day waiting period \nwould not be a reasonable alternative. \n273.  In issuing the Asylum EAD Rules, DHS failed to consider reasonable alternatives \nto mitigate the alleged problem of “frivolous, fraudulent, or otherwise non-meritorious asylum \napplications” filed for the purpose of obtaining EADs, such as ensuring prompt processing of \nasylum claims so that they are adjudicated within the statutorily mandated 180 days. \n47 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 48 of 54\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCount One   \nThe Asylum EAD Rules Should Be Set Aside Because They Violate the APA \n \n274.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n275.  Under the APA, a reviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law; . . . (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right;. . .”  or “(D) without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2). \n276.  Defendants violated the foregoing requirements of the APA in issuing both of the \nAsylum EAD Rules, and each of the rule changes contained therein, for several independent \nreasons, each of which is sufficient to require that the Asylum EAD Rules, or each of the rule \nchanges contained therein, be set aside.   \n277.  First, in issuing the Asylum EAD Rules, Defendants failed to consider the interests \nof asylum applicants and the humanitarian purpose of the Refugee Act, as they were required to \ndo. \n278.  Second, the rulemakings relating to both of the Asylum EAD Rules were not in \naccordance with the law and were undertaken without observance of procedures required by law \nbecause they failed to provide the public adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to comment \non interrelated issues between the two rules and other parallel rulemakings. The Asylum EAD \nRules  are  also  arbitrary  or  capricious  as  a  consequence  of  Defendants’  failure  to  consider \ninterrelated issues between the two rules and other related parallel rulemakings. \n48 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 49 of 54\n \n279.  Third, Defendants violated the APA in issuing both of the Asylum EAD Rules, and \neach of the rule changes contained therein, by failing to reasonably explain the need for the Asylum \nEAD Rules. \n280.  Fourth, Defendants otherwise violated the APA in issuing both of the Asylum EAD \nRules, and each of the rule changes contained therein, including because they failed to consider \nimportant aspects of the problem and reliance interests, to consider alternatives to the approaches \nthey adopted, to examine relevant data, to acknowledge and/or explain various reversals of \npositions the agencies have long taken, to respond to significant comments, and/or to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for their actions. \n281.  Both of the Asylum EAD Rules, or in the alternative each rule change contained \ntherein, should be vacated as violating the APA. \nCount Two \nThe Asylum EAD Rules Should Be Set Aside Because  \nThey Violate the Homeland Security Act (“HSA”)  \n \n282.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n283.  Under the APA, a reviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be…not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or “without observance of \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D). \n284.  The issuance of the Asylum EAD Notices was an agency action.  \n285.  The issuance of the Asylum EAD Rules was an agency action. \n286.  The issuance of the Asylum EAD Notices and the issuance of the Asylum EAD \nRules were acts taken as functions or duties of the Office of the DHS Secretary.  \n49 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 50 of 54\n \n287.  Defendant Wolf holds, and has held at all relevant times relating to the allegations \nin the complaint, the Office of Acting DHS Secretary in violation of the HSA and the DHS Orders \nof Succession & Delegation.  \n288.  The Asylum EAD Rules should be vacated as violating the APA because Defendant \nWolf unlawfully held the position of Acting DHS Secretary under the HSA when he issued the \nAsylum EAD Rules and accordingly any acts that he took were in violation of the HSA and the \nDHS Orders of Succession & Delegation.  \nCount Three \nThe Asylum EAD Rules Should be Set Aside  \nBecause They Violate the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”) \n \n289.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n290.  Under the APA, a reviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be…not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” or “without observance of \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D). \n291.  Under the FVRA, an “action taken by any person who is not acting” under its \nrequirements “in the performance of any function or duty of a vacant office…shall have no force \nor effect.” Id. § 3348(d)(1). \n292.  Even  assuming  Defendant  Wolf  holds  his  position  as  Acting  DHS  Secretary \nlawfully under the HSA (which he does not), his appointment is independently in violation of the \nFVRA.  \n293.  Defendant Wolf issued the Asylum EAD Rules in the performance of the function \nor duty of the Acting Secretary.  \n50 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 51 of 54\n \n294.  The issuance of the Broader Asylum EAD Notice was an agency action.  \n295.  The issuance of the Asylum EAD Rules was an agency action. \n296.  The Asylum EAD Rules should be held to have no force or effect under the FVRA \nand/or vacated as violating the APA.  \nCount Four \nThe Asylum EAD Rules Should Be Enjoined Because They Are Ultra Vires  \n \n297.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n298.  Courts have equitable authority to enjoin ultra vires agency action. See, e.g., \nLarson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949). \n299.  Because Defendant Wolf’s service is not authorized by the FVRA, the HSA, or the \nAppointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, any actions he or DHS may take under his \npurported authority, including issuing and implementing of the Asylum EAD Rules, are ultra vires \nand must be enjoined. \nCount Five \nThe Broader EAD Rule Should Be Set Aside  \nBecause It Violates the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”)  \n \n300.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth \nherein. \n301.  The  Regulatory  Flexibility  Act  (“RFA”),  as  amended,  requires  federal \nadministrative agencies to analyze the effects on “small entities” of rules they promulgate, and to \npublish initial and final versions of those analyses. 5 U.S.C. §§ 603-604. \n302.  For purposes of the RFA, the term “small entities” includes small businesses, small \nnonprofit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. 5 U.S.C. § 601(6). \n51 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 52 of 54\n \n303.  The Broader EAD Rule is a “rule” within the meaning of the RFA. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 601(2). \n304.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a “small entity” within the meaning of the RFA and is \ndirectly affected by the Broader EAD Rule, which requires them, inter alia, to substantially alter \ntheir programmatic activities (including the services they provide) and their employment practices. \n305.  The Broader EAD Rule’s final regulatory flexibility analysis does not comply with \nthe  RFA,  including  because  of  DHS’s  factually  and  legally  unsupported  and  unexplained \nconclusion that the rule does not directly affect small entities. \n306.  Based on that erroneous conclusion, DHS refused to describe and estimate the \nnumber of small entities that would be affected by the rule, as required by the RFA, 5 U.S.C. § \n604(a)(4); and likewise failed to describe and project the rule’s compliance requirements, as is also \nrequired, id. § 604(a)(5). \n307.  DHS independently failed to fulfill the RFA’s requirement that the agency describe \nthe significant issues raised by public comments in response to its initial regulatory flexibility \nanalysis (published in the Broader EAD Notice), id. § 604(a)(2), choosing instead to limit its \ninquiry to discussion to a solitary public comment that “referenced small entities,” 85 Fed. Reg. at \n38623, ignoring that other commenters raised significant issues with DHS’ initial regulatory \nflexibility analysis. \n308.  DHS also ignored the RFA’s requirement that it describe the steps it has taken to \nminimize the impact on small entities “consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes,” \nand that it provide “a statement of the factual, policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative \nadopted in the final rule” and why each of the other alternatives were rejected. 5 U.S.C. § 604(a)(2). \n52 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 53 of 54\n \nRather than considering “the stated objectives of applicable statutes,” including the Refugee Act, \nDHS instead considered only its own objectives in promulgating the Broader EAD Rule. \n309.  The Broader EAD Rule’s final regulatory flexibility analysis was also arbitrary or \ncapricious because its conclusions were not reasonable nor reasonably explained; it failed to \nrespond to significant comments; it failed to consider relevant data about the effects of the rule; it \nfailed to consider alternatives; it failed to explain the alternative it did adopt; and its conclusions \nwere not supported by substantial evidence. \n310.  The Broader EAD Rule is therefore unlawful and must be set aside. See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 611; 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  With respect to Counts 1-4, issue a preliminary injunction under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 65 or an order to stay or postpone the effective dates of the Asylum EAD Rules \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 705 (“On such conditions as may be required and to the extent necessary to \nprevent irreparable injury, the reviewing court . . . may issue all necessary and appropriate process \nto postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion \nof the review proceedings”); \n2.  Declare unlawful and set aside the Asylum EAD Rules in their entirety, or in the \nalternative with respect to specific rule changes; \n3.  Enjoin  Defendants  and  all  those  acting  on  their  behalf  from  enforcing  or \nimplementing the Asylum EAD Rules in their entirety, or in the alternative with respect to specific \nrule changes; \n4.  Enter an order vacating the Asylum EAD Rules in their entirety, or in the alternative \nwith respect to specific rule changes; \n53 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 1   Filed 07/21/20   Page 54 of 54\n \n5.

Plaintiffs, five non-profit organizations \nproviding services to immigrant and asylum populations across the country, bring this action \nagainst Defendants Chad F. Wolf (“Wolf”), in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS” or “agency”).  ECF \nNo. 1.  Plaintiffs mount a full-throated attack on the challenged agency rules, invoking the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), and the \nHomeland Security Act (“HSA”). \nPlaintiffs now move to stay or preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the challenged these \nrules, which went into effect on August 21 and August 25, 2020.   ECF No. 23-1 at 8–9; ECF \nNo. 24-2; ECF No. 24-3.  For the following reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part \nthe motion.  Until this Court reaches the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, it will preliminarily enjoin \nDefendants from enforcing a subset of the rule changes as applied to the individual members of \nPlaintiffs Casa de Maryland, Inc. (“CASA”) and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (“ASAP”).  \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 2 of 69\nI.  Background \n    \nFor the last forty years, the United States Government has permitted any migrant \n“physically present” in the United States—regardless of where or under what status they enter—\nto apply for asylum.1  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)( “Immigration and Nationality Act” or “INA”),  \n(2009); see also Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96–212 § 208, 94 Stat. 102, 105 (1980) \n(amending the INA).  A person is eligible for asylum when unable or unwilling to return to her \nhome country “because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, \nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. §§ \n1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(1)(A).  The United States boasts of a generous tradition of granting asylum \nseekers a critically important avenue to becoming a lawful permanent resident and ultimately a \nUnited States citizen.  See id. §§ 1159(b), 1427(a).   \nThis road to asylum, however, is long and winding.  While the INA requires immigration \njudges and the Department of Homeland Security’s Citizenship and Immigration Services office \n(“USCIS”) to adjudicate asylum applications within 180 days, id. § 1158(d)(5)(A)(iii), the \nprocess often takes years to complete.  See Asylum Application, Interview, and Employment \nAuthorization for Applicants (“Broader EAD Rules”), 85 Fed. Reg. 38,532, 38,548 (June 26, \n2020) (detailing asylum “backlog” resulting in “years-long wait” to obtain asylum); ECF No. 24-\n19 at 6 n.14; ECF No. 24-20 at 43; ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 10; ECF No. 24-6 ¶ 13; ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 10.  \nDuring this time, asylum applicants are not eligible for a wide variety of social or medical \nbenefits.2  ECF No. 24-20 at 42.   \n \n1 Among other changes, the Refugee Act of 1980 amended the definition of “refugee” within the INA to conform to \nthe United States’ treaty obligations; Congress also for the first time required the Attorney General to enact \n“procedures for determining eligibility for asylum.”  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 964 F.3d 832, 839–40 \n(9th Cir. 2020).   \n \n2 Plaintiff Centro assists affirmative asylum seekers and juveniles whose asylum applications have been pending \nsince 2014.  ECF No. 24-6 ¶ 13.  Asylum hearings cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic have been reset \n2 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 3 of 69\nTo mitigate this evident economic hardship on asylum applicants, the agency has \nhistorically granted asylum seekers work authorization in the form of an employment \nauthorization document (“EAD”), so that applicants may lawfully support themselves while they \nawait final decision on their asylum applications.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n38,544.  In addition, an EAD is often the first identification document an applicant receives, \nwhich asylum applicants can then use to obtain other critical documents such as a driver’s \nlicense or social security number.  See Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,527.  Also with \nan EAD, an applicant can more easily enroll in job training programs or college, conduct \npersonal banking, and obtain health insurance.  See id.; ECF No. 24-4 ¶¶ 14–16.  \nFor twenty-five years, the EAD application process has largely remained unchanged.  See \nECF No. 23-1 at 10; ECF No. 41 at 7; Rules and Procedures for Adjudication of Applications for \nAsylum or Withholding of Deportation and for Employment Authorization (“1994 Reforms”), 59 \nFed. Reg. 62,284, 62,289-62,303 (Dec. 5, 1994).  Pertinent to this motion, these rules worked as \nfollows.  Asylees first had to submit a completed application for asylum and then wait 150 days \nfrom the date the asylum application was deemed complete before the applicant could also apply \nfor an initial EAD.  Id. at 62,289; Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,598.  To ensure the \n150-day clock started ticking, the USCIS deemed any asylum application pending for 30-days \nwithout further agency notification as “complete” for purposes of the EAD waiting period.  Id.  \nThus, functionally, the applicant had to wait a total of 180 days—150 days from the time she \nsubmitted a complete asylum application before she could apply for an EAD.  Then, once an \napplicant submitted an EAD application, the agency had thirty days to grant or deny the initial \nEAD application.  See 1994 Reforms, 59 Fed. Reg. at 62,299; Removal of 30-Day Processing \n \nfor as late as fall of 2023.  Id.; see also ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 10 (of Oasis’ 500 clients with pending asylum applications, \nover half have been waiting more than three years for adjudication).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 4 of 69\nProvision for Asylum Applicant-Related Form I–765 Employment Authorization Applications \n(“Timeline Repeal Rule”), 85 Fed. Reg. 37,502, 37,505 (June 22, 2020); Broader EAD Rules, 85 \nFed. Reg. at 38,545; see also ECF No. 41 at 8.  \nImportantly, these regulations represented a purposeful decision to stagger the asylum \nand EAD application process to deter asylum applicants from filing boilerplate asylum \napplications solely to obtain work authorization.  ECF No. 23-1 at 11; ECF No. 23-10 (cited at \n85 Fed. Reg. 38,544 n.30).  That said, DHS took great pains to minimize the hardship to asylum \nseekers, stating unequivocally that the 150-day waiting period represented the time “beyond \nwhich it would not be appropriate to deny work authorization to a person whose claim ha[d] not \nbeen adjudicated.”  See Rules and Procedures for Adjudication of Applications for Asylum or \nWithholding of Deportation and for Employment Authorization (“Notice of 1994 Reforms”), 59 \nFed. Reg. 14,779, 14,780 (proposed Mar. 30, 1994).  And in the event the underlying asylum \napplication was not timely resolved, the agency also imposed a backstop in requiring USCIS \n(then the Immigration and Naturalization Service) to process EAD applications within 30 days.  \nSee 1994 Reforms, 59 Fed. Reg. at 62,284.  Congress later codified the 180-day waiting period \nfor filing EAD applications to mirror these regulations.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n38,545; Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-\n208, § 208, 110 Stat. 3009-693 (1996).  \nThe challenged rules overhaul the EAD application process entirely.  See Timeline \nRepeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,545-46; Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626-28.  DHS \nmaintains the challenged rules are necessary to mitigate the increased strain on the agency’s \nlimited resources and to “disincentivize aliens who are not bona fide asylum seekers from \nexploiting a humanitarian program to seek economic opportunity in the United States.”  Broader \n4 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 5 of 69\nEAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,546; see also Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,502.  The \nchallenged rules are complex, and in practice they make it substantially harder, if not nearly \nimpossible, to obtain pre-asylum work authorization.3  Below more particularly describes those \nchanges at the heart of this litigation and their combined impact on asylees’ ability to work \nlawfully while awaiting a decision on their underlying asylum claims. \nA.  Changes to the EAD Rules \n  On September 9, 2019, DHS began the process of changing the entire EAD scheme by \neliminating 30-day EAD processing rule.  See Removal of 30-Day Processing Provision for \nAsylum Applicant-Related Form I-765 Employment Authorization Applications, 84 Fed. Reg. \n47148 (proposed Sept. 9, 2019) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pt. 208).  Over the sixty-day comment \nperiod, DHS received roughly 3,200 comments.  See Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n37,510.  DHS published the final Timeline Repeal Rule unchanged on June 22, 2020, which took \neffect on August 21, 2020.  Id. at 37,502.  The Timeline Repeal Rule now eliminates any \ndeadlines previously imposed on the agency to process EAD applications, allowing the agency \nunfettered time to determine whether to grant the asylum applicant an EAD.  Id. at 37,505.  \n  The comment period on the Timeline Repeal Rule closed on November 8, 2019.   84 Fed. \nReg. 47,148.  Six days later, on November 14, 2019, the agency issued a second notice of \nproposed rulemaking for seventeen additional rule changes, all related to the EAD application \nprocess.  See Asylum Application, Interview, and Employment Authorization for Applicants, 84 \nFed. Reg. 62,374 (proposed Nov. 14, 2019) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 208 and 274a).  The \n \n3 In the last year, the agency has also pursued other rulemakings, which are not the subject of this challenge but \nwould make it more difficult to secure asylum.  See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and \nChanges to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements, 84 Fed. Reg. 62,280 (proposed Nov. 14, \n2019); see also Procedures for Asylum and Bars to Asylum Eligibility, 84 Fed. Reg. 69,640 (proposed Dec. 19, \n2019); Procedures for Asylum and Withholding of Removal, Credible Fear and Reasonable Fear Review, 85 Fed. \nReg. 36,264 (proposed June 15, 2020).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 6 of 69\nseventeen proposed additional rule changes are collectively termed the “Broader EAD Rules.”  \nSee 85 Fed. Reg. 38,598-38,600.  A sixty-day comment period followed, during which the \nagency received 1,074 comment submissions.  See id. at 38,553.  The agency issued the final \nBroader EAD Rules on June 26, 2020, which remained largely unchanged save for clarifying that \nthe rules, in their entirety, would apply only to those EAD applications submitted after the \neffective date of the Broader EAD Rules, August 25, 2020.  See id. at 38,536, 38,626–28.    \n  The Broader EAD Rules alter an array of interlocking substantive and procedural \nrequirements.  First, the new rules more than double the waiting period before an asylum \napplicant may file for EAD—from 150 to 365 days.  Compare 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.3(c)(3), \n208.7(a)(1)(ii), and 274a.12(c)(8) (effective until Aug. 25, 2020) (“the filing of an incomplete \napplication shall not commence the 150–day period”) with Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n38,626 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.3(c)(3), 208.7(a)(1)(ii), and 274a.12(c)(8)) (“Receipt of \na properly filed asylum application will commence the 365-day period after which the applicant \nmay file an application for employment authorization.”); (“An applicant for asylum cannot apply \nfor initial employment authorization earlier than 365 calendar days after the date USCIS or the \nimmigration court receives the asylum application.”) (discussing work-eligible asylee who has \nwaited 365-day waiting period).    \nSecond, the new rules eliminate the “deemed complete rule” that triggers the now 365-\nday waiting period.  Where previously agency silence on whether an asylum application was \ncomplete automatically deemed it complete and started the EAD application clock, now the \napplicant must wait an unspecified time to receive agency notice that the underlying asylum \napplication is complete.  Compare 8 C.F.R. § 208.3(c)(3) (effective until August 25, 2020) \n(“[An] incomplete application shall not commence the 150–day period after which the applicant \n6 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 7 of 69\nmay file an application for employment authorization.”) (“If the [agency] has not mailed the \nincomplete application back to the applicant within 30 days, it shall be deemed complete.”) with \nBroader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.3(c)(3)) (“Receipt \nof a properly filed asylum application will commence the 365–day period after which the \napplicant may file an application for employment authorization.”).  The elimination of the \n“deemed complete” rule could conceivably result in an asylum applicant waiting an indefinite \nperiod of time for confirmation that her underlying asylum application is complete before the \n365-day EAD clock begins to run. \nThird, the Broader EAD rules eliminate automatic EAD authorization where the asylum \napplicant met preexisting criteria; now such EAD applications may be denied at the discretion of \nthe agency.  Compare 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(a)(1) (effective until August 25, 2020) (“The approval \nof applications filed under 8 CFR 274a.12(c), except for 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(8), are within the \ndiscretion of USCIS.”) with Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,628 (to be codified at 8 \nC.F.R. § 274a.13(a)(1)) (eliminating asylee exception and stating that the “approval of \napplications filed under 8 CFR 274a.12(c) is within the discretion of USCIS.”).  Fourth and \nrelatedly, the Broader EAD Rules also eliminate the agency’s preliminary review process \nwhereby if an applicant received a “notice of recommend approval”—indicating the asylee is \nlikely to secure an ultimate grant of asylum—the applicant could apply for an EAD before the \nexpiration of the waiting period.  Compare 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1) (effective until August 25, \n2020) (“In the case of an applicant whose asylum application has been recommended for \napproval, the applicant may apply for employment authorization when he or she receives notice \nof the recommended approval.”) and § 274a.12(c)(8)(ii) (asylee is eligible for EAD who “[h]as \nbeen recommended for approval, but who has not yet received a grant of asylum or withholding \n7 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 8 of 69\nor deportation or removal”) with Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626-28 (to be codified \nat 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1) and § 274a.12(c)(8)) (omitting reference to notice of recommended \napproval in both provisions); (requiring that asylee wait full 365-day waiting period).   \nFifth, any applicant with unresolved, applicant-caused delays in the underlying asylum \napplication will be denied an EAD.  Applicant-caused delays include the applicant’s requesting \nto amend or supplement the pending asylum application; failing to appear to receive and \nacknowledge receipt of the asylum decision; requesting an extension of time to submit additional \nevidence; or submitting additional documentary evidence fewer than 14 days before the asylum \ninterview.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626-27 (to be codified at 8 CFR §§ \n208.4, 208.7(a)(1)(iv) and 208.9(e)) (“[A]ny delay in adjudication or in proceedings caused by a \nrequest to amend or supplement the application will be treated as a delay caused by the applicant \nfor purposes of § 208.7 and 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(8).”); (“Any delay requested or caused by the \napplicant … that is still outstanding or has not been remedied when the initial application for \n[EAD] … is filed will result in a denial of such application.”); (“[T]he asylum officer may \nconsider evidence submitted within the 14–day period prior to the interview date or may grant \nthe applicant a brief extension of time during which the applicant may submit additional \nevidence.  Any such extension will be treated as a delay caused by the applicant for purposes of \n§ 208.7.”).   \nSixth, the Broader EAD Rules allow the agency—for the first time—to deem either a \nfailure to appear for an asylum interview or a biometric services appointment, a newly added \nrequirement in the EAD application process, an “applicant-caused delay” for purposes of § \n208.7(a)(1)(iv).  Compare Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,627 (to be codified at 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.10(a)) (“The failure to appear for an interview or biometric services appointment \n8 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 9 of 69\nmay result in …. [w]aiver of the right to an interview or adjudication; [d]ismissal of the \napplication for asylum; [r]eferral … to the immigration court; or, [d]enial of employment \nauthorization.”) with id. at 38,599 (explaining no such penalties in prior rule).  Under the old \nrules, applicant-caused delays did not result in the agency’s denial of an EAD application but \nrather tolled the 180-day EAD clock.  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.4(c) and 208.9(e) (effective until \nAugust 25, 2020) (“[A]ny delay caused by such request shall extend the period within which the \napplicant may not apply for employment authorization in accordance with § 208.7(a).”); (An \n“asylum officer may grant the applicant a brief extension of time following an interview during \nwhich the applicant may submit additional evidence. Any such extension shall extend by an \nequivalent time the periods specified by § 208.7 for the filing and adjudication of any \nemployment authorization application.”).    \nSeventh, an EAD will be denied to anyone who has not filed for asylum within one year \nof entering the United States,4 unless and until an asylum officer or immigration judge finds \napplicable one of the statutory exceptions to the one-year filing bar.  Compare Broader EAD \nRules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.7 (a)(1)(iii)(F)) (making ineligible \nfor purposes of EAD an asylee who filed his or her asylum application on or after August 25, \n2020 and “filed after the one-year filing deadline, unless and until the asylum officer or \nimmigration judge determines that the applicant meets an exception for late filing … or unless \nthe applicant was an unaccompanied child on the date the asylum application was first filed.”) \nwith 8 C.F.R. § 208.7 (effective until August 25, 2020) (no such restriction).   \n  Eighth, the Broader EAD Rules require applicants to submit biometric information—\nincluding fingerprints, photographs, and signatures—at a scheduled biometric services \n \n4 This new rule does not apply to unaccompanied minors.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,533 \n(explaining the “the one-year filing deadline does not apply to unaccompanied alien children”).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 10 of 69\nappointment.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. 38,626 (June 26, 2020) (to be codified at 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.7) (“The applicant must request employment authorization … in the manner \nprescribed by USCIS … and must submit biometrics at a scheduled biometrics services \nappointment.”).  Applicants will also be required to pay a fee of $85 for this service.  See id. at \n38,576 (“DHS anticipates that the biometrics fee that (c)(8) EAD applicants will pay… at least \n$30 and no more than $85.”).  The new biometric rule and fees will apply to both the asylum and \nEAD applications.  See id. at 38,599 (“no such requirement” but “there is a requirement to \nsubmit biometrics with an asylum application.”).  \nThe remaining rule changes introduce a host of individual “disqualifying” events that \nlimit access to EAD authorization.  They include refusal to grant EAD to any applicant who \ncrosses into the United States anywhere but an authorized port of entry, absent certain \nexceptions, see Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 ((to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § \n208.7(a)(1)(iii)(G)); disqualification for having sustained a conviction for a “particularly serious \ncrime” or where there is “serious” evidence suggesting the applicant committed a “serious non-\npolitical crime” outside the United States, id. (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1)(iii)(B)-\n(C)); earlier termination of EAD once the underlying asylum application is denied, see id. at \n38,599, 38,627-28 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(b) and § 274a.13(d)(3)); and terminating \nEAD authorization after two years in all cases, see id. at 38,599, 38,627 (to be codified at 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.7(b)(1)).     \nB.  The Plaintiffs  \nThe five organization Plaintiffs take umbrage with the eighteen separate rule changes, \nand thus ask this Court to enjoin their enforcement wholesale.  The named Plaintiff, CASA, is \nthe largest member-driven organization with over 100,000 members and whose mission is to \n10 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 11 of 69\nassist immigrants in relocating to the United States lawfully.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 2-3.  Since its \nfounding in 1985, CASA has provided social, health, job training, employment, and legal \nservices to immigrant and refugee communities in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  Id. ¶¶ \n3-5.  Most of CASA’s services are offered only to members at a reduced cost.  Id.  Its members \npay an annual membership fee between $35 and $40, which in turn allows them to take \nadvantage of CASA’s various services.  Id. ¶ 8.  CASA members are part of the organization’s \nleadership and are active participants in the organization’s advocacy and development efforts.  \nId. ¶¶ 7-8.  Thousands of CASA’s members have applied for asylum and work authorization.  Id. \n¶ 9.  \nASAP, too, is a member-driven organization.  It currently retains over 4,000 members, \nthe majority of whom are mothers who sought asylum at the Mexico-U.S. border, were initially \ndetained by border agents, then released and placed in removal proceedings.  ECF No. 24-5 ¶ 7.   \nASAP members live throughout the United States, in over 40 states, and in the District of \nColumbia.  Id. ¶ 9.  ASAP provides its members with “community support and legal services \nregardless of where they are located.”  Id. ¶ 4.    \nThe remaining three organizations, Centro Legal de la Raza (“Centro Legal”), Oasis \nLegal Services (“Oasis”), and Pangea Legal Services (“Pangea”), are non-profit organizations \nwhose missions include providing to asylum seekers direct legal representation as well as other \nsocial and educational services.  While each organization has a slightly different business model, \nthey primarily offer pro-bono immigration related legal services.  See generally ECF No. 24-6; \nECF No. 24-7; ECF No. 24-8.  Centro Legal provides direct legal services, hosts educational \ntrainings for lawyers and clients, and engages in advocacy efforts.  ECF No. 24-6 ¶¶ 2, 3, 17-19, \n24.   It also partners with local law firms to host single-day workshops for asylum seekers who \n11 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 12 of 69\nneed help preparing their asylum or EAD applications.  Id. ¶¶ 1-4, 17.  Centro Legal does not \ncharge clients for any of its services.  Id. ¶ 25.   \nOasis provides direct legal services to clients in the San Francisco Bay area.  ECF No 24-\n7 ¶¶ 3, 44.  It operates on a “low bono/pro bono model,” in which it uses a sliding scale based on \na client’s income.  Id. ¶ 44.  For an asylum case, its fees range from $0 to $4000, and its clients \nare only expected to pay what they can afford.  Id.  Many of its clients can afford Oasis’ services \nonce they receive an EAD and find lawful employment.  Id.  \nPangea is a nonprofit organization focused on direct legal services and advocacy work for \nimmigrant populations, including asylees.  ECF No 24-8 ¶¶ 2, 4.  It provides services to its \nclients either at a low cost or free of charge.  Id.  For clients who do not qualify for free services, \nPangea typically charges $200 to prepare an EAD application.  Id. ¶¶ 10, 38.   \nAll five Plaintiffs aver that the challenged rules frustrate their missions by requiring \ndiversion of already-precious time and resources to processing as many asylum and EAD \napplications as possible before the challenged rules took effect.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶¶ 29-30; ECF \nNo. 24-5 ¶¶ 35-36; ECF No. 24-6 ¶¶ 20-23; ECF No. 24-7 ¶¶ 36-38; ECF No. 24-8 ¶ 12.  \nPlaintiffs also assert that with far stricter rules now in place, each organization will have to \ndevote more time and resources to counsel their clients properly and then prepare their \napplications.  See, e.g., ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 36.  Oasis specifically maintains that because it derives a \nthird of its revenue from its clients—many of whom only become paying clients once they are \nwork-approved—the challenged rules “jeopardize” its “ability to stay open.”  Id. ¶ 46.   \nThe Complaint and accompanying declarations identify five individual members—three \nfrom CASA and two from ASAP—for whom the Asylum EAD Rules will adversely affect their \n12 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 13 of 69\nprospects of obtaining an EAD.5  ASAP member, W.L., fled Guatemala with her eight-year-old \nson after being raped repeatedly and then threatened with death by a man whose prominence in \nGuatemala allowed him to evade arrest.  ECF No. 1 ¶ 7.  W.L. currently shares a single room \nwith her children and is supported by family.  Id.  W.L. filed her asylum application on April 3, \n2020.  Id. ¶ 8.  Under the old rules, she would have been eligible to apply for an EAD by August \n31 and have her application processed within 30 days.  Id.  Also, under the old rules, the agency \nwas required to issue her an EAD provided she is work-eligible.  W.L. planned to work either at \na local church, or another stable job once she could do so legally.  Id.     \nUnder the challenged rules, W.L. will be forced to wait at least seven more months before \nshe can even apply for an EAD.  Id. ¶ 9.  She must then wait an indeterminate length of time for \nUSCIS to process her application.  As a result, W.L. is stripped of opportunity for gainful \nemployment necessary to feed, clothe, and house her children or hire an immigration attorney to \npursue her asylum claim.  Id.   \nASAP member N.G. escaped Honduras with her daughter and entered the U.S. in May \n2019.  Id. ¶ 134; ECF No. 24-5 ¶ 26.  N.G. filed for asylum in April of this year.  ECF No. 1 ¶ \n133.  Under the old rules, N.G. would have been eligible to apply for work authorization this \nmonth but will now have to wait at least seven more months to apply and an indeterminate time \nuntil she hears back from the agency.  See id.; see also Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg at 38, \n626 (to be codified at §§ 208.7(a)(1)(ii) and 274a.13(a)(1)).  In the meantime, N.G. has been \nunable to work, secure stable housing, alleviate her family’s food insecurity, or hire a lawyer to \nassist with her asylum application.  ECF No. 1 ¶ 134.  N.G. and her daughter have survived on \nthe generosity of others.  Id.  \n \n5 Four of these individuals are specifically identified in the Complaint, while the fifth, H.V., is discussed only in \nCASA’s submitted declaration.  See ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 23.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 14 of 69\nCASA member, M.C., came to the United States in December 2017 after fleeing \nHonduras with her eleven-year-old daughter.  Id. ¶ 131; ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 25.  M.C. found a place \nto live with a man who ended up abusing her and preventing her from applying for asylum \nwithin one year after her arrival.  Id.  As of the filing of the Complaint, CASA was helping M.C. \nprepare and submit her asylum application.  Id. ¶ 26.   \nCASA member, H.V., has struggled to find work without an EAD since arriving with her \nfour-year-old daughter in May 2019.  Id. ¶ 23.  That hardship—exacerbated by the lasting effects \nof the trauma that required her to flee Honduras—has prevented H.V. from finding a lawyer and \napplying for asylum before the challenged rules went into effect.  Id.  Given that H.V. will \nsubmit her asylum application after August 25, 2020, she is now ineligible under the challenged \nrules to receive pre-asylum work authorization unless and until an immigration judge concludes \nthat she has demonstrated “good cause” for filing beyond the one-year deadline.  See Broader \nEAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626.  The practical effect is that H.V. will be deprived any \nopportunity to receive work authorization timely and in advance of adjudication of her asylum \napplication.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 23.    \nA.O., a Venezuelan national who entered the U.S. on a non-immigrant visitor’s visa in \nDecember 2019, is also a CASA member.  ECF No. 1 ¶ 132.  A former journalist in Venezuela, \nA.O. and her family fled Venezuela and are now seeking asylum from protracted physical \nviolence and threats after publicly opposing President Nicolás Maduro.  Id.  CASA is now \nassisting A.O. with submitting her asylum application.  Id.  She too will have to wait a \nsignificantly longer time to obtain an EAD under the new rules.  Id.                           \nII.  Procedural Background \nOn July 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, attacking the entirety of the challenged \nrules.  ECF No. 1.  They soon after moved for a stay of the challenged rules or alternatively for a \n14 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 15 of 69\nnationwide injunction pending resolution on the merits.  ECF No. 23-1.  In support of their \nrequested relief, they make three bold and complicated arguments.   \nFirst, they argue that Wolf’s appointment and tenure as Acting DHS Secretary violate \nsection 3346 of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”).  Id. at 27.  With certain \nexceptions, the FVRA generally bars acting officials from serving for more than 210 days in a \nposition that requires Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation (“PAS”).  See 5 U.S.C. § \n3346.  The last Senate-confirmed DHS Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen (“Nielsen”), resigned on April \n10, 2019.  ECF No. 41-1 at 44-45.  Acting Secretary Wolf did not assume the role of Acting \nSecretary until his predecessor, Kevin McAleenan, resigned on November 13, 2019—217 days \nafter Nielsen resigned and the office first became vacant.  ECF No. 23-1 at 34; ECF No. 41-1 at \n71.  Thus, according to Plaintiffs, the FVRA timing provision applies to Wolf’s designation, \nWolf acted beyond the 210-day FRVA time limit when promulgating the challenged rules, and \nthus the FVRA demands vacatur of the rules.  ECF No. 23-1 at 33.    \nSecond, Plaintiffs assert Wolf’s appointment violated the succession provisions of the \nagency’s enabling statute, the Homeland Security Act (“HSA”).  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  The HSA \nstatutorily sets an order of succession in the event of a vacancy, id. §§ 113(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(F) \nand (g)(1), and if such pre-identified positions are vacant, allows the Secretary to designate a \n“further order of succession,” id. § 113(g)(2).  However, because the installation of Wolf’s \npredecessor, Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, contravened Secretary Nielsen’s order of \nsuccession, McAleenan’s later amendment of the order was unlawful, as was Wolf’s ascension.   \nECF No. 23-1 at 34-37.   \n  Third, Plaintiffs contend that the agency’s rulemaking process violated the APA.  Id. at \n16-31.  They challenge the new rules as procedurally deficient and as arbitrary and capricious.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 16 of 69\nAs for the Timeline Repeal Rule, Plaintiffs maintain that the agency’s elimination of any \nprocessing deadline lacked a reasoned basis and runs counter to the agency’s stated rationale for \nimplementing the rules.  See id.   \n  With only 28 days from the request for injunctive relief to the effective date of the \nTimeline Repeal Rule—and the Broader EAD Rules scheduled to go into effect four days after \nthat—the Court put the parties and itself on an expedited briefing schedule.  ECF No. 28.6  \nHowever, as is often the case lately with challenges to executive agency action, the sands shifted \nin the legal landscape during briefing.  \n  On August 5, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued its \ndecision in Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, No. 19-2222, 2020 WL 4664820 (4th Cir. Aug. 5, \n2020), which addressed questions of standing and the propriety of issuing the very nationwide \ninjunction that the Plaintiffs press here.  To complicate matters further, the parties had not \nbriefed standing, a fundamental question invoking this Court’s jurisdiction to hear the case at all.  \nSee ECF Nos. 23-1 & 41.  With five organizations challenging the entirety of eighteen rule \nchanges, it was incumbent upon the Court to require further briefing and argument on standing.  \nECF No. 53.   \n  Also, on the morning of the first hearing, the U.S. Government Accountability Office \n(“GAO”) issued its advisory opinion that Wolf had taken office as Acting Secretary in violation \nof the applicable succession order and thus has been acting without lawful authority.  ECF No. \n51-1 (U.S. Government Accountability Office Decision, Department of Homeland Security—\nLegality of Service of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official \n \n6 The Court also permitted the Constitutional Accountability Center (ECF No. 38); Kids in Need of Defense (ECF \nNo. 39); Morton Rosenberg (ECF No. 40); the District of Columbia and State of New York (ECF No. 42); and \nOxfam America and the University of Maryland Carey Immigration Clinic (ECF No. 43) to file briefs as Amici \nCurae. \n16 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 17 of 69\nPerforming the Duties of Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (Aug. 14, 2020)).  The GAO’s \ndecision mirrored many of the arguments Plaintiffs had put before the Court, although neither the \nparties nor the Court had any meaningful opportunity to digest the decision.  Most pertinent to \nthis case, the Government could not yet take a position on its impact.  ECF No. 56 at 16-17.  The \nCourt, therefore, requested additional briefing related to the validity of Wolf’s appointment, and \nthus his authority to promulgate the challenged rules.  See ECF Nos. 53 & 64.     \n  Lastly, the Court was mindful that the additional briefing and careful consideration of \nthese fundamental issues would mean that this opinion could not issue prior to the challenged \nRules taking effect on August 21 and 25, 2020 respectively.  The Court thus allowed briefing on \nthe Plaintiffs’ urgent plea for a “stay” to issue pursuant to section 705 of the APA.  ECF No. 53.  \nThe Government rightly responded that a section 705 stay, in effect, functions similarly to a \npreliminary injunction and so it would not contest this Court’s power to issue such a stay after \nthe effective date of the challenged rules.  ECF No. 55.   \n  The Court conducted a subsequent hearing on August 28, 2020, and allowed further \nexpedited briefing.  ECF No. 64.  Based on a careful consideration of the parties’ submissions, \nand for the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief is granted as to some, but \nnot all, of the challenged rules.   \nIII.  Standing  \nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must determine whether the Plaintiffs have standing to \nbring this case.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Pursuant to \nArticle III of the United States Constitution, federal courts are of limited jurisdiction, hearing \nonly live “cases” and “controversies.”  Id. at 559; U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  A legal action meets \nthe case-or-controversy requirement where the “questions [are] presented in an adversary \ncontext.”  Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 516 (2007) (quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. \n17 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 18 of 69\n83, 95 (1968)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Standing “must be supported in the same way \nas any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and \ndegree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.” Overbey v. Mayor of \nBaltimore, 930 F.3d 215, 227 (4th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted).  “Thus, when a defendant \nchallenges a plaintiff’s standing, we analyze the challenge differently depending on the stage of \nlitigation at which the challenge is brought and the substance of the defendant’s arguments.”  Id.   \nBecause the Government challenges standing “on the pleadings, [the court will] accept as \ntrue all material allegations of the complaint and construe the complaint in favor of the \ncomplaining party.’”  Deal v. Mercer Cty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, 187 (4th Cir. 2018) \n(quoting S. Walk at Broadlands Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 \nF.3d 175, 181–82 (4th Cir. 2013)).  Plaintiffs also have submitted detailed declarations regarding \nthe structure and function of their organizations and the challenged rules’ impact on selected \nmembers.  The Court construes such facts most favorably to Plaintiffs when assessing whether \njurisdiction is proper.  See Lizarbe v. Rondon, 642 F. Supp. 2d 473, 479 (D. Md. 2009) (citing \nVelasco v. Gov’t of Indonesia, 370 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir. 2004)).   \nStanding “is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of \nArticle III.”  Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 733 (2008) (citations omitted).   It requires a plaintiff \nto have “suffered an injury in fact that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant,” and “likely . . . [to] be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Bishop v. Bartlett, 575 \nF.3d 419, 423 (4th Cir. 2009) (quotations omitted).  A plaintiff must have a cognizable and \nredressable injury as to “each claim” presented and “each form of relief” sought.  Davis, 554 \nU.S. at 734 (citations omitted).   In this way, “the standing inquiry remains focused on whether \n18 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 19 of 69\nthe [plaintiff] … ha[s] the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed.”  Id. (citations \nomitted).   \nPlaintiffs argue that standing is proper under two alternative yet related theories.  They \neach claim organizational standing to pursue injuries sustained to the organization directly, as \nwell as associational standing to pursue claims on behalf of their members.  Each theory, they \nargue, confers standing as to all claims applicable to all eighteen rules.  The Court, therefore, \nmust determine whether any one Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated either organizational \nstanding or representational standing to challenge each rule change.  See Casa de Maryland, \n2020 WL 4664820, at *10; Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 370 (4th Cir. 2014) (citing Dep’t of \nCommerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, 525 U.S. 316, 330 (1999) (holding that a case is \njusticiable if some, but not necessarily all, of the plaintiffs have standing as to a particular \ndefendant); Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst. Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2, (2006) (“[T]he \npresence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article Ill's case-or-controversy \nrequirement.”)).  The Court concludes that no Plaintiff has organizational standing but two \nPlaintiffs, CASA and ASAP, maintain representational standing to challenge certain Asylum \nEAD rules. \nA.  Organizational Standing  \nOrganizational standing is conferred when an organization must show it has suffered an \n“injury in fact,” in that defendant’s “actions impede its efforts to carry out its mission.”  Lane v. \nHolder, 703 F.3d 668, 674 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. \n363, 379 (1982)); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975).  Organizational standing, \ntherefore, derives from injury the organization itself has suffered.  In this respect, the Fourth \nCircuit recently clarified that an organization’s “voluntary budgetary” choices or shifts in \n19 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 20 of 69\npriorities do not constitute a constitutionally cognizable injury.  See Casa de Maryland, 2020 \nWL 4664820, at *9.  This is because “[o]rganizational injury … is measured against a group’s \nability to operate as an organization, not its theoretical ability to effectuate its objectives in its \nideal world.”  Id.  \n   Plaintiffs respond that they have suffered the same type of direct injury that conferred \nstanding in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman.  ECF No. 66 at 2-3.  The Court disagrees.  In \nHavens, the plaintiff organization, “HOME,” provided counseling and referral services to its \nminority clients in an effort to promote equal opportunity in housing.  455 U.S. at 368.  The \nSupreme Court found that HOME had standing because the defendant’s alleged practices \n“perceptibly impaired” its “ability to provide counseling and referral services for low and \nmoderate-income homeseekers.”  Id. at 379.   \n  Plaintiffs maintain that, like HOME, each has organizational standing because the \nchallenged rules frustrate their missions.  ECF No. 59 at 1; ECF No. 62-1 at 2.  Each \norganization describes the same injury but in different terms: that the rules have already required \nthem—and will continue to require them—to devote significantly more time and resources to \nunderstanding the rule changes, advising their staff attorneys and clients accordingly, and then \nprocessing asylum and EAD applications at the expense of other clients they serve and other \nimportant services offered.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶¶ 29-30; ECF No. 24-5 ¶ 35; ECF No. 24-6 ¶¶ 20-23; \nECF No. 24-7 ¶ 36; ECF No. 24-8 ¶ 25.  The Rules, in short, put further strain on their already \nprecious time and resources.   \nThis financial strain, however, does not constitute a cognizable injury.  A “diversion of \nresources might harm the organization by reducing the funds available for other purposes, [but] \n‘it results not from any actions taken by [the defendant], but rather from the [organization’s] own \n20 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 21 of 69\nbudgetary choices.’”  Lane, 703 F.3d at 675 (quoting Fair Emp’t Council of Greater \nWashington, Inc. v. BMC Mktg. Corp., 28 F.3d 1268, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994)).  As the Fourth \nCircuit made clear in Lane, prioritization of resources to combat a perceived ill does not \nconstitute cognizable injury: “To determine that an organization that decides to spend its money \non educating members, responding to member inquiries, or undertaking litigation in response to \nlegislation suffers a cognizable injury would be to imply… that any sincere plaintiff could \nbootstrap standing by expending its resources in response to actions of another.”  Lane, 703 F.3d \nat 675 (citations omitted).   \nAny potential doubt as to the proper reading or scope of Lane is extinguished by the \nFourth Circuit’s recent decision in Casa.  See 2020 WL 4664820, at *9.  There, the Fourth \nCircuit cautioned that “standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant’s interest or the \nfervor of his advocacy.”  Id. (internal citations omitted).  It distinguished between “voluntary \nexpenditure of resources to counteract governmental action” and governmental action that \n“directly impairs” an organization’s ability to “provide counseling, referral, or other services to \nimmigrants.”  Id.   \nIn light of this clear guidance, and on the current record, the Court cannot find that any \none Plaintiff has organizational standing.  The Plaintiff organizations aver facts that are \nindistinguishable from those averred in Casa: that each will experience the financial impact of \nchoosing to reallocate resources to help its members respond to the challenged rules.  See id.  But \nnone aver the kind of direct impairment necessary to confer standing.  Making voluntary choices \nabout redirecting resources does not suffice.  See id.  (“CASA’s unilateral and uncompelled \nresponse to the shifting needs of its members cannot manufacture an Article III injury.”).7   \n \n7 The Court recognizes that as the record currently stands, Plaintiff Oasis has inched substantially farther than the \nothers, given that its business model relies on asylee clients to be able to pay at some point, and that many can only \n21 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 22 of 69\nB.  Representational Standing  \nRepresentational standing, in contrast, concerns injury suffered by an organization’s \nmembers as opposed to the organization itself.  To establish representational standing, the \norganization must establish that: “(1) its own members would have standing to sue in their own \nright; (2) the interests the organization seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s \npurpose; and (3) neither the claim nor the relief sought requires the participation of individual \nmembers in the lawsuit.”  S. Walk, 713 F.3d at 184 (citing Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. \nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).  This requires that the organization put forward facts to \nmake plausible that “at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.”  S. \nWalk, 713 F.2d at 184.  \nOn the current record, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs CASA and ASAP have \ndemonstrated representational standing vis-à-vis their individual members.  Specifically, when \nconstruing the facts alleged most favorably to the Plaintiffs, the members have alleged injury \narising from enactment of the Timeline Repeal Rule8 and five of the Broader EAD Rules:  \n•  The 365-day waiting period, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626-28 (referenced throughout and \nas codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.3(c)(3); § 208.7(a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(iii)(E), and (b)(1)(i); \nand § 274a.12(c)(8));  \n \n•  Removal of “deemed-complete” rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.3) (omitting instruction that if the agency has not “mailed the incomplete \napplication back to the applicant within 30 days, it shall be deemed complete.”).   \n \n•  The discretionary review rule, providing that agency is no longer required to issue \nEADs to eligible asylees, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,628 (changes reflected at 8 C.F.R. § \n274a.13(a)(1)).  \n \ndo so once they have obtained an EAD.  In this way, Oasis’ financial concerns do not relate to voluntary \nexpenditures but rather the organization’s future revenue streams.  But where Lane and Casa de Maryland \nemphasized the difference between the direct and indirect effects of governmental action, the Court finds that Oasis’ \ntheory—that it will suffer the downstream effects of the direct, financial injury to its asylee clients—cannot confer \nstanding.   \n \n8 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,545 (printing parts of the regulations to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1)) (omitting \nlanguage stating that agency has 30-day processing deadline).  \n22 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 23 of 69\n \n•  The one-year filing bar, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. § \n208.7(a)(1)(iii)(F)).  \n \n•  The rule requiring submission of biometric information as part of EAD \napplications, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1)(i) and \n(a)(1)(iv)(E); and § 208.10). \n \nThe identified members will suffer concrete and particularized injury arising from this \nsubset of the challenged rules which add economic burdens to the application process and \nindefinitely delay or deny advance work authorization.  See, e.g., ECF No. 24-6 ¶¶ 11-12 \n(explaining how delay or denial of EAD will exacerbate “physical or mental harm” and \nexacerbate already existent “economic insecurity”).  With many asylees waiting years for their \nunderlying asylum claims to be adjudicated—and no assurance under the new rules as to whether \nor when they will ever hear from the agency regarding their EAD application—these new rules \nalso undermine the applicants’ ability to pursue their asylum claims, and may well result in some \nof them abandoning such claims altogether.   \nAs to the remaining elements of representational standing, both CASA and ASAP easily \nsatisfy them.  See S. Walk, 713 F.3d at 184.  The interest of these individual members squarely \nwithin CASA and ASAP’s respective missions, and each devote significant time and resources to \nrepresenting asylees as they navigate the EAD and asylum application process.  See id. (interests \nmust be “germane” to organization’s purpose).  As to the third prong, Plaintiffs’ legal challenges \ndo not require the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.  Id.  Plaintiffs seek the \nultimate remedy of setting aside the rules, not money damages or other remedy that requires the \nindividual member to join the litigation as a party.  See ECF Nos. 1 & 23.  Thus, with each prong \nsatisfied, the Court concludes CASA and ASAP have demonstrated representational standing on \nthe current record. \n23 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 24 of 69\nThe Court settled on the above-identified rules after concluding that at least one \nidentified member would have individual standing in her own right to challenge each of these \nrule changes.  See Casa de Maryland, 2020 WL 4664820, at *9 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. \nv. Laidlaw Envt’l. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 183–84 (2000)).  Unsurprisingly, Plaintiffs oppose \nthe Court’s winnowing down of their claims.  Instead, they offer a theory of standing that would \ntreat the Broader EAD Rules as a “package” whereby this Court may reach all seventeen rule \nchanges, because some of them will work a concrete and particularized harm on their five \nmembers.  ECF Nos. 64 & 66.  This theory cannot be squared with the well-established \nrequirement that to have standing a plaintiff must state a cognizable and redressable injury as to \n“each claim” presented and “each form of relief” sought.  See Davis, 554 U.S. at 734 (to \nchallenge two different subsections within the same statutory provision, plaintiff needed to show \na cognizable injury flowing from the application of each subsection).   \nCertain rule changes help illustrate the point.  For instance, one of the challenged rules \nprohibits pre-asylum work authorization for any applicant who enters the United States on or \nafter August 25, 2020, at a place other than an authorized port of entry (the “unlawful entry \nbar”).  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § \n208.7(a)(1)(iii)(G)).  Each of the five members identified entered the U.S. long before August \n25, and so they do not appear subject to this prohibition.   Thus, this Court strains to see how this \nrule change visits any harm on Plaintiffs.  To the extent it does, Plaintiffs have not identified “at \nleast one member” who has or will be harmed by this rule change, as required under the \napplicable pleading standards.  S. Walk, 713 F.2d at 184.   \nSimilarly, another rule change broadens the category of criminal convictions that \ndisqualify an applicant from receiving an EAD.  See id. (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § \n24 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 25 of 69\n208.7(a)(1)(iii)(B)-(C)).  But no member appears to have criminal records or pending charges.  \nThis Court cannot divine how this rule change would visit any harms on them.  When \nrepresentational standing is the only basis on which this Court has jurisdiction, the Court simply \ncannot endorse challenge to a wide swath of rule changes that bear no relation to the harms that \ntheir identified members have suffered.9   \nWith standing established as to six identified rules, the Court next turns to the merits of \nPlaintiffs motion.  See Casa de Maryland, 2020 WL 4664820, at *10 (finding jurisdiction where \nonly some parties adequately alleged a constitutionally cognizable injury); see also Casa de \nMaryland v. DHS, 924 F.3d 684, 701 n.14 (4th Cir. 2019) (finding that because certain \nindividual plaintiffs have standing, Court need not consider whether other plaintiffs also have \nstanding).  \nIV.  Standard of Review for Requested Injunctive Relief  \nA preliminary injunction “is a stopgap measure, generally limited as to time, and \nintended to maintain a status quo or ‘to preserve the relative positions of the parties’” pending \nfinal judicial review.  Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 781–82 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Univ. \nof Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981)).  Because a preliminary injunction often issues \non an incomplete record and, in the context of agency rulemaking, compels the defendant to act \nor refrain from acting on such rules, the Court must proceed with a healthy appreciation for the \nsubstantial dangers inherent in granting such extraordinary relief.   See Hughes Network Sys., \nInc. v. InterDigital Commc’ns Corp., 17 F.3d 691, 693 (4th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).  For \nthis reason, a preliminary injunctive is warranted only upon “a clear showing that the plaintiff is \nentitled to relief.”  Dewhurst v. Century Aluminum Co., 649 F.3d 287, 290 (4th Cir. 2011) \n \n9 Had Plaintiffs carried their burden to demonstrate the Broader EAD rules were non-severable, see infra pp. 67-68, \nthey may have otherwise maintained standing to challenge the rules package entirely. \n25 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 26 of 69\n(quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).   \nA preliminary injunction must not issue unless the Plaintiffs demonstrate, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, four well-established factors: (1) a likelihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) a likelihood of suffering irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that \nthe balance of equities tips in the party’s favor; and (4) that issuing the injunction is in the public \ninterest.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20; Dewhurst, 649 F.3d at 290.  At this stage, the first factor is \nthe “most important” one.  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Where the \ngovernment is a party, the final two factors merge.  See Kravitz v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 366 \nF. Supp. 3d 681, 755 (D. Md. 2019) (quoting Pursuing Am. Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016)).   \nSimilarly, pursuant to section 705 of the APA, a reviewing court may stay “agency \naction” pending judicial review “to prevent irreparable injury.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  “The factors \ngoverning issuance of a preliminary injunction also govern issuance of a § 705 stay.”  Dist. of \nColumbia v. Dep’t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2020), appeal filed, No. 20-5136 \n(D.C. Cir. filed May 15, 2020) (citations omitted); see Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 424, 435 (5th \nCir. 2016); Humane Soc’y of United States v. Gutierrez, 558 F.3d 896, 896 (9th Cir. 2009); \nAssoc. Sec. Corp. v. SEC, 283 F.2d 773, 774–75 (10th Cir. 1960); Virginia Petroleum Jobbers \nAss’n v. Fed. Power Comm’n, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958) (per curiam); Cronin v. U.S. \nDep’t of Agric., 919 F.2d 439, 446 (7th Cir. 1990) (“The standard is the same whether a \npreliminary injunction against agency action . . . or a stay of that action is being sought.”); see \nalso South Carolina v. United States, 907 F.3d 742, 756 (4th Cir. 2018) (comparing the court’s \n26 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 27 of 69\ndiscretion under section 705 to stay rules pending final review with its mandatory obligation to \nset aside unlawful agency action under section 706).  \nWith this framework in mind, the Court addresses each of the four Winter factors \nseparately.  \nA.  Likelihood of Success on Merits  \nFor purposes of this motion, Plaintiffs argue they will succeed on three claims, each of \nwhich renders the challenged rules a nullity.  Plaintiffs first argue that because Acting Secretary \nWolf promulgated the challenged rules in violation of the FVRA, they “have no force and \neffect.”  ECF No. 23-1 at 33.  Second, and alternatively, the rules are null and void because \nWolf’s ascension to the position of Acting DHS Secretary violated the agency’s succession \norder.  Id. at 34.  Third, the rules are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, U.S.C. § \n706(2).   Id. at 16.  The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs need only demonstrate success on the \nmerits of one claim.  However, because each claim is one of first, or near first, impression, the \nCourt will address each in turn.  \n1.  Challenge under the FVRA \n \n It is undisputed that the office of the DHS Secretary is one subject to Presidential \nnomination and Senate Confirmation, otherwise known as a “PAS” position.  6 U.S.C. § 112(a).  \nThe last time the office of DHS Secretary had been occupied by a PAS officer was April 10, \n2019, when Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen (“Nielsen”) resigned and made way for two successive \nActing Secretaries.10  ECF No. 41 at 29; ECF No. 41-2 at 45.  First, Customs and Border Patrol \nCommissioner, Kevin McAleenan (“McAleenan”), assumed the role of Acting Secretary until he \n \n10 The parties dispute whether Nielsen’s resignation became effective on April 7, 2019, when she announced her \nresignation, or whether it occurred on April 10, 2019, when she took her last action in office.  See ECF No. 23-1 at \n33-34; ECF No. 41 at 29.  The Court does not find it necessary to resolve this factual dispute.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 28 of 69\nresigned on November 13, 2019.  ECF No. 41-1 at 2.  Next, upon McAleenan’s departure, then-\nUnder Secretary of Homeland Security for Strategy, Policy and Plans, Chad Wolf, slotted into \nthe position of Acting Secretary and has served in that capacity ever since.  Id. at 71; ECF No. 41 \nat 32.  All told, as of the writing of this opinion, the DHS has been without a PAS Secretary for \n520 days.    \nAs this vacancy underscores, the confirmation process can be less than a model of \nefficiency.  The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires presidentially appointed \n“Officers of the United States” to receive Senate confirmation, U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.  But \nwhere a vacancy arises and “the President and Senate cannot promptly agree on a replacement,” \nthe ensuing delay risks that the PAS office remains unfilled and its official acts go \n“unperformed.”  N.L.R.B. v. S.W. General, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 929, 934 (2017).  To avoid an \nunnecessary standstill, Congress has enacted legislation (collectively referred to as “vacancies \nacts”), that imports flexibility into an otherwise fixed constitutional requirement.  See id.  These \nvacancy statutes have taken many forms, but they all are animated by a common unifying \nprinciple—the Senate ceding limited authority to the Executive Branch to appoint an interim \nofficer so as to maintain orderly administration of agency functions.  Id. at 935 (citing Act of \nJuly 23, 1868, ch. 227, 15 Stat. 168; Act of Feb. 20, 1863, ch. 45, 12 Stat. 656).   \nPassed in 1868, the original Vacancies Act generally designated the “first or sole \nassistant” as the acting official but gave the President the option to appoint someone “already \nserving in a PAS office.”  Id. (citing 15 Stat. 168).  By 1891, Congress put time limits on such \ninterim appointments to serve for not more than 30 days.  Id. (citing Act of Feb. 6, 1891, ch. 113, \n26 Stat. 733).  Later versions of the Act maintained similar features, including time limitations \non interim service.  See Pub. L. No. 89–554, 80 Stat. 378, 426 (Sept. 6, 1966); Pub. L. No. 100–\n28 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 29 of 69\n398, 102 Stat. 985, 988 (Aug. 17, 1988).  The Acts were amended over time because, as one \nCourt aptly observed, Presidents did “not always compl[y].”  SW General, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 796 \nF.3d 67, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting M. Rosenberg, Congressional Research Service Report for \nCongress, 98–892 A., The New Vacancies Act: Congress Acts to Protect the Senate’s \nConfirmation Prerogative 2–3 (1998)).  \nBy the 1980s, the Executive Branch had taken the position that heads of executive \nagencies retained independent authority apart from the Vacancies Act to temporarily fill PAS \noffices.  See S.W. General, 137 S. Ct. at 935.  To hold agencies accountable, Congress extended \nan olive branch by lengthening the period of acting service to 120 days under the Act, with the \nperiod tolled while a nomination for a PAS was pending.  Id. at 936 (citing Presidential \nTransitions Effectiveness Act, § 7, 102 Stat. 988).  Despite this, “tensions” between timely \nappointment and confirmation of PAS offices and lengthy service of acting officers “did not \nease.”  Id.  In fact, as of the FVRA’s enactment in 1998, roughly 20% of PAS positions were \nfilled by acting officials, many of whom were serving beyond the 120-day limit under the \nVacancies Act.  Id.   But a court’s “sanctioning this conduct . . . was the straw that broke the \ncamel’s back.”  ECF No. 40-1 at 14 (citing Doolin Sec. Sav. Bank, F.S.B. v. Office of Thrift \nSupervision, 139 F.3d 203 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).     \nIn Doolin, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit essentially read the \n1988 Vacancies Act as permitting seriatim temporary appointments that, taken together, allowed \na PAS office to be filled indefinitely by interim officers.  Id. 139 F.3d at 208–09.  In response to \nthis decision, a Senate Committee Report noted that “this portion of the court’s opinion \nnecessitate[d] legislative action.”  S. Rep. No. 105-250, at 6 (1988).  Accordingly, Congress \npassed the FVRA in 1998, which totally replaced the former Vacancies Act.  See Pub. L. No. 105 \n29 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 30 of 69\n-277, Div. C, tit. 1, § 151, 112 Stat. 2681-611-16 (codified at 5 U.S.C.§§ 3345-3349d); see also \nS.W. General, 796 F.3d at 70 (citing 144 Cong. Rec. S6413-14 (daily ed. June 16, 1998) \n(statement of Sen. Thompson)).  As promised, the FVRA fixed the timing problem identified in \nDoolin.  139 F.3d at 208–09.  It made clear that the timing provision—which sets the default \nmaximum length of acting service at 210 days—begins to run from the date the vacancy arises, \nrather than the date when the acting official assumes office.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3346(a)(1).   \nFrom this change, the Plaintiffs argue quite simply that because Wolf became Acting \nSecretary after the 210th day from when the office’s vacancy arose, Wolf assumed office in \nviolation of the FVRA, and thus the challenged rules must be declared “without force and \neffect,” as mandated by the Act.  ECF No. 23-1 at 33.  If it were only that simple.  To understand \nwhy not requires a careful walk-through of the FVRA.  See S.W. General, 796 F.3d at 74. \n(“Throughout the FVRA, the Congress was precise in its use of internal cross-references.”) \n(citations omitted).   \nSection 3345 of the FVRA sets out three avenues for an acting officer to assume a PAS \noffice when a vacancy arises.  The first, known as the default rule, provides: \n(a) If an officer of an Executive agency ... whose appointment to \noffice is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to \nperform the functions and duties of the office— \n \n(1) the first assistant to the office of such officer shall perform the \nfunctions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity \nsubject to the time limitations of section 3346; \n \n5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Section 3345 also permits “the President (and only the \nPresident)” to direct a PAS official to “perform the functions and duties of the vacant office \ntemporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section 3346”; or to “direct an \nofficer or employee of such Executive agency to perform the functions and duties of the vacant \n30 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 31 of 69\noffice temporarily in an acting capacity, subject to the time limitations of section 3346,” if such \nofficer of employee meets certain criteria not relevant here.  Id. § 3345(a)(2) and (a)(3). \nWith regard to an acting officer selected under the default rule or by the President under \n3345, section 3346 provides:  \n(a) Except in the case of a vacancy caused by sickness, the person \nserving as an acting officer as described under section 3345 may \nserve in the office— \n \n(1) for no longer than 210 days beginning on the date the vacancy \noccurs;  \n5 U.S.C. § 3346(a)(1).  Accordingly, notwithstanding certain exceptions not relevant here, a \nperson who is tapped to fill a vacant PAS office pursuant to section 3345 of the FVRA may only \nserve in that “office” for 210 days as measured from the date of vacancy.  See id.   \nHowever, Congress enacted the FVRA against the backdrop of several agency-specific \nsuccession statutes applicable to PAS offices.  See S. Rep. No. 105-250, at 15-17.  To \naccommodate these agency-specific statues, Congress added section 3347.  5 U.S.C. § 3347.  \nKnown as the “exclusivity” provision, section 3347 makes clear that the FVRA is the exclusive \nmechanism for temporary appointments of PAS offices, unless an agency-specific statute \nprovides an alternate method of selection.  Section 3347 states: \n(a)  Sections  3345  and  3346  are  the  exclusive  means  for \ntemporarily  authorizing  an  acting  official  to  perform  the \nfunctions  and  duties  of  any  office  of  an  Executive  agency \n(including the Executive Office of the President, and other than the \nGovernment  Accountability  Office)  for  which  appointment  is \nrequired to be made by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate, unless— \n \n(1) a statutory provision expressly— \n \n(A) authorizes the President, a court, or the head of an Executive \ndepartment, to designate an officer or employee to perform the \nfunctions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting \ncapacity; or \n31 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 32 of 69\n \n(B) designates an officer or employee to perform the functions and \nduties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity \n \nId. § 3347(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, when such an agency-specific succession \nstatute exists, the FVRA is no longer the “exclusive” means, but rather is “a means” of selecting \na person to serve in an acting capacity for a vacant PAS office.  See Hooks v. Kitsap Tenant \nSupport Servs., 816 F.3d 550, 556 (9th Cir. 2016); see also Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, 356 F. Supp. 3d 109, 143 (D.D.C. 2019)(“Agency-specific \nstatutes like the AG Act were expected to operate alongside the FVRA, not to displace it”), aff’d \non other grounds, 920 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam); United States v. Castillo, 772 \nFed. Appx. 11, 13 n.5 (3d Cir. 2019) (collecting cases); cf. United States v. Smith, 962 F.3d 755, \n762–63 n.1 (4th Cir. 2020).  \nCritically, section 3347 also makes clear that when the FVRA operates as the exclusive \nmeans for filling a temporary PAS position via section 3345, the 210-day time limit plainly \napplies.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3347.  Congress took great pains to identify “Sections 3345 and 3346” as \nthe “exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and \nduties of any office … unless” an agency-specific statute authorizes the agency head to designate \nan order of succession.  Id. § 3347(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  Congress thus tied the timing \nprovision of section 3346 only to offices filled under section 3345, and no others.  See id. §§ \n3346, 3347.  \nNext, section 3348, known as the “enforcement mechanism” of the FVRA, limits the \nsanction for violating the FVRA only to those serving pursuant to its specific provisions.  S. Rep. \n105-250, at 17.  Section 3348(b) makes clear that “[u]nless” an officer is performing “in \naccordance with sections 3345, 3346, and 3347,” then the office “shall remain vacant.”  5 U.S.C. \n32 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 33 of 69\n§ 3348(b)(1).  The purpose of 3348(b) is to clarify that any person installed pursuant to the \nFVRA will be considered in lawful service only if compliant with the provisions of the Act, \nincluding the time limitation in section 3346.  After such time, the office is considered vacant.  \nSee id. \nSection 3348(d) also makes clear that as for acts taken by a person selected under the \nFVRA but in excess of the FVRA’s terms have no force and effect.  It states: \n(d)(1) An action taken by any person who is not acting under section \n3345,  3346,  or  3347,  or  as  provided  by  subsection  (b),  in  the \nperformance of any function or duty of a vacant office to which this \nsection and sections 3346, 3347, 3349, 3349a, 3349b, and 3349c \napply shall have no force or effect. \n \nId. § 3348(d)(1).  Thus, where a person selected to serve pursuant to the FVRA exceeds the \nlimits of the FRVA (“not acting” under the relevant provisions) in the performance of a function \nor duty covered by the act (“to which this section and sections 3346, 3347, 3349, 3349a, 3349b, \nand 3349c apply”), then their actions “shall have no force or effect.”  Id.  Importantly, nowhere \ndoes this enforcement provision specify that it applies to those acting officials who serve \npursuant to an exception to the FVRA—one of the agency-specific succession statutes. \nCongress passed the HSA in 2003, five years after enacting the FVRA and clearly with \nthe FVRA in mind.  See Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 103, 116 Stat. 2144 (2002).  After identifying \nother PAS officers serving under the Secretary, Congress expressly designated the Deputy \nSecretary as the official who, for “purposes of subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5” (the \nFVRA), “shall be the Secretary’s first assistant.”  Id.; see also 6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A) (the \nupdated provision but containing identical language).  That Congress used the term “first \nassistant” with reference to the Deputy Secretary is significant.  Historically, each Vacancies Act \nsince 1868 identified the “first assistant” as the most senior and capable official to serve in an \n33 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 34 of 69\nacting capacity as the head of the agency.  See supra pp. 28-29.  And the FVRA’s default \nprovision specifies that the “first assistant” is the officer who “shall” assume the office subject to \nthe time limitations of section 3346.  5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1).  Congress, therefore, unambiguously \nidentified the Deputy Secretary as the officer who will slot into the Secretary position in \naccordance with the default provision of the FVRA, section 3345(a)(1).  See 6 U.S.C. § \n113(a)(1)(A).  In 2016, Congress amended section 113 of the HSA, again with the FVRA as its \nbeacon.  It added that the Under Secretary for Management “shall be first assistant to the Deputy \nSecretary of Homeland Security for purposes of subchapter III of chapter 33 of title 5,” (the \nFVRA).  See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Pub. L. No. 114-328, \n§1903, 130 Stat. 2000, 2672 (2016) (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(F)).  It also added section \n113(g) to address the order of succession applicable solely to the office of the Secretary.  The \nsection reads in its entirety: \n(g) Vacancies \n \n(1)  Absence,  disability,  or  vacancy  of  Secretary  or  Deputy \nSecretary \n \nNotwithstanding chapter 33 of Title 5, the Under Secretary for \nManagement shall serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of \nabsence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor \nDeputy Secretary is available to exercise the duties of the Office of \nthe Secretary. \n \n(2) Further order of succession \n \nNotwithstanding chapter 33 of Title 5, the Secretary may designate \nsuch other officers of the Department in further order of succession \nto serve as Acting Secretary. \n \n(3) Notification of vacancies \n \nThe Secretary shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental  Affairs  of  the  Senate  and  the  Committee  on \nHomeland  Security  of  the  House  of  Representatives  of  any \n34 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 35 of 69\nvacancies  that  require  notification  under  sections  3345  through \n3349d of Title 5 (commonly known as the “Federal Vacancies \nReform Act of 1998”). \n \n6 U.S.C. § 113(g).  Thus, section 113(g) set a clear order of succession—the Deputy Secretary \nfollowed by the Under Secretary for Management—pursuant to the FVRA’s default provision, \nsection 3345(a).  But it also established a “further order of succession” as designated by the \nSecretary, in the event that the predetermined “first assistant” offices are both vacant.  Id. § \n113(g)(2).  In this respect, the HSA’s succession provision is uniquely hybrid.  It, at once, \nstatutorily designates the “first assistant”—as well as the back-up “first assistant”—for purposes \nof the FVRA’s default provision, but then also provides a clear “further order of succession” to \ndesignate in advance an “Acting Secretary” to serve where the first assistant positions are vacant.  \nId. § 113(g).  \nAlthough this distinction between “first assistant” and “acting” officers vexes academics, \npractitioners and now judges alike,11 the use of these terms supports that the further order of \nsuccession establishes an alternative and non-exclusive means to filling the office of the \nSecretary.  Id. § 113(g)(2).  Congress knew how to designate expressly who will serve as “first \nassistant,” and it did so in rich tradition.  See id. § 113(a)(1)(A) and (F); see also S. Rep. 105-\n250, at 12.  This Court must credit that Congress uses such terms of art purposely and \nconsistently.  See S.W. General, 796 F.3d at 74.  Had Congress meant to provide a “further order \nof succession” relative to section 3345(a)’s default provision, it could have easily done so by \nusing the term “first assistant.”  It did not.  And this Court cannot rewrite the statute otherwise. \nWith this statutory backdrop in mind, the Court returns to Plaintiffs’ argument.   To \nbegin, Wolf did not assume the position of “Acting Secretary” pursuant to 3345 of the FVRA.  \n \n11 See, e.g., Anne Joseph O’Connell, Actings, 120 Colum. L. Rev. 613 (2020).  \n35 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 36 of 69\nECF No. 41 at 31-32.  As the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, Wolf was not in \none of the statutorily proscribed positions to slot in as “first assistant.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1)(A) \n& (F).  Nor was he tapped by the President.  5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(2)-(a)(3).  Rather, he was named \nin the Secretary’s further order of succession.  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) (“Notwithstanding chapter \n33 of Title 5, the Secretary may designate such other officers of the Department in further order \nof succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”).  The parties do not dispute that Wolf was selected \npursuant to the HSA’s specific succession provision applicable to the office of the Secretary.  \nAccordingly, by the FVRA’s terms, the Court cannot generally extend the FVRA’s timing \nprovisions to a person serving temporarily and in an acting capacity pursuant to an agency-\nspecific statute.   \nHere, Wolf’s designation pursuant to section 113(g)(2) is no exception.  See id.  This \nprovision establishes its own separate mechanism for appointment to be read alongside the \nFVRA.  But unlike certain other succession statutes, nowhere does this subsection (g)(2) itself \nestablish any length of service for those who assume the position of “Acting Secretary,” 12 as \nopposed to “first assistant.”  Cf. 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345, 3346.  Nor does the language of the provision \npermit importing the timing and sanction provisions of the FRVA to the further order of \nsuccession.  See 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  Thus, the Court cannot find that Wolf’s tenure \ncontravenes the FVRA, despite his serving well past the FVRA’s 210-day time frame. \nPlaintiffs respond, rightly, that this reading imposes no time limitations for those who \n \n12 Notably in other agency specific succession statutes, Congress has provided time limits on interim service.  See, \ne.g., 29 U.S.C. § 153(d) (acting officer may not serve in position of General Counsel for the National Labor \nRelations Board for “more than forty days when the Congress is in session … or after the adjournment sine die of \nthe session of the Senate in which such nomination was submitted.”); 28 U.S.C. § 546 (providing that acting U.S. \nAttorney may serve until the earlier of the “the qualification of a United States attorney for such district appointed \nby the President …. or the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General”); 44 U.S.C. § 304 (“A \nvacancy occasioned by death or resignation may not be filled temporarily under this section for longer than ten days, \nand a temporary appointment, designation, or assignment of another officer may not be made except to fill a \nvacancy happening during a recess of the Senate.”).   \n36 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 37 of 69\nascend to the position of Acting DHS Secretary pursuant to § 113(g)(2).  Thus, say Plaintiffs, the \nCourt must apply the FVRA 210-day limit to subsection 113(g)(2), so as to avoid an \ninterpretation that may run afoul of Constitution’s Appointments Clause.  ECF No. 66 at 3-4.  \nThe Court acknowledges the tension of crediting an agency succession statute as one that \nprovides “temporary” service that can continue indefinitely.  But for several reasons, this tension \nis not one the Court can or should resolve as Plaintiffs suggest. \nFirst, the Court disagrees that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is triggered here.  \nThe doctrine applies only where a statute is ambiguous, or subject to more than one meaning.  \nSee Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005).  In such circumstance, the Court should \nconstrue the ambiguity in a way that avoids an unconstitutional result.  See id.  That is not this \ncase.  Although the FVRA and HSA are complex, and at times maddening, as to the application \nof the FVRA’s timing and sanction provisions, they are not ambiguous.  Sections 3346 and 3348 \nare cabined to those acting officers serving under section 3345, and neither statute authorizes this \nCourt to extend the FVRA’s timing provision to selections made pursuant to the “further order of \nsuccession” in section 113(g)(2).  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 3345, 3346, 3348; 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  Nor \ndoes section 113 of the HSA include an express timing provision or can be read in a way that \nimports the FVRA’s timing provision to succession under its terms. \nSecond, to the extent the statutes are ambiguous, the FVRA’s legislative history clarifies \nthat Congress never intended to displace agency-specific succession statutes even if such \nprovisions had no time limitation.  See S. Rep. 105-250, at 17.  The Senate Report accompanying \nthe FVRA expressly noted that preexisting agency succession statutes did not “place time \nrestrictions on the length of the acting officer,” and that “the various authorizing committees may \nchoose in the future to reexamine whether these positions should continue to be filled through \n37 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 38 of 69\nthe existing procedure.”  Id.  But nowhere does it articulate an intention to apply the FVRA’s \ntiming provision to such statutes.  Instead, the Report reaffirmed that “even with respect to the \nspecific positions in which temporary officers may serve under the specific statutes this bill \nretains, the Vacancies Act would continue to provide an alternative procedure for temporarily \noccupying the office.”  Id.  Simply put, Congress envisioned the FVRA operating alongside \nagency-specific statutes but not engrafting the FVRA’s requirements onto selections made \npursuant to such statutes.  \nThird, the Court is not as convinced as are Plaintiffs that its reading of the HSA raises \n“serious constitutional doubts,” such that the Court must read the FVRA’s timing provision into \nthe statute.  Clark, 543 U.S. at 381.  The Vacancies Acts have always represented the Senate’s \nceding of its confirmation power to the Executive Branch to ensure continuity in agency \nadministration.  See S.W. General, 137 S. Ct. at 935 (“Since President Washington’s first term, \nCongress has given the President limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily \nperform the functions of a vacant PAS office without first obtaining Senate approval.”).  This is \nparticularly relevant when reading the succession provision here.  Section 113(g) applies solely \nto the head of the agency, the Secretary.  As the chief of DHS, the agency created in the wake of \nthe September 11 attacks to combat terrorism and maintain national security, see 6 U.S.C. § 111, \nit is not unthinkable that Congress would prioritize continuity of service over quick nomination.  \nStated otherwise, to require the office of Secretary be subject to the FVRA could very well risk \nthat the agency’s top office remain “vacant,” and acts taken only to be nullified, if eventual \nnomination for the permanent officer holder falls victim to the delays associated with the \nnomination process.  See S. Rep. 105-250 at 30-31 (“We must be sure that the operation of  \n[3348] does not cause an unintended shutdown of the Federal agency within which the vacancy \n38 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 39 of 69\nexists due to administrative paralysis and that the provision is drafted clearly so that its scope, \nmainly the extent of government functions and duties it would affect, is well understood”). \nPlaintiffs press that reading section 113(g) exclusive of the FVRA and not applying its \ntiming provisions to the “further order of succession” results in the absurdity of the 210-day \nlimitation applying to the Deputy Secretary or Under Secretary of Management (as the “First \nAssistant” under the FVRA), but not to inferior officers selected to serve as Acting Secretary \nunder section 113(g)(2).  ECF No. 66 at 3-4.  Although the point is intuitively appealing, it is \nultimately unavailing.  The “further order of succession” provision is triggered only if the top \nthree positions at the agency are vacant.  See 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2).  Where the agency has been \nstripped of such permanent positions (perhaps because the President has called for their \nresignations and then chosen not to submit nominations), Congress logically would want to \ninstill continuity in the functioning of the agency.  Relaxation of the timing provisions is \ncertainly one way to do so. \nFor the above reasons, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed in establishing that Wolf’s \npromulgation of the challenged rules outside the FVRA’s 210-day time limit requires that this \nCourt declare them without force and effect.  Accordingly, as to this theory of relief, Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for preliminary injunction is denied.   \n2.  Challenge to the Order of Succession \n \nPlaintiffs next argue that because Acting Secretary McAleenan ascended in contravention \nof Secretary Nielsen’s succession order, Delegation Order 01006, McAleenan’s subsequent \nchange to Delegation Order 00106 for Wolf to succeed him as Acting Secretary was issued \nwithout authority.  ECF No. 23-1 at 34.  Thus, say Plaintiffs, the challenged rules have likewise \nbeen enacted “without lawful authority” and must be set aside under section 706 of the APA.  Id. \n39 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 40 of 69\nat 36-37.   \nThe Government does not contest that if the Court credits Plaintiffs’ argument, the rules \nwere promulgated without authority and must be set aside.  ECF No. 65 at 3 (citing 5 U.S.C. § \n706).   Instead, the Government counters, essentially, that Delegation Order 00106 does not \nmean what it says, and that this Court should deduce Nielsen’s true intent to change the \nsuccession order so that McAleenan would replace her, as evident from her contemporaneous \npublic statements and DHS press releases.  ECF No. 41 at 30-31; ECF No. 60 at 4-8.  But \nDelegation Order 00106 is plain, and the Government provides no support for this Court to look \nbeyond the Order itself.  For the following reasons, the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of this claim. \nBroadly speaking, Delegation Order 00106 has been the DHS’ repository for changes to \nthe order of succession for the office of the Secretary and twenty-eight other PAS positions \nwithin the agency.  ECF No. 41-1 at 3-68; see also ECF No. 41 at 30.  First issued by former \nSecretary Jeh Johnson in December 2016, Delegation Order 00106 is updated any time the \nSecretary changes the succession orders.  See ECF No. 41-1 at 3-6.  During Nielsen’s tenure, she \nhad changed Delegation Order 00106 several times by similarly styled amendments.  See id. at 6 \n(showing changes made during Nielsen’s tenure to Annexes G, U, and Z).  However, each \nchange left in place the framework set by Secretary Johnson which had provided succession \norders applicable to two different scenarios.  See id. at 3-6.  The first covered succession in the \nevent of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the office.  See \nid. at 3.  The second covered succession if the Secretary was unavailable to act during a disaster \nor catastrophic emergency.  See id.     \nAt the time of the April 2019 amendment, Delegation Order 00106 stated that in the \n40 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 41 of 69\nevent of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the office, the \norder of succession was governed by Executive Order 13753 (E.O. 13753).  See id. at 3; see also \nECF No. 51-1 at 5.  But for the Secretary’s unavailability during a disaster or catastrophic \nemergency, Delegation Order 00106 referred to a different list, entitled “Annex A.”  See ECF \nNo. 41-1 at 3; see also ECF No. 51-1 at 5.  As of April 2019, however, both succession lists—\nE.O. 13753 and Annex A—happened to list the same offices in the same order.  See ECF No. 51-\n1 at 5.13    \nOn Nielsen’s last day of service, she amended Annex A of Delegation Order 000106, \nwhich applied only to succession “in the event of disaster or emergency.”  Delegation Order \n00106 now read: \nAnnex  A  of  DHS  Orders  of  Succession  and  Delegations  of \nAuthorities for Named Positions, Delegation No. 00106, is hereby \namended by striking the text of such Annex in its entirety and \ninserting  the  following  in  lieu  thereof:  Annex  A.  Order  for \nDelegation of Authority by the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security. \n \nECF No. 41-1 at 70 (emphasis added); see also ECF No. 51-1 at 5-6.14  As for the order of \nsuccession triggered by vacancy, it was unchanged and still referred to E.O. 13753.  See ECF No. \n41-1 at 3; ECF No. 51-1 at 6-7.  \nYet when Nielsen vacated the office, and McAleenan assumed the position of Acting \nSecretary, he was not next in line pursuant to E.O. 13753; Director of the Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Security Agency, Christopher Krebs, was.  See ECF No. 1 ¶ 179; ECF No. 51-1 at \n \n13 The first four offices to assume the role of Acting Secretary either upon vacancy or emergency were: (1) Deputy \nSecretary, (2) Under Secretary for Management, (3) Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA), and (4) Director of CISA.  See ECF No. 51-1 at 5. \n \n14 The Order of succession under new Annex A was: (1) Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security; (2) Under \nSecretary for Management; (3) Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection; (4) Administrator of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency.  \n \n41 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 42 of 69\n8 n.11.15  McAleenan’s leapfrogging over Director Krebs therefore violated the agency’s own \norder of succession.  From this record, the Court cannot help but conclude that McAleenan \nassumed the role of Acting Secretary without lawful authority. \nMcAleenan next amended Delegation Order 00106 on November 8, 2019.  But unlike \nNielsen’s amendment, McAleenan actually changed the order of succession applicable in the \nevent of a vacancy, such that Wolf—then Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans—was \nnext in line to take over as Acting Secretary.  Compare ECF No. 41-1 at 70 with id. at 71.   \nHowever, McAleenan had not lawfully assumed the office of “Acting Secretary,” and because \nonly the Secretary may designate such “further order of succession,” see 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2), \nhis changes to the succession order were likewise without authority.  See also ECF No. 51-1 at 7-\n10.  And because Wolf promulgated the challenged rules without authority, they are likely to be \ninvalidated under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706 (directing courts to “set aside” agency action that \nis “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of … authority”); see also L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, \n442 F. Supp. 3d 1, 35-36 (D.D.C. 2020); see also ECF No. 65 at 3 (Government acknowledging \nthat “if Acting Secretary Wolf were not lawfully serving in an acting capacity under the HSA, \nthe rules challenged here [can] be set aside under the APA.”).   \n  In response, the Government singularly urges the Court to read Nielsen’s April 2019 \namendment to Delegation Order 00106 to also apply in the case of resignation, despite its clear \n \n15 The position of Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs, as designated in E.O. 13753, refers to the \nDirector of CISA. Since the E.O.’s issuance in December 2016, that agency has been re-designated as the \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and its statute instructs that moving forward, the Under Secretary \nfor NPP is the Director of CISA.  See Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. \n115-278, § 2202 132 Stat. 4169 (2018) (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 652) (“Any reference to the National Protection  and \nPrograms Directorate of the Department in any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United  \nStates shall be deemed to be a reference to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.”); (“Any reference \nto an Under Secretary responsible for overseeing critical infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and any other \nrelated program of the Department as described in section 103(a)(1)(H) … shall be deemed to be a reference to the \nDirector of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security of the Department.”).  \n42 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 43 of 69\nlanguage limiting application to disaster and emergency.  ECF No. 41 at 29-31; ECF No. 60 at 4-\n8.  The Government relies on a memorandum from then-General Counsel, John Mitnick, to \nNielsen that accompanied Delegation Order 00106.  ECF No. 41 at 30-31; ECF No. 60 at 4-8.  \nThe memorandum states in pertinent part that “[b]y approving the attached document, you will \ndesignate your desired order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security in accordance \nwith your authority pursuant to Section 113(g)(2) of title 6, United States Code.”  ECF No. 41-2 \nat 5.  That language, says the Government, must be read with the precatory language in \nDelegation Order 00106 which states: “[b]y the authority vested in me as Secretary . . . I hereby \ndesignate the order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security as follows.”  Id. at 6.  \nTogether, the Government says, these preambles support Nielsen’s intention to change both \nsuccession lists, not just Annex A.  ECF No. 41 at 30-31; ECF No. 60 at 4-8.  \n  But this language at best states the obvious—that Nielsen had the authority to change the \nsuccession order as applied to the office of the Secretary.  It does not support that Nielsen \nchanged two separate succession lists applicable to each scenario.  See ECF No. 41-2 at 5-6.  \nMinnick’s memorandum applies with equal force to the changes that Nielsen did make to Annex \nA in that she made them pursuant to her authority under section 113(g).  The memo does nothing \nto undermine the basic proposition that “the plain language [of the Order] … controls [and] \nspeaks for itself.”  ECF No. 51-1 at 9; see also Kingdomware Tech., Inc v. United States, 136 S. \nCt. 1969, 1978 (2016) (“prefatory clauses or preambles cannot change the plain meaning of the \noperative clause.”); DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1908 (2020) \n(stating agency action “must be viewed critically to ensure that the rescission is not upheld on the \nbasis of impermissible post hoc rationalization.”) (citations omitted); see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAssn. of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983) (“[C]ourts may not \n43 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 44 of 69\naccept … post hoc rationalizations for agency action.”) (citations omitted).    \nThe Government next asserts that Delegation Order 00106 is “administrative” and a \n“non-binding document” and so the Court should not accord it any real weight.  ECF No. 41 at \n30.  But oddly, the Government cites no authority—none—for its position.  See id; see also ECF \nNo. 60 at 4-8.  In fact, the parties agree that the Delegation Order 00106 is the only written \nrepository that memorializes Secretary’s changes to the succession orders.  See ECF No. 41 at 30 \nn.10; ECF No. 23-1 at 35.   \nPredictably, the Government next reverts to the April Delegation Order 00106 itself and, \nembracing its force, attempts to spin its text to its advantage.  ECF No. 41-1 at 70; ECF No. 60 at \n4-7.  The Government focuses on the phrase “I hereby designate the order of succession,” and \nconcludes from it that Nielsen must have meant to change E.O. 13753, because Annex A is an \n“Order for Delegation of Authority,” not a succession order.  ECF No. 60 at 5-6 (discussing ECF \nNo. 41-1 at 70).  Thus, the Government contends, Nielsen’s invocation of section 113(g)(2), \nwhich applies to the Acting Secretary’s further order of succession, reflects that Nielsen had \nevery intention of making the same changes to both lists.  ECF No. 60 at 4-7.  Again, the \nGovernment provides no authority for this Court to eschew the plain meaning of Nielsen’s order \nand divine her intent as meaning something else.  Holding senior government officials to their \nword is not an “idle and useless formality.”  Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. at \n1909 (quotations omitted).  As the Supreme Court recently reminded: “[P]articularly when so \nmuch is at stake …. the Government should turn square corners in dealing with the people.”  Id. \n(citations omitted).   For the reasons articulated, the Court finds Nielsen’s order changed Annex \nA, and Annex A only.  \nIn sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to demonstrate McAleenan’s \n44 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 45 of 69\nappointment was invalid under the agency’s applicable order of succession, and so he lacked the \nauthority to amend the order of succession to ensure Wolf’s installation as Acting Secretary.  By \nextension, because Wolf filled the role of Acting Secretary without authority, he promulgated the \nchallenged rules also “in excess of …authority,” and not “in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(C) and (a)(2).  On this ground, therefore, Plaintiffs have established their likely success \non the merits of this claim. \n3.  APA violations  \nThe Court lastly turns to the likelihood of success on Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  ECF No. \n23-1 at 16-31.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  While courts are not to “substitute its judgment for \nthat of the agency,” Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas–Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, \n285 (1974) (quotations omitted), it must ensure the agency has “examine[d] the relevant data and \narticulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action,”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quotations \nomitted).  Courts must “engage in a searching and careful inquiry of the administrative record \n…. [to] consider whether the agency considered the relevant factors and whether a clear error of \njudgment was made.” Casa de Maryland, 924 F.3d at 703 (quotations omitted).  “An agency \naction that ‘entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation \nfor its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it \ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise’ is arbitrary and \ncapricious.”  Gresham v. Azar, 950 F.3d 93, 99 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. \nat 43).   \nThe requirement that an agency engage in reasoned decision-making is further reflected \n45 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 46 of 69\nin the APA’s three-step process for notice-and-comment rulemaking.  See Perez v. Mortgage \nBankers Assoc’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015).  The agency must first “issue a ‘[g]eneral notice of \nproposed rulemaking,’ ordinarily by publication in the Federal Register.”  Id. (citing § 553(b)).  \nSecond, where notice is required, the agency must “give interested persons an opportunity to \nparticipate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments.”  Id. \n(citing § 553(c)).  Third, to afford the public meaninful participation, the agency must “consider \nand respond to significant comments received during the period for public comment.”  Id. (citing \nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971); Thompson v. Clark, \n741 F.2d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).  In promulgating the final rule, the agency “must include in \nthe rule’s text ‘a concise general statement of [its] basis and purpose.’” Id. (citing § 553(c)).  \nRules properly enacted through this process have the “force and effect of law.”  Perez, 575 U.S. \nat 96 (quoting Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302–303 (1979)).   \nBecause this process is designed to ensure the agency engages in reasoned decision-\nmaking, see North Carolina Grower’ Ass’n, Inc. v. United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 763 \n(2012) (quoting Spartan Radiocasting Co. v. FCC, 619 F.2d 314, 321 (4th Cir. 1980); Chocolate \nMfrs. Ass’n v. Block, 755 F.2d 1098, 1103 (4th Cir. 1985)), concerns raised by the public can \nalert the agency to “an important aspect of the problem,” for the purposes of arbitrary and \ncapricious review, Gresham, 950 F.3d at 103; see also Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. \nPerdue, 873 F.3d 914, 924 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  Where a significant concern is raised, the agency \nmust “adequately analyze . . . the consequences” of its actions.  Id. at 931.  It cannot “brush[] \naside” important facts, id. at 932, or offer “conclusory statements” to prove that it “consider[ed] \n[the relevant] priorities,” Getty v. Fed. Savs. & Loan Ins. Corp., 805 F.2d 1050, 1057 (D.C. Cir. \n1986).  The agency must actually give meaningful consideration to these concerns, lest its action \n46 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 47 of 69\nbe deemed arbitrary and capricious.  See Gresham, 950 F.3d at 103.   \nPlaintiffs offer several reasons as to why the challenged rules violate the APA, a number \nof which are unavailing at this stage.  ECF No. 23-1 at 16-31.  That said, Plaintiffs have shown \nthat in both rulemakings the agency either failed to respond to significant concerns raised or to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem, as more fully explained below.  \ni.  Challenge to The Timeline Repeal Rule \nThe Court begins with Plaintiffs’ challenge to the Timeline Repeal Rule.  ECF No. 23-1 \nat 29–31.  This rule eliminates the agency’s twenty-five-year practice of processing asylees’ \ninitial EAD applications within thirty days.  Moving forward, the agency provides no timeframe \nby when it will determine eligibility for an EAD.  See Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at \n37,545.   \nPlaintiffs contend that the Timeline Repeal Rule is arbitrary and capricious because its \nrationale for eliminating this deadline is not only belied by the record but shows that the agency \nfailed to consider the important alternative of a longer processing timeline.  ECF No. 23-1 at 29-\n30.   In support, Plaintiffs point to numerous comments urging the agency to extend the thirty-\nday deadline rather than eliminate it outright.   See Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 37,512, \n37,520-21.  Even the agency itself recognized the wisdom of imposing on itself a 90-day \nprocessing deadline, which would provide “more predictability to asylum seekers and [give] \nUSCIS … more time to adjudicate.”  Id. at 37,521.  But it ultimately concluded that imposing \n“hard processing deadlines” would be “imprudent,” because USCIS cannot reliably predict \nfuture workload, processing, and other changes.”  Id.   \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the agency’s response to this concern likely \nrendered its decision arbitrary and capricious in two ways: first, the agency’s claimed inability to \n47 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 48 of 69\nreliably predict future processing timeline runs counter to the record; and second, the agency’s \n“conclusory” responses to considered commentary reflects a total failure to consider the \nimportant alternative of a longer timeframe.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; Getty, 805 F.2d at \n1057.   \n  To begin, the Court must step back.  In 2017, individual asylum applicants filed a class \naction in Rosario v. USCIS, 365 F. Supp. 3d 1156, 1162 (W.D. Wash. 2017), challenging \nUSCIS’ failure to process EAD applications within the 30-day deadline set for itself.  At that \ntime, USCIS was taking as much as 60 or 90 days to process the EAD applications.  See id. at \n1163.  The Rosario plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring USCIS to abide by its own 30-day \nprocessing rule.  Id. at 1159–60.  The Plaintiffs prevailed, and the Court granted both preliminary \nand permanent injunctive relief, requiring that USCIS process work applications within the 30-\nday processing period.  Id. at 1158.  \n  The Rosario Court, citing to the statement of basis and purpose for the agency’s then-\nexisting 30-day rule, explained that a “chief purpose” of the rule was “to ensure that bona fide \nasylees are eligible to obtain employment authorization as quickly as possible.”  Id. at 1160 \n(quotations omitted).  The Court further noted that the agency had originally selected the 30-day \nprocessing rule, in combination with the 150-day waiting period prior to application, because \nthat represented a time “‘beyond which it would not be appropriate to deny work authorization to \na person whose claim has not been adjudicated.’”  Id. at 1161 (quoting Notice of 1994 Reforms, \n59 Fed. Reg. 14,779).  Thus, the Court correctly concluded that the agency intended to “cabin \nwhat was already—in the agency’s view—an extraordinary amount of time to wait for work \nauthorization.”  Id.   \n  Shortly after Rosario, the agency promulgated the Timeline Repeal Rule to “ensure \n48 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 49 of 69\nUSCIS has sufficient time to receive, screen and process applications” and “reduce opportunities \nfor fraud.”  See Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 35702.  To afford itself greater flexibility, \nthe agency landed on the solution of completely eliminating the 30-day rule.  When pressed as to \nwhy a longer timeline would not solve its problem—an alternative that would also ensure agency \naccountability and a certain level of predictability in the process for asylees—the agency \nmaintained that it “cannot predict” the processing times for future applications.  See id. at \n37,519; 37,520-21.   \n  This response runs counter to the agency’s findings elsewhere.  In its responses, the \nagency reassures the public that it “expects to return to the adjudicatory timeframe before \nRosario” because that timeframe is “sustainable” and in line with future agency expectations.  Id. \nat 37,521.  The agency cites the pre-Rosario processing times as roughly 60 days for 78% of the \napplications, and 90 days for 92% of all applications.  Id. at 37,503, 37,513.   If the agency is to \nbe believed, it can certainly “predict” processing times, and can therefore implement a timeframe \nprocessing rule in line with such predictions.  On this basic point, the agency’s sole rationale for \nrejecting this alternative—that it cannot reliably predict future expectations—runs counter to its \nfindings and reassurances elsewhere that it can.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  In this respect, \nthe agency’s explanation as to why a longer timeframe would not suffice runs counter to the \nrecord.  See id. at 51; Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,521.   \nThe agency’s reasoning also reveals its failure to consider an important “policy \nalternative.”  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 51; see also Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. \nCt. at 1913.  Given the original purpose of the 30-day rule—to limit asylees’ waiting time once \nthey became work-eligible, to ensure the application process has some level of predictability, and \nto hold the agency accountable in its timely processing of these applications—the proposed \n49 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 50 of 69\nalternative of a longer timeframe falls squarely within the “ambit of the existing policy.”  See id. \n(quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 51).  But rather than giving adequate consideration to this \nimportant alternative, the agency provided a half-baked and internally contradictory explanation \nfor rejecting it.  Its rationale does not pass muster.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 57.    \n  Nor does the agency’s general need for “flexibility” adequately explain its rejection of a \nlonger processing timeline.  Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,509.  The agency has \nhistorically processed 78% of the applications in 60 days, and 92% of all applications within 90-\ndays.  Id. at 37,503, 37,513.  Where the agency has committed itself to returning to this \ntimeframe, the Court cannot see how eliminating any deadlines affords the agency any more \nflexibility than simply lengthening the processing time to the agency’s reasonable satisfaction.   \n  The agency’s attempts to respond to this very point are wholly unsatisfactory.  The \nagency first notes the fact made self-evident by Rosario—that it has failed to adjudicate \napplications within the 30-day time frame.  See id. at 37,513.  While the agency’s difficulty in \ncomplying with the 30-day deadline supports extending the timeline, it hardly explains why there \nshould be no timeline at all.  Next, the agency notes that it considered extending the time frame \nto “60 or 90 days,” but rejects that alternative because “it would not be feasible in all cases.”  Id.  \nBy its own account, DHS can and has predicted how long it will take to process the lion’s share \nof EAD applications.  See id. at 37,513, 37,521.  And to the extent the agency wishes to achieve \nperfect compliance with any timeframe it selects, it provides no rationale for why it cannot use \npast as prologue to fashion a longer, sufficient timeline, rather than repeal the rule in total.    \n  The agency further notes that it is unable to plan its workload and staffing needs “with \nthe level of certainty that a binding timeframe may require and has no way of predicting what \nnational security fraud concerns may be or what procedures would be necessary in the future.”  \n50 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 51 of 69\nId. at 37,513.  As stated above, this response runs counter to the agency’s affirmative assurances \nthat it will adhere to the pre-Rosario processing timelines, and that such a goal is “sustainable” \none.  Id. at 37,503.  But even more to the point, accepting this argument would allow agencies to \ndo away with their internal deadlines because of a remote and hypothetical possibility that such a \ndeadline might become unworkable.  This sort of “conclusory” statement falls short of the \n“reasoned decisionmaking” required under the APA.  Am. Wild Horse, 873 F.3d at 932.  \n  Lastly, the agency’s attempts to minimize the import of its decision are unavailing.  In \nrejecting the public’s suggestion of a longer deadline, the agency explains that the Timeline \nRepeal Rule does not “prohibit or otherwise limit an asylum applicant’s eligibility for an EAD or \nto apply for or receive asylum.”  Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,513.  The agency \nutters this talismanic phrase as if saying it makes it true.  Id. at 37512, 37520, 37527, 37528.   \nBut logic and the record thus far demonstrate otherwise.  Doing away with any processing \ndeadline will likely reduce or even eliminate advance work authorizations because nothing now \nrenders the agency bound to adjudicate them.  And, as more fully discussed below, the Timeline \nRepeal Rule, in combination with the Broader EAD Rules, will indeed impact an asylee’s \nchances of success on the underlying application.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that on this \nrecord, the agency has failed to consider any legitimately raised policy alternatives.  Plaintiffs \nhave demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits as to their challenge to the Timeline \nRepeal Rule.        \nii.  Depriving the Public its Right to Comment via Staggered \nRulemaking    \nThe Court next turns to Plaintiffs’ challenges regarding the agency’s failure to consider \nthe rules’ combined effect.  ECF No. 23-1 at 17-23.  Although Plaintiffs’ arguments reach far \nand wide, the Court focuses solely on those that appear likely to succeed on the merits.   \n51 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 52 of 69\nPlaintiffs argue that because DHS staggered the notice and comment period for the \nTimeline Repeal Rule and the Broader EAD rules, it deprived the public of the right to comment, \nand ensured no consideration of how the rules together would adversely disadvantage applicants.  \nSee id.; 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c); United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d at 769-70 (to comply with \nsections 553(b) and (c), the agency must “receive comments on” and respond to “relevant and \nsignificant issues” in the rulemaking); see also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (emphasizing that \nagency action is “normally” arbitrary and capricious when the agency “entirely failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem”).  For the following reasons, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs. \n  The public comments repeatedly draw the agency’s attention to the combined adverse \neffect of the challenged rules.  Yet time and again, the agency sidesteps this fundamental \nconcern.  First, in the Timeline Repeal Rule, the agency declines to address the “interaction or \noverlap” between the rules and notes it will address such concerns if it finalizes the broader \nrule.”  Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,530.  But then in the Broader EAD Rules, the \nagency acknowledges the  “potential interaction[]” of the rules, but concludes that “incorporating \nsuch interactions in the impact assessments for this rule would be speculative as it assumes [the \nTimeline Repeal Rule] will be finalized, and without change.”  Id. at 38,590.  The problem for \nthe agency is that the Timeline Repeal Rule had already been finalized without change.  \nCompare Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,502 (effective August 21, 2020) with \nBroader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,532 (effective August 25, 2020).  The record reflects that \nthe agency first delayed, then denied, any meaningful consideration of the rules’ interaction.  \nIndeed, the agency only refers to the Timeline Repeal Rule twice in the proposed Broader EAD \nRules, neither of which constitutes a discussion of their interplay.  See Broader EAD Rules, 84 \nFed. Reg. 62,389, 62,392 (proposed Nov. 14, 2019).  Because the agency never meaningfully \n52 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 53 of 69\naddressed the interaction of these rules, it also never accounted for those comments cutting to the \nheart of the adverse impact the rules visit in combination.  ECF No. 23-1 at 18.   \n  That said, if the agency’s only sin was to stagger the notice and comment period of the \nrules, that alone may not support a finding that the agency violated the APA.  See United Farm, \n702 F.3d at 770.  However, when considering the agency’s circular deferral of assessing the \ncombined impact of the rules, the force of the claim is strengthened when also considering the \ncumulative impact of the rules on bona fide asylum seekers.  See id.  (finding the agency’s \nstaggered rulemakings violate notice-and-comment procedures and precluded consideration of \nimportant issues); see also Perez, 575 U.S. at 96 (stating the agency must “consider and respond \nto significant comments received during the period for public comment” to comply with the \nAPA’s procedural requirements).  The Court next addresses this impact as part of the Plaintiffs’ \nthird argument—that the agency failed to consider the impact of the rules on such applicants.  \nECF No. 23-1 at 23–24.   \niii.  Agency  Failure  to  Consider  Harms  to  Bona  Fide  Asylum \nSeekers \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that consideration of the effects on bona fide asylum \nseekers is of paramount importance.  See Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011); see also \nRegents of Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. at 1913 (identifying policy alternatives that fell within \n“ambit” of  previous regulation as important concerns that must be considered).   The \nGovernment does not dispute this proposition.  ECF No. 41 at 20, 25-27 (arguing agency gave \nadequate consideration, not that concern was unimportant for purposes of arbitrary and \ncapricious review).  But so long as the agency considered, and rationally responded to, this \nrelevant and important issue, this Court cannot “substitute its own analysis [or Plaintiffs’ \nanalysis] for the agency’s.”  State v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 824 F.3d 1012, \n53 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 54 of 69\n1022 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quotations omitted); see also Regents of the Univ. of California, 190 S. \nCt. at 1905 (quoting Volpe, 401 U. S. at 416) (asking whether the agency’s decision was “based \non a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment”).   \nEven with this appropriate deference, the Court finds little evidence that the agency \naddressed the clear economic harm the rule changes will visit on bona fide asylum seekers.  The \ncommenters highlighted that the rules work together to erect a series of procedural and financial \nbarriers that render nearly impossible pre-asylum work authorization.  See Broader EAD Rules, \n85 Fed. Reg. at 38,558 (the combined effect of the rules making pre-asylum work authorization \n“virtually unattainable”).   Yet the agency responded with a series of non-sequiturs and \ngeneralized “understandings” of the commenters’ positions that cannot substitute as reasoned \nresponses.  See Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Azar, No. 19-1614 & No. 20-1215, 2020 \nWL 5240442, at *10 (4th Cir. Sept. 3, 2020).   \nAs to the several changes to the EAD timing provisions, the new rules first eliminate the \n30-day default period after which a pending asylum application is deemed complete—a critical \nchange because now applicants do not have any way of knowing whether their EAD clock has \nactually started.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § \n208.3(c)(3)).  Second, after the agency deems the asylum application complete, the applicant \nmust wait a full 365 days before applying for an EAD.  See id. (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ \n208.3, 208.7(a)(1)(ii), and 274a.12(c)(8)).  Third, once the EAD application can finally be \nsubmitted, the agency is no longer bound to process the application by any specified time.  See \nTimeline Repeal Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37545-46.  On these timing changes alone, an applicant \nno longer has any safeguards to prevent the agency from delaying and deferring any advance \nadjudication of an EAD application.  The Court’s understanding of how these timing provisions \n54 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 55 of 69\nintersect is further confirmed by another one of the agency’s rule changes, in which it clarifies \nthat asylees are not entitled to pre-asylum work authorization, and that the agency’s review of \nthese applications is purely discretionary.  See Broader EAD Rules, at 38,599, 38,628 (to be \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(a)(1)).   \nIn response, DHS simply paid lip service to a certain “degree of economic hardship” that \nthe new rules inflict.  See id. 38,549 (“DHS acknowledges that these reforms will also apply to \naliens with meritorious asylum claims, and that these applicants may experience some degree of \neconomic hardship as a result of heightened requirements for an EAD.”); see also Timeline \nRepeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,526.  DHS declared the rule changes necessary to “maintain \nintegrity in the asylum process” and that “it is not unreasonable to impose additional time and \nsecurity requirements on asylum seekers before they may apply for an EAD.”  Broader EAD \nRules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,549.  But the agency never addressed how it can maintain “integrity” in \na system that will now foreclose advance work authorization for legitimate asylum seekers as a \nmeans to address non-specific fraudulent applications.  Stated differently, the agency has not \n“display[ed] awareness” of the extent to which it is “changing position,” and so its responses do \nnot provide a “reasoned” basis for departing from the “circumstances that underlay … the prior \npolicy.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Tel. Station, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).   \n  Of greatest concern to Plaintiffs is the agency’s failure to address how the new rules will \n“actually discourage and reduce legitimate claims for asylum.”  ECF No. 23-1 at 24 (citing \nBroader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,564-65; Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,520).  \nIt is axiomatic that without being able to work, asylum applicants lack the resources to pursue \ntheir claims.  See ECF Nos. 24-19 & 24-25.  Indeed, the denial of work hits an already destitute \npopulation,” many of whom are “relying on limited savings to survive.”  Broader EAD Rules, 85 \n55 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 56 of 69\nFed. Reg. at 38,575.  Several public comments brought to the agency hard evidence that having \nthe means to pay for legal counsel can “triple asylum seekers’ odds of success,” and the lack of \nresources can mean utter failure.  Id. at 38,585, 38,591.  Not to mention a host of other hidden \ncosts necessary to pursue valid asylum claims, such as hiring an interpreter for the initial \n“credible fear” interview (a new agency-imposed requirement); biometric information fees; fees \nfor FOIA requests; and transportation costs.  Id. at 38,576, 38,591; 38,627; see also Timeline \nRepeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,525. \n  The agency, in response, completely sidestepped this critical impact of the new rules.  \nThe DHS merely noted that these rules do not “change the eligibility requirements or process by \nwhich asylum seekers obtain employment authorization or asylum status.” Id. at 37,527-28; see \nalso id. at 37,520; Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. 38,591, 38,592 (“Asylum applicants will \nnot be impacted in their pursuit of their asylum claims because this rule does not change any \neligibility criteria for asylum.”).  This non sequitur is not a meaningful answer.  See Azar, 2020 \nWL 5240442, at *10.  The issue is not whether the rules visit substantive changes on the asylum \ncriteria for those who apply; it is whether the new rules make it substantially harder, if not \nimpossible, to apply in the first place.   \n  In the end, the agency never wrestled with the fundamental implications of deferring or \ndenying advance work authorization.  Substantially limiting approval of work authorization for \nbona fide asylees will inevitably affect their ability to afford the costs of seeking asylum, \nincluding hiring legal counsel.  See ECF Nos. 24-19 & 24-25; see also Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 \nFed. Reg. at 37,520, 37,525 (citing studies that even with pro bono legal representation, \napplicants cannot afford the “other costs inherent” to the application process without work \nauthorization); Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,591 (citing “reports and research … on \n56 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 57 of 69\nmonetary and qualitative impacts to asylum applicants”).  By glossing over the above comments, \nthe agency failed to address this important concern or explain why, notwithstanding this cost to \nbona fide asylum seekers, the rule changes were justified.  See F.C.C. v. Fox Tel. Stations, Inc., \n556 U.S. 502, 537 (2009) (“An agency cannot simply disregard . . . inconvenient facts[.]”). \n  The agency’s failure to consider the impact on bona fide applicants is made more \nindefensible when considering that the agency’s stated impetus for the Broader EAD Rules was \nto reduce the asylum backlog for the long-term benefit of bona fide asylum seekers.  See 85 Fed. \nReg. at 38,554; see also Bedford Cty., 769 F.2d at 1022 (explaining the agency’s rationale for a \nrule change is an “important issue” for purposes of reviewing agency action).  Taking the \nagency’s stated goal at face value, it was irrational to not also consider whether the same rules \nvisit substantial hardship on those the agency claims to protect.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  \nMoreover, where the old rules “engendered serious reliance interests,” if anything the agency \nwas required to provide a “more detailed justification” for its changes.  Fox. Tel. Stations Inc., \n556 U.S. at 515; see also Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. at 1913 (“When an \nagency changes course … it must be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered \nserious reliance interests that must be taken into account.”) (citations omitted).  At the very least, \nit was required to give a “reasoned explanation” for “disregarding … [its] prior policy,” which \ngranted work authorization to asylees as they navigated the protracted and costly asylum process.  \nF.C.C. v. Fox. Tel. Stations, 556 U.S. at 516.   \n  In sum, the Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely to succeed in showing that \nthe challenges rules for which they have standing are not the product of reasoned \ndecisionmaking.  See Regents of Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. at 1913 (citations omitted); see \n57 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 58 of 69\nalso State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Having found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits \nas to two of their three liability theories, the Court next turns to the remaining Winter factors. \nB.  Irreparable Harm  \nThe Court considers next whether Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of irreparable harm.  \nTo succeed, Plaintiffs must establish they will suffer harm that is “‘neither remote nor \nspeculative, but actual and imminent.’”  Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Group, 952 \nF.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991) (quoting Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d \n969, 975 (2d Cir. 1989)).  “Additionally, the harm must be irreparable, meaning that it ‘cannot be \nfully rectified by the final judgment after trial.’”  Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres of \nLand, 915 F.3d 197, 216 (4th Cir. 2019) (quoting Stuller, Inc. v. Steak N Shake Enters., 695 F.3d \n676, 680 (7th Cir. 2012)); see also Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 \nU.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam)) (explaining injunctive relief is an “extraordinary remedy that \nmay only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”).   \nPlaintiffs have met their burden.  Plaintiffs CASA and ASAP have established \nrepresentational standing based on five of their members.  Since the rules took effect on August \n21, and August 25, 2020, Plaintiffs, by way of their individual members, have suffered and will \ncontinue to suffer a concrete harm—one that cannot simply be rectified at final judgment.  See \nDiaz. v. I.N.S., 648 F. Supp. 638, 647-48 (E.D. Cal. 1986) (quoting Nat’l Center for Immigrants \nRights, Inc. v. I.N.S., 743 F.2d 1365, 1369 (9th Cir. 1984) (“The hardship [to aliens] from being \nunable to work to support themselves and their dependents ... is beyond question.”)).   \nASAP’s members, W.L. and N.G., only became eligible to apply for work authorization \nunder the old 180-day rule shortly after these rules went into effect.  ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 8, 133.  Under \nthe old rules, each could have applied for EAD immediately and have their applications \n58 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 59 of 69\nprocessed within thirty days.  Now they must wait an additional 215 days to apply and then \nindefinitely for a decision.  ECF No. 23-1 at 39.  Moreover, nothing suggests that either would \nbe ineligible to work.  Meanwhile, H.V. is in an even worse predicament; absent exceptional \ncircumstances, she is now disqualified from receiving pre-asylum work authorization under the \none-year filing bar.  ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 23.  Thus, every additional day these individuals wait will \nvisits on them crippling dependence on the charity and good will of others.16  ECF No. 24-5 ¶¶ \n23-29; ECF No. 24-25 at 3; Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,501 (acknowledging “there \ncould be monetary and qualitative impacts to applicants and their support networks, including \nnumerous types of hardships.”);  \nFurther, any potential form of relief at the merits stage cannot retroactively repair the \nongoing and concrete harm that will befall bona fide asylees whose EAD applications are \ndelayed or denied.  See Ramos v. Thornburgh, 732 F. Supp. 696, 699 (E.D. Tex. 1989) (“It \ncannot validly be disputed that an unreasonable denial of work authorization, or … delay … in \nwork authorization, results in a substantial threat of harm to plaintiffs, by preventing them from \nworking to support themselves pending resolution of their claims for asylum.”); (“Monetary \ndamages at some future time can never adequately compensate aliens living at or below the \npoverty line, for the hardships they must endure as a result of presently existing unlawful denials \nof employment authorization.”) (citations omitted).  Most irreparable is the damage to bona fide \napplicants’ ability to seek asylum in the first instance.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the rules \nstrip such applicants of lawful employment and likewise of the ability to pay the myriad costs \ninherent to the asylum process.  See supra pp. 54-56.  While adjudication times for asylum \napplications vary, they are consistently long; applicants wait years to learn whether they have \n \n16 Plaintiffs’ argument is well taken that “[t]hese harms will only be more severe in the context of the current \npandemic, which makes access to medical care and stable housing especially vital.”  ECF No. 23-1 at 39-40.   \n59 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 60 of 69\nreceived asylum.  See Broader EAD Rules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,548 (agency describing the “years-\nlong wait”); ECF No. 24-4 ¶ 10; ECF No. 24-6 ¶ 13; ECF No. 24-7 ¶ 10; ECF No. 24-19 at 6 \nn.14; ECF No. 24-20 at 43.  What is more, the fees and costs associated with pursuing the claim \nare steep.  And without any ability to work for at least a year and likely far longer, it is plain that \nlegitimate asylum claims may be abandoned altogether.  See ECF No. 23-1 at 40 (citing ECF No. \n24-5 ¶ 31; ECF No. 24-6 ¶ 15); Ramos, 732 F. Supp. at 700 (“[T]he inability to work for the \nextended period … may compel an applicant to abandon his or her asylum application … [and] \nsubject the applicant to even more severe persecution upon return to the country he or she has \nattempted to flee.”); see also Christopher Phelps & Assocs., LLC v. Galloway, 492 F.3d 532, 544 \n(4th Cir. 2007) (attributing irreparability to the intangible nature of the injury, and that \ncalculating such injury at the merits stage would “entail a substantial amount of speculation and \nguesswork”).    \nIn response, the Government points to supposed alternative “avenues to address excessive \ndelays” such as “case status inquiries, expedite requests when circumstances warrant, and even \njudicial redress through filing a mandamus action to compel a decision.” ECF No. 41 at 34 \n(citing 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,511).  These avenues are dead ends.  The challenged rules eliminate \nany timeline on the agency and render the adjudication of EADs entirely discretionary.  So any \nclaimed “redress” within the application process itself is illusory.  Nor can the Court take \nseriously any reference to “mandamus” as an available path to redress.  Legitimate asylum \napplicants seek refuge under dire circumstances and will be stripped under the new rules of \naffording the necessities to apply for asylum in the first instance.  How the same population \nwould be expected to pursue the extraordinary judicial remedy of mandamus is confounding, if \neven available as a matter of law.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b) and 706(1); cf. Norton v. S. Utah \n60 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 61 of 69\nWilderness Alliance, 542 U.S. 55, 64 (2004) (explaining a “claim under § 706(1) [of the APA] \ncan proceed only when a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action \nthat it is required to take”) (emphasis in original).  The delay inherent in mandamus actions alone \nunderscores the absurdity of this position.  See Telecomm. Research & Action Center v. FCC, \n750 F.2d 70, 80-81 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (delay of five years did not warrant grant of mandamus); \nDebba v. Heinauer, 366 Fed. Appx. 696, 699 (8th Cir. 2010) (delay of ten years found \nreasonable); In re City of Virginia Beach, 42 F.3d 881, 886 (4th Cir. 1994) (despite four-and-a-\nhalf year delay on the city’s application for a water pipeline, mandamus unwarranted where \nagency has “promise[d] to adhere to a tight[er] schedule”).   \nThe Court accordingly concludes that the kind of harm identified to the members of \nPlaintiffs CASA and ASAP is indisputably irreparable. \nC.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nFinally, Plaintiffs must establish that “the balance of equities” tips in its favor and that \n“an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S at 20.  Because the Government is a \nparty in this case, these factors merge.  See Kravitz, 366 F. Supp. 3d at 755 (quoting Pursuing \nAm. Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016)). \nThe balance of equities tips in favor of granting Plaintiffs’ preliminary relief.  The Court \nbalances on the one hand the Plaintiffs irreparable harms against the Government’s asserted \nharms that arise from temporarily enjoining the enforcement of the challenged rules against two \nof the parties, until the Court can reach final judgment on the merits.  ECF No. 41 at 36-37.   \nFor the Timeline Repeal Rule, the Government contends that the agency will be \nirreparably harmed because such relief will require it to continue devoting more resources than it \nwould like to meet its 30-day processing deadline.  Id. at 36.  Where the agency has functioned \n61 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 62 of 69\nwith this deadline since 1995, the Court does not find this argument persuasive.  Further, because \nthe Court must draw injunctive relief narrowly, it will not at present require the agency to set \naside the new rule for all applicants.  Considering that the scope of the injunctive relief afforded \nwill reach only those members of the Plaintiff organizations with representational standing, see \nTrump, 137 S. Ct. at 2087-88 (accounting for the scope of relief granted when balancing the \nequities), the Government has offered no reason to believe it will suffer irreparable harm that \noutweighs that visited on the members of the Plaintiff organizations.  \nAs to the Broader EAD Rules, the Government maintains that preliminary relief—in \nwhatever form and of whatever scope—is contrary to the public interest, because it will delay the \nagency’s ability to “address the crisis at the Southern border,” as well as “strain [its] sovereignty, \n[the] rule of law, and [its] resources.”  ECF No. 41 at 36-37.  Again, in light of the narrowly \ndrawn relief this Court will issue, such sweeping pronouncements are unpersuasive.  See Trump, \n137 S. Ct. at 2087-88.17   As for the Government’s larger philosophical concerns about strain on \nthe “rule of law,” the agency would do well to look inward.  The agency cannot itself violate \nthose principles, then claim irreparable harm because it is held to account for such violations.      \nD.  Remedy \nFinally, all that is left for this Court to decide is the scope of preliminary relief.  While \nthis decision “rests within the sound discretion” of this Court, see South Carolina v. United \nStates, 907 F.3d 742, 753 (4th Cir. 2018) (quotations omitted), the relief granted should \n“carefully address[] … the circumstances of the case,” Va. Soc’y for Human Life, Inc. v. FEC, \n263 F.3d 379, 393 (4th Cir. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Real Truth About Abortion, \n \n17 Indeed, if Plaintiffs ultimately succeed on its APA claims, the Government will have to likely revert to the \nprevious rules.  See Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (the \n“ordinary result” for agency action found in violation of the APA is vacatur).     \n \n62 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 63 of 69\nInc. v. FEC, 681 F.3d 544 (4th Cir. 2012), and “should be no more burdensome … than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs,” Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 \nU.S. 753, 765 (1994).  For this reason, a court “need not grant the total relief sought by the \napplicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.”  Trump, 137 S. \nCt. at 2087 (citations omitted).   \nPlaintiffs seek a stay or alternatively a nationwide injunction as to all the challenged \nrules.  ECF No. 23-1 at 41; ECF No. 59 at 7.  The Government asks the Court to limit relief to \nthe five individual organization members whom CASA and ASAP have identified in support of \nassociational standing, and only as to the Timeline Repeal Rule, the 365-day waiting period, and \nthe one-year filing ban.  ECF No. 60 at 3; ECF No. 65 at 5.  The Court cannot credit either \nargument. \nTurning first to the Plaintiffs argument, the Court recognizes that section 705 of the APA \ngrants to the Court, as it does to the agency itself, the power to “issue all necessary and \nappropriate process” to “preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” \n5 U.S.C. § 705.   Section 705 operates broadly to allow the agency to postpone enactment of a \nrule for a host of reasons, or for a Court to suspend enforcement or enjoin its application.  See, \ne.g., Dept’ of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d at 48.  And although the standard for a preliminary \ninjunction and a stay pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705 are the same, see e.g., Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d at \n435, section 705 is a congressionally conferred remedy exclusive in the APA context and \navailable to the Court when necessary to “prevent irreparable injury,” Mexichem Specialty \nResins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 562 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting in part); see \nalso In re GTE Service Corp., 762 F.2d 1024, 1026 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (recognizing that § 705 \nsupplies “statutory authority to stay agency orders pending review in this court.”); Nken v. \n63 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 64 of 69\nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 428 (2009) (An injunction “direct[s] the conduct of a particular actor, \n[whereas] a stay operates upon the judicial proceeding itself … by halting or postponing some \nportion of the proceeding, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceability.”); id. (citing \nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1413 (6th ed.1990) (defining “stay” as “a suspension of the case or some \ndesignated proceedings within it”)); Washington v. DHS, 408 F.Supp.3d 1191, 1212 (E.D. Wash. \n2019) (“Section 705 and preliminary injunctions under Rule 65, although determined by \napplication of similar standards, offer different forms of relief.”)  (quotations omitted).  \nEmploying this authority to afford uniform preliminary relief seems especially warranted \nhere, to avoid running “‘afoul of the constitutional and statutory requirements for uniform \nimmigration law and policy.’”  Regents of Univ. of California v. DHS, 279 F. Supp. 3d 1011, \n1049 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (quoting Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1167 (9th Cir. 2017)), \naff’d, 908 F.3d 476 (9th Cir. 2018); see also Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 701 (9th Cir. 2017), \nrev’d on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) (“Because this case implicates immigration \npolicy, a nationwide injunction was necessary to give Plaintiffs a full expression of their \nrights.”).  At the same time, the Court is bound to draw such preliminary relief, even in the APA \ncontext, narrowly, and to avoid issuance of nationwide injunctions absent the most extraordinary \ncircumstances not present here.  See Casa v. Trump, 2020 WL 4664820, at *26.  The Court so \nconcludes, especially in light of the Fourth Circuit’s recent pronouncement on this very issue.   \nIn Casa, the Fourth Circuit was called upon to review the issuance of a nationwide \ninjunction as applied to DHS’ changed definition of the “public charge” rule.  Id. at *1.  The \nCourt not only reversed on the merits but took the opportunity to offer a stinging and lengthy \nrebuke of implementing a nationwide injunction to prohibit enforcement of the challenged public \ncharge rule.  See id. at *23.   In so doing, the Fourth Circuit expressly rejected the propriety of \n64 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 65 of 69\ninjunctive relief even though such nationwide application would promote uniform enforcement \nof immigration regulations over haphazard and patchwork application.  Cf. Casa de Maryland, \nInc. v. Trump, 414 F. Supp. 3d 760, 785 (D. Md. 2019) (quoting Int’l Refugee Assistance Project \nv. Trump, 857 F.3d 554, 605 (4th Cir.), as amended (June 15, 2017), vacated and remanded on \nother grounds sub nom., Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance, 138 S. Ct. 353 (2017)).   \nRelatedly, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the district court erred in not limiting \npreliminary relief to only the two individual Plaintiffs with standing, and so effectively rejected \nthe well-established principle that in the APA context, a district court retains discretion to accord \nthe same preliminary relief that would be available at the merits stage.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at \n425-26; Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Eng’rs, 909 F.3d 635, 647 (2018) (vacatur \nas available form of final relief); Portland Cement Ass’n v. EPA, 665 F.3d 177, 189 (D.C. Cir. \n2011).  \nNor did the Fourth Circuit address whether the APA’s specific statutory power codified \nin section 705 to “stay” enforcement of a challenged rule reflects considerations beyond those \ninvoked in the exercise of the Court’s general equitable powers to grant injunctive relief.  See \nCasa v. Trump, 2020 WL 4664820, at *24 (quotations and citations omitted) (“Our power to \ngrant equitable remedies is commensurate with this duty”); (“It is, to put it mildly, hard to see \nhow the court could still be acting in the judicial role of resolving cases or controversies when it \nissues such a far-reaching and pervasive equitable remedy”); (“Nationwide injunctions also run \nafoul of the prescribed scope of our equitable power.”); (“Any inherent equitable authority that \nthe courts possess under Article III is likely bounded by the same”).    \nThat said, this Court cannot meaningfully distinguish this case from Casa.  The Plaintiffs \nin Casa sought the same injunctive relief under 705 and the Court’s equitable powers to stave off \n65 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 66 of 69\napplication of an immigration rule which, in its view, likely violated the APA.  See Casa v. \nTrump, 414 F. Supp. 3d at 788.  And the Plaintiffs here have done little to set this case apart from \nthe reach of Casa.  Accordingly, even though this Court remains concerned about “slicing and \ndicing”18 application of the rules in a manner contrary to the uniform administration of \nimmigration laws, the Court believes itself bound to follow the Circuit’s binding precedent.19  \nThe Court will limit the injunctive relief to the members of CASA and ASAP, the two \norganizational plaintiffs who have demonstrated associational standing at this stage.  See Casa v. \nTrump, 2020 WL 4664820, at *25; see also Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. \nat 2087 (“[T]he purpose of preliminary equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights \nof the parties, but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.”).   \nFinally, this Court must make clear that the scope of the relief is limited to the rules for \nwhich Plaintiffs have standing.  Plaintiffs view the challenged rules as a “package,” which are \ninterconnected and “infected by the same procedural improprieties.”  ECF No. 66 at 2 n.2.  Thus, \naccording to Plaintiffs, all the rules must be enjoined.  Id.  Conversely, the Government contends \nthat because the rules are severable, each rule stands alone, and any challenges are limited to \nthose rules for which the Plaintiffs have standing and otherwise meet the Winter factors.  ECF \nNo. 60 at 3.  The Government has the better argument. \nThe doctrine of severability arises where, as here, a subset of the rule changes within a \nbroader rule are found invalid or unlawful.  In deciding whether to enjoin enforcement of the \n \n18  See District of Columbia v. Dep’t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d at 37.  \n \n19 The dissent in Casa v. Trump views the decision on remedy as dicta in light of its reversal on the merits. 2020 WL \n4664820, at *47.  This Court is not as convinced when considering that if the panel decision on the merits is \nreversed en banc or by the Supreme Court, the scope of the remedy remains a live controversy.  See, e.g., United \nStates v. Ford, 703 F.3d 708, 711 n.2 (4th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted) (“Where a court makes alternative holdings \nto support its decision, each holding is binding precedent.”); Bravo v. United States, 532 F.3d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir. \n2008) (same); United States v. Wright, 496 F.3d 371, 375 n.10 (5th Cir. 2007) (same).   \n66 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 67 of 69\nentire rule, including the non-offending provisions, courts must ascertain the “intent of the \nagency and … whether the remainder of the regulation could function sensibly without the \nstricken provision.”  MD/DC/DE Broadcasters Ass’n v. F.C.C., 236 F.3d 13, 22 (D.C. Cir. \n2001); see also Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 191 (1999) \n(Unless “it is evident that the [lawmaking body] would not have enacted those provisions which \nare within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what \nis left is fully operative as a law.”); see also Azar, 2020 WL 5240442, at *24.  Thus, the Court \nmust determine whether the rules for which Plaintiffs clearly have standing are severable from \nthe remaining broader package of rules, either because the remaining provisions cannot function \non their own, or because the agency would not have wanted them to.  See MD/DC/DE \nBroadcasters, 236 F.3d at 22.  \nAs clear evidence of agency intent, the Government points to the severability provision in \nthe Broader EAD Rules, which states: “[t]he provisions in this section are intended to be \nindependent severable parts.  In the event that any provision in this section is not implemented, \nDHS intends that the remaining provisions be implemented as an independent rule.”  85 Fed. \nReg. at 38,627 (codified at 12 C.F.R. § 208.7(c)).  This provision creates a presumption that the \nagency “did not intend the validity of the [remaining rules] …. to depend on the validity of the . . \n. offensive provision.”  Azar, 2020 WL 5240442, at *24 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, \n480 U.S. 678, 686 (1987)).  Therefore, unless Plaintiffs marshal “strong evidence” to the \ncontrary, the “objectionable provision[s]” are to be “excised” from the remaining provisions \nwithin the Broader EAD Rules.  Azar, 2020 WL 5240442, at *24 (quoting Brock, 480 U.S. at \n686).  \n67 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 68 of 69\nPlaintiffs have not overcome this presumption.  Nor have they explained how the \nremaining rules are unable to “function independently” from the enjoined rules.  See MD/DC/DE \nBroadcasters, 236 F.3d at 22.  Without any help from Plaintiffs, the Court does not see how an \ninjunction limited to the rules that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge will interfere with, for \ninstance, the agency’s continued enforcement of the unlawful entry rule, the criminal bar rule, or \nthe rules governing when EADs terminate following a denial of asylum.  See Broader EAD \nRules, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38626-28.  Thus, at least at this stage, Plaintiffs have not shown how the \n“whole structure” of the Broader EAD Rules would be undermined were the Court to enjoin only \nthose rules for which Plaintiffs have demonstrated standing and success on the merits.  See \nMD/DC/DE Broadcasters, 236 F.3d at 22. \nTherefore, the Court will preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the following rule changes \nagainst CASA and ASAP’s members: \n-  The Timeline Repeal Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 37,545 (printing parts of the \nregulations to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.7(a)(1));  \n \n-  The 365-day waiting period, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626-28 (referenced throughout and \nas codified at 8 C.F.R. § 208.3(c)(3); § 208.7(a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(iii)(E), and (b)(1)(i); \nand 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(8));  \n \n-  Removal of “deemed-complete” rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.3);  \n \n-  The discretionary review rule, providing that agency is no longer required to issue \nEADs to eligible asylees, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,628 (changes reflected at 8 C.F.R. § \n274a.13(a)(1));  \n \n-  The one-year filing bar, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. § \n208.7(a)(1)(iii)(F)); and  \n \n-  The rule requiring submission of biometric information as part of EAD \napplications, 85 Fed. Reg. at 38,626 (codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.7(a)(1)(i) and \n(a)(1)(iv)(E), 208.10).  \n \n \n68 \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 69   Filed 09/11/20   Page 69 of 69\n \nV.  Conclusion  \n  The Court is convinced that preliminary injunctive relief limited to the members of \nPlaintiff organizations CASA and ASAP is both proper and necessary to avoid irreparable harm.  \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay or a \npreliminary injunction.

On November 10, 2020, Defendants filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal (ECF \nNo. 88) of this Court’s Order granting in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay of effective dates \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 705 or, in the alternative, preliminary injunction.  (ECF Nos. 23, 69, 70).  On \nNovember 23, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal.  (ECF No. 92).   \n2.  On March 22, 2021, Defendants and Plaintiffs jointly moved for voluntary \ndismissal of the appeal and cross-appeal, respectively.  (Case Nos. 20-2217(L), 20-2263, ECF \nNo. 22).   On March 23, 2020, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal and \nissued a Rule 42(b) mandate. (Case Nos. 20-2217 (L), 20-2263, ECF Nos. 23, 24; see Dkt. Nos. \n102, 103) \n3.  Defendants’ time to respond to the complaint (ECF No. 1), which was filed on \nJuly 21, 2020, was extended without date.  (ECF No. 85). \n \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 106   Filed 04/16/21   Page 2 of 3\n4.  The parties have twice requested that the case be held in abeyance for a limited \nduration in light of the pending appeal and cross-appeal. (ECF Nos. 91, 96). \n5.  On February 4, 2021, the Court, at the parties’ request, ordered the case to be held \nin abeyance until February 22, on which date the parties would submit a joint status report. (ECF \nNo. 97).  \n6.  The parties filed a joint status report on March 23, and the Court, at the parties’ \nrequest, ordered the parties to file a status report on or before April 16 with a proposed omnibus \nschedule for this action, or other proposal for this action on or before April 16.  \n7.  The parties have met and conferred, but have not reached an agreement as to how \nthe case should proceed. \n8.  The defendants request that the case be placed in abeyance. The reason for this \nrequest is that the two rules at issue in this case are being reviewed for inclusion under the 90-\nday process set out in section 3(b) of Executive Order 14,012, “Restoring Faith in Our Legal \nImmigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans,” \n86 Fed. Reg. 8,277 (Feb. 5, 2021).  \n9.  Plaintiffs intend to file a motion for partial summary judgment on their Homeland \nSecurity Act claim, and in the alternative, a motion to modify the preliminary injunction. \nPlaintiffs anticipate filing this motion by early next week.  \n10.  Because the parties have not yet come to an agreement as to how the case should \nproceed, defendants reserve their right to file a motion to extend their time to respond to the \nmotion(s), or to seek any other available relief including a stay, once they have an opportunity to \nreview the motion(s).  \nDated:  April 16, 2021 \n \n  2 \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 106   Filed 04/16/21   Page 3 of 3\n                Respectfully submitted, \n    \n                           /s/                                                                    /s/                                        \nLinda Evarts (pro hac vice)  Dennise Moreno (Bar No. 21358)   \nGeroline A.

Mayorkas, No. 1:20-cv-03815-BAH (D.D.C.), Dkt. No. 41, and \nsubmit the following status report. \n1)  On April 12, 2022, this Court held a status conference with the Parties regarding the next steps \nin this case following the Asylumworks vacatur order, ECF No. 169, and ordered the Parties to \nfile a joint status report no later than May 10, 2022.  ECF No. 170. \n2)  Following that conference, Plaintiffs emailed Defendants some of their concerns about the \ngovernment’s implementation of the Asylumworks vacatur order and the reasons they believed \nit necessary for this Court’s preliminary injunction to remain in place to protect Plaintiffs and \ntheir members and clients from irreparable harm.   \n3)  On May 9, 2022, the Parties agreed and stipulated that Defendants would respond to Plaintiffs’ \nconcerns.  The Parties also agreed and stipulated that they would submit a joint status report \non June 6, 2022, which the Court approved.  ECF Nos. 171, 172. \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 173   Filed 06/06/22   Page 2 of 4\n4)  Defendants provided Plaintiffs a written response to their concerns on June 3, 2022. In view \nof  the  substance  of  Defendants’  response,  the  Parties  agree  that  their  positions  are \nirreconcilable.  \n5)  Plaintiffs believe that this action continues to present a case-or-controversy, that the Court can \nand should continue enforcing the preliminary injunction in order to protect Plaintiffs and their \nmembers and clients from irreparable harm, and reserve the right to continue to seek any \nadditional relief to which they are entitled, including such relief as may be necessary in light \nof the government’s continuing failure to implement the February 7 Asylumworks vacatur \norder.  \n6)  Defendants believe that this action no longer presents a case-or-controversy, that the Court \nneed not and cannot continue to enforce the preliminary injunction, and that the Government \nis otherwise in compliance with the February 7 Asylumworks order as well as the other statutes, \nregulations, and other legal authorities that govern the processing of these applications.  \n7)  Should the Court determine that briefing is necessary, the Parties have provided a proposed \nbriefing schedule to address their respective positions. That schedule is as follows:  \n•  Defendants will file a Motion to Dismiss by July 18, 2022. \n•  Plaintiffs will file their opposition to the Motion to Dismiss by August 1, 2022. \n•  Defendants will file their reply in further support of their Motion to Dismiss by \nAugust 15, 2022. \n8)  A status conference is currently scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on June 13, 2022.  Defendants believe \nthat the most efficient way forward is to first discuss this matter with the Court during that \nJune 13th conference in order to determine whether briefing is necessary, and if so whether the \nCourt has any particular scope or issues of concern.  Plaintiffs defer to the Court to determine \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 173   Filed 06/06/22   Page 3 of 4\nwhether a conference would be helpful to the Court, or whether it would be most helpful to \nadjourn the conference until after the Parties have submitted briefing on Defendants’ assertion \nof mootness. \nDated June 6, 2022 \n   \nRespectfully submitted, \n   /s/                                        \n /s/                                         Zachary Manfredi (pro hac vice)  \nLinda Evarts (Bar No. 22012)  ASYLUM SEEKER ADVOCACY PROJECT \nMariko Hirose (Bar No. 22337)  228 Park Avenue S. #84810 \nKathryn Austin (Bar No. 21915)  New York, NY 10003-1502 \nINTERNATIONAL REFUGEE ASSISTANCE  Tel: (305) 484-9260 \nPROJECT  Fax: (646) 968-0279 \nOne Battery Park Plaza, 4th Floor  zachary.manfredi@asylumadvocacy.org \nNew York, New York 10004   \nTel: (516) 838-1655   /s/                                        \nFax: (929) 999-8115  Richard W.

MAYORKAS, et al.,  * \nSecretary of Homeland Security \nUnited States Department of   * \nHomeland Security \n  * \nDefendants.              \n  *** \n  ORDER \n \nIn June 2020, the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS” or the \n“Agency”) and its Acting Secretary, Chad F. Wolf,1 promulgated changes to two sets of rules \ngoverning work authorization for asylum applicants.  Shortly before the challenged rules were to \ntake effect, five organizational Plaintiffs—CASA de Maryland, Inc., Asylum Seeker Advocacy \nProject, Inc., Centro Legal de la Raza, Oasis Legal Services, and Pangea Legal Services \n(collectively “Plaintiffs”)—sued the Agency and sought simultaneously to enjoin the new rules.  \nSee ECF No. 1.  On September 11, 2020, this Court granted injunctive relief.  Casa I, 486 F. \nSupp. 3d at 973–74.   Pending before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment.  See \nECF Nos. 107, 127, 130.   \nOn February 7, 2022, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \nvacated the same rules challenged in this action.  See Asylumworks v. Mayorkas, No. 20-3815 \n(BAH), 2022 WL 355213 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2022).  In response, this Court held a recorded status \n \n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Alejandro Mayorkas, the current Secretary of \nHomeland Security, has been substituted for former Acting Secretary Chad F. Wolf as Defendant.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 25(d). \n\nCase 8:20-cv-02118-PX   Document 170   Filed 04/12/22   Page 2 of 2\nconference on February 14, 2022 to discuss how to proceed with this suit.  See ECF No. 164.  \nAfter the call, the Court stayed this action until today, April 12, 2022, while the Government \nconsidered whether to appeal the Asylumworks decision.  See ECF No. 166.  The Government \nhas since indicated that it will not appeal Asylumworks.  See ECF No. 168.  Thus, the challenged \nrules central to the pending motions have been vacated and are no longer operative.  Id. \nDuring today’s recorded status conference (ECF No. 169), the parties agreed that the \ncross motions for summary judgment are moot; however, Plaintiffs requested additional time to \nevaluate whether this action nonetheless presents a case-or-controversy.  \nAccordingly, it is this 12th day of April 2022, ORDERED that: \n1.  The STAY (ECF No. 166) in this matter is LIFTED; \n2.  The Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed by Plaintiffs (ECF No. 107) \nis DENIED as MOOT; \n3.  The Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed by Defendants (ECF No. \n127) is DENIED as MOOT; \n4.  The Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed by Plaintiffs (ECF No. \n130) is DENIED as MOOT;  \n5.  The Motion to Withdraw as Counsel filed by Amicus Constitutional \nAccountability Center (ECF No. 143) is GRANTED; and \n6.  The parties shall submit a Joint Status Report no later than May 10, 2022; and \n7.  The Court will conduct a recorded status conference on May 17, 2022 at 11:00 \na.m. \n \n \n \nApril 12, 2022                               /s/   \nDate              Paula Xinis \n              United States District Judge ",
