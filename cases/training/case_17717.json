    "summary": "<p>Pilots of Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) brought this class action case against their employer after being deprived of the proper amount of retirement contributions and sick leave benefits during leaves of absence to serve in the U.S. military. Represented by private counsel, the pilots sued Southwest in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on July 14, 2017 under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (the Act). The pilots sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. </p><p>The pilots claimed that Southwest failed to comply with the Act, which mandated that private airline companies make retirement contributions and provide accrued paid sick leave to pilots for all periods in which they engaged in qualified military service and were subsequently reemployed by the company. They alleged that Southwest prevented pilots from receiving the full amount of retirement contributions they were owed both by failing to make contributions and by failing to provide inform pilots about the amount of retirement contributions that they could make and Southwest matched. They further claimed that Southwest did not allow the pilots to accrue paid sick leave but permitted pilots on comparable forms non-military leave to accrue sick leave. </p><p>The parties went through mediation in June 2018 and then began negotiating a settlement. The case was stayed for almost a year. On August 6, 2018, Judge James Donato ordered that the case would be sent to trial if a motion for a preliminary approval of settlement was not filed by September 5. On September 12, 2018, both parties signed a settlement agreement and on December 5, 2018, Judge Donato granted conditional certification of settlement class and preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. The conditionally certified settlement class included 1,478 current (as of the date of the order) and former pilots employed by Southwest that took short-term military leave from Southwest between January 1, 2001 and the preliminary approval date. </p><p>Under the agreement, Southwest had to add to a pilot's sick leave balance 100% of the  sick leave alleged denied between 2008 and the preliminary approval for the settlement and 77% of the sick leave allegedly denied from 2001 to 2007. This was estimated to cost Southwest <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/employee-benefits/southwest-settles-service-member-pilots-benefit-claims-for-19m\">more than $13 million</a>. In addition, Southwest had to pay $5.8 million into a settlement fund that would cover retirement contributions, $1,000 payments to class members no longer employed by Southwest, and attorneys' fees and costs. If any funds remained in the net settlement fund after 180 days from the date the checks were mailed, they would be donated to a mutually approved non-sectarian, non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Under the agreement, the court retained jurisdiction over this matter for three years beyond the final approval date of the settlement. If all the payments had not been made after three years, the court could extend its jurisdiction until all payments were made.</p><p>Judge Donato granted final approval of settlement on October 4, 2019. The court will retain jurisdiction into 2022.</p>",

INTRODUCTION1 \n2    This case, Huntsman v. Southwest Airlines, Co., No. 4:17-cv-03972-JD (N.D.

RECITALS \n4  A.  On July 14, 2017, Plaintiff filed this Case against Southwest alleging that \n5  Southwest violated USERRA by failing to provide its pilots (i) appropriate retirement \n6  contributions mandated by USERRA for periods of Short-Term Military Leave, (ii) information to \n7  facilitate pilots’ opportunity to make retirement contributions that could be matched during \n8  periods of Short-Term Military Leave, and (iii) accrued paid Sick Leave for Short-Term Military \n9  Leave, even though Southwest provides accrued paid Sick Leave to pilots who take other types of \n10  leave.  Plaintiff alleged that USERRA requires Southwest to (i) provide matching contributions to \n11  pilots’ 401(k) accounts for the Deemed Earnings earned during periods of Short-Term Military \n12  Leave for elective deferrals already made to the 401(k) Plan, (ii) provide timely information to \n13  pilots on their Deemed Earnings so that they can make make-up retirement contributions into their \n14  401(k) accounts pursuant to USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4318, and (iii) have their make-up \n15  contributions matched by Southwest.  Plaintiff also alleged that USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4316, \n16  requires Southwest to provide for the accrual of Sick Leave when pilots take Short-Term Military \n17  Leave, because Southwest provides for the accrual of Sick Leave when pilots engage in jury duty, \n18  union leave, and bereavement leave.  Southwest denies these allegations and maintains that the \n19  claims in the Case have no merit.  \n20  B.  Plaintiff sought, among other things, a declaration that Southwest’s policy with \n21  respect to how Southwest matched the retirement contributions of Plaintiff and the Class Members \n22  during periods of Short-Term Military Leave violated their rights under USERRA and a \n23  declaration that Southwest’s failure to provide accrued paid Sick Leave to pilots who took Short-\n24  Term Military Leave violated the rights of Plaintiff and the Class under USERRA. Plaintiff also \n25  sought a declaration that Plaintiff and the Class were and are entitled under USERRA to receive \n26  contributions to their defined contribution retirement accounts in an amount that is consistent with \n27  USERRA § 4318 and that they are entitled to receive accrued paid Sick Leave in an amount that is \n28  consistent with USERRA § 4316, and an order that Southwest fully compensate Plaintiff and the \n \n  - 6 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  Class for their losses related to the alleged violations.  Southwest denies that Plaintiff or any \n2  members of the class is entitled to these or any other forms of relief.  \n3  C.  Plaintiff filed the Case as a putative class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \n4  Rules of Civil Procedure and alleged that the Case is maintainable as a class action under Rule \n5  23(a) and Rule 23(b)(1), Rule 23(b)(2), or Rule 23(b)(3).  \n6  D.  On August 31, 2017, Southwest moved to transfer venue to the United States \n7  District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  On September 15, 2017, the parties stipulated to \n8  a stay of the litigation to allow them to explore settlement following Plaintiff’s Opposition to the \n9  Motion to Transfer Venue.  Plaintiff’s opposition was filed on September 21, 2017, and the Court \n10  granted the stipulation the same day.  \n11  E.  From September 2017 through June 2018, the Parties engaged in informal \n12  discovery on both liability and potential damages for the purpose of exploring a settlement.  Using \n13  personnel data provided by Southwest, Class Counsel developed a methodology for calculating the \n14  potential alleged damages of Class Members.  \n15  F.  On June 26 and 27, 2018, the Parties attended a mediation in Dallas, Texas with the \n16  Honorable Deborah Hankinson, an experienced mediator and a former Texas Supreme Court \n17  Justice.  At the end of two days of arm’s-length negotiation, the Parties agreed to the basic terms \n18  set forth in a term sheet.  In the weeks that followed, the Parties continued to negotiate the details \n19  of a settlement, including how to allocate the Net Settlement Fund among the Settlement Class \n20  Members.   \n21  G.  The Parties intend this Settlement Agreement to be a final and complete resolution \n22  of all Claims asserted in this Action. The Settlement is a compromise of contested claims and shall \n23  not be deemed an admission by any Party as to the merits of any claim or defense. The Parties \n24  agree that the terms of the Settlement were negotiated in good faith at arm’s length by the Parties, \n25  and were reached voluntarily after consultation with competent legal counsel.  The Parties believe \n26  that the terms of this Settlement Agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate to the Proposed \n27  Settlement Class as a whole; that this Settlement Agreement provides substantial benefits to the \n28  Proposed Settlement Class and the Class Members; and that settlement of the Case on the terms \n \n  - 7 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  set forth in this Settlement Agreement is in the best interests of the Proposed Settlement Class and \n2  the Class Members.  \n3  H.  The purpose of this Settlement Agreement is to make a full, complete, and final \n4  resolution of all the Claims of Class Members that will be released pursuant to Section XIV of this \n5  Settlement Agreement \n6  I.  The Parties agree that Southwest’s agreement not to oppose Plaintiff’s motion for \n7  preliminary approval in the Northern District of California is without prejudice to Southwest’s \n8  contention that the proper forum for this action is the Northern District of Texas, and further agree \n9  that Southwest’s agreement not to oppose Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval in the \n10  Northern District of California will not be held against Southwest in the event that the Settlement \n11  is not approved, the parties return to active litigation, and Southwest re-notices its motion to \n12  transfer venue.  The Parties agree that upon the filing of the motion for preliminary approval, \n13  Southwest or the parties shall request the Court to administratively terminate its motion to transfer \n14  venue.   \n15    NOW, THEREFORE, in reliance on the mutual promises, covenants, releases, and \n16  obligations as set out in this Settlement Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, the \n17  Parties hereby stipulate and agree to resolve the Claims of Class Members that will be released \n18  pursuant to Section XIV of this Settlement Agreement.  \n19  IV.  THE SETTLEMENT CLASS \n20  A.  The Parties agree, for purposes of this Settlement Agreement, that the following \n21  class should be certified pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: All former or \n22  current pilots employed by Southwest who took Short-Term Military Leave from Southwest \n23  between January 1, 2001 and the Preliminary Approval Date.   \n24  B.   The Parties will cooperate and each use their best reasonable efforts to obtain \n25  certification of an opt-out class under Rule 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n26  Procedure.  \n27  C.  At the time that Plaintiff moves for preliminary approval of the Settlement, Plaintiff \n28  will also seek, and Southwest will not oppose, certification of the Settlement Class solely for the \n \n  - 8 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  purpose of Settlement.  \n2  D.  On the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement, all members of the Settlement \n3  Class will be bound by the Settlement Agreement’s terms, except that those Class Members who \n4  effectively and timely exercise a right to opt out of the Class and the Settlement will not be bound \n5  by the Settlement Agreement.  \n6  E.   In the event that the Court does not certify a class having a definition that is \n7  substantially similar to the Class definition set forth in this Settlement Agreement or otherwise \n8  requires the modification of material terms of this Settlement Agreement, each Party shall have the \n9  right to void this Settlement Agreement so long as notice of the exercise of such right is provided \n10  to the Court and the opposing Party within 14 days after the date on which the Court enters the \n11  order establishing the non-conforming Class definition or otherwise requiring the modification of \n12  material terms of this Settlement Agreement.  \n13  F.  The Parties will cooperate and use their best reasonable efforts to obtain the fullest \n14  possible participation of all Class Members in the Settlement.  \n15  V.  NOTICE \n16  A.  Southwest has identified 1,478 Class Members who dropped a trip to take Short-\n17  Term Military Leave from January 1, 2008 to the present (“previously identified Class \n18  Members”).  In addition, Southwest has identified approximately 500 additional former or current \n19  Southwest pilots who had a military status since January 1, 2001—whether or not they took \n20  military leave since that date—but have not been identified as part of the 1,478 Class Members \n21  (“potential Class Members”).   \n22  B.   If the Court certifies the Class and preliminarily approves the Settlement, the \n23  Settlement Administrator will provide the previously identified Class Members and potential Class \n24  Members with a copy of the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement and Fairness Hearing in \n25  the form agreed upon by the Parties, subject to modification and approval by the Court. The \n26  Notice will contain a brief description of the Claims advanced by the Class Representative, a \n27  summary of the terms of the proposed Settlement, and a notice of a fairness hearing to be held \n28 \n \n  - 9 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n2  C.   Subject to modification and approval by the Court, Notice shall be provided to \n3  each previously identified Class Member and potential Class Member as follows: (1) electronic \n4  notice by e-mail to all previously identified Class Members and potential Class Members for \n5  whom electronic information is available; and (2) direct notice by First Class Mail to all \n6  previously identified Class Members and potential Class Members.   \n7  D.  Southwest will cooperate with the Settlement Administrator and Class Counsel to \n8  facilitate providing Notice and other court-approved settlement-related communication by \n9  electronic means.                                                                                                                                                         \n10  E.  Publication Notice will be provided by a website that will contain information and \n11  documents about the Settlement.  This website shall be established by the Settlement \n12  Administrator and maintained from at least the date on which notice is mailed until the Court no \n13  longer maintains jurisdiction over this action.  \n14  F.  A Settlement Administrator will be retained to provide notice to the previously \n15  identified Class Members and potential Class Members and perform other services as set forth in \n16  this Settlement Agreement.  Within ten (10) business days of the Court’s Order Granting \n17  Preliminary Approval, Southwest shall provide the Settlement Administrator with the following \n18  contact information for each known Class Member and each pilot with military status who was \n19  employed by Southwest from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007, to the extent they are \n20  reasonably available in Southwest’s databases: (1) a street mailing address; (2) telephone \n21  number(s); (3) Southwest and personal e-mail address(es), including email accounts provided by \n22  Southwest; (4) Social Security number; (5) dates of known days with dropped trips for Short-Term \n23  Military Leave; and (6) the average annual rate of pay for pilots. \n24  VI.  SETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION FROM SOUTHWEST \n25  A.  In full settlement of all Claims that the Class Members will release pursuant to \n26  Section XIV, and in exchange for the consideration Southwest will receive as set forth in this \n27  Agreement, Southwest agrees to the following:  \n28  1.  Settlement Fund. Southwest will pay Five Million Eight Hundred \n \n  - 10 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  Thousand Dollars ($5,800,000) into an Escrow Account jointly selected by the \n2  parties that earns simple interest.  The Escrow Account, including any accrued \n3  interest, will be used to (i) make supplemental retirement contributions to Class \n4  Members’ 401(k) accounts to the greatest extent permitted under the law or, if it is \n5  not possible to make such supplemental retirement contributions to Class \n6  Members’ 401(k) accounts, as cash payments to Class Members for their claims \n7  related to USERRA make-up contributions during periods of Short-Term Military \n8  Leave, which shall be consistent with the Plan of Allocation, (ii) make payments of \n9  $1,000 each to former employees as consideration for the release of their Sick \n10  Leave Claims; (iii) award attorneys’ fees and costs, (iv) fund a Service Award to \n11  the Class Representative, (v) fund the costs of providing notice to the Class and \n12  administrating the Settlement, and (vi) pay any applicable taxes.  \n13  2.  Sick Leave Accrual for Periods of Short-Term Military Leave.  \n14  a.  For each day in which a Class Member dropped a trip to take Short-\n15  Term Military Leave from January 1, 2008 to the Preliminary Approval Date, \n16  Southwest will add to the pilot’s Sick Leave balance 100% of the pilot’s unaccrued \n17  Sick Leave TFPs based on a rate of 7.1 TFPs per day with dropped trips for Short-\n18  Term Military Leave and a rate of 1 TFP of unaccrued  Sick Leave for every 10 \n19  TFPs of dropped trips.2  For each Class Member who submits a sworn writing to \n20  the Settlement Administrator stating each month that he or she took Short-Term \n21  Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2007, Southwest will \n22  add to the pilot’s Sick Leave balance 8.5 TFPs of Sick Leave per year in which the \n23 \n                                              \n24 \n2 For example, if a pilot dropped a single day of scheduled work to perform Short-Term Military \nLeave between January 1, 2008 and the date of Preliminary Approval, the pilot would receive an \n25 \nadditional 0.71 TFP of Sick Leave in the pilot’s Sick Leave balance, based upon an estimated 7.1 \n26  dropped TFP and a Sick Leave accrual rate of 1 TFP for every 10 TFP.  If a pilot dropped 10 days \nof work to perform Short-Term Military Leave between January 1, 2008 and the date of \n27  Preliminary Approval, the pilot would receive 7.1 TFP of Sick Leave in the pilot’s Sick Leave \nbalance, based upon an estimated 71 dropped TFP and a Sick Leave accrual rate of 1 TFP for \n28 \nevery 10 TFP. \n \n  - 11 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  pilot took Short-Term Military Leave.  If a Class Member is no longer employed by \n2  Southwest 30 days after the Effective Date of the Settlement, the Class Member \n3  shall receive a $1,000 share of the Net Settlement Fund, in addition to any \n4  supplemental retirement contributions or payments he or she is entitled to receive \n5  under the Plan of Allocation, except that if a Class Member has elected to exchange \n6  accrued Sick Leave for continued health coverage upon retirement and the Class \n7  Member is still receiving those continued benefits on the date of the distribution of \n8  Sick Leave, that Class Member will receive additional accrued Sick Leave in the \n9  same manner as current Southwest employees.  The $1,000 shares of the Settlement \n10  Fund shall be allocated to Class Members before the Class Members’ shares are \n11  determined for claims related to USERRA make-up contributions.   \n12  b.   The funding of each Class Member’s Sick Leave balance pursuant \n13  to this settlement will be capped at 1600 TFPs per pilot, which is the maximum \n14  balance that a pilot can accrue pursuant to the CBA.   \n15  c.  The process for Class Members to provide a sworn writing to the \n16  Settlement Administrator stating each month that the pilot took Short-Term \n17  Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2007, is set forth in \n18  Section VII(C).  The Settlement Administrator will determine for each Class \n19  Member how many accrued Sick Leave TFP will be added to the Class Member’s \n20  Sick Leave balance, based upon Southwest’s personnel data from 2008 to the \n21  Preliminary Approval Date and Class Members’ claim forms that identify the years \n22  in which they took Short-Term Military Leave between January 1, 2001 and \n23  December 31, 2007.  \n24  d.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date, Southwest will add to each \n25  Class Member’s Sick Leave balance the amount of accrued Sick Leave TFP that \n26  the Settlement Administrator determines will be added pursuant to this Section. \n27  B.  In addition to the consideration described in the preceding paragraphs, and in \n28  exchange for the consideration it will receive as set forth in this Agreement, Southwest agrees to \n \n  - 12 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  implement the non-monetary relief set forth herein in Section X.  \n \n2 \nVII.  IDENTIFYING THE CLASS MEMBERS AND SHORT-TERM MILITARY \nLEAVE TAKEN FROM 2001 TO 2007 \n3 \nA.  Although the Class Period in this Case extends as far back as January 1, 2001, \n4 \nSouthwest does not possess comprehensive records to identify which Southwest pilots took Short-\n5 \nTerm Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2007.  Because of this gap in \n6 \ndata, it is possible that the parties cannot through Southwest’s own records identify all members of \n7 \nthe Settlement Class.  And to provide appropriate credit under the Plan of Allocation to Class \n8 \nMembers who took Short-Term Military Leave between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, \n9 \nit is necessary for Class Members to identify when they took Short-Term Military Leave between \n10 \nJanuary 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007.  The parties agree that persons will have an opportunity \n11 \nto demonstrate their membership in the Class if Southwest has not already identified them as Class \n12 \nMembers, and will have the opportunity to identify the amount of time that they took Short-Term \n13 \nMilitary Leave between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007. \n14 \nB.  Class membership will be based on the data provided by Southwest to the \n15 \nSettlement Administrator about which pilots took Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, \n16 \n2001 through the Preliminary Approval Date, unless, pursuant to the following procedure (or \n17 \nanother procedure ordered by the Court) a person provides the Settlement Administrator with \n18 \ninformation that demonstrates that the person meets the definition of a Class Member.    \n19 \na.  Before the Final Approval date, and by a deadline to be established by the \n20 \nCourt, any person who claims to meet the definition of a Class Member but who has not \n21 \nbeen identified by Southwest as a Class Member will be entitled to demonstrate \n22 \nmembership in the Settlement Class to the satisfaction of the Settlement Administrator.  A \n23 \nperson may make this showing by: (1) submitting a sworn statement to the Settlement \n24 \nAdministrator that the person was a Southwest pilot who took Short-Term Military Leave \n25 \nbetween January 1, 2001 and the date of Preliminary Approval, and (2) demonstrating \n26 \nthrough documentary evidence or having Southwest verify, upon a request from the \n27 \nSettlement Administrator, that the person was a Southwest pilot during the Class Period.  \n28 \n \n  - 13 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  Within five business days (or another period ordered by the Court) of when a person \n2  submits a sworn statement to demonstrate that he or she is a Class Member, the Settlement \n3  Administrator shall submit a request to Southwest for Southwest to identify whether the \n4  person was a pilot for Southwest during the Class Period.  If Southwest agrees that the \n5  person was a pilot for Southwest during the Class Period, the person shall be deemed to \n6  have been a Southwest pilot during the Class Period.  If Southwest does not agree that the \n7  person was a pilot for Southwest during the Class Period, the Settlement Administrator \n8  shall send a deficiency letter to the person requiring the person to provide documentary \n9  evidence to demonstrate that he or she was a pilot for Southwest during the Class Period \n10  and return that evidence within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the deficiency letter (or \n11  another period ordered by the Court).  If the person submits such documentary evidence, \n12  the Settlement Administrator will determine whether the person was employed by \n13  Southwest as a pilot during the Class Period.   \n14  b.  To the extent that a person demonstrates membership in the Settlement \n15  Class to the satisfaction of the Settlement Administrator, that person will be included in the \n16  Settlement Class and Southwest will provide the Settlement Administrator with any \n17  available relevant data from the period of January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2013 that is \n18  necessary to perform calculations regarding that person’s Sick Leave and share of the Net \n19  Settlement Fund pursuant to the Plan of Allocation for the period covering January 1, 2008 \n20  to December 31, 2013.  A person who demonstrates his or her membership in the Class \n21  shall have the same opportunity as other Class Members to identify the amount of Short-\n22  Term Military Leave that the person took between January 1, 2001 and December 31, \n23  2007, as described in Section VII(C). \n24  C.  For the months between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, Class Members \n25  will have an opportunity to identify the number of days each month in which they took Short-\n26  Term Military Leave and those days of Short-Term Military Leave shall be taken into account to \n27  determine the Class Member’s share of the Net Settlement Fund pursuant to the Plan of Allocation \n28  and to determine whether the Class Member will receive 8.5 TFP of accrued Sick Leave for a year \n \n  - 14 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  in which the Class Member took Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 and December \n2  31, 2007.  Pursuant to the following procedure, Class Members shall provide the Settlement \n3  Administrator with information on the number of days each month in which they took Short-Term \n4  Military Leave from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007. \n5  a.  Before the Final Approval date, and by 120 days after the date that Notice is \n6  mailed to the Class (or a deadline to be established by the Court), any Class Member who \n7  took Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007 shall submit \n8  to the Settlement Administrator an online claim form signed under oath that identifies for \n9  each month between January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007 the number of days in which \n10  the Class Member engaged in military service for a period of 14 consecutive days or less.  \n11  The claim form will advise pilots that, before singing the claims form under oath, they \n12  should make reasonable efforts to confirm their claims with their own personal records of \n13  military service or the records of military service reasonably available to them through the \n14  military.    \n15  b.   Upon receipt of timely online claim forms, the Settlement Administrator \n16  shall determine for each month between January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007 the number \n17  of days of military service for periods of 14 consecutive days or less that each Class \n18  Member identified in his or her online claim form.  These days of military leave shall be \n19  considered for the purpose of the Plan of Allocation that will be approved by the Court.  \n20  c.  Upon receipt of timely online claim forms, the Settlement Administrator \n21  shall determine for each year between January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007 whether each \n22  Class Member had any days of military service for periods of 14 consecutive days or less, \n23  and for each such year Southwest will add to the pilot’s Sick Leave balance 8.5 TFPs of \n24  Sick Leave.   \n25  VIII.  DISTRIBUTION FROM THE SETTLEMENT FUND \n26  A.  Payment of Cash Settlement Amount into Escrow Account: Within seven (7) \n27  calendar days of the Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement, Southwest will deposit the Cash \n28  Settlement Amount into an Escrow Account that will accrue simple interest.  The Escrow Account \n \n  - 15 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  will be established by the Settlement Administrator, with the Settlement Administrator acting at \n2  the joint direction of Lead Class Counsel and Southwest in administering the Escrow Account.  \n3  The Cash Settlement Amount plus any interest on the Cash Settlement Amount while in escrow \n4  will constitute the Settlement Fund.  The Cash Settlement Amount excludes individual investment \n5  earnings and no Class Member is entitled to investment earnings on his or her allocation of the \n6  Settlement Fund in accordance with his or her investment directions under the 401(k) Plan. \n7  B.  Qualified Settlement Fund: To the extent possible and at the earliest date \n8  possible, the Settlement Fund is intended by the Parties to be a “qualified settlement fund” for \n9  federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-1. \n10  C.   Attorneys’ Fees & Expenses: Pursuant to the deadline set by the Court and no \n11  later than fourteen (14) days prior to the deadline(s) by which Class Members must object and/or \n12  opt out of the Settlement (if opt-outs are permitted), Class Counsel will file any motion requesting \n13  the payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses/costs, and/or a Service Award from the Settlement Fund.  \n14  D.   Distribution and Allocation of the Settlement Fund to Class Members:  \n15  A.  Subject to Section VIII(G) below, the Net Settlement Fund will be \n16  distributed to Class Members after the payment of any award of attorneys’ fees, reimbursement of \n17  any expenses, any Service Award to the Class Representative from the Settlement Fund, and any \n18  applicable taxes or withholdings.  \n19  B.  Class Counsel and Southwest will submit a joint Proposed Plan of \n20  Allocation to the Court for the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund in the form attached hereto \n21  as Exhibit A.  The Proposed Plan of Allocation is subject to approval or modification by the Court.  \n22  If the Court rejects the Proposed Plan of Allocation, the Parties will meet and confer and propose a \n23  Revised Proposed Plan of Allocation.  If the Court rejects the Revised Proposed Plan of \n24  Allocation, the Parties will ask the Court to implement a Plan of Allocation that satisfies the \n25  Court.  If the Proposed Plan of Allocation is rejected or modified by the Court or on appeal, such \n26  modification will not constitute a material modification of the Settlement, will not void the \n27  Settlement Agreement, and will not provide a basis for either party to withdraw from the \n28  Settlement Agreement. \n \n  - 16 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  C.   Before the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund, the Settlement \n2  Administrator will determine which persons are Class Members and the share of the Net \n3  Settlement Fund that each of the Class Members will receive pursuant to the Plan of Allocation \n4  approved by the Court, including all Class Members who identify themselves to the satisfaction of \n5  the Settlement Administrator and all periods of Short-Term Military Leave that are identified by \n6  Class Members between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, to the satisfaction of the \n7  Settlement Administrator, through the process set forth in Section VII of this Settlement \n8  Agreement.   \n9  D.  As described in section VIII(I), once the Settlement Administrator has \n10  determined the share of the Net Settlement Fund each Class Member will receive, the Settlement \n11  Administrator will work with Southwest to determine the amount of each Class Member’s \n12  payment that can be put directly into the Class Member’s 401(k) account on a tax-deferred basis.  \n13  Any payments that can be made directly into the Class Member’s 401(k) account on a tax-deferred \n14  basis will be placed directly into each Class Member’s 401(k) account, and whatever amounts \n15  cannot be placed into the 401(k) account on a tax-deferred basis will be paid to Class Members \n16  through checks less any necessary tax deductions.  No payments to Class Members shall be made \n17  until Southwest receives a final response from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on whether \n18  the payments can be made into the Class Members’ 401(k) accounts on a tax-deferred basis.  \n19  E.  No portion of the Cash Settlement Amount or the Settlement Fund, including any \n20  undistributed monies, will revert to Southwest.  \n21  F.   Maximizing Distributions To the 401(k) Plan: All distributions to the 401(k) \n22  Plan, including Plan Amounts, distributed pursuant to this Settlement Agreement are intended to \n23  be corrective contributions for specific years covered by this Settlement Agreement. To the \n24  maximum extent that such contributions on behalf of the members of the Class can be made in \n25  compliance with the applicable IRS limits for each such year without jeopardizing the tax-\n26  qualified status of the 401(k) Plan, Southwest will use its best reasonable efforts to obtain and \n27  maximize the tax-favored treatment of the distributions made pursuant to this Settlement \n28  Agreement, and will submit an application for correction under the Employee Plan Compliance \n \n  - 17 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  Resolution System, as set forth in Revenue Procedure 2016-51, or later guidance, so that the Plan \n2  Amounts contributed on behalf of each Class Member reflect corrective contributions for the \n3  corresponding year(s) in which they allegedly should have been allocated to the Class Member’s \n4  Plan account. Southwest will provide copies to Class Counsel of any correspondence to and from \n5  the IRS regarding the implementation of such corrective procedures related to the Settlement.  The \n6  Net Settlement Fund will not be contributed or distributed to Class Members until such time as \n7  Southwest receives a favorable compliance statement from the IRS in response to its application \n8  under the Employee Plan Compliance Resolution System, which may take one or more years. If \n9  Southwest does not receive a compliance statement from the IRS, then contributions will be \n10  distributed to Class Members as set forth above and will not be contributed to the Class Members’ \n11  401(k) Plan accounts.     \n12  G.  Taxes   \n13  1.  Payment of Taxes on the Settlement Fund: Following the Effective Date \n14  and the deposit of the Cash Settlement Amount into the Escrow Account, the Settlement \n15  Administrator shall to the extent necessary establish a reserve (the “Tax Reserve”) within \n16  the Settlement Fund to pay any taxes that are or will be owed (but not yet due) and for \n17  expenses related to payment of taxes and filing returns.  \n18  2.   Taxation of Payments to Class Members: As described in Section \n19  VIII(G) above, the Parties will work collaboratively to maximize the amount of Class \n20  Members’ payments that will be made directly into their 401(k) accounts to defer taxes on \n21  those payments.  However, to the extent that any amount of a Class Member’s payments \n22  must be made to them in cash and not directly into their 401(k) accounts, the Settlement \n23  Administrator shall withhold and remit to tax authorities any federal or state taxes, file the \n24  required tax forms, and issue the required IRS forms to the Class Members.  To the extent \n25  that the Settlement Administrator determines that payroll taxes should be withheld from \n26  the payments that Class Members receive from the Net Settlement Fund, both the \n27  employee and employer share of the payroll taxes shall be paid from the Net Settlement \n28  Fund. \n \n  - 18 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  3.  IRS Guidance: Southwest will submit an application for correction under \n2  the Employee Plan Compliance Resolution System, as set forth in Revenue Procedure \n3  2016-51, on what amounts of the Class Members’ payments from the Net Settlement Fund \n4  may be deposited directly into the 401(k) Plan, and will use reasonable best efforts to \n5  expedite the final guidance from the IRS.  \n6  4.   Responsibility for Tax Liabilities: Southwest will not be held responsible \n7  for any tax liabilities associated with payments made to Class Members.   \n8  H.  Distribution By Southwest as the 401(k) Plan Sponsor:  \n9  1.  By no later than 30 days after the Effective Date (or within another period \n10  set forth by the Court), the Settlement Administrator will provide counsel for the Parties \n11  and Southwest, the 401(k) Plan sponsor, with a spreadsheet that details the monetary \n12  allocation from the Net Settlement Fund to which each Class Member is entitled for each \n13  year covered by the Settlement Agreement, as determined by the Settlement Administrator \n14  under the Plan of Allocation approved by the Court.  \n15  2.   By no later than 30 days after receiving the information in Paragraph 1 (or \n16  within another period set by the Court), or 30 days after receiving final confirmation from \n17  the IRS about making the Class Members’ payments directly into the 401(k) account on a \n18  tax-deferred basis, whichever is later, Southwest will inform the Settlement Administrator \n19  in writing for each Class Member (a) the Plan Amount, and (b) what amount of each Class \n20  Member’s Settlement Fund allocation, corresponding to each year covered by the \n21  Settlement Agreement, cannot be contributed to the Class Member’s 401(k) Account for \n22  each such year without jeopardizing the tax-qualified status of the 401(k) Plan under \n23  applicable IRS limits (the “Cash Amount”).  In the event that Southwest determines that \n24  more time than 270 days from the Effective Date is needed to ensure that the allocation of \n25  the Net Settlement Fund to Class Member 401(k) accounts will not jeopardize the tax-\n26  exempt status of the 401(k) Plan, Southwest shall promptly notify Class Counsel of the \n27  reasons for that determination.  Should the Parties have a dispute about when the allocation \n28  of the Net Settlement Fund or payments should be made, any party may move the Court \n \n  - 19 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  for an order regarding when the allocation or payments should occur. \n2  3.  Except for those Settlement Fund monies that cannot be paid to a Class \n3  Member’s 401(k) account because of applicable IRS limits, the Settlement Administrator \n4  will transmit to Southwest in the form of a cash payment the Plan Amounts within the \n5  period set by the Court, which shall not in any event be earlier than the Effective Date.  \n6  4.  Once the Plan Amounts have been transmitted from the Settlement \n7  Administrator to Southwest in its capacity as Plan sponsor, Southwest will distribute or \n8  cause to be distributed the Plan Amounts to each Class Member’s 401(k) account in the \n9  amounts previously identified.  \n10  5.   The Settlement Administrator will distribute the respective Cash Amounts, \n11  if any, to the Class Members at or about the same time that the Plan Amounts are \n12  transmitted from the Settlement Administrator to Southwest, and will withhold and remit \n13  to tax authorities any relevant taxes from those Cash Amounts.  \n14  6.  Class Members shall have 180 days to cash their checks for any Cash \n15  Amounts received.  Any amount remaining unclaimed after that point shall be provided to \n16  a cy pres entity agreed upon by the parties.  30 days before the 180 days have expired, the \n17  Settlement Administrator will mail a postcard to any Class Members who have not yet \n18  cashed their checks reminding them to cash their checks within the 180-day period. \n19  IX.  SETTLEMENT ADMINISTRATION \n20  A.  Settlement Administrator: The Settlement Administrator will be agreed to by the \n21  Parties and approved by the Court.  Any proposed Settlement Administrator will have experience \n22  providing notice to Class Members in employment or employee benefit class action settlements, \n23  and in supervising and administering large and complex settlement funds.  The Parties will issue a \n24  request for proposal to at least several potential settlement administrators for bids, and the request \n25  for proposal will include a request that the settlement administrators indemnify Southwest for any \n26  data breach related to the Class Members.  The Settlement Administrator will undertake the \n27  following to administer this Settlement consistent with the terms of this Settlement, the Proposed \n28  Plan of Allocation as approved by the Court, and such other procedures or provisions as \n \n  - 20 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  established or approved by the Court:  \n2  1.  Print and mail and e-mail the Class Notice Packet to the previously \n3  identified Class Members and potential Class Members in a manner consistent with that \n4  directed by the Court and undertake a single trace and re-mailing for all undeliverable \n5  Notice Packets;  \n6  2.  Establish a web site that includes information on the Settlement and that \n7  includes a claim form that permits individuals to identify themselves as Class Members \n8  and that permits Class Members to identify the number of days that they took Short-Term \n9  Military Leave from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007; \n10  3.  Provide Counsel for the Parties with copies of all written objections to the \n11  Settlement Agreement, any request for exclusions from the Class, and all claim forms that \n12  identify persons as Class Members and/or identify the number of days that they took Short-\n13  Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007;  \n14  4.   Maintain and staff a toll-free phone number and a website until the Court \n15  no longer exercises jurisdiction over this Case; \n16  5.   Establish and manage a Qualified Settlement Fund, establish and manage \n17  an Escrow Account, and submit any tax return and/or tax payments to tax authorities \n18  regarding the Qualified Settlement Fund and the Escrow Account; \n19  6.   Provide the Plan Amounts and Sick Leave amounts to Southwest, disburse \n20  the Cash Amounts to the Class Members, and withhold and remit relevant taxes on the \n21  Cash Amounts disbursed to Class Members;   \n22  7.  Track the status of mailing and re-mailing of Notice Packets, the status of \n23  Plan Amounts disbursed to Southwest, the status of Cash Amounts disbursed to Class \n24  Members, the status of accrued Sick Leave added to the Sick Leave balances of Class \n25  Members, and the date of receipt of written objections or challenges filed by any Class \n26  Members;  \n27  8.  Provide monthly reporting to the Parties regarding the items above until the \n28  Effective Date, and thereafter provide quarterly reporting to the Parties until the Court no \n \n  - 21 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  longer exercises jurisdiction over this Case.  \n2  X.  NON-MONETARY SETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION \n3  A.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement, Southwest will \n4  modify its policy to allow pilots to accrue Sick Leave during periods of Short-Term Military \n5  Leave.  Pilots who take Short-Term Military Leave will accrue Sick Leave for Short-Term \n6  Military Leave at the same rate that pilots accrue Sick Leave during other forms of leaves of \n7  absence for which pilots accrue Sick Leave.  \n8  B.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement, Southwest will \n9  (i) identify in all Southwest pilots’ monthly paystubs the dollar amount of Deemed Earnings TFP \n10  associated with their military leave for the relevant month; (ii) provide Southwest pilots individual \n11  monthly emails that state the number of TFP for retirement plan purposes that the pilot earned in \n12  the prior month (e.g., June’s statement will show the TFPs for May); and (iii) implement a \n13  procedure such that a Southwest pilot may ask a designated Southwest human resources employee \n14  to provide him or her with detailed information on how the pilot’s Deemed Earnings TFP for the \n15  prior month was calculated after the conclusion of each monthly pay period, and Southwest will \n16  provide that information as soon as administratively feasible, which ordinarily should not exceed \n17  30 days after the request is made and will not exceed 60 days after the request is made.  In \n18  addition, Southwest will consider the feasibility of automatically providing pilots detailed \n19  information on each pilot’s Deemed Earnings TFP for the prior month on a monthly basis, via \n20  email or otherwise. \n21  XI.  ATTORNEYS’ FEES, EXPENSES, COSTS, AND SERVICE AWARD \n22  A.  Class Counsel will be entitled to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and \n23  reimbursement of expenses and costs from the Settlement Fund subject to the approval of and in \n24  an amount determined by the Court. Any award of attorneys’ fees or reimbursement of expenses to \n25  Class Counsel will be paid out of the Settlement Fund in an amount determined by the Court.  \n26  B.  In recognition of the service that the Class Representative has performed on behalf \n27  of the Class and/or for reimbursement of his time and expenses, Class Counsel will be entitled to \n28  seek a Service Award to be paid out of the Settlement Fund for the Class Representative, Plaintiff \n \n  - 22 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  Jayson Huntsman, subject to the approval of and in an amount to be approved by the Court.  \n2  C.   Southwest will not take any position with respect to Class Counsel’s request for an \n3  award of attorneys’ fees, reimbursement of expenses or costs, and the Service Award, so long as \n4  the request for such attorneys’ fees does not exceed $1,740,000 plus any expenses.  Southwest will \n5  not take any position with respect to Plaintiff’s request for an award of a Service Award for the \n6  Class Representative, so long as the request for such a Service Award does not exceed $2,000 plus \n7  reimbursement for any lost compensation and out-of-pocket expenses that the Class \n8  Representative experienced due to his service to the Class and participation in the Litigation.  \n9  D.  On the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement, Class Counsel will be entitled \n10  to a disbursement from the Settlement Fund equal to the amount of attorneys’ fees, expenses/costs \n11  and the Service Award as awarded by the Court, and will be entitled to distribute any Service \n12  Award to the Class Representative consistent with the Court’s order granting Final Approval.  In \n13  the event that there is an appeal of the Final Approval of the Settlement Agreement solely on the \n14  issue of the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs, within 30 days of the notice of appeal Class \n15  Counsel will be entitled to a disbursement from the Settlement Fund of such amount of the \n16  attorneys’ fees and/or such amount of expenses/costs as to which there is no objection.  \n17  XII.

Within 15 days of the date on which this Settlement Agreement is fully executed by \n20  or on behalf of all Parties, Plaintiff shall submit this Settlement Agreement and its Exhibits to the \n21  Court along with a motion for its preliminary approval, a motion seeking certification of the class \n22  and appointment of Class Counsel, a plan for providing Notice to the Class Members, and a \n23  recommendation of a Settlement Administrator to perform their respective duties set forth in this \n24  Settlement Agreement.

Establish the date by which the Notice will be mailed to Class Members and \n6  the date and procedure by which Class Members must opt out (should the Court provide \n7  Class Members an opportunity to opt out);  \n8  6.  Appoint a Settlement Administrator to perform the duties set forth in this \n9  Settlement Agreement;  \n10  7.  Establish a date by which persons may identify themselves as Class \n11  Members and/or identify the months and number of days that they took Short-Term \n12  Military Leave from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007, and a date by which the \n13  Settlement Administrator must make determinations with respect to membership in the \n14  Class and the months and number of days that Class Members took Short-Term Military \n15  Leave from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007; \n16  8.  Set a date and procedure by which objections from Class Members must be \n17  filed and by which individuals must exclude themselves from the Class;  \n18  9.  Set a date for the fairness hearing at which time the Court will determine \n19  whether the Settlement Agreement should be approved under Rule 23(e) of the Federal \n20  Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n21  B.  Southwest will not oppose Plaintiff’s motions for preliminary approval of the \n22  Settlement Agreement, certification of the Class, approval of the Notice, and appointment of \n23  Plaintiff’s counsel as Class Counsel.  \n24  C.   No later than thirty (30) days before the Fairness Hearing, the Settlement \n25  Administrator shall file with the Court a declaration confirming compliance with the Notice \n26  procedures approved by the Court.  \n27  D.  At the fairness hearing, the Parties will jointly request that the Court finally \n28  approve this Settlement Agreement pursuant to Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n \n  - 24 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  The Parties agree to take all actions necessary to obtain approval of this Settlement Agreement \n2  consistent with their ethical duties and obligations to their clients and, as to Class Counsel, the \n3  Settlement Class.  \n4  E.  The Parties reserve the right, subject to the Court’s approval, to request any \n5  reasonable extensions of time that might be necessary to carry out any of the provisions of this \n6  Settlement Agreement.  In addition, upon a showing of good cause the Settlement Administrator \n7  may extend any deadline for a person to submit information about membership in the Class or \n8  submit information on the number of days of Short-Term Military Leave a Class Member took \n9  from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2007. \n10   \n11   \n12  XIII.  COURT SUPERVISION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT & DISMISSAL \n13  OF THE ACTION \n14  A.  If the Court preliminarily approves the Settlement, the Parties will jointly agree to \n15  seek an order and final judgment dismissing the case with prejudice consistent with Rules 41(a)(2) \n16  and 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, subject to the terms of the Settlement \n17  Agreement and subject to the Court’s continuing jurisdiction as set forth in this section.  \n18  B.  The Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction over this action beyond the Final \n19  Approval Date for a period of three years from the Final Approval Date.  If all payments \n20  contemplated by the Settlement Agreement have not been made after three years from the Final \n21  Approval Date, the Parties shall inform the Court that certain payments have not yet been made \n22  and the Court shall extend its continuing jurisdiction until all such payments have been made.  \n23  C.  The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court and shall be bound by \n24  the terms of this Settlement Agreement, including, without limitation, disputes related to \n25  interpreting, implementing, and enforcing the Settlement embodied in this Settlement Agreement, \n26  and will request that the Court retain jurisdiction to hear any such disputes.  If Plaintiff or a \n27  member of the Class prevails in securing relief in the event of a violation or breach of the \n28  Settlement Agreement by Southwest, the Court shall have discretion to award Class Counsel \n \n  - 25 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  attorneys’ fees and costs against Southwest.   \n2  D.  The waiver by one Party of any breach of this Settlement Agreement by any other \n3  Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other breach of this Settlement Agreement. The \n4  provisions of this Settlement Agreement may not be waived except by a writing signed by the \n5  affected Party, or counsel for that Party, or orally on the record in court proceedings.  \n6  XIV.  RELEASE OF CLAIMS \n7  A.  Upon the Effective Date of this Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff and all other Class \n8  Members (including their respective heirs, beneficiaries, executors, administrators, estates, agents, \n9  attorneys, predecessors, successors, and assigns) release and fully and finally settle, relinquish, \n10  waive and discharge, any and all claims, actions, demands, damages, rights, obligations, expenses, \n11  costs, causes of action, or liabilities, known or unknown, against Southwest, the 401(k) Plan \n12  administrator, the 401(k) Plan sponsor, the 401(k) Plan, 401(k) Plan fiduciaries, and their parents, \n13  subsidiaries, agents, employees, and other affiliated persons or entities that (1) arise from or relate \n14  to the accrual of Sick Leave during periods of Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 \n15  through the date of Preliminary Approval, or (2) arise from or relate to employee or employer \n16  contributions to Class Members’ 401(k) accounts arising from or related to periods of Short-Term \n17  Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2013, including those related to the \n18  failure to provide Class Members with information regarding their 401(k) accounts, Short-Term \n19  Military Leave, or Deemed Earnings to facilitate additional contributions to Class Members’ \n20  401(k) accounts based on Short-Term Military Leave.   \n21  B.   In the event that the Court certifies the Class under Rule 23(b)(3) or otherwise \n22  permits Class Members to opt out of the Class, this release shall not apply to any Class Member \n23  who successfully opts out of the Settlement Agreement pursuant to the deadlines and procedures \n24  established by the Court.  \n25  XV.  TERMINATION OF THE SETTLEMENT \n26  A.  In the event that Final Approval is not entered by the Court or the Settlement is \n27  materially modified by the Court, either Class Counsel or Southwest may void this Settlement \n28  Agreement.  \n \n  - 26 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  B.  In the event that the Court certifies the Class under Rule 23(b)(3) or otherwise \n2  permits Class Members to opt out of the Class, Southwest will have the unilateral right by no later \n3  than seven (7) calendar days before the Final Approval hearing to withdraw from the Settlement \n4  and resume the Litigation if more than 50 Class Members opt out of the Class and the Settlement.  \n5  C.  In the event that Final Approval is reversed on appeal, or in the event that either \n6  Class Counsel or Southwest exercises a right to withdraw from the Settlement Agreement within \n7  the times specified in this Agreement prior to the Final Approval Date, (1) the Settlement Fund \n8  (including any interest or other earnings, but excluding any amount paid or owing for taxes or that \n9  is necessary to prepare any tax returns, or that is owed to the Settlement Administrator) shall be \n10  returned to Southwest, (2) Southwest will not be released from the claims asserted in the \n11  Litigation, and (3) the Parties will return to their respective positions in the Litigation as of the day \n12  before this Settlement Agreement was executed.  \n13  XVI.  CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT NOTICE \n14  A.  Pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (“CAFA”), within ten (10) days \n15  of the filing of the Preliminary Approval Motion, Southwest, at its own expense, shall prepare and \n16  provide notices and materials required by CAFA set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b)(1)-(8) to the \n17  Attorney General of the United States and the Attorneys General of all states in which any \n18  members of the Class reside or any other Appropriate Federal official or Appropriate State Official \n19  identified by the Court (“Appropriate State and Federal Officials”).  \n20  B.  At the time that the Preliminary Approval Motion is filed, Southwest will identify \n21  to the best of its knowledge and ability, the states in which any Class Members reside.

Southwest will provide Class Counsel with a copy of the proposed notice and \n \n  - 27 -  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: BF3C95CD-A2B3-4EA0-8CB3-1A835960588D\n \n \n \n \n1  materials that Southwest intends to send to the Appropriate State and Federal Officials as soon as \n2  practicable, but no later than 1 business day, before such materials are sent.  \n3  D.  To ensure compliance with CAFA, 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d), the Preliminary Approval \n4  Motion will request that the Court set the Final Approval Hearing for a date no earlier than ninety \n5  (90) days after the date that Southwest is required to provide notice under 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b).  \n6  XVII.

The Net Settlement Fund and Authorized Claimants  \nThe Net Settlement Fund1 in this case shall be distributed on behalf of or to Class \nMembers who (1) either have been identified as such by Southwest or who have been determined \nby the Settlement Administrator to be Class Members, and (2) have not successfully opted out of \nthe Settlement (“Authorized Claimants”). \n2.  Sick Leave Payments for Class Members No Longer Employed \nBefore any shares of the Net Settlement Fund are allocated for Class Members’ claims \nrelated to USERRA make-up contributions, each Authorized Claimant who is no longer \nemployed by Southwest 30 days after the Effective Date of the Settlement shall be allocated a \n$1,000 share of the Net Settlement Fund, except that if a Class Member has elected to exchange \naccrued sick leave for continued health coverage upon retirement and the Class Member is still \nreceiving those continued benefits on the date of the distribution of sick leave, that Class \nMember will receive additional accrued sick leave in the same manner as current Southwest \nemployees.  The $1,000 shares of the Net Settlement Fund shall not reduce the amount of \nsupplemental retirement contributions or payments the Authorized Claimant who is no longer \nemployed by Southwest at the time of the Effective Date of the Settlement is entitled to receive \nunder this Plan of Allocation.  The total amount of these $1,000 shares allocated to Authorized \nClaimants who are no longer employed by Southwest 30 days after the Effective Date of the \nSettlement shall be referred to as the “Former Employee Sick Leave Settlement Shares.”   \n                                                           \n1 Unless otherwise defined in this Plan of Allocation, capitalized terms have the meanings ascribed \nto them in the Settlement Agreement. In all instances of discrepancy or ambiguity in definitions \nor otherwise, the terms of the Settlement Agreement shall control. \n1 \n \n\n3.  Recognized Claims  \nThe Settlement Administrator shall determine each Authorized Claimant’s pro rata share \nof the Net Settlement Fund less the Former Employee Sick Leave Settlement Shares based upon \neach Authorized Claimant’s “Recognized Claims.”  Each Authorized Claimant’s Recognized \nClaims shall be determined based upon the aggregate of the potential matching retirement \ncontributions described in Section 2(A) and 2(B) below.   \nA.  Potential Matching Retirement Contributions for Short-Term Military \nLeave From 2008 to 2013  \n \n  Based upon the personnel data provided by Southwest for the period of January 1, 2008 \nthrough December 31, 2013, for every period in which an Authorized Claimant took Short-Term \nMilitary Leave and dropped one or more trips between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013, \nthe Authorized Claimant shall have potential matching retirement contributions based on the \nfollowing calculation:  \n(1) Each day of Short-Term Military Leave in which a trip was dropped shall be \nmultiplied by 7.1 TFP, then multiplied by the average base wage rate of the pilot in the same \nyear, and then multiplied by the maximum percentage of a pilot’s pensionable pay that \nSouthwest would match under the CBA during the same year2 (“matching make-up contributions \nper period of Short-Term Military Leave”).  \n(2) For each year from 2008 to 2013, sum the matching make-up contributions per period \nof Short-Term Military Leave; however, for any single year in which the sum of the matching \nmake-up contributions per period of Short-Term Military Leave plus the amount of matching \n                                                           \n2 Southwest matched 7.3% of pensionable pay between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008, \n7.8%  of  pensionable  pay  between  January  1,  2009  and  December  31,  2009,  and  9.3%  of \npensionable pay between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014. \n2 \n \n\nretirement contributions that Southwest made for that pilot during that year exceeds $25,000, \nthen in that year the Authorized Claimant shall have potential matching retirement contributions \nequal to $25,000 minus the amount of matching retirement contributions that Southwest \npreviously made for that pilot during that year.3 \n(3) Sum the annual amounts of matching retirement contributions calculated in (2).  \nB.  Potential Matching Retirement Contributions for Short-Term Military \nLeave From 2001 to 2007  \n \nThe potential matching retirement contributions for periods between January 1, 2001 and \nDecember 31, 2007 shall be calculated based upon the number of days of Short-Term Military \nLeave that Authorized Claimants identify as having taken between January 1, 2001 and \nDecember 31, 2007, in timely claim forms submitted to and approved by the Settlement \nAdministrator, based upon the following calculation:  \n(1) For each month between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007 in which an \nAuthorized Claimant identified himself or herself as having taken Short-Term Military Leave, \nthe Authorized Claimant will be deemed to have dropped one-half of a day of trips for every day \nin which he or she took Short-Term Military Leave, but no Authorized Claimant shall be deemed \nto have dropped trips for more than 7 days of Short-Term Military Leave in that month,4 and no \n                                                           \n3 For example, if an Authorized Claimant already received $24,000 of matching retirement \ncontributions from Southwest in 2013, and in 2013 the Authorized Claimant had an aggregate of \n$1,500 of matching make-up contributions per period of Short-Term Military Leave, then the \nAuthorized Claimant’s potential matching retirement contributions for 2013 would be $1,000 (the \n$25,000 maximum annual matching contribution minus the $24,000 retirement contribution the \npilot already received that year), rather than $1,500.     \n4 Thus, if an Authorized Claimant claimed to have taken ten 10 days of Short-Term Military Leave \nin a specific month between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, the Authorized Claimant \nshall be deemed to have dropped trips on 5 days in that month.  But if an Authorized Claimant \nclaimed to have taken 20 days of Short-Term Military Leave in a specific month between January \n3 \n \n\nAuthorized Claimant shall be deemed to have dropped more than 21 days of Short-Term Military \nLeave in a single year between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007 (“monthly dropped trip \ndays from 2001 to 2007”).  Dropped days of Short-Term Military Leave in excess of twenty-one \n(21) days will be eliminated from the earliest months in a year.5   \n(2) For any month between January 1, 2001 and October 31, 2004, the Authorized \nClaimant’s monthly dropped trip days from 2001 to 2007 shall be reduced by two-thirds to \nreflect Southwest’s defense that USERRA claims that accrued on or after October 10, 2004 are \nnot timely in this action (“monthly dropped trip days from 2001 to 2007 with SOL discount”). \n(3) For each month between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, multiply the \nmonthly dropped trip days from 2001 to 2007 with SOL discount by 7.1 TFP, then multiply the \nresulting figure by the average base wage rate of the pilot in the same year, and then multiply the \nresulting figure by the maximum percentage of a pilot’s pensionable pay that Southwest would \nmatch under the CBA during the same year (7.3%).   \n(4) Sum the monthly amounts of matching retirement contributions calculated in (2).  \n                                                           \n1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, the Authorized Claimant would only be deemed to have dropped \ntrips on 7 days in that month. \n5 For example, if an Authorized Claimant reports that he took 14 days of Short-Term Military \nLeave in June 2004, 14 days of Short-Term Military Leave in November 2004, 14 days of Short-\nTerm Military Leave in September 2004, and 14 days of Short-Term Military Leave in \nDecember 2004, the Authorized Claimant will hit the annual cap of dropped days of Short-Term \nMilitary Leave and will receive credit for 21 days of dropped trip days of Short-Term Military \nLeave in 2004 (this is because 56 days of Short-Term Military Leave converts in to 28 days of \ndropped days of Short-Term Military Leave for the year).  Accordingly, the Authorized \nClaimant’s 21 days of dropped trip days of Short-Term Military Leave in 2004 will be allocated \namong the later months that he took Short-Term Military Leave (7 dropped trip days in \nSeptember 2004, 7 dropped trip days in November 2004, and 7 dropped trip days in December \n2004).  And the dropped trip days from June 2004 would not be counted towards the Authorized \nClaimant’s 21 dropped trip days that year.    \n4 \n \n\n3.  Allocation and Distribution of USERRA Make-Up Contributions \nEach Authorized Claimant shall receive a pro rata share of the Net Settlement Fund less \nthe Former Employee Sick Leave Settlement Shares based on each Authorized Claimant’s total \nRecognized Claims as compared to the total Recognized Claims for all Authorized Claimants.  \nEach Authorized Claimant’s pro rata share of the Net Settlement Fund less the Former Employee \nSick Leave Settlement Shares shall constitute the payment—other than the accrued sick leave \nbenefits and Former Employee Sick Leave Settlement Shares—that the Authorized Claimant \nshall receive under the Settlement Agreement.  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the \nAuthorized Claimant shall receive some or all of the payment—other than the Former Employee \nSick Leave Settlement Shares—as an employer contribution to the Authorized Claimant’s 401(k) \naccount subject to the Internal Revenue Service’s guidance in response to Southwest’s \napplication for correction under the Employee Plan Compliance Resolution System, as set forth \nin Revenue Procedure 2016-51, or later guidance.  Whatever amount of the Authorized \nClaimant’s payment is not permitted to be contributed to the Authorized Claimant’s 401(k) \naccount on a tax-deferred basis shall be paid directly to the Authorized Claimant, subject to tax \nreporting and withholdings, including the withholding of any employee and employer payroll \ntaxes, which shall be paid out of the Settlement Fund.  The distributions of these payments—\nother than Former Employee Sick Leave Settlement Shares—into the Authorized Claimant’s \n401(k) accounts and/or directly to the Authorized Claimant shall be made by deadlines \nestablished by the Settlement Agreement or modified by the Court. \n4.  Remaining Funds After the Distribution \nIf any funds remain in the Net Settlement Fund by reason of uncashed checks or \notherwise after 180 days after checks have been mailed to Authorized Claimants, the remaining \n5 \n \n\nfunds shall be distributed to non-sectarian, non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization \nrecommended by Class Counsel and approved by the Court. \n \n6 \n \n\n \n \n \n \nExhibit B\n\nSouthwest Airlines Pilots USERRA Sick Leave and 401(k) Retirement Account Litigation \nNOTICE OF PROPOSED CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT \n \nHuntsman v. Southwest Airlines Co., No. 4:17-cv-03972-JD (N.D. Cal.) \n \nA Federal Court authorized this Notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer. \n \nIf you were a Southwest Airlines pilot who took short-term \nmilitary leave on or after January 1, 2001, you could get money \nor additional benefits from this class action settlement. \n•  A Southwest Airlines pilot (the “Plaintiff”) has sued Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”) alleging that Southwest \nviolated USERRA by failing to (i) provide its pilots matching contributions to their 401(k) accounts for their deemed \nearnings during periods of Short-Term Military Leave for elective deferrals made to the 401(k) Plan, (ii) provide timely \ninformation to pilots on their deemed earnings from Short-Term Military Leave so that they can make make-up \nretirement  contributions  into  their  401(k)  accounts,  and  (iii)  provide  matching  contributions  to  pilots’  make-up \ncontributions to their 401(k) accounts from periods of Short-Term Military Leave.  Plaintiff also alleged that Southwest \nviolated USERRA by failing to provide for the accrual of sick leave when pilots take Short-Term Military Leave, because \nSouthwest provides for the accrual of sick leave when pilots engage in jury duty, union leave, and bereavement leave.   \n \n•  The Court has determined that the lawsuit can proceed as a class action on behalf of a group of all former or current \nSouthwest pilots who took Short-Term Military Leave from Southwest between January 1, 2001 and [the Preliminary \nApproval Date].   \n \n•  Under the Settlement, if you are a current or former Southwest pilot you may be eligible to receive an additional employer \ncontribution to your 401(k) Plan account if you took Short-Term Military Leave from Southwest from January 1, 2001 to \nDecember 31, 2013.  You may also be eligible to have accrued sick leave added to your sick leave balance or receive a cash \npayment if you took Short-Term Military Leave from Southwest from January 1, 2001 to [the Preliminary Approval \nDate]. To the extent feasible, any retirement-related payments under this Settlement will be made as an additional \nemployer contribution to your 401(k) Plan account in a tax-deferred manner.   \n \n•  If, 30 days after the Settlement becomes final and non-appealable (“Effective Date”), you are a current Southwest \nemployee who is eligible to recover under the Settlement, all accrued sick leave that you are entitled to receive will be \nadded to your sick leave balance.  If, 30 days after the Effective Date of the Settlement, you are a former Southwest \nemployee who is eligible to recover under the Settlement, you will receive a one-time payment of $1,000, unless you  are a \nretired pilot and have exchanged your accrued sick leave for continued health care coverage and are still receiving \ncontinued health care coverage, in which case you will receive all accrued sick leave that you are entitled to receive under \nthe Settlement for use toward continued health coverage. \n \n•  You have received this Notice because Southwest has identified you as either as a Class Member or a potential Class \nMember.  To determine whether you need to submit additional information before it is possible to determine whether you \nqualify  as  a  Class  Member,  please  visit  www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com  and  enter  your  unique  code, \n<XXXX>, and your password, <XXXX>. \n \n•  The Court has preliminarily approved the Settlement.  For the Settlement to become final and any payments or benefits to \nbe distributed, the Court will need to issue final approval after a final approval hearing, which is currently scheduled for \nXXXX,  XX,  2019.

Why did I receive this Notice? \nAll current or former Southwest pilots who took Short-Term Military Leave (i.e., one or more military leaves each totaling 14 days or \nless) from Southwest from January 1, 2001 to the [the Preliminary Approval Date] are Class Members in this case.  You received this \nNotice because the Court has ordered that it be sent to the persons whom Defendant Southwest Airlines identified as Class Members \nor potential Class Members. Southwest’s records show that you either (i) took Short-Term Military Leave from Southwest sometime \nbetween January 1, 2008 and [the Preliminary Approval Date], which means that you are a Class Member, or (ii) were a pilot with \nmilitary status who was employed by Southwest between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, which means that you may be a \nClass  Member.    If  you  do  not  know  whether  you  are  a  Class  Member  or  a  potential  Class  Member,  please  visit \nwww.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com and enter your unique code, <XXXX>, and your password, <XXXX>.  This case is \npending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and is called Huntsman v. Southwest Airlines Co., \nNo. 4:17-cv-03972-JD (N.D. Cal.). \nThis Notice informs you of a proposed settlement (referred to as “Settlement” or “Settlement Agreement”) of this class action \nconsisting of $5,800,000 in cash that will be used to make additional 401(k) retirement contributions to Class Members (“the \nSettlement Fund”), among other payments, and the recovery of accrued sick leave for eligible Class Members who took Short-Term \nMilitary Leave from January 1, 2001 to [the Preliminary Approval Date].  This Notice describes your rights and options in connection \nwith the Settlement. \n \n2.  What is this lawsuit about? \n \nThe lawsuit is a class action brought under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act (“USERRA”). The USERRA \nlaw provides servicemembers and veterans with a range of rights and benefits, including protections for reservists who take military \nleave from civilian employers like Southwest.    \nThe Class Representative who brought the lawsuit is a Southwest pilot who has participated in the Southwest Airlines Pilots 401(k) \nPlan (“401(k) Plan”).  The Defendant is Southwest Airlines. \nThe lawsuit claims that Southwest violated USERRA by failing to (i) provide its pilots matching contributions to their 401(k) accounts \nfor the deemed earnings during periods of Short-Term Military Leave for elective deferrals made to the 401(k) Plan, (ii) provide \ntimely information to pilots on their deemed earnings from Short-Term Military Leave so that they can make make-up retirement \ncontributions into their 401(k) accounts, and (iii) provide matching contributions to pilots’ make-up contributions to their 401(k) \naccounts from periods of Short-Term Military Leave.  The lawsuit also claims that Southwest violated USERRA by failing to provide \nfor the accrual of sick leave when pilots take Short-Term Military Leave, because Southwest provides for the accrual of sick leave \nwhen pilots engage in jury duty, union leave, and bereavement leave.  Southwest has denied the claims in this lawsuit. \n \nAdditional information about the claims and a copy of the Complaint are available at www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com. \n \n3.  What has happened so far in the lawsuit? \n \nPlaintiff filed the Complaint on July 14, 2017. On September 15, 2017, Plaintiff and Southwest stipulated to stay the litigation to allow \nthem to explore settlement of the lawsuit. The Court granted the stipulation to stay the case on September 21, 2017. The stay was \ncontinued numerous times, with the Court most recently staying this matter until September 5, 2018. \n \nDuring the stay of the lawsuit, Plaintiff and Southwest engaged in substantial informal discovery (a process through which the parties \nexchange information without directly involving the court) on issues related to liability, damages, and class certification.  Plaintiff and \nhis counsel obtained from Southwest information and documents about Southwest’s policies and practices, as well as personnel data \nabout the Class Members so that the Class Members’ potential damages and relief could be estimated.  Numerous conversations took \nplace between the parties and their counsel, including in-person meetings and mediations between the parties’ counsel.  After a two-\nday mediation on June 26 and June 27, 2018, supervised by an experienced mediator who is a former state Supreme Court judge, the \nparties reached an Agreement in Principle to resolve the lawsuit. \n \nOn XXXXXXX, 2018, the Court certified a Class as to all claims and appointed Plaintiff’s counsel as Class Counsel and Plaintiff as \nthe Class Representative.  The Court has not ruled on the merits of any claims or defenses. \n \nOn XXXXXXX, 2018, the Court preliminarily approved the Settlement and has scheduled a final hearing to evaluate the fairness and \nadequacy of the Settlement. \n  QUESTIONS? CALL XX OR VISIT www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com   PAGE 4 OF 10 \n \n\nTHE CLASS \n \n4.  What is a Class Action? \n \nA class action is a lawsuit in which the claims and rights of many people are decided in a single court proceeding. In a class action, \none or more people, called Plaintiffs, file suit on behalf of others with similar claims, called the Class or Class Members. If a class is \ncertified, the Court appoints a person, called the Class Representative, to represent and act on behalf of the class. Here the Class \nRepresentative is Jayson Huntsman. \n \n5.  Who is included in the Class? \n   \n \nThe Class is defined as all former or current pilots employed by Southwest who took Short-Term Military Leave from Southwest \nbetween January 1, 2001 and [the Preliminary Approval Date].  The class period for the 401(k) Plan claims is January 1, 2001 to \nDecember 31, 2013.  The class period for sick leave claims is January 1, 2001 to [the Preliminary Approval Date].  Southwest has only \nidentified pilots who fall within the Class definition who were employed by Southwest from January 1, 2008 to the present.  If you fall \nwithin this definition but your employment with Southwest terminated between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2007, you must file a \nclaim form to identify yourself and receive your share of the Settlement. If you do not know whether you have been identified as a Class \nMember,  please  visit  www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com  and  enter  your  unique  code,  <XXXX>,  and  your  password, \n<XXXX>.  \n \nIf you are included in the above definition, you will be included in the Class unless you exclude yourself.  If you are unsure about \nwhether you are a Class Member, you can contact the lawyers representing the Class by telephone at 212-245-1000 or e-mail at \nSWASettlement@outtengolden.com.  The lawyers’ contact information is listed in the response to Question 22. \n \nTHE SETTLEMENT \n \n6.  What does the Settlement provide? \n \nThe Settlement provides equitable and monetary relief to Class Members who were allegedly denied sick leave and matching \nretirement contributions for periods of Short-Term Military Leave in the past. In addition, in the future Southwest will agree to \nprovide accrued sick leave for periods in which pilots take Short-Term Military Leave. \nThe Settlement Agreement provides the following equitable and monetary relief:   \n•  Sick Leave Benefits.  If you are a current Southwest pilot who is a Class Member, the Settlement provides you with additional \nsick leave for periods in which you took Short-Term Military Leave but did not receive accrued sick leave from January 1, 2001 \nto [the Preliminary Approval Date].  For periods of Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2008 to [the Preliminary \nApproval Date] you will automatically receive an additional 0.71 Trips for Pay (“TFP”) of sick leave in your sick leave balance \nfor every day of work you dropped to take Short-Term Military Leave.  Also, if you file a Claim Form identifying yourself as \nhaving taken Short-Term Military Leave in any year from 2001 to 2007, you will receive an additional 8.5 TFP of sick leave for \nthe year in which the Short-Term Military Leave was taken.  The additional sick leave that you receive cannot increase your \nsick leave balance beyond the maximum sick leave balance of 1,600 TFP (the 1,600 figure is set by the Collective Bargaining \nAgreement between Southwest and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association).  If, 30 days after the Effective Date of the \nSettlement, you are a former Southwest employee who is eligible to recover under the Settlement, you will receive a one-time \npayment of $1,000, unless you are a retired pilot and have exchanged your accrued sick leave for continued health care coverage \nand are still receiving continued health care coverage, in which case you will receive all accrued sick leave that you are entitled \nto receive under the Settlement for use toward continued health coverage.  Any $1,000 cash payments associated with sick leave \nclaims will be made from the $5,800,000 Settlement Fund described in the next paragraph.   \n•  Retirement Contributions and Payments.  The proposed Settlement provides a common fund of $5,800,000 that will be used \n(1) to make supplemental retirement contributions to Class Members’ Southwest 401(k) Plan account to the greatest extent \npermitted under the law or, if it is not possible to make retirement contributions directly into Class Members’ 401(k) Plan \naccount, to make a cash payment for Class Members’ USERRA retirement-related claims; (2) pay attorneys’ fees and costs; (3) \npay a service award to the Class Representative; (4) pay for notice and settlement administration costs and related tax expenses; \nand (5) provide payments to Class Members who are former employees (as described in the prior paragraph).  After the payment \nof any attorneys’ fees and costs, a service award, notice and administration costs, taxes, and payments to Class Members who \nare former employees, the remaining Settlement Fund will be distributed under a proposed distribution methodology called the \nPlan of Allocation described below (unless the Court modifies the Plan of Allocation). \nThe Settlement provides for the following future policy changes and benefits:   \n•  Accrual of Sick Leave in the Future.  Under the proposed Settlement, Southwest has agreed to change its policy in the future \nto provide accrued sick leave for pilots who take Short-Term Military Leave.   \n•  Information on Deemed Earnings for Retirement Contributions.  Under the proposed Settlement, Southwest has agreed to \nregularly provide pilots with information about their deemed earnings related to their military leave, and Southwest will provide \n  QUESTIONS? CALL XX OR VISIT www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com   PAGE 5 OF 10 \n \n\nmore detailed information about the calculation of deemed earnings related to military leave upon request by pilots.  This \ninformation will help pilots to better and fully understand the retirement contributions that they receive from Southwest for \nperiods of military leave, as required by USERRA.   \nThe Court has not ruled on liability or relief. This Notice is not an expression of opinion by the Court as to the merits of any claim or \ndefense. This Notice does not imply that there has been any violation of law or that the Class will recover if the lawsuit is not settled \nand instead is resolved in Court by trial or otherwise. \n \n7.  What do I give up as a result of the Settlement? \n \nIf you are a Class Member, unless you exclude yourself from the Class, you (including your heirs, beneficiaries, executors, \nadministrators, estates, agents, attorneys, predecessors, successors, and assigns) will release and fully and finally settle, relinquish, \nwaive and discharge, any and all claims, actions, demands, damages, rights, obligations, expenses, costs, causes of action, or \nliabilities, known or unknown, against Southwest, the 401(k) Plan administrator, the 401(k) Plan sponsor, the 401(k) Plan, 401(k) Plan \nfiduciaries, and their parents, subsidiaries, agents, employees, and other affiliated persons or entities that (1) arise from or relate to the \naccrual of sick leave during periods of Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through the date of Preliminary Approval, or  \n(2) arise from or relate to employee or employer contributions to your 401(k) account arising from or related to periods of Short-Term \nMilitary Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2013, including those related to the failure to provide you with \ninformation regarding your 401(k) account, Short-Term Military Leave, or deemed earnings to facilitate additional contributions to \nyour 401(k) account based on Short-Term Military Leave.    \n \n8.  Why is there a Settlement? \n \nIn deciding to settle the lawsuit, the Class Representative and Class Counsel considered, among other things (a) the factual record; (b) \nthe potential monetary recovery and potential to change Southwest’s policies through litigation; (c) the strength of the Class’ claims \nbased on a review of the law and the facts established in discovery and through investigation; (d) the expense and length of continued \nproceedings, including possible trial and post-trial proceedings and appeals, necessary to prosecute the lawsuit; (e) the risks arising \nfrom the existence of unresolved questions of law and fact; (f) the nature and strength of defenses asserted by and available to \nSouthwest; and (g) the risks and uncertainties of continued USERRA class action litigation of this nature. After a thorough review and \ninvestigation, the Class Representative and Class Counsel believe that in light of the foregoing considerations, the proposed \nSettlement is fair, reasonable and adequate and in the best interests of the Class. \n \n9.  What additional accrued sick leave will I receive under the settlement? \n \nIf you are a current Southwest pilot who is a Class Member, under the proposed Settlement, for every day that you dropped a trip to \ntake Short-Term Military Leave between January 1, 2008 and the Preliminary Approval Date, Southwest will add to your sick leave \nbalance 0.71 TFP of sick leave.  This figure assumes that you would have worked approximately 7.1 TFPs each day that you dropped \na trip to take Short-Term Military Leave, and applies the standard rate for accruing sick leave under the SWAPA CBA (1 TFP of \naccrued sick leave for every 10 TFP earned).   \nIn addition, if you elect to submit a Claim Form to the Settlement Administrator stating each year that you dropped a trip to take \nShort-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2007, Southwest will add to your sick leave balance 8.5 TFPs \nof sick leave per year that you attest that you dropped a trip to take Short-Term Military Leave.  (This 8.5 TFP figure is 77% of the \naverage annual amount of accrued sick leave that Class Members would have received from 2008 to 2013 had they been permitted by \nSouthwest to accrue sick leave during Short-Term Military Leave.)  You do not have to submit a Claim Form, but you will not be \neligible for additional sick leave benefits for any trips dropped from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2007 if you do not submit \na Claim Form.  The additional accrued sick leave that you receive cannot increase your sick leave balance beyond the maximum \nbalance of 1,600 TFP (a figure set by the SWAPA CBA).The amount of additional accrued sick leave that you will receive under the \nSettlement does not depend on how much accrued sick leave other Class Members took from January 1, 2001 to the Preliminary \nApproval Date.  \nIf, 30 days after the Effective Date of the Settlement, you are a former Southwest employee who is eligible to recover under the \nSettlement, you will receive a one-time payment of $1,000, unless you are a retired pilot and have exchanged your accrued sick leave \nfor continued health care coverage and are still receiving continued health care coverage, in which case you will receive all accrued \nsick leave that you are entitled to receive under the Settlement for use toward continued health coverage.   \n \n9.  What additional retirement contributions or cash payments will I receive under the settlement? \n \nIf you are a Class Member, under the proposed Settlement, for your claims related to retirement contributions under USERRA, you \nwill receive a share of the $5.8 million Settlement Fund after certain expenses are paid for attorneys’ fees and costs, a service award \nfor the Class Representative, the costs of settlement administration, any applicable taxes, and the payments to former Southwest pilots \nfor sick leave claims.  \nYour share of the Settlement Fund will be based upon Southwest’s personnel data from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2013, any \ninformation that you choose to provide if you submit a Claim Form about the Short-Term Military Leave you took from January 1, \n2001 to December 31, 2007, and a Plan of Allocation proposed by the parties and approved by the Court.  A copy of the Plan of \n  QUESTIONS? CALL XX OR VISIT www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com   PAGE 6 OF 10 \n \n\nAllocation can be found at www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com.  Under the proposed Plan of Allocation, Class Members \nwill receive a pro rata share of the Settlement Funds based on their Recognized Claim, as defined below.   \nUnder the proposed Plan of Allocation, for the 2008 to 2013 period, a Recognized Claim is based on: (1) the number of days each \nClass Member dropped trips to take military leave, times (2) 7.1 TFP per day, times (3) Class Members’ average base rate of pay in \nthe relevant year. For each year during the 2008 to 2013 period, Class Members’ additional retirement contribution will be limited if \nthis formula would result in a retirement contribution that causes them to receive more than the annual maximum of $25,000 of \nemployer contributions for the relevant year.    \nFor each year during the 2001 and 2007 period, a Recognized Claim is based on: (1) one-half of the number of days of Short-Term \nMilitary Leave each Class Member took in the year (but this resulting figure shall not exceed 21 days annually or 7 days in a month), \ntimes (2) 7.1 TFP, times (3) Class Members’ average base rate of pay in the relevant year.  For Short-Term Military Leave that \noccurred prior to October 2004, the Recognized Claim will be reduced by two-thirds to reflect Southwest’s affirmative defense that \nsuch claims are untimely.   \nThe parties intend to take reasonable steps to have the distribution of retirement-related shares of the Settlement Fund be paid directly \ninto Class Members’ individual 401(k) Plan accounts in a tax-deferred manner (just like other previous 401(k) Plan contributions \nmade by Southwest).  However, if it is not possible to deposit some or all of a Class Member’s retirement-related share of the \nSettlement Fund into his or her 401(k) Plan account, the Class Member will receive a cash payment, from which payroll taxes and \nother applicable taxes will be deducted.   \n \n10.  When would I receive my additional sick leave under the Settlement? \n \nClass Members’ receipt of additional sick leave (or payment) is conditioned on the Court’s approval of the Settlement and such \napproval becoming final and no longer subject to any appeals.  If additional sick leave is being deposited in your account, within 30 \ndays of the Effective Date of the Settlement (i.e., 60 days after the Court grants final approval if there is no appeal), Southwest will \nadd to your sick leave balance the amount of accrued sick leave TFP that you are entitled to receive under the Settlement.    \n \n11.  When would I receive my additional retirement contributions or payments related to retirement claims? \n \nClass Members’ receipt of any retirement contributions or retirement-related payments is conditioned on the Court’s approval of the \nSettlement and such approval becoming Final and no longer subject to any appeals.  If there is no appeal, the Settlement will become \neffective 30 days after the Court enters Final Judgment. Once the Settlement becomes final, it is expected that a distribution to your \n401(k) Plan account will occur as soon as possible.  However, because Southwest will need to seek and receive guidance from the \nInternal Revenue Service on whether and what amount of any retirement-related share of the Settlement Fund can be deposited into a \n401(k) account and what amount must be paid in cash, and because the Settlement involves 401(k) Plan accounts for a large number of \npersons, processing all of those distributions may take one or more years.  Your patience is appreciated.  Updates will be provided at \nthe following web site: www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com.  \n \n12. Will I have to pay taxes on the additional employer retirement contributions that I receive? \n \nIf you are a Class Member and you do nothing, under the Plan of Allocation proposed by Class Counsel and preliminarily approved by \nthe Court, you will receive a pro rata distribution of the Settlement Fund. The parties intend to take reasonable steps to have the \ndistribution made directly into your individual 401(k) Plan accounts in a tax-deferred manner (just like other previous 401(k) Plan \ncontributions made by Southwest). You should, however, consult your own tax advisor about the tax implications of any money or \nemployer contributions that you receive as part of the Settlement. \n \nEXCLUSION & OBJECTIONS \n \n13. If I want to get out of the Settlement, what should I do? \n \nIf you are a Class Member and you wish to exclude yourself from the Settlement, you must send a letter to the Settlement Administrator \nthat includes the following:  \n \n•  Your name, address, and telephone number;  \n•  A statement that you want to be excluded from Huntsman v. Southwest Airlines Co., No. 4:17-cv-03972-JD (N.D. Cal.); and \n•  Your signature. \n \nYou must mail your exclusion request, postmarked no later than XX, 2019, to: \n \nSettlement Administrator Address \n \n \n \n \n  QUESTIONS? CALL XX OR VISIT www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com   PAGE 7 OF 10 \n \n\n \n14.  If I do not exclude myself, can I sue Defendant for the same thing later? \n \nNo. Under the release in the Settlement Agreement, if you are a Class Member and you do not opt of the Settlement, you (including \nyour heirs, beneficiaries, executors, administrators, estates, agents, attorneys, predecessors, successors, and assigns) will release and \nfully and finally settle, relinquish, waive and discharge, any and all claims, actions, demands, damages, rights, obligations, expenses, \ncosts, causes of action, or liabilities, known or unknown, against Southwest, the 401(k) Plan administrator, the 401(k) Plan sponsor, \nthe 401(k) Plan, 401(k) Plan fiduciaries, and their parents, subsidiaries, agents, employees, and other affiliated persons or entities that \n(1) arise from or relate to the accrual of sick leave during periods of Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through the date \nof Preliminary Approval, or (2) arise from or relate to employee or employer contributions to your 401(k) account arising from or \nrelated to periods of Short-Term Military Leave from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2013, including those related to the \nfailure to provide you with information regarding your 401(k) account, Short-Term Military Leave, or deemed earnings to facilitate \nadditional contributions to your 401(k) account based on Short-Term Military Leave.  If you have a pending lawsuit, speak to your \nlawyer in that lawsuit immediately. \n \n15. If I exclude myself, can I still get benefits from the Settlement? \n   \n \nNo. If you are a Class Member and you exclude yourself from the Settlement, you will not receive any additional sick leave or any \nmonetary payment from the Settlement Fund. \n \n16. How do I tell the Court what I think about the Settlement? \n \nAny Class Member may object to any aspect of the Settlement or attorneys’ fees or expenses by filing a written objection with the \nCourt. To object, you must send a letter or other written statement to the Court saying that you object to the Settlement, the Plan of \nAllocation and/or the attorneys’ fee award. Include your name, address, telephone number, signature, the title of the case, Huntsman v. \nSouthwest Airlines Co., No. 4:17-cv-03972-JD (N.D. Cal.), and an explanation of all reasons you object to the Settlement. Please be \nadvised that failure to include these details may result in the Court refusing to consider your objection. \n \nYour written objection must be filed or postmarked no later than XX, 2019, and either (1) mailed to the Class Action Clerk, Phillip \nBurton Federal Building & United States Courthouse, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, CA, 94102, or (2) filed in person at any \nlocation of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. \n \nYour objection should state the supporting bases and reasons for the objection, identify any and all witnesses, documents or other \nevidence you would like to present at the Final Approval Hearing, and describe the substance of any testimony provided by you or \nother witnesses. \n \nIF YOU DO NOT OBJECT IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE, THE COURT MAY CONCLUDE THAT \nYOU HAVE WAIVED ANY OBJECTION AND MAY NOT PERMIT YOU TO SPEAK AT THE FAIRNESS HEARING. \n \n17. What’s the difference between objecting and asking to be excluded? \n \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like or disagree with an aspect of the Settlement.  You can object to the \nSettlement only if you are a Class Member and you do not exclude yourself from the Settlement.  Excluding yourself from the \nSettlement is telling the Court that you do not want to be part of the Settlement. If you exclude yourself from the Settlement, you \ncannot object to the Settlement because you will not be bound by the Settlement. \n \nTHE FINAL APPROVAL HEARING \n \n18.  When and where will the Court hold the hearing? \n \nThe Final Approval Hearing (also called the Fairness Hearing) will take place before the Honorable James Donato in Courtroom 11 of \nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of California, located at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 19th Floor, San Francisco, \nCalifornia 94102, at 10 am, on XXXXXX, 2019. The hearing may be moved to a different date or time without additional notice, so it \nis a good idea to check www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com for updates. At the hearing, the Court will consider whether the \nSettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate, how much to pay Class Counsel in fees, what to reimburse Class Counsel for their \nexpenses, and whether to provide Plaintiff with a service award because of his time and expense to bring this lawsuit. If there are \nobjections or comments, the Court will consider them at the hearing. After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the \nSettlement and enter Final Judgment. We do not know how long these decisions will take. Please be patient. \n \n19.  Do I have to come to the Final Approval Hearing? \n \nYour attendance is not required, even if you submit a written response. Class Counsel will answer questions the Court may have at the \nFinal Approval Hearing, including any questions about objections.  If you or your personal attorney wants to attend the hearing, you \n  QUESTIONS? CALL XX OR VISIT www.southwestpilotsUSERRAsettlement.com   PAGE 8 OF 10 \n \n\nmay attend at your own expense. As long as any objection or comment you filed was postmarked by the deadline, the Court will \nconsider it even if you do not attend the Final Approval Hearing. \n \n20.  May I speak at the Final Approval Hearing? \n \nYes.  You may speak at the Final Approval Hearing, so long as you are a member of the Class and have properly and timely \nsubmitted a written response as set forth above and have stated in your response your intention to appear at the Final Approval \nHearing. \n \n21.  What happens if I do nothing at all? \n \n \nIf you do nothing and you are entitled to receive benefits from the Settlement, you will receive those benefits as described above if the \nSettlement is approved. \n \nTHE LAWYERS REPRESENTING YOU \n \n22.  Do I have a lawyer in this case? \n \nYes.  The Court has appointed the following law firms to serve as the attorneys for the Class: \n \nLead Class Counsel  Additional Class Counsel \nOUTTEN & GOLDEN LLP  CROTTY & SON LAW FIRM, PLLC \nPeter Romer-Friedman   Matthew Z.

You have the right to hire your own attorney (at your own \nexpense), but if you are a member of and remain in the Class, you are not required to hire a separate attorney. \n \n23.  How will the lawyers for the Class be paid? \n \nClass Counsel undertook this matter more than a year and a half ago—following an investigation of several years—on a wholly \ncontingent basis. Subject to approval of the Court, Class Counsel is permitted to seek an award of attorneys’ fees to be paid from the \nSettlement Fund, and reimbursement of expenses incurred during the litigation.  These attorneys’ fees pay for work the attorneys have \nperformed on behalf of the Class and for work yet to be done in helping to administer the Settlement. Before the Final Approval \nHearing, Class Counsel will seek the Court’s approval of an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount not to exceed $1.74 million of the \n$5.8 million Settlement Fund plus reimbursement for lawsuit costs and expenses.  The maximum amount of attorneys’ fees of $1.74 \nmillion is 30% of the $5.8 million Settlement Fund, but in the view of Plaintiff’s counsel it is a much smaller percentage of the total \nvalue of the Settlement, which includes the $5.8 million Settlement Fund and providing Class Members with sick leave for periods of \nShort-Term Military Leave over an 18-year period. Whether the Settlement is approved or not, you will not be required to directly pay \nany attorneys’ fees or other expenses or costs, which will be paid only from the Settlement Fund in the amount approved by the Court. \n \nTHE SETTLEMENT IS NOT YET FINAL \n \n24.  Can the Settlement be terminated? \n \nIf there is no final Court approval of the proposed Settlement in this case, or if Class Counsel or Defendant withdraws from the \nSettlement in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, or if the Settlement is not consummated for any other reason, \nthe Settlement Agreement will become null and void, and the parties will resume their former positions in the lawsuit. \n \n  QUESTIONS?

AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n  CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD\n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 44   Filed 12/05/18   Page 2 of 10\n \n11 On November 8, 2018, a hearing was held on the motion of Plaintiff Jayson Huntsman \n22 (“Plaintiff”) for an order to: (1) conditionally certify the settlement class; (2) preliminarily \n33 approve the parties’ proposed class action settlement (“Settlement”); (3) appoint Plaintiff as the \n44 Class Representative, his counsel as Class Counsel, and Settlement Services, Inc. as Settlement \n55 Administrator; (4) set the deadlines for filing Claim Forms, written exclusions, or objections to \n66 the Settlement; (5) approve the Claim Form and notice to the class of the Settlement; and \n77 (6) schedule a hearing on the final approval of the Settlement.  Romer-Friedman, Jahan Sagafi, \n88 and Rachel Williams Dempsey appeared for Plaintiff.  Brian Berry appeared for Defendant \n99 Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”).   \n1100 Having considered the papers on the motion, the arguments of counsel, and the law, the \n1111 Court now enters this Preliminary Approval Order and orders as follows: \n1122 I.  NATURE OF ACTION \n1133 Plaintiff alleges that Southwest violated the Uniformed Services Employment and \n1144 Reemployment Rights Act (“USERRA”), 38 U.S.C. §§ 4316, 4318, by failing to: (i) make the \n1155 proper matching contributions to pilots’ retirement accounts based on Deemed Earnings during \n1166 periods of Short-Term Military Leave from their employment at Southwest; (ii) facilitate pilots’ \n1177 opportunity to make retirement contributions that could be matched during periods of Short-Term \n1188 Military Leave; and (iii) provide for the accrual of Sick Leave during pilots’ periods of Short-\n1199 Term Military Leave.  Short-Term Military Leave is defined as leave lasting 14 or fewer \n2200 consecutive days.  Deemed Earnings are the amount of earnings that Southwest pilots would have \n2211 earned if they had not taken Short-Term Military Leave. \n2222 Southwest disputes and denies all of Plaintiff’s claims.  Southwest contends that it has \n2233 fully complied with all applicable laws at issue in this matter. \n2244 II.  CONDITIONAL CERTIFICATION OF RULE 23 SETTLEMENT CLASS \n2255 A.  Rule 23 Settlement Class \n2266 For settlement purposes only, the Parties have proposed conditional certification of a \n2277 Settlement Class of all former or current pilots employed by Southwest who took Short-Term \n2288 Military Leave from Southwest between January 1, 2001 and the Preliminary Approval Date.   \n  2\n  [PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING CONDITIONAL CERT. AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n  CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD\n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 44   Filed 12/05/18   Page 3 of 10\n \n11 B.  Conditional Rule 23 Certification \n22 The Court hereby finds and concludes that for purposes of the Settlement only, the \n33 Settlement Class satisfies all of the requirements for certification under Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) of \n44 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n55 1.  The Settlement Class is sufficiently numerous that joinder is impracticable, \n66 as the Settlement Class has at least 1,500 members. \n77 2.  The members of the Settlement Class share common issues of fact and law \n88 regarding whether Southwest had uniform practices of denying pilots accrued sick leave for \n99 Short-Term Military Leave, failing to match retirement contributions based on their deemed \n1100 earnings, and denying pilots information on deemed earnings, and whether these practices violate \n1111 USERRA.   \n1122 3.  The Class Representative’s claims are typical of those of the Class he \n1133 proposes to represent, because they arise out of the same policies and practices and course of \n1144 conduct that all Class Members challenge in this action. \n1155 4.  The Class Representative is an adequate representative of the Class he \n1166 proposes to represent, because his interests are co-extensive with those of the Class Members, and \n1177 he has retained experienced counsel to represent himself and the Class Members. \n1188 5.  Questions of law or fact common to the Class predominate over \n1199 individualized issues, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \n2200 efficient adjudication of this controversy. \n2211 6.  Because certification of the Class is proposed in the context of a settlement, \n2222 the Court need not inquire whether the case, if tried as a class action, would present intractable \n2233 management problems. \n2244 Accordingly, the Court hereby certifies the Settlement Class under Rule 23(a) and (b)(3).   \n2255 III.  APPOINTMENT OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVE AND CLASS COUNSEL \n2266 A.  Class Representatives \n2277 The Court finds and concludes that the Plaintiff Jayson Huntsman has claims that are \n2288 typical of the members of the Class he proposes to represent, and he is an adequate representative \n  3\n  [PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING CONDITIONAL CERT. AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n  CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD\n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 44   Filed 12/05/18   Page 4 of 10\n \n11 of the Class he seeks to represent.  The Court hereby appoints Plaintiff Jayson Huntsman to serve \n22 as Class Representative. \n33 B.  Class Counsel \n44 The Court finds and concludes that Outten & Golden LLP, the Law Office of Thomas \n55 Jarrard, PLLC, and the Crotty & Son Law Firm, PLLC, have extensive experience and expertise \n66 in prosecuting USERRA class actions and other types of class actions.  The Court appoints \n77 Outten & Golden LLP, the Law Office of Thomas Jarrard, PLLC, and the Crotty & Son Law \n88 Firm, PLLC, as Class Counsel, and the Court appoints Outten & Golden LLP as Lead Class \n99 Counsel.   \n1100 IV.  PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT \n1111 The Court has reviewed the terms of the Settlement, including the Plan of Allocation and \n1122 the release of claims.  The Court has also read and considered the declarations of Peter Romer-\n1133 Friedman, Thomas Jarrard, and Matthew Crotty in support of the Preliminary Approval Motion.  \n1144 Based on review of those papers and the Court’s familiarity with this case, the Court finds and \n1155 concludes that the Settlement is the result of arm’s-length negotiations between the Parties \n1166 conducted after Class Counsel had adequately investigated Plaintiff’s claims and become familiar \n1177 with their strengths and weaknesses.  The assistance of an experienced mediator in the settlement \n1188 process supports the finding that the Settlement is non-collusive.  Based on all of these factors, \n1199 the Court concludes that the proposed Settlement meets the criteria for preliminary settlement \n2200 approval.  The Settlement has no obvious defects and falls within the range of possible approval \n2211 as fair, adequate, and reasonable, such that notice to the Class Members is appropriate.  \n2222 Accordingly, the Settlement is hereby preliminarily approved. \n2233 V.  APPROVAL OF THE NOTICE PLAN \n2244 The Parties have also submitted for this Court’s approval a proposed class notice.  After \n2255 carefully reviewing this document, the Court finds and concludes as follows: \n2266 A.  Best Notice Practicable \n2277 The Class Notice is the best notice practicable under the circumstances and allows Class \n2288 Members a full and fair opportunity to consider the Settlement. \n  4\n  [PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING CONDITIONAL CERT. AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n  CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD\n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 44   Filed 12/05/18   Page 5 of 10\n \n11 The Class Notice, based on the model forms supplied by the Federal Judicial Center, \n22 fairly, plainly, accurately, and reasonably informs Class Members of appropriate information \n33 about: (1) the nature of this action, the definition of the Class, the identity of Class Counsel, and \n44 the essential terms of the Settlement, including the Plan of Allocation; (2) Plaintiff’s forthcoming \n55 application for the Class Representative’s Service Award and Class Counsel’s Attorneys’ Fees \n66 and Costs Award; (3) how Class Members’ settlement shares will be calculated; (4) this Court’s \n77 procedures for final approval of the Settlement, and about Class Members’ right to appear \n88 through counsel if they desire; (5) how to submit a claim form, comment on or opt out of the \n99 Settlement, if a Class Member wishes to do so; and (6) how to obtain additional information \n1100 regarding this action and the Settlement. \n1111 The proposed plan for distributing the Class Notice likewise is a reasonable method \n1122 calculated to reach all individuals who would be bound by the Settlement.  Under this plan, the \n1133 Settlement Administrator will distribute the Class Notice to all Class Members who took Short-\n1144 Term Military Leave between January 1, 2008 and the date of preliminary approval, by first-class \n1155 mail and e-mail to their last known mailing and, if available, e-mail addresses.  In addition, the \n1166 Settlement Administrator will distribute the Class Notice to hundreds of additional potential Class \n1177 Members by first-class mail and e-mail to their last known mailing and, if available, e-mail \n1188 addresses: all pilots who were employed at Southwest between January 1, 2001 and December \n1199 31, 2007 and had a military status during at least part of their employment with Southwest.  In \n2200 addition, information about the Settlement will be published on a web site that the Settlement \n2211 Administrator will establish.  There is no additional method of distribution that is cost-effective \n2222 and would be reasonably likely to notify Class Members who may not receive notice pursuant to \n2233 the proposed distribution plan.   \n2244 B.  CAFA Notice of Proposed Settlement  \n2255 Within ten (10) days after Plaintiff’s Preliminary Approval Motion was filed, notice of the \n2266 Settlement was mailed to the Attorney General of the United States of America and the \n2277 appropriate state official in California and all the other states in which a Class Member is known \n2288 by Southwest to reside. The notice contains the documents required by 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b)(1)-\n  5\n  [PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING CONDITIONAL CERT. AND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n  CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD\n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 44   Filed 12/05/18   Page 6 of 10\n \n11 (8).  On this basis, the notice of the Settlement is approved and the Court finds that Southwest has \n22 discharged its obligations under CAFA to provide notice to the appropriate federal and state \n33 officials. \n44 C.  Approval \n55 Accordingly, the Court finds and concludes that the proposed plan for distributing the \n66 Class Notice will provide the best notice practicable, satisfies the notice requirements of Rule \n77 23(e), and satisfies all other legal and due process requirements.  Accordingly, the Court hereby \n88 orders as follows: \n99 1.  The Class Notice, Claim Form, and Notice Envelope are approved. \n1100 2.  The manner of distributing the Class Notice to the Class Members is approved. \n1111 3.  Promptly following the entry of this order, the Settlement Administrator will \n1122 prepare final versions of the Class Notice, incorporating into them the relevant dates and \n1133 deadlines set forth in this order. \n1144 4.  Within ten (10) business days following entry of this order, Southwest will provide \n1155 the Settlement Administrator with a database in a format reasonably acceptable to the Settlement \n1166 Administrator (“Settlement Class List”), that lists, for each known Class Member who took Short-\n1177 Term Military Leave from January 1, 2008 to the date of preliminary approval and each \n1188 Southwest pilot who had a military status and was employed by Southwest from January 1, 2001 \n1199 to December 31, 2007, to the extent they are reasonably available in Southwest’s databases: (1) a \n2200 street mailing address; (2) telephone number(s); (3) Southwest and personal e-mail address(es), \n2211 including email accounts provided by Southwest; and (4) Social Security number.  Within ten \n2222 (10) business days following the deadline for Class Members to submit Claim Forms, Southwest \n2233 will provide the Settlement Administrator with a database in a format reasonably acceptable to \n2244 the Settlement Administrator that lists, for each known Class Member, (1) the dates of known \n2255 days with dropped trips for Short-Term Military Leave; and (2) the average annual rate of pay for \n2266 each Class Member from 2001 to 2013. \n2277\n2288\n  6\n  [PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING CONDITIONAL CERT.

This is an action brought pursuant to the Uniformed Services Employment and \n26 \nReemployment Rights Act (“USERRA”), 38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq., on behalf of a class of current \n27 \nand former pilots employed by Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”) who did not receive the \n28 \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 1 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 2 of 18\n \n \n \n1   retirement contributions mandated by USERRA for the short term periods in which the Southwest \n2  pilots took leave from Southwest to honorably serve in the Armed Forces. \n3  2.  Since at least 1994, Southwest has been required by § 4318 of USERRA to make \n4  retirement contributions to Southwest pilots for all periods in which they engaged in qualified \n5  military service and were subsequently reemployed by Southwest.   In addition, under USERRA   \n6  § 4316, Southwest has been required to provide accrued paid sick leave to Southwest pilots who \n7  took short term military leave insofar as Southwest provided accrued paid sick leave to similarly \n8  situated pilots who took comparable forms of leave. \n9  3.  Both in the past and the present, Southwest has not made the proper retirement \n10  contributions for pilots who take short term periods of leave from Southwest to serve in the Armed \n11  Forces.  Nor has Southwest provided accrued paid sick leave to pilots who engaged in short term \n12  military leave.  Both of these policies or practices violate USERRA.   \n13  4.  Upon information and belief, prior to and through 2014, Southwest did not provide \n14  pilots with any retirement contributions for the short term periods in which pilots took military \n15  leave (i.e., periods shorter than 30 days), or alternatively made it impossible for pilots to actually \n16  make and receive matching retirement contributions for periods of short term military leave.  For \n17  example, a pilot who was scheduled to fly a specific schedule over a month and dropped \n18  scheduled trips over five working days to serve in the Armed Forces would not be given the \n19  opportunity to receive any retirement contributions for such a short term period of military leave.   \n20  5.  Upon information and belief, since 2014 Southwest has prevented Southwest pilots \n21  from receiving matching retirement contributions for short term periods of military leave that they \n22  are entitled to receive under USERRA by refusing to inform pilots of the amount of contributions \n23  that they can make for specific short term periods of military leave and that will, in turn, be \n24  matched by Southwest, or by delaying the provision of such information to the Southwest pilots.   \n25  6.  In addition, Southwest has violated USERRA § 4316(b) by failing to provide its \n26  pilots who take short term military leave with any accrued paid sick leave while simultaneously \n27  providing pilots who engage in jury duty, union duty, and bereavement leave with accrued paid \n28  sick leave.  Although these forms of leave are comparable, Southwest has never provided its pilots \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 2 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 3 of 18\n \n \n \n1   who take short term military leave with accrued paid sick leave.  \n2  7.  Due to these violations of USERRA, Plaintiff Huntsman and other Southwest pilots \n3  who served in the Armed Forces during their employment at Southwest have received \n4  considerably smaller retirement contributions and amounts of accrued paid sick leave than they \n5  were entitled to receive under USERRA.  Southwest has known about these violations of \n6  USERRA for years and has received complaints from Southwest pilots, but has not taken \n7  sufficient action to rectify the problem.  Not only does this underscore the willful nature of \n8  Southwest’s conduct, but it has forced Plaintiff Huntsman to turn to the federal courts to obtain \n9  justice for all of the Southwest pilots who have been harmed by the practices challenged in this \n10  action. \n11  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12  8.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n13  because this action arises under USERRA, a federal law.  This Court has subject matter \n14  jurisdiction over the USERRA claim pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 4323(b)(3), which provides the \n15  district courts of the United States with jurisdiction over any USERRA action brought against a \n16  private employer.  Southwest is a private employer because it “pays salary or wages for work \n17  performed or that has control over employment opportunities.”   38 U.S.C. § 4303(4)(A).  \n18  9.  Venue is proper in this District under 38 U.S.C. § 4323(c)(2), because Southwest, \n19  “the private employer of the person” who has filed this lawsuit, “maintains a place of business” in \n20  this District at the Oakland International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport, \n21  employing nearly 750 pilots at the Oakland International Airport.  Venue is also proper in this \n22  District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), as a substantial part of the events giving rise to the \n23  claims in this action occurred in this District. \n24  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n25  10.  A substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the claims occurred \n26  in Alameda County and/or adjacent counties in the San Francisco/Oakland Division, and therefore \n27  this action is properly assigned to the San Francisco/Oakland Division pursuant to Local Rule 3- \n28  2(c),(d). \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 3 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 4 of 18\n \n \n \n1    THE PARTIES \n2  11.  Plaintiff Jayson Huntsman is and has been employed as a pilot by Southwest since \n3  February 2012.  Huntsman serves as a First Officer flying 737 passenger airplanes for Southwest. \n4  The vast majority of Huntsman’s flights originate in the Oakland International Airport, which is \n5  located in this District.  Following more than 12 years of active duty service in the Air Force, \n6  Huntsman joined the Air Force Reserves in 2012.  Since the time that Huntsman began working \n7  for Southwest in February 2012, Huntsman has routinely taken short term military leave to serve \n8  in the Air Force Reserves. Huntsman resides in Sacramento, California. \n9  12.  Southwest Airlines Co. is a publicly traded company and, according to Southwest’s \n10  2016 annual report, as of June 30, 2016, Southwest was the largest domestic air carrier in the \n11  United States, as measured by the number of domestic originating passengers boarded.  Southwest \n12  currently employs more than 8,800 pilots, and a substantial percentage of those pilots currently \n13  serve or have served in the United States Armed Forces during their employment with Southwest.  \n14  Southwest is an employer within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 4303(4)(A).  \n15  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n16  13.  Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules \n17  of Civil Procedure on behalf of the following persons: \n18  All current and former pilots of Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) or any \nsubsidiary, joint venture, or division of Southwest who since January 1, 2001 (A) \n19  took leave from their employment at Southwest to engage in qualified military \nservice for a period of fewer than 30 days, and (B) (1) were eligible to receive \n20 \nretirement contributions under USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4318, for such a period of \nqualified military service, or (2) were not credited with paid sick leave for such a \n21 \nperiod of qualified military service, and the beneficiaries of all such persons.   \n22   \nExcluded from the Class are the following persons: (a) all former or current individuals who \n23 \npreviously reached settlements with or judgments against Southwest resolving or releasing any \n24 \nclaims arising during the Class Period under USERRA related to inadequate pension contributions \n25 \nfor short term periods of military leave and the failure to provide accrued paid sick leave during \n26 \nshort term periods of military leave; and (b) any person who served as a fiduciary of the Plan and \n27 \ntheir beneficiaries under the Plans and any member of the immediate family of, and any heirs, \n28 \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 4 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 5 of 18\n \n \n \n1   successors or assigns of any such person. \n2  Impracticability of Joinder \n3  14.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. According to \n4  Southwest’s 2016 annual report, Southwest had 7,900 pilots in 2016. Upon information and belief, \n5  at least hundreds and likely over 1,000 former and current Southwest pilots are members of the \n6  proposed Class.  \n7  15.  Southwest employs thousands of pilots, including members of the proposed Class, \n8  throughout the United States.  Upon information and belief, the members of the Class are \n9  geographically dispersed.  \n10  Commonality  \n11  16.  The central question in this case concern whether the Southwest pilots’ federal \n12  statutory rights under USERRA were violated by Southwest when Southwest failed to make the \n13  proper amount of retirement contributions to the Southwest pilots and to provide accrued paid sick \n14  leave for periods of short term military leave. \n15  17.  As Southwest adopted and applied a uniform policy or practice for calculating and \n16  making retirement contributions owed under USERRA with respect to the military leave of \n17  Southwest pilots, and for failing to provide accrued paid sick leave for periods of short term \n18  military leave, the answers to these questions will produce common answers for all members of \n19  the proposed Class. \n20  18.  Plaintiff’s claims raise subsidiary common questions that will also have common \n21  answers for each Class Member, including, but not limited to, the following:  \n22  (a) Whether Southwest failed to make retirement contributions for short term periods \n23  of military leave that Southwest pilots took prior to and through 2014, in violation of \n24  USERRA § 4318?  \n25  (b) Whether Southwest prevented Southwest pilots from receiving retirement \n26  contributions for short term periods of military leave since 2014 in violation of \n27  USERRA § 4318? \n28  (c) Whether Southwest failed to provide accrued paid sick leave to pilots who took \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 5 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 6 of 18\n \n \n \n1    short term military leave  in violation of USERRA § 4316? \n2   (d) Whether Southwest’s violations of USERRA were willful, making it appropriate to \n3  award liquidated damages under USERRA? \n4  (e) What, if any, other relief should be granted? \n5  19.  Because the retirement contributions and failure to pay accrued paid sick leave for \n6  periods of the Southwest pilots’ qualified military service were based on uniform policies or \n7  practices, and any recovery can be paid into the Southwest pilots’ individual retirement accounts, \n8  or deposited into the sick leave banks of the pilots, or paid directly to the pilots, all issues \n9  regarding relief are common.  \n10  20.  Even if the ultimate allocation of recovery into the Southwest pilots’ individual \n11  retirement accounts or their sick leave banks is considered, the unifying issues concerning the \n12  policies are the failure to make the proper retirement contributions required by USERRA § 4318 \n13  and the failure to provide accrued paid sick leave in violation of USERRA § 4316.  As Southwest \n14  acted in a systematic manner with respect to the Class Members, all members of the Class suffered \n15  the same type of injuries based on two discrete policies, and resolving the claims of the Class will \n16  be based on common legal and factual questions. \n17  Typicality  \n18  21.   Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the other members of the proposed Class. Plaintiff \n19  challenges two discrete policies by which Southwest made retirement contributions for short term \n20  periods of the Southwest pilots’ qualified military service in violation of USERRA and failed to \n21  provide accrued paid sick leave in violation of USERRA.  \n22  22.  The relief sought consists primarily of: (1) a declaration establishing that Southwest \n23  violated USERRA; (2) an order requiring Southwest to recalculate the retirement contributions \n24  owed to members of the Class and provide accrued paid sick leave to the Class; and (3) an order \n25  that the restored losses and accrued paid sick leave be allocated into the individual retirement \n26  accounts of the members of the Class or be provided to the Class Members.    \n27   \n28   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 6 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 7 of 18\n \n \n \n1   Adequacy \n2  23.  Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of other members of the \n3  Class.  Plaintiff is aware of no conflict with any other member of the Class.  Plaintiff understands \n4  his obligations as a class representative, has already undertaken steps to fulfill them, and is \n5  prepared to continue to fulfill his duties as class representative.  \n6  24.   Southwest has no unique defenses against the Plaintiff that would interfere with \n7  Plaintiff’s representation of the Class.  \n8  25.  Plaintiff’s counsel are experienced in federal court class action litigation, including \n9  civil rights and employee benefits litigation, and have considerable experience and expertise in the \n10  area of USERRA.   \n11  Rule 23(b)(1) \n12  26.  This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1) of the \n13  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because the central questions in this litigation are whether \n14  Southwest violated USERRA in connection with calculating and making retirement contributions \n15  to the Southwest pilots for short term periods of qualified military service and in failing to provide \n16  accrued paid sick leave for periods of short term military leave. \n17  27.  Administration of a pension plan requires that all similarly situated participants be \n18  treated consistently.  As a practical matter, resolution of whether the appropriate amount of \n19  contributions were made to any participant’s account using the policy applied here would be \n20  dispositive of that matter for other members of the Class.  Likewise, conflicting interpretations as \n21  to the manner by which the amount should have been calculated and contributed or credited to the \n22  individual accounts of similarly situated participants would create the risk of establishing \n23  inconsistent standards of conduct for the Plan, its administrator, and any subsequently-appointed \n24  independent fiduciary. \n25   \n26   \n27   \n28   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 7 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 8 of 18\n \n \n \n1   Rule 23(b)(2) \n2  28.  This action is also properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2) of \n3  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Southwest is alleged to have violated USERRA in a manner \n4  as to all members of the Class.  As such, Southwest has acted or refused to act on grounds that \n5  apply generally to the Class.  As a result, final declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the Class \n6  as a whole. \n7  29.  The monetary relief that Plaintiff seeks either flows from and/or is incidental to the \n8  declaratory relief sought, as it flows directly from the ordering of such declaratory relief and can \n9  be calculated in a simple, objective, and mechanical manner.   \n10  Rule 23(b)(3) \n11  30.   This action is also properly maintainable as a class action under Rule 23(b)(3) of \n12  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n13  31.  The questions of law and fact common to the members of the Class predominate \n14  over questions affecting only individual members, and a class action is superior to other available \n15  methods for the fair and efficient resolution of this controversy.  \n16  32.  By resolving the common issues described above in a single class proceeding, each \n17  member of the proposed Class will receive a determination of whether Southwest violated \n18  USERRA, and will receive the remedy that should be provided under USERRA. \n19  33.  Upon information and belief, there is no other pending litigation that has raised \n20  similar allegations with respect to Southwest. \n21  34.  This is an appropriate forum for these claims because, among other reasons, \n22  jurisdiction and venue are proper, and, as a result of Southwest’s significant operations and large \n23  number of employees in this District, a substantial part of the Class likely earned their retirement \n24  contributions in this District, and at least a portion of the Class likely resides in this District.  \n25  35.  There are no difficulties in managing this case as a class action.  \n26   \n27   \n28   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 8 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 9 of 18\n \n \n \n1    FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n2  The Pension and Retirement Rights Mandated by USERRA \n3  36.  Since 2001, Southwest has employed hundreds to thousands of pilots who have \n4  served their country in the United States Armed Forces during their employment with Southwest.   \n5  37.  When these Southwest pilots take military leave to serve in the Armed Forces, \n6  federal law requires Southwest to treat these employees as if they never took leave from their \n7  civilian jobs at Southwest.  For example, USERRA requires Southwest to reemploy Southwest \n8  pilots who take military leave, and restore the rights and benefits related to the employees’ \n9  positions.  38 U.S.C. §§ 4312, 4316. \n10  38.  In addition, USERRA mandates that for the purpose of retirement benefits an \n11  employee who returns to his job after serving in the military must be treated as if he or she never \n12  took a day off from his or her civilian job.  38 U.S.C. § 4318.   \n13  39.  The retirement benefits of servicemembers have been protected for decades, \n14  because Congress has understood that a servicemember’s retirement security should not be \n15  compromised simply because he or she answers the call to duty—no more than a servicemember \n16  should lose his or her civilian job due to serving in the Armed Forces.  These rights are central to a \n17  statutory scheme that the U.S. Supreme Court has said constitutes the “mechanism for manning \n18  the Armed Forces of the United States.” Alabama Power Co. v. Davis, 431 U.S. 581, 583 (1977). \n19  40.  As an employer within the meaning of USERRA, Southwest has been required to \n20  comply with USERRA and ensure that Southwest pilots receive the retirement contributions \n21  mandated by 38 U.S.C. § 4318.   \n22  41.  Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 4318(a)(1)(A), Southwest and the Plans have been required \n23  to comply with USERRA § 4318(a)(2), which provides as follows:  \n24  (A) A person reemployed under this chapter shall be treated as not having incurred \na break in service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan by reason \n25  of such person’s period or periods of service in the uniformed services.  \n \n26  (B) Each period served by a person in the uniformed services shall, upon \nreemployment under this chapter, be deemed to constitute service with the \n27  employer or employers maintaining the plan for the purpose of determining the \nnonforfeitability of the person’s accrued benefits and for the purpose of \n28  determining the accrual of benefits under the plan.  \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 9 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 10 of 18\n \n \n \n1    42.  For each period of military service, USERRA § 4318(b)(1) provides that the \n2  employer is “liable to an employee pension benefit plan for funding any obligation of the plan to \n3  provide the benefits described in subsection (a)(2) [of § 4318] and shall allocate the amount of any \n4  employer contribution for the person in the same manner and to the same extent the allocation \n5  occurs for other employees during the period of service.”   \n6  43.  Southwest is an employer under USERRA because it “pays salary or wages for \n7  work performed or that has control over employment opportunities.”   38 U.S.C. § 4303(4)(a).   \n8  44.  To “comput[e] an employer’s liability” to make retirement contributions under § \n9  4318(b)(1), USERRA § 4318(b)(3) provides that “the employee’s compensation during the period \nof service described in subsection (a)(2)(B) shall be computed”:  \n10 \n(A) at the rate the employee would have received but for the period of service \n11 \ndescribed in subsection (a)(2)(B), or (B) in the case that the determination of such \nrate is not reasonably certain, on the basis of the employee’s average rate of \n12 \ncompensation during the 12-month period immediately preceding such period (or, \n13  if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding such period).  \n45.  Under this rule, an employee whose compensation during a period of military leave \n14 \nis reasonably certain is entitled to receive retirement contributions based on the rate of \n15 \ncompensation that the employee would have received but for that period of military service, or, if \n16 \nthe employee’s compensation is not reasonably certain, based on the 12-month average \n17 \ncompensation prior to the period of military service.   \n18 \n46.  Under USERRA, when a retirement plan requires the employee to make a \n19 \nretirement contribution before the employer will match that contribution or a portion of the \n20 \nemployee’s contribution, the employee is required to make a “make-up” USERRA contribution \n21 \nbefore the employer is required to make its own “make-up” contribution to the employee’s \n22 \nretirement account.  38 U.S.C. § 4318(b)(2). \n23 \n47.  For many years, Southwest has maintained a defined contribution retirement plan \n24 \nfor its pilots, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Retirement Savings Plan (“the Plan”).  Since January 1, \n25 \n2017, under the Plan each pilot is entitled to receive a non-elective contribution that is allocated to \n26 \nthe pilot, regardless of whether the pilot made salary reduction contributions during the plan year \n27 \n(13.4% in 2017, 14.2% in 2018, and 15.0% in 2019 and following years).  However, prior to \n28 \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 10 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 11 of 18\n \n \n \n1   January 1, 2017, Southwest only made a matching contribution for each pilot based on a portion of \n2  the pilot’s compensation that the pilot contributed to the Plan, such as 9.3% of the pilot’s \n3  compensation in 2016.    \n4  48.  Southwest has stated in its Summary Plan Descriptions (“SPD”) of the Plan that it \n5  will count qualified military service towards the compensation that determines the amount of \n6  retirement contributions that will be made by the company (on or after January 1, 2017), or that \n7  can be made by the pilot and matched by Southwest (prior to January 1, 2017).  However, the SPD \n8  and related Plan Documents have not identified the formula that Southwest uses to calculate the \n9  “deemed” compensation that will be used for periods of qualified military service.  Nor have the \n10  SPD or related Plan Documents identified any process or method by which Southwest would \n11  inform pilots about the amount of retirement contributions that they could make and which \n12  Southwest would match for short term periods of military leave prior to January 1, 2017.  \n13  49.  Under Southwest’s Plan, pilots who engage in military service and satisfy \n14  USERRA’s reemployment requirements are supposed to be able to make up any missed \n15  contributions to their retirement accounts during periods of military leave (even though Southwest \n16  has not paid the pilot for that period of time) and have Southwest make a matching contribution to \n17  the pilots’ accounts.  For example, if a pilot takes military leave for a year and his or her “deemed” \n18  compensation for that year is $100,000, then in 2016 the pilot was supposed to be able to \n19  contribute up to a 9.3% of that $100,000 of deemed compensation into his defined contribution \n20  account, and Southwest would then make a matching 9.3% contribution ($9,300) into the pilot’s \n21  account.  This make-up contribution procedure is mandated by USERRA.  38 U.S.C. § 4318(b)(2).   \n22  Southwest Violated the Retirement Provisions of USERRA  \n23  50.  For many years, Southwest has failed to satisfy its obligations under USERRA § \n24  4318 with respect to pilots who take short term military leave. \n25  51.  For pilots’ periods of short term leave (fewer than 30 days), Southwest was \n26  obligated to make retirement contributions under § 4318.  However, upon information and belief, \n27  prior to and through 2014, Southwest did not provide pilots with any retirement contributions for \n28  the short term periods in which pilots took military leave—or in the alternative, Southwest failed \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 11 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 12 of 18\n \n \n \n1   to inform Southwest pilots about the amount of retirement contributions that they could make and \n2  Southwest would match for the periods of short term military leave, effectively eliminating the \n3  ability of pilots to receive matching contributions for such periods of leave.  As a result, the pilots \n4  who took such short term military leave did not have the opportunity to make employee \n5  contributions for such periods of short term leave and have those contributions matched by \n6  Southwest.  Similarly, during and after 2014, Southwest failed to provide Plaintiff and members of \n7  the Class with information about the amount of retirement contributions that they could make and \n8  Southwest would match for the periods of short term military leave, denying them the ability to \n9  make and have matched by Southwest the appropriate amount of retirement contributions for \n10  periods of short term military leave.  \n11  52.  By denying pilots the appropriate amount of retirement contributions for periods of \n12  short term military leave, Southwest violated USERRA § 4318. \n13  53.  For Southwest pilots like Plaintiff Huntsman and other members of the proposed \n14  Class who regularly took short term military leave, Southwest’s violations of USERRA § 4318 \n15  caused the pilots to receive lower amounts of USERRA retirement contributions than the amounts \n16  that were required by USERRA § 4318.   \n17  54.  In the case of Plaintiff Huntsman, despite his multiple requests, he was not \n18  provided with any information by Southwest about the amount of retirement contributions that he \n19  could make (and that Southwest would match) for any short term periods of military leave from \n20  2012 to present.  From 2012 to present, Plaintiff Huntsman has taken dozens of periods of short \n21  term military leave, most of which were between one and six days.   \n22  55.  On multiple occasions during and/or after 2016, Plaintiff Huntsman has \n23  communicated with the principal official at Southwest who is responsible for USERRA \n24  retirement-related issues and asked the official to provide Plaintiff Huntsman with information on \n25  the amount of retirement contributions that he could make and Southwest would match for periods \n26  of short term military leave.  Plaintiff Huntsman was told by the official that Southwest has no \n27  process or procedure for informing him and other Southwest pilots on the amounts of retirement \n28  contributions that they could make and Southwest would match for periods of short term military \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 12 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 13 of 18\n \n \n \n1   leave.  As a result, Plaintiff Huntsman and other members of the Class have routinely been unable \n2  to receive matching retirement contributions for periods of short term military leave that they have \n3  taken. \n4  Southwest Failed to Provide Southwest Pilots with Accrued Sick Leave During                    \nPeriods of Military Leave in Violation of USERRA  \n5 \n6  56.  Ordinarily, when Southwest pilots are working they accrue paid sick leave that they \n7  can use in the future.   \n8  57.  Prior to the filing of this Complaint, Southwest has never provided Southwest pilots \n9  with any accrued sick leave during the periods in which they engage in military leave, including \n10  periods of short term military leave.   \n11  58.  During the same period, however, Southwest provided similarly situated Southwest \n12  pilots with accrued sick leave for other comparable forms of leave, including employees on jury \n13  duty and duty with the pilots’ union, as well as employees on bereavement leave.   \n14  59.  USERRA § 4316(b) provides in relevant part that “a person who is absent from a \n15  position of employment by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be” \n(A) deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence while performing such service; \n16 \nand \n17   \n(B) entitled to such other rights and benefits not determined by seniority as are \n18  generally provided by the employer of the person to employees having similar \nseniority, status, and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence under a contract, \n19 \nagreement, policy, practice, or plan in effect at the commencement of such service \nor established while such person performs such service. \n20 \n \n21  60.  Accordingly, if an employer provides non-seniority rights and benefits to similarly \n22  situated employees, USERRA § 4316 requires the employer to provide the same rights and \n23  benefits to employees during their military leave.  See id.; 20 C.F.R. § 1002.150(a).  As the \n24  USERRA regulations state, the “most significant factor to compare” two types of leave to \n25  determine if they are a “comparable form of leave” is “the duration of the leave.”  20 C.F.R.          \n26  § 1002.150(a).  In addition, “other factors such as the purpose of the leave and the ability of the \n27  employee to choose when to take the leave should also be considered.”  Id.  \n28   \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 13 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 14 of 18\n \n \n \n1    61.  For Southwest pilots, the duration of jury duty, union duty, and short term military \n2  leave is comparable.  They can routinely last days to weeks, but usually do not last more than a \n3  month.  Moreover, with respect to both jury duty and military duty, the employee usually has no \n4  choice over whether to take leave from work to engage in such duty.  Finally, with respect to jury \n5  duty and military duty, the purpose of the leave is to serve our government and to engage in public \n6  service for the benefit of our society.  Likewise, the purpose of union duty is to engage in service \n7  for the good of fellow members of the community—the working men and women of Southwest \n8  and Southwest itself.  \n9  62.  Southwest’s policy of refusing to provide accrued paid sick leave to Southwest \n10  pilots who engage in short term military leave violates USERRA § 4316, because Southwest \n11  denies pilots a non-seniority benefit that Southwest provides to similarly situated employees who \n12  are on furlough or leave of absence.  38 U.S.C. § 4316.   \n13  63.  This policy has adversely impacted the amount of accrued paid sick leave that \n14  Southwest pilots receive when they engage in short term military leave compared to pilots who \n15  receive accrued paid sick leave when they engage in jury duty, union duty, or bereavement leave.  \n16  COUNT I \n17  (Violation of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4318) \n18  64.  Plaintiff incorporates the allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs as if \n19  fully set forth herein.  \n20  65.  USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4318(a)(2)(B), provides that an employee’s service in the \n21  uniformed service will be deemed to constitute service with the employer for purposes of \n22  determining the accrual of benefits under the retirement plan.  This rule applies to the defined \n23  contribution plan that Southwest has maintained for its pilots in which Southwest would match \n24  retirement contributions that its pilots would make into the plan prior to 2017.   \n25  66.  Pursuant to USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4318(b)(1), an employer reemploying a person \n26  after a period of service in the uniformed services is liable to the employee benefit pension plan \n27  for funding any obligation of the plan to provide benefits, including those accrued under USERRA \n28  § 4318(a)(2)(B).  An employer must also make a contribution to a pension or retirement plan \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 14 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 15 of 18\n \n \n \n1   where the employer’s contribution is “contingent on” the employee first making a contribution.  \n2  38 U.S.C. § 4318(b)(2). \n3  67.  As described in detail above, prior to and after 2014 Southwest violated USERRA \n4  § 4318 by not counting periods of short term military leave towards the compensation that it used \n5  to determine retirement contributions for periods of short term military leave, and/or by refusing to \n6  provide pilots with information that was necessary for them to know the amount of retirement \n7  contributions that they could make and Southwest would match.  Accordingly, Southwest denied \n8  those pilots the retirement contributions they otherwise would have received under USERRA.   \n9  68.  Because Southwest applied its policy in violation of USERRA, Plaintiff and the \n10  Class received retirement contributions in their defined contribution accounts that were smaller \n11  than what they would have received had Southwest complied with USERRA.  Southwest’s \n12  violations of USERRA § 4318 was willful and in reckless disregard of the law.  Accordingly, \n13  Southwest should be required to pay liquidated damages to former and current Southwest pilots \n14  whose retirement contributions were reduced due to Southwest’s violations of USERRA.  38 \n15  U.S.C. § 4323(d)(1)(C). \n16  COUNT II \n17  (Violation of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4316) \n18  69.  Plaintiff incorporates the allegations contained in the foregoing paragraphs as if \n19  fully set forth herein.  \n20  70.  USERRA requires Southwest to provide its pilots who take military leave with the \n21  same non-seniority rights and benefits that it provides to similarly situated pilots who are on \n22  furlough or leave of absence.  38 U.S.C. § 4316(b); 20 C.F.R. §§ 1002.149, 1002.150(a).   \n23  71.  As described above, Southwest has violated USERRA § 4316(b) by failing to \n24  provide its pilots who take short term military leave with any accrued paid sick leave while \n25  simultaneously providing accrued paid sick leave to pilots who engage in jury duty, union duty, \n26  and bereavement leave or other comparable types of leave.  These types of leave are comparable \n27  in terms of duration, purpose, and the ability of the employee to determine whether to take the \n28  leave.  Accordingly, Southwest was required by USERRA § 4316(b) to provide accrued paid sick \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 15 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 16 of 18\n \n \n \n1   leave to Southwest pilots who took short term military leave, but failed to do so in violation of \n2  federal law.   \n3  COUNT III \n4  (Violation of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4323) \n5  72.  USERRA provides that employees may receive liquidated damages in the event \n6  that the trier of fact determines that the defendant willfully violated the statute.  38 U.S.C. § \n7  4323(d)(1)(C).  \n8  73.  In this instance Plaintiff Huntsman and the pilots’ union, inter alia, repeatedly \n9  informed Southwest’s management and principal decision makers that its actions regarding the \n10  company’s retirement and sick leave policies did not comply with USERRA.  \n11  74.  Moreover, Southwest was on notice of USERRA’s requirements as Southwest, like \n12  all other employers in America, is required to post the statutorily-mandated workplace poster that \n13  informs both workers and management of USERRA’s rights and responsibilities. \n14  75.  As described above, Southwest’s violations of USERRA § 4318 and USERRA § \n15  4316 were willful and occurred in reckless disregard for the law.  \n16  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n17  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that judgment be entered against Defendant on all claims \n18  and respectfully requests that this Court award the following relief:  \n19  A.   Declare that Defendant’s policy with respect to the formula by which any \n20  retirement contributions related to Plaintiff and the proposed Class Members’ short term periods \n21  of military leave were calculated by Southwest violated the rights of Plaintiff and the Class under \n22  USERRA and declare that Defendant’s failure to provide accrued paid sick leave to pilots who \n23  took short term military leave violated the rights of Plaintiff and the Class under USERRA. \n24  B.   Declare that Plaintiff and the Class were and are entitled under USERRA to receive \n25  contributions to their defined contribution retirement accounts in an amount that is consistent with \n26  USERRA § 4318 and that they are entitled to receive accrued paid sick leave in the amount that is \n27  consistent with USERRA § 4316;   \n28  C.   Require Defendant to fully compensate Plaintiff and the Class for the loss of \n \n  CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 16 \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-03972-JD   Document 1   Filed 07/14/17   Page 17 of 18\n \n \n \n1   benefits suffered by reason of its failure to comply with the provisions of USERRA by awarding \n2  an amount that fully compensates Plaintiff and the Class for Defendant’s failure to make these \n3  retirement contributions and accrued paid sick leave when originally due, including any lost \n4  earnings on the unmade contributions or accrued paid sick leave and/or awarding Plaintiff and the \n5  Class prejudgment interest on the amount of contributions or accrued paid sick leave that were \n6  required to be made under USERRA but which Defendant  failed to make (whichever amount is \n7  greater); \n8  D.   Order Defendant to comply with USERRA, 38 U.S.C. § 4318 and § 4316; \n9  E.  Order the Defendant to pay all members of the Class liquidated damages in an \n10  amount to be determined at trial.  38 U.S.C. § 4323(d)(1)(C); \n11  F.  Require Defendant to pay attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § \n12  4323(h), and/or this Court’s inherent equitable authority and powers, and ordering the payment of \n13  reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses of this action to Plaintiff’s counsel on the basis of the \n14  common benefit and/or common fund doctrine (or other applicable law) out of any money or \n15  benefit recovered for the Class or the Plans in this Action. \n16  G.  Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems proper, appropriate, just \n17  and/or equitable including, without limitation, allowing for any adverse tax consequence \n18  multiplier to be applied to any jury award.  \n19  JURY DEMAND \n \n20  Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury.  \n \n21 \nDated: July 14, 2017  Respectfully submitted, \n \n22 \nBy:   /s/ Jahan C.

Berry appeared for Defendant Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”).   \n7  At the hearing, the Court directed Plaintiff’s counsel to file supplemental briefing to \n8  address two issues: (1) the proposed reimbursement amount for the settlement administrator’s \n9  costs; and (2) the legal basis and accounting of the reimbursement requested for the named \n10  Plaintiff’s hours spent in service to the class.  ECF No. 55.  In addition, the Court ordered \n11  Plaintiff’s counsel to file a revised proposed Final Approval Order.  Id.   \n12  On July 2, 2019, Plaintiff submitted supplemental briefing and a revised Final Approval \n13  Order.  Dkt. No. 56.   \n14  The Parties have also submitted their Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement”), which \n15  this Court preliminarily approved in its December 5, 2018 order (the “Preliminary Approval \n16  Order”).  In accordance with the Preliminary Approval Order, Class Members have been given \n17  notice of the terms of the Settlement and the opportunity to submit a claim form, comment on the \n18  settlement, and/or opt out of its provisions.   \n19  In addition, pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1715 \n20  (“CAFA”), Southwest has given the Attorney General of the United States and the appropriate \n21  state officials in the states in which the Class Members reside timely notice of the Settlement. \n22  Having received and considered the Settlement, the supporting papers filed by the Parties, \n23  including the post-hearing supplemental briefing, and the evidence and argument received by the \n24  Court at the final approval hearing on June 20, 2019, by means of this order (the “Final Approval \n25  Order”), the Court grants final approval to the Settlement and orders as follows. \n26   \n27 \n28 \n   [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 1 -  FINAL JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Definitions \n \n \n2  1.  Except as otherwise specified herein, the Court for purposes of this Final \n \n \n3  Approval Order adopts all defined terms set forth in the Settlement. \n \n \n4  Jurisdiction \n \n     \n5  2.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this litigation and all claims \n6  raised in this action and released in the Settlement, and personal jurisdiction over Southwest and \n7  all Class Members (except for Robert J. Waltz, who timely filed an opt-out request).  \n8  Specifically, this Court has federal question jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n9  § 1331. \n10  Dissemination of Notice to Class Members \n11  3.  Pursuant to the Preliminary Approval Order, the notice documents were sent to \n12  each Class Member by email and by first-class mail.  The notice materials informed Class \n13  Members of the terms of the Settlement, how their settlement share would be calculated, how to \n14  submit a Claim Form, their right to comment on (including object to) the Settlement or opt out of \n15  the Settlement to pursue their claims individually, and their right to appear in person or by \n16  counsel at the final approval hearing and be heard regarding approval of the Settlement.  \n17  Adequate periods of time were provided by each of these procedures. \n18  4.  The Court finds and determines that this notice procedure afforded adequate \n19  protections to Class Members and provides the basis for the Court to make an informed decision \n20  regarding approval of the Settlement based on the responses of Class Members.  Notice was \n21  accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Settlement.  The Court finds and determines that \n22  the notice provided in this case was the best notice practicable, which satisfied the requirements \n23  of law and due process. \n24  Notice to Attorneys General Pursuant to CAFA \n25  5.  Pursuant to CAFA, within 10 days after the filing of the motion seeking \n26  preliminary approval of the Settlement, Southwest served upon the Attorney General of the \n27  United States and the state attorneys general officials of the states in which the Class Members \n28 \n [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 2 -  FINAL JUDGMENT   \n                                                          CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1  reside a notice of the Settlement consisting of the appropriate settlement notice documents.  This \n \n \n2  Final Approval Order is being entered at least 90 days after the later of the dates on which the \n \n \n3  appropriate federal and state officials were served with the notice of proposed settlement. \n \n \n4  6.  The Court finds and determines that Southwest’s notice of Settlement was timely, \n \n     \n5  adequate, and compliant with the statutory requirements of CAFA.  Accordingly, 28 U.S.C. \n6  § 1715(e) has no application to the Settlement. \n7  Certification Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 and the FLSA \n8  7.  For the reasons stated in the Preliminary Approval Order, this Court finds and \n9  determines that the proposed Settlement Class, as defined in Section IV.A of the Settlement and \n10  in Section II.A of its Preliminary Approval Order, meets all of the legal requirements for class \n11  certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (“Rule 23”) (a) and (b)(3), and it is hereby \n12  ordered that the Settlement Class is finally approved and certified as a Class for purposes of \n13  settlement of this action. \n14  Fairness \n15  8.  Pursuant to Rule 23(e), the Court further finds and determines that the terms of \n16  the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate to the Class and to each Class Member and that \n17  the Class Members who have not opted out will be bound by the Settlement, that the Settlement \n18  is ordered finally approved, and that all terms and provisions of the Settlement should be and \n19  hereby are ordered to be consummated.  The Court specifically finds that the Settlement is \n20  rationally related to the strength of Plaintiffs’ claims given the risk, expense, complexity, and \n21  duration of further litigation.  This Court also finds that the Settlement is the result of arms’-\n22  length negotiations between experienced counsel representing the interests of the Class Members \n23  and Southwest, under the supervision of an experienced and independent third-party mediator, \n24  after thorough factual and legal investigation.  Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 960 (9th Cir. \n25  2003); Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1291 (9th Cir. 1992). \n26  9.  The Court has received and considered the objection of Brent Dennis, which was \n27  timely filed on May 6, 2019.  ECF No. 51.  Mr. Dennis’s objection expressed his concern over \n28 \n [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 3 -  FINAL JUDGMENT   \n                                                          CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1  the discount for claims earlier in the class period, as well as his personal concern about \n \n \n2  harassment and retaliation against servicemembers at Southwest.  The Court finds that the Plan \n \n \n3  of Allocation reasonably and fairly discounted Class Members’ claims for 2001 to 2007 on the \n \n \n4  basis that Southwest’s defenses as to those claims were stronger than its defenses for claims from \n \n     \n5  2008 and afterwards.  In addition, the level of recovery for these claims is still substantial, \n6  particularly given that the claims are 11 to 18 years old and face a serious statute of limitations \n7  defense.  To the extent that Mr. Dennis’s objection concerned alleged retaliation or other \n8  hostility against servicemembers, such claims are not at issue in this action and are not released \n9  by the Class Settlement.  Accordingly, Mr. Dennis’s objection does not alter the Court’s \n10  conclusion that the Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.     \n11  10.  The Court finds and determines that the payments to be made to the Class \n12  Members as provided for in the Settlement, Section VIII.D, are fair and reasonable.  The \n13  proposed plan of allocation bases each Class Member’s recovery on (a) all periods of Short-Term \n14  Military Leave that are identified by the Class Member between January 1, 2001 and December \n15  31, 2007, and (b) all periods of Short-Term Military Leave with one or more dropped trips that \n16  the Class Member took between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013.  The plan of allocation \n17  is rational.  The Court hereby gives final approval to the payments and orders those amounts be \n18  paid to the claimants out of the Net Fund Value in accordance with the terms of the Settlement.  \n19  The Court also hereby gives final approval to the additional paid sick leave and orders those \n20  amounts to be added to their sick leave balances. \n21  Class Member Response \n22  11.  The Court further finds that the response of the Class Members to the Settlement \n23  supports settlement approval.  Of the 1,999 Class Members and Potential Class Members, only \n24  one opted out of the Settlement, and only one objected to the Settlement. \n25  12.  The Court hereby excludes Robert J. Waltz from the Settlement and Release on \n26  the basis of his opt-out request, which was timely provided to the Settlement Administrator on \n27  March 12, 2019, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Class Notice.   \n28 \n [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 4 -  FINAL JUDGMENT   \n                                                          CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Late Claim Form \n \n \n2  13.  For good cause shown, the Court permits consideration of the late Claim Form \n \n \n3  postmarked May 23, 2019. \n \n \n4  Appointment of Class Representatives and Class Representative Service Awards  \n \n     \n5  14.   The Court confirms as final the appointment of Jayson Huntsman as Class \n6  Representative of the Rule 23 Class.   \n7  15.  The Court approves a $9,969.60 service award to plaintiff Huntsman based on his \n8  time spent in service to the Class.  In this case, plaintiff has submitted sufficient “evidence of the \n9  proposed awardees’ involvement in the case and other justifications for the award,” N.D. Cal. \n10  Procedural Guidance for Class Action Settlements, such that the Court is able to make an \n11  informed decision on this issue.  Of the 100 hours claimed by Huntsman, Dkt. No. 49-9 ¶ 10, the \n12  Court deducts 16 hours of travel time and his 24 hours of informal communications with class \n13  members.  Dkt. No. 49-9 ¶¶ 10(c), (e), (g).  The Court accepts Huntsman’s proposed hourly rate \n14  of $166.16, Dkt. No. 56 at 3, and consequently grants him an award of $9,969.60.     \n15  Appointment of Class Counsel; Attorneys’ Fees and Costs \n16  17.  Class Counsel attest to performing substantial work on behalf of the Class \n17  Members, totaling $703,471 in lodestar as of June 6, 2019.  The Court finds the hours worked by \n18  Class Counsel to be reasonably incurred for the benefit of the Class Members.  Class Counsel’s \n19  hourly rates, ranging from $250 to $290 for staff and $280 to $900 for attorneys, are reasonable \n20  in light of the market for legal services of this type and quality.  The Court confirms as final the \n21  appointment of Jahan C. Sagafi, Peter Romer-Friedman, and Rachel Williams Dempsey of \n22  Outten & Golden LLP, Matthew Z. Crotty from Crotty & Son Law Firm, PLLC, and Thomas \n23  Jarrard from Law Office of Thomas G. Jarrard, PLLC as Class Counsel for the Rule 23 Class.  \n24  Class Counsel has capably and effectively represented the Class Members’ interests.  The Court \n25  finds and determines that the payment of $1,500,000 in attorneys’ fees and $33,761.32 in \n26  litigation costs and expenses is reasonable.  See, e.g., Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043 \n27  (9th Cir. 2002); Chemical Bank v. City of Seattle (In re Washington Public Power Supply Sec. \n28 \n [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 5 -  FINAL JUDGMENT   \n                                                          CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Litig.), 19 F.3d 1291, 1297 (9th Cir. 1994).  This fee is approximately 26% of the total fund and \n \n \n2  8% of Plaintiffs’ estimated Settlement value, which is consistent with Ninth Circuit guidance for \n \n \n3  class action settlements.  Under a lodestar cross-check, the lodestar multiplier of 2.13x supports \n \n \n4  the fee award.  The Court hereby gives final approval to that amount and orders that payment be \n \n     \n5  made to Class Counsel out of the Gross Fund Value in accordance with the terms of the \n6  Settlement. \n7  Settlement Administrator Report and Fees  \n8  18.  Upon completion of administration of the Settlement, the Settlement \n9  Administrator will provide written certification of such completion to the Court and counsel for \n10  the Parties. \n11  19.  The Court finds and determines that reimbursement of Settlement Administrator \n12  costs in the amount of $54,000 is reasonable and hereby gives final approval to that amount.  \n13  Release \n14  20.  By operation of the entry of this Final Approval Order and pursuant to the \n15  Settlement, all Qualified Claimants are permanently barred from prosecuting against Southwest \n16  any Claim as set forth in Section XIV of the Settlement.  The Court has reviewed the release in \n17  Section XIV of the Settlement and finds it to be fair, reasonable, and enforceable under Rule 23, \n18  and all other applicable law.  \n19  Contingency on Finality \n20  21.  If, for any reason, the Settlement ultimately does not become Final (as defined in \n21  the Settlement, Section XV), this Final Approval Order will be vacated; the Parties will return to \n22  their respective positions in this action as those positions existed immediately before the parties \n23  executed the Settlement; and nothing stated in the Settlement or any other papers filed with this \n24  Court in connection with the Settlement will be deemed an admission of any kind by any of the \n25  Parties or used as evidence against, or over the objection of, any of the Parties for any purpose in \n26  this action or in any other action. \n27 \n28 \n [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 6 -  FINAL JUDGMENT   \n                                                          CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n1  Final Judgment and Dismissal \n \n \n2  22.  By means of this Final Approval Order, this Court hereby enters final judgment in \n \n \n3  this action, as defined in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58(a)(1).  \n \n \n4  23.  Without affecting the finality of the Court’s judgment in any way, the Court \n \n     \n5  retains jurisdiction over this matter for purposes of resolving issues relating to interpretation, \n6  administration, implementation, effectuation and enforcement of the Settlement.  Nothing in this \n7  Final Approval Order will preclude any action to enforce the Parties’ obligations under the \n8  Settlement or under this order, including the requirement that Southwest make the settlement \n9  payments in accordance with the terms of the Settlement. \n10  24.  The Parties are hereby ordered to comply with the terms of the Settlement. \n11  25.  This action is dismissed with prejudice, each side to bear its own costs and \n12  attorneys’ fees except as provided by the Settlement and the Court’s orders. \n13   \n14   \n15  Dated: October 4, 2019     \n16                        \nJAMES DONATO \n17  United States District Judge \n   \n18   \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n [PROPOSED] FINAL APPROVAL ORDER AND  \n  - 7 -  FINAL JUDGMENT   \n                                                          CASE NO. 17-CV-03972-JD \n \n  ",
