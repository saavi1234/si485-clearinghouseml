In its separate conferences, the court previously directed the parties to confer in aid of an efficient settlement process. Given the start time of 10:30 a.m., Plaintiffs' counsel can use the time from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. to meet with the plaintiffs (and can use the witness rooms in the attorney's lounge on 18). If there is any further work on either side that can be accomplished before the settlement conference by a follow-up phone call, the parties must arrange that through courtroom deputy Lashanda Scott on Thursday morning, June 26, so that a call can be scheduled later in the afternoon of June 26.

    "summary": "<p>This civil rights case is related to the treatment of โOccupy Oaklandโ protestors by the police and sheriffโs department in Oakland, CA. The plaintiffs brought this class action lawsuit on January 14, 2013 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against police officers and the City of Oakland, as well as the Alameda County sheriff and corrections officers. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, seeking damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief to protect their constitutional rights. They claimed that the defendants had violated their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and state law by holding them in jail following the mass arrest of plaintiffs without a chance to disperse.</p><p>On January 28, 2012, the plaintiffs attended an โOccupy Oaklandโ march. As they marched, they alleged that they were corralled by the police, never given an opportunity to disperse, and placed under mass arrest. While corralled, the โclass members were pushed, clubbed, and driven into a shrinking space by these two advancing lines.โ Instead of being issued citations, class members were sent to the county jail. The plaintiffs alleged that they were kept in inhumane and humiliating conditions during this time. They were released between 12 and 85 hours later and were not charged. </p><p>Following an alternative dispute resolution phone conference, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler. On November 21, 2014, the motion for preliminary approval of the Class Action settlement was denied due to issues with the settlement itself (the original settlement contained an error in class definition, the scope of the release was impermissibly broad, undeliverable funds were not allocated, and attorneyโs fees were not properly handled) as well issues as the class notification. These issues were mostly fixed; District Judge Nathanael Cousins certified the class and granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement on January 5, 2015, with issues in class notification corrected later. The class consisted of โthe approximately 360 people who were arrested in the mass arrest on Broadway between 23rd and 24th Streets in Oakland on January 28, 2012, and who were never charged with any crime related to this arrest.\" 2015 WL 65501.</p><p>Under the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay $1,360,000 to the plaintiffs, including attorneyโs fees and costs, and to seal and destroy the arrest records and biological samples from the mass arrest. The case against the individual defendants was dismissed on April 7, 2015 by Judge Cousins as part of the settlement agreement. On July 30, 2015, Judge Cousins issued an order granting a supplemental order of exoneration and to seal and destroy arrest records. The case is now closed, having had no activity since July 30, 2015. </p><p>While this case did not yield injunctive relief, another case did. On September 9, 2019, a court approved a settlement agreement in the similar case of <a href=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12771><i>Spalding v. City of Oakland</i></a>, under which the Oakland Police Department and the Alameda Sheriffโs Office adopted new policies regarding crowd control and mass arrests.</p><p></p>",

Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, monetary damages, and the destruction of records pertaining to the arrest. They claimed that they had been subject to 14th amendment violations, false arrest and imprisonment, violation of state law, and negligence during the course of their arrest and detention. Plaintiffsโ arrest records pertaining to this event were sealed and destroyed as part of a $1.36 million settlement. ",

This is a civil rights class action arising from the unconstitutional and unlawful \n2 \narrest and incarceration of approximately 409 people by the Oakland Police Department, \n3 \nAlameda County Sheriff's Office and multiple agencies working in joint action and \n4 \nproviding mutual aid under the direction of the Oakland Police, on January 28, 2012. \n5 \n2.  That day, hundred of individuals participated in an \"Occupy Oakland\" rally and \n6 \nmarch to protest the economic inequalities of our country, state and city; and the utilization \n7 \nof resources by and for the \"1 %\" instead of for  \"99%\".  Oakland Police and other law \n8 \nenforcement agencies, under color of law, in their efforts to stop the lawful First \n9 \nAmendment activity, and corralled and trapped plaintiffs who were marching and others in \n10 \nthe area. \n11 \n3.  Without a dispersal order or other warning, class members were detained, arrested, \n12 \ntransported to an Alameda County jail, and imprisoned for 12 and 85 hours.  Class \n13 \nmembers include members of the press corp, with valid press identifications, medics, legal \n14 \nobservers, and non-march bystanders.  Rather than cite and release, class members were \n15 \nincarcerated for long periods in overcrowded and inhumane conditions, including unheated \n16 \nor deliberately chilled cells, with limited seating, no sleeping facilities, sometimes standing \n17 \nroom only, no toilet facilities, no feminine hygiene, and no food, water or medical care. \n18 \n4.  The Oakland Police Department's actions, including the wrongful mass arrest and \n19 \nimprisonment, violated multiple provisions of the Oakland Police Crowd Management/ \n20 \nCrowd Control Policy that was entered into by stipulation of the parties and order of the \n21 \nUnited States District Court in settlement of plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief in Coles, \n22 \neta/. v. City ofO  akland (No.C03-2961 THE) and Loca/10, International Longshore and \n23 \nWarehouse Union, eta/. v. City ofO  akland, (Nos. 2962 THE), on December 24,2004. \n24 \n5.  Plaintiffs further allege that the police and sheriff's department actions were the \n25 \nresult of continuing unlawful and unconstitutional policies and practices of the City of \n26 \nOakland, the Oakland Police Department (\"OPD\"), Alameda County and the Alameda \n27 \nCounty Sheriffs Office (\"ACSO\").  On numerous prior occasions, including January, \n28 \n2009, July 8, 2010, and November 5, 2010 during public protests of the Oscar Grant \nPage 2 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 3 of 25\nshooting and the Johannes Mehserle verdict; OPD similarly violated the Crowd \n1 \nManagement/Crowd Control Policy by trapping demonstrators, use of excessive force, \n2 \nfailure to give dispersal orders or to permit marchers to disperse, by conducting mass \n3 \narrests, holding people in jail on misdemeanors charges in over crowded and inhumane \n4 \ncondition rather than citing and releasing people.  Spalding v. City ofO  akland (no. \n5 \n3:20 11-cv-02867). \n6 \n6.  This ongoing and continuing OPD and ACSO misconduct create a substantial \n7 \nchilling effect and deterrent to future First Amendment protected activity in Oakland.  The \n8 \nnamed plaintiffs, on behalf of a class of all those arrested in the January 28, 20 12, mass \n9 \narrest in the vicinity of Broadway between 23rd and 24th Streets, Oakland, intend to \n10 \nparticipate in peaceable protests and assemblies in the City of Oakland in the future. \n11 \n7.  Defendants' actions deprived the plaintiff class of their right to freedom of speech \n12 \nand association; the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; the right to \n13 \nequal protection of the laws and to due process of law; the right to be free from the use of \n14 \nexcessive and/or arbitrary force; and the right to privacy, all guaranteed by the United \n15 \nStates and California Constitutions, as well as additional state law claims relating to the \n16 \npolice actions complained of herein. \n17 \n8.  Class Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class, seek damages and \n18 \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to restrain defendants from continuing to violate plaintiffs' \n19 \nfederal and state constitutional and statutory rights, the protections for these rights in the \n20 \nOakland Crowd Management/ Crowd Control Policy, and from using false arrests, false \n21 \nimprisonment, unreasonable conditions of confmement, and other unlawful actions to \n22 \ndisrupt, interfere with and deter future demonstrations and protest activities in the City of \n23 \nOakland and Alameda County.  Class plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring the \n24 \nDefendants to seal, return and/or destroy any records of Plaintiffs' and class members' \n25 \narrests, including all biological samples.  Class Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and the \n26 \nbehalf of the class, also seek monetary damages for the injuries they suffered when they \n27 \nwere falsely detained, arrested and imprisoned. \n28 \nPage 3 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\n:  J  Case 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 4 of 25\nJURISDICTION \n1 \n2  9.  The jurisdiction of the Court is invoked pursuant to 42; U.S.C. ยง 1983 et seq.; 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a).  Supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims exists \n3 \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367. Venue is proper in the Northern District of California as the \n4 \nevents complained of occurred in this district. \n5 \n10.  Plaintiffs have filed administrative claims with the City of Oakland and Alameda \n6 \nCounty in compliance with California Government Codeยงยง 910, et seq.  The claims have \n7 \nbeen denied expressly or by operation of law. \n8 \n9 \nINTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n10 \n11.  The claims alleged herein arose in the City of Oakland, State of California. \n11 \nTherefore, venue and assignment lies in the United States District Court for the Northern \n12 \nDistrict of California, San Francisco Division or Oakland Division. \n13 \n14 \nTHE PARTIES \n15 \nThe Plaintiffs \n16 \n15.  Stephen Angell is student and a resident of the City of Oakland.  Mr. Angell joined \n17 \nthe march at Frank Ogawa Plaza and along with other class members was herded, \n18 \nthreatened with batons and tear gas, corralled and trapped by defendants OPD, ACSO and \n19 \nother peace officers in the detainment area. \n20 \n16.  Pressed up against the doors of the Oakland YMCA, Mr. Angell, entered the \n21 \nYMCA after the YMCA staff opened its doors.  Defendants OPD, ACSO and other peace \n22 \nofficers, while threatening class members with firearms, arrested, handcuffed and removed \n23 \nMr. Angell and several other class members from the YMCA. \n24 \n17.  Mr. Angell did not commit a crime, was never ordered or allowed to disperse and \n25 \ndid not witness or hear any police warnings prior to being herded, corralled and trapped by \n26 \nDefendants in the detainment area. \n27 \n18.  Mr. Angell was unlawfully detained and prevented from leaving the detainment area \n28 \nby defendants OPD, ACSO and other peace officers  for approximately two to three hours \nPage4 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\n..  \n. \nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 5 of 25\nbefore he was transported to Santa Rita Jail.  With Mr. Angell, was an individual who had \n1 \nnot participated in the March and had entered the Y seeking warmth and refuge from the \n2 \npolice action.  This individual was ill, distressed and vomited on the bus.  The bus driver \n3 \nand the guards on the bus ignored the ill individual, and provided no medical care.  Once \n4 \nat Santa Rita, class members were held on the bus for period of time before being moved \n5 \ninto Santa Rita jail. \n6 \n19.  At Santa Rita jail, Mr. Angell separated from other class members, strip-searched, \n7 \ndressed in jail clothing and placed into a freezing cold room without adequate clothing or \n8 \nbedding.  The only place to sleep was to lie on the icy ground.  Thereafter he was required to \n9 \nundergo a tuberculosis test and other examinations and then placed with the general prison \n10 \npopulation.  When he was moved into the main housing  with the general prison population, \n11 \nsheriff deputies attempted to incite the regular prison inmates to take violent action against \n12 \nMr. Angell by announcing to  general jail inmates that all inconveniences, deprivation of \n13 \nprivileges, and other irregularities should be blamed on Mr. Angell, and that the general jail \n14 \ninmates should take any and all frustrations they have with the conditions of their \n15 \nincarceration, out on Mr. Angell.  This caused Mr. Angell great fear and emotional distress as \n16 \nhe was concerned that he would be subject to physical attack and violence. \n17 \n20.  Four days later, on February 1, 2012,  Mr. Angell was transported to court, where \n18 \ncharges were not filed.  Mr. Angell was not immediately released but required to remain in \n19 \ncustody and return to Santa Rita.  At Santa Rita he was again held for hours, and during this \n20 \ntime, he was denied all food and water and told that he would not be released unless he \n21 \nprovided a biological sample of his DNA.  Based upon the threat of continued incarceration, \n22 \nthe deprivation of food and water, Mr. Angell provided a biological sample.  Mr. Angell was \n23 \nheld over 84 hours and fmally released in the morning of February 2, 2012.  Mr. Angell was \n24 \nnever charged. \n25 \n21.  Miles Avery is a resident of Oakland and of Alameda County.  Mr. Avery joined \n26 \nthe march at Frank Ogawa Plaza.  Mr. Avery, along with other class members was herded, \n27 \nthreatened with batons and tear gas, corralled and trapped by defendants OPD, ACSO and \n28 \nother peace officers in the detainment area. \nPageS of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\n.ยทโข  \n~  Case 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 6 of 25\n22.  While the class members were being squeezed by defendants into a smaller and \n1 \nsmaller space by the YMCA, Mr. Avery spoke out and stated that no dispersal order had \n2 \nbeen given and there was no probable cause for arrest.  In response a number of uniformed \n3 \npeace officers  grabbed Mr. Avery, pulled him out of the crowd and threw him face down \n4 \nonto the ground.  One peace officer twisted his right arm behind his back, and put plastic \n5 \nhandcuffs on.  Another peace officer put his knee onto Mr. Avery's brain stem, and \n6 \nkneeled on Mr. Avery head, thereby grounding Mr. Avery's face into the concrete, causing \n7 \ncuts and scrapes and bleeding.  Simultaneously, other peace officers administered blows to \n8 \nMr. Avery's organs and lower back while they yelled that this is what happens when you \n9 \nresist arrest. \n10 \n23.  Then one or more peace officers dragged Mr. A very to the side while they started \n11 \narresting the rest of the group.  Mr. Avery was then put on an over crowded bus to Santa \n12 \nRita, where defendant guards and peace officers tried to force Mr. Avery and another \n13 \nindividual into a metal cage which was only big enough for one person.  When the sheriff \n14 \nguards and peace officers attempted to close the door to the cage, the door would not close. \n15 \nAs a result an officer, hauled Mr. Avery out, threw him against the bus, and yelling in Mr. \n16 \nAvery's face that if he did not do exactly what he was told, they would make his life \n17 \n\"hell\". \n18 \n24.  In Santa Rita, Mr. Avery was told that he was arrested for failure to disperse, and \n19 \nfor \"verbally resisting\" arrest, and placed in a holding cell over night.  The next morning, \n20 \neveryone else was cited and released, but Mr. Avery was moved into a solitary cell, and \n21 \nheld in two different solitary cells for most of the day.  During this day, he was denied food \n22 \nand denied access to a telephone.  Late that afternoon, Mr. Avery was moved out of \n23 \nsolitary confmement into a regular holding cell.  In the middle of the night, he taken out \n24 \nand dressed in a blue prison jump suit.  That evening, he was able to, for the first time, \n25 \ntelephone his father, who then posted cash bail of $7,000.00 \n26 \n25.  Two days later, after bail had been posted, Mr. Avery was moved to a large holding \n27 \ncell with a capacity for about 20 people, in preparation for being released.  Throughout the \n28 \nday, more and more people were moved into that cell, so that at one point, the cell was so \nPage 6 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\n. .. \nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 7 of 25\nover crowded, there was standing room only.  People were so tightly packed in, no one \n1 \ncould raise his arms.  There was no ventilation and due to the circumstances, tempers \n2 \nstarted to flare.  There was no toilet in the cell, so the people packed into the release cell \n3 \nhad to urinate on the concrete floor or on clothing, which they piled in the comer to soak \n4 \nup the urine.  Mr. Avery heard a sheriffs deputy state that anyone who pushed the \n5 \nemergency button would be punished with additional incarceration unless it was because \n6 \nsomeone was dying.

While \n9 \nparticipating on the Occupy Oakland march on January 28, 2012, she found herself \n10 \nsqueezed into the front of the Oakland YMCA, facing a row of armed police, dressed in \n11 \nriot gear, and with armed police behind her, brandishing weapons, so that she had no \n12 \nability to leave the area.  Ms. Batchelder, along with other class members was herded, \n13 \nthreatened with batons and tear gas, corralled and trapped by defendants OPD, ACSO and \n14 \nuniformed peace officers in the detainment area. \n15 \n27.  She never heard a dispersal order until after she was informed that she was being \n16 \narrested.  She loudly requested the opportunity to disperse, and verbally asserted her \n17 \nconstitutional rights under the 1st and 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n18 \n30.  Hearing Ms. Batchelder's statements, uniformed peace officers grabbed Ms. \n19 \nBatchelder, threw her to the ground, and beat her with batons, resulting in head injuries. \n20 \nMs. Batchelder suffered injuries to her body, face and head.  She was then handcuffed, \n21 \nplaced in a van and transported to Glen Dyer jail.  Once at Glen Dyer, Ms. Batchelder was \n22 \nforced to take a pregnancy test, and released from imprisonment 12 hours later.  She \n23 \nreceived no medical attention.

Ms. Coles along with other \n28 \nclass members was herded by batons and tear gas, corralled and trapped by Defendants \nPage 7 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\n. \n. \n' \nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 8 of 25\ninto the detainment area. \n1 \n32.  Ms. Coles did not commit a crime, was never ordered or allowed to disperse and did \n2 \nnot witness or hear any police warnings prior to being herded, corralled and trapped by \n3 \ndefendants OPD, ACSO and other peace officers  in the detainment area.  Upon being \n4 \ndetained, a police officer or sheriff ripped the flower out of Ms. Coles' hand and threw it \n5 \non the ground.  Ms Coles was standing close to Molly Batchelder and saw defendants grab \n6 \nand throw Ms. Batchelder to the ground and beat her with batons.  Ms. Coles was \n7 \nunlawfully detained and prevented from leaving the detainment area by uniformed officers \n8 \nfor approximately two hours before she was handcuffed and transported to Santa Rita jail. \n9 \nDuring the transport, one of the women on Ms. Coles' bus yelled that her cuffs were too \n10 \ntight.  The guards, the deputies, the driver and other individuals employed by OPD and \n11 \nACSO ignored this woman and did not even check the handcuffs.  The deputies on the bus \n12 \ntold Ms. Coles that class members were receiving the treatment they deserved. \n13 \n33.  At Santa Rita Jail, Ms. Coles was held in four different holding cells.  All the holding \n14 \ncells were freezing cold, with cold air blowing in through ceiling vents.  In the \n15 \novercrowded holding cells, many of the class members did not have adequate clothing for \n16 \nthe freezing temperatures, and the women took to sharing jackets to stay warm.  In one \n17 \ninstance, a woman class member began to menstruate, and it required the collective yelling \n18 \nof the entire cell for a very long period of time, before a guard came by, and even longer \n19 \nbefore a menstrual pad was provided. \n20 \n34.  The class members were held without communication or information for extended \n21 \nperiods of time.  The guards made a ritual of coming once every few hours, to read names \n22 \noff of a list, and for the first 15-20 hours, none of the people in the holding cell were on the \n23 \nlist.  The guards would not explain the process, nor why class members were being held, \n24 \nnor when anyone would be permitted to make a phone call.  Ms. Coles was not permitted a \n25 \nphone call until after 30 hours of imprisonment.  None of the women she was placed in \n26 \nholding cells with were permitted to make a phone call until 30 to 40 hours had elapsed. \n27 \nMs. Coles was imprisoned for 53 hours and never booked nor charged. \n28 \n35.

Thereafter, she was transported on a very \n6 \ncold bus with its windows open, to Santa Rita, where they were kept on the bus for an \n7 \nadditional extended period of time.  Individuals on the bus who requested access to toilet \n8 \nfacilities were told to urinate on themselves and their clothes. \n9 \n36.

Defendant County of Alameda, is a public entity organized under the California \n3  Constitution and laws of the State of California, and is responsible for the policies and \n4  funding of the Alameda County Sheriffs Office. \n5 \n47.  Sheriff Gregory Ahern, is an official of Alameda county, as defmed in Government \n6 \nCode ยง24000,  with responsibility for supervising, training, assigning, administrating and \n7 \ncontrolling all deputy sheriffs and employees of the Alameda County Sheriffs Office \n8 \n(\"ACSO\").

Plaintiffs will ask leave to amend this complaint to insert \n22 \nfurther charging allegations when such facts are ascertained. \n23 \n52.  Each of the defendants, including defendants DOES 1 through 250, caused, and is \n24 \nresponsible for, the below-described unlawful conduct and resulting injuries by, among other \n25 \nthings, personally participating in the unlawful conduct or acting jointly or conspiring with \n26 \n27  others who did so; by authorizing, acquiescing in or setting in motion policies, plans or \n28  actions that led to the unlawful conduct; by failing to take action to prevent the unlawful \nPage 13 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 14 of 25\n1  conduct; by failing and refusing with deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' rights to initiate and \n2  maintain adequate training and supervision; and by ratifying the unlawful conduct that \n3  occurred by agents and officers under their direction and control, including failing to take \n4  remedial or disciplinary action. \n5  53.

In doing the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, defendants, and each of them, acted \n8 \nunder color of authority and/or under color of law. \n9 \n55.  In doing the acts and/or omissions alleged herein, defendants, and each of them, acted \n10 \nas the agent, servant, employee and/or in concert with each of said other defendants. \n11 \n12 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n13 \n56.  Class Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal \n14 \nRules of Civil Procedure and seek to pursue claims for damages, injunctive and declaratory \n15 \nrelief on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated. \n16 \n57.  The proposed class consists of persons who were herded, corralled and then arrested in \n17 \nthe mass arrest that occurred on the evening of January 28, 2012 on Broadway in Oakland, \n18 \nbetween 23rd and 24th Street.  Each single class member was detained, arrested, imprisoned \n19 \nand never charged with any crime. \n20 \n58.  The named plaintiffs' allege that their First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights \n21 \nand their state law and common law rights against false arrest and false imprisonment were \n22 \nviolated, raising common questions of law and fact. \n23 \n59.  By encircling and arresting all of the demonstrators, as well as observers, and \n24 \nbystanders who happened to be in the area, without probable cause or lawful justification, an \n25 \nwithout any warning or opportunity to disperse, defendants acted on grounds generally \n26 \napplicable to the class. \n27 \n28 \nPage 14 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 15 of 25\n1  60.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class.  The claims of \n2  the class members arise from the actions that resulted in damages to the class representatives \n3  and are based on the same legal theories. \n4  61.  The representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \n5  because they were subject to the unlawful law enforcement conduct complained ofherein, \n6  and have no interests antagonistic to other members of the class.  In addition, plaintiffs' \n7 \ncounsels are experienced in litigating federal civil rights cases and class actions. \n8 \n62.  The defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \n9 \nclass, and injunctive and declaratory relief for the class as a whole is appropriate. \n10 \n63.  The prosecution of separate actions by individual mem hers of the class would create a \n11 \nrisk of inconsistent or incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants, thereby making \n12 \nclass action the superior method of adjudicating the controversy. \n13 \n14  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n15  64.  On January 28, 2012, class members and others, participated in an \"Occupy Oakland\" \n16  political protest demonstration, exercising their Constitutional Rights to freedom of speech, \n17  assembly and association under the federal and state constitutions, to protest economic \n18  inequalities and injustice in our country, our state and our city; to protest the role of our city \n19  government in the diversion of public resources and public funds to \"the 1%  \" and for the \n20  benefit of\"the 1%\" instead offor \"the 99%\" and the benefit of\"the 99%\", as well as \n21  wholesale foreclosures of homes in the City of Oakland, and the fact that the City of Oakland \n22  and the State of California, own and possess or control numerous vacant homes which are not \n23  available to families who have been foreclosed on and/or are homeless. \n24  65.  In the late afternoon of January 28, 2012, after speeches, music and the sharing of food \n25  in Frank Ogawa Plaza, roughly 500 to 1,000 people engaged in spirited chanting, and \n26  exercising constitutional rights, commenced marching.  As the marchers went north on \n27  Telegraph Avenue, a large force of police and peace officers was deployed to herd and corral \n28  them and stop the lawful First Amendment activity.  Near or just past 19th Street, squads of \nPage 15 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 16 of 25\nofficers began to attack the crowd, pushing from behind, rushing in swinging batons, \n1 \ndischarging \"flash-bang\" grenades and tear gas.  OPD and peace officers who responded to \n2 \nOPD's request for mutual aid created a formation directly behind the marchers, so that the \n3 \nmarchers and class members were herded forward.  At 23rd Street, the marchers turned right, \n4 \nand right again on Broadway with the goal of returning to Frank Ogawa Plaza, the terminus \n5 \nof the march. \n6 \n66.  Police and peace officers erected a police line on 24th street, blocking all passage \n7 \ndown Broadway past 24th street.  The marchers, together with a number of other people who \n8 \nwere not part of the march-on Broadway, between 23rd and 24th Streets were completely \n9 \ncorralled and confmed between two walls of armed police and peace officers.  To avoid \n10 \ncrossing the police lines in order to avoid being physically injured by the police, and because \n11 \nthere were no side streets or other exits, the marchers congregated in the middle of the block, \n12 \nwhere the YMCA is located.  No dispersal orders were given and no one gave orders or \n13 \nannouncements telling the marchers where to go or what to do until after defendant OPD \n14 \nannounced that all class members were under arrest. \n15 \n67.  Class members were not simply contained between the two lines of police and \n16 \ndeputies, Class members were pushed, clubbed, and driven into a shrinking space by these \n17 \ntwo advancing lines.  The unjustified tactics of OPD and Police created a melee, filling the \n18 \ncrowd with confusion, panic and fear; causing numerous injuries to plaintiffs and class \n19 \nmembers.  There was no exit except into the YMCA.  Class members requested that YMCA \n20 \nstaff open the YMCA's doors.  Some number entered the YMCA; and some number quickly \n21 \nleft, through a rear exit.  Others were stopped by police and deputies, pointing these firearms \n22 \nat them, while ordering them to lie down on the ground. \n23 \n68.  The entire now-encircled group, of some 400 - 500 people, was, without probable \n24 \ncause, placed under arrest, allegedly for failure to disperse, although they were given no \n25 \nnotice or opportunity to disperse.  After the announcement of arrest, class members, \n26 \nrepeatedly requested permission to disperse, which permission was denied.  Anyone who \n27 \nattempted to do so was met with the use of force, causing injuries. \n28 \nPage 16 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 17 of 25\n69.  The police and deputies, unprovoked, caused additional injuries by pushing, attacking \n1 \nand battering class members who verbally challenged the arrests as without probable cause. \n2 \nThose arrested inside the YMCA were charged with felony burglary, resulting in high bail \n3 \nand extended imprisonment.  Journalists with press passes were included in these false \n4 \narrests, in direct contravention to OPD policy.  Medics, legal observers and some bystanders \n5 \nwere detained, arrested and incarcerated.  Rather than cite and release class members, the \n6 \ndecision was made to arrest and transport class members to a county jail, which subjected \n7 \nclass members to  imprisonment for some period of time. \n8 \n70.  Class members corralled at the detainment area, without probable cause or lawful \n9 \njustification, were forced to stand or sit in the street for hours.  Class members were not \n10 \nallowed to use toilet facilities, so the only place to relieve themselves was on the street or in \n11 \ntheir clothing.  Some class members were placed on buses and held there for further long \n12 \nperiods without access to toilet facilities, and some had medical conditions that required \n13 \naccess to toilet facilities, and ended up soiling themselves and urinating on the bus.  As a \n14 \nresult class members suffered discomfort, embarrassment and humiliation.  Class members \n15 \nwith medical needs were barred from taking their medications, and prescribed medications \n16 \nwere confiscated. \n17 \n71.  After detaining the class members on the street, in the growing cold, OPD, ACSO and \n18 \nother peace officers tied each of the class members hands with plastic handcuffs behind their \n19 \nbacks.  Class members were kept handcuffed for inordinate and unnecessarily long periods of \n20 \ntime, and handcuffs/ties were intentionally or heedlessly applied much too tightly-causing \n21 \npain, extended discomfort, and injuries.  Officers and deputies refused to loosen or remove \n22 \nthe handcuffs until the class members arrived at the jail, late that night or in the early \n23 \nmorrung. \n24 \n72.  Class members were loaded  onto buses and vans.  The lengthy detention on the cold \n25 \nstreet was followed with lengthy waits on cold buses where the windows were open.  Class \n26 \nmembers were driven on the freeway for 45 minutes to Santa Rita Jail, enduring wind and \n27 \ncold.  Some class members were taken to Glen Dyer Jail in Oakland, but the majority was \n28 \ntaken to Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. \nPage 17 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 18 of 25\n73.  ACSO deputies ordered female class members to submit to a pregnancy test and \n1 \nordered to urinate into a cup.  If a class member tried to decline the pregnancy test, ACSO \n2 \ndeputies threatened her with separation from other class members, isolation and a longer \n3 \nperiod of incarceration.  Female class members were embarrassed and humiliated by the \n4 \nforced urination and pregnancy testing. \n5 \n74.  At Santa Rita, class members were held in extremely over-crowded cells and other \n6 \nspaces, which lacked cots or other sleeping surfaces.  Many class members were so over-\n7 \ncrowded that there was not room for everyone to sit or lie down on the floor.  Class members \n8 \nwere held incommunicado.  Phone calls were denied for long periods of time.  Class members \n9 \nwere denied access to legal counsel.  Toilets and sanitary facilities were inadequate or non-\n10 \nexistent. Means for personal hygiene, particularly feminine hygiene were denied.  The cells \n11 \nwere extremely cold.  Despite the winter weather, cold air was continually being blown in \n12 \nand class members' extra clothes were taken away.  No one was provided with blankets or \n13 \nother means to stay warm.  Some were deprived of food and water for extended periods of \n14 \ntime.  Class members with particular medical needs continued to be deprived of needed \n15 \nmedical care, and medication.  Class members were subjected to physical and mental abuse \n16 \nand other inhumane and unreasonable conditions of confmement, which caused them to \n17 \nsuffer pain, discomfort, distress and injury. \n18 \n75.  ACSO staff and deputies instructed, attempted to provoke and motivate other, non-\n19 \nclaimant, in-custody individuals to threaten, intimidate, attack and otherwise injure class \n20 \nmembers.  When class members were transferred out of holding cells into the main housing \n21 \nunits, ACSO staff and deputies maliciously informed other in-custody individuals that all \n22 \ndeprivations and problems they experienced were the fault of class members, in an attempt to \n23 \nfoment hostility and violence by regular incarcerated individuals against class members. \n24 \nACSO staff and deputies engaged in threats, taunts and other verbal abuse against class \n25 \nmembers. \n26 \n76.  All class members at Santa Rita were held for excessive periods, with those arrested \n27 \non felony charges, held for four days before release.  Even after the district attorney in court \n28 \ndeclined to file charges, these class members arrested were required to ride the bus back to \nPage 18 of26 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 19 of 25\nSanta Rita, endure continued imprisonment without food and water.  ACSO and its deputies \n1 \ndemanded that all those wrongfully arrested on felony charges surrender buccal swab samples \n2 \nof their DNA, stating that any class member who did not surrender a buccal swab of DNA, \n3 \nwould not be released. \n4 \n77.  Some class members were ultimately released without booking or citations.  Others \n5 \nwere released with citations.  As with the arrests, there was no cause or reason or \n6 \njustification for class members to be transported to jail and incarcerated.  These actions were \n7 \ntaken to deter class members from public protest and the exercise of free speech. \n8 \n78.  None of the class was charged or prosecuted, but all now have arrest records.  and will \n9 \nincur legal costs to attempt to have the arrests removed from the records. \n10 \n79.  In 2004, the Oakland Police Department adopted a comprehensive Crowd \n11 \nManagement/ Crowd Control Policy, in settlement of plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief in \n12 \nColes, eta/. v.  City ofO  akland (No. C03-2961, TEH) and Local 10, International Longshore \n13 \nand Warehouse Union, eta/. v. City ofO  akland, (No. C03-2962 THE), which litigation arose \n14 \nfrom the OPD shootings of peaceful demonstrators and longshoremen with wooden bullets \n15 \nand other \"less lethal\" projectiles during an antiwar demonstration.  The Policy was \n16 \nincorporated into the Stipulation and Order approving the class settlement on December 24, \n17 \n2004.  The Policy was made into an OPD Training Bulletin and all members of OPD were \n18 \nrequired to be trained on the Policy on an ongoing basis. \n19 \n80.  The Police Action of January 28, 2012 violated numerous provisions of the OPD \n20 \nCrowd Management/ Crowd Control Policy, including, but not limited to, ~ 8(F), which \n21 \nspecifies that mass arrest may be carried out only after the specific requirements and \n22 \nprocedures for declaring an unlawful assembly have been followed.  And these procedures \n23 \nrequire negotiations, a dispersal order, and an opportunity for marchers to disperse, none of \n24 \nwhich were provided to class members. \n25 \n81.  The OPD Crowd Management/ Crowd Control Policy was also violated when officers \n26 \nand deputies following defendant OPD's directions, arrested all class members without the \n27 \nrequisite probable cause required for each individual arrest. Section IX(A)(5) of the Crowd \n28 \nControl Policy instructs that \"Individuals may not be arrested based on their association with \nPage 19 of26 \nAngell v.

In violation of~ X of the Crowd Control Policy,  and contrary to California Penal \n3 \nCode section 853.6, defendants OPD and ACSO jailed class members arrested on \n4 \nmisdemeanors, instead of release with a citation. \n5 \n6 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n7 \n8 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n9 \nViolation Of First Amendment To The United States Constitution \n10 \n(42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n11 \n83.

City of Oakland \nComplaint \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 23 of 25\n102.  The above-described acts and omissions of defendants breached the duty of care \n1 \ndefendants owed to the named individual plaintiffs. \n2 \n3  REQUISITES FOR RELIEF \n4  103.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the violations of the plaintiffs' constitutional \n5  and lawful rights complained of herein were caused by customs, policies, directives, \n6  practices, acts and omissions of authorized policy makers of the defendants CITY OF \n7  OAKLAND, OPD, COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, ACSO including defendants JORDAN, \n8  AHERN, ISRAEL, BRESHEARS, YELDER, ALLISON, TULL,  TRACEY,  RACHAL, and \n9  WHENT,  GREGORY J. AHERN, BRETT KETELES, CARLA KENNEDY, DAVID \n10  BRADY, GREGORY L. MORGADO, KERRY  and other supervisory officials and \n11  employees of the OPD, and of the ACSO who encouraged, authorized, directed, condoned, \n12  and ratified the unconstitutional and unlawful conduct complained of herein.  Said customs, \n13  policies and practices include, but are not limited to the use of mass arrests without probable \n14  cause and pre-charging imprisonment under inhumane conditions to disrupt and deter \n15  demonstrators and First Amendment protected activity; the failure to maintain adequate \n16  policies, and to adequately train, supervise and control OPD officers and ACSO deputies \n17  concerning the policing of demonstrations and other expressive activities with respect to \n18  crowd control, crowd dispersal and the constitutional and statutory limitations on arrests and \n19  imprisonment. \n20  104.  As a direct and proximate result of the conduct of defendants described herein, the \n21  named individual plaintiffs have been denied their constitutional, statutory and legal rights as \n22  stated below, and have suffered general and special damages, including but not limited to, \n23  mental and emotional distress, physical injuries and bodily harm, pain, fear, humiliation, \nembarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety and other damages in an amount according to proof. \n24 \n105.  Defendants' acts were willful, wanton, malicious and oppressive and done with \n25 \nconscious disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiffs' rights. \n26 \n106.  Defendants' policies, practices, customs, conduct and acts alleged herein have resulted \n27 \nand will continue to result in irreparable injury to plaintiffs, including but not limited to \n28 \nPage23 of25 \nAngell v. City ofO  akland \nComplaint \n\n.. \nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 1   Filed 01/14/13   Page 24 of 25\nviolations of their constitutional and statutory rights.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or \nI \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein.  The plaintiffs and class \n2 \nmembers intend in the future to exercise their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and \n3 \nassociation by engaging in demonstrations and expressive activities in the City of Oakland \n4 \nand the County of Alameda.  Defendants' conduct described herein has created fear, anxiety \n5 \nand uncertainty among plaintiffs with respect to their exercise, now and in the future, of these \n6 \nconstitutional rights.  Plaintiffs therefore seek injunctive relief from this court, to ensure that \n7 \nplaintiffs and persons similarly situated will not suffer violations of their rights from \n8 \ndefendants' illegal and unconstitutional policies, customs and practices as described herein. \n9 \nPlaintiffs also seek injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring that defendants seal and \n10 \ndestroy any records derived from plaintiffs' arrests, including fmgerprints, photographs, and \nII \nother identification and descriptive information, and all information, and biological samples \nI2 \nand information obtained from such biological samples collected from the plaintiff class, and \n13 \nidentify to the plaintiff class all entities and agencies to which such information has been \nI4 \ndisseminated; and that all such disseminated records be collected and destroyed. \nI5 \n107.  An actual controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants in that plaintiffs \nI6 \ncontend that the policies, practices and conduct of defendants alleged herein are unlawful and \nI7 \nunconstitutional, whereas plaintiffs are informed and believe that defendants contend that sai \nI8 \npolicies, practices and conduct are lawful and constitutional.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration of \nI9 \nrights with respect to this controversy. \n20 \n2I \nPRAYER \n22 \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for judgment against defendants, and each of \n23 \nthem, as follows: \n24 \n1.  For an order certifying the class defmed herein pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \n25 \nProcedure Rule 23(b) (2) and (3); \n26 \n2.

CERTIFICATION AND JOINT \n14  MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nCITY OF OAKLAND, and others,  APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \n15  SETTLEMENT \n                            Defendants. \n16  Re: Dkt. Nos. 62, 63, 70 \n17   \n18  This case arises out of the mass detention and arrest of individuals during an โOccupy \n19  Oaklandโ march and protest on January 28, 2012.  Before the Court are plaintiffsโ \n20  unopposed motion for class certification and the partiesโ joint motion for preliminary \n21  approval of class action settlement.  Dkt. Nos. 62, 63.  The Court previously denied the \n22  motion for preliminary approval without prejudice due to several deficiencies in the \n23  proposed settlement agreement and class notice.  Dkt. No. 68.  After the parties submitted a \n24  revised settlement agreement and class notice, Dkt. Nos. 70-1 and 70-2, the Court held a \n25  preliminary approval hearing on December 17, 2014.  No objectors appeared.   \n26  Because the Court finds that the proposed class meets the requirements for \n27  certification under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3), the Court GRANTS \n28  plaintiffsโ motion for class certification.  Additionally, because the parties have made a \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 2 of 22\n \n1  sufficient showing for the purposes of preliminary approval, the Court GRANTS their joint \n2  motion.  However, because the revised proposed notice to the class continues to suffer from \n3  several defects, plaintiffs must file a second revised class notice in accordance with this \n4  order for the Courtโs approval.   \n5  I. BACKGROUND \n6  A.  Plaintiffsโ Allegations \n7  The complaint alleges that, on January 28, 2012, class members and others \n8  participated in an โOccupy Oaklandโ political protest demonstration in Oakland, California.  \n9  Dkt. No. 1 ยถ 64.  In the late afternoon, a group of approximately 500 to 1000 individuals \n10  marched from Frank Ogawa Plaza.  Id. ยถ 65.  As they were marching on Broadway, all class \n11  members were corralled and trapped in front of the Oakland YMCA between 23rd and 24th \n12  Streets by two lines of armed police and peace officers.  Id. ยถ 66.  The complaint alleges \n13  that the class members were pushed, clubbed, and driven into a shrinking space by these \n14  two advancing lines.  Id. ยถ 67.  The complaint further alleges that these tactics were \n15  unjustified and created a melee, filling the crowd with confusion, panic, and fear, and \n16  causing injuries.  Id.  There was no exit except into the YMCA, and some class members \n17  entered there.  Id.  According to the complaint, no dispersal orders were given on Broadway \n18  and no one gave orders or announcements telling the marchers where to go or what to do \n19  until after the police announced that the marchers were under arrest.  Id. ยถ 66.  The \n20  complaint further alleges that the entire group was placed, without probable cause, under \n21  arrest, allegedly for failure to disperse although they were given no notice or opportunity to \n22  disperse.  Id. ยถ 68.  After the announcement of the arrest, class members requested \n23  permission to disperse, which was denied.  Id.  Those who attempted to disperse were met \n24  with the use of force, causing injuries.  Id.     \n25  The complaint further alleges that class members corralled at the detainment area, \n26  without probable cause or lawful justification, were forced to stand or sit in the street for \n27  hours.  Id. ยถ 70.  Class members were not allowed to use toilet facilities, so the only place to \n28  relieve themselves was on the street or in their clothing.  Id.  Some class members were \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   2    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 3 of 22\n \n1  placed on buses and held there for additional long periods without access to toilet facilities.  \n2  Id.  As a result, class members suffered discomfort, embarrassment, and humiliation.  Id.  \n3  Class members with medical needs were barred from taking their medications.  Id.   \n4  According to the complaint, after detaining the class members on the street, \n5  defendants tied each of the class membersโ hands with plastic handcuffs behind their backs.  \n6  Id. ยถ 71.  Class members were kept handcuffed for inordinate and unnecessarily long \n7  periods of time, and handcuffs/ties were intentionally or heedlessly applied too tightly, \n8  causing pain, extended discomfort, and injuries.  Id.  Defendants refused to loosen or \n9  remove the handcuffs until the class members arrived at the jail, late that night or in the \n10  early morning.  Id.   \n11  The complaint alleges that rather than cite and release the class members, the decision \n12  was made to arrest and transport them to an Alameda County jail.  Id. ยถยถ 3, 69.  The class \n13  members were loaded onto buses and vans.  Id. ยถ 72.  The lengthy detention on the cold \n14  street was followed with lengthy waits on the cold buses where the windows were open.  Id.  \n15  All class members were transported to an Alameda County jail, and were imprisoned for 12 \n16  to 85 hours.  Id. ยถ 3.  Some class members were taken to Glenn Dyer Jail in Oakland, but \n17  the majority was taken to Santa Rita Jail in Dublin.  Id. ยถ 72.  Class members were driven \n18  on the freeway for 45 minutes to Santa Rita Jail, enduring wind and cold.  Id.  \n19  The complaint further alleges that the decision to transport class members to an \n20  Alameda County jail subjected class members to imprisonment for long periods in \n21  overcrowded and inhumane conditions, including unheated or deliberately chilled cells, \n22  with limited seating, no sleeping facilities, sometimes standing room only, no toilet \n23  facilities, no feminine hygiene, and no food, water, or medical care.  Id. ยถยถ 3, 69.  Female \n24  class members were embarrassed and humiliated by the forced urination and pregnancy \n25  testing.  Id. ยถ 73.   \n26  The complaint alleges that, at Santa Rita, class members were held in extremely over-\n27  crowded cells and other spaces, which lacked cots or other sleeping surfaces.  Id. ยถ 74.  \n28  Many cells were so over-crowded that there was not room for everyone to sit or lie down on \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   3    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 4 of 22\n \n1  the floor.  Id.  Phone calls were denied for long periods of time.  Id.  Class members were \n2  denied access to legal counsel.  Id.  Toilets and sanitary facilities were inadequate or non-\n3  existent.  Id.  Means for personal hygiene, particularly feminine hygiene were denied.  Id.  \n4  Despite the winter weather, cold air was continually being blown in and class membersโ \n5  extra clothes were taken away.  Id.  No one was provided with blankets or other means to \n6  stay warm.  Id.  Some were deprived of food and water for extended periods of time.  Id.  \n7  Class members with particular medical needs continued to be deprived of needed medical \n8  care, and medication.  Id.  The complaint further alleges that the class members were \n9  subjected to physical and mental abuse and other inhumane and unreasonable conditions of \n10  confinement, which caused them to suffer pain, discomfort, distress, and injury.  Id.  All \n11  class members at Santa Rita were held for excessive periods.  Id. ยถ 76.   \n12  No class members were charged or prosecuted, but all now have arrest records and \n13  will incur legal costs to attempt to have the arrests removed from their records.  Id. ยถ 78.   \n14  B.  Procedural History \n15  This case was filed on January 14, 2013, by eight plaintiffsโSteven Angell, Miles \n16  Avery, Molly Batchelder, Sri Louise also known as Louise Coles, Cicily Cooper, Shareeff \n17  Elfiki, Theodore Hexter, and Lindsay Weber.  See Dkt. No. 1.  The proposed class alleged \n18  in the complaint consists of โpersons who were herded, corralled and then arrested in the \n19  mass arrest that occurred on the evening of January 28, 2012 on Broadway in Oakland, \n20  between 23rd and 24th Street,โ and who were โdetained, arrested, imprisoned and never \n21  charged with any crime.โ  Id. ยถ 57.   \n22  The complaint names as defendants the City of Oakland, the County of Alameda, and \n23  individual defendants employed by the City and the County.  See Dkt. No. 1.  The \n24  complaint alleges causes of action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violations of the First, \n25  Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as state law rights against false arrest and \n26  false imprisonment.  Id.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class, seek (1) \n27  declaratory and injunctive relief to restrain defendants from continuing to violate plaintiffsโ \n28  federal and state constitutional and statutory rights, the protections for these rights in the \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   4    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 5 of 22\n \n1  Oakland Crowd Management/Crowd Control Policy, and from using false arrests, false \n2  imprisonment, unreasonable conditions of confinement, and other unlawful actions to \n3  disrupt, interfere with and deter future demonstrations and protest activities in the City of \n4  Oakland and Alameda County; (2) an injunction requiring the defendants to seal, return, \n5  and/or destroy any records of plaintiffsโ arrests; and (3) monetary damages for the injuries \n6  plaintiffs suffered when they were falsely detained, arrested and imprisoned.  Id. ยถ 8.   \n7  The parties engaged in discovery, which included exchanging written discovery, \n8  taking the depositions of the named plaintiffs and City and County personnel, and \n9  inspections of the Santa Rita and Glenn Dyer jail facilities.  Dkt. No. 19 at 2.  The parties \n10  participated in settlement conferences with Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler over several \n11  months.  Dkt. Nos. 36, 55.  As a result, the parties were able to reach a settlement in \n12  September 2014.  Dkt. No. 60.  Plaintiffs then filed a motion to certify the class, which \n13  defendants do not oppose.  Dkt. Nos. 62, 62-3.  The parties also moved jointly for \n14  preliminary approval of the settlement.  Dkt. No. 63.     \n15  While this case was pending, the case of Spalding v. City of Oakland, No. 11-cv-\n16  02867 TEH, resolved.  The Spalding case was also a class action arising out of a mass arrest \n17  involving the City of Oakland and the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office.  Part of the \n18  resolution of Spalding included injunctive relief regarding the application of cite/release and \n19  booking procedures that will be applied in multiple simultaneous arrest situations.  See \n20  Spalding, No. 11-cv-02867 TEH, Dkt. No. 95-1 at 7-9.  Plaintiffs assert that the injunctive \n21  relief obtained in Spalding addresses and resolves the injunctive relief issues raised in \n22  plaintiffsโ complaint in this case and that, as a result, they are no longer requesting \n23  injunctive relief.

Overview of the Settlement Agreement \n2    1.  Class Definition \n3  The settlement agreement defines the class as โthe approximately 360 people who \n4  were arrested in the mass arrest on Broadway between 23rd and 24th Streets in Oakland on \n5  January 28, 2012, and who were never charged with any crime related to this arrest.โ  Dkt. \n6  No. 70-1 at 6.  The parties explained that 360 is the number of arrestees confirmed through \n7  discovery.  Id. n.3. \n8    2.  Monetary Payment to the Class \n9  Under the settlement agreement, the City and the County will jointly pay the sum of \n10  $1,360,000 within 15 days of the Courtโs entry of final judgment.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 7.  \n11  Those class members who have submitted approved claims will receive an equal part of the \n12  $1,360,000 payment after attorneysโ fees and costs and the class representativesโ awards \n13  have been deducted from this amount.  Id.   \n14  The settlement agreement further provides that, in the event that any check to a \n15  claimant is undeliverable or is uncashed 180 days after it is placed in the mail, the funds \n16  thus unclaimed will be turned over to Families With a Future, a project sponsored by Legal \n17  Services for Prisoners with Children, a non-profit based in San Francisco.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at \n18  8.  \n19    3.  Non-Monetary Benefits of the Settlement  \n20  In addition to the monetary benefits, the settlement agreement includes a stipulation \n21  for the sealing and destruction of all arrest records, police reports, investigative reports, \n22  booking information, online data, or any other documentation or information pertaining to \n23  the arrests of the plaintiffs and those class members who submit approved claims, in the \n24  possession of the City and the County.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 8.  The parties stipulate that the \n25  relief will be the equivalent of a determination of factual innocence pursuant to California \n26  Penal Code ยง 851.8.  Id.  The parties also request a Court order in the names of all of the \n27  plaintiffs and those class members who submit approved claims, stating that that they are \n28  factually innocent of the charges for which they were arrested and that they are thereby \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   6    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 7 of 22\n \n1  exonerated.  Id. \n2  4.  Incentive Awards and Attorneysโ Fees and Costs \n3  Under the settlement agreement, the $1,360,000 payment includes all attorneysโ fees \n4  and costs, including the costs of administering the class settlement, and the class \n5  representativesโ awards approved by the Court.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 7.  The settlement \n6  agreement provides that the eight class representatives will each receive $9,000, or such \n7  amount as the Court approves, and that class counsel will receive $350,000, or such sum as \n8  the Court approves, for attorneysโ fees and costs, including all costs associated with the \n9  administration of the settlement.  Id. \n10    5.  Release of Claims \n11  The settlement agreement further provides that, upon the entry of final judgment by \n12  the Court, โthe Plaintiffs and Claimants shall be deemed to have, and shall have, fully, \n13  finally, and forever waived, released, relinquished, discharged, and dismissed all claims \n14  against the Defendants, their agents, and their employees arising from the events alleged in \n15  Plaintiffsโ Complaint.โ  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 10.  โClaimantsโ is defined in the settlement \n16  agreement as those class members who actually file claims pursuant to the procedures set \n17  forth in the Courtโs preliminary approval order.  Id. at 6.  Additionally, the settlement \n18  agreement provides that โthe Plaintiffs and Class Members, except those who opt out of the \n19  Settlement, shall be forever barred and enjoined from commencing, instituting, prosecuting \n20  or continuing to prosecute any action or other proceeding in any court of law or equity, \n21  arbitration tribunal, or administrative forum, asserting any claims against the Defendants, \n22  their agents, and their employees arising from the events alleged in Plaintiffsโ Complaint.โ  \n23  Id. at 10-11.  The settlement agreement also includes a release by the defendants.  Id. at 11. \n24  The settlement agreement provides for a dismissal with prejudice of the individual \n25  defendants after preliminary approval of the settlement and formal approval of the \n26  settlement by the City and the County.  Id. at 9-10. \n27  // \n28   \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   7    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 8 of 22\n \n1    6.  Class Notice  \n2  The settlement agreement further provides that, no later than 10 days after the \n3  preliminary approval of the settlement, plaintiffs will disseminate the notice of settlement \n4  (including the claim and exclusion forms) by mailing the notice to each class memberโs last \n5  known mailing address, posting the notice on the class action website, and disseminating \n6  information regarding the settlement agreement on social media.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 10.  The \n7  class members will then have 60 days to opt out, or file a claim form, or to object to the \n8  settlement agreement following the procedure set forth in the notice.  Id.  For all class \n9  members who fail to respond within 45 days of the mailing of the notice, plaintiffs will \n10  make every effort to contact those class members through direct contact (such as phone, \n11  email, Facebook, and Twitter).  Id.   \n12  III. DISCUSSION \n13  A.  Class Certification \n14  Class certification requires that: (1) the class be so numerous that joinder of all \n15  members individually is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the \n16  class; (3) the claims or defenses of the class representative must be typical of the claims or \n17  defenses of the class; and (4) the person representing the class must be able fairly and \n18  adequately to protect the interests of all members of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Staton \n19  v. Boeing, 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. 2003).   \n20  In addition to meeting the conditions imposed by Rule 23(a), the parties seeking class \n21  certification must also show that the action is maintainable under Federal Rule of Civil \n22  Procedure 23(b).  Plaintiffs here are seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(3), and \n23  alternatively under Rule 23(b)(2) and (1).  Dkt. No. 62 at 23.  Plaintiffs assert that the action \n24  is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(3) which allows a class action to be certified if โthe court \n25  finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any \n26  questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other \n27  available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n28  23(b); Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 1998).   \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   8    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 9 of 22\n \n1  The proposed settlement class here meets the requirements for certification under \n2  Rule 23(a).  First, the 360 potential class members are sufficiently numerous that joinder of \n3  all members would be impracticable.   \n4  Second, there are questions of fact and law common to all class members, the answers \n5  to which will drive the resolution of the litigation.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 \n6  S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011).  In a civil rights suit, โcommonality is satisfied where the lawsuit \n7  challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class members.โ  \n8  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by \n9  Johnson v. Cal., 543 U.S. 499 (2005).  โIn such circumstance, individual factual differences \n10  among the individual litigants or groups of litigants will not preclude a finding of \n11  commonality.โ  Id.   \n12  Here, plaintiffs claim that defendants declared an unlawful assembly and corralled \n13  and arrested the entire march without notice or opportunity to disperse, and that there were \n14  no individual determinations of probable cause for arrest.  Dkt. No. 62 at 19.  Instead, \n15  plaintiffs contend that defendants created the class when they made the decision to treat the \n16  entire crowd as one, encircled it and arrested every person contained within the police lines.  \n17  Id.  Once defendants made this decision, the class members were all treated identically in \n18  that they were arrested and incarcerated in an Alameda County jail where they endured \n19  similar conditions, with variations in the length of time in incarceration.  Id.; see also Dkt. \n20  No. 62-1.  In challenging defendantsโ policies and practices regarding mass arrests without \n21  probable cause and incarceration of individuals, plaintiffs raise common questions of law \n22  and fact, such as (1) whether defendants made a lawful determination that the march was an \n23  unlawful assembly; (2) whether defendantsโ decision not to give warnings or an opportunity \n24  to disperse before arresting the entire crowd violated the plaintiffsโ and the class membersโ \n25  constitutional rights; (3) whether the length and conditions of incarceration violated the \n26  plaintiffsโ and the class membersโ constitutional rights and California Penal Code ยง 853.6; \n27  and (4) whether the arrests and detentions violated the Oakland Police Crowd Control \n28  Policy adopted as part of the settlement agreement in Coles, et al. v. City of Oakland and \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   9    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 10 of 22\n \n1  Local 10, International Longshore and Warehouse Union, et al. v. City of Oakland, Nos. \n2  03-cv-02961 TEH and 03-cv-02962 TEH.  Dkt. No. 62 at 17-21.  See Spalding v. City of \n3  Oakland, No. 11-cv-2867 TEH, 2012 WL 994644, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 23, 2012) \n4  (granting class certification in similar action arising out of mass arrest and incarceration). \n5  Third, the class representativesโ claims are typical of those of the class.  For purposes \n6  of the typicality inquiry, the named plaintiffsโ injuries need not be identical with those of \n7  the other class members, โonly that the unnamed class members have injuries similar to \n8  those of the named plaintiffs and that the injuries result from the same, injurious course of \n9  conduct.โ  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 869.  Here, this requirement is met as all of the class \n10  members were arrested in a single, coordinated mass arrest at a single location, incarcerated \n11  overnight and longer, and subjected to similar conditions of custody.  See Dkt. Nos. 62 at \n12  21-22; 62-1.  \n13  Fourth, there appear to be no conflicts of interest between the class representatives \n14  and the class members.  Plaintiffs assert that both the class representatives and the class \n15  members have a common interest in ensuring that they would not be subject to mass arrests \n16  without individual determinations of probable cause, a common interest in ensuring that \n17  they would be cited and released rather than transported and held for overly lengthy periods \n18  of time in abject conditions.  Dkt. No. 62 at 22.  Plaintiffs further assert that each named \n19  plaintiff is willing to perform the duties of a class representative, and to pursue this lawsuit \n20  vigorously on behalf of the class, and there is no basis on which to argue that their interests \n21  are antagonistic to those of the class.  Id. at 22-23.  There is no suggestion of collusion \n22  between the named plaintiffs and any of the defendants.  Id.  There are also no perceived \n23  conflicts with class counsel.  The Court finds that the named plaintiffs and their counsel will \n24  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n25  Further, the proposed class meets the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Plaintiffs claim \n26  that defendants treated the class members as a class, as defendants encircled, arrested, and \n27  imprisoned all of the class members in the same way, en masse, without making any \n28  individual determinations of probable cause.  Dkt. No. 62 at 24.  Whether this conduct \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   10    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 11 of 22\n \n1  violated the class membersโ legal rights is a common question of law and fact.  The legality \n2  of defendantsโ alleged failure to give the class members notice or opportunity to disperse, \n3  the mass arrest, the incarceration of the entire class in jail overnight, and the failure to \n4  provide the class members with basic sleeping accommodations are subject to common \n5  resolution.  Id.  Additionally, class counsel assert that the class membersโ damages are \n6  generally uniform and that there were few physical injuries and low medical bills.  See id. at \n7  26.  The common legal and fact questions represent a significant aspect of the case, and do \n8  not appear to be outweighed by any questions affecting only individual members.  See \n9  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1022 (โWhen common questions present a significant aspect of the \n10  case and they can be resolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication, there is \n11  clear justification for handling the dispute on a representative rather than on an individual \n12  basis.โ (quoting 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal \n13  Practice & Procedure ยง 1778 (2d ed. 1986)). \n14  Additionally, considerations of judicial economy favor litigating this case as a class \n15  action.  As this case involves multiple claims for relatively small sums, a class action is \n16  superior to an alternative method for adjudicating the partiesโ claims.  See \n17  Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 F.3d 1154, 1163 (9th Cir. \n18  2001) (โ[I]f plaintiffs cannot proceed as a class, some-perhaps most-will be unable to \n19  proceed as individuals because of the disparity between their litigation costs and what they \n20  hope to recover.โ).  According to the record provided, no potential class member has \n21  expressed a desire to proceed independently and no unusual obstacles have appeared that \n22  would make managing the class particularly difficult.   \n23  The Court finds that this action is maintainable under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n24  23(a) and (b)(3), and therefore, certifies the following class: the approximately 360 people \n25  who were arrested in the mass arrest on Broadway between 23rd and 24th Streets in \n26  Oakland on January 28, 2012, and who were never charged with any crime related to this \n27  arrest.  The Court further approves the named plaintiffs as class representatives, and \n28  approves Yolanda Huang and Dan Siegel as class counsel. \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   11    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 12 of 22\n \n1  B.  Preliminary Approval of the Settlement \n2  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) requires judicial approval of any settlement by \n3  a certified class.  Although there is a โstrong judicial policy that favors settlements, \n4  particularly where complex class action litigation is concerned,โ Linney v. Cellular Alaska \n5  Pโship, 151 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir. 1998), โ[t]he purpose of Rule 23(e) is to protect the \n6  unnamed members of the class from unjust or unfair settlements affecting their rights,โ In re \n7  Syncor ERISA Litig., 516 F.3d 1095, 1100 (9th Cir. 2008).  Accordingly, a settlement \n8  should only be approved if it is โfundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable.โ  Torrisi v. \n9  Tucson Elec. Power Co., 8 F.3d 1370, 1375 (9th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks \n10  omitted).  In determining whether the proposed settlement meets this standard, the Court \n11  does not have the ability โto delete, modify, or substitute certain provisions . . . . The \n12  settlement must stand or fall in its entirety.โ  Id.  Due to the dangers of collusion between \n13  class counsel and the defendant, as well as the need for additional protections when the \n14  settlement is not negotiated by a court designated class representative, settlement approval \n15  that takes place prior to formal class certification requires a higher standard of fairness.  \n16  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1026. \n17  โThe Court may grant preliminary approval of a settlement and direct notice to the \n18  class if the settlement: (1) appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive \n19  negotiations; (2) has no obvious deficiencies; (3) does not improperly grant preferential \n20  treatment to class representatives or segments of the class; and (4) falls within the range of \n21  possible approval.โ  Harris v. Vector Mktg. Corp., No. 08-cv-05198 EMC, 2011 WL \n22  1627973, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 29, 2011); In re Tableware Antitrust Litig., 484 F. Supp. 2d \n23  1078, 1079 (N.D. Cal. 2007).  The Court reviews the preliminary approval factors in turn. \n24  1.  The Settlement Process \n25  The Court first considers the means by which the parties reached their settlement.  \n26  Between January 2014 and the present, the parties have participated in four all day and two \n27  part-day settlement conferences, and a number of telephonic conferences, with Magistrate \n28  Judge Laurel Beeler.  Dkt. No. 63 at 4-5.  In addition, there have been numerous \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   12    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 13 of 22\n \n1  communications between the parties.  Id.  The Oakland City Council and the Alameda \n2  County Board of Supervisors have also had several reviews of the settlement before final \n3  approval in separate closed-session meetings.  Dkt. No. 63 at 8.  Class representatives were \n4  involved in all of the in-court settlement conferences.  Id.  The settlement thus appears to be \n5  the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations.  Accordingly, the process by \n6  which the parties reached their settlement weighs in favor of preliminary approval.   \n7  2.  The Presence of Obvious Deficiencies \n8  The Court must next analyze whether there are obvious deficiencies in the settlement \n9  agreement.  The Court previously denied preliminary approval of the original settlement \n10  agreement because of several deficiencies.  Dkt. No. 68.  The revised settlement agreement, \n11  Dkt. No. 70-1, has cured those deficiencies.   \n12  First, the original settlement agreement contained an error in the definition of the \n13  class, which has been corrected. \n14  Second, the scope of the release in the original settlement agreement was \n15  impermissibly broad as it did not specify who is being released.  While the scope of the \n16  release in the revised settlement agreement is still broad, it is acceptable because the claims \n17  released are limited to those โagainst the Defendants, their agents, and their employees \n18  arising from the events alleged in Plaintiffsโ Complaint.โ  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 10-11; see Hesse \n19  v. Sprint Corp., 598 F.3d 581, 590 (9th Cir. 2010) (โA settlement agreement may preclude a \n20  party from bringing a related claim in the future even though the claim was not presented \n21  and might not have been presentable in the class action, but only where the released claim is \n22  based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the settled class \n23  action.โ) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Additionally, the release has \n24  been revised so that it does not include claims by class members who have opted out.  \n25  Third, the original settlement agreement did not provide for a cy pres recipient or \n26  specify what would happen with the funds if a check is undeliverable or remains uncashed.  \n27  The revised settlement agreement names as a cy pres recipient Families With a Future, a \n28  project sponsored by Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, a non-profit based in San \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   13    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 14 of 22\n \n1  Francisco.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 8.  The designated cy pres recipient appears to meet the \n2  requirements for approval set forth in Dennis v. Kellogg Co., 697 F.3d 858, 865 (9th Cir. \n3  2012) (holding that there must be โa driving nexus between the plaintiff class and the cy \n4  pres beneficiariesโ and that the cy pres award must be โguided by (1) the objectives of the \n5  underlying statute(s) and (2) the interests of the silent class members, . . . , and must not \n6  benefit a group too remote from the plaintiff classโ).  At the preliminary approval hearing, \n7  class counsel explained that the major injuries in this case were the arrest and the \n8  incarceration, which affected the families of the class members.  Counsel further explained \n9  that Families With a Future was chosen as a cy pres recipient because it is dedicated to \n10  helping incarcerated people integrate in the society, and that while it is based in San \n11  Francisco, its geographic focus is Northern California, and the Bay Area in particular. \n12  Fourth, the original settlement agreement provided that class counsel โshallโ receive \n13  $350,000 for attorneysโ fees and costs and that the class representatives โshallโ each \n14  receive $9,000.  The revised settlement agreement clarifies that these amounts are subject \n15  to Court approval and that the Court may award a different amount than requested.  Dkt. \n16  No. 70-1 at 7.   \n17  While the Court is not approving the amount of the requested attorneysโ fees and \n18  costs at this stage, the Court also notes that the supplemental declaration of Yolanda Huang \n19  shows different numbers for the hours spent on the case for herself, Dan Siegel, and Claire \n20  Lacey, compared to the amounts in her first declaration submitted in support of preliminary \n21  approval (compare Dkt. No. 70 at 5 with Dkt. No. 63-1 at 2).  The supplemental declaration \n22  also has different amounts for the costs (actual and estimated) compared to the first \n23  declaration.  Id.  As part of plaintiffsโ motion for final approval, Yolanda Huang must \n24  provide an explanation for these discrepancies, and submit either her time records for her \n25  work on this case or a reasonably detailed breakdown of how many hours she spent on the \n26  different categories of activities.  Additionally, Yolanda Huang must provide a breakdown \n27  by category of the estimated costs of settlement administration to allow the Court to better \n28  assess their reasonableness.  Finally, Dan Siegelโs declaration, Dkt. No. 69 ยถ 23, states that \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   14    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 15 of 22\n \n1  two other attorneys devoted โsignificant timeโ to the case.  One of the attorneys, Anne \n2  Weills, is not included in the chart summarizing the total attorney hours, see Dkt. No. 70 at \n3  5.  Additionally, no information is provided on these two attorneysโ experience or how they \n4  spent the time billed on this case.  The motion for final approval must address these issues. \n5  Accordingly, the lack of obvious deficiencies in the revised settlement agreement \n6  weighs in favor of granting preliminary approval. \n7  3.  Preferential Treatment \n8  The third factor the Court considers is whether the settlement agreement provides \n9  preferential treatment to any class member.  Under the settlement, the monetary recovery \n10  will be distributed to class members who have submitted approved claims pro rata after \n11  deduction of the attorneysโ fees and costs and the class representativesโ awards.  Dkt. No. \n12  70-1 at 7.  Class counsel explained that the decision to apply a pro rata allocation was made \n13  unanimously by the named plaintiffs, and was the result of extensive discussion among \n14  plaintiffs in consultation with a number of class members.  Dkt. No. 70 ยถ 10.  Class counsel \n15  asserts that, after evaluating the injuries received through this incident, plaintiffs \n16  unanimously agreed that the overriding harm was the corralling, arrest, and incarceration.  \n17  Id.  Plaintiffs determined that while class members experienced a different length of time of \n18  incarceration, the amount of time was a secondary harm because everyone was held in \n19  similar conditions, namely overcrowded, filthy, cold, no access to phones, terrible food, \n20  lack of feminine hygiene supplies, and without space to sit or lie down.  Id.  Class counsel \n21  further explained that there were few physical injuries.  Dkt. No. 62 at 26.  Accordingly, the \n22  proposed distribution of the settlement funds does not appear to grant undue preferential \n23  treatment to any class members.      \n24  While the settlement agreement authorizes an incentive award to each of the eight \n25  class representatives of $9,000, this incentive award, should the Court finally approve it, \n26  does not render the settlement unfair, as โthe Ninth Circuit has recognized that service \n27  awards to named plaintiffs in a class action are permissible and do not render a settlement \n28  unfair or unreasonable.โ  Harris, 2011 WL 1627973, at *9 (citing Staton, 327 F.3d at 977).  \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   15    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 16 of 22\n \n1  Additionally, while the Court is not approving the amount of the incentive award at this \n2  stage, the Court notes that the proposed incentive awards here are on the high end but not \n3  outside the range of reasonableness.  See Spalding, No. 11-cv-02867 TEH, Dkt. Nos. 95-1, \n4  99 (approving $9,000 incentive award); Covillo v. Specialtys Cafe, No. 11-cv-00594 DMR, \n5  2014 WL 954516, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2014) (approving $8,000 incentive award); \n6  Barel v. Bank of Am., 255 F.R.D. 393, 402 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (approving $10,000 incentive \n7  award).  Class counsel asserts that the class representatives each had to give a full \n8  deposition, spent several long days in court during settlement conferences, and were in \n9  close touch with class members and class counsel throughout the nearly two and a half year \n10  process since the mass arrest.  Dkt. No. 63 at 8.  These assertions must be supported by a \n11  competent declaration at the final approval stage.   \n12  The Court finds no indication of unfair treatment to certain members of the class, and \n13  therefore this factor supports preliminary approval. \n14  4.  Whether the Settlement Falls Within the Range of Possible Approval \n15  Finally, the Court must determine whether the proposed settlement falls within the \n16  range of possible approval.  โTo evaluate the range of possible approval criterion, which \n17  focuses on substantive fairness and adequacy, courts primarily consider plaintiffโs expected \n18  recovery balanced against the value of the settlement offer.โ  Harris, 2011 WL 1627973, at \n19  *9 (quoting Vasquez v. Coast Valley Roofing, Inc., 670 F. Supp. 2d 1114, 1125 (E.D. Cal. \n20  2009)).  To determine whether an agreement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and \n21  reasonable, the Court may preview the factors that ultimately inform final approval: โ[1] the \n22  strength of plaintiffโs case; [2] the risk, expense, complexity, and likely duration of further \n23  litigation; [3] the risk of maintaining class action status throughout the trial; [4] the amount \n24  offered in settlement; [5] the extent of discovery completed, and the stage of the \n25  proceedings; [6] the experience and views of counsel; [7] the presence of a governmental \n26  participant; and [8] the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement.โ  Id. at *9 \n27  (citing Churchill Village v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004)).  As part of this \n28  assessment, the Court must โcompare the value of the settlement against the expected \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   16    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 17 of 22\n \n1  recovery at trialโ by estimating โthe maximum amount of damages recoverable in a \n2  successful litigation and compare that with the settlement amount.โ  Id. at *11 (internal \n3  quotation marks omitted).  The Court will address first the value of the settlement. \n4  a.  The Value of the Settlement Supports Preliminary Approval. \n5  Under the proposed settlement, class members who submit approved claims will \n6  receive an estimated payment of approximately $2,600.  Dkt. No. 63 at 7.  Class counsel \n7  notes that plaintiffs have not claimed special damages, such as wage loss or medical bills.  \n8  Id.  Class counsel calculated that the class was incarcerated as a whole for a total of \n9  approximately 13,500 hours.  Class counsel asserts that, using a possible damages rate of \n10  $250 an hour based on a comparison with other cases, the class could see a potential \n11  recovery of $3.375 million if the case proceeded to trial.  Based on these estimates, the \n12  recovery per class member under the settlement is approximately 28% of the estimated \n13  maximum recovery.  Dkt. No. 70 ยถ 11.  The settlement appears to provide for a fair amount \n14  of monetary recovery.  See Spalding, No. 11-cv-02867 TEH , Dkt. Nos. 99, 95-1, 97 \n15  (granting final approval of settlement including total monetary settlement of $1,025,000 for \n16  145-149 potential class members). \n17  In addition to the monetary benefits, the settlement provides for those class members \n18  who submit approved claims that their arrest records will be sealed and destroyed and that \n19  they will be provided with a stipulated finding of factual innocence, to eliminate any \n20  possible adverse effect of the arrest on employment or licensing.  Dkt. No. 63 at 7.   \n21  The Court finds that the proposed settlement confers substantial benefit on the class \n22  and that this factor supports preliminary approval. \n23  b.  The Remaining Factors Weigh in Favor of Preliminary Approval. \n24  Turning to the other factors informing settlement approval, such as the strength of \n25  plaintiffsโ case, the extent of discovery completed at this stage of the proceedings, the risk \n26  of maintaining class action status, and the risk, expense, and likely duration of the litigation, \n27  the Court finds that all weigh in favor of preliminary approval of the proposed settlement \n28  agreement.   \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   17    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 18 of 22\n \n1  Plaintiffs assert that it is not certain that they would prevail at trial in light of \n2  defendantsโ defenses concerning probable cause for plaintiffsโ arrests and their processing \n3  at Santa Rita.  Dkt. No. 70 ยถ 11.  Plaintiffs further assert that there is a substantial issue \n4  regarding whether the City defendants gave adequate notice to the class members regarding \n5  whether their assembly was unlawful before arresting them.  Id.  The City defendants have \n6  asserted that the professed purpose of the dayโs event was to illegally occupy a building and \n7  confront the police, and that the crowdโs failure to disperse from near 19th \n8  Avenue/Telegraph (Rashida Muhammad St.) justified the mass arrest.  Dkt. No. 62 at 9.  \n9  Additionally, there is a substantial issue here about whether the delay by the County in \n10  releasing the class members constitutes a constitutional violation.  Dkt. No. 70 ยถ 11.  \n11  Further litigation would involve considerable costs and a significant investment of time by \n12  plaintiffs, defendants, and their respective counsel, and would burden the resources of the \n13  Court.  Dkt. No. 63 at 7.  Plaintiffs and their counsel believe that the proposed settlement \n14  confers substantial benefits on the class and the general public, and that it is fair and \n15  reasonable and in the best interests of the class.  Id. at 5.  According to class counsel, the \n16  overwhelming response by the class members has been positive and no objections are \n17  anticipated.  Dkt. No. 63-1 ยถ 9. \n18  Because the balance of the factors considered by the Court weighs in favor of \n19  preliminary approval, the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is granted. \n20  C.  Class Notice \n21  1.  Method of Providing Notice \n22  The settlement agreement provides for mailing the notice to each class memberโs last \n23  known mailing address, posting the notice on the class action website, and disseminating \n24  information regarding the settlement agreement on social media.  Dkt. No. 70-1 at 10.  \n25  Class counsel assert that numerous class members have stayed in regular communication \n26  with class counsel since the date of the arrests and during the pendency of this litigation.  \n27  Dkt. No. 63-1 ยถยถ 6-7.  In addition, the class representatives have remained active and \n28  involved in community activities and maintained regular contact with many of the class \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   18    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 19 of 22\n \n1  members who are aware that a settlement is pending.  Id. ยถยถ 7, 9.      \n2  Class counsel and plaintiffs further assert that they have compiled a comprehensive \n3  and updated contact list for class members, many of whom have provided phone numbers \n4  and email addresses.  Dkt. No. 63-1 ยถ 8.  According to class counsel, many social media \n5  platforms are in place to disseminate the notice and information about this litigation.  Id.  \n6  Class counsel also informed the Court that the class action website has been made live, and \n7  that the website requests that potential class members email class counsel with their names, \n8  current mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.  Dkt. No. 70 ยถ 6.  At the \n9  hearing, class counsel stated that she had mailing addresses for everyone and had received \n10  updated addresses from approximately 130 class members. \n11  The Court approves the method of notice provided in the settlement agreement, and in \n12  addition, the Court orders that the notice be disseminated by email, to the extent email \n13  addresses are available to class counsel.  The Court finds that the method of notice so \n14  ordered provides the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances.  See Fed. R. \n15  Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). \n16  2.  Contents of the Notice \n17  As to the contents of the notice to the class, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n18  Procedure requires that โ[t]he notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily \n19  understood language: (i) the nature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class certified; (iii) \n20  the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class member may enter an appearance \n21  through an attorney if the member so desires; (v) that the court will exclude from the class \n22  any member who requests exclusion; (vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion; and \n23  (vii) the binding effect of a class judgment on members under Rule 23(c)(3).โ  Fed. R. Civ. \n24  P. 23(c)(2)(B).   \n25  Here, the proposed class notice, Dkt. No. 70-2, describes the nature of the action, the \n26  definition of the class, and the class-wide claims.  The proposed notice further explains that \n27  class members may appear through an attorney and that the Court will exclude those \n28  members requesting exclusion.  The notice also specifies the time requirements and manner \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   19    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 20 of 22\n \n1  of requesting exclusion, as well as the binding effect of a class-wide judgment.  In addition, \n2  the notice explains that class members may object, indicates the time and place of the final \n3  approval hearing, provides information regarding the attorneysโ fees and class \n4  representativesโ incentive awards, and indicates that additional information regarding the \n5  settlement is available through class counsel, whose contact information is provided in the \n6  notice.  The notice also explains how the settlement fund will be allocated, and points to the \n7  website that contains additional information about this case and the settlement.   \n8  However, the proposed notice contains the following deficiencies: \n9  1.  The proposed class notice contains references to page numbers but there are no \n10  page numbers on the document filed with the Court, Dkt. No. 70-2. \n11  2.  Option 5 โObject to the Settlementโ under โYOUR CHOICES,โ must be \n12  capitalized to be consistent with the other options.  Dkt. No. 70-2 at 2. \n13  3.  The definition of the class in the proposed notice must be consistent with the \n14  definition of the class certified by the Court.  For example, sections 7 and 9 of the proposed \n15  notice under โWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT?,โ fail to refer to the precise location of the \n16  arrest as defined in the class definition, i.e., โon Broadway between 23rd and 24th Streets in \n17  Oakland.โ  Dkt. No. 70-2 at 7. \n18  4.  Section 10 of the proposed notice, under โTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS โ \n19  WHAT YOU GET,โ states that the class representatives and class counsel โwillโ receive \n20  certain amounts from the total settlement.  Dkt. No. 70-2 at 7.  This section must be revised \n21  to clarify that these are proposed amounts subject to the approval of the Court.  \n22  Additionally, the same section must be revised to add the following (addition noted in \n23  italics): โThe exact amount of money you will receive depends on the number of timely \n24  valid claims received and the amounts approved by Court for attorneysโ fees and costs and \n25  class representativesโ incentive awards.โ  Id. \n26  5.  Section 13 of the proposed notice, under โWHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS?,โ \n27  must explicitly inform the class members of the scope of the class release as provided in the \n28 \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   20    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 21 of 22\n \n1  settlement agreement, rather than merely refer to the settlement agreement.  Dkt. No. 70-2 \n2  at 9. \n3  6.  The proposed notice is confusing as to what is required to object to the \n4  settlement.  Option 5 โObject to the Settlementโ under โYOUR CHOICES,โ states that a \n5  class member may โeitherโ write โorโ speak to the Court.  Dkt. No. 70-2 at 2.  By contrast, \n6  section 17 states โTo object, you must send a letter . . . .โ  Id. at 10.  Additionally, section 18 \n7  states that a class member โmayโ ask the Court by letter for permission to speak at the final \n8  approval hearing but does not make clear whether such letter is required in order for a class \n9  member to speak at the hearing.  Id. at 11.  Section 18 of the proposed notice also \n10  erroneously cross-references section 14 instead of section 17.  The notice must be revised to \n11  clarify the class membersโ options and what is required to object. \n12  7.  Sections 15 and 16 of the proposed notice, under โWHAT ARE YOUR \n13  OPTIONS?,โ erroneously refer to โExclusion Claim Form.โ  Dkt. No. 70-2 at 9-10.  These \n14  sections must be revised to clarify that there are two separate formsโan โExclusion Formโ \n15  and a โClaim Form.โ \n16  8.  The Exclusion Form erroneously directs class members to mail it to the Court \n17  instead of class counsel (compare to section 15 of the proposed class notice).  Dkt. No. 70-2 \n18  at 12. \n19  9.  The proposed notice misspells the undersigned Magistrate Judgeโs name.  Dkt. \n20  No. 70-2 at 4, 11. \n21  IV. CONCLUSION \n22  The Court certifies the proposed class, grants preliminary approval of the revised \n23  settlement agreement, and approves the proposed method of notice.  The Court also \n24  approves the proposed class counsel and class representatives.   \n25  Class counsel must file a second revised proposed notice, claim form, and exclusion \n26  form correcting the above deficiencies by January 12, 2015.  The date of the preliminary \n27  approval of the settlement will be deemed to be the date on which the Court issues an order \n28  approving the proposed form of notice.  \nCase No. 13-cv-00190 NC \nORDER GRANTING CERTIFICATION   21    \nAND PRELIMINARY APPROVAL\n \n \n\nCase 3:13-cv-00190-NC   Document 72   Filed 01/05/15   Page 22 of 22\n \n11  Pllaintiffsโ mootion for finnal approvaal, and any ssupplementtal filings inn support off the \n22  requesteed incentivee awards annd attorneysโ fees and ccosts, must be filed witthin 14 dayys of \n33  the date on which tthe notice iss disseminated to the cclass membeers as proviided in the \n44  settlemeent agreemeent.

MORGADO, and KERRY  JACKSON, \n11 \n(hereinafter โCOUNTY DEFENDANTSโ); by and through their respective counsel, agree \n12 \nand stipulate as follows: \n13 \nI.  THE LITIGATION \n14 \n  On January 14, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against the City of \n15 \nOakland and a number of Oakland police officers, and against the County of Alameda, its \n16 \nSheriff, and senior deputies of the Sheriffโs Office, asserting violations of their First, Fourth, \n17  and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and their rights under California state law, arising from a \n18  mass arrest which occurred on January 28, 2012.  Approximately 360 Class Members were \n19  engaged in a march and demonstration protesting the economic inequalities and the financial \n20  disparities between the 99% and the 1%.  Three hundred and sixty (360) Class Members were \n21  arrested on Broadway between 23rd and 24th Streets.  Plaintiffs allege that the arrests were \n22  conducted without a dispersal order first having been given at that location or an opportunity \n23  to disperse.  Plaintiffs allege that the mass arrests were violations of Oaklandโs own Crowd \n24  Control Policies in addition to being violations of federal and state constitutional protections \n25  and state laws.  Defendants deny the allegations. \n26    Following the arrests by the Oakland Police, class members were handcuffed, detained \n27  on the streets, placed in the custody of the Alameda County Sheriffโs Office, and transported \n28  to Alameda County jails, where, they contend, they were held for between 12 and 80 hours \n \nPage 2 of 13  \nAngell, et al. v. City of Oakland, et al.   \nSettlement Agreement \n             \n  \n \n\n \nbefore being cited and released for failure to disperse in violation of California Penal Code \n1 \n409, a misdemeanor.  Plaintiffs contend the booking and detention violated California state \n2 \nlaw providing for the citation and release of misdemeanor arrestees, as well as the First, \n3 \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiffs also contend that while on the street and \n4 \nduring transport, they were painfully restrained by plastic handcuffs, and not given access to \n5 \ntoilet facilities.  They further contend that they were held in severely overcrowded and \n6 \nunsanitary holding cells that were cold, lacked adequate seating, had no beds or bedding, and \n7 \nlacked telephones.  While held in jail, Class Members were unable to contact family or \n8 \nfriends, many for up to 24 hours rather than the 3 hours required by Penal Code ยง851.5.  \n9 \nDefendants deny these allegations. \n10 \n  Plaintiffs requested monetary damages, attorneysโ fees and costs, an injunction to \n11 \nprevent defendants from continuing to violate Plaintiffsโ rights, and an order requiring \n12 \nDefendants to seal and destroy all records derived from this arrest.  (Class Action Complaint \n13 \nDocket No. 1.) \n14 \n  While this case was pending, the case of Spalding v. City of Oakland, C11-02867, \n15 \nresolved.  The Spalding case was also a class action arising out of mass arrest involving the \n16 \nCity of Oakland and the County of Alameda Sheriffโs Offices.  Part of the resolution of \n17 \nSpalding included injunctive relief primarily on the application of Cite/Release and Booking \n18 \nProcedures that will be applied in multiple simultaneous arrest situations, which addressed \n19 \nand resolved the injunctive relief issues raised in plaintiffsโ complaint.  The resolutions \n20 \nincluded amendment of the Oakland Police Departmentโs Crowd Control and Crowd \n21 \nManagement Policy, adopted on October 4, 2013.1 \n22 \n                                                                    \n23  1 VIII. CITE/RELEASE AND BOOKING PROCEDURES  \nA. Individuals arrested for minor offenses may be cited and released in compliance with Penal Code ยง853.6 \n24 \nand Department General Order M-7, CITATIONS FOR ADULT MISDEMEANORS, Part III, A-N.  \nB. When it is impractical to cite arrestees at or near the site of the demonstration because of a substantial risk \n25 \nthat this procedure would allow the unlawful activity to continue or because of specific geographic factors, \n26  officers may cite and release arrestees from temporary processing stations or police facilities as near the site of \nthe arrest as possible. While detained during the citation and release process, arrestees shall have reasonable \n27  access to toilet facilities and to appropriate medical attention.  \nC. No fingerprinting will be done as part of the citation and release process. Arrestees may be instructed to \n28 \nappear for booking prior to or after arraignment.  \n  OPD Training Bulletin III-G, CROWD CONTROL AND CROWD MANAGEMENT POLICY (Rev. 28 Oct 05),  \n \nPage 3 of 13  \nAngell, et al. v.
