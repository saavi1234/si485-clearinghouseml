    "summary": "<p>This complaint was filed on July 23, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The suit was filed by a number of political and legal organizations, as well as a news media organization. These groups included: Black Lives Matter Chicago; Black Abolitionist Network; Chicago Democratic Socialists of America; Good Kids/Mad City; #LetUsBreathe Collective; South Siders Organized for Unity and Liberation; National Lawyers Guild Chicago; First Defense Legal Aid; and In These Times. The defendants were numerous federal agents, including Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Deputy Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Matthew Albence, Attorney General William Barr, Director of Federal Protective Services L. Eric Patterson, and FBI Director Christopher Wray, among others. Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel and attorneys from Westside Justice Center, People's Law Office, as well as attorney-professors at Northwestern and University of Chicago. </p><p>The lawsuit followed the dispersal of federal agents to quell protests that occurred in Chicago after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the spring of 2020. President Trump first sent federal agents to Portland in July, then to several other cities including Chicago later that month. The complaint did not allege that the federal troops had done anything in particular, but that their very presence was menacing. They argued that the presence of these federal agents represented violations of the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights to free speech and free protest as well as excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. They also alleged conspiracy to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights. The plaintiffs requested declaratory relief that would deem the federal agents' actions illegal and injunctive relief prohibiting the policing of the protests by federal agents, ceasing the arrest of residents of Chicago, and to stop enforcing a policy of alleged \"preemptive arrests.\"</p><p>On July 31, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint which added a count of violating the Tenth Amendment. They argued that the federal agents' conducting of law enforcement was an encroachment on the policing powers left to the state and local government. </p><p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a claim on October 2. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the plaintiffs' alleged injuries that took place in other cities and statements by the President, Attorney General, and Acting Secretary of DHS, but failed to allege particular and concrete injuries their organizations in Chicago. In addition, even if the plaintiffs had standing, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the Tenth Amendment because the plaintiffs did not cite that a specific federal law violated the Tenth Amendment or adequately allege the federal defendants encroached on a specific power reserved to the states.</p><p>On January 21, 2021, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice. The plaintiffs' claims were based on the Trump administration's alleged animus against Black Lives Matter and other groups protesting for racial justice. When Joe Biden was elected President, the change in administration mooted the plaintiffs' claims. The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This is a lawsuit brought by several black activist groups, legal organizations, and news media outlets, against the heads of various federal agencies, including the DHS, ICE, Federal Protective Services, and the DOJ. They argued that the deployment to Chicago of these federal agencies by President Trump during the protests that ensued after the police killing of George Floyd were unlawful and unconstitutional. They argued that the defendants violated the First, Fourth, and Tenth Amendments by using these agents, and that they were in conspiracy to deprive Chicago residents of their rights. When Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as President, the change in administration mooted the case. It was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs in January 2021.",

(Or at least that is what they feared when this case was filed two months ago.)  This \nfear was not based on events in Chicago, but rather on events in Portland, where plaintiffs allege \nfederal agents deployed to protect federal property violated the constitutional rights of other \nprotestors in Portland.  Plaintiffs’ fears have not been realized; not only have plaintiffs here not \nsuffered any injury, but they cite nothing to suggest injury is likely.  Plaintiffs’ own allegations \nand referenced documents show that the federal agents most recently deployed to Chicago were \nsent to work with local law enforcement to fight the rise in violent gun and gang crime pursuant to \na federal law enforcement initiative called Operation LeGend, which by design is not directed at \npolicing protesters or protecting federal property.  Because plaintiffs’ fear of future injury is at \nbest speculative, they have no standing to pursue their claims in this case.  Even if they had \nstanding, plaintiffs’ Tenth Amendment claim should still be dismissed for failure to state a claim. \n1 \n \n\nBackground \n \nI.  The Situation in Portland \n \n   Protests against racial injustice and police brutality have occurred in cities across the \nUnited States after George Floyd’s tragic death on May 25, 2020.  Am. Complt. ¶¶ 32-33.  In \nPortland, Oregon, riots associated with these protests resulted in vandalism, property destruction, \nattacks on law enforcement officers, attempted arson, and related acts of violence in connection \nwith federal buildings and property.  See Index Newspapers LLC, et al. v. U.S. Marshals Service, \net al, 2020 WL 4883017, *14 (D. Or. Aug. 20, 2020); July 16, 2020 Memo to DHS Acting \nSecretary Chad Wolf at 1 (“7/16/20 DHS Memo”).1  In early July 2020, for example, some of the \nrioters in Portland broke the glass doors at the entryway of the Hatfield Federal Courthouse in \nPortland.  Id.  On other nights in July, rocks and other objects were thrown at federal agents \nprotecting the courthouse, and on one occasion certain rioters attempted to start a fire inside the \nHatfield Federal Courthouse.  Id.  \n   In response to this damage to federal property and these assaults on federal officers, the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as well as the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) \ndeployed specialized tactical teams to provide support in protecting the federal courthouse and \nother  federal  property  in  Portland.    Am.  Complt.  ¶¶ 78-79,  83;  7/16/20  DHS  Memo  at  1.  \nAccording to plaintiffs’ amended complaint, these federal agents approached protesters in Portland \nby using unmarked vehicles and dressed in camouflage uniforms that failed to identify themselves \n                                                 \n1  This document, 7/16/20 DHS Memo, is cited in the amended complaint at ¶ 78, and \nattached hereto as Exhibit 1.  See Citadel Group Ltd. V. Washington Reg’l Med. Ctr., 692 F.3d \n580, 591-92 (7th Cir. 2012) (“In deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim [courts] \nmay consider documents attached to or referenced in the pleading if they are central to the claim.”).  \n2 \n \n\nas federal agents.  Am. Complt. ¶¶ 68, 81.  Plaintiffs further allege that federal agents (again, in \nPortland) engaged in unlawful police tactics against protesters, journalists, and legal observers \nbased on their viewpoint, including (1) unlawfully arresting them without probable cause, (2) \nconducting unlawful domestic surveillance against them, and (3) trying to silence and interfere \nwith protesters through intimidation and force.  Id., ¶¶ 70-74, 91- 128.   \n   Oregon’s governor and Portland’s mayor requested the removal of federal agents from \nPortland.  Am. Complt. ¶ 90.  Oregon’s Attorney General filed a federal lawsuit on July 17, 2020, \nseeking to enjoin federal agents from engaging in this alleged unlawful conduct.  Am. Complt. \n¶ 89; Rosenblum v. Does 1-10, 2020 WL 4253209 (D. Or. July 24, 2020).2  Several other lawsuits \nwere filed in Portland, challenging conduct by federal agents surrounding the protests.  Protesters \nin Wise v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-1193 (D. Or.), sued DHS, alleging their treatment of \nplaintiffs during protests in Portland was unlawful.  Anti-police organizations in Western States \nCenter, Inc. v. DHS, No. 3:20-cv-1175 (D. Or.), sued DHS and USMS, alleging that federal law \nenforcement in Portland violated the First, Fourth, and Tenth Amendments.  Members of the press \nand legal observers in Index Newspapers LLC v. City of Portland, et al., No. 3:20-cv-1035-SI (D. \nOr.), sued the City of Portland, DHS, and USMS, challenging their treatment of plaintiffs during \nprotests as unlawful.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n  2  The district court in Portland denied the Oregon Attorney General’s motion for a \ntemporary restraining order on standing grounds, Rosenblum, 2020 WL 4253209, and plaintiff \nsubsequently dismissed the case.     \n3 \n \n\nII.  The Situation in Chicago \n   Meanwhile, on July 20, 2020, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot sent a letter to President \nTrump regarding federal resources needed to reduce gun violence in Chicago.  Am. Complt. \n¶¶ 156, 158; Lightfoot July 20, 2020 Letter to President Trump, at p. 1 (“7/20/20 Lightfoot \nLetter”).3  Regarding law enforcement assistance, Mayor Lightfoot stated that Chicago does not \nwant any deployment of secret federal agents who arrest without cause, as had allegedly occurred \nin Portland.  Id. at 2.  Instead, Mayor Lightfoot requested more federal “investigatory resources to \naugment existing federal violent crime suppression efforts, under the leadership and control of the \nU.S. Attorney” and explained that “[g]iven the urgency of the gun violence,” Chicago needs \nfederal violent crime and particularly gun cases investigated and prosecuted.  Id.  Two days later, \non July 22, Mayor Lightfoot announced that she had spoken with President Trump about the \ndeployment of federal agents to Chicago and that they reached an understanding about such a \ndeployment.  Am. Complt. ¶ 162.  \n   That same day, President Trump and law enforcement officials announced a federal law \nenforcement initiative called Operation LeGend,4 whereby the federal government provides crime \nfighting resources to Chicago (and other cities) that are experiencing a significant rise in violent \ncrime.  Am. Complt. ¶ 129; 7/22/20 Press Conference Transcript, “Remarks by President Trump \non Operation LeGend” (“7/22/20 Press Conference Transcript”).5  During this press conference, \n                                                 \n3  7/20/20 Lightfoot Letter is cited in the amended complaint at ¶ 158 and is attached as \nExhibit 2.  \n            4 Operation LeGend is named in honor of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot \nand killed in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 29, 2020. \n5  This July 22, 2020 press conference is cited in the amended complaint at ¶¶ 129,138-40, \nand the 7/22/20 Press Conference Transcript is attached as Exhibit 3.  \n4 \n \n\nPresident Trump explained that Operation LeGend had already been used successfully in Kansas \nCity and was being expanded to Chicago and Albuquerque due to the rise in violent crime in those \ncities.  Id. at 4-5.  President Trump explained that in Chicago, for example, 1,900 people had \nalready been shot this year and 414 had been murdered, which is a 50 percent increase over last \nyear.    Id. at 2. \n   Attorney General William Barr and Acting Secretary of DHS Chad Wolf explained that \nOperation LeGend is aimed at protecting people from violent crime and that it is obviously a \ndifferent type of operation than the tactical teams used to defend federal property against rioters in \nPortland.  7/22/20 Press Conference Transcript at 7, 9.6  Federal agents deployed under Operation \nLeGend are augmenting their longstanding crime fighting activities where federal investigators \nwork jointly with state and local police to solve murders and take down violent gangs.  Id. at 7-8.  \nAs it relates to Chicago, Operation LeGend committed 200 federal agents from the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms, and Explosives (ATF), USMS, and DHS to expand Chicago’s existing violent crime \ntask forces.  Linked to the increase in federal law enforcement officers under Operation LeGend, \nthe  United  States  also  provides  $61  million  in  financial  assistance  to  state  and  local  law \nenforcement for expenses they incur in connection with these federal task force operations.  Id. at \n5, 8.  \n                                                 \n6  The deployment of federal agents in Portland was under Operation Diligent Valor, not \nOperation LeGend.  See Index Newspapers, 2020 WL 4883017 at *12, *15 n.6. \n5 \n \n\nIII.  Federal Law Enforcement Agencies \nLaw enforcement agents with the Department  of Homeland Security  as well as the \nDepartment of Justice are authorized by Congress to engage in a variety of federal law enforcement \nactivities, which include both the protection of federal property as well as the enforcement of \nfederal  criminal  laws  relating  to  violent  crimes.    The  Federal  Protective  Service  (FPS),  a \ncomponent of the DHS, is the federal agency charged with protecting federal facilities.  See Federal \nProtective Service Operation, at https://www.dhs.gov/fps-operations.  Congress authorized DHS \nto “protect the buildings, grounds, and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the Federal \nGovernment.”  40 U.S.C. § 1315(a).  While engaged in their duties, FPS officers are authorized to \nconduct a wide range of law enforcement functions, including carrying firearms, issuing warrants \nand subpoenas, conducting investigations on and off the federal property in question, making \narrests,  and  enforcing  federal  laws  for  the  protection  of  persons  and  property.    40  U.S.C. \n§ 1315(b)(2).  The Secretary of DHS may also designate DHS employees “as officers and agents \nfor  duty  in  connection  with  the  protection  of  property  owned  or  occupied  by  the  Federal \nGovernment and persons on the property, including duty in areas outside the property to the extent \nnecessary to protect the property and persons on the property.” 40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(1).     \n  Federal law enforcement agencies within DOJ, including the DEA, ATF, FBI, and USMS, \nas well as DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) are authorized to enforce a variety of \nfederal criminal laws relating to violent crime.  The FBI is the primary law enforcement agency \nfor the United States and has authority to gather intelligence and to investigate federal crimes in \n200 categories, including violent crime areas of gangs, narcotics, organized crime, robberies, \nkidnapping, and motor vehicle theft.  28 U.S.C. § 533; see https://www.fbi.gov/investigate.  The \n6 \n \n\nDEA has specific authority to investigate drug trafficking and distribution under the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 13, et al.  See https://admin.dea.gov/mission.  ATF has authority to \ninvestigate federal crimes for illegal use, possession, and transfer of firearms under the Gun \nControl Act, 18 U.S.C., Chapter 44 and the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C., Chapter 53.  USMS \nis the enforcement arm of the federal courts and is responsible for protecting the federal judiciary, \napprehending federal fugitives, managing and selling seized assets, and housing and transporting \nfederal prisoners.  28 U.S.C. § 566; 31 U.S.C. § 41503; 28 C.F.R. § 0.111.  HSI investigates and \nenforces  laws  related  to  cross-border  criminal  activity,  including  narcotics  and  weapons \nsmuggling/trafficking, human smuggling, and transnational gang activity.  See 19 U.S.C. § 1589a; \n8 U.S.C. § 1357; https://www.ice.gov/hsi.  In enforcing these laws, federal agents regularly \ncooperate with state and local law enforcement officials, which often takes the form of joint task \nforces in which federal agents work with state and local officials to fight crime committed under \nfederal laws.  See, e.g., https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/gangs; 28 U.S.C. § 566; 28 \nC.F.R. § 0.111.  \nIV.  Amended Complaint \n   Plaintiffs in this action are a group of organizations that have been and will continue to be \ninvolved in Chicago protests against police violence and systemic racism, stemming from George \nFloyd’s  death  (“Chicago  Protests”).    Am.  Complt.  ¶¶ 4,  34-38.    Plaintiffs  include  (1)  six \norganizations  whose  members  regularly  plan  and  participate  in  Chicago  Protests;7  (2)  two \n                                                 \n7  These plaintiffs include (1) Black Lives Matter Chicago (BLM), (2) Black Abolitionist \nNetwork (BAN), (3) Chicago Democratic Socialists of America (CDSA), (4) Good Kids/Mad City \n(GKMC), (5) #Letusbreathe Collective, and (6) South Siders Organized for Unity and Liberation \n(SOUL). \n7 \n \n\norganizations whose members provide legal support and observers for those engaged in Chicago \nProtests;8 and (3) one organization, In These Times (ITT), that operates a magazine and provides \njournalism coverage for Chicago Protests.  Id., ¶¶ 10-18.  Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of \nthemselves and their members and assert claims against various federal law enforcement agencies \nwithin DHS and DOJ that have deployed federal agents to Chicago as well as unknown officers of \nthe United States.  Id., ¶¶ 20-31.9  \n   Based on the events in Portland, plaintiffs feared that the federal agents recently deployed \nto Chicago to fight gun and gang violence would instead be used to intimidate, physically abuse, \nand unlawfully arrest peaceful protesters in Chicago, similar to what they allege to have occurred \nin Portland.  Plaintiffs do not allege that any illegal federal law enforcement conduct has already \noccurred in Chicago, but claim that if it does, their members may be subject to such unlawful \nconduct and the organizations may have to divert resources to address it.  Am. Complt. ¶¶ 10-18.  \nOther than this generalized fear of future harm, plaintiffs allege that one organization, National \nLawyers Guild, has already diverted resources in order to distribute “Know Your Rights” fliers \ndue to protester inquiries about encountering federal agents at protests.  Am. Complt. ¶¶ 178-79.  \nAdditionally, in the original complaint filed on July 23, 2020, plaintiffs alleged that due to \ndeployment of federal agents to Chicago, certain BLM members would not be attending protest \nactivity planned for the upcoming weekend of July 24-26.  Complt. ¶ 142.  In the amended \n                                                 \n8  These plaintiffs include (1) National Lawyers Guild Chicago (NLG Chicago); and (2) \nFirst Defense Legal Aid (FDLA).   \n  9  In addition to DOJ and DHS, additional defendants include investigative arms within \nDOJ (FBI, DEA, ATF, and USMS), as well as components within DHS (HSI, ICE, CBP, and FPS).  \nAm. Complt. ¶¶ 20-30. \n8 \n \n\ncomplaint filed a week later on July 31, however, plaintiffs note only that their members engaged \nin the protests of July 24-26, but do not allege that any members refused to participate because of \nfear of federal agents or that anyone encountered any problems at all from federal law enforcement \nofficers.10 \n   Based on these allegations, plaintiffs assert three constitutional claims.  First, plaintiffs \nallege that their members have a “well-founded fear” that the federal agents deployed to Chicago \non July 22 were going to brutalize and kidnap plaintiffs’ members for no reason other than \nengaging in protected First Amendment activity.  As a result, plaintiffs claim that their First \nAmendment rights to speak, assemble, petition, and gather news are being chilled and will be \nviolated in the future if federal agents engage in misconduct.  Am. Complt. Ct. I.  Second, plaintiffs \nclaim that in the absence of an injunction, federal agents deployed to Chicago will unlawfully \narrest and seize plaintiffs’ members in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Am. Complt. Ct. II.  \nThird, plaintiffs allege that the federal agents deployed to Chicago will be conducting “traditional \nlaw enforcement activities on the streets and sidewalks of Chicago” and thus will be encroaching \nupon powers explicitly reserved to the State of Illinois in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  Am. \nComplt. Ct. V.  For relief, plaintiffs seek only  equitable relief, including declarations that \ndefendants’ actions infringe on plaintiffs’ First and Fourth Amendment rights and a permanent \ninjunction, prohibiting defendants from engaging in unconstitutional conduct.  \n \n                                                 \n  10  Instead, plaintiffs simply repeat in the amended complaint the same allegation from \nthe original complaint that certain BLM members will not “attend the protests and rallies planned \nfor this weekend because they fear federal agents will kidnap, falsely arrest, or physically abuse \nthem, as they did to protestors in Portland.”  Compare Complt. ¶ 142 with Am. Complt. ¶ 176.   \n9 \n \n\nArgument \n  The protests that have taken place in recent months here in Chicago and throughout the \ncountry touch on matters of great concern to many Americans, and it is vital to our democracy that \nFirst Amendment rights of all Americans be respected.  But in this case, plaintiffs have alleged \nthat by taking part in protests here in Chicago, they are afraid they might be subject to an injury at \nsome undetermined time in the future based on reports of what has happened in Portland.  The \nConstitution requires more than that to make out a claim in federal court.  The plaintiffs have failed \nto meet their burden at this stage in the litigation to plead a case that shows injury in fact, and for \nthis reason their case should be dismissed.  Even if plaintiffs adequately were able to allege injury \nin fact for purposes of standing, their Tenth Amendment claim should be dismissed for failure to \nstate a claim.    \nI.   Plaintiffs Lack Article III Standing.   \n  A.   Plaintiffs’ Complaint Fails to Allege an Injury in Fact. \nPlaintiffs’ complaint contains a great deal of speculation about what injury might befall the \nmembers of the various plaintiff organizations, but nowhere does the complaint allege the kind of \nconcrete, particularized injury that is necessary to establish standing under Article III.  The \nquestion of standing is, in essence, “whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the \nmerits of the dispute or of particular issues.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975); Lac Du \nFlambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Norton, 422 F.3d 490, 495 (7th Cir. 2005).  \nAs such, the doctrine of standing “is an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy \nrequirement of Article III.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The \n“irreducible constitutional minimum” of standing contains three elements: an injury in fact; a \n10 \n \n\ncausal link between the injury and the challenged action such that the challenged conduct is fairly \ntraceable to the defendant; and redressability through a favorable court decision.  Id. at 560-61 \n(1992); Lopez-Aguilar v. Marion Cty. Sheriff’s Dept., 924 F.3d 375, 384-85 (7th Cir. 2019).  In \ncases such as this one where the plaintiffs are associations or civic groups, an association has \nstanding to represent the interests of its members if the individual members would have standing \nin their own right; the interests represented are germane to the association’s purpose; and the relief \nsought does not require the participation of the individual members.  Tex. Indep. Prod. And Royalty \nOwners Assoc. v. Env’l Prot. Agency, 410 F.3d 964, 971 (7th Cir. 2005); Speech First, Inc. v. \nKileen, 968 F.3d 628, 638 (7th Cir. 2020).  At all times, it remains the plaintiffs’ burden to establish \nthe elements of standing where the plaintiff is the party invoking federal jurisdiction over the \nalleged case or controversy.  Doe v. County of Montgomery, Ill., 41 F.3d 1156, 1159 (7th Cir. \n1994). \nHere, plaintiffs’ amended complaint fails to allege an injury in fact that satisfies the first \nrequirement of Article III standing.  An “injury in fact” is an “invasion of a legally-protected \ninterest which is (1) concrete and particularized, that is, affecting the plaintiff in a personal and \nindividual way and (2) actual or imminent and not merely conjectural or hypothetical.”  Id. (citing \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561); see also Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 416 (2013) (the \n“threatened injury must be certainly impending” and not merely “possible”); Speech First, Inc., \n968 F.3d at 638.  The requirement that the injury be “particularized” means that a plaintiff cannot \nsimply “raise only a generally available grievance about the government.”  Lac Du Flambeau, 422 \nF.3d at 496.  Where the plaintiff “claims only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper \napplication of the Constitution and laws, and [seeks] relief that no more directly and tangibly \n11 \n \n\nbenefits him than it does the public at large,” the plaintiff fails to state an Article III case or \ncontroversy.  Id.   \nSuch is the case with plaintiffs here.  The amended complaint contains multiple allegations \nof events that occurred in other cities and of statements made by the President, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the Acting Secretary of DHS, Am. Complt. ¶¶ 130-135, but alleges no injury that is \nparticular and concrete with regard to the plaintiff organizations’ members in this city.  Rather, \nby merely detailing events in the national news and quotes from high-level government officials, \nplaintiffs’  amended  complaint  simply  alleges  “the  psychological  consequence  presumably \nproduced by observation of conduct with which one disagrees.”  Doe, 41 F.3d 1156 at 1159.  Such \nclaims fall well short of the case or controversy standard. \nThe Supreme Court case City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), is instructive.  \nIn Lyons, the plaintiff sought declaratory relief and an injunction barring the City of Los Angeles \nfrom violating his civil rights based on allegations that members of the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment had previously used illegal chokeholds to restrain the defendant.  Id. at 98.  The Court, \nrelying on precedent, held that “past exposure to illegal conduct does not itself show a present case \nor controversy regarding injunctive relief if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse \neffects.”  Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102 (citing O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96 (1974)).  The \nsimple assertion that the plaintiff in Lyons might again be subject to an illegal chokehold did not \ncreate the actual controversy that must exist for a declaratory judgment to be entered.  Id. at 104.  \nIn order to establish an actual controversy in the case, the plaintiff in Lyons needed to allege either \nthat all Los Angeles police officers always apply chokeholds to any citizen they encounter, or that \nthe City had explicitly ordered or authorized such behavior.  Even an official policy that simply \n12 \n \n\nallowed for the challenged conduct is insufficient.  Mere instances of past misconduct did not \nestablish a right to declaratory relief.  Id. at 106.   \nThe claims in this case fare no better.  Here, plaintiffs are not even alleging that they \npreviously suffered a discrete, concrete injury (such as the chokehold in Lyons).  Rather, they \nallege that other individuals in another city have suffered some particular injury, and for that \nreason plaintiffs are afraid they might suffer a similar fate at some abstract point in the future.  \nPlaintiffs’ alleged threat of injury is even more speculative, given the different circumstances \npresented in Portland and Chicago.  Plaintiffs do not allege that federal property in Chicago has \ncome under attack or that federal agents have been deployed to Chicago to protect federal property \nand patrol protesters.  Rather, the complete statements of federal officials that plaintiffs selectively \ncite in their amended complaint make clear that federal agents have been deployed to Chicago to \naugment their longstanding work in fighting violent gun and gang crime in Chicago (in other \nwords, more of the same).  Plaintiffs have no present injury of their own that can be remedied by \nthis court, and any future injury they might suffer is purely hypothetical.  Thus, the prayer for relief \nin this case — which seeks only injunctive and declaratory relief — is attempting to remedy an \nabstract injury that simply does not exist and at this point cannot be credibly alleged.  See id. at \n105; Robinson v. City of Chicago, 868 F.2d 959, 967 (7th Cir. 1989) (applying the rule in Lyons \nand holding that, “plaintiffs cannot show irreparable injury precisely because they cannot show a \nreal or immediate threat that they will be wronged again, while any previous injury can be . . . \ncompensated for by damages”).11   \n                                                 \n11  The lack of a concrete, imminent injury is fatal to all of the individual claims in \nplaintiffs’  amended  complaint,  for  the  reasons  stated  herein.    In  addition,  plaintiffs’  Tenth \nAmendment claim suffers a further defect discussed in Section II, infra.   \n13 \n \n\nB.   Plaintiffs’ Allegations Regarding Diversion of Resources and Chilling of \nSpeech Do Not Establish Standing. \n \nPlaintiffs’ amended complaint attempts to allege a concrete injury based simply on “fear” \nthat they will be subject to unlawful abuse at some future point in time, but plaintiffs’ subjective \nfear of chilling (assuming that it still exists a couple of months later and with the benefit of \nhindsight) does not in itself establish standing under Article III.  Am. Complt. ¶ 173.  Likewise, \nplaintiffs’  claim  about  the  “diversion”  of  financial  resources  lacks  any  basis  in  law  for \ncircumstances such as these, where there is no actual policy or action by the government that \nplaintiffs must divert resources to combat.  Am. Complt. ¶ 177.   \nPlaintiffs’ purported fear that they might be subject to injury does not establish Article III \nstanding because, again, on its face plaintiffs’ amended complaint does not demonstrate that their \nsubjective fear is grounded in actual facts relating to Chicago.  In free speech cases brought under \nthe First Amendment, a plaintiff’s “notional or subjective fear of chilling is insufficient to sustain \na court’s jurisdiction under Article III.”  Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1972) (denying \nplaintiff’s First Amendment claim involving fear of unlawful surveillance during protest activity).  \nIn order to establish standing, the plaintiff must “substantiate a concrete and particularized chilling \neffect on his protected speech or expressive conduct” to pursue prospective relief.  Bell v. Keating, \n697 F.3d 445, 454 (7th Cir. 2012); Speech First, Inc., 968 F.3d at 639.  Plaintiffs here originally \nalleged that certain BLM members would not attend a protest scheduled for the weekend of July \n24-26 out of fear they might suffer injury, but then the July 24 weekend came and went, and \nplaintiffs’ post-July 24-weekend amended complaint makes no mention of any infringement of \nFirst Amendment rights that took place.  Instead, plaintiffs simply make a vague statement that \n14 \n \n\nthey have “protests and political actions into the foreseeable future,” but do not allege that any \nmembers are too fearful to attend.  Am. Complt. ¶ 166.   \nPlaintiffs’ claims about diversion of financial resources are also insufficient to establish an \ninjury in fact.  It is true that for certain advocacy groups, the deflection of the group’s time and \nmoney to legal efforts can qualify as an injury for purposes of Article III.  See, e.g., Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (upholding “drain on resources” standing in the \ncontext of an organization that works to combat discrimination in housing); H.O.P.E., Inc. v. Alden \nGardens of Bloomingdale, Inc., No. 15 C 9715, 2017 WL 4339823 at * 5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 29, 2017) \n(same).  But the cases that stand for this proposition are universally ones that deal with issues such \nas voting rights, housing discrimination, and immigration — areas in which the plaintiffs are able \nto allege there is an actual policy, rule, or law that is enforced by the defendants and will have the \neffect of diverting the group’s resources.  See Common Cause Indiana v. Lawson, 937 F.3d 944, \n953 (7th Cir. 2019) (collecting cases).  Plaintiffs still must show that there are new, concrete \nburdens created by the law being challenged, that the disruption to the organization’s operations \nis real, and that its response is warranted.  Id. at 955.  The allegation in the present case — that the \nplaintiff National Lawyers Guild Chicago has printed “Know Your Rights” fliers and information \nfor protestors — does not amount to a claim that defendants have actually injured plaintiffs in a \nconcrete way.  Am. Complt. ¶ 179.12  There is no claim of a specific rule or policy in effect that \nplaintiffs are compelled to combat.  See Common Cause Indiana, 937 F.3d at 955 (noting that \n                                                 \n12  The amended complaint also alleges that a group denoted as “OCAD” “has had to \nredirect their staff and financial resources” as a result of defendants’ alleged conduct.  Am. Complt. \n¶ 178.  However, it is not clear from the amended complaint who OCAD is, what the acronym \nstands for, or whether OCAD was intended to be named an actual plaintiff in this lawsuit.   \n15 \n \n\norganizations do not have standing based solely on the baseline work they are already doing — \nthey “cannot convert ordinary program costs into an injury in fact”). \nFinally, a plaintiff cannot simply create an injury by undertaking action to avoid harm.  \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 416 (plaintiffs “cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on \nthemselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending”).  \nWhen such self-imposed harm is based on an injury that is too speculative, it is not fairly traceable \nto the defendant’s conduct.  Id.  As explained above, plaintiffs’ alleged fear that their members’ \nFirst and Fourth Amendment rights will be violated while engaging in peaceful protests in Chicago \nis exceedingly speculative.  Accordingly, any diversion of resources or concrete chilling effect \nbased on this fear is not fairly traceable to defendants’ conduct.    \nC.   Plaintiffs Cannot Establish Standing Merely by Citing to Events That Took \nPlace in Portland. \n  \nUltimately, this case was not filed in Portland, and it cannot be maintained based merely \non the events that are alleged to have taken place 1800 miles away.  The doctrine of standing “is \nnot an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable.”  Doe, 41 F.3d at 1162.  An individual who \nsimply reads about events affecting someone else in another state cannot bring suit on the theory \nthat he himself is injured.  Mainstreet Org. of Realtors v. Calumet City, Ill., 505 F.3d 742, 745 (7th \nCir. 2007); see also Aurora Loan Serv., Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. 2006) \n(“There is a sense in which I am ‘injured’ when I become upset by reading about the damage \ncaused that fine old vineyard in Burgundy by a band of marauding teetotalers, yet that injury would \nnot be an ‘injury’ that conferred standing to sue under Article III.”).   \nEven if it were the case that the events in Portland could form the basis for an articulable \ninjury in Chicago, this case would still be improper under the doctrine of prudential standing.  \n16 \n \n\nMainstreet, 505 F.3d at 745; Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation \nof Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 474-75 (1982).  That is, a set of facts should not be litigated \nby a plaintiff whose injury, if any, is derivative from the actual immediate victims of the alleged \nconduct.  Mainstreet, 505 F.3d at 745.  In other words, individuals in Portland are perfectly capable \nof vindicating their own rights and prosecuting their own case where warranted.  Many groups in \nPortland are already doing so.  See Background Section I, supra.  But Chicagoans are not directly \naffected by those events, and the “victims with the largest stakes” who have first-hand information \nabout the facts in Portland are the ones best situated to bring those cases.  Id.  Absent a particular \ninjury that is specific to the events and plaintiffs here in Chicago (and no such injury is alleged in \nplaintiffs’ amended complaint), there is no case or controversy to be litigated here.13  \nII.  Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim Under the Tenth Amendment. \nStanding issues aside, plaintiffs’ Tenth Amendment claim is both impermissibly broad and \nvague.    While  plaintiffs  vaguely  complain  that  federal  law  enforcement  is  impermissibly \nconducting “traditional state law enforcement activities” in Chicago, they do not cite to a specific \nstatute that they claim violates the Tenth Amendment’s limit to federal legislative authority.  Nor \ncan plaintiffs allege that the type of federal law enforcement activity being conducted in Portland \nor Chicago is beyond that authorized by Congress or interferes in any way with State law \nenforcement.   \nThe Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: “The powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved \n                                                 \n  13  Plaintiffs’ lack of standing requires dismissal of not just their three constitutional \nclaims in Counts I, II, and V, but also their Declaratory Relief Act claim in Count III and their \nconspiracy claim in Count IV, since these two claims are derivatives of the constitutional claims.  \n17 \n \n\nto the States respectively, or to the people.”  Indeed, the Tenth Amendment protects the states from \nfederal intrusion that might threaten their separate and independent existence.  EEOC v. Wyoming, \n460  U.S.  226  (1983).    Simply  put,  the Tenth Amendment serves  as  an  affirmative  external \nlimitation on federal legislation.  Nat’l League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976); see also \nNew York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 188 (1992) (Congress may neither “compel the States to \nenact or administer a federal regulatory program.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ theory under the Tenth Amendment is not only atypical but is impermissibly \nbroad.  Plaintiffs vaguely allege that the defendants are “encroaching upon powers explicitly \nreserved  to  the  State  of  Illinois  []  and  to  Illinois  citizens”  by  “conducting  traditional  law \nenforcement activities on the streets and sidewalks of Chicago.”  Am. Complt. ¶ 211.  They \nclaimed when the case was filed that a federal “secret police force” would be deployed in Chicago \nand that there “would soon be an unchecked federal presence on the streets of Chicago.”  Id. ¶ 141; \nsee generally id. ¶¶ 130-155.  Aside from the fact that that did not happen, what is glaringly missing \nfrom the complaint is any claim that a specific federal law violates the Tenth Amendment.  Indeed, \nplaintiffs do not cite to a specific statute or in any way allege that a piece of federal legislation \nviolates the Tenth Amendment.   \nFurther, while the plaintiffs complain that the defendants are “encroaching upon powers \nexplicitly reserved to the State of Illinois,” they do not articulate what specific powers they are \nreferring to.  A broad review of meritorious Tenth Amendment case law demonstrates that Tenth \nAmendment lawsuits commonly challenge congressional authority to legislate and do not address \ngeneralized complaints of federal law enforcement powers.  See, e.g., New York, 505 U.S. at 155 \n(discussing Tenth Amendment jurisprudence and stating: “In some cases the Court has inquired \n18 \n \n\nwhether an Act of Congress is authorized by one of the powers delegated to Congress in Article I \nof the Constitution.  In other cases courts have sought to determine whether an Act of Congress \ninvades the province of state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment.” (internal citations \nomitted)); Gillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693 (7th Cir. 1999) (concluding that federal \nGun Control Act of 1968 did not violate Tenth Amendment); Travis v. Reno, 12 F. Supp. 2d 921, \n928 (W.D. Wis. 1998) (collecting Tenth Amendment cases addressing various federal statutes).  \nUltimately, the amended complaint fails to portray a picture of how the federal defendants are \ncommandeering a state regulatory scheme.   \nTo the extent that engaging in “traditional law enforcement activities” could somehow \nestablish a valid Tenth Amendment claim, it would still fail in this case because the actions that \nplaintiffs complain of in Portland and Chicago relate exclusively to federal law enforcement \npowers and are not limited by, nor do they conflict with, state law enforcement.  Plaintiffs’ alleged \nwrongdoing by DHS agents in Portland arises out of the agents’ efforts to protect federal property \nand federal officers.  As explained above, DHS agents are authorized to “protect the buildings, \ngrounds, and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the Federal Government.”  40 \nU.S.C. § 1315(a).  As part of this authority, a federal law enforcement officer may enforce federal \nlaws, make arrests without a warrant if the federal officer has reasonable grounds to believe a \nfelony has been committed, and conduct investigations into wrongdoing that may have occurred \non federal property.  40 U.S.C. § 1315(b)(2); see also 28 U.S.C. 566; 28 C.F.R. § 0.111(f).  \nSimilarly, federal agents fighting violent crime in Chicago under Operation LeGend are authorized \nto do so under a variety of federal criminal laws such as those relating to guns and drugs.  Indeed, \nplaintiffs appear to concede in their amended complaint that fighting such violent crime by federal \n19 \n \n\nagents is not only common but lawful.  Am. Complt. ¶ 159 (“Chicago is already saturated with \nfederal  law  enforcement  agents  who  conduct  duly  authorized  law  enforcement  activities”).  \nPlaintiffs’ vague Tenth Amendment claim fails to explain how federal officers in Chicago are \nattempting to enforce state or local law or are prohibiting state entities from doing anything related \nto their own police powers.  Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot state a claim that the federal agents’ \nlaw enforcement activity in Portland or Chicago violates the Tenth Amendment.  \nConclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, the court should dismiss plaintiffs’ amended complaint. \n            Respectfully submitted, \nJOHN R. LAUSCH, Jr. \n            United States Attorney \n \n            By: s/ Kathleen M. Flannery   \n                  KATHLEEN M. FLANNERY \n                  NIGEL B.

The President and his appointees are sending federal agents to the \nstreets of Chicago in order to intimidate and falsely arrest civilians who are \nexercising their constitutional right to speak and to assemble.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 3 of 41 PageID #:3\n2.  Federal authorities have promised to deploy in Chicago the same \nsecret police force that has terrorized the people of Portland, Oregon for more than a \nweek, where civilians have been kidnapped, beaten, and tear gassed by anonymous \nfederal agents.  \n3.  Rarely in modern times has a President of the United States trampled \non bedrock constitutional protections on this scale or so brazenly usurped states’ \npolice power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the \npeople for his own personal political benefit. \n4.  Plaintiffs have been engaged intensively in peaceful protest in Chicago \nfor the past eight weeks, and they and their members have additional peaceful \nprotests planned for today and the immediate future. \n5.  Plaintiffs are entitled to this Court’s protection of their constitutional \nright to peacefully protest. This Court must check the unrestrained and unlawful \nactions of the executive branch. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \nthe First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and 5 U.S.C. § \n702, et seq. \n7.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and \ninjunctive relief by the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202; the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706; and the Court’s equitable powers. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 4 of 41 PageID #:4\n8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Defendants are United \nStates agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. Plaintiffs are residents of \nthe State of Illinois, and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred and are \nlikely to continue occurring in the State of Illinois, within the City of Chicago. \n9.  Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants \nare officers or employees of the United States acting in their official capacity, and at \nleast one Plaintiff resides in this district or a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff BLACK LIVES MATTER CHICAGO is an organization that \nfights for justice alongside the families most impacted by racially motivated violence \nand marginalization of Black communities, while working to create just and \nequitable systems. Black Lives Matter (BLM) Chicago works to end state violence \nand criminalization of Black communities by deconstructing the white supremacist, \ncapitalist patriarchy. Individual members of BLM Chicago regularly plan and \nparticipate in protests and political actions, have participated in the recent protests \nin Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to constitutional violations by the \nDefendants under the policies and practices described herein, including but not \nlimited to violations of their First Amendment rights and false arrests and \ndetentions. These constitutional violations would require BLM Chicago to spend \nadditional time and resources providing support to its members, diverting resources \naway from BLM’s mission of creating just and equitable systems for all. BLM \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 5 of 41 PageID #:5\nChicago brings this action on its own behalf and as an organizational representative \nfor its members. \n11.  Plaintiff BLACK ABOLITIONIST NETWORK (BAN) is a network of \norganizers, strategists, and activists who provide strategic support to the \nmovement. BAN members conduct mass trainings, teach-ins and town halls for \ncommunity members. Individual members of BAN regularly plan and participate in \nprotests and political actions, have participated in the recent protests in Chicago, \nand are likely to be subjected to the constitutional violations by the Defendants \nunder the policies and practices described herein, including but not limited to \nviolations of their First Amendment rights and false arrests and detentions. These \nconstitutional violations would require BAN to spend additional time and resources \nproviding support to its members, diverting resources away from BAN’s mission of \nproviding support to movements and increasing the capacity of community \nmembers involved in movement work. BAN brings this action on its own behalf and \nas an organizational representative for its members. \n12.  Plaintiff CHICAGO DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA \n(CDSA) is an organization of over 2,500 members in Cook County, Illinois and an \nIllinois corporation. As part of pursuing its political mission, it engages in peaceful \nmass protest against violent police repression of the working class. Through its \nonline magazine, newsletter, podcast, and other media channels, CDSA and its \nindividual members are also engaged in journalism on the subject of the recent \nuprisings responding to police violence against the working class. Individual \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 6 of 41 PageID #:6\nmembers of DSA regularly plan and participate in protests and political actions, \nhave participated in the recent protests in Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to \nthe constitutional violations by the Defendants under the policies and practices \ndescribed herein, including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights and false arrests and detentions. These constitutional violations would \nrequire CDSA to spend additional time and resources providing support to its \nmembers, diverting resources away from CDSA’s mission of creating a more \nequitable world by establishing socialism as a political force. DSA brings this action \non its own behalf and as an organizational representative for its members. \n13.  Plaintiff GOOD KIDS/MAD CITY (GKMC) are young Black and Brown \npeople united in fighting to end violence in their cities. They work to achieve more \nresources for underserved communities on the South Side and West Side of Chicago \nand provide support to young people affected by violence. Individual GKMC \nmembers regularly plan and participate in protests, have participated in the recent \nprotests in Chicago, and also have launched “love marches” to encourage \ncommunities to resolve conflicts peacefully. They are likely to be subjected to the \nconstitutional violations by the Defendants under the policies and practices \ndescribed herein, including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights and false arrests and detentions. When these constitutional violations occur, \nGKMC must divert time and resources from its mission of reducing violence and \nimproving equality in underserved neighborhoods. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 7 of 41 PageID #:7\n14.  Plaintiff #LETUSBREATHE COLLECTIVE is a collaborative of artists \nand activists that serves communities directly impacted by mass criminalization, \npolice violence, and systemic injustice by centering marginalized voices and \ndismantling oppressive systems. Through direct action and cultural events, \n#LETUSBREATHE COLLECTIVE aims to organize artists to love and transform \nthemselves and their communities through radical imagination and creative healing \nwork. Individual members of #LETUSBREATHE COLLECTIVE regularly plan and \nparticipate in protests and political actions, have participated in the recent protests \nin Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to the constitutional violations by the \nDefendants under the policies and practices described herein, including but not \nlimited to violations of their First Amendment rights and false arrests and \ndetentions. When these constitutional violations occur, #LETUSBREATHE \nCOLLECTIVE must divert time and resources from its mission of promoting radical \nhealing work in underserved communities. \n15.  Plaintiff SOUTH SIDERS ORGANIZED FOR UNITY AND \nLIBERATION (“SOUL”) is a membership organization that consists of more than \ntwo dozen faith based organizations and community organizations on the Southside \nof Chicago, that organizes the communities in which its member organizations \noperate to fight for low-income people of color in the Chicago southland to build \npower and leverage that power to fight for their own interest and liberation. SOUL \npartners with their membership organizations and trains them and other \ncommunity activists and leaders in organizing strategies specifically designed to \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 8 of 41 PageID #:8\nbuild leadership and impact public policy and legislation on multiple issues \nincluding housing, health care, education, economic development, employment, \nyouth services and public safety policy. For the last two months, SOUL has focused \nits organizing on public safety policy and has activated many of the members and \ncongregants of its membership organizations and congregations to participate in \nprotests to encourage smarter public safety strategies that involve less policing and \nmore resources in disinvested communities. Individual staff and members of SOUL \nregularly plan and participate in protests and political actions, have participated in \nthe recent protests in Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to the constitutional \nviolations by the Defendants under the policies and practices described herein, \nincluding but not limited to violations of their First Amendment rights and false \narrests and detentions. When these constitutional violations occur, SOUL must \ndivert time and resources from its mission of promoting radical healing work in \nunderserved communities. \n16.  Plaintiff NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD CHICAGO (NLG Chicago) is \nan organization of lawyers, law students, legal workers, and jailhouse lawyers \nwho operate as a political and social force, working to build a world where human \nrights are regarded as more sacred than property interests. Individual members of \nNLG Chicago have been subject to aggressive policing and incommunicado \ndetention by virtue of their advocacy in support of First Amendment-protected \nprotest activity. NLG Chicago provides “Legal Observers” who document police \nbehavior during protests, including the most recent ones opposing police violence. It \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 9 of 41 PageID #:9\nalso provides legal representation to protesters who are arrested. Individual \nmembers of NLG Chicago regularly attend protests as Legal Observers, have \nparticipated in the recent protests in Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to the \nconstitutional violations by the Defendants under the policies and practices \ndescribed herein, including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights and false arrests and detentions. When these constitutional violations occur, \nNLG Chicago is forced to divert time and resources away from their mission of \nprotecting members’ and clients’ civil rights and liberties during protests. \nFurthermore, when Legal Observers are arrested during protests, NLG Chicago \nloses the ability to provide oversight of police activities and treatment of protesters. \nNLG Chicago is further forced to divert resources to find other Legal Observers to \ncover the duties of arrested members. \n17.  Plaintiff FIRST DEFENSE LEGAL AID (FDLA) was originally a pro \nbono nonprofit that provided free representation at police stations in Chicago. This \nwas its purpose for nearly a quarter century until it organized its mission out of \nexistence by fighting for and achieving a Cook County-wide policy that calls for the \nCook County Public Defender to represent arrestees at police stations in Chicago \nand throughout Cook County. FDLA still maintains a hotline that sends callers \nlooking for police station representation to the Public Defender, and therefore uses \nresources when those calls are made. But the primary two functions of FDLA are \nnow different. First, FDLA continues to employ attorneys that represent pro bono \nindividuals that have low-damage civil rights cases against the City of Chicago \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 10 of 41 PageID #:10\nwhen no private firm will take that case. Second, FDLA operates a hotline that \nprovides non-police alternatives for community members that do not want to call \npolice to deal with issues such as mental health disturbances, suicidal relatives, \ndomestic disturbances, homeless people, minor trespassing, etc. This hotline is the \nmodel of what local jurisdictions including Chicago should be doing to de-escalate \nviolent interactions between police and citizens. Lastly, FDLA has some community \nnavigators that work with community activists and leaders to organize for \ncommunity power and say so in public policy including public safety public policy. \nEvery aspect of FDLA’s operations will see its resources stressed by the presence of \nfederal law enforcement in Chicago. This includes its navigators’ desires to engage \nin public policy action being tempered. \n18.   Plaintiff WASHINGTON-BALTIMORE NEWS GUILD (WBNG), \nCOMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA (CWA) LOCAL 32035, IN THESE \nTIMES UNIT, is a bargaining unit representing journalists and communication \nworkers. This unit of the WBNG is also referred to as the “In These Times Union,” \nand is comprised of journalists and other workers employed by the publication, In \nThese Times. In These Times is an independent, nonprofit magazine which is \ndedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a \nmore humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies \nthat shape the future. In These Times is based in Chicago and covers topics of social \nand political interest, with a focus on movements for social change, including the \nBlack Lives Matter movement and other movements calling to defund police \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 11 of 41 PageID #:11\ndepartments. In order to effectively report on these movements, members of the In \nThese Times Union have attended protests against police violence in Chicago and \nintend to continue to do so. Individual members of the In These Times Union are \nlikely to be subjected to constitutional violations by Defendants, including but not \nlimited to violations of their First Amendment rights. \n19.

UNKNOWN AGENTS AND OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES \n1–10 are unidentified agents and officers of the federal agencies listed in this \ncomplaint, acting under color of federal law and within the scope of their \nemployment and duties with the respective agencies by which they are employed or \nfor which they are agents. \nFACTS \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE ENGAGED IN PEACEFUL PROTESTS \n  A.  Peaceful Protests in Chicago in 2020  \n32.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers murdered George Floyd, \nwho was handcuffed and lying face down on the ground, by suffocating him to death \nin broad daylight on the street. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 15 of 41 PageID #:15\n33.  Floyd’s murder and the police murder of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, \nKentucky, in addition to recent police murders of other Black people in the United \nStates sparked the largest movement for social and racial justice in history and has \nincluded peaceful protests around the world against anti-Black police violence, \nsystemic racism, and inequality. \n34.  In Chicago, Plaintiffs are the leaders of this movement against anti-\nBlack racism and for human rights and social justice. \n35.  Since the end of May 2020, there have been nearly daily protests and \nactions throughout the city of Chicago, ranging in size from a few dozen people to \nthousands. These protests have occurred throughout Chicago, in the Loop, and the \nSouth, West and North sides. \n36.  Plaintiffs have been part of the largest global movement for human \nrights in recent memory. The Plaintiffs Black Lives Matter Chicago, Black \nAbolitionist Network, Chicago Democratic Socialists of America, Good Kids/Mad \nCity, #LetUsBreathe Collective, South Siders Organized for Unity and Liberation, \nand their membership have been in the streets protesting police brutality as part of \nthe movement for Black lives. \n37.  Legal observers associated with the Plaintiffs National Lawyers Guild \nChicago and First Defense Legal Aid have been attending the protests to document \npolice activity and police constitutional violations. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 16 of 41 PageID #:16\n38.  Members of Plaintiff Washington-Baltimore News Guild, CWA Local \n32035, In These Times Unit have been present at protests to report on the historic \nprotests as well as on the police response. \nB.  Violence by the Chicago Police During Peaceful Protests \n39.  The Chicago Police Department (CPD) has responded—and continues \nto respond—to these protests with brutal, violent, unconstitutional tactics that are \nclearly intended to silence protestors.  \n40.  CPD officers consistently target protesters with unlawful, retaliatory \nand lethal force. Officers’ animus against protesters is unmistakable—they \nregularly refer to protestors with terms that are vile, misogynistic, and anti-gay. \nCPD also targets protester’s property—destroying cameras, phones, eyeglasses and \nconfiscating bikes, backpacks, and other belongings.   \n41.  Protesters often report that CPD officers intentionally strike them on \ntheir head with batons with enough force to leave people bloodied and in some \ninstances with serious concussions.  \n42.  On June 23, 2020, the Chicago Reader published an in-depth \nexamination of the CPD’s use of lethal force during the May 2020 protests. The \nreporter documented “83 baton strikes on at least 32 different people by officers, \nmost captured on video. Nearly all appear to violate [CPD] policy with more than \nhalf of the strikes on video involving police beating people who were already on the \nground. Multiple videos also show officers hitting protesters in the head with batons \ndespite rules limiting these strikes to situations requiring deadly force.” The Reader \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 17 of 41 PageID #:17\narticle notes that these unlawful uses of force often occurred in full view of \nsupervisors who failed to intervene and that most officers failed to report their uses \nof force. \n43.  CPD’s brutal response has also included police officers tackling \nprotesters to the ground, kneeing protesters in the neck and back, kicking \nprotesters in the legs to cause them to fall, trapping protesters on bridges, pushing \nprotesters stranded on bridges, pinning protesters against hard surfaces, using tear \ngas and pepper spray, dragging protesters through the streets, punching protesters \nin the face, stomping on protesters on the ground, and beating protesters severely.  \n44.  Protesters widely report that CPD targets those it has identified as \nprotest marshals or leaders with the most brutal violence apparently as part of a \nstrategy to quell the protesters’ free expression. CPD also was particularly violent \nwith protesters who expressed concern that CPD was harming other people. \nProtestors repeatedly reported that CPD officers pushed, shoved, battered, and \nharassed people who were filming acts of police brutality during the uprisings. \nOften this resulted in confiscated or damaged camera and physical injury to \nprotesters exercising their First Amendment right to record the police. \n45.  People of all races who interact with CPD officers during protests \nreport that officers are aggressive, rude, disrespectful, and often affirmatively \nescalate encounters through taunts, shoves, pushes and other inappropriate \nbehavior. CPD officers used particularly hostile language towards women and \nmembers of the LGBTQ community.  \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 18 of 41 PageID #:18\n46.  CPD’s response to the protests also reflects a pattern and practice of \nbreaking, stealing, or otherwise disposing of protestors’ belongings, including bikes, \ncameras, glasses, goggles and, in some instances, canes used to assist with mobility. \n47.  CPD has also engaged in a systemic practice of illegal searches of \nprotesters, seizure of protesters, and false arrest of protesters. \n48.  Throughout these events, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has praised the police \nfor their “restraint.” \nC.  Chicago’s History of Illegal Force, Arrest, Detention, and \nSurveillance of Protestors \n \n49.  CPD has long used excessive force and false arrest at protests, \nincluding in recent years, at the Black Lives Matters protests and the protests \nagainst the NATO Summit in 2012. \n50.  CPD has a long history of surveillance of protesters. This has included \nsending law enforcement infiltrators to surveil protest groups and using technology \nto surveil the communications of protesters and organizers. \n51.  CPD has long operated an unconstitutional detention center at the \nintersection of South Homan Street and West Filmore Avenue (hereinafter “Homan \nSquare”). CPD has brought thousands of people—predominately and \ndisproportionately Black and Latinx people—to Homan Square and interrogated \nthem using unconstitutional tactics including: physical threats and assaults, denial \nof food, water, bathrooms, and sleep, placing individuals in cells with the \noverwhelming stench of human feces and urine, psychological coercion, threats of \nfalse charges, and racial slurs. CPD has used these interrogations to try to obtain \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 19 of 41 PageID #:19\ninformation from individuals. CPD holds these individuals for long periods of time, \nwithout allowing them access to legal counsel or taking them before a judge, and \nwithout revealing their whereabouts to concerned friends, family members, or \ncounsel. In other words, the activities of CPD at Homan Square proceed under a \nshroud of secrecy without any judicial or public oversight. \nII.  THE PRESIDENT HAS DEPLOYED A SECRET POLICE FORCE \nA.  President Trump’s Threats to Use Force Against Civilians \n52.  President Donald Trump has long fancied himself a strongman leader \nbetter suited for a dictatorship than a democracy. \n53.  He has maligned the nation’s cities, including Chicago, Portland, and \nNew York, saying they are “run” by “Radical Left Democrats” who, in his view, will \n“destroy our Country as we know it.” \n54.  The President has continually spoken out against peaceful protestors, \neven directing his agents to clear peaceful protestors from public grounds outside of \nthe White House through the use of physical force and chemical weapons.  \n55.  On June 1st, 2020, some 350 CBP officers were deployed to \nWashington, D.C. to patrol the protests. CBP’s Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan \ndefended this deployment in a tweet stating that: “These ‘protests’ have devolved \ninto chaos & acts of domestic terrorism by groups of radicals & agitators. @CBP is \nanswering the call and will work to keep DC safe.” \n56.  Repeatedly, the President has warned the nation’s cities that he will \nuse similar force against their civilians to end peaceful protest. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 20 of 41 PageID #:20\n57.  To this end, on June 26, 2020, the President signed an Executive Order \non “Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues, and Combating \nRecent Criminal Violence,” in which he fulminated against the protests in American \ncities and gave federal law enforcement and military leave to “assist” in protecting \nfederal property for the next six months. \n58.  On July 1, 2020, CBP circulated a memorandum to CBP officers \ndetailing their mission in Portland as a response to the President’s recent Executive \nOrder. \n59.  The July 1st CBP Memo explained that the Acting Secretary of DHS, \nChad Wolf, created the DHS Protecting American Communities Task Force, which \nwould “provide an ongoing assessment of potential civil unrest and property \ndestruction and to address resource allocation and potential surge activity to ensure \nthe continuing protection of people and property.” \n60.  The July 1st CBP Memo further explained that DHS has decided along \nwith other departments and agencies that it is “in the public interest and fiscally \nsound for the Federal Protective Services . . . to partner with other federal law \nenforcement to execute the directive of the President. To that end, DHS began \ncoordination with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of the Interior \n(DOI) to establish information/intelligence sharing[.]” \n61.  The July 1st CBP Memo goes on to explain that CBP officers were to \nbe deployed to cities across the country for the July 4th weekend. \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 21 of 41 PageID #:21\n62.  Defendant Wolf announced on July 3, 2020 that DHS was “following \n[President Trump’s] lead in deploying special units to defend our national treasures \nfrom rioters.” He also stated, “We won’t stand idly by while violent anarchists and \nrioters seek not only to vandalize and destroy the symbols of our nation, but to \ndisrupt law and order and sow chaos in our communities,” and “civil unrest will not \nbe tolerated.” \n63.  CBP officers, and upon information and belief, other federal agents, \nhave been deployed in undisclosed cities throughout the country in response to the \nnationwide protests, or what DHS calls “civil unrest” or “disruptive activity.” One of \nthese locations was Portland, Oregon. \nB.  The Secret Police Terrorize Portland \n64.  Starting on or about July 1, 2020, President Trump gave life to his \nauthoritarian vision for our cities, sending unidentified federal agents to the streets \nof Portland, Oregon. \n65.  For several weeks, a paramilitary force of agents of the DHS, as well \nas other federal agents known and unknown to Plaintiffs, have been deployed on \nPortland streets. \n66.  It has been reported in the media that the camouflaged federal troops \nsent to Portland were officers from several federal agencies, including not only CBP, \nbut also the U.S. Marshals Service. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 22 of 41 PageID #:22\n67.  These federal agents dressed in camouflage, fatigues, and tactical gear, \nwithout any insignia or information identifying them. They have used batons, tear \ngas, rubber bullets, and munitions on protesters, journalists, and legal observers.  \n68.  They have used such force and intimidation despite the fact that \nprotestors, journalists, and legal observers were not committing any federal crimes, \nand were not doing anything threatening whatsoever.    \n69.  For example, federal agents shot unarmed protester Donavan LaBella \nin the head with a munition, reportedly fracturing his skull.  \n70.  On July 12, 2020, while journalist Mathieu Lewis-Rolland was \ndocumenting protests in Portland, federal agents shot him in the side and back ten \ntimes with hard plastic bullets that tore holes into his “PRESS” t-shirt, despite his \nclear identification as press, and despite that he was carrying bulky camera \nequipment, staying in well-lit areas, and posing no threat to anyone. \n71.  Journalist Garrison Davis was also covering protests in Portland on \nthe night of July 11, 2020 and the early morning of July 12, wearing a helmet that \nsaid “PRESS” on it in big block letters, holding his press pass, and not participating \nin protests. Though he posed no threat to anyone, a federal agent shot him in the \nback with a tear gas canister, pepper bullets, and other munitions.  \n72.  Egregiously, federal agents beat and pepper-sprayed a Navy veteran, \nChristopher David, who went to the protests to ask the federal agents whether they \nthought they were upholding the U.S. Constitution with their actions. In response, \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 23 of 41 PageID #:23\nthe agents beat him (breaking his hand) and pepper sprayed him in the face, \ndespite the fact that David posed no threat.  \n73.  Indeed, even when a “wall of mothers”—women, some of whom were \npregnant—stood in front of the protestors peacefully, arm-and-arm, and chanted \nthings like “leave our kids alone,” the federal agents terrorized them with chemical \nweapons and other acts of violence.  \n74.  On July 16, 2020, another Memorandum was sent to Chad Wolf as \nActing Secretary of DHS (July 16th DHS Memo). \n75.  This July 16th DHS Memo stated that acting in response to President \nTrump’s Executive Order CBP and ICE had “mobilized tactical teams to provide \nsupport to [FPS] in protecting federal buildings and assets within the greater \nPortland, Oregon area.” \n76.  Further, the July 16th DHS Memo explains how the U.S. Marshals \nService “deployed their Special Operations Group (USMS/SOG) to further assist \nFPS in the protection of the Mark O. Hartfield Federal Courthouse in Portland,” \nand that the “U.S. Secret Service, . . . ICE/HSI, and the . . . FBI have also provided \ninvestigative support to FPS.” \n77.  While in Portland, these CBP officers reportedly entered sections of the \ncity where residents were peacefully protesting racial and social injustice. \n78.  CBP officers in Portland were wearing generic green law enforcement \nuniforms with no identifying insignias. These CBP officers then approached \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 24 of 41 PageID #:24\nprotesters in unmarked vehicles, in some instances far from any federal property, \nbuildings, or monuments they were deployed to protect. \n79.  On July 15, 2020, armed federal agents dressed in camouflage pulled \nMark Pettibone into an unmarked van without identifying themselves, drove him to \nwhat is believed to have been a federal courthouse, and detained him in a cell before \nreleasing him without any paperwork, citation, or record of his arrest. \n80.  Another protester in Portland reported that she and others were \nstanding and talking to one another when they heard a fellow protester yell that a \n“snatch van” was approaching. She described these officers, later determined to be \nCBP agents, as “putting bags over [protesters’] heads, and putting them in out-of-\nstate plated vans.” The CBP issued a statement confirming that its agents were \nresponsible for this lawless kidnapping of a civilian from the streets of Portland. \n81.  The July 1st CBP Memo and the July 16th DHS Memo each outline \nthe coordination between subagency officers and agents of DHS, DOJ, and DOI \nwhich has been ongoing throughout the summer since in response to nationwide \nprotests. \n82.  According to Ken Cuccinelli, the Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, the Hatfield courthouse in Portland is protected by the FPS. The Acting \nDeputy Secretary explained that CBP and ICE officers were called in to support \nFPS and, thus, that FPS was directing the involvement by CBP, ICE, and other \nDHS officers. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 25 of 41 PageID #:25\n83.  Defendant Wolf has publicly stated that 43 arrests have been made in \nrelation to operations in Portland since the weekend of July 4th, including by teams \nof FPS and CBP officers working together. It is unknown how many instances have \nresulted in unauthorized searches, questioning, or seizure and temporary detention. \nIt is also unknown which agencies have carried out exactly which arrests, searches, \ndetainments, or custodial interrogations. \n84.  The President and his appointees and officers have tried to \ncharacterize these incidents of detainment and arrests as a response to individuals \ndestroying federal property. For example, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken \nCuccinelli stated in an interview with NPR that “We’re talking only about violent \nrioters. We’re not talking about actual protesters. We’re not seeking to interfere at \nall with anyone peacefully expressing themselves—period, full stop.” \n85.  However, incidents like what happened to Mark Pettibone show \notherwise—that protesters could do nothing more than walk down the street and \nstill be subject to search, arrest, and hours of detainment. \n86.  Oregon Governor Kate Brown has called the federal agents’ conduct in \nPortland “a blatant abuse of power,” and has criticized the Trump Administration \nfor intentionally “provok[ing] confrontation for political purposes.”  \n87.  In a letter co-signed by the mayors of five other cities, including \nChicago’s Mayor, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler criticized the federal agents for \nusing “tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes—not our democracy” and \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 26 of 41 PageID #:26\nconfirmed that “the irresponsible actions of [the federal] agencies threaten \ncommunity safety.”  \n88.  Oregon’s Attorney General has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to enjoin \nthe federal agents from continuing to engage in their unlawful tactics. \n89.  Oregon’s Governor has requested the removal of federal agents from \nPortland’s streets, as has Mayor Wheeler, but Defendant Wolf has refused. \n90.  The modus operandi of the paramilitary force of federal agents in \nPortland includes: (1) anonymous federal agents dressed in camouflage who bear no \nknown designation and refuse to identify themselves; (2) the use of unmarked \nvehicles used to illegally arrest and detain and round up protestors, journalists, and \nobservers; (3) kidnapping of innocent civilians without probable cause; (4) uses of \nexcessive, inexcusable force against people exercising their right to speak and to \nassemble as well as people reporting on peaceful protests; and (5) “preemptive \narrests” of people without probable cause to believe they committed any federal \ncrime.  \nC.  The Federal Policy of Conducting Illegal Arrests \n91.  On July 15, 2020, a video emerged showing camouflaged federal agents \ngrabbing an individual off the street in Portland and placing him in an unmarked \nvan. \n92.  NLG Legal Observers who were recording the video objected to this \nkidnapping. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 27 of 41 PageID #:27\n93.  On July 17, 2020, an official U.S. Customs and Border Patrol \nstatement confirmed that the camouflaged officers were CBP agents. \n94.  In a press conference on July 21, 2020, Defendant Wolf called on \nDefendant Cline to explain the “standard of probable cause” justifying these arrests.  \n95.  Defendant Cline specifically addressed the July 15th unmarked officer \narrests explaining that the CBP agents had identified a man “in a crowd and in an \narea” where someone was aiming a laser at officers, and they followed him to a \ncalmer location to talk to him. After doing so, they removed him from the area \nwhere other protesters and observers were nearby and took him to another location \nin a van. They held him for approximately 20 minutes and then released him \n“because they did not have what they needed” to hold him.  \n96.  In attempting to justify the constitutionality of this act, Cline \ncharacterized it as a “simple engagement” and “not a custodial arrest.” \n97.  These Defendants’ statements established a policy of allowing officers \nto make arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment. \n98.  Later the same day, Defendant Wolf stated that DHS was “having to \ngo out and proactively arrest individuals . . . to hold them accountable.” \n99.  Defendant Wolf’s statement explaining DHS’s authority to “proactively \narrest” individuals further confirmed a federal policy that is being implemented by \nfederal agents on city streets that contravenes the protections of the Fourth \nAmendment by sanctioning arrests without probable cause. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 28 of 41 PageID #:28\n100.  President Trump has approved of the actions of the federal agents in \nPortland, thereby ratifying the federal agents’ policy of arresting individuals \nwithout probable cause and justifying the continued and expanded use of unlawful \narrests that agents employed in Chicago and other cities. \n101.  For example, on June 20, 2020, President Trump stated “we’ve done a \ngreat job in Portland. . . . I guess we have many people in jail right now. We very \nmuch quelled it, and if it starts again, we’ll quell it again very easily. It’s not hard to \ndo, if you know what you’re doing.” \n102.  When the President and Defendants Wolf and Barr announced at their \nJuly 22, 2020 press conference that they would deploy a “surge” of federal agents to \nother cities, including Chicago, at no point did any of them or anyone else state that \nthe policy of conducting unlawful or preemptive arrests like those conducted in \nPortland would not continue during the “surge” of officers being imminently \ndeployed to Chicago. \nD.  The Secret Police Have Been Deployed to Chicago \n103.  Despite public outcry against these flagrant constitutional violations, \nthe President has vowed to continue to use federal agents to mount a hostile \ntakeover of U.S. cities. \n104.  The President has said that his efforts in Portland were designed to \n“help” that city and that Chicago, among other cities, is next. \n105.  These developments are unsurprising, given that on May 28, 2020, the \nPresident said that he would send the military to confront protesters and invoked \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 29 of 41 PageID #:29\nthe racist phrase of a segregationist used to quell prior cries for racial equality: \n“When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” \n106.  The President again made threats about deploying the National Guard \nto “dominate the streets” and using “thousands of heavily armed soldiers” against \ncivilians. \n107.  On June 1, 2020, amid the protests in Washington, D.C., the President \nordered police and National Guard troops to clear peaceful protestors from \nLafayette Square and surrounding streets using tear gas and other weapons. This \nwas done solely so that the President could walk from the White House to St. John’s \nEpiscopal Church, so that he could hold a Bible for a photo-op. \n108.  Other federal appointees and officers have also made clear the \nAdministration’s intention to replicate what is taking place in Portland elsewhere, \nincluding in Chicago.  \n109.  Defendant Wolf announced that DHS was going to deploy agents to \nChicago and would “do that whether they like us there or not.”  \n110.  In an interview on July 19, 2020, the President called Chicago \n“stupidly run” and pledged to have “more federal law enforcement” in Chicago and \nother cities “all run by liberal Democrats.” \n111.   On July 22, 2020, the President held a news conference from the East \nRoom of the White House confirming that there would be a “surge” of federal agents \narriving imminently in Chicago. \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 30 of 41 PageID #:30\n112.  During those remarks, the President was explicit that the federal law \nenforcement response is needed to address problems purportedly caused by the \nactivities and demands of protestors, and that federal agents would help to restore \norder in Chicago. \n113.  In addition, neither the President, Defendant Barr, nor Defendant \nWolf gave any assurance that the “hundreds” of federal agents flooding Chicago \nwould leave protestors alone. At no time did they acknowledge that the federal \ngovernment had overstepped in Portland. At no time did they agree that the federal \nlaw enforcement activities currently taking place in Portland would be limited to \nPortland. \n114.  On the contrary, the President and Defendants made clear that there \nwould soon be an unchecked federal presence on the streets of Chicago, with the \nPresident describing federal authority as “as wide as it can be.” \n115.  The President and Defendants repeatedly tied the decision to send \nfederal law enforcement officers to Chicago to the actions of protesters, blaming \nprotesters for violence in Chicago. \n116.  The President cited “a radical movement to defund, dismantle and \ndissolve our police departments” that “has led to a shocking explosion of \nshootings, killings, murders, and heinous crimes of violence.” He complained \nthat local “politicians have now embraced the far-left movement to break up our \npolice departments causing violent crime in their cities to spiral . . . seriously \nout of control.” He demanded that Americans ”insist that community officials \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 31 of 41 PageID #:31\nfully support, fully back and fully fund their local police departments” and said \nfederal law enforcement would remain until then. He repeated “[w]e will never \ndefund the police, we will hire more great police” and “[w]hile others want to \ndefund, defame and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great \npolice.” \n117.  Defendant Barr announced, ”[W]e’re going to continue to confront \nmob violence,” and he claimed that “a significant increase in violent crime” is \nthe “direct result of the attack on the police forces” and calls “for the defunding \nof police departments.” \n118.  All of this is consistent with the President’s numerous statements \nsince the beginning of the nationwide protests that he intends to use federal \nagents to stop protestors. \n119.  For instance, the President tweeted: “Get tough Democrat Mayors and \nGovernors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The \nWorld is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? \nNO!!!” This early suggestion that the National Guard was needed to quell actions of \nparticular political groups or protesters with political leanings, such as “anarchists,” \nmakes clear that the aim in calling in federal officers is to quell protests—not just \nthose committing crimes against property. \n120.  The President has expressed his disdain for the viewpoints of the \nprotestors: “Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the \nWhite House could hardly believe how easy it was. “A walk in the park”, one said. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 32 of 41 PageID #:32\nThe protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY \neasily by the Guard, D.C. Police, & S.S. GREAT JOB!” \n121.  The President has indicated his intention to “dominate” protestors: \n“D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. \nOverwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you \nPresident Trump!)” \n122.  The President has expressed satisfaction when protestors self-censor \nby staying home: “I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the \nprocess of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under \nperfect control. They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far \nfewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!” \n123.  At President Trump’s rally at Mount Rushmore on July 4, 2020, he \nannounced that he was “deploying federal law enforcement to protect our \nmonuments, arrest the rioters, and prosecute offenders to the fullest extent of the \nlaw.” \n124.  Finally, in retweeting a thread which showed New York stores boarded \nup in anticipation of any violence following the continuation of nationwide protests, \nPresident Trump wrote, “The National Guard is ready!” \nIII.  CHICAGO IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO STOP UNLAWFUL \nFEDERAL INTERVENTION \n \n125.  Chicago’s Mayor has publicly recognized the problems with the \nPresident’s secret police force, saying, “We don’t need federal agents without any \ninsignia taking people off the streets and holding them, I think, unlawfully.” \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 33 of 41 PageID #:33\n126.  The Mayor has also recognized that an “influx” of federal agents to \nChicago is on its way. \n127.  In a July 20, 2020 letter to the President, Chicago’s Mayor stated that \nfederal agents deployed to Chicago “that would not be within our control or within \nthe direct command of the Chicago Police would spell disaster.” \n128.  Chicago is already saturated with federal law enforcement agents who \nconduct duly authorized law enforcement activities in Chicago and the region on a \ndaily basis.  \n129.  A further influx of such agents in lieu of investment in the \ncommunities most affected by gun violence, police violence, and racism is \ncounterproductive, destructive, and a potentially violent disaster. \n130.  Contrary to her stated position, on information and belief, Chicago’s \nMayor has had discussions with federal authorities about the initial deployment of \nfederal agents in Chicago, and on July 21, 2020, she confirmed that federal agents \nwould be deployed to Chicago. \n131.  The assent of Chicago’s Mayor to the surge of federal forces means that \nwhen the President sends federal agents to Chicago, as he did to Portland, the CPD \nand the City will be unable and unwilling to protect protestors from unlawful use of \nexcessive force and arrests without probable cause. \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS FEAR CONTINUING THEIR LAWFUL ACTIVITIES \n132.  Given the City of Chicago’s history of violence against peaceful \nprotestors, and its recent violence against protestors, the addition of federal forces \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 34 of 41 PageID #:34\nto illegally intimidate, police, and falsely arrest peaceful protestors will ignite \nadditional official violence against civilians and a serious constitutional crisis \nwithin the City of Chicago. \n133.  Indeed, recognizing these legitimate and imminent fears, State \nRepresentative Will Guzzardi, whose district overs the City of Chicago’s northwest \nside, reports that his constitutes are “terrified by the news” of impeding federal \nagents, and that some have been dissuaded from protesting. \n134.  Plaintiffs have planned frequent protests and political actions into the \nforeseeable future, including the weekend of July 24, 2020. Events are planned for \nJuly 24, 25, and 26, 2020, and additional events are expected during the following \nweek. All of the Plaintiffs herein have made plans and put aside resources to \nparticipate in one or more activity this weekend, including: a) a #LetUsBreathe \nrally at Freedom Square on Friday, July 24, 2020, across the street from the Homan \nSquare, a police station notorious for disappearing people (sometimes in conjunction \nwith Federal DEA or ATF agents); b) a protest organized by multiple organizations \nincluding Plaintiffs BLM Chicago and CDSA on Saturday, July 25, 2020 in Grant \nPark to support Black Lives; c) another protest also in Grant Park on Saturday, \nJuly 25, 2020 to call for the abolition of ICE. \n135.  NLG Chicago Legal Observers have observed over 50 demonstrations \nsince the end of May 2020, when nationwide protests against systemic racism, \ninequality, and police violence, sparked by the murders of George Floyd and \nBreonna Taylor, began. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 35 of 41 PageID #:35\n136.  Plaintiff NLG Chicago seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of \nprotestors by observing protests and obtaining information from protestors who are \narrested so that they can be tracked and provided pro bono or low-cost \nrepresentation. \n137.  Plaintiff FDLA seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of \nprotesters by observing protests and obtaining information from protesters who are \narrested so that they can be tracked and provided pro bono or low-cost \nrepresentation. \n138.  Plaintiff In These Times Union, has documented and tracked hundreds \nof instances of violence, harassment and arrests directed toward journalists by \nmembers of law enforcement of local, state, and federal agencies throughout the \ncountry. Individual members of In These Times Union are aware of “less lethal” \nmunitions being deployed by federal agents against journalists covering protests in \nPortland and instances where members of the Chicago Police Department have \nused physical force to prevent journalists from covering protests. \n139.  Plaintiffs are aware of the activities of federal law enforcement officers \nin Portland; specifically, they are aware that federal agents have kidnapped, falsely \narrested, and brutalized protestors and NLG Legal Observers. \n140.  Plaintiffs are also aware that President Trump is deploying federal \nofficers to Chicago immediately, and that the CPD intends to work with the federal \nagents. \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 36 of 41 PageID #:36\n141.  Plaintiffs would like to continue exercising their First Amendment \nrights of speech, assembly, observing, and newsgathering, but they fear that federal \nagents will kidnap, falsely arrest, or physically abuse them. \n142.  Specifically, Plaintiff BLM Chicago has members who are not going to \nattend the protests and rallies planned for this weekend because they fear federal \nagents will kidnap, falsely arrest, or physically abuse them, as they did to \nprotestors in Portland. \nLEGAL CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nInterference with Speech, Peaceful Assembly, and the Press \nIn Violation of the First Amendment \n \n143.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each of the paragraphs in this \nComplaint as if restated fully herein. \n144.  Individuals who peacefully gather on the streets of Chicago to protest \nhave the right to gather, express themselves, and petition for redress of grievances \nunder the First Amendment. \n145.  Members of the press and individuals have the right to gather, receive, \nrecord, and disseminate information and news under the First Amendment. \n146.  Defendants’ actions are undertaken with the intent of discouraging \nand suppressing lawful protest and therefore constitute an illegal prior restraint on \nindividuals’ First Amendment right to peacefully protest racial inequality.  \n147.  Many individuals who are reasonably afraid of being brutalized or \npicked up and shoved into unmarked vans by federal agents will feel compelled to \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 37 of 41 PageID #:37\nstay away, for their own personal safety, and will therefore be unable to express \nthemselves in the way that they have the right to do. \n148.  In the manner described more fully above, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment \nrights have been and are being infringed. Their exercise of their rights to speak, \nassemble, petition, and gather news is being chilled due to the well-founded fear \nthat they will be brutalized or kidnapped by federal agents for no reason other than \nbeing a protestor, journalist, or legal observer on the streets and sidewalks of \nChicago. \nCOUNT II \nFederal Policy of Conducting False Arrests  \nIn Violation of the Fourth Amendment \n \n149.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each of the paragraphs of this \nComplaint as if restated fully herein. \n150.  The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable seizures, and in \nparticular prohibits federal officials from arresting a person without probable cause \nto believe that they have committed a federal crime. \n151.  In so doing, the Fourth Amendment also plainly prohibits “preemptive \narrests” in anticipation of a possible violation of the law. \n152.  Defendants and the federal agents discussed in this complaint are \noperating pursuant to an official federal policy, approved by responsible federal \nagency heads with final policymaking authority, of conducting arrests of individuals \nwithout probable cause to believe they have committed federal crimes, including \n“preemptive arrests” of peaceful protestors and journalists. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 38 of 41 PageID #:38\n153.  Federal agents’ conduct in other cities as described above, and in \nparticular their false arrest of peaceful protestors and journalists, was caused by \nand pursuant to this unconstitutional federal policy. \n154.  No probable cause exists to believe that Plaintiffs, their members, or \nany other similarly situated protestors, legal observers, or journalists, has \ncommitted a federal crime. Plaintiffs’ anticipated participation in protests does not \nprovide probable cause to believe that a person has committed a federal crime. \n155.  In the absence of an injunction, Defendants will arrest and seize \nindividuals off the streets in Chicago without probable cause, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment, pursuant to official federal policy. \nCOUNT III \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 \nDeclaration of Rights \n \n156.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the paragraphs of the complaint as if \nrestated fully herein. \n157.  In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, any court of the \nUnited States may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested \nparty seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought, \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n158.  There is an actual controversy within the jurisdiction of this court, \ninasmuch as one or more federal defendants have engaged in actions endangering \nPlaintiffs and others assembled on Chicago’s streets. No federal authority has \nagreed to stop this practice. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 39 of 41 PageID #:39\n159.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the acts at issue are \nunlawful, and an injunction precluding Defendants from continuing in them. \nCOUNT IV \n \nConspiracy \n \n160.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the paragraphs of this complaint as if \nrestated fully herein. \n161.  Defendants, acting in concert with other co-conspirators, known and \nunknown, reached an agreement among themselves to deprive Plaintiffs of their \nconstitutional rights, all as described in the various paragraphs of this Complaint. \n162.  In so doing, these co-conspirators conspired to accomplish an unlawful \npurpose by unlawful means. In addition, these co-conspirators agreed among \nthemselves to protect one another from liability for depriving Plaintiffs of these \nrights. \n163.  In furtherance of their conspiracy, each of these co-conspirators \ncommitted overt acts and were otherwise willful participants in joint activity. \n164.  The misconduct described herein was undertaken intentionally, in \ntotal disregard of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  Wherefore, Plaintiffs pray for a judgment and the following relief: \n1.  A declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint restrain Plaintiffs’ ability to assemble in peaceful \nprotest, observing, and news gathering, in violation of the First Amendment; \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 40 of 41 PageID #:40\n2.  A declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint constitute a federal unlawful policy of committing \narrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment; \n3.  A declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint present an imminent threat that Plaintiffs will be \narrested without probable cause, by unidentified federal agents, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment; and \n4.  An injunction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202 and 5 U.S.C. § 702, \npermanently enjoining the Defendants from engaging in the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint, and specifically requiring that the Defendants and their \nofficers and agents: \na.  Refrain from interfering in or otherwise policing lawful and peaceful \nassemblies and protests in the City of Chicago; \nb.  Cease enforcement of their unlawful policy of conducting arrests \nwithout probable cause to believe a federal crime has been committed \nand conducting “preemptive arrests”; \nc.  Refrain from arresting individuals in the City of Chicago without \nprobable cause to believe that a federal crime has been committed; \nd.  Identify themselves and their agency before detaining or arresting any \nperson off the streets of Chicago; \ne.  Explain to any person detained or arrested that the person is being \ndetained or arrested and explain the basis for that action; and \nf.  Any other relief this Court deems proper. \n   \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/23/20 Page 41 of 41 PageID #:41\nRespectfully submitted, \nBLACK LIVES MATTER \nCHICAGO, et al. \n \nBy: /s/ Theresa Kleinhaus    \nOne of Plaintiffs’ Attorneys \n \nJon Loevy  Elizabeth Wang \nHeather Lewis Donnell  LOEVY & LOEVY     \nSteve Art    2060 Broadway, Ste. 460 \nTheresa Kleinhaus   Boulder, CO 80302 \nJulia Rickert  (720) 328-5642 \nLindsay Hagy   \nRuth Brown  David B.

ALBENCE, Deputy Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; \nMARK A. MORGAN, a senior official currently performing the duties of the \nCommissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; WILLIAM BARR, \nAttorney General of the United States; L. ERIC PATTERSON, Director of Federal \nProtective Services; RICHARD K. CLINE, Principal Deputy Director of the Federal \nProtective Services; DONALD W. WASHINGTON, Director of the U.S. Marshals \nService; CHRISTOPHER WRAY, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; \nTIMOTHY J. SHEA, Acting Administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency; \nREGINA LOMBARDO, Acting Director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms; and UNKNOWN AGENTS AND OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES \n1-10, and state as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The President and his appointees are sending federal agents to the \nstreets of Chicago in order to intimidate and falsely arrest civilians who are \nexercising their constitutional right to speak and to assemble.  \n2.  Federal authorities have promised to deploy in Chicago the same \nsecret police force that has terrorized the people of Portland, Oregon for more than \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 3 of 49 PageID #:58\ntwo weeks, where civilians have been kidnapped, beaten, and tear gassed by \nanonymous federal agents.  \n3.  Rarely in modern times has a President of the United States trampled \non bedrock constitutional protections on this scale or so brazenly usurped states’ \npolice power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the \npeople for his own personal political benefit. \n4.  Plaintiffs have been engaged intensively in and have reported on \npeaceful protest in Chicago for the past nine weeks, in the wake of the murder of \nGeorge Floyd and other Black Americans who were murdered by police officers, and \nthey and their members have additional peaceful protests planned for today and the \nimmediate future. \n5.  Plaintiffs are entitled to this Court’s protection of their constitutional \nright to peacefully protest. This Court must check the unrestrained and unlawful \nactions of the executive branch. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \nthe First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and 5 U.S.C. § \n702, et seq. \n7.  The Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and \ninjunctive relief by the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202; the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706; and the Court’s equitable powers. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 4 of 49 PageID #:59\n8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Defendants are United \nStates agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. Plaintiffs are residents of \nthe State of Illinois, and the events giving rise to this complaint occurred and are \nlikely to continue occurring in the State of Illinois, within the City of Chicago. \n9.  Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants \nare officers or employees of the United States acting in their official capacity, and at \nleast one Plaintiff resides in this district or a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff BLACK LIVES MATTER CHICAGO is an organization that \nfights for justice alongside the families most impacted by racially motivated violence \nand marginalization of Black communities, while working to create just and \nequitable systems. Black Lives Matter (BLM) Chicago works to end state violence \nand criminalization of Black communities by deconstructing the white supremacist, \ncapitalist patriarchy. Individual members of BLM Chicago regularly plan and \nparticipate in protests and political actions, have participated in the recent protests \nin Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to constitutional violations by the \nDefendants under the policies and practices described herein, including but not \nlimited to violations of their First Amendment rights and false arrests and \ndetentions. These constitutional violations would require BLM Chicago to spend \nadditional time and resources providing support to its members, diverting resources \naway from BLM’s mission of creating just and equitable systems for all. BLM \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 5 of 49 PageID #:60\nChicago brings this action on its own behalf and as an organizational representative \nfor its members. \n11.  Plaintiff BLACK ABOLITIONIST NETWORK (BAN) is a network of \norganizers, strategists, and activists who provide strategic support to the \nmovement. BAN members conduct mass trainings, teach-ins and town halls for \ncommunity members. Individual members of BAN regularly plan and participate in \nprotests and political actions, have participated in the recent protests in Chicago, \nand are likely to be subjected to the constitutional violations by the Defendants \nunder the policies and practices described herein, including but not limited to \nviolations of their First Amendment rights and false arrests and detentions. These \nconstitutional violations would require BAN to spend additional time and resources \nproviding support to its members, diverting resources away from BAN’s mission of \nproviding support to movements and increasing the capacity of community \nmembers involved in movement work. BAN brings this action on its own behalf and \nas an organizational representative for its members. \n12.  Plaintiff CHICAGO DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA \n(CDSA) is an organization of over 2,500 members in Cook County, Illinois and an \nIllinois corporation. As part of pursuing its political mission, it engages in peaceful \nmass protest against violent police repression of the working class. Through its \nonline magazine, newsletter, podcast, and other media channels, CDSA and its \nindividual members are also engaged in journalism on the subject of the recent \nuprisings responding to police violence against the working class. Individual \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 6 of 49 PageID #:61\nmembers of CDSA regularly plan and participate in protests and political actions, \nhave participated in the recent protests in Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to \nthe constitutional violations by the Defendants under the policies and practices \ndescribed herein, including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights and false arrests and detentions. These constitutional violations would \nrequire CDSA to spend additional time and resources providing support to its \nmembers, diverting resources away from CDSA’s mission of creating a more \nequitable world by establishing socialism as a political force. CDSA brings this \naction on its own behalf and as an organizational representative for its members. \n13.  Plaintiff GOOD KIDS/MAD CITY (GKMC) are young Black and Brown \npeople united in fighting to end violence in their cities. They work to achieve more \nresources for underserved communities on the South Side and West Side of Chicago \nand provide support to young people affected by violence. Individual GKMC \nmembers regularly plan and participate in protests, have participated in the recent \nprotests in Chicago, and also have launched “love marches” to encourage \ncommunities to resolve conflicts peacefully. They are likely to be subjected to the \nconstitutional violations by the Defendants under the policies and practices \ndescribed herein, including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights and false arrests and detentions. When these constitutional violations occur, \nGKMC must divert time and resources from its mission of reducing violence and \nimproving equality in underserved neighborhoods. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 7 of 49 PageID #:62\n14.  Plaintiff #LETUSBREATHE COLLECTIVE is a collaborative of artists \nand activists that serves communities directly impacted by mass criminalization, \npolice violence, and systemic injustice by centering marginalized voices and \ndismantling oppressive systems. Through direct action and cultural events, \n#LETUSBREATHE COLLECTIVE aims to organize artists to love and transform \nthemselves and their communities through radical imagination and creative healing \nwork. Individual members of #LETUSBREATHE COLLECTIVE regularly plan and \nparticipate in protests and political actions, have participated in the recent protests \nin Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to the constitutional violations by the \nDefendants under the policies and practices described herein, including but not \nlimited to violations of their First Amendment rights and false arrests and \ndetentions. When these constitutional violations occur, #LETUSBREATHE \nCOLLECTIVE must divert time and resources from its mission of promoting radical \nhealing work in underserved communities. \n15.  Plaintiff SOUTH SIDERS ORGANIZED FOR UNITY AND \nLIBERATION (“SOUL”) is a membership organization that consists of more than \ntwo dozen faith based organizations and community organizations on the Southside \nof Chicago, that organizes the communities in which its member organizations \noperate to fight for low-income people of color in the Chicago southland to build \npower and leverage that power to fight for their own interest and liberation. SOUL \npartners with their membership organizations and trains them and other \ncommunity activists and leaders in organizing strategies specifically designed to \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 8 of 49 PageID #:63\nbuild leadership and impact public policy and legislation on multiple issues \nincluding housing, health care, education, economic development, employment, \nyouth services and public safety policy. For the last two months, SOUL has focused \nits organizing on public safety policy and has activated many of the members and \ncongregants of its membership organizations and congregations to participate in \nprotests to encourage smarter public safety strategies that involve less policing and \nmore resources in disinvested communities. Individual staff and members of SOUL \nregularly plan and participate in protests and political actions, have participated in \nthe recent protests in Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to the constitutional \nviolations by the Defendants under the policies and practices described herein, \nincluding but not limited to violations of their First Amendment rights and false \narrests and detentions. When these constitutional violations occur, SOUL must \ndivert time and resources from its mission of promoting radical healing work in \nunderserved communities. \n16.  Plaintiff NATIONAL LAWYERS GUILD CHICAGO (NLG Chicago) is \nan organization of lawyers, law students, legal workers, and jailhouse lawyers \nwho operate as a political and social force, working to build a world where human \nrights are regarded as more sacred than property interests. Individual members of \nNLG Chicago have been subject to aggressive policing and incommunicado \ndetention by virtue of their advocacy in support of First Amendment-protected \nprotest activity. NLG Chicago provides “Legal Observers” who document police \nbehavior during protests, including the most recent ones opposing police violence. It \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 9 of 49 PageID #:64\nalso provides legal representation to protesters who are arrested. Individual \nmembers of NLG Chicago regularly attend protests as Legal Observers, have \nparticipated in the recent protests in Chicago, and are likely to be subjected to the \nconstitutional violations by the Defendants under the policies and practices \ndescribed herein, including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights and false arrests and detentions. When these constitutional violations occur, \nNLG Chicago is forced to divert time and resources away from their mission of \nprotecting members’ and clients’ civil rights and liberties during protests. \nFurthermore, when Legal Observers are arrested during protests, NLG Chicago \nloses the ability to provide oversight of police activities and treatment of protesters. \nNLG Chicago is further forced to divert resources to find other Legal Observers to \ncover the duties of arrested members. \n17.  Plaintiff FIRST DEFENSE LEGAL AID (FDLA) was originally a pro \nbono nonprofit that provided free representation at police stations in Chicago. This \nwas its purpose for nearly a quarter century until it organized its mission out of \nexistence by fighting for and achieving a Cook County-wide policy that calls for the \nCook County Public Defender to represent arrestees at police stations in Chicago \nand throughout Cook County. FDLA still maintains a hotline that sends callers \nlooking for police station representation to the Public Defender, and therefore uses \nresources when those calls are made. But the primary two functions of FDLA are \nnow different. First, FDLA continues to employ attorneys that represent pro bono \nindividuals that have low-damage civil rights cases against the City of Chicago \n9 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 10 of 49 PageID #:65\nwhen no private firm will take that case. Second, FDLA operates a hotline that \nprovides non-police alternatives for community members that do not want to call \npolice to deal with issues such as mental health disturbances, suicidal relatives, \ndomestic disturbances, homeless people, minor trespassing, etc. This hotline is the \nmodel of what local jurisdictions including Chicago should be doing to de-escalate \nviolent interactions between police and citizens. Lastly, FDLA has some community \nnavigators that work with community activists and leaders to organize for \ncommunity power and say so in public policy including public safety public policy. \nEvery aspect of FDLA’s operations will see its resources stressed by the presence of \nfederal law enforcement in Chicago. This includes its navigators’ desires to engage \nin public policy action being tempered. \n18.   Plaintiff IN THESE TIMES (ITT) is an independent, nonprofit \nmagazine which is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, \ninforming movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum \nfor debate about the policies that shape the future. ITT is based in Chicago and \ncovers topics of social and political interest, with a focus on movements for social \nchange, including the Black Lives Matter movement and other movements calling \nto defund police departments. In order to effectively report on these movements, \njournalists employed full-time or in a freelance capacity by ITT have attended \nprotests against police violence in Chicago and intend to continue to do so. \nJournalists employed by ITT are likely to be subjected to constitutional violations \n10 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 11 of 49 PageID #:66\nby Defendants—including but not limited to violations of their First Amendment \nrights. \n19.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of their \nmembers. \n20.  Defendant CHAD WOLF is the purported acting secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS).

Defendant WILLIAM BARR is Attorney General of the United States, \nand in that position oversees the U.S. Department of Justice. \n25.  Defendant L. ERIC PATTERSON is Director of Federal Protective \nServices. Federal Protective Services (FPS) is a division of DHS. Its mission is “[t]o \nprevent, protect, respond to and recover from terrorism, criminal acts, and other \nhazards threatening the U.S. Government’s critical infrastructure, services, and the \npeople who provide or receive them.” According to its website, it is responsible for \nguarding 9,000 federal facilities and employs more than 1,300 officers, agents, and \nsupport staff who are responsible for overseeing another 13,000 private contractors. \n26.  Defendant RICHARD K. CLINE is the Principal Deputy Director of the \nFPS. According to his official DHS biography, he “serves as an extension of the \nDirector and operates with full authority to execute the mission of the FPS.” \n27.  Defendant DONALD W. WASHINGTON is Director of the U.S. \nMarshals Service. The U.S. Marshals Service is an agency within and under the \n12 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 13 of 49 PageID #:68\ncontrol of the U.S. Department of Justice. According to a Fact Sheet on its website, \n“it is the enforcement arm of the federal courts, involved in virtually every federal \nlaw enforcement initiative.” The U.S. Marshals Service’s Special Operations Group \nsays it is “deployed in high-risk and sensitive law enforcement situations, national \nemergencies, civil disorder and natural disasters.” \n28.  Defendant CHRISTOPHER WRAY is Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI). The Federal Bureau of Investigation is an agency within the \nU.S. Department of Justice. \n29.

According to its website, the mission of the \nDEA is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United \nStates and bring to the criminal and civil justice system of the United States, or any \nother competent jurisdiction, those organizations and principal members of \norganizations, involved in the growing, manufacture, or distribution of controlled \nsubstances appearing in or destined for illicit traffic in the United States; and to \nrecommend and support non-enforcement programs aimed at reducing the \navailability of illicit controlled substances on the domestic and international \nmarkets. \n30.  Defendant REGINA LOMBARDO is Acting Director of the U.S. \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). According to the ATF’s \nwebsite, “ATF is a law enforcement agency in the United States’ Department of \n13 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 14 of 49 PageID #:69\nJustice that protects our communities from violent criminals, criminal \norganizations, the illegal use and trafficking of firearms, the illegal use and storage \nof explosives, acts of arson and bombings, acts of terrorism, and the illegal diversion \nof alcohol and tobacco products.

UNKNOWN AGENTS AND OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES \n1–10 are unidentified agents and officers of the federal agencies listed in this \ncomplaint, acting under color of federal law and within the scope of their \nemployment and duties with the respective agencies by which they are employed or \nfor which they are agents. \nFACTS \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE ENGAGED IN PEACEFUL PROTESTS \n  A.  Peaceful Protests in Chicago in 2020  \n32.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officers murdered George Floyd, \nwho was handcuffed and lying face down on the ground, by suffocating him to death \nin broad daylight on the street. \n33.  Floyd’s murder and the police murder of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, \nKentucky, in addition to recent police murders of other Black people in the United \nStates sparked the largest movement for social and racial justice in history and has \nincluded peaceful protests around the world against anti-Black police violence, \nsystemic racism, and inequality. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 15 of 49 PageID #:70\n34.  In Chicago, Plaintiffs are the leaders of this movement against anti-\nBlack racism and for human rights and social justice. \n35.  Since the end of May 2020, there have been nearly daily protests and \nactions throughout the city of Chicago, ranging in size from a few dozen people to \nthousands. These protests have occurred throughout Chicago, in the Loop, and the \nSouth, West, and North sides. \n36.  Plaintiffs have been part of the largest global movement for human \nrights in recent memory. The Plaintiffs Black Lives Matter Chicago, Black \nAbolitionist Network, Chicago Democratic Socialists of America, Good Kids/Mad \nCity, #LetUsBreathe Collective, South Siders Organized for Unity and Liberation, \nOCAD, and their membership have been in the streets protesting police brutality as \npart of the movement for Black lives. \n37.  Legal observers associated with the Plaintiffs National Lawyers Guild \nChicago and First Defense Legal Aid have been attending the protests to document \npolice activity and police constitutional violations. \n38.  Journalists and employees of Plaintiff In These Times have been \npresent at protests to report on the historic protests as well as on the police \nresponse. \nB.  Violence by the Chicago Police During Peaceful Protests \n39.  The Chicago Police Department (CPD) has responded—and continues \nto respond—to these protests with brutal, violent, unconstitutional tactics that are \nclearly intended to silence protestors.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 16 of 49 PageID #:71\n40.  CPD officers consistently target protesters with unlawful, retaliatory, \nand lethal force. Officers’ animus against protesters is unmistakable—they \nregularly refer to protestors with terms that are vile, misogynistic, and anti-gay. \nCPD also targets protester’s property—destroying cameras, phones, eyeglasses and \nconfiscating bikes, backpacks, and other belongings.   \n41.  Protesters often report that CPD officers intentionally strike them on \ntheir head with batons with enough force to leave people bloodied and in some \ninstances with serious concussions.  \n42.  On June 23, 2020, the Chicago Reader published an in-depth \nexamination of the CPD’s use of lethal force during the May 2020 protests. The \nreporter documented “83 baton strikes on at least 32 different people by officers, \nmost captured on video. Nearly all appear to violate [CPD] policy with more than \nhalf of the strikes on video involving police beating people who were already on the \nground. Multiple videos also show officers hitting protesters in the head with batons \ndespite rules limiting these strikes to situations requiring deadly force.” The Reader \narticle notes that these unlawful uses of force often occurred in full view of \nsupervisors who failed to intervene and that most officers failed to report their uses \nof force. \n43.  CPD’s brutal response has also included police officers tackling \nprotesters to the ground, kneeing protesters in the neck and back, kicking \nprotesters in the legs to cause them to fall, trapping protesters on bridges, pushing \nprotesters stranded on bridges, pinning protesters against hard surfaces, using tear \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 17 of 49 PageID #:72\ngas and pepper spray, dragging protesters through the streets, punching protesters \nin the face, stomping on protesters on the ground, and beating protesters severely.  \n44.  Protesters widely report that CPD targets those it has identified as \nprotest marshals or leaders with the most brutal violence apparently as part of a \nstrategy to quell the protesters’ free expression. CPD also was particularly violent \nwith protesters who expressed concern that CPD was harming other people. \nProtestors repeatedly reported that CPD officers pushed, shoved, battered, and \nharassed people who were filming acts of police brutality during the uprisings. \nOften this resulted in confiscated or damaged camera and physical injury to \nprotesters exercising their First Amendment right to record the police. \n45.  People of all races who interact with CPD officers during protests \nreport that officers are aggressive, rude, disrespectful, and often affirmatively \nescalate encounters through taunts, shoves, pushes and other inappropriate \nbehavior. CPD officers used particularly hostile language towards women and \nmembers of the LGBTQ community.  \n46.  CPD’s response to the protests also reflects a pattern and practice of \nbreaking, stealing, or otherwise disposing of protestors’ belongings, including bikes, \ncameras, glasses, goggles and, in some instances, canes used to assist with mobility. \n47.  CPD has also engaged in a systemic practice of illegal searches of \nprotesters, seizure of protesters, and false arrest of protesters. \n48.  Throughout these events, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has praised the police \nfor their “restraint.” \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 18 of 49 PageID #:73\nC.  Chicago’s History of Illegal Force, Arrest, Detention, and \nSurveillance of Protestors \n \n49.  CPD has long used excessive force and false arrest at protests, \nincluding in recent years, at the Black Lives Matters protests and the protests \nagainst the NATO Summit in 2012. \n50.  CPD has a long history of surveillance of protesters. This has included \nsending law enforcement infiltrators to surveil protest groups and using technology \nto surveil the communications of protesters and organizers. \n51.  CPD has long operated an unconstitutional detention center at the \nintersection of South Homan Street and West Filmore Avenue (hereinafter “Homan \nSquare”). CPD has brought thousands of people—predominately and \ndisproportionately Black and Latinx people—to Homan Square and interrogated \nthem using unconstitutional tactics including: physical threats and assaults, denial \nof food, water, bathrooms, and sleep, placing individuals in cells with the \noverwhelming stench of human feces and urine, psychological coercion, threats of \nfalse charges, and racial slurs. CPD has used these interrogations to try to obtain \ninformation from individuals. CPD holds these individuals for long periods of time, \nwithout allowing them access to legal counsel or taking them before a judge, and \nwithout revealing their whereabouts to concerned friends, family members, or \ncounsel. In other words, the activities of CPD at Homan Square proceed under a \nshroud of secrecy without any judicial or public oversight. \n \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 19 of 49 PageID #:74\nII.  THE PRESIDENT HAS DEPLOYED A SECRET POLICE FORCE \nA.  President Trump’s Threats to Use Force Against Civilians \n52.  President Donald Trump has long fancied himself a strongman leader \nbetter suited for a dictatorship than a democracy. \n53.  He has maligned the nation’s cities, including Chicago, Portland, and \nNew York, saying they are “run” by “Radical Left Democrats” who, in his view, will \n“destroy our Country as we know it.” \n54.  The President has continually spoken out against peaceful protestors, \neven directing his agents to clear peaceful protestors from public grounds outside of \nthe White House through the use of physical force and chemical weapons. \n55.  The President and members of his administration, including \nDefendants, have repeatedly referred to protestors as “violent anarchists,” \n“agitators,” and “violent” or “lawless” “mobs.”  \n56.  On June 1st, 2020, some 350 CBP officers were deployed to \nWashington, D.C. to patrol the protests. CBP’s purported Acting Commissioner \nMark Morgan defended this deployment in a tweet stating that: “These ‘protests’ \nhave devolved into chaos & acts of domestic terrorism by groups of radicals & \nagitators. @CBP is answering the call and will work to keep DC safe.” \n57.  Repeatedly, the President has warned the nation’s cities that he will \nuse similar force against their civilians to end peaceful protest. \n58.  On June 1, 2020, the President warned that he would militarize the \nstreets of American cities, stating, “Mayor and governors must establish an \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 20 of 49 PageID #:75\noverwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled . . . . If \na city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and \nproperty of their residents, then I will deploy the United States Military and \nquickly solve the problem for them.” \n59.  To this end, on June 26, 2020, the President signed an Executive Order \non “Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues, and Combating \nRecent Criminal Violence,” in which he fulminated against the protests in American \ncities and gave federal law enforcement and military leave to “assist” in protecting \nfederal property for the next six months. \n60.  On July 1, 2020, CBP circulated a memorandum to CBP officers \ndetailing their mission in Portland as a response to the President’s recent Executive \nOrder. \n61.  The July 1st CBP Memo explained that the purported Acting Secretary \nof DHS, Chad Wolf, created the DHS Protecting American Communities Task \nForce, which would “provide an ongoing assessment of potential civil unrest and \nproperty destruction and to address resource allocation and potential surge activity \nto ensure the continuing protection of people and property.” \n62.  The July 1st CBP Memo further explained that DHS has decided along \nwith other departments and agencies that it is “in the public interest and fiscally \nsound for the Federal Protective Services . . . to partner with other federal law \nenforcement to execute the directive of the President. To that end, DHS began \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 21 of 49 PageID #:76\ncoordination with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of the Interior \n(DOI) to establish information/intelligence sharing[.]” \n63.  The July 1st CBP Memo goes on to explain that CBP officers were to \nbe deployed to cities across the country for the July 4th weekend. \n64.  Defendant Wolf announced on July 3, 2020 that DHS was “following \n[President Trump’s] lead in deploying special units to defend our national treasures \nfrom rioters.” He also stated, “We won’t stand idly by while violent anarchists and \nrioters seek not only to vandalize and destroy the symbols of our nation, but to \ndisrupt law and order and sow chaos in our communities,” and “civil unrest will not \nbe tolerated.” \n65.  CBP officers, and upon information and belief, other federal agents, \nhave been deployed in undisclosed cities throughout the country in response to the \nnationwide protests, or what DHS calls “civil unrest” or “disruptive activity.” One of \nthese locations was Portland, Oregon. \nB.  The Secret Police Terrorize Portland \n66.  Starting on or about July 1, 2020, President Trump gave life to his \nauthoritarian vision for our cities, sending unidentified federal agents to the streets \nof Portland, Oregon. \n67.  For several weeks, a paramilitary force of agents of the DHS, as well \nas other federal agents known and unknown to Plaintiffs, have been deployed on \nPortland streets. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 22 of 49 PageID #:77\n68.  It has been reported in the media that the camouflaged federal troops \nsent to Portland were officers from several federal agencies, including not only CBP, \nbut also the U.S. Marshals Service. \n69.  These federal agents dressed in camouflage, fatigues, and tactical gear, \nwithout any insignia or information identifying them. They have used batons, tear \ngas, rubber bullets, and munitions on protesters, journalists, and legal observers.  \n70.  They have used such force and intimidation despite the fact that \nprotestors, journalists, and legal observers were not committing any federal crimes, \nand were not doing anything threatening whatsoever. \n71.  For example, federal agents shot unarmed protester Donavan LaBella \nin the head with a munition, reportedly fracturing his skull.  \n72.  On July 12, 2020, while journalist Mathieu Lewis-Rolland was \ndocumenting protests in Portland, federal agents shot him in the side and back ten \ntimes with hard plastic bullets that tore holes into his “PRESS” t-shirt, despite his \nclear identification as press, and despite that he was carrying bulky camera \nequipment, staying in well-lit areas, and posing no threat to anyone. \n73.  Journalist Garrison Davis was also covering protests in Portland on \nthe night of July 11, 2020 and the early morning of July 12, wearing a helmet that \nsaid “PRESS” on it in big block letters, holding his press pass, and not participating \nin protests. Though he posed no threat to anyone, a federal agent shot him in the \nback with a tear gas canister, pepper bullets, and other munitions.  \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 23 of 49 PageID #:78\n74.  Egregiously, federal agents beat and pepper-sprayed a Navy veteran, \nChristopher David, who went to the protests to ask the federal agents whether they \nthought they were upholding the U.S. Constitution with their actions. In response, \nthe agents beat him, breaking his hand, and pepper sprayed him in the face, despite \nthe fact that David posed no threat.  \n75.  Indeed, even when a “wall of mothers”—women, some of whom were \npregnant—stood in front of the protestors peacefully, arm-and-arm, and chanted \nthings like “leave our kids alone,” the federal agents terrorized them with chemical \nweapons and other acts of violence. \n76.  When the Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, joined the protests in \nPortland last week, federal agents tear gassed him, too. \n77.  On July 16, 2020, another Memorandum was sent to Chad Wolf as \nActing Secretary of DHS (July 16th DHS Memo). \n78.  This July 16th DHS Memo stated that acting in response to President \nTrump’s Executive Order CBP and ICE had “mobilized tactical teams to provide \nsupport to [FPS] in protecting federal buildings and assets within the greater \nPortland, Oregon area.” \n79.  Further, the July 16th DHS Memo explains how the U.S. Marshals \nService “deployed their Special Operations Group (USMS/SOG) to further assist \nFPS in the protection of the Mark O. Hartfield Federal Courthouse in Portland,” \nand that the “U.S. Secret Service, . . . ICE/HSI, and the . . . FBI have also provided \ninvestigative support to FPS.” \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 24 of 49 PageID #:79\n80.  While in Portland, these CBP officers reportedly entered sections of the \ncity where residents were peacefully protesting racial and social injustice. CBP \nofficers have roamed far from any federal property, buildings, or monuments that \nthey were purportedly deployed to protect. \n81.  CBP officers in Portland were wearing generic green law enforcement \nuniforms with no identifying insignias. These CBP officers then approached \nprotesters in unmarked vehicles. \n82.  The July 1st CBP Memo and the July 16th DHS Memo each outline \nthe coordination between subagency officers and agents of DHS, DOJ, and DOI \nwhich has been ongoing throughout the summer since in response to nationwide \nprotests. \n83.  According to Ken Cuccinelli, the purported Acting Deputy Secretary of \nHomeland Security, the Hatfield courthouse in Portland is protected by the FPS. \nThe Acting Deputy Secretary explained that CBP and ICE officers were called in to \nsupport FPS and, thus, that FPS was directing the involvement by CBP, ICE, and \nother DHS officers. \n84.  Defendant Wolf has publicly stated that 43 arrests have been made in \nrelation to operations in Portland since the weekend of July 4th, including by teams \nof FPS and CBP officers working together. It is unknown how many instances have \nresulted in unauthorized searches, questioning, or seizure and temporary detention. \nIt is also unknown which agencies have carried out exactly which arrests, searches, \ndetainments, or custodial interrogations. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 25 of 49 PageID #:80\n85.  The President and his appointees and officers have tried to \ncharacterize these incidents of detainment and arrests as a response to individuals \ndestroying federal property. For example, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken \nCuccinelli stated in an interview with NPR that “We’re talking only about violent \nrioters. We’re not talking about actual protesters. We’re not seeking to interfere at \nall with anyone peacefully expressing themselves—period, full stop.” \n86.  However, incidents like what happened to Mark Pettibone show \notherwise—that protesters could do nothing more than walk down the street and \nstill be subject to search, arrest, and hours of detainment. \n87.  Oregon Governor Kate Brown has called the federal agents’ conduct in \nPortland “a blatant abuse of power,” and has criticized the Trump Administration \nfor intentionally “provok[ing] confrontation for political purposes.”  \n88.  In a letter co-signed by the mayors of five other cities, including \nChicago’s Mayor, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler criticized the federal agents for \nusing “tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes—not our democracy” and \nconfirmed that “the irresponsible actions of [the federal] agencies threaten \ncommunity safety.”  \n89.  Oregon’s Attorney General has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to enjoin \nthe federal agents from continuing to engage in their unlawful tactics. \n90.  Oregon’s Governor has requested the removal of federal agents from \nPortland’s streets, as has Mayor Wheeler, but Defendant Wolf has refused. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 26 of 49 PageID #:81\n91.  The modus operandi of the paramilitary force of federal agents in \nPortland includes: (1) anonymous federal agents dressed in camouflage who bear no \nknown designation and refuse to identify themselves; (2) the use of unmarked \nvehicles used to illegally arrest and detain and round up protestors, journalists, and \nobservers; (3) kidnapping of innocent civilians without probable cause; (4) uses of \nexcessive, inexcusable force against people exercising their right to speak and to \nassemble as well as people reporting on peaceful protests; (5) “preemptive arrests” \nof people without probable cause to believe they committed any federal crime; (6) \nextending the “perimeter” of what is considered federal property to engage with \nprotestors; and (7) investigating and questioning protestors about their \nassociational activities.  \nC.  Illegal Federal Policies of Conducting False Arrests, Unlawful \nDomestic Surveillance, and Silencing Protestors \n \n92.  Defendants have established official federal policies of conducting false \narrests without probable cause, performing unlawful domestic surveillance, and \nsilencing protestors, all with the purpose of intimidating and quashing speech \nbecause of its viewpoints. \n93.  Beginning on or about July 2020, Defendants established a federal \npolicy of conducting arrests without probable cause to believe that any crime, let \nalone a federal crime, had been committed. \n94.  On July 15, 2020, armed federal agents dressed in camouflage pulled \nMark Pettibone into an unmarked van without identifying themselves, drove him to \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 27 of 49 PageID #:82\nwhat is believed to have been a federal courthouse, and detained him in a cell before \nreleasing him without any paperwork, citation, or record of his arrest. \n95.  There was no probable cause for Pettibone’s arrest. \n96.  On July 15, 2020, a video emerged showing camouflaged federal agents \ngrabbing an individual with his hands up standing on a sidewalk in Portland, \nplacing him in an unmarked van, and driving away. \n97.  The NLG Legal Observers who was recording the video objected to this \nkidnapping. \n98.  These abductions occurred outside the jurisdiction of federal law \nenforcement. \n99.  Those abducted were not attacking federal property or personnel. \n100.  Those abducted had not committed any crime and there was no \nprobable cause to suspect them of committing any crime. \n101.  On July 17, 2020, an official U.S. Customs and Border Patrol \nstatement confirmed that the camouflaged officers were CBP agents. \n102.  In a press conference on July 21, 2020, Defendant Wolf called on \nDefendant Cline to explain the “standard of probable cause” justifying these arrests.  \n103.  Defendant Cline specifically addressed the July 15th unmarked officer \narrests explaining that the CBP agents had identified a man “in a crowd and in an \narea” where someone was aiming a laser at officers, and they followed him to a \ncalmer location to talk to him. After doing so, they removed him from the area \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 28 of 49 PageID #:83\nwhere other protesters and observers were nearby and took him to another location \nin a van. \n104.  According to Defendant Cline, the CBP agents held the protestor for \napproximately 20 minutes of interrogation and then released him “because they did \nnot have what they needed”—namely, probable cause—to hold him. \n105.  In attempting to justify the constitutionality of this act, Cline \ncharacterized it as a “simple engagement” and “not a custodial arrest.” \n106.  Later the same day, Defendant Wolf stated that DHS was “having to \ngo out and proactively arrest individuals . . . to hold them accountable.” \n107.  Defendant Wolf’s statement explaining DHS’s authority to “proactively \narrest” individuals further confirmed a federal policy that is being implemented by \nfederal agents on city streets that contravenes the protections of the Fourth \nAmendment by sanctioning arrests without probable cause. \n108.  Defendants’ unlawful policy has been directed by Defendant Wolf, who \npurports to be Acting Secretary of Homeland Security but is not legally serving in \nthis role. He has not received Senate confirmation, and indeed, the President has \nnot even nominated him, reflecting his preference for “acting” officials and avoiding \nthe oversight and accountability that the confirmation process ensures. \n109.  During Defendant Barr’s testimony before the House Judiciary \nCommittee on July 28, 2020, he reaffirmed Defendants’ belief that they and their \nagents can carry out arrests without probable cause to believe that federal crimes \nhave been committed.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 29 of 49 PageID #:84\n110.  Specifically, Congressman Ted Lieu asked Defendant Barr to \nacknowledge that the Portland van arrests are inconsistent with Dunaway v. New \nYork, 442 U.S. 200 (1979), in which the Supreme Court held that police violate the \nFourth Amendment when they pick someone up off the street and take them for \nquestioning without probable cause.  \n111.  Defendant Barr testified that his understanding is that the “modus \noperandi” of DHS agents is to take individuals into custody and question them \nbased on their previous proximity to criminal activities. \n112.  Defendants’ statements have established a federal policy of allowing \nofficers to make arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment. \n113.  President Trump has approved of the actions of the federal agents in \nPortland, thereby ratifying the federal agents’ policy of arresting individuals \nwithout probable cause and justifying the continued and expanded use of unlawful \narrests that agents employed in Chicago and other cities. \n114.  For example, on June 20, 2020, President Trump stated “we’ve done a \ngreat job in Portland. . . . I guess we have many people in jail right now. We very \nmuch quelled it, and if it starts again, we’ll quell it again very easily. It’s not hard to \ndo, if you know what you’re doing.” \n115.  Moreover, Defendants have established a federal policy of illegal \ndomestic surveillance based on political viewpoint.  \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 30 of 49 PageID #:85\n116.  In connection with the President’s June 26 Executive Order, DHS \nlaunched an expansive program of domestic surveillance. Pursuant to an internal \nunclassified DHS policy document, the DHS Office of Intelligence & Analysis has \nauthorized its intelligence officers to surveil protestors if the agency determines \nthat they pose “[t]hreats to damage or destroy any public monument, memorial, or \nstatue,” “regardless of whether such structures are situated on Federal property”. \n117.  The DHS intelligence directive further indicates that DHS analysts \ncan collect information about “individuals or groups” whom they “reasonabl[y] \nbelie[ve]” threaten to damage or destroy any public monument, including “their \ntactics, techniques, or procedures,” and “information that otherwise informs an \noverall assessment that threats to [monuments] will materialize.” \n118.  In other words, Defendants are operating under a directive that minor \nproperty damage to a non-federal monument or statue—a “threat” the agency for \nthe first time characterizes as a matter of homeland security—justifies as \nsignificant expansion of the sweep of the federal government’s authority to collect \nintelligence about civilians. \n119.  Defendants have also enacted a federal policy of unlawfully \nmonitoring, intimidating, and silencing protestors because of their message. \n120.  Defendants’ statements, an internal DHS memorandum, and the \nconduct of federal officers on the ground are evidence of this policy. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 31 of 49 PageID #:86\n121.  In addition, the brutality that protestors in Portland have faced at the \nhands of federal agents is the result of an unlawful policy that Defendants have \nestablished to quell lawful protest and intimidate protestors. \n122.  Confirming this policy, Defendant Barr testified on July 28, 2020 that \nhe believes chemical irritants are very important tools and that their use is \nwarranted even if it harms peaceful protestors. \n123.  In fact, Defendants have used a number of means to intimidate and \ndeter protestors because of their views and beliefs, including surveillance, the use of \nmilitarized and excessive force by unidentified agents, the deployment of tear gas, \npepper balls, and lethal munitions into civilian crowds, and warrantless arrests and \ncustodial detentions without probable cause. \n124.  In addition, protestors who have been arrested by federal agents in \nPortland have been asked to name their associates and fellow protestors and \nidentify what associations with which they are affiliated. \n125.  Statements from the President, the White House, and other officials \nalso reveal that the purpose of these federal policies is to quell speech and lawful \nassembly based on its viewpoint. \n126.  At a White House event on July 13, 2020, the President claimed that \n“[f]ar-left mayors are escalating the anti-cop crusade, and violent crime is spiraling \nin their cities.” He reiterated his plan to be “very strong on law enforcement” by \nsending federal officers to “liberally run” jurisdictions—“even if we have to go in and \ntake over cities.” \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 32 of 49 PageID #:87\n127.  In a Fox News interview on July 17, 2020, Kenneth Cuccinelli, who is \nthe Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, asserted that the President is determined “to help restore peace to these \nbeleaguered cities.” \n128.  On July 20, 2020, Cuccinelli told CNN, “We will maintain our \npresence,” and admitted, “When that violence recedes and those threats recede, that \nis when we would ratchet back down to what I would call normal presence \ndefending and protecting federal facilities.” \n129.  When the President and Defendants Wolf and Barr announced at their \nJuly 22, 2020 press conference that they would deploy a “surge” of federal agents to \nother cities, including Chicago, at no point did any of them or anyone else state that \nthe federal policies discussed in this section would cease during the “surge” of \nofficers being imminently deployed to Chicago. \nD.  The Secret Police Have Been Deployed to Chicago \n130.  Despite public outcry against these flagrant constitutional violations, \nthe President has vowed to continue to use federal agents to mount a hostile \ntakeover of U.S. cities. \n131.  The President has said that his efforts in Portland were designed to \n“help” that city and that Chicago, among other cities, is next. \n132.  These developments are unsurprising, given that on May 28, 2020, the \nPresident said that he would send the military to confront protesters and invoked \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 33 of 49 PageID #:88\nthe racist phrase of a segregationist used to quell prior cries for racial equality: \n“When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” \n133.  The President again made threats about deploying the National Guard \nto “dominate the streets” and using “thousands of heavily armed soldiers” against \ncivilians. \n134.  On June 1, 2020, amid the protests in Washington, D.C., the President \nordered police and National Guard troops to clear peaceful protestors from \nLafayette Square and surrounding streets using tear gas and other weapons. This \nwas done solely so that the President could walk from the White House to St. John’s \nEpiscopal Church, so that he could hold a Bible for a photo-op. \n135.  Other federal appointees and officers have also made clear the \nAdministration’s intention to replicate what is taking place in Portland elsewhere, \nincluding in Chicago. \n136.  Defendant Wolf announced that DHS was going to deploy agents to \nChicago and would “do that whether they like us there or not.”  \n137.  In an interview on July 19, 2020, the President called Chicago \n“stupidly run” and pledged to have “more federal law enforcement” in Chicago and \nother cities “all run by liberal Democrats.” \n138.   On July 22, 2020, the President held a news conference from the East \nRoom of the White House confirming that there would be a “surge” of federal agents \narriving imminently in Chicago. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 34 of 49 PageID #:89\n139.  During those remarks, the President was explicit that the federal law \nenforcement response is needed to address problems purportedly caused by the \nactivities and demands of protestors, and that federal agents would help to restore \norder in Chicago. \n140.  In addition, neither the President, Defendant Barr, nor Defendant \nWolf gave any assurance that the “hundreds” of federal agents flooding Chicago \nwould leave protestors alone. At no time did they acknowledge that the federal \ngovernment had overstepped in Portland. At no time did they agree that the federal \nlaw enforcement activities currently taking place in Portland would be limited to \nPortland. \n141.  On the contrary, the President and Defendants made clear that there \nwould soon be an unchecked federal presence on the streets of Chicago, with the \nPresident describing federal authority “as wide as it can be.” \n142.  The President and Defendants repeatedly tied the decision to send \nfederal law enforcement officers to Chicago to the actions of protesters, blaming \nprotesters for violence in Chicago. \n143.  The President cited “a radical movement to defund, dismantle and \ndissolve our police departments” that “has led to a shocking explosion of \nshootings, killings, murders, and heinous crimes of violence.” He complained \nthat local “politicians have now embraced the far-left movement to break up our \npolice departments causing violent crime in their cities to spiral . . . seriously \nout of control.” He demanded that Americans “insist that community officials \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 35 of 49 PageID #:90\nfully support, fully back and fully fund their local police departments” and said \nfederal law enforcement would remain until then. He repeated “[w]e will never \ndefund the police, we will hire more great police” and “[w]hile others want to \ndefund, defame and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great \npolice.” \n144.  Defendant Barr announced: “[W]e’re going to continue to confront \nmob violence,” and he claimed that “a significant increase in violent crime” is \nthe “direct result of the attack on the police forces” and calls “for the defunding \nof police departments.” \n145.  All of this is consistent with the President’s numerous statements \nsince the beginning of the nationwide protests that he intends to use federal \nagents to stop protestors. \n146.  For instance, the President tweeted: “Get tough Democrat Mayors and \nGovernors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The \nWorld is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? \nNO!!!” This early suggestion that the National Guard was needed to quell actions of \nparticular political groups or protesters with political leanings, such as “anarchists,” \nmakes clear that the aim in calling in federal officers is to quell protests—not just \nthose committing crimes against property. \n147.  The President has expressed his disdain for the viewpoints of the \nprotestors: “Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the \nWhite House could hardly believe how easy it was. “A walk in the park,” one said. \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 36 of 49 PageID #:91\nThe protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY \neasily by the Guard, D.C. Police, & S.S. GREAT JOB!” \n148.  In addition, he repeatedly has expressed his view that Black Lives \nMatter is a hateful sentiment.  \n149.  The President has indicated his intention to “dominate” protestors: \n“D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. \nOverwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you \nPresident Trump!)” \n150.  The President has expressed satisfaction when protestors self-censor \nby staying home: “I have just given an order for our National Guard to start the \nprocess of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under \nperfect control. They will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far \nfewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!” \n151.  At President Trump’s rally at Mount Rushmore on July 4, 2020, he \nannounced that he was “deploying federal law enforcement to protect our \nmonuments, arrest the rioters, and prosecute offenders to the fullest extent of the \nlaw.” \n152.  In retweeting a thread which showed New York stores boarded up in \nanticipation of any violence following the continuation of nationwide protests, \nPresident Trump wrote: “The National Guard is ready!” \n153.  On July 27, 2020, the President referred to the protestors in Portland \nas “sick and deranged Anarchists & Agitators who our great men & women of Law \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 37 of 49 PageID #:92\nEnforcement easily control, but who would destroy our American cities, and worse, \nif Sleepy Joe Biden, the puppet of the Left, ever won. Markets would crash and \ncities would burn.” \n154.  In addition, he informed the governor of Oregon that “[s]he must clear \nout, and in some cases arrest, the Anarchists & Agitators in Portland,” or else “the \nFederal Government will do it for her. We will not be leaving until there is safety!” \n155.  The President’s response to the Black Lives Matter protests, and \nspecifically his insistence that they be shut down, stands in sharp contrast to his \nresponse to anti-quarantine protestors earlier his year. When armed protestors \nobjecting to COVID-19 quarantine measures rallied in the Michigan state house, \nthe President called them “very good people” and urged Michigan Governor \nGretchen Whitmer to “give a little” in response to the protestors’ objections. \nIII.  CHICAGO IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO STOP UNLAWFUL \nFEDERAL INTERVENTION \n \n156.  Chicago’s Mayor has publicly recognized the problems with the \nPresident’s secret police force, saying, “We don’t need federal agents without any \ninsignia taking people off the streets and holding them, I think, unlawfully.” \n157.  The Mayor has also recognized that an “influx” of federal agents to \nChicago is on its way. \n158.  In a July 20, 2020 letter to the President, Chicago’s Mayor stated that \nfederal agents deployed to Chicago “that would not be within our control or within \nthe direct command of the Chicago Police would spell disaster.” \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 38 of 49 PageID #:93\n159.  Chicago is already saturated with federal law enforcement agents who \nconduct duly authorized law enforcement activities in Chicago and the region on a \ndaily basis.  \n160.  A further influx of such agents in lieu of investment in the \ncommunities most affected by gun violence, police violence, and racism is \ncounterproductive, destructive, and a potentially violent disaster. \n161.  Contrary to her stated position, Chicago’s Mayor has had discussions \nwith federal authorities about the initial deployment of federal agents in Chicago, \nand on July 21, 2020, she confirmed that federal agents would be deployed to \nChicago. \n162.  On or about July 22, 2020, Chicago’s Mayor confirmed that she had \nspoken with the President about the deployment of federal agents to Chicago and \nreported “I think we have an understanding,” without an indication of the extent to \nwhich Chicago has assented to the federal illegal policies set out above. \n163.  The assent of Chicago’s Mayor to the surge of federal forces means that \nwhen the President sends federal agents to Chicago, as he did to Portland, the CPD \nand the City will be unable and unwilling to protect protestors from unlawful use of \nexcessive force and arrests without probable cause. \nIV.  PLAINTIFFS FEAR CONTINUING THEIR LAWFUL ACTIVITIES \n164.  Given the City of Chicago’s history of violence against peaceful \nprotestors, and its recent violence against protestors, the addition of federal forces \nto illegally intimidate, police, and falsely arrest peaceful protestors will ignite \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 39 of 49 PageID #:94\nadditional official violence against civilians and a serious constitutional crisis \nwithin the City of Chicago. \n165.  Indeed, recognizing these legitimate and imminent fears, State \nRepresentative Will Guzzardi, whose district overs the City of Chicago’s northwest \nside, reports that his constitutes are “terrified by the news” of impeding federal \nagents, and that some have been dissuaded from protesting. \n166.  Plaintiffs have planned frequent protests and political actions into the \nforeseeable future, including next week. Examples of their recent activities on July \n24, 25, and 26, 2020, include: a) a #LetUsBreathe rally at Freedom Square on \nFriday, July 24, 2020, across the street from the Homan Square, a police station \nnotorious for disappearing people (sometimes in conjunction with Federal DEA or \nATF agents); b) a protest organized by multiple organizations including Plaintiffs \nBLM Chicago and CDSA on Saturday, July 25, 2020 in Grant Park to support Black \nLives; c) another protest also in Grant Park on Saturday, July 25, 2020 to call for \nthe abolition of ICE. \n167.  NLG Chicago Legal Observers have observed over 50 demonstrations \nsince the end of May 2020, when nationwide protests—sparked by the murders of \nGeorge Floyd and Breonna Taylor—against systemic racism, inequality, and police \nviolence began. \n168.  Plaintiff NLG Chicago seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of \nprotestors by observing protests and obtaining information from protestors who are \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 40 of 49 PageID #:95\narrested so that they can be tracked and provided pro bono or low-cost \nrepresentation. \n169.  Plaintiff FDLA seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of \nprotesters by observing protests and obtaining information from protesters who are \narrested so that they can be tracked and provided pro bono or low-cost \nrepresentation. \n170.  Plaintiff In These Times has documented and tracked hundreds of \ninstances of violence, harassment and arrests directed toward journalists by \nmembers of law enforcement of local, state, and federal agencies throughout the \ncountry. Individual journalists employed by In These Times are aware of “less \nlethal” munitions being deployed by federal agents against journalists covering \nprotests in Portland and instances where members of the Chicago Police \nDepartment have used physical force to prevent journalists from covering protests. \n171.  Plaintiffs are aware of the activities of federal law enforcement officers \nin Portland; specifically, they are aware that federal agents have kidnapped, falsely \narrested, and brutalized protestors and NLG Legal Observers. \n172.  Plaintiffs are also aware that President Trump has deployed federal \nofficers to Chicago imminently, and that the CPD intends to work with the federal \nagents. \n173.  Plaintiffs would like to continue exercising their First Amendment \nrights of speech, assembly, observing, and newsgathering, but they fear that federal \nagents will kidnap, falsely arrest, or physically abuse them. \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 41 of 49 PageID #:96\n174.  Plaintiffs would also like to continue to engage in exercising their First \nAmendment rights without fear that federal agents will unlawfully surveil their \nactivities or infringe on their right to associate with political, activist groups. \n175.  Plaintiffs would also like to continue to engage in exercising their First \nAmendment rights without fear that federal agents will unlawfully suppress or \ninterfere with their protests. \n176.  Specifically, Plaintiff BLM Chicago has members who are not going to \nattend the protests and rallies planned for this weekend because they fear federal \nagents will kidnap, falsely arrest, or physically abuse them, as they did to \nprotestors in Portland. \n177.  In addition, Plaintiffs have had to divert their financial resources and \ntheir time to address members’ concerns that federal agents will be present at the \nplanned protests. \n178.  For example, since the President’s announcement on July 22, that \nfederal agents would be sent to Chicago, OCAD has had to redirect their staff and \nfinancial resources from organizing for participation in peaceful protests in \nsolidarity with BLM and dismantling systematic racism to preparing “Know Your \nRights” flyers and information for distribution to respond to their members’ \nconcerns that they may encounter federal agents at the protests.  \n179.  Similarly, NLG has had to redirect its resources from organizing legal \nobservers for the protests to preparing and distributing “Know Your Rights” \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 42 of 49 PageID #:97\ninformation related to inquiries from protestors about possible encounters with \nfederal agents present at protests. \n180.  Plaintiffs also fear that their speech and message is being hijacked and \ndrowned out by a new focus on protesting the presence of federal agents in Chicago.  \n181.  Plaintiffs are aware of the nightly clashes with federal agents and \nprotestors in Portland at the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse and how other groups \nhave shifted the focus of the peaceful protests from the Black Lives Matter and anti-\nracist campaign to protesting simply the presence of federal agents in the City. \n182.  Plaintiffs’ speech that has not been prevented or chilled, has been \ndiluted and drowned out by Defendants’ illegal policies outline in this complaint \nand their deployment of agents to Chicago.   \n183.  Indeed, Defendants’ actions to further the President’s political agenda \nto demonstrate that he is strong on “law and order” and denigrate “liberal cities” in \nfurtherance of his re-election campaign has resulted in not only interference with \nPlaintiffs’ anti-racist message, but it has diluted and drowned out the speech that \nhas persisted despite Defendants’ efforts to stop it. \nLEGAL CLAIMS \nCOUNT I \nInterference with Speech, Peaceful Assembly, and the Press \nIn Violation of the First Amendment \n \n184.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each of the paragraphs in this \nComplaint as if restated fully herein. \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 43 of 49 PageID #:98\n185.  Individuals who peacefully gather on the streets of Chicago to protest \nhave the right to gather, express themselves, and petition for redress of grievances \nunder the First Amendment. \n186.  Members of the press and individuals have the right to gather, receive, \nrecord, and disseminate information and news under the First Amendment. \n187.  Defendants’ actions are undertaken with the intent of discouraging \nand suppressing lawful protest and therefore constitute an illegal prior restraint on \nindividuals’ First Amendment right to peacefully protest racial inequality.  \n188.  Many individuals who are reasonably afraid of being brutalized or \npicked up and shoved into unmarked vans by federal agents will feel compelled to \nstay away, for their own personal safety, and will therefore be unable to express \nthemselves in the way that they have the right to do. \n189.  Many individuals also fear that they will be unlawfully surveilled by \nfederal agents simply for participating in these peaceful protests. \n190.  Plaintiff has also had to redirect and divert their resources to \naddressing their members’ concerns about the presence of federal agents at the \nprotests. \n191.  Relatedly, since President Trump’s July 22nd announcement of \nsending federal agents to Chicago, the purpose, message and participation of the \nprotests in Chicago shifted from a unified focus on dismantling systemic racism to \nprotestors speaking out against the deployment of federal agents in Chicago.  \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 44 of 49 PageID #:99\n192.  Prior to July 22, the protests had a sustained anti-racist, Black Lives \nMatter message and focus over the course of several months since the protests \nbegan in May. \n193.  In the manner described more fully above, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment \nrights have been and are being infringed. Their exercise of their rights to speak, \nassemble, petition, and gather news is being chilled due to the well-founded fear \nthat they will be brutalized or kidnapped by federal agents for no reason other than \nbeing a protestor, journalist, or legal observer on the streets and sidewalks of \nChicago. \nCOUNT II \nFederal Policy of Conducting False Arrests  \nIn Violation of the Fourth Amendment \n \n194.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each of the paragraphs of this \nComplaint as if restated fully herein. \n195.  The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable seizures, and in \nparticular prohibits federal officials from arresting a person without probable cause \nto believe that they have committed a federal crime. \n196.  In so doing, the Fourth Amendment also plainly prohibits “preemptive \narrests” in anticipation of a possible violation of the law. \n197.  Defendants and the federal agents discussed in this complaint are \noperating pursuant to an official federal policy, approved by responsible federal \nagency heads with final policymaking authority, of conducting arrests of individuals \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 45 of 49 PageID #:100\nwithout probable cause to believe they have committed federal crimes, including \n“preemptive arrests” of peaceful protestors, journalists, and legal observers. \n198.  Federal agents’ conduct in other cities as described above, and in \nparticular their false arrest of peaceful protestors and journalists, was caused by \nand pursuant to this unconstitutional federal policy. \n199.  No probable cause exists to believe that Plaintiffs, their members, or \nany other similarly situated protestors, legal observers, or journalists, has \ncommitted a federal crime. Plaintiffs’ anticipated participation in protests does not \nprovide probable cause to believe that a person has committed a federal crime. \n200.  In the absence of an injunction, Defendants will arrest and seize \nindividuals off the streets in Chicago without probable cause, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment, pursuant to official federal policy. \nCOUNT III \n28 U.S.C. § 2201 \nDeclaration of Rights \n \n201.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the paragraphs of the complaint as if \nrestated fully herein. \n202.  In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, any court of the \nUnited States may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested \nparty seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought, \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2201. \n203.  There is an actual controversy within the jurisdiction of this court, \ninasmuch as one or more federal defendants have engaged in actions endangering \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 46 of 49 PageID #:101\nPlaintiffs and others assembled on Chicago’s streets. No federal authority has \nagreed to stop this practice. \n204.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the acts at issue are \nunlawful, and an injunction precluding Defendants from continuing in them. \nCOUNT IV \n \nConspiracy \n \n205.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the paragraphs of this complaint as if \nrestated fully herein. \n206.  Defendants, acting in concert with other co-conspirators, known and \nunknown, reached an agreement among themselves to deprive Plaintiffs of their \nconstitutional rights, all as described in the various paragraphs of this Complaint. \n207.  In so doing, these co-conspirators conspired to accomplish an unlawful \npurpose by unlawful means. In addition, these co-conspirators agreed among \nthemselves to protect one another from liability for depriving Plaintiffs of these \nrights. \n208.  In furtherance of their conspiracy, each of these co-conspirators \ncommitted overt acts and were otherwise willful participants in joint activity. \n209.  The misconduct described herein was undertaken intentionally, in \ntotal disregard of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n \n \n \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 47 of 49 PageID #:102\nCOUNT V \nTenth Amendment \n210.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the paragraphs of this complaint as if \nrestated fully herein. \n211.  By conducting traditional law enforcement activities on the streets and \nsidewalks of Chicago, Defendants are encroaching upon powers explicitly reserved \nto the State of Illinois, and to Illinois’s citizens, pursuant to the Tenth Amendment. \n212.  Defendants conduct such law enforcement activities under color of \nfederal law. \n213.  Each Plaintiff has standing to bring this claim because each has \nsuffered cognizable injuries that are redressable through injunctive relief, and the \nTenth Amendment confers a substantive, personal right. \n214.  There is no adequate remedy under state law. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  Wherefore, Plaintiffs pray for a judgment and the following relief: \n1.  A declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint restrain Plaintiffs’ ability to assemble in peaceful \nprotest, observing, and news gathering, in violation of the First Amendment; \n2.  A declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint constitute a federal unlawful policy of committing \narrests without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment; \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 48 of 49 PageID #:103\n3.  A declaration, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint present an imminent threat that Plaintiffs will be \narrested without probable cause, by unidentified federal agents, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment; and \n4.  An injunction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2202 and 5 U.S.C. § 702, \npermanently enjoining the Defendants from engaging in the federal actions \ndescribed in this complaint, and specifically requiring that the Defendants and their \nofficers and agents: \na.  Refrain from interfering in or otherwise policing lawful and peaceful \nassemblies and protests in the City of Chicago; \nb.  Cease enforcement of their unlawful policy of conducting arrests \nwithout probable cause to believe a federal crime has been committed \nand conducting “preemptive arrests”; \nc.  Refrain from arresting individuals in the City of Chicago without \nprobable cause to believe that a federal crime has been committed; \nd.  Identify themselves and their agency before detaining or arresting any \nperson off the streets of Chicago; \ne.  Explain to any person detained or arrested that the person is being \ndetained or arrested and explain the basis for that action; and \nf.  Any other relief this Court deems proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBLACK LIVES MATTER \nCHICAGO, et al. \n \nBy: /s/ Theresa Kleinhaus    \nOne of Plaintiffs’ Attorneys \n \nJon Loevy   \nHeather Lewis Donnell   \nSteve Art     \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-04319 Document #: 9 Filed: 07/31/20 Page 49 of 49 PageID #:104\nTheresa Kleinhaus   Elizabeth Wang \nJulia Rickert  LOEVY & LOEVY     \nLindsay Hagy  2060 Broadway, Ste. 460 \nRuth Brown  Boulder, CO 80302 \nSean Starr  (720) 328-5642 \nLOEVY & LOEVY   \n311 N.
