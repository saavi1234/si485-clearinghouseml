    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit was filed on July 22, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon by four individual plaintiffs represented by the ACLU Foundation of Oregon and private counsel. The complaint arose out of the protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020. After Mr. Floyd's killing protests broke out across the country condemning what happened to Mr. Floyd, police brutality, and racial inequality more generally. While the protests were mostly peaceful, there was some violence and property destruction at certain protests. By mid-July, President Trump deployed federal law enforcement against protesters in Portland, threatening to do the same in other cities as well. These law enforcement agents had neither their own names nor agency names attached to their uniforms.</p>\r\n<p>The four plaintiffs in this case were all individuals with medical training who were using that training to assist people injured during the protests. They brought suit against the City of Portland, one named Portland police officer, sixty unnamed Portland police officers, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Marshals Service, and forty unnamed federal law enforcement agents. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were engaging in behavior that violated the First Amendment by having a \"chilling effect\" on the plaintiffs' speech. Furthermore, they alleged that the defendants' use of chemical weapons, semi-lethal projectiles, and riot batons against peaceful protesters represented excessive use of force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Finally, the complaint asserts that the federal defendants were acting arbitrarily and capriciously in using anti-protest tactics, thereby violating the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought injunctive relief and declaratory relief. They also sought compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees and costs. Two days after filing the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against the federal and municipal defendants.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Karin J. Immergut.</p>\r\n<p>Before the court held a hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order, the federal defendants announced an intention to reduce their presence in Portland. Shortly after, the plaintiffs filed withdrew their motion.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, the plaintiffs submitted a second motion for a temporary restraining order against the municipal defendants and order to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not be entered against the municipal defendants. On September 2, 2020, Judge Immergut issued her ruling. 2020 WL 5231486. She denied the motion, finding that the the plaintiffs did not allege sufficient facts and legal support to warrant specialized treatment for protest medics. She also held that the TRO was unworkable in practice, given the chaotic circumstances of the protests and that the line between protest medic and protester was not sufficiently clear.</p>\r\n<p>On May 15, 2021, Judge Immergut dismissed plaintiffs' claim for equitable relief against federal defendants sued in their official capacity. 539 F.Supp.3d 1132. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear these claims for lack of standing and mootness. But the court's opinion did not extend beyond the plaintiffs' claims for equitable relief; their <em>Bivens</em> action for damages was not at issue. First, regarding standing, the court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue prospective relief because they did not plead facts showing that the harm (intentional targeting and retaliation of protest medics at the hands of federal defendants) was certainly impending, or that there was a substantial risk the harm would occur. Second, even if the plaintiffs did have standing, changed circumstances rendered plaintiffs' equitable claims moot. Plaintiffs' equitable claims were based largely on the public statements of Trump Administration officials, but those claims were mooted by the election of President Joe Biden.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs responded the May 15 dismissal by filing an amended complaint of November 5. They removed John Doe officers rom the Portland Police Bureau, DHS, the U.S. Marshal service, and John Doe officers from the federal government. But it added a detective with the Portland Police Bureau. Plaintiffs also removed their claims against the federal defendants.</p>\r\n<p>This case is on-going as of May 1, 2022.</p>",

The plaintiffs sued the City of Portland and federal law enforcement for violation of their First and Fourth Amendment rights, claiming that they were illegally attacked while peacefully protesting. They also argued that the federal law enforcement's tactics represented a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. They also sought attorney's fees and costs. Judge Immergut denied the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order against the municipal defendants on September 2, 2020. But on May 15, 2021, Judge Immergut dismissed plaintiffs' claims against the federal defendants.

PETTEY, JOHN DOES 1-60, \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHOMELAND SECURITY, UNITED \nSTATES MARSHALS SERVICE, JOHN \nDOES 61-100,  \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nIMMERGUT, District Judge. \n \nBefore this Court is Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) \npursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs are four individuals who \nserve as “protest medics” at demonstrations against racial violence in downtown Portland. They \nseek an order with respect to the City of Portland, Officer Stephen B. Pettey, and John Does 1-60 \n(“Municipal Defendants”) that shall expire fourteen days after entry, unless extended by a \nPAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 2 of 23\nstipulation of the parties or by further order of the court. The requested order would enjoin the \nMunicipal Defendants from:  \n(1) arresting, threatening to arrest, or using physical force directed against any person \nthey know or reasonably should know is a protest medic, unless authorized under Or. \nRev. Stat. § 133.235 or Or. Rev. Stat. § 133.245;  \n(2) using physical force directly or indirectly targeted at a protest medic when the medic \nis providing medical care to an individual and poses no threat to the lives or safety of the \npublic or police;  \n(3) requiring properly identified protest medics to disperse or move with demonstrators \nfollowing the issuance of an order to disperse or move when the medic is providing \nmedical care to an individual, and prohibiting Municipal Defendants from using the \nprotest medic’s decision not to disperse or move as any basis to establish that the medic \nhas committed a crime;  \n(4) seizing any medical equipment or other materials necessary for the protest medics to \nadminister medical care, unless Municipal Defendants are lawfully seizing the protest \nmedic; and \n(5) ordering a protest medic to stop treating an individual, or ordering a protest medic to \ndisperse or move when they are treating an individual, unless Municipal Defendants are \nlawfully seizing that person. ECF 35 at ¶¶ 2–6.  \nOn September 1, 2020, this Court held oral argument. After considering the pleadings, \ndeclarations, exhibits and arguments of counsel, this Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to show \nsufficient facts and adequate legal support to warrant providing protest medics unique \nexemptions from lawful dispersal orders, or specialized treatment different from that of their \nPAGE 2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 3 of 23\nfellow protesters. Further, the particular TRO sought in this case is unworkable when \nconsidering the totality of the chaotic circumstances that have been described by all parties in \nthis case. In finding that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to obtain the extraordinary remedy \nof a mandatory injunction, this Court does not seek to discredit or diminish the efforts of the \nprotest medics, or question their right to participate in the protests. Nor is this Court ruling on the \nmerits of Plaintiffs’ underlying claims, which will be further developed through discovery.  \nFor the reasons that follow, Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, ECF \n35, is DENIED. \nBACKGROUND  \nGeorge Floyd’s tragic killing on May 25, 2020 sparked national and international protests \nin support of Black lives and against systemic racism in American policing. In Portland, these \nprotests have continued for almost one hundred days. While thousands of protesters have \nremained peaceful, a smaller number of protesters have engaged in vandalism, destroyed \nproperty, and committed acts of violence. Russell Decl., ECF 17-1 at ¶ 3; see also Don’t Shoot \nPortland v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-00917-HZ, 2020 WL 3078329 (D. Or. June 9, 2020), \nPassadore Decl., ECF 118 at ¶¶ 25–60 (describing destructive and violent acts by protesters on \nJune 25, 2020 and June 30, 2020). Over the past few months, various crowd dispersal tactics \nhave been used at the protests, including rubber bullets, impact munitions, and other forms of \nforce. Id. at ¶¶ 8, 9. Although the City of Portland initially used tear gas as a dispersal technique, \nthat dispersal method was limited by a temporary restraining order issued on June 9, 2020 in \nDon’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-00917-HZ, 2020 WL 3078329 (D. Or. \nJune 9, 2020). Those restrictions remain in effect today.1  \n                                                 \n1 On July 14, 2020, based on a joint request by the parties, Chief United States District \nJudge Marco A. Hernandez extended the temporary restraining order restrictions in their current \nPAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 4 of 23\nPlaintiffs are “protest medics” who attend public demonstrations in Portland to provide \nsupport, comfort, and medical aid to protesters. Plaintiffs hail from a diverse array of \nbackgrounds and medical training.2 Protest medics, as defined in the TRO, have no required \nuniform or dress, but identify themselves as medics through marks on their clothing—such as \npainting the word “medic” on their backs, or affixing a red-cross symbol with duct-tape to their \narms and chest. See ECF 35 at ¶ 1. They often also carry medical supplies on their person and in \nbackpacks.  \nThe protest medics provide a range of services, including rendering basic medical aid to \ninjured protesters, carrying injured persons to safety, providing water and food, and providing \nmoral support. Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶¶ 10 (dancing to keep spirits high), ¶ 13 (dressing \nlacerations), ¶ 21 (applying pressure to injured protester Donavan LaBella’s wound until the \narrival of an ambulance); Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶ 15 (wrapping injured protester Donavan \nLaBella’s wound with gauze before helping to transport him to an ambulance); Paul Decl., ECF \n8 at ¶ 9 (cleaning eye wound); Hubbard Decl., ECF 10 at ¶ 7 (washing out the eyes of protester \nwho was pepper sprayed); Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 12 (providing eye wash to protesters after \nexposure to tear gas); Shifflett Decl., ECF 37 at ¶ 10 (attempting to carry an injured protester out \nof harm’s way). Protest medics also hand out supplies such as eye wash and eye wipes in \nanticipation of tear gas, and masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19. \nMartinez Decl., ECF 9 at ¶ 23. The most common police-inflicted injuries the protest medics \nhave seen in the Portland protests is exposure to tear gas. Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 12. \n                                                 \nform until further order of the court. Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-\n00917-HZ, ECF 133.  \n2 Based on the declarations provided, none of the plaintiffs appear to currently be \nlicensed medical professionals in the state of Oregon.  \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 5 of 23\nPlaintiffs allege Municipal Defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments by \ntargeting them in retaliation for serving as protest medics, using excessive force against \nPlaintiffs, and unlawfully seizing the property of protest medics. ECF 1 at ¶¶ 4, 186–87. \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs contend that supporting protesters as protest medics constitutes \nexpressive conduct protected by the First Amendment, and Municipal Defendants infringe on \ntheir right of free speech by ordering Plaintiffs to leave an area pursuant to lawful dispersal \norders while they provide medical aid. Id. at ¶ 184. Plaintiffs have not challenged the lawfulness \nof the dispersal orders. Plaintiffs therefore raise the narrow issue of whether protest medics, as \ndefined by the TRO, should effectively receive special dispensation under the First Amendment \nto remain in areas where police have issued lawful dispersal orders.  \nPlaintiffs previously filed for a TRO against both Federal and Municipal Defendants on \nJuly 24, 2020. ECF 4. Before this Court held a hearing on the motion, Federal Defendants \nannounced an intention to reduce their presence in Portland. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs \nwithdrew their TRO motion. ECF 24. On August 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this second motion for \na TRO solely against Municipal Defendants. ECF 35.3 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n  Plaintiff Christopher Wise completed training at Southwestern Oregon Community \nCollege to be an emergency medical technician (“EMT”). Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶ 2. Although \nnot certified as an EMT, Plaintiff Wise has certifications for Basic Life Support (“BLS”) and \nCPR for Healthcare Workers. Id. Since June 2, 2020, Plaintiff Wise has regularly attended \n                                                 \n3 At oral argument, Plaintiffs and Municipal Defendants agreed the Court can consider \nthe supporting declarations for the initial TRO in evaluating Plaintiffs’ second TRO as well as \nthose filed in Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-00917-HZ, 2020 WL \n3078329 (D. Or. June 9, 2020).  \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 6 of 23\ndemonstrations as a protest medic. Id. at ¶ 7. While serving as a medic, Plaintiff Wise displays \nbright orange or pink duct-taped crosses on his outermost layer of clothing on his chest and each \nof his shoulders. Id. at ¶ 9. He also has the word “medic” spray painted in red lettering across his \nback. Id. \nPlaintiff Michael Martinez has been a graduate student at Oregon Health & Sciences \nUniversity (“OHSU”) since the fall of 2019, in a doctoral program for Medical and Molecular \nGenetics. Martinez Decl., ECF 9 at ¶ 2. He has attended the Portland protests several times as a \nprotest medic with a group organized by OHSU faculty and graduate students. Id. at ¶¶ 19, 21, \n22. The OHSU group sets up a medic station with a variety of medical supplies including gauze, \nbandages, antibiotic ointments, tape, ear plugs, over-the-counter pain medications, and eye wash \nsolutions. Id. at ¶ 23. The station also offers snacks, water, and COVID-19 related supplies such \nas masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer. Id. Because Plaintiff Martinez has only basic first aid \ntraining, he generally assists medics with higher levels of training by providing supplies. Id. at ¶ \n26. He has also provided food and water to protestors as part of his role as a protest medic. Id. at \n¶ 22. \n  Plaintiff Christopher Durkee previously worked in Los Angeles County as an EMT and \nemergency dispatcher for five years. Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 2. He has also worked at a \npsychiatric hospital in some capacity. Id. at ¶ 2. Plaintiff Durkee serves as a protest medic with a \npartner, Plaintiff Savannah Guest. Id. at ¶ 12; Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 9. Plaintiff Guest \npreviously worked as a volunteer emergency medical responder for emergency medical services \nin Powhatan, Virginia for 1.5 years. Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 2. She is not trained as an EMT, \nbut she is CPR, First Aid, and Automated External Defibrillator (“AED”) certified. Id. While \nattending the protests, both Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest wear dark-colored clothes with high-\nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 7 of 23\ngloss, red duct tape in the shape of crosses on the front and back of their clothing. Durkee Decl., \nECF 5 at ¶ 9; Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 7. They also wear shoulder patches with crosses and \ndisplay the word “medic” on their backpacks. Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 9; Guest Decl., ECF 11 \nat ¶ 7.  \nB.  Protests \nThe Portland protests initially centered around the downtown area near the Multnomah \nCounty Justice Center, the Portland Police Bureau’s North and Central Precincts, and the Mark \nO. Hatfield United States Courthouse. Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 9. Demonstrations have \nalso occurred near the Portland Police Association Union Hall in Northeast Portland and the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Southwest Portland. Id. Most recently, \ndemonstrations have also been held at Multnomah County’s Penumbra Kelly Building and the \nPortland Police Bureau’s East Precinct. Id. Several of these buildings are in or near residential \nneighborhoods. Id.  \nAlthough many demonstrators have peacefully assembled, declarations submitted by the \nparties demonstrate that the protests have regularly escalated into dangerous scenarios for the \ncommunity, law enforcement, as well as protesters, particularly during the late hours of the night \nand into the early mornings.4 See Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 9. For example, Federal \nDefendants allege that in the early morning hours of July 3, 2020, a group of individuals \nsmashed the glass in the doors of the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse, threw balloons containing an \n                                                 \n4 Both law enforcement officers and protesters have been injured during altercations at \nthe protests. Most recently, although not part of the declarations submitted, the protests turned \ndeadly when someone was shot and killed in downtown Portland on August 29, 2020. Eder \nCampuzano, 1 man shot, killed near downtown Portland protests Saturday, THE OREGONIAN \n(Aug. 30, 2020), https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/1-person-shot-killed-near-\ndowntown-portland-protests-saturday.html. \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 8 of 23\naccelerant liquid into the lobby, then fired commercial fireworks towards the accelerant in an \napparent attempt to start a fire. Russell Decl., ECF 17-1 at ¶ 6.  \nFederal Defendants also describe further violence which occurred on July 11, 2020. That \nnight there were approximately 300 protesters around the Courthouse. Id. at ¶ 8. A barrier of \npolice tape was placed across the front of the Hatfield Courthouse and protesters were ordered \nnot to trespass onto federal property. Id. When an individual refused to comply with that \ncommand, federal officers deployed and made an arrest for trespass. Id. While the officers were \nmaking the arrest, a crowd of individuals swarmed them. Id. Officers deployed less-lethal \nprojectile rounds into the crowd, and the crowd responded by throwing rocks, glass bottles, and \nfireworks at the officers. Id. Tear gas was then deployed as officers withdrew to the courthouse. \nId.   \nOn the night of July 19, 2020, a crowd of over 1,000 protesters demonstrated in the \ndowntown area near the Hatfield Courthouse. Id. at ¶ 12. Federal Defendants allege the \nprotesters removed fencing from around the courthouse and again attempted to set fire to the \nbuilding. Id. Additionally, protesters are alleged to have shot commercial grade fireworks at law \nenforcement. Id. Officers used dispersal tactics to move the crowd off federal property. Id. \nMore recently, on the night of August 4, 2020, a protest of approximately 200 individuals \nmarched from Peninsula Park to the Portland Police Association located in Northeast Portland. \nDobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 19. Protesters allegedly lit a large dumpster on fire near the \nPortland Police Association office while chanting that they wanted to burn down the building. Id. \nMunicipal Defendants further allege protesters attempted to break into the building several times \nand lit a Molotov cocktail. Id. Furthermore, one protester allegedly pulled out a firearm and shot \nit several times after engaging in a fist fight with another protester. Id. \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 9 of 23\nProtesters again marched from Peninsula Park to the Portland Police Association on \nAugust 8, 2020. Id. at ¶ 21. Members of the crowd of roughly 500 protesters moved dumpsters \nonto the street and lit them on fire. Id. Municipal Defendants allege demonstrators attempted to \nbreak into the Portland Police Association office that night by breaking windows and disabling \nthe security cameras. Id.  \nOn the night of August 20, and the early morning August 21, 2020, roughly 200 to 250 \nprotesters gathered around the ICE building, located near a residential neighborhood. Municipal \nDefendants allege members of the crowd threw rocks, hammers, and fireworks at law \nenforcement officers. Id. at ¶ 22. Protesters also allegedly sprayed graffiti, kicked doors, and \nbroke windows. Id. \nYet another night, on August 23, 2020, there was a demonstration near the Portland \nPolice Bureau’s North Precinct with over 200 protesters. Id. at ¶ 23. Municipal Defendants allege \nmembers of the crowd threw rocks, bottles, and other projectiles at law enforcement officers. \nMunicipal Defendants also allege some members of the crowd “threw a commercial mortar on to \nthe North Precinct roof, and lit the [northwest] corner awning of the Precinct building on fire.” \nId.  \nDuring the demonstrations, officers protecting the municipal and federal properties allege \nthey have been “subject to threats, rocks and ball bearings fired with wrist rockets, improvised \nexplosives, aerial fireworks, and commercial grade mortars, high intensity lasers targeting \nofficer’s eyes, thrown rocks, full and empty glass bottles, and balloons filled with paint and other \nsubstances such as feces.” Russell Decl., ECF 17-1 at ¶ 4. One protester is alleged to have struck \nan officer in the head and shoulder with a two-pound sledgehammer when the officer tried to \nprevent the protester from breaking into the Hatfield Courthouse. Id.  \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 10 of 23\nOver the course of the past few months, the Portland Police Bureau (“PPB”) has \nfrequently declared protests in Portland to be unlawful assemblies. See, e.g., Dobson Supp. \nDecl., ECF 43 at ¶¶ 19–23; Don’t Shoot Portland v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-00917-HZ, \n2020 WL 3078329 (D. Or. June 9, 2020), Dobson Decl., ECF 105. Since July 25, 2020, the \nPortland Police Bureau (“PPB”) has declared a riot under state law eight times. Id. at ¶ 11. Once \nan unlawful assembly or riot has been declared, the PPB has authority under Oregon law to \ndisperse the group, and arrest those who fail to comply with police orders. See Or. Rev. Stat. \n§ 131.675. Once dispersal orders have been given, it is important for the safe management of \ncrowd control operations that protesters comply. Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 14. When \npeople fail to disperse, they are potentially interfering with a police tactical operation. Id.   \nPlaintiffs provide declarations that describe the police response to the protests. Plaintiffs \nallege they and other medics suffered injuries from crowd control tactics such as chemical \nirritants and less-lethal munitions deployed by Defendants.5 See, e.g., Martinez Decl., ECF 9 at ¶ \n32; Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 20; Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 15; Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶¶ 22–26, \n28, 30. They argue these injuries evince an effort on the part of law enforcement to target the \nmedics. The harms Plaintiffs allege they experienced have generally happened in the aftermath \nof a dispersal order while officers are trying to clear the area.  \nFor example, Plaintiff Wise alleges on June 2, 2020, he was shot in the shin with a rubber \nbullet while attempting to pull another fallen protester out of a recently deployed cloud of tear \ngas. Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶ 22. Plaintiff Wise also alleges a Portland police officer forcefully \nshoved him down on the night of July 4, 2020, injuring his shoulder and hand. Id. at ¶ 26. \n                                                 \n5 It is unclear whether some of the alleged harms described in Plaintiffs’ declarations are \nattributed to Federal or Municipal Defendants. \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 11 of 23\nPlaintiff Guest alleges on July 4, 2020, she was shot with a projectile, checked in the shoulder \nwith a baton, and forcibly pushed by law enforcement officers. Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 15. \nPlaintiff Durkee alleges that an officer checked him from behind with a baton on that same night. \nDurkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 20. Plaintiff Guest also alleges she was shot three times with rubber \nbullets on July 19, 2020 while trying to approach a protester suffering from tear gas exposure. \nGuest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 29. \nPlaintiff Durkee alleges on July 11, 2020, and into the early morning of July 12, 2020, he \nand Plaintiff Guest were attempting to move injured people out of the street and away from \nincoming federal officers, who responded by firing tear gas canisters and pepper balls at them. \nDurkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 22. Plaintiff Guest alleges she was also pushed by those federal officers \nand struck with their batons that same night after they refused to allow her to provide aid to \nsomeone lying on the ground during a dispersal order. Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶¶ 19–20. \nPlaintiffs Martinez and Wise also allege they were unlawfully singled out and arrested by \nMunicipal Defendants. Plaintiff Martinez alleges that on June 13, 2020, he was arrested while \nworking at the OHSU medic station after starting to film the officers while they attempted to \nclear the area. This occurred after a dispersal order was announced. Martinez Decl., ECF 9 at ¶¶ \n33–39. Plaintiff Wise alleges that while serving as a protest medic on August 20, 2020, through \nthe early morning of August 21, 2020, he was unlawfully arrested while walking among a group \nof protesters who were complying with a police dispersal order. Wise Supp. Decl., ECF 38 at ¶ 4.  \nSTANDARD \nIn deciding whether to grant a motion for a temporary restraining order, courts look to \nsubstantially the same factors that apply to a court’s decision on whether to issue a preliminary \ninjunction. See Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. \n2001). A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction generally must show that: (1) he or she is \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 12 of 23\nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in his or her favor; and (4) that an injunction is \nin the public interest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Like a \npreliminary injunction, a temporary restraining order is an “extraordinary remedy that may only \nbe awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Id. at 22.  \n  The Ninth Circuit applies a “sliding scale” approach in considering the factors outlined in \nWinter. A stronger showing of one element of the preliminary injunction test may offset a \nweaker showing of another. All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131–32 (9th \nCir. 2011). Thus, “when the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor, the plaintiff \nneed demonstrate only ‘serious questions going to the merits.’” hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp., \n938 F.3d 985, 992 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting All. for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1135). \nFinally, the already high standard for granting a TRO or preliminary injunction is \nfurther heightened when the type of injunction sought is a “mandatory injunction.” Garcia v. \nGoogle, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (noting that the burden is “doubly demanding” \nfor a mandatory injunction). To obtain a mandatory injunction, a plaintiff must “establish that the \nlaw and facts clearly favor her position, not simply that she is likely to succeed.” Id. (emphasis in \noriginal). As explained by the Ninth Circuit: \nA preliminary injunction can take two forms. A prohibitory \ninjunction prohibits a party from taking action and preserves the \nstatus quo pending a determination of the action on the merits.” A \nmandatory injunction orders a responsible party to take action. A \nmandatory injunction goes well beyond simply maintaining the \nstatus quo pendente lite and is particularly disfavored. In general, \nmandatory injunctions are not granted unless extreme or very \nserious damage will result and are not issued in doubtful cases or \nwhere the injury complained of is capable of compensation in \ndamages. \nThe status quo ante litem referenced in Chalk means the last, \nuncontested status which preceded the pending controversy. \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 13 of 23\nMarlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 878–79 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original). \nDISCUSSION \nA.  TRO Factors \n1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \na. First Amendment Claim \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment claim alleges Municipal Defendants unlawfully retaliated \nagainst them for serving as protest medics. ECF 1 at ¶¶ 182–188, 201–213. The First \nAmendment prohibits governmental officials from retaliating against individuals for engaging in \nconstitutionally protected speech. Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006). In order to \nprevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, Plaintiffs must show that: (1) they engaged in a \nconstitutionally protected activity; (2) the Municipal Defendants’ actions would “chill a person \nof ordinary firmness” from continuing to engage in the activity; and (3) Plaintiffs’ engagement in \nprotected speech was a “substantial or motivating factor” in the Municipal Defendants’ conduct. \nO’Brien v. Welty, 818 F.3d 920, 932 (9th Cir. 2016).  \nPlaintiffs allege that rendering medical aid to protesters is a constitutionally protected \nform of expressive conduct. ECF 1 at ¶ 184. To be sure, First Amendment protection of speech \n“does not end at the spoken or written word.” Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404 (1989). \nConstitutional protection extends also to expressive conduct. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & \nInst’l Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 66 (2006). But to merit First Amendment protection, the conduct \nmust be “inherently expressive.” Id. Whether expressive conduct constitutes a protected form of \nspeech depends on whether the conduct “is intended to convey a ‘particularized message’ and the \nlikelihood is great that the message would be so understood.” Corales v. Bennett, 567 F.3d 554, \n562 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Nunez v. Davis, 169 F.3d 1222, 1226 (9th Cir. 1999)). Expressive \nPAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 14 of 23\nconduct need not convey a specific message. Hurley v. Irish–Am., Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual \nGroup of Boston, etc., 515 U.S. 557, 569 (1995). The critical question is whether a reasonable \nobserver would interpret the conduct as some sort of message. Id. \nPlaintiffs contend that they exercise their right of free speech by “providing care and \nsupport to the protesters demonstrating for the cause of equal treatment and absolute equality \nunder the law.” ECF 35 at 12. Certainly, participating in a protest is expressive conduct “clearly \nprotected by the First Amendment,” Collins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d 1363, 1371 (9th Cir. 1996), but \nPlaintiffs assert the novel position that “rendering medical aid to support and advance a protest is \nitself a form of constitutionally protected expression.” ECF 35 at 25. Additionally, Plaintiffs ask \nthis Court to allow them to essentially disregard dispersal orders so they may provide aid to \ninjured protesters. Although Plaintiffs’ goal of providing aid to protesters is undoubtedly \nadmirable, this Court has found no legal authority for affording protest medics, as defined by \nPlaintiffs, unique recognition under the First Amendment beyond that afforded any individual \nwho attends a protest.6 Protest medics may continue to protest, and provide medical aid during \nthe protests. They simply have no unique status under the First Amendment that allows them to \ndisregard lawful orders. \n                                                 \n6 Plaintiffs primarily rely on two cases—Fort Lauderdale Food Not Bombs v. City of Fort \nLauderdale, 901 F.3d 1235 (11th Cir. 2018) and Abay v. City of Denver, 445 F. Supp. 3d 1286 \n(D. Colo. 2020)—for their assertion that serving as a protest medic is expressive conduct. \nNeither of these cases are precedential to this Court. Furthermore, these cases have not made \nclear that acting as a protest medic, as described in this case, constitutes expressive conduct. In \nAbay, the district court grouped the analysis of the alleged excessive force used against \nprotesters, protest medics, and journalists. 445 F. Supp. 3d at 1292. Nowhere did the court \nrecognize that participating in a protest as a medic is a distinct type of expressive conduct. In \nFood Not Bombs, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that an organization’s act of providing free \nfood to the public constituted expressive conduct after noting that the group posted signs and \ndistributed literature at the events which distinguished its food sharing from every day activities. \n901 F.3d at 1242. Accordingly, the facts in that case are not sufficiently analogous to the issues \nbefore this Court. \nPAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 15 of 23\nRegardless, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the Municipal Defendants’ actions were \nmotivated by their status as protest medics sufficient to satisfy the third prong of a First \nAmendment retaliation claim. Plaintiffs argue that Municipal Defendants “indiscriminately, and \nat close range, unleashed chemical irritants, deployed munitions, and engaged in physical \nviolence specifically against them,” despite visible markings identifying them as medics. ECF 4 \nat 30–31. But Plaintiffs admittedly lack a distinct uniform, instead identifying themselves \nprimarily with crosses taped or painted onto ordinary clothing. This lack of uniformity cuts \nagainst the proposition that protest medics are readily identifiable, especially when considering \nthe chaotic situations where officers must distinguish between protest medics and other \nprotesters through split-second judgments.  \nPlaintiffs also concede that they often position themselves right next to protesters in areas \nwhich pose the most risk of harm, rather than standing apart from the crowd. See Durkee Decl., \nECF 5 at ¶¶ 14–15 (stating that Plaintiff Durkee and Plaintiff Guest work in the “front line” \nduring stationary moments and the “back line” during dispersals because those areas present a \nclear danger of injury); Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶ 29 (describing that declarant was standing behind \n“a group of protestors who formed a line with physical shields” facing “federal law enforcement \nofficers”); Rivera Decl., ECF 36 at ¶ 15 (relating declarant’s participation in forming a wall \nbetween protesters and police with other non-medic, military veteran protesters after the PPB \nmade an unlawful assembly announcement). \nFurthermore, in many of the described instances of harm, the protest medics were not in \nthe act of providing medical aid such that their unique role would be obvious to the outside \nobserver. See, e.g., Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶ 25 (describing a PPB officer spraying “bear mace” at \ndeclarant in close proximity while declarant was attempting to pull a protester away from another \nPAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 16 of 23\nPPB officer), ¶ 29 (stating that declarant was standing behind “a group of protestors who formed \na line with physical shields” facing “federal law enforcement officers” when a law enforcement \nofficer “shot a tear gas canister at [declarant’s] head”); Guest Decl., ECF 11 at  ¶¶ 19–20 \n(describing being pushed and jabbed with a baton while federal agents were dispersing an area). \nAccordingly, on balance, Plaintiffs have not shown they were retaliated against because they \nexercised a First Amendment Right. \nMany, if not all, of the instances of alleged targeting appear to occur when protest medics \nrefuse to follow police dispersal orders. See, e.g., Guest Decl., ECF 11 ¶¶ 18–20 (being pushed \nwhile federal agents were dispersing an area after deciding to “stand our ground to try to assist \nthe injured person, despite the incoming federal officers”); Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 25 (stating a \nfederal law enforcement officer struck him with a baton and another tackled him from the side \nwhile agents were trying to disperse the area). It is well established that protected speech can be \nregulated. Regulation of speech is justified “if it furthers an important or substantial \ngovernmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free \nexpression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater \nthan is essential to the furtherance of that interest.” United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376–\n377 (1968). As previously noted, under Oregon law, Portland police have authority to disperse \nunlawful or riotous assemblies and arrest those who do not immediately comply. Or. Rev. Stat. \n§ 131.675. Portland police are entitled to use some level of reasonable force under the \ncircumstances to effectuate the dispersal. See Barney v. City of Eugene, 20 F. App’x 683, 685 \n(9th Cir. 2001).  \nPAGE 16 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 17 of 23\nIn sum, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their \nFirst Amendment claim, let alone shown that “the law and facts clearly favor [their] position,” as \nrequired to obtain a mandatory injunction. Garcia, 786 F.3d at 740 (emphasis in original). \nb. Fourth Amendment Claim \nPlaintiffs’ central Fourth Amendment claim alleges Municipal Defendants used excessive \nforce in targeting the protest medics.7 ECF 35 at 12–13 (“the Portland Police are continuing to \nuse excessive force to retaliate against Plaintiffs and numerous other protest medics for \nproviding medical aid to protesters who the police themselves injure”); id. at 39–43. All claims \nof excessive force are analyzed under the Fourth Amendment’s “reasonableness” standard, using \nthe framework the Supreme Court set forth in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989). The \nobjective reasonableness standard balances: (1) the nature and quality of the intrusion on the \nindividual’s Fourth Amendment interests against (2) the countervailing governmental interests at \nstake. Id. “The ‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective \nof a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Id. Further, \nto obtain an injunction, Plaintiffs must show law enforcement’s use of force was targeted against \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs also claim the PPB unlawfully seized medical equipment and materials from a medic \nstation at which Plaintiff Martinez was volunteering on June 13, 2020. ECF 35 at 44–45. Even \nassuming Plaintiffs have stated a Fourth Amendment unlawful seizure claim, this appears to be \nat most one of two isolated incidents in which protest medic property was seized over the course \nof several months. See Shifflett Decl., ECF 37 at ¶ 11 (alleging on July 4, 2020, a police officer \n“dumped [declarant’s] medical-supply bag into the street.”). This Court finds that Plaintiffs have \nnot met their burden to demonstrate any future risk of irreparable injury related to the unlawful \nseizure of property. Plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief on this basis fail.  \nPAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 18 of 23\nthem because they were protest medics, and therefore they are likely to suffer irreparable harm. \nSee City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983). \nPlaintiffs allege they experienced multiple injuries at the hands of Municipal Defendants \nfrom crowd control tactics such as chemical irritants and less-lethal munitions. Martinez Decl., \nECF 9 at ¶ 32; Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 20; Guest Decl., ECF 11 at ¶ 15; Wise Decl., ECF 6 ¶¶ \n22–26, 28, 30. A Fourth Amendment excessive force analysis is a highly particularized inquiry \nto be determined by assessing the “totality of the circumstances,” Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. \n1, 8–9 (1985), with consideration of the surrounding context of each interaction, Nelson v. City \nof Davis, 685 F.3d 867, 886 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nWhile some of these alleged instances do raise serious questions about the merits of the \nexcessive force claims, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that “the law and facts clearly favor \n[their] position,” as required to obtain a mandatory injunction at this time. Garcia, 786 F.3d at \n740 (emphasis in original). Many of the alleged instances of excessive force occurred while \npolice were attempting to clear an area through a dispersal order. See, e.g., Wise Decl., ECF 6 at \n¶ 22 (describing being shot in the shin with a rubber bullet while attempting to pull another fallen \nprotester out of a recently deployed cloud of tear gas). In other allegations, the context of the \nsurrounding circumstances is entirely unclear. See Martinez Decl., ECF 9 at ¶ 32 (explaining that \n“[w]hile serving as a protest medic, [declarant has] been shoved, shot at, and tear gassed” \nwithout providing any further context). Plaintiffs claim they were targeted, but as previously \nmentioned, their appearance would not make them obviously distinguishable from others, \nparticularly in the dark amongst a large crowd. Further, Plaintiffs often position themselves \ndirectly between law enforcement and other protesters during dispersals. See Durkee Decl., ECF \n5 at ¶¶ 14–15.   \nPAGE 18 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 19 of 23\nFinally, in some circumstances, there are directly competing narratives about what \ntranspired on the ground. See Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43–1 (explaining declarant Rivera’s \narrest occurred because he repeatedly shined a high-powered flashlight directly at police officers’ \neyes in an alleged attempt to obscure their vision); Rivera Supp. Decl., ECF 46 at ¶¶ 3–5 \n(refuting allegations declarant ever possessed a high-powered flashlight or shined it at officers). \nA determination of excessive force in this context is better suited through litigation of the \nunderlying Complaint, upon fuller development of the record. This Court cannot make the \ncredibility determinations necessary to find for the Plaintiffs on the merits of their Fourth \nAmendment claims at this stage.  \n2. Irreparable Harm  \nPlaintiffs must also “demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. To satisfy this factor, Plaintiffs must show a “real or \nimmediate threat that [Plaintiffs] will be wronged again.” Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. In general, \nmandatory injunctions “are not granted unless extreme or very serious damage will result and are \nnot issued in doubtful cases or where the injury complained of is capable of compensation in \ndamages.” Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc., 571 F.3d at 879 (quoting Anderson v. United States, 612 \nF.2d 1112, 1114 (9th Cir. 1980) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nAs previously discussed, Plaintiffs have not raised sufficient evidence to suggest that they \nare being systematically targeted by law enforcement for their medical assistance at protests. The \nprotest medics are a loosely organized group, united through an “informal network.” Wise Decl., \nECF 6 at ¶ 12. They do not wear a particular uniform; instead, they each make their own. \nBecause of their varied backgrounds and training, they do not offer uniform types of aid. While \nsome utilize trauma kits, Durkee Decl., ECF 5 at ¶ 13, others hand out food, water, and basic \nPAGE 19 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 20 of 23\nmedical supplies, Martinez Decl., ECF 9 at ¶¶ 22–23. In other words, the protest medics are not \nobviously distinguishable from other protesters.  \nMoreover, as described previously, in many of the incidents of alleged targeting \ndescribed, the protest medics were not in the act of providing medical aid. See, e.g., Wise Supp. \nDecl., ECF 38 at ¶ 4 (recounting two PPB officers arresting him while “walking among a group \nof protesters”). The Municipal Defendants deny any targeting of protest medics in their use of \nforce. See Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 12 (“PPB and its [Rapid Response Team] squads do \nnot target medics for application of Riot Control Agents . . . or other forms of physical force.”). \nFurther, with regard to the alleged unlawful arrests, Municipal Defendants raise at least the \nplausible contention that rather than targeting protest medics without reason, there was probable \ncause to arrest them. See, e.g., Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43–1 (explaining declarant Rivera was \narrested after allegedly refusing to stop shining an industrial grade flashlight into police officers’ \neyes from less than ten feet away). These incidents raise further doubts that the protest medics \nwere targeted for their activity as medics.  \nAdditionally, the dynamic and evolving circumstances governing Municipal Defendants’ \ninteractions with protesters caution against the likelihood of future similar injury to these \nPlaintiffs, particularly with regard to tear gas and less lethal munitions. See City of Mesquite v. \nAladdin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982) (noting a defendant’s cessation of a challenged \npractice is an important factor bearing on the question of whether a court should exercise its \npower to enjoin the defendant from renewing the practice). For instance, the PPB has several \nnew restrictions on the use of tear gas, including: (1) an Executive Order issued by Mayor \nWheeler on June 6, 2020, directing the PPB to only use CS gas (a form of tear gas) when there is \n“a serious and immediate threat to life safety, and there is no other viable alternative for \nPAGE 20 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 21 of 23\ndispersal,” ECF 18 at 8; Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 24; (2) a TRO issued by Chief Judge \nHernandez prohibiting the PPB’s use of tear gas to “to disperse crowds where there is no or little \nrisk of injury,” ECF 18 at 9; Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 24; and (3) a new law signed by \nGovernor Kate Brown on June 30, 2020, restricting Oregon law enforcement agencies’ \ndeployment of tear gas to circumstances constituting a riot under Or. Rev. Stat. § 166.015, and \nonly after announcements are made and sufficient time is allowed for persons to leave the area, \nECF 18 at 9; Dobson Supp. Decl., ECF 43 at ¶ 24.  \nMoreover, on June 26, 2020, Chief Judge Hernandez entered a stipulated TRO restricting \nPPB’s use of certain crowd control munitions and aerosol restraints. ECF 18 at 10. For example, \nRubber Ball Distraction Devices of the type Plaintiff Wise alleges he was targeted with on June \n21, 2020, by a PPB officer, Wise Decl., ECF 6 at ¶ 24, can now only be used in situations where \nthe lives or safety of the public or police are at risk, and cannot be used to disperse crowds where \nthere is no or little risk of injury. ECF 18 at 26. The TRO is currently operative and has been \nextended by the court until further notice. Id. at 10.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs’ nearly one-month delay in seeking equitable relief following the \nwithdrawal of the First Motion for a TRO further undercuts their argument that such an \nextraordinary or drastic remedy is needed at this time. See Lydo Enters., Inc. v. City of Las \nVegas, 745 F.2d 1211, 1213 (9th Cir. 1984) (“A delay in seeking a preliminary injunction is a \nfactor to be considered in weighing the propriety of relief.”). Plaintiffs have not shown that \n“irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. \n3. The Public Interest and the Balance of the Equities  \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order must also \nestablish not only that he is likely to succeed on the merits and is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nPAGE 21 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 22 of 23\nin the absence of preliminary relief, but also that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that \nan injunction is in the public interest. Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. “In exercising their sound \ndiscretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in \nemploying the extraordinary remedy of injunction.” Id. at 24 (internal citations omitted). \nThis Court acknowledges the significance of this moment in our nation’s history, and the \ncrucial role of peaceful assembly in preserving American democracy. See Associated Press v. \nOtter, 682 F.3d 821, 826 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting the important public interest in upholding First \nAmendment principles). However, there is also a strong public interest in maintaining order and \npublic safety.  \nIn their request for relief, the protest medics essentially ask for special status. They seek \nan exemption from generally applicable dispersal orders. However, doing so may impose \nirreparable harm and undue hardship on law enforcement, creating an unworkable distinction \nbetween the ordinary protestor, who is subject to dispersal orders, and the protest medics, who \nare not.  \nBased on the facts presented to this Court, the line between protester and protest medic is \nnot sufficiently clear such that granting them the relief they request would not sow confusion or \ncreate additional risks. The protest medics wear no particular uniform, offer no particular type of \naid, and possess no particular level of medical training. When they attend the protests, many \ndeliberately stand in the spaces between law enforcement and the protesters, or even enmesh \nthemselves with other protesters. See, e.g., Rivera Decl., ECF 36 at ¶ 15 (describing declarant’s \nparticipation in forming a wall between protesters and police with other non-medic, military \nveteran protesters after the PPB made an unlawful assembly announcement). The protest medics’ \nactions and appearance would not obviously distinguish them from a diverse crowd of protesters.   \nPAGE 22 – OPINION AND ORDER \n \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 49    Filed 09/02/20    Page 23 of 23\nUpon consideration of the record before this Court, at this time, Plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate that the public interest and the balance of equities support their position. Certainly, \nthe safety of all protesters is clearly in the public interest. However, that safety is not the \nresponsibility of these volunteers alone.8 These factors weigh against Plaintiffs’ request for \ninjunctive relief. \nCONCLUSION \nIn so ruling, this Court does not seek to diminish or devalue the efforts of the protest \nmedics in keeping others safe, nor does this Court question the protest medics right to continue \nengaging in the protests and offering medical support to protestors. Like ordinary protesters, \nhowever, the protest medics must abide by lawful police orders. Plaintiffs’ Motion for a \nTemporary Restraining Order, ECF 35, is DENIED.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDATED this 2nd day of September 2020. \n \n              /s/ Karin J. Immergut    \nKarin J.

As their enclosed Memorandum of Law \ndetails, Plaintiffs have established that (i) Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their claims; (ii) Defendants’ conduct has caused and threatens irreparable \nharm to Plaintiffs; (iii) the balance of harms weighs in favor of granting the TRO; \nand (iv) the public interest favors issuing a TRO. Thus, Plaintiffs respectfully \nrequest that the Court grant Plaintiffs’ Motion and enter the requested TRO. \nMEMORANDUM OF LAW \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin the Portland Police from exerting threats \nand violence against Protest Medics, who are providing care and comfort to the \nhundreds, and sometimes thousands, of people protesting nightly in downtown \nPortland over the murder of George Floyd and against police brutality against \nBlack, Indigenous, and Brown lives generally.  \nPlaintiffs are volunteer protest medics who, in the face of tear gas, rubber \nbullets, and other “less lethal” munitions, exercise their constitutional rights of free \nspeech by providing care and support to the protesters demonstrating for the cause \nof equal treatment and absolute equality under the law. Plaintiffs also exercise \ntheir free-expression rights by helping create and facilitate an environment where \nprotesters can more securely and freely exercise their own free-speech rights. \nIn response, the Portland Police have continuously used excessive force—\ntargeting protest medics, preventing them from administering medical care to \nprotesters, and seizing their medical supplies—in violation of well-established First \nand Fourth Amendment rights. The Portland Police’s conduct is causing Plaintiffs \nand the public irreparable harm. As demonstrated in the attached declarations, the \nPortland Police are continuing to use excessive force to retaliate against Plaintiffs \n  4-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 35    Filed 08/21/20    Page 13 of 53\n   \nand numerous other protest medics for providing medical aid to protesters who the \npolice themselves injure.  \nTargeting individuals only for engaging in protected expressive activities \nviolates the First and Fourth Amendments, and the Portland Police’s unlawful \nconduct should be enjoined immediately. This is because that conduct is causing \nirreparable, immediate harm. Daily protests continue and show no sign of abating. \nAnd each day that passes without relief further denies Plaintiffs and other protest \nmedics their constitutional rights to support those demonstrating by providing \nmedical care and to be free from unlawful searches and seizures. The requested \nTRO is necessary to ensure that protest medics can care for others without fear of \nretaliatory police violence.  \nII.  FACTS \nA.  Volunteer medics begin to attend the Portland protests, to \ncreate a safer environment for protesters seeking to protest \npolice violence. \nMinneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd on May 25, \n2020. Only two months prior, police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, murdered \nBreonna Taylor as she lay in her own bed. Ms. Taylor and Mr. Floyd were the latest \namong many dozens of Black citizens killed by police officers in the United States in \njust the last few years. The murders of Mr. Floyd and Ms. Taylor sparked national \nand international protests in support of Black lives and against systemic racism in \nAmerican policing—including in Portland, where protests have been ongoing for \nmore than 80 days and show no sign of slowing down.

Yet, \non many nights, the Portland Police have responded with violent force. They have \nshoved protesters to the ground, beaten them with riot batons, shot them in the \nhead with rubber bullets and other impact munitions, and sprayed them in their \neyes with bear mace at dangerously close ranges. See, e.g., Wise Decl. ¶¶ 25; \nMartinez Decl. ¶ 28. Since the protests began, it has been a rare night when \nDefendants do not deploy tear gas or impact munitions into crowds ranging from \ndozens to hundreds of people.

After reviewing the violent tactics being used by the Portland \nPolice, this court intervened and issued a temporary \nrestraining order enjoining the Portland Police from using \nexcessive force against protesters. \nBecause of the Portland Police’s excessive use of violent force, this Court had \nto intervene and issue an injunction. On June 9, 2020, Chief Judge Marco \nHernandez issued a temporary restraining order against the Portland Police. Don’t \nShoot Portland v. City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-00917-HZ, 2020 WL 3078329 (D. Or. \nJun. 9, 2020). In that order, Judge Hernandez held that, because there was no \nevidence that the plaintiffs (protesters) had engaged in “criminal activity” and “only \nengaged in peaceful and non-destructive protest,” the use of tear gas against them \nby the Portland Police likely resulted “in excessive force contrary to the Fourth \nAmendment.” Id. at *3. Therefore, Judge Hernandez enjoined the Portland Police \nfrom using tear gas against peaceful protesters unless “the lives or safety of the \npublic or the police are at risk.” Id. at *4. Judge Hernandez later expanded the \norder to enjoin the Portland Police from using other crowd control agents, including \n“less lethal” munitions, against peaceful protesters. \n  7-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Federal Officers Arrive in Portland  \nIn an apparent attempt to circumvent Chief Judge Hernandez’s order, the \nPortland Police began to rely on federal law enforcement for tear-gas (and other \ncrowd-control devices) deployment. See Durkee Decl. ¶19 (describing an especially \nviolent, tear-gas filled night). Starting around July 4, protest attendees have had to \ncontend with violence from federal officers of the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”) and the U.S. Marshals Service (“USMS”).2 See Durkee Decl. ¶ 23 \n(describing distinctive uniform of Federal Officers). Purportedly acting under the \ncolor of Executive Order 13933, which declared that DHS would provide personnel \nto “assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, statues, or \nproperty,” DHS and the USMS have deployed special forces in Portland, or \notherwise created policing units for deployment to Portland. These Federal Officers \nuse many of the same weapons and tactics against protesters that the Portland \nPolice had already been deploying for over a month, some of which were restricted \nby Chief Judge Hernandez’s order. See Guest Decl. ¶ 12 (describing tear gas \ndeployment by Federal Officers). \nD.  This Court intervened again and issued a temporary \nrestraining order enjoining the Portland Police and Federal \nOfficers from using excessive force against journalists. \nIn light of the Portland Police’s seeming attempts to avoid Chief Judge \nHernandez’s order, on July 23, 2020, Judge Michael Simon granted a group of legal \nobserver and journalist plaintiffs a temporary restraining order.

City of Portland, No. 3:20-cv-1035-SI, 2020 WL 4220820 (D. Or. Jul. 23, \n2020). In that case, which is similar to this one, the Court found that the plaintiffs, \nby showing that “they were identifiable as press, were not engaging in any unlawful \nactivity or protesting, were not standing near protesters, and yet were subject to \nviolence by federal agents,” had “provide[d] sufficient evidence of retaliatory intent \nto show, at the minimum, serious questions going to the merits” of the plaintiffs’ \nFirst Amendment retaliation claim. Id. at *6. Therefore, the Court enjoined the \ndefendants’ direct attacks on journalists and legal observers. Id. at *1.   \nE.  The Federal Officers reduce their presence in Portland, but the \nPortland Police then resume their violence against protest \nmedics. \nBecause of the violent tactics used by the Federal Defendants against protest \nmedics, Plaintiffs filed for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the Federal \nDefendants and the Portland Police from continuing to target protest medics. (ECF \n4.)  Shortly thereafter, on or around August 1, 2020, the Federal Defendants agreed \nto reduce their presence in Portland, if the Oregon State Police and the Portland \nPolice resumed primary responsibility for policing the protests.3 Soon after that \nhappened, the Portland Police resumed their unconstitutional treatment of \ntargeting protest medics for violence. For example: \n•  On August 4, 2020, protest medic Jessica Shifflett, who goes by the \nname of Phoenix, attended the Portland protests. Declaration of \nJessica Shifflett in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order (“Shifflett Decl.”) ¶ 12. While doing so, she clearly \nidentified herself as a medic, and stood next to journalists and legal \nobservers until she witnessed the Portland Police tackle a journalist, \nwho was simply sitting down on a curb.

Id. In \nresponse, Phoenix identified herself verbally as a medic, and asked \nthe officers if she could provide emergency care. Id. Instead of \nallowing her to care for the journalist, however, the Portland Police \npushed and hit her with their batons multiple times. Id. Then, \n(despite the beating) Phoenix pleaded with the officers to, at \nminimum, allow her to provide basic care or turn the journalist on his \nside, so he did not choke on his vomit. Id. But, instead, the officer \nsprayed Phoenix directly in the face with mace from only a couple feet \naway. Id. The mace leaked through Phoenix’s mask filter, causing her \ngreat physical pain, burns, and breathing problems. Id. \n \n•  On Friday, August 7, 2020, protest medic Peyton Hubbard attended \nthe Black Lives Matter protest at the Multnomah County Sherriff’s \nOffice, near 47th Avenue and East Burnside. Supplemental \nDeclaration of Peyton Dully Hubbard in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion \nfor Temporary Restraining Order (“Hubbard Suppl. Decl.”) ¶ 3. While \nthere, Hubbard clearly identified themselves as a medic through \nclothing and equipment. Id. Shortly after 1:00 a.m., the Portland \nPolice declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to move \neast, which Hubbard complied with. Id. ¶ 5. Suddenly, an officer \ntackled Hubbard from behind, without any provocation. Id. ¶ 6. Once \nHubbard was on the ground, multiple officers surrounded Hubbard \nand beat them several times with batons and fists, causing serious \nbruising and injury. Id. ¶¶ 6, 10. Hubbard immediately started \nyelling out that they were not resisting arrest. An officer replied that \n“they didn’t give a fuck.”  Id.  Ultimately, the Portland Police \nhandcuffed Hubbard and detained them at a loading dock where \nother protesters were being detained. Id. ¶ 8. On the way to the \nloading dock, an officer pushed Hubbard, tried to trip them \nrepeatedly, and tried to rip Hubbard’s backpack off, all while in \nHubbard was in handcuffs.

Declaration of Jiri Rivera in \nSupport of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order \n(“Rivera Decl.”) ¶ 11. While there, Rivera clearly identified himself as \na medic through clothing and equipment. Id. ¶¶ 10, 12. At around \n11:40 pm, the Portland Police declared an unlawful assembly, and \nbegan “kettling” the protesters. Id. ¶ 14-15. As the crowd began to \nmove, Rivera suddenly found himself on the ground being detained by \nthe Portland Police. Id. ¶ 18. Other veterans informed the police that \nRivera was there serving as a medic and asked them to let him go. Id.  \nDespite those pleas, however, the officers zip-tied Rivera and shoved \nhis gas mask into his mouth, restricting his ability to breathe.  Id.  As \na military veteran, Rivera would like to believe that the Portland \nPolice did not specifically target him as a medic. Id. ¶ 19. But given \nthe number of targeting incidents that he has seen, and the fact that \nhe was a highly visible medic in a line of veterans dressed in military \nattire and white shirts, Rivera ultimately believes that the Portland \nPolice targeted him specifically because he had a red cross on his vest: \n \n \nPhoto courtesy of John Rudoff  \n \n•  In the early hours of this morning, August 21, Portland Police \narrested Plaintiff Chris Wise when he was clearly marked as a medic. \nSupplemental Declaration of Christopher Wise in Support of \n  11-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Plaintiffs peacefully offer aid to protest attendees and, despite \nclearly identifying themselves as providing medical aid, are \ntargeted by the Portland Police. \nPlaintiffs are all protest medics who have routinely attended the Portland \nprotests to provide medical care to protesters and condemn racist police violence. \nPlaintiffs’ very presence at the protests is an act of peaceful resistance: They seek to \nmake people feel safe while attending lawful demonstrations, demanding change. \nPlaintiffs express that “protesters have a right to protest safely and without fear of \npolice violence.” Martinez Decl. ¶ 19; see Rivera Decl. ¶ 6; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 6. \nPlaintiffs’ service as protest medics also sends a clear message to the police: We will \nnot allow your violence to prevent people from protesting your violence. Martinez \nDecl. ¶ 19; Durkee Decl. ¶ 10. \nProtest medics offer a range of services that empower protesters to keep \nstanding up for their values, journalists to keep reporting on the protests, and other \nmedics to keep rendering aid at the protests. They equip protest attendees with eye \nwash and eye wipes in anticipation of tear-gas attacks, offer personal protective \nequipment so protest attendees can observe COVID-19 physical-distancing \nprotocols, feed and hydrate protest attendees, and render medical aid when police \ninjure protest attendees.

For example, protest medics wear clothing with \nthe word “medic” and the red-cross medic symbol painted across the back, as well as \nbrightly colored duct-taped medic symbols on both upper arms and the chest. Wise \nDecl. ¶ 9; Guest Decl. ¶7; Durkee Decl. ¶¶ 9-10; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 7. The crosses are \nidentifiable during the day and at night and can be seen from any angle.

See Wise Decl. ¶ 9; \nDurkee Decl. ¶ 13 (carrying large backpack holding trauma kit); Guest Decl. ¶ 10 \n(same); Shifflett Decl. ¶ 7 (same). \nThough protest medics engage in nonviolent behavior and pose no threat to \nthe public, officers, or city or federal property, the Portland Police have repeatedly \nintimidated, harassed, and assaulted them, including each Plaintiff.

Phoenix has experienced similar incidents over the last \ncouple months. Id. ¶¶ 10-11, 13. \n•  Portland Police have repeatedly beaten and shot Peyton Hubbard, \ndespite the facts that Hubbard always wears identifying clothing, \nstands to the side of the protests unless someone needs assistance, and \nhas not violated any police orders or committed any crimes. Hubbard \nDecl. ¶¶ 5-12; Hubbard Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 3-14.  \nIn each of these incidents, it was clear that the visibly identifiable protest medics \nwere actively rendering medical aid or standing by “on call,” ready to provide aid. It \nalso is clear that, at the time of these assaults, Plaintiffs posed no risk to the lives \nor safety of the public or officers. And this use of force has had a clear chilling effect: \nDespite their desire to continue serving as protest medics each day, Plaintiffs have \n                                                 \n4 Because Portland Police prevented EMTs from timely responding, the press \nmember lay there for around 12 minutes before an ambulance arrived to help him. \nPhoenix could have offered him immediate help if the Portland Police hadn’t forcibly \nprevented her from doing so.

The standard for issuing a TRO is “substantially identical” to the standard \nfor issuing a preliminary injunction. Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & \nCo., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001).  \nUnder the traditional four-factor test for a TRO or preliminary injunction, \nthis Court must grant Plaintiffs’ motion if they show that (1) Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) the \nrequested injunction is in the public interest. Goldman, Sachs & Co. v. City of Reno, \n747 F.3d 733, 738 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). Although not dispositive by itself, the first of these factors—\nlikelihood of success on the merits—is the “most important.” Garcia v. Google, Inc., \n786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc). But with respect to the relationship \nbetween factors (1) and (2), in the Ninth Circuit, plaintiffs who show that the \nbalance of hardships tips “sharply” in their favor need only raise “serious questions” \ngoing to the merits. All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th \nCir. 2011); see also Warsoldier v. Woodford, 418 F.3d 989, 993-94 (9th Cir. 2005). In \nother words, “‘the greater the relative hardship to [Plaintiffs], the less probability of \nsuccess must be shown.’” Warsoldier, 418 F.3d at 994 (quoting Walczak v. EPL \nProlong, Inc., 198 F.3d 725, 731 (9th Cir. 1999)). Here, Plaintiffs satisfy either bar.  \n  15-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their First \nAmendment claim. \nThe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution “reflects a ‘profound national \ncommitment’ to the principle that ‘debate on public issues should be uninhibited, \nrobust, and wide-open.’” Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 318 (1988) (quoting New York \nTimes Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964)). Government officials—here, local \nlaw enforcement officers—may not retaliate against an individual for engaging in \nconstitutionally protected speech. See Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006).      \nTo succeed on their First Amendment retaliation claims, Plaintiffs must show \nthat (1) they engaged in constitutionally-protected speech; (2) Defendants’ actions \nwould “chill a person of ordinary firmness” from continuing to engage in \nconstitutionally-protected speech; and (3) Plaintiffs’ engagement in protected speech \nwas a “substantial motivating factor” in Defendants’ conduct. O’Brien v. Welty, 818 \nF.3d 920, 932 (9th Cir. 2016); Pinard v. Clatskanie Sch. Dist. 6J, 467 F.3d 755, 770 \n(9th Cir. 2006); Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino Cty., 192 F.3d 1283, 1300 (9th \nCir. 1999). In so doing, however, Plaintiffs “need only show that the defendant[s] \n‘intended to interfere’ with the plaintiff[s’] First Amendment rights and that [they] \nsuffered some injury as a result; the plaintiff[s are] not required to demonstrate \nthat [their] speech was actually suppressed or inhibited.” Ariz. Students Ass’n v. \nAriz. Bd. of Regents, 824 F.3d 858, 867 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Mendocino, 192 F.3d \nat 1300)). Here, Plaintiffs establish a high likelihood of success on the merits as to \nall three elements of their First Amendment claim.  \n1.  Plaintiffs engaged in constitutionally protected speech \nwhile serving as volunteer protest medics. \nPlaintiffs have met the first element for establishing a First Amendment \nclaim—engagement in constitutionally protected speech. Specifically, under the \nfacts of this case, Plaintiffs have shown that, as protest medics, they exercise their \n  16-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Plaintiffs have engaged in constitutionally protected speech as \nparticipants in protests for Black lives. Those protests began in the wake of the \nmurders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Monika Diamond, and \ncountless others. Plaintiffs and protesters attend the protests to express their \nsupport for eradicating “systemic racism, especially as it pertains to policing and \npolice violence.” Martinez Decl. ¶ 3; see also Wise Decl. ¶ 4; Durkee Decl. ¶ 4, 7, 10; \nGuest Decl. ¶ 3, 5, 8; Paul Decl. ¶ 4, Dr. Morgans Decl. ¶ 8; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 6. Since \nthey started protesting in May and June 2020, Plaintiffs have fought for justice for \nBlack people across the United States.  \nProtesting is protected speech. The “classically protected” right to protest lies \nat the heart of the First Amendment, Boos, 485 U.S. at 318, and, thus, activities \n“such as ‘demonstrations, protest marches, and picketing’” are forms of speech \nprotected under the Constitution, Black Lives Matter Seattle-King Cty. v. City of \nSeattle et al., No. 2:20-cv-00887-RAJ, 2020 WL 3128299, at *2 (W.D. Wash. June 12, \n2020) (quoting Collins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d 1363, 1371 (9th Cir. 1996)). The recent \nprotests have been passionate and emotional, as protesters nationwide seek to \nradically change the way policing is conducted in our communities and country, all \nwhile actively opposed by the very group they are attempting to challenge with \ntheir voices. See generally City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461 (1987) \n(explaining that yelling obscenities and threats at a police officer is still protected \nspeech under the First Amendment). \nIn addition to traditional protesting, rendering medical aid to support and \nadvance a protest is itself a form of constitutionally protected expression: The \n  17-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

City of Fort Lauderdale, 901 \nF.3d 1235, 1240 (11th Cir. 2018) (quoting Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404 \n(1989)). Certain expressive conduct constitutes a protected form of speech under the \nFirst Amendment, “when ‘it is intended to convey a ‘particularized message’ and the \nlikelihood is great that the message would be so understood.’” Corales v. Bennett, \n567 F.3d 554, 562 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Nunez v. Davis, 169 F.3d 1222, 1226 (9th \nCir. 1999)); see also Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404. Applying those principles, courts have \nrecognized that providing services, supplies, or support to individuals as part of a \nmovement for political, policy, and social change, is expressive conduct and, thus, \nconstitutionally protected speech. See, e.g., Fort Lauderdale Food Not Bombs, 901 \nF.3d at 1240-41 (ruling that a nonprofit organization’s sharing of food in visible \nspaces intended to convey a particular message that collective food sharing helps to \neradicate hunger and poverty); Abay v. City of Denver, No. 20-cv-01616-RBJ, 2020 \nWL 3034161, at *3 (D. Colo. June 5, 2020) (finding that protesters, including protest \nmedics who “attempt[ed] to render treatment to injured protest[e]rs,” as part of an \n“organized political protest” against police brutality, engaged in constitutionally \nprotected speech).5  \n                                                 \n5 In their original motion, Plaintiffs relied on Abay in support of their First \nAmendment claims.  In response, the City of Portland tried, but failed, to \ndistinguish that case from the facts here. In Abay, the plaintiffs included a protest \nmedic and similarly-situated individuals who sought to participate in organized \npolitical protests against police brutality in Denver, Colorado. 2020 WL 3034161, at \n**1, 3. The plaintiffs alleged that the Denver Police “specifically targeted medics \nwearing red crosses attempting to provide care and treatment to those injured by \nthe Police’s wanton use of force . . . [including] while [medics] attempt to administer \ncare to people prone on the ground.” Compl. ¶¶ 32-33, Abay, 2020 WL 3034161. The \ncourt did not, however, hold that the protest medics’ conduct was protected only \nbecause it occurred in the context of the larger demonstration, as argued by the \nCity. Rather, after acknowledging that the plaintiff medics participated in the \nprotests as part of an “attempt to render treatment to injured protest[e]rs,” the \n  18-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1270 (11th Cir. 2004) (emphasis in original) \n(citing Hurley, 515 U.S. at 569).

Night after night, police brutality and \nviolence against protesters in downtown Portland is on full display for all of the city, \nOregon, the nation, and the world to see—on social media, the local news, in \nnewspapers, and for some Portland residents who live near these protests, right \noutside of their windows. Furthermore, as Plaintiffs have stated—and quite \nsignificantly, the City of Portland has not contested—ambulances and medical first \nresponders often do not have access to or decline to come to protest sites to treat \ninjured protesters, before, during, or after the Portland Police issue allegedly \n“lawful” dispersal orders. See, e.g., Wise Decl. ¶ 15 (describing “ambulances and \nfirst responders unwilling to come to [protesters]”); Shifflett Decl. ¶ 12 (explaining \nthat it can take anywhere from 15-20 minutes, generally, when police call for an \nambulance). \nSurrounding circumstances make Plaintiffs’ participation clear, as well. \nPlaintiffs’ message at the protests is one that is particularized and specific to \nprotest medics, as a discrete category of individuals attending the protests. \n                                                 \n6 See also Hurley, 515 U.S. at 568 (using context to differentiate “marchers \n[in a parade] who are making some sort of collective point” from “bystanders along \nthe way”); United States v.

Further, the context and \nsurrounding circumstances establish that the likelihood is great that this message \nwould be understood. Therefore, Plaintiffs have established the likelihood of success \non the merits that they engaged in constitutionally-protected expressive conduct as \nprotest medics.   \n  23-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Defendants’ actions would chill a person of ordinary \nfirmness from continuing to engage in constitutionally \nprotected speech. \nPlaintiffs also establish a likelihood of success on the merits as to the second \nelement of their First Amendment retaliation claim—that Defendants’ actions \nwould chill a person of ordinary firmness—because (as should come to no one’s \nsurprise) physical violence and deployment of chemical irritants and munitions by \nlaw enforcement would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to \nparticipate in protests as medics. “‘Ordinary firmness’ is an objective standard that \nwill not ‘allow a defendant to escape liability for a First Amendment violation \nmerely because an unusually determined plaintiff persists in [their] protected \nactivity.’” Black Lives Matter-Seattle, 2020 WL 3128299, at *3 (quoting Mendocino, \n192 F.3d at 1300). Here, although Plaintiffs have continued, and will continue, to \nserve as protest medics, under the applicable objective standard, the Portland \nPolice’s continuous targeting of protest medics almost certainly would chill any \nmedic of ordinary firmness from participating in the protests.  \nThis Court and others have repeatedly confirmed that what Plaintiffs endure \nnightly from Defendants would chill the First Amendment rights of a person of \nordinary firmness: \n•  A police officer’s deployment of pepper spray caused a protester severe \nanxiety, and thus would chill the protester’s rights, Drozd v.

St. Charles Cty., Mo., No. 4:16-CV-1320 NAB, \n2019 WL 2423321, at *6 (E.D. Mo. June 10, 2019).  \nBecause of the chilling effect that an indiscriminate use of force presents, \n“courts have held that the proper response to potential and actual violence is for the \ngovernment to ensure an adequate police presence, and to arrest those who actually \nengage in [violent] conduct, rather than to suppress legitimate First Amendment \nconduct as a prophylactic measure.” Collins v. Jordan, 110 F.3d at 1372 (citing Cox \nv. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 551 (1965); Kunz v. New York, 340 U.S. 294-95 (1951)). \nThe Portland Police have repeatedly done just the opposite. \nThe Portland Police have unquestionably engaged in conduct that would chill \na person of ordinary firmness from continuing to participate in protests as medics. \nAs in the cases cited above, the Portland Police have deployed tear gas, pepper \nspray, and other chemical irritants directly on Plaintiffs at close range. Martinez \nDecl. ¶ 12; Wise Decl. ¶ 28; Dr. Morgans Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 12. These \nirritants are deeply invasive and painful, causing the eyes, nose, and (sometimes) \neven the skin to burn and swell.7 Protest medics exposed to these irritants find it \nhard to breathe, feel burning or pain in their chest and lungs, and experience \ndifficulty seeing, see id., as was the case for Plaintiffs.

The Portland Police have repeatedly attacked, \nbeaten, clubbed, and harassed Plaintiffs and other protest medics. See Wise Decl. \n¶¶ 22, 24-26, 28-30; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 12. This conduct has caused grave, physical \ninjuries. See Wise Decl. ¶¶ 22-23 (“[A] Portland police officer shot me in the shin \nwith a rubber bullet . . . penetrat[ing] my skin and expos[ing] my shin bone . . . \n[and] [m]y wound later became infected . . .

Plaintiffs’ protected activities were a substantial \nmotivating factor in Defendants’ conduct. \nPlaintiffs also establish a high likelihood of the existence of the third and \nfinal element of their First Amendment retaliation claim—that their protected \nactivities were a substantial and motivating factor in the Portland Police’s conduct. \nThis element requires a “nexus between [Defendants’] actions and an intent to chill \nspeech.” Cantu v. City of Portland, No. 3:19-cv-01606-SB, 2020 WL 295972, at *7 (D. \nOr. June 3, 2020) (quoting Ariz. Students Ass’n, 824 F.3d at 867). Plaintiffs may \nestablish that element through either direct or circumstantial evidence: “The use of \nindiscriminate weapons against all protesters—not just [] violent ones—supports \nthe inference that [law enforcement officials’] actions were substantially motivated \nby Plaintiffs’ protected First Amendment activity.” Black Lives Matter-Seattle, 2020 \nWL 3128299, at *4; Ulrich v.

Id. From that, \nit is reasonable to infer that Plaintiffs’ message of opposing police brutality in a \ntangible way is a substantial and motivating factor in the excessive and \nindiscriminate use of force. Plaintiffs have engaged in protests that specifically seek \nto eradicate police brutality and fundamentally transform the role that law \nenforcement plays in our society, and they have chosen to express their views \nthrough their particular service. Durkee Decl. ¶ 3; Guest Decl. ¶¶ 3-4; Wise Decl. ¶ \n4-6; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 6; Rivera Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8. That message, if successful, is one that \nultimately will have a negative impact on the authority and power that Defendants \nwield. Given that Plaintiffs are clearly identified, have not engaged in any \nthreatening behavior, and that Defendants have used direct force to suppress the \nspeed at which Plaintiffs perform their medical services or Plaintiffs’ ability to \nrender aid altogether, it is reasonable to infer that Defendants sought, and seek, to \nsuppress Plaintiffs’ particularized form of speech. Defendants acts to target \nPlaintiffs as they assist others and to prevent them from rendering aid in the first \nplace leads to but one conclusion: Plaintiffs’ protected activities were a substantial \nmotivating factor in Defendants’ conduct.  \nThe Portland Police’s rationale for why its officers shot, fired at, beat, and \ninjured clearly-marked and clearly-identifiable protest medics—the overall chaotic \nenvironment of the Portland protests—does not at all defeat Plaintiffs’ claims that \nthe Portland Police unconstitutionally targeted them for violence. That is for two \nreasons.  First, in making that argument, the Portland Police have \nmischaracterized the exact nature of Plaintiffs’ theories.  Although Plaintiffs do rely \non important contextual evidence showing that the Portland Police indiscriminately \n  28-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Instead, as in this motion for \nTRO, Plaintiffs’ gravest concern is the harm caused to them and other protest \nmedics (not protesters generally) by the Portland Police’s “direct targeting” of \nmedics:  i.e., the use of force directly targeted at a protest medic; such as, macing a \nclearly identified protest medic in the face from a few feet away when they are \nproviding or attempting to provide medical care; Wise Decl. ¶ 25; Martinez Decl. ¶ \n28; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 12; aiming a gun directly at, shooting, and then laughing at a \nclearly identified protest medic who is standing to the side of the protests waiting to \nhelp someone; Hubbard Decl. ¶¶ 5-12; beating a clearly identified protest medic \nwith batons, while they are screaming to help another injured protester; Hubbard \nSuppl. Decl. ¶ 6.  And the overall chaotic environment of a protest has little to no \nbearing on those decisions by the Portland Police to identify the medics out of a \ncrowd of protesters and specifically target them for violence.        \nSecond, under the U.S. Constitution and its own internal agency directives, \nthe Portland Police have an obligation to distinguish and detain only criminal and \nviolent actors in a protest, but not others who serve important functions while \ncaught in the crossfire of that violence. Contrary to the Portland Police’s assertions, \nthe U.S. Constitution does not somehow allow law enforcement officers to fire \ndirectly or indiscriminately at people (such as Plaintiffs) peacefully exercising their \nconstitutional rights and then blame the damage to those individuals on a few other \nactors who actually engaged in violent behavior. See Don’t Shoot Portland, 2020 WL \n3078329 at *3 (holding that the Portland Police could not rely on the chaotic \nenvironment of protests to justify their excessive force under the Fourth \nAmendment, so long as the individual Plaintiffs did not actually pose a safety or \n  29-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Constitutional uses of force may result in unintended consequences, \nbut the Portland Police’s targeting of clearly marked medics and subjecting them to \nviolent force can hardly be characterized as unintended. See, e.g., Wise Decl. ¶ 25 \n(being bear maced by a PPB officer from a distance of six to eight feet away, risking \npermanent, severe damage to Wise’s eyes); Shifflett Decl. ¶ 12 (describing being \nmaced directly in the face from a few feet away); Hubbard Suppl. Decl. ¶ 6 \n(describing being beaten by multiple officers while on the ground). Similarly, the \nPortland Police’s own internal directives require officers to distinguish between \nactors while responding to demonstrations and protests. Under PPB Directive \n0635.10, a police officer’s “response should be commensurate to overall crowd \nbehavior, and members should differentiate between groups or individuals who are \nengaging in criminal behavior or otherwise posing a threat to the safety of others \nand those in the crowd who are lawfully demonstrating.” Therefore, the fact that \nthese events took place in a generally chaotic environment does not make otherwise \ntargeted unconstitutionally violent behavior suddenly constitutional.  \nB.  Plaintiffs also are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nFourth Amendment claim. \nThe Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. Here, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits \nof their claims that the Portland Police violated the Fourth Amendment by using \nexcessive force against Plaintiffs and by unlawfully seizing their medical \nequipment.  \n  30-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

The Portland Police have used, and continue to use, \nexcessive force against Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs have established a high likelihood that the Portland Police used \nexcessive force against them, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. A seizure \noccurs when an “officer by means of physical force or show of authority terminates \nor restrains [a person’s] freedom of movement through means intentionally \napplied.” Nelson v. City of Davis, 685 F.3d 867, 875 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting \nBrendlin v. California, 551 U.S. 249, 254 (2007). And, a law enforcement officer’s \nuse of force is excessive and violates the Fourth Amendment when it was \n“objectively unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the \nofficer.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989). To determine whether use of \nforce was unreasonable, courts balance “the nature and quality of the intrusion on \nthe individual’s Fourth Amendment interests” against the “countervailing \ngovernmental interests at stake.”  Id. at 396. “The force which was applied must be \nbalanced against the need for that force; it is the need for force which is at the heart \nof the consideration” of the reasonableness inquiry. Alexander v. City & Cty. of San \nFrancisco, 29 F.3d 1355, 1367 (9th Cir. 1994) (emphasis in original). In this case, \nthe Portland Police’s seizures through use of force against Plaintiffs was not \nobjectively reasonable.   \na.  Plaintiffs were seized under the Fourth \nAmendment.  \nThe Portland Police have continuously “seized” Plaintiffs under the Fourth \nAmendment by using force to terminate their movements. Under the Fourth \nAmendment, an officer’s intent to specifically target an individual is irrelevant; so \nlong as the use of force that terminates an individual’s movement is intentional, a \nseizure occurs even where there is “an absence of concern regarding the ultimate \nrecipient of the government’s use of force.” Nelson, 685 F.3d at 876.

Decl. ¶¶ 5; Rivera Decl. ¶ 15; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 8. Because the \nofficers intentionally targeted and used force against Plaintiffs, inhibiting their \nmovement, Plaintiffs were seized.  \nb.  The Portland Police use excessive force against \nPlaintiffs. \nThe Portland Police violated Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights by effecting \na seizure (as described above) through the use of excessive force. The Ninth Circuit \nhas held that the use of only pepper spray is a serious intrusion into an individual’s \nFourth Amendment rights, “due to the immediacy and ‘uncontrollable nature’ of the \npain involved.” Nelson, 685 F.3d at 878 (citations omitted); see U.S. v. Neill, 166 \nF.3d 943, 949 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that pepper spray is dangerous weapon \n“capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury”). Accordingly, deploying \nchemical irritants such as pepper spray to disperse protesters can constitute \nunreasonable, excessive force where it is “unnecessary to subdue, remove, or arrest \nthe protestors,” even if the protesters have failed to heed a police warning. Young v. \nCty. of L.A., 655 F.3d 1156, 1167 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).   \nThe Portland Police have injured Plaintiffs and other protest medics with \nchemical irritants and impact munitions, which inflicted immediate and \nuncontrollable pain. As Plaintiffs and other protest medics cared for wounded \nprotesters, officers temporarily blinded them with tear gas and bear mace and shot \nrubber bullets that cut through their skin.

When protest medics did not disperse fast enough, they were \nsingled out from the crowd and tackled or violently arrested. Wise Decl. ¶¶ 22, 24-\n28; Wise Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 4-6; Martinez Decl. ¶¶ 37-40; Hubbard Suppl. Decl. ¶¶ 5-6; \nRivera Decl. ¶¶ 15-18.  \nAs a result of this police brutality, Plaintiff Wise suffered a sprained shoulder \nand was forced to take medical leave from work; Shifflett suffered chemical burns to \nher throat and had trouble eating; and several protest medics have been otherwise \nbruised and battered. Wise Decl. ¶¶ 26-27; Shifflett Decl. ¶ 12; Hubbard Decl. ¶¶ 7-\n8, Guest Decl. ¶ 15; Durkee Decl. ¶ 20. The Portland Police’s actions and the \nresulting injuries have caused Plaintiffs “immediate” and “uncontrollable” pain. \nThus, consistent with Nelson, the Portland Police repeatedly have used excessive \nforce on Plaintiffs, contravening the guarantees of Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment \nrights.   \nc.  The use of force against Plaintiffs was not justified. \nPlaintiffs should prevail on their Fourth Amendment claims because the \nPortland Police had no valid justification for reacting with such extreme displays of \nforce. In assessing the need for force against an individual, the Ninth Circuit \nconsiders factors such as “the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect \nposes an immediate threat to the safety of the officers, and whether he is actively \nresisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” Hopkins v. Andaya, 958 \nF.2d 881, 885 (9th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 396). Not \none of these factors is even implicated, let alone met.  \n  33-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Where individuals are not engaged in “serious criminal behavior,” that \n“significantly reduce[s] the governmental interest involved” in the use of force \nagainst them. Nelson, 685 F.3d at 880. This holds true even where the use of force \ntakes place under circumstances of “general disorder,” because the relevant inquiry \nis whether the targeted individual had engaged in criminal activity. Id. at 883. \nThus, even if others in the immediate areas are engaging in criminal activity but \nthe actual plaintiffs are not, then using force against the plaintiffs is not justified \nunder the Fourth Amendment. See Don’t Shoot Portland, 2020 WL 3078329 at *3 \n(granting a TRO on Fourth Amendment grounds because, even though others at the \nPortland Protests were engaged in criminal activity, “there is no dispute that \nPlaintiffs engaged only in peaceful and non-destructive protest.” (Emphasis in \noriginal.)).  \nHere, Plaintiffs and protest medics did not engage in any criminal activity. \nInstead, they actually attempted to de-escalate activities that would lead to further \npolice agitation. Wise Decl. ¶¶ 18, 26; Guest Decl. ¶¶ 14, 17, 19; Durkee Decl. ¶¶ 10, \n24; Rivera Decl. ¶ 11. Therefore, under the first factor, the Portland Police’s use of \nforce on protest medics is not justified. \nRegarding the second factor, Plaintiffs did not pose any immediate threat to \nofficer safety. Law enforcement officers may not justify use of force against an \nindividual who does not pose an immediate threat to officers’ safety merely \nbecause of the underlying “tumultuous circumstances.”  Nelson, 685 F.3d at 881. As \njust explained, Plaintiffs and protest medics did not pose a threat to anyone’s safety, \nand were subjected to violence even while retreating or attempting to leave the \nprotest altogether.

In fact, quite the opposite is true: \nas protest medics, they were working to ensure and increase public safety. Therefore, \nDefendants’ use of force against Plaintiffs was not justified by any threat to officers’ \npublic safety.    \nThird and finally, Plaintiffs did not resist or attempt to evade any valid \narrest. Where an officer orders a crowd to disperse, a failure to comply immediately \ndoes not amount to actively resisting arrest, but “only rise[s] to the level of passive \nresistance,” which “neither rises to the level of active resistance nor justifies the \napplication of a non-trivial amount of force.” Nelson, 685 F. 3d at 881; see also \nHeadwaters Forest Def. v. Cty. Of Humboldt, 276 F.3d 1125, 1130 (9th Cir. 2002) \n(protesters that remained seated in a congressman’s office despite officers’ orders to \ndisperse had not actively resisted). To the extent that Plaintiffs may not have \ncomplied immediately with an officer’s order to disperse because they were packing \nup their medical supplies or attempting to render aid to an injured protester, \nthat does not rise to the level of active resistance that would justify the application \nof a non-trivial amount of force, particularly when they did not resist arrest.  Wise \nSuppl. Decl. ¶¶ 4-6; Martinez Decl. ¶ 39; Hubbard Suppl. Decl. ¶ 6; Rivera Decl. ¶¶ \n17-18. \nAs Plaintiffs were not engaged in any criminal behavior, creating a threat to \nofficers’ safety, or actively resisting arrest, it was not reasonable for officers to use \nany force against them, much less the chemical irritants, rubber bullets, and \nphysical force that officers wrought upon them. Plaintiffs have therefore shown that \nthey will likely succeed on the merits of their Fourth Amendment excessive force \nclaim.    \n  35-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Plaintiffs are likely to establish that law enforcement \nofficers unlawfully seized their property in violation of \nthe Fourth Amendment.  \nThe Portland Police also unlawfully seized Plaintiffs’ medical equipment and \nmaterials. “Seizure of property occurs when there is some meaningful interference \nwith an individual’s possessory interests in that property.” U.S. v. Jacobsen, 466 \nU.S. 109, 113 (1984). Such interference violates the Fourth Amendment when it is \nunreasonable. With limited exceptions, “[a] seizure conducted without a warrant \nis per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” U.S. v. Hawkins, 249 F.3d \n867, 872 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Minn. v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 372 \n(1993)). Further, seizure of property without a warrant is reasonable only when \n“there is probable cause to associate the property with criminal activity.” Soldal v. \nCook Cty., Ill., 506 U.S. 56, 69 (1992). Whether probable cause exists depends on the \ntotality of the circumstances within an officer’s knowledge. Illinois v. Gates, 462 \nU.S. 213, 230-31 (1983).  \nHere, law enforcement officers violated the Fourth Amendment by \nunreasonably seizing Plaintiffs’ medical supplies and medics’ station materials. For \nexample, to provide protesters with medical assistance, Plaintiff Martinez, with the \nOHSU for Black Lives Matter group, had set up a medics’ station for several days at \nthe protests with a table, tent, and banner that prominently displayed medic \nsymbols, first aid signs, and the logo for OHSU. Martinez Decl. ¶ 22; Dr. Morgans \nDecl. ¶ 14. Protest medics and community members brought medical supplies to the \nmedics’ station, including wipes and saline solution to rinse protesters’ eyes after a \ntear gas attack, gauze and bandages, and personal protective equipment to help \nprotesters observe public health measures, such as masks, gloves, and a hand \nsanitizer.

Martinez Decl. ¶ 41; Dr. Morgans \nDecl. ¶¶ 14-16; see also Shifflett Decl. ¶ 11 (describing an incident where the \nPortland Police “dumped [Shifflett’s] medical-supply bag into the street” before \nphysically detaining her). They managed to recover their table and some medical \nsupplies from the Portland Police’s outgoing trash, but have not yet received their \ntent, banner, or the remainder of their medical supplies. Martinez Decl. ¶ 41; Dr. \nMorgans Decl. ¶ 16. While OHSU owns some of this property, such as the banner, \nPlaintiff Martinez’s possessory interest in the property is sufficient for him to have \nsuffered an injury when the property was seized. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 113 \n(defining “seizure” as the interference with an individual’s possessory, not \nownership, interests).  \nThe officers had no plausible reason to associate the medical supplies and \nmedics’ table materials with criminal activity, let alone one sufficient to provide \nprobable cause. The medic symbols, first-aid signs, and the logo for OHSU made \nclear that the table, banner, and tent were part of a medics’ table to promote public \nhealth and safety. The supplies were also plainly items for medical assistance. \nFurther, the OHSU group had established and maintained the medics’ station at \nthe protests for several days, without causing any concern of criminal activity. \nThus, per the totality of the circumstances within the officers’ knowledge, the \nmedical supplies and medics’ table materials were not associated with criminal \nactivity, but with public safety and health instead. The officers’ seizure of the \nmedical supplies and medics’ table materials was therefore unreasonable.  \nAs such, Plaintiffs have clearly established a likelihood of success on the \nmerits that law enforcement officers violated the Fourth Amendment by unlawfully \nseizing Plaintiffs’ property. \n  37-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W.

Nearly every day that protest medics have participated in \nthe protests, Portland Police have beat them, shot them with bullets, or sprayed \nthem with chemical irritants.

And every \nday that Plaintiffs miss a protest, more protesters suffer from the Portland Police’s \nabuses, without the assistance of a protest medic. \nAs discussed below, the Portland Police’s continual use of excessive force \nagainst Plaintiffs and other protest medics has consequences beyond just the \nmedics’ ability to engage in expressive conduct by rendering care at nightly \nprotests. By reducing the availability of on-site medical care, the Portland Police’s \ntargeting of protest medics also chills the nightly protests themselves, by creating \nan unsafe environment that potential protesters must think twice about before \njoining. \nC.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm without the Court’s \nintervention.  \nWith each passing night where Plaintiffs are inhibited and intimidated from \nexercising their First Amendment rights, they suffer irreparable injury.

And, as Chief Judge Hernandez recently wrote: \n“This is a significant moment in time. The public has an enormous interest in the \nrights of peaceful protesters to assemble and express themselves. These rights are \ncritical to our democracy.” Don’t Shoot Portland, 2020 WL 3078329 at *4.   \nPlaintiffs are volunteer medics providing comfort and care to protesters \nengaged in demonstrations of worldwide concern, to members of the press \ndocumenting the protests, to other protest medics rendering aid at the protests, and \nto bystanders who are harmed by the Portland Police’s indiscriminate displays of \nforce. The Portland Police, in response, have targeted protest medics, singling them \n  41-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 35    Filed 08/21/20    Page 50 of 53\n   \nout for arrest, shooting them with munitions when they are trying to render aid, \nand retaliating with bear mace to the face when they ask for permission to help \npeople prostrate in pain.  \nBy engaging in these unconstitutional acts, the Portland Police have \nattempted to quash Plaintiffs’ message: that demonstrators can feel safe working to \ncounter the otherwise chilling impact of the Portland Police’s own violence. But \nPlaintiffs will not go quietly. Where so many protesters have been left battered, \nbeaten, and traumatized by the police, there is a significant public interest that \nthose injured may receive medical treatment.  \nThe interest at stake here, however, is not just Plaintiffs’ own interest in \nengaging in expressive conduct by rendering medical care (although, that interest \nsurely is at stake). It is not just the interest of victims of violence perpetrated by \nlaw enforcement at protests to receive prompt medical care (although, that interest, \nalso, clearly is at stake). The greater public interest at stake here is in being free to \nparticipate in Portland protests safely and with the knowledge that medics are \nonsite and able to render care in an emergency. If the First Amendment is to mean \nanything, it must mean that Oregonians are free to join voices in solidarity with the \nBlack Lives Matter movement, to demand that the government take steps to \nredress systemic racism and—with the strongest vehemence—violent, draconian, \nand excessive policing. By targeting protest medics, Defendants do not burden only \nPlaintiffs’ rights and those of the individuals to whom they care; rather, the \nPortland Police make the entire protest less safe by reducing the number of medics \npresent and able to render care. And Oregonians who wish to join the protests, or \nwho already are there and wish to stay later, are chilled from doing so when they \nperceive that the protests are unsafe as a result of the Portland Police’s actions.   \n  42-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 35    Filed 08/21/20    Page 51 of 53\n   \nIn the context of the Portland Police’s violent, riotous actions in recent \nmonths, the public’s interest in having a frontline provider of first aid is obvious \nand cannot reasonably be questioned. The work of Plaintiffs as protest medics is \nnecessary to facilitate a safe protest. In this critical moment in history, this Court \nmust ensure the continued ability of the public to gather and express itself by \nprotecting Plaintiffs’ ability to provide care and safety to all demonstrators. The \npublic interest demands it.  \n2.  The balance of equities tips sharply in Plaintiffs’ favor.  \nPlaintiffs have “raised serious First [and Fourth] Amendment questions.” \nCmty. House, Inc. v. City of Boise, 490 F.3d 1041, 1059 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal \nquotations omitted). The balance of hardships therefore “tips sharply in [their] \nfavor.” Id. Plaintiffs’ evidence shows that they have not presented any danger to \npublic, to property, or to the Portland Police. To the contrary, they mitigate dangers \nthat befall protest attendees and bystanders—they render medical aid and \nproactively work to diffuse tension and de-escalate thorny situations. Plaintiffs’ \nevidence also shows, however, that the Portland Police have exercised their \ndiscretion in a retaliatory fashion to punish protest medics for rejecting the police’s \nown violence. The Portland Police have substantially and irreparably harmed \nPlaintiffs.  \nOn the other side of the scale, any harm to the Government would be \nnegligible. The Government might have an interest in protecting buildings and \nproperty, but that interest is not served by using excessive force against individuals \nwho are serving as volunteer medics. Protest medics present no threat to the police \nor to the public.  \n  43-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 35    Filed 08/21/20    Page 52 of 53\n   \nTo protect the protest medics—and ultimately, the public at large—this \nCourt should enjoin the police from targeting and injuring medics in retaliation for \ntheir administration of aid. Although limiting the use of force in certain situations \ncould impede an officer’s ability to protect themselves against potential violence \nfrom demonstrators, here, any marginal risk of harm in limiting only the Portland \nPolice’s use of force to directly target protest medics is wholly outweighed by the \nirreparable harm that Plaintiffs—engaged in peaceful expression—will endure. \nAccordingly, the balance of equities weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor.  \nE.  Plaintiffs’ requested relief is reasonable. \nIn crafting the relief that they request in this Motion, Plaintiffs have, \nconsistent with Judge Simon’s Temporary Restraining Order in Index Newspapers, \n2020 WL 4220820, narrowly tailored their request for relief to ensure that it enjoins \nonly unconstitutional activity targeted at protest medics:   \n•  Recognizing that law enforcement officers sometimes operate when \nvisibility is diminished, and at times when they must make quick \ndecisions, Plaintiffs’ requested relief includes an adequate description \nof the distinctive markings they will wear so that Defendants can \nclearly identify protest medics.   \n•  Plaintiffs’ proposed order states that Defendants would not be liable \nfor indirect and unintended exposure to crowd-dispersal munitions \nfollowing the issuance of a lawful dispersal order. \n•  The proposed order also contains sufficiently clear standards, so that \nDefendants will easily be able to determine what, when, and how their \nactivity is prohibited. For example, in one of the requests for relief, \nPlaintiffs rely on existing Oregon statutes, Or. Rev. Stat. § 133.235, \nwhich regulates the use of force by law enforcement officers in Oregon, \nfor the applicable standard.   \nSee id. at *9-10 (issuing an order similar to that sought here); see also Opinion and \nOrder Granting Preliminary Injunction at 44, Index Newspapers LLC v. City of \n  44-  MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER  Perkins Coie LLP \n  AGAINST MUNICIPAL DEFENDANTS  1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01193-IM    Document 35    Filed 08/21/20    Page 53 of 53\n   \nPortland, No. 3:20-cv-1035-SI (D. Or. Aug. 20, 2020) (ECF 157) (noting that City of \nPortland stipulated to preliminary injunction protecting press and legal observers, \nproviding “compelling evidence” that the TRO was workable for Portland Police to \nfollow).  Thoughtful and narrowly crafted relief limiting only the ability of the \nPortland Police to target protest medics is more than reasonable in light of the \nserious constitutional violations resulting from the Portland Police’s attacks. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThese protests have continued for more than 80 days, and the Plaintiffs \ncontinue to put their health and safety on the line helping others. Based on the \nrecord presented here, Plaintiffs have established the basis for the requested relief. \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant their \nMotion for a Temporary Restraining Order.   \n \nDATED:  August 21, 2020  PERKINS COIE LLP  \n \nBy: /s/ Nathan Morales \nRian Peck, OSB No. 144012 \nThomas R.

This is a civil rights action brought on behalf of protest medics who \nhave been providing care and comfort to the hundreds of people protesting nightly \nin downtown Portland against white supremacy, police violence generally, and \npolice brutality against Black lives specifically. \n2.  Plaintiffs are protest medics who, in the face of tear gas, rubber \nbullets, and other munitions, exercise their rights to free speech through their \nservice to the cause of equal treatment and absolute equality under the law, but \nmore fundamentally, they exercise their rights by creating a safer environment for \ncitizens to continue to express their desire for change. \n3.  As the protests continue, these protest medics have put their safety at \nrisk in order to keep protesters safe. They share a strong belief that the protests are \nnecessary to effectuate change in our community, and our country, and that their \nservice as protest medics is an expression of their commitment to these ideals. \n4.  The police and federal law enforcement officers, however, have \nengaged in violent tactics in an effort to suppress the protests advocating massive \nchanges in the way we police in America. Despite clear expression to the police and \nfederal officers that these protest medics are there to assist others, and are not \nviolent in any way, the police and their federal counterparts have targeted medics \nwith rubber bullets, shoved them, sprayed tear gas at close range, arrested them, \nand taken their property. \n5.  Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and prospective injunctive relief so \nthat they can continue their efforts to aid protesters. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  1-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims that \nDefendants have violated Plaintiffs’ federal constitutional rights under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343, because Plaintiffs’ causes of action arise under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and \n28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n22.  Venue is proper in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the District of Oregon and because \nDefendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in the District of Oregon. \nALLEGATIONS \nA.  Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, \nsparking worldwide protests against systemic racism in American \npolicing. \n23.  On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on \nGeorge Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, as Mr. Floyd repeatedly pleaded \nfor his life: “I can’t breathe.” “I can’t breathe.”  “I can’t breathe.”  “I can’t breathe.”  \nMore than twenty times. Officer Chauvin’s colleagues stood by and did nothing to \nintervene. Mr. Floyd’s murder was caught on video, and that footage quickly \ncirculated nationally and internationally. \n24.  Mr. Floyd’s murder occurred around two months after police officers in \nLouisville, Kentucky burst into Breonna Taylor’s home and murdered her, shooting \nher eight times while she laid in her own bed. Ms. Taylor was an EMT and aspiring \nnurse.  \n25.  Ms. Taylor and Mr. Floyd were the latest among many dozens of Black \npeople murdered or wrongfully killed by America’s police in just the last few years. \nWidely-known victims include Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Philando \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  5-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \nCastile, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Elijah McClain, and more. There also are victims \nwhose names and stories are not amplified enough—primarily Black women and \nBlack transgender Americans—such as India Kager, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Layleen \nPolanco Xtravaganza, Tanisha Anderson, Monika Diamond, Rekia Boyd, Miriam \nCarey, Tony McDade, and Darnisha Harris. The names continue. \n26.  Of course, death is not the only potential consequence Black Americans \ndisproportionately face in America’s criminal legal system: Nationally, and in \nPortland specifically, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, are more likely to be \nprofiled, stopped, arrested, charged, convicted, and imprisoned, and they often \nreceive longer and harsher sentences. \nB.  In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, protesters in Portland have \nmaintained a vigilant effort against police brutality in any form. \n27.  The protest movement that erupted after George Floyd’s murder has \nserved as an indictment of racist and brutal policing practices, and it has forced \nstates, cities, and non-Black citizens to reckon—in many cases, for the first time—\nwith their history of participating in, and perpetuating, white supremacy. Indeed, \nin the words of Black-studies educator and writer Walidah Imarisha, “Oregon was \nfounded as a racist white utopia.”3  \n28.  The history of this State is steeped in racism, having been founded as a \nwhites-only territory. Oregon’s founders implemented Black exclusionary laws \ndesigned to prevent Black people from living here. When Oregon became a state, \nthese Black exclusionary laws—which provided that Black people outside Oregon \nwere not permitted to “come, reside, or be within” the State, prevented Black \n                                                 \n3   Tiffany Camhi, A Racist History Shows Why Oregon Is Still So White, Or. \nPublic Broadcasting (June 10, 2020 11:12 AM), https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-\nwhite-history-racist-foundations-black-exclusion-laws/.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  6-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

They remained in the Oregon Constitution until 2002—\nonly 18 years ago—and even then, around 30% of Oregonians voted to keep the \nracist clause.  \n29.  By their conduct, the Portland Police are no exception to the systemic \nracism inherent in policing nationwide, as local police officers have committed \ndisproportionate violence against Black lives. In 2003, Portland police officers shot \n21-year-old Kendra James during a traffic stop. In 2004, they shot James Jahar \nPerez. In 2006, they beat James Chasse Jr. to death while he was experiencing a \nmental-health crisis in their custody. In 2010, they shot 25-year-old Aaron \nCampbell. In 2011, Darris Johnson. In 2017, they shot 17-year-old Quanice Hayes. \nAnd in 2018, they shot 27-year-old Patrick Kimmons. \n30.  The protests in Portland came within days of Mr. Floyd’s murder. \nProtesters took to the streets of Portland in large number, beginning on May 29, \n2020. They have continued every night since—or for more than 50 days, as of the \ndate of filing this Complaint. The protesters are dedicated to real change and show \nno sign of being deterred by the police violence described herein. In fact, the police \nviolence only serves to strengthen their resolve, as is memorialized in the familiar \nprotest chant: “No Justice? No Peace!” \n31.  Protests have primarily occurred at places symbolic of Oregon’s racist \nhistory, specifically as it relates to criminal justice and police brutality. Though \ndemonstrations have taken place at the Portland police-union headquarters in \nNorth Portland and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office in East Portland, they \nhave for the most part been held downtown in Chapman and Lownsdale Squares, \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  7-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

They shoot protesters with rubber bullets and other impact munitions. \nThey beat them with truncheons. They pull their masks down and spray bear mace \nin their eyes at dangerously close ranges.  \n35.  The Portland Police have perpetrated many of these assaults after they \nalready have drenched protesters, and much of their surrounding area, in thick \nclouds of tear gas. \n36.  The Portland Police’s indiscriminate use of pepper spray, bear mace, \nand tear gas is especially concerning in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is \nbecause those weapons all are designed to make peoples’ eyes water and burn, to \nmake people spit, cough, choke, retch, vomit, and to make mucous pour from their \nnoses. Those are all ways COVID-19 can spread. \n37.  The Portland Police drive riot vans with officers lined on running \nboards around downtown Portland, collecting slower (often injured) protesters and \narresting them without probable cause.  \n38.  The Portland Police also tackle protesters riding their bikes away from \nthe protest area in broad daylight, running up and giving them a knee to the gut for \nextra measure.

Incredibly, the President also declared that state and local \ngovernments had, in the face of mass protests, “lost the ability to distinguish \nbetween the lawful exercise of rights to free speech and assembly and unvarnished \nvandalism.” The President of the United States also asserted that State and local \ngovernments’ sometimes brutal and militaristic police response to the protests had \nso far been inadequate, representing an “abdication of their law enforcement \nresponsibilities in deference to [the protesters’ alleged] violent assault” and a \n“surrender[] to mob rule.”  \n41.  Purportedly acting under color of the Executive Order, DHS and the \nUSMS deployed or operationalized special forces in Portland. Upon information and \nbelief, this occurred soon before the July 4 protests.  \n42.  The agencies for whom these forces worked was initially a mystery to \nmany in Portland. Upon information and belief, they are rapid response teams that \ninclude members of the USMS, as well as DHS’s Customs and Borders Protection \n(CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Transportation Security \nAdministration (TSA), the Coast Guard, and the Federal Protective Service (FPS). \nThey include specially trained tactical units such as the Border Patrol Tactical Unit \n(BORTAC), which is normally tasked with investigating violent drug smuggling \norganizations.  \n                                                 \n4   https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-\namerican-monuments-memorials-statues-combating-recent-criminal-violence/ \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  10-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

They built walls surrounding \nthe front courthouse windows and most doors. The walls have functioning cut-out \ndoors, as well as eye-level retractable cut-outs from which they can shoot weapons \nor direct the long-range acoustic device (LRAD)—a speaker system and sound \nenergy weapon developed in the early 2000s for use by the U.S. military in foreign \nwars—at Oregonians. An LRAD has a maximum range of 8,900 meters. At 20 \nmeters, it has an output of 110-130 dB, which can cause pain. At 1 meter, it has an \noutput of 162 dB.

Those, such as Plaintiffs, who have been subjected to the federal tear \ngas describe it as “spicier” than the Portland Police’s tear gas. Regardless, DHS’s \nand USMS’s officers use a lot of it, engulfing city blocks in opaque, chemical clouds. \nA video from this week’s protests: \nhttps://twitter.com/tuckwoodstock/status/1285482965707837440?s=20  \n48.

Protesters exposed to the Federal Defendants’ tear-gas attacks have \ncomplained of long-lasting effects beyond the immediate physical symptoms. There \nhave been reports of persistent mental fog, drowsiness, grogginess, nausea, \ndiarrhea, loss of appetite, sustained asthma flare-ups, and increased or interrupted \nmenstrual cycles—many of which symptoms Plaintiffs themselves have \nexperienced. \n50.  On the night of July 11, following one such tear gas attack, several \nindividuals began walking back toward the federal courthouse to continue the \nprotests. The Federal Defendants remained on guard outside. A 26-year-old named \nDonavan La Bella stood on the City sidewalk in front of the federal courthouse and, \nwith two arms, raised a boom box above his head. Federal officers shot a tear gas \ncanister in his direction. He tried to lightly kick it away from his immediate vicinity \nand, when his kick proved too gentle, he tossed it away with insufficient force to \ncome anywhere near the federal officers. As he raised his stereo again, an officer of \none of the Federal Defendants shot him in the head with an impact munition. Mr. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  13-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Aside from the bizarre vehicular kidnappings, DHS’s and USMS’s \nofficers also violently tackle and arrest protesters suspected of minor offenses and \ndrag them into the federal courthouse. On information and belief, these arrests are \nnot supported by probable cause, given the number of protesters, the lack of light, \nand the general bustle of the crowd.

Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf has also published \nthe Federal Defendants’ supposed rationale for waging war on Portland’s citizens \nprotesting widespread police brutality. Those reasons: graffiti, more graffiti, and \nprotesters tossing “animal seed” (pig feed) at riot-gear clad officers.

Protest medics play a central role in the ongoing protests. \n55.  Amid the nightly violence wrought by the Portland Police and Federal \nDefendants, protest medics like Plaintiffs play a vital role in giving voice to the \n                                                 \n5   https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-\nlong-lasting-violence-portland \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  16-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

In the face of often violent police action, these medics deliver medical \ncare in furtherance of the anti-racist ideals at the core of the protests. \n56.  Protest medics offer a range of services, among them: distributing eye \nwash and eye wipes to protesters in anticipation of tear gas attacks, offering \npersonal protective equipment so that protesters can observe COVID-19 physical \ndistancing protocols, ensuring that protesters remain adequately hydrated and fed, \nand rendering direct care when police injure protesters. \n57.  Protest medics have different degrees of first-aid training and a variety \nof backgrounds. Some are nurses, others graduate students, others medical \nresidents, and others still are people who hold day jobs and have basic first-aid \ntraining or former EMT experience. The protest medics coordinate with one another \nto discern who has credentials to provide higher levels of care, and they ensure that \nthey only provide the care they are qualified to provide. \n58.  The protest medics view what they do as an act of protest, and a form \nof speech and expression. By their presence, they send a message to all protesters, \njournalists, and neutral legal observers that someone will be there to care for them, \neven when the Portland Police and the Federal Defendants are actively harming \nthem. The protest medics work to prevent all who attend the demonstrations from \ndeveloping illness or injury, so they can continue protesting, documenting the \nprotests, or providing legal observation at the protests.  \n59.  The protest medics’ aid is necessary to provide a relatively safer \nenvironment for protesters to exercise their rights to free speech. The police-\ninflicted injuries that protest medics have treated include, among other things: \na.  traumatic brain injuries; \nb.  trauma-induced seizures; \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  17-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Given the degree of risk that merely attending a protest presents to \nprotesters, journalists, neutral legal observers, and even other protest medics, on \nnights when there are few or no protest medics, many would-be protest attendees \nchoose not to participate, or leave earlier than they wish to, for fear that they will \nnot have access to care in the likely event the police hurt them. \n61.  Aside from coordinating about their relative training levels at the \nbeginning of each night, the protest medics work to communicate with one another \non a regular basis throughout the protest. Many of them carry walkie-talkies so \nthey can call for help and let each other know where they are needed. They also use \na “buddy system” whenever possible, not necessarily always working together, but \nat least keeping track of their “buddy’s” whereabouts and remaining in the same \ngeneral vicinity as one another. They work to share supplies and different \ntechniques they develop as the protests go on.  \nF.  The police’s pattern of intentionally targeting and retaliating against \nthe protest medics. \n62.

Since the beginning of the \nprotests, the Portland Police have indiscriminately attacked, and at times have \nspecifically targeted protest medics, including Plaintiffs, during their service to the \nprotests.  \n63.  Since the Federal Defendants arrived in Portland, they have done the \nsame thing. \n64.  The Portland Police’s and Federal Defendants’ conduct has intimidated \nmedics or otherwise worn them so thin that they feel they cannot continue \nattending protests with the frequency required to protect the health and safety of \nprotesters. Defendants’ conduct is part of a longstanding pattern of assaulting and \nthreatening protest medics to prevent them from rendering aid to protesters, \njournalists, neutral legal observers, and their fellow protest medics. \n1.  The Portland Police repeatedly injure Plaintiff Wise. \n65.  Plaintiff Wise is a former EMT and one of the few Black men serving \nas a protest medic in Portland. He has attended the Portland Protests nearly every \nnight since May 29, with the exception of Sundays and days on which he was too \ninjured by police to continue to render adequate aid. \n66.  When serving as a protest medic, Plaintiff Wise wears, and has always \nworn, a black, waxed denim jacket with the words “medic” and the medic symbol \npainted in red across the back, as well as brightly colored duct-taped medic symbols \non both upper arms and the chest. He quite openly carries medical supplies on his \nperson at all times. \n67.  He does not interfere with the police or federal agents when he is at \nthe protests, either when he is rendering aid or standing by “on call” for a medical \nneed to arise. At times, he directs jokes at officers to diffuse tension between \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  19-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiff Wise often renders aid by attempting to prevent injury \naltogether. He tries to clear paths for cars to drive safely through protest areas. He \nadvocates for protesters to not throw objects toward officers in retaliation to the \nofficers’ actions. In other words, he practices a form of “preventive medicine” by \nworking to promote civil disobedience and peaceful assembly. \n69.  Nevertheless, the Portland Police and Federal Defendants have \nseverely injured him multiple times and have threatened him with physical harm \nessentially every night he has attended the protests.  \na.  The Portland Police shoot Plaintiff Wise with a rubber \nbullet. \n70.  Plaintiff Wise served as a protest medic in his usual medic garb, on \nJune 2, a night later referred to by protesters as “Tear Gas Tuesday.” \n71.  While standing close to the sidewalk near a group of protesters in the \nroad, Plaintiff Wise saw a tear gas canister on the ground in the middle of the road \nand then a cloud of tear gas appeared. During this tear-gas attack, Plaintiff Wise \nattempted to pull a fallen protester out of the cloud of tear gas and helped move the \nprotester to safety on a nearby bench. Plaintiff Wise then examined the protester’s \nminor injuries. \n72.  As Plaintiff Wise tended to the protester, one of the Municipal Doe \nDefendants (a Portland Police officer) shot him in the shin with a rubber bullet. The \nbullet penetrated his skin through his pants, all the way to his shin bone.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  20-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiff Wise served as a protest medic on June 28, wearing his medic \nclothes as usual. \n78.  Plaintiff Wise witnessed a wall of protesters develop in front of police \nofficers. He then saw police officers push the wall of protesters back. As the \nprotesters reluctantly complied with the officers’ requests, Plaintiff Wise witnessed \npolice officers begin to bear mace protesters and hit them with batons.   \n79.  After 10pm that evening, Plaintiff Wise watched a Portland Police \nofficer, at close range, spray a protester’s eyes with bear mace. Plaintiff Wise rushed \nto the protester to pull them out of harm’s way and administer necessary medical \naid to the protester.   \n80.  As Plaintiff Wise reached the protester, one of the Municipal Doe \nDefendants (the Portland Police officer) turned the bear mace on Plaintiff Wise, \nspraying him directly in the eyes at a distance of no more than 6 inches. As he felt \nhis eyes burn, and struggled to see, Plaintiff Wise sought shelter with the help of \nothers and flushed his eyes for 45 minutes. Thereafter, despite the injuries to his \nface and body, Plaintiff Wise continued his service to the protests later that night. \nd.  The Portland Police “bull rush” Plaintiff Wise. \n81.  Plaintiff Wise also served as a protest medic at the protests in \ndowntown Portland on the evening of July 4, a night a of explosive violence \nperpetrated by the Portland Police. Upon information and belief, federal USMS \nagents also participated in crowd-control activities that evening and contributed to \nthe violence.   \n82.

Plaintiff Wise stayed toward the front of the protest line, about two or \nthree rows back from the riot line. He walked backward, facing the police, to watch \nfor any potential injuries.   That day, as he did each time he served as a protest \nmedic, Plaintiff Wise displayed a brightly colored cross on the back, chest, and both \nsleeves of his jacket, and wore medical supplies around his waist. \n84.  Plaintiff Wise noticed that one officer had Number 67 in place of a \nname tag. He made a joke directed at Officer No. 67 (one of the Municipal Doe \nDefendants in this Complaint), to the effect of the officer not understanding why \nkids like the delicious taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  \n85.  Suddenly, and without any notice or provocation, Officer No. 67 \nbrushed past two protesters and charged at Plaintiff Wise from a distance between \n10 and fifteen feet.  At speed, Officer No. 67 forcefully shoved Plaintiff Wise to the \nground.  \n86.  Plaintiff Wise’s glasses flew off his face and his cell phone, which \nremained in his back pocket, shattered from the force of his impact to the ground.  \n87.  Plaintiff Wise suffered a sprained shoulder and a wound the size of a \nquarter on his palm. For the rest of the evening, he was hindered from providing \nmedical aid because he was profusely bleeding from one hand and had reduced \nmobility in his shoulder.  \n88.  As a result of the shoulder injury, Plaintiff Wise was unable to go to \nhis regular job for over a week.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  23-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Some of the Federal Doe Defendants shoot Plaintiff Wise \nwith pepper balls.  \n89.  Plaintiff Wise served as a protest medic at the Portland protests on \nJuly 14. \n90.  When the Portland Police began “kettling” the protest attendees—tear \ngassing protesters at all angles, thereby eliminating paths for them to escape—Wise \nstood in the middle of Lownsdale Square to watch for any potential medical \ncomplications protesters might experience from tear gas, such as severe asthma \nattacks.  Lownsdale Square is not on, and does not contain, any federal property.  \n91.  As he stood there, some of Federal Doe Defendants repeatedly shot \nhim in the legs with pepper balls. \n92.  Plaintiff Wise experienced temporary pain from the pepper balls, \nwhich hit him in the shin above guards that Wise tied around his leg to protect the \nopen wound that was still present from a month and a half earlier. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  24-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Aside from those more severe injuries, the Portland Police and Federal \nDefendants have thrown or shot flashbang grenades and teargas canisters directly \nat Plaintiff Wise.  \nFigure 7: Wise, with hands raised, nearly hit with a tear gas canister shot in his direction. \n94.  On at least one of those occasions, Plaintiff Wise had not had the \nopportunity to don his gas mask, and the tear gas caused him to have a severe \nasthma attack.  \n95.  On another night, the Portland Police used the LRAD at full volume \nand at an improper distance from where Plaintiff Wise and other protest attendees \nwere.   \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  25-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiff Martinez is a graduate student at OHSU, pursuing a \ndoctorate degree in Cellular and Molecular Genetics. Specifically, he studies gene \nediting for phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error of metabolism that results in \ndecreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Infants are tested for PKU \nshortly after birth and there currently is no genetic cure.  \na.  Plaintiff Martinez first attended the protests as a \n“civilian” protester, and then determined he needed to \nuse his skills, voice and affiliation with OHSU to serve as \na protest medic. \n97.  Plaintiff Martinez began attending the Portland protests as a “civilian” \nprotester on June 2, Tear Gas Tuesday. He participated in the protests that night \nwith another OHSU graduate student. \n98.  The June 2 protest began in Pioneer Square and was peaceful, with the \ncrowd chanting and a few people addressing the protesters on a megaphone. Around \n9:10 p.m., the protesters marched as a group a couple of blocks east to Third \nAvenue.   \n99.  Portland Police met them in full riot gear around 9:25 p.m. The police \nformed lines surrounding the protesters to the east and south.  \n100.  Plaintiff Martinez was not engaged in any conduct that presented a \ndanger or threat to public safety, and he also did not see any other protesters \nengaged in conduct in any way threatening to any police officer.  \n101.  The protest had been peaceful up to this point. Given the stark \ncontrast between the peaceful protest, and the officers in full riot gear, the \nprotesters chanted: “Take off your riot gear! We don’t see no riot here!” \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  26-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n102.  Suddenly—and only within about five minutes of their arrival to the \ndemonstration—the Portland Police began indiscriminately shooting tear gas and \nmunitions into the crowd, for no apparent reason.  \n103.  After ingesting the tear gas, Plaintiff Martinez had difficulty breathing \nand seeing, his eyes burned, and he suffered from confusion and general grogginess, \namong other symptoms.   \n104.  The Portland Police struck Plaintiff Martinez’s OHSU colleague, with \na rubber bullet or similar munition on her upper thigh, causing her pain and \nextensive bruising that lasted for days.  \n105.  The police violence Plaintiff Martinez witnessed—and experienced \nfirsthand—strengthened his belief that protesting police brutality was necessary \nand important. So, after recovering from Tear Gas Tuesday, he resumed attending \nthe protests on June 5, at the Justice Center.  \n106.  That night, the Portland Police used the “kettling” tactic to tear gas \nthe peaceful protesters from all angles—cutting off any path for escape. Among the \nprotesters he saw trying to escape the police violence that night was a mother with \nher baby in a stroller near the Multnomah County Courthouse. The mother could \nnot move quickly enough away from the police and sought shelter near the \ncourthouse wall. Yet again, witnessing this strengthened Plaintiff Martinez’s belief \nthat the police were not protecting the City or its citizens from anything—they were \njust retaliating against protesters for decrying their violent policing tactics. \n107.  Every night thereafter, the Portland Police alleged some minor \nviolation of the law to declare an “unlawful assembly” and, based on those supposed \n“infractions,” weakly justify the discharging of tear gas and other “less lethal” \nmunitions at Plaintiff Martinez and the hundreds of other protesters.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  27-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n108.  The Portland Police used tear gas against the protesters nearly every \nnight until this Court entered an injunction in the Don’t Shoot PDX case on June 9, \n2020. \n109.  The same week that Plaintiff Martinez was attending the protests as \nan active protester, some graduate students and faculty members at OHSU \norganized a group of volunteers to regularly serve as protest medics.  \n110.  Plaintiff Martinez decided to join this group of protest medics, because \nit was important for him to take a tangible stand against the nightly police \nbrutality he was witnessing and experiencing.  \n111.  He also believed that a large group of protest medics affiliated with \nOHSU, one of the most respected teaching hospitals in the nation, would lend \ncredibility to the protests and help people who were not attending them understand \nthat they were not full of “violent anarchists” and lawless “mobs,” as Defendants \nfalsely portrayed them to be. \n112.  Plaintiff Martinez also wanted to send a message that protesters have \na right to protest safely and without fear of police violence. And, because he had \nwitnessed many nights of Defendants freely discharging  tear gas or “less lethal” \nmunitions against protesters, he wanted to do his part as a participant in the \nprotests by helping to ensure that injured protesters had the ability to obtain basic \nfirst aid and other healthcare, and to suffer as little harm as possible from \nDefendants.  \n113.  By his presence, he also wanted to express to protesters that someone \nwas there for them and they would have access to care if they needed it. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  28-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \nb.  The OHSU volunteer medic group is organized. \n114.  To that end, Plaintiff Martinez began serving as a protest medic with \nthe OHSU group on June 8.  \n115.  For the first couple of nights, the group carried backpacks and \ndistributed food and water to protesters.  \n116.  Eventually, on June 11, they set up a table in Chapman Square. The \ntable was clearly marked as a medics’ station—it had a banner draped across it \ndisplaying the OHSU logo and was under a tent marked with a medic symbol and \nother first-aid signs.  \n117.  The protest medics clearly marked the space as an OHSU medic’s \nstation for a few reasons. First, they wanted people to be able to find the medics \nquickly. Second, they wanted to be visible to provide the protesters with some \nassurance that help was close at hand. Finally, the medics wanted the police to be \nable to identify who they were, so that the police understood the medics were there \nto render aid to people in need of urgent medical attention. \n118.  The OHSU medics kept (and still keep) a variety of supplies at the \nOHSU medics’ station. This includes medical supplies such as gauze, bandages, \nantibiotic ointments, tape, ear plugs, and over-the-counter pain medications. They \nalso offer wipes and saline solution or other eye wash to help rinse peoples’ eyes \nfollowing a tear gas attack.  \n119.  Beyond medical supplies, the OHSU medics keep the table stocked \nwith snacks and water to ensure that protesters remain sufficiently nourished.  \n120.  And given the current pandemic, they offer personal protective \nequipment such as masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer—so that protesters and other \nmedics can observe recommended safety measures.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  29-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n121.  Their supplies are largely donated from community members and local \nbusinesses. \n122.  As the OHSU volunteer group became more organized, they developed \nroles for two different kinds of medics: (1) those who stay at the table and hand out \nsupplies to other medics and protesters, and (2) those who go “into the field” to \nprovide support to other medics or direct care to protesters wherever that care is \nneeded.  \n123.  The medics also came to learn that the Portland Police were \nrecommending that ambulances not enter the protest area, even when someone was \nseriously wounded and needed to be treated at a hospital. So, on nights that police \nare expected to be particularly violent, OHSU volunteer medics turn their personal \ncars into makeshift ambulances. \n124.  Plaintiff Martinez has basic first-aid training, so he typically does not \nprovide direct physical care to protesters. Instead, he assists other medics who have \nhigher levels of training by making sure they have adequate supplies. He also \nmakes sure that protesters have eye wipes, eye solution, and other supplies they \nneed to feel safe when the police begin using force. \nc.  The Portland Police arrest Plaintiff Martinez for \nstanding at the OHSU medics’ station and unlawfully \nseize the OHSU medics’ supplies. \n125.  On June 13, Plaintiff Martinez worked as a protest medic at the OHSU \nstation beginning around 9:00 p.m.  \n126.  The medics’ station was at its usual location near the corner of Fourth \nAvenue and Madison Street in Chapman Square.  \n127.  The crowd of protesters was mainly congregated in front of the federal \ncourthouse, adjacent to Chapman Square.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  30-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n128.  Around 10:30 p.m., the Portland police used the LRAD to make an \nannouncement. The LRAD was positioned around Second Avenue and Main Street, \nwhich was not in direct earshot of Plaintiff Martinez or the other OHSU volunteer \nmedics. They could not quite hear the announcement until the LRAD repositioned.  \n129.  Plaintiff Martinez eventually was able to discern their announcement: \nThe Portland police had declared an “unlawful assembly” and were ordering \nprotesters to disperse or else be subject to crowd-control munitions, tear gas, or \narrest.  \n130.  In the past, the police had typically given protest attendees about a 30-\nminute warning before using crowd-control munitions. Plaintiff Martinez and the \nother OHSU volunteer medics therefore spent about five minutes handing out eye \nwash and wipes to as many protesters as they could, in anticipation of the likely \nimminent tear-gas attack. They then began packing up they supplies, which usually \ntook them around 20 minutes. About five minutes after they started packing their \nsupplies, the Portland Police stormed the crowd.  \n131.  Plaintiff Martinez saw a line of police coming directly towards the \nOHSU medics’ tent, so he started filming the scene. Filming police encounters was a \nsafety protocol recommended for all OHSU volunteer medics. The OHSU medics’ \ntent was still standing and it was clear that it was a medics’ station. Plaintiff \nMartinez stood in front of the tent, closest to the police, while the other OHSU \nvolunteers moved quickly to break down the station. When the police approached, \nthe OHSU medics explained that they were packing up their supplies, after which \nthey would immediately clear the area. The police told them to leave without their \nsupplies and directed them to move west.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  31-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiff Martinez still stood between the officers and the OHSU \nvolunteers, continuing to film, as the volunteers began complying with the officers’ \norders. Plaintiff Martinez also began complying with the officers’ orders, moving to \nthe west, and walking backwards to keep the camera trained on the officers. After \nhe started to walk, an officer pointed at him and said, “Arrest that guy. Arrest him.”  \n133.  An officer (who Plaintiff Martinez later learned was Defendant Officer \nStephen B. Pettey) then arrested him. Zip ties were placed around his wrists. \nPlaintiff Martinez did not resist arrest and, in fact, told the officers that one of the \nzip ties had slipped off his wrist because they hadn’t tightened it enough. Plaintiff \nMartinez was wearing a CamelBak backpack, and the police cut the straps to \nremove it from his person.  \n134.  They then took him to the Justice Center, where he was detained until \nthe National Lawyers Guild arranged with the PDX Defense Fund for bail to be \nposted on his behalf. The Portland Police released Plaintiff Martinez from the \nJustice Center at approximately 5:30 a.m.  \n135.  As Plaintiff Martinez was being arrested, the Portland Police ordered \nthe other OHSU volunteer medics to continue moving to the west, leaving behind \ntheir supplies. The Portland Police confiscated their tent, table, medical and other \nsupplies, and banner.  \n136.  Though the Portland Police denied having confiscated their supplies, \nand even told the volunteer medics that they should have known their supplies \nwould be “stolen” because the area was a “war zone,” the OHSU volunteer medics \neventually recovered their table and supplies from the Portland Police Bureau’s \noutgoing trash. To this day, they have not received their tent or banner. They have \nsince had a new banner made, but they operate without a tent now. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  32-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiff Martinez and the OHSU medics change their \npractices to avoid further police brutality. \n137.  Following Plaintiff Martinez’s arrest, the OHSU volunteer group was \nforced to limit its operations to protect the medics’ safety from police violence and \narrest.  \n138.  For example, they usually would start packing up their tent and \nsupplies by 11:00 p.m., because, in their experience, the police tended to declare an \n“unlawful assembly” and began using tear gas and making arrests around 11:30 \npm. On some nights, however, the police would surprise them and begin exerting \naggressive crowd-control tactics even earlier than expected, forcing them to stop \nproviding services to the protesters, pack up their tent and supplies, and leave \nmuch earlier than they wanted.  \n139.  Given the message of support the medics were trying to give to the \nprotesters (and public at large), they would have stayed much later on those nights \nand continued offering services to the protesters if they did not fear physical \nviolence or arrest by the police.  \n140.  They also started keeping roll of all OHSU volunteer medics and \ninstituted a buddy system for medics to watch over one another. \n141.  Plaintiff Martinez, especially, has dramatically decreased his \nattendance at the protests since the night of his arrest, as a direct result of his \ninteractions with the Portland Police.  \n142.  In the weeks leading to his arrest, he had attended the protests nearly \nevery night. After June 13, he scaled his service as a medic to only two or three \nnights a week.  \n143.  He also has to be much more alert when he attends the protests, to \navoid police interaction. This is out of fear that another (wrongful) arrest could \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  33-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

The Federal Defendants beat Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest for \ntrying to render medical aid. \n144.  Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest live in Lane County and initially \nparticipated in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Eugene. Those protests \nhave included essentially no police violence. \n145.  Plaintiff Durkee is trained as an EMT and is also a mental-health \nprofessional.  \n146.  Plaintiff Guest is a former emergency medical services (EMS) \nvolunteer. \n147.  While they were participating in the Eugene protests, Plaintiffs \nDurkee and Guest watched live-stream footage and followed other social-media \nupdates about the Portland protests. They were appalled by the repeated police \nviolence they saw, especially considering that the protesters themselves appeared to \nbe demonstrating peaceably. \n148.  Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest decided to get involved in the Portland \nprotests as protest medics, not only because they felt strongly that systemic racism \nexists and has repeatedly led to police brutality against Black people, but also \nbecause they knew that their medical training could assist both the protesters and \nthe larger movement.   \n149.  When they attend the protests, and with the intent of clearly \nidentifying themselves as protest medics, they wear dark-colored clothes with high-\ngloss, red duct tape in the shape of crosses on their front and back. They also wear \ndark backpacks and helmets with the same red crosses, and wear shoulder patches \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  34-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

The crosses are identifiable during the day and at night and can \nbe seen from any angle. \na.  The Portland Police and Federal Defendants tear gas and \nphysically assault Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest. \n150.  Their first night serving as medics at the Portland protests was July 4.  \n151.  Upon information and belief, both the Portland Police and Federal \nDefendants engaged in law-enforcement activities associated with the protests that \nnight. \n152.  That night, the Portland Police and Federal Defendants employed \nviolence indiscriminately, including against members of the press, legal observers, \nand medics.  \n153.  One of the Municipal Doe Defendants or Federal Doe Defendants shot \nPlaintiff Guest with a projectile and another officer checked her in the shoulder \nwith his baton. During both those incidents, Plaintiff Guest was complying with the \nofficers’ orders to disperse and was not interfering with law-enforcement activities.  \n154.  The Portland Police forcibly pushed both Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest, \nagain, while they were attempting to comply with the officers’ orders to disperse. \n155.  Finally, the Portland Police or Federal Defendants deployed tear gas \nindiscriminately that evening. Because Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest position \nthemselves near the police line to keep a watchful eye for potential injured \nprotesters, they experienced the brunt of the tear gas. Although they could not see \nand had difficulty breathing, they tried to remain calm to avoid creating a panic. \nThey were concerned that if protesters saw medics panicking, then they too would \nstart panicking. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  35-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

The Federal Defendants assault Plaintiffs Durkee and \nGuest for attempting to render medical aid. \n156.  Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest also served as protest medics on the night \nof July 11 and into the morning of July 12. They wore their usual medics’ gear. \n157.  That night, one of the Federal Doe Defendants shot Donavan La Bella \nin the head. Plaintiff Durkee was one of the first responders, and he stayed with \nMr. La Bella, applying pressure to his head and maintaining him in the recovery \nposition until an ambulance arrived. Plaintiff Durkee’s hand is visible in this video, \napplying pressure to Mr. La Bella’s head: \nhttps://twitter.com/sparrowmedia/status/1283869468658147336?s=20  \n158.  Despite the horrific injury the Federal Defendants inflicted on Mr. La \nBella, they fired impact munitions at protesters later that night.  \n159.  Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest cared for people who had extensive \ninjuries from rubber bullets that prevented them from walking. As they moved \ninjured people out of the protest and away from the activity, they had to walk \ntoward federal agents, who were approaching from multiple directions. Some of the \nFederal Doe Defendants responded by firing pepper balls at Plaintiffs Durkee and \nGuest, as well as the injured protesters they were attempting to help.  \n160.  Additionally, as Plaintiff Guest was clearly kneeling down to help an \ninjured protester, she locked eyes with another Federal Doe Defendant.  That \nDefendant then threw a tear gas canister at her and the injured protester. It landed \non the ground near them. Plaintiff Guest then lightly kicked the tear gas canister \naway from her and the injured protester, at which point the Defendant began \nshooting her with rubber bullets. They hit her several times, leaving abrasions and \nbruises on her feet and ankles. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  36-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n161.  That night, the Federal Defendants tear gassed the area on Third \nAvenue in front of the federal courthouse, including Lownsdale Square and \nsurrounding streets, at least five or six separate times. Each time, the protesters \nwould clear the area until the tear gas dissipated, and then return to continue their \ndemonstrations. \n162.  Around 2:00 a.m. on July 5, the Federal Defendants made a large push \nto clear the area and keep protesters away for good. They deployed so much tear gas \nthat Lownsdale Square became engulfed in an essentially opaque cloud.  \n163.  Nearly simultaneously, the Portland Police brought their LRAD to the \ncorner of Third Avenue and Main Street and announced that protesters needed to \nclear the area. They began pushing protesters in the same direction as the federal \nagents were directing them. \n164.  Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest were on Southwest Broadway, between \nMain and Salmon streets, when they heard someone yell for a medic from across \nBroadway.  \n165.  As they crossed the street to provide aid, they noticed several \nprotesters attempting to carry a person who appeared to be houseless—and not a \nprotester—to safety. The protesters stayed with the person until Plaintiffs Durkee \nand Guest reached them.  \n166.  Before Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest even had time to check on the \nperson, some of the Federal Doe Defendants began rushing them. Plaintiff Guest \nsaid loudly enough for the Defendants to hear that a civilian, and not a protester, \nwas injured and needed assistance. The civilian appeared to have been severely \nnegatively affected by tear gas exposure.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  37-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Those federal agents continued to move toward Plaintiffs Durkee and \nGuest, who raised both hands and continued to plead with the agents to allow them \nto provide medical care to the clearly ailing person. The agents refused, instructing \nthem to move to the north, toward Pioneer Square.  \n168.  Plaintiff Durkee walked backwards heading north, while Plaintiff \nGuest faced frontwards. This is a tactic they use for all movement, to ensure they \nhave eyes on all things surrounding them.  \n169.  As Plaintiff Durkee walked backwards with his arms raised, one of the \nFederal Doe Defendants forcefully shoved him, causing both him and Plaintiff \nGuest to fall. Plaintiff Guest struck her arm on the ground. Some of the Federal Doe \nDefendants then beat both of them with truncheons multiple times. Video: \nhttps://twitter.com/stoggrd/status/1282432033533210625?s=20  \n170.  Their resulting injuries prevented them from serving as protest medics \nthe next evening, even though they wished to do so.  \n171.  As Plaintiff Durkee and Plaintiff Guest reflected on that evening, they \nunderstood that simply attending a protest, no matter what conduct you engage in, \nis to put your life at grave risk. They did not attend another Portland protest until \nJuly 18, after they were able to purchase helmets and other protective gear. \nG.  Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm. \n172.  Plaintiffs fear for their safety from the Portland Police’s violence. \nProtest medics who attend and provide medical aid at the protests are at risk of \nbeing hit with tear gas, rubber bullets, police batons, arrested, and more. Even \nmedics who remain at medical stations or at the rear of crowds are at risk of injury \nand arrest.

For these same reasons, Plaintiffs fear for their safety from the \nFederal Defendants’ violence. Since President Trump ordered federal agents to go to \nPortland to quell protests, the Federal Defendants have been coordinating with the \nPortland Police to violently disperse demonstrators, neutrals, and medics standing \nbehind a medical-supply table. The Federal Defendants use the same types (or \nworse) of force—chemical irritants, rubber bullets, batons—as the Portland Police. \nAnd they have emerged from unmarked vehicles clad in unmarked uniforms to \nabduct suspected protesters.  \n174.  Plaintiffs wish to continue attending protests to provide medical \ntreatment when Defendants indiscriminately injure protesters, journalists, and \nneutral legal observers. They want to offer support and comfort that when the \noutpouring of violence from the police begins, those present will be cared for. \nDefendants have prevented Plaintiffs and other medics from providing aid when \npolice have dispersed protesters and have repeatedly told medics that they will be \narrested and assaulted if they fail to stop administering first aid to injured \ndemonstrators, journalists, and neutral legal observers.  \n175.  On information and belief, countless others would serve as protest \nmedics and volunteer their time to provide medical assistance, but for fear that they \nwould be subject to violence from Defendants, have chosen to stay away.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  39-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

As long as demonstrations persist, and Defendants continue to use the same \nlevels of force, Plaintiffs and other medics will need to administer medical aid. In \nfact, Acting Secretary Wolf has said on several occasions that the Federal \nDefendants “will never surrender” and that they “will prevail” against “violent \nextremists” and “violent anarchists.”  See Figures 8 and 9 below.  \nFigure 8: Acting Secretary Wolf's since-deleted Tweet from Portland visit, \nJuly 17, 2020. \n \n \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  40-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

No matter how peaceful the protests are, Defendants will remain in \nPortland and Plaintiffs will be at risk of injury. President Trump declared that if \nthe protests start[] again, we’ll quell it again very easily. It’s not hard to do if you \nknow what you’re doing.”6 Defendants’ use of force has and will continue to cause \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \n178.  Plaintiffs fear for their safety from police violence because they have \nbeen attacked and injured repeatedly and without warning throughout the last \napproximately 50 days. Plaintiffs, as protest medics, are at risk of being hit with \n                                                 \n6   https://www.cbsnews.com/news/portland-protests-tear-gas-oregon-officials-call-\nfor-federal-authorities-to-leave/.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  41-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Even protest medics who \nremain apart from the crowd cannot carry out their humanitarian mission without \nserious risk of harm because officers specifically target them and their property. \n179.  Plaintiffs wish to continue supporting the protests by serving as \nprotest medics. They wish to continue treating protester injuries and doing their \npart to create a safer protest environment. They do so because they believe in the \nanti-racism message at the heart of the protests, and because they believe creating \na safer environment will amplify that message. \n180.  The protests in Portland are growing in size and strength in opposition \nto the growing presence of anonymous federal troops on the streets of Portland.7 \nGroups not traditionally associated with confronting police violence have begun to \nform. For example, a group of women recently stood before the Portland Justice \nCenter with locked arms and chanted: “Feds stay clear. Moms are here.”8  \n181.  Targeting protest medics limits their ability to support protesters with \nmedical care. Even a temporary deprivation of the Fourth and First Amendment \nfreedoms, including the right to free speech, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \ninjury. \n \n                                                 \n7   See Violent protest clashes turned Portland into a ‘right-wing’ boogeyman.’ \nHere’s how it happened, Washington Post, July 21, 2020, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/21/portland-feds-protests/ (describing de-\nescalation by late June, and swelling of protest size in direct response to presence of federal \nofficers in early July). \n8   From Antifa to Mothers in Helmets, Diverse Elements Fuel Portland Protests, \nNew York Times, July 19, 2020, https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/us/portland-protests.html  \n(describing disparate groups of families, businesspeople, political leaders, and young people) \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  42-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiffs incorporate all paragraphs above by reference as if fully set \nforth herein. \n183.  Plaintiffs engaged in constitutionally protected speech, as active \nparticipants in the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, Oregon. Plaintiffs \nsought to protest in support of Black lives and against systemic racism and police \nbrutality. \n184.  Plaintiffs engaged in constitutionally protected expressive conduct \nthrough their works as protest medics, by creating a safer environment for \nprotesters. Plaintiffs provided medical services, supplies, and treatment to fellow \nprotesters. Plaintiffs intended to convey a particularized message that protesters \nhave a right to engage in constitutionally protected speech without fear of violence, \nand Plaintiffs served as protest medics to take a stand against federal and law \nenforcement officials who have injured protesters. The likelihood is great that \nDefendants understand Plaintiffs’ particularized message, since Plaintiffs \nestablished themselves as medics with clearly-identifiable statements, clothing, \nequipment, and insignia.  \n185.  Defendants’ physical violence and deployment of chemical irritants and \nmunitions against Plaintiffs and other protesters would chill a person of ordinary \nfirmness from continuing to participate in protests as demonstrators and medics. \nDefendants’ actions caused grave, physical injuries and psychological trauma to \nPlaintiffs. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  43-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n186.  Defendants indiscriminately unleashed chemical irritants, deployed \nmunitions, and engaged in physical violence against Plaintiffs, establishing that \nPlaintiffs’ protected activities—and their overall message against police brutality—\nwere a substantial motivating factor in Defendants’ conduct.  \n187.  Given that Defendants’ actions would chill a person of ordinary \nfirmness from engaging in constitutionally-protected speech, and that Plaintiffs’ \nprotected activities were a substantial motivating factor in Defendants’ conduct, \nDefendants retaliated against Plaintiffs in violation of the First Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.  \n188.  As a direct result of harm that Plaintiffs have suffered, they seek \nprospective injunctive relief against the Portland Police and damages in an amount \nto be proven at trial against the individual Municipal Doe Defendants.  \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Violation of the Fourth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. §1983, Against the Portland \nPolice Officially and the Municipal Doe Defendants Individually) \n189.  Plaintiffs incorporate all paragraphs above by reference as if fully set \nforth herein.  \n190.  Plaintiffs were seized by the Portland Police when their officers \nintentionally, through chemical irritants, bullets, and physical force terminated \ntheir freedom of movement. \n191.  Plaintiffs were present at the protests to provide medical assistance. \nPlaintiffs did not commit any crimes, pose any threat to any officers or any other \nperson, or resist arrest. \n192.

The Portland Police’s \nseizure of Plaintiffs, thus, was objectively unreasonable. The Portland Police, under \ncolor of state and federal law, subjected or caused Plaintiffs to be subjected to the \ndeprivation of rights secured by the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution.  \n193.  The Portland Police seized Plaintiffs’ property when officers \nconfiscated from Plaintiffs their medical supplies and medics’ table materials, \nincluding a tent, banner, and table, without a warrant. \n194.  Plaintiffs used the medical supplies and medics’ table materials to \nprovide injured protesters with medical care.  \n195.  The Portland Police had no probable cause to associate the medical \nsupplies and medics’ table materials with criminal activity. The Portland Police’s \nseizures of Plaintiffs’ property, thus, was objectively unreasonable. Under color of \nstate and federal law, the Portland Police subjected or caused Plaintiffs to be \nsubjected to the deprivation of rights secured by the Fourth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.   \n196.  It was the City of Portland’s policy, practice, or custom, as well as its \nfailure to train and supervise its employees and agents and issue corrective \ninstructions after violations were brought to light, that caused the Fourth \nAmendment violations.  \n197.  The City of Portland’s failure to supervise and train its employees and \nagents with respect to the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs, including a \nfailure to investigate and discipline officers for Fourth Amendment violations, \namounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs.  \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  45-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \n198.  The pattern of similar constitutional violations against Plaintiffs \ndemonstrates the City of Portland’s deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ Fourth \nAmendment rights.  \n199.  In light of the multiple constitutional violations documented above, the \nneed for more supervision or training was so obvious, and the inadequacy of the \ntraining and supervision so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, \nthat the City of Portland demonstrated its deliberate indifference to the need for \nsuch training and supervision.  \n200.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear further retaliation in the future in violation \nof the Fourth Amendment if they continue to participate in constitutionally \nprotected activity.  \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Violation of the First Amendment Against the Federal Doe Defendants in \ntheir Official and Individual Capacities) \n201.  Plaintiffs incorporate all paragraphs above by reference as if fully set \nforth herein.  \n202.  This action arises under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of \nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n203.  Regardless of the existence of an implied cause of action under Bivens, \nthe federal courts have inherent authority to grant injunctive relief to direct \ncompliance of the federal government and individual federal officials with the First \nAmendment. \n204.  Plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected right under the First \nAmendment, which prohibits the federal government from “abridging the freedom of \nspeech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”  When the \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  46-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Mendocino Environmental Center v. Mendocino County, 14 F.3d 457, 464 \n(9th Cir. 1994). \n205.  Plaintiffs provide medical services to protesters as an act of expression \nand a form of speech. By their presence, they send a message to all protesters, \njournalists, and neutral legal observers that someone will be there to care for them, \neven when the Portland Police and Federal Defendants (who have their own medics \nthat exist only to assist their own), and their agents, are actively harming them. \nThe likelihood is great that the Federal Doe Defendants understand Plaintiffs’ \nparticularized message, since Plaintiffs established themselves as medics with \nclearly-identifiable statements, clothing, equipment, and insignia. \n206.  The Federal Doe Defendants, acting under color of federal authority, \nwhich includes, but is not limited to, the Executive Order, violated Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder the First Amendment, by intentionally abridging through violence and \nintimidation, the abilities of Plaintiffs to express themselves as described above. \n207.  For example, the Federal Doe Defendants intentionally violated \nPlaintiffs’ First Amendment rights as alleged above, by, among other things, firing \ntear gas and pepper balls specifically at Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest, while those \nPlaintiffs moved injured protesters out of the way and to safety.  They also \nforcefully shoved Plaintiff Durkee while he walked backwards with his arms raised, \ncausing both him and Plaintiff Guest to fall. Some of the Federal Doe Defendants \nthen beat both of them with truncheons multiple times. \n208.  The Federal Doe Defendants also fired tear gas and rubber bullets \ndirectly at Plaintiff Guest, while she attempted to provide first aid to a protester. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  47-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

And with respect to Plaintiff Wise, the Federal Doe Defendants shot \nhim in the legs with pepper balls, as he stood in clearly marked “red-cross” clothing \nin a park that did not contain any federal property. \n210.  Each of those constitutional violations caused Plaintiffs direct harm, \nincluding, but not limited to, respiratory damage, abrasions, and bruising. \n211.  Each of the Plaintiffs would like to continue to render aid to protest \nparticipants in future protests.  Each of them is in fear that the Federal Defendants \nwill take actions and perform operations to violate their First Amendment rights, as \nthey have been doing night after night. \n212.  Any available statutory remedy that the Plaintiffs might have to \nredress their harm does not provide a meaningful remedy. \n213.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be proven \nat trial. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Violation of the Fourth Amendment Against the Federal Doe Defendants \nin their Official and Individual Capacities) \n214.  Plaintiffs incorporate all paragraphs above by reference as if fully set \nforth herein.  \n215.  This action arises under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of \nFederal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \n216.  Regardless of the existence of an implied cause of action under Bivens, \nthe federal courts have inherent authority to grant injunctive relief to direct \ncompliance of the federal government and individual federal officials with the \nFourth Amendment. \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  48-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

Plaintiffs have a constitutionally protected right under the Fourth \nAmendment, which guarantees citizens the right “to be secure in their persons . . . \nagainst unreasonable . . . seizures.”  That right includes freedom from excessive \nforce by federal law enforcement officers. \n218.  The Federal Doe Defendants, acting under color of federal authority, \nwhich includes, but is not limited to, the Executive Order, violated Plaintiffs’ rights \nunder the Fourth Amendment, by using excessive force. \n219.  For example, the Federal Doe Defendants intentionally violated \nPlaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights as alleged above, by, among other things, \nfiring tear gas and pepper balls specifically at Plaintiffs Durkee and Guest, while \nthose Plaintiffs moved injured protesters out of the way and to safety. They also \nforcefully shoved Plaintiff Durkee while he walked backwards with his arms raised, \ncausing both him and Plaintiff Guest to fall.

Any available statutory remedy that the Plaintiffs might have to \nredress their harm does not provide a meaningful remedy. \n225.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in an amount to be proven \nat trial. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”) Against the Federal Defendants) \n226.  Plaintiffs incorporate all paragraphs above by reference as if fully set \nforth herein.  \n227.  As authorities of the United States Government, the Federal \nDefendants are “agencies” as defined under the federal APA. \n228.  Under the APA, the Federal Defendants are prohibited from acting in \nways that are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law” and “contrary to constitutional right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706. \n229.  The Executive Order authorizes the Federal Defendants to provide \nlaw-enforcement services in Oregon, solely for the purpose of “providing assistance \nfor the protection of federal monuments, memorials, statues, and property.” \n230.  Additionally, ORS 133.245 authorizes federal law enforcement officers \nto “arrest a person” in Oregon for violations of state law. \n231.  Notwithstanding the limitations of the Executive Order and ORS \n133.245, the Federal Defendants have adopted a policy and have given direction to \nfederal officers to engage in generalized anti-protest law enforcement, including \ndispersal of crowds with uses of force such as deployment of chemical irritants and \nmunitions to quell protest activity.  Federal officials’ public statements indicate that \nthe anti-protest law enforcement authorized and directed pursuant to these policies \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  50-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W. Couch Street, 10th Floor \n \nPortland, OR  97209-4128 \n \n  Phone:  503.727.2000 \nFax:  503.727.2222 \n\n   \nand directives are without regard to the location or other nexus with federal \nmonuments, memorials, statues, and property. \n232.  Through the above-described policies and directions, and with \nimplementation of those policies and directions against the individual Plaintiffs and \nothers, the Federal Defendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously, abused their \ndiscretion, and not in accordance with the Executive Order and ORS 133.245.  \n233.  Plaintiffs have suffered a legal wrong because of the Federal \nDefendants’ actions; they have been adversely affected or aggrieved by those \nactions; and they will continue to be adversely affected by them night after night.  \nPlaintiffs are thus entitled to judicial review thereof and injunctive relief. \n234.  Therefore, Plaintiffs request that the Court hold the Federal \nDefendants’ actions unlawful, pursuant to the APA, and grant all appropriate relief. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n(Declaratory Judgment) \n235.  Plaintiffs incorporate all paragraphs above by reference as if fully set \nforth herein. \n236.  Plaintiffs intend to continue rendering aid to protest attendees in \nPortland as a show of their solidarity and support for the protesters’ message, the \nBlack Lives Matter movement, and for their own message to Defendants that their \nviolence will not deter Oregonians from exercising their free speech rights. \nPlaintiffs are fearful, however, that they will be subjected to police violence or \ndispersed without reason. Plaintiffs are also fearful that the police will continue to \nuse “kettling” tactics against protesters that sweep in all protest attendees. \n237.  As a result of the acts described in the preceding paragraphs, there \nexists a controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant issuing a \nPerkins Coie LLP \n  51-  COMPLAINT \n1120 N.W.

As a result of the acts described in the preceding paragraphs, there \nexists a controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant issuing a \ndeclaratory judgment that threatening Plaintiffs with arrest, arresting them, and \ntargeting them for uses of force, while they were engaged in constitutionally \nprotected acts of speech and expressive conduct during protests, including rendering \nfirst aid to protest attendees, violates the Fourth Amendment. \n239.  A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate so that Plaintiffs \nmay ascertain their rights to engage in constitutionally protected acts of speech and \nexpressive conduct during protests, including rendering first aid to protest \nattendees. \n240.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that Defendants may \nnot threaten them with arrest, arrest them, or target them for uses of force, while \nthey are engaged in constitutionally protected acts of speech and expressive conduct \nduring protests, including rendering first aid to protest attendees. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for relief against Defendants as follows: \nA.
