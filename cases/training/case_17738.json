The suit was brought by the Texas Civil Rights Project as next friend for one hundred unaccompanied migrant children who had been arrested by Customs and Border Protection. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Immigration Rights Project, the ACLU Foundation of Texas, Oxfam America, the Center for Gender and Refugees Studies, and the ACLU of D.C.. They sued the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Rodney Scott, Director of Immigration Customs and Enforcement Matthew Albence, Secretary of HHS Alex Azar, and CDC Director Robert Redfield. The complaint contended that the federal government had implemented a new process of removing immigrant children without providing for adequate protections, especially by holding those children away from their families or other sponsors and by not providing counsel. This process was instituted over a series of regulations, orders, and agency memos that the complaint calls the \"Title 42 Process.\" The complaint argued that this Title 42 Process violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), and that agencies exceed the power granted to them under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. They requested declaratory relief and injunctive relief that would prohibit the defendants from enforcing the Title 42 Process, stay their removal, grant them counsel, and grant the children TVPRA protections.</p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell. </p><p>A few weeks later, on August 6, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case, even before defendants responded -- they did not give an explanation as to why they dismissed the case. In a minute order on August 10, Judge Howell dismissed the case without prejudice and closed the case.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case was brought by Texas Civil Rights Project as next friend for one hundred unaccompanied migrant children against top executives of the Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the CDC, and the HHS. They argued that a group of regulations, orders, and memos made up a process called \"Title 42 Process,\" which skirted statutory law requiring certain safeguards on the removal of unaccompanied immigrant minors. While the process was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the plaintiffs argued that the process was an illegal expansion of executive authority. \r\n\r\nHowever, a few weeks later, before defendants responded, the plaintiffs withdrew the complaint without explaining why. The case is now closed. ",

This case challenges the government’s unprecedented new system for restricting \nimmigration along the Canadian and Mexican borders in the name of public health and under the \npurported authority of 42 U.S.C. § 265.  This system is established in a set of agency \ndocuments—a new regulation, several orders, and an implementation memo—which Plaintiffs \ncollectively refer to as the “Title 42 Immigration Process” or “Title 42 Process.” \n2.  Among other things, the Title 42 Process authorizes the summary expulsion of \nunaccompanied minors without any procedural protections—even if the child shows no signs of \nhaving COVID-19, and even if the child is fleeing danger and seeking protection in the United \nStates. \n3.  Texas Civil Rights Project (“TCRP”) files suit on behalf of dozens of unnamed migrant \nminors who came to the United States unaccompanied, were apprehended by U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (“CBP”), were subjected to the Title 42 Process, and who—as of July 23, \n2020— were temporarily housed in Hampton Inn & Suites McAllen, 10 West Expressway 83, \nMcAllen, Texas 78501, as they await their deportation pursuant to the Title 42 Process \n(hereinafter “Unnamed Children”).   \n4.  The Unnamed Children are entitled to access to counsel by statute, yet TCRP has been \ndenied access to these children to inform them or their relatives of their legal rights. \n5.  Prior to the Title 42 Process, and pursuant to longstanding immigration statutes \nprotecting children and those seeking protection, the children should have been given shelter in \nchildren’s facilities until they could be released to family members or suitable sponsors in the \nUnited States, and are entitled to a full hearing, and appeals, to determine their right to \nhumanitarian protection in the United States.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 4 of 34\n \n6.  Through the Title 42 Process, the Administration has sought to usurp Congress’s role and \nbypass the entire immigration statutory scheme.  Specifically, the Administration contends that \npublic health provisions in Title 42 of the U.S. Code—provisions that have rarely been used and \nnever in this way—entitle it to set aside the immigration laws.   \n7.  But those public health provisions do not authorize this unprecedented Title 42 \nImmigration Process.  Title 42 authorizes various powers, such as testing and quarantines, but \nhas never been interpreted to authorize the broad powers the government is claiming here.  And \neven if Title 42 permits the expulsion of some individuals, that power would not apply to \nchildren or those seeking protection from persecution or torture.  The statutes protecting children \nand those seeking protection were enacted after the Title 42 provisions and contain no exception \nfor individuals with communicable diseases.   \n8.  In fact, communicable diseases have a long history in immigration law, and Congress has \nsquarely addressed how to handle them.  Under the specific immigration provisions enacted by \nCongress, if a border official suspects that an arriving noncitizen has a communicable disease \ndeemed serious by the government, the official has numerous options, including testing and even \nquarantine.  But children and others seeking protection may under no circumstances be deported \nwithout a hearing to determine their right to remain in the United States (even if that means a \nperiod of quarantine is required).  The Administration’s use of Title 42 is a transparent end-run \naround Congress’s considered decision to provide protection to children and others fleeing \ndanger even where communicable disease is a concern—and to address that concern through the \nuse of testing and quarantines, not summary deportations. \n9.  Not only does the Title 42 Process violate the immigration statutes, but its application to \nunaccompanied children is patently arbitrary and capricious from a public health standpoint.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 5 of 34\n \n10.  The principal stated justifications for the Title 42 Process are that it is necessary to \nprotect border officers and that the introduction of persons into congregate settings poses a \ndanger to public health.  Specifically, the government asserts that when a person arrives at the \nborder seeking protection and lacks a visa, border agents from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) will be forced to spend additional time screening the individual under the \nimmigration laws, thereby exposing the officers to great danger.  But as public health experts \nhave uniformly explained, numerous safety measures are available, including social distancing, \nface masks, and gloves.  Under the normal operation of the immigration laws, the children would \nhave been promptly sent to a shelter where trained workers would have cared for them, or to the \ncustody of a family member, who would have ensured they stayed safe.  \n11.  Moreover, under the regular operation of immigration laws governing children, an \nunaccompanied child who arrives from Central America is transferred to the custody of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), part of the Department of Health and Human Services \n(“HHS”) within 72 hours of the child’s apprehension.   \n12.  Instead, unaccompanied minors like the children at issue here are regularly being held at \nhotels for multiple days as Defendants arrange for their deportation.  In one reported case, the \nchild was held in a hotel for as long as 19 days.  This increases the risk of exposure to COVID-\n19 both for border enforcement agents and the children themselves.  Thus, the Title 42 Process \nincreases the amount of time children spend with DHS officers, because it often takes longer \nthan 72 hours to find air transportation to deport them.  \n13.  Unaccompanied children are also entitled to access to counsel to represent them in legal \nproceedings or matters and to protect them from mistreatment.  But because Defendants are \nholding the unaccompanied children in secret, and without the regular access to attorneys \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 6 of 34\n \navailable in children’s facilities, they have been unable to communicate with attorneys ready to \nrepresent them. \n14.  Whatever the Administration’s motivation for applying the Title 42 Process to children \nseeking protection may be, the Process is unlawful.  Many, if not all, of the unaccompanied \nchildren at issue here would face grave danger if returned to their home countries and must be \ngiven the opportunity to access counsel and remain in the United States to receive the statutory \nprotections to which they are entitled under the laws passed by Congress.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  This case arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701, et \nseq.; the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. and its implementing \nregulations; the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), see Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 \nStat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231); and the Public Health Service \nAct of 1944, 42 U.S.C § 264, et seq. \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), and the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.  See also 5 U.S.C. § 702 (waiver of \nsovereign immunity). \n17.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants are agencies of the \nUnited States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacity, Defendants reside \nin this District, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred \nin this District. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 7 of 34\n \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n18.  Unnamed Unaccompanied Children #1-100 (hereinafter “Unnamed Children”) are \nunaccompanied migrant children who came to the United States and, on information and belief, \nwere put in the Title 42 Process.  As of July 23, 2020, they were being temporarily housed in \nHampton Inn & Suites McAllen located at 10 West Expressway 83, McAllen, Texas 78501, as \nthey await their expulsion pursuant to the Title 42 Process.  On information and belief, their \ndeportation is imminent.  The government has not disclosed the precise number of \nunaccompanied children at the hotel, their names, ages, countries of origin, or other details.   \n19.  The Unnamed Children sue by and through their Next Friend, Texas Civil Rights Project \n(“TCRP”), a nonprofit organization based in Austin, Texas, with offices throughout the state.  \nTCRP’s mission is to promote racial, social, and economic justice through legal advocacy and \nlitigation, education, and social services for low-income persons least able to defend themselves.  \nAs an essential part of this mission, TCRP has been dedicated to defending the rights of \nimmigrant communities for nearly 30 years, including serving the legal needs of unaccompanied \nchildren and asylum seekers in the McAllen area and across the state of Texas.  For example, \nTCRP has recently represented seven children subject to the Title 42 Process, who are both in \nand outside the United States.   \n20.  TCRP has specifically sought to offer free legal representation to the children detained in \nthe Hampton Inn & Suites McAllen, but Defendants prevented them from accessing the hotel or \nspeaking directly to the children detained there.  As an organization that regularly represents \nvulnerable individuals, including immigrant children, in immigration-related civil rights matters, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 8 of 34\n \nTCRP is and will be an effective advocate for the Unnamed Children and is truly dedicated to \ntheir best interests.     \nDefendants \n21.  Defendant Chad Wolf is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, which is a cabinet-\nlevel department of the U.S. government.  In that capacity, Defendant Wolf is responsible for the \nadministration of the immigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103.

In that capacity, he authorized the Title 42 Process at issue in this case. \nFACTS \nUnaccompanied Children in the Immigration System \n28.  Every day, unaccompanied children flee persecution and danger in their home countries \nand journey to the United States seeking safety.  Many of them come from El Salvador, \nHonduras, and Guatemala because of the escalating influence of powerful gangs that control \nlarge swaths of these countries and frequently target children.  Many unaccompanied children \nfrom these Central American countries are also fleeing gender-based, family-based, and other \ntypes of violence. \n29.  In recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of unaccompanied children and their critical \nneed for protection, Congress has passed two laws to guarantee their proper care and facilitate \ntheir efforts to seek humanitarian relief.   \n30.  In 2002, Congress included provisions in the Homeland Security Act that transferred \nresponsibility for the care and custody of unaccompanied children from the former Immigration \nand Naturalization Service to ORR, which is part of HHS.  6 U.S.C. § 279(a).  Congress enacted \nthis provision because it saw that immigration enforcement-oriented agencies were ill-equipped \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 10 of 34\n \nto care for unaccompanied children.  Congress therefore vested responsibility for the care of \nunaccompanied children, including the provision of housing and access to legal services to \npursue claims for immigration relief, in an agency—ORR—that had demonstrated experience \nworking with vulnerable immigrants and refugees.   \n31.  In 2008, Congress then enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n(“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, which established even stronger protections for unaccompanied \nchildren.  The TVPRA created a number of significant safeguards concerning the care, custody, \nand removal proceedings of unaccompanied children, and confirmed ORR’s responsibility to \nensure their care.1   \n32.  Under the TVPRA, unaccompanied children from “noncontiguous countries”—i.e., \ncountries other than Canada and Mexico—must be transferred to ORR custody within 72 hours \nafter their apprehension, absent exceptional circumstances.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3).  Children \nfrom Canada and Mexico are subject to an initial screening to determine whether they must be \nreferred to ORR custody.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), (a)(3).  \n33.  After referral from CBP, ORR is responsible under the statute for housing and caring for \nunaccompanied children.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c).  The statute requires ORR to “promptly” place the \nchild “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.”   8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(2)(A).  Such placements can include referral to shelters or care facilities operated by \nentities that contract with ORR.   \n34.  ORR does not operate its own housing facilities for unaccompanied children.  Instead, \nORR contracts with providers throughout the country who operate shelters, group homes, foster \ncare programs, and other living situations for the children.  The shelter providers take care of the \n                                                 \n1 Although the TVPRA refers to HHS, ORR (as an HHS subagency) carries out these statutory \nfunctions.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 11 of 34\n \nchildren’s day-to-day needs, such as food, housing, education, and medical treatment.  The \nproviders operate under ORR’s direction and supervision, and must comply with federal \nstandards and ORR guidelines governing the care of unaccompanied children.   \n35.  ORR is also statutorily required to evaluate options for the child’s release from federal \ncustody to a family member or other adult who can care for the child.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A).  \nOften, unaccompanied children traveling to the United States can reunite with parents or family \nmembers already here, which enables ORR to facilitate swift releases. \n36.  The TVPRA also includes safeguards concerning the removal proceedings of \nunaccompanied children from noncontiguous countries, and those children from contiguous \ncountries who pass the screening.  Most importantly, if DHS seeks to remove a child, the child \nmust be put into full removal proceedings before an immigration judge, with the opportunity for \nan administrative appeal and review in the court of appeals.  Children cannot be removed via \nfast-track removal processes applicable to others.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(i).   \n37.  Unaccompanied children are also entitled to access to counsel.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(a)(5)(D)(iii), (c)(5).  The statute requires that in addition to placing such children into \nremoval proceedings, they must be “provided access to counsel in accordance with [8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(5).”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(iii).  See § 1232(c)(5) (“[t]o the greatest extent \npracticable, the Secretary of [HHS] shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono \ncounsel who agree to provide representation to such children without charge”).  \n38.  Unaccompanied children are also entitled to other statutory procedural protections, \nincluding eligibility for the appointment of a child advocate to look out for their interests, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(c)(6).  Through these provisions, Congress recognized that unaccompanied \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 12 of 34\n \nchildren require special safeguards to ensure their full access to humanitarian relief from \nremoval. \n39.  In short, an unaccompanied child from a non-contiguous country must automatically be \nallowed to remain in the country, transferred within 72 hours to ORR custody, have access to \ncounsel, and placed in full immigration proceedings, where he can apply for asylum and other \nprotections under which he may ultimately receive permission to remain in the United States.  \nThere is no screening before the child is transferred to ORR and placed in immigration \nproceedings, other than checking that he is unaccompanied and from a non-contiguous country.   \n40.  Even apart from the TVPRA, unaccompanied children, like other noncitizens, have \nstatutory rights to seek relief in the United States from persecution and torture.  Three forms of \nrelief are possible: asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from torture.    \n41.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) provides, with certain enumerated \nexceptions—that do not include public health concerns—that “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated \nport of arrival . . . ), irrespective of such alien’s status,” may apply for asylum.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(1).  To qualify for asylum, a noncitizen must show a “well-founded fear of \npersecution” on account of a protected ground.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).  Congress has \nexpanded asylum eligibility for unaccompanied children, by exempting them from various \nrequirements applicable to adults, including the one-year deadline for filing an application.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E).   \n42.  Second, in keeping with this country’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention \nand the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, Congress has barred the removal of an \nindividual to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face persecution on a \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 13 of 34\n \nprotected ground.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).  This form of relief, known as “withholding of \nremoval,” requires the applicant to meet a higher burden with respect to the likelihood of harm \nbut is mandatory if the standard is met. \n43.  Third, the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), implemented by FARRA, prohibits the \ngovernment from returning a noncitizen to a country where it is more likely than not that he \nwould face torture.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note. \nThe Treatment of Communicable Diseases Under the Immigration Laws \n44.  The immigration system has long had to deal with communicable diseases.  Congress has \nthus enacted specific immigration provisions to address them, dating back to the late 1800s when \nCongress first began regulating immigration. \n45.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1) contains various “health-related” grounds of inadmissibility.  The \nstatute applies to various noncitizens who present specified public health concerns, such as \nnoncitizens who have “communicable disease[s] of public health significance,” id. \n§ 1182(a)(1)(A)(i); who have not been vaccinated against certain widespread infectious diseases \n(e.g., mumps, measles, rubella), id. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(ii); who have “physical or mental \ndisorder[s]” that may present “threat[s] to the property, safety, or welfare” of self or others, id. \n§ 1182(a)(1)(A)(iii); or “drug abuser[s] or addict[s],” id. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(iv).  But these statutes \ndo not permit the deportation of individuals without a screening for persecution or torture, and do \nnot permit the summary deportation of children in violation of the TVPRA.   \n46.  The immigration statute also contains a detention provision that applies to certain \nnoncitizens “arriving at ports of the United States” who may be inadmissible on the health-\nrelated grounds, or who come “from a country or have embarked at a place where any of such \ndiseases are prevalent or epidemic.”  8 U.S.C. § 1222(a).  Such noncitizens may only be detained \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 14 of 34\n \n“for a sufficient time to . . . subject [them] to observation and an examination,” id., but may not \nbe deported without a screening for persecution or torture as the immigration statutes require. \nThe Administration’s Efforts to Bar Immigrants and the New Title 42 Process \n47.  The current Administration has repeatedly and publicly stated that restricting access to \nasylum, as well as eliminating the TVPRA, are among its key immigration objectives.  The \nPresident, his close advisors, and a succession of agency officers have repeatedly stated that the \nTVPRA creates a “loophole” in the border that they seek to close.  They have characterized \nunaccompanied children as dangerous gang members seeking to exploit the immigration laws.   \n48.  The administration has also sought to use numerous regulatory and policy mechanisms to \nprevent noncitizens from seeking protection in this country, but the Title 42 Process at issue here \ngoes further than any of those efforts because it leaves almost no avenue open to seek protection. \n49.  Before COVID-19, Administration officials discussed using public health powers to \nrestrict immigration and circumvent the protections in the immigration laws.      \n50.  Notwithstanding the clear statutory framework that requires the United States to allow \npeople arriving at the border (with or without valid travel documents) to apply for asylum, \nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief, and to provide special protections to unaccompanied \nchildren, the President announced on March 20, 2020, that the CDC would issue an order \npursuant to the public health provisions of Title 42 of the U.S. Code “to suspend the introduction \nof all individuals seeking to enter the U.S. without proper travel documentation” across the \nnorthern and southern borders.  The President stated that the order would be executed by \n“immediately returning” such individuals “without delay.”   \n51.  The specific provision of Title 42 invoked by the Administration was § 265.  That \nprovision dates to 1893 and was later reenacted in substantially the same language in the modern \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 15 of 34\n \nPublic Health Service Act of 1944.  Section 265 provides in relevant part: The Surgeon General \nmay “prohibit . . . the introduction of persons or property” from designated places where “by \nreason of the existence of any communicable disease in a foreign country there is serious danger \nof the introduction of such disease into the United States.”2 \n52.  Deportation has never been an available penalty under § 265, and in fact, § 265 applies to \nboth noncitizens and citizens.  Rather, the Public Health Service Act prescribes certain civil and \ncriminal penalties for violations of § 265, including “a fine of not more than $1,000 or . . . \nimprisonment for not more than one year, or both.”  42 U.S.C. § 271(a). \n53.  Although § 265 and its predecessors have existed since 1893, no regulation implementing \nthat statute has ever authorized the broad immigration powers Defendants are claiming here.     \n54.  To exercise this new immigration power, the CDC thus issued a new regulation, without \nadvance notice and comment, on the same day as the President’s announcement.  Control of \nCommunicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of Introduction of Persons Into United \nStates From Designated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes, 85 Fed. Reg. \n16559-01 (Mar. 24, 2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020). \n55.  Specifically, the regulation added a new provision, 42 C.F.R. § 71.40, which provides \nthat the CDC may prohibit the “introduction into the United States of persons” from foreign \ncountries.  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563; see 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(a).  The public notice of the regulation \ninterpreted the “introduction of persons” in 42 U.S.C. § 265 to “encompass those who have \nphysically crossed a border of the United States and are in the process of moving into the interior \nin a manner the [CDC] Director determines to present a risk of transmission of a communicable \n                                                 \n2 In 1966, the Surgeon General transferred its § 265 authority to what is now HHS.  In 2001, \nHHS delegated this authority to the CDC.  The President’s functions under § 265 were assigned \nto the Secretary of HHS in a 2003 executive order.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 16 of 34\n \ndisease.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563; see 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(b)(1).  And it interpreted “serious \ndanger of the introduction of [a particular communicable] disease into the United States” in \n§ 265 as meaning “the potential for introduction of vectors of the communicable disease into the \nUnited States, even if persons or property in the United States are already infected or \ncontaminated with the [same] communicable disease.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563; see 42 C.F.R. \n§ 71.40(b)(2). \n56.  The regulation exempted U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (“LPRs”), and \nmembers of the armed forces, stating that the “CDC believes that, at present, quarantine, \nisolation, and conditional release, in combination with other authorities, while not perfect \nsolutions, can mitigate” the spread of COVID-19 by such individuals.  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,564; \nsee 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(e), (f).   \n57.  The regulation also provides that, if an order suspending the introduction of persons “will \nbe implemented in whole or in part” by CBP, “then the [CDC] Director shall, in coordination \nwith the Secretary of Homeland Security or other applicable Federal department or agency head, \nexplain in the order the procedures and standards by which any authorities or officers or agents \nare expected to aid in the enforcement of the order.”  42 C.F.R. § 71.40(d)(2); see 85 Fed. Reg. at \n16,564. \n58.  Pursuant to its new regulatory authority, the CDC issued a 30-day “Order Under Sections \n362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 265, 268] Suspending Introduction \nof Certain Persons From Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists.”  85 Fed. Reg. \n17,060-17088 (Mar. 26, 2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020).  The Order directed the \n“immediate suspension of the introduction” of certain persons, referred to as “covered aliens.”  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 17,067.  “Covered aliens” are those seeking to enter the United States through \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 17 of 34\n \nCanada or Mexico who “seek[] to enter . . . at POEs [ports of entry] who do not have proper \ntravel documents, aliens whose entry is otherwise contrary to law, and aliens who are \napprehended near the border seeking to unlawfully enter the United States between POEs.”  85 \nFed. Reg. at 17,061.  Section 365 of the Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 268, provides that “[i]t shall \nbe the duty of the customs officers and of Coast Guard officers to aid in the enforcement of \nquarantine rules and regulations.”  42 U.S.C. § 268(b). \n59.  A principal justification for these restrictions was that “[t]he introduction into congregate \nsettings in land POEs and Border Patrol stations” of such individuals risks “transmission and \nspread of COVID-19 to CBP personnel” and others.  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061. \n60.  The Order directs the forcible return of individuals back to the country from which they \nentered (Canada or Mexico), their home country, or another location.  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,067.   \n61.  Although the Order is issued by the CDC, and the regulation provides that the CDC and \nDHS must coordinate in developing corresponding procedures and standards, 42 C.F.R. \n§ 71.40(d)(2), the Order states that CBP “developed an operational plan for implementing the \norder.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,067.   \n62.  In addition to repeating the regulatory exceptions for U.S. citizens and LPRs, the Order \nexempts from the ban the spouses and children of citizens and LPRs (whether or not they have \nvalid documents); persons from foreign countries with valid travel documents; and persons from \ncountries in the visa waiver program who present at ports of entry.  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  The \nvisa waiver program applies to nationals of 39 countries. \n63.  The Order also states that DHS customs officers could, in their discretion, determine that \na noncitizen “should be excepted [from the Order] based on the totality of the circumstances, \nincluding consideration of significant law enforcement, officer and public safety, humanitarian, \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 18 of 34\n \nand public health interests.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  Other than stating that a supervisor must \napprove such exceptions, the Order contains no standards or further procedures for exercising \nthat discretion.  See id.  \n64.  The Order and regulation are silent on their application to individuals seeking asylum, \nwithholding of removal, or CAT protection, and are likewise silent regarding their application to \nunaccompanied children. \n65.   The March 20 Order was extended for an additional 30 days on April 20, 2020.  \nExtension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act, 85 Fed. Reg. \n22,424 (Apr. 22, 2020) (effective date Apr. 20, 2020). \n66.  On May 20, 2020, the CDC extended the Order indefinitely, and amended it to cover both \nland and coastal ports of entry and Border Patrol stations.  Amendment and Extension of Order \nUnder Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 31,503 (May 26, \n2020) (effective date May 21, 2020). \n67.  The May 20 amended Order acknowledges that “certain areas of the country are \nbeginning a phased reopening of their communities,” but states that “[a]t this critical juncture, it \nwould be counterproductive to . . . relax[] restrictions” on the immigration of persons “who pose \na risk of further introducing COVID-19 into the United States.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 31,505.  As with \nthe prior two 30-day Orders, a principal justification articulated for the indefinite Order was the \ndanger to border agents who would have to inspect persons who come without documents.  \n68.  The CDC acknowledged that there were alternatives to expulsion but concluded that it \nwas not worth the resources for those, like children and asylum seekers, who lacked documents.  \nThe CDC also presumed, without evidence, that those without documents covered by the Order \nwould lack a means of self-quarantining. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 19 of 34\n \nCBP’s Implementation of the Title 42 Process \n69.  On April 2, 2020, CBP issued a memorandum (“CBP Memo”) describing the agency’s \nimplementation of the Title 42 Process, an effort it calls “Operation Capio.”  CBP Memo 2.   \n70.  To determine whether a noncitizen is “subject to the CDC Order,” the CBP Memo \ninstructs officers to use “experience” and “physical observation” to determine whether they \n“believe[] that it is more likely than not” that the person whom they encounter in “[e]nforcement \nefforts on the SWB [southwestern border] and NB [northern border],” anywhere “within the area \nof operation of a Border Patrol station or POE operated by CBP,” is “seeking to enter” without \nproper travel documents at or between POEs.  CBP Memo 1.   \n71.  Covered noncitizens “will be transported to the nearest POE and immediately returned to \nMexico or Canada, depending on their point of transit.”  CBP Memo at 3.  Those who are “not \namenable to immediate expulsion to Mexico or Canada, will be transported to a dedicated \nfacility for limited holding prior to expulsion” to their home country.  Id.  Such facilities can be \n“a tent, soft-sided facility or predesignated CBP/USBP facility with dedicated space.”  Id. \n72.  The CBP Memo provides no instructions on medical screenings or other procedures for \ndetermining whether a covered noncitizen may have COVID-19. \n73.  The CBP Memo does not exempt minors from forcible expulsion.   \n74.  CBP deported nearly 1,000 unaccompanied children in March and April.  In May, over \n1,000 unaccompanied children were taken into CBP custody, and only 39 of these children were \ntransferred to ORR shelters rather than being summarily expelled.  On June 25, 2020, Defendant \nMark Morgan, Acting Commissioner of CBP, testified before Congress that over 2,000 \nunaccompanied children have been deported under the Title 42 Process.  CBP reported that in \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 20 of 34\n \nJune, they apprehended over 1,600 unaccompanied children, only 61 (less than four percent) \nwere transferred to ORR custody. \n75.  In addition to deporting children to their home countries, CBP has turned back multiple \nchildren to Mexico in the middle of the night. \n76.  CBP also temporarily houses unaccompanied children in hotels as they await deportation \nflights.  Unaccompanied children subject to the Title 42 Process are often in the hotels for \nmultiple days.  One of these hotels is the Hampton Inn & Suites located at 10 West Expressway \n83, McAllen, Texas 78501. \n77.  The number of referrals of unaccompanied children to ORR has thus plummeted.  Before \nthe Title 42 Process, ORR shelters received as many as 77 children daily.  But in April, daily \nreferrals dropped to the single digits, and ORR stated it received only 58 children from CBP that \nmonth.  That same month, CBP apprehended over 700 unaccompanied children at the Southwest \nborder.  In May 2020, the total number of children in ORR custody was reportedly about 1,600, \ndown from approximately 12,500 children in April 2019.  As of mid-June, ORR had less than \n975 children, a 72% decline from the number of children in custody in late March. \n78.  CDC suggested in the May 20 Order that there has been a reduced rate of transmission \nand that this is due to reduced number of “covered aliens” at ports of entry and border patrol \nstations.  CDC, however, offered no evidence of this causal link. \n79.  The use of the term “Title 42 Immigration Process” or “Title 42 Process” throughout this \ncomplaint refers to the new regulation, all three of the CDC Orders—the original March 20 \norder, the April 20 extension, and the May 20 indefinite extension and amendment—and the \nCBP Memo collectively. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 21 of 34\n \nDefendants Seek to Expel the Unnamed Children Under the Title 42 Process \n80.  On information and belief, the Unnamed Children here are some of the many \nunaccompanied children subject to summary expulsions by DHS pursuant to the Title 42 \nProcess.  They have been apprehended and are awaiting their expulsion flights.   \n81.  As of July 23, 2020, Defendants were temporarily housing the Unnamed Children at \nHampton Inn & Suites located at 10 West Expressway 83, McAllen, Texas 78501 (“McAllen \nHampton”).   \n82.  Defendants have not publicly disclosed information about the names of the Unnamed \nChildren, their ages, countries of origin, length of stay, the total number of children, or other \npertinent information.   \n83.  However, a special monitor appointed in another federal litigation has publicly reported \nthat unaccompanied children subject to the Title 42 Process are “regularly” housed at the \nMcAllen Hampton.  Interim Report on the Use of Temporary Housing for Minors and Families \nUnder Title 42 by Independent Monitor, Flores v. Barr, No. 85-cv-04544 (C.D. Cal July 22, \n2020), ECF No. 873 at 8.  On July 16, 2020, for instance, the hotel housed 22 unaccompanied \nminors (and, separately, 21 families).  Id. at 10.   \n84.  The average length of detention of unaccompanied minors at hotels while waiting for \ndeportation flights under the Title 42 Process is 4.5 days.  Id. at 12.  \n85.  A 5-year-old was recently detained for 19 days at the McAllen Hampton Inn & Suites. \n86.  On information and belief, the Unnamed Children do not currently have other legal \nrepresentation.  Plaintiff TCRP sought to represent the Unnamed Children by going to the \nMcAllen Hampton and trying to inform the children detained there that TCRP could provide free \nlegal representation in immigration-related matters.  However, Defendants prevented TCRP from \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 22 of 34\n \napproaching the children’s hotel rooms and did not allow them to speak with any child detained \nat the hotel. \n87.  All of the Unnamed Children are entitled to the special procedure and protections \navailable to unaccompanied minors under the immigration laws. \n88.  Unaccompanied children ordinarily journey to the United States to flee persecution or \ntorture and to reunite with family members, often a parent, who resides in the United States.  On \ninformation and belief, most, if not all, of the Unnamed Children are eligible for humanitarian \nprotections. \n89.  The threat of persecution and torture to these children is imminent and real.  For instance, \nmany unaccompanied children are from the Northern Triangle (Honduras, Guatemala, and El \nSalvador), one of the most violent regions in the world with high rates of murder.  And children \nare not exempt from this widespread danger.  Indeed, many children are targeted specifically by \ngang members for recruitment or experience gender-related violence.   \n90.  On information and belief, if the Unnamed Children are allowed to remain the United \nStates, they could live with their respective family members who currently reside in the United \nStates and are waiting for them, or other suitable sponsors. \n91.  Even if the Unnamed Children were required to first reside for a short time in ORR \nchildren shelters, they could do so safely.  There are ORR facilities that have experience with \ncommunicable diseases.  Moreover, because ORR facilities are currently well under capacity, \nsocial distancing and quarantine would be possible. \n92.  Even before the Title 42 Process took effect, the ORR-contracted shelter network was \noperating significantly below capacity.  The system can house approximately 14,000 children.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 23 of 34\n \nNews reports stated that in the first two months of 2020, ORR was housing only about 2,000 to \n3,000 children nationwide.   \n93.  After the Title 42 Process went into place, the numbers dropped even more precipitously.  \nAs of July 17, 2020, the number of children detained in ORR custody was reportedly at about \n820—about 6 percent of total capacity. \n94.  Because these children can be been transferred directly to their sponsors or to an ORR \nshelter, they would pose minimal, if any, additional risk to border agents. \n95.  On information and belief, many of the Unnamed Children have stayed in DHS custody \nfar longer than the time it would have taken to transfer them to their family members or to an \nORR facility.  \n96.  The Title 42 Process is not justified by public health concerns.  A principal justification is \nthat border agents will have greater exposure if they are required to process individuals who lack \ndocuments and that it is therefore necessary to deport such individuals to reduce the risk to \nagents.  But, arranging for air transport to deport individuals will generally take longer than the \n72 hours in which DHS must transfer children to ORR or family members. \nThe Unnamed Children are Hindered from Advocating for Their Own Interests  \n97.  Children subject to the Title 42 Process face numerous problems accessing legal \nrepresentation.  These problems also prevent the Unnamed Children from advancing their own \ninterests, either via litigation or other means.   \n98.  The first problem is the speed of the Title 42 Process.  Because unaccompanied children \nsubjected to the Title 42 Process can be deported in a matter of days, there is generally a very \nsmall window of time when the child is in the United States.  Sometimes, the first notification \nany family member has that the child is subject to the Title 42 Process is a call from a consular \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 24 of 34\n \nofficial who is notifying the family member that the child is scheduled for imminent deportation.  \nBy the time that relative gets such a call and reaches an advocate who can help them, the child \nmay already have been deported.   \n99.  The second problem is the secrecy of the Title 42 Process.  Until recently, the public and \nimmigration lawyers knew almost nothing about how the Title 42 Process operated.  For \nexample, it took weeks for the public and immigration lawyers to determine that children were \nbeing held in hotels prior to their expulsion.  And for a long time, the specific locations and \nhotels that held children were largely unknown.  Only in recent weeks did news reports and other \nsources publish some of those hotels and locations.  And because the Title 42 Process is set up as \na shadow immigration system, the rules and procedures that previously applied to \nunaccompanied children are no longer being applied, meaning that immigration lawyers and \nother advocates cannot access them as they previously could (for example, by meeting them at \nORR shelters).  Accordingly, organizations such as TCRP have had to alter their normal \noperations in their attempts to gain access to these children, including by conducting their own \nresearch and investigation to determine how the Title 42 Process operates and how to find \nchildren subject to it. \n100.  The third problem is that children are frequently unable to advocate effectively for \nthemselves, especially against government officers.  Numerous scientific studies have confirmed \nwhat common sense teaches, which is that an untrained young child feels intimidated in a \ncustodial setting, and is less able than an adult to resist pressure from government officers.  \nTherefore, children—particularly younger children—are generally less able to perform simple \nadvocacy tasks, such as asking an officer to make a phone call, or asserting their right to talk to a \nlawyer.  Unaccompanied children are even less able to advocate for themselves because they do \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 25 of 34\n \nnot generally speak English, or have even a basic comprehension of the U.S. immigration \nsystem.  And on information and belief, and based on Defendants’ implementation memo, \nDefendants do not affirmatively notify unaccompanied children subject to the Title 42 Process of \ntheir right to access counsel, if they do not already have counsel. \n101.  The fourth problem is that even when a child has the wherewithal to request a phone call \nto a parent or relative in the United States, or otherwise manages to contact someone in the \noutside world, that relative is similarly unable to determine how to help the child.  The parent is \nusually also an immigrant who lacks familiarity with the U.S. legal system, and may not speak \nmuch English.  Even if the parent receives her child’s call, that parent is likely at a loss to \ndetermine what to do or who to call, particularly given Defendants’ rejection of the ordinary \nimmigration system in favor of the novel, ill-understood, and secretive Title 42 Process.  And \nbased on the experiences of immigration lawyers, Defendants’ agents affirmatively prevent the \nchildren from disclosing their locations to their parents or relatives. \n102.  An unaccompanied child detained pursuant to the Title 42 Process must therefore \novercome a long series of barriers before finding a lawyer who can help them. \n103.  But as the experiences of immigration lawyers who work with unaccompanied children \nconfirm, very few children can overcome all of these hurdles.  Since Defendants instituted the \nTitle 42 Process, the numbers of new children coming to them for services has plummeted.  \nAlthough providers have successfully represented a handful of children subject to the Title 42 \nProcess who they have through happenstance learned of,and managed to advocate for their \nreferral to ORR custody, these children comprise a vanishingly small percentage of the numerous \nchildren who Defendants expel daily. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 26 of 34\n \nThe Title 42 Process Is An Extreme Outlier  \n104.  The Title 42 Process at issue here follows other invocations of COVID-19 by the \nAdministration to ban immigration, but it is far more extreme in seeking to eliminate statutory \nprotections for vulnerable noncitizens and children.  And it is not only a ban on entry, but \nprovides for summary expulsion for those who entered the country.   \n105.  For example, in February and March of 2020, the President issued a series of \nProclamations under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) to prohibit the entry of certain persons traveling from \nChina, Iran, and certain European countries where COVID-19 was prevalent.  However, unlike \nthe Title 42 Process, those Proclamations expressly stated that they did not restrict “any \nindividual’s eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the regulations \nissued pursuant to the legislation implementing the Convention Against Torture.”   \n106.  At the same time, the government continues to permit large numbers of people to enter \nthe United States.  In addition to the Title 42 Process at issue here, DHS issued two other orders \non March 20, 2020, which temporarily suspended “non-essential” travel from Canada and \nMexico.  Under these orders, permitted “essential travel” broadly includes citizens, returning \nLPRs, individuals traveling for medical purposes, individuals traveling to attend education \ninstitutions, individuals traveling to work in the United States (e.g., agricultural workers), truck \ndrivers moving cargo between the United States and Canada, emergency responders, and those \nengaged in military travel and operations.   \n107.  On May 22, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued an “exemption” from the President’s \nProclamations under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), which additionally permitted certain professional \nathletes, their staff, and their dependents to enter the country.  Defendant Wolf determined that it \nserved “the national interest” to permit noncitizens who compete in, inter alia, the National \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 27 of 34\n \nBasketball Association, the Professional Golfers’ Association Tour, and the National Hockey \nLeague, to enter the country and participate in sporting events. \n108.  Hundreds of thousands of individuals continue to move back and forth across the U.S.-\nMexico border every day.  Since March 20, 2020, when the Title 42 Process first went into \neffect, numerous individuals exempted from the ban have come into the United States.  \n109.  The Title 42 Process is inconsistent with how other countries have handled migration in \nthe time of COVID-19, particularly with respect to asylum seekers and other vulnerable \npopulations.  Numerous countries in Western Europe, such as Denmark, France, and Germany, \nhave exempted asylum seekers from their immigration prohibitions, and permitted them to seek \nrelief from persecution from inside their countries.  And while Canada has imposed certain \nrestrictions on the migration of adults without documentation if they do not enter at official ports \nof entry, it expressly exempts unaccompanied children from those restrictions.   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(VIOLATION OF TVPRA, 8 U.S.C. § 1232, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n \n110.   All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n111.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The APA also provides relief for a failure to act: “The reviewing court shall \n. . . compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n112.  The TVPRA, 8 U.S.C. § 1232, includes mandatory requirements for the processing, \ncustody, release, and removal of unaccompanied children.  Defendants’ subjection of Unnamed \nChildren to the Title 42 Process violates the statute in numerous ways, including that they should \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 28 of 34\n \nhave been referred to the custody of HHS or their family member (rather than be expelled); that \nthey should have been placed in full removal proceedings before an immigration judge, where \nthey would have a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims for relief; and that they have \nbeen deprived of numerous statutory safeguards designed to facilitate their safe release into the \nUnited States and ensure the fairness of their removal proceedings.   \n113.  In addition, under the TVPRA, Defendants are required to ensure the Unnamed Children \nshould have access to counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters, and protect them \nfrom mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. \n114.  Defendants’ subjection of the Unnamed Children to the Title 42 Process violates the \nTVPRA. \n115.  As a result, Defendants’ application of the Title 42 Process and regulation to Unnamed \nChildren is contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n116.  Moreover, by refusing to grant Unnamed Children the statutory protections to which the \nTVPRA entitles them, and instead planning to expel them to countries where they face threat of \npersecution and torture, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated \nby the statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(ULTRA VIRES, VIOLATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. \n265, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n117.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n118.  Title 42 of the U.S. Code does not authorize the expulsion of noncitizens from the United \nStates. \n119.  Title 42 of the U.S. Code also does not authorize the expulsion of children from the \nUnited States without affording them the protections of the TVPRA or other statutory protections \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 29 of 34\n \nafforded under the INA.  As a result, the application of the Title 42 Process to Unnamed \nChildren, which will result in their expulsion from the United States, is contrary to law.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n120.  The Title 42 Process which was purportedly established pursuant to the authority of 42 \nU.S.C. § 265, was not authorized by that provision and is ultra vires. \n121.  The application of the Title 42 Process to the Unnamed Children is contrary to law.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL, \nAND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT,  \n5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n \n122.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n123.  The “withholding of removal” statute, INA § 241(b)(3), codified at 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3), bars the removal of an individual to a country where it is more likely than not that \nhe would face persecution.  \n124.  Only an immigration judge can determine whether a minor faces a risk of persecution and \nis entitled to withholding of removal after full removal proceedings in immigration court.  8 \nC.F.R. § 1208.16(a). \n125.  Defendants applied the Title 42 Process and regulation to the Unnamed Children without \nany of these required safeguards.   \n126.  Application of the Title 42 Process and regulation to the Unnamed Children therefore \nviolated 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and its implementing regulations.   \n127.  As a result, Defendants’ actions against the Unnamed Children are contrary to law.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 30 of 34\n \n128.  In addition, by refusing to grant the Unnamed Children the procedures mandated by \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and its implementing regulations, Defendants have withheld and \nunreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(ASYLUM: VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1108(a), AND ADMINISTRATIVE \nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n \n129.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n130.  The INA provides, with certain exceptions, that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in \nthe United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of \narrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in \ninternational or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in \naccordance with this section . . . .”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \n131.  Defendants’ application of the Title 42 Process to the Unnamed Children has prevented \nthem from applying for asylum in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), and was therefore \ncontrary to law, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n132.  In addition, by refusing to grant the Unnamed Children the meaningful opportunity to \napply for asylum to which they are entitled, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed \nactions mandated by the statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(VIOLATION OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING ACT \nOF 1998, CODIFIED AT 8 U.S.C. § 1231 NOTE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE \nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n \n133.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n134.  FARRA prohibits the government from returning a noncitizen to a country where it is \nmore likely than not that he would face torture. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 31 of 34\n \n135.  Pursuant to regulation, only an immigration judge, after full removal proceedings in \nimmigration court, can determine whether a minor faces a risk of torture if removed from the \nUnited States.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a). \n136.  Defendants applied the Title 42 Process and regulation to Unnamed Children, to provide \nfor their summary expulsion without placing them into full removal proceedings.   \n137.  The application of the Title 42 Process to the Unnamed Children therefore violated \n§ 1231(b)(3), FARRA, and their implementing regulations.   \n138.  Defendants’ actions were contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n139.  In addition, by refusing to grant the Unnamed Children access to full removal \nproceedings, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the \nstatute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1101, ET SEQ., AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n \n140.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n141.  The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., sets out the sole mechanisms established by Congress \nfor the removal of noncitizens. \n142.  The INA provides that removal proceedings before an immigration judge under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a is “the sole and exclusive procedure” by which the government may determine whether \nto remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise specified” in the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n143.  The Title 42 Process creates an alternative removal mechanism.  The Title 42 Process \npurports to operate outside of the immigration laws set forth by Congress in Title 8. \n144.  Because the Title 42 Process provides for the expulsion of the Unnamed Children without \nthe procedures specified in the INA, it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1229a and the INA. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 32 of 34\n \n145.  As a result, Defendants’ actions against the Unnamed Children were contrary to law.  See \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n146.  In addition, by refusing to grant the Unnamed Children access to the procedures specified \nin the INA, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT,  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n147.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n148.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Defendants have not \narticulated a reasoned explanation for their decision to apply the Title 42 Process to the \nUnnamed Children; failed to consider relevant factors in applying the Title 42 process to them, \nincluding their statutory protections as unaccompanied children and their possible fear of \npersecution and torture; relied on factors Congress did not intend to be considered; failed to \nconsider reasonable alternatives that were less restrictive; and offered no explanation for their \ndecision to expel them from the country. \n149.   The Unnamed Children’s subjection to the Title 42 Process is arbitrary, capricious, and \ncontrary to law because it also departs from the agency’s existing policies for the processing, \ncare, custody, and removal of unaccompanied children, including unaccompanied minors with \ncontagious diseases, as well as prior policies prohibiting the return of individuals who fear \npersecution or torture, without providing a reasoned explanation for departing from these \npolicies.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully prays this Court to: \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02035   Document 1   Filed 07/24/20   Page 33 of 34\n \na.
