    "summary": "<p>This is a case challenging the Trump Administration’s oversight of the 2020 census. In the years prior to the census, the government cancelled planned field tests for census operating procedures in 2017 and 2018. The government also cancelled two of three sites for the 2018 End-to-End Census Test, dress rehearsals that serve as the basis for many final decisions about decennial census methods and operations. Additionally, the government truncated the one remaining 2018 End-to-End testing site, removing advertising and partnerships, as well as the coverage measurement operation that helped measure how many residents are missed. The government released its Final Operational Plan in early 2019 which reflected the final design for the 2020 census, according to the Bureau of the Census. </p><p>The plaintiffs were the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a non-profit progressive advocacy organization based out of New York City, as well as the City of Newburgh, New York—home to large Hispanic American, African American, and undocumented populations (groups at risk of being underreported in the census). The plaintiffs contended that the government’s plan for making the enumeration of the population included several arbitrary and capricious decisions not allowed under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 2) which would lead to an undercount of persons of color, of lower income, and of other “hard-to-count” communities. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued the Final Operational Plan included: (a) a plan to hire an unreasonably small number of enumerators; (b) a drastic reduction in the number of Bureau field offices; (c) a significant reduction in the Bureau’s communications and partnership program, including the elimination of local, physical Questionnaire Assistance Centers; (d) a decision to replace most In-Field Address Canvassing with In-Office Address Canvassing; and (e) a decision to make only limited efforts to count inhabitants of units that appeared vacant or nonexistent based on unreliable administrative records. The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court Southern District of New York on November 26, 2019. The plaintiffs requested declaratory relief and an injunction that: (a) restored the Bureau’s 2020 Partnership Program to no less than 2010 levels, adjusted for inflation and population growth; (b) augmented the Bureau’s 2020 Integrated Communications Program to achieve coverage equivalent to the 2010 Census; (c) required opening a number of in-person Questionnaire Assistance Centers commensurate to that used in the 2010 Census; and (d) increased the number of enumerators to no less than 2010 levels, adjusted for population growth.</p><p>The case was referred to Judge Jesse Furman as being possibly related to <a href=\"https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16568\"><i>State of New York v. Department of Commerce</i></a>. Judge Furman declined the case as not related on December 3, 2019, and the parties agreed to proceed with Magistrate Judge James L. Cott on the same day. Finally, the case was again assigned to Judge Alvin Hellerstein on December 11.</p><p>The government filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim on January 31, 2020. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on the same day; there was a filing error with this motion, and the plaintiffs re-filed for a preliminary injunction on February 24. Oral arguments on the motion to dismiss and the motion for preliminary injunction were held on March 17, 2020. The next day, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. </p><p>As the plaintiffs never filed an appeal of the March 18 order, the case is closed.</p>",

Sufficient \nstaffing, funding, and preparation are essential to such a monumental undertaking. Yet the \ngovernment’s  Final  Operational  Plan  for  the  2020  Census  drastically  and  arbitrarily \nreduces  the  necessary  resources  for  key  activities.  The  Bureau  has  made  especially \nirrational changes to its programs for counting African-American,  Latino, and other \nmembers of what Defendants label “hard-to-count” communities. \nAmong the irrational decisions in the Final Operational Plan are sharp reductions \nin nearly every aspect of Defendants’ field operations. Defendants will hire only one-third \nthe number of enumerators employed in 2010, when the population was smaller and trust \nin government, as measured by Defendants’ own research, was higher; will open only half \nas many field offices as in 2010; will eliminate fixed-point Questionnaire Assistance \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 2 of 35\n \nCenters  entirely;  and  will  slash  investment  in  community  partnership  programs, \nadvertising, and outreach relative to 2010. These decisions are not supported by reason. \nThey will inevitably cause a massive and differential undercount of communities of color. \nNew York City, where Plaintiff Center for Popular Democracy Action is located, and the \nCity of Newburgh, in the lower Hudson Valley, are home to hard-to-count populations. \nDifferential undercounts in these communities will dilute the political representation of \nracial and ethnic minorities and deprive them of critical federal funds. \nIn the past, federal officials have made considerable efforts to enumerate “hard-to-\ncount” populations, including African Americans, Latinos, English-language learners, and \nyoung people. These efforts reflect the recognition that an inaccurate census hurts some \ncommunities more than others. In preparing for the 2020 Census, however, the government \nhas shirked this responsibility. Defendants have been operating on the cheap, refusing to \nexpend even a portion of more than $1 billion in appropriated funds they now hold in \nreserve, despite congressional direction to spend funds on discrete activities to avoid a \ndifferential undercount.   \nDefendants’ actions violate the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nDefendants’ choices in the Final Operation Plan to eliminate and slash programming aimed \nat ameliorating a differential undercount violate the prohibition on arbitrary and capricious \nagency action. Further, the Bureau’s preparations for the 2020 Census are so deficient as \nto violate Defendants’ constitutional duty to conduct an “actual Enumeration.” \n  2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 3 of 35\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nand Article III of the U.S. Constitution.  \n2.  Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e) \nbecause Plaintiff City of Newburgh is a municipality located in the Southern District of \nNew York. The events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district and no \nreal property is involved in the action.  \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Center for Popular Democracy Action (“CPD Action”) is a § \n501(c)(4) non-profit. It works to “expand the voice and power of workers, communities of \ncolor,  and  immigrants  on  issues  of  economic  and  racial  justice.”  CPD  Action  is \nheadquartered in Brooklyn, New York, and has several hundred individual members and \ntwelve affiliates nationwide. Individual members sign a membership card and make an \nannual financial contribution or vote in CPD Action’s annual policy survey. Affiliates sign \na resolution agreeing to affiliate with and contribute dues to CPD Action. Together, CPD \nAction’s affiliates have more than 147,000 members. CPD Action and its affiliates promote \nthe accuracy of the census by conducting outreach to community members. \n4.  Plaintiff  City  of  Newburgh  (“Newburgh”)  is  a  municipal  corporation \nlocated in the Southern District of New York. Newburgh is home to large Hispanic \nAmerican, African American, and undocumented populations, making it a hard-to-count \ncommunity for the 2020 Census. In 2010, a mere 57 percent of Newburgh’s residents \nresponded to the initial census questionnaire, one of the lowest census-participation rates \nin New York State. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 4 of 35\n \n5.  Defendant the Bureau of the Census (the “Bureau”) is the agency within the \nUnited States Department of Commerce that oversees and implements the decennial \ncensus. The Bureau is headquartered and maintains its principal offices in Suitland, \nMaryland. \n6.  Defendant Steven  Dillingham is the Director of the  Bureau,  which is \ncharged with completing the decennial census. He is sued in his official capacity. \n7.  Defendant United States Department of Commerce is a cabinet agency \nwithin the executive branch of the United States Government, and is responsible for \nplanning, designing, and implementing the 2020 Census. \n8.  Defendant Secretary Wilbur Ross, as Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nCommerce,  oversees  all  operations  of  the  Department  of  Commerce,  including  the \noperations of the Bureau. He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n9.  Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution requires the federal government to \nconduct an “actual Enumeration” of every resident of the United States every ten years.   \n10.  In carrying out that obligation, Congress has traditionally played an active \nrole in supervising the Bureau’s conduct of the census by, among other things, issuing \ndirectives pursuant to the Census Act and enacting related appropriations legislation.  \n11.  The federal government uses census data to allocate hundreds of billions of \ndollars in public funding. These funds considerably impact state and local governments’ \nand other public entities’ ability to provide high quality education, health care, housing, \ntransportation, and other vital services. \n  4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 5 of 35\n \n12.  Census data is also used for seat apportionment in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, drawing boundaries for congressional districts and many state legislative \ndistricts, and voting rights enforcement.  \n13.  New York uses census data for purposes of state legislative districting. \nNewburgh uses census data for purposes of ward boundary districting. \nHistory and Background of the Census \n14.  Since  1790,  the  government  has  conducted  a  decennial  census  in \naccordance  with  the  Constitution.  The  drafters  of  the  Constitution  “knew  that  the \ncalculation of populations could be and often were skewed for political or financial \npurposes,” Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 500 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and \ndissenting in part), and therefore sought to insulate the count from politics.   \n15.  In 1954, Congress passed the Census Act which consolidated all census-\nrelated statutes in Title 13. While Congress has delegated responsibilities to the Bureau, it \nhas also explicitly retained power and circumscribed the Bureau’s discretion in key areas. \nWith this balance in mind, courts have historically adjudicated lawsuits challenging census \noperations under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)—which ensures proper balance \nbetween the executive and legislative branches—and the Constitution. \n16.  Beyond the authorizing statute, Congress continues to speak through its \nappropriations statutes and accompanying committee and conference reports, which often \ncontain directives to the agency.  \n17.  For example, for at least the last three decades, Congress has tasked the \nBureau with reducing the differential undercount for “individuals who have historically \nbeen undercounted.” Dep’ts of Commerce, Justice, & State, the Judiciary, & Related \n  5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 6 of 35\n \nAgencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No, 105-119, § 209(a)(9), 111 Stat. 2440, 2481 \n(1997). The Bureau has thus historically spent congressionally allocated funds to reach \nhard-to-count communities. \nRecent Efforts to Promote an Accurate Census \n18.  The Bureau has identified what it terms “hard-to-count” populations. These \ninclude racial and ethnic minorities, English-language learners, lower income people, the \nhomeless,  undocumented  immigrants,  young  and  mobile  people,  children,  LGBTQ \nindividuals, and “persons who are angry at and/or distrust the government.” \n19.  In 2010, substantial expenditures led to the most accurate census in decades \nin terms of the overall population, with a net overcount of 0.01 percent, as compared to an \novercount of 0.49 percent in 2000 and undercount of 1.61 percent in 1990, according to an \nofficial government post-census survey.  \n20.  However,  for  hard-to-count  communities,  the  2010  Census  had  a  net \nundercount of 1.5 percent of Hispanic Americans and 2.1 percent of African Americans, \naccording to an official government post-census study. \n21.  The  2010  Census  failed  to  count  an  estimated  1.5  million  black  and \nHispanic residents, which would be enough people to fill two Congressional districts. \n22.  The census has also undercounted other populations. In 2010, for example, \nhome renters were undercounted by 1.1 percent and children under the age of five were \nundercounted by 4.6 percent.  \n23.  By contrast, in 2010, the net overcount was 0.6 percent for homeowners and \n0.8 percent for non-Hispanic whites. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 7 of 35\n \n24.  The inequality in net undercounts across different subpopulations of the \nUnited  States,  known  as  the  “differential  undercount,”  inevitably  has  enormous \nconsequences for the distribution of political power and economic resources.  \n25.  In order to ameliorate differential undercounts, in 2010 and earlier censuses \nthe Bureau focused resources on programs designed to reach hard-to-count communities. \nThese key programs include advertising, communications, and partnership campaigns \ndirected at traditionally undercounted populations; questionnaire assistance operations; and \nlarge staffs of enumerators who knock on doors to conduct Nonresponse Follow-up \noperations. These efforts have not eliminated differential undercounts entirely, but they \nhave reduced them, preventing even more dramatic losses of political representation and \nfunding to hard-to-count communities.  \nImminent Risk of a Constitutionally and Statutorily Deficient 2020 Census \n26.  Defendants’ preparations for the 2020 Census are so deficient as to raise \nimminent concerns of an undercount that is both substantially greater than in past years \nand entirely foreseeable, particularly affecting hard-to-count populations. \n27.  The deficiencies in the 2020 Census preparations are not simply the result \nof  a  choice  of  methodology.  Rather,  they  are  a  result  of  arbitrary,  capricious,  and \nunreasoned agency decisions that are all the more dangerous because of their dependence \non new and untested technology.  \n28.  Throughout the lead up to 2020, Defendants failed to establish the typical \npace of funding, staffing, and preparation at this stage of a census cycle. Moreover, \nDefendants have decided to make a number of dramatic technological changes for the 2020 \n  7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 8 of 35\n \nCensus, including relying on a largely-untested online response system. These sweeping \nchanges have not been accompanied by sufficient testing. \n29.  Defendants cancelled crucial field tests of census operating procedures in \nboth 2017 and 2018. In 2017, they cancelled field tests in Puerto Rico, North Dakota, South \nDakota, and Washington State. Defendants also cancelled two of three sites for the 2018 \nEnd-to-End Census Test, dress rehearsals that serve as the basis for many final decisions \nabout decennial census methods and operations. Additionally, Defendants truncated the \none remaining 2018 End-to-End testing site, removing advertising and partnerships, as well \nas the coverage measurement operation that helps measure how many residents are missed. \n30.  Earlier this year, the Bureau moved from the planning stage of the 2020 \nCensus to the operational stage. This transition was marked by the Bureau’s publication of \nthe final version of the 2020 Census Operational Plan on February 1, 2019. \n31.  The Final Operational Plan, by its own description, “documents the design \nfor conducting the 2020 Census” and “describ[es] design concepts and their rationale.” \n32.  The Bureau has explained that the Final Operational Plan “reflects [the] \nfinal design” for the 2020 Census. \n33.  The  2020  Census  is  at  imminent  risk  of  severely  and  differentially \nundercounting people of color. This risk is caused by the Bureau’s refusal to expend \nappropriated funds and by unlawful agency decisions set forth in the Final Operational \nPlan. \n34.  Given the size and scope of the decennial census, immediate relief is \nnecessary to ensure that Defendants have ample opportunity to implement the changes \nrequired to ensure a constitutionally sufficient census.   \n  8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 9 of 35\n \nIrrational Design Choices in Final Operational Plan \n35.  The Bureau’s Final Operational Plan includes serious design defects that \nwill produce a more dramatic undercount of hard-to-count populations than in previous \ncensuses.  This  egregious  differential  undercount  could  be  readily  avoided  absent \nDefendants’ arbitrary and irrational design choices. \n36.  These arbitrary and irrational design choices include a (a) plan to hire an \nunreasonably small number of enumerators; (b) drastic reduction in the number of Bureau \nfield offices; (c) significant reduction in the Bureau’s communications and partnership \nprogram, including the elimination of local, physical Questionnaire Assistance Centers; (d) \ndecision to replace most In-Field Address Canvassing with In-Office Address Canvassing; \nand (e) decision to make only limited efforts to count inhabitants of units that appear vacant \nor nonexistent based on unreliable administrative records. \n37.  Individually  and  collectively,  these  five  decisions  demonstrate  an \nabandonment of the Bureau’s congressionally designated goal of reaching hard-to-count \ncommunities in the 2020 Census. \nInsufficient Hiring of Enumerators \n38.  In every modern decennial census, one of the most important operations is \nNon-Response Follow-up (“NRFU”), the Bureau’s process of attempting to count those \nwho do not self-respond to the census. NRFU is conducted principally by field workers \ncalled enumerators, who physically visit housing units from which no self-response was \nreceived. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 10 of 35\n \n39.  Because hard-to-count populations historically self-respond at much lower \nrates than the general population, an adequate number of enumerators is essential for \nreducing the differential undercount. \n40.  The Final Operational Plan announced a decision to hire drastically fewer \nenumerators than the Bureau hired for the 2010 Census. \n41.  In fact, the Bureau has made a final decision to hire more than two hundred \nthousand fewer enumerators than it hired for the 2010 Census. This will reduce the number \nof enumerators by one-third compared to 2010, even though the total U.S. population has \ngrown by nearly 6 percent since 2010.  \n42.  Of this drastically reduced number of enumerators, the Bureau plans to \nactually deploy in the field an even smaller number, relying only on approximately 250,000 \n“core enumerators.”  \n43.  In deciding to hire a drastically reduced number of enumerators for the 2020 \nCensus, Defendants failed to consider how this decision would impact the differential \nundercount and failed to rationally analyze evidence about how this decision would affect \nthe absolute undercount. \n44.  The decision to hire a drastically reduced number of enumerators will \nexacerbate both the absolute undercount and the differential undercount of Plaintiffs, their \nmembers and residents, and communities geographically close to Plaintiffs. \n45.  The  Bureau  states  in  the  Final  Operational  Plan  that  it  needs  fewer \nenumerators for the 2020 Census than it did for the 2010 Census because each enumerator \nwill be, on average, more productive than in 2010, and the NRFU workload will be reduced \nto a level that the Bureau’s reduced staff of enumerators can handle.  \n  10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 11 of 35\n \n46.  Neither of these premises is rationally justified in the Final Operational \nPlan, and both are unreasonable.  \n47.  The Bureau claims that the average productivity per enumerator will be \nunprecedentedly high in 2020 because the Bureau will use new technology and new \nprotocols. The Bureau’s prediction about enumerator productivity in the 2020 Census \ncannot be verified because its new technology and protocols have been only partially tested \nin a single dress rehearsal. This dress rehearsal was conducted at a single site, Providence, \nRhode Island, which is not representative of the many different types of communities the \ncensus must count and not a reliable proxy for the nation as a whole.  \n48.  Furthermore, the results of the dress rehearsal had a self-response rate of \njust 52.3%, far lower than the 60.5% currently assumed by the Bureau. \n49.  Even if enumerators in the 2020 Census complete as many cases per hour \nas the Bureau reports that enumerators did in the 2018 End-to-End Test, there will be far \ntoo few enumerators to conduct an actual enumeration in the 2020 Census.  \n50.  The Bureau’s stated beliefs about the size of the NRFU workload are also \nirrational and fail to account for factors that will increase the size of the NRFU workload. \n51.  Specifically, the Bureau (a) fails to account for the Bureau’s own recent \nresearch findings that show there will be a low self-response rate; (b) irrationally assumes \nthat soliciting online census responses will increase, rather than decrease, the self-response \nrate; and (c) assumes without evidence that the Bureau will be able reduce the NRFU \nworkload significantly by enumerating households based on administrative records. \n \n \n  11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 12 of 35\n \nThe Bureau’s Research Contradicts Its Assumptions About NRFU Workload \n52.  On January 24, 2019, the Bureau published the 2020 Census Barriers, \nAttitudes and Motivators Study Survey Report (“2020 CBAMS Survey Report”) and the \n2020 Census Barriers, Attitudes and Motivators Study Focus Group Final Report (“2020 \nCBAMS Focus Group Final Report”). The two documents together record the results of \nthe 2020 Census Barriers, Attitudes and Motivators Study (“2020 CBAMS”). \n53.  According  to  the  2020  CBAMS  Survey  Report,  only  67  percent  of \nhouseholders who participated in the 2020 CBAMS Survey  reported that they  were \n“extremely likely” or “very likely” to fill out a census form. This is an exceptionally low \npercentage and twenty percentage points lower than in 2010.  \n54.  The actual self-response rate in the 2020 Census will be lower than 67 \npercent because, as the 2020 CBAMS Survey Report points out, “past research suggests \nthat even individuals who report a commitment to participate may not follow through on \ntheir intention.”  \n55.  In the 2010 Census, 86 percent of 2010 CBAMS participants said they \nwould “definitely” or “probably” respond to the 2010 Census, and the actual self-response \nrate was 76 percent. \n56.  The 2020 CBAMS Survey Report also shows that the self-response rate will \nbe significantly lower for households of color than for white households. \n57.  In making a final decision to hire significantly fewer enumerators for the \n2020 Census, the Bureau has failed to account for and draw rational conclusions from the \nresults of the 2020 CBAMS. \n \n \n  12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 13 of 35\n \nReliance on Internet Self-Response Cannot Justify Reduced Enumerator Hiring \n \n58.  The 2020 Census will be the first to attempt to collect a large proportion of \ncensus responses online. The introduction of Internet Self-Response (ISR) is a radical \ndeparture from the paper and in-person methods used in all previous censuses. \n59.  The 2010 Census delivered approximately 360 million paper questionnaires \nto 133 million housing units.  \n60.  This cycle, Defendants intend to encourage self-response primarily by \ninternet and to reduce the number of in-person visits to households that do not self-respond. \n61.  In 2020, Defendants will divide the United States population into cohorts. \n62.   Defendants will mail census questionnaires initially to only 20 percent of \nthose cohorts.  \n63.  Defendants will mail the remaining 80 percent of cohorts, comprising the \nmajority  of  all  housing  units,  a  notification  inviting  them  to  complete  the  census \nquestionnaire online. If these cohorts do not complete the questionnaire online or by \ntelephone, Defendants plan to mail a paper version. \n64.  The Bureau concluded in the Final Operational Plan that the introduction of \nISR will cause an increase in the overall self-response rate, including a “[p]otential increase \nin self-response from traditional hard-to-count populations.” \n65.  The Bureau aims to achieve this increase in self-response by persuading 45 \npercent of households to self-respond through ISR in the 2020 Census. \n66.  The Bureau’s aspirational 45 percent ISR rate is arbitrary and capricious \nand not supported by substantial evidence. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 14 of 35\n \n67.  In the End-to-End Census Test in 2018, only 32.6 percent of households \nself-responded through ISR.  \n68.  The response rate will be even lower among hard-to-count populations, who \nare by definition the populations least likely to self-respond in the first place and may have \nreduced access to or trust in internet-based systems.   \n69.  The “digital divide” in the United States is stark. Only half of households \nearning incomes less than $30,000 per year have access to broadband internet. In more than \nhalf of the city’s census tracts, approximately forty percent of residents had either no \ninternet at home or only dial-up between 2013 to 2017. \n70.  In addition, many rural residents have significantly reduced access to the \ninternet.  \n71.  Communities  of  color,  including  African  Americans  and  Hispanic \nAmericans, are less likely to have access to internet than their white counterparts. \n72.  The introduction of ISR will cause a significant number of households not \nto self-respond to the 2020 Census because of public concern about the Bureau’s ability to \nprotect census responses from data breaches. \n73.  The Bureau has not explained in detail how it will protect the personal \ninformation of hundreds of millions of Americans and respond to the cybersecurity \nconcerns ISR presents. \n74.  Even  if  the  Bureau  is  actually  able  to  protect  data  about  responding \nhouseholds, perceived data insecurity will dissuade responses, especially in light of recent \nhigh-profile  and  large-scale  data  breaches  including  of  the  Office  of  Personnel \nManagement in 2015 and for clients of Equifax, Yahoo!, and Uber, among others.  \n  14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 15 of 35\n \n75.  Moreover,  the  Bureau’s  cancellation  of  planned  tests  deprives  it  of \ncomprehensive opportunities to test critical cybersecurity infrastructure. The absence of \nadequate testing of the Bureau’s cybersecurity infrastructure will contribute to the public’s \nfear of responding to the census online. \n76.  Contrary to the Bureau’s conclusion that ISR will cause a net increase in \nthe overall self-response rate, ISR creates an imminent risk of a net decrease in the overall \nself-response rate, which will likely be more pronounced among communities of color. \nThis will lead to a larger NRFU workload and a corresponding need for more enumerators.  \n77.  In formulating its final decision to hire a significantly reduced staff of \nenumerators for the 2020 Census, the Bureau failed to account for and draw rational \nconclusions from evidence that ISR will deter self-response and fail to elicit responses from \nhard-to-count populations, and data showing that ISR rates in tests have fallen far short of \nthe Bureau’s aspirational ISR rate. \nAdministrative Record Use Cannot Justify Reduced Enumerator Hiring  \n \n78.  Another premise underlying the Bureau’s decision to hire a significantly \nreduced staff of enumerators is the Bureau’s prediction that it will be able to enumerate a \nsignificant number of households based on federal administrative records. \n79.  Under the Final Operational Plan, the Bureau will attempt to use federal \nadministrative records to enumerate any nonresponding household that has not been \nenumerated after a single NRFU visit, although nonresponding households will also \nreceive a postcard asking them to self-respond.  \n  15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 16 of 35\n \n80.  The Final Operational Plan states that a nonresponding household will be \nenumerated through administrative records if and only if “the Census Bureau has high-\nquality administrative records from trusted sources” on that household.  \n81.  The Final Operational Plan lists three “[e]xamples” of trusted sources of \nadministrative records: Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Individual Tax Returns, IRS \nInformation Returns, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Statistics Medicare \nEnrollment Database. \n82.  The  Bureau  has  not  sufficiently  tested  its  current  plan  to  enumerate \nhouseholds based on federal administrative records and therefore lacks evidence that this \nmethod will substantially reduce the NRFU workload. \n83.  Administrative-record-based enumerations will not, in fact, substantially \nreduce the NRFU workload. \n84.   Hard-to-count populations, who will make up a disproportionately large \npart of the NRFU workload in the 2020 Census, are underrepresented in sources of federal \nadministrative data like IRS Individual Tax Returns, IRS Information Returns, and the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Statistics Medicare Enrollment Database. \n85.  In finally determining to hire a significantly reduced staff of enumerators, \nthe Bureau unreasonably relied on its untested and implausible theory that administrative-\nrecord-based enumerations will substantially reduce the NRFU workload. \nInsufficient Network of Area Census Offices \n86.  For each decennial census, the Bureau opens temporary field offices around \nthe country. The Bureau opened 494 local census offices and one area office for the 2010 \nCensus. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 17 of 35\n \n87.  Under the Final Operational Plan, the Bureau plans to replace those 495 \noffices with just 248 area census offices (“ACOs”) for the 2020 Census.  \n88.  Despite its status as one of the hardest to count localities in the state, the \nCity of Newburgh does not have an ACO for the 2020 Census. \n89.  In deciding to drastically reduce the number of field offices, Defendants \nfailed to consider how this decision would affect the differential undercount and failed to \nrationally analyze evidence about how this decision would affect the absolute undercount.  \n90.  The final decision to drastically reduce number of field offices will worsen \nboth the absolute undercount and the differential undercount of Plaintiffs, their members \nand residents, and communities geographically close to Plaintiffs.  \n91.   Opening a sufficient number of ACOs is essential for an accurate 2020 \nCensus because the ACOs will play critical roles in recruiting, hiring, training, and \nsupervising field staff for address canvassing and NRFU. \n92.  If the Bureau has too few ACOs, it will not be able to hire and train a staff \nof enumerators capable of conducting an actual enumeration of households that do not self-\nrespond to the 2020 Census, nor will it be able to hire and train a staff of listers capable of \nperforming address canvassing accurately. As a result, households—disproportionately \nfrom the hard-to-count populations that are overrepresented in the NRFU workload—will \ngo uncounted. \n93.  Having too few ACOs will also constrain the Bureau’s ability to identify \nand address any problems that arise during address canvassing and NRFU. It is especially \nimportant for the Bureau to have this ability during the 2020 Census because the Bureau is \nimplementing many new methods and technologies that have not been adequately tested.    \n  17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 18 of 35\n \n94.  The number of ACOs that the Bureau has decided to open for the 2020 \nCensus is insufficient and not rationally explained by the Bureau’s stated rationale. \n95.  The Bureau has stated that its final decision on the number of ACOs to open \nfor the 2020 Census is based on the number of enumerators needed for field operations. \n96.  However, the anticipated number of enumerators cannot be the basis for the \nnumber of ACOs the Bureau has decided to open, because the Bureau has substantially \nrevised its projected number of enumerators without making a corresponding change to the \nplanned number of ACOs. \n97.  The Bureau initially planned to open 248 ACOs based on a then-current \nestimate that the 2020 Census would need 173,021 “core enumerators.” The Bureau \nassumed that each ACO would have 49 field supervisors, each overseeing 15 enumerators, \nfor a total of 735 enumerators per ACO. \n98.  In 2017, the Bureau increased the projected number of core enumerators to \n256,336. To maintain its enumerator-to-ACO ratio, the Bureau would need 349 ACOs. \n99.  Instead of adding ACOs, however, the Bureau has made a final decision to \nopen 248 ACOs, resulting in a much higher enumerator-to-ACO ratio than planned. \n100.  In a report released in April 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce Office \nof Inspector General stated that it “found no evidence that the Bureau reconciled the \nincreased NRFU workload and associated increase in the number of enumerators with” the \nassumptions underlying the original plan to open 248 ACOs. \n101.  To the extent that the Bureau now claims to have a reasoned basis for its \nnew enumerator-to-ACO ratio, that rationale has been reverse-engineered and does not \nrepresent the Bureau’s real reasons for failing to open more than 248 ACOs. \n  18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 19 of 35\n \nInsufficient Communications and Partnership Program Staffing \n102.  Hiring partnership staff is a crucial component of the modern decennial \ncensus. Partnership staff work with local organizations and conduct targeted community \noutreach to encourage hard-to-count populations to complete the census.  \n103.  Despite the importance of the partnership program for reaching hard-to-\ncount populations, the growth in population since 2010, heightened distrust of government, \nand other increased challenges for reaching these populations for the 2020 Census, the \nBureau has decided to decrease its partnership program from 2010 to 2020. \n104.  According to Bureau planning documents, the Bureau will hire twice as \nmany partnership specialists for the 2020 Census (1,501) as it did for the 2010 Census \n(849). But this figure is misleading because it omits other key outreach staff. For the 2010 \nCensus, for example, the Bureau hired 2,000 partnership assistants to assist the specialists; \nfor the 2020 Census, the Bureau will hire none (0).  \n105.  In the lead up to 2020, the Bureau has struggled to hire and retain even its \nreduced number of planned partnership staff due to underfunding and a tighter labor market \nthan existed prior to the 2010 Census. \n106.  The decreased prioritization of partnership staff is especially irrational \ngiven the low self-response rates found in the 2020 CBAMS Report. That Report also \nfound that many people were unfamiliar with the census, that there was persistent lack of \nknowledge about the census’s purpose and process, and that knowledge about the census \nwas spread unevenly across demographic groups. \n107.  The communications program will be less effective than in 2010, for three \nreasons.  First, given the significant cut to the partnership program, more spending is \n  19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 20 of 35\n \nrequired to inform hard-to-count communities about the Census just to match 2010 levels \nof awareness.  Second, given the current climate of distrust of government, hard-to-count \ncommunities will be even more skeptical and hesitant to respond than in previous censuses \nand will require increased communications to assuage their concerns. Third, given that \n2020 is a presidential election year, advertising will cost more as campaigns compete with \nthe Bureau and for-profit advertisers for advertising space \n108.  The Bureau’s 2020 Census Detailed Operational Plan for NRFU identifies \n“Factors that Could Increase the NRFU Workload in the 2020 Census” and explains that \n“[w]hile  concerted  efforts  are  being  taken  to  reduce  the  cost  of  NRFU  and  overall \nworkload, several factors cannot be controlled.” The first factor the Bureau lists is “[l]ow \nself-response rates.” This is an inaccurate and irrational assessment. The Bureau can \ninfluence  and  control  the  likelihood  of  low  self-response  rates  by  increasing \ncommunications and partnership activities. \n109.  Given the enormous barriers to census participation among hard-to-count \ncommunities  this  cycle,  the  Bureau’s  decision  to  reduce  its  partnership  staffing  is \nunreasonable and will contribute to a severe and differential undercount. \n110.  In  deciding  to  reduce  overall  staffing  of  the  partnership  program, \nDefendants failed to consider the consequences for a differential undercount and rationally \nto analyze evidence about how this decision would affect the absolute undercount. \n111.  The decision to reduce overall staffing of the partnership program will \nworsen both the absolute undercount and the differential undercount of Plaintiffs, their \nmembers and residents, and communities geographically close to Plaintiffs.   \n \n  20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 21 of 35\n \nElimination of Local Questionnaire Assistance Centers \n112.  During the 2010 Census, the Bureau addressed the problem of individuals \nwho did not receive or complete a questionnaire in the mail or receive an in-person \ninterview, by establishing 29,157 staffed Questionnaire Assistance Centers (“QACs”) and \n9,670 unstaffed Be Counted (“BC”) sites.  \n113.  760,748 people were counted in 2010 through the QACs and BCs. Of those \nwho visited a stateside QAC, over 38 percent said they had not received a questionnaire in \nthe mail, suggesting that their housing units were not included in the Bureau’s Master \nAddress File (MAF). \n114.  The Bureau has nevertheless eliminated these nearly 40,000 sites and plans \nto replace them with mobile questionnaire assistance, which are mobile response units \nstaffed with Census Bureau employees to assist respondents in filling out the forms online. \nIn 2010, 65 percent of people who used a QAC reported that they learned of the QAC by \nseeing it in person. It is therefore unreasonable to expect that people left out of the MAF \nwill use a mobile-based system. \n115.  These decisions will further exacerbate  and compound the differential \nundercount during the Census. They will particularly harm communities — such as those \nliving in atypical housing units — that are likely to be left out of the MAF.  Indeed, the \nU.S.  House  of  Representatives  Committee  on Oversight  and  Reform  questioned  the \ndecision to cut QACs despite having over a billion dollars of unspent funds is unreasonable. \n116.  The refusal to establish QACs will have a direct effect on Plaintiffs and their \ncommunities. Plaintiff Newburgh does not have a local QAC for the 2020 Census, despite \nSenator Charles Schumer, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Representative Sean Maloney \n  21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 22 of 35\n \nurging  the  Bureau  to  establish  a  QAC  in  Newburgh  using  a  small  portion  of  the \nappropriated funds which the Bureau has refused to spend. \nElimination of Most In-Field Address Canvassing \n117.  Address canvassing operations allow the Bureau to establish the universe of \nhousing units to be counted. A comprehensive and correct address list is necessary to \nensure the inclusion of all housing units for mailings and enumerator visits.  \n118.  The Bureau keeps a database of housing units in the Master Address \nFile/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (“MAF/TIGER”) \nSystem. \n119.  In past censuses, temporary Bureau employees called “listers”  walked \nnearly every block and identified each living quarters’ status before making address \nchanges in the MAF.  \n120.  In the lead-up to 2020, the Bureau has departed from this past practice to \nsave costs. Instead, it decided to conduct a majority of address canvassing solely in-office. \nThis process began in September 2015 and will be completed in 2020.  \n121.  The In-Office Address Canvassing process includes multiple components. \nFirst, the Bureau updates and validates its existing address list using external information \nsources. Bureau employees also review satellite imagery of blocks to see whether the \nnumber of living quarters is likely to deviate from its address lists. Blocks where deviations \nare likely are marked for In-Field Address Canvassing operations.  \n122.  The Bureau planned to conduct an in-office follow-up process called Active \nBlock Resolution (“ABR”) to review and update blocks previously identified as having a \nchanged number of addresses based on imagery review and comparison with the MAF.  \n  22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 23 of 35\n \n123.  The Bureau suspended this program in 2017. The MAF Coverage Study, \nwhich was intended to assess In-Office Address Canvassing and provide continuous \nupdates, was also paused in 2017 purportedly due to funding considerations.  \n124.  The Bureau initially claimed that In-Office Address Canvassing would \nreduce the share of In-Field Address Canvassing to 25 percent. However, the Final \nOperational Plan now states that the Bureau will use In-Field Address Canvassing for 38 \npercent of addresses.  \n125.  In deciding to conduct the majority of canvassing with In-Office Address \nCanvassing, rather than In-Field Address Canvassing, Defendants failed to consider how \nthis decision would affect the differential undercount, and failed to rationally analyze \nevidence about how this decision would affect the absolute undercount. \n126.  The decision to conduct the majority of canvassing with In-Office Address \nCanvassing, rather than  In-Field Address Canvassing, will worsen both the absolute \nundercount and the differential undercount of Plaintiffs, their members and residents, and \ncommunities geographically close to Plaintiffs.   \n127.  The Bureau knew or should have known that heavy reliance on In-Office \nAddress Canvassing would undermine the accuracy of the address list for the 2020 Census \nand increase burdens for In-Field Address Canvassers.  \n128.  The Office of Inspector General’s audit of the 2018 End-to-End Test in \nProvidence, Rhode Island found that “[i]n-office address canvassing did not correctly \nidentify blocks for in-field address canvassing.” The audit found that in 61 percent of the \n433 passive blocks in the 2018 End-to-End Test, in-field and in-office results differed. \nWithin those blocks, 1,287 housing units were deleted in-field and 1,087 were added.   \n  23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 24 of 35\n \n129.  Two  previous  tests  of  In-Office  Address  Canvassing  results  also \ndemonstrated higher error rates than anticipated. However, the Bureau has not determined \nwhy such errors occurred.  \n130.  Even  the  Operational  Plan  acknowledges  “that  some  higher  levels  of \ngovernment” may “believe an In-Field ADC may yield a greater ‘quality’ canvassing than \nIn-Office ADC.”  \n131.  The Bureau has not sufficiently analyzed or sought to correct the source of \nin-office  categorization  errors,  and  no  additional  analysis  is  planned.  Further,  the \nsuspension of ABR and the MAF Coverage Study has limited opportunities to assess and \nimprove the quality of In-Office Address Canvassing.  \n132.  The Bureau’s disregard for the risk that In-Office Address Canvassing will \nharm address list quality means that households will be improperly excluded from the \naddress universe of the 2020 Census and go uncounted. The Bureau has also not adequately \nanalyzed or addressed the impact of miscategorization at the in-office level on different \ndemographic groups.  \nUse of Unreliable Data to Deprive Households of Full NRFU Efforts \n133.  To scale back its NRFU workload, the Bureau has decided to supplant in-\nperson contacts to certain housing units with the use of administrative records.  \n134.  Based  primarily  on  United  States  Postal  Service  Undeliverable-As-\nAddressed (“UAA”) information, the Bureau will identify vacant and nonexistent housing \nunits among those which do not initially self-respond to the census questionnaire.  Those \nhouseholds will be exempt from the full NRFU protocol in favor of a single field visit to \ndetermine whether the address is actually occupied.  \n  24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 25 of 35\n \n135.  Addresses deemed unoccupied on the basis of that single NRFU contact will \nnot be contacted subsequently. \n136.  Addresses  will  be  deemed  unoccupied  where  the  contact  attempt  is \nunsuccessful and both UAA information and other federal administrative records indicate \nthat the address is vacant or nonexistent.  \n137.  The  Final  Operational  Plan  provides  no  adequate  rationale  as  to  the \nsufficiency of this method. \n138.  Moreover,  those  addresses  believed  to  be  occupied  upon  the  first \nunsuccessful contact will nonetheless be counted via federal administrative records, if \navailable, and no further contacts will be attempted. \n139.  The Bureau knew or should have known that the UAA information is a \nhighly inaccurate predictor of vacant and nonexistent housing units.  \n140.  The Bureau’s own field testing indicated that 18 percent of housing units \nidentified  as  vacant  by  administrative  records  and  30  percent  of  those  identified  as \nnonexistent were in fact occupied. The Bureau has failed to consider other, more effective \noptions for addressing the problems identified through testing. \n141.  The Bureau cannot show a rational connection between the introduction of \nadministrative-record-based enumeration and the purported reduced need for enumerators \nand NRFU contacts. \n142.  In deciding to use administrative records to reduce the maximum number \nof NRFU contacts for certain housing units, Defendants failed to consider how this decision \nwould affect the differential undercount, and failed to rationally analyze evidence about \nhow this decision would affect the absolute undercount. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 26 of 35\n \n143.  The final decision to use administrative records to reduce the maximum \nnumber  of  NRFU  contacts  for  certain  housing  units  will  worsen  both  the  absolute \nundercount and the differential undercount of Plaintiffs, their members and residents, and \ncommunities geographically close to Plaintiffs.   \n144.  Because removing a housing unit from the NRFU universe is tantamount to \ngiving up on counting the people who live there, the Bureau’s insistence on excluding \nhousing units from NRFU based on administrative data that it has discovered are largely \ninaccurate is arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. \nCurrent Unspent Funds That Would Help Mitigate Undercount \n145.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 appropriated $3.55 billion to \nthe Bureau for Fiscal Year 2019. \n146.  The Conference Report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct of 2019 reads, in relevant part: “The agreement reiterates House and Senate language \nregarding the Bureau’s partnership and communications efforts aimed at maximizing self-\nresponse to the 2020 Decennial Census. Additionally, the Bureau shall devote funding to \nexpand targeted communications activities as well as to open local questionnaire assistance \ncenters in hard-to-count communities.”  \n147.  The Conference Report also explains that the cost estimate for the “2020 \nDecennial Census . . . assumes the need for additional in-person follow-up visits due to \nfewer households expected to initially respond to the Census.” \n148.  The House Report accompanying the Commerce, Justice, Science, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2019 reads, in relevant part: “The Census Bureau is \ndirected to ensure that its fiscal year 2019 partnership and communications activities in \n  26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 27 of 35\n \nsupport of the 2020 Census are conducted at a level of effort no less than that conducted \nduring fiscal year 2009 in preparation for the 2010 Decennial Census.”  \n149.  The  Senate  Report  accompanying  the  Departments  of  Commerce  and \nJustice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2019 reads, in relevant part: \n“The  Committee  is  concerned  about  the  proposed  levels  for  partnership  staff  and \ncommunications efforts for the 2020 Decennial Census . . . . Additionally, the Committee \nunderstands that the 2020 Decennial Census plan includes only about half the number of \nlocal field offices and Regional Census Centers compared to the 2010 Decennial Census. \nTherefore, the Committee expects the Bureau to provide a plan that increases the number \nof partnership program staff, communication efforts, and field operations; an assessment \nof increasing external partnerships; and the associated costs, within 45 days of enactment. \nThe plan should include an assessment of doubling the number of partnership staff and \nincreasing the number of area census offices to 300.” \n150.  Fiscal Year 2019 ended on September 30, 2019. The Bureau currently has \nover $1 billion unspent from its FY 2018 and FY2019 appropriations. \n151.  The Bureau’s unspent funds it is holding in reserve would, if used as \ndirected, ameliorate the effects of its drastic cuts in resources for the 2020 Census.  \nThe Impact of Defendants’ Decisions on Plaintiffs \n152.  Plaintiff Newburgh has large Hispanic-American, African-American, and \nundocumented populations. Defendants consider Newburgh a hard-to-count community \nfor the 2020 Census, just as they did in the 2010 Census. Of Newburgh’s six census tracts, \ntwo tracts returned just over half of the mailed questionnaires in the 2010 Census, and one \ntract returned only 63.8 percent. \n  27 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 28 of 35\n \n153.  Forty percent of residents in half of the census tracts in Newburgh had either \nno home internet subscription or dial-up only from 2013 to 2017. The Bureau’s reliance on \nan untested digital census for 2020 will disproportionately undercount these already hard-\nto-count individuals.  \n154.  The  Bureau  has  cut  funding  and  scaled  back  programs  for  in-person \nenumerators and NRFU operations. \n155.  Plaintiff Newburgh’s census data will be used to determine congressional \nrepresentation and districting, as well as where to build new schools, businesses, and \nhospitals. The data will also be used to determine federal funding for vital resources, \nincluding transportation, housing, and social services. \n156.  Newburgh’s  residents  face  actual  and  imminent  injuries  based  on \nDefendants’  refusal  to  expend  funds  on  key  programs  that  reach  hard-to-count \ncommunities. \n157.  Newburgh’s  residents  face  impending  and  imminent  political \nunderrepresentation and loss of federal funding. \n158.  Newburgh has had to divert resources away from other pressing concerns \nin order to address Defendants’ shortcomings. Newburgh’s Complete Count Committee \nhas expended time and resources in conducting community outreach and organizing hiring \nfairs, and the City Council has spent time on promotional and communication efforts to get \nout the count for the 2020 Census. \n159.  Plaintiff  CPD  Action  is  a  political  advocacy  organization  focused  on \npromoting “equity, opportunity, and a dynamic democracy in partnership with high-impact \n  28 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 29 of 35\n \nbase-building organizations, organizing alliances, and progressive unions.” It has member \nand partner organizations in multiple states.  \n160.  Members of CPD Action reside in communities of color around the country, \nbut the residences of its members are not equally distributed geographically.  \n161.  The Bureau’s own reports have shown that Hispanic and African Americans \nare concentrated in a relatively small number of states. For example, seventy-five percent \nof the Hispanic-American population lives in just eight states, including New York. Sixty \npercent of the African-American population resides in just ten states, including New York.  \n162.  The loss of a congressional seat in one of those states due to undercounting \nof hard-to-count populations will result in a net underrepresentation nationwide. \n163.  Similarly, the uneven distribution of Hispanic and African Americans is \nobservable at the local level. 2010 Census data indicated, for example, that more than 25 \npercent of the Hispanic-American population resided in just eight counties nationwide.  \n164.  African-American populations tend to be concentrated in counties within \nmetropolitan areas. Over 60 percent of counties nationwide have an African-American \npopulation of less than 5 percent, while counties outside Southern states with African-\nAmerican populations between 25 percent and 49.9 percent were overwhelmingly located \nin metropolitan areas.  \n165.  Brooklyn, where CPD Action and four of its New York-based partners are \nheadquartered, is the hardest-to-count area in New York State, with over 80 percent of the \nborough’s residents living in hard-to-count neighborhoods. The borough is home to half of \nthe 500 census tracts in New York State that are most at risk of an undercount.  \n  29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 30 of 35\n \n166.  The differential undercount of Hispanic-American, African-American, and \nimmigrant residents and other hard-to-count populations will injure CPD Action members \nin states, congressional districts, and state legislative districts across the country, by \ndepriving them of federal funding and political power.  \n167.  The injuries to CPD Action members are not remedied by the windfall of \nfederal funding or political power that will accrue to other residents of the United States \nwho unfairly benefit from the differential undercount of Hispanic or African Americans, \neven if some CPD Action members happen to reside in some of the states, congressional \ndistricts, or state legislative districts that unfairly benefit from the differential undercount. \n168.  CPD Action members and the organization itself face actual and imminent \ninjuries based on Defendants’ constitutional violations.  \n169.  CPD Action has had to divert resources from other pressing concerns in \norder to address Defendants’ inadequate preparations for the 2020 Census as part of its \nDemocracy Program.  \n170.  CPD Action has devoted additional staff time to its efforts to encourage \nparticipation in the 2020 Census, has begun providing census-related trainings to its \nmembership units across the country, and has established new census-related partnerships \nwith outside organizations.  \n171.  In  light  of  Defendants’  drastic  reductions  from  previous  cycles  in \npreparation and resources needed to conduct a fair and accurate Census, CPD Action has \ninstituted a more thorough effort to promote awareness of and participation in the 2020 \nCensus and is developing plans to address unprecedented challenges associated with the \n2020 Census due to Defendants’ reduced in-field presence. \n  30 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 31 of 35\n \n172.  Defendants’ choices in procedures, such as their approach to digitization, \nand reductions in field and mailing outreach, have already been made and are being \nimplemented presently, and as a result Plaintiffs are at imminent risk of harm.  \n173.  If this Court does not act promptly to remedy Defendants’ failures, the \ndeficiencies currently present in the 2020 Census will become irremediable, and there will \nbe no amount of funding, hiring, or appropriate planning that can fix the serious existing \ndeficiencies in time for the census. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT 1: ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS AGENCY ACTION  \nAgainst Defendants Bureau of the Census and U.S. Department of Commerce \n174.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 173 of \nthis complaint. \n175.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), prohibits agency \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.”   \n176.  The five decisions set forth in the Final Operational Plan and listed in \nparagraph 36 this Complaint constitute discrete and final agency actions that are arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law.  \n177.  Defendants Bureau of the Census and U.S. Department of Commerce have \nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n178.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by this violation of the Administrative Procedure \nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n \n  31 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 32 of 35\n \nCOUNT 2: UNCONSTITUTIONAL AGENCY ACTION \nAgainst Defendants Bureau of the Census and U.S. Department of Commerce \n179.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 173 of \nthis complaint.  \n180.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B), prohibits agency \naction that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.”  \n181.  The Constitution requires a fair and accurate count of all persons in the \nUnited States. U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 3.  \n182.  The five decisions set forth in the Final Operational Plan and listed in \nparagraph 36 of this Complaint constitute discrete and final agency action that is “contrary \nto constitutional right” because it deprives Plaintiffs of their constitutional right to a fair \nand accurate census in 2020. \n183.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by these violations of the Administrative Procedure \nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n184.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B), authorizes this \ncourt to set aside unlawful action by Defendants Bureau of the Census and U.S. Department \nof Commerce.  \nCOUNT 3: VIOLATION OF ENUMERATION CLAUSE \nAgainst All Defendants \n185.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 173 of \nthis complaint. \n186.  The Constitution requires a fair and accurate count of all persons in the \nUnited States. U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 3.  \n  32 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 33 of 35\n \n187.  The five decisions set forth in the Final Operational Plan and listed in \nparagraph 36 of this Complaint, individually and cumulatively, deprive Plaintiffs of their \nconstitutional right to a fair and accurate census in 2020. \n188.  The refusal to spend any portion of substantial reserve funds bears no \nreasonable relationship to the conduct of a fair and accurate census. \n189.  Defendants have adopted a program for the 2020 Census that is understaffed \nand underfunded and that inadequately addresses the challenge of reaching hard-to-count \npopulations. \n190.  Defendants have violated and are at imminent risk of violating the “actual \nEnumeration” clause of the United States Constitution, Art. I § 2 cl. 3.  \n191.  Defendants’  violation  will  lead  to  an  undercount  of  racial  and  ethnic \nminorities  and  harm  the  Plaintiffs.  This  violation  will  deprive  Plaintiffs  of  their \nconstitutional right to representation and their fair share of resources. \n192.  Defendants’ violation has caused  and will continue to cause ongoing, \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \nREQUESTED RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:  \n193.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \n194.  Hold unlawful and set aside the five agency actions listed in paragraph 36 \nand described in paragraphs 26 through 173 of this Complaint: (a) a plan to hire an \nunreasonably small number of enumerators; (b) a drastic reduction in the number of Bureau \nfield offices; (c) a significant reduction in the staffing and infrastructure of the Bureau’s \ncommunications and partnership program, including the elimination of local, physical \n  33 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 34 of 35\n \nQuestionnaire Assistance Centers; (d) the decision to replace most  In-Field Address \nCanvassing  with  In-Office  Address  Canvassing;  and  (e)  the  decision  to  make  only \nextremely limited efforts to count inhabitants of housing units that appear vacant or \nnonexistent based on unreliable administrative records; \n195.  Declare that the Defendants are in violation of their constitutional duty to \nconduct an accurate actual enumeration of the people;  \n196.  Declare that Defendants have unlawfully withheld and/or unreasonably \ndelayed expending appropriated funds on the 2020 Census; \n197.  Enter an injunction that requires Defendants to implement a plan to ensure \nthat hard-to-count populations will be actually enumerated in the decennial census, which \nshall include but not be limited to a plan that: (a) restores the Bureau’s 2020 Partnership \nProgram to no less than 2010 levels, adjusted for inflation and population growth; (b) \naugments the Bureau’s 2020 Integrated Communications Program to achieve coverage \nequivalent to the 2010 Census, accounting for  inflation, population growth, and the \nincreased  cost  of  advertising  in  2020;  (c)  requires  opening  a  number  of  in-person \nQuestionnaire Assistance Centers commensurate to that used in the 2010 Census; and (d) \nincreases the number of enumerators to no less than 2010 levels, adjusted for population \ngrowth; and   \n   \n  34 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-10917-NRB   Document 1   Filed 11/26/19   Page 35 of 35\n \n198.
