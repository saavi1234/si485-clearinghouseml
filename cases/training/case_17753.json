    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the Trump Administration&rsquo;s refusal to comply with the House Oversight and Reform Committee&rsquo;s subpoenas for documents related to its investigation into the Trump Administration&rsquo;s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. On November 26, 2019, the House Committee filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce, alleging that they unlawfully refused to comply with the Committee&rsquo;s subpoenas. By doing so, they allegedly acted in violation of the Committee&rsquo;s Article I powers. Represented by the U.S. House of Representatives&rsquo; Office of General Counsel, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the defendants to immediately produce the subpoenaed documents. They claimed that these documents &ldquo;go to the heart&rdquo; of its investigation into the proposed census citizenship question and are thus necessary for the Committee to fulfill its oversight and legislative duties regarding the census. The case was assigned to Judge Randolph Daniel Moss.</p>\r\n<p>On December 17, 2019, the plaintiff filed a motion for expedited summary judgment on all counts of the complaint. Five days prior, on December 12, 2019, the defendants had moved to hold the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for a preliminary injunction or expedited summary judgment in abeyance pending the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals&rsquo; decision in <em>Committee on the Judiciary of the United House of Representatives v. McGahn</em> (1:19-cv-02379). Because the <em>McGahn</em> case raised similar issues regarding the court&rsquo;s authority to hear the suit, the defendants argued that this decision would control the present matter and could either eliminate this case or dramatically reduce the number of issues to be resolved. The court denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion on December 13, 2019. Subsequently, on January 14, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.</p>\r\n<p>During this time, the parties continued to negotiate and issued a number of joint status reports about certain documents sought by the House Committee. The plaintiffs claimed that these documents were urgently needed for its investigation and accused the defendants of attempting to run out the clock in order to shield themselves from scrutiny. Meanwhile, the defendants argued that the confidentiality interests implicated by these documents outweighed the interests served by their disclosure.</p>\r\n<p>In the separate <em>McGahn</em> case, the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on February 28, 2020. The <em>Barr</em> defendants argued that this required the dismissal of the present matter. However, on March 16, 2020, the D.C. Circuit vacated the <em>McGahn</em> judgment and granted rehearing en banc. The D.C. Circuit issued another opinion in the <em>McGahn</em> case on August 31, 2020, in which it held that a House committee lacked a cause of action to enforce its subpoena to a former Executive Branch official. As a result of this order, back in the <em>Barr</em> case, the defendants claimed that the D.C. Circuit&rsquo;s August decision in <em>McGahn</em> made clear that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief they sought here. The parties continued to file joint status reports regarding the documents sought.</p>\r\n<p>However, the <em>McGahn</em> plaintiffs petitioned the D.C. Circuit for another rehearing en banc. On October 6, 2020, the <em>Barr</em> court stayed its case pending that decision. Two weeks later, the <em>McGahn</em> court granted another rehearing en banc on October 15, 2020. On the same day, the D.C. District Court ordered that the <em>Barr</em> case would remain stayed pending the D.C. Circuit&rsquo;s merits decision in <em>McGahn</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties continued to submit joint status reports throughout 2021. On August 31, 2021, the parties entered into an Agreement Concerning Accommodation, intended to facilitate the end of litigation. The agreement required defendants to make certain documents pertaining to the 2020 census, which plaintiffs had previously attempted to subpoena in January 2021, available to the plaintiffs for <em>in camera</em> review. After review, the plaintiffs would have 30 days to make additional requests for a limited number of relevant documents, subject to the defendants&rsquo; approval in good faith. The agreement noted that if both parties reached an agreement with respect to the documents that the plaintiffs selected for <em>in camera</em> review, the parties would file a stipulation of dismissal of the case with prejudice, but if not, they would continue to file joint status reports with the court. Pursuant to this agreement, the parties continued to negotiate in good faith and filed three additional joint status reports updating the court on their progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties reached a resolution on January 7, 2022, and filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(ii). The court dismissed the case on January 12, 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is closed.</p>",

No. 19-cv-3557 (RDM) \n \nWILLIAM P. BARR, in his official capacity \nas Attorney General of the United \nStates, et al.,  \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nJOINT STATUS REPORT \n  The parties respectfully submit this joint status report in compliance with the Courtโs orders \nof August 27, 2020, and August 31, 2020, directing the parties to address (1) โthe progress of \naccommodations on the priority documents,โ and (2) โhow the Court should proceed in light of \nthe opinion issued [on August 31, 2020] by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in \nCommittee on the Judiciary v. McGahn, No. 19-5331 (D.C. Cir.),โ respectively. \nCommittee on Oversight and Reformโs Statement: \nThe parties are at an impasse with respect to the remaining priority documents.  These 11 \nCommerce Department documents and email chains have been prioritized by the Committee \nsince March 2019.  See Compl. ยถยถ 90-91 & n.153 (Nov. 26, 2019), ECF No. 1.1  Defendants \nhave now informed the Committee that the remaining priority documents span a mere 51 pages.  \n \n1 The Gary Letter drafts were also among the Committeeโs priority documents, see ECF \nNo. 23 at 3-4 n.2, but after the Department of Justice permitted Committee staff to review them \nin camera, the Committee informed Defendants and the Court that they are no longer at issue, \nsee Aug. 27 Tr. at 5. \n \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 2 of 17\nDespite committing to negotiate over these materials as recently as August 27, 2020, Defendants \nhave declined to do so, and are now refusing to accommodate the Committeeโs need for these \ndocuments.  Defendantsโ attempts to wield the accommodations process as a means of delaying \ndisclosure about their maladministration and politicization of the 2020 Census must end. \nThe Committeeโs investigation centers on conduct that the District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York found to demonstrate a strong showing of bad faithโa finding that the \nSupreme Court endorsed.2  Yet despite the continued urgency of that investigation, and \nnotwithstanding the partiesโ impasse regarding the remaining priority documents, the Committee \nmust once again request that the Court await further proceedings in McGahn before moving \nforward.  The Committee respectfully requests, however, that as soon as D.C. Circuit precedent \nallows, the Court immediately order Defendants to disclose the remaining priority documents to \nthe Committee. \n1.  At the August 27 status conference, when the Court asked whether there was โstill \nroom for compromise with respect toโ the remaining priority documentsโall of which the \nCommittee requested from the Commerce DepartmentโDefendants asserted: โIn our view, Your \nHonor, yes, there certainly is still room for future accommodation.โ  Aug. 27 Tr. at 19; see id. at \n20 (โ[W]e shouldnโt be pessimistic about how this can proceed.โ).  The Court instructed the \nparties to focus their accommodation efforts on those documents, and then to report what \nprogress has been made and whether โfurther efforts could be fruitful,โ id. at 38, so the Court \ncould โunderstand precisely what documents remain in dispute,โ id. at 39. \n \n2 Depโt of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2573-76 (2019), affโg in part & revโg \nin part New York v. Depโt of Commerce, 351 F. Supp. 3d 502, 547-48, 571-72, 661-62 (S.D.N.Y. \n2019). \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 3 of 17\nSince the August 27 status conference, Defendants have confirmedโfirst in \ncorrespondence with the Committee on September 9 and now in their statement belowโthat the \nparties are at an impasse with respect to all 11 of the remaining priority documents. \na.  Shortly after the August 27 status conference, the Committee renewed its request that \nDefendants permit Committee staff to review the remaining priority documents in camera to \nenable the Committee to determine whether or not to continue to seek their disclosure.  The \nCommittee further asked, if Defendants would not permit such review, what other \naccommodations Defendants were prepared to offer.  When Defendants had not responded by \nSeptember 2, the Committee followed-up and suggested a call.  On September 9, without \nengaging with the terms of the Committeeโs requests, Defendants notified the Committee that \nโafter further consideration of the Committeeโs request for access to the remaining 11 priority \ndocuments, in light of the Committeeโs most recent articulation of its need for these documents \nin the partiesโ August 17, 2020, Joint Status Report, [Defendants] are unable to offer the \nCommittee an accommodation regarding these documents at this time.โ \nDefendantsโ latest about-faceโa sharp reversal from August 27 to September 9โ\nsuggests that they never had any genuine intent to accommodate the Committeeโs need for the \nremaining priority documents.  See, e.g., ECF No. 46 at 4-5.  Instead, their actions indicate that \ntheir aim all along has been to delay disclosure of those documentsโincluding by repeatedly \nholding out an artificial promise of an accommodation and then withdrawing itโuntil, in their \nview, โthere is zero chanceโ of any additional revelations about their misconduct making a \ndifference.  Id. at 10.  Since at least March 2019, Defendants have professed a willingness to \ncompromise but insisted on judging the Committeeโs requests for information against an \nunlawful standard that Defendants then claim the Committee cannot meet.  See ECF No. 34 at 2.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 4 of 17\nIn mid-January 2020, after the Committee filed suit, Defendants reversed course, admitting in \ntheir brief that โ[t]he parties have reached an impasseโ regarding the priority documents.  ECF \nNo. 19 at 60.  Yet on January 30, Defendants changed course once again, telling the Court at the \nhearing that it should stay its hand because they were โprepared to continue to engage on those \ndocuments.โ  Jan. 30 Tr. at 85-86; accord ECF No. 34 at 5. \nDefendants repeated that claim just two weeks ago, as detailed above, in again urging \ndelay at the August 27 status conference.  To be sure, Defendants โma[de] clearโ that they were \nโnot promisingโ anything, asserting that their willingness to โreach an accommodation โฆ \ndepends on conversations between the parties and what the House can explain as to what it needs \nand why,โ Aug. 27 Tr. at 20โechoing their previous refrains and ignoring that the Committeeโs \nthorough explanations of its legislative purpose suffice under any standard, see ECF No. 46 at 2.3  \nFinally, since the status conference, Defendants have declined to even have a conversation with \nthe Committee and have again refused to accommodate the Committeeโs need for the remaining \npriority documents.  Defendants have not explained why it took them 18 months to alert the \nCommittee, and 9 months to alert this Court, of that final determination.  \nDefendants have represented to the Court that they have โbeen telling the Committee \nthroughout this processโ that they are open to an accommodation regarding the remaining \npriority documents.  Aug. 27 Tr. at 19 (emphasis added).  That was not true on August 27, see, \ne.g., ECF No. 19 at 60, and it certainly is not true now.  In fact, the only thing that has been \n \n3 See also Jan. 30 Tr. at 86 (The Court, to counsel for Defendants: โMy sense is you \nprobably have what youโre going to get with respect to the description of need, which is at least \nin the Houseโs papers that theyโve filed in this case where theyโve devoted a fair amount of \nattention to discussing the need.  And it may be that they are not in a position to tell you exactly \nthe need for a particular document because they donโt know whatโs in the document until they \nsee it.โ). \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 5 of 17\nconsistent about Defendantsโ behavior is that they have claimed to be open to accommodations \nover the remaining priority documents only when they think that is to their advantage.  \nDefendantsโ shifting statements to the Court and to the Committee raise troubling questions \nabout whether they have been negotiating over the remaining priority documents in good faith.  \nTheir statements also fit a pattern: the very misconduct the Committee is investigating concerns \nDefendantsโ bad faith in repeatedly asserting a falsehood to courts and to Congress.  See, e.g., \nECF No. 46 at 2.4 \nThe Court should be concerned about Defendantsโ gambit.  The Committee respectfully \nsuggests that the Court hold a status conference to examine how and why Defendantsโ positions \nhave changed so conspicuously over time.  Courts routinely hold status conferences to ask \nquestions of parties, including agency counsel, in far less serious circumstances.  An initial step \nlike that is warranted here, to assess Defendantsโ representations to the Court and to understand \nfrom the decisionmakers at the Commerce Department whether their negotiations regarding the \nremaining priority documents have been in good faith. \nb.  To the extent there was ever any question, Defendantsโ statement below confirms that \nthe parties are at an impasse with respect to the remaining priority documents.  While the Court \nasked the parties to be โas forthcoming as possibleโ about the prospect of future accommodations \nso the Court could โknow which documentsโ to โfocus on,โ Aug. 27 Tr. at 39, Defendantsโ \nstatement does not provide that kind of detail.  Instead, Defendants restate their legal arguments \nand attempt to re-litigate the fundamental legal dispute that has divided the parties from the start \n \n4 Defendants โhasten to observe,โ below, that the New York v. Depโt of Commerce court \ndeclined to sanction the Commerce and Justice Departments upon concluding that the record in \nthat case did not show โclear and convincing evidence of โฆ a schemeโ to โintentionally mislead \nthe Courtโ on a particular issue.  No. 18-cv-2921, 2020 WL 2564933, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, \n2020) (quotation marks omitted).  This does not allay the Committeeโs concerns. \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 6 of 17\nregarding the priority documents.  See ECF No. 34 at 2-4.  That disputeโwhich largely concerns \nDefendantsโ insistence on a legally incorrect standard for disclosure of those documents5โhas \nbeen fully addressed in the partiesโ briefs, see ECF Nos. 17, 19, 23, 27, at the January 30 \nargument, and in the partiesโ dueling statements in their February 13 Joint Status Report, see \nECF No. 34.  It is ripe for adjudication.  See id. at 2-4. \nDefendants are wrong in asserting that the House sees โthe accommodation processes [as] \nan obstacle to what it really want[s] to be doing, which [is] litigating in Court.โ  Aug. 27 Tr. at \n20; see Comm. on Judiciary v. McGahn, 968 F.3d 755, 772 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (en banc) \n(โLitigation, as the [House] General Counsel โฆ emphasized to this court during oral argument, \nis not a preferred option of politicians.โ).  But โthe ordinary and effective functioning of the \nLegislative Branch critically depends on the legislative prerogative to obtain information.โ  Id. at \n761.  For the accommodations process to function, both sides must approach it genuinely, and \nwhen it falters, โjudicial enforcement of congressional subpoenasโ becomes necessary.  Id.; see \nid. at 771-72. \n2.  The Committeeโs investigation into Defendantsโ misconduct is urgent.  See, e.g., ECF \nNo. 46 at 2-3, 5-6.  Indeed, since the parties filed their August 17 Joint Status Report, the \nCommitteeโs concerns have only increased.  The Committee has obtained and publicized an \ninternal Census Bureau document warning the Commerce Department that forcing the Bureau to \ncomplete its count under the current deadlines could severely degrade the countโs accuracy and \ncompleteness.  The Committee has also conducted briefings with three senior Bureau officials \n \n5 Defendants also gesture at whether common-law privileges apply as against Congress, \nbut as the Committee has previously explained, the Court need not reach that constitutional \nquestion because even if the privileges did apply, Defendantsโ misconduct has vitiated them and \nDefendants have not laid the proper foundations for them.  See, e.g., ECF No. 23 at 35. \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 7 of 17\nwho all confirmed the imminent risk to an accurate 2020 Censusโand who were prevented from \nanswering several of the Committeeโs questions by Commerce Department lawyersโand held \nanother hearing.6 \nIn the past week alone, courts have struck down as unlawful President Trumpโs July 2020 \nmemorandum ordering the exclusion of immigrants lacking lawful status from the \nreapportionment following the 2020 Census, and temporarily restrained the Bureau from ending \nthe count by September 30 (a month earlier than planned).7  As the Committee has explained, \nthese actions by the Trump Administration provide further evidence of maladministration by \npolitical appointees and attempts to politicize the census.  ECF No. 46 at 2-3.  The need for \nremedial legislation and ongoing oversight continues to increase, and to fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibilities, the Committee is plainly entitled to the communications among the major \nplayers in Defendantsโ scheme.  Nonetheless, the Committee must now request that the Court \nawait further action by the en banc D.C. Circuit in McGahn before adjudicating the partiesโ \ncross-motions in this case. \nIn McGahn, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit has held that a House committee lacks a \ncause of action to enforce its subpoena to a former Executive Branch official.  See No. 19-5331, \n2020 WL 5104869 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 31, 2020), pet. for rehโg pending (D.C. Cir. filed Sept. 8, \n2020).  The McGahn panelโs decision conflicts with precedent, including the Supreme Courtโs \nrecent reaffirmation of House committeesโ constitutional right to obtain information, Trump v. \n \n6 See Letter from Chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, et al., at 1-\n2, 4 & n.6, 6 (Sept. 2, 2020), https://perma.cc/C766-ZX4Y; Committee on Oversight and \nReform, Providing the Census Bureau with the Time to Produce a Complete and Accurate \nCensus (Sept. 10, 2020), https://perma.cc/77JS-ZWEZ. \n7 See New York v. Trump, No. 20-cv-5770, 2020 WL 5422959 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2020) \n(three-judge court); Natโl Urb. League v. Ross, No. 20-cv-5799, 2020 WL 5291452 (N.D. Cal. \nSept. 5, 2020). \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 8 of 17\nMazars USA, LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2031 (2020), and the en banc D.C. Circuitโs recent holding \nthat โconstitutional structure and historical practice support judicial enforcement of \ncongressional subpoenas when necessary,โ McGahn, 968 F.3d at 761.  The McGahn panelโs \ndecision also threatens to hamstring Congressional investigations.  Accordingly, the House has \npetitioned for rehearing en banc and the D.C. Circuit has ordered the Department of Justice to \nrespond by September 24.  Further action by the en banc D.C. Circuit in McGahn will inform \nthis Courtโs determination whether the Committee has a cause of action to seek judicial \nenforcement of its subpoenas. \nThe Committee respectfully requests that, as soon as D.C. Circuit precedent allows, the \nCourt immediately proceed to order disclosure of the remaining priority documents to the \nCommittee.  In the meantime, the Committee intends to attempt further progress with Defendants \nwith respect to documents other than the remaining priority documents.  Of the non-priority \ndocuments Defendants have withheld in full or in part, the Committee has highlighted a small \npercentageโaround 830 documents, less than 15% of the already substantially narrowed setโ\nand requested that Defendants permit Committee staff review them in camera to determine \nwhether the Committee will continue to press for their disclosure.  The vast majority of those \nrequests remain pending, some for six months.  As the Court has observed, โactions by the \njudiciary can sometimes help move the parties along in their discussions.โ  Aug. 27 Tr. at 21.  \nAccordingly, the Committee respectfully requests that the Court require the parties to file joint \nstatus reports on their accommodations efforts every three weeks, as they have been doing. \nWith regard to the non-priority documents, Defendantsโ statement below is notable for \nwhat it omits.  In arguing that the accommodations process has been successful so far, Defendants \nclaim that it has been responsible for reducing โthe number of pages as to which the Court may \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 9 of 17\none day have to rule โฆ from 346 to approximately 50.โ  That does not include the non-priority \ndocuments, which remain part of this case.  See, e.g., ECF No. 23 at 51-58.  The initial draft of \nDefendantsโ statement that Defendants sent to the Committee expressed a willingness to โcontinue \nengaging in the accommodation process with respect to the non-priority documents for as long as \nthe partiesโ conversations remain productive, irrespective of the status of this litigation.โ  The \nrevised draft of Defendantsโ statement omits that assurance, further confirming the Committeeโs \nconcern about Defendantsโ commitment to the process. Defendantsโ Statement:   \n1.   As the Court is aware, the subpoenaed documents that the Committee has identified \nas โpriorityโ documents may be divided into three categories:  (1) two drafts of a memorandum \nprepared  by  a  former  Department  of  Commerce  (โCommerceโ)  attorney,  James  Uthmeier, \ncontaining advice submitted to Secretary Ross regarding the legal authority for reinstating a \ncitizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire; (2) nine e-mail chains, six of which are \nbetween the Secretary and his senior advisors, two of which are between the Secretaryโs senior \nadvisors, and one of which is between the Secretaryโs senior advisors and the White House, from \nwhich certain information, both related and unrelated to the census, has been redacted; and (3) 89 \ndrafts of the so-called โGaryโ letter in which the Department of Justice requested that the Bureau \nof the Census restore a citizenship question to the 2020 census.   \n  Over the course of the accommodation process that the parties have pursued since February \nof this year, the Department of Justice (โDOJโ) has permitted Committee staff to review all 89 \ndrafts of the Gary letter.  In addition, both Commerce and DOJ have provided the Committee \ncopies of all documents that they produced during the litigation in State of New York v. U.S. Depโt \nof Commerce, 351 F. Supp. 3d 502 (S.D.N.Y.), affโd in part and revโd in part, 139 S. Ct. 2551 \n(2019).  DOJ has also permitted Committee staff to review 163 additional privileged documents \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 10 of 17\nthat DOJ withheld in the New York case.  These were documents of interest to which Committee \nstaff requested access after DOJ permitted the Committee to review its privilege log prepared in \nthat case.   \n  At the Courtโs direction, Defendants have recently focused their efforts on evaluating the \npossibility of an accommodation with respect to the remaining priority documents, rather than the \nnon-priority documents that the parties had been primarily discussing.  For the reasons explained \nbelow, however, Commerce has concluded, after consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel \n(โOLCโ), that it cannot agree to accommodate the Committeeโs request for production, or staff \nreview, of the remaining 11 priority documents.    \n  As the Supreme Court recently confirmed, recipients of congressional subpoenas โhave \nlong been understood to retain common law and constitutional privileges with respect to certain \nmaterials, such as attorney-client communications and governmental communications protected \nby executive privilege.โ  Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2032 (2020).  Accordingly, \na  decision  to  disclose  subpoenaed  agency  documents  and  communications  over  which  the \nPresident has made a formal assertion of executive privilege must take into account the Executive \nBranch confidentiality interests implicated by the sought-after materials, and the interests that \nwould be served by permitting the disclosure.  See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 711-12 \n(1974); In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 755-57 (D.C. Cir. 1997).   \n  The confidentiality interests implicated by the remaining priority documents are of a higher \norder than the other documents, including the draft Gary letters, that Defendants have shared with \nthe Committee or its staff.  The two draft Uthmeier memoranda were prepared for the purpose of \nproviding legal advice to the Secretary regarding his statutory authority to reinstate a citizenship \nquestion.  See Second Decl. of Anthony Foti (โ2d Foti Decl.โ) ยถยถ 5, 10 (ECF No. 18-7).  Matters \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 11 of 17\nconcerning the scope of the legal authority possessed by high-ranking officials are often those on \nwhich  expert  advice  is  vital,  and  to  ensure  the  candor  and  objectivity  of  that  advice  its \nconfidentiality must be assured, at least in all but exceptional cases.   \n  The additional nine priority documents all constitute e-mail exchanges involving the \nSecretary and/or his senior advisors on a variety of matters, some pertaining to the census, some \nnot.    See  id.  ยถยถ  23-26.  โ[T]he  valid  need  for  protection  of  communications  between  high \nGovernment officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold \nduties . . . is too plain to require [extended] discussion.โ  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 705.  Regardless of \nthe specific subject matter or content of a given e-mail exchange, it is essential to the effective \nfunctioning of the Executive Branch that the confidentiality of communications between Cabinet-\nlevel officials and their senior staff be protected from unwarranted intrusion, to ensure the candor \nand objectivity of the information and advice that these officials receive.   \n  To  overcome  the  Executive  confidentiality  interests  inhering  in  documents  and \ncommunications of this nature requires at the very least that a Congressional committee make a \nspecific demonstration of need for the desired materials to fulfill its legislative functions.  See \nSenate Select Comm. on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 730-31 (D.C. \nCir. 1974) (en banc).  Although the Committee continues to insist that the remaining priority \ndocuments are โcrucialโ and โcriticalโ to its ongoing investigation, Joint Status Report (Aug. 17, \n2020) (โAug. 17 JSRโ) at 2, 3 (ECF No. 46), it has made no demonstration of a specific need for \nthese documents that would justify their disclosure.  Most recently the Committee has asserted an \nโongoing responsibility to exercise its oversight authority to ensure that the Trump Administration \nacts to further the Censusโs constitutional goals[,]โ and a corresponding need to โunderstand what \nDefendantsโ actions reveal about the integrity of the census process.โ  Id. at 2.  But these are \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 12 of 17\ngeneralities  only.    They  describe  the  overall  nature  and  objectives  of  the  Committeeโs \ninvestigation, but they do not explain why the particular documents on which the Committee is \nfixated are โcrucialโ or โcriticalโ to achieving those objectives.   \n  With somewhat greater specificity, the Committee now points to several actions and \ninitiatives  by  the  Administration  as  โfurtherโ  evidence,  in  the  Committeeโs  eyes,  that  the \nSecretaryโs decision to reinstate a citizenship question was part of a plan, conceived of by a (now \ndeceased) redistricting specialist named Dr. Thomas Hofeller, to โmanipulat[e]โ the census to \nenhance the political power of โRepublicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.โ  Aug. 17 JSR at 2-3.   \nDefendants hasten to observe that the district court in New York recently found no support for \nclaims that the Departments of Commerce or Justice have been concealing evidence of any such \nplan.  State of New York v. U.S. Depโt of Commerce, 2020 WL 2564933, at *2, *5-6 (May 21, \n2020).  Certainly the remaining priority documents, now nearly three or more years old, shed no \nlight on the existence (or not) of a scheme currently afoot to โmanipulat[e]โ the census for political \npurposes.  The draft Uthmeier memoranda discuss the legal grounds for reinstating a citizenship \nquestion, not the motivation or purpose for doing so.  See 2d Foti Decl. ยถยถ 5, 10.8  The information \nredacted from five of the nine โpriorityโ e-mail chains concerns the Census Bureauโs logistical and \nfinancial readiness for the 2020 census; from whom Commerce should seek advice regarding \nreinstatement of a citizenship question; whether Commerce was required to notify Congress of \nDOJโs request to reinstate a citizenship question; and what issues concerning restoration of a \ncitizenship question should be discussed in the Secretaryโs decision memo.  Id. ยถยถ 19-23.  The \n \n8  Similarly, Mr. Uthmeierโs cover note, accompanying the draft of his memorandum \nprovided to DOJ, expresses the Secretaryโs tentative view on the utility of a citizenship question \nfor purposesโand only for purposesโof enforcing the Voting Rights Act.  2d Foti Decl. ยถ 16. \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 13 of 17\nmaterial redacted from the final four โpriorityโ e-mails has nothing to do with the census at all.  Id. \nยถยถ 24-26.    \n  Having reconsidered the Committeeโs request for disclosure of the remaining priority \ndocuments, and the explanations given by the Committee for its request, Commerce has concluded, \nafter consultation with OLC, that the privileged information withheld from these documents bears \ninsufficient relation to the Committeeโs stated legislative objectives to justify the disclosure of \ninternal deliberations among a Cabinet-level officer and his senior advisors on important matters \nof policy and administration.  Revealing communications of this nature on so thin a showing of \nneed as the Committee has made here would undermine the assurance of confidentiality that is \nessential to sound decision-making at the highest levels of the Executive Branch.  Commerce can \ntherefore offer the Committee no accommodation concerning the remaining priority documents at \nthis time.  Were the Committee to explain in greater detail why it cannot fulfill its legislative \nresponsibilities without access to these documents in particular, then of course, Commerce would \nbe prepared to discuss the matter further. \n2.   The D.C. Circuitโs decision in Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn, --- F. 3d --\n--, 2020 WL 5104869 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 31, 2020), petition for rโhg en banc pending, makes clear \nthat the Committee is not entitled to the untraditional judicial relief that it seeks in this lawsuit.  In \nMcGahn, as here, the plaintiff committee sought to find a cause of action through which it could \nenforce its subpoenas against the Executive Branch in an amorphous combination of Article I of \nthe Constitution, the federal courtsโ traditional equity powers, and the Declaratory Judgment Act.  \nSee id. at *1-4.  McGahn squarely rejected that attempt, explaining that โCongress has declined to \nauthorize lawsuits like the Committeeโs twice over,โ id. at *1, and that โCongress itself has \nprecluded us from granting the requested relief to the Committee,โ id. at *2.  Notwithstanding the \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 14 of 17\nHouseโs hope that the D.C. Circuit will agree to take McGahn en banc a second time, the panel \nopinion is binding precedent today, see, e.g., Ayuda, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 919 F.2d 153, 154 (D.C. \nCir. 1990) (Henderson, J., concurring), and under that precedent this case should be dismissed. \n  Defendants acknowledge that the Court might instead elect to stay the action pending \nfurther guidance from the D.C. Circuit, rather than dismiss it at this time.  Defendants would not \nobject to the Courtโs staying this case pending further proceedings in McGahn provided that any \nsuch stay extend through the completion of any Supreme Court proceedings, and not merely the \ncompletion of proceedings in the D.C. Circuit.   \n3.   The  Committeeโs  suggestion  that  Defendants  are  attempting  โto  wield  the \naccommodations process as a means of delaying disclosureโ of the priority documents is baseless.  \nFollowing the January 30, 2020 hearing, at the Courtโs direction, the parties renewed focus on the \npossibility of accommodation principally with respect to the non-priority documents.  As set out \nabove, both the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce engaged in that process \nin good faith, each producing a significant volume of additional documents to the Committee.  In \naddition, it is undisputed that the Department of Justice produced for Committee staffโs in camera \nreview 89 drafts of the Gary Letter, priority documents over which the President had previously \nmade a conclusive assertion of Executive Privilege.  The Committee only withdrew its request for \nproduction of those materials on August 26, 2020; in other words, the accommodation process was \nworking as to the priority documents as recently as one day before the August 27, 2020 hearing.  \nAgainst that backdrop, the Committeeโs suggestion that Defendants somehow acted improperly in \nsuggesting that they have been open to the accommodations process throughout this litigation, or \nthat further efforts at accommodation might lead to additional progress, is bewildering. \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 15 of 17\nFollowing the August 27 hearing, at the Courtโs direction, Defendants shifted primary \nfocus from the nonpriority documents to the priority documents.  The Committee began that new \nphase of the accommodations process that evening by requesting either full production or in \ncamera review of all remaining priority documents, without any offer to either narrow its request \nor provide additional information about legislative need.   Following thorough review with all \nrelevant stakeholders over the intervening two weeks, Defendants determined that they were not \nwilling to offer additional accommodations.  That does not mean that โDefendants never had any \ngenuine intent to accommodateโ the Committeeโs need, or that Defendants made statements that \nwere โnot true on August 27.โ  It instead means that the Defendants did exactly what the Court \nasked them to do:  focus on the priority documents and decide whether further accommodation \nwas possible.  Were Defendants engaged in the bad-faith scheme of which Plaintiffs accuse them, \nDefendants would have every incentive to hide the ball.  But that is not what Defendants are doing:  \nDefendants are being forthright with both the Committee and this Court that, based on the \narticulations of need that the Committee has provided to date, Defendants do not believe that \nfurther accommodation is possible with respect to the priority documents.  Such a result cannot \npossibly come as a shock to the Committee, which (1) has repeatedly asserted over the past six \nmonths that the parties are at an impasse, and (2) heard Defendants clearly state at the August 27 \nstatus conference that further accommodation might ultimately not be possible. \nAgainst that backdrop, the Committeeโs request for a status conference โto examine how \nand why Defendantsโ positions have changed so conspicuously over timeโ is meritless.  While the \nCommittee imagines bad faith, there is a far simpler explanation:  the Court asked for a final answer \nas to the priority documents by September 11, and Defendants worked hard to provide one.  The \nCommittee may not like Defendantsโ answer, but the fact that the accommodations process has not \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03557-RDM   Document 49   Filed 09/12/20   Page 16 of 17\nconcluded with capitulation by the Executive Branch does not mean that the accommodation \nprocess was never worth pursuing.  It plainly was:  if nothing else, the number of pages as to which \nthe Court may one day have to rule has dropped from 346 to approximately 50. \nFinally, to our utter surprise and disappointment, at the last minute before filing the \nCommittee added to its statement a remark that Defendantsโ statement now omits an earlier \nexpression of willingness to continue engaging in the accommodation process with respect to the \nnon-priority documents.  The reason for that omission should not be difficult to grasp.  Having \nonce been accused of acting in bad faith and making misrepresentations to the Court, Defendants \ndid not wish to be so accused a second time if the outcome of any further efforts at accommodation \nover the remaining non-priority documents were not to the Committeeโs liking. \nUltimately, the Committeeโs reckless, offensive, and incorrect speculation is a distraction \nfrom the fundamental point, which it conspicuously does not address at any meaningful length: it \ndoes not have a sufficient need for the subpoenaed priority documents to overcome the \nPresidentโs assertion of executive privilege.  And in any case, so long as the latest McGahn \ndecision remains good law, this is a question for the political process, not this Court. \n/s/ Douglas N. Letter \nDouglas N.
