    "summary": "<p>On April 13, 2018, the Arab American Institute (โAAIโ) sued the Office of Management and Budget (โOMBโ) under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ), 5 U.S.C. ยง 552, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. AAI alleged that OMB violated FOIA by failing to disclose requested records pertaining to OMBโs decision not to include a combined race and ethnicity question or a Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) category on the 2020 Census. AAI asked the court to declare that OMB violated FOIA and to issue an injunction ordering the agency to release the requested records. This case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson. </p><p>One month later, on May 18, 2018, the court ordered OMB to file a dispositive motion or a status report setting a schedule for OMBโs production of documents to AAI. OMB chose the latter, filing its first status report on June 15, 2018. Over the next two years, the parties filed several joint status reports detailing which documents OMB had disclosed to AAI and which documents were still outstanding or disputed. By May 13, 2020, OMB had reviewed approximately 2,000 potentially responsive documents, producing โa numberโ of them to AAI and withholding 161 of them, claiming they were FOIA exempt. AAI objected to the withholding of five of the allegedly exempt documents.</p><p>OMB filed a motion for summary judgment on February 10, 2020, arguing that the five disputed documents were exempt under FOIA Exemption 5, which allows agencies to withhold โinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,โ including โpredecisional and deliberativeโ documents that reflect internal Executive Branch deliberations.

    "summary_short": "On April 13, 2018, the Arab American Institute sued the Office of Management and Budget under the Freedom of Information Act in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. AAI alleged that OMB violated FOIA by failing to disclose requested records pertaining to OMBโs decision not to include a combined race and ethnicity question or a Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) category on the 2020 Census. In May, the court ordered OMB to file a dispositive motion or a status report setting a schedule for OMBโs production of documents to AAI. Over the next two years, the parties filed several joint status reports detailing which documents OMB had disclosed to AAI and which documents were still outstanding or disputed. OMB produced a number of documents to AAI but withheld some, claiming they were FOIA exempt. AAI objected to five claimed exemptions. The parties both filed motions for summary judgment. After conducting in camera review, on August 13, 2020, the court granted OMBโs motion for summary judgment and denied AAIโs cross-motion, finding that the disputed documents were predecisional and exempt from FOIA. As of December 25, 2020, AAI has not appealed the courtโs decision. ",

In that \nrole,  plaintiff  โworks  on  questions  of  classification  of  the  Arab  American  community  and \nencourages the [Census Bureau] to broaden its options pertaining to ancestry, race, and ethnicity.โ  \nCompl. ยถ 7.   \n  The Census Bureau is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Who We Are, United \nStates Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/about/who.html (last visited Aug. 13, 2020).  OMB \nis part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States.  See Office of Management \nand Budget, White House, https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ (last visited Aug. 13, 2020).  OMB \ncreates the standards for maintaining, collecting, and presenting federal data on race and ethnicity, \nsee Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race & Ethnicity, 81 \nFed.

About,  United  States  Census, \nhttps://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html (last visited Aug. 13, 2020).   \n  To help make its decision on whether it should change the previous race and ethnicity \nstandards to include a โMiddle Eastern or North Africanโ category, OMB formed an Interagency \nWorking Group for Research on Race and Ethnicity (โIWGโ).  See Pl.โs FOIA Request, Ex. 1 to \nDeclaration of Heather V. Walsh [Dkt. # 32-2] (โFOIA Requestโ); Declaration of Heather Walsh \n[Dkt. # 32-2] (โWalsh Decl.โ). ยถ 5.

Plaintiff requested that the agency expedite its processing of the request.  FOIA Request at \n5.   \n  On February 21, 2018, OMB acknowledged receipt of plaintiffโs FOIA request and \nassigned it OMB FOIA Number 2018-176.  Def.โs SUMF ยถ 3; Pl.โs SUMF at 1, ยถ 3.  On March 1, \n2018, OMB started searching for responsive documents, Def.โs SUMF ยถ 4; Pl.โs SUMF at 1, ยถ 4, \nbut it did not respond to the request to expedite processing, and it did not inform plaintiff within \ntwenty working days that it would comply with the FOIA request by producing documents or \nindicate  the  scope  of  the  documents  that  it  would  produce  in  accordance  with  5  U.S.C. \nยง 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  Pl.โs SUMF ยถยถ at 3, 6โ7.  On April 13, 2018, plaintiff filed this lawsuit, see \nCompl., and on May 18, 2018, the Court ordered OMB to file a report setting forth a production \nschedule by June 15, 2018.  Order [Dkt. # 9].  The parties conferred, and they agreed that defendant \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 4 of 14\nwould review the collected documents at a rate of 300 documents per month.

Def.โs \nMot.  On March 12, 2020, plaintiff opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary \njudgment.

On May 13, 2020, the parties filed a joint \nstatus report stating that they had resolved their dispute as to four of the nine documents.  Joint \nStatus Report [Dkt. # 38].   \n  On July 24, 2020, the Court determined that in-camera review of the remaining five records \nwould aid it in making a responsible, de novo ruling on defendantโs claim that FOIA Exemption 5 \nwas applicable.  See Ray v. Turner, 587 F.2d 1187, 1195 (D.C. Cir. 1978).  It ordered defendant to \nproduce the documents at issue for inspection.  Min. Order (July 24, 2020).  Defendant complied \nwith that order on July 31, 2020.  Notice [Dkt. # 43].  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nSummary judgment is appropriate โif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 5 of 14\n56(a).  The party seeking summary judgment โbears the initial responsibility of informing the \ndistrict  court  of  the  basis  for  its  motion,  and  identifying  those  portions  of  the  pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.โ  Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  To defeat summary \njudgment, the non-moving party must โdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine \nissue for trial.โ  Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).  When the court is presented with \ncross-motions for summary judgment, it analyzes the underlying facts and inferences in each \npartyโs motion in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). \n  The mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.  Id. \nat 247โ48.  A dispute is โgenuineโ only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving \nparty; a fact is โmaterialโ only if it is capable of affecting the outcome of the litigation.  Id. at 248; \nLaningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \nWhen considering a motion for summary judgment under FOIA, the court must conduct a \nde novo review of the record.  See 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  The court may grant summary \njudgment based on information provided in an agencyโs affidavits or declarations when they are \nโrelatively detailed and non-conclusory,โ SafeCard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. \nCir. 1991) (citation omitted), and โnot controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor \nby evidence of agency bad faith.โ  Military Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. \n1981).  Such affidavits or declarations are โaccorded a presumption of good faith, which cannot \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 6 of 14\nbe  rebutted  by  purely  speculative  claims  about  the  existence  and  discoverability  of  other \ndocuments.โ  SafeCard, 926 F.2d at 1200 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nANALYSIS \nFOIA requires government agencies to release records upon request in order to โensure an \ninformed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check against \ncorruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.โ  NLRB v. Robbins Tire & \nRubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978).  The statute provides that: โeach agency, upon any request \nfor records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with \npublished  rules . . . shall  make  the  records  promptly  available  to  any  person,โ \n5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(3)(A), unless the records fall within one of nine narrowly construed exemptions.  \nSee ยง 552(b); FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615, 630โ31 (1982).  This framework โrepresents a \nbalance struck by Congress between the publicโs right to know and the governmentโs legitimate \ninterest in keeping certain information confidential.โ  Ctr. for Natโl Sec. Studies v. U.S. Depโt of \nJustice, 331 F.3d 918, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2003), citing John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. \n146, 152 (1989).  When an agency withholds documents or parts of documents, it must explain \nwhat it is withholding and specify the statutory exemptions that apply.  See Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 \nF.2d 820, 825โ28 (D.C. Cir. 1973).    \nIn this case, defendant maintains that it โappropriately searched for and provided records \nresponsive to the request at issue, subject to the withholding of certain information pursuant toโ \nFOIA Exemptions 5 and 6.  Def.โs Mot. at 3.  Plaintiff is not challenging the adequacy of \ndefendantโs search or its application of FOIA Exemption 6.  Pl.โs Cross-Mem. at 4 n.1, 8 n.5.  \nThus, there is no dispute of fact as to those issues, and the Court need not address them.  See \nShapiro v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 239 F. Supp. 3d 100, 105โ06 n.1 (D.D.C. 2017), citing Winston \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 7 of 14\n& Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  The Court will address the \nremaining issues โ the validity of the assertion of FOIA Exemption 5 and the segregability \nrequirement โ below.   \nI.  FOIA Exemption 5 \nExemption 5 permits agencies to withhold โinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or \nletters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the \nagency[.]โ  5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5); Depโt of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Assโn, 532 \nU.S. 1, 8 (2001).  A document may be properly withheld under Exemption 5 only if (1) its source \nis a government agency, and (2) it falls โwithin the ambit of a privilege against discovery under \njudicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.โ  Klamath, 532 U.S. \nat 8.  FOIA โplaces the burden on the agency to sustain the lawfulness of specific withholdings in \nlitigation.โ  Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Commโn, 216 F.3d 1180, 1190 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000).   \nThe exemption encompasses โprotections traditionally afforded [to] certain documents \npursuant to evidentiary  privileges in the  civil  discovery  context[,]โ including the executive \nโdeliberative processโ privilege.  Taxation with Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 676 \n(D.C. Cir. 1981).  Defendant has withheld the records at issue in this case claiming that the \ndeliberative process privilege applies to them.   \nโThe deliberative process privilege rests on the obvious realization that officials will not \ncommunicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery,โ and its \npurpose โis to enhance โthe quality of agency decisionsโ by protecting open and frank discussion \namong those who make them within the Government.โ  Klamath, 532 U.S. at 8โ9 (citations \nomitted), quoting NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (โSearsโ), 421 U.S. 132, 151 (1975).  To \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 8 of 14\naccomplish that goal, โ[t]he deliberative process privilege protects agency documents that are both \npredecisional and deliberative.โ  Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 449 F.3d 141, 151 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006), citing Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Depโt of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. \n1980).  A document is predecisional if โit was generated before the adoption of an agency policy,โ \nand deliberative if โit reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process.โ  Coastal States, 617 \nF.2d at 866.  โ[E]ven if the document is predecisional at the time it is prepared, it can lose that \nstatus if it is adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue or is used by the \nagency in its dealings with the public.โ  Id.  \nDefendant withheld 161 documents in full pursuant to Exemption 5.  Plaintiff disputes \ndefendantโs invocation of Exemption 5 as it relates to five documents.  Compare Pl.โs Mem. at 4 \nwith Joint Status Report [Dkt. # 38]; Pl.โs Reply in Supp. of Pl.โs Cross-Mot. [Dkt. # 41].  Those \ndocuments are: \n1.

A to Walsh Decl. [Dkt. # 32-2].  Some of the documents consisted โentirely of \nmeeting agendas and points of discussion to be used during IWGโs meeting.โ  Id.   \nFor the five documents at issue, the Vaughn index repeats the same reason for withholding \neach of them:   \nFOIA  Exemption  b(5)  -  Internal  Deliberative  Drafts.  Withheld  draft \ndocuments  in  the  process  of  revision  that  do  not  reflect  final  agency \ndecisions but are part of a decisionmaking process regarding the Standards \nfor Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and \nEthnicity. Disclosing material withheld or redacted due to the deliberative \nprocess privilege would inhibit the frank and candid expression of views \nand the sharing of information that are essential for OMB to carry out its \nresponsibilities, and would greatly impair the free exchange of information, \nideas and analysis within OMB, and between OMB and other agencies in \nthe Executive Branch. \n \nRevised Vaughn Index, Appx. A to Suppl. Walsh Decl. [Dkt. # 39-2].   \n \nThe declaration submitted by the agency supplies additional detail.  The declarant states \nthat the 161 documents consisted of โdrafts of IWG meeting materials from March 2017,โ Walsh \nDecl. ยถ 17; โ[n]on-final drafts of a presentation deck regarding the IWGโs work later revised before \nbeing presented to a public audience at [a] March 2017 conference,โ id.; โdeliberative discussions \nof the drafts in accompanying email records,โ id. ยถ 18; โdraft materials to be discussed during the \n[June 29, 2017] meeting,โ id.; โdraft materials and deliberative comments . . . circulated before \nand after the IWGโs July 10, 2017 meeting,โ id.; and โ[t]he draft report, annexes, and other \naccompanying materialโ id. ยถ 20.  The declarant avers that all the withheld records โwere created \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 10 of 14\nas part of a decision-making process conducted among staff in OMB in consultation with other \nExecutive Branch agencies[.]โ  Id. ยถ 22.   \nIn connection with the five documents at issue, the agencyโs declarant stated that the first \ndocument was one of the โearly drafts and outlines of IWGโs recommendationsโ that OMB staff \ncirculated within the agency in June of 2017.  Walsh Decl. ยถ 18.  The second and the fifth \ndocuments were โdrafts of a Federal Register Notice that would have been intended to represent \nOMBโs final decision regarding the recommendations of the IWG.โ  Id. ยถ 21.  OMB did not publish \na federal register notice, and the declarant averred that โOMB has made no final decision regarding \nthe IWGโs recommendations.โ  Id.  Finally, the fourth document was withheld because it was a \ndraft that was โnot finalized or relied on by OMBโ related to โmaterials for a planned โwebinarโ \nevent regarding OMBโs potential decision regarding IWGโs recommendations.โ  Id.    \nBased on the Courtโs in-camera review, as well as the information provided in the \ngovernmentโs affidavits, the Court finds that the five documents at issue are both predecisional \nand deliberative, and therefore fall within FOIA Exemption 5.   \nThe first document is a draft outline for IWGโs final report to OMB regarding its findings.  \nThe document includes comments and questions about proposals to be included.  This record is \npredecisional because it precedes and considers the content of the formal submission of findings \nto OMB, and it is deliberative.  See Coastal States, 617 F.2d at 866 (โThe exemption thus covers \nrecommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents.โ).   \nThe second and fifth documents are internal drafts of a federal register notice that was \nnever published.  They include comments and blank spaces where information is to be filled in, \nand thus the documents are part of the โgive-and-take of the deliberative process by which the \ndecision itself is made.โ  Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1975). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 11 of 14\nThe  third  and  fourth  documents  are  draft  presentations  outlining  potential \nrecommendations  and  describing  what  the  implementation  of  each  would  entail.    These \npresentations reviewing alternative courses of action are also both predecisional and deliberative.   \nBecause OMB has never publicly released a decision on whether to change the standards, \nthe agency took the position that the โdecision-making process was never concluded, [and] all \ninter- and intra-agency deliberations regarding these matters during the time of the search qualify \nfor the deliberative process privilege.โ  Walsh Decl. ยถ 15.  Plaintiff contends that public release is \nnot the defining feature of a โdecision;โ  it submits that OMB made a decision when it elected not \nto revise its race standards, and that if the documents reflect that decision to maintain the status \nquo, they have lost their predecisional status.  Pl.โs Cross-Mem. at 8โ13.   \nWhile the decision not to take a particular action can constitute a final decision, SafeCard \nServices, Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197, 1204 (D.C. Cir. 1991), defendantโs declarant avers that no \nfinal agency action has been taken, and plaintiff points to no evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiff \nargues that a final decision must have been made because the Census Bureau issued a statement \nannouncing that it would not include the โMiddle Eastern North Africanโ category on the 2020 \nCensus.  Pl.โs Cross-Mem. at 9โ10.  But the fact that the Census Bureau did not include the \ncategory does not mean that OMB came to an end of its decision-making process on what it would \nrecommend.   \n Furthermore, just because an agency has not made a decision does not strip records of their \npredecisional status.  As the D.C. Circuit has observed: \nThere may be no final agency document because a draft died on the vine.  \nBut the draft is still a draft and thus still pre-decisional and deliberative. . . .  \n[T]o require release of drafts that never result in final agency action would \ndiscourage innovative and candid internal proposals by agency officials and \nthereby contravene the purposes of the privilege.   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 12 of 14\nNatโl Sec. Archive v. CIA, 752 F.3d 460, 463 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see, e.g., Heartland All. For Human \nNeeds & Human Rights v. U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., 291 F. Supp. 3d 69, 78โ79 (D.D.C. 2018) \n(โA document may be predecisional even if a final decision is never reached.โ).   \nAnd, even if the agency had made an internal decision to maintain the status quo, the \ndocuments at issue would not lose their predecisional status because plaintiff has not shown that \nthey have been โadopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on an issue or is used by \nthe agency in its dealings with the public.โ1  Coastal States Gas Corp., 617 F.2d at 866; Sears, \n421 U.S. at 161 (โ[I]f an agency chooses expressly to adopt or incorporate by reference an intra-\nagency memorandum previously covered by Exemption 5 in what would otherwise be a final \nopinionโ that memorandum may not be withheld under Exemption 5).  Plaintiff does not point to \nany public statements that OMB has made referencing, adopting, or incorporating the records or \nthe subject matter at issue, nor has plaintiff provided the Court with any evidence that the records \nwere informally adopted as the agencyโs position.  Plaintiff references a statement made by Karen \nBattle, chief of the Census Bureauโs Population Division, on January 26, 2018, where she \nexplained that additional research and testing were necessary before the Census Bureau could \nproceed to implement a separate Middle Eastern or North African category.  Pl.โs Cross-Mem. at \n13.  Plaintiff argues that โ[t]o the extent that Ms. Battleโs explanation about the need for more \nresearch, and indeed the entire underlying decision to maintain the status quo, is evidenced in the \nwithheld documents, it has been adopted as the agencyโs policy.โ  Id.  But, this statement was \nmade by a Census Bureau official, not an OMB official.  And, in any event, the statement \n                                                           \n1   Courts in this district have held that the plaintiff carries the burden to show that the agency \nhas formally or informally adopted a record as policy.  See, e.g., Heffernan v. Azar, 317 F. Supp. \n3d 94, 122 (D.D.C. 2018), citing Sec. Fin. Life Ins. Co. v. U.S. Depโt of Treasury, No. 03-102, \n2005 WL 839543, at *7 (D.D.C. Apr. 12, 2005).   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 13 of 14\ndemonstrates the ongoing nature of the inquiry โ Ms. Battle states that the agency had not tested \nthe category as an ethnicity separate from race, and that research still needs to be completed before \nthe government makes its final decision.  See U.S. Census Bureau, 1/26/18: 2020 Census Quarterly \nProgram  Management  Review  (PMR),  Youtube  (Jan.  26,  2018), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v= 4He025kOzJo&feature=youtu.be&t=24m49s. \nThe records are draft documents that lay out various recommendations and proposals, and \ndisclosure of these documents โwould โdiscourage candid discussion within the agency.โโ  Access \nReports  v.  U.S.  Depโt  of  Justice,  926  F.2d  1192,  1195  (D.C.  Cir.  1991),  quoting Dudman \nCommcโns Corp. v. U.S. Depโt of Air Force, 815 F.2d 1565, 1567โ68 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  Thus, \ndefendant properly applied Exemption 5 to the documents and defendantโs motion for summary \njudgment will be granted.  \nII.  Segregability \n  The Court must make a segregability determination, even if not raised by the plaintiff.  \nSussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  While agencies must \nprovide a detailed justification for withholdings, the Court will give a presumption of compliance \nto the agency in segregating material, see Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Depโt of Air Force, 566 \nF.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977), but the plaintiff may overcome this by presenting evidence to the \ncontrary.  Sussman, 494 F.3d at 1117.  The government explained that it conducted a โdocument-\nby-document review of all records [it] collectedโ to assess whether any information could be \ndisclosed.  Walsh Decl. ยถ 25.  Plaintiff has not provided any evidence to the contrary.  Thus, based \non the governmentโs affidavit and its in-camera review of the records, the Court finds that there \nwas not any โfactual or otherwise nonexempt informationโ that could be segregated and disclosed.  \nId.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 45   Filed 08/13/20   Page 14 of 14\nCONCLUSION \n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant defendantโs motion for summary judgment, \nand it will deny plaintiffโs cross-motion for summary judgment.   \n  A separate order will issue. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  August 13, 2020 \n14 \n ",

This is an action under the Freedom oflnformatin Act (\"FOIA\"), 5 U.S.C.  ยง 552, and \nthe Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, for injunctive, declaratory and other \nappropriate relief. Plaintiff, Arab American Institute (\"AAI\"), challenges the failure of the Office \nof Management and Budget (\"OMB\") to disclose to AAI requested FOIA records relating to \nOMB inaction, which due to time constraints of the Census process, forced a default decision \nregarding an anticipated change to the current U.S. Census Bureau (\"USCB\") standards. \nAnnounced on January 26, 2018, USCB stated it will not use a combined question format for \nrace and ethnicity, and will not include a separate 'Middle Eastern or North African' (\"MENA\") \ncategory. \n2. This action seeks a declaratory judgment that OMB is in violation ofFOIA, 5 U.S.C. \nยงยง 552(a)(6)(A)(i), and (a)(8), by refusing to respond to AAI's FOIA request and refusing to \nsearch for and provide AAI with all responsive documents sought. Further, this action seeks \n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 04/13/18   Page 2 of 6\ninjunctive relief ordering the Defendant to process and release to AAI the requested records in \ntheir entirety. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n3. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4 )(B). The \nCourt also has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 2201(a), and 2202. \nVenue lies in this district under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B). \nParties \n4. Plaintiff AAI is a non-profit, nonpartisan national leadership organization organized \nunder Section 501 ( c )(4 ) of the Internal Revenue Code. AAI was created to nurture and \nencourage the direct participation of Arab Americans in political and civic life in the United \nStates. AAI represents the policy and community interests of Arab Americans throughout the \nUnited States. AAI strives to serve as a central resource to government officials, the media, \npolitical leaders and community groups on a variety of public policy issues that concern Arab \nAmericans and U.S.-Arab relations. As part of its mission, AAI serves as a U.S. Census Bureau \nCensus Information Center (\"CIC\") partner and uses government records made available to it \nunder FO IA to further this work. \n5. Defendant OMB is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(ยฃ) and 5 U.S.C. ยง \n701. The OMB is an office within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. \nOMB is the federal agency with possession and control of the requested records and is \nresponsible for fulfilling Plaintiffs FOIA request. \nFacts \n6. Over the last three decennial censuses, AAI served as an advocate on behalf of the \nArab American community through the CIC Network and the Decennial Census Advisory \nCommittee which are outgrowths of the USCB. \n-2-\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 04/13/18   Page 3 of 6\n7. Through this work, AAI works on questions of classification of the Arab American \ncommunity and encourages the USCB to broaden its options pertaining to ancestry, race, and \nethnicity. \n8. On January 26, 2018, the USCB issued a communication to CIC partners that OMB \nstandards regarding race and ethnicity questions would remain unchanged from the 1997 format. \n9. By letter dated February 16, 2018, delivered via facsimile, AAI submitted a FOIA \nrequest to OMB for the following: \na) Any and all communications involving members of the Interagency Working Group \nfor Research on Race and Ethnicity (\"IWG\") that discuss, mention, or otherwise \nreference the classification of a MENA group and distinct reporting category, or revisions \nto the Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and \nEthnicity occurring between January 20, 2017 and the date the search is conducted; \nb) Any and all communications, electronic or otherwise, on the topic of the \nclassification of a MENA group and distinct reporting category, or revisions to the \nStandards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and \nEthnicity occurring between January 20, 2017 and the date the search is conducted and \ninvolving the following personnel: Karen Battle, Angela Brittingham Buchanan, Anthony \nCampau, Ilona Cohen, John Czwartacki, Emma Doyle, James Galkowski, Ron Jarmin, \nJeffrey Harris, Nicholas Jones, Enrique Lamas, Domini Mancini, Rachel Marks, Mick \nMulvaney, Rosario Palmieri, Jennifer Park, Beverly Pratt, Roberto Ramirez, Neomi Rao, \nHyon Shin, and Merarys Rios Vargas; \nc) Any and all memoranda, statements, or documents provided to any OMB employee; \nreviewed by any OMB employee; relied upon by any OMB employee; or drafted, signed, \n- 3 -\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 04/13/18   Page 4 of 6\nauthorized or issued by any OMB employee related to the classification of a MENA \ngroup and distinct reporting category, or revisions to the Standards for Maintaining, \nCollecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity occuning between \nJanuary 20, 2017 and the date the search is conducted; \nd) Any and all IWG findings, recommendations, or conclusory materials sent to OMB \nbetween January 20, 2017 and the date the search is conducted pursuant to the planned \nissuance of a Federal Register Notice for December 2017; and \ne) Records describing the processing of this request, including records sufficient to \nidentify search terms used and locations and custodians searched, and any tracking sheets \nused to track the processing of this request. If OMB uses FOIA questionnaires or \ncertifications completed by individual custodians or components to determine whether \nthey possess responsive materials or to describe how they conducted searches, we also \nrequest any such records prepared in connection with the processing of this request. \n10. AAI's February 16, 2018 letter to OMB also requested expedited processing of its \nFOIA request in light of the urgency and timeline ofUSCB's report to Congress on the matter. \n11. By an email dated February 21, 2018, OMB acknowledge receipt of AAI's request \nand stated the request was in process (OMB FOIA number 2018-176). \n12. Since OMB's email on February 21, 2018, AAI has received no response or \ncommunication from OMB regarding its FOIA request despite follow-up with the OMB's FOIA \nRequest Service Center. OMB has not notified AAI in writing of unusual circumstances \nrequiring a delay of its response pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(B). \n-4-\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 04/13/18   Page 5 of 6\n13. AAI is deemed to have met the administrative exhaustion requirement as OMB did \nnot make a determination within the statutory time period, see Citizens for Responsibility & \nEthics in Washington v. Fed. Election Comrn'n, 711F.3d180 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \nPlaintiff's Claim for Relief \nClaim I \nOMB's Failure to Respond to FOIA Request \n14. Plaintiff repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-12 as though \nfully set forth therein. \n15. Plaintiff properly requested records within the custody and control of OMB pursuant \nto FOIA. \n16. Defendant OMB received and acknowledged Plaintiff's request for documents. \n17. To date, defendant OMB has failed to conduct a search for responsive records, and to \nprovide AAI will all responsive, non-exempt documents, nor has it cited a legal basis for its \nfailure to respond. \n18. Plaintiff has a statutory right to the records it seeks, and there is no legal basis for the \ndefendant OMB's refusal to disclose them. \n19. Therefore, by failing to release the records specifically requested by the Plaintiff, \ndefendant OMB had violated FOIA. \nRequested Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n(1) Declare that the records sought by the Plaintiff are subject to FO IA; \n(2) Declare that the Plaintiff is entitled to immediate processing and disclosure of the \nrequested records; \n- 5 -\n\nCase 1:18-cv-00871-ABJ   Document 1   Filed 04/13/18   Page 6 of 6\n(3) Declare that the failure of the Defendant to review and release records responsive to \nPlaintiffs request is unlawful; \n(4) Order Defendant to fully and expeditiously process Plaintiffs February 16, 2018 \nFOIA request and disclose all responsive records immediately to the Plaintiff; \n(5) Retain jurisdiction ofthis action to ensure that no agency records are wrongfully \nwithheld; \n(6) Award Plaintiff its costs and reasonable attorneys' fee in this action pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4 )(E); and \n(7) Grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper. \nDated: April 13, 2018  Respectfully submitted, \nBAKER HOSTETLER LLP \nBy: \nMark B  ยท en (D.C.
