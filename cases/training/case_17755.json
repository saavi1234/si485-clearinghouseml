    "summary": "<p>This is a case concerning the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 United States census. On July 30, 2018, the Campaign Legal Center (CLC), a nonprofit aimed at increasing access to democratic participation, brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The CLC sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), &sect; 5 U.S.C. 552. Represented by private and staff counsel, the CLC sought injunctive relief to compel the DOJ to release documents responsive to a FOIA request concerning the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, filed by the plaintiff on February 1, 2018. They claimed that, to date, the DOJ had produced no documents related to this \"citizenship question,\" despite the fact that the DOJ has sent a letter to the Commerce Department to include such a question on the 2020 census. The CLC's 2018 FOIA request sought the release of documents concerning several key words and phrases related to the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census. The CLC filed this request to find records pertaining to a request made by the DOJ to the Census Bureau to include such a question. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya Chutkan.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2018, the defendant released 59 pages of partially redacted responsive materials, withholding an additional 43 pages of responsive materials. Then, in November 2018, the defendant released an additional 11 pages of materials. The CLC continued to contest the adequacy of the defendant's search for responsive materials, and the defendant claimed that the materials it withheld were privileged, and therefore fell under a FOIA exemption.</p>\r\n<p>On May 8, 2019, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiff's cross-moved for summary judgment on May 22, 2019. Their dispute centered around two issues: (1) adequacy of the defendant&rsquo;s search terms in identifying responsive materials, and (2) whether the documents withheld by the defendants fell under a FOIA exemption which excludes from FOIA&rsquo;s disclosure obligation &ldquo;inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,&rdquo; including those containing advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations relating to the government&rsquo;s decisionmaking. This exemption is known as Exemption 5.</p>\r\n<p>On June 1, 2020, the court issued an order that partially granted and partially denied both parties&rsquo; motions. The court found the defendant&rsquo;s search terms inadequate because it only used a single term and this term was too narrow to encompass all responsive documents. The court also found that most of the documents withheld by the defendant fell under the FOIA exemption, except for drafts of the letter sent by the DOJ to the Census Bureau requesting the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census and emails relating to them. The court found the exemption inapplicable to these materials because the plaintiffs did not assert facts demonstrating their protection under the exemption. The defendant appealed the court&rsquo;s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 31, 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following the court&rsquo;s issuance of this order, the defendant conducted a supplementary search and provided the plaintiff with additional responsive documents on June 23, 2021 and July 9, 2021. However, the defendant withheld several documents, asserting that they were privileged under Exemption 5. The parties filed renewed motions for summary judgment to determine whether these documents fall under the exemption, with the defendant filing its motion on September 17, 2021 and the plaintiff filing its motion on November 2, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On May 17, 2022, the D.C. Circuit partially reversed the district court&rsquo;s June 1, 2020 summary judgment order. The D.C. Circuit held that the defendant properly withheld the drafts of the letter and the emails associated with the email. It reasoned that the process of drafting the letter involved policymaking discretion, and thus these materials were protected by the exemption because they were &ldquo;predecisional&rdquo; and &ldquo;deliberative.&rdquo; However, the court found that the record on five of the redacted emails was too sparse for it to determine whether they fell under the scope of this exemption, remanding this issue to the district court. 34 F.4th 14.</p>\r\n<p>On August 19, 2022, the district court denied without prejudice the parties&rsquo; renewed motions for summary judgment to give the parties the opportunity to file renewed cross motions for summary judgment that account for the D.C. Circuit&rsquo;s decision. The plaintiff and defendant filed their renewed cross-motions for summary judgment on September 30, 2022 and November 29, 2022, respectively. As of March 29, 2024, the court&rsquo;s ruling on these motions is still pending and the case is still ongoing.</p>",

MSJ), and CLC has cross-moved for \nsummary judgment (ECF No. 24, Pl. MSJ).  For the reasons set forth below, the court will grant in \npart and deny in part DOJโs Motion for Summary Judgment and grant in part and deny in part \nCLCโs Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.1 \nI.  BACKGROUND \nWilbur Ross became Secretary of the Department of Commerce on February 28, 2017.  \nRoughly two months later, he emailed a subordinate, Earl Comstock, stating: โI am mystified why \nnothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship \nquestion. Why not?โ  (ECF No. 24-5, 5/2/17 Email at 2.)  Ross was referring to his request to add a \n \n1 Due to overlapping facts and claims between this case and another case before this court, \nCampaign Legal Center v. DOJ, No. 18-cv-1187, portions of this opinion are identical to language \nin the summary judgment opinion in that case.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 2 of 27\nquestion about citizenship status to the 2020 Census Questionnaire.  Comstock replied the same \nday: โI agree Mr. Secretary . . . We need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship \nbe added back as a census question, and we have the court cases to illustrate that DoJ has a \nlegitimate need for the question to be included.  I will arrange a meeting with DoJ staff this week to \ndiscuss.โ  (5/2/17 Email at 2.)   \nSecretary Ross followed up that August: โwhere is the DoJ in their analysis? If they still \nhave not come to a conclusion please let me know your contact person and I will call the AG.โ  \n(ECF No. 24-6, Pl. Exh. 5 at 2.)  A month later, on Friday September 8, 2017, Comstock sent \nSecretary Ross a memo stating:  \nI spoke several times with James McHenry [DOJ] by phone, and after considering \nthe  matter  further  James  said  that  Justice  staff  did  not  want  to  raise  the \nquestion . . . James directed me to Gene Hamilton at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.  Gene and I had several phone calls to discuss the matter, and then Gene \nrelayed  that  after  discussion  DHS  really  felt  []  it  was  best  handled  by  the \nDepartment of Justice.  At that point the conversation ceased and I asked James \nUthmeier [OGC at Commerce] to look into the legal issues and how Commerce \ncould add the question to the Census itself. \n \n   (ECF No. 24-7, Pl. Exh. 6 at 2).  The record indicates that Secretary Ross contacted then-\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions that same Friday, because the following Monday, Arthur Gary, the \nGeneral Counsel for DOJโs Justice Management Division, emailed John Gore, a Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General: โ[Assistant Attorney General for Administration] Lee Lofthus has asked me to \nreach out to you to find out if you and/or [the Civil Rights Division] have any background \ninformation regarding some concerns raised that the Secretary of Commerce raised last week with \nthe AG relating to the 2020 Census.  I understand the concerns relate to potential questions relating \nto citizenship . . .โ  (ECF No. 27-2, Pl. Exh. A at 3.)   \nThe record further suggests that Attorney General Sessions quickly agreed to request the \ncitizenship question.  Later that week, Gore connected via email a DOJ employee and a Department \nof Commerce employee to coordinate a call between Sessions and Ross.  (ECF No. 24-8, Pl. Exh. 7 \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 3 of 27\nat 2.)  In the correspondence preceding the call, the DOJ employee wrote: โ[f]rom what John [Gore] \ntold me, it sounds like we can do whatever you all need us to do and the delay was due to a \nmiscommunication. The AG is eager to assist.โ  (Id.)  A call between Sessions and Ross occurred \nthat dayโSeptember 17, 2017.  (Id.)  With the Attorney General on board, the drafting process \ncommenced, including the following steps: \nโข  November 1, 2017:  Gore emailed Chris Herren (Voting Section Chief) asking for \ncomments and edits on a draft letter.  (ECF No. 22-6, Def. Exh. E at 76.)  \nโข  November 3, 2:05 p.m.: Herren responded: โsome comments from me are included in \nthe attached.โ  (Id.) \nโข  November 3, 5:10 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โthe draft letter that we discussed earlier \nthis week is attached. Letโs touch base early next week once youโve had a chance to \nreview it.โ  (ECF No. 22-6, Def. Exh. G at 93.) \nโข  November 3, 5:35 p.m.: Bethany Pickett (Civil Rights Division) emailed Gore: โIโve \nattached the letter that we discussed yesterday.  I would be happy to discuss this \nfurther. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments and \nedits.โ  (Def. Exh. E at 75.) \nโข  November 22: Gary replied to Gore with a revised draft.  (Def. Exh. G at 101.) \nโข  November 25: Gore replied, writing that he โfound a few nits.โ  (Id.)  \nโข  November 27, 12:43 p.m.: Gore emailed Rachael Tucker and Robert Troester (both \nat DOJ): โAttached please find the near-final draft of the letter to Census.โ  (Id. at \n142.)  \nโข  November 27, 1:25 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โ[a] couple more nits in the attached.โ  \n(Def. Exh. E at 38.) \nโข  November 30, 4:21 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โI have received some nits back from \nthe leadership offices, which are reflected in the attached redline and clean versions.โ  \n(Def. Exh. G at 104.) \nโข  December 8, 3:14 p.m.: Tucker emailed Gore: โIโm working to review this quickly. \nWill be back in touch shortly.โ  (ECF No. 22-7 at 102.) \nโข  December 8, 3:57 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โAttached is a redline of the letter . . . \nWith these changes, we are authorized to send.โ  (ECF No. 22-6, Def. Exh. E at 52.)  \n \nWith the letter complete, Gary mailed and faxed it (the โGary Letterโ) to Dr. Ron Jarmin of \nthe U.S. Census Bureau on December 12, 2017.  (Id. at 57.)  In March 2018, Secretary Ross \nannounced Commerceโs intention to add the citizenship question, writing that โ[f]ollowing receipt \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 4 of 27\nof the DOJ request, I set out to take a hard look at the request and ensure that I considered all facts \nand data relevant to the question . . .โ  (ECF No. 24-2, Pl. Exh. 1 at 2.)    \nIn June of that year, Secretary Ross clarified, in a supplemental memorandum, that he had \nhad the idea before DOJโs request, and that he had in fact asked DOJ to make the request: โmy staff \nand I consulted with Federal government components and inquired whether [DOJ] would support, \nand if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question as consistent with and useful for \nenforcement of the Voting Rights Act.โ  (ECF No. 24-4, Pl. Exh. 3 at 2.)  This supplemental \nmemorandum indicates that not only did Commerce ask DOJ to make the request, it further \nsupplied DOJ with the rationale for the request.  (Id.)  By the time Attorney General Sessions \nagreed to make the request, all DOJ had to do was draft and send it.   \nA.  CLCโs FOIA Request \nOn February 1, 2018 CLC submitted a FOIA request to three DOJ components: the Civil \nRights Division (CRT), the Justice Management Division (JMD), and the Office of the Attorney \nGeneral (OAG).  (ECF No. 22-6, Exh. A (FOIA Request) at 3.)  CLC asked DOJ to search for \nโ[a]ny documents to, from, or mentioning Dr. Ron Jarmin or Dr. Enrique Lamasโ and to use eight \nsearch terms: โ2020 Censusโ, โlong formโ, โcitizenship questionโ, โquestion regarding citizenshipโ, \nโACSโ, โAmerican Community Surveyโ, โcitizen voting age populationโ, and โCVAPโ.  (Id.)   \nB.  DOJ Component Responses to FOIA Request \n1.  CRT \nCRT searched for responsive documents in the Voting Section and at the Office of the \nAssistant Attorney General (OAAG).  (ECF No. 22-5, Cooper Decl. ยถยถ 4โ10.)  Senior staff in the \nVoting Section determined that all responsive records would be found in Chris Herrenโs Outlook \naccount; Herren searched his account and located responsive documents.  (Id. ยถ 6.)  At the OAAG, \nthe Director of Operational Management determined that Gore โwas the only OAAG employee who \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 5 of 27\nhad a substantive role in the preparation of the Gary Census letter.โ  (Id. ยถ 9.)  Goreโs Outlook \naccount was first searched using the term โcensus,โ and later searched for emails on which Gary and \nPickett were addressees.  (Id. ยถยถ 9, 12.)  On August 2, 2018, CRT conducted another search for \nโhandwritten notes, drafts, or other hard copy documents.โ  (Id. ยถ 14.)    \nOn September 26 and November 19, 2018, CRT released sixty-nine pages in full or in part, \nand withheld forty-two pages in full, pursuant to Exemption 5 and 6.  (Id. ยถยถ 16, 17.)  On May 8, \n2018, CRT released an additional 114 pages of hard documents that were โinadvertently \noverlookedโ from its earlier response.  (Id. ยถยถ 17, 18.)  \nCRT also processed a referral of sixteen pages from the Office of Information Policy (OIP), \nreleasing twelve pages in their entirety, withholding two in full under Exemption 5, and referring \ntwo pages to the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), which released them to CLC.  (Id. ยถยถ 19, 20.)  \n2.  OAG/OIP \nOIP is responsible for processing FOIA requests submitted to OAG.  (ECF No. 22-4, \nBrinkmann Decl. ยถ 1.)  In response to CLCโs request, OIP used all of CLCโs suggested search terms \nto search the โunclassified email records and computer hard drivesโ of ten records custodians.  (Id. \nยถยถ 14โ16.)  In light of the large number of potentially responsive records, CLC and OIP agreed to \nexclude various categories of records from the request.  (Id. ยถ 18.)  On March 29, 2019, OIP \ninformed CLC that it had located 219 pages of responsive records.  (ECF No. 22-4, Def. Exh. D at \n37.)  OIP also processed seventy pages referred by JMD.  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 19.)  Of those \ncombined 289 pages, 91 were withheld in full and 21 withheld in part pursuant to Exemption 5.  \n(Id.) \n3.  JMD \nArthur Gary, JMDโs General Counsel, conducted a โmanual search of his emails for \nresponsive records, using the search terms listed in the request.โ  (ECF No. 22-3, Allen Decl. ยถ 7.)  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 6 of 27\nOfficials familiar with the matter determined that no other employee would have non-duplicative \nresponsive material.  (Id.)  JMD released 116 pages with some redactions under Exemptions 5 and 6 \nand withheld in full five draft letters attached to responsive emails.  (Id. ยถ 9.)   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is proper where the record shows there is no genuine issue of material \nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Waterhouse v. District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989, 991 (D.C. \nCir. 2002).  โA fact is โmaterialโ if a dispute over it might affect the outcome of a suit under \ngoverning law; factual disputes that are โirrelevant or unnecessaryโ do not affect the summary \njudgment determination.โ  Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  โAn issue is โgenuineโ if โthe evidence is \nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โโ  Holcomb, 433 F.3d at \n895.  Courts must view โthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant[ ] and draw[ ] \nall reasonable inferences accordingly,โ and determine whether a โreasonable jury could reach a \nverdictโ in the non-movantโs favor.  Lopez v. Council on Am.โIslamic Relations Action Network, \nInc., 826 F.3d 492, 496 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nB.  FOIA \nFOIA cases are typically decided on motions for summary judgment.  Brayton v. Office of \nthe U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  โFOIA provides a โstatutory right of \npublic access to documents and recordsโ held by federal government agencies.โ  Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Wash. (CREW) v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 602 F. Supp. 2d 121, 123 \n(D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Pratt v. Webster, 673 F.2d 408, 413 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  Federal agencies \nmust comply with requests and make their records available to the public unless such โinformation \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 7 of 27\nis exempted under [one of nine] clearly delineated statutory [exemptions].โ  CREW, 602 F. Supp. 2d \nat 123; see also 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 552(a)โ(b).  Summary judgment for the agency is only appropriate \nwhen an agency proves that it has fully discharged its FOIA obligations.  Moore v. Aspin, 916 F. \nSupp. 32, 35 (D.D.C. 1996).   \nIn cases challenging the applicability of certain FOIA exemptions, the district court conducts \na de novo review of the agencyโs decision to withhold requested documents under any \nof FOIAโs specific exemptions.  See id; 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  The burden is on the agency to \nshow that nondisclosed, requested material falls within a stated exemption.  See Petroleum Info. \nCorp. v. U.S. Depโt of Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1433 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing 5 U.S.C. \nยง 552(a)(4)(B)).  Agencies may rely on supporting declarations that are reasonably detailed and \nnon-conclusory.  See King v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 218 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (โaffidavits \ncannot support summary judgment if they are conclusory, merely reciting statutory standards, or if \nthey are too vague or sweeping.โ).  The declarations must provide enough information โto afford the \nFOIA requester a meaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court an adequate foundation to \nreview, the soundness of the withholding.โ  Id. at 218.  โIf an agencyโs affidavit describes the \njustifications for withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information \nwithheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence \nin the record or by evidence of the agencyโs bad faith, then summary judgment is warranted on the \nbasis of the affidavit alone.โ  ACLU v. U.S. Depโt of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(citations omitted).  A motion for summary judgment should be granted in favor of the FOIA \nrequester, however, where โan agency seeks to protect material which, even on the agencyโs version \nof the facts, falls outside the proffered exemption.โ  Coldiron v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 310 F. Supp. \n2d 44, 48 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting Petroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1433). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 8 of 27\nIn cases where the adequacy of a search is at issue, the agency โmust show beyond material \ndoubt [] that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.โ  \nWeisberg v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  The court employs a \nreasonableness test to determine whether an agencyโs search for responsive materials is adequate.  \nRodriguez v. Depโt of Def., 236 F. Supp. 3d 26, 34 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing Campbell v. U.S. Depโt of \nJustice, 164 F.3d 20, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  โ[T]he adequacy of a FOIA search is generally \ndetermined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry \nout the search.โ  Iturralde v. Comptroller of the Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  \nHowever, โevidence that relevant records have not been released may shed light on whether the \nagencyโs search was indeed adequate.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351.  The court must accord agency \naffidavits โa presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims \nabout the existence and discoverability of other documents.โ  Safecard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d \n1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โIt is well-establishedโ \nhowever โthat a conclusory affidavit that gives โno detail as to the scope of the examination . . . is \ninsufficient as a matter of lawโ in demonstrating the adequacy of the search.โ  Am.-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm. v. U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., 516 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2007) \n(quoting Weisberg v. U.S. DOJ, 627 F.2d 365, 370 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). \n \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nAlthough โa motion for summary judgment cannot be โconcededโ for want of opposition,โ \nWinston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016), โ[t]his does not mean . . . \nthat the Court must assess the legal sufficiency of each and every [claim] invoked by the \ngovernment in a FOIA case.โ  Shapiro v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 239 F. Supp. 3d 100, 106 n.1 \n(D.D.C. 2017).  Instead, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 9 of 27\n[w]here  the  FOIA  requester  responds  to  the  governmentโs  motion  for  summary \njudgment without taking issue with the governmentโs decision to withhold or to redact \nspecific documents, the Court can reasonably infer that the FOIA requester does not \nseek those specific records or information and that, as to those records or information, \nthere is no case or controversy sufficient to sustain the Courtโs jurisdiction. \n \nId; see Lujan v. Def. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Accordingly, the court will address only \nCLCโs arguments in response to DOJโs motion for summary judgment.   \nA.  CRT \nCLC alleges that CRT (1) conducted an inadequate search, and (2) improperly withheld \nresponsive records.  (Pl. MSJ at 12โ21, 27; ECF No. 27, Pl. Reply at 5โ12, 14.)   \n1.  CRTโs search was inadequate \n \nUnder FOIA, an adequate search is one that is โreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant \ndocuments.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351; see Oglesby v. Depโt of the Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. \nCir. 1990) (โ[T]he agency must show that it made a good faith effort to conduct a search for the \nrequested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information \nrequested.โ).   \nCLC requested โall records pertainingโ to the Gary letter, and as noted above, it \nrecommended eight search terms.  (Cooper Decl. ยถ 2.)  The details of CRTโs search are described \nmore fully above, (see supra Part I(A),(B)), but it is sufficient here to reiterate that CRTโs digital \nsearches used only the search term โcensusโ instead of any of the eight recommended by CLC.  \n(Cooper Decl. ยถยถ 6โ10.)  CRT claims that two of the eight recommended terms are too general, but \ndoes not address the other six.  (Id. ยถ 15.)   \nThis court is mindful that an agency has discretion in how it conducts a FOIA search, and \nthat โ[i]n general, a FOIA petitioner cannot dictate the search terms for his or her FOIA request.โ  \nBigwood v. U.S. Depโt of Def., 132 F. Supp. 3d 124, 140 (D.D.C. 2015).  But an agencyโs discretion \nโis not boundless; the search terms selected must pass muster under a standard of reasonableness.โ  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 10 of 27\nCoffey v. Bureau of Land Management, 249 F. Supp. 3d 488, 498 (D.D.C. 2017) (internal quotes \nomitted).  DOJโs use of a single search term for all the digital records does not pass muster under \nthat standard.  It is likely that responsive digital documents exist which do not have the word \nโcensusโ in them.  Thus, because only one search term was used, and that term was inadequate, the \nsearch was not โreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at \n1351.  As to this issue, the court will grant summary judgment for CLC.  \n2.  CRT improperly withheld records under the presidential communications privilege \n \nCRT withheld twenty-three pages of email correspondence between DOJ attorneys and \nWhite House staff under the presidential communications privilege, and thus under Exemption 5.2  \n(ECF. No. 22-8, CRT Vaughn Index, Group 7; 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(5).  The correspondence deals \nwith notifying Congress of DOJโs request for a census citizenship question.  (CRT Vaughn Index, \nGroup 7.)  Exemption 5 shields documents that would โnormally [be] privileged from discovery in \ncivil litigation against the agency,โ including documents protected by the presidential \ncommunications privilege.  Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  To withhold a \ndocument under Exemption 5, the โdocument must meet two conditions: its source must be a \nGovernment agency, and it must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial \nstandards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.โ  Stolt-Nielsen Transp. Grp. \nLtd. v. U.S., 534 F.3d 728, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThere is no dispute that the first condition is met here; the partiesโ dispute is directed to the second \ncondition. \nThe presidential communications privilege (and thus Exemption 5) protects \nโcommunications directly involving and documents actually viewed by the President, as well as \n \n2 OIP also withheld this set of emails under the deliberative process privilege, which is addressed \nbelow. (See infra Part III(A)(3).) \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 11 of 27\ndocuments solicited and received by the President or his immediate White House advisers [with] . . . \nbroad and significant responsibility for investigating and formulating the advice to be given the \nPresident.โ  Loving v. Depโt of Def., 550 F.3d 32, 37 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal quotations omitted) \n(alterations in original).  \nDOJ has not asserted sufficient facts to show that the documents at issue were protected by \nthe privilege.  (See Def. MSJ; ECF No. 26, Def. Reply; Cooper Decl.; CRT Vaughn Index; ECF No. \n26-2, 2d Cooper Decl.)  DOJ does not assert, for example, that the President was involved in the \ncommunications or that the President viewed any of the documents related to the communications, \nor that the communications related to advice to be given to the President.  (Id.)  \nAbsent these assertions, the privilege does not apply.  โThe presidential communications \nprivilege should never serve as a means of shielding information regarding governmental operations \nthat do not call ultimately for direct decisionmaking by the President.โ  In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d \n729, 752 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  DOJ does describe the communications as a โsubject of potential \npresidential decisionmakingโ (Def. Reply at 19), but does not state that the President actually did \nmake the decision or that the communications were โmade by presidential advisers in the course of \npreparing advice for the President.โ  Judicial Watch, Inc. v. United States Depโt of Def., 913 F.3d \n1106, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Accordingly, the presidential communications privilege does not \napply, and summary judgment will be granted for CLC as to the withholding of this material under \nthis privilege.  \n \n3.  CRTโs withholdings under the deliberative process privilege \n \nCLC contests all of CRTโs withholdings pursuant to the deliberative process privilege under \nExemption 5.3  (Pl. MSJ at 12, 16.)  The deliberative process privilege protects materials that are \n \n3 DOJ argues that this court should grant summary judgment in favor of DOJ as to some of the \ndocuments because CLC does not address each document individually.  (Def. Reply at 5.)  Though \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 12 of 27\nโpredecisionalโ and โdeliberative.โ  Mapother v. Depโt of Justice, 3 F.3d 1533, 1537 (D.C. Cir. \n1993).  The court will address the withholdings under this privilege in five groups: (i) the drafts and \nemail correspondence related to the Gary Letter, (ii) the 2016 memoranda from CRT to JMD, (iii) \nthe email thread between DOJ and the White House, and (iv) the memorandum from Uthmeier to \nGore.  \ni.  Drafts and email correspondence related to the Gary Letter \nUnder the deliberative process privilege, CRT withheld drafts of the Gary Letter as well as \nportions of emails discussing the drafts.  (CRT Vaughn Index, Group 1, 3, 4, 8.)  The critical issue is \nwhether the documents are โpredecisional.โ  Mapother, 3 F.3d at 1537.   Documents are \npredecisional if they were โprepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving at his \ndecision, rather than to support a decision already made.โ  Petroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1434 \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   \nCLC argues that none of the documents are predecisional because they were created after \nCommerce decided to add the citizenship question to the Census and after DOJ decided to issue the \nletter requesting that question.  (Pl. MSJ at 14โ17.)  Defendant does not dispute this timeline, but \nargues that the documents are predecisional because they were created before the letter was \nfinalized.  (Def. MSJ at 10โ11.)  The parties thus agree on the sequence of events, but disagree \nabout what constitutes the relevant agency decision: the decision to write the letter, or the decision \nabout the letterโs final contents.   \nThe inquiry can be circular.  Indeed, every draft postdates the decision to write it, and \nsimultaneously predates the decision of what to include in it.  Such is the case here: the drafting \n \nit is true that CLCโs arguments are tailored to certain document categories, that does not undermine \nthe fact that CLC explicitly contests all the withholdings.  (Pl. MSJ at 12.) (โDOJ has not met its \nburden with respect to materials it claims are protected by the deliberative process privilege because \nit has not shown that the withheld materials are predecisional and deliberative in nature.โ). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 13 of 27\nprocess postdated Attorney General Sessionโs decision to issue the letter, but undeniably predated \nthe decision about the final contents of the letter.  In this regard, Plaintiff and Defendant are both \nright: the disputed materials are predecisional, but they are also postdecisional.  The ultimate \nquestion is what constitutes the relevant decision for Exemption 5.  \nAs Wright & Miller have observed, โ[d]efining โdecisionโ for purposes of the privilege is no \neasy task.โ  26A Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed. Practice & Procedure ยง 5680 (1st ed. 1992). \nThough there is no well-established test for identifying the relevant decision, cases in this Circuit do \nprovide some guidance.  First, they suggest that the relevant decision in any given case is one that \ninvolves discretion about what an agency position or agency policy should be.4  The D.C. Circuit \nhas held, for example, that documents did not fall under Exemption 5 because they โwere not \nsuggestions or recommendations as to what agency policy should be.โ  Coastal States Gas Corp. v. \nDepโt of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (emphasis added).  The Court later elaborated \non this principle: \nTo  fall  within  the  deliberative  process  privilege,  materials  must  bear  on  the \nformulation or exercise of agency policy-oriented judgment . . . [W]hen material \ncould not reasonably be said to reveal an agencyโs or officialโs mode of formulating \nor exercising policy-implicating judgment, the deliberative process privilege is \ninapplicable. \n \n Petroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1435 (D.C. Cir. 1992).   \nConsistent with this language, this Circuit has held that drafts showing the exercise of \nโagency policy-oriented judgmentโ are in fact predecisional.  See Natโl Assโn of Home Builders v. \nNorton, 309 F.3d 26, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  In Dudman Commcโns Corp. v. Depโt of Air Force, 815 \n \n4 This does not mean that a relevant agency decision must involve a formal policy.  See Gold Anti-\nTrust Action Comm., Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 762 F. Supp. 2d 123, 135-36 \n(D.D.C. 2011) (โeven if an internal discussion does not lead to the adoption of a specific \ngovernment policy, its protection under Exemption 5 is not foreclosed as long as the document was \ngenerated as part of a definable decision-making process.โ) (citing Petroleum Info. Corp. v. U.S. \nDepโt of the Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992).    \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 14 of 27\nF.2d 1565, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the D.C. Circuit withheld a preliminary draft of a historical work \npublished by the Air Force about operations in South Vietnam between 1961 and 1964.  The \ndrafting process involved decisions about the agencyโs historical conclusions and representations to \nthe public.  Id. at 1566.  In Radiation Sterilizers, Inc. v. U.S. Depโt of Energy, No. 90-880, 1991 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 4669 (D.D.C. Apr. 9, 1991), the Court withheld documents from a drafting \nprocess that determined what data and conclusions should be included in an interim report to \nCongress about a chemical leak.  Likewise, in Brown v. Dept. of State, 317 F. Supp. 3d 370, 370 \n(D.D.C. 2018), the court withheld documents produced in preparation for court filings and for a \nletter to Congress.   \nThe facts of this case are significantly different.  The letter at issue did not involve discretion \nabout an agency position or about the primary reasons for the agency position.  The agencyโs \nposition and the reasons for the letter had already been decided.  Thus, the drafting did not \ndemonstrate โthe process by which policy is formulated,โ nor could it โreasonably be said to reveal \nan agencyโs or officialโs mode of formulating or exercising policy-implicating judgment.โ  \nPetroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992).   \nMoreover, Gary and Gore were not drafting the document so that a supervisor or colleague \ncould decide a particular issue.  In Coastal States, the D.C. Circuit held that โa document from a \nsubordinate to a superior official is more likely to be predecisional.โ  617 F.2d at 868.  This is \nbecause such documents generally aid in the decisionmaking process about an agencyโs position.  \nThus, in Access Reports v. Depโt of Justice, the D.C. Circuit upheld withholding a document that a \nlow-level employee created for supervisors who had asked for research on a particular issue.  926 \nF.2d 1192, 1196-97 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  Such documents are quintessentially predecisionalโthey are \ncreated to help the agency make a decision.  See Krikorian v. Dept. of State, 984 F.2d 461, 466 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (withholding a document from subordinates to supervisors that proposed two \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 15 of 27\noptions for how to respond to public inquiries about a recent agency decision regarding a genocide); \nUnited Am. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, 531 F. Supp. 2d 29, 44 (D.D.C. 2008) (withholding investigative \nnotes that were provided to an office to assist it in writing a report to employees about identity theft \nagainst the agency); Blank Rome LLP v. Depโt of the Air Force, No. 15-cv-1200 (RCL), 2016 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 128209, at *14, *35 (D.D.C. Sept. 20, 2016) (withholding draft documents that \nassisted the Air Force in coming to a decision regarding a settlement proposal).   \nHere, the contested documents do not fit that mold.  They were not used to help the agency \nmake a decision, but rather were used to communicate the decision.5  If the materials in question \nwere drafts of documents that Gore and Gary prepared for Attorney General Sessions before he \ndecided to request the citizenship question, they would be squarely predecisional.  But that was not \ntheir purpose.  While Gore did email the draft to supervisors before it was sent to the Census \nBureau, it is telling that in the email he wrote that he was sending them a โnear-finalโ draft.  (Def. \nExh. G at 142.)  In other words, the draft was not provided to supervisors to help them make a \ndecision.  The decision had already been made, and the supervisors were reviewing Goreโs \nimplementation of it.  (See id.)  \nThe court is mindful of the D.C. Circuitโs directive that Exemption 5 should be construed \nnarrowly.  โIn light of the FOIAโs strong policy in favor of disclosure . . . Exemption 5 is to be \nconstrued as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government operation.โ  Petroleum Info. Corp., \n \n5 Decisions about how to message agency policy to the public can be predecisional.  See Hooker v. \nHHS, 887 F. Supp. 2d. 40, 40 (D.D.C. 2012) (withholding drafts of a publication about vaccine \nsafety);  Hunton & Williams LLP v. U.S. EPA, Civ. A. No. 15-1203, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166174 \nat *9 (D.D.C. Sept. 27, 2018) (withholding drafts of letters to non-profits and emails discussing \ncommunications strategy); Sierra Club v. U.S. Depโt of Interior, 384 F. Supp. 2d 1, 20 (D.D.C. \n2004) (withholding documents related to the agencyโs response to a congressional inquiry.)  In fact, \na court recently held that the contested documents in this case constituted โmessaging.โ  See New \nYork v. U.S. Depโt of Commerce, Civ. A. No. 18-2921, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1772468 at *20 \n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2018). These cases are inapplicable here because DOJ concedes that the withheld \nmaterials are not messaging documents.  (Def. Reply at 13 n.8.)  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 16 of 27\n976 F.2d at 1434 (internal quotations omitted); see also Wolfe v. Depโt of Health and Human Servs., \n839 F.2d 768, 773 (D.C. Cir 1988).  Consequently, the court finds that the relevant decision for \npurposes of Exemption 5 is the one made by Attorney General Sessions to request the citizenship \nquestion, not the decision about the final contents of the letter.  The emails sent and the drafts \nwritten after that decision are thus not predecisional and cannot be withheld under Exemption 5.  \nBecause the documents are not predecisional, the court need not decide whether they are \ndeliberative, and will grant summary judgment for CLC as to the Exemption 5 withholdings of \nthese documents (CRT Vaughn Index, Groups 1, 3, 4, 8). \nii.  2016 memoranda sent from CRT to JMD \nCRT withheld two memoranda it sent to the Justice Management Division in 2016, citing \nthe deliberative process privilege.  (CRT Vaughn Index, Group 5.)  The memoranda contain \nrecommendations for new census questions.  (Id.)  Though CLC generally contests all withholdings \nunder the deliberative process privilege, it advances no specific arguments as to why the privilege \ndoes not cover these memoranda.  The court agrees with DOJ that โthese two memoranda are \npredecisional because they were drafted before JMD made any decisions concerning whether to \nsuggest new questions to the U.S. Census Bureau.โ  (Cooper Decl. ยถ 27; Def. MSJ at 11.)  Further, \nthe documents are deliberative because they are โa part of the agency give-and-take of the \ndeliberative process by which the decision itself is made.โ  Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.3d 1136, 1144 \n(D.C. Cir. 1975).  Because the material is predecisional and deliberative, the deliberative process \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 17 of 27\nprivilege applies, and the court will grant summary judgment for DOJ as to these documents (CRT \nVaughn Index, Group 5). \niii.  DOJ-White House email thread \nIn addition to withholding these documents under the presidential communications privilege \n(which the court has found to be inapplicable), CRT also invokes the deliberative process privilege.6  \nAt this point, however, the court is unable to rule on whether the deliberative process privilege \napplies because DOJ does not specify what portions of the records are covered by it.  While the \nVaughn Index states that the documents are โwithheld in full pursuant to Exemption 5 (DPP),โ \nDOJโs Reply brief asserts the documents are only โpartially protected by the deliberative process \nprivilege.โ  (CRT Vaughn Index, Group 7; Def. Reply at 20.)  Further, in discussing this material, \nthe OIP Declaration acknowledges that DOJ has apparently not decided what portions may be \nprotected.  (Brinkmann Decl., ยถ 28) (describing the documents as โpartially or fully protected by the \ndeliberative process privilege.โ). \nBecause the court has determined that the presidential process privilege is inapplicable, DOJ \nmust decide what portions of the responsive documents are covered by the deliberative process \nprivilege.  Once it does, DOJ has a duty to segregate and produce any portions not covered by \nExemption 5.  5 U.S.C. ยง 522(b) (โAny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided \nto any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this \nsubsection.โ).  Accordingly, the court will deny summary judgment for both DOJ and CLC as to the \n \n6 The documents consist of twenty-three pages of email correspondence between DOJ attorneys and \nWhite House staff related to Congressional notification about the citizenship question.  (CRT \nVaughn Index, Group 7). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 18 of 27\napplicability of the deliberative process privilege to these records and order DOJ to make that \ndetermination.  \niv.  Memorandum from Uthmeier to Gore \nCiting the deliberative process, the attorney work product, and the attorney client privileges, \nCRT withheld a handwritten cover note and memorandum from โJanes [sic] Uthmeierโ to John \nGore.  (CRT Vaughn Index, Group 6; Cooper Decl. ยถ 28.)  Both documents are undated, but CRT \nasserts that Gore received them in 2017.  (2d Cooper Decl. ยถ 3(c).)  While CLC challenges all \nwithholdings under the deliberative process privilege, CLC does not challenge withholding this \nmaterial under the attorney work product privilege or the attorney client privilege.  (Pl. MSJ at 14, \n21โ23.)  Therefore, the material is exempt from disclosure and the court need not consider whether \nthe deliberative process privilege also applies.  Summary judgment will be granted for DOJ as to \nthis material.   \n \nB.  OIP \nCLC argues that OIP improperly withheld material under the (1) presidential \ncommunications privilege, (2) attorney work product privilege, and (3) deliberative process \nprivilege.  (Pl. MSJ at 12โ13, 20โ23.) \n1.  Presidential communications privilege \n \nLike CRT, OIP invokes the presidential communications privilege for email exchanges \nbetween DOJ and the White House.  (See Def. Reply at 20 n.11.)  The court determined that, for \nCRT, the privilege does not apply, and its reasoning applies to OIP as well.  (See infra Part \nIII(B)(3)(ii).)  DOJ does not claim that the President was or would be involved in the subject of \ncommunication.  See Loving, 550 F.3d at 37.  While the OIP declaration is more thorough than \nCRTโs (for example, it contends that the subject of communication is one of โpresidential concern \nand decisionโ), it still falls short of asserting that the President was actually involved or would be \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 19 of 27\ninvolved in this decision in any capacity.  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 28.)  The court therefore holds that \nthe presidential communications privilege does not shield these documents.7   \n \n2.  Attorney work product privilege \n \nCiting the attorney work product privilege, OIP withheld 24 pages of draft responses to \ninterrogatories from the United States Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR).  (ECF No. 22-4, Def. \nExh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, at 45.)  The attorney work product privilege, under Exemption 5, \nprotects material that can โfairly be said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect \nof litigation.โ  In re Sealed Case, 146 F. 3d 881, 884 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  The D.C. Circuit has โlong \nrequired a case-specific determinationโ for whether the privilege applies.  Natโl Assโn of Criminal \nDef. Lawyers v. Depโt of Justice Exec. Office for U.S. Attorneys, 844 F.3d 246, 251 (D.C. Cir. \n2016).  That determination requires a โbecause-ofโ test: whether, โin light of the nature of the \ndocument and the factual situation in the particular case,โ the document was prepared or obtained \nโbecause of the prospect of litigation.โ  United States v. Deloitte LLP, 610 F.3d 129, 137 (D.C. Cir. \n2010) (internal quotations omitted.).  \nDOJ does not contend that the Commissionโs request itself constitutes litigation, but rather \nthat the request put OIP in reasonable anticipation of future litigation.  (Def. Reply at 17โ19; Def. \nMSJ at 12โ13; Brinkmann Declaration ยถ 35.)  According to DOJ, โgiven that citizen complaints \nalleging discrimination often prompt Commission investigations, it is reasonable for a party \nreceiving interrogatories from the Commission to anticipate that . . . the matter in question might \nlead to litigation . . .โ  (Def. Reply at 18.)   \n \n7 The court will address below whether the deliberative process privilege also applies to this \nmaterial.  (See infra Part III(B)(3)(ii).) \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 20 of 27\nEven if this is true, however, it does not follow that the interrogatory responses were created \nโbecause ofโ litigation.  See Deloitte LLP, 610 F.3d at 137.  Absent an assertion to the contrary, it \nappears that OIP would have responded to the interrogatories regardless of whether it thought \nlitigation would ensue.  (See Def. Reply.)  The court agrees with CLC that the draft responses were \ncreated โnot because of the prospect of litigation, but to provide informationโ to Congress.  (Pl. \nReply at 11.)  Because they were not prepared โbecause ofโ litigation, the attorney work product \nprivilege (and thus Exemption 5) does not apply to them.8   \n \n3.  Deliberative Process Privilege \n \nCLC contests all OIP withholdings under the deliberative process privilege.  (Pl. MSJ at 12.)  \nThe withholdings will be addressed in the following groups: (i) Gary Letter drafts and emails, (ii) \nDOJ-White House Correspondence, (iii) draft USCCR Interrogatories, (iv) press inquiries, and (iv) \nremaining withholdings that lack sufficient explanation.  \ni.  Gary Letter drafts and emails \n \nFor the reasons stated above regarding CRTโs withholding of the Gary Letter draft \ndocuments, the deliberative privilege is also inapplicable to OIPโs withholding of those documents.  \n(See infra Part III(B)(3)(v).)  Accordingly, the court will grant summary judgment for CLC and \norder DOJ to release the documents identified in the OIP Vaughn index with Bates numbers OIP \n107-109; OIP-116โ119; OIP-122โ124, and OIP-127.  \n \nii.  DOJ-White House Correspondence \n \nOIP claims the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege \ncovers this material. (Def. Exh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, at 46; Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 28, 29; ECF No. \n \n8 DOJโs argument that these documents are also exempt from disclosure under the deliberative \nprocess privilege will be addressed below. (See supra Part III(B)(3)(i)โ(iv).) \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 21 of 27\n26-1, 2d Brinkmann Decl., ยถ 9-15.)  As already discussed, however, DOJ does not specify which \nportions of the material are actually protected by the deliberative process privilege.  (See supra Part \nIII(A)(3)(ii).)  Accordingly, the court will deny summary judgment for both CLC and DOJ and \ndirect DOJ to indicate what material the privilege protects and to release the remainder to CLC.  \n \niii.  Draft USCCR Interrogatories  \n \nHaving determined that the attorney work product privilege does not apply to the draft \ninterrogatory responses, the court now addresses DOJโs assertion that the documents are also \nโprotected in their entiretiesโ by the deliberative process privilege.  (Brinkmann Decl. at 16 n.8; ยถ \n26; Def. Reply at 10.)  OIP contends that they are deliberative because they reflect โdeliberations \nregarding the content of documentsโ and they are pre-decisional because they โprecede the creation \nand/or transmission of final Department documents . . .โ  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ27.)  CLC argues that \nDOJ has not shown that the privilege applies because there is โno policy decision to which these \ndraft responses apply and therefore no applicable privilege.โ  (Pl. Reply at 11 n.9.)  \nThe court does not have enough information to determine whether the privilege applies.  It is \nundisputed that the drafts were created before being sent to the Commission, and that they reflect \ndeliberations about the contents of the documents.  (See Def. Exh. G. at 18โ76.)  But DOJ has not \ndisclosed what types of decisions were involved in drafting the interrogatory responses.  As a result, \nthe Court has no way of knowing whether the contents of these documents reflect โthe formulation \nor exercise of . . . policy-oriented judgment.โ  Prop. of the People, Inc. v. Office of Mgmt. and \nBudget, 330 F. Supp. 3d 373, 382 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Petroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1435).   \nโWhere an agency fails to meets its burden, FOIA provides courts โa host of proceduresโ to \ndetermine whether the exemption claim is proper, including discovery, further agency affidavits, \nand in camera review of the records in question.โ  Bloche v. Depโt of Def., 370 F. Supp. 3d 40, 55 \n(D.D.C. 2019) (quoting Allen v. CIA, 636 F.2d 1287, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).  Here, the court will \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 22 of 27\ndirect DOJ to provide further declarations, and will deny both partiesโ motions for summary \njudgment on this issue.  \niv.  Press inquiries \n \nCiting the deliberative process privilege, OIP withheld three pages of โinternal emails \namong DOJ staff containing deliberations about how to respond to press inquiries.โ  (Brinkmann \nDecl. ยถ 30; Def. Exh. 5, OIP Vaughn Index, documents identified as JMD 63, 67โ68.)  DOJ relies \non Competitive Enter. Inst. v. EPA, 232 F. Supp. 3d 172, 187-88 (D.D.C. 2017), which held that \nโ[e]mails โgenerated as part of a continuous process of agency decision-making regarding how to \nrespond toโ a press inquiry are protected by the deliberative process privilege.โ  Id.  (quoting \nJudicial Watch v. Depโt of Transport., 796 F. Supp. 2d 13, 31 (D.D.C. 2011).).  CLC, while \ngenerally contesting all deliberative process privilege withholdings, does not advance any specific \narguments regarding these documents.  \nThe D.C. Circuit has not addressed whether the deliberative process privilege applies to \nresponses to press inquiries, but numerous trial courts in this District have held that it does.  See, \ne.g., Gellman v. Depโt of Homeland Sec., No. 16CV635, 2020 WL 1323896, at *12 (D.D.C. Mar. \n20, 2020) (โthe overwhelming consensus among courts in this District is that discussions about how \nto respond to the press are protected by this privilege.โ) (internal quotations omitted); American \nCenter for Law & Justice v. U.S. Depโt of State, 330 F. Supp. 3d 293, 302 (D.D.C. 2018) (โthe \ndeliberative process privilege applies to documents generated in the crafting of an agencyโs public \nstatementsโ); Comm. on Oversight & Govโt Reform v. Lynch, 156 F. Supp. 3d 101, 111-12 (D.D.C. \n2016) (privilege covers deliberations about how to respond to press inquiries regarding a law \nenforcement initiative). \nThis court finds the reasoning of other courts in this District on this issue to be persuasive.  \nThe documents are pre-decisional because they were created before the agency responded to a press \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 23 of 27\ninquiry, and they are deliberative because they are โa part of the agency give-and-take of the \ndeliberative process by which the decision itself is made.โ  Vaughn, 523 F.3d at 1144.  Accordingly, \nthe deliberative process privilege applies and the court will grant summary judgment for DOJ as to \nthese documents.  (Def. Exh. D, OIP Vaughn Index, documents identified as JMD 63, 67โ68.) \nv.  Withholdings lacking sufficient explanation. \n \nโAffidavits submitted by a governmental agency in justification for its exemption claims \nmust . . . enable โthe District Court to make a rational decision whether the withheld material must \nbe produced . . .โโ  King v.

Cir. 1980).  โ[T]he need for a detailed description โis \nof particular importance . . . where the agency is claiming that the documents are protected by the \ndeliberative process privilege under Exemption 5.โโ  People for the Am.

Supp. 2d 105, 108 n.1 (D.D.C. 2005). โTo accept an inadequately supported exemption claim \nโwould constitute an abandonment of the trial courtโs obligation under the FOIA to conduct a de \nnovo review.โโ  King, 830 F.2d at 219 (quoting Allen, 636 F.2d at 1293).  \nThe court finds that OIP has not provided enough information for the court to determine \nwhether the privilege applies to several of the documents or portions thereof.  The first is described \nin the Vaughn Index as โDraft Correspondence between JMD and Department of Commerce.โ  \n(Def. Exh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, final version released under โJMD-5.โ)  The Brinkmann \nDeclaration states only that the documents โconsist of draft versions of Department correspondence \nwith Congress or other federal agencies.โ  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 26.)  A second document is \ndescribed in the Vaughn index as โDraft Correspondence with Representative Gonzalez.โ  (Def. \nExh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, final version released under โOIP 2-3.โ)  Here too, the only additional \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 24 of 27\ninformation is that it โconsist[s] of draft versions of Department correspondence with Congress or \nother federal agencies.โ  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 26.)    \nTwo more documents withheld in part are described in the Vaughn Index as โDeliberative \nDiscussions Regarding Inter-agency Correspondence.โ  (Def. Exh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, OIP 105, \n113.)  One is dated December 19, 2017, and the other December 12, 2017 (the day the Gary Letter \nwas sent to Commerce).  (ECF No. 22-2, Def. SOF, ยถ 46.)  The Brinkmann Declaration asserts \ngenerally that these documents โconsist of internal emails among DOJ staff providing advice and \nrecommendations regarding a particular piece of correspondence with another agency.โ  \n(Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 30.)  Another document is described as โDeliberative Discussions Regarding \nCongressional Correspondence.โ (Def. Exh. F., OIP Vaughn Index, JMD 23.)  The Brinkmann \nDeclaration explains that this document โconsist[s] of internal discussions among DOJ staff \nregarding an inquiry from Congress.โ  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 30.)   \nOIP also withheld three pages described as โdeliberative discussions regarding the drafting \nprocessโ but does not describe what is being drafted.  (Def. Exh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, JMD 39, \nOIP 101โ103.)  The Vaughn Index does include the subject line of these emails (โRE: Letter in \nResponse to Census Bureau Letter Re: Citizenship on 2020 censusโ and โRe: APPROVAL: \nStatement in Response to Citizenship Question on Censusโ), but that is not enough for the court to \nunderstand the nature of the letters or statements being drafted.  (Id.)  OIP also withheld three pages \nin part described as โDeliberative Discussions Regarding the Census and/or ACS.โ  (Def. Exh. F, \nOIP Vaughn Index, JMD 2โ3, 7.)  The Brinkmann Declaration adds that these pages โconsist of \ninternal emails among DOJ staff reflecting advice, preliminary research, and opinions, and analysis \nregarding the census or American Community Survey.โ  (Brinkmann Decl. ยถ 30.)  They are dated \nMarch 6 and 7, 2017.  (Def. Exh. F, OIP Vaughn Index, JMD 2โ3, 7.)  There is no information \nprovided as to whether the โresearchโ is general, or if this communication is aimed at a decision, \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 25 of 27\nsuch as whether census questions should be added, as was the case in CRTโs withheld memoranda \nabout the census.  (See supra Part III(B)(3)(v).) \nThe court lacks the information necessary to determine whether the privilege applies to any \nof these documents.  It is not enough to say that something is a draft or to say that it was \ndeliberative; more information is needed.  Judicial Watch. Inc. v. U.S. Postal Service, 297 F. Supp. \n2d 252, 261 (D.D.C. 2004) (โ[D]rafts are not presumptively privileged.โ)  Summary judgment will \nthus be denied as to these documents for both DOJ and CLC.  \n \nC.  JMD \nCLC alleges that JMD conducted an inadequate search and improperly withheld responsive \nrecords.  (Pl. MSJ at 25, 26.) \n1.  JMDโs search was adequate \n \nUnder FOIA, an adequate search is โreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant \ndocuments.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351; see Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68 (โ[T]he agency must show \nthat it made a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods which \ncan be reasonably expected to produce the information requested.โ).  As noted above, JMDโs \nGeneral Counsel, Arthur Gary, conducted a โmanual search of his emails for responsive records, \nusing the search terms listed in the request.โ  (Allen Decl. ยถ 7.)  Officials familiar with the matter \ndetermined that no other employee would have non-duplicative responsive material.  (Id.)   \nCLC argues that JMD should have also searched for paper and electronic records, such as \nword documents saved to Garyโs computer.  (Pl. MSJ at 26.)  It also contends that Garyโs manual \nsearch of his own documents is unreliable.  (Pl. Reply at 13.)  DOJ rests on its supporting \ndeclaration, stating that โit was determined that no other custodians would have responsive material \nthat would not already be captured by the search of Mr. Garyโs email.โ  (Allen Decl. ยถ 7.)   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 26 of 27\nJMDโs search may have been limited in scope, but there is no evidence to suggest that it was \ninadequate.  Individuals with knowledge of the process determined where the records would be \nfound, and JMD used all CLCโs requested search terms to search that source.  The court concludes \nthat JMD โmade a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records, using methods \nwhich can be reasonably expected to produce the information requested.โ  Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68.  \nAs to this issue, summary judgment will be granted for DOJ.  \n \n2.  JMDโs withholdings under the Deliberative Process Privilege \n \nInvoking the deliberative process privilege, JMD withheld in full or in part: (i) fourteen \npages of draft versions of the Gary Letter, (ii) one page of an unspecified โdraft response,โ and (iii) \none page of an email from Barry Robinson to Arthur Gary.  (Allen Decl. at 9.)  \ni.  Drafts of the Gary Letter \nFor the reasons stated above (see supra Part (III)(B)(3)(i)), the court will grant summary \njudgment for CLC with respect to the fourteen pages of drafts of the Gary Letter.  Because the \nrelevant decision is DOJโs decision to issue the letter, these drafts are not pre-decisional and thus \nmay not be withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege under Exemption 5.  \nii.  โDraft responseโ \nThe record provides very little information about this draft letter.  The Vaughn Index \nestablishes that it is dated February 13, 2018, so it does not appear to be another draft of the Gary \nLetter (which was finalized in December 2017.)  The title of the document in the Vaughn Index is \nโDraft Response. Census. Honorable Vicente Gonzalezโ but the description states only that โthis is \na draft letter.โ  (Allen Decl. at 9.)  Neither the JMD declaration nor the briefing provide any \nadditional information.  With so little information, the court cannot meaningfully determine whether \nthe draft properly falls under Exemption 5.  See King v. DOJ, 830 F. 2d 210 (D.C. Cir. 1987) \n(โAffidavits submitted by a governmental agency in justification for the claimed exemption must . . \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 29   Filed 06/01/20   Page 27 of 27\n. enable the District Court to make a rational decision whether the withheld material must be \nproduced . . .โ) (internal quotations omitted).  Drafts are not presumptively privileged, and the court \nmust consider whether the document was pre-decisional (and what the relevant decision is), as well \nas whether the document was deliberative.  See Judicial Watch. Inc., 297 F. Supp. 2d at 260.  On \nthe current record, the court cannot make such a determination.  The court will therefore deny \nsummary judgment for both DOJ and CLC and direct JMD to provide an additional declaration.  \niii.  Robinson-Gary Email \nThe record also provides insufficient information about this email.  JMDโs Vaughn index \nstates only that โthis is an interagency communication discussing how the Commerce Department is \nconsidering handling a matter.โ  (Allen Decl. at 8.)  DOJโs briefing provides no further elucidation.  \n(Def. MSJ; Def. Reply at 14.)  JMDโs declaration states that the email was an โinter-agency \ndiscussion[] between [] Commerce and [DOJ] employees related to agency decision-making.  \n(Allen Decl. ยถ 18.)  This information is not enough for the court to make a meaningful decision \nabout whether the records were properly withheld under Exemption 5.  As to this email, then, the \ncourt will deny summary judgment for DOJ and CLC and direct JMD to supply an additional \ndeclaration.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendantโs motion for summary judgment will be granted in \npart and denied in part, and Plaintiffโs cross-motion for summary judgment will be granted in part \nand denied in part. A corresponding Order will follow shortly. \nDate:  June 1, 2020 \n \nTanya S. Chutkan                                 \nTANYA S. CHUTKAN \nUnited States District Judge  \n \n27 \n ",

      "title": "Complaint for Injunctive Relief",
      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \nCAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER     \n1411 K Street NW, Suite 1400   \nWashington, DC 20005   \n   \n      Plaintiff,   \n  Civil Action No.  \nv.   \n   \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF   \n \nJUSTICE \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW \nWashington, DC 20530 \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n1.  This action is brought under the Freedom of Information Act (โFOIAโ), 5 U.S.C. ยง \n552, to compel the Department of Justice, specifically the Department of Justice components \nJustice Management Division and the Office of Attorney General, to produce records responsive \nto a February 1, 2018 FOIA request concerning the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 \nCensus Questionnaire. To date, the Department of Justice has not released any documents related \nto the โcitizenship question,โ even though it sent a letter to the Commerce Department requesting \nits addition to the 2020 Census. Plaintiff seeks injunctive and other appropriate relief to compel \ndefendant United States Department of Justice to disclose requested records, as required by FOIA, \n5 U.S.C.ยง 552. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n\n2.  This Court has both subject matter jurisdiction over this action and personal \njurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. Venue is \nproper under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff  Campaign  Legal  Center  (โCLCโ)  is  a  nonpartisan,  nonprofit  legal \norganization that works to strengthen American democracy at all levels of government. Among \nother activities, CLC engages in local, state, and federal actions to ensure the political process is \naccessible to all citizens, resulting in a representative, responsive, and accountable government. \nAs part of these activities, CLC conducts research, publishes reports and articles, and regularly \nprovides expert analysis to the media. CLC is also involved in litigation throughout the country \nregarding voting rights, campaign finance, redistricting, and electoral ethics. To support these \nefforts and to educate the public, CLC regularly seeks information under FOIA regarding federal \nagency decision-making. \n4.  Defendant Department of Justice (โDOJโ) is a department of the Executive \nBranch of the United States Government. The Office of Information Policy (โOIPโ), the Office \nof the Attorney General (โOAGโ), and the Justice Management Division (โJMDโ) are \ncomponents of Defendant DOJ. Defendant DOJ is an โagencyโ within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง \n552(f). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n5.  On February 1, 2018, CLC submitted to OAG and JMD a FOIA request for \nrecords pertaining to a request by Arthur E. Gary, the General Counsel of JMD, to the Census \nBureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census Questionnaire. See Ex. 1 (Feb. 1, 2018 \nFOIA Letter).  \n2 \n \n\n6.  In particular, CLC sought (1) documents to, from, or mentioning Dr. Ron Jarmin \nor Dr. Enrique Lamas; and (2) documents containing the phrases โ2020 census,โ โlong form,โ \nโcitizenship question,โ โquestions regarding citizenship,โ โACS,โ โAmerican Community \nSurvey,โ โcitizen voting age population,โ or โCVAP,โ dating from January 20, 2017 to the \npresent. \n7.  CLC requested expedited processing because there is an โurgency to inform the \npublicโ about the โactual or alleged government activityโ covered by the request and because the \nrequested records involve โa matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there \nexist possible questions about the governmentโs integrity that affect public confidence.โ 28 \nC.F.R. ยง 16.5(e)(1)(iv).  \n8.  Since CLCโs initial request, the urgency of this request has only increased. On \nMarch 26, 2018, Secretary Ross announced his decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 \nCensus.1 Secretary Ross made this announcement despite a technical review by Census officials \nconcluding that the change will be โvery costlyโ and โharm[] the quality of the Census count.โ2 \nEighteen states, as well as various cities, counties, mayors, and nonprofit organizations, have filed \nsuit against the Department of Commerce to enjoin the addition of the citizenship question. See \nState of New York, et al. v. Depโt of Commerce, No. 18-cv-2921 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). In those lawsuits, \n                                                 \n1 Memorandum from Secโy of Commerce Wilbur Ross to Under Secโy of Commerce for Econ. \nAffairs Karen Dunn Kelley on Reinstatement of a Citizenship Question on the 2020 Decennial \nCensus Questionnaire 7 (Mar. 26, 2018) \n(https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/2018-03-26_2.pdf). \n2 Memorandum from John M. Abowd, Chief Scientist and Associate Director for Research and \nMethodology, U.S. Census Bureau, Technical Review of the Department of Justice Request to \nAdd Citizenship Question to the 2020 Census (Jan. 19, 2018) \n(http://www.osec.doc.gov/opog/FOIA/Documents/AR%20-%20FINAL%20FILED%20-\n%20ALL%20DOCS%20%5bCERTIFICATION-INDEX-\nDOCUMENTS%5d%206.8.18.pdf#page=1289). \n3 \n \n\nthe administrative record that has been produced does not include records from the Department of \nJustice. Mr. Garyโs request and Secretary Rossโs subsequent decision to add a citizenship question \nto the 2020 Census have garnered enormous media and public interest, affecting public confidence \nin the government.3  \nA. Office of the Attorney General \n9.  OAG responded to CLCโs request on February 9, 2018. OAG granted CLCโs \nrequest for expedited processing, but claimed the records sought required a โsearch in and/or \nconsultation with another Office,โ and thus presented โunusual circumstancesโ under 5 U.S.C. ยง \n552(a)(6)(B). OAG provided no โdate on which a determination is expected,โ as required by 5 \nU.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(B)(i). See Ex. 2 (Feb. 9, 2018 OAG Response).    \n10.  After receiving no further communication from OAG, CLC sent a letter on May \n18, 2018 requesting information about the status of the request and a prompt determination. See \nEx. 3 (May 18, 2018 CLC Letter). \n11.  When OAG still failed to respond, CLC sent another letter on June 22, 2018 \nrequesting information about the status of the request and a prompt determination. See Ex. 4 \n(June 22, 2018 CLC-OAG Letter). \n12.  OAG contacted CLC on June 28, 2018 estimating that OAGโs initial search for \ndocuments responsive to CLCโs request would be complete in approximately one month. OAG \ndid not indicate when their review of the responsive documents would be complete. On July 6, \n                                                 \n3 See, e.g., Salvador Rizzo, Wilbur Rossโs false claim to Congress that the census citizenship \nquestion was DOJโs idea, WASH. POST, July 30, 2018, http://www. \nwashingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/07/30/wilbur-rosss-false-claim-to-congress-\nthat-the-census-citizenship-question-was-dojs-idea/?utm_term=.9b77d9164811; Michael Wines, \nCensus Bureauโs Own Expert Panel Rebukes Decision to Add Citizenship Question, N.Y. TIMES, \nMarch 30, 2018, http://www. nytimes.com/2018/03/30/us/census-bureau-citizenship.html. \n4 \n \n\n2018 OAG further informed CLC that an average mid-sized expedited request requires \napproximately eight months to complete, an estimate that would place completion of CLCโs \nrequest around October 1, 2018. See Ex. 5 (Email Correspondence from James Smith). \n13.  OAG has far exceeded the applicable deadline for responding to the request by \nfailing to respond within thirty working days of receipt. See 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(A)(i); 5 U.S.C. \nยง 552(a)(6)(B)(i).  \n14.  CLC has exhausted its administrative remedies. See U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(C)(i) \n(โAny person making a request to any agency for records โฆ shall be deemed to have exhausted \nhis administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the \napplicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.โ). \nB. Justice Management Division \n15.  JMD granted CLCโs request for expedited processing on March 14, 2018 in a \nphone call between Karen McFadden of JMD and Danielle Lang of CLC. JMD promised to \nquickly provide responsive documents on subsequent phone calls on April 26 and May 31, 2018, \nbut did not provide a date on which it expected to produce such responsive documents. \n16.  When JMD failed to provide any additional information, CLC sent a letter on \nJune 22, 2018 requesting information about the status of the request and a prompt determination. \nSee Ex. 6 (June 22, 2018 CLC-JMD Letter). \n17.  To date, CLC has received no further response from JMD.  \n18.  JMD has far exceeded the applicable deadline for responding to the request by \nfailing to respond within twenty working days of receipt. See 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n19.  CLC has exhausted its administrative remedies. See U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(C)(i) \n(โAny person making a request to any agency for records โฆ shall be deemed to have exhausted \n5 \n \n\nhis administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the \napplicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.โ). \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Freedom of Information Act for Wrongful Withholding of Agency Records \n20.  Plaintiff repeats and alleges paragraphs 1-19. \n21.  Defendantโs failure to make available complete records sought by CLCโs request \nviolates FOIA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(3)(A).  \n22.  Defendant has failed to make a determination with respect to Plaintiffโs request \nwithin either twenty or thirty working days as required by 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(A)(i) and 5 \nU.S.C. ยง 552(a)(6)(B)(i).  \n23.  Plaintiff has exhausted its administrative remedies. See 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(6)(C)(i). \n24.  Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief with respect to the release and disclosure of \nthe requested documents. See 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(B)(4) (โOn complaint, the district court โฆ has \njurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records.โ). \nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Order Defendant DOJ to disclose all responsive records not exempt from \ndisclosure; \nB.  Order Defendant DOJ to produce a Vaughn index for all documents it claims are \nexempted from disclosure; \nC.  Award Plaintiff its costs and reasonable attorneysโ fees incurred in this action; and \nD.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDated: July 30, 2018 \n6 \n \n\n        By: _/s/____________________ \nBUCKLEY SANDLER LLP \nAdam Miller (DC Bar # 496339) \n1250 24th Street NW, Suite 700 \nWashington, DC 20037 \n202-349-7958 \namiller@buckleysandler.com \n \nCAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER \nAdav Noti (DC Bar # 490714) \nDanielle M.

MSJ), and CLC has cross-moved for \nsummary judgment (ECF No. 15, Pl. MSJ).  For the reasons set forth below, the court will deny \nDOJโs motion for summary judgment and grant CLCโs cross-motion for summary judgment.1 \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \nWilbur Ross became Secretary of the Department of Commerce on February 28, 2017.  \nRoughly two months later, he emailed a subordinate, Earl Comstock, stating: โI am mystified why \nnothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship \nquestion. Why not?โ  (ECF No. 15-5, 5/2/17 Email at 2.)  Ross was referring to his request to add a \n \n1 Due to overlapping facts and claims between this case and another case before this court, \nCampaign Legal Center v. DOJ, No. 18-cv-1771, portions of this opinion are identical to language \nin the summary judgment opinion in that case.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 2 of 14\nquestion about citizenship status to the 2020 Census Questionnaire.  Comstock replied the same \nday: โI agree Mr. Secretary . . . We need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship \nbe added back as a census question, and we have the court cases to illustrate that DoJ has a \nlegitimate need for the question to be included.  I will arrange a meeting with DoJ staff this week to \ndiscuss.โ  (5/2/17 Email at 2.)   \nSecretary Ross followed up that August: โwhere is the DoJ in their analysis? If they still \nhave not come to a conclusion please let me know your contact person and I will call the AG.โ  \n(ECF No. 15-6, Pl. Exh. 5 at 2.)  A month later, on Friday September 8, 2017, Comstock sent \nSecretary Ross a memo stating:  \nI spoke several times with James McHenry [DOJ] by phone, and after considering \nthe  matter  further  James  said  that  Justice  staff  did  not  want  to  raise  the \nquestion . . . James directed me to Gene Hamilton at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.  Gene and I had several phone calls to discuss the matter, and then Gene \nrelayed  that  after  discussion  DHS  really  felt  []  it  was  best  handled  by  the \nDepartment of Justice.  At that point the conversation ceased and I asked James \nUthmeier [OGC at Commerce] to look into the legal issues and how Commerce \ncould add the question to the Census itself. \n \n   (ECF No. 15-7, Pl. Exh. 6, at 2).  The record indicates that Secretary Ross contacted then-\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions that same Friday, because the following Monday, Arthur Gary, the \nGeneral Counsel for DOJโs Justice Management Division, emailed John Gore, a Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General: โ[Assistant Attorney General for Administration] Lee Lofthus has asked me to \nreach out to you to find out if you and/or [the Civil Rights Division] have any background \ninformation regarding some concerns raised that the Secretary of Commerce raised last week with \nthe AG relating to the 2020 Census.  I understand the concerns relate to potential questions relating \nto citizenship . . .โ  (ECF No. 19-2, Pl. Exh. A, at 6.)   \nThe record further suggests that Attorney General Sessions quickly agreed to request the \ncitizenship question.  Later that week, Gore connected via email a DOJ employee and a Department \nof Commerce employee to coordinate a call between Sessions and Ross.  (ECF No. 15-8, Pl. Exh. 7, \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 3 of 14\nat 2.)  In the correspondence preceding the call, the DOJ employee wrote: โ[f]rom what John [Gore] \ntold me, it sounds like we can do whatever you all need us to do and the delay was due to a \nmiscommunication.  The AG is eager to assist.โ  (Id.)  A call between Sessions and Ross occurred \nthat dayโSeptember 17, 2017.  (Id.)  With the Attorney General on board, the drafting process \ncommenced, including the following steps: \nโข  November 1, 2017:  Gore emailed Chris Herren (Voting Section Chief) asking for \ncomments and edits on a draft letter.  (Pl. Exh. A at 57.)  \nโข  November 3, 2:05 p.m.: Herren responded: โsome comments from me are included in \nthe attached.โ  (Id.) \nโข  November 3, 5:10 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โthe draft letter that we discussed earlier \nthis week is attached. Letโs touch base early next week once youโve had a chance to \nreview it.โ  (Id. at 13.) \nโข  November 3, 5:35 p.m.: Bethany Pickett (Civil Rights Division) emailed Gore: โIโve \nattached the letter that we discussed yesterday. I would be happy to discuss this \nfurther. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding my comments and \nedits.โ  (Id. at 56.) \nโข  November 22: Gary replied to Gore with a revised draft.  (Id. at 14.) \nโข  November 25: Gore replied, writing that he โfound a few nits.โ  (Id. at 17.)  \nโข  November 27, 12:43 p.m.: Gore emailed Rachael Tucker and Robert Troester (both \nat DOJ): โAttached please find the near-final draft of the letter to Census.โ  (Id. at \n66.)  \nโข  November 27, 1:25 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โ[a] couple more nits in the attached.โ  \n(Id. at 20.) \nโข  November 30, 4:21 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โI have received some nits back from \nthe leadership offices, which are reflected in the attached redline and clean versions.โ  \n(Id. at 24.) \nโข  December 8, 3:14 p.m.: Tucker emailed Gore: โIโm working to review this quickly. \nWill be back in touch shortly.โ  (Id. at 64.) \nโข  December 8, 3:57 p.m.: Gore emailed Gary: โAttached is a redline of the letter with \nleadershipโs final changes. With these changes, we are authorized to send.โ  (Id. at \n34.)  \n \nWith the letter complete, Gary mailed and faxed it (the โGary Letterโ) to Dr. Ron Jarmin of \nthe U.S. Census Bureau on December 12, 2017.  (Id. at 39.)  In March 2018, Secretary Ross \nannounced Commerceโs intention to add the citizenship question, writing that โ[f]ollowing receipt \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 4 of 14\nof the DOJ request, I set out to take a hard look at the request and ensure that I considered all facts \nand data relevant to the question . . .โ  (ECF No. 15-2, Pl. Exh. 1, at 2.)    \nIn June of that year, Secretary Ross clarified, in a supplemental memorandum, that he had \nhad the idea before DOJโs request, and that he had in fact asked DOJ to make the request: โmy staff \nand I consulted with Federal government components and inquired whether [DOJ] would support, \nand if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question as consistent with and useful for \nenforcement of the Voting Rights Act.โ  (ECF No. 15-4, Pl. Exh. 3, at 2.)  This supplemental \nmemorandum indicates that not only did Commerce ask DOJ to make the request, it further \nsupplied DOJ with the rationale for the request.  (Id.)  By the time Attorney General Sessions \nagreed to make the request, all DOJ had to do was draft and send it.   \nOn February 1, 2018 CLC submitted a FOIA request to the DOJโs Civil Rights Division \n(CRT) seeking โall records pertaining to Arthur Garyโs December 12, 2017 request to the Census \nBureau to add a Citizenship question to the 2020 Census Questionnaire.โ  (ECF No. 12-3, FOIA \nRequest at 3.)  CLC asked DOJ to search for โ[a]ny documents to, from, or mentioning Dr. Ron \nJarmin or Dr. Enrique Lamasโ and to use eight search terms: โ2020 Censusโ, โlong formโ, \nโcitizenship questionโ, โquestion regarding citizenshipโ, โACSโ, โAmerican Community Surveyโ, \nโcitizen voting age populationโ, and โCVAP.โ  (Id.) \nDOJ acknowledged receipt on February 9, 2018 and granted the request for expedited \ntreatment.  (Id. ยถ 3.)  After conducting an initial search, DOJ denied CLC access to all responsive \ndocuments on February 28, 2018.  (Id. ยถ 9.)  CLC filed this action on May 21, 2018.  (ECF No. 1.)  \nDOJ then conducted an additional search and on September 26, 2018 released 59 pages in full or in \npart, while also withholding 43 pages of responsive documents in full under Exemptions 5 and 6. \n(Cooper Decl. ยถ 11).  On November 19, 2018 DOJ released an additional 11 pages.  (ECF No. 19-1, \nSupp. Cooper Decl. ยถ 12.)   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 5 of 14\nAt this point, two issues remain.  CLC contests (1) the adequacy of DOJโs search, and (2) \nDOJโs use of Exemption 5 to redact 20 pages and withhold 43 pages. \n \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA.  Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is proper where the record shows there is no genuine issue of material \nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ.

District of Columbia, 298 F.3d 989, 991 (D.C. \nCir. 2002).  โA fact is โmaterialโ if a dispute over it might affect the outcome of a suit under \ngoverning law; factual disputes that are โirrelevant or unnecessaryโ do not affect the summary \njudgment determination.โ  Holcomb v.

Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  โAn issue is โgenuineโ if โthe evidence is \nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โโ  Holcomb, 433 F.3d at \n895.  Courts must view โthe evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant[ ] and draw[ ] \nall reasonable inferences accordingly,โ and determine whether a โreasonable jury could reach a \nverdictโ in the non-movantโs favor.  Lopez v. Council on Am.โIslamic Relations Action Network, \nInc., 826 F.3d 492, 496 (D.C. Cir. 2016).   \nB.  FOIA \nFOIA cases are typically decided on motions for summary judgment.  Brayton v. Office of \nthe U.S. Trade Rep., 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  โFOIA provides a โstatutory right of \npublic access to documents and recordsโ held by federal government agencies.โ  Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Wash. (CREW) v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 602 F. Supp. 2d 121, 123 \n(D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Pratt v. Webster, 673 F.2d 408, 413 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  Federal agencies \nmust comply with requests and make their records available to the public unless such โinformation \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 6 of 14\nis exempted under [one of nine] clearly delineated statutory [exemptions].โ  CREW, 602 F. Supp. 2d \nat 123; see also 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 552(a)โ(b).  Summary judgment for the agency is only appropriate \nwhen an agency proves that it has fully discharged its FOIA obligations.  Moore v. Aspin, 916 F. \nSupp. 32, 35 (D.D.C. 1996).   \nIn cases challenging the applicability of certain FOIA exemptions, the district court conducts \na de novo review of the agencyโs decision to withhold requested documents under any \nof FOIAโs specific exemptions.  See id; 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(B).  The burden is on the agency to \nshow that nondisclosed, requested material falls within a stated exemption.  See Petroleum Info. \nCorp. v. U.S. Depโt of Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1433 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing 5 U.S.C. \nยง 552(a)(4)(B)).  Agencies may rely on supporting declarations that are reasonably detailed and \nnon-conclusory.  See King v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 218 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (โaffidavits \ncannot support summary judgment if they are conclusory, merely reciting statutory standards, or if \nthey are too vague or sweeping.โ).  The declarations must provide enough information โto afford the \nFOIA requester a meaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court an adequate foundation to \nreview, the soundness of the withholding.โ  Id. at 218.  โIf an agencyโs affidavit describes the \njustifications for withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information \nwithheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence \nin the record or by evidence of the agencyโs bad faith, then summary judgment is warranted on the \nbasis of the affidavit alone.โ  ACLU v. U.S. Depโt of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(citations omitted).  A motion for summary judgment should be granted in favor of the FOIA \nrequester, however, where โan agency seeks to protect material which, even on the agencyโs version \nof the facts, falls outside the proffered exemption.โ  Coldiron v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 310 F. Supp. \n2d 44, 48 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting Petroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1433). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 7 of 14\nIn cases where the adequacy of a search is at issue, the agency โmust show beyond material \ndoubt [] that it has conducted a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.โ  \nWeisberg v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  The court employs a \nreasonableness test to determine whether an agencyโs search for responsive materials is adequate.  \nRodriguez v. Depโt of Def., 236 F. Supp. 3d 26, 34 (D.D.C. 2017) (citing Campbell v. U.S. Depโt of \nJustice, 164 F.3d 20, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  โ[T]he adequacy of a FOIA search is generally \ndetermined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry \nout the search.โ  Iturralde v. Comptroller of the Currency, 315 F.3d 311, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  \nHowever, โevidence that relevant records have not been released may shed light on whether the \nagencyโs search was indeed adequate.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351.  The court must accord agency \naffidavits โa presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims \nabout the existence and discoverability of other documents.โ  Safecard Servs., Inc. v. SEC, 926 F.2d \n1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โIt is well-establishedโ \nhowever โthat a conclusory affidavit that gives โno detail as to the scope of the examination . . . is \ninsufficient as a matter of lawโ in demonstrating the adequacy of the search.โ  Am.-Arab Anti-\nDiscrimination Comm. v. U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., 516 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2007) \n(quoting Weisberg v. U.S. DOJ, 627 F.2d 365, 370 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). \n \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nAlthough โa motion for summary judgment cannot be โconcededโ for want of opposition,โ \nWinston & Strawn, LLP v. McLean, 843 F.3d 503, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2016), โ[t]his does not mean . . . \nthat the Court must assess the legal sufficiency of each and every [claim] invoked by the \ngovernment in a FOIA case.โ  Shapiro v. U.S. Depโt of Justice, 239 F. Supp. 3d 100, 106 n.1 \n(D.D.C. 2017).  Instead, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 8 of 14\n[w]here  the  FOIA  requester  responds  to  the  governmentโs  motion  for  summary \njudgment without taking issue with the governmentโs decision to withhold or to redact \nspecific documents, the Court can reasonably infer that the FOIA requester does not \nseek those specific records or information and that, as to those records or information, \nthere is no case or controversy sufficient to sustain the Courtโs jurisdiction. \n \nId; see Lujan v. Def. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Accordingly, the court will address only \nCLCโs arguments in response to DOJโs motion for summary judgment.   \nA.  Adequacy of the Search \nUnder FOIA, an adequate search is one that is โreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant \ndocuments.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351; see Oglesby v. Depโt of the Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. \nCir. 1990) (โ[T]he agency must show that it made a good faith effort to conduct a search for the \nrequested records, using methods which can be reasonably expected to produce the information \nrequested.โ).  CLC requested โall records pertainingโ to the Gary letter, and as noted above, it \nrecommended eight search terms.  (Cooper Decl. ยถ 2.) \nDOJ searched for responsive documents in the Voting Section and at the Office of the \nAssistant Attorney General (OAAG).  (Supp. Cooper Decl. ยถยถ 4, 6.)  Senior staff in the Voting \nSection determined that all responsive records would be found in Chris Herrenโs Outlook account; \nHerren searched his account and located responsive documents.  (Id. ยถ 4.)  At the OAAG, the \nDirector of Operational Management determined that Gore โwas the only OAAG employee who \nhad a substantive role in the preparation of the Gary letter.โ  (Id. ยถ 7.)  Goreโs Outlook account was \nfirst searched using the term โcensus,โ and later searched for emails on which Gary and Pickett \nwere addressees.  (Id. ยถ 9).   \nNone of these searches used any of CLCโs eight suggested search terms.  DOJ argues that \ntwo of the eight terms are too general, but does not address the other six.  (ECF No. 19, Def. Reply \nat 5; Supp. Cooper Decl. ยถ 11.)  This court is mindful that an agency has discretion in how it \nconducts a FOIA search, and that โ[i]n general, a FOIA petitioner cannot dictate the search terms \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 9 of 14\nfor his or her FOIA request.โ  Bigwood v. U.S. Depโt of Def., 132 F. Supp. 3d 124, 140 (D.D.C. \n2015).  But an agencyโs discretion โis not boundless; the search terms selected must pass muster \nunder a standard of reasonableness.โ  Coffey v. Bureau of Land Management, 249 F. Supp. 3d 488, \n498 (D.D.C. 2017) (internal quotes omitted).  DOJโs use of a single search term for all the digital \nrecords does not pass muster under that standard.  It is likely that responsive digital documents exist \nwhich do not have the word โcensusโ in them.  Thus, because only one search term was used, and \nthat term was inadequate, the search was not โreasonably calculated to uncover all relevant \ndocuments.โ  Weisberg, 705 F.2d at 1351.  As to this issue, the court will grant summary judgment \nfor CLC.  \nB.  Exemption 5 \nCLC challenges DOJโs invocation of Exemption 5 to redact 20 pages and withhold 43 pages.  \n(Pl. MSJ at 18โ26; ECF No. 20 at 9โ14.)  Exemption 5 shields documents that would โnormally \n[be] privileged from discovery in civil litigation against the agency,โ including documents protected \nby the attorney-client, work-product, and deliberative process privileges.  Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117 \nF.3d 607, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  To withhold a document under Exemption 5, the โdocument must \nmeet two conditions: its source must be a Government agency, and it must fall within the ambit of a \nprivilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency \nthat holds it.โ  Stolt-Nielsen Transp. Grp. Ltd. v. U.S., 534 F.3d 728, 733 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  There is no dispute that the first condition is met here; the \npartiesโ dispute is directed to the second condition. \nDOJ argues that the requested materials fall under the deliberative process privilege, which \nprotects materials that are โpredecisionalโ and โdeliberative.โ  Mapother v. Depโt of Justice, 3 F.3d \n1533, 1537 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  This case turns on the first requirementโthat the withheld materials \nbe predecisional.  Documents are predecisional if they were โprepared in order to assist an agency \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 10 of 14\ndecisionmaker in arriving at his decision, rather than to support a decision already made.โ  \nPetroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1434 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the \ncontested documents consist of 11 drafts of the letter from Gary to Dr. Ron Jarmin as well as \nredactions from 20 pages of related emails.  (ECF No. 12-2 at ยถ 13.)    \nCLC argues that none of the documents are predecisional because they were created after \nCommerce decided to add the citizenship question to the Census and after DOJ decided to issue the \nletter requesting that question.  (Pl. MSJ at 21โ22.)  Defendant does not dispute this timeline, but \nargues that the documents are predecisional because they were created before the letter was \nfinalized.  (Def. Reply at 6โ7.)  The parties thus agree on the sequence of events, but disagree about \nwhat constitutes the relevant agency decision: the decision to write the letter, or the decision about \nthe letterโs final contents.   \nThe inquiry can be circular.  Indeed, every draft postdates the decision to write it, and \nsimultaneously predates the decision of what to include in it.  Such is the case here: the drafting \nprocess postdated Attorney General Sessionโs decision to issue the letter, but undeniably predated \nthe decision about the final contents of the letter.  In this regard, Plaintiff and Defendant are both \nright: the disputed materials are predecisional, but they are also postdecisional.  The ultimate \nquestion is what constitutes the relevant decision for Exemption 5.  \nAs Wright & Miller have observed, โ[d]efining โdecisionโ for purposes of the privilege is no \neasy task.โ  26A Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed. Practice & Procedure ยง 5680 (1st ed. 1992). \nThough there is no well-established test for identifying the relevant decision, cases in this Circuit do \nprovide some guidance.  First, they suggest that the relevant decision in any given case is one that \ninvolves discretion about what an agency position or agency policy should be.2  The D.C. Circuit \n \n2 This does not mean that a relevant agency decision must involve a formal policy.  See Gold Anti-\nTrust Action Comm., Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 762 F. Supp. 2d 123, 135-36 \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 11 of 14\nhas held, for example, that documents did not fall under Exemption 5 because they โwere not \nsuggestions or recommendations as to what agency policy should be.โ  Coastal States Gas Corp. v. \nDepโt of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 868 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (emphasis added).  The Court later elaborated \non this principle: \nTo  fall  within  the  deliberative  process  privilege,  materials  must  bear  on  the \nformulation or exercise of agency policy-oriented judgment . . . [W]hen material \ncould not reasonably be said to reveal an agencyโs or officialโs mode of formulating \nor exercising policy-implicating judgment, the deliberative process privilege is \ninapplicable. \n \n Petroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1435 (D.C. Cir. 1992).   \nConsistent with this language, this Circuit has held that drafts showing the exercise of \nโagency policy-oriented judgmentโ are in fact predecisional.  See Natโl Assโn of Home Builders v. \nNorton, 309 F.3d 26, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  In Dudman Commcโns Corp. v. Depโt of Air Force, 815 \nF.2d 1565, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the D.C. Circuit withheld a preliminary draft of a historical work \npublished by the Air Force about operations in South Vietnam between 1961 and 1964.  The \ndrafting process involved decisions about the agencyโs historical conclusions and representations to \nthe public.  Id. at 1566.  In Radiation Sterilizers, Inc. v. U.S. Depโt of Energy, No. 90-880, 1991 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 4669 (D.D.C. Apr. 9, 1991), the Court withheld documents from a drafting \nprocess that determined what data and conclusions should be included in an interim report to \nCongress about a chemical leak.  Likewise, in Brown v. Dept. of State, 317 F. Supp. 3d 370, 370 \n \n(D.D.C. 2011) (โeven if an internal discussion does not lead to the adoption of a specific \ngovernment policy, its protection under Exemption 5 is not foreclosed as long as the document was \ngenerated as part of a definable decision-making process.โ) (citing Petroleum Info. Corp. v. U.S. \nDepโt of the Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992).    \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 12 of 14\n(D.D.C. 2018), the court withheld documents produced in preparation for court filings and for a \nletter to Congress.   \nThe facts of this case are significantly different.  The letter at issue did not involve discretion \nabout an agency position or about the primary reasons for the agency position.  The agencyโs \nposition and the reasons for the letter had already been decided.  Thus, the drafting did not \ndemonstrate โthe process by which policy is formulated,โ nor could it โreasonably be said to reveal \nan agencyโs or officialโs mode of formulating or exercising policy-implicating judgment.โ  \nPetroleum Info. Corp., 976 F.2d at 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992).   \nMoreover, Gary and Gore were not drafting the document so that a supervisor or colleague \ncould decide a particular issue.  In Coastal States, the D.C. Circuit held that โa document from a \nsubordinate to a superior official is more likely to be predecisional.โ  617 F.2d at 868.  This is \nbecause such documents generally aid in the decisionmaking process about an agencyโs position.  \nThus, in Access Reports v. Depโt of Justice, the D.C. Circuit upheld withholding a document that a \nlow-level employee created for supervisors who had asked for research on a particular issue.  926 \nF.2d 1192, 1196-97 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  Such documents are quintessentially predecisionalโthey are \ncreated to help the agency make a decision.  See Krikorian v. Dept. of State, 984 F.2d 461, 466 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (withholding a document from subordinates to supervisors that proposed two \noptions for how to respond to public inquiries about a recent agency decision regarding a genocide); \nUnited Am. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, 531 F. Supp. 2d 29, 44 (D.D.C. 2008) (withholding investigative \nnotes that were provided to an office to assist it in writing a report to employees about identity theft \nagainst the agency); Blank Rome LLP v. Depโt of the Air Force, No. 15-cv-1200 (RCL), 2016 U.S. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 13 of 14\nDist. LEXIS 128209, at *14, *35 (D.D.C. Sept. 20, 2016) (withholding draft documents that \nassisted the Air Force in coming to a decision regarding a settlement proposal).   \nHere, the contested documents do not fit that mold.  They were not used to help the agency \nmake a decision, but rather were used to communicate the decision.3  If the materials in question \nwere drafts of documents that Gore and Gary prepared for Attorney General Sessions before he \ndecided to request the citizenship question, they would be squarely predecisional.  But that was not \ntheir purpose.  While Gore did email the draft to supervisors before it was sent to the Census \nBureau, it is telling that in the email he wrote that he was sending them a โnear-finalโ draft.  (Def. \nExh. A at 66.)  In other words, the draft was not provided to supervisors to help them make a \ndecision.  The decision had already been made, and the supervisors were reviewing Goreโs \nimplementation of it.  (See id.)  \nThe court is mindful of the D.C. Circuitโs directive that Exemption 5 should be construed \nnarrowly.  โIn light of the FOIAโs strong policy in favor of disclosure . . . Exemption 5 is to be \nconstrued as narrowly as consistent with efficient Government operation.โ  Petroleum Info. Corp., \n976 F.2d at 1434 (internal quotations omitted); see also Wolfe v. Depโt of Health and Human Servs., \n839 F.2d 768, 773 (D.C. Cir 1988).  Consequently, the court finds that the relevant decision for \npurposes of Exemption 5 is the one made by Attorney General Sessions to request the citizenship \nquestion, not the decision about the final contents of the letter.  The emails sent and the drafts \n \n3 Decisions about how to message agency policy to the public can be predecisional.  See Hooker v. \nHHS, 887 F. Supp. 2d. 40, 40 (D.D.C. 2012) (withholding drafts of a publication about vaccine \nsafety);  Hunton & Williams LLP v. U.S. EPA, Civ. A. No. 15-1203, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166174 \nat *9 (D.D.C. Sept. 27, 2018) (withholding drafts of letters to non-profits and emails discussing \ncommunications strategy); Sierra Club v. U.S. Depโt of Interior, 384 F. Supp. 2d 1, 20 (D.D.C. \n2004) (withholding documents related to the agencyโs response to a congressional inquiry.)  In fact, \na court recently held that the contested documents in this case constituted โmessaging.โ  See New \nYork v. U.S. Depโt of Commerce, Civ. A. No. 18-2921, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1772468 at *20 \n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2018).  These cases are inapplicable here because DOJ concedes that the withheld \nmaterials are not messaging documents.  (Def. Reply at 15 n.3.)  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01187-TSC   Document 31   Filed 06/01/20   Page 14 of 14\nwritten after that decision are thus not predecisional and cannot be withheld under Exemption 5. \nBecause the documents are not predecisional, the court need not decide whether they are \ndeliberative.    \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nBecause DOJโs search was inadequate and the withheld materials are not protected by \nExemption 5, Defendantโs motion for summary judgment will be DENIED and CLCโs cross-motion \nfor summary judgment will be GRANTED.  A corresponding Order will follow shortly. \nDate:  June 1, 2020 \nTanya S. Chutkan                                 \nTANYA S. CHUTKAN \nUnited States District Judge  \n \n \n14 \n ",

DOJ appealed the portion of the courtโs order pertaining \nto the deliberative privilege process, and in the meantime, the parties submitted renewed cross-\nmotions for summary judgment.  ECF Nos. 48; 52.   \nOn May 17, 2022, the D.C. Circuit reversed the courtโs order in part and remanded.  \nCampaign Legal Ctr. v. United States Depโt of Just., 34 F.4th 14 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  The Circuit \nfound that the process of drafting the Gary Letter to request the addition of a citizenship question \nin a way that protected the DOJโs litigation and policy interests involved the exercise of \npolicymaking discretion, and so the letterโs content itself was a relevant final decision for \n\nCase 1:18-cv-01771-TSC   Document 60   Filed 08/19/22   Page 2 of 2\npurposes of FOIAโs deliberative process privilege.  Id. at 18.  The Circuit thus held that DOJ \nproperly withheld non-final drafts of the letter, and that most of DOJโs redactions of associated \nemails were lawful.  Id.  The Circuit also found that the record failed to establish whether several \nredacted emails were pre-decisional and deliberative, and remanded for this court to reexamine \nthose documents.  Id. at 18โ19. \nThe mandate issued on July 11, 2022, ECF No. 57, and on August 7, 2022, the court \ninstructed the parties to meet and confer, and file a Joint Status Report setting forth their \nrespective positions on the impact of the Circuitโs decision, see Min. Order (Aug. 7, 2022).  The \ncourt then held a status conference on August 19, 2022, to discuss the partiesโ positions.   \nUpon consideration of the Circuitโs decision, the partiesโ respective positions on the \nimport of that decision on their pending motions, and for reasons explained at the August 19, \n2022, status conference, the court will DENY WITHOUT PREJUDICE DOJโs Motion for \nSummary Judgment, ECF No. 48, and CLCโs Cross Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. \n52.  \nThe parties shall meet and confer and file a joint proposed briefing schedule for renewed \ncross motions for summary judgment by August 23, 2022, at 5:00 pm.   \n \nDate:  August 19, 2022 \n \nTanya S.
