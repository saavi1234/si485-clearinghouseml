    "summary": "<p>This is a class action about the unequal treatment of female general custody prisoners in the Oneida County Jail (&ldquo;the Jail&rdquo;). On May 12, 2020, three female general custody prisoners filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York on behalf of themselves and the jail's female general custody prisoners (present or future). The plaintiffs sued the Oneida County Sheriff and the Chief Deputy of the Oneida County Jail under the Declaratory Judgment Act for violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; they also alleged violations of Article I &sect; 11 of the New York State Constitution. Represented by the Legal Services of Central New York, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Jail from denying female general custody prisoners equal access to the housing and program benefits that male general custody prisoners receive. The case was assigned to Judge Mae A. D'Agostino.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs claimed that the Jail discriminated against female general custody prisoners on the basis of gender by restricting these prisoners to &ldquo;linear housing units&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;podular housing units&rdquo; (pods), where male general custody prisoners are held, and by denying them equal access to programming and benefits. For men, the complaint explained, linear housing units were typically used to isolate prisoners with behavioral and disciplinary issues. But for women, they were used more generally.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs set out many allegations about the problems with linear units, which were smaller than pods and which severely restricted prisoner movement. In particular, it said, some of the units had not been updated since 1965 and were covered in dirt and human excrement that female prisoners were forced to remove using limited cleaning supplies. At best, linear units had small common spaces with four picnic tables, no air conditioning, and frosted windows that did not open. At worst, linear units did not have hot water, television, or books. The plaintiffs&rsquo; unit (at the time of the complaint) had one shower and one phone, only one of which could be used at a time. Plaintiffs alleged inconsistent access to hot water and clean cold water and could only watch television every other day. When they did, plaintiffs could only choose from a small selection of DVDs. Plaintiffs were allowed only one hour of outdoor recreation a day, and they did not have access to exercise equipment.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, the complaint alleged that pods, where male general custody prisoners were housed, allowed prisoners to move freely unless they were mandated to lock-in. Pods resembled small high school cafeterias and were connected to recreation areas with exercise equipment, basketball hoops, and a large window to let in fresh air. Pods also had small libraries with games and reading materials for the prisoners, a separate room for prisoners to video call their loved ones, cable televisions, hot water dispensers, microwaves, and air conditioning. Finally, pods contained eight showers (one for every seven prisoners) and seven telephones (one for every eight prisoners), which were in separate areas. Male general custody prisoners&rsquo; cells were bigger than the women's cells and had windows, unlike women's housing.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to having more humane housing, plaintiffs alleged that male general custody prisoners who exhibited good behavior were given access to programming and benefits that similarly situated female general custody prisoners were denied, including free video calls and extra commissary items. Female general custody prisoners were also limited to laundry work programs, whereas male general custody prisoners had access to numerous work programs, including food service, car wash, general library, print shop, grounds maintenance, building maintenance, and janitorial services.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs moved for class certification a week after filing their complaint, and also moved for a preliminary injunction on June 10, 2020, asking the court to provide the plaintiffs the same housing privileges and benefits as male prisoners. On August 3, 2020, Judge D'Agostino granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; Motion for Class Certification but denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; Motion for Preliminary Injunction. 2020 WL 4449527. In denying plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Judge D'Agostino concluded that the plaintiffs were not sufficiently likely to succeed on the merits because they probably could not demonstrate that female general custody prisoners were not receiving substantially equivalent treatment to their male counterparts. Furthermore, Judge D'Agostino concluded that the balance of equities tipped in the defendants' favor because the public interest is best served when courts do not interfere with the daily operations of local jails.</p>\r\n<p>On August 8, 2020, plaintiffs appealed the district court&rsquo;s order denying preliminary injunction to the Second Circuit.&nbsp;While the appeal of the district court&rsquo;s order denying preliminary injunctive relief was pending before the Second Circuit, this case proceeded in the district court. On November 19, 2020, an Exhaustion Hearing was held before U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel J. Stewart to determine if the plaintiffs had satisfied the exhaustion requirement under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. On December 7, 2020, the district court granted a request to remove Williamson and Terrell as class representatives.</p>\r\n<p>On January 11, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated and remanded the district court&rsquo;s order. In its analysis of whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction, the Second Circuit examined the three grounds that the district court&rsquo;s order proclaimed would be dispositive of whether plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. The first ground was whether plaintiffs had exhausted their remedies, and the Second Circuit concluded that the district court clearly did not rely on this ground for denying preliminary relief. The second ground was whether plaintiffs received substantially equivalent treatment to comparable men. Although the district court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that general custody women did not receive substantially equivalent treatment to similarly situated men, the Second Circuit disagreed and determined that the present record did not warrant that conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the Second Circuit analyzed whether the disparities in treatment satisfied intermediate scrutiny, i.e., that the disparate treatment of general custody women was substantially related to an important government interest. The Second Circuit determined the current record did not support a finding that the disparate treatment satisfied intermediate scrutiny. Thus, the Second Circuit vacated the district court&rsquo;s order and remanded the case to the district court to clarify its decision and make additional findings of fact or conclusions of law. 839 F. App'x 633 (2d Cir. 2021).</p>\r\n<p>On March 11, 2021, Magistrate Judge Stewart issued a Report-Recommendation and Order recommending that the district court find that the alleged failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies was not a basis for dismissing this action. Discovery was ongoing throughout 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On January 14, 2022, United States District Judge D'Agostino adopted Magistrate Judge Stewart&rsquo;s Report-Recommendation and Order in its entirety and granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. Within ten days of the preliminary injunction, the defendants were to return female general custody inmates to one of the pod housing units, providing them with the same housing option that male general custody inmates received. The preliminary injunction was to expire within 90 days of its effective date, and the plaintiffs were given the option to seek to renew the preliminary injunction for an additional 90 days by making a written extension request before this preliminary injunction expired. On April 14, 2022, the plaintiffs requested continued preliminary injunctive relief, and District Judge D&rsquo;Agostino granted the order extending the preliminary injunction for an additional 90 days on April 22, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 27, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and permanent injunction. The district court issued an order setting the date for a settlement conference for June 7, 2022. At the settlement conference, the case was deemed settled in principle, awaiting the County Attorney&rsquo;s Office and County Legislative approval and for formal settlement papers. In light of the settlement in principle, the motion for summary judgment and response and reply deadline were stayed pending the final settlement. On August 2, 2022, District Judge D&rsquo;Agostino granted preliminary approval of the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>On October 24, 2022, the district court approved the class action settlement and issued an order dismissing this case.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n1 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 2 of 21\n \n  Three former inmates at the Oneida County Correctional Facility, Nicole Williamson, \nSarah Barrett, and Shannon Terrell,1 commenced this action on behalf of themselves and all other \nsimilarly situated general custody female inmates on May 12, 2020.  See Dkt. No. 1.  Plaintiffs \nallege that the transfer of female inmates from \"pod housing\" to \"linear housing\" violated the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the corresponding provision in \nthe New York State Constitution.  On August 3, 2020, this Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for \nclass certification but denied Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to \nreturn female inmates to the pod housing. \n  On January 11, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the denial of a preliminary injunction \nand remanded the matter for further consideration.  After consideration of the Second Circuit's \nSummary Order, further development of the factual record, and review of the supplemental \nbriefing, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. \nII. BACKGROUND \n  The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the factual background of this case, as \ndetailed in the Court's August 3, 2020, Memorandum-Decision and Order.  See Dkt. No. 28 at 2-\n4.  In short, all female inmates were previously housed in a single \"pod unit.\"  See Dkt. No. 23-2 \nat ยถ 16.  In October 2019, the New York State Commission of Correction informed Defendants \nthat general custody and closed custody female inmates were required to be housed separately.  \nSee id. at ยถ 18.  At that time, thirteen women were classified as general custody and fifteen were \nclassified as closed custody.  See id. at ยถ 7.  On January 22, 2020, to comply with the Commission \nof Correction, all female inmates were moved out of the pod housing and into linear housing.  See \n \n1 On December 7, 2020, Nicole Williamson and Shannon Terrell were removed as class \nr epresentatives pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1), and the caption was amended to reflect the \nchange.  See Dkt. No. 60. \n2 \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 3 of 21\n \nDkt. No. 72-1 at ยถ 6.  The current action stems from the allegedly worse conditions of the linear \nunits. \n  Previously, the Court held that female inmates received substantially similar treatment as \nthe male inmates remaining in pod housing, except for the issue of air conditioning.  Dkt. No. 28 \nat 23.  Nonetheless, the Court had found that housing female inmates in linear housing satisfied \nintermediate scrutiny.  Id. at 24-25.  The Second Circuit, however, disagreed.  The Second Circuit \nfound that female and male inmates did not receive substantially similar treatment due to factors \nthat this Court failed to consider.  Williamson v. Maciol, 839 Fed. Appx. 633, 637 (2d Cir. 2021).  \nMoreover, the Second Circuit found that the record did not offer satisfactory justifications for the \ndisparate treatment, and therefore could not withstand intermediate scrutiny.  Id. at 638-39. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA.  Legal Standard \n1. Plaintiffs Seek a Prohibitory Injunction  \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish \"a threat of irreparable injury and \neither (1) a probability of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the \nmerits of the claims to make them a fair ground of litigation, and a balance of hardships tipping \ndecidedly in favor of the moving party.\"  Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, 322 F.3d 130, 135 (2d \nCir. 2003)).  \"Irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction.\"  Rodriguez ex rel. Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 233-34 (2d Cir. \n1999) (internal quotations omitted). \nA higher standard, however, applies to mandatory injunctions, which alter the status quo.  \n\"At the start, our precedents draw a distinction between mandatory injunctions, which alter the \nstatus quo, and prohibitory injunctions, which maintain it.\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 635.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 4 of 21\n \nA movant seeking a mandatory injunction must demonstrate \"a clear or substantial showing of a \nlikelihood of success.\"  Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir. 1996).  In its August 3, 2020, \nMemorandum-Decision and Order, this Court held that a preliminary injunction would be \n\"mandatory\" rather than \"prohibitory.\"  Dkt. No. 28 at 14.  The Court held that a preliminary \ninjunction, in this instance, would \"command Defendants [to] move them from the linear style \nhousing to pod housing โฆ thus altering the status quo 'by commanding some positive act.'\"  Id. \n(quoting Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Ent., Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 34 (2d Cir. 1995)).  Therefore, \nthe Court applied the tougher mandatory injunction standard.  Id. \nThe Second Circuit opined that the Court had failed to consider that \"the status quo for the \npurpose of determining whether an injunction is mandatory or prohibitory is 'the last actual, \npeaceable uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.'\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. \nAppx. at 635 (quoting N. Am. Soccer League, LLC v. U.S. Soccer Fed'n, Inc., 883 F.3d 32, 36โ37 \n(2018)).  The relevant status quo only changes when \"a plaintiff waits to contest a change in \ncircumstance.\"  Id. (citing Jolly, 76 F.3d at 474).  The Second Circuit suggested that \"Plaintiffs \nmay be correct that the prohibitory standard applies to their claims, assuming, among other things, \nthat they promptly pursued their remedies.\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 636.  The Second \nCircuit, however, did not resolve whether this preliminary injunction would be mandatory or \nprohibitory because it could not determine whether Plaintiffs promptly pursued those remedies.  \nId.  Moreover, the Second Circuit did not resolve whether the injunction was mandatory or \nprohibitory because it would vacate and remand under either standard.  Id. \n  Plaintiffs were moved into the linear housing on January 22, 2020.  Dkt. No. 72-1 at ยถ 6.  \nDefendants claim that the four-month delay in filing the complaint necessitates a finding that an \ninjunction would be mandatory because the delay transformed female occupancy of the linear \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 5 of 21\n \nhousing units into the status quo.  Plaintiffs, however, could not file a lawsuit immediatelyโthey \nwere required to exhaust administrative procedures.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a); Richardson v. Goord, \n347 F.3d 431, 434 (2d Cir. 2003).  Plaintiffs, therefore, contend that \"it is the date Plaintiffs \nstarted the grievance process not the filing of the complaint, that is relevant to the determination \nof the status quo.\"  Dkt. No. 74 at 11. \n  At the time of its August 3, 2020, Memorandum-Decision and Order, this Court was also \nunable to resolve whether Plaintiffs promptly pursued available remedies.  On November 19, \n2020, however, Magistrate Judge Stewart conducted an Exhaustion Hearing.  See Dkt. No. 55.  \nAlthough the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether Plaintiffs satisfied the exhaustion \nrequirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), the hearing clarified whether \nPlaintiffs promptly pursued available remedies.  After review of the exhaustion hearing and the \nReport-Recommendation and Order, the Court can now conclude that Plaintiffs promptly pursued \navailable remedies and filed the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n  The grievance procedure starts with a complaint process that the housing unit officer \nattempts to resolve informally.  Dkt. No. 73 at 5.  If the inmate is not satisfied with the proposed \nresolution, the complaint is next considered by the sergeant, then the watch commander, and then \nby the lieutenant.  Id.  The grievance policy states that the housing unit officer will give its initial \ninformal response with twenty-four hours, but there is no timetable for a response at any other \nstage of the complaint process.  Id. at 5 n.3.  Only after completion of the complaint process is a \ngrievance form provided by the lieutenant.  Id. at 5.  The grievance then goes to the lieutenant, up \nto the Chief Administrative Office, and finally to the New York State Commission of Corrections.  \nId.  Then, at last, administrative remedies are exhausted and the federal courts available under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1997e(a). \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 6 of 21\n \n  Named Plaintiff Barrett began the grievance procedure by filing a complaint immediately, \non January 22, 2020.  Dkt. No. 73 at 10.  Plaintiff Barrett testified that she continued to file \"three \nor four\" complaints per week about the housing conditions in the linear housing unit because her \ncomplaints were rejected or otherwise ignored.  Dkt. No. 66 at 49-51.  Katrina Parkhurst also filed \na complaint immediately upon the move to the linear housing unit.  Id. at 92.  Carrie Bachman \ntestified that she filed six or seven complaints in the eight-day period she was in the linear \nhousing unit before being released.  Id. at 72.  Records also indicate that complaints were filed by \nSusan Egan on February 12, Brittany Berry on February 25, Dominque Carney on March 2, and \nTiffany Greene on March 21.  Dkt. No. 73 at 8-9.  Few of the complaints filed reached the \nlieutenant and no complainants were provided with a grievance form.  After months of frustration \nwith the complaint process, and without having exhausted the grievance process, Plaintiffs \nultimately filed this suit on May 12, 2020.  See Dkt. No. 1. \n\"[T]he status quo for the purpose of determining whether an injunction is mandatory or \nprohibitory is the last actual, peaceable uncontested status which preceded the pending \ncontroversy.\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 635 (citing N. Am. Soccer League, LLC v., 883 F.3d \nat 36โ37) (internal quotations omitted).  Plaintiffs spent the months between the move to linear \nhousing and the initiation of this lawsuit fighting and contesting the new housing status.  When \nthis lawsuit was initiated, the \"last actual, peaceable uncontested status which preceded the \npending controversy\" was female inmate occupancy of the pod housing.  The four-month gap \nbetween the move and the beginning of this lawsuit was not a delay, but rather an effort to resolve \nthe issue through the complaint and grievance mechanism that the Oneida County Jail had \nestablished, and which Plaintiffs were required to exhaust pursuant to the PLRA.  Accordingly, \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 7 of 21\n \nPlaintiffs seek a prohibitory injunction and need only demonstrate \"a likelihood of success on the \nmerits[.]\"  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., 747 F.2d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 1984). \n2. Intermediate Scrutiny \n  Subsumed in the determination of a \"likelihood of success on the merits\" is the legal \nstandard applied to the merits.  In its August 3, 2020, Memorandum-Decision and Order denying \npreliminary relief, the parties agreedโand the Court assumedโthat intermediate scrutiny applied \nto Plaintiffs' claim that gender discrimination in prison violates the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, this Court analyzed whether the gender-based classification \n(1) served important governmental objectives and (2) was substantially related to achieving those \nobjectives.  See, e.g., United States v. VMI, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).  But the Second Circuit, in \nits Summary Order vacating and remanding, noted that the \"'Supreme Court has created a lower \nlevel of scrutiny in determining the constitutionality of prison rules,' generally requiring only that \nprison action 'be reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.'\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. \nAppx. at 635 n.2 (quoting Allen v. Cuomo, 100 F.3d 253, 261 (2d Cir. 1996)); see also Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 81 (1987).  However, because \"of the absence of briefing on this issue,\" the \nSecond Circuit assumed intermediate scrutiny applies.  Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 635 n.2. \n  Now, Defendants have accepted the Second Circuit's invitation and argue that Turner \napplies to Plaintiffs' claim.  See Dkt. No. 72-2 at 19-20.  The Court is not persuaded.  The \nSupreme Court has held that Turner does not apply to race-based classifications because \"the \nright not to be discriminated against based on one's race\" is \"not a right that need necessarily be \ncompromised for the sake of proper prison administration.\"  Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, \n510 (2005).  The Johnson Court applied strict scrutiny to plaintiff's equal protection claim and \nheld that \"deference [to prison administrators] is fundamentally at odds with . . . equal protection \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 8 of 21\n \njurisprudence,\" id. at 506 n.1, because \"the government's power is at its apex\" in the prison \ncontext, making \"searching judicial review\" particularly \"necessary to guard against invidious \ndiscrimination.\"  Id. at 511.  The Johnson Court cabined the Turner-standard to \"rights that are \ninconsistent with proper incarceration,\" such as First Amendment or due process claims, and held \nthat \"[t]he right not to be discriminated against based on one's race is not susceptible to the logic \nof Turner.\"  Id. at 510 (internal quotation omitted). \n  The Second Circuit, in presenting the issue to the parties, cited to two of its pre-Johnson \ndecisions, Benjamin v. Coughlin, 905 F.2d 571, 575 (2d Cir. 1990) and Allen v. Cuomo, 100 F.3d \n253, 261 (2d Cir. 1996), which arguably support an application of the more lenient Turner-prison \nstandard to gender discrimination in prison claims.  The Second Circuit, however, has not \nreevaluated whether a gender discrimination in prison claim is subject to intermediate scrutiny \nfollowing Johnson.  But every other circuit to address the issue following Johnson has held that \nintermediate scrutiny is appropriate to gender discrimination in prison claims.  Harrison v. \nKernan, 971 F.3d 1069, 1076โ80 (9th Cir. 2020); Roubideaux v. N.D. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., \n570 F.3d 966, 974 (8th Cir. 2009); Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d 1450, 1453โ55 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  \nIndeed, following Johnson, most district courts have agreed as well.  See, e.g., Dupigny v. \nHannah, No. 3:20-CV-00836, 2021 WL 151043, *3 (D. Conn. Jan. 18, 2021); Washington v. \nMcAuliffe, No. 7:16-CV-00476, 2019 WL 1371859, *11 (W.D. Va. Mar. 26, 2019); Blanchard v. \nWyoming Dep't of Corr. Dir., No. 17-CV-0124, 2017 WL 10350606, *3 (D. Wyo. Nov. 9, 2017); \nBullock v. Sheahan, 568 F. Supp. 2d 965, 973 (N.D. Ill. 2008). \n  To be sure, there may be legitimate reasons to treat men and women differently in prison \nadministration.  But the intermediate scrutiny standard accounts for a government's legitimate \nreasons to distinguish inmates based on gender.  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533-34.  Applying the proper \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 9 of 21\n \nequal protection standard in a prison case, the Supreme Court noted, \"does not preclude the ability \nof prison officials to address the compelling interest in prison safety.\"  Johnson, 543 U.S. at 514.  \nHere, prison administrators will have to demonstrate that their gender-based policies (1) serve \nimportant governmental objectives and (2) are substantially related to achieving those objectives.  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 533; Johnson, 543 U.S. at 514. \n3. PLRA and Prison Administration \n  The PLRA provides that \"any preliminary injunctive relief concerning prison conditions \n'be narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires \npreliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.'\"  Green Haven \nPrison Preparative Meeting of Religious Soc'y of Friends v. New York State Dep't of Corr. & \nCmty. Supervision, โ F.4th โ, 2021 WL 4824127, *6 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting 18 U.S.C. ยง \n3626(a)(2)).  Pursuant to the PLRA, preliminary injunctive relief automatically expires \"90 days \nafter its entry, unless the court โฆ makes the order finalโฆ.\"  18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2). \nAdditionally, in the prison context, \"'a request for injunctive relief must always be viewed \nwith great caution so as not to immerse the federal judiciary in the management of [ ] prisons.\"'  \nV.W. by & through Williams v. Conway, 236 F. Supp. 3d 554, 581 (N.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting \nFisher v. Goord, 981 F. Supp. 140, 167 (W.D.N.Y. 1997)).  Moreover, in weighing a request for \npreliminary injunctive relief, \"[t]he court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on \npublic safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the preliminary relief.\"  \nGreen Haven, 2021 WL 4824127, at *6.  However, \"[c]ourts may not allow constitutional \nviolations to continue simply because a remedy would involve intrusion into the realm of prison \nadministration.\"  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 511 (2011). \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 10 of 21\n \n  In sum, in order to succeed on the motion for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate \"a threat of irreparable injury and either (1) a probability of success on the merits or \n(2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of the claims to make them a fair ground of \nlitigation, and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in favor of the moving party.\"  Motorola \nCredit Corp. v. Uzan, 322 F.3d 130, 135 (2d Cir. 2003)).  In determining whether there is a \nprobability of success on the merits, the Court will apply intermediate scrutiny to Plaintiffs' \nclaims and, pursuant to the PLRA, the Court will also weigh public safety and the operation of a \ncriminal justice system.  Finally, the Court must ensure that any preliminary injunctive relief it \ngrants is \"narrowly drawn, extend[s] no further than necessary to correct the harm the court finds \nrequires preliminary relief, and [is] the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm.\"  18 \nU.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2). \nB.  Irreparable Harm \n  \"In the Second Circuit, it is well settled that an alleged constitutional violation constitutes \nirreparable harm.\"  Arias v. Decker, 459 F. Supp. 3d 561, 571 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (collecting cases); \nsee also Statharos v. New York City Taxi and Limousine Comm'n, 198 F.3d 317, 322 (2d Cir. \n1999) (\"Because plaintiffs allege deprivation of a constitutional right, no separate showing of \nirreparable harm is necessary\").  An Equal Protection Clause violation for gender discrimination \nin prison administration is therefore an irreparable injury.  See, e.g., Victory v. Berks Cty., No. CV \n18-5170, 2020 WL 236911, *26 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 15, 2020).  Here, Plaintiffs allege an ongoing \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause and, as such, have made a clear showing of irreparable \nharm. \nC.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  1. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 11 of 21\n \nThe PLRA states that \"[no] action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under \nsection 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or \nother correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"  42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1997e(a); see also Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002).  The Court's August 3, \n2020, Memorandum-Decision and Order denying preliminary relief disclaimed a reliance on \nexhaustion grounds because the Court could not resolve whether administrative remedies were \navailable to Plaintiffs.  See Dkt. No. 28 at 18-19.  Although administrative remedies generally \nmust be exhausted, a prisoner need not exhaust remedies if they are not \"available.\"  Ross v. \nBlake, 578 U.S. 632, 635 (2016).  Now, following an exhaustion hearing before Magistrate Judge \nStewart on November 19, 2020, and a subsequent Report-Recommendation and Order, issues of \nfact regarding the availability of administrative remedies have been resolved.  Dkt. Nos. 55, 73.  \nThe Court adopts the Report-Recommendation and Order in its entirety and finds that the PLRA \ndoes not preclude Plaintiffs' claims because the issue was not grievable and the grievance process \nwas unavailable to Plaintiffs. \nIn reviewing a report-recommendation and order, a district court \"may accept, reject, or \nmodify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"  28 \nU.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(C).  When a party fails to make specific objections, the court reviews the \nmagistrate judge's report for clear error.  See Farid v. Bouey, 554 F. Supp. 2d 301, 307 (N.D.N.Y. \n2008); see also Gamble v. Barnhart, No. 02-CV-1126, 2004 WL 2725126, *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, \n2004).  Because neither party has objected to Magistrate Judge Stewart's Report-Recommendation \nand Order, the Court reviews it for clear error. \nMagistrate Judge Stewart identified two reasons to excuse the failure to exhaust.  First, \nMagistrate Judge Stewart found the issue was non-grievable.  The PLRA does not apply to non-\n11 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 12 of 21\n \ngrievable issues because \"it is the prison's requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the \nboundaries of proper exhaustion.\"  Jones, 549 U.S. at 218; see also Beckhorn v. New York State \nDep't of Corr. and Cmty. Supervision, No. 18-CV-1452, 2019 WL 234774, *9 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, \n2019).  Second, Magistrate Judge Stewart found that Plaintiffs encountered roadblocks in \naccessing the grievance procedure.  As a result, Magistrate Judge Stewart found that \"'the \ngrievance process at the Facility was 'practically speaking, incapable of use.'\"  Dkt. No. 73 at 20 \n(quoting Ross, 578 U.S. at 643). \nAfter review of the exhaustion hearing and the Report-Recommendation and Order, the \nCourt finds no clear error and adopts its findings in its entirety.  The current action is not \nprecluded by the PLRA's exhaustion requirement because the issue was not grievable and the \ngrievance procedure was unavailable to Plaintiffs.  The Court therefore proceeds with its \nlikelihood of success on the merits analysis as to the underlying claims. \n  2. Equal Protection Violation \nThe Equal Protection Clause generally requires the government to treat similarly situated \npeople alike.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  The \nCourt reaffirms its prior holding, and the parties do not dispute that, \"women in general custody \nare similarly situated to men in general custody.\"  Dkt. No. 28 at 21.  Therefore, the Court will \nfirst determine whether general custody women receive substantially equivalent treatment as \ngeneral custody men.  If the female inmates do not receive substantially equivalent treatment, the \nCourt will then apply intermediate scrutiny to the disparities.  As discussed above, Defendants \nwill have to establish that their treatment of Plaintiffs: (1) serves important governmental \nobjectives and (2) is substantially related to achieving those objectives.  See, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. \nat 533. \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 13 of 21\n \na. Whether treatment is substantially equivalent \nIn its August 3, 2020, Memorandum-Decision and Order, the Court found that inmates \nhad substantially similar access to games, books, television,2 computer tablets, telephones, \nshowers, water, recreation, and work assignments.  See Dkt. No. 28 at 21-23.  The Court, \nhowever, noted its concern about the lack of air conditioning in the linear housing.  Id. at 23.  \nNonetheless, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction because it found that \nmoving Plaintiffs to linear housing satisfied the intermediate scrutiny standard.  Id. at 24. \nThe Second Circuit disagreed that the general custody women receive substantially \nequivalent treatment to similarly situated men beyond the issue of air conditioning.  Williamson, \n839 Fed. Appx. at 637. \nThe record is clear that a cell in the linear housing units is \nhalf the size of a cell in the pods, lacks a window to the outdoors, \nand has bars, rather than a door with a small window, at the front of \nthe cell, which arguably diminishes privacy.  Moreover, the roomy \ncommon areas available in pods likewise contrast sharply with the \nsix-foot-wide corridor where inmates can gather in linear housing \nunits.  Making matters worse, female inmates are provided with \nonly two hours of outside recreation while comparable male \ninmates receive up to six, depending on the number of men who \nwish to avail themselves of the outdoor space. \n \nId.  The Second Circuit, however, stated that \"our sister circuits have noted that the Equal \nProtection Clause does not require perfect identity between the programs available to women and \nmen in prisons.\"  Id. (citing Women Prisoners of D.C. Dep't of Corr. v. District of Columbia, 93 \nF.3d 910, 926โ27 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Klinger v. Dep't of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 732 (8th Cir. 1994)).  \nAlthough the Second Circuit found that \"the present record does not support a denial of relief on \n \n2 Previously, this Court found substantial equivalency where \"men have access to basic cable \n channels, women have access to movies and DVDs.\"  Dkt. No. 28 at 21.  On October 8, 2021, the \nCourt was informed that female inmates now have access to live television.  See Dkt. No. 84. \n13 \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 14 of 21\n \nthe ground that Plaintiffs failed to show the required difference in treatment,\" it also \nacknowledged that \"[f]urther development of the record may demonstrate that Plaintiffs are \nindeed treated equally based on a full assessment of the benefits and drawbacks of the different \nhousing units.\"  Id.   \n  Following remand, Defendants have not offered any evidence to show that the benefits \nand drawbacks of the different housing units are substantially equivalent.  Female inmates have \nless space, less recreation time, and no air conditioning, with no offsetting benefits.  Defendants \nattempt to explain the differences by stating that under certain conditions, there are actually no \ndisparities.  Because the conditions under which male and female inmates do receive substantially \nsimilar treatment are unconnected from the record and unlikely to occur, the Court does not find \nDefendants' arguments persuasive. \n  Defendants argue that pod and linear units are comparable sizes because the pod units are \ndesigned for two inmates.  But there is no evidence that the pod units house two inmates in \npractice or that they will in the future.  See Dkt. No. 74-1 at ยถยถ 5-9.  The only record evidence \nshows that men are housed in 80 square foot units and women in 35 square foot units.  See Dkt. \nNo. 23-2 at ยถยถ 11-12.  Similarly, Defendants state that when pods are at maximum capacity, men \nand women both receive two hours of recreation a day.  Id. at ยถยถ 35-39.  But in practice, men \nreceive up to six hours.  Id. at ยถ 39 (\"It is true male inmates receive up to six (6) hours of \nrecreation/day โฆ.\"); see also Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 637.  It is immaterial that a \nhypothetical scenario exists in which men and women inmates receive the same amount of \nrecreation time when the record shows that in practice men receive three times as much recreation \ntime. \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 15 of 21\n \nAnd lastly, Defendants justify the lack of air conditioning with an irrelevant scenario: on \nan August day where the temperature outside was seventy-five degrees, the temperature inside the \nlinear units was also seventy-five degrees.  See Dkt. No. 74 at 14-15.  Based solely on this \nreading, Defendants argue that \"the evidence establishes that irrespective of whether inmates at \nthe jail have air conditioning or fans, the resulting temperatures fall within the human comfort \nzone.\"  Dkt. No. 72-2 at 18.  The one measurement only shows that the temperature in the linear \nunits is similar to the outside temperature.  The Court instead finds the numerous complaints \nabout temperature, including from Defendants' employees, more persuasive and reaffirms its \nstated concerns in its August 3, 2020 Memorandum-Decision and Order regarding air \nconditioning.  See Dkt. No. 28 at 23-24. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have established a probability that female \ninmates do not receive substantially equal benefits and privileges as male inmates receive.  \nTherefore, the Court now turns to whether the discrepancies in benefits and privileges satisfy \nintermediate scrutiny. \nb. Intermediate Scrutiny \nFor a gender-based classification to survive intermediate scrutiny, Defendants must \nestablish that it is substantially related to an important government interest.  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533.  \nThe justification for differential treatment must be \"exceedingly persuasive\" and must \nadditionally be \"genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation.\"  Id.  As \nthe Supreme Court has made clear, the relevant inquiry is the justification and empirical support \nwhen the policy was made.  See, e.g., Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 729 (examining \nwhether a policy was substantially related to an important government interest by examining \nevidence \"when the [defendant] opened its door\").  \"The burden of justification is demanding and \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 16 of 21\n \nit rests entirely on the State.\"  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citing Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at \n724). \nHere, the female inmates were moved from the pod housing to the linear housing because \nthe general custody and closed custody female inmates were improperly housed together.  See \nDkt. No. 23-2 at ยถยถ 17-20.  Rather than place the thirteen general custody and fifteen closed \ncustody female inmates each into their own fifty-six unit pod, Defendants decided that housing \nfemale inmates in the linear housing units \"was more practical โฆ while also maintaining or \nexceeding minimum standards.\"  Id. at ยถยถ 8, 11, 23.  Defendants argue that utilizing two separate \npods would result in minimal occupancy, thus presenting difficult safety and security challenges.  \nId. at ยถ 22. \nIn its August 3, 2020, Memorandum-Decision and Order the Court accepted Defendants' \nsecurity justification for moving female inmates to the linear units.  The Second Circuit, however, \nrejected the unintuitive assertion that less prisoners in a pod unit would result in more safety \nissues.  The Second Circuit held that \"[o]n this record, we are unable to discern whether the \ndifficulty identified is a function of the administrative inconvenience of housing a small number \nof inmates in a pod, the pecuniary cost of needing to hire more staff, or the unique features of \nprison management.\"  Dkt. No. 65 at 9.  \"Defendants must explain to the reviewing court why it \nwould be more difficult to provide Plaintiffs with equal treatment and must assure the district \ncourt that these are not post hoc rationalizations.\"  Id. \nOn remand, Defendant Chief Zurek has offered a slightly more detailed explanation of the \ndifficulties in securing less populated pods.  Defendant Chief Zurek states that the open areas and \nempty cells allow inmates to more easily engage in prohibitive conduct and evade detection.  See \nDkt. No. 72-1 at ยถ 32.  \"In essence, the larger inmate population in pods is beneficial to effective \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 17 of 21\n \nsecurity and supervision as they watch over each other and draw attention to those inmates [ ] \nengaging in negative conduct.\"  Id.  Defendants point to areas behind staircases and empty cells as \na particular security concern with sparsely populated pods.  Id. at ยถ 31. \nThe Court notes, however, that only post-litigation declarations by Defendant Chief Zurek \nhave been provided by Defendants to show that security is the primary justification.  Defendants \nhave offered no contemporaneous evidence.  \"The justification offered in support of a challenged \npolicy must be exceedingly persuasive and must additionally be 'genuine, not hypothesized or \ninvented post hoc in response to litigation.'\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 638 (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533).  In a March 29, 2020, Observer-Dispatch article, however, Defendants do not \nmention the difficulty in maintaining security with few inmates.  Instead, the justification offered \nby Defendants was costโthe utility bill and cost of extra staffing to keep the pod unit open.  Dkt. \nNo. 18-3 at 73. \nDefendants' supplemental declaration in support of its proffered security justification falls \nshort of \"exceedingly persuasive.\"  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533.  As the Second Circuit stated, \"this \ncounterintuitive assertion โ that fewer inmates are more difficult to monitor than many โ cannot \npass scrutiny without further elaboration that is wholly missing from Zurek's affirmation.\"  \nWilliamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 638.  The Court finds that the further elaboration provided by \nDefendant Chief Zurek does not satisfy the Second Circuit's concern.  Instead, it only reiterates \nthe same assertions that the Second Circuit had rejected.  Dkt. No. 72-3 at ยถยถ 31-35.  Defendants \nargue that when inmates fill less space it is easier for them to go into empty cells or hide under the \nstairs.  Id. at 31.  When the pod is full, Defendants argue, inmates draw attention to other inmates \nengaging in negative conduct.  Id. \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 18 of 21\n \nThe Court is not persuaded for a few reasons.  First, the Sheriff's Office description of the \npod housing states that \"[o]fficers have an open view of all parts of the unit from a central vantage \npoint. โฆ [T]he less restrictive environment [on the pod] increases visibility. . .\"  Dkt. No. 18-3 at \n4.  Defendants state they cannot lock the empty cells because an emergency locking mechanism \nunlocks all of the cells, which would then provide an opportunity for an inmate to hide in an \nempty cell.  Dkt. No. 72-1 at ยถ 38.  Defendants do not state why or how often the emergency \nsystem is used.  Nor do Defendants discuss other manual ways of blocking access to the cells or \narea underneath the stairs.  Lastly, while the Court credits Defendants' assertion that inmates often \ndraw attention to negative behavior occurring, nonetheless, the drastically reduced supervisor to \ninmate ratio certainly offsets that factor.  The Court does not find it \"exceedingly persuasive\" that \nit is easier for a supervisor to identify negative behavior when there are forty inmates than when \nthere are fifteen. \n  The Court also notes that while costs and administrative convenience may be legitimate \ngovernmental objectives, they are not \"sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based \nclassifications.\"  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 198 (1976); Clarkson, 898 F. Supp. at 1051 \n(\"[A]llegations of administrative convenience or savings of time, money and effort are \ninsufficient justifications\" for gender discrimination).  The Court therefore finds a likelihood that \nDefendants' relocation of female general custody inmates to the linear housing units does not pass \nintermediate scrutiny. \nD.   PLRA and Public Interest   \n  \"Congress has specifically instructed federal courts to be highly conscious of the unique \nsecurity needs of prisons and, accordingly, to be deferential to the judgment of administrators \nwho have unique expertise.\"  Williamson, 839 Fed. Appx. at 638 (citing 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2)).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 19 of 21\n \nAnd the Supreme Court has said that \"[w]e must accord substantial deference to the professional \njudgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate \ngoals of a corrections system and for determining the most appropriate means to accomplish \nthem.\"  Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003).  Specifically, the PLRA provides that \"any \npreliminary injunctive relief concerning prison conditions 'be narrowly drawn, extend no further \nthan necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires preliminary relief, and be the least \nintrusive means necessary to correct that harm.'\"  Green Haven Prison Preparative Meeting of \nReligious Soc'y of Friends v. New York State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, โ F.4th โ, \n2021 WL 4824127, *6 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2)).  Therefore, \"'a request for \ninjunctive relief must always be viewed with great caution so as not to immerse the federal \njudiciary in the management of [ ] prisons.\"'  V.W. by & through Williams v. Conway, 236 F. \nSupp. 3d 554, 581 (N.D.N.Y. 2017) (quoting Fisher v. Goord, 981 F. Supp. 140, 167 (W.D.N.Y. \n1997)). \n  Defendants were required to adjust the housing arrangement of female inmates to separate \nclosed custody and general custody female inmates.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 15.  Defendants are \naccorded \"substantial deference\" to determine the \"most appropriate means to accomplish\" this \ngoal.  Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003).  The current arrangement, however, likely \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee to be free of discrimination on the basis of \ngender.  Defendants have not suggested any alternative arrangements that would remedy the \nongoing violation.  Throughout this litigation, Defendants' efforts to equalize the benefits between \nthe male and female general custody inmates, such as providing the female inmates access to live \ntelevision, see Dkt. No. 84, have been unable to remedy the gender discrimination.  As such, the \nCourt orders that Defendants shall return female general custody inmates to the pod housing, \n19 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 20 of 21\n \nwhich is sufficiently \"narrowly drawn\" and the \"least intrusive means\" to remedy the gender \ndiscrimination.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \n \nAfter careful review of the record, the parties' submissions, and the applicable law, the \nCourt hereby \nORDERS that Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 18) is \nGRANTED; and the Court further  \nORDERS that Magistrate Judge Stewart's Report-Recommendation and Order (Dkt. No. \n73) is ADOPTED in its entirety for the reasons set forth herein; and the Court further \nORDERS that, within TEN (10) DAYS of the date of the Memorandum-Decision and \nOrder, Defendant shall return female general custody inmates to one of the pod housing units, \nthereby providing the same housing option afforded to male general custody inmates; and the \nCourt further \nORDERS that pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2), this preliminary injunctive relief shall \nexpire within NINETY (90) DAYS of the effective date of this Memorandum-Decision and \nOrder; and the Court further \nORDERS that, prior to the expiration of this preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs may seek to \nrenew the preliminary injunction for an additional ninety (90) days, by making a request with the \nCourt, in writing, seeking such an extension;3 and the Court further \n \n3 Alternatively, to avoid the necessity of Plaintiffs having to continually seek to renew the \npreliminary injunction pending resolution of this case on the merits, the parties may file with the \n Court a stipulation agreeing to keep the preliminary injunction in place pending final resolution of \nthis case. \n20 \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 88   Filed 01/14/22   Page 21 of 21\n \nORDERS that the Clerk of the Court shall serve a copy of this Memorandum-Decision \nand Order on the parties in accordance with the Local Rules. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nDated: January 14, 2022 \n  Albany, New York \n21 \n ",

STEWART \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \nREPORT-RECOMMENDATION and ORDER \nThis matter is presently before the Court for a decision after an Exhaustion Hearing \nwhich was held on November 19, 2020.  See Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. \n2011).  For the reasons that follow, it is recommended that the District Court find that \nunder  the  circumstances  presented  the  Plaintiff  class  has  satisfied  the  exhaustion \nrequirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (โPLRAโ). \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 2 of 22\n   \n \nI.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn  May  12,  2020,  three  former  inmates  at  the  Oneida  County  Correctional \nFacility, Nicole Williamson, Sarah Barrett, and Shannon Terrell,1 commenced this action \non behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated โgeneral custodyโ female inmates.  \nDkt. No. 1.  They alleged that their January 2020 transfer from pod housing to linear \nhousing violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clauses of both the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution \nbecause similarly situated male inmates were not transferred and were subject to superior \nhousing conditions.  Id.  A complete factual summary has previously been provided in \nthe District Courtโs August 3, 2020 Memorandum-Decision and Order, Dkt. No. 28, and \nwill not be repeated here except as relevant. \n  The District Courtโs August 3rd Decision and Order granted class certification, but \ndenied Plaintiffsโ request for a preliminary injunction.  Id. at p. 26.  As part of the Courtโs \nanalysis of the Plaintiffsโ likelihood of success on the merits, the District Court discussed  \nDefendantsโ affirmative defense that Plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative remedies.  \nId. at pp. 16-19.  The Court concluded that there were questions of fact that existed \nregarding the exhaustion defense which would necessitate a hearing.  Id. at p. 19, fn 3; \nDkt.  No.  31.    Plaintiffโs  counsel  filed  an  interlocutory  appeal  of  the  denial  of  the \npreliminary injunction.  Dkt. No. 35.  On January 11, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated \n \n1 On December 7, 2020, after the Exhaustion Hearing, the District Court granted the request of Plaintiffsโ counsel \nto remove Nicole Williamson and Shannon Terrell as class representatives, and the caption of the case was amended \naccordingly.  Dkt. No. 60.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 3 of 22\n   \n \nthe District Courtโs denial of a preliminary injunction and remanded the matter for further \nconsideration of the issues.  Dkt. No. 65.    \n  The matter was then referred to this Court to conduct an Exhaustion Hearing.  Dkt. \nNo. 31.  The Hearing was originally scheduled for October 15, 2020, but at the request of \ncounsel, was adjourned until November 19, 2020.  Dkt. No. 39.  Despite the practical \nrestrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual Exhaustion Hearing was held \non November 19, 2020.  See Dkt. No. 66, Hearing Transcript (โTr.โ).  At the Hearing the \nDefendants called Lt. Deborah Harris in support of their affirmative defense.  Id.  Plaintiff \nSarah Barrett testified, as did several other former inmates.  After the Hearing, the parties \nsubmitted post-hearing briefs.  Dkt. Nos. 61 & 62.   \nII.  THE EXHAUSTION HEARING AND POST-HEARING BRIEFS  \n          As previously noted, a one-day Exhaustion Hearing was held in this matter on \nNovember 19, 2020.  Several Exhibits were stipulated into evidence at the Exhaustion \nHearing:  \n  Exhibit 1 - Oneida County Correctional Facility Inmate Handbook, 2020.  \nExhibit 2 - Oneida County Correctional Facility Inmate Handbook, 2019.  \nExhibit 3 - Declaration of Lt. Deborah Harris, with Exhibits, dated June 24, 2020. \nExhibit 4 - Declaration of Sarah Barrett, dated May 12, 2020. \nExhibit 5 - Supplemental Declaration of Sarah Barrett, dated June 29, 2020. \nExhibit 6 - Oneida County Correctional Facility Shift Log Entry Summary from \n       November 29, 2019 to October 22, 2020. \n \nExhibit 7 - Deposition testimony of Ashlee Hughes, dated October 28, 2020. \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 4 of 22\n   \n \n  Exhibit 8 -  Deposition testimony of Faith Lamonica, dated October 27, 2020. \n  Exhibit 9 -  Deposition testimony of Daniel Noonan, dated October 27, 2020. \nExhibit 10 - Minimum Standard Evaluation Report for Oneida County Jail, \n                    October 2019. \n \n  Exhibit 11 - Notes of Plaintiff Sarah Barrett. \n  Exhibit 12 - Inmate Request Form from Sarah Barrett, Dated March 6, 2020. \nExhibit 13 - Plaintiffsโ Response and Objections to Defendantsโ First Request for \n                    Production of Documents, Interrogatories, and Request for \n                    Admission, dated October 14, 2020. \n \n  Exhibit 14 - Oneida County Correctional Facility Booking Sheet for Sarah M. \n            Barrett.2 \n \n  Lt. Harris was called by the defense as the first witness at the Hearing.  I found her \ntestimony to be in all respects forthright and credible.  She has been employed by Oneida \nCounty Correctional Facility since 2002, and has been the Grievance Coordinator since \n2017.  Tr. at pp. 4-5.  In that position she receives complaints and turns them into \ngrievances.  Tr. at p. 5.  With regard to Oneida County Correctional Facilityโs grievance \npolicy, that is set forth in the Inmate Handbook which is provided to all inmates upon \nentrance into the Facility.  Tr. at pp. 6-7; Exs. 1 & 2.    \n \n2 After the Hearing had concluded, Defendants made reference to Plaintiffโs deposition testimony in their post-\nhearing submissions to question Ms. Barrettโs credibility, even though Plaintiff was not cross-examined on the \ntranscript, nor was the transcript offered and admitted as a statement by a party opponent.  See Dkt. No. 62.  \nPlaintiffโs counsel seeks to have that portion of Defendantsโ brief stricken.  Dkt. No. 63.  Defendants respond and \nseek, if necessary, leave to admit the transcript as an exhibit now.  Dkt. No. 64.  I agree that the time to introduce \nthe statement would have been at the Hearing so that Plaintiff could respond.  Nevertheless, even were I to consider \nthe statements, it does not affect this Courtโs decision, which does not hinge solely on the credibility of Ms. Barrett.  \nAccordingly, I deny both the request to strike the transcript and the request to formally mark it as an exhibit for \npurposes of the Hearing. \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 5 of 22\n   \n \n  The grievance procedure starts with a complaint process, and the complaint form \nis obtained by the inmate from their housing officer.  Tr. at p. 7; Ex. 1 at CD 04(A)(2).  \nOnce  a  complaint  is  filed,  the  housing  unit  officer  attempts  to  resolve  the  matter \ninformally.  Tr. at p. 8.  If the inmate is not satisfied with the proposed resolution, the \ncomplaint  proceeds  forward  to  be  considered  by  the  sergeant,  then  by  the  watch \ncommander, and then if the inmate is still unsatisfied, the inmateโs complaint proceeds to \nLt. Harris.  Id.  If at any time the inmate accepts the proposed resolution, the process \nstops.  Tr. at pp. 8-9.3\n  Assuming the inmate is not satisfied with the proposed resolution of the complaint \nat the end of the complaint process, Lt. Harris would then assign a control number and \nprovide the inmate with a grievance form.  Tr. at p. 12.  Once the form is filled out the \ngrievance process begins and it is Lt. Harrisโ obligation to perform an investigation and \nprovide the inmate a response within five days.  Tr. at p. 13; Ex. 1 at CD 04(B)(3).  Again, \nif the inmate does not accept the resolution proposed by the Lieutenant, the inmateโs \ngrievance is then forwarded to the Chief Administrative Officer of the Facility for \nconsideration; if the inmate does not accept the Chief Administrative Officerโs response, \nthe grievance is sent to the New York State Commission of Corrections.  Tr. at p. 14; Ex. \n1 at CD04(B).   \n \n3 While the written grievance policy of Oneida County does indicate that the inmate will receive an initial response \nfrom the housing unit officer within 24 hours, it does not address the remaining appeal process described by Lt. \nHarris, or how long the inmate must wait for that process to be completed.  See Ex. 1 at CD 04.  It is clear, however, \nthat the inmate is prevented from proceeding to the grievance process until the complaint process is complete no \nmatter how long that takes.  Tr. at pp. 34-35. \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 6 of 22\n   \n \n  As candidly acknowledged by Lt. Harris, there are limitations to the grievance \nprocess at the Oneida County Correctional Facility.  Tr. at pp. 10-11.  For example, certain \nissues are simply not subject to the grievance process or, stated another way, are โnon-\ngrievable.โ  Id.  These issues include: (1) sanctions for discipline; (2) administrative \nsegregation  housing  issues;  (3)  issues  that  are  outside  the  authority  of  the  chief \nadministrative officer; (4) grievances pertaining to other inmates; (5) a complaint that is \ntoo vague to be understood; and (6) a grievance filed more than five days after the \noccurrence of the event.  Id. at pp. 10-11; Ex. 1 at CD 04(C).  Specifically, and relating \nto the present class action, Lt. Harris clarified in her testimony that the relocation of \nfemale general custody inmates from the pod unit to linear housing is not an event which \nis grievable under the policies of Oneida County Correctional Facility:  \nThe Court:   All right. Is their housing, you know, theyโre being placed in a linear \nhousing. Is that something thatโs grievable or non-grievable? \n \n  The Witness: No \n \n  The Court:   No which? \n \nThe Witness: It is not grievable.  Itโs a classification, and it (sic) cannot grieve the \n                      classification as to where theyโre housed. \n \nTr. at p. 39; see also Ex. 7, Deposition of Ashlee Hughes at pp. 7 & 11 (inmates not \nallowed to grieve housing or privileges like microwaves and TVs).  \n  Further, Lt. Harris was aware of situations where the grievance policy did not \noperate as it should.  Tr. at p. 23.  Inmates had in the past complained to her about her not \nreceiving their complaint forms.  Id.  While housing officers should log the complaint \nforms, Tr. at p. 24, there is a documented history of missing complaints during the time \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 7 of 22\n   \n \nperiod relevant to this case.  Tr. at pp. 29-33.  Under the Facilityโs policy, if the complaint \nis not marked as received, or is not responded to, there is no formal way for the inmate to \nmove forward from the complaint procedure to the grievance procedure.  Tr. at pp. 25 & \n34-35.  Lt. Harris testified that while the written procedure is silent on what to do, many \ninmates are resourceful and will seek a conference with her when nothing happens to their \ncomplaint.  Tr. at p. 25. \n  Lt. Harris then took the Court through the history of the complaints and grievances \nthat she possessed and were filed by the female inmates in linear housing for the period \nfrom January 22, 2020 until June 24, 2020.  Tr. at pp. 15-16; Ex. 3.  Those complaints are \nas follows: \n  A.  Shannon Terrell. The records indicate that inmate Terrell complained \nabout being denied privileges as a trustee and being removed from the pod.  Tr. at p. 17; \nEx. 3 at p. 63.  She is said to have accepted the โresolutionโ of her complaint on the very \nday it was filed.  Id.  The Court notes, however, that the resolution is, in effect, merely an \nexplanation that what she was complaining about was not a grieveable issue.  Ex. 3 at p. \n63 (โDue to the different classifications in the pod, all the females were moved. . .โ).   \n  B.  Sarah  Barrett.  On  February  17,  2020,  Plaintiff  Sarah  Barrett  filed  a \ncomplaint regarding her housing; the availability of books, movies and tablets; and an \ninsufficient supply of hot and cold water.  Tr. at p. 18; Ex. 3 at p. 66.  The unit officer \nindicated that these areas of concern were beyond the officerโs control.  Id.  When the \nmatter proceeded to Lt. Harris, the records indicate that Barrett was satisfied with Lt. \nHarrisโ response regarding her request for โextra privileges.โ  Id. at p. 68.   \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 8 of 22\n   \n \nOn June 14, 2020, Inmate Barrett filed another complaint, this time complaining \nthat the women in the housing block (Henry) are locked in their cell for distribution of \nmedication, when they were never locked in when housed in the pod as general population \ninmates, and where the men are not similarly locked in.  Tr. at p. 21; Ex. 3 at pp. 80-84.  \nThe complaint was denied on June 14 and again on June 15.  It was noted that unit H - \nHenry is a linear style unit, and not a pod, and this justified the different type of treatment.  \nId.  The complaint was then converted to a grievance.  Id.  At the intermediate level, Chief \nDeputy Lisa Zurek proposed that only one side of the unit be locked in at a time for the \ndistribution of medication.  Id.  This proposal was agreed to by Plaintiff on June 24, 2020.  \nId.  \n  C.  Susan Egan. On February 12, 2020, Ms. Egan complained that she was \nsubjected to discrimination due to not being allowed the same privileges as the male \ninmates.  Tr. at pp. 18-19; Ex. 3 at p. 72.  This complaint was resolved by the flat statement \nthat the administration of the Facility had made a decision regarding housing โdue to \npopulation issues.โ  Ex. 3 at p. 72. \n  D.  Brittany Berry.  Ms. Berry filed a written complaint on February 25, 2020, \ncomplaining that she was not receiving hot water two times per shift, and the Facilityโs \nresponse, three days later, was that the water comes in the morning and before lunch.  Tr. \nat p. 19; Ex. C at p. 75.   Lt. Harris believed that this matter was resolved at the complaint \nlevel, but the Complaint Form, while signed, does not contain an indication whether the \nproposed resolution was acceptable or not.  Id.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 9 of 22\n   \n \n  E.  Dominique Carney.  Ms. Carney also complained on March 2, 2020 about \ninsufficient water in the unit, and her belief that the female inmates continued to be denied \nthe same privileges as the male inmates.  Tr. at pp. 19-20; Ex. 3 at pp. 76-77.  At the \nintermediate level inmate Carney was reminded that hot water and cold water was a \nโprivilegeโ pursuant to the handbook.  Id. at p. 77.   Nevertheless, Carney persisted in her \ncomplaint which then went before Lt. Harris, who indicated that she would look into \nhaving that unit receive large water jugs.  Id.  That resolution was accepted.  Id.   \n  F.  Tiffany Greene.  Ms. Greene also complained on March 21, 2020, about \nthe lack of water in the unit, this time relating to the length of time that the water jugs \nwere left on the unit.  Tr. at p. 20; Ex. 3 at p. 78.  The Facility explained that they simply \ndid not have enough jugs.  Ex. 3 at p. 78.  This resolution was accepted.  Id.   \n  G.  Renee  Loadholt.  On  September  19,  2020  inmate  Renee  Loadholt \ncomplained about the lack of hot and cold water, and when it was promised that the female \ninmates would be getting hot and cold water jugs in the morning, afternoon, and at dinner, \nshe accepted that resolution.  Tr. at p. 21; Ex. 3 at pp. 88-89.  \n  H.  Ashley Hluska.  Ms. Hluska also complained about the lack of hot and cold \nwater, as well as mold on the water cups.  Her complaint was resolved, with the kitchen \nbeing instructed to clean all components of the jugs prior to each use.  Tr. at p. 22; Ex. 3 \nat pp. 97-98. \nOn  cross-examination,  Plaintiffโs  counsel  inquired  about  numerous  missing \ncomplaints.  In particular, Lt. Harris confirmed that those complaints previously identified \nconstituted all the complaints that were given to her.  Tr. at p. 29.  However, the shift log \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 10 of 22\n   \n \nentry form, Exhibit 6, references a complaint of Sarah Barrett that was forwarded to the \nSergeantโs desk, of which Lt. Harris has no record.  Tr. at pp. 29-30.  Also missing were \ncopies of a Santina Torres complaint, a Katrina Parkhurst complaint, a Carrie Bachman \ncomplaint, a Jessica Sylvester complaint, and a Nicole Williamson complaint.  Tr. at pp. \n30-33.  In fact, there are no records of any complaints filed on January 22, 2020, the date \nof the move of the female inmates from Pod 4 to linear housing on H Block.  Tr. at p. 33.  \nAll of these missing complaints concerned Lt. Harris.  Id.  \n  The Defendants called no further witnesses at the Hearing.  The Plaintiff produced \nfour additional witnesses. \n  Plaintiff Sarah Barrett testified that she was an inmate at the Correctional Facility \nfrom November 26, 2019 to July 23, 2020, and was initially housed in a pod before she \nwas moved to Henry, a linear style housing unit.  Tr. at p. 43.  Ms. Barrett testified that \nwith regard to the differences between the two living situations, the cell in the linear \nhousing is significantly smaller, there is no table, the toilet is in the cell providing less \nprivacy, there is no ability to roam or walk about, and there is no TV, microwave, or gym.  \nTr. at pp. 43-44.  Ms. Barrett first filed a complaint on January 22, but was told she could \nnot grieve the housing decision.  Tr. at pp. 45-46.  She then filed another complaint, also \non January 22, complaining that her privileges had been taken away by the move.  Tr. at \npp. 46-47.  In particular she complained that there was no TV, no tablets to make and \nreceive video chats, there were issues with the hot water, and there was only one shower \nand one phone on the unit, whereas the pod that she was transferred from had numerous \nphones and they were able to receive video chats.  Tr. at pp. 46-47.  She provided a \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 11 of 22\n   \n \ncomplaint to Corrections Officer Lamonica.  Id.  It was returned to her with an indication \nthat the female inmates were not entitled to privileges because they were in disciplinary \nhousing.  Id.  Inmate Barrett disagreed and indicated that she did not accept the resolution \nand handed the form back.  Id.  She heard nothing further.  Id.   \n  Barrett filed another complaint a day or two later, and according to her nothing \nhappened to that complaint either.  Tr. at pp. 47-48.  At one point Sgt. Bolicheck did come \nand speak with Barrett and another inmate, and asked how their privileges were taken \naway because they had been provided with what was required by the minimum standards. \nTr. at p. 49.   Barrett indicated that she felt that there was discrimination and she did not \naccept the proposed resolution.  Id.  Nothing happened after that.  Id.  According to Ms. \nBarrett, she filed numerous complaints, possibly three or four per week, dealing with \nissues involving recreation time, water issues, and related items.  Tr. at pp. 49-50.  She \nnever spoke with Lt. Harris until she wrote to her directly, at which point she was called \ndown the next day.  Tr. at p. 50.  She indicated that the Corrections Officers had stated \nthat her complaints were provided to the Sergeants, but were not sure what happened after \nthat.  Tr. at p. 51.  Lt. Harris reiterated the housing issue was not grievable, but that she \nwould look into providing more books, movies, and hot water.  Tr. at p. 60.   \n  Carrie Bachman testified next.  Ms. Bachman was incarcerated for approximately \ntwo months, initially in the pod and then in linear.  Tr. at p. 65.  She noted the difference \nbetween the two locations: with the pod unit they had access to a rec room, and ability to \nwalk and exercise because of the size of the space; had a microwave, TV, and video \ncalling, which allowed her to talk with her children; she had an individual room with a \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 12 of 22\n   \n \ndoor for privacy; and unlimited access to showers.  Tr. at pp. 65-66.  In linear, phones \nwere hard to use, limited to once every three days; there were no tablets for video calls; \nonly one hour of recreation outside; and the showers were โdisgusting.โ  Tr. at p. 66.   Ms. \nBachman testified that she filed a complaint the first day she went to the Henry linear unit \nregarding a video call that she was supposed to have with her children as a requirement \nof the Family Court.  Tr. at pp. 66-67.  The Corrections Officer who received the \ncomplaint asked her to try to deal with the situation.  Id.  She indicated that she did not \naccept that proposed resolution.  Tr. at p. 67.  It then went to the Sergeant, who explained \nthe conditions were caused by the attempt to separate the men from the women.  Tr. at p. \n68.  Ms. Bachman noted that she also did not accept this explanation, but after that heard \nnothing further with regard to her complaint.  Id.  She filed additional complaints \nregarding what she believed to be discrimination concerning the treatment between men \nand women, but received no response.  Tr. at pp. 68-69.  \n  Sabrina Davis was incarcerated at the Oneida County Correctional Facility from \nNovember 18, 2019 to March 12, 2020.  Tr. at p. 79.  She herself did not file a complaint \nregarding the linear unit, but claims to have witnessed other female inmates do so only to \nhave their complaints thrown in the trash.  Tr. at pp. 79-83. \n  Katrina Parkhurst was at the Correctional Facility from October 2019 to April \n2020.  Tr. at p. 88.  Upon her move from the podular unit to the linear unit, she \nimmediately filed a complaint regarding the unsanitary conditions, lack of TV, lack of \ntablets, and the lack of a microwave.  Tr. at pp. 88-89.  She was advised that her complaint \nwas not grievable.  Tr. at p. 89.  She indicated that she did not accept this resolution, and \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 13 of 22\n   \n \nheard nothing further.  Id.  She filed other complaints regarding an ant infestation which \nwas addressed โ she was moved twice in the linear unit.  Id. at p. 90.  However, when she \ncomplained with regard to lack of ability to go to the recreation room - noting that in the \nlinear unit they received recreation only for an hour at 7:00 in the morning - she was told \nthat that issue was not grievable.  Tr. at pp. 89-90.  She attempted to reach out to Lt. Harris \nbut was unable to do so.  Tr. at pp. 93-94.  \n  With that testimony, the Hearing concluded and counsel thereafter submitted their \npost-hearing briefs.  Dkt. Nos. 61 & 62.  The Defendantsโ position regarding exhaustion \nis straightforward.  First they note that the Oneida County Correctional Facility has in \nplace an established grievance policy and that Plaintiff, and potential class members, were \nall aware of that policy, as evidenced by the fact that they utilized it.  Dkt. No. 62, Defs.โ \nPost-Hearing Brief, at pp. 3-7.  Second, while they do not dispute that the grievance policy \nitself  excludes  housing  classification  decisions,  Defendants  maintain  that  what  the \nPlaintiff and the proposed class members are really quarreling about is their privileges \nand conditions in comparison with the male inmates, and prison conditions are subject to \nthe grievance policy.  Id. at p. 6.  Therefore, the Defendants argue that the Plaintiff has \nnot satisfied her burden to show that the grievance policy was unavailable.  Id. at pp. 30-\n34.   Defendants generally attack the credibility of the female inmates, and Ms. Barrett in \nparticular.  Id. at pp. 25 & 33-34.  They contend that while there may be some issues \nregarding the application of the grievance/complaint policy on a day-to-day basis, those \nissues are not material to the resolution of the case.  Id. at p. 11.  Since there is no evidence \npresented that any grievance actually proceeded to the Commission of Corrections level, \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 14 of 22\n   \n \nthey assert that exhaustion has not been established and therefore Plaintiffโs Equal \nProtection claim should be dismissed as a matter of law.  Id. at pp. 10 & 30.   \n  The position of counsel for the Plaintiff and potential class members is equally \ndirect.  Counsel argues that, as clearly established at the Hearing, the grievance process \nof the Facility simply did not apply to discriminatory housing decisions.  Dkt. No. 61, \nPl.โs Post-Hearing Brief, at pp. 3 & 11-13.  Further, Plaintiff contends that the grievance \nprocess of the Oneida County Correctional Facility was unclear and poorly administered, \nand as a practical matter was unavailable to Plaintiff and members of the class.  Id. at pp. \n13-20.  For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that Plaintiffโs counsel has \npresented the more compelling argument. \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Legal Standard \n  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (โPLRAโ) provides, in pertinent part, that โ[n]o \naction shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [section 1983 of this title], \nor any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional \nfacility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง \n1997e(a).   The Supreme Court has held that โthe PLRAโs exhaustion requirement applies \nto all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or \nparticular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.โ  \nPorter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002) (citation omitted).  Exhaustion in prisoner \ncases covered by ยง 1997e(a) is mandatory.  Id. at 524; Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850, \n1857 (2016) (stating that mandatory language of ยง 1997e(a) forecloses judicial discretion \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 15 of 22\n   \n \nto  craft  exceptions  to  the  requirement).    Furthermore,  ยง  1997e(a)  requires  โproper \nexhaustion,โ which means using all steps of the administrative process and complying \nwith โdeadlines and other critical procedural rules.โ  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90, \n93 (2006).  โThe exhaustion inquiry thus requires [a court to] look at the state prison \nprocedures and the prisonerโs grievance to determine whether the prisoner has complied \nwith those procedures.โ  Espinal v. Goord, 558 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing Jones \nv. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. at 88-90).  \n  A  prisonerโs  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies  may  nonetheless  be \nexcused if remedies were unavailable to the inmate.  Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. at 1858.  \nAs the Supreme Court recently stated, โ[a]n inmate . . . must exhaust available remedies, \nbut need not exhaust unavailable ones.โ  Id.  One direct exception to the exhaustion \nrequirement exists in situations where the exhaustion procedure specifically provides that \nthe dispute in question is non-grievable, or where the inmate establishes, in a non-\nconclusory fashion, that he was so advised by the prison officials.  Jones v. Bock, 549 \nU.S. at 218 (โit is the prisonโs requirements, and not the PLRA, that define the boundaries \nof  proper  exhaustion.โ);  Beckhorn  v.  New  York  State  Depโt  of  Corr.  and  Cmty. \nSupervision, 2019 WL 234774, at *9 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2019) (rejecting argument that \nplaintiff should have engaged the grievance process where regulation provided issue was \nnon-grievable, and therefore โthat process was not โavailableโ toโ plaintiff).   \nBeyond  that,  the  Supreme  Court  stated  three  potential  circumstances  where \nadministrative remedies may be unavailable: (1) where the administrative procedure \ntechnically exists but operates as a โdead end โ with officers unable or consistently \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 16 of 22\n   \n \nunwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmatesโ; (2) where the administrative \nscheme is โso opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of useโ; and (3) \nwhere  prison  administrators  โthwart  inmates  from  taking  advantage  of  a  grievance \nprocess through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.โ  Ross v. Blake, 136 S. \nCt. at 1859-60.  \n  In a class action such as this, is not necessary to show that each member of the \nclass exhausted their administrative remedies.  Rather, under the doctrine of vicarious \nexhaustion, the PLRAโs requirements are satisfied so long as one member of the proposed \nclass complied with the Facilityโs exhaustion regulations.  Barfield v. Cook, 2019 WL \n3562021, at *7-8 (D. Conn. Aug. 6, 2019) (collecting cases).  Therefore, to defeat \nPlaintiffโs Equal Protection claim, Defendants must establish that no Plaintiff or class \nmember exhausted available remedies.  Id. at *8.   \n  As for the procedure to resolve exhaustion issues, the Second Circuit has ruled that \na plaintiff in a lawsuit governed by the PLRA is not entitled to a jury trial on disputed \nfactual  issues  relating  to  his  exhaustion  of  administrative  remedies;  rather,  PLRA \nexhaustion is a matter of judicial administration.  Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d at 308-10.  \nThe defendant bears the burden of proving that the administrative remedies available to \nthe plaintiff were not exhausted prior to the initiation of a civil action.  Howard v. Goord, \n1999 WL 1288679, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 1999).  However, once a defendant has \nproduced reliable evidence that such remedies were available to the plaintiff and the \nplaintiff nevertheless failed to exhaust those remedies, the plaintiff must then counter the \ndefendantโs proof by showing that, as to him or her, the remedy was unavailable.  Smith \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 17 of 22\n   \n \nv. Kelly, 985 F. Supp. 2d 275, 284 (N.D.N.Y. 2013).  โAs a result, practically speaking, \nwhile the burden on this affirmative defense remains at all times on the defendant, the \nplaintiff may sometimes have to adduce evidence in order to defeat it.โ  Id.   \nB.  Analysis \n  As noted supra, the Defendants have the burden of establishing that the grievance \nprocess was available to Plaintiff and the members of the class, and that everyone failed \nto utilize it.  In considering the issue, the Court considers the grievance policy both on its \nface and in its application.  The Court finds that this burden has not been met for two \nreasons. \n1. The Allegations were Not Grievable \n   Oneida County Correctional Facilityโs written policy regarding non-grievance of \nhousing decisions is somewhat unclear - it specifically refers only to โAdministrative \nSegregation Housing decisionsโ; however, the testimony of Lt. Harris was unequivocal \nthat the female Plaintiff and class members could not grieve the decision to send them \nfrom pods to linear housing cells.  This understanding is also confirmed in the responses \nto some of the inmatesโ complaints that were maintained, and is consistent with the inmate \ntestimony at the Hearing regarding the responses they received from specific corrections \nofficers regarding other non-retained complaints.  Therefore it is clear that the issue which \nis at the center of Plaintiffโs class action claim - the decision to house women in linear \nhousing because of their status, while keeping similarly situated male inmates in the pod, \nwith all its advantages - is one that could not be grieved through the Oneida County \nCorrectional Facility complaint and grievance process.  Accordingly, pursuant to the \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 18 of 22\n   \n \nFacilityโs policy and its admitted application in this case, Defendants have simply not \nestablished that the issue sought to be litigated was in fact grievable.  Owens v. Keeling, \n461 F.3d 763, 769 (6th Cir. 2006) (โThe non-grievability of Owensโs classification-\nrelated complaint through the grievance process makes that remedy unavailable under the \nPLRA, and thus he does not have to pursue that remedy to exhaust his claim.โ). \n  Defendants argue that even though the Plaintiff and class members could not \ngrieve their housing, they could have grieved the conditions in the linear unit, and that \nreally is the heart of their Complaint.  Such an argument fails both logically and factually.  \nFactually, while some of the ancillary conditions of linear housing in H-block, such as \nwater issues, reading materials, phones, and tablets, could theoretically be separated from \nthe housing decision, most of the conditions complained of cannot.  The primary issues - \nsize of the block, freedom of movement, lack of privacy, and recreation issues - were \nconditions that were inherent in the differences between the two housing situations and \ncould not be alleviated absent a move back to the pod which, again, could not be \naccomplished through any complaint or grievance procedure.  It is that housing decision \nwhich is the focus of the legal claim, and the resultant restrictive living conditions are \nsimply part of the damages which flow from that alleged constitutional violation.  See \nTaylor v. New York City Depโt of Corr., 2021 WL 852067, at *3 (2d Cir. Mar. 8, 2021) \n(focus of exhaustion inquiry is on whether inmate did or could grieve those allegations \nthat โform the basis of this lawsuit.โ). \n  Legally, Defendantsโ argument splits Plaintiffโs claims in a way that is not proper.  \nIt is again important to understand that the Plaintiff and class members in this case are \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 19 of 22\n   \n \nnot asserting a separate Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment claim.4  To \naccept Defendantsโ exhaustion argument would be similar to the argument that an inmate, \nplaced  in  administrative  segregation  as  a  result  of  a  non-grievable  disciplinary \nproceeding, nevertheless must grieve the resulting conditions of the imposed confinement \nand, if he or she does not, they would forfeit their due process claim regarding the \ndisciplinary proceeding.  The Second Circuit has rejected this precise theory.  Davis v. \nBarrett, 576 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2009) (โDavisโs failure to grieve the conditions of his \nconfinement is no bar to his due process claim because the conditions of his confinement \nare not the basis on which he alleges he suffered harm.โ). \n  An analogous rationale has been applied by courts dealing with the argument that \ninmates are required to grieve the effects of an assault by staff, even where the inmate \ngrievance process exempts staff or inmate assaults from its purview:   \nIn so arguing, defendants attempt to slice plaintiffโs claims too thinly. The \nIGRP Directive provides simply that โ[i]nmate allegations of physical ... \nharassment by either staff or inmates are not subject to the IGRP process.โ \nIGRP Directive at 6. The IGRP Directive does not require inmates to parse \nout and exhaust any grievable aspects of their assault complaints before \nfiling suit. If we were to adopt defendantsโ interpretation of the PLRA, \nvictims of assault at Rikers Island (the vast majority of whom have no \ntraining in the law) would be required to consider whether any of the \ncontributing factors to their assault are grievable, file a grievance related to \nthose factors and pursue all available appeals (while not referencing their \nassault allegations in those grievances, lest they be deemed ungrievable), \nand would be barred from filing suit in this court until they complete this \nprocess. That mechanism for relief would be so complex that โno ordinary \nprisoner [could] discern or navigate it.โ   \n \n \n4  If they were, such a claim would require exhaustion under Oneida Countyโs policies.  See Lev v. Lewin, 2020 WL \n93432, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2020). \n19 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 20 of 22\n   \n \nTaylor v. City of New York, 2018 WL 1737626, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2018) (citing \nRoss v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. at 1859-60).  Accord Ramirez v. Lewis, 2020 WL 1303454, at \n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (holding that where plaintiffโs claims for excessive force, \nstrip search, and deliberate indifference all arose out of the same March 29, 2018 incident, \nthe IGRP procedure does not require inmates to separate out and exhaust any grievable \naspects of their assault complaints before filing suit).  \n2. The Grievance Process was Unavailable to the Plaintiff Class \n  Even were the Court to conclude that certain ancillary issues associated with linear \nhousing would need to be exhausted to be part of Plaintiffโs equal protection claim, \nDefendants have nonetheless failed to establish a viable exhaustion defense.  This is \nbecause the credible evidence at the Hearing established that several of the proposed class \nmembers did attempt to grieve aspects of their housing after being transferred to linear \nhousing but that their complaints appear never to have been properly processed.  As a \nresult, the grievance process at the Facility was โpractically speaking, incapable of use.โ  \nRoss v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. at 1859. \nThe evidence established that several female inmates attempted to grieve issues \nrelated to their housing in the linear unit but encountered roadblocks in doing so.  This \nincluded Ms. Terrell, who was advised she could not grieve the fact that she was denied \nprivileges after the transfer; Ms. Bachman who attempted to grieve the lack of video \ncalling and was told to deal with it, with no further response; and Ms. Parkhurst, who \nfiled a complaint regarding unsanitary conditions, lack of TV, lack of tablets, and other \n20 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 21 of 22\n   \n \nissues, and who was also advised that the complaint was not grievable.  When she \nchallenged that decision and tried to speak with Lt. Harris, she obtained no response.  \n  Lt. Harris also candidly conceded issues with the grievance process.  During her \ntestimony, she was confronted with logbook entries noting complaints lodged by a \nnumber of female inmates of which Lt. Harris never became aware, but should have under \nthe Facilityโs established grievance procedure.  See Tr. at pp. 29-33.  Lt. Harris further \ntestified that under the established procedure if initial complaints made by inmates to \nhousing unit staff were not properly processed there was no formal way for the inmates \nto proceed further with having a grievance formally filed.  Id. at p. 34.  Harris recognized \nthat some inmate complaints were not properly being addressed and addressed the matter \nwith a supervisor.  Id. at p. 36.  She testified that there remain ongoing issues of this sort, \nhowever.  Id.  The evidence in the record thus established that with at least some \nregularity, initial inmate complaints were not properly processed, and those inmates, \ntherefore, were never given the opportunity to formalize those complaints into grievances.  \nInmates in this position were thus left unable (or at the very least unsure how) to file \ngrievances that would satisfy the Facilityโs formal grievance process.  This effectively \nrendered the grievance process unavailable to members of the class.5   \n  Defendants attack the credibility of Plaintiff and the class members, but after \nobserving them and considering the evidence, I find their testimony to be worthy of belief.  \nDefendantsโ argument that โPlaintiffs have not provided any documentary evidence to \n \n5 The fact that some inmates knew from past experience how to informally present issues to Lt. Harris, does not \nexcuse the failure of the grievance process at the Facility to afford inmates an efficient vehicle for raising these \nconcerns.  If anything, the fact that this occurred highlights the inefficiencies in the system.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 73   Filed 03/11/21   Page 22 of 22\n   \n \ncorroborate baseless claims that complaints or grievances (involving the issues at bar) \nwere not addressed,โ Defs.โ Post-Hearing Brief at p. 33, is not accurate.  Plaintiffโs \ncounsel referenced records of complaints that were logged but never made it to the Lt.โs \nattention, and were not returned to the inmates.  This was a fact that concerned Lt. Harris, \nand concerns the Court.  Nevertheless, it is consistent with the generally understood \npremise that the move to linear was simply not grievable.    \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated herein, it is hereby \n  RECOMMENDED,  that  the  Court  find  that  the  alleged  failure  to  exhaust \nadministrative remedies is not a basis for dismissal of this action; and it is further  \n  ORDERED,  that  the  Clerk  of  the  Court  serve  a  copy  of  this  Report-\nRecommendation upon the parties to this action. \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1), the parties have fourteen (14) days within which \nto file written objections to the foregoing report.

We further observe that our sister circuits have held that intermediate scrutiny is \nappropriate. See, e.g., Harrison v. Kernan, 971 F.3d 1069, 1076โ80 (9th Cir. 2020); Roubideaux v. N.D.

But the \nโSupreme Court has created a lower level of scrutiny in determining the constitutionality of prison rules,โ generally \nrequiring only that prison action โbe reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.โ Allen v.

But see Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 509, 125 S.Ct. 1141, 160 L.Ed.2d 949 \n(2005) (holding that โexpress racial classificationsโ remain subject to strict scrutiny even in the prison context). \nAccordingly, our cases apply this Turner standard โto the assessment of equal protection claims in the prison \nsetting.โ Benjamin v. Coughlin, 905 F.2d 571, 575 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Allen, 100 F.3d at 261. In light of the \nabsence of briefing on this issue, we nevertheless assume for purposes of this appeal that intermediate scrutiny \napplies. \n \n3  We also note that our understanding from oral argument is that the factual record on this question has been further \n  developed since the district courtโs order in a way that may alter the results of this analysis. \n \n4  We note that these statements in both Women Prisoners and Klinger were not core to the holding of either case, as \n  both courts concluded that the women and men were not similarly situated.

Nevertheless, the required segregation of inmates by gender and the deference \nowed to prison administrators leads us to find these statements persuasive. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  5 \n ",

INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiffs Nicole Williamson, Sarah Barrett, and Shannon Terrell (collectively\n\"Plaintiffs\"), on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, bring this action for alleged\nviolations of their rights to Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution (Count I), and violations of their rights under Article I, ยง 11 of the New York\nState Constitution (Count II).  See Dkt. No. 1 at ยถยถ 63โ64.  On May 21, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 2 of 27\nmotion for an order certifying this proceeding as a class action.  See Dkt. No. 10.  On June 10,\n2020, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking an order requiring Defendants\nRobert Maciol and Lisa Zurek (collectively \"Defendants\") to transfer Plaintiffs to a less restrictive\npodular style housing unit and providing Plaintiffs with substantially equivalent privileges and\nbenefits to those provided to their male equivalents.  See Dkt. No. 18.  Defendants do not oppose\nPlaintiffs' motion for certification of the class, see Dkt. No. 22, but do oppose Plaintiffs' motion\nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Dkt. No. 23-4.  \nII. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are currently housed at the Oneida County Jail, which is a correctional facility\nlocated in Oriskany, New York.  See Dkt. No. 18-3 at 2.  The Oneida County Jail is approximately\ntwo-hundred years old, and is comprised of various housing units.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 3.  As of\nJune 17, 2020, the Oneida County Jail held 228 inmates, comprising of 202 males and 26 females. \nSee id. at 2. \nAll inmates are classified as either \"general custody\" or \"closed custody.\"  See id.  In\ndetermining an inmate's security classification, the Oneida County Jail assigns points based on an\ninmate's present charge(s), criminal history, legal status, incarceration status, disciplinary record\nand the severity of that record, as well as the inmate's mental health, disabilities, suicide attempts,\npropensity for violence, and vulnerability.  See Dkt. No. 18-3 at 70.  Inmates who score between\none and ten points are classified as general custody, and inmates who score above ten points are\nclassified as closed custody.  See id.  Closed custody inmates receive only the minimum privileges\nrequired by the New York State Minimum Standards, and general custody inmates receive all\nprivileges as set forth by facility rules and regulations.  See id. at 70โ71. \n \n2\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 27\nOf particular importance to Plaintiffs' claims are the housing units at the Oneida County\nJail, namely, the \"podular units\" (\"pods\") and \"linear housing units.\"  Id. at 3.  A pod contains\nfifty-six individual cells, and the cells surround a central common area with benches and tables. \nSee id.  Each cell in the pods is approximately eight feet by ten feet in size, equipped with a bed,\ntoilet, sink, desk, and chair, and has a clear glass window facing outside that is approximately one\nfoot by three feet in size.  See id.  Each pod has seven telephones and eight showers for inmates to\naccess.  See id.  There is a recreation unit attached to the pods.  See Dkt. No. 18-2 at 9, 15. \nInmates housed in pods also have access to two cable televisions, a room containing games and\nbooks, videophone equipment, a water cooler with hot and cold water, a microwave, and air\nconditioning.  See id. at 9โ11.\nThe linear housing units contain cells that are approximately five feet by seven feet in size,\nequipped with a bed, toilet, sink with hot and cold running water, have bars in front of the cells,\nand contain no windows.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 3.  H-Block consists of forty linear cells (with\ntwenty cells on each side) and C-Block consists of thirty-two cells (sixteen on each side).  See id. \nThe cell blocks have an inner and outer catwalk.  See id. at 4.  Each cell block has one shower and\none telephone.  See id. at 3.1  Inmates housed in the linear housing units have access to one\ntelevision with DVDs and movies, video tablets, a cabinet with games and books, water, fans, and\naccess to a recreation area.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 6โ9.  There have been plumbing incidents in both\nblocks, including toilet water flooding the unit.  See Dkt. No. 18-2 at 9โ10.  \n1 Plaintiffs state that the H-Block and C-Block units, both linear housing units, are\nidentical with the exception that the Henry Unit contains four more cells and has one additional\nshower.  Plaintiffs state that female inmates have been transferred between these units several\ntimes.  See Dkt. No. 18-2 at 3, 10, 16.\n3\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 27\nIn addition to housing, Plaintiffs' claims involve the benefits and privileges that the general\ncustody women receive.  These benefits and privileges include, but are not limited to, recreation\ntime, televisions, library access, digital tablets, the ability to cook food, water coolers, air\nconditioners, work assignments, and trustee status.  See Dkt. No. 18-5 at 9โ11; Dkt. No. 23-4 at\n4โ5.\nPrior to January 2020, all female inmates were housed in a single pod unit.  See Dkt. No.\n23-2 at 4.  In October 2019, the Commission of Correction completed its yearly \"Minimum\nStandard Evaluation\" of the Oneida County Jail.  See id. at 4, 15โ18.  The Commission reviewed\nthe classification standards, and required action to be taken because all female inmates were\n\"housed together on the same unit regardless of classification level.\"  Id. at 15.  In January 2020,\nall female inmates were moved to linear housing units and separated based on classification.  See\nid. at 5.  At that time, thirteen women were classified as general custody and fifteen were\nclassified as closed custody.  See id. at 2.  General custody women were moved to H-Block\n(Henry Right), and closed custody women were moved to H-Block (Henry Left); in April 2020,\nthe entire unit was moved to C-Block.  See id.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Class Certification\n\"A district court enjoys broad discretion when it comes to resolving questions of class\ncertification because it 'is often in the best position to assess the propriety of the class and has the\nability . . . to alter or modify the class, create subclasses, and decertify the class whenever\nwarranted.'\" V.W. by and through Williams v. Conway, 236 F. Supp. 3d 554, 572 (N.D.N.Y. 2017)\n(quoting Sumitomo Copper Litig. v.

Kelly,\n609 F.3d 467, 476 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 41\n(2d Cir. 2006)).  Rule 23 sets forth four requirements for class certification:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable, (2) questions of law and fact are common to the\nclass, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims of defenses of the class, and (4) the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the class.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \"A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate [its]\ncompliance with the Rule.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351 (2011) (\"Rule 23\ndoes not set forth a mere pleading standard\").    \n\"To certify a class seeking injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs must also show\nDefendants have 'acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final\ninjunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.' \nPlaintiffs must establish each of these facts by at least a preponderance of the evidence.\"  J.B. v.\nOnondaga Cnty., 401 F. Supp. 3d 320, 330 (N.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting Brown, 609 F.3d at 476).\nAdditionally, \"courts have written a third, 'implied requirement' into the Rule: a party\nseeking certification must demonstrate that the proposed class is 'ascertainable.'\" V.W., 236 F.\nSupp. 3d at 573 (quoting Sykes v. Mel Harris & Assocs., LLC, 285 F.R.D. 279, 287 (S.D.N.Y.\n2012)).  \"Under this additional element, '[a]n identifiable class exists if its members can be\nascertained by reference to objective criteria.'\"  Id. (quoting Stinson v. City of N.Y., 282 F.R.D.\n360, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)).\n5\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 27\n\"In sum, '[c]lass certification is appropriate where the proposed class meets, by a\npreponderance of the evidence following a court's \"rigorous analysis,\" the requirements of Rule\n23(a) and the proposed class constitutes one of the types of classes enumerated in Rule 23(b).'\"\nV.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 573 (quoting Stinson, 282 F.R.D. at 367).\nPlaintiffs seek to certify a class composed of \"all female inmates who are, or should be,\nclassified as 'general custody' and who are now, or will be, incarcerated at the Oneida County\nJail.\"  Dkt. No. 10-1 at ยถ 7.  Defendants do not oppose the motion for certification of the class. \nDkt. No. 22.  Nevertheless, because a party seeking class certification must affirmatively\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of Rule 23, the relevant findings are based on\nPlaintiffs' submissions in support of this motion and are set forth below.\n1. Numerosity\nThe first element of certification under Rule 23 requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that \"the\nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  This\ninquiry is \"not strictly mathematical\" but rather requires a court to\ntake into account the context of the particular case, in particular\nwhether a class is superior to joinder based on other relevant factors\nincluding: (i) judicial economy, (ii) geographic dispersion, (iii) the\nfinancial resources of class members, (iv) their ability to sue\nseparately, and (v) request for injunctive relief that would involve\nfuture class members.\nPa.

In other words, \"[t]he numerosity\nrequirement in Rule 23(a)(1) does not mandate that joinder of all parties be impossibleโonly that\nthe difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class make use of the class action\n6\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 7 of 27\nappropriate.\"  Cent.

MerckโMedco Managed\nCare, LLC, 504 F.3d 229, 244โ45 (2d Cir. 2007). \nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs need only \"show some evidence of or reasonably estimate\nthe number of class members\" and \"need not show the exact number.\"  Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 935. \nSeven hundred and thirteen women were admitted to the Oneida County Jail in 2019.  See Dkt.\nNo. 10-4 at 9.  Therefore, the Court may presume numerosity.  See Pa. Pub. Sch. Emps.' Ret. Sys.,\n772 F.3d at 120 (\"Numerosity is presumed for classes larger than forty members\").\nIn addition, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that joinder is impractical based on contextual\nfactors.  Because of the \"'\"fluid composition\" of the prison population'โnew detainees are\narrested and arraigned, and others are released, each dayโjoining all . . . detainees in [the county]\nverges on impossible.\"  J.B., 401 F. Supp. 3d at 331 (quoting Clarkson v. Coughlin, 783 F. Supp.\n789, 797 (S.D.N.Y. 1992)); see also V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 574 (\"[W]hile the class members\nwill obviously share the same geographic area, the ability of any one individual member of the\nclass or the subclass to maintain an individual suit will necessarily be limited by the simple reality\nthat they are being detained as part of the criminal justice process\"). \nFurthermore, \"[b]eing incarcerated, and fighting criminal cases, also saps [the proposed\nclasses'] financial resources and affords them 'little freedom in their daily lives,' limiting their time\nand ability to consult civil counsel.\"  J.B., 401 F. Supp. 3d at 331 (quoting A.T. by and through\nTillman v. Harder, 298 F. Supp. 3d 391, 407 (N.D.N.Y. 2018)).  Moreover, litigating this suit as a\nclass action promotes judicial economy, because it \"avoids multiple individual suits that raise the\nsame issues and seek the same relief.\"  V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 574.  \nAs such, Plaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the class is\nsufficiently numerous such that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n7\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 8 of 27\n2. Commonality\nThe second element of certification under Rule 23 requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that\nthere \"are questions of law or fact common to the class.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).\nPlaintiffs contend that the \"questions of law or fact common to the class\" are as follows:\ni) Whether the Defendants violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal\nProtection rights of the putative class by housing them in the old\nstyle housing unit instead of the pods;\nii) Whether Defendants violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal\nProtection rights of the putative class by denying them the\nprivileges, services, and programs provided to male inmates at the\njail;\niii) Whether the Defendants have a genuine and exceedingly\npersuasive justification for their failure to treat putative class\nmembers and similarly situated men equally;\niv) Whether the Defendants' denial of pod style housing and its\nconcomitant benefits, services and programs to the putative class is\nsubstantially related to the achievement of important government\ninterests; and\nv) Whether the Defendants violate the rights of the putative class\nunder the New York Constitution.\nDkt. No. 10-1 at 10โ11.\nThis element \"does not require all questions of law or fact to be common,\" and \"even a\nsingle common question will suffice.\"  Sykes, 285 F.R.D. at 286; see also Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at\n349โ50 (explaining that class members' claims \"must depend upon a common contention . . . of\nsuch a nature that it is capable of class wide resolutionโwhich means that the determination of its\ntruth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one\nstroke\").  \"Plaintiffs may satisfy the commonality requirement with 'significant proof' that a\n8\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 9 of 27\ngeneral policy or practice caused the alleged violations of class members' rights.\"  J.B., 401 F.\nSupp. 3d at 331 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 353).  \nPlaintiffs' claims challenge Defendants' policies and procedures that \"deny all putative\nplaintiffs equal access to the housing and programs, benefits, and services afforded to similarly\nsituated men.\"  Dkt. No. 1-1 at 12.  Each member of the putative class is subjected to the same\npolicies and practices.  See Dkt. No. 10-3 at 3โ4, 9โ11, 16โ17.  Plaintiffs further allege that these\n\"policies and practices are not substantially related to achievement of any important government\ninterest.\"  Dkt. No. 10-1 at 12.  The common answers to these questions will drive the resolution\nof the current litigation โ whether Defendants' conduct violates the Constitution, federal law, or\nstate law, and whether Defendants should therefore be enjoined from engaging in that course of\nconduct.  See, e.g., V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 575.  \nAs \"numerous courts have concluded that the commonality requirement can be satisfied by\nproof of the existence of systemic polices and practices that allegedly expose inmates to a\nsubstantial risk of harm,\" Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 681 (9th Cir. 2014), this Court finds that\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that there are questions of law or\nfact common to the class or subclass.  \n3. Typicality\nThe third element of certification under Rule 23 requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate whether\n\"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  \"Typicality requires that the claims of the class representatives\nbe typical of those of the class[.]  [It] is satisfied when each class member's claim arises from the\nsame course of events and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the\ndefendant's liability.\"  Cent. States Se. and Sw. Areas Health and Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco\n9\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 10 of 27\nManaged Care, L.L.C., 504 F.3d 229, 245 (2d Cir. 2007) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \n\"Generally speaking, minor variations in the fact patterns underlying the individual claims will not\npreclude a finding of typicality unless there are 'unique defenses' that threaten to become the focus\nof the litigation.\"  V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 576 (citing Baffa v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Sec.\nCorp., 222 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 2000)).\nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden on this element for substantially the same reasons as\nset forth above.  The members of the class share the same legal arguments because their claims\nare based on the common application of certain challenged policies and procedures.  See id.; see\nalso Sykes, 285 F.R.D at 287 (\"The commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to\nmerge such that similar considerations inform the analysis for both prerequisites\").  \"As with\ncommonality. . . '[w]hen it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected\nboth the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented the typicality requirement is\nusually met irrespective' of such 'minor variations in the fact patterns underlying the individual\nclaims.'\"  J.B., 401 F. Supp. 3d at 332 (finding that typicality exists even when \"[s]ome class\nmembers have not yet been arraigned\") (quoting Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936โ37); see also Tillman,\n298 F. Supp. 3d at 410 (certifying class where the representatives of the class and the subclasses\nhave been subjected to the same common course of treatment by the same officials on the basis of\nthe same policies).\nAs such, Plaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the claims\nor defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\n4. Adequacy of Representation\nThe fourth element of certification under Rule 23 requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate\nwhether \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" \n10\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 11 of 27\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  \"[T]he adequacy requirement is twofold: the proposed class\nrepresentative must have an interest in vigorously pursing the claims of the class, and must have\nno interests antagonistic to the interests of other class members.\"  Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG,\n443 F.3d 253, 268 (2d Cir. 2006).  A conflict of interest between the parties and the class they\nseek to represent \"must be fundamental, and speculative conflict should be disregarded at the class\ncertification stage.\"  Sykes, 285 F.R.D. at 287.  Only a conflict \"that goes to the very subject\nmatter of the litigation will defeat a party's claim of representative status.\"  Stinson, 282 F.R.D. at\n371.  In addition, class counsel must be \"qualified, experienced and able to conduct the litigation.\"\n Baffa, 222 F.3d at 60.\nPlaintiffs have carried their burden on this element.  As discussed previously, the\nrepresentatives of the class have been subjected to the same policies and procedures.  Each named\nPlaintiff has expressed a desire to seek prospective injunctive relief from these policies, a benefit\nthat will effect any woman detained at the Oneida County Jail in the future.  See Dkt. No. 10-3 at\n5, 12, 18.  Furthermore, these Plaintiffs have no foreseeable conflicts of interest with other class\nmembers.  Moreover, class counsel have extensive litigation experience in the class action\ncontext.  See, e.g., V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 577 (collecting cases); J.B., 401 F. Supp. 3d at 332\n(\"Plaintiff's counsel, attorneys with the Legal Services of Central New York, have extensive\nexperience in class action litigation and have previously represented classes of detainees seeking\nsystemic reform in federal court class action lawsuits\") (collecting cases).  \nAs such, Plaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nqualifying representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n5. Rule 23(b)\n11\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 12 of 27\nPlaintiffs rely on Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \"the party opposing the class has\nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2).  \"'The key to the (b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory\nremedy warrantedโthe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful\nonly as to all of the class members or as to none of them.'\"  V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 577 (quoting\nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360).  \nHere, Plaintiffs seek \"a single injunction or declaratory judgment\" that \"would provide\nrelief to each member of the class,\" making certification under Rule 23(b)(2) appropriate.  V.W.,\n236 F. Supp. 3d at 577 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360) (certifying Rule 23(b)(2) class where\n\"the members of the class and the subclass would benefit from the same remedyโan order\nenjoining defendants from application of the policies and practices resulting in the deprivations at\nissue\"); see also Dkt. No. 10-1 at 14โ15. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have met their burden on this\nelement.\n6. Ascertainability\nPlaintiffs have also satisfied this requirement.  The members of the class are readily\nidentifiable pursuant to objective criteria, including, but not limited to, the records maintained by\nDefendants.  See V.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 577.  In sum, Plaintiffs have affirmatively demonstrated\ntheir compliance with the requirements for class certification.  \nB. Preliminary Injunction\n1. Standard of Review\nA preliminary injunction \"is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be\ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\"  Moore v.\n12\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 13 of 27\nConsol. Edison Co., 409 F.3d 506, 510 (2d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).  \"A decision to grant or\ndeny a preliminary injunction is committed to the discretion of the district court.\"  Polymer Tech.\nCorp. v. Mimran, 37 F.3d 74, 78 (2d Cir. 1994) (citation omitted).\nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish \"'a threat of irreparable injury and\neither (1) a probability of success on the merits or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the\nmerits of the claims to make them a fair ground of litigation, and a balance of hardships tipping\ndecidedly in favor of the moving party.'\"  Allied Office Supplies, Inc. v. Lewandowski, 261 F.\nSupp. 2d 107, 108 (D. Conn. 2003) (quoting Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, 322 F.3d 130, 135\n(2d Cir. 2003)).  \"Irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction.\"  Rodriguez ex rel. Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 233-34 (2d Cir.\n1999) (internal quotations omitted).  \nMoreover, in certain circumstances, an even higher standard applies.  \"The moving party\nmust make a 'clear' or 'substantial' showing of a likelihood of success where (1) the injunction\nsought 'will alter, rather than maintain, the status quo' โ i.e., is properly characterized as a\n'mandatory' rather than 'prohibitory' injunction; or (2) the injunction sought 'will provide the\nmovant with substantially all the relief sought, and that relief cannot be undone even if the\ndefendant prevails at a trial on the merits.'\"  Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir. 1996)\n(quoting Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Enter., Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 33โ34 (2d Cir. 1995)).2  The\nUnited States Supreme Court has distinguished between mandatory and prohibitory injunctions by\ndescribing a mandatory injunction as one that orders a party to \"take action,\" whereas a\n2 As the Second Circuit has noted, \"'[t]he distinction between mandatory and prohibitory\ninjunctions is not without ambiguities or critics,' . . . and that in a close case an injunction can be\nframed in mandatory or prohibitory terms[.]\"  Jolly, 76 F.3d at 473โ74 (internal quotations and\ncitation omitted). \n13\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 14 of 27\nprohibitory injunction would \"restrain\" a party from unlawful action.  Meghrig v. KFC W., Inc.,\n516 U.S. 479, 484 (1996).  \nPlaintiffs want the Court to \"restrain\" Defendants from continuing to allegedly violate the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Constitution of New York State. \nBut the alleged discrimination lies precisely in Defendants' inaction (i.e., the failure of Defendants\nto provide Plaintiffs with the same housing and benefits as similarly-situated male inmates), and\nsuch alleged discrimination could only be \"restrained\" by this Court ordering Defendants to take\npositive action.  The injunction that Plaintiffs seek would command Defendants move them from\nthe linear style housing to pod housing and to provide Plaintiffs a different set of privileges and\nbenefits, thus altering the status quo \"by commanding some positive act.\"  Tom Doherty Assocs.,\n60 F.3d at 34.  The Court agrees with Defendants that the injunction sought by Plaintiffs is a\nmandatory injunction, and thus, this higher standard applies.  See, e.g., N.J. v. New York, 872 F.\nSupp. 2d 204, 211-12 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (\"'This higher standard is particularly appropriate when a\nplaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction against a government body such as a school district'\")\n(quotation and other citations omitted).\nThe Supreme Court has observed that the decision of whether to award preliminary\ninjunctive relief is often based on \"procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less\ncomplete than in a trial on the merits.\"  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nConsonant with this view, the Second Circuit has held that a district court may consider hearsay\nevidence when deciding whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief.  See Mullins v. City of New\nYork, 626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d Cir. 2010).  Therefore, the strict standards for affidavits under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence and in support of summary judgment under Rule 56(c)(4) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure requiring that an affidavit be made on personal knowledge are\n14\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 15 of 27\nnot expressly applicable to affidavits in support of preliminary injunctions.  See Mullins v. City of\nNew York, 634 F. Supp. 2d 373, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (citations omitted).  Nevertheless, courts\nhave wide discretion to assess the affidavit's credibility and generally consider affidavits made on\ninformation and belief to be insufficient for a preliminary injunction.  See 11A Charles Alan\nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2949 (2d ed. 1995); Mullins, 634 F. Supp. 2d at\n373, 385, 390 n.115 (declining to fully credit the \"defendants' hearsay affidavit\" and noting that\nwhile the court \"may consider hearsay evidence in a preliminary injunction hearing . . . , a court\nmay weigh evidence based on whether such evidence would be admissible under the Federal\nRules of Evidence\"). \nMoreover, even if Plaintiffs demonstrate irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on\nthe merits, the remedy of preliminary injunctive relief may still be withheld if equity so requires. \n\"An award of an injunction is not something a plaintiff is entitled to as a matter of right, but rather\nit is an equitable remedy issued by a trial court, within the broad bounds of its discretion, after it\nweighs the potential benefits and harm to be incurred by the parties from the granting or denying\nof such relief.\"  Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Cohen, 173 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). \nImportantly, the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") establishes additional\nrequirements for granting a preliminary injunction involving prison conditions.  The PLRA\nspecifies that:\nIn any civil action with respect to prison conditions, to the extent\notherwise authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary\nrestraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive relief.\nPreliminary injunctive relief must be narrowly drawn, extend no\nfurther than necessary to correct the harm the court finds requires\npreliminary relief, and be the least intrusive means necessary to\ncorrect that harm.  The court shall give substantial weight to any\nadverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal\njustice system caused by the preliminary relief and shall respect the\n15\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 16 of 27\nprinciples of comity . . . in tailoring any preliminary relief.\nPreliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date\nthat is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings\nrequired . . . for the entry of prospective relief and makes the order\nfinal before the expiration of the 90-day period.\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(2).  The comity principles to which the Act refers include the following:\nThe court shall not order any prospective relief that requires or\npermits a government official to exceed his or her authority under\nState or local law or otherwise violates State or local law, unless- \n(i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in violation of State\nor local law;\n(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right; \nand\n(iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the Federal right.\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(B).\nImportantly, in the prison context, \"'a request for injunctive relief must always be viewed\nwith great caution so as not to immerse the federal judiciary in the management of [ ] prisons.\"'\nV.W., 236 F. Supp. 3d at 581 (quoting Fisher v. Goord, 981 F. Supp. 140, 167 (W.D.N.Y. 1997)). \nIn considering a request for injunctive relief, a court must give \"substantial weight\" to any adverse\nimpact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system the relief might have.  18\nU.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(A).\n2. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\na. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\nThe PLRA states that \"[no] action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under\nsection 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or\nother correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\"  42\nU.S.C. ยง 1997e(a).  This exhaustion requirement applies to all suits brought by inmates regarding\n16\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 17 of 27\naspects of prison life.  See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 532 (2002).  Inmates must exhaust all\navailable administrative remedies even if they are seeking only money damages that are not\navailable in prison administrative proceedings.  See Giano v. Goord, 380 F.3d 670, 675 (2d Cir.\n2004), abrogated on other grounds by Ross v. Blake, 136 S. Ct. 1850 (2016).  The failure to\nexhaust is an affirmative defense that must be raised by the defendants and, as such, it is the\ndefendants' burden to establish that the plaintiff failed to meet the exhaustion requirements.  See\nJones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 (2007); Key v. Toussaint, 660 F. Supp. 2d 518, 523 (S.D.N.Y.\n2009) (citations omitted).\nThe Supreme Court has held that in order to properly exhaust an inmate's administrative\nremedies, the inmate must complete the administrative review process in accordance with the\napplicable state rules.  See Jones, 549 U.S. at 218โ19 (citing Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81\n(2006)).  In Woodford, the Court held that \"proper\" exhaustion means that the inmate must\ncomplete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules,\nincluding deadlines, as a prerequisite to bringing suit in federal court.  See Woodford, 548 U.S. at\n90โ103.\nAlthough administrative remedies generally must be exhausted, a prisoner need not\nexhaust remedies if they are not \"available.\"  Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1855.  \"First, an administrative\nremedy may be unavailable when 'it operates as a simple dead end โ with officers unable or\nconsistently unwilling to provide any relief to aggrieved inmates.'\"  Williams v. Corr. Officer\nPriatno, 829 F.3d 118, 123 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859).  \"Second, 'an\nadministrative scheme might be so opaque that it becomes, practically speaking, incapable of\nuse.'\"  Id. (quoting Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1859).  \"In other words, 'some mechanism exists to provide\nrelief, but no ordinary prisoner can discern or navigate it.'\"  Id. at 123โ24 (quoting Ross, 136 S.\n17\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 18 of 27\nCt. at 1859).  \"Third, an administrative remedy may be unavailable 'when prison administrators\nthwart inmates from taking advantage of a grievance process through machination,\nmisrepresentation, or intimidation.'\"  Id. at 124 (quoting Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1860). \nDefendants allege that Plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their available administrative\nremedies, and that \"as is evidenced by their own complaints and grievance[s], each and every one\nof their claims have been resolved to their satisfaction.\"  Dkt. No. 23-4 at 12.  However, with\nregards to Plaintiffs' claims related to their housing assignments, Plaintiffs assert that they were\ntold by corrections staff that housing decisions are not grievable.  See Dkt. No. 18-2 at 5, 11; Dkt.\nNo. 24-2 at 3, 6.  Additionally, a finding in the report generated by the Commission of Correction\nin October 2019 was that \"[g]rievances . . . concerning housing decisions . . . were determined to\nbe non-grievable.\"  Dkt. No. 23-2 at 17.  Courts in this Circuit \"have also concluded that a claim\nis functionally exhausted when, as here, an inmate is told that [her] issue is not grievable.\" \nGilbeau v. Pallito, No. 1:11-CV-232, 2012 WL 2416719, *5 (D. Vt. May 22, 2012) (collecting\ncases).   \nWith regards to Plaintiffs' claims addressing benefits and privileges, the Court finds that\nquestions of fact exist as to whether administrative remedies were available to Plaintiffs, and\nwhether additional grievances may have been filed by Plaintiffs that were not maintained by\nDefendants.  Lieutenant Deborah Harris, a Grievance Coordinator at the Oneida County Jail,\nattested that she searched her records to locate all complaints filed by female inmates since\nJanuary 2020, and that \"all female inmates who have filed a complaint or grievance pursuant to\nthe inmate grievance procedure have voluntarily accepted a resolution of the complaint offered by\nthe Correctional Facility, thereby waiving any and all rights they may have to proceed with a\nformal grievance hearing.\"  Dkt. No. 23-3 at 8โ9.  However, Plaintiffs assert that more grievances\n18\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 19 of 27\nhave been filed than what the Oneida County Jail has records of, potentially \"reveal[ing] a\ngrievance system that is unavailable to address the concerns of the putative class.\"  Dkt. No. 24-1\nat 8.  While Defendants assert that this argument is without merit because Plaintiffs \"have not\nprovided any copies of the allegedly discarded documents and have not identified the sum and\nsubstance of those grievances,\" Dkt. No. 23-4 at 14, Plaintiffs allege that requests for copies were\nrefused.  See Dkt. No. 18-2 at 4; Dkt. No. 24-2 at 3, 8, 11.  Therefore, at this time, the Court will\nnot bar Plaintiffs' claims for their alleged failure to exhaust.3 \nEven if the Court assumes that Plaintiffs did exhaust their administrative remedies at this\nphase, the claims asserted by Plaintiffs do not meet the high threshold to establish a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits for a mandatory preliminary injunction.\nb. Equal Protection Violation\nPlaintiffs assert that the conditions in which general custody women are housed at\nDefendants' jail, as well as the privileges and benefits they receive, are inferior to those of\nsimilarly situated male inmates in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution as well as the Constitution of New York State.  See\nDkt. No. 18-5 at 13โ23.  Defendants state that female and male general custody inmates are\ntreated substantially similar, and, in the alternative, that the reasons for this treatment serve\n3 If questions of fact remain as to Plaintiffs' exhaustion of administrative remedies if, or\nwhen, this matter approaches the dispositive motion deadline, this Court will direct that a hearing\nbe held to resolve the issue.  See, e.g., Murray v. Palmer, No. 9:03-CV-1010, 2010 WL 1235591,\n*4 n.20 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2010) (citing Enigwe v. Zenk, No. 03-CV-0854, 2006 WL 2654985,\n*4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2006) (finding that, at the summary judgment \"stage of the proceedings, a\ngenuine question of fact exists with respect to whether [plaintiff] should be excused from\nexhausting his administrative remedies with regard to claims relating to his confinement,\" and\ntherefore \"direct[ing] that a hearing be held\" before a judge, to resolve this issue)).\n19\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 20 of 27\nimportant governmental objectives and are substantially related to the achievement of those\nobjectives.  See Dkt. No. 23-4 at 14โ21.    \nThe Equal Protection Clause generally requires the government to treat similarly situated\npeople alike.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). \nDissimilar treatment of dissimilarly situated persons does not violate equal protection.  See\nBarket, Levy & Fine, Inc. v. St. Louis Thermal Energy Corp., 21 F.3d 237, 242 (8th Cir. 1994). \nThus, the first step in an equal protection case is determining whether the plaintiff has\ndemonstrated that she was treated differently than others who were similarly situated to her.  See,\ne.g., Samaad v. City of Dallas, 940 F.2d 925, 940โ41 (5th Cir. 1991).  Absent a threshold showing\nthat she is similarly situated to those who allegedly receive favorable treatment, the plaintiff does\nnot have a viable equal protection claim.  See id. at 941 (holding that black residents failed to state\nan equal protection claim where they did not allege the existence of a similarly situated group of\nwhite residents who were treated differently).  \"Thus, before this Court may reach the merits of\ntheir equal protection claim, a determination must be made as to whether general custody female\ninmates and general custody male inmates are similarly situated.\"  Klinger v. Dep't of Corrs., 31\nF.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir. 1994).   \nPlaintiffs first allege that women in general custody are similarly situated to men in\ngeneral custody because \"their circumstances are alike in all ways material to their claims.\"  Dkt.\nNo. 18-5 at 14.  Defendants do not contest this allegation.  See Dkt. No. 23-4 at 14โ21.  After\nexamining the evidence submitted to the Court, most of the facts related to this element are not\ndisputed.  The population of female and male general custody inmates are all in the custody of\nDefendants and incarcerated in buildings within the same jail complex.  See Dkt. No. 18-3 at\n5โ11; see also Victory v. Berks Cnty., No. 18-cv-15170, 2019 WL 5266147, *9 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 17,\n20\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 21 of 27\n2019) (\"Victory I\").  While Defendants focus on the fact that male inmates comprise a larger\npercentage of the overall inmate population than female inmates, \"the difference is insignificant\nwhen analyzing whether female and male inmates are similarly situated.\"  Victory I, 2019 WL\n5266147, at *9; see also Clarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F. Supp. 1019, 1051 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). \nFurthermore, Defendants admittedly use the same risk assessment classification system for both\nmale and female inmates.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 2โ3 (\"The classification process is the same for\nboth male and female inmates\"); Dkt. No. 18-3 at 20โ21.  Based on the record, the Court agrees\nwith Plaintiffs that women in general custody are similarly situated to men in general custody.  \nHowever, the Court agrees with Defendants that, at this time, Plaintiffs have not met the\nhigh threshold to demonstrate that general custody women do not receive substantially equivalent\ntreatment to men in general custody.  With regards to benefits and privileges, Defendants have\noutlined in detail in their submissions to the Court facts that support that both male and female\ninmates appear to have substantially equivalent access to similar benefits and privileges.  With\nregards to books, the jail has a general library accessible to both male and female general custody\ninmates, with capacity for overflow books on an equal basis in cell blocks.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at\n6.  With regards to games, each cell block has a cabinet containing games, which are stocked on\nan equal basis for both male and female general custody inmates.  See id.  With regards to\ntelevision, while men have access to basic cable channels, women have access to movies and\nDVDs.  See id. at 7; see also Women Prisoners of Dist. of Columbia Dep't of Corrs. v. Dist. of\nColumbia, 93 F.3d 910, 927 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (\"Under the program-by-program method of\ncomparison embraced by the dissent, any divergence from an identity of programs gives rise to\nequal protection liability. . . .  Such an approach completely eviscerates the deference that federal\ncourts are obliged to give prison administrators\") (citing Turner v. Safley, 583 U.S. 78, 84โ85\n21\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 22 of 27\n(1987)).  Additionally, the pod units currently housing men have two televisions for fifty men,\nwhile fewer than twenty women share one television.4  With regards to computer tablets,\nDefendants state that the tablets are provided to all inmates at a ratio basis (one tablet for every\nseven inmates, assuming full capacity), with seven female inmates sharing three tablets as of June\n22, 2020.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 2, 7.  With regards to telephones, access is essentially equal as the\npod units have seven telephones for fifty-six inmates (one for every eight inmates), and the linear\nunits have one telephone for seven inmates at the present time.  See id. at 8.  With regards to\nshowers, access is essentially equal as the pod units have eight showers for fifty-six inmates (one\nfor every eight inmates), and the linear units have one shower for seven inmates at the present\ntime.  See id.  With regards to recreation, each male and female inmate, assuming full capacity,\nhas access to two hours of recreation time.  See id. at 8โ9.  With regards to water, Defendants\nstate that the water \"supplied to all the cells, both pod and linear, comes from the same source and\nis subject to periodic inspections by the Health Department.\"  Id. at 9.  With regards to\nmicrowaves, while Defendants acknowledge that female inmates do not have access to a\nmicrowave due to the safety concerns present when using a long extension cord, female inmates\nare provided with hot water three times a day to provide inmates with a substantially similar\nalternative.  See id.  With regards to plumbing, Defendants state that any issues detailed by\nPlaintiffs \"appear to be self created by the inmates and not a result of any deficiencies or\ninadequacies on behalf of the jail.\"  Id. at 11.   \n4 While Plaintiffs allege that the ratios cited by Defendants should be disregarded as they\nemploy actual female population numbers and maximum male population numbers, these ratios\nare constantly changing with the influx and release of female and male inmates, and do not remain\nstagnant.  The Court finds, therefore, that for the purposes of this motion, the ratios are\ninstructive.  \n22\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 23 of 27\nWith regards to available jobs and work assignments, the Court finds that although not\nevery work assignment that is available for male inmates is available for female inmates,\nDefendants note that male and female inmates cannot work in integrated work assignments, and\nthat when there are enough females inmates to staff a work assignment, that work assignment is\navailable to them.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 10.  Therefore, as there are not enough female inmates to\nstaff food service or the car wash (eighteen are required for food service alone), women cannot\nparticipate in those work assignments; they can participate in all other work assignments.  See id. \nThe Court also notes that there appear to be certain programs that female inmates participated in\nthat male inmates did not, such as the sewing program.  See Dkt. No. 18-3 at 11.  With regards to\ntrustee benefits, Defendants state that the same benefits are afforded to both male and female\ntrustees.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 10โ11.5 \nHowever, the Court is concerned about the lack of air conditioning in the linear housing\nunits, and notes that the pods do indeed have air conditioning.  While Defendant Zurek and the\nOneida County Jail have \"endeavored to make up for the lack of air conditioning . . . by providing\nlarge fans stationed at the end of the linear units,\" Dkt. No. 23-4 at 18, the Court is concerned by\nthis disparity.6  The Court does note, however, that the ongoing dialogue between Defendants and\n5  In conducting this inquiry, the Court notes that decisions relating to the available jobs\nand work assignments for inmates are the type of day-to-day judgments that rest firmly in the\ndiscretion of prison officials.  See Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d 1450, 1453โ54 (D.C. Cir. 1989)\n(distinguishing between \"cases involving regulations that govern the day-to-day operation of\nprisons\" and those that involve \"general budgetary and policy choices made over decades in the\ngive and take of city politics,\" and concluding that the former is entitled to significantly more\ndeference than the latter).  \"Second-guessing such judgments 'would seriously hamper [the prison\nofficials'] ability to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the\nintractable problems of prison administration.'\"  Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 733 (4th Cir.\n2002) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 89). \n6 In light of this concern, the Court will ask that Magistrate Judge Stewart work with the\n(continued...)\n23\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 24 of 27\nPlaintiffs that has led to some of the changes that female inmates have requested previously,\nincluding an increase in the number of tablets, recreation time, water, DVDs, and fans.  See id. at\n25.          \nDespite this concern, the Court finds that, with regards to the housing provided for the\ngeneral custody women, Defendants' reasons for moving Plaintiffs \"serve important governmental\nobjectives and [are] substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\"  Clarkson, 898 F.\nSupp. at 1043.7  After the Commission of Correction performed an inspection of the Oneida\nCounty Jail in October 2019, a report was generated which notified the facility that it was non-\ncompliant in housing both general custody and closed custody female inmates together in the\nsame pod unit.  See Dkt. No. 23-2 at 15.  In response, in January 2020, Defendants moved all\nfemale inmates from the pod units to the linear housing units, and separated closed custody and\ngeneral custody female inmates based on their classifications; general custody women were\nassigned to H-Block (Henry Right) and closed custody women were moved to H-Block (Henry\nLeft).  See id. at 5.  Defendants outlined their reasoning for this decision in their submissions to\nthe Court, which included the safety and security of the female inmates and corrections staff.  See\nid. at 5.  For example, leaving the female inmate population in the pod units (which, at the time of\nthe move was approximately ten general custody and fifteen closed custody women) would have\npresented difficulties monitoring fewer inmates in a larger space, which could \"create an\n6(...continued)\nparties to ensure that discovery is completed in this case in an expedient manner.  \n7  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' decisions are \"based on economic concerns born out of\na desire to benefit [Defendants] economically rather than out of a concern for what was in their\nbest interests.  Even assuming this is true, it does not raise an inference of discrimination on the\nbasis of gender.\"  Roubideaux v. North Dakota Dep't of Corrs. and Rehab., 570 F.3d 966, 974\n(8th Cir. 2009).\n24\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 25 of 27\nenvironment where inmates are able to evade effective observation by the corrections staff.\"  Id. \nThere is no evidence to suggest, at this time, that any resulting differences in the move of female\ninmates to comply with the Commission of Correction are caused by gender discrimination. \nWhile the housing conditions that female inmates are currently held in, based on the information\ncurrently before the Court, is not exactly the same to that of the male inmates, \"Defendants have\nsupported this disparate treatment by providing the court with evidence that important\ngovernmental objectives justify the difference in treatment, i.e., security and safety concerns.\" \nMcCoy v. Nevada Dep't of Prisons, 776 F. Supp. 521, 527โ28 (D. Nev. 1991). \nAfter considering all of the arguments and evidence in the record, at this time, before\ndiscovery, the Court cannot agree that Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of\ntheir claims based on the heightened burden required for a mandatory preliminary injunction. \nTherefore, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. \n3. Balance of Equities and Public Interest\nWhere the plaintiffs seek a mandatory injunction against prison officials, the court must\ndetermine whether the equities tip in the plaintiffs' favor.  See Burroughs v. County of Nassau,\nNo. 13-cv-6784, 2014 WL 2587580, *14 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2014).  Here, the balance of equities\nand public interest weigh decidedly against granting preliminary injunctive relief.  As noted, the\nSupreme Court has found that \"federal courts ought to afford appropriate deference and flexibility\nto state officials trying to manage a volatile environment ... especially ... in the fine-tuning of the\nordinary incidents of prison life[.]\"  Sandin, 515 U.S. at 482.  \nPrison administration is an onerous and difficult task and courts have traditionally\naccorded a large degree of deference in cases involving the administration of state penal\ninstitutions.  See Turner, 482 U.S. at 85.  The Court must balance the state's interest in providing\n25\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 26 of 27\ninmates with appropriate housing and amenities and the safety of prisoners and staff against\nPlaintiffs' interest in receiving the requested relief.  See Washington, 494 U.S. at 225.  Given the\ndeference afforded to prison officials and the general reluctance that federal courts should exhibit,\nthe Court finds that the equities do not weigh in Plaintiffs' favor.  See  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n520, 540 n.23, 548 n.29 (1979) (explaining that maintaining security and order and operating\ninstitution in manageable fashion are considerations peculiarly within the province and\nprofessional expertise of corrections officials).  The public's interest is better served by not\npresently interfering with penal administration.  See Williams v. Gage, No. 14-cv-453, 2014 WL\n6387348, *2 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 14, 2014); Burroughs, 2014 WL 2587580, at *14; Lewis v. Allen,\nNo. 3:10-cv-83, 2011 WL 7116310, *5 (D. Nev. Dec. 2, 2011).\nThe decision of a federal court to interfere in the daily operations of a local jail should not\nbe made lightly.  At this stage, the Court is unwilling to undertake this disfavored activity. \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the equities and public interest weigh decidedly against granting\nthe requested injunctive relief.8\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAfter careful review of the record, the parties' arguments, and the applicable law, the Court\nhereby\nORDERS that Plaintiffs' motion for class certification (Dkt. No. 10) is GRANTED; and\nthe Court further\nORDERS that Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. No. 18) is DENIED;\nand the Court further\n8 This result is further supported by the fact that staff at the Oneida County Jail have\nresponded to many of the complaints raised by Plaintiffs by providing them with additional\nbenefits and privileges, considerably in line with those provided to the male inmates. \n26\n\nCase 9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS   Document 28   Filed 08/03/20   Page 27 of 27\nORDERS that the Clerk of the Court shall serve a copy of this Memorandum-Decision\nand Order on all parties in accordance with the Local Rules.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDated: August 3, 2020\nAlbany, New York\n27",

Women  incarcerated  in  the  Oneida  County  Jail  (โthe  Jailโ)  experience  substantially  more \ndifficult  conditions  than  do  male  inmates.  The  women  spend  most  of their  time  in  windowless \ncells  or  in  a  six-foot wide  corridor  while  their  male  counterparts  enjoy  large  open  spaces  with \nregular  access  to  a recreation  room. \n2.  Women  also  have  inferior  access  to  phones,  showers,  hot water  for  cooking,  televisions, \nrecreational  equipment,  reading  materials,  work  programs,  and  trustee  benefits.  Defendants \nargue  that  the  unequal  treatment  is  acceptable  because  it would  cost  more  to  house  women  in  a \nunit  like  the  menโs. \n3.  In  this  civil  rights  lawsuit,  plaintiffs  Sarah  Barrett,  Nicole  Williamson,  and  Shannon \nTerrell  contend  that  Defendants  have  violated  and  continue  to  violate  their  right to  Equal\nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Documenti1  Filed  05/12/20  Page  2  of  15 \nProtection  under  the  law  as  guaranteed  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  of the  United  States \nConstitution  and  Article  I  ยง  11  of the  New  York  Constitution. \n4.  The  plaintiffs  seek  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief ending  the  unconstitutional  policies \nand  practices  of Defendants.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  lawsuit  on  behalf of a putative  class  consisting \nof all  female  inmates  who  are,  or  should  be,  classified  as  \"general  custody\"  and  who  are  now,  or \nwill  be,  incarcerated  at the  Oneida  County  Jail. \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n5.

Upon  admission  to  the  Jail,  all  inmates  go  through  an  admission  process  including  a \nmedical  and  mental  health  screening.  Inmates  then  have  a  five-day  orientation  period  during \nwhich  Jail  staff set  the  inmatesโ  classification  levels.  The  classification  levels  determine  where \ninmates  are  housed. \n19.  There  are  two  classifications  at the  Jail:  โclosed  custodyโ  and  โgeneral  custody.โ  The  Jail \nuses  a point  system  to  determine  which  classification  an  inmate  is  placed  in.  Inmates  in  special \nhousing  units  such  as  those  in  disciplinary  segregation  or  protective  custody  are  automatically \nclassified  as  โclosed  custody.โ \n20.  Points  for  classification  purposes  are  awarded  based  on  the  inmateโs  present  charge, \ncriminal  history,  legal  status,  incarceration  status,  and  disciplinary  record/severity.  The \nclassification  officer  also  takes  into  account the  inmateโs  mental  health  or  disabilities,  suicide \nattempts,  propensity  for  violence,  and  vulnerability. \n21.  Once  the  classification  officer  has  made  a  determination  as  to  a particular  inmate,  that \ninmate  is  informed  of score,  classification  designation,  and  housing  assignment.  Inmates  who \nscore  between  one  and  ten  on  the  scale  are  classified  as  general  custody  inmates,  and  inmates \nwho  score  above  ten  are  classified  as  closed  custody  inmates.\nMase  0:20-cv-00537-MAD-DUS  Bocument  3  ed  05/12/20  Page  5  of  15 \n22.  Closed  custody  inmates  receive  only the  minimum  privileges  required  by the  New  York \nState  Minimum  Standards.  See  9  N.Y.C.R.R.  ยงยง  7000  et.  seq.  According  to  the  Jail  policies, \ngeneral  custody  inmates  receive  all  the  privileges  provided  by the  Jail. \n23.  The  Jail  monitors  inmatesโ  positive  and/or  negative  behaviors  throughout their \nincarceration  on  โInmate  Behavioral  Log  Sheets.โ  An  inmate,  or  the  classification  officer,  can \nrequest  a  change  in  classification  at  any  time  based  on  the  inmateโs  behavior. \nThe  Jail  Discriminates  Against  General  Custody Women  on  the  Basis  of Their  Gender. \nPodular Housing  Units \n24.  Men  classified  as  general  custody  are  housed  in  podular  housing  units  (โpodsโ).  Pods \nhave  fifty-six  individual  cells  arranged  around  a  central  day  room.  When  inmates  are  outside  of \ntheir  cells,  there  are  no  physical  barriers  between  them  and  the  corrections  officer  assigned  to  the \nunit.  The  Pods  were  added  onto  the jail  during  a renovation  and  remodel  that  was  completed  in \n1996.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  eight  pod  style  housing  units  in  the  Jail. \n25.  A  recreation  area  attached  to  the  pods  has  exercise  equipment  and  a basketball  hoop.  A \nlarge  window  can  be  opened  to  let  fresh  air  in.  Men  can  access  this  area  for  at  least three  hours  a \nday  but  it  is  usually  available  whenever they  are  not  mandated  to  lock-in. \n26.  Cells  on  the  pods  are  approximately  eight  feet wide  by  ten  feet  long.  There  are  two \nwindows  in  the  cells.  One,  on  the  outside  wall,  lets  in  sunlight  and  allows  the  inmate  to  see \noutside.  The  other,  a  small  window  on  the  cell  door  allows  corrections  officers  to  see  into  the \ncell  during  their  rounds.  The  cells  have  a bed,  toilet,  sink,  mirror,  desk,  and  a  stool. \n27.  There  are  eight  showers  (one  for  every  seven  inmates  if the  pod  is  at  maximum  capacity) \nand  seven  telephones  (one  for  every  eight  inmates  if the  pod  is  at  maximum  capacity)  on  each\nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Document1  Filed  05/12/20  Page 6  of  15 \npod.  The  showers  and  phones  are  in  separate  areas  so  inmates  can  use  the  phone  while  others  are \nshowering. \n28.  The  pods  each  have  a  small  library with  games,  books,  cards,  and  magazines  for  the \ninmatesโ  use.  Another  small  room  on  each  pod  allows  privacy  during  inmatesโ  video  calls  with \ntheir  families  and  loved  ones. \n29.  There  are  two  cable  televisions  on  each  pod.  The  pods  also  have  a hot water  dispenser  so \ninmates  can  have  hot water  for  cooking  and  a microwave. \n30.  โ  The  pods  have  air  conditioning. \n31.  The  Jailโs  stated  goal  in  housing  inmates  in  this  environment  is  to  give  them  more \nindependence,  reduce  inmate  misbehavior  and  decrease  tensions  with  staff.!  An  inmate  who \nmisbehaves  is  removed  to  a more  restrictive  environment  such  as  the  linear  housing  units  in \nwhich  all  women  in  Defendantsโ  custody  are  housed. \n32.  The  common  area  of one  of the  Jailโs  pod  housing  units  is  pictured  below: \n  \nLinear Housing  Units  used by  the  General  Custody  Women \n  \n1  Sheriff Robert Maciol,  Oneida  County Sheriff's Office  2019 Annual Report,  available  at: \nh attp://ocsheriff. discoveregov.com/sites/default/files/OCSO%20annual%202019.pdf (last accessed May  11,  2017.) \nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Document1  Filed  05/12/20  Page  7  of  15 \n33.  Women  classified  as  general  custody  are  housed  in  linear  housing  units.  Otherwise,  these \nunits  are  predominantly  used  for  men  with  histories  of behavioral  issues  and/or  disciplinary \nproblems.  They  are  also  used  for  people  with  mental  health  or  medical  issues  that  necessitate \nseparation  from  other  inmates. \n34.  The  Jail  describes  the  linear  units  as  โstarkly  differentโ  from  the  pods.  *  The  linear  units \nhave  less  physical  space,  and  inmatesโ  movements  are  severely  restricted.  The  Jail  describes \nlinear  units  as  โthe  ideal  option  for  housing  inmates  with  special  needs.โ \n35.  The  linear  units  are  over  fifty-five  years  old  and  have  remained  relatively  unchanged \nsince  they  were  first  built  in  1965. \n36.  Women  at  the  Jail  were  previously  held  in  โPod  Four.โ  On  the  pod  the  women  had  access \nto  the  same  benefits  general  custody  men  currently  have. \n37.  On  the  pod  the  โgeneral  custodyโ  women  were  housed  with  the  โclosed  custodyโ  women. \nDespite  their  differing  classifications,  there  was  very  little  conflict  between  the  women. \n38.  On  January  22,  2020,  corrections  officers  moved  the  female  inmates  from  the  pod  into \nthe  โHenryโ  Unit.  The  Henry  Unit  is  a  linear  housing  unit  with  two  separate  but  identical  sides \neach  containing  twenty  small  open-bar  cells.  It was  formerly  used  as  the  menโs  Disciplinary \nSegregation  Unit  or  โthe  Box.โ  The  officers  gave  the  women  no  explanation  for  the  move. \nClosed  custody women  were  housed  in  โHenry  Leftโ  and  general  custody  women  were  housed  in \nโHenry  Rightโ.  The  women  housed  on  the  separate  sides  of the  unit  cannot  see,  hear,  or  interact \nwith  one  another. \n39.  The  transferred  inmates  found  the  Henry  Unit  covered  in  dirt  and  human  excrement with \nused  toiler  paper  on  the  floors,  walls,  and  ceiling.  Urine  and  feces  was  smeared  in  cells  and  on \nwalls. \n  \n?  Supra fn.  1\nC3 op โ oD \nAO.  Twelve  female  inmates  were  given  only  two  gloves  and  two  bottles  of disinfectant to \nclean  the  unit.  The  block  was  so  disgusting  some  of the  women  became  sick  during  the  cleaning. \nAl.  For  several  weeks  the  general  custody  women  housed  on  Henry  Right  had  no  access  to \ntablets,  hot water,  television  or  books. \n42.  On  April  1,  2020,  all  the  women  were  moved  to  another  linear  housing  unit,  โCharlie \nUnitโ  (C-Unitโ). \n43.  The  C-Unit  is  a  smaller  version  of the  Henry  Unit.  It  contains  two  separate  but  identical \nsides  of sixteen  cells  situated  in a  straight  line.  One  side  holds  the  women  classified  as  general \ncustody  and  the  other  houses  the  women  classified  as  closed  custody.  The  general  custody \nwomen  and  closed  custody  women  cannot  see,  hear  or  interact with  one  another. \n44.  Each  side  of the  C-Unit  has  a  six-foot wide  catwalk  outside  the  cells.  The  catwalk  has \nfour  small  picnic  style  tables  on  it.  It  is  the  only  common  area  for the  women  to  congregate. \nBecause  the  four  windows  on  each  side  of the  unit  are  frosted,  it  is  impossible  to  see  outside. \nThere  is  no  air  conditioning  on  the  unit. \nAS.  The  cells  on  C-unit  are  smaller  than  the  ones  on  the  pods.  They  are  approximately  five \nfeet wide  by  seven  feet  long.  There  is  much  less  privacy  in  cells  in  linear  units  because  they \nhave  open  bars  on  the  outside  instead  of doors.  The  cells  contain  only  a bed,  toilet,  and  a  sink. \nThere  are  no  windows  in  the  cells.\nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Document1  Filed  05/12/20  Page 9  of  15 \n46.  Pictured  below  is  a  linear  cell  from  the  Henry  Unit,  which  is  identical  to  the  C-Unit  cells, \n  \n47.  There  is  one  shower  and  one  phone  on  the  general  custody  side  of the  unit.  In  theory,  this \nwould  mean  one  shower  for  about  every  sixteen  women  and  one  phone  for  the  all  the  sixteen \nwomen  housed  on  the  general  custody  side.  However  practical  access  is  even  more  restricted. \nThe  showers  and  phone  are  in  the  same  area,  and  only  one  woman  is  allowed  into  the \nphone/shower  area  at  a time.  Thus,  there  will  be  times  when  no  one  can  use  the  phone  as  well  as \ntimes  when  no  one  can  take  a  shower,  and  no  more  than  one  woman  at  a time  can  take  a  shower. \nA8.  There  is  no  microwave  on  the  general  custody  side  of the  unit.  The  women  also  do  not \nhave  regular  access  to  hot water  or  clean  cold  water.  Room  temperature  water  is  delivered  to \nthem  two  or  three  times  a  day. \n49,  Women  have  access  to  a television  every  other  day,  but they  can  only watch  DVDs. \nThey  watch  the  same  DVD  movies  repeatedly.  Because  they  cannot  watch  the  news  and  do  not \nget  newspapers,  they  must  rely  on  their  phone  conversations  with  friends  and  family  for  news  of \nthe  outside  world  including  news,  highly  relevant  in  the  current  environment,  of the  Covid-19 \npandemic.  Unlike  the  pods  housing  male  inmates,  C-unit  has  no  library  with  books,  and \nmagazines  Women  are  allowed  only  two  books  a week  from  the  library.\nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Documenti1  Filed  05/12/20  Page  10  of  15 \n50.  The  general  custody  women  have  only  one  hour  of recreation  time  a  day.  Their \nrecreation  yard  is  a  small  fenced-in  basketball  court with  a  covering  over  it.  There  is  a basketball \nhoop  on  the  yard,  but  the  balls  are  hardly  ever  inflated  enough  to  play.  There  is  no  exercise \nequipment. \n51.  When  the  closed  custody  side  of C-Unit  is  at  maximum  capacity  the  Jail  moves  women  to \nthe  general  custody  side  of the  unit. \n52.  One  of the  Jailโs  linear  housing  units  is  pictured  below: \n  \n  \nWomen  are Not  Given  Equal Access  to  Programming  and Benefits \n53.  Inmates  who  exhibit  good  behavior  at the  Jail  can  obtain  โtrusteeโ  status.  This  allows  the \ninmates  to  receive  extra benefits  in  exchange  for  cleaning  and  helping  out  around  their  housing \nunit.  Male  trustees  receive  one  free  hour  of video  calls  a week  and  extra  commissary  items. \nWomen  trustees  receive  neither.  For  example,  Plaintiff Barrett  quit  her  position  as  a trustee \n10\nPSP  soae ByaEt eGtpG eAaatSrs   weaPteP h o t Aโ k:   weBPT Weo efdtEe apEke  EA a :  EPArLSre mP P as  heg rofye r.

OP aLEtEE E f  aeSeaSea e   \nbecause  the  Jail  continuously  refused  to  give  her  the  one-hour  of free  video  calls  she  was  entitled \nto. \n54.  The  Jail  offers  work  programs  including  laundry,  food  service,  car wash,  general  library, \nprint  shop,  grounds  maintenance,  building  maintenance  and janitorial.  Women  are  only  allowed \nto  be  on  the  laundry  crew. \n55.  Inmates  at the jail  also  have  tablets  available  to  make  video-calls  to  their  families.  Menโs \nunits  have  twelve  tablets  (one  for  approximately  every  five  inmates).  The  general  custody \nwomen  have  only  two  (one  for  every  eight  inmates). \nDefendantsโ Discrimination  against  Women Does Not Serve  an  Important  Governmental \nObjective  and  The Discriminatory Means Employed by Defendants  are  not Substantially \nRelated to  the Achievement  of Those  Objectives \n56.  Defendants  cite  the  smaller  female  inmate  population  and  the  cost  of operating  a pod  for \nthem  as justification  for  subjecting  them  to  more  onerous  conditions  and  depriving  them  of \nprograms  and  benefits.  Specifically,  Defendant  Maciol  references  the  cost  of heating,  electricity \nand  staffing  the  pod  with  corrections  officers. \n57.  The  disparate  treatment  between  general  custody  men  and  women  at the  Jail  is  not \nsubstantially  related  to  any  actual  and  important  government  objective. \n58.  Plaintiffs  Barrett,  Williamson,  and  Terrell  filed  several  grievances  to  address  the \ndiscrimination  faced  by  women  at the  Jail,  but the  Jail  has  continuously  refused  to  respond.  The \ncorrections  officers  tell  the  general  custody women  if they  want to  be  treated  better  they  should \nhave  never  came  to jail. \n59.  When  confronted  with  the  womenโs  complaints  about  unequal  treatment,  Defendant \nMaciol  responded  that the  move  of women  to  the  more  restrictive  linear  housing  units  1s \npermanent  unless  there  is  a  significant  change  in  the  population. \n11\nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Documenti1  Filed  05/12/20  Page  12  of  15 \nCLASS  ALLEGATIONS \n60.  โ All  plaintiffs  bring  the  First  and  Second  Cause  of action  pursuant to  Rule  23(a)  and  b(2) \nof the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief on  behalf of a \nclass  of โall  female  inmates  who  are,  or  should  be,  classified  as  \"general  custody\"  and  who  are \nnow,  or  will  be,  incarcerated  at the  Oneida  County  Jail.โ  All  class  members  face  discrimination \non  the  basis  of their  gender  as  a  direct  result  of Defendantsโ  policies. \n61.  All  four  requirements  of 23(a)  are  satisfied: \na.  Numerosity:  Joinder  of all  class  members  is  impracticable  because  of the  size  of \nthe  class  and  the  characteristics  of the  class  members.  Every  woman  who  is,  or  will  be, \nincarcerated  at  the  Oneida  County  is  subjected  to  or  at  risk  of being  subjected  to  their \ndiscriminatory  policies  and  practices.  In  April  2020  there  were  thirty-two  women  held  at  the \nOneida  County  Jail.  Every  month,  additional  class  members  cycle  in  and  out  of the  Jail.  In  2019 \nover  seven  hundred  women  were  admitted  into  the  Jail.  Many  of these  women  are  unable  to  file \nlawsuits  to  address  this  discrimination  on  their  own  because  of their  lack  of financial  resources, \nand  length  of time  they  will  be  incarcerated. \nb.  Commonality:  There  are  questions  of law  and  fact  common  to  all  of the  members \nof the  class,  including  but  not  limited  to: \ne  Whether  the  Defendants  violate  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Equal  Protection \nrights  of the  putative  class  by  housing  them  in  the  old  linear  style  housing  unit \ninstead  of the  pods; \ne  Whether  Defendants  violate  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  Equal  Protection  rights \nof the  putative  class  by  denying  them  the  privileges,  services,  and  programs \nprovided  to  male  inmates  at the jail; \n12\nCase  9:20-cv-00537-MAD-DJS  Documenti1  Filed  05/12/20  Page  13  of  15 \ne  Whether  the  Defendants  have  a  genuine  and  exceedingly  persuasive justification \nfor  their  failure  to  treat  putative  class  members  and  similarly  situated  men \nequally; \ne  Whether  the  Defendants  denial  of pod  style  housing  and  its  concomitant  benefits, \nservices  and  programs  to  the  putative  class  is  substantially  related  to  the \nachievement  of important  government  interests;  and \ne  Whether  the  Defendants  violate  the  rights  of the  putative  class  under the  Article  | \nยง  11  of the  New  York  Constitution. \nCc.  Typicality:  The  claims  of the  named  Plaintiffs  are  typical  of those  of the  class. \nEach  named  Plaintiff has  been  subjected  to  the  challenged  policies  and  practices. \nd.  Adequacy  of Representation:  The  named  Plaintiffs,  their  representatives,  and  class \ncounsel  will  fairly  and  adequately  represent the  interests  of the  class.  The  named  Plaintiffs  and \ntheir  representatives  have  no  interests  in  this  matter  that  are  antagonistic  to  other  class  members. \nClass  counsel  has  many  years  of experience  in  civil  rights  and  class  action  litigation. \n62.  Class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief are  appropriate  under  rule  23(b)(2)  because \nthe  Defendants  have  acted  or  refused  to  act  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to  the  class  as  a \nwhole. \nCLAIMS  FOR  RELIEF \n  \nFirst  Cause  of Action \n  \n63.
