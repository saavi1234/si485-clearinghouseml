    "summary": "<p>After a two-year investigation initiated in December 2016 under CRIPA and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a Notice on December 19, 2018 concluding that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (&ldquo;HRRJ&rdquo;) failed to provide constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care to incarcerated peoples and placed people with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time. The DOJ also concluded that HRRJ&rsquo;s housing practices discriminate against incarcerated people with mental health disabilities in violation of the ADA.</p>\r\n<p>In the Notice, the DOJ set forth factual findings about the conditions at HRRJ that violated incarcerated peoples&rsquo; constitutional rights. Principally, the DOJ found that medical and mental health care at HRRJ was constitutionally inadequate. In all stages of medical and mental health care (including patient intake, chronic care and emergency care, treatment and therapy, continuity of care, and security and care for suicidal persons), the quality of care and access to care was found to be severely deficient, subjecting patients to a serious risk of harm due to delays and lack of care. The DOJ also found a lack of oversight and accountability and a deliberate indifference by HRRJ officials in identifying and mitigating risks. Furthermore, HRRJ utilized prolonged restrictive housing which disparately affects incarcerated people with mental illnesses, thereby denying them access to activities and programming that they would otherwise be eligible for, and putting them at risk for serious harm. Officials at HRRJ knew of these substantial shortcomings and the associated risks and failed to take appropriate action.</p>\r\n<p>On August 5, 2020, the DOJ filed this lawsuit against HRRJ in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia based on the findings in the December 2018 report and HRRJ&rsquo;s subsequent failure to take sufficient remedial steps. The DOJ alleges that HRRJ&rsquo;s policies and practices violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of people incarcerated in the facility. As a result, the DOJ asked Judge Rebecca Beach Smith to declare that HRRJ&rsquo;s practices violated the constitutional rights of incarcerated persons and violated the ADA, and to enjoin HRRJ to take immediate action to amend its policies and practices to ensure lawful conditions of confinement.</p>\r\n<p>By the time that the complaint was filed, the parties had already negotiated a settlement. On the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties filed a joint settlement motion. In the settlement agreement, HRRJ agreed to implement a comprehensive list of reforms including appropriate screening and assessment for medical and mental health needs by qualified professionals, adequate treatment planning for medical and mental health concerns, suicide prevention practices, specialized mental health housing units, oversight of restrictive housing placement, increased medical and mental health staff, increased training for staff, increased collaboration between mental health staff and jail leadership, and a Quality Assurance program to identify and correct deficiencies with the medical and mental health care system to be overseen by a Quality Assurance Committee providing monthly reports to the monitor and the DOJ.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement noted that HRRJ would designate an Agreement Coordinator to coordinate compliance with the agreement. HRRJ agreed to create annual Implementation Plans to describe how it will fulfill its obligations under the agreement, including deadlines within the first year by which HRRJ must draft or revise policies and procedures, complete a staffing plan, develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff, develop and implement a Quality Improvement Committee, and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms to report on data relevant to prevent to prevent or minimize harm to incarcerated persons.</p>\r\n<p>A key provision of the settlement agreement was the mandatory appointment of an independent third-party monitor, to oversee HRRJ&rsquo;s compliance with the agreement. The monitor was agreed to be retained for a period of three years and provide biannual status reports to the DOJ, HRRJ and the court. The monitor would also undertake compliance reviews, on-site inspections and issue monitor reports every six months to assess compliance and HRRJ&rsquo;s progress on the various reform efforts. The reports will also be filed with the court. In the event of noncompliance with the agreement, the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement at the request of the DOJ.</p>\r\n<p>On August 31, 2020, the court approved the settlement agreement and subsequently, on September 10, 2020, the court approved the appointment of James Conrad Welch to be the third-party monitor. The settlement agreement was effective as of August 31, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>By the terms of the agreement, HRRJ was to implement all provisions of the agreement within four years and the agreement would terminate in five years, so long as HRRJ attained substantial compliance with the agreement and maintained that compliance for at least one year. HRRJ had the burden to prove that it has achieved and maintained substantial compliance with the agreement and has been operating in accordance with the requirements of the ADA and the U.S. Constitution continuously for one year. After the closure of the facility on April 1, 2024, and the filing of the final monitor&rsquo;s report on June 4, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement on July 31, 2024. The court dismissed the agreement on the same day, and the case is now closed.</p>",

The agreement resolved the DOJ’s claims alleging unlawful conditions at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail (HRRJ) in violation of CRIPA and the ADA.  Under the agreement, HRRJ will develop and implement policies, procedures, and training regarding adequate medical and mental health care and appropriate housing for prisoners with serious mental illness.  These measures include specialized mental health housing units, increased training for medical, mental health, and security personnel, proper screening and assessment for medical and mental health concerns, adequate treatment planning and suicide prevention measures, and a quality assurance program.  Per the agreement, the parties jointly appointed a monitor to assess and assist with compliance with the agreement.  On July 31, 2024, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the agreement, which the judge granted on the same day. The case is now closed.",

The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (CRIPA), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, \nas amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (ADA), to enjoin the Defendant, Hampton Roads \nRegional Jail Authority, from depriving prisoners of rights, privileges, or immunities secured \nand protected by the Constitution of the United States, and rights protected by the ADA. \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345 and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12133.   \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 2 of 7 PageID# 2\n \n \n3.  The United States is authorized to initiate this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a). \n4.  The Attorney General has certified that all pre-filing requirements specified in 42 U.S.C.     \n§ 1997b have been met.  The Certificate of the Attorney General is appended to this Complaint \nas Attachment A and is incorporated herein. \n5.  Venue in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and in this \nDivision is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and Local Rule 3(C).   \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff is the United States of America.  \n7.  Defendant is the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (“Jail”).     \n8.  Defendant is responsible for the safety, care, custody, and control of prisoners housed in the \nHampton Roads Regional Jail at 2690 Elmhurst Lane in Portsmouth, Virginia.  \nFACTS \n9.  The Jail is an institution within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997(1).   \n10. The Jail houses over 900 individuals, including pre-trial detainees, convicted prisoners, and \nyouth accused of adult crimes (“prisoners”).   \n11. The Jail is a public entity within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, \nand  is  therefore  subject  to  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  42  U.S.C.  §§  12131-12134,  and  its \nimplementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 35. \n12. On December 12, 2016, the United States notified the Jail and local officials of its intention \nto investigate conditions in the Jail, including specifically whether the “Jail violates inmates’ \nrights to adequate medical and mental health care, violates the constitutional rights of inmates \nwho have mental illness by secluding them in isolation for prolonged time periods, and \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 3 of 7 PageID# 3\n \n \nviolates the ADA rights of inmates who have mental illness by denying them access to \nservices, programs, and activities by reason of their disability.” \n13. The United States’ investigation included on-site inspections with expert consultants, staff \nand prisoner interviews, and extensive review of documents such as policies, procedures, \nforms, incident reports, grievances, medical records, and training records. \n14. The United States provided the results and recommendations of its investigation to the Jail \nand local officials.   These disclosures include specifically those made in the United States’ \nDecember 19, 2018 CRIPA Notice.   The constitutional and statutory violations outlined in \nthe CRIPA Notice include those described in paragraphs 15 through 23 below. \n15. Jail prisoners suffer serious harm or risk of serious harm from inadequate medical and mental \nhealth care, and from the Jail’s use of prolonged restrictive housing, under current conditions, \non prisoners with serious mental illness.      \n16. Such deficiencies are longstanding and have been in place throughout the course of the United \nStates’ investigation.    \n17. Defendant has not taken corrective action sufficient to correct the longstanding deficiencies. \n18. Defendant  fails  to  provide  constitutionally  adequate  medical  care  to  prisoners.    Many \nprisoners at the Jail have serious medical needs requiring treatment, and these prisoners are \nplaced at a substantial risk of serious harm when they do not receive adequate treatment.  The \nJail fails to provide  constitutionally adequate intake, discharge planning, sick call, chronic \ncare, and emergency care such that prisoners are subjected to an unacceptable risk of harm \ndue to delays or lack of treatment.  \n19. Defendant  fails  to  provide  constitutionally  adequate  mental  health  care  to  prisoners. \nSpecifically, the Jail’s current program fails to:  properly screen prisoners for mental illness; \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 4 of 7 PageID# 4\n \n \nprovide adequate treatment planning; adequately administer medications and psychotherapy; \nand properly treat and supervise suicidal prisoners.  \n20. Defendant’s use of prolonged restrictive housing under current conditions, including the \nfailure to provide adequate medical and mental health care, violates the constitutional rights \nof prisoners with serious mental illness.  \n21. At least as of 2018, Defendant’s restrictive housing practices of placing prisoners with mental \nhealth disabilities in restrictive housing on administrative status specifically because they are \n“mentally deficient,” with no disciplinary or other reason given, discriminate against prisoners \nwith mental health disabilities by denying them the benefits of the Jail’s  services, programs, \nand activities when they would otherwise be qualified to access these benefits in non-\nrestrictive housing in violation of the ADA.  \n22. Jail security staffing is poor, with insufficient numbers of trained and experienced staff to \npermit medical and mental health staff adequate access to provide prisoners with prompt \ntreatment or to respond to medical or mental health emergencies. \n23. The factual allegations set forth in paragraphs 15 through 23 have been obvious and known \nto Defendant for a substantial period of time; yet Defendant has been deliberately indifferent  \nto prisoner health and safety by failing to adequately address the conditions described.   \nVIOLATIONS ALLEGED \n24. The allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 23 are hereby re-alleged and incorporated by \nreference. \n25. Through the acts and omissions alleged in paragraphs 15 through 20 and 22 through 23, \nDefendant has violated the rights, privileges, and immunities of persons confined in the Jail \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 5 of 7 PageID# 5\n \n \nsecured or protected by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States.   \n26. Through the acts and omissions alleged in paragraphs 15 through 20 and 22 through 23, \nDefendant has engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives persons confined in \nthe Jail of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the Constitution.  \n27. Unless restrained by this Court, Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and omissions, \nset forth in paragraphs 15 through 20 and 22 through 23, that deprive persons confined at the \nJail of rights, privileges or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution of the United \nStates.  \n28. Through the acts and omissions alleged in paragraph 21, Defendant has discriminated against \nprisoners with mental health disabilities by denying them access to services, programs, and \nactivities, because of their disabilities, in violation of the ADA. \n29. Unless restrained by this Court, Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and omissions, \nset forth in paragraph 21, that discriminate against prisoners with mental health disabilities in \nviolation of the ADA.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n30. The Attorney General is authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 1997a and 42 U.S.C. § 12133 to seek \nappropriate equitable relief. \n31.  WHEREFORE, the United States prays that this Court enter an order: \n  a.  declaring that the acts, omissions, and practices of Defendant set forth in paragraphs \n15 through 20 and 22 through 23 above constitute a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives \nprisoners confined in the Jail of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 6 of 7 PageID# 6\nConstitution of the United States and that those acts, omissions, and practices violate the \nConstitution of the United States; \nb.  declaring that the acts, omissions, and practices of Defendant set forth in paragraph \n21  above discriminate against prisoners with mental health disabilities in violation of the \nADA; \nc.  enjoining Defendant, its officers, agents, employees, subordinates, successors in \noffice, and all those acting in concert or participation with them from continuing the acts, \nomissions, and practices set forth in paragraphs 15 through 23 above and requiring Defendant \nto take such actions as will ensure lawful conditions of confinement are afforded to prisoners \nat the Jail; and \nd.  granting such other and further equitable relief as it may deem just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \nWILLIAM P.

It covers the time frame from November 1,2023 - April 30, 2024,\nfollowing the closure ofHRRJ. This report will describe the steps taken by HRRJ to implement this\nAgreement and evaluate the extent to which Hampton Roads Regional Jail (HRRJ) has complied with\neach substantive provision ofthe Agreement. The report will compare the original findings with where\nHRRJ was at the time ofits closure, and evaluate the status ofcompliance for each relevant provision of\nthe Agreement using these standards;\n(1) Substantial Compliance; (2) Partial Compliance: and (3) Non-Compliance.\n“Substantial Compliance” indicates that HRRJ has achieved material compliance with the\ncomponents ofthe relevant provision ofthe Agreement. “Partial Compliance” indicates that HRRJ has\nachieved material compliance with some ofthe components of the Agreement, but significant work\nremains. “Non-compliance” indicates that HRRJ has not met the relevant provision ofthe Agreement.\nIn the body ofthe report, the degree ofcompliance is italicized, recommendations were removed for this\nfinal report. In Appendix A (Summary of Compliance), the degree of compliance is abbreviated as:\nSubstantial Compliance will be noted as “SC”, Partial Compliance as “PC” and Non-Compliance as\n“NC”.\nPending Review “PR” was used to mark those overarching provisions that required several provisions to\nbe substantially compliant over time.\nAppendix A - Summary of Compliance\nFor reference, The Consent Agreement is included as Appendix B as a separate document.\nExecutive Summary\nThe Monitor has been to the facility every month except June 2022 and May 2023 since the\nAgreement began in August 2020 to evaluate and analyze the progress of HRRJ. As stated in the\nprevious report, Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority decided to close the facility no later than April\n1, 2024. Thus, this seventh and final report will do two things. First, it will assess the Jail’s compliance\nwith the provisions ofthe Consent Decree as the Jail was nearing closure. It will also talk about the\ntrajectory the Jail was on with respect to certain provisions. Second, at the beginning ofeach section of\nthe report, it will look back at the 2018 DOJ Findings Report and talk about the progress made in the\nintervening years. This Monitor feels that if HRRJ were able to complete its work, HRRJ would have\nbeen able to comply with all provisions ofthe Agreement. It is disappointing that the staffdidn’t have\nthe chance to complete their mission.\n3 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 4 of 50 PageID# 1103\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nDeaths that opened the DOJ investigation\nIn December 2016, the Department ofJustice opened its investigation ofthe Hampton Roads\nRegional Jail in part because oftwo deaths. One, referred to as AA in the 2018 DOJ Findings Report,1\ninvolved a 24-year-old man with serious mental illness who, after losing nearly 40 pounds, died ofheart\nfailure because ofrapid weight loss after being placed in restrictive housing for 100 days. The other\ninvolved a 66-year-old man, BB, who died ofa perforated ulcer weeks after submitting requests for\nmedical help related to abdominal pain that were not addressed. These were two often deaths, shown in\nFigure 1 below, which included four suicides, outlined in the 2018 DOJ Findings Report that occurred\nduring a four-year period between 2015 and 2018.\nSoon after the 2018 DOJ Findings Report, there were two more concerning deaths that involved\nmedical issues, in February and April 2019.\nTurnaround\nRemarkably, since 2019 and after DOJ’s and the monitor’s involvement, the Hampton Roads\nRegional Jail experienced 57 consecutive months without a suicide or death where the facilities actions\nwere in question. No suicides in 57 months due to the hard work ofits security, medical, and mental\nhealth staff. Figure 1 below shows this 57-month stretch. There were also no concerning deaths that\ninvolved medical or mental health issues between April 2019 and October 2023 - a stretch of 53\nmonths.\nFigure 1: 57 Months Without a Suicide\nApr 2015\nDeath itl\nDeath #2 57 Months: no suicides Dec 2018 -Oct 2023\nMar 2017\nMar 2016\nDeath #7\nDeath #4\nMay 2016 May 2018\nFeb 2019\nDeath #5 Death #9\nDeath #11\nAug 2015 Apr 2019 Oct 2023\nDec 2017\nDeath #3 Aug 2016 Dec 2018\nDeath #12 Death tfl\nDeath #6 Death tt8 Death UlO\ni ►\nDec2018 DOJ Aug2020 DOJ\nFindings Consent\nReport Decree\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n1 Throughout, 1 will refer to individual examples using the anonymous letters that match the letters the DOJ used in its 2018\nFindings Report for consistency such as AA, BB, CC, etc. Those after the Agreement will be labeled Al, A2, etc.\n4 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 5 of 50 PageID# 1104\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n^Deaths in italics indicate suicides\nRestrictive housingfor inmates with serious mental illness\nIn addition, the Jail worked to reduce the time inmates with serious mental illness (SMI) spent in\nrestrictive housing (RH). The Department ofJustice emphasized the importance ofreducing time spent\nin restrictive housing for prisoners with SMI because ofthe risk ofharm and actual harm it causes. As\nshown below in Figure 2, in the previous six years, the Jail had substantially reduced the percentage of\ninmates with SMI spending one day ofmore in restrictive housing and those spending 30 days or more\nthere.\nFigure 2: Percentage ofInmates with Serious Mental Illness in Restrictive Housing\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60% 67%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n36%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n6.8%\n0%\n> 1 day > 30 days > 1 day > 30 days\n2017 2023\nFigure 2 shows that during the DOJ investigation in 2017, 67% ofthe 496 inmates with SMI spent\none day or more in restrictive housing, and 36% ofthose 496 inmates spent 30 days or more\nconsecutively there. Then, in 2023, the Jail had greatly reduced holding inmates with SMI in restrictive\nhousing. Only 30% ofthe 266 inmates with SMI spent one day or more in restrictive housing, and only\n6.8% ofthose 266 inmates spent more than a month consecutively there. This especially shows a\ndramatic reduction oflong stays in restrictive housing. This is attributable to Jail personnels' hard work\nto change its practices and culture by increasing mental health treatment, providing multi-disciplinary\ntreatment plans and incentivizing behavior through achievement awards, efforts to divert inmates with\n5 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 6 of 50 PageID# 1105\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nSMI from restrictive housing, and creating spaces that were more therapeutic, less isolating, and\nprovided the opportunity for confidential therapy sessions.\nTransformation\nFor example, before the Jail closed, it had undergone renovations to improve its therapeutic\natmosphere. In one area ofthe Jail where inmates who felt suicidal were held, the Jail had installed\nlarger windows in the doors for better sight lines, painted the housing unit walls therapeutic colors,\nmounted televisions and a blackboard-wall (to be used with non-toxic chalk to prevent injuries if\nswallowed) that were being used in the dayroom in conjunction with mental health sessions, and added a\nde-escalation “blue” room with therapeutic furniture which created a calming space with a blackboard-\nwall for chalk drawing and mental health sessions. See Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 for pictures ofthese\nspaces. In addition, eating meals out ofcell and out ofcell group therapeutic sessions were also\noccurring in the dayroom. This represented a shift from the restrictive, lock-down experience described\nin the 2018 DOJ Findings Report. One restrictive aspect that had shifted was the increase in out-of-cell\nmental health contacts. These new spaces had allowed for more mental health interactions that could\noccur out-of-cell as opposed to the “crack therapy” described the Findings Report. “Crack therapy” was\nthe term inmates gave to talking with mental health staff through a crack where the solid metal door of\ntheir cell butts up to and slides along a track mounted to the wall ofthe housing unit; instead ofbeing\nable to have an out-of-cell, confidential treatment session.\nFigure 3: Larger windows in the doors for better sight lines\nu-\nt ●\n\\\n\\iT'\n3fc.‘\nOld door - small window New door - larger windows\nFigure 4: Housing unit walls painted with therapeutic colors\n6 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 7 of 50 PageID# 1106\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nPrior to repainting After painting with therapeutic colors\nFigure 5: Television and blackboard wall in dayroom\nV\n(- 1\n4\nV\nFigure 6: De-escalation “blue” room with blackboard wall\n7 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 8 of 50 PageID# 1107\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nFigure 6 is an example ofhow the Blue Room and the chalk board were used by clients to express\ntheir feelings. This example shows the artistic talent some ofthe inmates showed in their creations.\nUsing the Agreement, and the changes HRRJ made to provide care to inmates as an outline and\nguide, HRRJ’s actions may assist otherjurisdictions in avoiding being placed under outside oversight in\nthe future.\nWhen the Department ofJustice began the investigation ofHRRJ in December 2016 there were\nbetween nine hundred and one thousand (900 - 1000) inmates. When the Agreement was signed in\nAugust 2020 there were between five hundred and six hundred (500 - 600). In May 2021, the ADP was\nunder four hundred (400). In May 2023 the ADP was two hundred or less (200). HRRJ slowly released\ninmates to the feederjails over the past six months. All inmates had returned to their feederjails, or\nalternative sites designated by the feeder jail, by March 22, 2024.\nDuring the last few months Newport News has renovated part ofit'sjail. Hampton is negotiating\nwith the Western Tidewater Regional Jail to join theirjail authority and many oftheir inmates were\ntransferred to Western Tidewater Regional Jail. The City ofPortsmouth City has put in a bid for the\nHRRJ facility. As of the writing ofthis report, the HRRJ Authority has not taken action to sell the\nproperty.\nIt will be criticalthat inmateshousedat HRRJand being transferred back to their feederjails receive\nappropriate care. As stated during HRRJA Board meetings, “HRRJ was created to provide services that\nwere unavailable at the feederjails”. Feederjails must assure that they provide constitutionally\nappropriate care to all inmates residing in theirjails. As this Monitor has not been asked to visit those\njails, I am not able to respond to the care and treatment in those facilities.\nAs noted above, the five (5) feederjails sent inmates with the highest medical and mental health\nneeds to HRRJ. Feeder jails sent inmates to HRRJ because ofthe recognition that HRRJ had superior\ncapabilities in addressing the medical and mental health requirements ofhigh acuity inmates. Good\nindication ofthis statement has been noted in all previous reports by the Monitor that there have been\ntimes when arriving inmates are so sick that they have had to be taken immediately to a hospital or to a\nhigher level ofpsychiatric care.\nSome recommendations from the Agreement that the all correctional facilities may wish to review;\n#39 - 43 - medical care - assuring that care is provided according to national standards, #49 - 52 -\nChronic Care - this area is critical to assure that inmates are provided constitutionally adequate\nhealthcare, #88 - suicide watch - especially those on “extended stays” defined as more than 14 days,\n#93 - release plans - the spirit ofwhat’s required, #100 - 104 - diversion units where the facility may\nbe able to house those with an SMI rather than in RH, #104 - acute mental health units - used for\nsuicide watch for those actually on watch not those wanting more out-of-cell time, #111 - use RH only\nfor disciplinary, not “fear for safety” - voluntary administrative restriction; and #114 - if using RH for\ndisciplinary reasons on those with SMI, efforts must be made to divert them from RH and ifdiversion\ndoes not occur to protect them from the negative effects of RH. Feeder jails now have the responsibility\nto care for inmates in the same way that HRRJ had been providing. The monitor offered to meet and\nvisit feederjail facilities, this offer was rejected in a formal response to Her Honor Judge Smith.\nPreviously, the only Agreement provision in #’s 39 - 58 which were not in substantial compliance\nwas #40 Medical Staffing. As the average daily population decreased, HRRJ and Wellpath were able to\n8 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 9 of 50 PageID# 1108\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nmeet that provision. Therefore, the entire section is now in substantial compliance. This is a great\naccomplishment.\nDuring this reporting period HRRJ moved eight (8) additional provisions from partial compliance\n(PC) to substantial compliance (SC), one moved from pending review (PR) to substantial (SC) and one\nmoved from non to partial compliance. There were none that moved to a lower score this report period,\neven as HRRJ was closing. All staffcontinued to perform their duties admirably.\nThe HRRJ continued to be accredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care\n(NCCHC).\nHRRJ continued to develop their multidisciplinary treatment teams. In the last few months, they\ncontinued to develop individual behavioral management plans based on the team approach.\nHowever, as noted in previous reports, provisions related to the mental health units continued to be\nnon-compliant. The challenge for HRRJ was they lacked the ability to divert mental health inmates to\nmental health units. During the last few months, HRRJ continued to assess all inmates to assure that they\nwere placed safely in units related to their medical and mental health conditions.\nDuring the three years since the beginning ofthe Agreement there has been a desire by senior\nmanagement to meet the requirements ofthe Agreement. However, that desire was not able to be\nrealized due to ongoing staffing issues. For all correctional systems, communication between security\nand healthcare staffneeds to be a high priority. Continued vigilance is needed to assure that,each party\nworks towards the same goal ofproviding care and treatment to those in their care. The missions of\neach, security and healthcare must be understood and respected for continued progress toward meeting\nthe goals ofthe inmates and the provision ofconstitutionally required care.\nThe HRRJA approved a closure bonus for those officers willing to stay on through the closing ofthe\nfacility. This helped to assure that HRRJ had enough staff to reasonably guarantee the safety of staff and\ninmates. During the final visit, the level of stress, and frustration among the staff was palpable and\nunderstandable. It was commendable that all staffat the facility were able to perform their duties as\nrequired and provide care to inmates.\nOver the last year, security changes in personnel had begun to improve the trajectory towards\ncompliance with the Agreement. However, with the closure of HRRJ they will be unable to complete all\nthe substantive provisions by April 1, 2024.\nOne ofthe biggest challenges faced by HRRJ was the available pool ofcandidates remained small,\nin a very competitive market. With over seven (7) localjurisdictions and two (2) regional jail systems\nnot including Department of Corrections Facilities within a short distance of HRRJ competition was\nfierce.\nIt was praiseworthy that HRRJ continued to move partially compliant areas to substantial\ncompliance, even as they prepared for closure ofthe facility. During the last six (6) months HRRJ was\nopen, HRRJ continued to strive to provide constitutionally adequate care.\nThere was one case ofCOVID-19 in thejail during the past six (6) months.\n9 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 10 of 50 PageID# 1109\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nAgreement Section #31 - 38, Medical and Mental Health Care was in substantial compliance for\nover ayear and has been removed from monitoring per court order.\nIntroduction\nThe Monitor has visited the HRRJ continuously since the signing ofthe contract. This allowed for\nobservation ofday-to-day operations ofthe institution and improvements being implemented. During all\nmonitoring visits no area ofthe facility was offlimits and was available for observation and inspection.\nLawyer visits were permitted and were individual outside visitors who visited inmates at HRRJ. Security\nstaffing caused delays in the full implementation ofvisitation and programming.\nA snap shot from December 1, 2023 showed ofthe one hundred-eighty five (185) inmates in\ncustody: one hundred sixty-three (163) with a chronic care diagnosis, four (4) patients with HIV, four\n(4) with Hepatitis C, one (1) currently under treatment, twenty-seven (27) with an endocrine diagnosis,\nsixty-three (63) hypertension/cardiovascular diagnosis, one (1) patient on daily methadone treatment,\ntwo (2) on suboxone treatment, one (1) patient receiving cancer treatment with metastasis and apoor\nprognosis, one (1) paraplegic inmate, one (1) patient on dialysis, two (2) needing assistance with\nactivities of daily living (ADL’s), one (1) Crohn’s with IV infusions, one (1) intellectually disabled,\neighty-one (81) with an SMI (serious mental illness diagnosis), and one (1) Temporary Detention (TDO)\norder completed in September 2023. Out ofan average daily population (ADP) ofone hundred eighty-\nfive as on December 1, 2023, one hundred fifty were on medications and one hundred-fifteen (115) were\non psychiatric medications. There are four (4) patients over 65, and one patient over 70. This\ninformation gives the reader a sense ofthe acuity and challenges faced in the daily routine oftaking care\nof inmates at HRRJ. All patients were transferred to their feederjurisdiction, or to another facility atthe\nrequest ofthe feederjail as ofMarch 22, 2024.\nCol. Vergakis the Superintendent made significant inroads since he was hired in January 2021, and\nhis dialogue with and about staff was open and direct. His goal was to meet the challenges presented by\nthe Agreement while improving HRRJ. It is unfortunate that he was not able to continue with those\nchanges due to the closing ofthe facility. HRRJ made significant progress towards meeting the\nAgreement and this Monitor believed HRRJ would have been able to meet all ofthem with time and\nstaffing under his direction.\nLt. Col. Anderson was a great complement to Col. Vergakis. Lt. Col Anderson and continually\nsought to work towards the changes needed to implement the Agreement and stated to the staff, “we\nneed to provide the best care we can up to the day the last inmate leaves HRRJ.”\nSgt. Hardy, Agreement Coordinator, (Substantial Provision 152) worked hard to forward the\nrequired relevant aggregate data (Substantial Provision 121, a 1 - 29) to the Monitor and United States\nDepartment ofJustice (USDOJ). Data from the reports are reviewed while on-site.\nI wish to thank the security and behavioral health consultants. Without their help HRRJ would not\nhave been able to move so far forward with meeting the Agreement. We thank each ofthem for their\ntireless over the past three years.\n10 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 11 of 50 PageID# 1110\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nA special shout out to the security, staff who worked extremely hard till the last day inmates left the\nfacility to assure a safe and secure environment. Also to the Wellpath staff; Medical Director, Nurse\nPractitioner, Health Services Administrator, Director ofNurses, Charge Nurses, Licensed Practical\nNurses, Certified Mediation Technicians, Dentist, Mental Health Director, Qualified Mental Health\nProfessionals and Psychiatrists who provided health and mental healthcare to the inmates during closure\nofthe facility.\nSubstantive Provisions\nPolicies and Procedures —\nAs with any DOJ consent decree that requires ajail to reform its system, the jail must first take\nseriously changing its policies and procedures to align with new practices so that it can next train its\nstaff. HRRJ and its medical provider undertook this process seriously and quickly. Its medical provider\nrevised most ofits medical and mental health policies within 12 months and the Jail revised many ofits\nsecurity policies soon after, with some exceptions that took longer. This urgency to revise its policies put\nit in a good position to implement training and to work on changing culture.\n19. Within six months ofthe Effective date, thejail will consult with the Monitor to draft and/or\nrevise policies and procedures to incorporate and align them with the provisions in this Agreement -\nHRRJ submitted over one hundred sixty-three (163) policies for review. Out ofthose that are\nspecifically related to the Agreement all were approved. There were two HRRJ employees assigned to\nwork on policies and procedures who are to be commended on finalizing the policies and assuring that\nthis moved to substantial compliance. A team ofofficers also worked diligently to review, make changes\nand process Policies and Procedures to assure they were consistent with the Agreement.\nHRIU is substantially compliant with this provision.\n20. Policies approved will be adopted - Approved policies and procedures continued to have\nongoing training. The Monitor and HRRJ prioritized polices needing to be completed as soon as\npossible. The healthcare policies were the first to be completed.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n21. Begin Implementing policies approved - HRRJ has three (3) months after approval to begin\nimplementing the approved policies. - HRRJ conducted training and implemented approved policies.\nThe training plan was developed by HRRJ security and healthcare administrations and were\nimplemented as soon as policies are approved. Documentation was available for review by the monitor.\nHRRJ improved the collection and tracking ofdata by using the Power Data Management System\n(DMS). This is a computer system where HRRJ was able to track when a policy is approved,\nimplemented and when each staffmember was trained and signed offon the policy.\nHRKJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n11 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 12 of 50 PageID# 1111\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\n22. Fully implemented policies - HRRJ has six (6) months to fully implement policies after approval.\nHRRJ implemented all policies which were approved by the monitor and the United States. Tracking\nthrough DMS made this an easy process.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n23. Annual policy review - Annual review ofpolicies developed is required. Review ofpolicies\nwhich have been in place for at least a year showed that they had been reviewed. No substantial changes\nwere required.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\nStaffing Plan\nHaving adequate security, medical, and mental health staff was a challenge throughout\nimplementation, but the Jail never hid from the challenge and it maintained a month-by-month staff\nvacancies chart which it provided to the monitor and the DOJ.\n24. Staffing plan development - Lt Col Anderson worked with staffto assure that there was\nadequate security staffing during the closure process. As staff left HRRJ worked to consolidate pods to\nassure the safety and security of the institution. Mandatory posts for security were reduced due to\nreduction in the population. HRRJ staffwere offered a bonus if they were willing to continue their\nemployment, however, a number ofstaff left prior to the closing ofthe facility.\nHRRJ provided to the Monitor and United States a monthly update as to the current security, medical\nand mental health numbers ofon-site staff and vacancies.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n25. Staffing Plan Implementation - HRRJ had one year from the date of submission oftheir security,\nmedical and behavioral health staffing plans to fully implement this provision. The closing of HRRJ\ncaused a shifting ofstaff. As noted above, HRRJ created a plan to assure the safety and security ofthe\ninstitution during the closure ofthe facility.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\nTraining\nFor training, HRRJ did not delay. As soon as a policy was approved by the Monitor and the DOJ,\nHRRJ incorporated it into whatever the current training program was, rather than waiting for all the\npolicies to be approved which would have caused unnecessary delays. This ensured that stafftraining\nwas as current as possible, as soon as possible, and helped the Jail reach compliance sooner and protect\ninmates.\n12 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 13 of 50 PageID# 1112\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\n26. Pre-Service and Annual in-service training - A Comprehensive Annual Training Plan was\ndeveloped and implemented for the Jail, which included Orientation for sworn officers, Suicide\nPrevention, Basic Training for new officers, de-escalation training and assignment to a Field Training\nOfficer (FTO) when they completed orientation and In-service and Field training on a continuous basis.\nTraining was increased to provide training in Mental Health, First Aid, and Crisis Intervention training.\nThe Training Plan included the dates and times of scheduled training for each ofthe years the\nAgreement was in place. The training plan used competency-based adult learning techniques. Review of\nrosters showed all incoming staffwere trained and all current staff were being trained according to the\nannual schedule.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n27. Incorporate Agreement requirements into the training curriculum - The Monitor continued to\nmeet with training officers reviewing the annual training plan, type, length, and times oftraining. HRRJ\nfollowed suggestions made and incorporated relevant Agreement requirements into their training\nactivities.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n28. Annual In-service training - HRRJ has six (6) months after new policies have been approved to\nprovide training on those policies. And eighteen (18) months after the effective date ofthe Agreement to\nprovide all training. As new policies were approved, training staff began to incorporate those items into\nthe existing training activities. Rosters were reviewed and training occurred on new policies. Annual in-\nservice training occurred and incorporated any new policies into that training activity.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n29. Training on mental health care - Training on mental health care, suicide prevention occurred\nmonthly using evidence-based standards. New staff were trained prior to being placed at their posts.\nYearly in-service training was scheduled conducted to assure each security and healthcare staffmember\nwas up to date with the training requirement. De-escalation technique training was provided. Medical\nand mental health orientation training for all new hires occurred. Annual training was ongoing, there\nwere no current employees whose required training was behind schedule.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\nSecurity\n30. Security Staffing - Security staffing was a challenge, however, during the closure phase HRRJ\nwas able to assure that the safety and security ofthe institution was upheld. During these last few\nmonths, a concerted effort has been made by HRRJ security staffto assure that jail officers were\navailable and present during pill pass, sick call, and mental health rounds. In late April and early May\n2022 HRRJ initiated aprocess which allowed behavioral health staffto see patients on suicide watch in\nthe “blue room”, unit managers office or small unit room to help alleviate challenges due to staffing.\nThis allowed for efficient use ofoffices as the housing unit officer was able to complete the escort. Also,\n13 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 14 of 50 PageID# 1113\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nthe security Lieutenant has completed escorts to ensure these are completed. The “blue room” as noted\npreviously, is a room specifically designed with blue walls and comfortable chairs in which to see\npatients in a confidential and more comfortable setting. Specific data on “out ofcell activity” is reported\nin #104.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\nMedical and Mental Health Care\nBy Court Order, Her Honor has removed these provisions from monitoring, as all provisions were\nsubstantially compliant:\n31. Medical and Mental Health Prior Records -\n32. Feeder Jail medical records -\n33. Continue Medications -\n34. Medical or Mental Health Request/Sick Call Process\n-\n35. Sick Call Collection -\n36. Sick Call Triage -\n37. Sick Call Tracking -\n38. Sick Call Oversight -\nMedical Care\nDuring this seventh review period, and for much ofthe last three years, the medical care at Hampton\nRoads Regional Jail was much better than that described in the 2018 DOJ Findings Report. As\ndescribed in previous Monitor’s Reports, the Jail had improved in the areas ofmedical intake, medical\nassessments, sick calls, acute and chronic care, outside medical appointments, and medical treatment\nplans.\nSick call improved\nFor example, with respect to sick call, in the 2018 DOJ Findings Report, the DOJ told the story of\ntwo inmates who died from medical issues after requesting sick call that was not appropriately\nresponded to:\n● The first was 69-year-old man, referred to as DD in the 2018 DOJ Findings Report, who died in\nMarch 2016 of severe acute pancreatitis, which was caused by gall stones and coronary artery\ndisease. In the two days prior to his death, he wrote several sick call slips, but there was no\nevidence that he received any medical assistance.\n14of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 15 of 50 PageID# 1114\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n● The second was a 66-year-old man, referred to as BB, who died in August 2016 ofa perforated\nulcer. In the weeks prior, he had submitted requests for medical help related to abdominal pain\nthat were not addressed. In the days prior to his death, he asked to see a medical provider\n“ASAP” because he had not used the bathroom in two weeks. This request was also not\naddressed.\nIn the last few years, sick call requests have been consistently collected, triaged, and attended to in a\ntimely manner, resulting in appropriate care. There have been no incidents that this Monitor is aware of\nwhere a patient made a sick call request that was not followed up on; and thus, this monitor is not aware\nof any bad outcomes for any patients like those described above. Instead, the sick call process has\nimpacted patients in positive ways.\n● Reviewing sick call records for three years the staffhas been diligent with following up on all\nsick call requests. They collected sick call slips every day and had a face-to-face triage. When\nthe sick call nurse had any questions, they would call the provider or have them see the provider\nat the time ofthe sick call visit. This effort was also due to the follow-up ofthe chronic care\nnurse who assured that all chronic care nurses were seen on a routine basis and not languishing\nin their cells.\n● Patient A1 was a 37-year-old patient who in the first month at HRRJ put in a sick call slip that\nthey were having difficulty swallowing. Sick call was assessed, and the patient was sent to the\nprovider for further assessment and treatment as needed. He was seen by the provider and sent\ndirectly to the hospital for a work-up where they received a diagnosis pancreatic cancer. HRRJ\nwas able to obtain a compassionate release in June of 2023. Quick work by the medical staff at\nHRRJ allowed the patient to go home for continuing treatment.\nOutside medical appointments improved\nThe DOJ also told the story ofan inmate who died because the Jail failed to send him to an outside\nmedical appointment in atimely fashion.\n● This 56-year-old man, referred to as GG, died in July 2017 of liver cancer due to hepatitis B and\nhepatitis C infection. Despite the Jail being aware ofa new discovery ofa large liver mass during\nan ultrasound just days before his arrival to the Jail, the Jail did not schedule GG for an outside\nmedical appointment for a biopsy. During the next five weeks, GG was in great pain, was losing\nweight, was becoming increasingly jaundiced, was severely dehydrated, and was having\ndifficulty eating. And yet the Jail never sent him to an outside medical appointment up until his\ndeath five weeks later.\nToday, and for the last two years, outside medical appointments have been scheduled on time and\npatients see their specialist often within days ofscheduling. In part, this is due to the work ofthe staff\nthat work diligently to make appointments for those in need. Moreover, an on-site nurse practitioner\nreviews a registry ofall the appointments to make sure they are followed up on after the patient returns\nfrom the outside appointment. These processes have impacted patients in positive ways.\n● The Off-site appointment nurse was usually able to schedule appointments within one-two weeks\nofthe provider requests. At times it was even faster. Over the three years ofthe Agreement there\n15 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 16 of 50 PageID# 1115\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nwere only two instances where the patient had to wait more than amonth for a neurology\nappointment. The provider saw each patient twice between those times and both able to be seen\nwithin forty-five (45) days ofthe request. The delay was on the off-site provider - neurology -\nwho identified that it was due to new COVID protocols at their office. Neither patient suffered\nany negative sequela from the delay.\nAnother example ofexcellent care was patient A2 who had a diagnosis ofmalignant neoplasm of\nthe nasopharynx and was able to get appointments with the specialists and radiological\nappointments on an ongoing basis without delays.\nA3 was a patient with a familial history ofliver failure who was intellectually delayed and with a\npsychiatric history. It was also noted that they were a poor historian. The excellent follow-thru of\nthe provider staffwas able to get him to off-site care and stabilized as the patient had not\nfollowed up with outside treatment appointments prior to admission to HRRJ.\nA4 was a medically complex patient with a history of stroke, heart attacks, seizures, myotonic\ndystrophy type 2. Had frequent chest pain while incarcerated. Patient also developed fluctuating\nhyper and hypoglycemia. HRRJ off-site coordinator was able to send to outside appointments on\na regular basis for GI, Cardiac and Endocrinology.\n39. Medical Care - HRRJ needed to be substantially compliant with provisions 40 - 58.\nAll provisions are substantially compliant.\nHRRJmet all the belowprovisions and are substantially compliant.\n40. Medical Staffing - Over the past six (6) months HRRJ contractor Wellpath was able to staffthe\nfacility as advised by the Monitor. As the ADP was reduced, Wellpath was able to staffthe facility to\nassure that patient care was not compromised in any way. Even with some ofthe staff leaving due to the\nclosure the Health Services Administrator (HAS) and Director ofNurses (DON) were able to move staff\naround to assure that appropriate staffwere available for all shifts at the facility. They assured that a\nprovider was available every day for any emergencies and to keep up with chronic care patients.\nRegistered Nurses (RN’s), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPN’s) and Registered Medical Assistants\n(RMA’s) were available on each shift. Behavioral health was also staffed appropriately and will be\naddressed in #60 below.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n41. Medical Intake - During the closure period there were six (6) new admissions. All had\nappropriate intake screens completed and were seen by the Nurse Practitioner. Over the past three (3)\nyears this is an area that has continued to improve.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n42. Medical screening factors - As noted above out ofthe six (6) records reviewed there were no\nmissing components in any ofthe reviewed records. All components ofthe Agreement as noted in this\nitem were present in all the records reviewed.\n16 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 17 of 50 PageID# 1116\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n43. Medical Assessments - As a routine HRRJ conducts the medical assessment during the intake\nprocess or within one day of admission. Chart review ofthe six (6) intake records found none that did\nnot have a routine medical assessment completed either on admission. The sick call process has\ncontinued to be on track. Review ofninety-six (96) medical sick call records and eighty-two (82)\nbehavioral health records showed emergent, urgent, and routine assessments were completed in the\nrequired timeframe. They were all in the sick call logs.\nHRRJis substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n44. Emergent Medical Assessments - The assessments are based on Policy E - 02 Receiving\nScreening and E - 08 Nursing Assessment Protocols (NAP). As this substantive provision addresses both\nintake and sick call, I will address them separately. An intake assessment by a NP is to be completed on\nall inmates being admitted into the facility according to the above policy. During this six (6) month\nperiod the six (6) assessments were conducted on entry into the facility. There were no refusals noted in\nthe records reviewed. Since every admission into the facility is seen by aregistered nurse and a nurse\npractitioner, the emergent and urgent classifications are rarely used in this context. Admissions are from\nfeederjails.\nReviewing patient records, security logbooks and clinic notes all emergent calls to the medical area\nare dealt with immediately, four (4) records were reviewed. Security policies allow for ajail officer to\ncontact medical at any time they feel it is needed to care for an inmate. Observation over the past three\n(3) years has shown thatjail officers are aware of and call medical when they notice any medical or\nmental health issues with an inmate. Tracking is occurring for those that may be sent to medical due to\nan emergent or urgent issue. Medical and security track those that are send for evaluation and treatment,\nas needed.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n45. Urgent Medical Assessments - As noted above assessments are based on Policy E - 02 and E -\n08. Data is the same. There are no emergent assessments during the intake process from records\nreviewed. Tracking through the sick call identified two (2) that were marked urgent. All were identified\nas mental health issues and were seen immediately by a mental health professional, and issues addressed\naccording to chart review.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n46. Routine Medical Assessments (Intake) - Comprehensive health assessments are conducted\nwithin fourteen (14) days ofentering the facility - At HRRJ intake screening assessments are completed\nby aNP during the admission process, or within twenty-four (24) hours. Out ofsix (6) intake\nassessments, all were completed on intake. All intake assessments are documented in the medical\nrecord.\n17 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 18 of 50 PageID# 1117\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n47. Routine Medical Assessments (Sick Call) - Ofthe ninety-six (96) sick call assessments that were\nreviewed, all were seen in the required 72-hour time frame. All had adequate documentation of\ntreatment in the electronic record. Tracking and completion of sick calls following the Nursing\nPathways. It was noted that the RN staff providing sick call services completed documentation and\ntreatment as required. Wellpath has taken action to assure that all nurses are following the established\nstandards and protocols, and it shows. This area has shown great improvement over the past two (2)\nyears and sick call nurse staff are to be commended for following up with all sick call standards.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n48. Acute Care - Review ofcharts and discussions with security, nursing, behavioral health, inmate\ninterviews and provider staff indicate there were no instances where an inmate identified was not seen\nimmediately for a serious acute need. Five (5) records were reviewed for acute treatment. Two (2) ofthe\nrecords included were where inmates who had made statements or actions ofa self-directed violence\nnature or identified as in a mental health crisis. One (1) ofthe two (2) were seen by nursing and\nbehavioral health staffand placed on suicide watch within the required time frame. The other was\ncounseled and agreed to a plan of safety. Continued follow-up by the QMHP staffresulted in positive\noutcomes and medication adherence. HRRJ policy number seventeen point two (17.2) states - “All\nsworn staff have the authority to contact medical concerning an inmate’s illness or missed medication\nwithout having to obtain permission from supervisory staff first”, “Ifsworn staff feel an inmate(s) is\nhaving a life threatening emergency do not hesitate to call a code 10-52” and. Ifthe inmate(s) medical\ncondition is serious but not an emergency, staff have the authority to take the inmate to medical without\nseeking permission from supervisory staff first. Once in main medical or housing unit clinics inform\nyour immediate supervisor, and an incident report must be completed.” Review during subsequent visits\nhave continued to verify this provision. Tracking ofthis item is consistent now because HRRJ is\nproviding a Medical Incident Report spreadsheet to the Monitor. Records were reviewed from security,\nmedical and mental health to review this provision.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n49. Chronic care - All inmates are seen for an assessment for chronic care during the intake process.\nThe chronic care clinical evaluation was conducted by aNP during the intake process or within twenty-\nfour (24) hours. Chart review of six (6) intake screenings during this period, found all inmates had\nreceived a routine medical/chronic care assessment on intake.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n50. Chronic Care Registry - The jail will maintain a chronic care registry. There has been a\nconsistent chronic care RN for over two years. Review oftwenty-two (22) charts on the registry found\nthe process had identified all patients on the chronic care registry, diagnosis, date of last visit and date\nfor the next visit. All items in the Agreement are met. The chronic care nurse follows up with providers\nto assure that appointments are made, checks the charts to assure that the providers are indicating degree\n18 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 19 of 50 PageID# 1118\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nof control. This continues to be a major step in assuring that HRJIJ addresses the ongoing chronic care\nneeds ofpatients. It is interesting to note that the chronic care nurse took over HSA duties during the last\nfive months at HRRJ while still performing chronic care duties for the institution.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n51. Chronic Care Plan of Care - Review oftwenty-two (22) charts in the registry found that all\npatients had a plan ofcare. Review ofthe charts found no inconsistencies between providers when\nidentilying degree ofcontrol and consistency with providers orders for when to return for a follow up\nappointment. All provider staff followed the same criteria when identifying degree ofchronic care\ncontrol and scheduling follow up visits to a chronic care appointment.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n52. Chronic Care Protocol - Review ofthe twenty-two (22) charts found that all providers were\nusing the same criteria and follow up visits based on their assessment ofwhether their condition was\n“poor”, “faif or “good”. Provider notes indicated when there was a desire to see the patient earlier to\nassure that medication, dietary or other changes to the treatment plan were showing positive results.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n53. Medical Diagnosis - Review ofcharts in; intake six (6), chronic care twenty-two (22), sick call\none hundred thirty (130) medical, acute care eighteen (18) found all had diagnosis for identified medical\nproblems. A problem list was present in all charts reviewed where a medical condition was diagnosed.\nPatient education activities were noted in the charts.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n54. Medical Specialist Appointments - There was an identified healthcare staffmember responsible\nfor scheduling medical specialty appointments. The spread sheet (specialty appointment registry - offsite\nappointment registry) was reviewed at each on site visit. As noted in previous reports many ofthe\nappointments are within days of scheduling.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n55. Medical Specialist Registry' - There was a medical specialist registry, and the registry was up to\ndate and contained all the required elements. The on-site nurse practitioner reviewed and signed the\nregistry assuring there were no delays in care. Tracking for any urgent referrals was present. The registry\nidentified the reason for a delay, ifit occurred, and the health care provider created a note in the chart\nidentifying if the delay is acceptable or if the patient needs to be seen in an expedited manner. There\n19 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 20 of 50 PageID# 1119\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nwere no delays noted over the past six (6) month period. On site providers are required to write a note in\nthe chart ifthere is a delay ofmore than 30 days. The registry was reviewed at each on-site visit. It\nwas\nnoted that some ofthe medical specialist appointments were within 24 - 96 hours after the request had\nbeen made. This continues to be an amazing accomplishment. It is important to note that recent reports\nof a lack of specialist have not affected the specialist appointments needed for those at HRRJ. This is in\npart to the work ofthe staffthat work diligently to make appointments for those in need.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n56. Medical Follow-up care - On return from an outside appointment, patients were brought to the\nclinic area and vital signs are taken and documents received from the outside provider were reviewed.\nThe documentation was then forwarded to the on-site provider who reviewed the information and\ncreated a note related to the outside providers assessment ofthe patient. Review often (10) records over\nthe course ofthe six (6) month period prior to closure showed aone hundred percent (100%) completion\nrate. Systems were developed and were followed assuring the patient was seen on return and\ndocumentation given to the provider for follow up. There was no patient who was not seen,\ndocumentation was present.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n57. Medical Treatment Plans - As noted above, Review ofcharts in; intake six (6), chronic care\ntwenty-two (22), sick call one hundred thirty (130) medical, acute care eighteen (18) all had treatment\nplans which tracked active problems. A problem list was present in all charts reviewed where a medical\ncondition was diagnosed. Patient education activities were noted in the charts.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n58. Medical Treatment - Inmates were scheduled for chronic care, labs, wound care, finger sticks for\ndiabetes, EKG’s, vital signs and other testing. The electronic medical record system ERMA and the\nPoint ofCare Companion (POCC) tracked when patients were scheduled for medical treatment, and\nwhen it had been completed. The POCC was also used to administer medications as well as certain\ntreatments. After review ofthe POCC and the ERMA system and review of sixty (60) records this\nprovision continues to be substantially compliant.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\nMental Health Care\nRegarding mental health care, the jail’s security and mental health staffworked hard to improve\nintakes, assessments, and treatment plans. One indicator ofa good mental health system is suicide\nprevention. Following the December 2018 DOJ Findings Report, the Jail experienced 57 months -\nnearly 5 years - without a suicide until one occurred in October 2023. This is quite an accomplishment\n20 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 21 of 50 PageID# 1120\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nand is due to the hard work ofthe mental health and security staffto keep inmates healthy and safe. Part\nofthat hard work included changes to its screening procedures to ensure that intake screening was\nconducted by a nurse with a mental health background, which was not the case prior to the DOJ\ninvolvement. This mental health nurse ensure inmates were identified during the first days in the Jail as\nto whether they needed mental health treatment. In addition, mental health staffimproved treatment\nplans making them more individualized. In the past, these plans were not individualized nor\ncomprehensive. These new procedures have impacted patients in positive ways. For example:\n● A5 was identified by staffupon intake as vulnerable and was unable to answer questions or give\na good history. They had been on the Mental health unit at the feeder jail. During their initial\nincarceration at HRRJ they were refusing to eat. The Jail’s mental health team’s assessment\ndetermined they were acutely psychotic and refusing medication and that needed to be stabilized\nat an outside mental health facility. A Temporary Detention Order was approved, and they were\nstabilized at the State hospital. They returned to HRRJ after stabilization and continued to\nimprove prior to transfer. The QMHP staff worked was able to recognize that a higher level of\ncare was needed for this patient and due to their continued MH assessment sent him to a higher\nlevel ofcare (next section) to assure he was treated appropriately.\n● A6 was a patient who had repeated mental health hospitalizations from the Jail and repeated\nplacement on suicide watch. They had a history ofbeing physically and verbally aggressive. The\nJail’s mental health team created an individualized and structured step-down treatment plan from\nsuicide watch that allowed transitioning to a Mental Health Unit where they would be out ofthe\ncell most ofthe day. The Jail was successful with keeping the inmate safe and even helping to\nbe released from HRRJ without a placement on suicide watch or a TDO 60 days prior to his\nrelease. Discharge plans were present and the local CSB was involved in placement and follow¬\nup.\nHigher level ofcare andcontinued stability improved.\nThe Jail also improved at identifying whether a patient needed a higher level ofcare, sending the patient\nto the higher level ofcare, and then once the patient was sent back to HRRJ, continuing to stabilize them\nwith a plan. This was not always occurring appropriately prior to the 2018 DOJ Finding Report. For\nexample:\n● A7 This 38-year-old with a history ofschizoaffective disorder bipolar type arrived to HRRJ\nfrom a feederjail acutely psychotic, verbally and physically aggressive, and refusing\nmedication. HRRJ worked quickly to obtain a TDO and send the patient to ESH, where the\npatient was stabilized. HRRJ was able to keep the patient medication-adherent from the\npatient's return to HRRJ until discharge.\n● A8 This was a 25-year-old patient with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia and generalized anxiety\ndisorder. One first admission to HRRJ they were verbally and physically aggressive, refusing\nmeds if they weren't name brand. HRRJ worked to stabilize patient and was unsuccessful.\nPatient was sent out to ESH for stabilization. They returned to HRRJ and HRRJ was able to\ncontinue the stabilization with medication. Patient was discharged to a CSB group home.\n21 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 22 of 50 PageID# 1121\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n59. HRRJ is to provide constitutionally adequate mental health care.\nHRJU will need to be substantially compliant with provisions 59 - 99 to obtain substantial\ncompliance with this overall provision.\nHRRJ must meet all the below criteria to become compliant with mental health care component of\nthe Agreement. No grade will be given at this time. Pending Review, PR.\n60. Mental Health Staffing - The jail will increase mental health staffing and increasing the hours\nthat staff with higher credentials are onsite on evenings and weekends. During this reporting period\nmental health staffing was appropriate. Wellpath worked to stabilize the number ofqualified mental\nhealth providers (QMHP) and psychiatric staff. There were three QMHP on site till the last patient was\nreleased to their feederjail. Psychiatric staffcontinued to be available via tele-psych and patients were\nseen on a continuous basis till the last SMI patient left the institution. One ofthe QMHP staff filled in\nfor the mental health director over the last three (3) month period.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n61. Mental Health Intake - Mental Health intake was reviewed at each on site visit during this\nmonitoring period. Six (6) charts were reviewed. All had a mental health intake screen completed. Notes\nwere included in each chart; all elements ofthe Agreement were included in the intake process. The\npolicy and process are in place. There were no times when an intake assessment was missed.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n62. Mental Health Screening Factors - All the mental health screening factors required in the\nAgreement are included in the intake screening document. The process is in place and the policy has\nbeen approved.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n63. Mental Health Assessments - Mental Health assessments were reviewed at each on site visit. Six\n(6) intake and eighty-eight (88) mental health sick call charts were reviewed. All had a mental health\nassessment completed at intake. Notes were included in each chart; all elements ofthe Agreement were\nincluded in the assessment. The process and policy are approved and in place. Over the past three years\nduring on-site visits, I was able to observe intake processes. Communication between intake nursing\nstaff, QMHP, security staff and patient were observed and critical to the process. It is great how much\ncommunication occurs with security intake and medical/behavioral health staff. Each had a critical role\nto play in the intake process.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n64. Emergent Mental Health Assessments - Temporary Detention Orders (TDO) are being utilized,\nthere were seventy-five (75) TDO’s submitted for action over the past three (3) year period. The rate of\n22 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 23 of 50 PageID# 1122\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nacceptance for TDO’s during this period fits in the parameters. This shows that HRJU mental health staff\nare assessing and evaluating the need for a TDO appropriately and correctly using that process to the\nadvantage ofinmates. Inmates who express suicidal ideation or harm are immediately referred for\nmental health follow up by a QMHP by a phone call to mental health.\nSuicide prevention training outlined the criteria for emergent, urgent, and routine referrals to MH staff.\nIn the absence of on-site MH staff, all emergent referrals to MH are seen by the charge nurse. For all\nemergent referrals the charge nurse submits an electronic emergent referral in ERMA and calls the MH\nDirector via phone when MH is not onsite. All seventy-five (75) TDO referrals over the past three years\nwere reviewed for authentication ofthe system. Tracking was occurring and all were noted in the log.\nAs noted in #48 above HRRJjail staff call the mental health staff directly ifthere is an emergent need\nfor assessment. A staff person is always on call to receive the call on off hours. There were no emergent\n(non TDO) referrals through electronic or phone call during this reporting period. Emergent referrals\nwere documented and tracked. There was no incident noted where an emergent inmate referral was not\nseen, or a referral lost.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n65. Urgent Mental Health Assessments - As noted above a referral process and criteria was identified\nand is in place. Two (2) urgent mental health assessments were reviewed. A mental health assessment by\na QMHP is part ofthe referral process. Tracking log of the referral process is present. The four (4)\ncriteria required in the Agreement are part ofthe assessment process and is being noted in the patient\nchart. Tracking the exact time frame for the referral and action taken was noted. Progress notes by the\nQMHP addressed items required in the Agreement. Again, due to the acute attention by mental health\nand security staff all patients who had needed an urgent assessment were provided such in the time\nframe required by the Agreement. Sick call staff changes have helped this process.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with theprovision.\n66. Routine Mental Health Assessments (Intake) - As noted in 63 above, all inmates admitted to the\nfacility had a mental health assessment during the intake procedure. Six (6) charts were reviewed. All\nhad a mental health assessment completed at intake. Notes were included in each chart; all elements of\nthe Agreement were included in the assessment. The process is in place, the policy is in place and being\nfollowed. During previous on-site visits I was able to observe the intake processes. There was great\ncommunication between the nursing intake staff, QMHP staff and custody staff and the patient.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n67. 14-Day Mental Health Check-in - All inmates who are NOT assigned to the mental health\ncaseload will be briefly screened within 14 days ofbeing admitted into the facility. All inmates have\naccess least twice a day by pill pass staff. A fourteen (14) day logbook has been created to capture the\nnecessary information. The six (6) patients admitted during this period were seen by QMHP staff.\n23 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 24 of 50 PageID# 1123\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n68. Routine Mental Health Assessments (Sick Call) - Review of eighty-eight (88) sick call slips\nshowed that all had been completed within the required five (5) day period. Sick call requests where the\npatient asks for ajournal, crayons, or other items not requiring an individual session are conducted cell\nside. Most others are conducted in the multi-purpose or other confidential area ofthe pod when security\nstaffing allows. This is a challenge on weekends and holidays. Mental health tracked all encounters to\nevaluate where encounters were held to assure that those requiring a confidential setting are conducted\nin such a location. Over this past reporting period there was an increase to 90% ofthe encounters\noccurring in a confidential setting ifthe patient agreed. A challenge many times was that the patient did\nnot wish to leave their cell to go to a more appropriate setting.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n69. Nature of Mental Health Assessment - Six (6) mental health assessments from intake were\nreviewed while on site and eighty-eight (88) from sick call were reviewed. All assessments had the\nrequired items ofthe Agreement. When assessments are completed in the intake area they are conducted\nin a confidential setting. Ifa sick call assessment is conducted in other areas ofthe facility, some\nassessments, eighty (80) were conducted in a confidential setting adjacent to the main cell area. Only\neight (8) were conducted cell side. Either the inmate didn't wish to come out oftheir cell or was a\nsecurity threat to the QMHP. This continues to be a significant improvement and keeps them in\nsubstantial compliance. The challenge is when the assessment was done in a location where true\nconfidentiality was not available such as through the cell door. The DOJ CRIPA Notice mentioned\ninmates referred to this as “Crack Therapy”.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n70. Mental Health Treatment Plans - The jail will assure that appropriate individualized treatment\nplans are developed for inmate with mental health needs. The initial treatment plan for those inmates\nwith a mental health diagnosis are developed during the admission intake assessment. Ifduring\nincarceration an inmate develops a MH diagnosis after seeing a psychiatrist, a treatment plan will be\ncreated at that time.\nHRRJ will need to be compliant with 70 - 74 to obtain substantial compliance with treatment plan\nsection ofthe Agreement.\nHRRJmust meet all the below criteria to become compliant with mental health treatmentplan\ncomponent ofthe Agreement. No grade will be given at this time. Pending Review, PR.\n71. Timing for initial treatment plan - Initial treatment plan development occurs at the time of intake\nfor those with an SMI diagnosis for those on a psychiatric medication, and those identified through the\ninitial mental health assessment in need ofa mental health treatment plan. All intakes (those with an\nSMI diagnosis and those without) had an initial intake mental health assessment. Ifthe patient was on a\npsychiatric medication or had mental health needs an initial treatment plan was created. Ongoing\nupdates occurred according to the schedule created by the Agreement and Mental Health Director. There\nwere no instances where a treatment plan was not created for those individuals identified as SMI on\n24 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 25 of 50 PageID# 1124\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nintake or, were on a psychiatric medication. There were one hundred ten (110) treatment plan records\nthat were reviewed. All were complete.\nTreatment plans change ifa diagnosis was changed by the psychiatrist. There were no instances\nwhere a change in medication caused an issue related to the treatment plan. During tele-psych visits, any\nchanges in diagnosis or medication were identified on the daily roster to assure that information is\nprovided to the behavioral health staff. The psychiatric RN or QMHP reviewed the information and\nmade sure it was transmitted to the appropriate behavioral health staff.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n72. Multidisciplinary team treatment plan update (MDT) - There were eight (8) SMI/special needs\nindividual behavior management plans based on the multidisciplinary treatment team approach\ncompleted during this reporting period. QMHP staffworked with security staffto try and initiate\nindividual behavior management plans when possible. There were two (2) examples this reporting\nperiod where individual behavior management plans were used to great effect for both the patient and\nthe institution. This effort showed that these plans can make a difference for both.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n73. Requirements for treatment plan - Ofthe one hundred ten (110) treatment plans that were\nreviewed, all had met the requirements, however, HRRJ still struggled to make this a multidisciplinary\nteam treatment plan. The treatment plans were thorough, comprehensive, and included requirements in\nthe Agreement. The plans components were individualized to meet the needs ofthe inmates. In the\nreview, goals were followed. These continue to be strategies employed by the QMHP staff. A challenge\nwas the check offs used in the forms. Staffhad begun to address the multiple diagnosis’ in a more robust\nfashion as there were patients who had multiple symptomatology that was addressed.\nSuggestions for improvement which can be used at any correctional institution included mini-case\nconferences with staff, presenting problems and history coming into the jail, review oftreatment plan to\nreflect what is going on now with the client, briefintervention to address the current presenting\nproblems and looping back in a month to evaluate and check in to see if the suggestions assisted\ntreatment goals.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n74. Timing for Treatment plan review - Of the one hundred ten (110) treatment plans that were\nreviewed, all had met the appropriate time frame requirements. The treatment plans were thorough,\ncomprehensive, and included requirements in the Agreement. The plans components were\nindividualized to meet the needs ofthe inmates. During this reporting period, QMHP staff were diligent\nin changing treatment plans based on change of diagnosis, suicide watch and other relevant factors based\non sessions with the patient. As noted in previous reports, treatment plans were not changed when there\nwas only amedication change. Compliance has continued to be 100 percent (100%).\n25 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 26 of 50 PageID# 1125\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n75. Mental Health Treatment - HRRJ will provide treatment that adequately addresses their serious\nmental health needs in a timely and appropriate manner.\nQMHP, Psych NP and Psychiatrists provided care and treatment to those incarcerated at HRRJ. I\nHRRJ must meet provisions 75 - 78 in order to obtain substantial compliance with mental health\ntreatment provision.\nHRRJmust meet all the below criteria to become compliant with mental health treatment component\nofthe Agreement. No grade will be given at this time. Pending Review, PR\n76. Mental Health Therapy - There were eighty-nine (89) individual QMHP therapy sessions from\nOctober 2023 through the end of March 2024 (closure of the facility). Sessions were held in a\nconfidential space and were developed by the QMHP to meet the needs ofthe client. Each client was\ndifferent and the need for individual or group sessions was developed by a qualified mental health\nprofessional (based on the clinical judgement) based on the individual needs ofthe client. There were\nfour (4) group sessions with a total ofsix (6) inmates participating. These “group” sessions were\nconducted for those on suicide watch. There were fewer patients on suicide watch during this reporting\nperiod due to the low census and the fact that many ofthose who in the past had been on suicide watch\nhad been returned to their feeder jail. Observation during mental health rounds showed that at times a\nroutine “Check” turns into ahalfhour to 45-minute therapy session. Tracking was much better during\nthis reporting period. Security was also capturing data on group and individual session provided for\nthose on suicide watch on a tracking sheet.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n77. Mental Health Inpatient Care - As noted in provision #64 above, Temporary Detention Orders\n(TDO) were utilized and during the past three (3) years there were eighty (80) TDO’s submitted for\naction which were approved. During the Agreement period there were only three (3) TDO requests that\nwere rejected. This was an exceptionally good outcome which shows that the QMHP staff were doing\nproper assessments. Eighty (80) patients were sent to a higher level ofcare over the three-and-a-half-\nyear period ofmonitoring. This showed that HRRJ mental health staff were assessing and evaluating the\nneed for aTDO appropriately and correctly using that process to the advantage of inmates. This effort\nhelped to stabilize the inmates. Previously, the lack of access to a higher level ofassessment and care led\nto circumstances and outcomes that were a contributing factor in the DOJ opening its investigation.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n78. Confidential Mental Health Treatment - During this last period there were a few more inmates who\nwere seen in a confidential setting as the census was reduced and staffing was adequate. The number of\nindividual sessions which were held in a confidential setting increased during this review period to\neighty-nine (89). Some ofthose on suicide watch were seen in a confidential setting, (in the blue room)\nthis helped to assure that those interviews were conducted in a professional and confidential manner. As\n26 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 27 of 50 PageID# 1126\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nnoted previously, not all patients wish to come out into the blue room or into another space. There were\noccasions where the inmate asked to be in the blue room to de-escalate. This was a significant step for\nHRRJ and a positive move in support of inmates who were SMI. Tracking ofout-of-cell and\nconfidential was occurring by security.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n79. Psychotropic Medications - review of eighty-six (86) charts showed psychotropic medications were\nordered in a timely manner and consistently provided to patients in all areas ofthe institution. Review of\nthe Medication Administration Record System (MARS) for those patients showed that they were\ndelivered as ordered - unless refused by the patient. HRRJ had no challenges ordering and getting non-\nformulary medications, and re-ordering ofmedications. There were no instances noted during on-site\nweekend visits where medications were not present, or medication delivery was not provided. The\npsychiatric nurse was reviewing all psychiatric medications and had a tracking system to assure\ncompliance.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n80. Psychotropic Medication follow-up - Review oftwenty (20) charts where medication changes\nhad occurred showed that two-week, thirty (30), sixty (60) and ninety (90) day follow ups had occurred.\nIt was impossible to follow-up for those patients who were discharged back to their feederjail. The\nPsychiatric NP saw patients on site to assure medication follow-up. All psychiatric providers were given\ninstructions regarding the need for follow up as required by the Agreement. A system was in place to\ncheck on the number ofmedication changes and methods to assure that follow up was conducted\naccording to the Agreement. Patient lists were produced by appointment, patients were brought down by\nsecurity, seen in tele-psych or by the psychiatric NP in the clinic area and returned to their housing units.\nThe process went smoothly and without incident during the weekdays ofobservation. The psychiatric\nRN was responsible for tracking this system. Ifa psychiatrist is on vacation or a lockdown occurs, the\npsychiatric nurse saw the patient and reported to the psychiatrist or psychiatric NP assuring continued\ncompliance with this provision.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n81. Psychotropic Medication Compliance - If a medication was refused, the procedure was a follow\nup visit by the psychiatric RN or QMHP and subsequent appointment with the psychiatrist or psychiatric\nnurse practitioner as necessary was then conducted. The psychiatric RN worked to assure that all\ninmates were seen as required. There was a mental health tracking system for compliance. The current\nMedication Administration Record System (MARS) identified when a patient refused a medication. The\nMental Health Director reviewed all refusals. The Psychiatric Registered Nurse had responsibility for\ntracking medication compliance. Behavioral health log for Medication refusals started in June 2021 and\ncontinued through the closure ofthe facility. There were eighty-two (82) records ofmedication refusals\nreviewed by the Monitor all were compliant.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n27 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 28 of 50 PageID# 1127\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n82. Anti-Psychotic Medication Use - There was an anti-psychotic medication registry. Complete review\nofthe list showed that it is reviewed by the lead Psychiatrist. Notes were sent to other provider staff\non\nsuggested changes to the medication regimen. This list was forwarded to the Monitor for review and\nreviewed by the mental health director. Tracking of changes suggested was in place. Psychiatry patients\nwere seen in atele-psych format with the psychiatrist or on site by the psychiatric NP. Observation of\nthe process for tele-psych during the weekdays was effective. The Psychiatric NP saw clients who may\nhave been med non-compliant or where a change was requested by the lead psychiatrist.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n83. Medication Administration Records Audits - MARs audits were conducted weekly by the\npsychiatric RN. Results ofthe audits showed completeness and accuracy.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n84. Serious Mental Health Registry - The SMI registry was created and was sent to the Monitor and\nUSDOJ once a month. The data included, diagnosis, date of last QMHP/Psychiatrist visit, date of next\nvisit. The Monitor and USDOJ also received weekly updates prior to the ICC meetings.\nHRRJ is substantially compliantwith the provision.\n85. Suicide Prevention - From observation and reviewed notes on charts and security records HRRJ\nwas vigilant and proactive regarding suicidal potentials in the inmate population. There had not been a\ndeath by suicide at HRRJ since December 31, 2018. However, there was one event which led to a death\nby suicide in October 2023. The patient was in general population at the time and NOT on suicide\nwatch. HRRJ had gone fifty-eight (58) months without a successful suicide. An M and M was convened\nin November. Suicide Prevention Signs were present for HRRJ to remind them ofthe potential warning\nsigns ofsuicide.\nHRRJ must meet all the below criteria to become compliant with the suicideprevention component of\nthe Agreement. No grade will be given at this time. Pending Review, PR\n86. Suicide Prevention Training - Suicide prevention training curriculum was revised with input\nfrom the Monitor and includes all topics required in the Agreement and was being used for suicide\nprevention training. Due to the closure, training activities ceased, however, they were occurring as\nindicated on the training schedule. Suicide training was conducted monthly. Suicide Prevention Training\nwas an eight (8) hour training. Sign-in sheets were copied and sent to the monitor and USDOJ monthly.\nThe annual 2-hour training was initiated and provided for sworn officers. A schedule was maintained by\nHRRJ training staffto assure all staff had the required training. Training was provided by Qualified\nprofessionals. CPR training was part ofthe New Employee Orientation (NEO) training curriculum. One\nNEO and two in-service annual trainings were conducted each month. Crisis Intervention Training (CIT)\nwas re-initiated in August of2021.\n28 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 29 of 50 PageID# 1128\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n87. Suicide Risk Assessment - Suicide risk assessments were conducted using a comprehensive risk\nassessment tool. HRRJ initiated aprocess which allowed behavioral health staff to see patients on\nsuicide watch in the “blue room”. This was aroom specifically designed with blue walls and\ncomfortable chairs in which to see patients in a confidential and more comfortable setting. One\nchallenge was that some patients weren’t comfortable coming out oftheir cells for a confidential\nsession. Those on watch were asked to come out oftheir cells for two meals each day which began in\nFeb. of2023. A snapshot ofthe tracking ofout-of-cell activities on the unit is under #104a. The\nbehavioral health staffwas tracking where patients on suicide watch were seen and the reasons.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n88. Suicide Watch - Suicide watches continued to improve. In earlier reports it was noted that\ninmates who were not on watch were housed next to those on watch. This created a challenge for the\nofficer responsible for the watch as contraband was passed to an inmate on watch and caused self-\ninjurious behavior. This changed and only those on suicide watch were housed in the area. Review of\n“Inmate Watch Sheets” show that the officers on watch are providing 15-minute irregular checks. The\nAgreement states that “constant observation requires that a staff member have an unobstructed view of\nthe prisoner at all times”. The new improved cells provided an unobstructed view. HRRJ made this a\npriority and new cell doors with an unobstructed view were ordered and were in place in all areas where\nsuicide watches take place. This was critical for the officer to be able to always see the inmate,\nespecially when on a constant watch. Suicide watch sheets were reviewed by HRRJ administrative staff\non an ongoing basis to assure that the procedures and documentation follow policy. The officer on\n“watch” duty communicated with the QMHP assigned to provide clinical services to those on watch, and\nthe QMHP with the officer. This established a good relationship between the QMHP and watch officer.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n89. Suicidal Prisoner Housing - HRRJ is to provide suicide housing that is clinically appropriate with\nsight lines that permit the appropriate level ofstaffsupervision. As noted above, the sight lines were\nadequate for the task. All cells in the area were suicide resistant and doors have Lexan gauge windows\nwhich allowed for unobstructed sight lines from “watch” staff. This provision mixes physical plant\nissues, “housing” with “clinically appropriate mental health care”, treatment. The next provision section\ndeals specifically with “treatmenf’. Therefore, for housing HRRJ is substantially complaint. Clinical\ntreatment is dealt with in section #90 a- e to be more focused on treatment issues. A timeline ofthe\nimprovements to the suicide watch area is noted below:\nFall 2021 - Lexan doors installed with line ofsight available for all those on suicide watch\nMay 2022 - Blue room created, used intermittently, challenges for continued use due to door issues\nSept 2022 - D rings installed to pod picnic tables for chow and group sessions, delay in implementing\ngroups due to staffing\nDec 2022 - groups out ofcell Ix/week\nFeb 2023 - TV is on for 2 hours each day, sometimes\nmore\n29 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 30 of 50 PageID# 1129\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nFeb 2023 - meals out ofcell\nMar 2023 - painted the 1-3-D unit\nApr 2023 - door to blue room changed to lexan and taken out oflock position to allow pts access to\nroom individually for “down time” as necessary\nAugust 2023 - security tracking out-of-cell activities\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n90. Suicidal Prisoner Treatment - HRRJ will ensure suicidal inmates receive access to adequate\nmental health treatment and follow up care.\na. and b. placement on suicide precautions was made only pursuant to an adequate, timely (within\nfour hours of identification, or sooner ifclinically indicated), and confidential assessment and was\ndocumented, including level of observation, housing location, and conditions ofthe precautions and\nseen by a QMHP within 12 hours or 16 on weekends -\nInmates were placed on suicide watch within the required four (4) hour timeframe. Patients were\nevaluated by a QMHP within the required twelve (12) hour or sixteen (16) hours on weekends time\nframe. Confidential assessment ofthose inmates expressing suicidal ideation prior to placement on\nsuicide watch occurred, either in the clinical area, in atreatment room, or in the blue room or\nmultipurpose room as appropriate. As noted above, HRRJ initiated a process which allowed\nbehavioral health staffto see patients on suicide watch in the “blue room”. This was a room\nspecifically designed with blue walls and comfortable chairs in which to see patients in a\nconfidential and more comfortable setting. Assessments were done in that setting, as much as\npossible. Documentation on the level of watch and conditions and precautions were provided by the\nQMHP to security staffdaily, after the in person visit.\nc. patients are offered out-of-cell time as least four hours per day.\nSee # 104a for a snapshot of out-of-cell activities and tracking. During the daily visits by the QMHP,\npatients were offered to be seen in the blue room for clinical sessions. They were also offered\nshowers by HRRJ jail officer staffthree times per week. HRRJ began in December to offer out-of-\ncell time during two - three meals every day. HRRJ also had group sessions with those on watch\neach week. Individual sessions also occurred. These were positive steps for HRRJ and evaluation of\nthe success ofthese efforts would have continued to be reviewed. Additional out-of-cell time was\nbeing considered.\nd. QMHP interaction and treatment.\nAs noted above, QMHP staff interacted daily with those on suicide watch and provided out-of-cell\nclinical sessions in the blue room when possible, and when the patient agreed. As noted in “c” one\ngroup session per week and a handful of individual therapy sessions had begun to increase the access\nofpatients to treatment.\nDuring on-site visits QMHP visits were observed for those on suicide watch. Observation on\nweekends showed a QMHP was available seven (7) days a week providing the required assessment\nand interaction.\n30 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 31 of 50 PageID# 1130\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\ne. discharge from suicide watch by a QMHP and follow-up\nDischarge from watch was approved by a QMHP or a Psychiatrist. After an inmate had been\ndischarged from suicide watch, QMHP’s would visit the inmate on a regular schedule, even more\noften than was required in the Agreement. Licensed MH staff saw the patient twenty-four (24) hours\nafter release from suicide watch, then three (3) days following, then five (5) days following, for a\ntotal ofthree (3) follow up visits within nine (9) days ofremoval from suicide watch. Both QMHP\nstaff and the Mental Health Director took responsibility for seeing inmates who were in, or had been\nreleased, from suicide watch status. Review oftreatment plans for those inmates found that all plans\nwere updated after being released from suicide watch. It is also ofnote that during the last few\nmonths one patient A6, was a challenge for all staff Security, mental health, medical staff and the\npatient worked on an individual treatment plan to allow for them to finally get offwatch status. This\nwas a wonderful effort by all to assist apatient to move off suicide status. This area is in substantial\ncompliance, however other areas are not.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with this provision.\n91. Psychiatric Hospitalization/Crisis services - As noted in #64 and #77 above - Temporary\nDetention Orders (TDO) were being utilized to provide a higher level ofpsychiatric care and\nstabilization. During the Agreement period there were only three (3) TDO requests that were rejected.\nThis was an exceptionally good outcome which shows that the QMHP staffwere doing proper\nassessments. Eighty (80) patients were sent to a higher level ofcare over the three-and-a-half-year\nperiod ofmonitoring. This showed that HRRJ mental health staff were assessing and evaluating the need\nfor a TDO appropriately and correctly using that process to the advantage of inmates. This e.lfort helped\nto stabilize the inmates. Previously, the lack ofaccess to ahigher level ofassessment and care led to\ncircumstances and outcomes that were acontributing factor in the DOJ opening its investigation.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n92. Mental Health Achievement Awards (MHAA) -HRRJ behavioral health staff were presenting\nawards. Procedures and criteria were in place. Review of incentives provided through Behavioral\nManagement Plans and review ofmedication compliance by the psych RN was the process for providing\n“Achievements” to mental health clients. During the three years ofthe Agreement, achievement awards\nwere presented to patients with SMI for medication compliance, attending psychiatric appointments\n(especially for those clients who tend to “miss” appointments on a regular basis) and incentives for\nfollowing an individual treatment plan.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n93. Mental Health Release Planning - HRRJ will provide release planning for inmates with a serious\nmental illness.\nHRRJ will need to be substantially compliant with provisions #93 - #97 to obtain substantial\ncompliance with this overall provision.\n31 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 32 of 50 PageID# 1131\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nHRRJmust meet all the below criteria to become compliant with the mental health release planning\ncomponent ofthe Agreement. No grade will be given at this time. Pending Review, PR\n94. Release Plan - Grant funded programs were in place. Community Oriented Re-Entry Program\n(CORE) grant and Forensic Discharge Planning (FDP) Programs through local Community Services\nBoard (CSB) were to address this provision. During this period, grant staff left and the grant process\nhalted. HRRJ worked with CSB forensic discharge planners to assure any inmate who was released “to\nthe street” had a discharge plan.\nFeederjails will need to continuously follow-up with the local CSB to assure that release planning is\noccurring for all inmates. The State ofVirginia provides oversight for the FDP grants provided to each\nCSB.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n95. Warm hand-off- Enriched communication with CSB staff during the closure ofthe facility\nallowed for coordination ofservices and a warm hand offto community mental health providers.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n96. State Prisons Notification -. Ten (10) inmates were transferred to Virginia Department of\nCorrection during the closure. The process for medical and mental health records acceptance is rigorous,\nrequiring the faxing ofrelevant data, including COVID -19 information to the receiving facility at least\n24 hours in advance ofthe transfer. All information was transmitted to each receiving facility and\ninmates were transferred without incident.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n97. Discharge Medications and Renewals - The contractor for healthcare services at HRRJ,\nWellpath, had collaborated with InMed to ensure a total of a fourteen (14) day supply of medications.\nThe process was for any remaining medications which were available on the pill pack to be provided to\nthe inmate upon release. Ifthere was not a 14-day supply available to the inmate, then a prescription\nwas\nfaxed to the nearest pharmacy to the address the inmate will be residing for the balance ofthe 14-day\nrequired supply. Each inmate was provided a card and a form which identified each medication, the drug\nname and strength, indication and days’ supply. On-site record review oftwelve (12) discharged inmates\nfor time served, bond produced or released by the Court showed four (4) of those had an SMI diagnosis\nand five (5) were on psychotropic medications. Each was given the medications on hand and an InMed\norder was generated. There were occasions when HRRJ mental health and medical staff work with the\npharmacy and the patient to assure they received necessary continuity ofmedications.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\n98. Collaboration between Mental Health, Security Staff, and Jail Leadership - A weekly\nInstitutional Classification Committee (ICC) meeting was held to discuss all inmates who may have\nbeen in any type ofRH. The monitor and DOJ were present either in person or on zoom during these\nmeetings. The format included discussion ofinmates with SMI diagnosis who are in a RH unit.\nEmphasis was placed on those in RH greater than twenty-one (21) days duration or approaching thirty\n32 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 33 of 50 PageID# 1132\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\n(30) days. Discussion also included inmates with MH issues that were housed in the RH unit. ICC also\nreviewed those that were on pre-hearing detention to assure rapid review of any disciplinary charges.\nMedical Advisory Committee (MAC) meetings were also used to convey relevant information on SMI\nand special needs inmates. The monitor and DOJ were present either in person or on zoom for these\nmonthly meetings. As noted in previous section in this report, communication is something that had\nimproved over the three years ofthe Agreement. There was a commitment for accomplishing the\nrequirements ofthe Agreement. During the closure process Healthcare and Correctional Staffwere\nstressed and some were not sure where they would land when HRRJ closed. This put stress on the entire\nsystem. However, during the last six (6) months all worked together to assure that patients were\nprovided care. They moved this provision to substantial compliance with their combined efforts.\nHRIU is substantially compliant with this provision.\n99. Mental Health Training for Security Staff - Revised training for new employees, including lesson\nplans using a PowerPoint presentation were implemented. All lesson plans had the required components\nofthe Agreement. Training for new security staff conducted starting in April 2021 and continued using\nthe revised curriculum. An addition to the curriculum was a Two-hour (2) role play scenario. For many\nadult learners, this strategy was extremely helpful to compliment lecture and PowerPoint types of\npresentations. De-escalation training had begun.\nOfficers attended MH Training for Security, Suicide prevention training for both new hires and\nyearly update was occurring and used the required parameters in the Agreement for emergent, urgent,\nand routine referrals to MH staff.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with thisprovision.\nHousing For Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness\nAs described in the Executive Summary, the Jail worked hard during the last few years to house\ninmates with serious mental illness (SMI) in less restrictive settings, including reducing the time inmates\nwith SMI spent in restrictive housing. Figure 2 below shows that during the DOJ investigation in 2017,\n67% ofthe 496 inmates with SMI spent one day or more in restrictive housing, and 36% ofthose 496\ninmates spent 30 days or more consecutively there. In 2023, the Jail had greatly reduced holding inmates\nwith SMI in restrictive housing. Only 30% ofthe 266 inmates with SMI spent one day or more in\nrestrictive housing, and only 6.8% ofthose 266 inmates spent more than a month consecutively there.\nThis especially shows a dramatic reduction of long stays in restrictive housing. This is primarily\nattributed to the Jail’s transformation of its practices and culture by creating spaces that were more\ntherapeutic, more confidential, and less isolating. It is also due to the increase in mental health staffand\nthe availability of some therapy, the increase in the creation of treatment plans and incentives/awards,\nand increased attempts ofthe staffto divert inmates with SMI from restrictive housing.\nFigure 2: Percentage of Inmates with SMI in RH\n33 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 34 of 50 PageID# 1133\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60% ! 67% ;\n50%\n40%\n30%\n36%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n6.8%\n0%\n> 1 day > 30 days > 1 day > 30 days\n2017 2023\nHRRJ will need to be substantially compliant with provisions #100 - #104 to obtain substantial\ncompliance with this overall provision.\n100. Housing for Prisoners with SMI - HRRJ had one (1) year from effective date ofthe Agreement\nto meet these provisions. Patients diagnosed with a SMI needing suicide watch observation and those\nthat may have an acute exacerbation of symptoms are housed in an Acute MH Unit. There was a mental\nhealth unit however programming was light with staffing. HRRJ created “blue” rooms which were used\nfor de-escalation or “time out” locations for mental health patients. They were also used for clinical\nsessions for out-of-cell time. HRRJ also bought chairs suggested by the mental health consultants which\nare less “institutional” and are more comfortable. HRRJ opened the first unit at the end ofApril 2022.\nDue to the closing ofthe facility none ofthe other units opened during the duration ofthe Agreement.\nHRRJ will need to be substantially compliant withprovisions 100 - 104 to obtain substantial\ncompliance with this overallprovision. No grade will be given at this time pending review, PR.\n101. Policies and Procedures for Mental Health Units - HRRJ healthcare staff has produced policies\nwhich were approved. HRRJ security staff have created policies based on the healthcare approved\npolicies. Due to the closing ofthe facility additional procedures needed for opening additional units will\nnot be forthcoming.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision\n34 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 35 of 50 PageID# 1134\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n102. Mental Health Units - There is one unit open - The acute Mental Health Unit for those on\nsuicide watch. HRRJ did what they were able to do in this area prior to closing. None ofthe other units\nwere open prior to the institution closure.\nHRRJispartially-compliant with thisprovision.\n103. Secure Mental Health Units - The healthcare and security policies described inmates who would\nhave been assigned to the unit and the programming which was to be ongoing. This unit did not open\nprior to the closure ofthe facility.\nHRRJis non-compliant with this provision.\n104. Acute Mental Health Unit - HRRJ opened this unit in April 2022.\na. An acute mental health unit for suicide watch observation\nThe unit had ten (10) safety cells with Lexan doors. This unit was used as the suicide watch unit.\nThe unit had security staffwho were assigned to watch duties.\nb. Patients will be offered out-of-cell time with activities determined by a QMHP and detailed in\nthe individualized treatment plan.\nThe Agreement requirement ofa total of four (4) hours of clinically appropriate out-of-cell time\nwas a challenge. Data was kept on out-of-cell activities for each person in the unit. For October\n2023 - March 2024 a snapshot of data for six (6) individuals shows two - four (2-4) were out for\nbreakfast, five (5) were out for lunch and three (3) were out for dinner on a regular basis. Each\nclient may refuse to come out ofthe cell. Use ofthe blue room for the same time period shows\none (1) individual used the blue room two (2) times each week, one individual used it three (3)\ntimes and four (4) used it at least one (1) time. For individual therapy session for the six (6)\npatient records reviewed each inmate came out for an individual therapy session at least one (1)\ntime in the blue room. This data was collected in the Weekly Out ofCell Activity report by\nsecurity. This report tracked the number oftimes an inmate is out-of-cell for Breakfast, Lunch,\nDinner, Blue Room, and Therapy session. The data above was just a snapshot ofthe efforts put\nforth by mental health and security staffto better address the out-of-cell activity by those on\nsuicide watch.\nBehavioral health staff saw inmates on watch every day.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\nRestrictive Housing\nThe use ofrestrictive housing at HRRJ has been reduced in the six years since the 2018 DOJ\nFindings Letter. When DOJ first visited in March 2017 there were approximately 230 inmates being\nheld in restrictive housing cells which represented 21% its approximately 1,100 inmates. Six years later,\nwhen DOJ visited the Jail in March 2023, only 40 ofits 283 prisoners (or 14%) were in restrictive\nhousing. And many ofthose had self-requested to be held there not for protective custody but for other\nvoluntary reasons that were permitted by the Agreement and approved by Jail staff.\n35 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 36 of 50 PageID# 1135\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nNo more deaths in restrictive housing\nIn the Executive Summary, Figure 1 shows ten deaths that occurred prior to the 2018 DOJ Findings\nReport. Three ofthose deaths occurred in a restrictive housing cell and another one occurred soon after\nthe inmate had spent two months in arestrictive housing cell, according to the DOJ’s Findings Report:\n● AA a 24-year-old inmate with serious mental illness who, after losing nearly 40 pounds, died of\nheart failure as a result ofrapid weight loss after being placed in restrictive housing for 100 days.\n● PP committed suicide while in restrictive housing\n● YY committed suicide while in restrictive housing\n● JJ had spent 69 ofhis first 76 days at the Jail in restrictive housing before hanging himself 17\ndays after being released from restrictive housing.\nBut since the 2018 DOJ Findings Letter there have been no deaths related to restrictive housing because\nofthe hard work ofthe Jail staffto reduce the number of inmates in these restrictive cells and to provide\nmore out-of-cell time.\nReduction ofharm has improved.\nNot only have there not been any deaths associated with restrictive housing but also inmates were\nexperiencing other improvements in reduction ofharm with the positive changes. This was not so prior\nto the 2018 DOJ Findings Report. For example:\n● The DOJ told the story ofAF an inmate diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder who told\nDOJ he was known as “hammerhead” at the Jail because he had a large welt on his forehead\nfrom the years ofbanging his head on the walls ofhis restrictive housing cell. Jail records\nshowed DOJ that he had been in the Jail at least five times from 2012 to 2017 and had spent\nnearly 800 of his 1100 days in restrictive housing. He told DOJ in an interview during their\ninvestigation that he does better when not in restrictive housing and when he can talk with\nmental health staffto help him deal with his issues.\n● [Sometime after 2020], this same inmate, AF, was placed on an individualized self-injury\nreduction plan, kept out ofrestrictive housing, and successfully experienced three months\nwithout a self-injury and was able to be released from HRRJ directly from a general\npopulation mental health unit. This is a remarkable success due to the hard work ofthe staff\nand the culture change ofno longer locking down difficult inmates.\nSince DOJ’s involvement and oversight by the monitor monthly, there have been many positive\nexamples of patients improving because ofthe reduction of restrictive housing. One such example was\nA8, an inmate with SMI, who had a history ofdifficult behavior towards security staff Because of\nconstant mental health interventions and not simply placing the patient in restrictive housing, enormous\nprogress was made. So much that a veteran officer sent this monitor an email stating:\n“I was amazed at the person that I had interacted with. A little over two months ago this inmate\nwas a manipulative, assaultive, and problematic individual who had accrued approximately 34\ninstitutional charges during the duration of 8/2022-12/2022. Twelve ofthose charges were\nrelated to assaulting or threatening staff and the remaining ten were being non-complaint with\nthe rules and regulations ofthe facility. When I encountered inmate A8 yesterday, they greeted\n36 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 37 of 50 PageID# 1136\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31,2024\nme, was very pleasant speaking and apologetic to having previously spat in my face. The\ntransition ofthis individual was remarkable. Between the inmate’s willingness to become\ncompliant with intervention, and the collaboration between Security and Mental Health\nDepartment has shown through the current presentation ofthis inmate and steadiness of\nremaining in [general] population.”\nPlacement in RH improved\nThe Jail ended its placement ofinmates in restrictive housing because oftheir disability following\nthe 2018 DOJ Findings Report. According to the DOJ Findings Report, during the first eight months of\n2017, 54 prisoners were held in restrictive housing on the sole basis of“Administrative Restriction -\nMentally Deficient.” This had terrible consequences. For example, four days after arriving at the Jail in\nMarch 2015, a 53-year-old prisoner referred to as EE in the Findings Report was placed in restrictive\nhousing because he was actively psychotic, agitated and throwing feces. Two days later he was seen\nvomiting \"what looked and smelled like feces,\" according to Jail notes. Four days later he had died ofa\nduodenal ulcer, having never received a mental health visit except by the clinician who discovered him\nunresponsive on the day ofhis death. Since monitoring has begun, I can confirm that the Jail has\nstopped placing patients in restrictive housing because oftheir disability.\nStable releasefrom HRRJ improved\nEven more notable is that the Jail had successfully stabilized patients with mental health issues and\nworked to keep them out ofrestrictive housing to help them release from HRRJ from a more therapeutic\nenvironment instead ofa restrictive housing or suicide watch environment. This is a laudable goal for\nmany jails and but not always one they succeed at. For example:\nA9 A patient with schizoaffective disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder had multiple\nserious suicide attempts, they were stabilized on sw and with consistent interventions and being\ntransitioned to MH unit off suicide watch, and had no incidents ofsdv for 45days prior to\nrelease\nAlO This patient was bipolar with repeated attempts of sdv and placement on sw. They had\ndiminished impulse control, poor emotional regulation, frequent preparatory sdv. Through\nongoing work with the QMHP staffand one on one therapy, the patient developed skills for\nemotional regulation, were stabilized on the MH unit prior to release with no sdv for 2wks prior\nto release.\n105. Restrictive Housing on Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness - As noted in #98 above all RH\nplacements were reviewed during the ICC. Those with a SMI diagnosis were reviewed and diverted to\nanother housing unit ifpossible. However, as HRRJ did not have these alternative units operational\nsome inmates stayed in RH longer. With the closure of HRRJ these diversional units were not available.\nHRRJ must meet all the below criteria to become compliant with restrictive housing component of\nthe Agreement. No grade will be given at this time. Pending Review, PR.\n37 of 50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 38 of 50 PageID# 1137\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n106. Restrictive housing is not used as alternative to Mental health care and treatment - HRRJ worked\nhard to assure that RH was not used as an alternative to mental health treatment. HRRJ policies were\napproved and were being implemented to assure RH was not used as an alternative to mental health\ntreatment. As noted in the six monitor reports, all persons in Protective Custody (PC) were no longer\nhoused in the RH unit. The ICC process significantly improved. Security and healthcare staff worked\nwell together to make this a reality. The Monitor, behavioral health or security consultant and DOJ\nrepresentatives attended each ICC meeting in person or via Zoom. As noted above HRRJ made\nsignificant strides in the RH arena.\nHRRJ and healthcare staff are to be commended for their continued commitment and work to make\nthis a reality.\nHRRJispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n107. Screening of all on mental health caseload in 24 hours after placement in restrictive housing -\nAll inmates placed in RH were assessed in the first 24 hours. A MH assessment for Restrictive Housing\nUnit form was implemented to identify any contradictions for RH placement for inmates with a SMI\ndiagnosis. The form continued to be submitted to hearings and grievances for SMI patients. In some\ninstances, this resulted in dismissal ofdisciplinary infractions. Dismissal of infractions was discussed\nduring ICC meetings. On site and zoom attendance by the monitor at the ICC meeting showed excellent\ndiscussion regarding inmates who were in RH and what the best strategy was to use for the inmate and\nthe institution. Tracking was occurring.\nHRRJispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n108. Referral assessment for deteriorating condition - The behavioral health staffconducted weekly\nrounds in RH units. Those with a SMI diagnosis were seen more frequently, at least three (3) times\nweekly according to twenty (20) SMI charts reviewed. All inmates who were identified as\ndecompensating were seen with increasing frequency, referred for a psychiatric evaluation and/or follow\nup. Ifnecessary, a TDO was initiated. QMHP staff were vigilant in following up with all inmates\nidentified with a SMI diagnosis.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n109.

RH unit inmates were given showers three days\nper week. Clinical and professional visits were allowed for those in RH units. Access to reading and\nwriting materials was not always provided. For those who may have a potential for self-directed\nviolence behavior a QMHP evaluated the need for and use ofreading and writing materials, ifclinically\n38 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 39 of 50 PageID# 1138\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\nindicated.Accessto radiosand or TV waslimited.Meetings were held between security and mental\nhealth staffto assure everyone was on the same page, and documentation ofwhat items were to be\nallowed in the RH areas was discussed based on the clinical profile and current condition ofthe inmate.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n111. No inmate with a SMI will be placed in restrictive housing on administrative restriction status\nabsent Extraordinary Circumstances which are approved with documented reasons by the\nSuperintendent and Director ofMental Health. Memos outlining date ofplacement in RHU, behavior\nwhile in RHU resulting in additional disciplinary infractions and recommendation to stay or remove\nfrom RHU were used. These memos were generated by the Mental Health Director or designee for\ninitial placement. These patients were also discussed weekly at ICC meetings to brainstorm alternative\nplacement options, creative problem solving, to identify antecedents to maladaptive behaviors and a\nclear pathway to transition out ofRHU. Due to the lack of alternative housing opportunities, there was\nnot always a“clear pathway” to transition out ofthe RH unit. As noted previously, alternative placement\nfor many inmates was not possible as the units were not available. Documentation ofthese memos was\nsent to the monitor and USDOJ monthly.\nHRRJispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n112. Weekly approval by Superintendent and MH Director ifSMI placed on administrative restriction\nin restrictive housing - A written process and forms required to be signed by the Superintendent and\nMental Health Director were revised and were being used.

This provision was not able to be\ninitiated prior to the closing ofthe facility.\nHRRJ is non-compliant with this provision\n114. Ifinmate not removed from restrictive housing must be documented including reason - Wellpath,\nthe healthcare services contractor developed apolicy to address this provision. A form was created\noutlining recommendation to divert an inmate diagnosed with a SMI from RH. The form was being used\nand helped to divert SMI inmates from RH. Also, during the ICC meeting any staffwho felt a SMI\ninmate should not be removed from RH must give a reason, and a suggestion as to strategies to help the\ninmate to move from RH unit. Full implementation was not possible prior to the closure ofthe facility.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n39 of50\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 71   Filed 06/04/24   Page 40 of 50 PageID# 1139\nHRRJ FINAL REPORT MAY 31, 2024\n115. Ifinmate is not removed from RH, then HRRJ must have a heightened level of care for those in\nRH- All patients with a SMI diagnosis had an increased level ofcare which included once daily visit\nfrom an RN ifon medications, face-to-face, therapeutic, out-of-cell session with a QMHP once a week,\nrounds three (3) times a week by QMHP, one ofwhich is conduced out ofcell (if security staff was\navailable). There was no specific diversion unit. QMHP staff conducted additional rounds in RH unit, if\nclinically indicated. Mental health rounds were not being used as treatment. Superintendent made it clear\nto staff that all due diligence was to be used to try and allow for out-of-cell sessions. However, this was\nnot possible all ofthe time.\nHRRJ ispartially with this provision.\n116. SMI inmates in restrictive housing for more than 30 days will be reviewed weekly and approved\nby Superintendent and MH Director - In 2021, Mental Health Department created memos outlining date\nofplacement in RHU, behavior while in RHU resulting in additional disciplinary infractions and\nrecommendation to stay or remove from RHU. These memos were generated by Mental Health Director\nor designee for initial thirty (30) day review and subsequently every week they remained in a RHU.\nThese patients were also discussed weekly ICC meetings to brainstorm alternative placement options,\ncreative problem solving, to identify antecedents to maladaptive behaviors and a clear pathway to\ntransition out ofRHU. These memos were kept by MH Director and security placed copy ofthe memo\nin inmates’ classification file. The challenge was the need for alternative placement for those with a\nSMI.\nHRRJ ispartially compliant with thisprovision.\n117. Restrictive Housing Placement Based on Disability - HRRJ must assure that inmates with\nmental health disabilities are not placed unnecessarily in RH based on their disability.\nReview ofall relevant documents showed that there were no persons placed on RH based on disability.\nReview ofall documents and tracking continued to confirm this status.\nHRRJ is substantially compliant with this provision.\n118.

Quality Improvement Committee (QIC) developed and implemented in three (3) months - The\nfirst meeting ofthe Quality Improvement Committee was held on May 7, 2021, and had been held\nmonthly since. The monitor attended the meetings when on site or on zoom. The United States also\nattended via zoom. Minutes ofthe meeting were reviewed and contained recommendations for changes\non how data is collected and reported. Changes to descriptors related to the data helped with\ninterpretation. An example was those that were in quarantine were not considered in restricted housing,\nhowever had been counted as such in the data, this was corrected. This was the type ofrecommendation\nthat helped HRRJ provide accurate data to the Monitor and the United States. Wellpath, the healthcare\ncontractor had QIC goals and processes. Also, there were specific questions that were sent to staffat\nHRRJ requesting clarification on data reported each month. These questions helped create ownership for\ndata collected. A new Agreement Coordinator was appointed during the previous reporting period. They\ncontinued to provide information and required reports.

CONCLUSION..................................................................................................................... 43 \n\n \n \nI.   SUMMARY \n \n \n \nAfter an extensive investigation, the United States Department of Justice provides notice, \npursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997b, and \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, that there is reasonable cause to \nbelieve, based on the totality of the conditions, practices, and incidents discovered there, that:  \n(1) the conditions at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail violate the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the Constitution; (2) these violations are pursuant to a pattern or practice of \nresistance to the full enjoyment of rights protected by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; \nand (3) the conditions at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail violate the ADA.  The Department \ndoes not serve as a tribunal authorized to make factual findings and legal conclusions binding on, \nor admissible in, any court, and nothing in this Notice should be construed as such.  Accordingly, \nthis Notice is not intended to be admissible evidence and does not create any legal rights or \nobligations. \n \nSpecifically, the United States provides notice of the following identified conditions: \n \n•  The Jail fails to provide constitutionally adequate medical care to prisoners.  Many \nprisoners at the Jail have serious medical needs requiring treatment, and these prisoners \nare placed at a substantial risk of serious harm when they do not receive adequate \ntreatment.  The Jail fails to provide adequate intake, discharge planning, sick call, chronic \ncare, and emergency care such that prisoners are subjected to an unacceptable risk of \nharm due to delays or lack of treatment. \n•  The Jail fails to provide constitutionally adequate mental health care to prisoners.  \nThe Jail’s mental health program lacks many of the hallmarks of a constitutionally \nadequate system.  Specifically, the Jail’s current program fails to:  properly screen \nprisoners for mental illness; provide adequate treatment planning; adequately administer \nmedications and psychotherapy; and properly treat and supervise suicidal prisoners. \n•  The Jail’s use of prolonged restrictive housing under current conditions, including \nthe failure to provide adequate medical and mental health care, violates the \nconstitutional rights of prisoners with serious mental illness.  The Jail subjects \nprisoners with serious mental illness to prolonged periods of restrictive housing under \nconditions that place them at a substantial risk of serious harm.  During the first six \nmonths of 2017, an average of 70 prisoners with serious mental illness were held in \nrestrictive housing on any given day.  Of the almost 500 prisoners the Jail identified as \nhaving serious mental illness between July 2016 and July 2017, more than 175 of them \nspent at least 30 consecutive days in restrictive housing.  More than 60 prisoners with \nserious mental illness spent three consecutive months or more in restrictive housing.  The \nmajority of “suicide threat” and “self-inflicted injury” incidents occur in the Jail’s \nrestrictive housing cells.  Though only 15% of the Jail’s population is housed in \nrestrictive housing, between 2014 and August 2017, 60% of both the approximately 400 \nsuicide threat incidents and the nearly 300 self-inflicted injury incidents occurred in a \nrestrictive housing cell.  Also, of the 300 transfers from the Jail to a state-run psychiatric \n\nhospital between 2016 and August 2017, 60% had been housed in restrictive housing \nimmediately prior to being transferred to the state hospital.  Eighty-seven of those \ntransfers occurred after a prisoner had spent 30 consecutive days or more in restrictive \nhousing. \n•  The Jail’s restrictive housing practices discriminate against prisoners with mental \nhealth disabilities in violation of the ADA.  The Jail places prisoners with mental health \ndisabilities in restrictive housing on administrative status specifically because they are \n“mentally deficient,” with no disciplinary or other reason given.  By placing these \nprisoners in restrictive housing because of their disability and denying them the benefits \nof the Jail’s services, programs, and activities when they would otherwise be qualified to \naccess these benefits in non-restrictive housing, the Jail violates the ADA. \n \n \nII.   INVESTIGATION \n \n \n On December 12, 2016, the Department of Justice notified the Hampton Roads Regional \nJail of our intent to conduct an investigation of the Jail pursuant to CRIPA and the ADA.  Our \ninvestigation focused on whether there is reasonable cause to believe the Jail (1) violates \nprisoners’ rights to adequate medical and mental health care, (2) violates the constitutional rights \nof prisoners who have mental illness by secluding them in restrictive housing for prolonged time \nperiods under current conditions, and (3) violates the ADA rights of prisoners who have mental \nhealth disabilities by denying them access to services, programs, and activities because of their \ndisabilities. \nThe investigation was conducted jointly by the Special Litigation Section of the \nDepartment of Justice Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia.  Four nationally recognized expert consultants in correctional security and \nmedical and mental health care assisted with our investigation.  Our experts included a former \nhigh-ranking corrections official with significant experience leading local corrections \ndepartments and a medical doctor with experience running the medical department in one of the \ncountry’s largest jails.  These experts accompanied us on site visits to the Jail, community \nservices boards (CSBs), local mental health courts, and crisis drop-off centers.  Our experts \ninterviewed Jail staff and prisoners, reviewed documents, and provided their expert opinions and \ninsight to help inform our investigation and its conclusions. \nBetween December 2016 and October 2017, representatives from the Department of \nJustice and our experts conducted four site visits to the Jail.  Over the course of our visits, we \ninterviewed administrative staff, security staff, medical and mental health staff, and prisoners.  \nWe also met with members of the community-based Forensic Advisory Team overseeing the \nJail’s mental health pilot program, which seeks to improve discharge planning and community \ncoordination.  In addition to conducting tours and interviews, we reviewed an extensive number \nof documents, including policies and procedures for the Jail and the Jail’s medical provider, \nmedical and mental health records, cell assignment histories, incident reports, investigative \nreports, disciplinary reports, administrative audit reports, prisoner grievances, unit logs, \n2 \n \n\norientation materials, and training materials.1  We analyzed data from the Jail’s security system, \nincluding, for example, data relating to length of stay in restrictive housing, Jail admission dates, \nand transfers to the state psychiatric hospital.  We observed prisoners in various settings \nthroughout the facility, including in general population and restrictive housing units.  We \nconducted exit conferences with Jail officials upon the conclusion of our visits in order to \nprovide technical assistance during the course of the investigation. \n \nIII.   BACKGROUND \n \n \nThe Hampton Roads Regional Jail opened in 1998, and is located in Portsmouth, \nVirginia.  It serves five local jurisdictions:  Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk, Portsmouth, and \nChesapeake, and is operated under the authority of a 15-member board made up of the sheriffs, \ncity managers, and one council member from each of the five jurisdictions.  The facility is \nmanaged by a superintendent and an assistant superintendent.  The Jail is funded through \ncontributions from each of the five jurisdictions as well as contributions from the Virginia \nDepartment of Corrections for each state-sponsored prisoner held at the facility and from the \nVirginia Compensation Board to cover part of the salaries of security staff.  For fiscal year 2017, \nthe Jail’s operating budget was $39 million, of which $9 million was spent on medical and \nmental health services. \n \nEach of the five jurisdictions operates its own local jail and selects which prisoners are \nsent to the Regional Jail.  The Jail was originally built to address local jail overcrowding in the \nfive jurisdictions it serves.  Over time, however, the local jurisdictions have tended to transfer to \nthe Jail prisoners with significant mental health or medical needs, prisoners unable to follow \ndirections in a correctional setting, and prisoners accused of committing high-profile crimes.  \nSome jurisdictions even send all of their female prisoners to the Jail.  The result of such a system \nis that the Jail has an especially concentrated high-needs population.  During our investigation, \nthe makeup of the Jail’s population has remained relatively constant.  At any given time, the Jail \nhouses approximately 1,100 prisoners, of which approximately 600 are pretrial detainees and \napproximately 500 are already sentenced.  Of the overall Jail population, about 750 are on the \nmedical chronic care list at any given time, including an average of 66 prisoners with HIV, 134 \nwith an infectious disease, and 24 who are pregnant. \n \nThe Jail also houses a high proportion of individuals with serious mental illness, many of \nwhom are repeatedly admitted for minor offenses, at significant expense.  Approximately half of \nthe Jail’s population is taking some type of psychotropic medication and a quarter have been \ndiagnosed with a serious mental illness.  In response to a statewide survey required by the \nVirginia General Assembly, the Jail reported that 47% of the 279 prisoners with serious mental \nillness who were housed at the Jail during the month of June 2017 had non-violent or \n                                                 \n1 In this investigation, we include examples of incidents and the experiences of particular individuals to illustrate the \npatterns.  When prisoners described problems concerning their medical or mental health care or placement in \nrestrictive housing, we verified those issues with documents and data provided by the Jail.  For each example, we \nbased our conclusion on the Jail’s own documents and data. \n \n3 \n \n\nmisdemeanor drug charges as their most serious offense.  Of the 496 prisoners the Jail identified \nas having serious mental illness between July 2016 and July 2017, we identified 62 whose entire \nbooking history at the Jail included only minor offenses such as shoplifting, trespassing, or \nprobation violations.  In total, as of August 31, 2017, these 62 individuals had spent 17,373 days \nat the Jail.  During Virginia’s fiscal year 2017 alone, these prisoners spent 8,030 days in the Jail, \nwhich cost the local communities at least $505,890.2  In addition, if prisoners decompensate in \nthe Jail, the Jail transfers them to a state psychiatric hospital that costs the Commonwealth an \naverage of $298 per patient, per day.  In 2016, there were 169 such transfers to a state psychiatric \nhospital, and during the first eight months of 2017, there were 132. \n \nThe Jail houses prisoners with serious medical and mental health needs throughout its \nthree housing units, which are each divided into pods.  The male prisoners with the most acute \nmedical needs are held in one pod with 56 beds, and the male prisoners with the most acute \nmental health needs are held in another pod with 69 beds.  There is a nurse or nursing assistant \non duty at all times outside of these two pods.  The other two pods in this housing unit are \nrestrictive housing units and have 96 beds.  Other male prisoners with serious mental health \nneeds are held in a mental health “step-down” pod in a different housing unit.  There are no \nspecial pods set aside for female prisoners with special medical or mental health needs. \n \nSince December 2015, medical and mental health services at the Jail have been provided \nby a private medical care provider, Correct Care Solutions (CCS).  Four of the five feeder jails \nalso contract with CCS and use the same electronic medical system. \n \nAt the time of our March 2017 visit, approximately 230 prisoners were in restrictive \nhousing.  For purposes of this Notice, the term “restrictive housing” means the state of being \nconfined to one’s cell for the vast majority of the day, typically 22 hours or more, alone or with \nother prisoners.3  At the Jail, prisoners held in restrictive housing are allowed one hour of \nrecreation out of their cells Monday through Friday and are allowed to shower three times per \n                                                 \n2 This figure is the based on a $63 average cost per day to the communities, but the actual cost is likely higher \nbecause of the costs associated with treating these prisoners’ serious mental health needs.  This cost does not include \nfunding received from other sources, such as the Virginia Compensation Board, which pays for a portion of the \ncorrectional officers’ salaries.  Notably, $63 is more expensive than the most intensive evidence-based community \nmental health services, which do not include housing costs and are estimated to cost $45.21 per day. \n \n3 Restrictive housing, elsewhere sometimes referred to as solitary confinement, segregation, or isolation, is any type \nof detention that involves three basic elements:  removal from the general prisoner population, whether voluntary or \ninvoluntary; placement in a locked room or cell, whether alone or with another prisoner; and inability to leave the \nroom or cell for the vast majority of the day, typically 22 hours or more.  Porter v. Clarke, 290 F. Supp. 2d 518, 528 \n(E.D. Va. 2018) (citing U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Report and Recommendations Concerning the Use of Restrictive \nHousing 3 (Jan. 2016) [hereinafter Restrictive Housing Report]).  The Jail itself uses the term restrictive housing for \nthis type of detention.  Courts have referred to various durations when describing this type of detention.  See, e.g., \nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 214, 223-24 (2005) (describing restrictive housing as limiting human contact for \n23 hours per day); Sweet v. S.C. Dep’t of Corr., 529 F.2d 854, 867 (4th Cir. 1975) (Butzner, J., concurring) \n(describing restrictive housing as being alone in a cell for 24 hours per day, save for two, one-hour periods a week \nfor exercise and a shower); Tillery v. Owens, 907 F.2d 418, 422 (3d Cir. 1990) (21 to 22 hours per day). \n \n4 \n \n\nweek.  Prisoners in restrictive housing are locked down for the entire 24 hours on Saturday and \nSunday. \n  We were prompted to conduct an investigation of the Jail’s treatment of prisoners in the \nwake of tragic deaths that captured local and national attention, including those of AA4 in August \n2015 and BB in August 2016, and pursuant to a complaint received by the Department.  The first \ndeath, which received the most attention, was that of 24-year-old AA.  AA was arrested on April \n22, 2015, after stealing $5-worth of snacks from a convenience store.  He was charged with \ntrespass and petty larceny for pickpocketing less than $5.  His bail was set for $3,000, and he \nwas incarcerated pending trial. AA was transferred to the Hampton Roads Regional Jail on May \n11, 2015, his fourth trip to the Jail since 2010.  AA had a history of bipolar disorder and \nschizophrenia and was determined by a forensic psychologist to be “manic and psychotic.”  At \nthe end of May 2015, a court ordered him  to be sent from the Jail to Eastern State Hospital for \ncompetency restoration.  This order was never received by Eastern State Hospital, and AA \nremained at the Jail.  Consequently, at a hearing at the end of July 2015, the court issued another \ntransfer order.  This order was received by Eastern State Hospital, but was not entered onto the \nhospital’s transfer log.  As a result, AA was not transferred to the hospital.  AA died on August \n19, 2015, awaiting transfer to Eastern State Hospital, three months after the court’s initial order.  \nHis cause of death was heart failure as a result of rapid weight loss.  After his death, the court’s \nJuly 2015 transfer order was found in the file drawer of a hospital clerk, along with several other \ncourt orders of detainees at local jails who, like AA, were awaiting transfer to the hospital for \ncompetency restoration.  \n  AA was at the Jail for 100 days between May 11 and his death on August 19, all of which \nhe spent in restrictive housing.  He was initially placed in restrictive housing upon admission for \nhis refusal to submit to a test for tuberculosis.  He remained in restrictive housing on \n“administrative restriction – unable to adapt,” a status used by the Jail at times for prisoners with \nmental illness who have difficulty following rules.  He was in restrictive housing at the time of \nhis death.  During the time he was in restrictive housing, correctional officers noted that he \ndisplayed erratic behavior, such as screaming and talking to himself inside his cell, snorting his \nmedication through his nose, clogging his toilet, and smearing fecal matter on himself and the \nwalls of his cell.  He repeatedly refused medical tests, medications, and visits from medical and \nmental health staff.  Over the course of the 100 days that AA was in restrictive housing, he lost \nnearly 40 pounds.  He was sent to the emergency room on July 30, due to “decompensation” and \n“bilateral extremity edema” and was discharged that same day.  When he returned to the Jail, he \nwas not seen by a doctor. He was found unresponsive in his cell 19 days later. \nIn the wake of AA’s death, the Jail and several state and local entities conducted separate \ninvestigations into what happened.  First, the Jail conducted its own internal investigation and, in \na report released eight days after AA’s death, concluded that AA died of natural causes and that \nthere was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by jail employees.  Investigators from two state \nagencies, the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and the \nOffice of the State Inspector General, concluded that mistakes and flaws in the competency \nrestoration system  led to AA’s death.  Both investigations focused on errors made by actors in \nthe system other than the Jail, including the Portsmouth Community Services Board, the \n                                                 \n4 To protect the identity of prisoners, we use coded  initials. \n5 \n \n\nPortsmouth Department of Behavioral Healthcare Services, and Eastern State Hospital.  The \nVirginia State Police has investigated AA’s death, and AA’s family has a federal wrongful death \nlawsuit pending. \nIn August 2016, one year after AA died, another prisoner, 60-year-old BB, died in his \ncell in the Jail, two days after submitting a request for emergency medical help due to his \ndifficulties holding down food or water.  BB was admitted to the Jail on June 7, 2016, for a \nprobation violation relating to a prior conviction for shoplifting.  This was his third time in the \nJail.  He had previously spent 404 days there in 2012 on assault and shoplifting charges, and 26 \ndays in 2014 for a probation violation.  When he was admitted to the Jail in June 2016, he had a \nmass on his neck. \nBeginning on July 10 and continuing over the course of the next month, BB complained \nof heartburn and wrote several medical grievances.  In one complaint, he wrote that the \nmedication he was receiving was not relieving his abdominal pain and requested to see a doctor.  \nHe received a written response, nine days later, stating that he would be seen by a provider.  He \nwas not.  On July 30, he wrote that he had not been able to keep down food for two weeks and \nhad lost 14 pounds since the last time he was weighed.  On August 1, he wrote that he needed to \nsee a medical provider “ASAP” because he was having a lot of problems with his bladder \nmovement and bowels and, the next day, complained that he had not used the bathroom in two \nweeks and had not been eating for days.  He asked for help “before its [sic] too late.”  The head \nnurse responded in writing to this complaint by stating that BB had been seen at the hospital and \nhad two scans done on his neck; however, she ignored his complaints about his stomach.  On \nAugust 4, he wrote that he had blacked out two times in less than 24 hours and could not eat or \nhold down water.  However, medical personnel did not respond, instead noting that he had been \nseen walking around on the top tier of the housing unit and then lying on the walkway.  The \nnurse stated that “no seizure activity was present,” nor any “signs or symptoms of concern.” \nBB died of a perforated ulcer several days later.  The autopsy revealed that he had a pint \nof blood in his stomach at the time of his death.  He had lost 35 pounds from the time he was \nadmitted to the Jail in June to the time he died in early August, weighing 132 pounds at the time \nof his death.  In June 2017, BB’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Jail and its \nmedical provider, CCS, alleging that the defendants were negligent in their care and violated his \nconstitutional right to medical care.  The Jail filed a cross-claim against CCS, alleging, in part, \nthat CCS breached its contract with the Jail by failing to provide clinically necessary medical \nservices to BB.  On July 24, 2018, the court approved a settlement the parties reached in which \nCCS agreed to pay $525,000 and the Jail agreed to pay $100,000.  As part of this agreement, \nneither CCS nor the Jail admitted any liability or wrongdoing. \nSince AA and BB died, the Jail has taken steps to prevent similar deaths.  The Jail \nbrought in new personnel in leadership positions, including:  a new superintendent, who has \nsince been succeeded by the current superintendent; an assistant superintendent, who served in \nthis position from October 2016 until May 2018; a chief information officer; and a human \nresources manager.  It has reformed its internal investigations process to review staff \nmisconduct, prisoner assaults, and prisoner deaths.  To address the shortage in security staffing, \nthe Virginia Compensation Board has conducted a staffing study.  Jail administrators have \nworked with the Virginia Department of Corrections (DOC) to develop a high-priority transfer \n6 \n\nlist of prisoners whose needs could be better served at one of DOC’s longer-term care facilities \nthan at a local jail.  One member of the Jail’s Board Authority, who is also the Sheriff of a feeder \njail recently stated publicly:  “If we can get more diversion practices and resources in place, I \nbelieve that we can divert many of the folks that end up in the facility for simple things like \ntrespassing, larceny, things that probably are a result of their mental illness that got them \nincarcerated.”  To that end, the Jail has also been administering a $900,000 grant awarded by the \nCommonwealth to increase discharge planning for those in the Jail with serious mental illness, \nand has had some success in reducing the number of grant participants who have been rearrested \nafter discharge.  These positive developments represent necessary steps to address some of the \nproblems identified in this Notice, but are insufficient to remedy ongoing violations.  Thus, \nadditional work remains. \nIV. CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED\nThe Department’s investigation has uncovered facts that provide reasonable cause to \nconclude that conditions at the Jail violate the Constitution and federal law.  In particular, the \nDepartment has reasonable cause to believe that the Jail fails to provide constitutionally adequate \nmedical care and mental health care, and places prisoners with serious mental illness in \nrestrictive housing for prolonged periods of time under conditions that violate prisoners’ \nconstitutional rights.  The Department also has reasonable cause to conclude that these violations \nare pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Further, the \nDepartment has reasonable cause to believe that the Jail violates the ADA by denying prisoners \nwith mental health disabilities access to services, programs, and activities because of their \ndisabilities. \nAs detailed below, the combination of numerous, specific and repeated violations of the \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments at the Jail, taken together with multiple deficient policies \nand processes that caused or contributed to those violations, is sufficient to establish a pattern or \npractice of constitutional violations under CRIPA.  To establish a pattern or practice of \nviolations, the United States must prove “more than the mere occurrence of isolated or \n‘accidental’ or sporadic discriminatory acts.”  See Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. 324, 336 \n(1977).  It must “establish by a preponderance of the evidence that [] [violating federal law] was \n. . . the regular rather than the unusual practice.”  Id.

Bank, 652 F.2d 1176, 1188 (4th Cir. 1981) (citing Teamsters when \nexplaining that a “cumulation of evidence, including statistics, patterns, practices, general \npolicies, or specific instances of discrimination” can be used to prove a pattern or practice).  \nThere is no defined quantum of facts needed to allege a pattern or practice of discrimination; “no \nmathematical formula is workable; nor was any intended.

Medical Care at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail is Inadequate in Violation of\nPrisoners’ Constitutional Rights\nThe Department has reasonable cause to believe that, in the totality of the circumstances \ndescribed below, the Hampton Roads Regional Jail has engaged in a pattern or practice of failing \nto provide prisoners with adequate medical care in violation of their constitutional rights.  The \nJail holds both sentenced prisoners and pretrial detainees, and fails to provide both groups with \nconstitutionally adequate medical care. \nThe Eighth Amendment protects sentenced prisoners from cruel and unusual punishment.  \nU.S. CONST. amend. VIII.  Jail conditions violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against \ncruel and unusual punishment where they result from prison officials’ deliberate indifference to \nthe substantial risk of serious harm to prisoners.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828 (1994).  \nThe Eighth Amendment requires that the government provide adequate care to meet prisoners’ \nserious medical needs.  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103-05; Gordon v. Kidd, 971 F.2d 1087, 1094 (4th \nCir. 1992) (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103-05). \nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits a failure of prison authorities to treat a prisoner’s \nmedical needs where such failure amounts to “physical ‘torture or a lingering death.’”  Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 447 (1890)).  “[D]enial \nof medical care is cruel and unusual because, in the worst case, it can result in physical torture, \nand, even in less serious cases, it can result in pain without any penological purpose.”  Rhodes v. \nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981) (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 103).  “Prisoners are dependent \non the State for food, clothing, and necessary medical care. . . . Just as a prisoner may starve if \nnot fed, he or she may suffer or die if not provided adequate medical care.  A prison that deprives \nprisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept \nof human dignity and has no place in civilized society.”  Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 510-11 \n(2011).  The state’s obligation remains even if it has contracted with a private party to provide \nmedical care.  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 56 (1988). \nUnder the Constitution, prisoners are protected from the risk of future harm, even if no \nprisoner has suffered actual harm at the time the violation is found.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at \n845-47; Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993) (“a remedy for unsafe conditions need not\nawait a tragic event” and “the Eighth Amendment protects against future harms to inmates,”\neven when the harm “might not affect all of those exposed” to the risk and even when the harm\nwould not manifest itself immediately).  A facility fails to provide constitutionally adequate\nmedical care if:  (1) the deprivation alleged is sufficiently serious, and (2) the prisoner\ndemonstrates that the prison official had a sufficiently culpable state of mind such that he was\ndeliberately indifferent to prisoner health or safety.  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991).\nThe rights of pretrial detainees are guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, which, the \nSupreme Court has consistently held, provides protection at least equal to the Eighth \nAmendment.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545 (1979) (“pretrial detainees, who have not been \nconvicted of any crimes, retain at least those constitutional rights . . . enjoyed by convicted \nprisoners”).  In analyzing pretrial detainees’ Fourteenth Amendment claims, courts have \ntherefore looked to the Eighth Amendment to provide the relevant legal standard.  See, e.g., \nWestmoreland v. Brown, 883 F. Supp. 67, 76 (E.D. Va. 1995); Castro v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, \n8 \n\n833 F.3d 1060, 1068-69 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (explaining that it read Farmer and Bell as \ncreating a single “deliberate indifference” test for plaintiffs who bring a constitutional claim \nunder either the Fourteenth or Eighth Amendments).5 \n1. Prisoners at the Jail have Serious Medical Needs Requiring Treatment\nMany prisoners at the Jail have serious medical needs that require treatment and place \nthem at serious risk of harm if not adequately addressed.  A medical condition is serious if it “has \nbeen diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment” or is “so obvious that even a lay person \nwould easily recognize the necessity for a doctor’s attention.”  Iko v. Shreve, 535 F.3d 225, 241 \n(4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Henderson v. Sheahan, 196 F.3d 839, 846 (7th Cir. 1999)).  Typically, \nthe prisoners sent by the five city jails to the Hampton Roads Regional Jail are those with the \nmost serious medical and mental health needs, who are the most difficult to manage, and who \nrequire the highest level of services.  Of the 1,100 prisoners, about 750 are on the chronic care \nlist at any given time.  The Jail has 60 beds in its medical housing unit, all of which are typically \nfull. \n2. Prisoners are Subjected to a Substantial Risk of Serious Harm as a Result of\nInadequate Medical Care\nPrisoners at the Jail suffer a deficient intake process and often lack access to appropriate \nmedical and mental health care.  See Shabazz v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., No. 3:10-cv-190, \n2011 WL 3489661, at *6 (E.D. Va. Aug. 9, 2011) (“In addition to alleging that the medical need \nwas objectively serious, Plaintiff must plausibly allege facts indicating that the delay in the \nprovision of medical care resulted in substantial harm.”) (internal citations omitted).  Prisoners at \nthe Jail have been exposed to the substantial risk of harm through the Jail’s deficient intake \nprocess and lack of continuity of care, lack of access to care, and deficient quality of care.  We \nhave reasonable cause to believe that the totality of these deficiencies, as described below, result \nin medical care that is inadequate and in violation of the prisoners’ constitutional rights. \na. Deficient Intake Process and Continuity of Care\nAdequate medical records are necessary in order for a jail to provide constitutionally \nadequate care.  See, e.g., Newman v. State of Ala., 503 F.2d 1320, 1323 n.4 (5th Cir. 1974) \n(affirming district court’s conclusion that the medical care in the Alabama Penal System violated \nthe Eighth Amendment due in part to “paltry records” accompanying prisoners being \ntransferred); Ginest v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of Carbon Cnty., 333 F. Supp. 2d 1190,  1205-07 \n(concluding that the jail’s medical record keeping system violates Eighth Amendment standards \nbecause records were missing, including those from prisoners’ outside hospitalizations); \nColeman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1314 (E.D. Cal. 1995) (“A necessary component of \n5 In Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 135 S. Ct. 2466 (2015), the Supreme Court held that the correct standard to be applied \nto an excessive use of force claim brought by a pretrial detainee under the Fourteenth Amendment was not whether \nthe officers were subjectively aware that their use of force was unreasonable, but whether the officers’ use of that \nforce was objectively unreasonable.  135 S. Ct. at 2470.  The Fourth Circuit has yet to reexamine its standard for \nanalyzing Fourteenth Amendment conditions of confinement claims by pretrial detainees in light of Kingsley.  For \nthis reason, we apply the Eighth Amendment standard to pretrial detainees and sentenced prisoners alike. \n9 \n\nminimally adequate medical care is maintenance of complete and accurate medical records,” \nwhich includes records from county jails from which prisoners are transferred); Inmates of \nOccoquan v. Barry, 717 F. Supp. 854, 867 (D.D.C. 1989) (concluding that there were “systemic \nfailures throughout the entire medical services” because prison failed, among other things, to \nensure that medical records followed prisoners upon transfer).  The Jail’s medical records are \ninadequate and inaccurate because the Jail fails to receive and review medical records from \ntransferring jails at intake and fails to conduct all intake screens within 14 days of admission. \nThe Jail receives all of its prisoners as transfers from five local city jails, Monday through \nFriday.  On the day before the prisoner is transferred, the Jail receives a phone call from the \ntransferring jail explaining the reason why the prisoner is being moved.  The Jail, however, does \nnot receive the transferring jail’s medical records about the prisoner until after the prisoner has \nbeen screened by the Jail.  Therefore, when prisoners are admitted to the Jail and a nurse \nconducts the initial medical screen, the nurse does not have the transferring jail’s prior medical \nrecords about the prisoner to review.  This can result in the Jail screening nurse recording \ndifferent answers about the prisoner’s condition and medical history than those recorded by the \ncity jail from which the prisoner transferred.  This happens despite the fact that most of the city \njails use the same medical contractor, with the same electronic medical system. \n   Prompt medical screening upon intake is another necessary element of a constitutionally \nadequate system.  See Dawson v. Kendrick, 527 F. Supp. 1252, 1307 (S.D. W.Va. 1981) (“It is \ngenerally recognized that prompt medical screening is a medical necessity in pre-trial detention \nfacilities.”).  After the initial medical screen, prisoners are supposed to be seen by a nurse within \n14 days of admission.  In practice, prisoners are rarely seen within 14 days and often \nsignificantly longer.  This presents problems because prisoners are sent to the Jail precisely \nbecause of the complexity of their medical problems.  Where a prisoner’s condition is \nsufficiently serious or urgent, delays in diagnosis and treatment, even by a few days or a few \nhours, can result in “substantial harm” to the patient that rises to the level of an Eighth \nAmendment violation.  See Turner v. Ruffin, No. 1:16-cv-510, 2017 WL 2405371, at *4 (E.D. \nVa. June 2, 2017) (“A delay in medical treatment may constitute deliberate indifference” if it \nresults in “substantial harm [such as] lifelong handicap, permanent loss or considerable pain.”); \nSealock v. Colorado, 218 F.3d 1205, 1210-11 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding that a several-hour delay \nin transporting prisoner experiencing heart attack to a hospital could constitute an Eighth \nAmendment violation). \nb.  Lack of Access to Care \nOne of the primary deficiencies in the Jail’s medical care system is that it does not take \nprisoner requests for treatment seriously, and often ignores them.  The Jail’s failure to take \nprisoner requests for medical treatment seriously can result in significant delays, causing harm to \nprisoners with serious medical issues and violating their constitutional rights.  See Webb v. \nHamidullah, 281 F. App’x 159, 166 (4th Cir. 2008).  The Jail does not have an adequate system \nfor prisoners to make their medical problems known to staff to facilitate “ready access to medical \ncare.”  See Casey v. Lewis, 834 F. Supp. 1477, 1545 (D. Ariz. 1993) (failure to provide prisoners \nwith “ready access to medical care” amounts to deliberate indifference if prisoners are unable to \nmake their medical problems known to staff).  Prisoners have two avenues to request treatment – \nthe sick call process, which is used for first-time requests for treatment, and the grievance \nprocess, which is used for complaints about prior treatment or if prior requests for treatment have \n10 \n \n\ngone unanswered.  With regard to the sick call process, we found that sick call slips are not \nroutinely collected and triaged in a timely manner.  When we visited the Jail in May 2017, the \nnursing director was admonishing the nursing staff for leaving sick call slips uncollected in a box \nfor one month without any answer. \nEven if sick call slips are timely collected and triaged, prisoners often have to wait a long \ntime to see a medical provider.  A quality improvement study conducted by the Jail’s medical \ncontractor in January 2017 revealed that only 25% of sick call patients who were triaged by a \nsick call nurse and referred to a health care provider were seen by a health care provider within \nseven days of the referral.  Delays in access to care can have significant health consequences for \nprisoners and result in deterioration that requires emergent medical care.  The Jail’s failure to \nadequately and timely address concerns raised in sick call forms resulted in worsening conditions \nand harm in the following illustrative cases: \n•  CC is a 61-year-old prisoner who requires regular dialysis treatment.  On July 10, 2016, \nhe submitted a sick call form stating that the part of his arm where the dialysis port was \nplaced hurt very badly after dialysis.  The sick call form was not triaged by a nurse until \nJuly 19, when the nurse noted that CC would “be scheduled to come to the clinic to be \nassessed by the medical staff.”  He was not seen by medical staff in response to this sick \ncall request.  CC raised this issue again in another sick call form on October 8, asking to \nbe taken to see a vascular doctor because he was experiencing a lot of arm pain at the \ndialysis port site during dialysis.  Again, his form was not reviewed by a nurse until one \nweek later.  Upon review, the triage nurse simply said, “Thank you for expressing your \nconcern.”  Without any treatment, the problem became so bad that he was sent to the \nemergency room on November 9. \n•  DD, a 69-year-old prisoner, died in March 2016 of severe acute pancreatitis, which was \ncaused by gall stones and coronary artery disease.  He was incarcerated for a probation \nviolation on a previous felony offense.  He repeatedly sought emergency care for his \nabdominal pain and his chest pain, but there is no documented evidence that he received \nany medical assistance in the days prior to his death.  In the two days before his death, \nDD wrote several sick call slips.  A correctional officer returned one request because DD \nused profanity and there is no evidence in his medical chart that this request was received \nby medical staff or that they responded to his complaint.  Two hours before his death, he \nhad another prisoner submit a sick call request on his behalf.  DD was given a form by a \ncorrectional officer, to whom DD complained that he had chest pain and had not had a \nbowel movement in five days.  DD wrote on the form, “Help me please!”  He died hours \nlater, before the grievance was received by the medical staff and after DD was denied \naccess to emergency care. \nLack of access to medical care is especially acute for those prisoners held in restrictive \nhousing.  Because they are locked down in their cells for between 23 and 24 hours each day, \nthese prisoners have difficultly accessing sick call slips and then returning sick call slips to the \nbox.  This results in additional delays in access to care, beyond those experienced by prisoners in \ngeneral population, creating a serious risk of harm for this population.  For example: \n11 \n \n\n•  EE, a 53-year-old prisoner, was admitted to the Jail on March 31, 20156 and died ten \ndays later.  On admission, he was noted to be extremely psychotic, incoherent, and \nagitated, throwing feces.  Medical staff recognized his psychosis, but were unable to \ntransfer him to Eastern State Hospital because he first needed medical clearance.  He was \nnot seen by a psychiatrist to facilitate the clearance and refused his physical for three \ndays after his admission.  On April 3, he was moved to restrictive housing because he \nwas actively psychotic.  Despite being psychotic, in his medical chart, it was noted that \nthere were no contraindications to placement in restrictive housing.  On April 5, a nurse \nwrote:  “Patient seen in pod at officer request.  Pt naked and kneeling on the floor.  Pt. \nwith RLQ (right lower quadrant of abdomen) bulge.  Pressing against with his hand.  \nVerbalizes intense pain.  [Pod] officer to notify charge nurse.” Fourteen hours later, a \nnurse wrote: “Pt seen on the pod.  Per pod officer, pt. has thrown up and the vomit \n‘looked and smelled like feces.’ Pt observed kneeling down on the floor with the lid to \nhis blue bin in front of him which is covered with greenish clear bile.  Pt will not verbally \nrespond to questions.  Will schedule visit with MD for evaluation.” The nurse did not \nexamine EE.  She did not attempt to obtain vital signs.  She did not call for emergency \nmedical attention.  The next day, EE remained in restrictive housing.  He was not seen by \nthe nurse or medical provider.  A chart note from the director of mental health services on \nApril 7 reads: “Inmate (sic) went up to assess inmate to check on his mental history, and \nhe was found unresponsive at the time.  A code was called, and he later died from \ncomplications due to a duodenal ulcer.  This was the first and only mental health visit EE \nreceived at the Jail.  He did not receive any medical or psychiatric evaluation.  According \nto our medical expert, EE’s death was preventable had he received adequate medical \nattention. \nThe Jail also does not take prisoner grievances about lack of access to medical care \nseriously, resulting in significant harm to prisoners, even death.  For prisoners, grievances are the \nonly mechanism through which they can express complaints about the quality of the medical care \nand indicate when a medical problem is worsening.  When Jail staff are presented with evidence \nthat a prisoner is suffering from a serious medical condition and in need of prompt medical \nattention, a delay in rendering treatment can meet the Eighth Amendment standard.  See Sealock, \n218 F.3d at 1210 (delay of several hours in rendering medical treatment to prisoners presenting \nsymptoms of a heart attack met the subjective element of the Eighth Amendment test for \npurposes of summary judgment).  In December 2016, the Jail did not substantiate any of the \nmedical grievances related to being seen in a timely manner.  Yet, one prisoner wrote that she \nwanted to be seen by mental health staff to discuss an issue with her medication, which she had \nstopped receiving during pill pass.  During a follow-up visit with the Mental Health Director five \ndays later, the Director noted that although the psychiatrist ordered that an antipsychotic \nmedication be continued, this order was not entered into the system and no medication was \ndispensed.  Staff then responded to the prisoner’s grievance by stating, “[y]our concern has been \ndiscussed with Mental Health Director. . . . Thank you for bringing this to our attention,” and \nthen was marked as unsubstantiated. \n                                                 \n6 The Jail’s current medical contractor, CCS, did not start working in the Jail until December 2015.  Medical care at \nthe Jail at the time of this incident was provided by the Jail’s previous medical contractor, Naphcare.  Despite \nswitching medical contractors, inadequate medical treatment has continued as evidenced by the examples in section \nIV.A that occurred after CCS began working at the jail in December 2015. \n12 \n \n\nOther medical grievances were marked as unsubstantiated without any response given.  \nAlso, as described more fully above, BB was denied access to medical care in the days and hours \nleading up to his death.  His emergency grievances were ignored as his condition worsened, and \nhe slowly bled to death.  The head nurse ignored his complaints about problems eating and with \nhis bladder, by commenting that he had already been seen at the hospital and had two scans done \non his neck.  Delays in, or failure to render, medical treatment to a prisoner suffering from a \nbleeding ulcer, such as BB in the example above, is sufficient to constitute an Eighth \nAmendment violation.  See Smith v. Smith, 589 F.3d 736, 739 (4th Cir. 2009). \nc.  Inadequate Quality of Care \nAs a result of systemic failures, the Jail often fails to provide an adequate level of care, \nincluding proper medication administration.  See, e.g., Tillery v. Owens, 719 F. Supp. 1256, \n1292, 1307 (W.D. Pa. 1989) (finding that one of the medical service requirements for prisons \nincluded medication distribution).  At any given time, there are approximately 873 prisoners \nreceiving at least one medication, representing approximately 79% of the total population at the \nJail.  Only seven nurses provide around-the-clock coverage for medication distribution.  During \npill pass, prisoners not on lockdown status are supposed to line up at the door of their pod to \nreceive medications from the nurse.  The nurse administers medications to the prisoner, checks to \nensure the prisoner has swallowed the medications, and then makes a notation of the successful \nmedication administration.  For prisoners who do not appear at the door for pill pass, the nurse is \nsupposed to enter the pod with the security officer and confirm that the prisoner is refusing to \ntake his medications.  If a prisoner is refusing his medications, then the nurse is supposed to \nprepare a “Refusal of Treatment” form, which the nurse and the prisoner are to sign.  If the \nprisoner refuses, then an additional person must witness the refusal and sign the form. \nAvailable records and the following examples indicate that nurses are not accurately \nrecording when a prisoner is refusing medications.  See, e.g., Ginest, 333 F. Supp. 2d at 1205 \n(“Jails and prisons must maintain adequate, complete, and accurate medical records. . . . When \ninmates have shown systemic inadequacies in a jail’s or prison’s system of medical record \nkeeping . . . courts have issued prophylactic injunctive relief.”).  Furthermore, there is at least \none instance where a nurse falsified a prisoner’s medication records: \n•  FF, a 36-year-old prisoner with a history of sickle-cell anemia, was admitted to the Jail \non March 1, 2017.  Over the course of his stay, his condition worsened, as he experienced \nbouts of pneumonia and increasingly had difficulty breathing.  He was sent to the \nemergency room on August 14, 2017, released that same day, and then readmitted to the \nemergency room on August 16.  He was not seen by any medical professionals when he \nreturned from the emergency room on August 14, or the next day on August 15.  He \nremained in the hospital until his death on August 22.  On August 21, despite FF being in \nthe hospital, a nurse at the Jail signed a “Refusal of Treatment” form, indicating that FF \nrefused his medications during the morning pill pass, stating, “I don’t want it,” and \nfurther indicating that FF refused to sign the form.  There were a series of other notations \nin his medical file that he refused medications on August 19, 20, 21, and 23, despite \nbeing in the hospital and, in the case of the August 23 entry, having already died. \n•  As described earlier, in the early morning of August 6, 2016, 60-year-old BB died in the \nJail as a result of internal bleeding after submitting several emergency requests for \n13 \n \n\nmedical care.  At the 9:00 a.m. pill pass immediately following his death on August 6, the \nnurse did not seem to be aware that the prisoner had died, noting simply that he “did not \nattend pill pass.”  There is no entry for the 9:00 p.m. pill pass for that evening, despite BB \nhaving died early that morning.  The first notation of BB’s death in his medication record \nwas over 24 hours later, at the 9:00 a.m. pill pass on August 7.  However, during the pill \npass later that day at 9:00 p.m. on August 7, and at the pill pass at 9:00 a.m. on August 8, \ntwo nurses indicated that the patient missed his pill pass because he was a “no show” and \nbecause he was “not in [his] cell.” \nThe Jail has acknowledged problems with its pill pass procedure and has taken steps to \ntry to ensure the accuracy of medication distributions and refusals.  This includes locking down \nmost housing units during pill pass and opening four cell doors at a time.  The new procedure \nwas first implemented in mid-September 2017.  We look forward to learning whether the new \nprocedures will be adequate to address the issues identified above. \nMany prisoners do not receive the level of care appropriate to their condition when they \nare seen by a medical provider.  Because of the number of prisoners at the Jail with serious \nmedical needs and known shortages in medical and security staffing, prisoners are often not sent \nto receive outside medical care when they should.  “[A]n unusually long delay between the \nemergence of a serious medical need and treatment of that need” is grounds for finding that \nmedical care is constitutionally inadequate.  See Coppage v. Mann, 906 F. Supp. 1025, 1041 \n(E.D. Va. 1995) (citing Loe v. Armistead, 582 F.2d 1291, 1296 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 446 \nU.S. 928 (1980)).  See also Casey, 834 F. Supp. at 1546 (noting that referrals to outside care \nmust be “reasonably speedy” such that prisoners with significant medical conditions are not \nmade to endure “unacceptably long waits”).  This is particularly true if the delay results in \nsubstantial harm to the patient, such as severe pain, increase in significance of the medical \nproblem, or signs that the problem is becoming untreatable.  See Webb, 281 F. App’x at 167.  \nFailures to send prisoners to outside medical appointments in a timely fashion have resulted in \nsignificant harm to prisoners held at the Jail, as in the following examples: \n•  GG, a 56-year-old prisoner, came to the Jail from the Norfolk City Jail on June 15, 2017.  \nThe medical records transferred from Norfolk indicated a large liver mass, which was \ndiscovered during an ultrasound on June 6.  Despite being aware of the presence of this \nlarge liver mass, the Jail’s medical provider did not schedule a biopsy of this mass in the \nfive weeks between GG’s arrival at the Jail and his death.  During this time, GG was in \ngreat pain, was losing weight, was becoming increasingly jaundiced, was severely \ndehydrated, and was having difficulty eating.  The cause of his pain and the exact nature \nof the mass in his abdomen was not diagnosed, and no steps were taken to schedule an \nappointment with an outside provider to obtain a diagnosis.  On July 16, a nurse saw him \nvomiting.  He had an elevated and irregular heart rate and complained of extreme pain.  \nThe nurse wrote in his chart that she would notify the on-call physician.  GG was not \nseen by a doctor until July 18, for a routine, chronic care visit.  No biopsy of the large \nabdominal mass was performed during the next five weeks.  Staff watched him \ndeteriorate without benefit of diagnosis or treatment.  He died on July 25, of liver cancer \ndue to hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection. \n14 \n \n\n•  HH, a 52-year-old prisoner, was admitted to the Jail on December 28, 2012, from the \nNorfolk City Jail.  She had diabetes, thyroid disease, congestive heart failure, and was \nactively psychotic upon admission.  On January 11, 2013, she wrote that her whole body \nwas swollen and that she was having problems breathing.  She had labs drawn on January \n12, which were not evaluated by the doctor until January 23.  When she was seen on \nJanuary 23, she was noted to be unstable and unresponsive to the treatment previously \nprescribed; she was not sent for the emergency evaluation and treatment she required, but \nallowed to deteriorate further at the Jail.  Two days later, she complained of chest pain, \nhad an increased pulse, and increased blood pressure.  She was then admitted to the \nhospital and died four days later. \n3.  Inadequate Staffing and Inadequate Monitoring and Oversight Contribute to \nInadequate Medical Care \n \nGiven the Jail’s high needs population, medical staffing at the Jail is inadequate.  This \nlack of adequate staffing contributed to systemic failures and delays, seriously harming prisoners \nand creating a substantial risk of serious harm.  At the beginning of CCS’s contract in late 2015, \n37.7 medical and mental health full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) were allocated to meet \nthe needs of the prisoner population, with 32.90 of these staff members devoted to medical \nneeds.  This number included the Medical Director, who was the only M.D. on staff.  The \nMedical Director works 40 hours per week, Monday through Friday.  From January to \nSeptember 2016, despite allocations for round-the-clock medication staff in the contract, no \nmedical staff members worked the third, night shift.  This left an 8-hour window where there \nwere no medical staff on site.  Staffing coverage has since increased so that on the weekends and \nat night, the main medical clinic is staffed by a registered nurse and a medical assistant. \nWhile medical staffing levels in February 2017 increased to 50.8 FTEs, this number of \nmedical staff still is not enough to meet the needs of the prisoner population.  The Jail’s policy \nand contract with CCS requires a medical provider to see prisoners on the chronic care list within \n30 days of admission and then every 90 days thereafter.  As of March 2017, CCS was not able to \nsee chronic care patients every 90 days, as required by policy and under their contract with the \nJail.  Lack of adequate nursing staff has also had an effect on regular medication administration.  \nThe Jail has only seven nurses to provide around-the-clock coverage for administering \nmedications to over 800 prisoners between two to three times per day.  Because of the burden \nplaced on them by regular medication administration, nurses are not available to conduct other \ntreatments for prisoners, like post-operation wound care.  The following example illustrates how \nthe shortage of nursing staff has likely prevented prisoners from accessing medical care and \nlikely resulted in serious harm: \n•  On March 3, 2017, 64-year-old II had a complex ophthalmological procedure, which \ninvolved placing a drain inside his eye to remove built-up fluid as a result of his \nglaucoma.  After the procedure, II complained of pain and deterioration of his vision, yet \nstaff failed to call the ophthalmologist and no action was taken by the Jail’s medical staff.  \nNursing staff provided him with gauze pads, which he used to wipe his eye and place \nunder the bandage. These pads were not in the orders prescribed by the ophthalmologist \nand at his 10-day post-operation appointment, the doctor noted that the gauze under the \neye shield had caused massive inflammation and a corneal abrasion. \n15 \n \n\nThe Jail has also had a problem recruiting and retaining medical staff.  From the \nbeginning of the CCS contract in December 2015 until June 2017, the Jail did not have a \npermanent Medical Director.  During this 18-month period, the Jail had 27 different interim \nmedical directors, some of whom only lasted a few days.  This means that most prisoners saw \nany given interim medical director (the only M.D.) once.  A high rate of medical leadership \nturnover poses a risk to prisoner safety, especially in such a high-needs population.  The Jail’s \nBoard has acknowledged this risk, noting that its population would be better served by a full-\ntime medical director on staff who could provide leadership and a unified care plan, instead of a \nseries of interim directors coming from CCS’s corporate offices. \nIn addition to inadequate levels of medical staff, inadequate security staffing has \nprevented prisoners from accessing medical and mental health care at the Jail.  Almost every \nday, there are not enough security staff to escort prisoners in the Jail from the housing units to \nthe medical clinic for their appointments; to escort nurses during pill pass; and to escort medical \nand mental health professionals seeking access to prisoners in the housing units.  Additionally, at \ntimes, there are inadequate security staff to transport prisoners to their outside medical \nappointments, which totaled 1,204 in 2016.  Due to limitations on availability of security staff, \nCCS has been told by Jail staff to keep the number of outside medical appointments per day to \nfive or less.  This includes hospitalized prisoners, who require constant watch by a Jail security \nofficer 24 hours per day.  When there are not enough security staff to transport prisoners, \nappointments for prisoners with issues deemed to be non-critical must be rescheduled.  Lack of \nstaff to transport prisoners to the medical clinic and to outside medical appointments has resulted \nin many prisoners missing their appointments or having their appointments delayed. \nIn addition, the Jail does not have monitoring systems in place to identify and address \ndeficient areas of its medical care.  The Jail’s medical provider does not routinely conduct \nclinical studies of the quality of the care that it provides.  Instead, the Health Services \nAdministrator for the Jail’s medical provider conducts monthly audits that are largely \nadministrative in nature, such as recording the number of scheduled and unscheduled visits, the \npresence of health care documentation, and the documentation of medication administration.  \nThough she completes a series of audits every month, in 2017, only one audit involved a review \nof prisoner charts by the site medical director to evaluate medical care.  Of the administrative \naudits that are done, some fail to identify existing problems with medical care.\nFurthermore, the Jail does not have a full-time staff member to monitor  the Jail’s contract \nwith CCS.  During a meeting in December 2016, Board members noted the importance of \nmonitoring medical staff, stating “one of the most important [things, which] any Jail and the \nSheriffs can tell you [, is] that you have to have someone from the Jail Security Staff that stays \non top of the Medical Provider.  If you don’t then you may have cost issues, or delivery of \nmedical services [issues].”  However, the Jail has not had any Jail employee monitoring the \nmedical contract, instead relying on corrections officers to alert Jail management about any \nproblems.  In 2011, the Jail eliminated its Medical Compliance Manager position and has not \nsince replaced it.  At the end of 2015, the Jail hired an independent contractor to review its \nmedical contract with Naphcare and later with CCS.  This contractor works remotely, devoting \nabout 20 hours per month to work for the Jail.  Since the middle of 2016, he has not attended the \nmonthly meetings between senior security staff and CCS medical providers, transitioning to a \n16 \n \n\nmore passive role managing the contract.  Collectively, these systemic deficiencies contribute to \ninadequate medical care. \n4.  Officials at the Jail Knew of the Risk to Prisoner Health and Safety Posed by \nInadequate Medical Care and Disregarded It \n \nOfficials at the Jail have been aware of the deficiencies in medical care for years and \nhave failed to adequately address these deficiencies.  By disregarding the obvious risks to \nprisoner health and safety, officials at the Jail evince a deliberate indifference to prisoners’ \nconstitutional rights to adequate medical care.  See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736-38 (2002).  \nSee also Brown v. N.C. Dep’t of Corr., 612 F.3d 720, 723 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Odom v. S.C. \nDep’t of Corr., 349 F.3d 765, 770 (4th Cir. 2003) (“A prison official demonstrates deliberate \nindifference if he ‘knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.’”)).  Jail \nofficials have been aware of the harm caused to prisoners due to inadequate medical treatment \nand lack of access to care at least since the 2015 death of AA, which attracted national attention. \nThough the Jail switched medical providers after AA’s death, medical care under the \nJail’s current medical provider, CCS, has not significantly improved.  Nine months after \nswitching medical providers and one year after AA’s death, BB died of a bleeding ulcer after his \nrepeated requests for medical attention were ignored.  In the Jail’s answer and cross-claim filed \nin the wrongful death suit brought by the administrators of BB’s estate, the Jail claims that CCS \nbreached its service agreement with the Jail by “failing to provide appropriate clinically \nnecessary medical services, sick call, on-site health care services, and offsite services and \nhospitalization” to the deceased prisoner prior to his death in August 2016.  Though the Jail \nclaims that the medical services provided to this prisoner prior to his death were deficient, the \nJail nonetheless chose to renew CCS’s contract in February 2017. \n \nB.  Mental Health Care at the Jail is Inadequate in Violation of Prisoners’ \nConstitutional Rights \n \nThe Department also has reasonable cause to believe that the Jail has engaged in a pattern \nor practice of failing to provide prisoners with adequate mental health care in violation of their \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel \nand unusual punishment requires jails to provide prisoners with adequate mental health care.  See \nBowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. 1977) (noting “no underlying distinction between \nthe right to medical care for physical ills and its psychological or psychiatric counterpart”).  As \nwith medical care, deprivations of mental health care violate the Eighth Amendment if they are \nsufficiently serious and the prison official had a sufficiently culpable state of mind such that he \nwas deliberately indifferent to prisoner health or safety.  Wilson, 501 U.S. at 298.  The \nprotections afforded pretrial detainees are at least as great as a convicted prisoner’s Eighth \nAmendment rights.  See Buffington v. Baltimore Cty., Md., 913 F.2d 113, 119-20 (4th Cir. 1990). \n \n1.  Prisoners at the Jail have Serious Mental Health Needs Requiring Treatment \n \nPrisoners at the Jail have serious mental health needs that require treatment and place \nthem at serious risk of harm if their needs are not addressed adequately.  The Jail has both a large \nnumber of prisoners receiving some form of mental health treatment and a large number of \n17 \n \n\nprisoners with serious mental health needs.  The Jail consistently reports that approximately 50% \nof its prisoner population is on psychotropic medication at any given time.  In June 2016, the Jail \ndispensed mental health medications to prisoners on 1,052 different prescriptions, the most of \nany jail in Virginia. \nThe Jail also has a high number of prisoners with serious mental illness compared to \nother jails in Virginia.  For June 2017, the 54 jails in Virginia reported that an average of 9.55% \nof their overall prisoner population had a serious mental illness.  Hampton Roads Regional Jail \nhad the highest percentage of prisoners with a serious mental illness.7  Between December 1, \n2016, and July 25, 2017, the Jail identified 405 prisoners with serious mental illness, 268 of \nwhom were held at the Jail as of July 25.  This represents nearly 25% of the prisoners held at the \nJail at any given time, which is much higher than the statewide average of 9.55% as reported in \nJune 2017.  Many of these prisoners had mental health needs so severe that they required \ntreatment at one of the state psychiatric hospitals. \n \nIn June 2017, Hampton Roads Regional Jail also had the second highest number of \nmilitary veterans as prisoners, with 84 out of 999 prisoners statewide.  Of those veterans, 40 (or \napproximately 47%) had mental illness.  Twenty-three of these 84 (or approximately 27%) were \nhomeless prior to coming to Jail. \n \n2.  Prisoners are Subjected to a Substantial Risk of Serious Harm as a Result of \nInadequate Mental Health Care \n \nThe Jail’s inadequate mental health care places prisoners with serious mental illness at \nserious risk of harm.  Courts have previously identified many components as being minimally \nnecessary for a facility’s mental health program, including:  (1) a systematic program for \nscreening and evaluating prisoners in order to identify those who require mental health \ntreatment; (2) individualized treatment plans that provide for treatment that is more than \nplacement in restrictive housing and that includes close supervision of the prisoner patients; \n(3) prescription and administration of psychotropic medications with appropriate supervision \ncoupled with adequate psychotherapy; and (4) a basic program for identification, treatment, and \nsupervision of prisoners with suicidal tendencies.  See, e.g., Ruiz v. Estelle, 503 F. Supp. 1265, \n1339 (S.D. Tex. 1980) aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 679 F.2d 1115 (5th Cir. \n1982); Balla v. Idaho State Bd. of Corr., 595 F. Supp. 1558, 1577 (D. Idaho 1984); Coleman v. \nWilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1298 (E.D. Cal. 1995).  While a denial of any one of these factors \nalone may not amount to a constitutional violation, courts have examined these factors together \nto evaluate the constitutional adequacy of a jail’s mental health program. \na.  Inadequate Screening and Identification of Prisoners with Mental Illness \n  The Jail does not adequately screen its prisoners for mental health issues at intake.  \nCourts have considered whether a prison employs a systematic program to screen and evaluate \nprisoners for mental illness and suicidality, including supervision of intake nurses by higher-\n                                                 \n7 The Jail defines serious mental illness as a prisoner with one or more of the following diagnoses:  schizophrenia, \nschizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, an intellectual disability, gender dysphoria, and \njuveniles with mental health needs. \n18 \n \n\nlevel providers.  See, e.g., Coleman, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1305 (E.D. Cal. 1995) (concluding that \nthe Constitution requires a systematic screening program).  By contrast, the system at the Jail \nrelies on a prisoner self-reporting any mental health issues, which is not a proper or \nconstitutionally adequate intake system.  See Woodward v. Corr. Med. Servs. of Illinois, Inc., 368 \nF.3d 917, 927-28 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that evidence that nurse’s practice of not completing \nmental health intake forms and nurse’s supervisor’s failure to review the forms could amount to \nan Eighth Amendment violation); Thompson v. Ackal, 15-cv-02288, 2016 WL 1394352, at *8 \n(W.D. La. Mar. 9, 2016) (concluding that inaccuracies in the completion of intake and mental \nhealth screening forms, along with other inadequacies in care, amounted to a constitutional \nviolation); Ramirez v. Ferguson, 08-cv-5038, 2011 WL 1157997, at *25-26 (W.D. Ark. Mar. 29, \n2011) (concluding that prison’s failure to train officers on proper intake procedure, especially \nregarding prisoner’s past mental health problems, amounted to a constitutional violation).  If the \nprisoner does self-report a mental health issue and indicates that he was a client of a local \ncommunity services board (CSB) prior to coming to the Jail, the Jail does not have a practice of \ncalling the CSB to learn more about the prisoner’s mental health history. \nIf the prisoner does not self-report mental health issues during the screening and these \nissues are not later raised by the prisoner or identified independently by a correctional officer, \nthen the prisoner will not be placed on the mental health caseload and consequently will not be \nseen by mental health staff.  The intake nurse is responsible for telling the psychiatrist what \nmedications the prisoner is currently taking.  If the intake nurse fails to communicate this \ninformation to the psychiatrist or communicates the incorrect information, then the prisoner \nneeds to wait until his next medical appointment.  That appointment often occurs weeks after an \ninitial medication error, during which time the prisoner is not receiving the proper medication. \nFurthermore, the intake screening is conducted by a nurse who is not trained to be able to \nidentify symptoms of mental illness.  Nurse’s screenings are not systematically reviewed by \nsupervisors for accuracy.  This results in an under-identification of prisoners with mental health \nissues and prisoners not receiving the care that they need or having their care delayed.  Lack of \ntreatment or delays in treatment can result in significant harm, including in the following \nexamples: \n•  JJ, a 21-year-old prisoner, was admitted to the Jail on December 9, 2016.  He was \nadmitted directly from the hospital, where he had been for the past several weeks \nrecovering from a nearly fatal suicide attempt.  Upon admission, he was diagnosed with \nanxiety and unspecified major depression.  The intake nurse recommended JJ be housed \nin general population rather than in mental health housing and noted that he was being \nreferred to mental health for routine problems, which were non-emergent.  She did not \ncheck the box to indicate that JJ had acute problems relating to suicide, despite JJ coming \nto the Jail after a suicide attempt.  JJ was housed in general population until he was \nmoved several hours later by the Mental Health Director, who ordered that JJ be placed in \nrestrictive housing on suicide watch, where he remained until February 23, 2017.  \nAlthough the hospital recommended intense psychiatric engagement upon discharge to \nthe Jail, he was not seen at the Jail by a psychiatrist until January 6, 2017.  He did not \n19 \n \n\nreceive intense psychiatric engagement and committed suicide at the Jail on March 12, \n2017. \n•  EE, a 53-year-old prisoner, was admitted to the Jail on March 31, 2015, and died ten days \nlater.  A mental health evaluation completed at the Hampton City Jail the day he was \ntransferred to the Hampton Roads Regional Jail noted that he was extremely psychotic, \nincoherent, and agitated.  Although he had psychiatric symptoms, no mental health \nevaluation was done at the Regional Jail prior to his death. \nb.  Inadequate Treatment Planning \n  The Jail also fails to provide prisoners on its mental health caseload with individualized \ntreatment plans.  The Jail’s medical provider, CCS, acknowledges that “[s]uccessful mental \nhealth delivery requires psychiatric medication management, relevant treatment planning and \ndischarge planning.”  However, before December 2016, CCS did not create individualized \ntreatment plans.  Since that time, mental health staff have tried to create such plans, but due to \nlimited staffing, the psychiatrist has no time to review the plans to ensure that they provide \nadequate focus, purpose, and direction for the delivery of service.  Instead, he only has time to \nsign off on them.  The resulting plans are short documents that are neither comprehensive nor \nperson-centered and do not incorporate input from the prisoner.  Instead, the plans only include a \nbasic checklist for goals that are essentially the same for each prisoner.  Mental health staff have \nfailed to develop adequate, individualized treatment plans, including for the following \nindividuals: \n•  KK, a 28-year-old prisoner, was admitted to the Jail on February 22, 2017.  While \ndetained, she delivered a stillborn child on March 22.  She was seen by a psychiatrist on \nMarch 24, when Prozac was started.  There was no documented follow-up after this visit.  \nAlthough KK had a treatment plan, there was no apparent input by a psychiatrist, and \nthere was no specific information provided about the nature or the frequency of the \ncounseling to be provided or how often KK was to meet with a mental health \nprofessional. \n•  LL, a 39-year-old prisoner, was admitted to the Jail on November 15, 2016, with a \ndiagnosis of bipolar disorder.  He was seen via telepsychiatry on December 8.  Although \nthe note indicated manic symptoms, his medication was not adjusted.  He was placed in \nrestrictive housing on January 9, 2017, and voiced suicidal thoughts the next day.  His \nmental health symptoms and suicidal thoughts increased while he was in restrictive \nhousing.  There was no documented treatment plan to provide focus, direction, and \npurpose to his treatment. \nThis treatment planning extends to the period immediately following a prisoner’s \ndischarge.  The Jail fails to provide some amount of medication for an outgoing prisoner who has \nbeen receiving treatment at the Jail for a period of time reasonably necessary for him to obtain \ntreatment “on his own behalf.”  See Wakefield v. Thompson, 177 F.3d 1160, 1164 (9th Cir. 1999) \n(the state has a duty to provide medication to an outgoing prisoner in a supply sufficient “to \nensure that he has medication during the period of time reasonably necessary to permit him to \nconsult a doctor and obtain a new supply”).  See also Lugo v. Senkowski, 114 F. Supp. 2d 111, \n20 \n \n\n115 (N.D.N.Y. 2000) (prison has a “duty to provide medical services to outgoing prisoner who is \nreceiving continuing treatment at the time of his release for the period of time reasonably \nnecessary for him to obtain treatment ‘on his own behalf,’” which could have included \nforwarding medical records to another provider and facilitating performance of medical \nprocedure there).  As of May 2017, a prisoner being discharged from the Jail would be given \nbetween 3 and 30 days of medication, depending on how much was left on his latest refill.  \nWhile some quantities within that range are adequate in the circumstances, others are too low to \nfulfill the Jail’s constitutional obligation.  Moreover, the quantity of medication the Jail gives a \nprisoner is random; the Jail does not determine the quantity based on the date of the prisoner’s \nscheduled appointment with an outside mental health provider or diagnosis.  Instead, the Jail \nrelies on the day of the month the prisoner is released and how much medication remains on their \nmonthly medication pack. \nc.  Inadequate Medication Administration and Psychotherapy \n  The Jail does not provide adequate mental health treatment services to prisoners, failing \nto provide adequate medication management and therapy sessions.  As discussed in section \nIV.A.2.c supra, the Jail fails to adequately administer medications to prisoners by failing to order \nthe appropriate medications in a timely manner, failing to accurately deliver medications to \nprisoners on lockdown status, and failing to administer correct dosages to prisoners.  \nPsychotropic medications are distributed via the same process as non-psychotropic medications, \nso the problems that plague the Jail’s general medication administration procedures, see IV.A.2.c \nsupra, apply equally to those prisoners on the mental health caseload who receive psychotropic \nmedications, often with deleterious consequences. \nThe Jail provides little to no psychotherapy.  As reported by the Jail’s mental health \nprovider, from January to December 2016, the Jail conducted no individual therapy sessions and \nno group therapy sessions for the hundreds of inmates suffering from mental illness.  By June \n2017, there was no significant improvement, as the Jail then reported that no prisoners received \nindividual counseling, only 12 prisoners received group counseling, and only 32 prisoners \nreceived substance abuse counseling.  There were no programs held specifically for women. \nThe Jail has been increasing its group therapy hours, notably through the extra personnel \nhired under a grant.  The Jail, however, has been slow to ramp up group treatment for prisoners \nwith serious mental illness.  In May 2017, the Jail conducted two mental health treatment groups \nthat could accommodate about 25 male prisoners.  There were no mental health treatment groups \nfor women.  For the quarter ending on June 30, 2017, there were no one-on-one therapy hours, \nand only 20 hours of group therapy and 10 hours of peer support.  The number of group \ntreatment sessions is limited by the number of available staff, and by the rooms available for \ngroup therapy sessions.  Although most housing pods have a multipurpose room where group \nsessions can be held, there are no multipurpose rooms in the two pods where the prisoners with \nthe most acute medical and mental health needs are housed.  The other available rooms for group \nsessions can accommodate only 15 people.  These rooms, which are outside the housing units, \nrequire security staff to transport prisoners to and from the counseling sessions.  Like mental \n21 \n \n\nhealth staff, security staff are also in short supply, which limits the number of groups that can be \nconducted at any one time. \nPrisoners in restrictive housing do not have access to group therapy sessions.  The only \nmental health treatment they receive is individual counseling with mental health staff through a \nclosed cell door.  These limitations on individual counseling for prisoners in restrictive housing \nare especially troubling given that, for the first six months of 2017, on average, there were 70 \nprisoners in restrictive housing with serious mental illness daily.  There is no therapeutic \nenvironment in which they can speak with mental health counselors.  These cell-front check-ins \nare insufficient as counseling and do not constitute actual mental-health treatment.  The prisoners \nwe spoke with cited this as one of their primary complaints about the mental health treatment \nthey did receive, stating that due to a lack of privacy, they do not speak candidly with mental \nhealth staff because they do not feel comfortable sharing some information in front of the other \nprisoners in the cell and staff.  The lack of confidentiality undermines the therapeutic utility of \nthese contacts, and contributes to a mental health system that is inadequate for the acutely \nmentally ill population housed at the Jail. \nd.  Inadequate Treatment and Supervision of Suicidal Prisoners \n  The Jail’s suicide prevention procedures suffer from serious deficiencies, which put \nprisoners at serious risk of harm.  One of the most critical components of a minimally adequate \nmental health treatment program is the “identification, treatment and supervision of inmates with \nsuicidal tendencies.”  Ruiz, 503 F. Supp. at 1339.  See also Coleman, 912 F. Supp. at 1298 n.10.  \nMost importantly, the Jail’s suicide prevention program fails to properly address the risk \npresented by acutely suicidal prisoners placed on suicide watch.  Currently, prisoners who are \nacutely suicidal are placed on “constant observation” in a suicide resistant cell.  The cell in \nwhich they are placed does not have any blankets, sheets, or bedding.  They are not allowed to \ntake any of their clothing or other items with them when on “constant observation.”  Instead, \nthey are issued a mattress and a suicide-resistant smock. \nPrisoners on “constant observation” are monitored by a 24-hour camera feed, with \nphysical checks by security personnel every 15 minutes.  This camera monitoring is inadequate \nto address the risk presented by prisoners who are presenting an imminent risk of harm to \nthemselves.  First, camera monitoring is insufficient because of the unreliability of the Jail’s \nsurveillance cameras.  The camera system has been failing in recent months, and there is no \nrecord of how often the cameras fail, or where.  During one week in August 2017, the Jail found \nthat 65 of its 500 cameras were not working and stated that “this is a consistent problem.”  \nSecond, cameras are monitored by the pod officer and the officers in the command center, where \n16 different cameras are displayed at once, and are often tasked with watching as many as nine \ndifferent prisoners.  Third, the “suicide-resistant” cells in which prisoners are placed for constant \nmonitoring have significant blind spots, which are well known to staff and prisoners alike.  In \nApril 2017, MM, who was diagnosed with a personality disorder, engaged in self-harm while on \nconstant suicide watch in a camera cell.  The day after MM was placed in a camera cell, he was \nfound by a security officer to be biting both of his arms and spitting blood on the floor.  The \nofficer observed that MM was biting his arms while leaning his back on the door so he would not \n22 \n \n\nbe in plain view of the camera.  This example illustrates the significant danger to which suicidal \nprisoners in camera cells are exposed. \n  Prisoners on suicide watch do not routinely interact with the psychiatrist.  Interactions \nwith the psychiatrist are important because he is the only mental health professional who can \nproperly assess whether there are psychotropic interventions that could help alleviate the \nsuicidality.  With over 500 prisoners on his caseload, the psychiatrist does not have enough time \nto interact regularly with suicidal patients, contributing to the inadequacy of the Jail’s mental \nhealth program.  This caseload becomes even more difficult to manage now that there is no \nlonger a psychiatrist on site, and treatment is being conducted remotely by a telepsychiatrist. \nMoreover, the Jail has a practice of transitioning prisoners from suicide watch directly to \nrestrictive housing, exposing already mentally fragile individuals to harsh and dangerous \nconditions.  For example, on August 1, 2016, NN voiced suicidal ideation in general population \ndue to being “depressed about court.”  The Jail responded by placing her on suicide watch in a \nrestrictive housing cell where she remained for 14 days, even though mental health staff reported \nthat she had “appropriate,” rather than suicidal, thinking and that she told them she was not \nsuicidal one day after being placed there.  During these 14 days, there were no documented \nmental health interventions or treatment plans to address her mental instability.  By placing \nsuicidal prisoners in restrictive housing, the Jail limits their access to therapeutic treatment and \nfails to provide prisoners with long-term care.  It is important for the Jail to recognize that a \nproper suicide prevention program will include short- and long-term care that provides \nmeaningful therapeutic contact to mitigate suicide risk.  Collectively, these acts and omissions \nresult in deficient medical care for prisoners. \n \n3.  Inadequate Staffing and Poor Facility Design Contribute to Inadequate Mental \nHealth Care \n \nThe Jail does not have enough mental health professionals to treat the prisoners on its \nmental health caseload, including the 500 prisoners who take psychotropic medications, over 200 \nof whom have been diagnosed with a serious mental illness.  Courts have held that having \nenough mental health professionals is an essential part of any adequate mental health program.  \nSee Coleman, 912 F. Supp. at 1306 (quoting Balla, 595 F. Supp. at 1577) (constitutionally \nadequate mental health care requires “mental health staff in ‘sufficient numbers to identify and \ntreat in an individualized manner those treatable inmates suffering from serious mental \ndisorders’”).  See also Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 521 (2013) (noting that mental health \ntreatment can be impeded by lack of adequate correctional staff, who are required to “escort \nprisoners to medical facilities or bring medical staff to the prisoners”).  Historically, the Jail’s \nmental health staffing levels have been grossly inadequate.  From May 2012 to December 2015, \nthe Jail only had 12 weekly psychiatry hours, 2.0 full-time equivalent (FTE) mental health \ncounselors and 1.0 FTE psychiatric nurse practitioner.  There was no mental health professional \npresent on the weekends.  At the beginning of CCS’s contract in January 2016, there were a total \nof 4.8 mental health staff provided for in the staffing matrix, which included 1.0 FTE for a \npsychologist and program director, 0.4 FTE for a psychiatrist, 1.0 FTE for a psychiatric nurse \npractitioner, and 2.4 FTE for social workers.  However, from the beginning of CCS’ contract \nuntil July 2016, the Jail did not have a mental health director or a full-time psychologist.  As of \nMarch 2017, the Jail had a total of only 6.95 mental health staff and did not have any mental \n23 \n \n\nhealth professionals working on the weekend.  The Jail has since increased its mental health \nstaffing levels, mostly with the help of the money from a grant, but we look forward to learning \nwhether those positions will remain funded when the grant expires in 2018. \nThough staffing levels have increased recently, the current levels are still not adequate to \nmeet the needs of the Jail’s acute population.  The American Psychiatric Association \nrecommends one FTE psychiatrist for every 75-100 prisoners with serious mental illness.  The \nJail currently has approximately 260 prisoners with serious mental illness, and only contracts for \none psychiatrist, who now practices telemedicine.  The Jail itself recognizes that the current \nnumber of medical and mental health professionals is inadequate and does not meet the Virginia \nCompensation Board’s minimum staffing standards.  The Jail requested funding for an additional \n23 medical and mental health treatment positions for fiscal year 2018. \nOne of the biggest current shortfalls in the Jail’s mental health staffing has been the \npaucity of psychiatry hours.  The following are illustrative examples of the resulting harm: \n•  OO, a 34-year-old prisoner, gave birth to her first child on February 4, 2017.  On \nFebruary 9, a staff referral form noted that she was in urgent need of mental health \ntreatment because she was actively sobbing and asking to speak to someone for post-\npartum depression and missing her baby.  This request was repeated to a mental health \nprofessional ten days post-partum, during her behavioral health initial evaluation.  During \nour visit to the Jail in late March 2017, OO told us she had not gotten any mental health \nservices since the birth of her child and that she could not sleep.  She reported that prior \nto coming to Jail, she was taking an anti-depressant and an anti-anxiety medication.  She \nalso reported to us that a week and a half prior to our visit, a nurse saw her crying and \ntold OO she was on a list to be seen by mental health, but she had still not seen anyone.  \nOn March 2, a mental health professional referred her to a psychiatrist for evaluation due \nto her high anxiety, depression, and “racing thoughts.”  She was released for time served \non April 3, 2017, without seeing a psychiatrist for her post-partum depression. \n•  PP, a 54-year-old with a history of major depression, was transferred to the Jail on \nFebruary 19, 2015.  On April 1, PP filed a grievance stating that he had requested to see a \npsychiatrist because his medicine was not working and he was having anxiety attacks at \nnight, but had “been put off on several occasions.”  The next day, a security supervisor \nconfronted PP about a letter he wrote to a female prisoner at another facility.  In the \nletter, PP said that he was previously under the care of a psychiatrist, but had not yet seen \none at the Jail.  He said that sitting in the Jail “was not good or safe” for him (he wanted \nto work and to go outside).  He complained about feeling threatened by other prisoners \nand stated that he was “trying to avoid a bad situation” which he felt was “about to get \nvery serious.”  He then told the supervisor that in his letter, he was referring to a mental \nhealth issue that was not being addressed.  Though the supervisor agreed to refer PP to a \nmental health professional, she also wrote him up for having contraband in his cell, for \nwhich he was placed in restrictive housing.  Prior to his placement in restrictive housing, \nhe did not receive any mental health evaluation.  He complained about his medications \nnot working and asked to see a psychiatrist.  He was told by the social worker that he had \nbeen scheduled for “an initial assessment” with a mental health nurse practitioner.  Later \nthat day, on April 3, he was found hanging in his cell.  Despite a history of serious mental \n24 \n \n\nillness, he did not see a psychiatrist during the nearly two months between his admission \nand his suicide.  The only evaluation he received was by a social worker on the morning \nof his death. \n  From December 2015, when CCS replaced the Jail’s previous mental health provider, \nthrough March 2017, there were two full-time mental health professionals and two part-time \npsychiatrists to treat the approximately 500 prisoners on psychotropic medications.  CCS’s \ncontract provides for 36 hours of psychiatry services per week, but there were periods under the \nCCS contract when only 16 hours per week were actually provided.  In order to fill the gaps in \npsychiatry services due to an insufficient number of professionals on site, the Jail used \ntelepsychiatrists, who interviewed prisoners via television screens wheeled cell side onto the \nunits, in earshot of other prisoners. \nThe Jail hired a 0.9 FTE psychiatrist to work on site starting in March 2017 because it \nbelieved that the acuity of its serious mental illness population demanded a direct interaction \nbetween the prisoner and the provider.  But this sole psychiatrist does not have enough time to \ncomplete the most basic task of renewing mental health medications for the prisoners who \nreceive them.  The psychiatrist is supposed to renew medications every 90 days but has often \nbeen unable to personally see every prisoner in that time frame to renew their medication.8  \nBecause the psychiatrist does not have enough time to renew medications, a registered nurse, \nwho is not licensed to prescribe medication, has been renewing the medications in the computer \nin order to avoid expiration and a lapse in the prisoners receiving their prescriptions.  This is not \na safe practice – medications should not be renewed without an appropriate follow-up with a \nprescribing professional.  Many of these medications might need to be changed or the dosage \naltered, but that is not happening in the absence of adequate and deliberate follow-up by the \nprescriber.  This practice can increase the risk of noncompliance with medication and the \nemergence of symptoms because there is inadequate follow-up with the prescriber, who can \naddress questions and concerns about the medication.  These concerns are amplified given that \nthe Jail’s only on-site psychiatrist quit in September 2017 and was replaced by one \ntelepsychiatrist. \nThe Jail’s psychologist/mental health director is similarly stretched thin, such that she is \nnot able to perform all of her duties.  She provided us with a list of her duties, which included 35 \nbulleted items, many of which were to be completed on a daily basis.  Because it is not possible \nfor her to complete all of these tasks by herself, some of them have fallen by the wayside and \nexpose prisoners to the substantial risk of harm.  For example, as mental health director, she \nwould ordinarily supervise the clinical decisions made by her staff, discuss difficult cases with \nthem, and brainstorm treatment options.  She currently does not engage in any of these duties \nbecause she does not have the time.  Moreover, as director of the program, she should be \nfocusing on engaging in more supervisory tasks and providing programmatic direction for the \n                                                 \n8 For example, during the week of our tour, the psychiatrist was scheduled to see 43 prisoners.  Of these prisoners, \nhe was not able to see nine of them, or approximately 20% of the prisoners on his list.  As of the end of March 2017, \nthe psychiatrist had a list of 241 prisoners who had appointments in the month of March, but who had not been seen \nby the psychiatrist.  As of May 23, 2017, the oldest outstanding appointment on the psychiatrist’s waiting list was a \nprisoner who was supposed to have been seen on April 23, a month earlier. \n25 \n \n\nmental health staff.  Because of the shortage in staff, she must instead provide direct counseling \nservices to prisoners. \nMental health staff need to be accompanied by security staff when they enter the housing \nunits and when they conduct group therapy sessions.  Often, there are not enough security staff to \naccompany them.  Consequently, mental health staff have to return to a unit repeatedly to check \non security staff availability.  In addition, lack of security staff to escort mental health staff can \nimpede the response to mental health emergencies.  For example, in 2017, JJ committed suicide \nby tying a bedsheet from his bedframe around his neck after prisoners had been locked in for the \nnight.  During his regular rounds, the one officer working in that pod discovered the prisoner \nhanging.  He attempted to radio for backup, but his radio failed.  Since there was no other officer \nworking in the pod, the officer waited for backup before administering aid to the prisoner.  \nBackup officers only arrived after the officer spent several minutes yelling for assistance.  They \narrived too late; JJ was pronounced dead on the scene by emergency personnel. \nThe Jail’s physical structure is not designed to hold its current, high-needs population.  \nThe prisoners with the most acute medical and mental health needs are supposed to be held in \npods 1 and 2 of Housing Unit 1.  These pods can hold a total of 125.  This is a fraction of the \nmore than 200 prisoners with serious mental illness who are in the facility at any given time.  \nBecause the Jail does not have enough beds in its designated mental health pod, the Jail has \nbegun placing prisoners with mental health issues in Housing Unit 2, pod 1, referred to as its \nmental health “step-down” unit.  But these prisoners do not receive any treatment or services \nabove what are available to prisoners in general population units, and they are not at any less risk \nof harm than those prisoners in the acute medical and mental health pods.  JJ committed suicide \nin 2017 while in this step-down unit.  \n4.  Officials at the Jail Knew of the Risk to Prisoner Health and Safety Posed by \nInadequate Mental Health Care and Disregarded It \n \nThe death of AA in August 2015 put Jail officials on notice that systemic inadequacies in \nits mental health system, including inadequate psychotherapy and medication administration, \nposed substantial risks of serious harm to prisoners.  Yet the Jail has failed to take steps to \neliminate these risks, evincing deliberate indifference to prisoner health and safety.  See Farmer, \n511 U.S. at 837 (a prison official is liable under the Eighth Amendment if he “knows of and \ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety”); Hope, 536 U.S. at 738-41; Smith, 589 \nF.3d at 738-39 (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104-05).  These failures increased the number of \nprisoners requiring transfer to a state psychiatric hospital.  Prisoners are not receiving adequate \nmental health treatment in the Jail and decompensating to the point that they require immediate \ncare at a state psychiatric hospital.  The number of prisoners for whom the Jail has sought a court \norder to transfer to a state psychiatric hospital increased significantly during our investigation, \nfrom 14 for the 13-month period from September 2015 to September 2016, to 50 in the five-\nmonth period from June to October 2017.  The increase in prisoners requiring transfer to a state \nhospital, even after the Jail changed medical providers in December 2015, is likely due in \nsignificant part to the dangerously low number of mental health professionals at the Jail, with \none telepsychiatrist maintaining a waiting list of over 200 individuals. \n \n26 \n \n\nC.  The Jail’s Use of Prolonged Restrictive Housing Under Current Conditions, \nIncluding the Failure to Provide Adequate Medical and Mental Health Care, \nViolates the Constitutional Rights of Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness \n \nThe Jail’s pattern or practice of using restrictive housing under current conditions—\nincluding the duration and frequency of restrictive housing, the deprivation of human interaction, \nand the failure to provide adequate medical and mental health care—places prisoners at a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm.  There is reasonable cause to believe that the combination of \ncurrent conditions and the Jail’s use of restrictive housing for prisoners with serious mental \nillness violates their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See Sweet, 529 F.2d \nat 861 (noting that the “cumulative effect of several conditions will bring solitary confinement \nwithin the prohibitions of the [E]ighth [A]mendment”). \n1.  Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness Are Subjected to a Substantial Risk of \nSerious Harm as a Result of the Jail’s Use of Prolonged Restrictive Housing \n \nThe Jail’s practice of subjecting prisoners with serious mental illness to prolonged \nperiods of restrictive housing under conditions, including the denial of access to adequate \nmedical and mental health care, that places these prisoners at substantial risk of serious harm \nshows deliberate indifference to their health and safety.9  See Palakovic v. Wetzel, 854 F.3d 209, \n216-17, 226, 230 (3d Cir. 2017) (holding that a prisoner with serious mental illness who was \nheld in a 100 square foot restrictive housing cell 23 hours during the week and 24 hours during \nthe weekend for “multiple 30-day stints,” and who received only mental health interviews \nthrough his cell door slot stated a plausible Eighth Amendment claim “in light of the increasingly \nobvious reality that extended stays in solitary confinement can cause serious damage to mental \nhealth”).  The Third Circuit has acknowledged the “robust body of legal and scientific authority \nrecognizing the devastating mental health consequences caused by long-term isolation in solitary \nconfinement,” including “anxiety, panic, paranoia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, \npsychosis, and even a disintegration of the basic sense of self-identity,” as well as physical harm \nsuch as “suicide and self-mutilation.”  Id. at 225-26. \n \nSimilarly, in 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia held that a \nprisoner who recently had been suicidal stated a plausible Eighth Amendment claim when he \nalleged that he was held in a restrictive housing cell for 23 to 24 hours a day without reading \nmaterials or other stimuli for a three and half month stint, a two and half month stint, and a two-\nweek stint over an eight-month period.  Latson v. Clarke, 249 F. Supp. 3d 838, 845-48 (W.D. Va. \n                                                 \n9 The Fourth Circuit has not addressed the constitutionality of conditions similar to those in Hampton Roads \nRegional Jail.  But see Incumaa v. Stirling, 791 F.3d 517, 534 (4th Cir. 2015) (distinguishable because the prisoner \nhad been in solitary confinement for 20 years, but favorably citing Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Davis v. Ayala, \n––– U.S. ––––, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2194-95 (2015) for the proposition that “[p]rolonged solitary confinement exacts a \nheavy psychological toll that often continues to plague an inmate’s mind even after he is resocialized”); In re Long \nTerm Administrative Segregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters, 174 F.3d 464, 466-68 (4th Cir. 1999) \n(distinguishable because prisoners did not have serious mental illness); Williams v. Branker, 462 F. App’x 348 (4th \nCir. 2012) (unpublished) (distinguishable because the prisoner did not allege that he was subjected to serious harm \nor that he was denied adequate mental health care as a result of the restrictive housing). \n \n27 \n \n\n2017).  The court noted that “[r]esearch has shown that the impacts of solitary confinement can \nbe similar to those of torture and can include a variety of negative physiological and \npsychological reactions [and that t]hese effects are amplified in individuals with mental illness \nand can exacerbate underlying conditions . . . .”10  Id. at 847.  The court concluded:  “It is \nplausible that the alleged conditions combined to deprive [the prisoner] of the single, identifiable \nhuman need of mental health and sanity.”  Id. at 860.11 \n \nAbout a quarter of the Jail’s 774 cells are designated as restrictive housing cells.  \nPrisoners at the Jail can be placed in restrictive housing for three reasons:  (1) administrative \nrestriction; (2) disciplinary restriction; or (3) protective custody.  Despite minor differences \nbetween those statuses, the experience of the prisoners is essentially the same.  In these cells, a \nprisoner is housed alone, typically for 22 or more hours per day during the week and even longer \non weekends.12  The cells are 80 square feet and most have a metal sink and toilet, a metal desk \nand stool, and a metal bed frame with a mattress (although six cells do not have beds at all).  \nEach cell has a horizontal window near the ceiling, roughly six inches tall and forty-five inches \nwide, which faces outside but is covered with an opaque film to allow light in but to prohibit \nprisoners from seeing outside.  The cells have solid metal doors with narrow slots at waist level, \nwide enough for food trays to pass through, and small foggy, plexiglass windows facing into the \nhousing unit’s common area.  \n \nDuring the first six months of 2017, a daily average of 70 prisoners with serious mental \nillness were held in restrictive housing.  This accounts for 47% of prisoners held there.  Of the \n496 prisoners the Jail identified as having serious mental illness between July 2016 and July \n2017,13 67% had spent some time in restrictive housing, and 36% had spent more than a month \nconsecutively in restrictive housing.  Sixty-three of those prisoners spent three consecutive \nmonths or more in restrictive housing; 25 spent six consecutive months or more; and four spent \nmore than a year consecutively. \n \n                                                 \n10 See also Porter v. Clarke, 290 F. Supp. 3d 518, 531-32 (E.D. Va. 2018) (distinguishable because prisoners were \non death row for more than six years, nonetheless recognizing the “large and growing body of literature—both \nacademic and legal—discussing the potentially devastating effects of prolonged periods of isolation”). \n \n11 See also Ind. Prot. & Advocacy Servs. Comm’n v. Comm’r, Ind. Dep’t of Corr., No. 08-cv-01317, 2012 WL \n6738517, at *3-6, *12, *15, *17, *23 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 31, 2012) (following a bench trial, finding that the “conditions \nin the segregation units [in Indiana’s prisons] cause[d] a predictable deterioration of the mental health of seriously \nmentally ill prisoners” and holding that those conditions and the failure to provide adequate treatment for those \nprisoners, violated the Eighth Amendment) (prisoners with serious mental illness were held in 80 square foot cells \nfor approximately 23 hours a day for between three and six months, and in some case up to a year, with limited \nreading materials – though some could purchase a radio or a television  – and had mental health treatment often only \nthrough medication or responses to incidents of actual self-harm); Restrictive Housing Report, at 99 (recommending \nthat “[g]enerally, inmates with serious mental illness should not be placed in restrictive housing”). \n \n12 See also Davis v. Ayala, ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2208 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (referring to the \n“usual pattern” of solitary confinement as being housed in “a windowless cell no larger than a typical parking spot \nfor 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when [a prisoner] leaves it, he is allowed little or no opportunity for \nconversation or interaction with anyone”). \n \n13 The Jail’s mental health staff had been diagnosing prisoners with serious mental illness prior to July 2016, but \nonly began tracking them in a way that could be easily cross-referenced with restrictive housing stays in July 2016. \n28 \n \n\nPrisoners with serious mental illness are not, for the most part, spending long periods of \ntime in restrictive housing because of disciplinary infractions.  During the first half of 2017, 73 \nprisoners with serious mental illness spent only 12 days on average on disciplinary status \n(ranging from 1 to 84 days) in restrictive housing, while 186 prisoners with serious mental illness \nspent more than 40 days on average on administrative status (ranging from 1 to 429 days).   The \nJail places prisoners in restrictive housing for administrative reasons because the Jail is not \nproviding adequate mental health treatment to address prisoners’ mental health needs while they \nare in general population.  When these prisoners are unable to function in the general population \nbecause of their unmet mental health needs, the Jail sends them to restrictive housing on \nadministrative status.  We saw many examples of prisoners being transferred from general \npopulation to restrictive housing on administrative restriction, sometimes with a status of \n“administrative restriction - mental deficient” or “administrative restriction - unable to adapt.”  \nSimilarly, a prisoner might serve a short stay in restrictive housing for disciplinary time but then \nbe held in restrictive housing for longer periods of time in administrative restriction.  Below are \ntwo examples: \n \n•  On March 16, 2017, QQ, diagnosed by the Jail with schizoaffective disorder, was placed \nin restrictive housing under “Administrative Restriction – Mental Deficient” where he \nremained for the next 78 days until being transferred to a state psychiatric hospital.  He \nwas placed in restrictive housing after reportedly making sexually inappropriate \ncomments to an officer.  Seven months earlier, the Jail’s mental health clinician observed \nthat QQ was “very disoriented and disheveled,” and was “guarded and appear[ed] to be \nparanoid” during a mental health evaluation.  Also, the clinician reported that QQ’s \ncurrent mental health issues were:  “Sleeping 2 hrs in a day, loss of energy … fogginess, \n[and] inmate also report[s] that he is sometime[s] over excited, laughing a lot, angry, \ncrying for no reason, increase[d] mood swings, distractible, poor concentration and \nfocus.”  About two weeks later, on September 2, 2016, a court released him from the Jail.  \nOn March 15, 2017, QQ was admitted back to the Jail, where the next day he was placed \nin restrictive housing under “Administrative Restriction – Mental Deficient.”  While he \nwas in restrictive housing during the next 78 days, a community case worker visited him \nin preparation for an upcoming court hearing and told the Jail that he should be \nreevaluated because of concerns about his mental health status.  This prompted a Jail \nmental health clinician to reevaluate him on April 13, 2017.  The notes of that evaluation \nstated possible deterioration of his mental health in which he “displayed inappropriate \nlaughing [and the] pod officer reported that he can be quick to anger.”  Despite this, QQ \nremained in restrictive housing for another 50 days, until the Jail transferred him to a \nstate psychiatric hospital. \n \n•  On January 13, 2017, RR, diagnosed by the Jail with schizoaffective disorder, was placed \nin restrictive housing for a disciplinary infraction for failing to obey an order, where he \nstayed for 10 days until his status changed to administrative restriction, where he stayed \nfor more than 250 days.  After being on administrative restriction for more than six \nmonths, on July 21, 2017, he filed a sick call request to move to the Jail’s mental health \npod which was approved by a Jail mental health clinician on August 7, 2017.  Yet, he was \nstill in restrictive housing as of our last visit to the Jail on October 20, 2017. \n \n29 \n \n\nIn addition to being subjected to the physical conditions described above for prolonged \nperiods of time, prisoners with serious mental illness in restrictive housing do not receive \nadequate mental health care.  They do not receive meaningful out-of-cell activities, such as \nconfidential individual and group therapy, and peer or other counseling, as well as unstructured \nactivities such as socializing with peers and eating out of their cells.  Indeed, the Jail’s mental \nhealth staff expressed that they have extreme difficulty in accessing prisoners in the restrictive \nhousing units.  Prisoners there are very rarely able to have an out-of-cell, confidential treatment \nsession.  Instead, any face-to-face contact mental health staff have with prisoners in restrictive \nhousing consists of walking to each cell and asking how the person is doing and whether they \nhave any issues through a crack at the hinge of the solid metal door, which has led prisoners to \nrefer to it as “crack therapy.”  These conversations are often in the presence of corrections \nofficers who are required by policy to escort mental health staff during their rounds, thus making \nit difficult to have confidential conversations.  These practices hinder mental health staff’s ability \nto adequately identify and monitor prisoners with acute symptoms in need of intervention. \n \nMoreover, mental health staff often cannot complete or even start their rounds because of \nthe lack of security staff or the occurrence of another jail task on the restrictive housing units, \nsuch as pill pass, laundry, commissary, meal time, quiet time, or count time.  Mental health staff \nmembers told us that they sometimes have to return to these units multiple times a day to find a \nbrief period when they can round, and that some days these impediments completely block them \nfrom seeing anyone.  One experienced mental health staff member’s biggest barrier to providing \ntreatment to prisoners in restrictive housing was not being able to consistently meet with them in \na private setting outside their cell. \n \nSystemic deficiencies contribute to the Jail’s overreliance on and inappropriate use of \nrestricting housing as a means of controlling its prisoners with serious mental illness.  Those \ndeficiencies include inadequacies in its mental health program, a system-wide marginalization of \nthe concerns of mental health staff, deficiencies in security operations, and ineffective oversight \nmechanisms for assessing the risk restrictive housing poses to prisoners with serious mental \nillness. \n \nInadequate Mental Health Care:  In section IV.B supra, we describe the mental health \ndeficiencies at the Jail.  These deficiencies contribute to the Jail’s use of restrictive housing \nbecause the Jail’s inability to provide adequate mental health treatment, programming, and \nmedication management further exacerbates prisoners’ mental health issues.  The Jail’s lack of \nother resources to manage this population safely results in the Jail resorting to placing prisoners \nin restrictive housing on administrative status. \n \nMarginalized Mental Health Staff:  We heard repeatedly from mental health staff that \nrestrictive housing was harming prisoners at the Jail.  As an alternative, mental health staff have \nproposed the creation of smaller units for those prisoners with serious mental illness, but more \nmental health and security staff would be needed to cover these units, which the Jail currently \ndoes not have.  In addition, mental health staff are not given the support that they need to \neffectively address the mental health needs of prisoners in restrictive housing with serious mental \nillness.  They are not offered a therapeutic environment in which to treat prisoners in restrictive \n30 \n \n\nhousing, instead having to speak to patients through a crack between the metal door and the wall \nor in a multi-purpose room on the unit, without any privacy. \n \nDeficient Security Operations:  As described more fully in section IV.B.3 supra, a lack of \nsecurity staff contributes to the Jail’s inadequate provision of mental health services and its \noverreliance on restrictive housing.  Additionally, due to the lack of security staff to serve as \nescorts, mental health staff are not able to conduct their regular rounds to check on the over 200 \nprisoners in restrictive housing.  Escorting mental health staff to conduct their rounds in \nrestrictive housing is deprioritized by security staff in favor of their other duties, like taking \nprisoners to recreation and ensuring that they all receive showers.  While recreation and prisoner \nhygiene are important, so too is their mental health care, especially for those prisoners in \nrestrictive housing with serious mental illness. \n \nIneffective Oversight:  The Jail does not aggregate or analyze the data it keeps on the \nnumber of prisoners with serious mental illness being held in restrictive housing, nor their length \nof stay there, nor the number of repeated placements there.  This absence of data analysis \nimpedes the Jail’s ability to connect stays in restrictive housing to incidents of harm and mental \nhealth deterioration.  The Jail also does not aggregate or analyze the number of suicide threat or \nself-inflicted injury incidents nor the number of transfers to state psychiatric hospitals to look for \ncorrelations between restrictive housing and these incidents or transfers. \n \nThe unavailability of access to adequate mental health care is especially harmful for \nsuicidal prisoners.  At the Jail, when a prisoner is suicidal, he or she is placed in restrictive \nhousing.  Instead of receiving the constitutionally adequate mental health care required in that \nsituation, such as intensive therapeutic interventions, they receive minimal engagement from \nmental health staff whose interactions are limited and only occur through a crack between the \ncell door and the wall for a few minutes.  Furthermore, Jail staff told us that once prisoners are \nremoved from suicide watch status, they remain in restrictive housing until a classification \ncommittee approves their removal, which can take days.  Below are a few examples: \n \n•  On March 24, 2017, SS, diagnosed by the Jail with bipolar and posttraumatic stress \ndisorders, was released from a restrictive housing cell – eight days after being taken off \nsuicide watch.  Staff at the Jail told us that although she was approved to be released from \nrestrictive housing by mental health staff on March 17, the classification committee did \nnot get the paperwork until March 23, and then it took still another day for her to be \nreleased. \n \n•  On August 1, 2016, NN voiced suicidal ideation in general population due to being \n“depressed about court.”  The Jail responded by placing her on suicide watch in a \nrestrictive housing cell where she remained for 14 days, even though mental health staff \nreported that she had “appropriate,” rather than suicidal, thinking and that she told them \nshe was not suicidal one day after being placed there.  During these 14 days, there were \nno documented mental health interventions or treatment plans to address her mental \ninstability. \n \n31 \n \n\n•  On July 3, 2015, TT gave birth at an outside hospital while a prisoner at the Jail.  In the \nhospital room, she gave the nurse a note that said she felt like harming herself due to \nhaving to leave the baby behind; when she saw that the nurse had given it to the \ncorrections officer, she told the officer, “I don’t want to go behind a door, it’s only going \nto make things worse.”  The officer then responded, “Be careful what you say to me,” \nimplying that the officer would have to place TT on suicide watch if needed.  TT \nresponded, “This is getting to me I’m very depressed.”  When she returned to the Jail, she \nwas placed in a suicide cell and kept in restrictive housing for a week. \n \nJuveniles under the age of 18 with serious mental illness are also held in restrictive \nhousing at the Jail.14  UU was one of those youth.  He was admitted to the Jail on February 19, \n2016, when he was 16 years old, and was diagnosed by the Jail with schizoaffective disorder.  \nSince then, and up until his 18th birthday in March 2017, he spent a total of 185 days in \nrestrictive housing, all on administrative status, in stints of 70, 100, and 15 consecutive days.  \nDuring one stretch where he had been in restrictive housing for 50 consecutive days, he wrote a \nsick call request for “really bad migraines from [his] mental issues” and stated, “I really need \nhelp please.”  Eighteen days later, he again wrote a sick call request for vomiting as a result of \nhis migraine.  A month since his initial request and 81 days into this particular restrictive housing \nstint, he met with the corporate medical director by videoconference.  He reported to the medical \ndirector that he has auditory and visual hallucinations that tell him to hurt people, bring on \nmigraines that make him want to throw up, and make it hard for him to sleep.  According to the \nmedical director’s notes, he also stated, “I’ve been in the hole [restrictive housing] for 3 months \nand I’ve been asking to see someone but I never got to see anyone.”  After this visit, he remained \nin restrictive housing for 19 more consecutive days with mental health notes continuing to report \nthat he was having auditory hallucinations. \n \nStill other prisoners are placed in restrictive housing because they do not feel safe in \ngeneral population, sometimes because of their vulnerability connected to their serious mental \nillness.  One such prisoner, VV, was given a status of “PC-MH,” indicating that her protective \ncustody was mental health related.  She was held in restrictive housing for 75 days between May \nand July 2017.  In 2017, eight prisoners with serious mental illness in protective custody had \nbeen there for more than 200 days, including the following: \n \n•  As of August 2017, WW, diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and labeled by the \nJail as having serious mental illness, had been in restrictive housing under protective \ncustody status for more than two years.  \n \n                                                 \n14 The Jail currently houses juveniles under the age of 18 if they have been charged as adults.  Over the course of our \ninvestigation, there were no special housing accommodations for juveniles who are housed alongside adults.  \nJuveniles were not separated by sight and sound from adult prisoners, in violation of the Prison Rape Elimination \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 15601, et seq.  Recently, we received word that the Jail will begin holding juveniles in a housing \nunit separate from adults.  Because of this, we are not making specific conclusions regarding the treatment of \njuveniles at the Jail.  However, should the Jail not follow through on its plan to house juveniles separate from adults, \nwe may specifically address the treatment of juveniles in the Jail. \n \n32 \n \n\n•  As of June 2017, XX, diagnosed by the Jail with recurrent major depression with \npsychosis, had been in restrictive housing under protective custody status for more than \n400 days. \n \nIn sum, the Jail’s placement of prisoners with serious mental illness in prolonged \nrestrictive housing under current conditions, including the denial of access to adequate medical \nand mental health care, exposes them to a substantial risk of serious harm. \n2.  Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness Have Suffered Serious Harm as a Result of \nthe Jail’s Use of Restrictive Housing Under Current Conditions \n \nPrisoners with serious mental illness at the Jail are subjected not only to a substantial risk \nof serious harm in its restrictive housing cells, but also to actual serious harm following periods \nof restrictive housing.  Of the three prisoners with serious mental illness who committed suicide \nat the Jail since 2015, two committed suicide while in restrictive housing (PP and YY) and \nanother, JJ, had spent 69 of his first 76 days at the Jail in restrictive housing before hanging \nhimself 17 days after being released from restrictive housing.  In 2015, two additional prisoners \nwith serious mental illness died in restrictive housing:  On August 19, 2015, AA, diagnosed with \na history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective and psychotic disorders,  died of heart failure as a \nresult of rapid weight loss after spending his entire 100 days at the Jail in restrictive housing; \nand, on April 7, 2015, EE, who was described by the Jail as “actively psychotic,” died from \ncomplications due to a duodenal ulcer in restrictive housing, where he had been for five days.  In \n2016, a prisoner with serious mental illness, ZZ, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and \ndepression, died one day after the Jail transferred her to a state hospital and after she had spent \nall of her eight-day-stay at the Jail in restrictive housing.  In May 2018, another prisoner, AB, \nwho was 18 years old and diagnosed with schizophrenia, died in restrictive housing.  \n \nOther prisoners have experienced serious mental harm in restrictive housing at the Jail to \nthe point of threatening suicide or inflicting injury on themselves.  In fact, a majority of suicide \nthreats and self-harm incidents occur in the Jail’s restrictive housing cells.  Though \napproximately 15% of the Jail’s total population is housed in one of its restrictive housing cells, \nbetween January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016, more than 65% of the nearly 300 “suicide \nthreat” incidents and more than 60% of the 250 “self-inflicted injury” incidents occurred in a \nrestrictive housing cell.  During the first eight months of 2017, 53% of both the 115 “suicide \nthreat” incidents and the 40 “self-inflicted injury” incidents occurred in a restrictive housing cell, \nincluding the following examples: \n \n•  On August 7, 2017, AC, diagnosed by the Jail with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, \nwas found in her restrictive housing cell trying to reopen wounds on her arms to make \nthem bleed.  She had been on suicide watch there since July 22.  This was her fourth \ndocumented suicide threat or self-inflicted injury incident in two weeks.  Initially, on July \n22 she was placed in restrictive housing on suicide watch for scratching her arm to make \nherself bleed and after telling a jail nurse that she was depressed.  On July 29, she told \nofficers that “the voices in my head are telling me to hurt myself” and explained to a \nmedical staff member that she was feeling this way because today was her son’s birthday, \nshe was raped by her father, and her son was her father’s child.  This incident report \n33 \n \n\nstates that a mental health referral was made after this.  Yet, she remained in a restrictive \nhousing cell and the following day, July 30, she was again found cutting her arms.  She \ntold Jail staff that she was hallucinating and the voices were telling her to harm herself.  \nShe was assessed by medical and placed back in her restrictive housing cell where a week \nlater, on August 7, she was found again trying to reopen the wounds on her arms. \n \n•  On July 30, 2017, AD, diagnosed by the Jail with major depression, tied a string around \nhis neck, threatening suicide while in restrictive housing.  This was his eleventh suicide \nthreat incident since entering the Jail a year earlier.  Each one occurred in restrictive \nhousing.  A suicide threat in December 2016, in which AD tied a sheet around his neck \nand attempted to secure it to a sprinkler head, resulted in an officer deploying pepper \nspray in his cell.  Another suicide threat, in April 2017 was followed by the Jail \npetitioning to have him involuntarily committed to a state psychiatric hospital, where he \nstayed for nine days until returning to the Jail on April 25.  Twelve days later, he was \nplaced back into restrictive housing for a month. \n \n•  On May 2, 2017, AE, diagnosed by the Jail with schizoaffective disorder, was found in \nhis restrictive housing cell lying on his bed nonresponsive with a towel tied around his \nhead covering his eyes.  He told jail staff who found him that he had tried to kill himself \nwith a noose “a few minutes ago but it hurt too much” and that he tried to do it because “I \ncan’t take being in seg no more.”  This was his seventh suicide threat incident since \nFebruary 2017.  Each one occurred in restrictive housing. \n \n•  On February 15, 2017, AF, diagnosed by the Jail with schizoaffective disorder, told \nofficers that he had inserted an ink pen in his arm while in restrictive housing.  When we \nmet AF in March 2017, he told us that he has a history of sticking ink pens in his arms or \nself-inflicting other harm to his body, including banging his head against the walls of his \ncell.  He is known as “hammerhead” at the Jail because he has a large welt on his \nforehead from the years of banging his head on the walls while at the Jail.  He also told us \nhe was doing better because he was no longer in restrictive housing and that it helps him \nto deal with his mental issues when he can talk with a mental health staff person.  Jail \nrecords revealed that he had been in the Jail at least five times since 2012; that the Jail \nhad transferred him three times to a state psychiatric hospital; and that he had spent \nnearly 800 of his nearly 1100 days in the Jail in restrictive housing. \n \n•  On January 10, 2017, LL, diagnosed by the Jail with bipolar disorder, threatened to kill \nhimself while in restrictive housing after tying a sheet around his face, standing on his \ntoilet, and then attempting to break the sprinkler head.  After LL failed to heed a jail \nofficer’s order to stop, the officer deployed pepper spray into his cell.  A nursing note \nrecorded that he was “seen in cell after being sprayed with OC spray face down on the \nfloor kicking and screaming [that] he was going to kill himself.”  He had been in the Jail \nsince November 15, 2016 and in restrictive housing for all but nine of those days.  On \nDecember 22, 2016, a mental health staff member recommended that he be removed \nfrom restrictive housing, and he was removed, six days later on December 28th.  Then on \nJanuary 3, 2017, he was again placed in restrictive housing under a “mental deficient” \nclassification.  Then a week later, on January 10, he threatened to kill himself.   \n34 \n \n\n \nAnother indicator of a prisoner’s mental health deteriorating is when the Jail transfers a \nprisoner to a state psychiatric hospital to receive a higher level of mental health treatment.  These \ntransfers indicate that a prisoner’s mental health has gotten so bad that the Jail is not capable of \nproviding the needed care.  In 2016, there were 169 transfers from the Jail to a state psychiatric \nhospital.  Of those prisoners transferred, more than 60% were housed in restrictive housing \nimmediately prior to being transferred.  More than half of those prisoners had been in restrictive \nhousing for more than 30 consecutive days.  Similarly, during the first eight months of 2017, \n55% of the 133 transfers were of prisoners who were in restrictive housing immediately prior to \nbeing transferred and nearly half of those prisoners had spent 30 consecutive days or more in \nrestrictive housing immediately prior to being transferred.  Below are a few examples: \n \n•  On February 7, 2017, AG, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was transferred directly from \nrestrictive housing to a state psychiatric hospital, after swallowing a sharp object.  This \nwas the second time in a month that he was transferred directly from restrictive housing \nto a state psychiatric hospital.  Between August 9, 2016 and January 5, 2017, he was \nheld in restrictive housing under a “mental deficient” classification.  During that time, he \nswallowed harmful objects five different times, and was generally observed to have a \n“significant history of self-mutilation and suicidal ideation.”  On January 5, 2017, the \nJail transferred him to a state psychiatric hospital.  When he returned from the state \npsychiatric hospital on January 19, 2017, he was again placed in restrictive housing.  \nWhen he returned from the state psychiatric hospital on February 27, 2017, he was \nimmediately placed on suicide watch in restrictive housing. \n \n•  On November 10, 2016, AH, diagnosed by the Jail with schizophrenia and \nschizoaffective disorder, was transferred from the Jail to a state psychiatric hospital for \nthe second time in less than five months.  She spent her entire time at the Jail in \nrestrictive housing.  When first admitted to the Jail on June 22, 2016, she expressed \nhomicidal tendencies, stating that she was not on her medication, feared for her life, and \n“would like to be placed in solitary.”  She was placed in restrictive housing that day \nbecause mental health staff recommended it pending further evaluation.  In the days that \nfollowed, she was observed by mental health staff to be “agitated” and “would not \nengage” during cell-side rounds in restrictive housing.  Three days later, on June 29, \n2016, the Jail’s records show that a mental health assessment was no longer needed \nbecause the Jail had assessed her in April 2016 on a previous admission.  During the \nfollowing 10 days, she refused to let the Jail take her vital signs, and reportedly was seen \nthrowing her cup “in an aggressive manner” at the cell window.  Five days later, on July \n14, 2016, and 22 days after being placed in restrictive housing, AH was transferred to a \nstate psychiatric hospital for more than a month. The hospital discharged her to the Jail, \nstating that she was competent and should “follow up with [a community mental health] \ntreatment plan.”  When back from the state hospital, in the Jail’s intake area, AH began \nthrowing shoes and other belongings at officers and was subsequently placed into \nrestrictive housing for “erratic behavior” pending a mental health evaluation, where she \nstayed for the next two months, until she was again transferred back to the state \npsychiatric hospital. \n \n35 \n \n\n•  On June 1, 2016, AI, who has a history of mental health issues and taking antipsychotic \nmedications, was transferred from the Jail to a state psychiatric hospital directly from \nrestrictive housing.  This was the fourth time in less than 10 years that the Jail had \ntransferred him to a state psychiatric hospital.  Since 2007, he has spent more than 600 \ndays at the Jail and at least 155 days at the state hospital, stemming from four arrests, all \non trespassing charges. \n \nMoreover, prisoners waiting for transfer to a state psychiatric hospital are often kept in \nrestrictive housing, resulting in further mental health deterioration.  As described in section III, \nAA died in restrictive housing in August 2015 while waiting to be transferred to a state \npsychiatric hospital.  More recently on April 4, 2017, AJ was transferred to a state psychiatric \nhospital 35 days after a judge’s February 28th Order that AJ be transferred to a higher level of \ncare.  AJ was held in restrictive housing for 28 of those 35 days, but prior to the judge’s order he \nhad already been in restrictive housing since December 30, 2016.  This means AJ was held in \nrestrictive housing for 88 of the 95 days before being sent to a state hospital.  In January 2017, he \nwas observed “slapping and punching” himself and showing signs of “psychotic thinking,” \naccording to a mental health professional.  By mid-March, another mental health professional \nnoted “paranoid delusional statements” made by AJ, further noting that medications for AJ had \nbeen discontinued months prior as a result of his multiple treatment refusals.  Collectively, these \nexamples demonstrate that the Jail’s restrictive housing practices contribute to inadequate \nmedical care. \n3.  Officials at the Jail Knew of the Substantial Risk of Serious Harm and \nDisregarded It \n \nThe death of AA in August 2015 put Jail officials on notice of some of the risks that \nprolonged restrictive housing posed to prisoners with serious mental illness, such as further \nmental health deterioration and rapid weight loss, as described in section III supra.  See Hope, \n536 U.S. at 738-35 (disregarding an obvious risk to prisoner health and safety shows deliberate \nindifference); see also Palakovic, 854 F.3d at 226 (finding that it is an “obvious reality that \nextended stays in solitary confinement can cause serious damage to mental health”).  Yet, the Jail \nhas failed to take steps to eliminate these and other inadequacies, evincing deliberate indifference \nto prisoner health and safety.  The Jail continues to place prisoners with serious mental illness in \nrestrictive housing under current conditions with tragic consequences, like those suffered by YY \nand JJ in 2017.  See IV.C.2 supra.  These deaths, coupled with the Jail’s failure to analyze the \ndata it keeps on the length of time prisoners with serious mental illness spend in restrictive \nhousing, indicate that the Jail knows of the risks and has failed to address them. \n \nD.  The Jail’s Use of Restrictive Housing on Prisoners with Mental Health Disabilities \nViolates the Americans with Disabilities Act \n \nBy placing prisoners with mental health disabilities (i.e., mental illness) in restrictive \nhousing because of their disability when they would otherwise be qualified to be in non-\nrestrictive housing (e.g., general population, mental health unit), the Jail violates Title II of the \nADA.  The Jail places some prisoners who have been examined by mental health staff and have \ndifficulty interacting with others due to limited comprehension and communication skills in \n36 \n \n\nrestrictive housing on a status of “Administrative Restriction – Mentally Deficient.”  These \nprisoners have a qualifying disability and are placed in restrictive housing by reason of their \ndisability in violation of the ADA.  See Latson, 249 F. Supp. 3d at 856-57 (denying a motion to \ndismiss a prisoner’s ADA claim that prison officials discriminated against him on the basis of his \nmental health disabilities by placing him in restrictive housing for symptoms of his disabilities \nwithout a reasonable modification, and by denying him access to benefits while in restrictive \nhousing). \n \nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.15  To establish a Title II claim, one “must allege that (1) [he] has a \ndisability, (2) [he] is otherwise qualified to receive the benefits of a public service, program, or \nactivity, and (3) [he] was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of such service, \nprogram, or activity, or otherwise discriminated against, on the basis of [his] \ndisability.”  Constantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 411 F.3d 474, 498 (4th \nCir. 2005); see also Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209-10 (1998) (applying Title II \nin the prison context).  The ADA offers the same protections to prisoners with disabilities \nwhether those disabilities stem from physical or mental impairments.  42 U.S.C. § 12102.  Thus, \nprisoners at the Jail with mental illness are entitled to this protection. \n \nThe Jail places prisoners with mental health disabilities in restrictive housing on a status \nof “Administrative Restriction – Mentally Deficient” by reason of their disability.  Such \nprisoners are placed in restrictive housing due to a decision by a classification officer to allow \nmental deficiencies to determine their custody status.  Placing a prisoner in restrictive housing on \nAdministrative Restriction – Mentally Deficient is different than placing a prisoner in restrictive \nhousing on Disciplinary Restriction.  Prisoners on Disciplinary Restriction are placed on this \nstatus after being found guilty in a hearing of a rule violation and may not be held in restrictive \nhousing for more than 60 days.  Prisoners on Administrative Restriction – Mentally Deficient are \nnot given due process rights, and there is no limit to how long they may be held in restrictive \nhousing on this status. \n \nThe Jail does not place every prisoner with mental illness in restrictive housing.  \nMoreover, the Jail places some prisoners with mental illness in restrictive housing for reasons \nother than their disability, such as for Disciplinary Restriction.  Such placements for reasons \nother than the prisoner’s disability do not typically violate the ADA.  But the Jail violates the \nADA when it places prisoners with a mental illness disability in restrictive housing on \nAdministrative Restriction – Mentally Deficient because such placements are because of the \nprisoners’ disability.   \n                                                 \n15 Public entities are not required “to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from its services, programs, or \nactivities . . . when that individual poses a direct threat to the safety of others.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.139.  A direct threat \nis “a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, \npractices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  The Jail cannot avail \nitself of the direct threat defense because it is placing prisoners in restrictive housing due to their mental deficiency \ncategorization, rather than conducting “an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgement” with \nconsideration of whether reasonable modifications would “mitigate the risk.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.139(b). \n \n37 \n \n\n \nPrisoners with mental illness who are being held in restrictive housing on an \nadministrative status of “mentally deficient” are otherwise qualified to be housed in non-\nrestrictive housing and are being placed on this administrative status because of their disability.  \nThe Jail’s policy provides that the custody status of “mentally deficient” is a sufficient reason to \nplace prisoners in restrictive housing, and these prisoners are held in restrictive housing due to \nthe Jail’s classification officer’s decision to allow mental deficiencies to determine their custody \nstatus.  During the first eight months of 2017, 54 prisoners were held in restrictive housing on the \nsole basis of “Administrative Restriction – Mentally Deficient.”  Because there is no disciplinary \nor other reason given for holding these prisoners in restrictive housing, they are otherwise \nqualified. \n \nAlso, prisoners with mental illness who are placed in restrictive housing on the basis of \ntheir disability are excluded from structured and unstructured programs and benefits offered to \nprisoners not in restrictive housing, such as confidential mental health treatment, group mental \nhealth treatment, GED or life skills classes, parenting and anger management programs, and re-\nentry classes, as well as interacting with other prisoners in a common space during meals or day-\nroom time. \n \nTo avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, jail officials must “make reasonable \nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures.”16  For example, the Jail could provide more \ncomprehensive mental health training for correctional officers, more mental health treatment \nhousing alternatives, or better mental health treatment and strategies to help those prisoners \ndeemed “mentally deficient” rather than placing them in restrictive housing because of their \ndisabilities.  See Brown v. Washington Dep't of Corr., No. C13-5367, 2015 WL 4039322, at *11 \n(W.D. Wash. May 13, 2015), report and recommendation adopted, No. C13-05367, 2015 WL \n4039270 (W.D. Wash. July 2, 2015) (finding that placing a prisoner in a restraint chair for \nbehavior that is related to his mental illness rather than “accommodating [his] mental illness with \nappropriate treatment” may indicate a “discriminatory response”). \n                                                 \n16 The ADA’s obligation to make “reasonable modification in policies, practices, or procedures” is not limitless.  A \nmodification is not required if it would “fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  The requested modification here would not “fundamentally alter” the Jails programs.  The \nJail already offers some services tailored toward prisoners with mental illness:  it offers some mental health training \nfor correctional officers, some mental health treatment to prisoners, and some mental health units.  In addition, the \nJail may “impose legitimate safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of its services, programs, or \nactivities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(h).  However, those requirements must “be based on actual risks, not on mere \nspeculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.”  Id.  Thus, the Jail could provide \nlegitimate safety requirements for holding a prisoner with mental illness in restrictive housing as long as it was not \nbased on speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities.  \n38 \n \n\n \n \nV.   MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \n \n \n  To remedy the constitutional and statutory violations identified in this Notice, we \nrecommend that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority implement, at minimum, the \nremedial measures listed below.  In listing these remedies, we note that over the course of our \ninvestigation, the Jail has been making changes to its personnel, policies, and procedures, to \naddress some of the violations identified in our Notice. \n \nA.  Medical Care \n \nThe Jail should: \n \n1.  Revise its policies, procedures, and practices relating to intake, chronic care, continuity of \ncare, sick call, access to medical care by those in restrictive housing, medical grievances, \nmedication refusals, and quality assurance, to ensure that prisoners receive adequate \nmedical care. \n \n2.  Increase medical staffing by hiring sufficient additional staff with appropriate credentials \n(e.g., MDs, RNs, and LPNs) and increasing the hours that current staff with higher \ncredentials are onsite on evenings and weekends to ensure that prisoners receive adequate \nmedical care. \n \n3.  Increase security staffing to ensure that there are sufficient staff to escort medical staff \nduring pill pass and during any visits to prisoners in restrictive housing, escort prisoners \nto the medical clinics for their appointments, transport prisoners to outside medical \nappointments, and maintain security watch over hospitalized prisoners. \n \n4.  Ensure that adequate intake screening and health assessments are provided. \n \n5.  Ensure that trained medical care providers review on a daily basis the medical screening \ninformation in order to provide prisoners timely access to a physician as is clinically \nappropriate. \n \n6.  Ensure that prisoners’ acute and chronic health needs are identified in order to provide \nadequate medical care. \n \n7.  Ensure that prisoners with chronic conditions are routinely seen by a physician as \nclinically appropriate, to evaluate the status of their health and the effectiveness of the \nmedication administered for their chronic conditions. \n \n8.  Ensure that the medical request process for prisoners provides them with adequate access \nto medical care.  This process should include logging, tracking, and timely responses by \nmedical staff as clinically appropriate, and should include regular audits by Jail staff to \nensure compliance with this process. \n39 \n \n\n \n9.  Ensure that medical and sick call requests are appropriately triaged based upon the \nseriousness of the medical issue.  Ensure that medical requests submitted in the form of a \ngrievance or through another mechanism are appropriately triaged, even if submitted \nthrough improper channels. \n \n10. Provide for physician oversight, including periodic review, of sick call, with nursing \nprotocols and clinical assessment forms that guide the nurses performing sick call. \n \n11. Ensure that prisoners are provided with diagnoses for identified medical problems and \nthat appropriate treatment plans are developed. \n \n12. Provide timely medical appointments, including appointments and hospitalizations \noutside of the facility. \n \n13. Ensure that prisoners receive treatment that adequately addresses their serious medical \nneeds in a timely and appropriate manner. \n \n14. Ensure that all corrections officers, medical, and mental health staff receive adequate pre-\nservice and annual in-service training on first-responder medical care, mental health and \nsuicide prevention. \n \n15. Conduct timely and adequate multidisciplinary morbidity-mortality reviews for all \nprisoner deaths, including suicides and serious suicide attempts (i.e., suicide attempts \nrequiring hospitalization).  Ensure the senior Jail staff have access to all such reviews \nconducted by the Jail’s medical or mental health provider. \n \n16. Ensure that the Jail’s quality assurance program is adequately maintained and identifies \nand corrects deficiencies with the medical care system. \n \nB.  Mental Health Care \n \nThe Jail should: \n \n1.  Ensure that all initial screenings are performed by staff who are trained to identify mental \nhealth issues and that appropriate care is taken to accurately record a prisoner’s current \nmedications. \n \n2.  Ensure that comprehensive health assessments of all prisoners are conducted within 14 \ndays of their arrival, with a psychiatrist conducting the screening or overseeing RNs who \nconduct the screening. \n \n3.  Provide immediate treatment to prisoners who are suicidal or psychotic, as soon as those \nconditions are known to the Jail.  Ensure timely access to mental health professionals \nwhen the prisoner is presenting symptoms requiring mental health care. \n \n40 \n \n\n4.  Ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to obtain a prisoner’s prior mental health \nrecords from prior jail admissions and from community services boards or other \ncommunity providers.  Ensure that this information is incorporated into prisoners’ \nmedical charts. \n \n5.  Develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure prisoners with serious mental \nhealth needs receive timely treatment as clinically appropriate, in a clinically appropriate \nsetting. \n \n6.  Ensure that appropriate, detailed treatment plans are developed for prisoners with mental \nhealth needs and implement procedures whereby treatment plans are regularly reviewed \nto ensure they are being followed. \n \n7.  Ensure that all prisoners with serious mental health needs receive regular, consistent \ntherapy and counseling, in group and individual settings, as clinically appropriate. \n \n8.  Ensure an inpatient level of care is available to all prisoners who need it, including \nregular, consistent therapy and counseling, as clinically appropriate. \n \n9.  Ensure that conversations between mental health professionals and prisoners can be \nconducted in a confidential setting to allow for effective information sharing and \ntreatment. \n \n10. Provide adequate psychiatry coverage and psychiatry support staff in order to timely \naddress prisoners’ serious mental health needs. \n \n11. Ensure that the psychiatrist conducts follow-up assessments, as clinically appropriate, \nwith prisoners on any new psychotropic medications or change in medication dosage. \n \n12. Ensure that psychotropic medications are ordered in a timely manner, are accurately \ndelivered to prisoners on lockdown status, and are administered to prisoners in the correct \ndosages.   \n \n13. Ensure that medication administration records are regularly audited by Jail staff for \ncompleteness and accuracy.  \n \n14. Ensure that suicidal prisoners receive the level of care and housing classification \nappropriate to their acuity, as determined by a mental health professional. \n \n15. Ensure that suicidal prisoners receive adequate mental health treatment and follow-up \ncare, including out-of-cell counseling as determined by a mental health professional. \n \n16. Clarify that an order of “constant watch” observation requires that a staff member have \nan unobstructed view of the prisoner at all times.  Video surveillance is not sufficient for \na prisoner on “constant watch.”  Also, ensure that any staff member conducting “constant \n41 \n \n\nwatch” observation has no other duties to complete during the time they are conducting \nthe watch. \n \n17. Provide quality, private suicide risk assessments of suicidal prisoners on a daily basis. \n \n18. Ensure that the Jail’s quality assurance program is adequately maintained and identify \nand correct deficiencies with the mental health care system. \n \n19. Provide discharge/transfer planning, including services for prisoners in need of further \ntreatment at the time of transfer to another institution or discharge to the community.  \nThese services should include the following: \n \na.  Arranging an appointment with community mental health providers for all \nprisoners with serious mental illness and ensuring, to the extent possible, that \nprisoners meet with that community mental health provider prior to or at the time \nof discharge to facilitate a warm hand off; \n \nb.  Providing referrals for prisoners with mental health problems that require ongoing \ntreatment post-release; \n \nc.  Notifying reception centers at state prisons when mentally ill prisoners are going \nto arrive; \n \nd.  Arranging with local pharmacies to have prisoners’ prescriptions renewed to \nensure that they have an adequate supply to last through their next scheduled \nappointment. \n \nC.  Restrictive Housing \n \nThe Jail should: \n \n1.  Ensure that its policies, procedures, and practices regarding the use of restrictive housing \nfor prisoners with serious mental illness comport with the Constitution. \n \n2.  Ensure that if a prisoner shows credible signs of decompensation in restrictive housing, \nthe prisoner’s mental health needs are assessed by a mental health professional and \npromptly addressed. \n \n3.  Ensure that prisoners expressing suicidality are not placed in restrictive housing and \ninstead are provided clinically appropriate mental health care. \n \n4.  Report and review data regarding lengths of stay in restrictive housing, particularly with \nrespect to prisoners with serious mental illness, and take appropriate corrective action. \n \n42 \n \n\nD.  Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act \n \nThe Jail should: \n \n1.  Ensure that its policies, procedures, and practices are reasonably modified and \nmaintained so that prisoners with mental illness are not unnecessarily placed in restrictive \nhousing based on their disabilities. \n \n2.  Ensure that prisoners with mental illness who are in restrictive housing have the \nopportunity to participate in and benefit from services, programs, and activities available \nto prisoners without disabilities consistent with significant health or safety concerns. \n \n \nVI.   CONCLUSION \n \n \n  We have reasonable cause to believe that the Jail has engaged in a pattern or practice of \nresistance to rights protected by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it fails to \nprovide prisoners with constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care and places \nprisoners with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time under \nconditions that violate prisoners’ constitutional rights.  We also have reasonable cause to believe \nthat the Jail violates the ADA by placing prisoners with mental illness in restrictive housing \nbecause of their disability and failing to provide reasonable accommodations.  We look forward \nto working cooperatively with the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority and the Jail’s \nadministrators and staff to ensure that these violations are remedied. \n \n \n \n43 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  This matter involves the medical and mental health care that the Hampton Roads Regional \nJail Authority (“HRRJ” or “Jail” or “Regional Jail”) provides to prisoners, HRRJ’s use of \nrestrictive housing for prisoners with serious mental illness (“SMI”), and HRRJ’s provision of \nservices, programs, and activities to prisoners with mental health disabilities. \n2.  In 2016, the United States initiated an investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131.  The investigation focused on HRRJ’s provision of \nmedical and mental health care, its use of restrictive housing for prisoners who had mental \nillnesses, and its provision of access to services, programs, and activities to prisoners with mental \nhealth disabilities. \n3.  On December 19, 2018, the United States issued a CRIPA Notice to HRRJ, concluding \nthat there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions at HRRJ violate the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution through HRRJ’s failure to provide adequate medical and \nmental health care to prisoners and its placement of prisoners with serious mental illness in \nrestrictive housing for prolonged periods of time.  The United  States concluded that these \nviolations are pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights protected \nby the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The United States also determined there is reasonable \ncause to believe that HRRJ violates the ADA by denying prisoners with mental health disabilities \naccess to services, programs, and activities because of their disabilities. \n4.  HRRJ and the United States (“the Parties”) are committed to remedying the conditions \nidentified in the CRIPA Notice and achieving compliance with Title II of the ADA.  The purpose \nof this Agreement is to ensure the conditions at HRRJ respect the rights of prisoners confined \nthere.  By ensuring that the conditions at HRRJ meet the Jail’s constitutional and statutory \nrequirements, HRRJ will also provide for greater staff safety and promote public safety in the \ncommunities it serves.  This Agreement has the following goals: (1) ensure that appropriate \nmedical and mental health care are provided to prisoners at HRRJ; (2) ensure that restrictive \nhousing is used appropriately with respect to prisoners with serious mental illnesses; and (3) ensure \nthat prisoners with mental health disabilities are given non-discriminatory access to the Jail’s \nservices, programs, and activities.   \n5.  In order to resolve the issues pending between the Parties without the expense, risks, \ndelays, and uncertainties of litigation, the Parties agree to the terms of this Agreement as stated \nbelow.  This Agreement resolves the United States’ investigation of HRRJ’s alleged constitutional \nand ADA violations.  The Parties agree that this Agreement does not constitute an admission by \nHampton Roads Regional Jail Authority of the truth of any of the conclusions contained in the \nUnited States’ December 19, 2018 CRIPA Notice. \n6.  The Parties stipulate that this Agreement complies in all respects with the Prison Litigation \nReform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).  The Parties stipulate that the requirements of this Agreement \nare narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the violations of federal rights as \nalleged by the United States in its Complaint and CRIPA Notice, are the least intrusive means \nnecessary to correct these alleged violations, and will not have an adverse impact on public safety \nor the operation of a criminal justice system.  The Parties further stipulate that this Agreement is \nstructured  to  ensure  that  it  terminates  upon  HRRJ’s  showing  that  it  has  achieved  durable \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 4 of 32 PageID# 18\ncompliance and the injuries caused by the alleged violations identified in the CRIPA Notice have \nbeen fully remedied. \n7.  This Agreement is enforceable only by the Parties.  No person or entity is intended to be a \nthird-party beneficiary of the provisions of this Agreement for purposes of any civil, criminal, or \nadministrative action.

Mental Health Units:  \na.  Mental health units function similar to a general population unit in which \nprisoners are out of their cells the majority of the day.  \nb.  There may be multiple mental health units, each serving a different sub-\npopulation of prisoners depending on the level of mental health acuity (e.g., \nstep-down from inpatient psychiatric hospitalization or suicide watch, active \npsychosis but not a threat to themselves or others, etc.). \nc.  Mental health units will have dedicated mental health staffing in accordance \nwith the staffing plan described at Paragraph 24 to provide dedicated mental \nhealth programming available to all prisoners in these units. \n103.  Secure Mental Health Units:  Secure mental health units are dedicated to providing the \nnecessary mental health services and other accommodations needed by prisoners with \nSMI who have been identified as having engaged in violent acts and who require \nadditional security staff/measures. \na.  Prisoners who are placed in a secure mental health unit will be offered a \nminimum of: \n1.  at least 10 hours of structured out-of-cell activities each week, with two \nof the 10 scheduled hours used for individual or group therapeutic \ntreatment sessions Monday through Friday, with each session lasting \napproximately one hour and detailed in that prisoner’s individualized \ntreatment plan.  At least one hour of structured out-of-cell activity will \noccur on Saturdays, and \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 19 of 32 PageID# 33\n2.  at least two hours of unstructured out-of-cell recreation with other \nprisoners  each  day,  including  exercise,  dining,  and  other  leisure \nactivities that provide opportunities for socializing, for a total of 14 \nhours per week.

The report shall also summarize audits and continuous improvement and quality \nassurance activities, and contain findings and recommendations that would be used to track and \nidentify data trends. \n141.  Monitor Reports \n142.  Within 60 days of the Effective Date, the Monitor will conduct a baseline site visit \nof HRRJ to become familiar with HRRJ and this Agreement.   \n143.  Within  90  days  of  the  Effective  Date,  the  Monitor  will  provide  his  or  her \npreliminary observations and recommendations in a baseline Monitoring Report \n(which will follow the same draft and comment process as in Paragraph 144). \n144.  The Monitor will conduct an on-site inspection and issue a Monitoring Report for \nHRRJ six months after the baseline Monitoring Report, and then every six months \nthereafter.  A draft Report will be provided to HRRJ and the United States in draft \nform for comment at least 30 days prior to its issuance.  HRRJ and the United States \nwill provide comments, if any, to the Monitor within 15 days of receipt of the draft \nReport. The Monitor will consider the responses of HRRJ and the United States \nand make appropriate changes, if any, before issuing the final Report. \n145.  The Monitoring Reports will describe the steps taken by HRRJ to implement this \nAgreement and evaluate the extent to which HRRJ prisons have complied with each \nsubstantive provision of the Agreement.  Each Monitoring Report: \na.  Will evaluate the status of compliance for each relevant provision of the \nAgreement using the following standards: (1) Substantial Compliance; (2) \nPartial Compliance; and (3) Non-compliance.  “Substantial Compliance” \nindicates that HRRJ has achieved material compliance with the components \nof the relevant provision of the Agreement.  “Partial Compliance” indicates \nthat HRRJ has achieved material compliance with some of the components of \nthe relevant provision of the Agreement, but significant work remains.  “Non-\ncompliance” indicates that HRRJ has not met the components of the relevant \nprovision of the Agreement.  “Material Compliance” requires that, for each \nprovision, HRRJ has developed and implemented a policy incorporating the \nrequirement, trained relevant personnel on the policy, and relevant personnel \nare complying with the requirement in actual practice.  The Monitor will \nreview a sufficient number of pertinent documents and interview a sufficient \nnumber of staff and prisoners to accurately assess current conditions; \nb.  Will describe the steps taken by each member of the monitoring team to \nanalyze conditions and assess compliance, including documents reviewed and \nindividuals interviewed, and the factual basis for each of the Monitor’s \nfindings; \nc.  Will contain the Monitor’s independent verification of representations from \nHRRJ regarding progress toward compliance, and examination of supporting \ndocumentation; and \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 27 of 32 PageID# 41\nd.  Will provide recommendations for each of the provisions in the Agreement \noutlining proposed actions for at least the next six months for HRRJ to \ncomplete toward achieving compliance with the particular provision. \n146.  These Monitoring Reports will be filed with the Court and will be written with due \nregard for the privacy interests of individuals and will not include any information \nthat could jeopardize the institutional security of HRRJ, or safety of HRRJ staff or \nprisoners.    The  Monitoring  Reports  provide  relevant  evidence  regarding \ncompliance.  The Court determines the facts regarding compliance and the status \nof compliance pursuant to Sections VI and VII of the Agreement.  \n147.  Nothing in this Section prohibits the Monitor from issuing interim letters or reports \nto the United States, HRRJ or the Court in this case should s/he deem it necessary. \n148.  If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Parties agree that any \nsubstantive section (i.e. any small capitalized section tabbed on the far left of the \nAgreement,  such  as  “SECURITY,”  “MEDICAL  AND  MENTAL  HEALTH  CARE,” \n“MEDICAL CARE,” etc.) has reached Substantial Compliance, that section will cease \nto be subject to active monitoring. \n149.  In  completing  his  or  her  responsibilities,  the  Monitor  may  testify  in  enforcement \nproceedings regarding any matter relating to the implementation, enforcement, or dissolution of \nthe  Agreement,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  Monitor’s  observations,  findings,  and \nrecommendations in this matter.  \n150.  The Monitor, and any staff or consultants retained by the Monitor, will not: (a) be liable \nfor any claim, lawsuit, or demand arising out of their activities under this Agreement (this \nparagraph does not apply to any proceeding for payment under contracts into which they have \nentered in connection with their work under the Agreement); (b) be subject to formal discovery in \nany litigation involving the services or provisions reviewed in this Agreement, including, but not \nlimited to, deposition(s), request(s) for documents, and request(s) for admissions, interrogatories, \nor other disclosure; (c) testify in any other litigation or proceeding with regard to any act or \nomission  of  HRRJ  or  any  of  HRRJ’s  agents,  representatives,  or  employees  related  to  this \nAgreement, nor testify regarding any matter or subject that he or she may have learned as a result \nof his or her performance under this Agreement, nor serve as a non-testifying expert regarding any \nmatter or subject that he or she may have learned as a result of his or her performance under this \nAgreement. \n151.  The Monitor will not enter into any additional contract with HRRJ while serving as the \nMonitor.  If the Monitor resigns from his or her position as Monitor, the former Monitor may not \nenter any contract with HRRJ or the United States on a matter related to this Agreement without \nthe written consent of the other Party while this Agreement remains in effect.  HRRJ will not \notherwise employ, retain, or be affiliated with the Monitor, or professionals retained by the \nMonitor while this Agreement is in effect, and for a period of at least one year from the date this \nAgreement terminates, unless the United States gives its written consent to waive this prohibition. \nV.   IMPLEMENTATION \n152.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date, HRRJ will designate an Agreement Coordinator to \ncoordinate compliance with this Agreement and to serve as a point of contact for the Parties and \nthe Monitor.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 28 of 32 PageID# 42\n153.  Early  on  and  throughout  the  planning  and  implementation  process,  HRRJ  will,  as \nappropriate, engage with stakeholders including those types of entities involved in their Forensic \nAdvisory Team (e.g., Community Services Boards and Mental Health Courts) to identify their \ngoals, concerns, and recommendations regarding implementation of this Agreement. \n154.  HRRJ will create an annual Implementation Plan that describes the actions it will take to \nfulfill its obligations under this Agreement.  Implementation of this Agreement will be completed \nin phases as outlined in the Agreement and the Implementation Plan.   \n155.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date, HRRJ will provide the first Implementation Plan \n(“Implementation Plan #1”) to the United States and the Monitor.  In its Implementation Plan, \nHRRJ will develop a specific schedule and deadlines for the upcoming year and a general schedule \nfor successive years.  In Implementation Plan #1, HRRJ will develop a specific schedule and \ndeadlines for the first twelve months, in which HRRJ will: (a) draft or revise policies and \nprocedures; (b) complete a staffing plan, (c) develop and deliver training to HRRJ staff and \nproviders concerning the provisions of this Agreement and HRRJ’s commitment to fulfilling its \nobligations  under  the  Constitution  and  the  ADA;  (d)  develop  and  implement  a  Quality \nImprovement Committee; (e) and develop and implement monthly quality assurance mechanisms \nto report on aggregate relevant data to prevent or minimize harm to prisoners. \n156.  The United States and the Monitor will provide comments regarding Implementation Plan \n#1 (and any further Implementation Plans) within 30 days of receipt.  HRRJ will timely revise its \nImplementation Plans to address comments from the United States and the Monitor; the Parties \nand the Monitor will meet and consult as necessary.   \n157.  Annually, HRRJ, in conjunction with the United States and the Monitor, will supplement  \nImplementation Plan #1 with further Implementation Plans (#2, #3, etc.) to focus on and provide \nadditional  detail  regarding  implementation  activities.    HRRJ  will  address  in  its  further \nImplementation Plans any areas of non-compliance or other recommendations identified by the \nMonitor in his or her reports. \nVI.  ENFORCEMENT \n158.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia will retain jurisdiction \nover this matter for the purposes of enforcing this Agreement as an order of this Court. \n159.  During the period that the Agreement is in force, if the United States determines that HRRJ \nhas not made material progress toward substantial compliance with a significant obligation under \nthe Agreement, and such failure constitutes a violation of prisoners’ constitutional rights, the \nUnited States may initiate enforcement proceedings against HRRJ in Court for an alleged failure \nto fulfill its obligation under this Agreement. \n160.  Prior to taking judicial action to initiate enforcement proceedings, the United States will \ngive HRRJ written notice of its intent to initiate such proceedings, and the parties will engage in \ngood-faith discussions to resolve the dispute. \n161.  HRRJ will have 30 days from the date of such notice to cure the failure or otherwise resolve \nthe dispute through the good-faith discussions.  The Parties may agree to extend this time, as \nreasonable, due to the nature of the issue(s).  At the end of the 30-day period (or such additional \ntime as is reasonable due to the nature of the issue(s) and agreed upon by the United States), in the \nevent that the United States determines that the failure has not been cured or that adequate remedial \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 29 of 32 PageID# 43\nmeasures have not occurred, the United States may initiate contempt proceedings.  The United \nStates commits to work in good faith with HRRJ to avoid enforcement actions. \n162.  In case of an emergency posing an immediate threat to the health or safety of any prisoner \nor staff member at HRRJ, however, the United States may omit the notice and cure requirements \nherein and seek enforcement of the Agreement. \nVII.  TERMINATION \n163.  Except where otherwise agreed to under a specific provision of this Agreement, HRRJ will \nimplement all provisions of this Agreement within 4 years of the Effective Date.   \n164.  This Agreement will terminate in five years, or earlier, if the Parties agree that HRRJ has \nattained  substantial  compliance  with  all  provisions  of  this  Agreement  and  maintained  that \ncompliance for a period of one year, or as outlined in Paragraph 167, by order of the Court.  \n165.  HRRJ may seek termination of any substantive section (i.e. any small capitalized section \ntabbed on the far left of the Agreement, such as “SECURITY,” “MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH \nCARE,” “MEDICAL CARE,” etc.) by filing with the Court a motion to terminate that section.  The \nburden will be on the Jail to demonstrate that it has attained and maintained its substantial \ncompliance as to that section for at least one year.  \n166.  Regardless of this Agreement’s specific requirements, this Agreement will terminate, or \nsubstantive sections as described in Paragraph 165 may terminate, upon a showing by the Jail that \nit has come into durable compliance with the requirements of the Constitution and the ADA that \ngave rise to this Agreement.  In order to demonstrate durable compliance, HRRJ must establish \nwith the Court that it is operating in accordance with these requirements and has been doing so \ncontinuously for one year. \n167.  The burden will be on HRRJ to demonstrate that it has maintained substantial compliance \nwith each of the provisions of this Agreement.  Non-compliance with mere technicalities, or \ntemporary failure to comply during a period of otherwise sustained compliance, will not constitute \nfailure by HRRJ to maintain substantial compliance.  At the same time, temporary compliance \nduring a period of sustained non-compliance will not constitute substantial compliance. \n168.  The burden will be on HRRJ to demonstrate they have achieved substantial compliance \nwith a particular section of this Agreement. \n169.  Should any provision of this Agreement be declared or determined by any court to be \nillegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining parts, terms, or provisions will not \nbe affected.  The Parties will not, individually or in combination with another, seek to have any \ncourt declare or determine that any provision of this Agreement is invalid. \n170.  The Parties agree to work collaboratively to achieve the purpose of this Agreement.  In the \nevent of any dispute over the language, requirements or construction of this Agreement, the Parties \nagree to meet and confer in an effort to achieve a mutually agreeable resolution.   \n171.  This Agreement will constitute the entire integrated agreement of the Parties.  \n172.  Any modification of this Agreement will be executed in writing by the Parties, will be filed \nwith the Court, and will not be effective until the Court enters the modified agreement and retains \njurisdiction to enforce it.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 30 of 32 PageID# 44\nVIII.  GENERAL PROVISIONS \n173.  If necessary, HRRJ will coordinate with or enter into Memoranda of Understanding with \nall appropriate State, County, or City agencies in order for HRRJ to comply with provisions of this \nAgreement.  \n174.  The United States and HRRJ will each bear the cost of their own fees and expenses incurred \nin connection with this case. \n175.  All services mentioned or described in this Agreement are subject to reasonableness \nstandards and nothing herein will be interpreted to mean that the provision of services are unlimited \nin amount, duration, or scope.  \n176.  The Agreement is binding on all successors, assignees, employees, agents, contractors, and \nall others working for or on behalf of HRRJ to implement the terms of this Agreement.  \n177.   The Parties agree that, as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, litigation is not \n“reasonably foreseeable” concerning the matters described in this Agreement.  To the extent that \nany Party previously implemented a litigation hold to preserve documents, electronically stored \ninformation, or things related to the matters described in this Agreement, the Party is no longer \nrequired to maintain such a litigation hold.  Nothing in this paragraph relieves any Party of any \nother obligations imposed by this Agreement, including the document creation and retention \nrequirements described herein. \n178.  HRRJ will not retaliate against any person because that person has filed or may file a \ncomplaint, provided assistance or information, or participated in any other manner in the United \nStates’ investigation or the Monitor’s activities related to this Agreement.  HRRJ will timely and \nthoroughly investigate any allegations of retaliation in violation of this Agreement and take any \nnecessary corrective actions identified through such investigations.  \n179.  Failure by any Party to enforce this entire Agreement or any provision thereof with respect \nto any deadline or any other provision herein will not be construed as a waiver, including of its \nright to enforce other deadlines and provisions of this Agreement.  \n180.  The Parties will promptly notify each other of any court or administrative challenge to this \nAgreement or any portion thereof.  \n181.  The Parties represent and acknowledge this Agreement is the result of extensive, thorough, \nand good faith negotiations.  The Parties further represent and acknowledge that the terms of this \nAgreement have been voluntarily accepted, after consultation with counsel, for the purpose of \nmaking a full and final compromise and settlement of the allegations set forth in the Department \nof Justice’s CRIPA Notice dated December 19, 2018.  Each Party to this Agreement represents \nand warrants that the person who has signed this Agreement on behalf of a Party is duly authorized \nto enter into this Agreement and to bind that Party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  \n182.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an \noriginal,  and  the  counterparts  will  together  constitute  one  and  the  same  Agreement, \nnotwithstanding that each Party is not a signatory to the original or the same counterpart.  \n183.  The performance of this Agreement will begin immediately upon the Effective Date.   \n184.  HRRJ will maintain sufficient records and data to document that the requirements of this \nAgreement are being properly implemented and will make such records available to the Monitor \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 31 of 32 PageID# 45\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL   Document 2-1   Filed 08/05/20   Page 32 of 32 PageID# 46",
