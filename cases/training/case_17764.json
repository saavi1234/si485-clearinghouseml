    "summary": "<p>This putative class-action lawsuit was filed on June 24, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs were residents, tenants, property owners, and business owners in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and they brought suit against the City of Seattle.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit was one of many that arose out of the widespread protests that swept the nation in the spring and summer of 2020. Although protests spread throughout the country, they were especially forceful and durable in Seattle. After the <a href=\"https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/armed-protesters-protect-east-precinct-police-building-after-officers-leave-area/4FC5C34P25BUVHDAACD4IMLT5I/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seattle Police Department left and boarded the East Precinct building on June 8, 2020</a>, protesters declared Capitol Hill an autonomous area. The region quickly became known by different names, including Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) or Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP). While some claimed that CHOP was an area dedicated to protest, arts, and providing for others, others said that there was rampant lawlessness, property destruction, and violence.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Lawsuit</strong></p>\r\n<p>While claiming that they supported the underlying inspiration for CHOP and recognizing participants' First Amendment rights, the lawsuit accused the City of abandoning that area, leaving the plaintiffs susceptible to vandalism, violence, property destruction, and other criminal activity. Plaintiffs accused the City of supporting CHOP, even as they acknowledged dangerous conditions. Further, Plaintiffs argued that the City left CHOP blocked off from public access, damaging the plaintiffs' ability to operate their businesses. Plaintiffs sought to certify as a class all people and entities who owned property in, had a business in, or resided in the area in Seattle bounded by four streets, excluding the City of Seattle and any departments or agencies of the City of Seattle.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs charged the City with violating the U.S. Constitution and the state constitution, as well as Washington statutory law. First, the complaint argued that Plaintiff class's procedural due process rights were violated by the City helping CHOP participants occupy the area and limiting the plaintiff class's access to their property. Second, Plaintiffs argued that the City created a nuisance by impeding traffic, thereby interfering with the plaintiff class's enjoyment of their property. Third, Plaintiffs argued that the City's assistance of CHOP represented a state-created danger, violating the putative class's substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Fourth, they argued that the City violated a clause of the Washington constitution which prohibited any municipality from giving property away unless for the needy. Finally, Plaintiffs argued that the City's actions represented a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Takings Clause. Plaintiffs asked for monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief, as well as attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>An End to CHOP</strong></p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2020, after several publicized acts of violence, the <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-police-clearing-chop-protest-zone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seattle Police Department dispersed the protests</a>, bringing the existence of CHOP as an \"autonomous zone\" to an end. The Seattle Police Department was called in after <a href=\"https://durkan.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Executive-Order-2020-08_Directive-City-Depts_Cal-Anderson-Park-Area.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued an executive order</a> labeling CHOP an unlawful protest.</p>\r\n<p>The Lawsuit Continues: The City's Motion to Dismiss and Deny Class Certification</p>\r\n<p>On July 10th, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The new complaint was much the same as the original, but it took out the nuisance count and the Washington Constitution count, and added a count for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>In response, the City filed a motion to dismiss and deny class certification on July 23. They argued that &sect; 1983 claims must allege that a government institution caused harm directly. The City claimed that it did nothing to directly expose plaintiffs to harm. Further, the City argued that the Due Process Clause does not compel the government to protect the life, liberty, or property of citizens by private actors. The City also claimed that it did not directly place the plaintiffs in danger, and therefore did not breach the \"state-created danger\" exception. Seattle argued that its actions did not represent a \"taking,\" as they were just a temporary loss of access to property. The motion argued that the City did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, because the City did not discriminate against anyone. Finally, the City argued that class certification was improper, because the plaintiffs complained of distinct harms at different times with differing damages. On September 10, the City additionally filed a motion to stay discovery pending a decision on the motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Thomas Zilly granted the City's motion to dismiss the claim based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution but denied the City's motion to dismiss with respect to all the other claims on October 16, 2020. 2020 WL 6120008. Regarding the Equal Protection claim, Plaintiffs had proposed two groups allegedly treated differently by the City: (1) \"areas occupied by CHOP versus other areas of the City\" and (2) \"[p]laintiffs versus CHOP participants.\" The Court found that Plaintiffs failed to show that individuals in the area occupied by CHOP were similarly situated to individuals in other areas of the City. In addition, the Court found that the City's alleged favoritism towards CHOP participants did not necessarily mean the City disfavored Plaintiffs. Furthermore, even if the proposed classes were similarly situated, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to allege that the City acted without any rational basis for treating Plaintiffs differently. However, though the Court dismissed the Equal Protection claim, the Court permitted Plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint within fourteen days and allowed Plaintiffs' procedural due process, substantive due process, and unlawful takings claims to proceed.</p>\r\n<p>In the same opinion, the Court also denied the City's motions to deny class certification and stay discovery. The Court held that it would be improper to decide class certification on the pleadings in this case and that discovery should be permitted to allow Plaintiffs an opportunity to discover evidence to show if there were in fact common questions.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs proceeded to file a second amended complaint on October 30, 2020. Two businesses were removed as plaintiffs. In addition, Plaintiffs removed the Equal Protection claim and re-added claims for negligence and nuisance. The remainder of the complaint was largely the same as the original.</p>\r\n<p>In mid-November, the National Police Association then sought leave from the Court to participate in the case as amicus curiae. The National Police Association expected to present positions in support of the plaintiffs and believed that its briefs would aid the Court by providing its perspective on a municipality's decision to supply or decline to supply police protection service. The Court denied the National Police Association's motion on December 7, 2020 without prejudice.</p>\r\n<p>As discovery progressed, the parties stipulated to a third amended complaint in order to name additional parties to the plaintiff class. Plaintiffs filed this complaint on July 2, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs moved for class certification on January 14, 2022 and the court heard oral arguments in that matter on April 20. This time, on May 9, 2022, the court denied class certification because the plaintiffs had not satisfied the commonality, typicality, predominance, and superiority requirements for class certifications: With regards to commonality, the question of whether the City acted to deprive the class of purported property interests required that every class member produce evidence of their individual rights and how the City caused an alleged deprivation. 2022 WL 1449387. Additionally, the question of whether deprivation occurred without due process also required individualized proof that the City caused a deprivation of the class members' rights. For both of these questions, Plaintiffs had not presented evidence to support the claim that the putative class members were exposed to or experienced the same dangers. With regards to typicality, the trial court found that Plaintiffs had failed to present evidence that their experiences and injuries were reasonably co-extensive with those of the putative class members. With regards to predominance, the Court found that Plaintiffs had not made the requisite showing because the issues necessarily required individualized inquiry into each class member's circumstances such as their location within the Class Area, the nature of their alleged injuries, and City's knowledge of specific dangers. Given this need for individual determinations, the court additionally concluded that a class action was not the superior method in the case because the various issues made it difficult to manage the class and fully provide relief.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of September 2022, as the case moved toward trial both Plaintiffs and the City filed separate motions for spoliation sanctions, each party accusing the other of deleting crucial text messages that would have been relevant to discovery. The City additionally filed a motion for summary judgment on September 29, 2022. On January 13, 2023, the court dismissed Plaintiffs&rsquo; procedural due process, substantive due process, and negligence claims with prejudice. 650 F.Supp.3d 1187. The court additionally dismissed one of the plaintiff&rsquo;s cause of action for taking, as well as the remaining plaintiffs&rsquo; cause of action for taking under a per se theory of liability. As a result, only two causes of action remained for trial: one for taking under a \"right of access\" theory of liability and another for nuisance.</p>\r\n<p>In a separate order, in response to the motions for spoliation sanctions, the court granted both motions in part. 2023 WL 184208. Per the court&rsquo;s order, both Plaintiffs and the City would be permitted to present evidence and argument at trial regarding missing messages. Plaintiffs were also awarded attorneys' fees and costs, including expert-related costs, incurred as a result of the City's spoliation of evidence. The City was similarly awarded attorneys fees and costs incurred as a result of one of the plaintiff's spoliation of evidence.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Settlement is Reached</strong></p>\r\n<p>On February 15, 2023, the parties notified the court that they were in the process of preparing a formal settlement agreement. The following day, the court ordered the case dismissed with prejudice and without costs, and provided that either party could move to reopen the case within 60 days of the order. As part of the subsequent settlement agreement, <a href=\"https://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-capitol-hill-organized-protest-chop-chaz-zone-settlement-agreement-payment-reached-three-million-business-owners-lawsuit-black-lives-matter-blm-george-floyd-protestspolice-city-attorney-king-county-washington-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the City agreed to pay</a> the business owners $3,650,000.

Having \n10  reviewed all papers filed in support of, and in opposition to, the motions, and having \n11  considered the oral arguments of counsel, the Court enters the following Order. \n12  Plaintiffsโ Motion for Sanctions (docket no. 104) \n13  1.  Background \n14  This matter arises from the Cityโs alleged support and encouragement of the \n15  Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (โCHOPโ) from June 8 to July 1, 2020 (the โCHOP \n16  periodโ).  Plaintiffs are local property owners, businesses, and residents who allege that \n17  the Cityโs response to CHOP violated their constitutional and other legal rights.  See \n18  Third Amended Complaint (โTACโ) at ยถ 2 (docket no. 47).  Plaintiffs commenced this \n19  action on June 24, 2020, and allege that the Cityโs โunprecedented decision to abandon \n20 \n21   \n1 Hunters Capital, Hunters Property Holdings, and the Greenus Building are referred to collectively as the \n22 \nโHunters Capital entities.โ \n23 \n  ORDER - 2 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 3 of 38\n \n \n \n1  and close offโ an approximately 16-block portion of Seattleโs Capitol Hill neighborhood \n2  โsubjected businesses, employees, and residents of that neighborhood to extensive \n3  property damage, public safety dangers, and an inability to use and access their \n4  properties.โ  See id.  After Plaintiffs initiated this action, the City and certain of its high-\n5  level officials, including then Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, then Seattle Police \n6  Department (โSPDโ) Chief Carmen Best, and Seattle Fire Department (โSFDโ) Chief \n7  Harold Scoggins, deleted thousands of text messages from their City-owned phones.2 \n8  Plaintiffs seek spoliation sanctions against the City for the destruction of \n9  thousands of the following officialsโ text messages:  (i) Mayor Durkan, (ii) Chief Best, \n10  (iii) Chief Scoggins, (iv) Seattle Public Utilities (โSPUโ) employee Idris Beauregard, \n11  (v) Assistant SPD Chief Eric Greening, (vi) SPDโs Chief Strategy Officer Chris Fischer, \n12  and (vii) Operations Coordinator for the Cityโs Emergency Operations Center Kenneth \n13  Neafcy.  As set forth in this Order, the City failed to timely notify these officials of their \n14  duty to preserve CHOP-related messages, City officials deleted thousands of text \n15  messages from their City-owned phones in complete disregard of their legal obligation to \n16  preserve relevant evidence, and the City ignored litigation holds and multiple letters from \n17  Plaintiffs requesting that it preserve all CHOP-related communications between high-\n18  level City officials such as Mayor Durkan, Chief Best, and Chief Scoggins.  Further, the \n19  City significantly delayed disclosing to Plaintiffs that thousands of text messages had \n20 \n21   \n2 Plaintiffs also allege that Chief Best deleted relevant text messages from her personal phone. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 3 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 4 of 38\n \n \n \n1  been deleted.3  Notably, all text messages sent directly between these officials during the \n2  CHOP period cannot be reproduced or recovered.  As a result, substantial evidence has \n3  been destroyed by the City and is unavailable to Plaintiffs to support their positions in \n4  this litigation. \n5  a.  The Cityโs Duty to Preserve CHOP-Related Text Messages \n6  On June 9, 2020, the organization Black Lives Matter sued the City for its \n7  allegedly violent response to local protests.  See Black Lives Matter Seattle-King Cnty. v. \n8  City of Seattle, No. 20-cv-887-RAJ (W.D. Wash.).  On June 19, 2020, Mayor Durkanโs \n9  office sent a memorandum to its employees informing them of their responsibility to \n10  retain public records such as text messages on their โCity-owned or personal smartphones \n11  and mobile devices.โ  Ex. 2 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).   \n12  On June 24, 2020, Plaintiffs commenced this action and sent a letter to Mayor \n13  Durkan informing her of the complaint that Plaintiffs had filed, Ex. 3 to Calfo Decl. \n14  (docket no. 105-1).  In a second letter dated June 27, 2020, Plaintiffsโ Counsel reminded \n15  the Seattle City Attorneyโs Office of the Cityโs legal obligation to preserve relevant \n16  evidence, including โtext messages on the business or personal phones of the Mayor and \n17 \n \n18  3 On November 5, 2020, the City retained Kevin Faulkner, a digital forensics expert, to attempt to recover \nor otherwise locate missing text messages from Mayor Durkanโs and Chief Bestโs phones.  See Faulkner \nReport at 1โ3, Ex. 8 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  The City, however, did not disclose to Plaintiffs \n19 \nthat any officialsโ text messages were missing until months later, on March 26, 2021.  Cramer Decl. at \nยถยถ 7โ8 (docket no. 140).  Following the Cityโs disclosure, Plaintiffs retained their own digital forensics \n20 \nexpert, Brandon Leatha, who analyzed information collected from Mayor Durkanโs, Chief Bestโs, Chief \nScogginsโs, Beauregardโs, Fisherโs, Assistant Chief Greeningโs, and Neafcyโs City-owned cellphones.  \n21  See Leatha Report at 1โ5, Ex. 6 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  Leatha determined that these officials \ndeleted thousands of text messages through a combination of manual deletions, factory resets, and \nchanges to their text-message-retention settings.  See id. at 5. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 4 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 5 of 38\n \n \n \n1  her staff, the Chief of Police and other high-level managers of the police department, the \n2  head of the Seattle Department of Transportation and its high-level managers, and the \n3  Fire Chief and high level managers of the fire department.โ  Ex. 4 to Calfo Decl. (docket \n4  no. 105-1).  In a third letter dated June 30, 2020, Plaintiffsโ Counsel specifically \n5  requested that the City preserve electronically stored information (โESIโ) โcontained on \n6  both personal and City-owned emails and cell phones (such as voice mails and text \n7  messages)โ of numerous City officials and employees, specifically including Mayor \n8  Durkan, SPU Director Mami Hara, Chief Best, Chief Scoggins, and their staff and \n9  employees.  Ex. 5 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1 at 41).  Despite these unambiguous \n10  preservation requests, and a well-established legal duty to preserve all text messages \n11  relevant to the litigation, City officials deleted several thousand text messages from the \n12  CHOP period. \n13  b.  Mayor Jenny Durkan   \n14  Despite being named in Plaintiffsโ preservation letters, Exs. 4โ5 to Calfo Decl., the \n15  City failed to issue Mayor Durkan a litigation hold in this matter until July 22, 2020.  \n16  Attach. A to Def.โs 1st Suppl. Answers to Pls.โ 2d Set of Interrogs., Ex. 7 to Calfo Decl. \n17  (docket no. 105-1 at 97).  By that time, Mayor Durkan had already deleted thousands of \n18  text messages from her City-owned phone.  As set forth in this Order, Mayor Durkanโs \n19  various reasons for deleting her text messages strain credibility. \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 5 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 6 of 38\n \n \n \n1  On July 4, 2020, Mayor Durkan claims that she dropped her City-owned iPhone 8 \n2  Plus into the water while she was visiting a beach.4  See Durkan Dep. at 255:7โ12, Ex. 9 \n3  to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 140-9).  The phoneโs screen appeared โpixilatedโ after she \n4  retrieved the device from the water, so Mayor Durkan turned it off and placed it in a bag \n5  of rice.  Id. at 255:13โ20.  At some point, her phone started to work again.  Id. at 255:21โ\n6  256:24.  Because she was experiencing difficulty getting her calendar to load on the \n7  device, Mayor Durkan, despite having already received a letter from Plaintiffs regarding \n8  the preservation of her CHOP-related communications, reset her phone and restored its \n9  data using an iCloud backup.  Id. at 256:5โ12.  Mayor Durkan testified during her \n10  deposition that all of her text messages were still saved on the device at that time.  See id. \n11  at 256:13โ24.  While resetting her phone on July 4, 2020, however, Mayor Durkan \n12  selected a โDisable and Deleteโ setting that stopped her phone from synchronizing text \n13  messages to iCloud and set all text messages stored in iCloud to be automatically deleted \n14  in 30 days.5  Faulkner Report at 29, Ex. 8 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  In an email \n15 \n \n16 \n4 At the time, the โMessages in iCloudโ setting on her iPhone was enabled, meaning that her text \nmessages were set to be automatically saved in iCloud.  See Faulkner Report at 25, 29.  Additionally, \n17 \nMayor Durkanโs iPhone was set to retain her text messages forever.  Id.    \n18  5 Faulknerโs forensic examination of Mayor Durkanโs iPhone shows that on July 4, 2020, at 4:51 p.m. \nPacific Daylight Time (โPDTโ), the device was restored using an iCloud backup file from โearly-to-mid \nFebruary 2020.โ  Faulkner Report at 27.  In order to restore an iPhone from an iCloud backup, the device \n19 \nmust first be factory reset (erased).  Leatha Report at 13.  At 5:19 p.m. PDT, the โDisable & Deleteโ \nfunction was selected, which caused Mayor Durkanโs iPhone to โstop synchronizing messages to iCloud \n20  and set all messages stored in iCloud to be deleted from iCloud (but not from the iPhone itself) in 30 \ndays, on August 4, 2020.โ  Faulkner Report at 29.  During his deposition, Faulkner explained that he was \n21  unaware of any way to select the โDisable & Deleteโ function remotely.  Faulkner Dep. at 131:5โ10, Ex. \n9 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  According to Mayor Durkan, nobody else accessed her phone that \nday.  Durkan Dep. at 95:10โ12, Ex. 12 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  Nevertheless, Mayor Durkan \n22 \n \n23 \n  ORDER - 6 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 7 of 38\n \n \n \n1  to her staff dated July 4, 2020, Mayor Durkan confirmed that she reset and restored her \n2  phone using an iCloud backup.  See Ex. 10 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  The email \n3  stated that her phone had โdied,โ but did not disclose that her phone allegedly fell into the \n4  water.  Id. \n5  On July 7, 2020, Mayor Durkanโs IT staff obtained a new City-owned iPhone 11 \n6  for her official use.  See Ex. 18 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-2).  Although this \n7  litigation had already commenced weeks earlier, when a City IT staff member transferred \n8  the data on Mayor Durkanโs iPhone 8 Plus to the new iPhone 11, he failed to make a \n9  backup of the old device.6  See Arhu Dep. at 63:5โ16, Ex. 14 to Calfo Decl. (docket \n10  no. 105-1).  Further, at some point between July 4 and July 26, 2020, โsomeoneโ selected \n11  the โ30-day deleteโ setting on Mayor Durkanโs new iPhone 11.  Faulkner Report at 33โ\n12  34; Leatha Report at 3, 14, Ex. 6 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  Consequently, \n13  Mayor Durkanโs iPhone 11 began deleting, on a rolling basis, all text messages older than \n14  30 days.  Leatha Report at 3, 7โ8, 14.     \n15  Between July 22 and July 26, 2020, โsomeoneโ changed the text message retention \n16  setting on Mayor Durkanโs iPhone 11 from 30 days back to forever, which coincides with \n17  Mayor Durkanโs receipt of the litigation hold in this matter on July 22, 2020.  Faulkner \n18 \n \n19 \ntestified that she has no recollection of selecting the โDisable & Deleteโ function.  Durkan Dep. at 93:1โ5, \n20 \n95:10โ12, Ex. 10 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 140-10). \n21  6 The employee testified during his deposition that the Cityโs practice at the time was to make a backup of \nan old phone before transferring data to a new one.  See Arhu Dep. at 27:4โ8, Ex. 14 to Calfo Decl. \n(docket no. 105-1). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 7 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 8 of 38\n \n \n \n1  Report at 3 n.2, 33โ34; Leatha Report at 14; Attach. A to Def.โs 1st Suppl. Answers to \n2  Pls.โ 2d Set of Interrogs. (docket no. 105-1 at 97).  The damage, however, had already \n3  been done.  Switching to the 30-day delete setting caused the loss of 5,746 of Mayor \n4  Durkanโs text messages from before June 25, 2020.  Leatha Report at 14.  In addition to \n5  the text messages that were deleted as a result of her phoneโs retention settings, Mayor \n6  Durkan manually deleted 191 messages from her new iPhone 11 between July 4 and \n7  November 19, 2020.  Leatha Report at 14โ15.7  Mayor Durkan admits that she \n8  occasionally deleted text messages which contained โphishy thingsโ such as apparent \n9  spam messages.  Durkan Dep. at 72:15โ25, Ex. 12 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1). \n10  On or about August 21, 2020, Michelle Chen, Mayor Durkanโs counsel and a \n11  Seattle City Attorneyโs Office employee, discovered that Mayor Durkan was missing all \n12  text messages from before June 25, 2020.  Def.โs 1st Suppl. Answer to Pls.โ Interrogs. \n13  (docket no. 105-1 at 85, 86 n.1).  Despite Chenโs discovery that a significant number of \n14  text messages were missing from the Mayorโs phone, the City now contends in this \n15  litigation that the Seattle City Attorneyโs Office did not learn of Mayor Durkanโs deleted \n16  text messages until October 2020.  Def.โs 1st Suppl. Answer to Pls.โ Interrog. No. 27 \n17  (docket no. 105-1 at 86).  On September 17, 2020, despite the Mayorโs and her counselโs \n18  knowledge of the missing text messages, a member of the Mayorโs IT staff factory reset \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \n7 Faulknerโs report does not address any manually deleted text messages because the City did not ask him \nto do so.  See Faulkner Dep. at 175:16โ21, 176:1โ5 (docket no. 105-1). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 8 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 9 of 38\n \n \n \n1  the iPhone 8 Plus she allegedly dropped in the water on July 4, 2020.8  Leatha Report at \n2  13; Arhu Dep. at 75:2โ17 (docket no. 105-1).  The City did not notify Plaintiffs until \n3  March 26, 2021, that Mayor Durkan was missing text messages.  Cramer Decl. at ยถ 7 \n4  (docket no. 140).  Importantly, Plaintiffs contend that during the CHOP period and \n5  thereafter, Mayor Durkan frequently texted Chief Best, Chief Scoggins, and other high-\n6  level City officials regarding the Cityโs response to CHOP. \n7  c.  SPD Chief Carmen Best \n8  Although she was named in Plaintiffsโ preservation letters, Exs. 4โ5 to Calfo \n9  Decl., the City did not issue Chief Best a litigation hold in this matter until July 27, 2020, \n10  Attach.

Despite the litigation hold and her legal obligation to preserve any CHOP-related \n12  text messages, Chief Bestโs City-owned iPhone did not contain any text messages dated \n13  before September 2, 2020, which is the day she returned her phone to the City following \n14  her resignation.  Def.โs 1st Suppl. Answer to Pls.โ Interrog. No. 31 (docket no. 105-1 at \n15  88โ89).

Despite receiving \n7  her phone in September 2020, the City claims it first became aware that text messages \n8  were missing from the device in March 2021, and blames the delay on COVID work \n9  requirements.

Ex. 29 to Calfo Decl. \n4  (docket no. 105-2).  Some text messages produced from an SPD employeeโs personal \n5  phone show that Chief Best sometimes used her personal phone to discuss official issues, \n6  such as potential interviews with news agencies and releasing certain incident reports \n7  during CHOP.  See Ex. 30 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-2).  As a result, Plaintiffs \n8  contend they have been deprived of many relevant text messages that were on Chief \n9  Bestโs personal phone. \n10  d.

Plaintiffs also request fees and costs incurred as a result of the Cityโs alleged \n2  spoliation of evidence. \n3  2.  Discussion \n4  a.  Applicable Standard \n5  Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to \n6  preserve evidence, in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation.  See United States v. \n7  Kitsap Physicians Serv., 314 F.3d 995, 1001 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Leon v. IDX Sys. \n8  Corp., 464 F.3d 951, 959 (9th Cir. 2006) (โA partyโs destruction of evidence qualifies as \n9  willful spoliation if the party has โsome notice that the documents were potentially \n10  relevant to the litigation before they were destroyed.โโ (quoting Kitsap Physicians Serv., \n11  314 F.3d at 1001)).  โFederal law governs the imposition of spoilation sanctions as \n12  โspoilation constitutes an evidentiary matter.โโ  Estate of Hill v. NaphCare, Inc., No. 20-\n13  cv-00410, 2022 WL 1464830, at *9 (E.D. Wash. May 9, 2022) (quoting Ala. Aircraft \n14  Indus., Inc. v. Boeing Co., 319 F.R.D. 730, 739 (N.D.

Editions Ltd. W., Inc., 786 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. 2015), and must \n3  show, at a minimum, that (i) the evidence at issue qualifies as ESI, (ii) the ESI is โlostโ \n4  and โcannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery,โ (iii) the offending \n5  party โfailed to take reasonable steps to preserveโ the ESI, and (iv) the offending party \n6  was under a duty to preserve it.

If these four criteria are met and \n8  the Court determines that the moving party is prejudiced from the โloss of the \n9  information,โ the Court may โorder measures no greater than necessary to cure the \n10  prejudice.โ  See Fed.

For example, in Gaina, the district court \n11  concluded that plaintiffโs failure to preserve relevant text messages prejudiced the \n12  defendant and required plaintiff to pay certain monetary sanctions to cure the prejudice.  \n13  2019 WL 1751825, at *5.  Although plaintiff argued that she deleted the text messages \n14  pursuant to her practice of โhabituallyโ clearing memory space on her phone, the Gaina \n15  Court explained that plaintiff was under a duty to preserve her โhighly relevantโ \n16  communications.  Id. at *4. \n17  โAlthough [Rule] 37(e) does not place the burden of proving or disproving \n18  prejudice on either party, if spoliation is proven, the burden shifts to the spoliating party \n19  to prove the lost information is not prejudicial.โ  See Youngevity Intโl v.

R. Civ. P. 37(e) advisory committeeโs \n14  note to 2015 amendment.  Whether the offending party โacted with the intent to depriveโ \n15  the moving party โof the informationโs use in the litigation,โ see Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2), \n16  is a question for the Court.  See Mannion v. Ameri-Can Freight Sys. Inc., No. CV-17-\n17  03262, 2020 WL 417492, at *4 (D. Ariz.

Further, โan \n3  employeeโs misconduct with regard to spoliation can be imputed to an employer.โ  \n4  Colonies Partners, 2020 WL 1496444, at *10. \n5  In Estate of Hill, the district court held that a municipal defendant intentionally \n6  spoliated โsix hours of highly relevant video [surveillance] evidenceโ from a county jail.  \n7  2022 WL 1464830, at *13.  In finding that the defendant acted with the requisite intent to \n8  avoid its litigation obligations, the court explained that the defendant provided โno \n9  explanationโcredible or otherwiseโabout why someoneโ at the jail made the intentional \n10  choice to permanently destroy a portion of the relevant surveillance video.  Id. at *12.  \n11  Similarly, the Colonies Partners Court found that a defendant, a former district attorney \n12  โwho had the assistance of experienced civil litigation counselโ acted with the requisite \n13  intent under Rule 37(e)(2) when he deleted certain text messages and emails.  2020 WL \n14  1496444, at *10. \n15  b.  Whether the City Spoliated Evidence \n16  i.  The Cityโs Duty to Preserve ESI \n17  As an initial matter, neither party disputes that all of the text messages at issue in \n18  this action constitute ESI for the purposes of Rule 37(e).  Gaina, 2019 WL 1751825, at \n19  *3 (applying Rule 37(e) to text messages).  Similarly, the parties do not dispute that the \n20  seven above-referenced City officials were under a duty to preserve their text messages.    \n21  Clearly, the parties had a duty to preserve relevant evidence, including text messages, as \n22  soon as a claim was identified.

Id. at ยถ 15.   \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 19 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 20 of 38\n \n \n \n1  The City, however, ignores that it has not recovered any deleted text messages \n2  exchanged directly between Mayor Durkan and Chief Best, Mayor Durkan and Chief \n3  Scoggins, or Chief Scoggins and Chief Best, during the CHOP period.12  See Faulkner \n4  Dep. at 109:3โ12, Ex. 9 to Calfo Decl. (docket no. 105-1).  The parties do not dispute that \n5  these high-level officials communicated directly with each other via text message during \n6  the CHOP period.  See Best Dep. (Nov. 9, 2021) at 205:7โ208:16, Ex. 22 to Cramer Decl. \n7  (docket no. 140-22); Scoggins Dep. at 107:6โ21 (docket no. 140-24).  The Court \n8  therefore concludes that a substantial number of the deleted text messages are lost and \n9  cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery.  See Youngevity, 2020 WL \n10  7048687, at *4 (โ[S]ome of the [defendants] have spoliated text messages over the same \n11  time periods, thus it is not possible to obtain text messages that may have been exchanged \n12  between them during these periods because both the sender and receiver have lost all text \n13  messages.โ). \n14  iii.  The Cityโs Failure to Preserve the Text Messages \n \n15  The City argues that it took reasonable steps to preserve ESI and that Rule 37(e) \n16  โdoes not call for perfection.โ  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) advisory committeeโs note to \n17  2015 amendment.  Although the City issued a significant number of litigation holds, \n18  officials at the highest levels of City government completely disregarded these holds and \n19  deleted thousands of relevant text messages.  See Dawson Decl. at ยถ 42 (explaining that \n20 \n \n21 \n12 The City conceded at oral argument that it does not know exactly how many of the deleted text \nmessages are still missing. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 20 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 21 of 38\n \n \n \n1  the City has produced thousands of responsive text messages as a result of its efforts to \n2  recreate the deleted messages, which demonstrates that the City deleted thousands of \n3  relevant messages).  Given the scope of the loss, the Court cannot conclude that the City \n4  took reasonable steps to preserve the messages. See First Fin. Sec., Inc. v. Freedom \n5  Equity Grp., LLC, No. 15-cv-1893, 2016 WL 5870218, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2016) \n6  (โ[Defendant] took no reasonable steps to preserve text messages, and those messages \n7  cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery.โ).  The Cityโs failure to \n8  timely notify these officials of their obligation to preserve ESI, its failure to follow its \n9  own protocols to maintain City text messages, and its long delay in notifying Plaintiffs of \n10  the deleted messages after Michelle Chen first discovered the issue (with respect to \n11  Mayor Durkanโs messages) on August 21, 2020, lead the Court to conclude that the \n12  Cityโs spoliation was much more egregious than a failure to achieve โperfection.โ   The \n13  City cannot reasonably dispute that significant evidence is missing in this action and can \n14  never be recovered. \n15  c.  Whether Sanctions are Appropriate \n16  i.  Prejudice  \n17  Having found that the City spoliated the officialsโ deleted text messages, the Court \n18  may impose sanctions against the City if Plaintiffs are prejudiced by the loss of the \n19  messages.  See Youngevity, 2020 WL 7048687, at *4 (โOnly upon a finding of prejudice \n20  may sanctions be issued.โ); Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(1).  As discussed above, the City bears \n21  the burden to show that Plaintiffs have not been prejudiced by the Cityโs conduct.  See \n22  Youngevity, 2020 WL 7048687, at *3.  In this case, the City has not met its burden and \n23 \n  ORDER - 21 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 22 of 38\n \n \n \n1  the Court finds that Plaintiffs have been prejudiced by the Cityโs spoliation of the \n2  officialsโ text messages.  The Cityโs reconstruction of thousands of missing text \n3  messages, although helpful, cannot replace the text messages that it has not recovered.  \n4  See id. at *4 (โPlaintiffs are still likely prejudiced because the ESI produced is no \n5  substitute for the potentially relevant information within lost text messages.โ); see also \n6  Leon, 464 F.3d at 959 (explaining that an offending party cannot assert a โpresumption of \n7  irrelevanceโ as to destroyed material because the relevance of destroyed documents \n8  โcannot be clearly ascertainedโ (citation omitted)).  Moreover, the missing text messages \n9  at issue in this action are not from low-level City employees.  Rather, Plaintiffs have been \n10  deprived of text messages from multiple officials representing the highest levels of City \n11  government and those responsible for establishing and implementing the Cityโs response \n12  to CHOP.  Of great significance is the fact that any direct messages between these \n13  officials, such as those between Mayor Durkan and Chief Best or between Mayor Durkan \n14  and Chief Scoggins, cannot be recovered.  The Court finds that the deleted text messages \n15  threaten to interfere with the rightful decision in this case, id., and sanctions against the \n16  City are clearly warranted. \n17  ii.  Intent \n18    Plaintiffs request entry of default judgment against the City, thereby raising the \n19  issue of whether the City acted with intent to deprive Plaintiffs of the informationโs use in \n20  this matter.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2).  Only upon a finding of intent may the Court \n21  impose severe sanctions such as an adverse-inference instruction or default judgment.  \n22  See id.  In Youngevity, for example, the district court found that defendants did not act \n23 \n  ORDER - 22 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 23 of 38\n \n \n \n1  with the requisite intent under Rule 37(e)(2) when they deleted text messages relevant to \n2  litigation.  2020 WL 7048687, at *4.  There, plaintiffs failed to show that the defendantsโ \n3  โconduct surpassed gross negligence,โ id. at *4,  in part because the partiesโ independent \n4  forensic expert โcould not distinguish between intentional deletions and deletions caused \n5  by unintentional technological malfunctions,โ  id. at *1.  On this record, however, the \n6  Court finds substantial circumstantial evidence that the City acted with the requisite \n7  intent necessary to impose a severe sanction and that the Cityโs conduct exceeds gross \n8  negligence.   \n9    This case does not involve a single high-level City official inadvertently allowing \n10  his or her phone to be reset.  See Stevens v. Brigham Young Univ.โIdaho, No. 16-CV-\n11  530, 2019 WL 6499098, at *2 (D. Idaho Dec. 3, 2019).  Instead, Mayor Durkan, Chief \n12  Best, Chief Scoggins, and other key City officials purged (through factory resets, \n13  changed retention settings, or manual deletions) thousands of CHOP-related text \n14  messages from their phones after they were under a clear legal obligation to preserve \n15  such information and without confirming that all of their text messages had been \n16  preserved through other means.13  See, e.g., Moody v. CSX Transp., Inc., 271 F. Supp. 3d \n17   \n18  13 The City speculates that the timing of Chief Scogginsโs, Assistant Chief Greeningโs, Fisherโs, Neafcyโs, \nand Beauregardโs factory resets, which all occurred between October and November 2020, might be \nexplained by a City security protocol.  Brian Kennedy, one of SPDโs mobile phone coordinators, \n19 \nexplained during his deposition that a preexisting City security protocol will periodically prompt users of \nCity-issued phones to change their passcodes.  Kennedy Dep. at 127:15โ128:13, Ex. 28 to Cramer Decl. \n20  (docket no. 140-28).  The record, however, is unclear as to whether this protocol was responsible for the \nissues experienced by all five of these officials.  Regardless of the circumstances that led to Chief \n21  Scoggins, Assistant Chief Greening, Fisher, Neafcy, and Beauregard being locked out of their phones, all \nof their phones were purposefully reset in blatant disregard of the Cityโs duty to preserve all CHOP-\nrelated text messages.  Importantly, the City failed to ensure that these officialsโ relevant messages were \n22 \n \n23 \n  ORDER - 23 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 24 of 38\n \n \n \n1  410, 431 (W.D.N.Y. 2017) (โWhile knowing they had a duty to preserve the event \n2  recorder data, defendants allowed the original data on the event recorder to be \n3  overwritten, and destroyed or recycled [an employeeโs] laptop without ever confirming \n4  that the data had been preserved in another repository.โ).  The City cannot reasonably \n5  dispute that these officials were aware of their obligation to preserve all CHOP-related \n6  communications.  Mayor Durkan, an experienced attorney, was certainly aware of her \n7  duty to preserve evidence relevant to this action.  Although the City argues that many of \n8  the deleted messages are not likely relevant, its efforts to recover the messages have \n9  resulted in the production of thousands of responsive communications, see Dawson Decl. \n10  at ยถ 42, leading the Court to conclude that many relevant text messages remain missing.   \n11    The Cityโs failure to respond once it learned of Mayor Durkanโs missing text \n12  messages supports a finding of intent.  Although the City attempts to argue that it did not \n13  learn of Mayor Durkanโs missing text messages until October 2020, Def.โs 1st Suppl. \n14  Answer to Pls.โ Interrogs. No. 27 (docket no. 105-1 at 86 n.1), the City does not dispute \n15  that Mayor Durkanโs counsel was employed by the City Attorneyโs Office and learned of \n16  the Mayorโs missing text messages on August 21, 2020, Def.โs 1st Suppl. Answer to Pls.โ \n17  Interrogs. (docket no. 105-1 at 85).  Despite this knowledge, the City did not take any \n18  action to ensure that other officialsโ text messages were preserved, which is demonstrated \n19 \n \n20 \npreserved before resetting their phones months after litigation had commenced in this action, and the \n21  Court finds that the Cityโs conduct far surpasses gross negligence. \n \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 24 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 25 of 38\n \n \n \n1  by the conduct of six officials who deleted their text messages and/or reset their phones \n2  after August 21, 2020.  The Court is also troubled by the fact that on September 17, 2020, \n3  a City employee factory reset the iPhone 8 Plus that Mayor Durkan had allegedly \n4  dropped into the water without first creating a backup of the device, further frustrating \n5  the recovery of any of the Mayorโs deleted text messages.  Leatha Report at 13; Arhu \n6  Dep. at 75:2โ17 (docket no. 105-1).  \n7  The Cityโs delay in notifying Plaintiffs about this issue is also circumstantial \n8  evidence that the spoliation was intentional.  The record reflects that the City โhid the \n9  ballโ until forced to disclose the missing text messages in March 2021.  On November 5, \n10  2020, the City retained its own digital forensics expert to attempt to recover missing text \n11  messages from Mayor Durkanโs and Chief Bestโs phones, see Faulkner Report at 1โ3 \n12  (docket no. 105-1), but did not inform Plaintiffs that any text messages were missing until \n13  March 26, 2021.  Cramer Decl. at ยถยถ 7โ8 (docket no. 140).  Plaintiffs then attempted to \n14  subpoena any CHOP-related text messages from Chief Bestโs personal phone, but she \n15  had already factory reset the device at an Apple Store.  Best Dep. (Nov. 9, 2021) at \n16  224:20โ225:21 (docket no. 105-2).  Although the City attempts to blame its delay in \n17  discovering the missing messages on the COVID pandemic, Cramer Decl. at ยถ 5, or the \n18  length of time it took to image the officialsโ phones, id. at ยถ 8, the Cityโs COVID \n19  protocols cannot explain why all of the key City officialsโ text messages were deleted in \n20  complete disregard of their legal obligation to preserve all CHOP-related ESI from the \n21  CHOP period. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 25 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 26 of 38\n \n \n \n1  To be clear, Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence from which the Court \n2  could conclude that the seven City officials acted pursuant to some elaborate conspiracy \n3  to delete their text messages.  Plaintiffs have, however, presented substantial \n4  circumstantial evidence that the City acted with the requisite โintent to deprive,โ within \n5  the meaning of Rule 37(e)(2).  See Estate of Hill, 2022 WL 1464830, at *11 (explaining \n6  that intent may be inferred โif a party is on notice that documents were potentially \n7  relevant and fails to take measures to preserve relevant evidence . . . โ).  The Court \n8  concludes that the City acted with the intent to deprive Plaintiffs of the text messagesโ \n9  use in litigation.  The Court finds that the deleted text messages were highly likely to \n10  have contained relevant communications between high-level City officials discussing \n11  ongoing events during the CHOP period.  See Leon, 464 F.3d at 960 (explaining how \n12  โany numberโ of the 2,200 files plaintiff spoliated โcould have been relevantโ to \n13  defendantโs claims or defenses โalthough it is impossible to identify which files and how \n14  they might have been used.โ).  Because the Court finds that the City acted with the \n15  requisite intent, Rule 37(e)(2) permits the imposition of severe sanctions. \n16  iii.  Appropriate Sanction \n17    When deciding whether to impose a terminating sanction such as entry of default \n18  judgment, a court must consider five factors:  (i) โthe publicโs interest in expeditious \n19  resolution of litigation,โ (ii) โthe courtโs need to manage its docket,โ (iii) โthe risk of \n20  prejudice to the party seeking sanctions,โ (iv) โthe public policy favoring disposition of \n21  cases on their merit,โ and (v) โthe availability of less drastic sanctions.โ  Colonies \n22  Partners, 2020 WL 1496444, at *11 (alteration omitted, citing Thompson v. Hous. Auth. \n23 \n  ORDER - 26 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 27 of 38\n \n \n \n1  of L.A., 782 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir. 1986)).  โTerminating sanctions may be warranted \n2  where a party is no longer able to present its case, spoliation occurs in direct violation of \n3  a court order, where a party has obviously engaged in deceptive practices during \n4  litigation, or where a court anticipates continued deceptive misconduct.โ  Id.  Although \n5  the scope of the Cityโs spoliation in this case is egregious, entry of default judgment \n6  against the City is too severe and is not supported by the factors referenced above or the \n7  evidence. \n8  The Court concludes that a lesser sanction, namely an adverse jury instruction, is \n9  appropriate to cure the prejudice in this case.  Plaintiffs request that any adverse-\n10  inference instruction clearly identify the elements of their claims that the jury should \n11  presume are satisfied, but such a detailed instruction is unwarranted.  Although Plaintiffs \n12  have been prejudiced by the destruction of the officialsโ text messages, whether the \n13  spoliated text messages contained evidence supporting particular elements of Plaintiffsโ \n14  claims is unclear.  Instead, the Court will issue an adverse instruction at trial that the jury \n15  may presume that the City officialsโ text messages (deleted after Plaintiffs commenced \n16  this action) were unfavorable to the City.14  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2)(B) (authorizing \n17  the Court to โinstruct the jury that it may . . . presume the information was unfavorable to \n18  the partyโ).  Further, Plaintiffs will be allowed to present evidence and argument at trial \n19  about the Cityโs deletion of the text messages.  Plaintiffs are also awarded attorneysโ fees \n20 \n21   \n14 The Court will determine the exact language of the instruction at a later date. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 27 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 28 of 38\n \n \n \n1  and costs (including expert-related costs) incurred as a result of the Cityโs spoliation of \n2  evidence.  See Youngevity, 2020 WL 7048687, at *5.  Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ motion for \n3  sanctions is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \n4  The Cityโs Motion for Sanctions (docket no. 107) \n5  1.  Background \n6  The City is not the only party missing text messages in this action.  The City \n7  alleges that certain plaintiffs, namely the Hunters Capital entities, Richmark Label, \n8  Bergmanโs Lock and Key, Onyx HOA and Wade Biller, Car Tender, and Matthew \n9  Ploszaj, also spoliated evidence. \n10  a.  The Hunters Capital Entities \n11  In a letter dated December 23, 2021, Plaintiffs informed the City that they were \n12  unable to recover any text messages sent or received by Hunters Capitalโs founder and \n13  CEO Michael Malone from before March 26, 2021, โeither from his iPhone or from any \n14  other backup source.โ  Ex. 2 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 108-2).  During his deposition \n15  in this matter, Malone explained that he sometimes deleted โrandom messagesโ from his \n16  phone, Malone Dep. at 290:12โ20, Ex. 2 to Reilly-Bates Decl. (docket no. 123-2), and \n17  was aware of his obligation to preserve text messages related to this action, Malone Dep. \n18  at 281:12โ15, Ex. 1 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 108-1).  In a declaration dated \n19  October 25, 2022, Malone declares that he provided the iPhone he used during CHOP to \n20  Plaintiffsโ Counsel on May 3, 2021, so the phone could be imaged.  Malone Decl. at \n21  ยถยถ 3โ4 (docket no. 127).  After Plaintiffsโ Counsel returned the phone, Malone lost the \n22  device, sometime near the end of May 2021.

Id. at ยถ 5.  The package containing the phone, however, was \n3  stolen after the delivery person left it on the street.  Id.  Maloneโs attempts to locate the \n4  device were unsuccessful, id. at ยถ 6, and he later learned that the image of his phone taken \n5  in May 2021 contained no text messages older than March 26, 2021.  Id. at ยถ 7.  Malone \n6  cannot explain why there were no text messages on his phone prior to March 26, 2021, \n7  id., and he claims that he never deleted his entire text message history from CHOP, id. at \n8  ยถ 8.  Although Malone admits that he occasionally deleted marketing and spam messages, \n9  he categorically denies deleting any CHOP-related messages.  Id. at ยถ 9. \n10  b.  Richmark Label \n11  During his deposition, Richmark Labelโs owner Bill Donner testified that he \n12  deleted all of his CHOP-related text messages.  Donner Dep. at 197:6โ200:11, Ex. 13 to \n13  Cramer Decl. (docket no. 108-13).  Donner explained that he deleted his CHOP-related \n14  messages like he โnormallyโ does with all texts.  Id. at 199:11โ14.  According to a \n15  declaration dated October 24, 2022, Donner deleted all of his text messages from the \n16  relevant time period โduring or shortly after CHOP concluded on July 1, 2020, due to \n17  [his] normal habit of deleting text messages shortly after they are received.โ  Donner \n18  Decl. at ยถ 14 (docket no. 137).  Donner declares that all of his deleted text messages \n19  โwould have only been with personal family and friends.โ  Id. at ยถ 16. \n20  c.  Bergmanโs Lock and Key \n21  Bergmanโs Lock and Key owner Lonnie Thompson testified during his deposition \n22  that he no longer has any CHOP-related text messages because he inadvertently dropped \n23 \n  ORDER - 29 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 30 of 38\n \n \n \n1  his phone into Lake Washington in October 2020 and lost its replacement while hiking in \n2  January 2021.

In a declaration dated October 21, 2022, Thompson explains that he was unable to \n4  locate either phone and did not use any form of backup or cloud-based storage.  \n5  Thompson Decl. at ยถยถ 4โ5 (docket no. 135).  Thompson asked his employees if they had \n6  any of his CHOP-related text messages, but none had any messages to produce.  Id. at \n7  ยถ 6. \n8  d.  Onyx HOA and Wade Biller \n9  Wade Biller, an Onyx HOA board member and individual plaintiff in this action, \n10  is also missing CHOP-related text messages.  In December 2020, Biller replaced the \n11  Android phone he used during CHOP with a new iPhone.  Biller Dep. at 68:15โ69:1, \n12  Ex. 14 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 108-14).  When Biller provided his old phone to \n13  Plaintiffsโ Counsel in May 2021, it was โno longer functioning properly and [he] could \n14  no longer personally accessโ any messages on the device.  Biller Decl. at ยถ 16 (docket \n15  no. 138).  According to Biller, Plaintiffsโ โtech consultantsโ have been unable to turn on \n16  the phone.  Id. at ยถ 17.  \n17  e.  The Signal Plaintiffs \n18  Beginning in June 2020, several plaintiffs and/or their representatives began using \n19  the โSignalโ messaging application to discuss the protests occurring in and around Cal \n20  Anderson Park.  Biller Dep. at 63:1โ64:2 (docket no. 108-14).  Signal is known for \n21  โdisappearing messages,โ which can be automatically erased from every participantโs \n22  phone after a period set by the sender.  Ex. 16 to Cramer Decl.

Similarly, Ploszaj, McDermott, Lochelt, and \n8  Stevens allege that they participated passively in the Signal messaging group and \n9  discontinued use of the application in November 2020, January 2021, August 2020, and \n10  July 2020, respectively.  Ploszaj Decl. at ยถ 5 (docket no. 136); McDermott Decl. at ยถ 4 \n11  (docket no. 129); Lochelt Decl. at ยถ 3 (docket no. 126); Stevens Decl. at ยถ 3 (docket \n12  no. 128).  Billerโs Signal messages cannot be recovered because they are saved to his \n13  earlier-discussed, inoperable Android phone.  Biller Dep. at ยถ 16.  All of the Signal \n14  Plaintiffs declare that they never used the applicationโs โdisappearing messagesโ feature.  \n15  Cronauer Decl. at ยถ 10; Ploszaj Decl. at ยถ 9; McDermott Decl. at ยถ 9; Lochelt Decl. at ยถ 7; \n16  Stevens Decl. at ยถ 7; Biller Decl. at ยถ 21.   \n17  The City asks the Court for an adverse inference instruction, exclusion of \n18  evidence, and an award of fees and costs as to the Hunters Capital entities, Richmark \n19  Label, Car Tender, and Ploszaj.  The City requests only fees and costs as to Biller, Onyx \n20  HOA, and Bergmanโs Lock and Key. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 31 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 32 of 38\n \n \n \n1  2.  Discussion \n2  a.  Whether Plaintiffs Spoliated Evidence \n3  i.  Plaintiffsโ Duty to Preserve ESI \n4  As discussed above, the parties agree that text and/or Signal messages qualify as \n5  ESI under Rule 37(e), and Plaintiffs do not dispute that they were under a duty to \n6  preserve their messages.  Instead, Plaintiffs argue that Wade Biller of Onyx HOA and \n7  Lonnie Thompson of Bergmanโs Lock and Key took reasonable steps to preserve their \n8  ESI. \n9  ii.  Reasonable Steps to Preserve \n \n10  With respect to Biller, the available evidence indicates that his old phone stopped \n11  working through no fault of his own.  Biller Dep. at 68:15โ69:1 (docket no. 108-14).  \n12  According to Biller, he placed his old phone in a drawer after he acquired a new phone in \n13  December 2020.  Id.; Biller Decl. at ยถ 15.  When he turned his old phone over to \n14  Plaintiffsโ Counsel in May 2021, โit was no longer functioning properlyโ and he could \n15  not access the text or Signal messages on the device.  Biller Decl. at ยถ 16.  Unlike the \n16  City officialsโ conduct, which involved factory resetting phones or manually deleting text \n17  messages without ensuring that messages were preserved elsewhere, Biller stored his \n18  phone in a drawer for safekeeping.  The City has not provided any evidence \n19  demonstrating that Biller failed to take reasonable steps to preserve his messages. \n20  Similarly, the City has failed to show that Lonnie Thompson of Bergmanโs Lock \n21  and Key failed to take reasonable steps to preserve his messages.  Thompson \n22  inadvertently lost the phone he used during CHOP while boating on Lake Washington in \n23 \n  ORDER - 32 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 33 of 38\n \n \n \n1  October 2020, see Thompson Dep. at 105:17โ106:13 (docket no. 108-15); Thompson \n2  Decl. at ยถยถ 3โ4, and lost its replacement in January 2021 while hiking in the Cascades.  \n3  See Thompson Dep. at 105:17โ106:13 (docket no. 108-15); Thompson Decl. at ยถ 5.  \n4  Although Thompson did not save his text messages to any external source, the City has \n5  cited no authority requiring individuals to back up their text messages to iCloud or an \n6  equivalent service.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Biller (Onyx HOA) and \n7  Thompson (Bergmanโs Lock and Key) did not spoliate evidence in this case. \n8  iii.  Whether Plaintiffsโ Messages are Lost and Cannot be Replaced \nThrough Additional Discovery \n9   \nPlaintiffs also argue that the Signal Plaintiffsโ messages are not lost because they \n10 \nhave provided the City with over 8,866 Signal messages collected from a third-party \n11 \nparticipant who was involved in the neighborhood chat, see Reilly-Bates Decl. at ยถ 14 \n12 \n(docket no. 123).  All of the Signal Plaintiffs, with the exception of Biller (who took \n13 \nreasonable steps to preserve the phone he used during CHOP), have reviewed the \n14 \nmessages collected from the third party and do not recall sending any other messages \n15 \nusing the Signal application.  See Cronauer Decl. at ยถ 8; Ploszaj Decl. at ยถ 10; McDermott \n16 \nDecl. at ยถ 10; Lochelt Decl. at ยถ 6; Stevens Decl. at ยถ 5.  Likewise, all of the Signal \n17 \nPlaintiffs deny using the โdisappearing messagesโ feature.  Cronauer Decl. at ยถ 10; \n18 \nPloszaj Decl. at ยถ 9; McDermott Decl. at ยถ 9; Lochelt Decl. at ยถ 7; Stevens Decl. at ยถ 7; \n19 \nBiller Decl. at ยถ 21.  Because the Signal Plaintiffsโ messages are not lost, the Court \n20 \nconcludes that the Signal Plaintiffs did not spoliate their messages. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 33 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 34 of 38\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs, however, appear to concede that Michael Malone of Hunters Capital \n2  and Bill Donner of Richmark Label spoliated their CHOP-related text messages, and they \n3  argue only that (i) the loss is not prejudicial to the City, and (ii) Malone and Donner did \n4  not act with the requisite intent.  Malone does not dispute that he no longer has any text \n5  messages predating March 26, 2021, Malone Decl. at ยถ 7 (docket no. 127), or that he \n6  sometimes texted about business-related matters, see Malone Dep. at 232:1โ233:25, \n7  246:1โ247:25, 251:1โ252:25 (docket no. 108-1).  Donner testified that he knowingly \n8  deleted all of his CHOP-related text messages pursuant to his habit of deleting text \n9  messages shortly after he receives them.  Donner Dep. at 197:6โ200:11 (docket no. 108-\n10  13); Donner Decl. at ยถยถ 12โ14 (docket no. 137) (โEver since I have used a cellphone, I \n11  have had a habit of deleting every text message in a conversation as soon as the \n12  conversation is completed.โ).  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Malone and Donner \n13  spoliated their CHOP-related text messages. \n14  b.  Whether Sanctions are Appropriate \n15  The City asks the Court for an adverse inference instruction as to the Hunters \n16  Capital entities and Richmark Label, and argues that Malone (Hunters Capitalโs CEO) \n17  and Donner (Richmark Labelโs owner) deleted their text messages with the intent to \n18  deprive the City of evidence in this matter.  The Court disagrees.  Although Malone no \n19  longer has any text messages predating March 26, 2021, the day the City informed \n20  Plaintiffsโ Counsel that some of the Cityโs employeesโ text messages were missing, see \n21  Cramer Decl. at ยถ 4 (docket no. 108), Malone declares that he did not learn of issues with \n22  the City officialsโ text messages until after his phone was imaged on May 3, 2021.  \n23 \n  ORDER - 34 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 35 of 38\n \n \n \n1  Malone Decl. at ยถ 12.  Malone contends that he โnever intentionally deleted text \n2  messages that would be relevant to this case or regarding CHOP or that would have been \n3  relevant to the Hunters Capital business.โ  Malone Decl. at ยถ 9.  Although Malone admits \n4  that he sometimes deleted random marketing or spam messages, he denies ever clearing \n5  out his โentire text message historyโ on the phone he used during CHOP.  Id. at ยถยถ 8โ9.  \n6  The Cityโs speculation concerning the coincidental date of March 26, 2021, standing \n7  alone, is insufficient to establish intent. \n8  Similarly, the City has not shown that Donner acted with the requisite intent to \n9  deprive the City of evidence.  Donner testified during his deposition that because he \n10  deletes messages frequently, he deleted any CHOP-related text messages during the \n11  protest or shortly after it concluded on July 1, 2020.  Donner Dep. at 197:9โ198:9 (docket \n12  no. 108-13).  Donner claims that he deleted these messages not to deprive the City of \n13  evidence, but pursuant to his longstanding habit.  Donner Decl. at ยถยถ 12โ14.  Moreover, \n14  the City has not been prejudiced by Donnerโs deleted text messages.  Donner contends \n15  that all of his deleted text messages โwould have only been with personal family and \n16  friends,โ Donner Decl. at ยถ 16, and that he does not use text messages for any business \n17  purpose at Richmark Label, id. at ยถ 15.  Importantly, Richmark Label is a plaintiff in this \n18  action, not Donner, and how Donnerโs text messages about CHOP with his personal \n19  family and friends would support the Cityโs defense against Richmark Labelโs claims is \n20  unclear.  Thus, sanctions for Donnerโs missing messages are not appropriate. \n21  The City, however, has been prejudiced by Maloneโs missing text messages.  \n22  Although some of Maloneโs messages about CHOP included messages with Hunters \n23 \n  ORDER - 35 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 36 of 38\n \n \n \n1  Capitalโs co-owner Jill Cronauer and Hunter Capitalโs employee Michael Oaksmith, see \n2  Malone Decl. at ยถ 10 (docket no. 127), both of whom produced text messages in this case, \n3  id., only some of Maloneโs text messages from before March 26, 2021, have been \n4  recreated.  The Court cannot ignore that many of Maloneโs messages are still missing.  \n5  Further, the Hunters Capital entities claim $2.9 million in damages in this action.  See \n6  Def.โs Mot. (docket no. 107 at 5).  Because of Maloneโs missing text messages, the Court \n7  finds that the City will have to rely on โincomplete and spottyโ evidence at trial with \n8  respect to the Hunters Capital entitiesโ claims.  See Skyline Advanced Tech. Servs. v. \n9  Shafer, No. 18-cv-06641, 2020 WL 13093877, at *10 (N.D. Cal. July 14, 2020) (quoting \n10  Leon, 464 F.3d at 959).  Because the City has suffered prejudice with respect to Maloneโs \n11  text messages, the Cityโs motion for sanctions is GRANTED in part, and the Court will \n12  permit the City to present evidence and argument at trial about Maloneโs missing text \n13  messages.  The City is also awarded attorneysโ fees and costs incurred as a result of \n14  Maloneโs spoliation of evidence.15 \n15  Conclusion \n16  For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS: \n17 \n18 \n \n19 \n15 The Cityโs request that the Court re-open discovery for a limited period is DENIED.  The City initially \n20 \nalleged that Hunters Capitalโs co-owner Jill Cronauer failed to produce certain emails and text messages.  \nBecause Plaintiffs have since produced responsive messages and emails, the City has withdrawn the \n21  portion of its motion related to Cronauer.  See Def.โs Reply (docket no. 153 at 4 n.1). \n \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 36 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 37 of 38\n \n \n \n1  (1)  Plaintiffsโ motion for spoliation sanctions, docket no. 104, is GRANTED in \n2  part and DENIED in part.  The Court will instruct the jury that it may presume that the \n3  City officialsโ text messages (deleted after Plaintiffs commenced this action) were \n4  unfavorable to the City, and Plaintiffs will be allowed to present evidence and argument \n5  at trial regarding the Cityโs deletion of the text messages.  Plaintiffs are AWARDED \n6  attorneysโ fees and costs (including expert-related costs) incurred as a result of the Cityโs \n7  spoliation of evidence.  Except as GRANTED, Plaintiffsโ motion and all other requested \n8  remedies are DENIED. \n9  (2)  The Cityโs motion for spoliation sanctions, docket no. 107, is GRANTED \n10  in part and DENIED in part.  The City will be allowed to present evidence and argument \n11  at trial regarding Maloneโs missing text messages, and the City is AWARDED attorneysโ \n12  fees and costs incurred as a result of the Hunters Capital entitiesโ spoliation of evidence.  \n13  Except as GRANTED, the Cityโs motion and all other requested remedies are DENIED. \n14  (3)   On or before Thursday, February 16, 2023, the parties shall file \n15  (i) declarations reciting the amount of attorneysโ fees and costs incurred in seeking the \n16  spoliated text messages, and (ii) the documentation necessary to support such amounts, \n17  and they shall note their filings for the Courtโs consideration no later than the third Friday \n18  thereafter.16  The parties may file any responses or replies in accordance with LCR 7(d). \n19  (4)  The Clerk is directed to send a copy of this Order to all counsel of record. \n20 \n \n21 \n16 The Cityโs declaration shall be limited to the amount it incurred seeking missing text messages from \nHunters Capitalโs founder Michael Malone. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 37 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 166   Filed 01/13/23   Page 38 of 38\n \n \n \n1  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n2  Dated this 13th day of January, 2023. \n3 \nA\n \n4 \nThomas S.

Having reviewed all \n21  papers filed in support of, and in opposition to, the motion, and having considered the \n22  oral arguments of counsel, the Court enters the following Order. \n23 \n  ORDER - 1 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 2 of 39\n \n \n \n1  Background \n2  This lawsuit arises from the Cityโs alleged โsupport, encouragement, and \n3  endorsementโ of the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (โCHOPโ) from June 8, 2020, until \n4  July 1, 2020.  See Third Amended Complaint (โTACโ) at ยถยถ 10, 36, 52 (docket no. 47).  \n5  Plaintiffs are local property owners, businesses, and residents who allege that the Cityโs \n6  response to CHOP violated their legal rights.  The City considered CHOP as occurring \n7  within the approximately 16-block area in Seattleโs Capitol Hill neighborhood bounded \n8  by East Denny Way (to the north), Thirteenth Avenue (to the east), East Pike Street (to \n9  the south), and Broadway (to the west).

In the \n16  evening hours of May 29, 2020, a demonstration that began in Seattleโs Chinatown-\n17  International District turned violent when some protesters โwound through downtown \n18  streets, smashing windows and hurling debris and fireworks at [Seattle Police Department \n19  (โSPDโ)] officers.โ  Id.; Durkan Dep. at 97:1โ98:5, Ex. 3 to Cramer Decl.

Emergency, Ex. 5 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 112-5).  In \n6  the following days, protesters began to focus their activity around Cal Anderson Park and \n7  SPDโs East Precinct in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, resulting in a significant number of \n8  โclashesโ between police and protesters near the East Precinct.1  Mahaffey Dep. at 74:3โ\n9  6, Ex. 6 to Cramer Decl.

Mayor Durkan and members of her staff also visited the area multiple times \n5  between June 8 and July 1, 2020.  See Durkan Dep. at 92:22โ93:9, Ex. 10 to Weaver \n6  Decl. (docket no. 125-10).  According to Mayor Durkan, โeveryoneโs goal from the \n7  beginning was to reduce the number of barriers, to reduce the profile of the area where \n8  people were in the protests, and to provide access to that area for businesses, for \n9  residents, for first responders and the like.โ  Durkan Dep. at 39:5โ9 (docket no. 112-3).  \n10  The Cityโs goal was โto de-escalate the situationโ and โbalance the public interest \n11  of . . . protecting business and residents[,] . . . protecting the First Amendment rights of \n12  people[,] protecting the first responders, and do it all during a global pandemic.โ  Id. at \n13  57:16โ20.  The City also desired to maintain โthe existing footprint of peaceful \n14  demonstration and rights.โ  Ex. 14 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 125-14). \n15  On June 10, 2020, SDOT revised traffic patterns around the East Precinct so that \n16  City services could access buildings in the affected area.  See Ex. 11 to Cramer Decl. \n17  (docket no. 112-11); Ex. 12 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 112-12).  SDOT also worked to \n18  develop a traffic control plan โthat would meet all of the Cityโs and the adjacent property \n19  ownersโ needs for services and property access.โ  Zimbabwe Dep. at 34:1โ8 (docket \n20  no. 112-10).  Some streets near the East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park, however, \n21  remained closed to vehicular traffic between June 8 and July 1, 2020.  See id. at 36:11โ18 \n22  (explaining that East Pine Street remained closed between 10th and 11th Avenues for the \n23 \n  ORDER - 5 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 6 of 39\n \n \n \n1  duration of CHOP).  To maintain separation between vehicles and protesters, SDOT \n2  placed between 50 and 100 concrete ecology blocks along the streets and sidewalks.2  Id. \n3  at 37:4โ10.  SDOT also installed plywood covers over the ecology blocks to provide a \n4  โcanvasโ for protestersโ art and prevent protesters from tampering with the metal rings \n5  used to lift the blocks.

Specifically, SPD personnel would respond to \n3  calls for service within the Red Zone only to address โmass casualtyโ events or โcritical \n4  life safetyโ emergencies such as active shooter incidents and structural fires likely to \n5  endanger human life.  See id.; Mahaffey Dep. at 26:1โ27:15 (docket no. 112-6).  For \n6  other service calls within the Red Zone, the City directed communications section \n7  personnel to coordinate officer contact outside the zone.  Ex. 3 to Weaver Decl.

See Executive Order 2020-08, Ex. 7 \n5  to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 125-7).

Under Federal Rule of Civil \n10  Procedure 56, the City now moves for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffsโ claims. \n11  Discussion \n12  1.  Summary Judgment Standard \n13  The Court shall grant summary judgment if no genuine issue of material fact exists \n14  and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \n15  The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue \n16  of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  A fact is material if \n17 \n \n18 \n5 Hunters Capital, Hunters Property Holdings, and the Greenus Building are referred to collectively as the \nโHunters Capital entities.โ  Madrona Real Estate Services, Madrona Investors IV, Madrona Investors VI, \n19 \nand 12th and Pike Associates are referred to collectively as the โMadrona entities.โ \n20 \n6 Plaintiffs previously sought class certification for the property owners, business owners, and residents in \nthe area bounded by East Denny Way, Thirteenth Avenue, East Pike Street, and Broadway.  The Court \n21  denied class certification in this action because the particular issues Plaintiffs desired to certify did not \nsatisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2) and (3), \nor the predominance and superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(3).  See Order (docket no. 96). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 11 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 12 of 39\n \n \n \n1  it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.  Anderson v. Liberty \n2  Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  To survive a motion for summary judgment, the \n3  adverse party must present affirmative evidence, which โis to be believedโ and from \n4  which all โjustifiable inferencesโ are to be favorably drawn.  Id. at 255, 257.  When the \n5  record, however, taken as a whole, could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the \n6  non-moving party, summary judgment is warranted.  See Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, \n7  529 (2006) (โRule 56 โmandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for \n8  discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to \n9  establish the existence of an element essential to that partyโs case, and on which that \n10  party will bear the burden of proof at trial.โโ (quoting Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322)). \n11  2.  First and Second Causes of Action:  Due Process \n12  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution โprotects individuals \n13  against the deprivation of liberty or property by the government without due process.โ  \n14  Portman v. County of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993); U.S. CONST. \n15  amend XIV.  The Due Process Clause does not create substantive rights in property.  \n16  Rather, the property rights are determined by reference to state law.  Plaintiffs allege in \n17  this case that the City caused them a deprivation of liberty and property rights under \n18  Washington law, and they make their due process claims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and the \n19  United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs seek recovery under both the (a) procedural and \n20  (b) substantive components of the Due Process Clause.   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 12 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 13 of 39\n \n \n \n1  a.  Procedural Due Process \n2  Plaintiffsโ first cause of action relates to an alleged violation of procedural due \n3  process.  Plaintiffs claim that the City violated their procedural due process rights by \n4  depriving them of constitutionally protected interests without first providing them notice \n5  or an opportunity to be heard.  TAC at ยถยถ 188โ96.  Plaintiffs contend that the City \n6  infringed on their constitutionally protected interests in the โright of free movement and \n7  the right to remain in a public place of oneโs choosingโ by granting โde facto autonomy \n8  over the CHOP areaโ to the protesters.  TAC at ยถยถ 191โ92. \n9  To prevail on a procedural due process claim, a ยง 1983 plaintiff must establish \n10  (i) โa liberty or property interest protected by the Constitution,โ (ii) โa deprivation of the \n11  interest by the government,โ and (iii) โlack of process.โ  Portman, 995 F.2d at 904.  The \n12  City argues that Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim fails because the conduct they \n13  challenge, an executive policy implemented in response to protests throughout the \n14  Capitol Hill neighborhood, is not โthe type of government action to which due process \n15  applies.โ  See Harris v. County of Riverside, 904 F.2d 497, 501 (9th Cir. 1990).  Indeed, \n16  โ[w]here a rule of conduct applies to more than a few people, it is impracticable that \n17  everyone should have a direct voice in its adoption.โ  Bi-Metallic Inv. Co. v. State Bd. of \n18  Equalization, 239 U.S. 441, 445 (1915). \n19  In Harris, for example, a county zoning change affected only plaintiff and the \n20  adjacent landowner.  904 F.2d at 502.  The Ninth Circuit explained that procedural due \n21  process was required because the county โspecifically targetedโ plaintiffโs property.  Id. \n22  (explaining that the zoning change โconcerned a relatively small number of personsโ).  In \n23 \n  ORDER - 13 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 14 of 39\n \n \n \n1  contrast, in Halverson v. Skagit County, 42 F.3d 1257, 1258 (9th Cir. 1994), the Ninth \n2  Circuit recognized โthat governmental decisions which affect large areas and are not \n3  directed at one or a few individuals do not give rise to the constitutional procedural due \n4  process requirements of individual notice and hearing; general notice as provided by law \n5  is sufficient.โ  Id. at 1261; see also Flint v. County of Kauai, 521 F. Supp. 3d 978, 994 \n6  (D. Haw. 2021) (finding no procedural due process violation when county enacted an \n7  โemergency ruleโ temporarily limiting access to a particular area which had been \n8  damaged by flooding).  \n9  In this case, Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence showing that they were \n10  specifically targeted by the Cityโs conduct in response to CHOP.  Although Plaintiffs \n11  estimate that the CHOP area (bounded by East Denny Way, Thirteenth Avenue, East Pike \n12  Street, and Broadway) comprises only 0.094% of the Cityโs total physical area and 0.54% \n13  of the Cityโs population, Weaver Decl. at ยถยถ 46โ47 (docket no. 125), Plaintiffs do not \n14  dispute that thousands of people lived in the CHOP area in 2020, id. at ยถ 47.  Despite \n15  Plaintiffsโ argument that the Cityโs actions in response to CHOP affected a small, easily \n16  identifiable group, some plaintiffs, such as the Hunters Capital and Madrona entities, \n17  claim damages for buildings several blocks away from the CHOP area.  See App. A to \n18  Def.โs Mot. (docket no. 111).  The record demonstrates that the Cityโs executive actions \n19  in response to CHOP do not give rise to the constitutional requirements of individual \n20  hearing and notice because the actions were of general applicability and not directed at \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 14 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 15 of 39\n \n \n \n1  one or a few individuals or businesses.7  Accordingly, the Cityโs motion for summary \n2  judgment is GRANTED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim and \n3  Plaintiffsโ first cause of action is DISMISSED with prejudice. \n4  b.  Substantive Due Process \n5  Plaintiffsโ second cause of action alleges a violation of the Due Process Clauseโs \n6  substantive component.  Substantive due process prohibits โcertain arbitrary, wrongful \n7  government actions โregardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement \n8  them.โโ  Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990) (citation omitted).  The right to \n9  substantive due process protects individuals from arbitrary and irrational government \n10  interference with their property rights.  See Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, \n11  544 (2005).  Plaintiffs contend that they have a right โto be protected from state-created \n12  dangersโ and the Cityโs assistance and encouragement of CHOP โgreatly increased the \n13  likelihood of property damage, loss of business revenue and rental income, personal \n14  injury, loss of use of property, and other damages.โ  TAC at ยถยถ 198โ99.  Importantly, \n15  however, โnothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to \n16  protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.โ  \n17  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 (1989).  Rather, \n18 \n \n19 \n7 The parties agree that the Cityโs CHOP-related actions were executive and not legislative acts.  \n20 \nNevertheless, the distinction between legislative and executive action does not demand a different result \nin this matter.  See Calm Ventures LLC v. Newsom, 548 F. Supp. 3d 966, 982โ83 (C.D. Cal. 2021) \n21  (finding that the California Governorโs COVID-related executive orders were โprecisely the types of \ngovernment action permitted in responseโ to a public health emergency and were of general \napplicability).   \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 15 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 16 of 39\n \n \n \n1  the Due Process Clause โis a limitation on state action and is not a โguarantee of certain \n2  minimal levels of safety and security.โโ  Martinez v. City of Clovis, 943 F.3d 1260, 1271 \n3  (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 195).  The governmentโs mere failure โto \n4  prevent acts of a private party is insufficient to establish liability.โ  Id.; see also Patel v. \n5  Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n6  Plaintiffs rely solely on one exception to this general rule, the โstate-created \n7  dangerโ exception.  See Pls.โ Resp. (docket no. 124 at 25โ31).  Under the state-created \n8  danger exception, the government is liable on a substantive due process claim when it \n9  โaffirmatively placesโ a plaintiff in danger by acting with โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a \n10  โknown or obvious danger.โ  Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1271 (citing Patel, 648 F.3d at 971โ\n11  72).  To prevail under this exception, Plaintiffs must show (i) the Cityโs affirmative \n12  actions created or exposed them to an actual, particularized danger that they would not \n13  otherwise have faced, (ii) they suffered a foreseeable injury, and (iii) the City was \n14  deliberately indifferent to the known danger.  See id.  For the reasons discussed below, \n15  Plaintiffs fail to make this showing. \n16  i.  Actual, Particularized Danger \n17  Plaintiffs allege that the Cityโs action, assistance, endorsement, and \n18  encouragement of CHOP exposed them to the dangers of โproperty damage, loss of \n19  business revenue and rental income, personal injury, and loss of use of property.โ  TAC \n20  at ยถ 199.  In determining whether the City exposed Plaintiffs to an actual, particularized \n21  danger they would not have otherwise faced, the Court considers โwhether [the City] left \n22  [Plaintiffs] in a situation that was more dangerous than the one in which [the City] found \n23 \n  ORDER - 16 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 17 of 39\n \n \n \n1  [them].โ  See Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1271 (quoting Munger v. City of Glasgow Police \n2  Depโt, 227 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 2000)).  For example, in Munger, police officers left \n3  a man in a more dangerous position than the one in which they found him when they \n4  ejected him from a bar, wearing only jeans and a t-shirt, into subfreezing winter weather, \n5  where he later died of hypothermia.  227 F.3d at 1085, 1087.  Similarly, in Wood v. \n6  Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 586 (9th Cir. 1989), a state trooper placed a woman in a \n7  position of danger when he impounded the vehicle in which she was a passenger and \n8  abandoned her in a high-crime area where she was subsequently raped.   \n9  In contrast, in Johnson v. City of Seattle, 474 F.3d 634, 637 (9th Cir. 2007), \n10  defendant police officers did not expose plaintiffs to a danger they would otherwise not \n11  have faced.  There, plaintiffs were injured in a large crowd during a Mardi Gras \n12  celebration in Seattle that turned violent.  Id. at 636โ37.  The Ninth Circuit concluded \n13  that the stated-created danger exception did not apply because plaintiffs had not shown \n14  that defendants โengaged in affirmative conduct that enhanced the dangers [plaintiffs] \n15  exposed themselves to by participatingโ in the celebration.  Id. at 641.  The Johnson \n16  Court explained that the Cityโs decision during the Mardi Gras celebration to switch from \n17  an aggressive to a passive operational plan did not place plaintiffs โin any worse position \n18  than they would have been in had the police not come up with any operational plan \n19  whatsoever.โ  Id.  \n20  White v. City of Minneapolis, No. 21-cv-0371, 2021 WL 5964554 (D. Min. \n21  Dec. 16, 2021) is also instructive.  There, residents and business owners in Minneapolisโs \n22  Third Precinct alleged that municipal defendants failed to sufficiently deploy law \n23 \n  ORDER - 17 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 18 of 39\n \n \n \n1  enforcement personnel in response to large protests following George Floydโs murder, \n2  resulting in significant property damage and civil unrest.  Id. at *1.  The district court \n3  granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants, explaining that plaintiffs had \n4  failed to plausibly establish that they were members of a โlimited, precisely definable \n5  group.โ8  Id. at *6.  The district court in White concluded that a group consisting of \n6  โresidents and business owners in the Third Precinctโ was โfairly understood to be the \n7  general public,โ id., however, the โgeneral public is not a limited, precisely definable \n8  groupโ for the purposes of the state-created danger exception, id. (quoting Glasgow v. \n9  Nebraska, 819 F.3d 436, 442 (8th Cir. 2016)). \n10  In this case, Plaintiffs have produced no evidence that the City exposed them to \n11  any actual danger they would not have otherwise faced.  The Cityโs decision to provide \n12  sanitation services, see Hara Dep. at 26:10โ20, 27:10โ22, 32:22โ33:8, 70:7โ20 (docket \n13  no. 112-15); Durkan Dep. at 199:1โ4 (docket no. 112-3), and establish a traffic plan in \n14  the area, see Zimbabwe Dep. at 34:1โ8 (docket no. 112-10), did not place Plaintiffs in a \n15  more dangerous situation than they would have faced had the City not intervened.  \n16  Indeed, the record demonstrates that police and protesters in the area engaged in violent \n17  โnightly clashesโ immediately before CHOPโs formation.  See Mahaffey Dep. at 74:3โ6 \n18 \n \n19 \n8 The Eighth Circuit employs a five-part test to determine whether the state-created danger exception \napplies.  A plaintiff must prove (i) โthat she was a member of a limited, precisely definable group,โ \n20 \n(ii) โthat the municipalityโs conduct put her at a significant risk of serious, immediate, and proximate \nharm,โ (iii) โthat the risk was obvious or known to the municipality,โ (iv) โthat the municipality acted \n21  recklessly in conscious disregard of the risk,โ and (v) โthat in total, the municipalityโs conduct shocks the \nconscience.โ  White, 2021 WL 5964554, at *5 (quoting Fields v. Abbott, 652 F.3d 886, 891 (8th Cir. \n1996)). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 18 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 19 of 39\n \n \n \n1  (docket no. 112-6); Durkan Dep. at 96:21โ25 (docket no. 112-3).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \n2  have presented no evidence that the danger to which the City allegedly exposed them was \n3  particularized.  Ninth Circuit cases finding triable issues of state-created danger involve \n4  state actors increasing the risk of harm for particular individuals.  See Martinez, 943 F.3d \n5  at 1272; Munger, 227 F.3d at 1085; Wood, 879 F.2d at 586.  The evidence in this case \n6  demonstrates that the City took affirmative actions with respect to a dynamic situation \n7  occurring in Seattleโs Capitol Hill neighborhood, i.e., a situation affecting the general \n8  public.  Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that the Cityโs affirmative conduct created \n9  or exposed them to an actual, particularized danger they would not have otherwise faced. \n10  ii.  Foreseeability \n11  In the context of the state-created danger exception, foreseeability โdoes not mean \n12  that the exact injury must be foreseeable.โ  Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1273.  โRather, โthe \n13  state actor is liable for creating the foreseeable danger of injury given the particular \n14  circumstances.โโ  Id. at 1273โ74 (quoting Kennedy v. City of Ridgefield, 439 F.3d 1055, \n15  1064 n.5 (9th Cir. 2006)).  The state-created danger exception typically involves state \n16  actors, such as law enforcement personnel, increasing the risk of harm for certain \n17  individuals.  See Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1272; Munger, 227 F.3d at 1085; Wood, 879 F.2d \n18  at 586.  Phrased differently, cases finding triable issues of state-created danger involve \n19  governmental conduct that distinguishes a plaintiff from the general public.  See Wood, \n20  870 F.2d at 590 (โThe fact that [the state trooper] . . . apparently stranded [plaintiff] in a \n21  high-crime area at 2:30 a.m. distinguishes [plaintiff] from the general public and triggers \n22  a duty of the police to afford her some measure of peace and safety.โ).  \n23 \n  ORDER - 19 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 20 of 39\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs have presented some evidence that the Cityโs actions in response to \n2  CHOP increased criminal activity in the CHOP area.  Chief Best, for example, agreed \n3  that it was โcertainly foreseeable that there was increased violence and crimeโ and that \n4  the provision of portable toilets and other services would entice individuals to stay near \n5  the East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park.  See Best Dep. at 196:10โ23, 117:15โ118:1 \n6  (docket no. 125-6).  Mayor Durkan also expressed her thoughts concerning foreseeability \n7  in an email she sent to Chiefs Best and Scoggins following the shooting death of a \n8  teenager in the CHOP zone.9  See Ex. 33 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 125-33) (โWhat \n9  happened this am [sic] was foreseeable and avoidable.โ).  Thus, Plaintiffs have \n10  demonstrated some factual issues regarding foreseeability. \n11  iii.  Deliberate Indifference \n12  Deliberate indifference is โa stringent standard of fault,โ Patel, 648 F.3d at 974, \n13  requiring proof of a culpable mental state, Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1274.  Proof of gross \n14  negligence is insufficient to establish deliberate indifference.  Id. (citing Patel, 648 F.3d \n15  at 974).  Plaintiffs must show that the City recognized โan unreasonable riskโ and \n16  โactually intend[ed] to exposeโ Plaintiffs โto such risks without regard to the \n17  consequenceโ to them by providing services to CHOP participants for a three-week \n18  period.  See Patel, 648 F.3d at 974 (quoting L.W. v. Grubbs, 92 F.3d 894, 899 (9th Cir. \n19  1996)).  โIn other words, the defendant โknows that something is going to happen but \n20   \n21  9 The parties dispute the meaning of this email.  Mayor Durkan alleges that her statement in the email \nrefers to her understanding at the time that SPD and SFD did not have a joint plan to respond to the \nshooting, not that the shooting itself was foreseeable.  Durkan Dep. at 65:14โ67:2 (docket no. 112-3). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 20 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 21 of 39\n \n \n \n1  ignores the risk and exposes [the plaintiff] to it.โโ  Id. (alteration and emphasis in original, \n2  quoting L.W., 92 F.3d at 900). \n3  Notably, this action does not fit the framework of a typical state-created danger \n4  case, where state actors select a bad option despite the availability of better alternatives.  \n5  See, e.g., Munger, 227 F.3d at 1084โ85 (ejecting man from a bar into subfreezing winter \n6  weather instead of taking him into custody); Wood, 870 F.2d at 590 (abandoning woman \n7  in a dangerous area instead of ensuring her ability to get safely home).  Unlike the typical \n8  state-created danger case, the record in the present matter shows that the City made a \n9  conscious effort to balance multiple competing objectives for the duration of CHOP, such \n10  as protestersโ First Amendment rights, public safety in the area, and sanitation services to \n11  combat the spread of COVID and other diseases.  See Durkan Dep. at 75:6โ13, 199:1โ4 \n12  (docket no. 112-3); Zimbabwe Dep. at 37:11โ40:12 (docket no. 125-5); Hara Dep. at \n13  26:10โ20, 27:10โ22, 32:22โ33:8, 70:7โ20 (docket no. 112-15).  Plaintiffs have presented \n14  no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the City acted with \n15  deliberate indifference to expose Plaintiffs to certain unreasonable risks, and actually \n16  intended to expose them to such risks, without regard to the consequences to them.  Thus, \n17  the Cityโs motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ \n18  substantive due process claim and their second cause of action is DISMISSED with \n19  prejudice. \n20  3.  Third Cause of Action:  Taking \n21  The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies to local governments \n22  through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: โ[N]or shall private property be taken for \n23 \n  ORDER - 21 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 22 of 39\n \n \n \n1  public use, without just compensation.โ  U.S. CONST. amend. V.  To prove a taking, each \n2  plaintiff must establish a protected property interest under Washington law.10  See \n3  Vandevere v. Lloyd, 644 F.3d 957, 963 (9th Cir. 2011).  In this case, Plaintiffs have \n4  limited their takings claims to two theories of liability:  (a) the City temporarily deprived \n5  them of the right to exclude others from their properties (the per se taking claim); and \n6  (b) the City temporarily deprived them of the right to access their properties (the right of \n7  access taking claim).11 \n8  a.  Per Se Taking \n9  The right to exclude is a โfundamental element of the property right,โ Kaiser \n10  Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 179โ80 (1979), and not โan empty formality, \n11  subject to modification at the governmentโs pleasure,โ Cedar Point, 141 S. Ct. at 2077.  \n12  Because physical invasions of property constitute โthe clearest sort of taking,โ Palazzolo \n13  v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 617 (2001), the government has a โcategorical duty to \n14  compensateโ a property owner when it โphysically takes possession of an interest in \n15  property for some public purpose,โ Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regโl Plan. \n16  Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 322 (2002).  Importantly, โ[a] physical appropriation is a taking \n17 \n \n18  10 Plaintiff Redside Partners does not oppose the Cityโs motion for summary judgment as it relates to \nRedside Partnersโ taking claim.  Pls.โ Resp. (docket no. 124 at 31 n.34).  Accordingly, the motion is \nGRANTED as it relates to Redside Partnersโ third cause of action for taking, and the cause of action is \n19 \nDISMISSED with prejudice. \n20 \n11 Plaintiffs conceded during oral argument that they do not allege a โregulatory taking.โ  A regulatory \ntaking occurs when the government โimposes regulations that restrict an ownerโs ability to use his own \n21  property,โ Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 141 S. Ct. 2063, 2071 (2021), such as the New York City \nLandmarks Preservation Law at issue in Penn Central Transportation Company v. City of New York, 438 \nU.S. 104 (1978). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 22 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 23 of 39\n \n \n \n1  whether it is permanent or temporary,โ Cedar Point, 141 S. Ct. at 2074, and โ[t]he \n2  duration of an appropriation . . . bears only on the amount of compensation,โ id.   \n3  The Supreme Court has recognized that the government might be liable for a \n4  physical taking if it authorizes a third-party physical invasion of property.  See Cedar \n5  Point, 141 S. Ct. at 2072โ76.  But Plaintiffsโ heavy reliance on Cedar Point is misplaced.  \n6  In Cedar Point, a California regulation granted union organizers the right to enter private \n7  farmland.  Id. at 2072.  In holding that the state had effected a temporary physical taking \n8  of the growerโs property, the Supreme Court confirmed that โ[w]henever a regulation \n9  results in a physical appropriation of property, a per se taking has occurred.โ  Id.; see also \n10  Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 435 (1982) (holding that \n11  a statute effected a taking where it authorized a third party to install cable equipment on \n12  private apartment buildings).  The government, however, cannot be held liable for a \n13  taking โwhen whatever acts complained ofโ are the independent actions of private parties.  \n14  Alves v. United States, 133 F.3d 1454, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1998). \n15  Here, Plaintiffs do not allege that the City itself physically invaded their \n16  properties.  Rather, Plaintiffs contend that the City authorized third-party physical \n17  invasions.  See, e.g., Augustine Decl. at ยถยถ 7, 10 (docket no. 132) (explaining that \n18  squatters resided in one of the Madrona entitiesโ buildings until August or September \n19  2020); Thompson Decl. at ยถยถ 7, 10 (docket no. 135) (alleging that a protester entered \n20  Bergmanโs Lock and Key to defecate); McDermott Dep. at 226:8โ248:9, Ex. 26 to \n21  Weaver Decl. (docket no. 125-26) (describing how a protester unlawfully entered Car \n22  Tenderโs property).  Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that the City expressly \n23 \n  ORDER - 23 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 24 of 39\n \n \n \n1  authorized any of the third-party physical invasions at issue in this case.12  Unlike in \n2  Cedar Point and Loretto, the City did not adopt a regulation or ordinance granting \n3  protesters a โformal entitlementโ to enter Plaintiffsโ properties.  See Cedar Point, 141 S. \n4  Ct. at 2079โ80 (โUnlike a mere trespass, [Californiaโs] regulation grants a formal \n5  entitlement to physically invade the growersโ land.โ).  Accordingly, the Cityโs motion for \n6  summary judgment is GRANTED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ per se theory of liability.  \n7  b.  Right of Access Taking \n8  An ownerโs right of access to his or her property is recognized in Washington.  \n9  Keiffer v. King County, 89 Wn.2d 369, 372โ73, 572 P.2d 408 (1977) (โThe right of \n10  access of an abutting property owner to a public right-of-way is a property right which if \n11  taken or damaged for a public use requires compensation.โ).  To establish a taking under \n12  this theory of liability, Plaintiffs must show that access to their properties was eliminated \n13  or substantially impaired.  Pande Cameron & Co. of Seattle, Inc. v. Cent. Puget Sound \n14  Regโl Transit Auth., 610 F. Supp. 2d 1288, 1303 (W.D. Wash. 2009) (citing Keiffer, 89 \n15 \n \n16 \n12 In its amicus brief, Pacific Legal Foundation (โPLFโ) argues that a governmental entity is liable for a \ntaking when it โknows or should know that its actions would result in third-party damage to, or trespass \n17 \nagainst, private property.โ  Amicus Curiae Br. (docket no. 148-1).  In support of this proposition, PLF \nrelies on Arkansas Game & Fish Commission v. United States, 736 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  There, \n18  the Army Corps of Engineers temporarily increased the amount of water it released from a dam, causing \nflooding in a particular wildlife management area.  Id. at 1367โ69.  Although the United States did not \nintend to flood the wildlife management area, the Federal Circuit explained that a taking occurs if a \n19 \nphysical invasion is the โforeseeable or predictable resultโ of the governmentโs conduct.  Id. at 1372.  \nNotably, Arkansas Game & Fish Commission involves direct government action (releasing water from a \n20 \ndam).  The case does not address whether the government is liable for third-party physical invasions \nwhich it did not expressly authorize, and PLF has not cited any authority that would support the Cityโs \n21  liability for a per se taking under the circumstances in the present matter.  Similarly, Plaintiffs have not \ncited any cases that support their per se theory of taking liability, and, despite the opportunity to do so, \nsee Minute Order (docket no. 150), Plaintiffs did not submit any brief in response to PLFโs amicus brief. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 24 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 25 of 39\n \n \n \n1  Wn.2d at 373).  In Washington, courts employ a two-step process to determine whether \n2  government impairment of access requires compensation.  The first step โis to determine \n3  if the government action in question has actually interfered with the right of access as that \n4  property interest has been defined byโ Washington law.  Keiffer, 89 Wn.2d at 372โ73.  \n5  The second step is to determine whether the degree of impairment was substantial; a \n6  question of fact.  Id. at 373โ74.   \n7  Importantly, a right of access taking claim is not without limit.  Government \n8  actions โtaken pursuant to the police power for the purpose of regulating the flow of \n9  traffic on the public way itself are generally not compensable.โ  Id. at 372.  Plaintiffs \n10  must show โmore than mere inconvenience at having to travel a further distance to [their] \n11  business facilit[ies].โ  See Union Elevator & Warehouse v. State, 96 Wash. App. 288, \n12  296, 980 P.2d 779 (1999).  If โthe landowner still retains an alternate mode of egress \n13  from or ingress to his land, even if less convenient, generally speaking he is not deemed \n14  specially damaged.โ  Hoskins v. City of Kirkland, 7 Wn. App. 957, 960โ61, 503 P.2d \n15  1117 (1972); see also Pande Cameron, 610 F. Supp. 2d at 1303โ04 (holding that \n16  โintermittent inconveniencesโ related to a tunnel construction project did not rise to the \n17  level of a constitutional taking).  \n18  In this case, the parties do not dispute that some plaintiffs were able to access their \n19  properties during CHOP.13  See, e.g., Thompson Dep. at 77:4โ14, Ex. 28 to Cramer Decl. \n20   \n21  13 In contrast, other plaintiffs contend that access to their properties was temporarily eliminated.  See, e.g., \nPloszaj Dep. at 145:13โ20, Ex. 7 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 112-7) (explaining that he could not access \nhis building by car). The City argues in a footnote, without citation to any authority, that lessees such as \n22 \nPloszaj do not have a property interest for the purposes of a โright of accessโ taking claim because they \n23 \n  ORDER - 25 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 26 of 39\n \n \n \n1  (docket no. 112-28) (Bergmanโs Lock and Key) (explaining that the storefront was not \n2  physically blocked); Sheffer Dep. at 193:18โ22, Ex. 29 to Cramer Decl.

Plaintiffs allege, however, that access to their properties was \n9  significantly diminished or impaired during the CHOP period.  See, e.g., Wanagel Decl. \n10  at ยถยถ 2โ3 (docket no. 130) (Olive St Apartments) (explaining that access to the building \n11  was diminished due to the placement of barriers in the area); Augustine Decl. at ยถ 3 \n12  (docket no. 132) (Madrona entities) (explaining that the streets adjacent to the Madrona \n13  entitiesโ properties had diminished access); Sheffer Decl. at ยถยถ 4โ6 (docket no. 133) \n14  (Cure Cocktail) (explaining that, at times, the only way to access Cure Cocktail was to \n15  drive through an allegedly unsafe alley); Donner Decl. at ยถยถ 6โ8 (docket no. 137) \n16  (Richmark Label) (explaining that some third-party delivery drivers refused to come to \n17  the CHOP area and how Richmark Label employees often had to negotiate with \n18  protesters to move barriers in the street).14   \n19 \n \n20 \ndo not own property abutting a public right-of-way.

Vt. 2020) (citing Alamo Land & Cattle Co., Inc. v. Arizona, 424 U.S. 295, 303 (1976)). \n14 The City argues that the Court should not consider certain plaintiffsโ declarations, docket nos. 130 \n22 \nthrough 138, to the extent that the declarations contradict these plaintiffsโ prior deposition testimony.  See \n23 \n  ORDER - 26 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 27 of 39\n \n \n \n1  This action does not involve the typical exercise of police power to regulate the \n2  flow of traffic in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, such as for routine road maintenance or \n3  construction.  Further, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that the Cityโs actions actually \n4  interfered with or prevented their access to their properties.  Drawing all justifiable \n5  inferences from the evidence in Plaintiffsโ favor, the Court concludes that genuine \n6  disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ right of access theory \n7  of liability.  The Court therefore DENIES the Cityโs motion as it relates to Plaintiffsโ \n8  right of access taking claim.  Whether Plaintiffs can present sufficient evidence at trial to \n9  support the Cityโs liability for a taking under these circumstances is a factual issue that \n10  cannot be resolved on a motion for summary judgment.  \n11  4.  Fourth Cause of Action:  Negligence \n12  The City argues that Plaintiffsโ negligence claim fails as a matter of law because \n13  the City did not owe them a duty under traditional negligence principles.  Under \n14  Washington law, a plaintiff must prove four elements to prevail on a negligence claim:  \n15  (i) โthe existence of a dutyโ; (ii) โa breach of that dutyโ; (iii) โa resulting injuryโ; and \n16  (iv) โthe breach as the proximate cause of the injury.โ  Ehrhart v. King County, 195 \n17  Wn.2d 388, 396, 460 P.3d 612 (2020).  โWhen the defendant in a negligence action is a \n18  governmental entity, the public duty doctrine provides that a plaintiff must show the duty \n19  breached was owed to him or her in particular, and was not . . . an obligation owed to the \n20   \n21  Yeager v. Bowlin, 693 F.3d 1076, 1080 (9th Cir. 2012).  The declarations, however, do not appear to \nconflict with any plaintiffsโ prior deposition testimony.  Rather, the declarations clarify the extent of \nCHOPโs alleged interference with certain plaintiffsโ ability to access their properties. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 27 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 28 of 39\n \n \n \n1  public in general.โ  Munich v. Skagit Emergency Commcโn Ctr., 175 Wn.2d 871, 878, \n2  288 P.3d 328 (2012).  In essence, โa duty owed to all is a duty owed to none.โ  Id.  The \n3  public duty doctrine serves as a โfocusing toolโ to ensure that governmental entities are \n4  โnot held liable in tort for duties owed solely to the general public.โ  Beltran-Serrano v. \n5  City of Tacoma, 193 Wn.2d 537, 549, 442 P.3d 608 (2019).  Washington courts recognize \n6  four exceptions to this doctrine, see Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 400, but Plaintiffs rely only \n7  on the โfailure-to-enforceโ exception.  See Pls.โ Resp. (docket no. 124 at 18โ22). \n8  The failure-to-enforce exception โrecognizes that some statutes impose on [the] \n9  government a duty owed to a particular class or category of individuals, such that the \n10  failure to enforce those statutes breaches a duty that can sustain an action in tort.โ  \n11  Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 402.  To prove that this narrow exception applies, see Atherton \n12  Condo. Apartment-Owners Assโn Bd. of Dirs., 115 Wn.2d 506, 531, 799 P.2d 250 (1990), \n13  a plaintiff must show that (i) โgovernmental agents responsible for enforcing statutory \n14  requirements possess actual knowledge of a statutory violation,โ (ii) โfail to take \n15  corrective action despite a statutory duty to do so,โ and (iii) โthe plaintiff is within the \n16  class the statute intended to protect,โ Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 402 (citing Bailey v. Town of \n17  Forks, 108 Wn.2d 262, 268, 737 P.2d 1257 (1987)).  In this case, Plaintiffsโ negligence \n18  claim is based solely on two ordinances that purportedly give rise to a duty under the \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 28 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 29 of 39\n \n \n \n1  failure-to-enforce exception:  (a) the Seattle Fire Code,15 and (b) Seattleโs Street Use \n2  Ordinance. \n3  a.  Seattle Fire Code \n4  Plaintiffs argue that three Seattle Fire Code16 provisions impose an affirmative \n5  duty on the City:  (i) ยง 503.1 (โFire apparatus access roads shall be provided and \n6  maintained in accordance with Sections 503.1.1 through 503.1.3.โ); (ii) ยง 503.4 (โFire \n7  apparatus access roads shall not be obstructed in any manner, including the parking of \n8  vehicles.โ); and (iii) ยง 104.11.2 (โNo person shall obstruct the operations of the fire \n9  department in connection with extinguishment, or control or investigation of any \n10  fire . . . .โ).17  These provisions, however, do not require the City to take any specific \n11  corrective action in the event of a known violation.  See Donohoe v. State, 135 Wn. App. \n12  824, 849, 142 P.3d 654 (2006) (explaining that the failure-to-enforce exception applies \n13 \n \n14 \n15 The Cityโs motion to strike Plaintiffsโ answer to the Cityโs Interrogatory No. 3 (requesting that \nPlaintiffs identify each statute or ordinance that the City โfailed to abideโ) is DENIED.  See Def.โs Mot. \n15 \n(docket no. 111 at 18 n.4).  On August 31, 2022, the final day of the discovery period in this action, \nPlaintiffs supplemented their answer to Interrogatory No. 3 to include the Seattle Fire Code, and eleven \n16  other statutory provisions that are not at issue.  See Ex. 47 to Cramer Decl. (docket no. 112-47).  The \nCourt concludes that the City was not harmed by this disclosure because the City questioned Chief \nScoggins about the Seattle Fire Code during his deposition on September 14, 2021.  See Scoggins Dep. at \n17 \n184:5โ185:20 (docket no. 125-8).  Moreover, as the City explains in its motion for summary judgment, \nInterrogatory No. 3 concerns the legislative intent exception to the public duty doctrine.  See Def.โs Mot. \n18  (docket no. 111 at 18).  Because the legislative intent exception is no longer at issue in this case, any \nresponse to the interrogatory is irrelevant. \n19 \n16 The Court relies on the version of the Seattle Fire Code in effect during CHOP, namely the 2015 \nInternational Fire Code, as amended by the City and adopted by Ordinance No. 125392 in August 2017.  \n20 \nSee Ex. 57 to Cramer Supplemental Decl. (docket no. 152-7). \n21  17 A fire apparatus access road is defined as a road โthat provides fire apparatus access from a fire station \nto a facility, building or portion thereof.โ  Seattle Fire Code ยง 202.  The term is โinclusive of all other \nterms such as fire lane, public street, private street, parking lot lane and access roadway.โ  Id. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 29 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 30 of 39\n \n \n \n1  only โwhere there is a mandatory duty to take a specific action to correct a known \n2  statutory violationโ).  Thus, Plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, meet the second element \n3  of the failure-to-enforce exception (failing to take corrective action despite a mandatory \n4  duty to do so).   \n5  Moreover, the failure-to-enforce exception does not apply because Plaintiffs are \n6  not within a class the Seattle Fire Code is intended to protect.18  See Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d \n7  at 402.  Rather than designating a protected class, the Seattle Fire Code provides that its \n8  express purpose โis to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, and \n9  not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular group of persons who will \n10  or should be especially protected or benefitedโ by its terms.  Seattle Fire Code ยง 101.3.  \n11  The code is also intended to โprovide a reasonable level of safety to fire fighters and \n12  emergency responders during emergency operationsโ and to provide โa reasonable level \n13  of life safety and property protection from the hazards of fire.โ  Id.  With respect to the \n14  Seattle Fire Code, Plaintiffs (property owners, businesses, and residents) are merely \n15  members of the general public, and the City cannot be held liable in tort for duties owed \n16  solely to the general public.  See Beltran-Serrano, 193 Wn.2d at 549.  Accordingly, \n17 \n18 \n \n19 \n18 Plaintiffs argue that they can satisfy the third element of the failure-to-enforce exception by showing \nthat they were โwithin the ambit of riskโ created by the Cityโs conduct.  Pls.โ Resp. (docket no. 124 at 19).  \n20 \nBut Plaintiffsโ reliance on the ambit of risk test is misplaced.  Courts utilize the ambit of risk test to \ndetermine the scope of a governmental entityโs duty of care.  โWhen a governmental agent knows of [a] \n21  violation, a duty of care runs to all persons within the protected class, not merely those who have had \ndirect contact with the governmental entity.โ  Bailey, 108 Wn.2d at 269โ70.  In this case, Plaintiffs have \nfailed to show that they are in the protected class. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 30 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 31 of 39\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs cannot, as a matter of law, meet the third element of the failure-to-enforce \n2  exception. \n3  b.  Seattle Municipal Code ยง 15.52 \n4  Plaintiffs also argue that the City owed them a duty under Seattleโs Street Use \n5  Ordinance, which governs permit requirements for certain โspecial events.โ  SMC \n6  ยง 15.52.005 defines a โspecial eventโ as โan event planned to be held in a park, other \n7  City-owned property, or public placeโ that is reasonably expected to (i) โcause or result \n8  in more than 50 people,โ (ii) โhave a substantial impactโ on the area, (iii) โrequire the \n9  provision of substantial public services,โ and (iv) โrequire the temporary closure or \n10  exclusive useโ of the area.  Pursuant to SMC ยง 15.52.040, โ[a] special event permit or \n11  authorization from the Special Events Committee is required for any special event.โ \n12  Like the Seattle Fire Code, Seattleโs Street Use Ordinance does not impose on the \n13  City a mandatory duty to take corrective action in the event of a known violation.  See \n14  Donohoe, 135 Wn. App. at 849 (explaining that โa mandatory duty to take a specific \n15  action to correct a known statutory violationโ does not exist โif the government agent has \n16  broad discretion about whether and how to actโ (citation omitted)).  The permitting \n17  provisions give the Cityโs Special Events Committee discretion to deny permit \n18  applications, SMC ยง 15.52.060(B), revoke permits, id. at ยง 15.52.060(C), and determine \n19  whether a special event permit is even required, id. at ยง 15.52.030(A).    Plaintiffs have \n20  not cited, however, any provision in Seattleโs Street Use Ordinance that requires the City \n21  to take specific action if an individual fails to obtain a permit or authorization.  SDOTโs \n22  Director is authorized to enforce Seattleโs Street Use Ordinance and โmay call upon the \n23 \n  ORDER - 31 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 32 of 39\n \n \n \n1  police, fire, health or other appropriate City departments to assist in enforcement,โ \n2  SMC ยง 15.90.004(A), but the provision is not โintended to impose any duty upon the \n3  City,โ id. at ยง 15.90.004(E).  Plaintiffs therefore cannot, as a matter of law, meet the \n4  second element of the failure-to-enforce exception. \n5  Plaintiffs also fail to meet the third element of the failure-to-enforce exception \n6  because they are not within a class the Street Use Ordinance is intended to protect.  SMC \n7  ยง 15.90.004(C) provides that โ[t]he Street and Sidewalk Use Code shall be enforced for \n8  the benefit of the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not for the benefit \n9  of any particular person or class of persons.โ  Plaintiffs have not shown that the duty \n10  purportedly breached by the City was a duty owed to them as individuals and not an \n11  obligation owed to the general public.  See Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 408.   \n12  Because Plaintiffs cannot meet the elements of the failure-to-enforce exception \n13  with respect to the Seattle Fire Code and Street Use Ordinance, they have not established \n14  that the City owed them a duty under traditional negligence principles, an essential \n15  element of their negligence claim.  See Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 396.  Accordingly, the \n16  Cityโs motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ negligence \n17  claim, and Plaintiffsโ fourth cause of action is DISMISSED with prejudice.19 \n18 \n \n19 \n19 The City also argues that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffsโ negligence claim on the basis of the \nCityโs discretionary immunity.  The Court questions whether the Cityโs actions at issue in this case are \n20 \nprotected under discretionary immunity.  Although the Washington State Legislature abolished the \ndoctrine of sovereign tort immunity โon a broad basis,โ Evangelical United Brethren Church of Adna v. \n21  State, 67 Wn.2d 246, 252, 407 P.2d 440 (1965), the Washington Supreme Court has โrecognized that, as a \nmatter of public policy, not every act, omission or decision of government should subject the \ngovernmental unit to potential liability,โ Stewart v. State, 92 Wn.2d 285, 293, 597 P.2d 101 (1979) (citing \n22 \nEvangelical, 67 Wn.2d at 255).  Discretionary immunity is โan extremely limited exception,โ id., and \n23 \n  ORDER - 32 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 33 of 39\n \n \n \n1  5.  Fifth Cause of Action:  Nuisance \n2  โA nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and \n3  enjoyment of another personโs property.โ  Kitsap County v. Kitsap Rifle & Revolver Club, \n4  184 Wn. App. 252, 276, 337 P.3d 328 (2014) (citing Grundy v. Thurston County, 155 \n5  Wn.2d 1, 6, 117 P.3d 1089 (2005)).  In Washington, an actionable nuisance is defined by \n6  statute as โwhatever is injurious to health or indecent or offensive to the senses, or an \n7  obstruction to the free use of property, so as to essentially interfere with the comfortable \n8  enjoyment of the life and property.โ  RCW 7.48.010.  A nuisance โwhich affects equally \n9  the rights of an entire community or neighborhoodโ is a public nuisance, RCW 7.48.130, \n10  whereas โ[a]ny nuisance that does not fit the statutory definition of a public nuisance is a \n11  private nuisance,โ Grundy, 155 Wn.2d at 7 (citing RCW 7.48.150).  Plaintiffs allege that \n12  the City โdirectly participatedโ in the creation of a nuisance by blocking access to streets \n13  and sidewalks in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and maintaining a series of unreasonable \n14  conditions such as โexcessive noise, public safety hazards, vandalism, and poor health \n15 \n \n16 \napplies only to โbasic policy decisions made by a high-level executive,โ and not to โministerialโ or \n17 \nโoperationalโ acts, see Taggart v. State, 118 Wn.2d 195, 214โ15, 822 P.2d 243 (1992).  For example, โthe \ndecision whether to dispatch a police officer to the scene of a crimeโ is not protected under discretionary \n18  immunity because it is โnot a basic policy decision by a high-level executiveโ and is operational in nature.  \nId. at 215 (citing ChambersโCastanes v. King County, 100 Wn.2d 275, 282, 669 P.2d 451 (1983)).  \nSimilarly, discretionary immunity does not shield parole officers from claims of negligent supervision \n19 \nbecause supervisory decisions, โhowever much discretion they may require,โ are ministerial in nature and \nnot basic policy decisions.  Id.  The City contends that it has discretionary immunity for its CHOP-related \n20 \npolicy decision to deescalate tensions in the area.  Plaintiffs, however, do not challenge that policy, but \nrather the manner in which it was implemented.  The Cityโs decision to provide portable toilets, \n21  handwashing stations, and dumpsters to protesters appears to be operational in nature, and the Court \ncannot โclearly and unequivocallyโ conclude that the Cityโs provision of these items was essential to the \nrealization of its stated objective.  See Evangelical, 67 Wn.2d at 255. \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 33 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 34 of 39\n \n \n \n1  and sanitation conditions.โ  TAC at ยถยถ 217โ20.  The City argues that Plaintiffsโ nuisance \n2  claim should be dismissed because (a) the claim is not actionable, and (b) it is dependent \n3  upon the Cityโs alleged negligence.   \n4  a.  Actionable Nuisance \n5  The City contends that Plaintiffsโ nuisance claim is not actionable because they \n6  have presented no evidence of City wrongdoing.  Pursuant to RCW 7.48.160, โ[n]othing \n7  which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute, can be deemed a \n8  nuisance.โ  But โa lawful action may still be a nuisance based on the unreasonableness of \n9  the locality, manner of use, and circumstances of the case.โ  Kitsap Rifle & Revolver \n10  Club, 184 Wn. App. at 281 (citing Grundy, 155 Wn.2d at 7 n.5).  The City asserts that, \n11  because it has statutory authority to regulate streets, sidewalks, and other public areas, it \n12  cannot be liable for a nuisance arising from its activities in and around Cal Anderson \n13  Park.  See RCW 35.22.280(7) (providing that any city with a population of 10,000 or \n14  more, see RCW 35.01.010, shall have the power . . . โto regulate and control the useโ of \n15  โstreets . . . sidewalks, . . . and other public grounds, . . . to vacate the same, . . . and to \n16  prescribe the terms and conditions upon which the same may be so used, and to regulate \n17  the use thereofโ).  Washington courts, however, โinterpret RCW 7.48.160 as requiring a \n18  direct authorization of action to escape the possibility of nuisance.โ  Kitsap Rifle & \n19  Revolver Club, 184 Wn. App. at 281 (citing Judd v. Bernard, 49 Wn.2d 619, 621, 304 \n20  P.2d 1046 (1956)).  In Judd, for example, the state game commissionโs decision to kill \n21  fish in a certain lake was not an actionable nuisance because the commission was \n22  authorized by statute to kill fish for game management purposes.  49 Wn.2d at 621.  In \n23 \n  ORDER - 34 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 35 of 39\n \n \n \n1  contrast, although RCW 35.22.280(7) provides the City with general power to regulate its \n2  streets and sidewalks, it does not directly authorize all of the Cityโs acts in response to \n3  CHOP. \n4  Further, Plaintiffsโ nuisance claim is not limited to allegations of blocked access.  \n5  Plaintiffs allege that the City maintained certain unreasonable conditions such as \n6  excessive noise, public safety hazards, and vandalism during the CHOP period.  The \n7  undisputed evidence shows that some City officials were concerned that providing \n8  portable toilets, handwashing stations, and dumpsters for protestersโ use would encourage \n9  those individuals to stay in the area.  See Sixkiller Dep. at 145:17โ147:2 (docket no. 125-\n10  4); Zimbabwe Dep. at 166:2โ8 (docket no. 125-5).  The record also demonstrates that the \n11  City was aware of property damage resulting from the large number of protesters \n12  congregating in and around Cal Anderson Park, such as increased graffiti.  For example, \n13  the City covered its ecology blocks not only to provide a canvas for protestersโ art, but to \n14  โattractโ some of the graffiti away from local buildings.  See Zimbabwe Dep. at 47:1โ\n15  48:20 (docket no. 125-5).  The City was also aware of excessive noise coming from Cal \n16  Anderson Park and the surrounding area.  See Zimbabwe Dep. at 74:2โ12 (docket \n17  no. 125-5) (describing CHOP as a โparty environmentโ in the evenings).  The Cityโs \n18  argument that Plaintiffs have presented no evidence to support an actionable nuisance is \n19  unpersuasive.  Whether Plaintiffsโ evidence is sufficient to support a jury verdict on their \n20  nuisance claim must await trial. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 35 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 36 of 39\n \n \n \n1  b.  Overlap Between Nuisance and Negligence Claims \n2  The City also argues that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffsโ nuisance claim \n3  because it is duplicative of their negligence claim.  โIn Washington, a โnegligence claim \n4  presented in the garb of nuisanceโ need not be consideredโ separately.  Atherton, 115 \n5  Wn.2d at 527 (quoting Hostetler v. Ward, 41 Wn. App. 343, 360, 704 P.2d 1193 (1985)).  \n6  In situations โwhere the alleged nuisance is the result of the defendantโs alleged negligent \n7  conduct,โ courts will apply the rules of negligence.  Id.  In Atherton, a condominium \n8  owners association alleged that a developerโs failure to comply with applicable building \n9  code fire resistance standards created a nuisance.  Id.  Because the condominium owners \n10  associationโs nuisance claim was premised on its argument that the developer was \n11  โnegligent in failing to construct [the condominium building] in compliance with the \n12  applicable building code,โ the Washington Supreme Court concluded that the trial court \n13  properly applied negligence principals.  Id. at 528 (โ[E]ven if [the condominium \n14  building] does constitute a nuisance, the nuisance would be solely the result of [the \n15  developerโs] alleged negligent construction.โ).  Likewise, in Hostetler, plaintiff alleged \n16  that โbecause of [a countyโs] negligence in permitting minors and others to consume \n17  liquor in [a public park], the park constituted a nuisance under RCW 7.48.โ  41 Wn. App. \n18  at 355.  The Washington Court of Appeals applied the rules of negligence to plaintiffโs \n19  claim because the nuisance at issue was the result of the countyโs alleged โnegligence in \n20  failing to enforce the laws and ordinances prohibiting such drinking.โ  Id. at 360. \n21  Unlike Atherton and Hostetler, the Court cannot conclude that the purported \n22  nuisance in this matter is premised solely on the Cityโs alleged negligence in failing to \n23 \n  ORDER - 36 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 37 of 39\n \n \n \n1  enforce Seattleโs Fire Code or Street Use Ordinance.  Plaintiffs have significantly \n2  narrowed their negligence claim, and, as discussed above, argue only that the City owed \n3  them a duty under those provisions.  In contrast, Plaintiffsโ nuisance claim is based on the \n4  Cityโs affirmative actions in support of CHOP, such as the provision of portable toilets, \n5  handwashing stations, and dumpsters which might have encouraged protesters to remain \n6  in the area for a three-week period.  Although some of this evidence appears contrary to \n7  Plaintiffsโ argument that the City encouraged โpoor health and sanitation conditionsโ in \n8  and around Cal Anderson Park, TAC at ยถ 220, it presents a factual issue that cannot be \n9  resolved at this stage of litigation, and the Cityโs motion for summary judgment is \n10  DENIED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ fifth cause of action. \n11  6.  Proximate Cause/Damages \n12  Finally, the City argues that certain causation deficiencies require dismissal of \n13  Plaintiffsโ claims.  โGenerally, the issue of proximate causation is a question for the \n14  jury.โ  Attwood v. Albertsonโs Food Ctrs., Inc., 92 Wn. App. 326, 330, 966 P.2d 351 \n15  (1998) (quoting Bernethy v. Walt Failorโs, Inc., 97 Wn.2d 929, 935, 653 P.2d 280 \n16  (1982)).  The City takes issue with Plaintiffsโ damages expert Arik Van Zandt for \n17  allegedly failing to account for the effects of the COVID pandemic when calculating \n18  Plaintiffsโ economic damages.  In response, Van Zandt has submitted a declaration \n19  explaining how he considered the effects of COVID in his damage calculations.  See Van \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 37 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 38 of 39\n \n \n \n1  Zandt Decl. at ยถยถ 3โ11 (docket no. 131).  The Cityโs arguments about damages present \n2  factual disputes that preclude summary judgment on the issue of proximate causation.20 \n3  Conclusion \n4  For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS: \n5  (1)  The Cityโs motion, docket no. 111, to strike Plaintiffsโ answer to the Cityโs \n6  Interrogatory No. 3 is DENIED. \n7  (2)  The Cityโs motion for summary judgment, docket no. 111, is GRANTED in \n8  part and DENIED in part as follows: \n9  a.  The motion is GRANTED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ first cause of \n10  action for violation of procedural due process, second cause of action for violation \n11  of substantive due process, and fourth cause of action for negligence, and these \n12  causes of action are DISMISSED with prejudice. \n13  b.  Without opposition, the motion is GRANTED as to Redside Partners \n14  LLCโs third cause of action for taking, and the cause of action is DISMISSED \n15  with prejudice. \n16  c.  The motion is GRANTED in part as it relates to the remaining \n17  plaintiffsโ third cause of action for taking under a per se theory of liability, and \n18 \n19 \n \n20 \n20 For example, the City challenges Car Tenderโs claim for lost profits because the business was planning \n21  to relocate from its Capitol Hill location prior to CHOP.  But, as Car Tenderโs owner explained during his \ndeposition, Car Tender experienced reduced business because of CHOP.  McDermott Dep. at 180:13โ\n181:2 (docket no. 125-26) (explaining that some customers canceled their appointments during CHOP). \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 38 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 165   Filed 01/13/23   Page 39 of 39\n \n \n \n1  DENIED in part as it relates to the remaining plaintiffsโ third cause of action for \n2  taking under a โright of accessโ theory of liability. \n3  d.  The motion is DENIED as it relates to Plaintiffsโ fifth cause of \n4  action for nuisance. \n5  (3)  The following causes of action remain for trial:  Plaintiffsโ (excluding \n6  Redside Partners LLCโs) third cause of action for taking under a โright of accessโ theory \n7  of liability and Plaintiffsโ fifth cause of action for nuisance.  The Court concludes that \n8  material issues of fact preclude summary judgment on these remaining causes of action.  \n9  Whether the Cityโs alleged support, encouragement, and endorsement of CHOP from \n10  June 8 to July 1, 2020, will support a finding of liability on Plaintiffsโ taking and \n11  nuisance claims, or whether the Cityโs actions caused Plaintiffsโ damages under all of the \n12  circumstances, must await trial.   \n13  (4)  The Clerk is directed to send a copy of this Order to all counsel of record. \n14  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n15  Dated this 13th day of January, 2023. \n16 \nA\n \n17 \nThomas S.

Having reviewed all papers filed in support of, and in \n3  opposition to, the motion, and having considered the oral arguments of counsel, the Court \n4  DENIES Plaintiffsโ motion for the reasons stated in this Order.   \n5  Background \n6  1.  The Protest \n7  Plaintiffs are property owners, businesses, and residents in Seattleโs Capitol Hill \n8  neighborhood who claim that they were harmed during the Capitol Hill Organized Protest \n9  or Capitol Hill Occupying Protest (collectively, โCHOPโ).  Third Amended Class Action \n10  Complaint (โTACโ) at ยถ 13 (docket no. 47).  Plaintiffs allege that the City of Seattle \n11  (โCityโ) โabruptly desertedโ the Capitol Hill neighborhood on June 8, 2020, and left it \n12  unattended until July 1, 2020.  TAC at ยถยถ 3 & 9.  On June 8, 2020, the City evacuated the \n13  East Precinct of the Seattle Police Department (โSPDโ) amid ongoing civil rights \n14  protests, leaving behind barriers that had been used to separate police from protesters.  \n15  See Sixkiller Dep. at 38:9โ40:9, Ex. 4 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1); Zimbabwe \n16  Dep. at 12:23โ13:20, Ex. 5 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1).  Almost immediately after \n17  SPD abandoned the East Precinct, protestors declared the area โFree Capitol Hill,โ and \n18  used the barriers to block off streets within one block of the precinct to create a โno-copโ \n19  zone.  TAC at ยถยถ 37โ39; see also Zimbabwe Dep. at 16:15โ17:22.  According to former \n20  SPD Chief Carmen Best, the City intended to reenter the East Precinct the following day, \n21  but protesters declared the area their โsovereign property,โ or an โautonomous zone,โ and \n22  denied the City access.  Best Dep. at 33:12โ35:1, Ex. 6 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-\n23 \nORDER - 2 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 3 of 37\n \n \n \n1  1).  CHOP participants claimed the area as their own, and secured it by physically \n2  barricading and patrolling the areaโs borders.  TAC at ยถยถ 41โ42.  As the zone expanded, it \n3  first became known as the โCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone,โ also known as โCHAZ,โ \n4  and finally became known as CHOP.  Id. at ยถยถ 1 & 39.  The area of protest around the \n5  East Precinct eventually expanded to a sixteen-block portion of the Capitol Hill \n6  neighborhood, bounded by East Denny Way (to the north), Thirteenth Avenue (to the \n7  east), East Pike Street (to the south), and Broadway (to the west).  See Exec. Ord. 2020-\n8  08, Ex. 7 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1).  This area was also referred to as the โCal \n9  Anderson Park Areaโ in former Mayor Jenny Durkanโs June 30, 2020, executive order.  \n10  See id. \n11  Plaintiffs allege that, instead of restoring order to the area, the City actively \n12  endorsed, enabled, and encouraged the occupation of CHOP.  TAC at ยถ 5.  In contrast, \n13  Mayor Durkanโs executive order explained that the City reasonably facilitated the \n14  exercise of First Amendment rights and demonstrations in the area by: \n15  โข  Providing  basic  hygiene,  water,  litter  and  garbage  removal,  and \nelectricity; \n16  โข  Temporarily  allowing  obstructions  of  public  parks,  streets,  and \nsidewalks; \n17  โข  Modifying  SPD  and  [Seattle  Fire  Department  (โSFDโ)]  response \nprotocols to meet public safety needs to the extent possible within this \n18  area; \nโข  Modifying streets and pedestrian access routes; \n19 \nโข  Providing social services outreach and engagement along with referrals \nfor shelter, behavioral health and other supports for individuals in need; \n20 \nand \nโข  Facilitating  modified  city  services  delivery  to  local  residents  and \n21 \nbusinesses impacted by the events in this area. \n \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 3 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 4 of 37\n \n \n \n1  Exec. Ord. 2020-08 (docket no. 66-1 at 63).  Despite these measures, conditions in the \n2  area deteriorated throughout June 2020, โto the point where public health, life, and safety \n3  [were] threatened by activities in and around [the] area.โ  Id.  SPD designated a large \n4  portion of the area as the โRed Zone,โ and prohibited officers from entering the zone \n5  except to respond to reports of mass casualty events, such as active shooters or other life-\n6  threatening emergencies.  See Ex. 15 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1); see also Ex. 18 \n7  to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1).  Violent crime increased in the area, including two \n8  fatal shootings, and the City received numerous reports of rape, robbery, assault, and \n9  increased gang activity.  See Exec. Ord. 2020-08, Ex. 7 to Weaver Decl.  Residents and \n10  businesses in the area also reported increased incidents of harassment, graffiti, excessive \n11  noise, and the obstruction of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  See id.  On June 30, 2020, \n12  the City announced that it would close the area and remove any remaining individuals \n13  occupying City property or obstructing public rights of way.  Id. \n14  Plaintiffs allege that they suffered numerous economic and non-economic injuries \n15  as a result of the Cityโs actions, including reduced property values, extensive property \n16  damage, reduced access to emergency services, public safety dangers, exposure to \n17  excessive noise, and an inability to use and access their properties.  TAC at ยถยถ 2 & 6.  \n18  The City responds that many of these harms were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or \n19  third parties, and not CHOP.  See generally Exs. 1โ6 to Farmer Decl. (docket nos. 75-1, \n20  75-2, 75-3, 75-4, 75-5 & 75-6).  Plaintiffs bring five causes of action against the City on \n21  behalf of themselves and the proposed class:  (i) violation of procedural due process; \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 4 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 5 of 37\n \n \n \n1  (ii) violation of substantive due process; (iii) unlawful taking of their property; \n2  (iv) negligence; and (v) nuisance.  TAC at ยถยถ 188โ222. \n3  2.  The Proposed Class \n4  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(4), Plaintiffs move for \n5  certification of an issues class solely for purposes of liability.  Rule 23(c)(4) provides that \n6  โ[w]hen appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with \n7  respect to particular issues.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (emphasis added).  Issue \n8  certification is appropriate when โadjudication of the certified issues would significantly \n9  advance the resolution of the underlying case, thereby achieving judicial economy and \n10  efficiency.โ  Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir. 1996).  \n11  Rule 23(b)(3), however, still requires that common issues predominate over individual \n12  issues and that class certification be superior to other litigation alternatives.  Id.   \n13  In this case, Plaintiffs propose an issues class comprised of one class, three \n14  subclasses, and twenty-eight โparticular issuesโ bearing on the Cityโs liability, as well as \n15  the issue of nominal damages with respect to Plaintiffsโ federal claims.1  See Ex. 1 to \n16  Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1).  Plaintiffs also request that the Court certify two issues \n17  related to a discovery dispute regarding certain City officialsโ missing text messages.  See \n18  id.  The Court has previously provided Plaintiffs with an opportunity to conduct class \n19  discovery.  See Order (docket no. 23).   \n20 \n \n21 \n1 Plaintiffsโ proposed issues address only the Cityโs liability and class membersโ entitlement to nominal \ndamages.  Thus, even if a class were certified, class members would be required to pursue their claims for \n22  individual damages, if any, in subsequent proceedings.  See Ex. 2. to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1). \n23 \nORDER - 5 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 6 of 37\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify a class defined as:  \n2  All persons or entities who on June 9, 2020 (the โClass Dateโ),2 owned or \nmanaged real property in, had a licensed business in, or had an indoor \n3  residence in a building, in the area in the City of Seattle bounded by the \nfollowing streets:  Denny Way, East Pike Street, Thirteenth Avenue, and East \n4  Broadway (the โClass Areaโ).  This definition excludes the City of Seattle \nand any departments or agencies of the City of Seattle. \n5   \nMot. (docket no. 65 at 20).  At oral argument, Plaintiffs explained that they selected this \n6 \nโClass Areaโ because it is the sixteen-block area referenced in Mayor Durkanโs June 30, \n7 \n2020, executive order.  See Exec. Ord. 2020-08, Ex. 7 to Weaver Decl.  Plaintiffs also \n8 \nseek certification of three subclasses under Rule 23(c)(5), the:  (i) Property Owners \n9 \nSubclass, (ii) Business Owners Subclass, and (iii) Residents Subclass.3   \n10 \nThe following map shows where Plaintiffs4 are located in relation to the proposed \n11 \nClass Area and the SPD Red Zone, discussed above: \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n \n17 \n2 Plaintiffsโ Class Date is used to identify members of the putative class.  An individual, for example, who \nrented an apartment in the Class Area on June 10, 2020, would not be in the class.  Although the Class \n18 \nDate is a single day, Plaintiffs allege that the class suffered harm for the duration of CHOP, June 8, 2020, \nthrough July 1, 2020, and thereafter.  TAC at ยถยถ 3 & 9. \n19 \n3 Plaintiffs have not sufficiently explained why subclasses would be โappropriate,โ see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n20  23(c)(5), in this case.  The Court finds that subclasses would serve no purpose in this action.  At oral \nargument, Plaintiffsโ counsel was unable to articulate any meaningful rationale for the three subclasses. \n21 \n4 For ease of reference, the Court has included numbers throughout this Order immediately following \nplaintiffsโ names.  These numbers correspond to the numbers in the map showing plaintiffsโ locations in \n22  relation to the proposed Class Area. \n23 \nORDER - 6 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 7 of 37\n \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n \n10 \nApp. A to Def.โs Resp. (docket no. 74 at 44).5   \n11 \nHunters Property Holdings, LLC (14), The Richmark Company d/b/a Richmark \n12 \nLabel (10), Wade Biller (12), 12th and Pike Associates LLC (4), and Olive Street \n13 \nApartments LLC (6) seek to represent the Property Owners Subclass.  Mot. (docket \n14 \n15   \n16  5 As of the date of this Order, plaintiffs Argento LLC (1), see docket no. 59, and Northwest Liquor and \nWine LLC (5), see docket no. 71, have voluntarily dismissed their claims against the City.  Although \n17  Madrona Real Estate Services LLC (24) is physically located outside of the proposed Class Area, it is a \nmember of the putative class because it manages a building within the area.  See Ex. 3 to Weaver Decl. \n(docket no. 66-1) (explaining that Madrona Real Estate Services LLC manages a building at 12th Avenue \n18 \nand East Pike Street).  At oral argument, Plaintiffs conceded that Greenus Building, Inc. (20), Madrona \nReal Estate Investors IV LLC (23), and Madrona Real Estate Investors VI LLC (22) are not members of \n19  the putative class because these entities are located outside of the proposed Class Area.  See also Pls.โ \nResp. to Def.โs 2d Interrogs. No. 9, Ex. 82 to Farmer Decl. (docket no. 75-82).  Hunters Capital, LLC (2, \n20  3, 14, 15, 19, 20 & 21) and Redside Partners LLC (9, 16 & 25) are members of the putative class because \nthey own and/or manage properties within the Class Area.  See Ex. 3 to Weaver Decl.  Nevertheless, they \nalso seek damages for three properties located outside of the area, specifically, the Dunn Motors Building \n21 \n(19), the Colman Building (21), and a building at 1323 East Pine Street (25).  See Pls.โ Resp. to Def.โs 2d \nInterrogs. No. 9.  Plaintiffs have requested that the claims associated with these properties proceed \n22  alongside the claims of the putative class, if certified. \n23 \nORDER - 7 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 8 of 37\n \n \n \n1  no. 65 at 21).  SRJ Enterprises d/b/a Car Tender (18), Bergmanโs Lock and Key Services \n2  LLC (13), Shuffle LLC d/b/a Cure Cocktail (17), and Sway and Cake LLC (11) seek to \n3  represent the Business Owners Subclass.  Id.  Finally, Matthew Ploszaj (8) seeks to \n4  represent the Residents Subclass.6  Id.  \n5  Discussion \n6  1.  Standard for Class Certification \n7  Rule 23 operates as โan exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by \n8  and on behalf of the individual named parties only.โ  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 \n9  U.S. 27, 33 (2013) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700โ01 (1979)).  To \n10  maintain a class action, a plaintiff must โaffirmatively demonstrateโ compliance with \n11  Rule 23.  Id. (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)).  The \n12  prerequisites of Rule 23 are not mere pleading standards, but rather are evidentiary \n13  thresholds.  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350.  โEven if the common questions do not \n14  predominate over the individual questions so that class certification of the entire action is \n15  warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to isolate the \n16  common issues under [Rule 23(c)(4)] and proceed with class treatment of these particular \n17  issues.โ  Valentino, 97 F.3d at 1234.  The Ninth Circuitโs approval of issues classes under \n18  Rule 23(c)(4) does not obviate the need to meet the requirements of Rules 23(a) and (b).  \n19 \n \n20 \n6 Hunters Capital, LLC (2, 3, 14, 15, 19, 20 & 21), Onyx Homeowners Association (7), Madrona Real \n21 \nEstate Services LLC (24), and Redside Partners LLC (9, 16 & 25) request appointment only as \nrepresentatives of the main class.  Mot. (docket no. 65 at 20).  These plaintiffs do not seek to represent \n22  any of the three proposed subclasses.  See Ex. 3 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1). \n23 \nORDER - 8 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 9 of 37\n \n \n \n1  See Amador v. Baca, No. 10-cv-01649, 2016 WL 6804910, at *3 (C.D. Cal. July 27, \n2  2016).  Plaintiffs bear the burden, by a preponderance of the evidence, see Olean \n3  Wholesale Grocery Coop., Inc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC, No. 19-56514, 2022 WL \n4  1053459, at *5 (9th Cir. Apr. 8, 2022), to prove that there are questions of law or fact \n5  common to class members that โwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each \n6  one of the claims in one stroke,โ see Walmart, 564 U.S. at 350. \n7  Here, Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that all four criteria of Rule 23(a) are \n8  satisfied, namely that:  (i) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \n9  impracticable; (ii) questions of law or fact common to the class exist; (iii) Plaintiffsโ \n10  claims are typical of the claims of the class; and (iv) Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \n11  protect the interests of the class, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  If all Rule 23(a) criteria are \n12  met, Plaintiffs must also establish that the proposed class qualifies under at least one of \n13  the three provisions of Rule 23(b).  See Comcast, 569 U.S. at 33.  With these standards in \n14  mind, the Court turns to the requirements of Rule 23(a). \n15  2.  Rule 23(a) Requirements \n16  a.  Numerosity \n17  Plaintiffs estimate that the Class Area contains at least 4,500 to 5,000 putative \n18  class members, comprised of approximately 4,000 residents, 300 businesses, and 600 \n19  property owners.  Weaver Decl. at ยถ 2 (docket no. 66); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n20  (requiring that a proposed class be โso numerous that joinder of all members is \n21  impracticableโ).  The City appears to concede that Rule 23(a)(1)โs numerosity \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 9 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 10 of 37\n \n \n \n1  requirement is satisfied in this case.7  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the proposed \n2  class is sufficiently numerous.   \n3  b.  Commonality \n4  To satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)โs commonality requirement, Plaintiffs must demonstrate \n5  that the claims of all potential class members depend on a common question of such \n6  nature as โis capable of classwide resolution.โ  Olean, 2022 WL 1053459, at *4 (quoting \n7  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350).  The test is whether the determination of the truth or falsity \n8  of the common question โwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of \n9  the claims in one stroke.โ  Id. at *4 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350).  As the \n10  Supreme Court has explained: \n11  What  matters . . . is  not  the  raising  of  common  โquestionsโโeven  in \ndrovesโbut, rather the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate \n12  common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.  Dissimilarities \nwithin  the  proposed  class  are  what  have  the  potential  to  impede  the \n13  generation of common answers. \n \n14  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (emphasis in original, quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class \n15  Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. REV. 97, 132 (2009)).  In \n16  contrast, an individual question is one where putative class members must present \n17  evidence that varies from member to member.  Olean, 2022 WL 1053459, at *4 (citing \n18  Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577 U.S. 442, 453 (2016)).   \n19  The City argues that dissimilarities within the proposed class frustrate common \n20  answers to the particular issues Plaintiffs seek to certify under Rule 23(c)(4).  To prove \n21 \n \n22  7 The City does not address numerosity in its response to Plaintiffsโ motion. \n23 \nORDER - 10 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 11 of 37\n \n \n \n1  the issues are common questions of law or fact central to the validity of their claims, \n2  Plaintiffs must establish that the proposed issues โare capable of being established \n3  through a common body of evidence, applicable to the whole class.โ  See id. at *6.  The \n4  Court must engage in a โrigorous assessmentโ of the available evidence and the method \n5  by which Plaintiffs intend to prove the common questions in one stroke.  See id. at *7 \n6  (citation omitted).  The Courtโs inquiry will necessarily โentail some overlap with the \n7  meritsโ of the underlying claims because class certification considerations are generally \n8  โenmeshedโ in the factual and legal issues associated with the causes of action being \n9  pursued.  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351; see also Comcast, 569 U.S. at 33โ34.  The \n10  Court must, therefore, examine the elements of Plaintiffsโ claims and the particular issues \n11  for which class certification is sought.  \n12  i.  Procedural Due Process \n \n13  Plaintiffsโ first cause of action alleges a violation of procedural due process.  \n14  TAC at ยถยถ 188โ96.  Under Rule 23(c)(4), Plaintiffs desire to certify the following \n15  particular issues as to their procedural due process claim: \n16  โข  Did the three Subclasses have a constitutionally protected interest in \nunfettered access to their property via public rights-of-way? \n17  โข  Did the Property Owners Subclass and Business Owners Subclass have \na constitutionally protected interest in economic use of their properties? \n18  โข  Did the City act to deprive Class members of those constitutionally \nprotected interests?  \n19  โข  Did the deprivation occur without due process?  \nโข  Is  the  deprivation  without  due  process  justified  by  a  sufficient \n20  countervailing justification?  \nโข  Was the deprivation pursuant to City policy under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983? \n21  โข  Are  members  of  each  of  the  three  Subclasses  entitled  to  nominal \ndamages? \n22   \n23 \nORDER - 11 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 12 of 37\n \n \n \n1  Ex. 1 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1). \n2  The Fourteenth Amendment provides:  โ[N]or shall any State deprive any person \n3  of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.โ  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, ยง 1.  \n4  To prevail on a Section 1983 claim based upon procedural due process, Plaintiffs must \n5  prove three elements:  (i) a liberty or property interest protected by the Constitution; \n6  (ii) governmental deprivation of that interest; and (iii) lack of process.  Portman v. \n7  County of Santa Clara, 995 F.2d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 1993).  โProperty interests, of course, \n8  are not created by the Constitution.โ  Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, \n9  577 (1972).  โRather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules \n10  or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law . . . .โ  Id.   \n11  The proposed issues Plaintiffs have identified for certification under Rule 23(c)(4) \n12  cannot be answered with generalized proof on a class-wide basis.8  Rather, these \n13  questions require the class to present evidence that varies from member to member.  See \n14  Olean, 2022 WL 1053459, at *4.  For example, whether the City acted to deprive the \n15  class of a purported โinterest in unfettered access to their property via public rights-of-\n16 \n \n17 \n8 The Court notes that the first two questions are questions of law regarding constitutionally protected \ninterests in property.  Plaintiffs ask whether: (i) the members of the three Subclasses have a \n18 \nconstitutionally protected interest in unfettered access to their property via public rights-of-way, and \n(ii) the members of the Property Owners Subclass and the Business Owners Subclass have a \n19  constitutionally protected interest in the economic use of their properties.  Ex. 1 to Weaver Decl.  The \nCourt recognizes that these questions might generate common answers concerning one or more of the \n20  property interests of individuals and entities in the Class Area.  Certification of these issues under Rule \n23(c)(4), however, is not appropriate.  As discussed above, issue certification is appropriate only when the \ncertified issues would โsignificantly advance the resolution of the underlying case.โ  Valentino, 97 F.3d at \n21 \n1229.  Certification of these two questions alone will not advance the resolution of Plaintiffsโ procedural \ndue process claim because the questions do not reach the core issues of the claim, that is, whether and to \n22  what extent the City deprived the putative class members of a property interest without due process. \n23 \nORDER - 12 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 13 of 37\n \n \n \n1  wayโ requires individualized proof of an actual deprivation.  The owner of Car Tender \n2  (18) testified that protesters blocked the sidewalks around its business but never blocked \n3  access to its parking lot.  See McDermott Dep. at 164:3โ6, Ex. 47 to Farmer Decl. \n4  (docket no. 75-47).  Similarly, Richmark Label (10) was always able to access its \n5  business, though โ[s]ometimes not exactly when [it] needed to.โ  See Donner Dep. at \n6  49:17โ50:14, Ex. 19 to Farmer Decl. (docket no. 75-19).  But commonality requires proof \n7  that all class members have suffered the same injury.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349โ50 \n8  (โThis does not mean merely that [class members] have all suffered a violation of the \n9  same provision of law.โ).  12th and Pike Associates LLC (4), a plaintiff in this case, seeks \n10  damages for lost rent from one of its tenants, Unicorn Bar, a putative class member \n11  located within the proposed Class Area at 1118 East Pike Street.  See Ex. 12 to Farmer \n12  Decl. (docket no. 75-12).  Unicorn Bar remained closed throughout the protest due to \n13  COVID-19 restrictions.  See Ex. 10 to Farmer Decl. (docket no. 75-10).  To establish that \n14  the City caused an alleged deprivation, Car Tender (18) and Richmark Label (10) must \n15  rely on different evidence than Unicorn Bar, which remained closed for reasons unrelated \n16  to the protest.  The question whether the City acted to deprive the class of purported \n17  property interests requires every class member to produce evidence of their individual \n18  rights and how the City caused an alleged deprivation.   \n19  Whether the deprivation was pursuant to City policy under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \n20  occurred without due process, or was justified, see Ex. 1 to Weaver Decl., are also \n21  incapable of classwide resolution because the answers to these questions requires \n22  individualized proof that the City caused a deprivation of the class membersโ rights.  The \n23 \nORDER - 13 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 14 of 37\n \n \n \n1  questions are whether the deprivation occurred without process, was pursuant to City \n2  policy under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and justified under the circumstances of the ongoing civil \n3  rights protest during the class period.  The existence of a City policy or a lack of process, \n4  standing alone, does not advance Plaintiffsโ procedural due process claim if the class \n5  members were not deprived of any constitutionally protected right.9  Thus, the Court \n6  concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated commonality as to the particular issues \n7  for their procedural due process claim. \n8  ii.  Substantive Due Process \n \n9  Plaintiffsโ second cause of action alleges a violation of substantive due process.  \n10  TAC at ยถยถ 197โ202.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify the following particular issues for \n11  their substantive due process claim: \n12  โข  Did the Cityโs affirmative actions or statements create or expose the Class \nto an actual, particularized danger the Class would not have otherwise \n13  faced? \nโข  Was the City deliberately indifferent to the known dangers? \n14  โข  Was it foreseeable that the types of injuries suffered by the Class would \nbe suffered? \n15 \nโข  Were the Cityโs actions and statements pursuant to City policy under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983? \n16 \nโข  Are Class members entitled to nominal damages? \n17 \nEx. 1 to Weaver Decl.   \n18 \n \n19 \n9 The question of nominal damages is not appropriate for certification under Rule 23(c)(4) because it does \n20  not โsignificantly advance the resolutionโ of this action.  Valentino, 97 F.3d at 1229.  When a plaintiff \nproves a violation of his or her constitutional rights, nominal damages are โawarded by default until the \nplaintiff establishes entitlement to some other form of damages, such as compensatory or statutory \n21 \ndamages.โ  Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 141 S. Ct. 792, 800 (2021).  The parties do not dispute that a \nplaintiff who prevails on his or her constitutional claims is entitled to nominal damages in the absence of \n22  actual damages. \n23 \nORDER - 14 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 15 of 37\n \n \n \n1  To establish a substantive due process claim a plaintiff must show:  \n2  (i) governmental deprivation of life, liberty, or property; and (ii) โconscience shocking \n3  behavior by the government.โ  Brittain v. Hansen, 451 F.3d 982, 991 (9th Cir. 2006).  \n4  โThe Due Process Clause is a limitation on state action and is not a โguarantee of certain \n5  minimal levels of safety and security.โโ  Martinez v. City of Clovis, 943 F.3d 1260, 1271 \n6  (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. \n7  189, 195 (1989)).  Because โthe Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause generally \n8  does not confer any affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be \n9  necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests,โ government actors are usually not \n10  required to protect individuals from third parties.  Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, \n11  968 (9th Cir. 2011).  The Ninth Circuit has recognized two exceptions to this general \n12  rule:  (i) โa special relationship between the plaintiff and the state may give rise to a \n13  constitutional duty to protect,โ and (ii) a duty to protect may arise from a state-created \n14  danger.  Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1271โ72.  Only the state-created danger exception is at \n15  issue in this case.10 \n16  Under the state-created danger exception, a state may violate substantive due \n17  process if it โโaffirmatively places [a plaintiff] . . . in danger by acting with โdeliberate \n18  indifferenceโ to a โknown or obvious danger.โโ  Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1271 (quoting \n19  Patel, 648 F.3d at 971โ72).  This exception requires proof that:  (i) an officerโs \n20 \n \n21 \n10 The special-relationship exception is not at issue in this case, and Plaintiffs have not addressed it in \ntheir motion or reply.  Moreover, plaintiffsโ proposed issues do not ask whether the City and the putative \n22  class had a special relationship sufficient to establish a constitutional duty to protect. \n23 \nORDER - 15 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 16 of 37\n \n \n \n1  affirmative actions created or exposed the plaintiff to an actual, particularized danger that \n2  he or she would not otherwise have faced, (ii) the plaintiff suffered a foreseeable injury, \n3  and (iii) the officer was deliberately indifferent to the known danger.  Id.  A plaintiffโs \n4  burden is high because proof of deliberate indifference requires a culpable mental state.  \n5  Id. at 1274.  Thus, a plaintiff must show that a state actor recognized โan unreasonable \n6  risk and actually intend to expose the plaintiff to such risks without regard to the \n7  consequences to the plaintiff.โ  Id. (citation omitted).  โIn other words, the defendant \n8  โknows that something is going to happen but ignores the risk and exposes [the plaintiff] \n9  to it.โโ  Patel, 648 F.3d at 974 (alteration and emphasis in original, quoting L.W. v. \n10  Grubbs, 92 F.3d 894, 900 (9th Cir. 1996)). \n11  In this case, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate commonality as to the proposed \n12  particular issues because the issues cannot be answered through generalized proof.  \n13  Whether the City exposed class members to an actual, particularized danger will require \n14  evidence that varies from member to member.  Plaintiffs allege the Cityโs actions greatly \n15  increased the likelihood that members of the putative class would experience many \n16  diverse harms, including property damage, loss of business revenue, personal injury, and \n17  the loss of use of property, among other harms.  TAC at ยถ 199.  But Plaintiffs have not \n18  presented evidence to support that the putative class members were exposed to or \n19  experienced the same dangers. \n20  In Wal-Mart, a leading case on class certification, the plaintiffs alleged \n21  discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  564 U.S. at 343.  \n22  The plaintiffs desired to litigate the Title VII claims of all female employees at Walโ\n23 \nORDER - 16 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 17 of 37\n \n \n \n1  Martโs stores in a nationwide class action; however, class certification was not consistent \n2  with Rule 23(a)(2)โs commonality requirement.  As the Court explained:  \n3  [P]roof  of  commonality  necessarily  overlaps  with  [plaintiffsโ]  merits \ncontention that WalโMart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimination. \n4  That is so because, in resolving an individualโs Title VII claim, the crux of \nthe inquiry is โthe reason for a particular employment decision,โ Cooper v. \n5  Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867, 876 (1984).  Here [plaintiffs] \nwish  to  sue  about  literally  millions  of  employment  decisions  at  once.  \n6  Without  some  glue  holding  the  alleged  reasons  for  all  those  decisions \ntogether,  it  will  be  impossible  to  say  that  examination  of  all  the  class \n7  membersโ claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial \nquestion why was I disfavored. \n8   \nId. at 352 (emphasis in original).  Similarly, Plaintiffs in this case have not demonstrated \n9 \nhow examination of their individual experiences during CHOP are sufficient to establish \n10 \nthe Cityโs liability as to the entire putative class.  Plaintiff Matthew Ploszaj (8) alleges \n11 \nthat protestors broke into his apartment during CHOP.11  Ploszaj Dep. at 84:17โ18, \n12 \nEx. 16 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1).  Although Ploszaj will likely contend that the \n13 \nCityโs actions in creating or encouraging CHOP exposed him to that danger, his \n14 \nexperience cannot be used to establish that the City violated the substantive due process \n15 \nrights of putative class members who remained secure in their homes or businesses \n16 \nthroughout the protest.  Other class members might argue, for example, that the City \n17 \nviolated their substantive due process rights in some other way, such as increasing the \n18 \nrisk of graffiti on their properties.  These distinct injuries demonstrate that Plaintiffsโ \n19 \nissues are not susceptible to generalized proof and will not generate common answers \n20 \n \n21 \n11 The Court questions whether the City is liable under these circumstances for the conduct of the third \n22  party. \n23 \nORDER - 17 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 18 of 37\n \n \n \n1  necessary to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2).  See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 349โ50.  Many persons \n2  who resided in the Class Area presumably suffered no loss of their rights during this \n3  period.  For example, as the City referenced during oral argument, the one-block portion \n4  of the Class Area bounded by East Denny Way (to the north), Thirteenth Avenue (to the \n5  east), East Howell Street (to the south), and Twelfth Avenue (to the west) was not near \n6  the barriers or within the SPD Red Zone.  Plaintiffs have not presented evidence \n7  sufficient to show that persons in this area were exposed to the same dangers as Plaintiffs \n8  or other members of the putative class. \n9  iii.  Takings \n \n10  Plaintiffsโ third cause of action alleges a violation of the Fifth Amendmentโs \n11  Takings Clause, TAC at ยถยถ 203โ08, which applies to local governments through the \n12  Fourteenth Amendment.  Webbโs Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, \n13  160 (1980).  The Fifth Amendment provides:  โnor shall private property be taken for \n14  public use, without just compensation.โ  U.S. Const. amend. V.  When the government \n15  physically acquires private property for public use, a โphysical takingโ has occurred.  \n16  Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, 141 S. Ct. 2063, 2071 (2021).  If the government imposes \n17  regulations that restrict a landownerโs use of his or her own property, it might commit a \n18  โregulatory taking.โ  Id. at 2072.  A temporary interference with the use of property can \n19  be considered a regulatory taking.  Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. \n20  104, 124 (1978); see also Bridge Aina Leโa, LLC v. Land Use Commโn, 950 F.3d 610, \n21  626 (9th Cir. 2020).  Whether a regulation amounts to a regulatory taking requires a court \n22  to engage in โad hoc, factual inquiries.โ  See Penn Cent., 438 U.S. at 124 (explaining that \n23 \nORDER - 18 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 19 of 37\n \n \n \n1  a court considers multiple factors such as the economic impact of the regulation and the \n2  extent to which the regulation has interfered with a plaintiffโs investment-backed \n3  expectations).   \n4  Washington and federal courts โare reluctant to find that a compensable taking \n5  occurred where the government temporarily used or destroyed property in times of \n6  emergency.โ  Citoli v. City of Seattle, 115 Wn. App. 459, 489, 61 P.3d 1165 (2002) \n7  (citing Natโl Bd. of Young Menโs Christian Assโns (YMCA) v. United States, 395 U.S. 85, \n8  92โ93 (1969)).  Where the โnecessitiesโ of civil disturbance require injury to private \n9  property, โthe resulting losses must be borne by the owners of the property.โ  Id.  Action \n10  taken for the purpose of, and reasonably necessary to, public safety does not generally \n11  give rise to a compensable taking.  Id. at 491 (โCitoli effectively asks us to substitute \n12  either his judgment or our judgment for that of trained police officers on the best way to \n13  handle a building takeover situation.  This we decline to do.โ). \n14  Under their takings claim, Plaintiffs allege the following: \n15  The City deprived Plaintiffs of [the rights to use and enjoy their properties, \nto exclude others from their properties, and to access their properties via \n16  public rights-of-way] by affirmatively creating, assisting, endorsing, and \nencouraging an indefinite, unpermitted invasion, occupation, and blockade \n17  of  the  public  rights-of-way  that  provide  access  to  Plaintiffsโ  private \nproperties, as well as by affirmatively creating, assisting, endorsing, and \n18  encouraging the physical invasion of Plaintiffsโ private properties by CHOP \nparticipants. \n19   \nTAC at ยถ 205.  Plaintiffs allege that the Cityโs actions caused them โeconomic harm, \n20 \nincluding through a loss of property value, loss of business revenue, and a loss of \n21 \ninvestment-backed expectations.โ  Id. at ยถ 208.  These allegations are broad in nature and \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 19 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 20 of 37\n \n \n \n1  will necessitate an individual inquiry into whether and to what extent a taking occurred, \n2  and whether the police action was justified under all the circumstances.  Plaintiffs appear \n3  to recognize the broad nature of their allegations and have attempted to narrow the issues \n4  for certification by relying solely on the theory of a per se physical taking.  Although a \n5  regulation that goes too far might be categorized as a regulatory taking, โ[g]overnment \n6  action that physically appropriates property is no less a physical taking because it arises \n7  from a regulation.โ  Cedar Point, 141 S. Ct. at 2072.  A per se taking occurs whenever a \n8  regulation results in the physical appropriation of property.  Id.  Under this theory, \n9  Plaintiffs have identified the following particular issues for certification: \n10  โข  Did the Cityโs actions constitute a per se taking of the rights of the \nmembers of the Subclasses? \n11  o  Did  the  Cityโs  actions  interfere  with  the  ability  to  access \nproperties? \n12  o  Did the Cityโs actions interfere with the ability to exclude others \nfrom properties? \n13  โข  Was this taking justified by an โemergencyโ? \nโข  Were the Cityโs actions and statements pursuant to City policy under \n14  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983? \nโข  Are members of the Subclasses entitled to nominal damages? \n15 \nEx. 1 to Weaver Decl. \n16 \nAt oral argument, Plaintiffs claimed that this action is similar to Cedar Point, \n17 \nwhere the Supreme Court held that a California regulation granting union organizers a \n18 \nright to temporarily access agricultural employersโ properties constituted a per se \n19 \nphysical taking.  141 S. Ct. at 2080.  The California regulation did not restrict an ownerโs \n20 \nuse of its own property, rather, the regulation appropriated the ownerโs right to exclude \n21 \nthird-party union organizers from its land.  Id. at 2072โ74.  In Cedar Point, there was no \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 20 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 21 of 37\n \n \n \n1  question that the California regulation permitted union organizers to access private land \n2  for a specified period of time, or that the union organizers actually entered an ownerโs \n3  property.  Id. at 2069โ70.   \n4  In this case, Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to prove that all class \n5  members were unable to access their properties or were deprived of the ability to exclude \n6  others from their land.12  The evidence establishes that protesters regularly moved \n7  barriers to obstruct vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area.  See, e.g., Zimbabwe Dep. \n8  at 16:15โ25, Ex. 5 to Weaver Decl.; Scoggins Dep. at 190:23โ191:19, Ex. 8 to Weaver \n9  Decl. (docket no. 66-1); Hara Dep. at 109:11โ21, Ex. 9 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-\n10  1).  No evidence, however, shows that every class member found themselves inside the \n11  area obstructed by the barriers, or that class members outside the barriers were unable to \n12  access their properties.  Ploszaj (8) claims that protestors broke into his apartment, see \n13  Ploszaj Dep. at 84:17โ18, Ex. 16 to Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1), but Plaintiffs have \n14  not presented evidence that the entire class experienced a similar invasion.  Further, \n15  Plaintiffs have not presented sufficient evidence to suggest that Plaintiffs or the putative \n16  class were unable to exclude others from their properties.  The majority of Plaintiffsโ \n17  allegations focus on protestorsโ occupation of public spaces.  See TAC at ยถ 5 (โCHOP \n18  participants occupied the public streets, sidewalks, and parks in the area at all hours of \n19   \n20  12 Under Plaintiffsโ theory of a per se taking, the class must also prove that the City appropriated their \nprivate property, either for itself or a third party.

For example, \nthe California regulation at issue in Cedar Point was a physical taking because the regulation granted \n22  labor organizations a โright to take accessโ to an agricultural employerโs property.  141 S.

Despite Plaintiffsโ contention, individual issues remain, and the \n2  putative class members must rely on individualized evidence to prove that they were \n3  deprived of access to their properties or of the ability to exclude others from their \n4  properties.  Therefore, the Court finds that the proposed issues cannot be answered in one \n5  stroke, as Rule 23(a)(2) requires. \n6  iv.  Negligence \n \n7  Plaintiffsโ fourth cause of action alleges that the City was negligent in its handling \n8  of CHOP.  TAC at ยถยถ 209โ15.  Plaintiffs ask to the Court to certify the following issues \n9  under Rule 23(c)(4): \n10  โข  Did the City owe a duty to the Class? \no  Does the failure-to-enforce exception to the public-duty doctrine \n11  apply? \no  Does the legislative-intent exception to the public-duty doctrine \n12  apply? \nโข  Did the City breach its duty? \n13  โข  Were the acts of third parties so highly extraordinary or improbable as to \nbe wholly beyond the range of expectability? \n14   \nEx. 1 to Weaver Decl. \n15 \n To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must show:  (i) the existence of a \n16 \nduty to the plaintiff; (ii) a breach of that duty; (iii) a resulting injury; and (iv) the breach \n17 \nas the proximate cause of the injury.  Ehrhart v. King County, 195 Wn.2d 388, 396, 460 \n18 \nP.3d 612 (2020).  โWhether the defendant is a governmental entity or a private person, to \n19 \nbe actionable, the duty must be one owed to the injured plaintiff, and not one owed to the \n20 \npublic in general.โ  Id. at 396โ97 (quoting Taylor v. Stevens County, 111 Wn.2d 159, \n21 \n163, 759 P.2d 447 (1988)).  This principle is known as the public duty doctrine.

App. 245, 251, 823 P.2d \n3  1152 (1992) (โ[U]nder the public duty doctrine, a plaintiff cannot recover from a \n4  municipal corporation unless he or she can show that the city owed a duty to the plaintiff \n5  as an individual and not merely to the public in general.โ).  Washington courts recognize \n6  four exceptions to the doctrine:  (i) legislative intent, (ii) failure to enforce, (iii) special \n7  relationship, and (iv) the rescue doctrine.  Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 400.  In this case, \n8  Plaintiffsโ proposed issues address only two of the four exceptions, the failure-to-enforce \n9  and legislative-intent exceptions.13 \n10  The failure-to-enforce exception โrecognizes that some statutes impose on [the] \n11  government a duty owed to a particular class or category of individuals, such that the \n12  failure to enforce those statutes breaches a duty that can sustain an action in tort.โ  Id. at \n13  402.  To prove that this exception applies, a plaintiff must show that:  โ[i] governmental \n14  agents responsible for enforcing statutory requirements possess actual knowledge of a \n15  statutory violation, [ii] fail to take corrective action despite a statutory duty to do so, and \n16 \n \n17 \n13 In their responses to the Cityโs interrogatories, Plaintiffs have identified three chapters of the Seattle \nMunicipal Code and numerous state statutes, see Pls.โ Resp. to Def.โs 2d Interrogs. Nos. 3โ4, Ex. 82 to \n18 \nFarmer Decl. (docket no. 75-82), which allegedly evidence governmental intent to protect the putative \nclass.  Plaintiffs, however, have not addressed these provisions in their motion or reply.  The legislative \n19  intent exception applies โwhen the terms of a legislative enactment evidence an intent to identify and \nprotect a particular and circumscribed class of persons.โ  Bailey v. Town of Forks, 108 Wn.2d 262, 268, \n20  737 P.2d 1257 (1987).  The intent must be โclearly expressed within the provisionโit will not be \nimplied.โ  Ravenscroft v. Wash. Water Power Co., 136 Wn.2d 911, 930, 969 P.2d 75 (1998).  Plaintiffs \nhave not presented sufficient evidence to show that any of the identified provisions were enacted to \n21 \nprotect the putative class.  Because Plaintiffs have not addressed the particular provisions at issue, the \nCourt cannot determine whether the legislative-intent exception should even be applied in this case, or \n22  whether application of the exception will generate common answers under Rule 23(a)(2). \n23 \nORDER - 23 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 24 of 37\n \n \n \n1  [iii] the plaintiff is within the class the statute intended to protect.โ  Id.

Pls.โ Resp. to Def.โs 2d Interrogs. Nos. 3โ4, \n7  Ex. 82 to Farmer Decl.  Whether any of these provisions impose a duty on the City, and \n8  whether the City breached that duty, cannot be resolved with generalized proof.  Even if \n9  the Court assumes that Plaintiffs have identified state statutes or municipal provisions \n10  that impose a duty on the City to take corrective action, to establish liability under the \n11  failure-to-enforce exception, Plaintiffs must show that the City had โactual knowledge of \n12  a statutory violation.โ  Ehrhart, 195 Wn.2d at 402.  But the proposed Class Area is large, \n13  stretching from Broadway in the west to Thirteenth Avenue in the east, and from East \n14  Denny Way in the north to East Pike Street in the south.  Plaintiffs estimate that this area \n15  contains at least 4,000 residents, 300 businesses, and 600 property owners.  Weaver Decl. \n16  at ยถ 2.   Knowledge of a particular statutory violation at the intersection of Broadway and \n17  East Pike Street would not impose a duty on the City with respect to a separate statutory \n18  violation near East Denny Way and Thirteenth Avenue for which the City had no \n19  knowledge.  Thus, the failure-to-enforce exception cannot be applied on a class-wide \n20  basis in this action. \n21 \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 24 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 25 of 37\n \n \n \n1  v.

But a putative class member who \n10  was never affected by the barriers is unlikely to have experienced a nuisance arising from \n11  blocked streets. \n12  Similarly, a putative class member who was not exposed to excessive noise cannot \n13  have experienced a noise-related nuisance.

This approach will not generate common \n4  answers as required Rule 23(a)(2). \n5  c.

Essentially, the \n5  City argues that Plaintiffs have defined the class so broadly that it is impossible to \n6  conclude that Plaintiffsโ claims and experiences are typical of those of the putative class \n7  members. \n8  The Court agrees that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate typicality in this case.  \n9  Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that their experiences and injuries are reasonably \n10  co-extensive with those of the putative class members.  For example, in the context of \n11  Plaintiffsโ nuisance claim, Plaintiffs have not shown that Ploszajโs (8) experience in his \n12  apartment, see Ploszaj Dep. at 77:18โ78:4, Ex. 16 to Weaver Decl., is similar to the \n13  experience of someone residing blocks away.  Similarly, Plaintiffs have not shown that \n14  Car Tenderโs (18) experience, see generally McDermott Dep., Ex. 47 to Farmer Decl., is \n15  similar to the experience of other businesses in the area, such as Unicorn Bar, which \n16  remained closed in June 2020 due to applicable COVID-19 restrictions.

(docket no. 66-1), might have \n2  suffered different injuries than a putative class member located outside the barriers, if \n3  they suffered any injuries at all.  The same is true for all of Plaintiffsโ claims.  The \n4  proposed class will capture thousands of property owners, business owners, and residents \n5  in the Class Area.  Plaintiffs contend that they, and the putative class, have suffered harm.  \n6  See generally Weaver Decl. (docket no. 66-1); McDermott Decl. (docket no. 67); \n7  Cronauer Decl.

The Court, \n9  however, having reviewed the evidence, cannot conclude that Plaintiffs and the putative \n10  class experienced similar circumstances, or that whether members of the putative class \n11  might have suffered harm could be decided on a class-wide basis. \n12  d.  Adequacy \n13  Plaintiffs must further show that they will โfairly and adequately protect the \n14  interests of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ.

Litig., 926 F.3d 539, 566 (9th Cir. 2019) \n2  (citation omitted). \n3  The City argues that Plaintiffs have failed to establish adequacy because some \n4  putative class membersโ opinions concerning CHOP are divided.  The Court finds these \n5  alleged conflicts, if any, to be trivial.  See In re Online DVD-Rental Antitrust Litig., 779 \n6  F.3d 934, 942 (9th Cir. 2015) (explaining that a district court does not โabuse its \n7  discretion [under Rule 23(a)(4)] when conflicts are trivialโ).  โOnly conflicts that are \n8  fundamental to the suit and that go to the heart of the litigation prevent a plaintiff from \n9  meeting the Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy requirement.โ  Id. (quoting 1 William B. Rubenstein \n10  et al., NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS ยง 3.58 (5th ed. 2011)).  โA conflict is fundamental \n11  when it goes to the specific issues in controversy,โ see id., or โwhere some [class \n12  members] claim to have been harmed by the same conduct that benefited other members \n13  of the class,โ AdTrader, Inc. v.

For example, a district court might find a fundamental \n16  conflict exists if a proposed class representative seeks to limit the classโs recovery to \n17  advance his or her own interests.  Id.

See Ex. 42 to Farmer Decl. (docket no. 75-41) (showing that the City settled a \n22  claim with Poquitos for $123.32); but see Fox Decl. at ยถยถ 7โ8 (docket no. 83) (a \n23 \nORDER - 30 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 31 of 37\n \n \n \n1  declaration from Poquitosโ owner explaining that the business suffered thousands of \n2  dollars in damages as a result of CHOP and the $123.32 claim against the City was for a \n3  broken window).  The City also cites a June 17, 2020, email in which a resident of the \n4  Broadway Building (14) expressed support for CHOP, see Ex. 23 to Farmer Decl. (docket \n5  no. 75-23), and a letter from a group of residents at an apartment building across the \n6  street from SPDโs East Precinct, explaining that some residents felt a โstrong sense of \n7  increased safety as the police forces abandoned the East Precinct and our streets,โ Ex. 22 \n8  to Farmer Decl. (docket no. 75-22 at 5).  Support for CHOP among some putative class \n9  members, however, is not a fundamental conflict of interest in this case, and Plaintiffs \n10  also support the free speech rights of many CHOP participants.  TAC at ยถ 1.  The City \n11  has not provided any reason to believe that Plaintiffs and their counsel could not \n12  prosecute this action vigorously on behalf of any putative class.  Therefore, the Court \n13  concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated adequacy under Rule 23(a)(4). \n14  3.  Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements \n15  a.  Predominance \n16  Even if Plaintiffs had satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a), certification of the \n17  proposed issues is still inappropriate because โquestions affecting only individual \n18  membersโ predominate.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In the context of Rule 23(c)(4), issue \n19  certification requires only that common questions predominate over individual questions \n20  with respect to the specific issues that are certified, as opposed to every issue in the case.  \n21  See Stickles v. Atria Senior Living, Inc., No. C20-09220, 2021 WL 6117702, at *7 \n22  (N.D. Cal.

As discussed above, all of \n4  Plaintiffsโ particular issues are not susceptible to common proof.  The issues necessarily \n5  require individualized inquiry into a class memberโs circumstances, such as the effects of \n6  COVID-19 regulations on member businesses, a class memberโs location within the Class \n7  Area and presence throughout the protest, the nature of a class memberโs alleged injuries, \n8  and the Cityโs knowledge of specific dangers.16 \n9  Plaintiffs argue that this case is similar to Hickey v. City of Seattle, 236 F.R.D. \n10  659, 660โ61 (W.D.

Class members in Hickey alleged that the City violated their \n13  constitutional rights when it arrested them en mass without individualized probable cause \n14  determinations.  Id. at 661.  In certifying a class, the court found that plaintiffs satisfied \n15  the predominance requirement under Rule 23(b)(3) and explained that the litigation \n16  would be phased as follows: \n17  In the first stage of the litigation, the Court will examine whether or not there \nwas a policy or action ratified by a qualified Seattle government decision \n18  maker that makes liability imputable to the municipal Defendants in this \nmatter.

Cal. 2015) (declining \nto certify an issues class under Rule 23(c)(4) where โcertification . . . of an issue would resolve only one \n22  of many issues necessary to establish only liabilityโ). \n23 \nORDER - 32 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 33 of 37\n \n \n \n1  damages determinations regarding whether or not each individualโs rights \nwere actually violated on December 1, 1999, and to what extent. \n2   \nId. at 666โ67.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to adopt this phased approach, but this case is \n3 \nentirely distinguishable from Hickey.  Here, the proposed class is comprised of thousands \n4 \nof individuals, businesses, and property owners in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, \n5 \nwhereas every class member in Hickey was a protester arrested in a designated โno \n6 \nprotest zone.โ  Id. at 661.  Plaintiffs in this case claim they were subject to diverse harms \n7 \n(violence, vandalism, harassment, blocked streets and sidewalks, excessive noise, and \n8 \nreduced business revenue) caused by the Cityโs actions, or inaction, in relation to CHOP, \n9 \nwhile every plaintiff in Hickey was subject to the same allegedly unlawful harm (mass \n10 \narrest without probable cause).  Id.  In this case, Plaintiffs have not made the requisite \n11 \nshowing that common questions of law or fact predominate over individual ones.  See \n12 \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \n13 \nb.  Superiority \n14 \nRule 23(b)(3) requires that a class action be โsuperior to other available methods \n15 \nfor fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  โA class action is the superior \n16 \nmethod for managing litigation if no realistic alternative exists.โ  Valentino, 97 F.3d at \n17 \n1234โ35.  A class action is not the superior method in this case because individualized \n18 \nfactual issues make it difficult to manage a class and undesirable to concentrate the \n19 \nlitigation of all claims in one forum.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(C) & (D).   \n20 \nFurthermore, class treatment is not superior because it would not resolve all of Plaintiffsโ \n21 \nclaims or the claims of individuals and entities located inside or outside the Class Area.  \n22 \n23 \nORDER - 33 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 34 of 37\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs concede that Greenus Building, Inc. (20), Madrona Real Estate Investors IV \n2  LLC (23), and Madrona Real Estate Investors VI LLC (22) are not even members of the \n3  putative class, and Hunters Capital, LLC (2, 3, 14, 15, 19, 20 & 21) and Redside Partners \n4  LLC (9, 16 & 25) seek damages for three properties located outside of the proposed Class \n5  Area.  Although Plaintiffs propose that the claims associated with these entities proceed \n6  alongside the claims of the class, all other property owners, businesses, and residents \n7  located outside the Class Area would be required to pursue new, individual suits.17  The \n8  proposed Class Area encompasses a large portion of Seattleโs Capitol Hill neighborhood, \n9  but it also excludes all individuals or entities located outside its boundaries.  Therefore, \n10  the Court concludes that, with respect to the issues identified, certifying a class is neither \n11  a superior means of โfairly and efficiently adjudicatingโ this controversy, Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12  23(b)(3), nor is it consistent with Rule 23(c)(4).18 \n13  4.  City Officialsโ Missing Text Messages \n14  Finally, Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify under Rule 23(c)(4) the following \n15  โparticular issuesโ concerning City officialsโ missing text messages: \n16 \n17 \n \n18  17 The City represented to the Court that many claimants have already filed tort claims against the City, \nsee generally Ex. 42 to Farmer Decl. (docket no. 75-42), demonstrating that individual actions are an \nacceptable way to proceed. \n19 \n18 Given the diverse group of plaintiffs in this case (property owners, businesses, and residents), the Court \n20  asked the parties to address at oral argument proposed methods for case management in the event the \nCourt denied Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification.  Plaintiffs and the City believe that it is manageable \nto try this action (for both liability and damages) in a single proceeding with the existing plaintiffs.  \n21 \nPlaintiffs and the City believe a four-week trial would be required.  Although the Court has serious \nquestions about case management moving forward, the certification of class issues would not benefit the \n22  litigants or the Court in managing this action. \n23 \nORDER - 34 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 35 of 37\n \n \n \n1  โข  What were the circumstances surrounding the deletion of responsive \ntexts for Mayor Jenny Durkan, Chief of Police Carmen Best, Fire Chief \n2  Harold Scoggins, and other City custodians? \nโข  What effect does the deletion of these texts have on the Cityโs ability to \n3  defend this case, and on the evidence to be presented at trial? \n \n4  Ex. 1 to Weaver Decl.  Class certification of a discovery issue is a unique request.  At \n5  oral argument, Plaintiffs represented to the Court that they sent a letter to the City on the \n6  day they filed their initial complaint in this action, June 24, 2020, demanding that the \n7  City preserve text messages from the Mayor, the fire chief, and the police chief.   \n8  According to Plaintiffs, Mayor Durkan testified at her deposition that she dropped her \n9  phone into the water while visiting a beach.  This occurred sometime after the City \n10  received Plaintiffsโ letter.  Plaintiffs allege that Mayor Durkan then accessed her iCloud \n11  account and deleted a backup that contained all of her text messages from the relevant \n12  time period.  When Plaintiffs spoke with City technicians who were involved in \n13  managing the Mayorโs phone, the technicians indicated that Mayor Durkan never \n14  informed them that she dropped her phone into the water.  The technicians also indicated \n15  that they could have recovered her text messages had Mayor Durkan informed them of \n16  the issue at or near the time that the text messages went missing.  \n17  Plaintiffs also allege that SFD Chief Harold Scogginsโs text messages were \n18  destroyed when he reset his iPhone at an Apple Store approximately one month after the \n19  City received Plaintiffsโ letter concerning the preservation of text messages in this action.  \n20  Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that former Chief Bestโs text messages went missing after \n21  she returned her phone to the City following her resignation.  During her deposition, \n22  Chief Best testified that her text messages from the relevant time period were still on her \n23 \nORDER - 35 \n \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 36 of 37\n \n \n \n1  phone when she returned it.  She did not know what happened to the messages after she \n2  returned her phone to the City.19 \n3  Plaintiffs argue that these issues satisfy class certification requirements under \n4  Rule 23(a) and (b)(3), but they have not provided any authority for class certification of \n5  discovery-related issues.  The only case Plaintiffs cite does not involve a class action.  \n6  See Musse v. King County, No. C18-1736, 2021 WL 4709875, at *2โ5 (W.D. Wash. Oct. \n7  8, 2021) (discussing the imposition of sanctions under Rule 37 for failing to preserve \n8  evidence).  Plaintiffsโ allegations are certainly troubling, and will no doubt be the subject \n9  of future motion practice, but the severity of Plaintiffsโ allegations is not the standard for \n10  issues class certification under Rule 23(c)(4).  These issues do not satisfy the \n11  commonality requirement under Rule 23(a)(2) because they will not resolve, โin one \n12  stroke,โ an issue that is central to the validity of Plaintiffsโ claims.  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at \n13  350.  Nor is certification of these issues appropriate under Rule 23(c)(4) because their \n14  resolution (i.e., potential sanctions if appropriate) is unlikely to materially advance the \n15  underlying case.  See Valentino, 97 F.3d at 1229.  The Court declines to certify the issues \n16  related to the missing text messages.  The issue of spoliation related to the Cityโs and \n17  Plaintiffsโ missing text messages, and the availability of potential remedies, if \n18  appropriate, must await further motion practice.20 \n19 \n \n20 \n19 The issue of spoliation is not limited to the Cityโs records.  The City argues that Plaintiffs have also lost \nor deleted relevant text messages in this case.  See, e.g., Thompson Dep. at 104:16โ106:13, Ex. 48 to \n21  Farmer Decl.; Donner Dep. at 197:20โ24 & 199:4โ14, Ex. 19 to Farmer Decl. \n20 To the extent Plaintiffs are successful in obtaining a favorable ruling in regard to their spoliation claim, \n22  such a ruling will be binding on the City, whether or not the Court were to certify the class. \n23 \nORDER - 36 \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 96   Filed 05/09/22   Page 37 of 37\n1  Conclusion \n2  For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS: \n3  (1) Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification, docket no. 65, is DENIED.\n4  Plaintiffs have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the particular issues \n5  they desire to certify satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule \n6  23(a)(2) and (3), or the predominance and superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). \n7  (2) The parties are DIRECTED, on or before May 27, 2022, to meet and confer\n8  and file a Joint Status Report proposing methods for case management in this action.  The \n9  parties should explore the possible trial of three or four representative plaintiffs (to be \n10  selected by the parties and/or the Court), or other ways to address the complex nature of \n11  this action given the variety and number of named plaintiffs.  The parties should also \n12  address whether amendment to the case schedule and trial date will be necessary.  See \n13  Order (docket no. 46).  The Court will schedule a status conference to address case \n14  management after it reviews the partiesโ Joint Status Report. \n15  (3)  The Clerk is directed to send a copy of this Order to all counsel of record. \n16  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n17  Dated this 9th day of May, 2022. \nA\n18 \n19  Thomas S.

Having reviewed all papers filed in support of, and in \n4 \nopposition to, the motions, the Court enters the following Order. \n5 \nBackground \n6 \n  On June 8, 2020, with nationwide civil rights protests ongoing, the City โabruptly \n7 \ndesertedโ the Seattle Police Departmentโs (โSPDโ) East Precinct, located on the corner of \n8 \nTwelfth Avenue and East Pine Street in Seattleโs Capitol Hill neighborhood.  First \n9 \nAmended Class Action Complaint (โFACโ) at ยถ 3 (docket no. 9).  Almost immediately \n10 \nafter the SPD abandoned the East Precinct, protestors declared the area โFree Capitol \n11 \nHillโ to create a โno-copโ zone, and they used large barriers that the City left behind to \n12 \nblock off streets within one block of the precinct.  Id. at ยถยถ 36โ38.  As the zone expanded, \n13 \nit first became known as the โCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone,โ a.k.a. โCHAZ,โ and \n14 \neventually became known as the โCapitol Hill Organized Protestโ or โCapitol Hill \n15 \nOccupying Protest,โ a.k.a. โCHOPโ (collectively, โCHOPโ).  Id. at ยถยถ 1, 38.  CHOPโs \n16 \nunofficial boundaries stretched north to East Denny Way, east to Thirteenth Avenue, \n17 \nsouth to East Pike Street, and west to Broadway Avenue, encompassing Cal Anderson \n18 \nPark and 16 city blocks in all.  Id. at ยถ 39.  \n19 \n  CHOP participants claimed the area as their own, which was allegedly governed \n20 \nby a โloose form of governance and justiceโ and which they secured by physically \n21 \nbarricading and patrolling the areaโs borders.  Id. at ยถยถ 40โ41.  Many CHOP participants \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 2 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 3 of 30\n \n \n \n1  set up tents and started living on the streets, sidewalks, and in Cal Anderson Park.  Id. at \n2  ยถ 42.  They allegedly occupied the streets and sidewalks 24 hours per day, hosting \n3  speeches, debates, movies, music, and even illegal fireworks shows, causing disturbances \n4  and noise pollution well past 10 p.m., and usually into the early hours of the next day.  Id. \n5  at ยถ 47.  Certain CHOP participants served as a โreplacement police forceโ by demanding \n6  that business owners release individuals suspected of crimes and conducting their own \n7  crime investigations.  Id. at ยถ 46.  Some CHOP participants were observed carrying guns \n8  in broad daylight.  Id. at ยถ 48. \n9    According to Plaintiffs, the City โentirely handed overโ the approximately 7-acre \n10  Cal Anderson Park to the CHOP participants.  Id. at ยถ 49.  The City also allegedly \n11  provided CHOP participants with medical equipment, washing/sanitation facilities, \n12  portable toilets, nighttime lighting, and other material support.  Id. at ยถยถ 49, 179โ180.  \n13  The City further allowed CHOP participants to build makeshift gardens in the park โto \n14  grow food for CHOP,โ id. at ยถ 52, with the Mayor tweeting her support for the โnew \n15  community garden popping up in Cal Anderson Park,โ id. at ยถ 182(g).  Plaintiffs allege \n16  that members of the public could not use the park, and if they got too close, CHOP \n17  participants threatened them or their property.  Id. at ยถ 51.  Moreover, the โhundreds of \n18  CHOP participants in the park created excessive noise . . . at all hours of the day and \n19  night.โ  Id. at ยถ 53.  โTrash, feces, and other refuse built up in the park, affecting the \n20  whole area.โ  Id.  The park was allegedly one of the most violent areas of CHOP, and \n21  local residents witnessed individuals carrying firearms in the park.  Id.  As a result of the \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 3 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 4 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Cityโs alleged actions, the park โwas transformed into a massive tent city for CHOP \n2  participants,โ id. at ยถ 50, as shown below: \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n \n9 \n  [Photos provided at FAC at ยถ 51] \n10 \n  On June 11, Mayor Jenny Durkan tweeted that CHOP โis not a lawless wasteland \n11 \nof anarchist insurrectionโit is a peaceful expression of our communityโs collective grief \n12 \nand their desire to build a better world.โ  Id. at ยถ 182(a).  That same day, during a joint \n13 \npress conference with SPD Chief of Police Carmen Best, the Mayor reiterated that area \n14 \nโis not an armed ANTIFA militia no-go zoneโ and that โblocks of Seattle in Capitol Hill \n15 \n[have] shut down every summer for everything from Block Party to Pride.โ  Id. at \n16 \nยถ 182(d).  The Mayor also stated that the area โis not really that much of an operational \n17 \nchallenge[,] [b]ut we want to make sure that the businesses and residents feel safe and \n18 \nweโll continue to move that forward.โ  Id.  At the time, โthe City communicated clearly to \n19 \nCHOP participants that they may continue occupying the area . . . because [the City is] \n20 \ntrying to do things that are responsible.โ  Id. at ยถ 181.  For her part, the Police Chief \n21 \nstated that โSPD has a responsibility to provide public safety services to the entire East \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 4 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 5 of 30\n \n \n \n1  precinct and the Cityโ and that the โactions of a small group cannot and should not \n2  deprive an entire segment of our community from public-safety services.โ  Id. at ยถ 57.  \n3  The Police Chief also stated that โ[i]n the first day of the SPD not having access to the \n4  [East] precinct, response times for crimes in progress were over fifteen minutes, about \n5  three times as long as the average.โ  Id.  The Police Chief said that โ[t]he difference in the \n6  amount of time could protect someoneโs life and prevent a violent attack.โ  Id. \n7    The next day, on June 12, the Mayor was asked during a CNN interview โhow \n8  long the City would allow CHOP participants to continue,โ and the Mayor responded: โI \n9  donโt know.  We could have the Summer of Love.โ  Id. at ยถ 181(b).  She again stated that \n10  CHOP โis more like a block party atmosphereโ and that โwe will make sure that we can \n11  restore this[,]โ [b]ut we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time.  \n12  Itโs known for that.โ  Id. at ยถ 182(f). \n13    On June 16, the City allegedly โreached an informal agreementโ with CHOP \n14  participants to allow limited one-way access on certain streets within the area.  Id. at \n15  ยถ 177.  As part of that agreement, Plaintiffs allege that โthe City actually fortified the rest \n16  of CHOPโ by providing participants with sturdier concrete barriers.  Id. at ยถยถ 174(d), 177. \n17  Although CHOP participants allegedly reestablished impediments on those limited-access \n18  streets, the Cityโs response was โapparently to do nothing.โ  Id. at ยถ 177.  The City issued \n19  a press release that day stating that โCity officials have been on site on Capitol Hill to \n20  work [to] meet community needs including hygiene, sanitation and safety,โ and that they \n21  had met with CHOP โorganizers, small businesses, and residents to discuss proposed \n22  changes to the protest zone.โ  Id. at ยถ 174(b).  That day, the Mayor also suggested that the \n23 \n  ORDER - 5 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 6 of 30\n \n \n \n1  City agreed to deploy police to CHOP only for โsignificant life-safety issues,โ such as \n2  โan active shooter incident, an assault, a structure fire, significant medical emergency, \n3  and other incidents that threaten a personโs life safety.โ  Id. at ยถ 181(e).1 \n4    Plaintiffs allege that the City โadopted a policy supporting the CHOP occupation, \n5  acting with deliberate indifference toward those suffering harms from it.โ  Id. at ยถ 174.  \n6  Plaintiffs also allege that because of the City-provided barriers that CHOP participants \n7  used in the streets and sidewalks, local residents could not use public streets, sidewalks, \n8  or other rights-of-way to enter their homes or businesses, they could not receive \n9  deliveries, and their clients were unable to visit their businesses.  Id. at ยถยถ 70โ71, 74.  \n10  Plaintiffs allege that garbage and recycling services could not enter CHOP, forcing them \n11  to pile up their refuse.  Id. at ยถ 73.  In addition, Plaintiffs allege that they did not have \n12  โfull useโ of their property that was normally freely accessible, including their garages, in \n13  order to prevent vandalism to their properties.  Id. at ยถ 72.  Plaintiffs also allege that \n14  CHOP participants painted graffiti on most available surfaces in the area.  Id. at ยถ 43.  If a \n15  property owner painted over the graffiti, CHOP participants allegedly replaced the graffiti \n16  or threatened business owners if they painted over the graffiti.  Examples of the allegedly \n17  pervasive graffiti are shown below: \n18 \n19 \n20 \n \n21 \n1 The Court takes judicial notice of the full press release, see FAC at ยถยถ 181(e) & n.7, available at \n22  https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/.  \n23 \n  ORDER - 6 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 7 of 30\n \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n \n7 \n  [Photos provided at FAC at ยถยถ 42โ43] \n8 \n  Plaintiffs allege, โ[o]n information and belief,โ that the City considered the area \n9 \nfrom Denny Way to Union Street and Thirteenth Avenue to Broadway Avenue to be a \n10 \nโno responseโ zone, and it adopted a policy and practice of not entering CHOP except in \n11 \nthe case of โthe most seriousโ or โlife-threatening crimesโ; and even then, SPDโs \n12 \nresponse was allegedly โweakโ and โdelayed.โ  Id. at ยถยถ 55โ56; see id. at ยถ 181(e). \n13 \n  On June 20, at around 2:20 a.m., two people were shot in CHOP:  One victim died \n14 \nbefore reaching the hospital, and the other victim was admitted with life-threatening \n15 \ninjuries.  Id. at ยถ 59.  According to Plaintiffs, a video posted on Facebook.com shows that \n16 \nmedical personnel responded to the first victim about 15 minutes into the video and that \n17 \npolice officers started to arrive three minutes later.  Id. at ยถ 60.  Once the police arrived, \n18 \nthe video allegedly shows that CHOP participants โimmediately surrounded, yelled at, \n19 \nand pursuedโ the officers.  Id.  CHOP participants also allegedly created a human chain \n20 \nto bar any further entry of the police.  Id.  That video allegedly shows that no government \n21 \nofficial responded to the other victim, and that victim was transported to the hospital in โa \n22 \n23 \n  ORDER - 7 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 8 of 30\n \n \n \n1  plain white cargo van.โ  Id.  The police allegedly did not investigate that crime scene in \n2  the aftermath of the shooting, and no suspects have been identified or taken into custody.  \n3  Id. \n4    The next day, on June 21, the Mayor allegedly issued a statement indicating that \n5  the โCity still had no plans to cease supporting CHOP and that the City was instead \n6  acting to work with and preserve CHOP.โ  Id. at ยถ 182(k).  That night, at about 11 p.m., \n7  another victim in CHOP was shot and was transported to the hospital by a private vehicle.  \n8  Id. at ยถ 61. \n9    On June 22, the Mayor and the Police Chief gave a joint press conference, with the \n10  Mayor stating that โ[t]he cumulative impacts of gatherings and protests and the nighttime \n11  atmosphere and violence has led to increasingly difficult circumstances for our \n12  businesses and residents.โ  Id. at ยถ 174(f).  Similarly, the Police Chief stated that some \n13  CHOP participants were โengaging in shootings, a rape, assaults, burglary, arson, and \n14  property destruction.โ  Id. at ยถ 174(g).   \n15    On June 29, in early hours, yet another shooting in CHOP occurred, during which \n16  more than a dozen shots were fired by โCHOP securityโ after a white jeep crashed into \n17  the barricades.  Id. at ยถยถ 63โ64.  This shooting left a 16-year-old dead and a 14-year-old \n18  in critical condition.  Id. at ยถ 63.2  According to Plaintiffs, no medical or police personnel \n19  responded to the crime scene at that time.  Id. at ยถ 65.  Instead, one of the victims was \n20 \n \n21 \n2 Plaintiffs allege that before CHOP was established, there had been no homicides in the entire Capitol \nHill neighborhood in 2020 and in 2019, there had been only three homicides in the neighborhood.

Id.  By the time \n3  the police reached the crime scene, the police acknowledged that โit was very clear the \n4  crime scene had been disturbedโ and to date, no suspects have been identified or placed \n5  into custody.  Id. at ยถ 66.  The Police Chief gave a press conference that day, stating that \n6  โeverybody in city government has been talking about what we can do to have a \n7  reasonable response . . . , but we also recognize that a place where we have seen now two \n8  murders, multiple people injured, there needs to be some more action for public safety.  I \n9  think everyone can agree on that.โ  Id. at ยถ 174(h).  That same night, more shots were \n10  fired into the building of Plaintiff Onyx Condominium, possibly in connection with the \n11  earlier shooting, and at least one bullet came within a foot of a resident asleep in bed.  Id. \n12  at ยถ 67. \n13    On July 1, the City cleared the area occupied by CHOP.  Id. at ยถ 184.  At a press \n14  conference, the Police Chief stated that she was โstunned by the amount of graffiti, \n15  garbage, and property destructionโ in CHOP and that โwe donโt even know how much \n16  trauma people were experiencing because of what was happening in that area.โ  Id. at \n17  ยถ 79.  She also stated that โwhat has happened here on these streets over the last two \n18  weeksโfew weeks, that isโis lawless and itโs brutal and bottom line it is simply \n19  unacceptable.โ  Id. at ยถ 174(j).  Plaintiffs allege that the clearing of CHOP was โeasilyโ \n20  accomplished and โwithout violence on either side,โ demonstrating that the City could \n21  have and should have cleared the area much earlier.

Id. at ยถ 146.  On June 23, Madrona Real \n10 \nEstate called the police to assist it in removing trespassers from a property \nlocated immediately outside of CHOPโs boundaries, but an officer \n11 \nresponded that they โare not allowed to come within two blocks of CHOP.โ  \nId. at ยถ 147.  In addition, Madrona Real Estateโs parking revenue was only \n12 \nโa small fraction of the averageโ in June 2020.

Id. at ยถยถ 156โ57, 159. \n15 \nโข  Plaintiff Olive ST Apartments LLC similarly alleged that tenants have \nmoved out because of the nearby presence of CHOP and that it has been \n16 \nunable to attract new renters to the area.  Id. at ยถ 164. \n17  โข  Plaintiff Rancho Bravo, Inc. alleges that CHOP participants, without \nRancho Bravoโs permission, created a โmedical tentโ in the outside seating \n18  areas in front of its restaurant; and CHOP participants allegedly maintained \nvarious unpermitted food dispensaries and stores on public property \n19  adjacent to its premises.

County of Los Angeles, 477 F.3d 652, 667 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting \n5  Monell, 436 U.S. at 694โ95); see also Harper v. City of Los Angeles, 533 F.3d 1010, \n6  1026 (9th Cir. 2008) (โTo meet this causation requirement, the plaintiff must establish \n7  both causation-in-fact and proximate causation.โ).  โThe requisite causal connection can \n8  be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in the deprivation, \n9  but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the [government] actor \n10  knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.โ  \n11  Lacey v. Maricopa County, 693 F.3d 896, 915 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Johnson v. Duffy, \n12  588 F.2d 740, 743โ44 (9th Cir. 1978)).  A municipalityโs โomi[ssion] to perform an act \n13  which [it] is legally required to doโ may be sufficient to show that it caused a plaintiff to \n14  suffer a deprivation of a constitutional right under ยง 1983.  Id. at 915, 940. \n15    Plaintiffs allege facts indicating that the City and the Mayor officially supported \n16  the establishment of an autonomous zone within CHOPโs boundaries, FAC at ยถยถ 174, \n17  177, 181โ82; that the City provided concrete barriers, medical supplies, \n18  washing/sanitation facilities, portable toilets, lighting, and other material support to \n19  CHOP participants, including handing over Cal Anderson Park to them, id. at ยถยถ 37โ38, \n20  49โ50, 52, 167, 179(d); and that the City adopted a โno responseโ policy and practice \n21  within CHOP, refusing to send police officers into CHOP unless the 9-1-1 caller reported \n22  โsignificant life-safety issues,โ id. at ยถยถ 55โ56, 89, 124โ25, 132, 135, 146โ47, 181(e).  \n23 \n  ORDER - 13 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 14 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs further allege that as a result of the Cityโs CHOP-related policies and practices, \n2  their properties were blocked off from access to public streets and rights-of-way, they \n3  were otherwise unable to use and enjoy their properties, and they were deprived of basic \n4  public-safety services.  Id. at ยถยถ 7โ8, 50, 81, 202.   \n5    Plaintiffs plausibly allege that โ[t]he Cityโs endorsement and recognition of CHOP \n6  went so far that SPD adopted a policy and practice of not entering the area except in the \n7  case of life-threatening crimes,โ thereby creating a โno responseโ zone within the area.  \n8  FAC at ยถยถ 55โ56.  Clearly, the Cityโs conduct, as alleged by the FAC, may have been the \n9  โmoving forceโ behind the alleged constitutional violations, see Galen, 477 F.3d at 667, \n10  and the causal link between the Cityโs actions and the harm to Plaintiffs would have been \n11  foreseeable.

FAC at \n12  ยถยถ 196โ97.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that from June 8 to July 1, 2020, CHOP \n13  participants used City-provided barriers, with the Cityโs approval, to block access from \n14  their properties to streets, sidewalks, and other public rights-of-way.  Id. at ยถยถ 70, 177, \n15  211โ13.  Many of the Plaintiffs also allege that because of CHOPโs existence, and the \n16  rampant crime and vandalism that ensued, they were deprived of all (or nearly all) \n17  economic use of their properties.  Id. at ยถยถ 97, 101, 109, 113โ14, 118.

Ct. 975, 108 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1990) (citation omitted).  \n2  โAs a general matter, [the U.S. Supreme Court] has always been reluctant to expand the \n3  concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in \n4  this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.โ  Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 \n5  U.S. 115, 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1992).  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit \n6  has cautioned that โ[w]here a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of \n7  constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, that \n8  Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process, must be the \n9  guide for analyzing these claims.โ  Armendariz v. Penman, 75 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. \n10  1996), overruled in part on other grounds as recognized in Crown Point Dev., Inc. v. City \n11  of Sun Valley, 506 F.3d 851, 852 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation \n12  omitted); see, e.g., Esplanade Props., LLC v. City of Seattle, 307 F.3d 978, 982โ83 (9th \n13  Cir. 2002) (affirming dismissal of plaintiffsโ substantive due process claim because the \n14  Takings Clause provided an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against \n15  private takings and was therefore the guide in reviewing the claim). \n16    Also, โ[a]s a general matter, . . . a Stateโs failure to protect an individual against \n17  private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.โ  \n18  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 \n19  L. Ed. 2d 249 (1989).  There are, however, certain exceptions to this general rule.  For \n20  example, in DeShaney, the Court held that where the local government affirmatively acts \n21  to โrestrain[] the individualโs freedom to act on his own behalfโthrough incarceration, \n22  institutionalization, or other similar restraint of personal liberty,โ such actions may give \n23 \n  ORDER - 17 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 18 of 30\n \n \n \n1  rise to a substantive due process claim.  Id. at 200.  Likewise, the Ninth Circuit has held \n2  that a local government may violate substantive due process if it โโaffirmatively places [a \n3  plaintiff] . . . in danger by acting with โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a โknown or obvious \n4  danger.โโ  Martinez v. City of Clovis, 943 F.3d 1260, 1271 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting \n5  Patel v. Kent Sch. Dist., 648 F.3d 965, 971โ72 (9th Cir. 2011)).  To prevail on such a \n6  theory, known as the โstate-created danger doctrine,โ a plaintiff must show that (1) โthe \n7  officersโ affirmative actions created or exposed her to an actual, particularized danger \n8  that she would not otherwise have faced,โ (2) โthe injury . . . suffered was foreseeable,โ \n9  and (3) โthe officers were deliberately indifferent to the known danger.โ  Id.   \n10    In this case, the Court first considers whether the Takings Clause โprovides an \n11  explicit textual source of constitutional protection againstโ the Cityโs alleged conduct.  \n12  Armendariz, 75 F.3d at 1319.  According to Plaintiffs, the Cityโs โassistance, \n13  endorsements, and encouragements of CHOP greatly increased the likelihood of property \n14  damage, . . . personal injury, . . . and other damages to Plaintiffs.โ  FAC at ยถ 206.  That is, \n15  Plaintiffs allege that in addition to being deprived of certain property interests, they were \n16  also deprived of at least one liberty interest, i.e., the right โto be protected from state-\n17  created dangers.โ  Id. at ยถยถ 205โ06.  Recognizing that Plaintiffsโ substantive due process \n18  claim rests on deprivations of both property and liberty interests, the Court concludes that \n19  the Plaintiffsโ takings claim does not subsume or preempt their substantive due process \n20  claim.  See Crown Point Dev., 506 F.3d at 852โ53. \n21    Next, turning to whether Plaintiffs have stated a substantive due process claim, \n22  Plaintiffs allege that the Cityโs affirmative actions exposed them to actual, particularized \n23 \n  ORDER - 18 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 19 of 30\n \n \n \n1  harm that they otherwise would not have faced.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that on or \n2  around June 16, 2020, the City adopted in a โno responseโ strategy with respect to \n3  CHOP, after negotiating with CHOP participants.  FAC at ยถยถ 56, 177, 181(c)โ(e).  This \n4  strategy purportedly resulted in police and other emergency personnel refusing to respond \n5  to 9-1-1 calls made from within or near CHOP.  Id. at ยถยถ 98, 132, 147.  Some Plaintiffs \n6  allegedly called 9-1-1 to report incidents involving personal injuries or threats of personal \n7  injury, but they were unable to secure assistance.  Id. at ยถยถ 87โ89, 126, 135, 140, 143.  \n8  Plaintiffs likewise allege that the City provided concrete barriers to CHOP participants \n9  and allowed them to seal off Plaintiffsโ neighborhood from the rest of the city.  Id. at \n10  ยถยถ 7, 68, 174(d).  Finally, Plaintiffs allege facts suggesting that their injuries were \n11  foreseeable, and that the City was deliberately indifferent to this known danger.  See id. at \n12  ยถยถ 57, 62, 174(h), 182(k).  \n13    The Court concludes that these allegations are sufficient to state a substantive due \n14  process claim under the state-created danger exception.  Plaintiffs plausibly allege that \n15  the Cityโs actionsโencouraging CHOP participants to wall off the area and agreeing to a \n16  โno responseโ zone within and near CHOPโs bordersโforeseeably placed Plaintiffs in a \n17  worse position than they would have been in absent any City intervention whatsoever.5  \n18  Their allegations are also sufficient to show that the City acted with deliberate \n19   \n20  5 The Cityโs reliance on Johnson v. City of Seattle, 474 F.3d 634 (9th Cir. 2007) is unpersuasive.  In \nJohnson, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Cityโs โdecision to switch from a more aggressive operation \nplan to a more passive one was not affirmative conduct that placed [the plaintiffs] in danger, because it \n21 \ndid not place them in any worse position than they would have been in had the police not come up with \nany operation plan whatsoever.โ  Id. at 641.  Here, however, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they \n22  would have been better off had the City not intervened at all. \n23 \n  ORDER - 19 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 20 of 30\n \n \n \n1  indifference to that danger.  See Hernandez v. City of San Jose, 897 F.3d 1125, 1138โ39 \n2  (9th Cir. 2018) (allegations that officers โshepherded [plaintiffs] into a violent crowd of \n3  protestors and actively prevented them from reaching safety . . . even though [the \n4  officers] knew the mob had attackedโ others earlier, were sufficient to state a substantive \n5  due process claim). \n6  D.  Unlawful Taking โ Third Cause of Action \n7    The Takings Clause, which applies to local governments through the Fourteenth \n8  Amendment, provides: โ[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just \n9  compensation.โ  U.S. Const. amend. V; see Webbโs Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. \n10  Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 160, 101 S. Ct. 446, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1980).  To establish a \n11  violation of the Takings Clause, a plaintiff must show that โโan independent source such \n12  as state lawโ . . . define[s] the range of interests that qualify for protection as โpropertyโ \n13  under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.โ  Lucas v.

Once a state-created property \n16  right is established, the Court must then determine โwhether [that] property right has been \n17  abridged improperly (taken without just compensation) or whether a plaintiff has given \n18  up the right to assert such a claim,โ which are โquestion[s] of federal law.โ  Vandevere, \n19  644 F.3d at 963โ64. \n20    Under Washington law, โ[t]he right of access of an abutting property owner to a \n21  public right-of-way is a property right which if taken or damaged for a public use \n22  requires compensation.โ  Keiffer, 89 Wn.2d at 372.

With respect to the first grouping, Plaintiffs have failed to \n18  plausibly allege that individuals living in โareas occupied by CHOPโ are similarly \n19  situated to individuals living in โother areas of the City.โ  Although Plaintiffs plausibly \n20 \n \n21 \n8 The City characterizes Plaintiffsโ claim as a โclass of oneโ equal protection claim, and Plaintiffs \n22  acknowledge that they โpled this theory.โ  Response (docket no. 12 at 24 & n.6); see FAC at ยถ 225. \n23 \n  ORDER - 24 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 25 of 30\n \n \n \n1  allege that the City treated the two groups differently after CHOP was created, FAC at \n2  ยถยถ 226โ27, they do not allege any facts suggesting that they are similarly situated to the \n3  control group, e.g., that the other areas in the city were also occupied by a large group of \n4  organizers.  To the contrary, Plaintiffsโ allegations emphasize the unprecedented nature \n5  of CHOPโs creationโthat after SPD abandoned the East Precinct, organizers โwho \n6  gathered on Capitol Hillโ โform[ed]โ or โcreatedโ CHOP.  Id. at ยถยถ 1โ2, 35โ37.  By \n7  failing to allege facts showing that other areas of the City were similarly situated to areas \n8  occupied by CHOP, Plaintiffs merely conflate all persons not injured outside of CHOP \n9  into a preferred class.  Thornton, 425 F.3d at 1167; see Ruston, 610 F.3d at 60 \n10  (concluding that none of the alleged control-group properties were similar to plaintiffโs \n11  proposed development, โlet alone so similar that no rational person could see them as \n12  differentโ). \n13    The second grouping asserted by PlaintiffsโPlaintiffs versus CHOP \n14  participantsโsuffers from similar defects.  Plaintiffs argue that the โbias โin favorโโ of \n15  CHOP participants, based on the Cityโs preference for their viewpoints, violates the \n16  Equal Protection Clause โbecause such favoritism necessarily entails disfavor to others.โ  \n17  Response (docket no. 12 at 26); see FAC at ยถยถ 221โ22.  The only case that Plaintiffs cite \n18  in support of that novel argument is Elliot-Park v. Manglona, 592 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. \n19  2010); but in that case, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the plaintiff plausibly asserted an \n20  equal protection claim against police officers based on allegations that her perpetrator \n21  โwas given a pass by the police because of the officersโ alleged racial bias not only in \n22  favor of [her perpetrator] as a Micronesian, but also against her as a Korean.โ  Id. at 1006 \n23 \n  ORDER - 25 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 26 of 30\n \n \n \n1  (emphasis added).  Put simply, an allegation that the government favors a certain class or \n2  viewpoint, standing alone, is insufficient to show that the government necessarily \n3  disfavors the plaintiffโs alleged class or viewpoint for purposes of equal protection \n4  analysis.  See Gallinger, 898 F.3d at 1021 (โAccommodating one interest group is not \n5  equivalent to intentionally harming another.โ). \n6    Not only do Plaintiffs fail to allege that they hold a viewpoint that is disfavored by \n7  the City, they also allege that they โsupport the efforts of those like Black Lives Matter \n8  who . . . are bringing issues such as systemic racism and unfair violence against African \n9  Americans by police to the forefront of the national consciousnessโ and that they \n10  โsupport the free-speech rights of many of those who gathered on Capitol Hill to form \n11  what has been called . . . โCHOP.โโ  FAC at ยถยถ 1, 12.  According to the Plaintiffs, that \n12  viewpoint is also favored by the City.  Id. at ยถยถ 10, 218, 221โ24. \n13    Even assuming that the asserted classes are similarly situated, the Cityโs actions \n14  are โpresumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification . . . is rationally \n15  related to a legitimate state interest.โ  Gallinger, 898 F.3d at 1017; FCC v. Beach \n16  Comms., Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211 (1993) (โIn areas of \n17  social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect \n18  lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against [an] equal \n19  protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could \n20  provide a rational basis for the classification.โ).  Plaintiffs argue that the Court should \n21  apply heightened scrutiny in this case because the Cityโs alleged actions โaffected the \n22  fundamental right of free speech.โ  Response (docket no. 12 at 26โ27).  However, \n23 \n  ORDER - 26 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 27 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that the City disfavored the Plaintiffsโ viewpoint or \n2  treated them differently on that basis.  The Court concludes that rational-basis review \n3  applies to this case, as currently pleaded.  See Beach Comms., 508 U.S. at 313; see also \n4  Squaw Valley, 375 F.3d at 944.9 \n5    Applying rational-basis review, Plaintiffโs allegations are insufficient to overcome \n6  the presumption that the Cityโs different treatment of CHOP residents was rational \n7  because there is simply no indication that other areas of the city were being โoverrunโ or \n8  โoccupiedโ by a large group of protestors.  See FAC at ยถยถ 2โ5; Gallinger, 898 F.3d at \n9  1018โ20 (refusing โto second-guessโ the governmentโs determination that its unequal \n10  treatment advanced legitimate governmental interests, including the protection of retired \n11  peace officers and public safety, and affirming the district courtโs dismissal of the equal \n12  protection claim). \n13    Absent any allegations indicating that the City intentionally treated Plaintiffs \n14  differently than similarly situated individuals, and without any rational basis for doing so, \n15  the Court concludes that Plaintiffs did not plead sufficient facts to support their equal \n16  protection claim.  The claim is dismissed without prejudice.  See Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d \n17  1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that โa district court should grant leave to amend \n18  even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading \n19  could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other factsโ) (citation omitted). \n20 \n \n21 \n9 Even if the Court were to apply heightened scrutiny, Plaintiffsโ conclusory allegation that other groups \n22  were similarly situated are nonetheless insufficient to support their equal protection challenge. \n23 \n  ORDER - 27 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 28 of 30\n \n \n \n1  F.  Class Certification \n2    In determining whether discovery is necessary to establish the existence of a class \n3  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, โthe better and more advisable practice for a \n4  District Court to follow is to afford the litigants an opportunity to present evidence as to \n5  whether a class action was maintainable.โ  Doninger v. Pac. Nw. Bell, Inc., 564 F.2d \n6  1304, 1313 (9th Cir. 1977).  The federal authority addressing this issue โstand[s] for the \n7  unremarkable position that often the pleadings alone will not resolve the question of class \n8  certification and that some discovery will be warranted.โ  Vinole v. Countrywide Home \n9  Loans, Inc., 571 F.3d 935, 942 & n.6 (9th Cir. 2009); cf. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n10  564 U.S. 338, 350, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (concluding that โRule 23 \n11  does not set forth a mere pleading standardโ and that โ[a] party seeking class \n12  certification . . . must be prepared to prove that there are in fact . . . common questions of \n13  law or fact, etc.โ).  A district court may deny class certification, without first providing \n14  proposed class members an opportunity to conduct discovery, only under limited \n15  circumstancesโwhere, for example, they โfail to make even a prima facie showing of \n16  Rule 23โs prerequisites.โ See Doninger, 564 F.2d at 1313. \n17    The Court concludes that it would be improper to decide class certification on the \n18  pleadings.  It is entirely plausible that Plaintiffs, after discovery, could present evidence \n19  consistent with the allegations in the FAC to make a prima facie showing of Rule 23โs \n20  prerequisites, including the commonality requirement and the predominance requirement.  \n21  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), (b)(3).  For example, Plaintiffsโ evidence could plausibly show \n22  that the City adopted a policy and practice of endorsing CHOP, or that the City knew or \n23 \n  ORDER - 28 \n \n\n \nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 23   Filed 10/16/20   Page 29 of 30\n \n \n \n1  should have known that its actions would result in harm to Plaintiffs and the proposed \n2  class members.  FAC at ยถ 189; see also id. at ยถยถ 174, 182; see Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 \n3  (requiring that class membersโ claims โdepend upon a common contentionโ and that the \n4  common contention be โcapable of classwide resolutionโwhich means that \n5  determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of \n6  each one of the claims in one strokeโ).  The Court will therefore afford Plaintiffs an \n7  opportunity to discover evidence to demonstrate whether there are in fact common \n8  questions that predominate over individualized inquires.  Cf. Doninger, 564 F.2d at 1313; \n9  Vinole, 571 F.3d at 942, 948 (concluding that the district court did not abuse discretion in \n10  granting defendantโs motion to deny class certification where plaintiffs โwere provided \n11  with adequate time in which to conduct discovery related to the question of class \n12  certificationโ).  At this stage in the proceedings, the Cityโs motion to deny class \n13  certification is DENIED without prejudice pending discovery.  \n14  Conclusion \n15  For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS: \n16  (1)  The motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action based on equal protection \n17  is GRANTED.

OVERVIEW \n10  1.  The  rights  of  free  speech  and  to  peaceably  assemble  are  enshrined  in  our \n11  constitutional tradition. Plaintiffs support free-speech rights and support the efforts of those like \n12  Black Lives Matter who, by exercising such rights, are bringing issues such as systemic racism \n13  and  unfair  violence  against  African  Americans  by  police  to  the  forefront  of  the  national \n14  consciousness.  Specifically,  Plaintiffs  support  the  free-speech  rights  of  many  of  those  who \n15  gathered on Capitol Hill to form what has been called โCHAZ,โ standing for the โCapitol Hill \n16  Autonomous Zone,โ or โCHOPโ for โCapitol Hill Organized Protestโ or โCapitol Hill Occupying \n17  Protest.โ1   \n18  2.  This lawsuit does not seek to undermine CHOP participantsโ message or present a \n19  counter-message.  Rather,  this  lawsuit  is  about  the  constitutional  and  other  legal  rights  of \n20  Plaintiffsโbusinesses, employees, and residents in and around CHOPโwhich were overrun by \n21  the City of Seattleโs unprecedented decision to abandon and close off an entire city neighborhood, \n22  leaving  it  unchecked  by  the  police,  unserved  by  fire  and  emergency  health  services,  and \n23  inaccessible to the public at large. The Cityโs decision subjected businesses, employees, and \n24 \n \n25 \n1 This complaint primarily refers to the area as โCHOP,โ and the people who participated in CHOP who are not \nbusinesses, employees, or residents of the area as โCHOP participants.โ \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 2  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 3 of 62\n \n1  residents of that neighborhood to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an \n2  inability to use and access their properties. \n3  3.  On June 8, 2020, the City of Seattle (โthe Cityโ) abruptly deserted the Seattle Police \n4  Departmentโs East Precinct on the corner of Twelfth Avenue and E. Pine Street in Seattleโs Capitol \n5  Hill neighborhood, leaving behind numerous barriers that had previously been used as a line \n6  between police and protesters. \n7  4.  When the City abandoned the precinct and the nearby barriers, a number of \n8  individuals who had been in the area took control of the barriers and used them to block off streets \n9  in an area around the East Precinct.  \n10  5.  In  the  days  and  weeks  after  the  City  abandoned  the  East  Precinct,  CHOP \n11  participants occupied the public streets, sidewalks, and parks in the area at all hours of the day and \n12  night. Rather than seeking to restore order and protect the residents and property owners within \n13  CHOP, the City instead chose to actively endorse, enable, and participate in the occupation of \n14  CHOP.  \n15  6.  The City provided Cal Anderson Park, a public park located at the center of CHOP,  \n16  to CHOP for use as the staging ground supporting CHOPโs occupation of the surrounding area. \n17  Supported by the City, countless CHOP participants resided in the park at all times of day and \n18  night, having turned it into a tent city. At any given time, hundreds of CHOP participants camped \n19  out in the park. Violence, vandalism, excessive noise, public drug use, and other crimes were \n20  rampant within the park.  \n21  7.  The Cityโs conduct resulted in CHOP being blocked off from public access. Among \n22  other conduct detailed below, the City provided the participants with concrete barriers to use to \n23  block the streets, which CHOP participants indeed used to barricade the streets and create borders. \n24  These borders, at times, were guarded by armed CHOP participants who oversaw who could or \n25  could not enter CHOP. As a result, the streets were barred to most all vehicular traffic, making it \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 3  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 4 of 62\n \n1  virtually impossible for residents and businesses to access their buildings, receive deliveries, and \n2  provide goods and services to the few customers willing to enter CHOP.  \n3  8.  The Cityโs conduct also resulted in the elimination of basic public safety within \n4  CHOP and nearby areas. For example, the City enacted a policy under which police would not \n5  enter the CHOP area except during life-and-death emergencies, and, even in those situations, the \n6  response was, at best, muted and late. After a fatal shooting in the early morning of June 20, 2020, \n7  for example, officers did not even approach the area of the shooting until approximately 20 minutes \n8  after the shooting, and no professional medical response was available for at least 15 minutes. At \n9  other times, even during life-and-death emergencies, the police acquiesced to demands from \n10  CHOP participants that they abandon the area. The City acknowledged the serious safety issues it \n11  created,  in  particular  noting  that  there  were  โdangerous  conditionsโ  at  night,  but  the  City \n12  nonetheless chose to maintain its policy of providing resources and support to the CHOP occupiers.  \n13  9.  The Cityโs conduct enabled the widespread destruction and vandalism of private \n14  property. Graffiti was and is pervasive throughout the areaโit is not only on barriers, streets, \n15  sidewalks, but also on nearly every private building within CHOP. Graffiti that was painted over \n16  almost immediately returned, and property owners were told by CHOP participants that if they \n17  dared to paint over graffiti, their buildings would be more severely vandalized or even burned to \n18  the ground. The City did nothing to prevent this conduct from June 8, 2020 to July 1, 2020, but, \n19  instead, actively endorsed and supported the ongoing occupation of the CHOP area and the \n20  destruction of property that accompanied it. As a result, property owners and their tenants were \n21  not able to fully use their properties. Property owners and tenants, for instance, had to lock and \n22  barricade their garages and loading areas at risk of having CHOP participants entering and \n23  vandalizing them. \n24  10.  The property owners, businesses, and residents in the area suffered ever-increasing \n25  property damage and economic loss every day that CHOP existed in their neighborhood, all \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 4  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 5 of 62\n \n1  because of the Cityโs active support, encouragement, and endorsement of the occupation. In \n2  particular, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan provided the CHOP participants with not just tangible \n3  resources but also a de facto stamp of approval. Her tweets, interviews, and other statements made \n4  it clear that the City was fully aware of what is happening, had no plan or timeline for remedying \n5  the ongoing harm, and in fact viewed the occupation of Capitol Hill as something akin to a \n6  perpetual block party, which the City wanted to support because of the viewpoints of CHOP \n7  participants. \n8  11.  Plaintiffs and others repeatedly pleaded with Mayor Durkan and others to cease \n9  enabling the destruction of their property and the imminent dangers posed to them and their \n10  neighborhood. But the City did not listen, or did not care, and it was only after Plaintiffs had to \n11  resort to litigation to make themselves heard that the City finally took action to disband CHOP \n12  12.  Again,  this  case  is  not  about  Plaintiffsโ  agreement  or  disagreement  with  the \n13  inspiration for CHOP, or the viewpoints expressed by the people occupying that area. Instead, it \n14  is about the Cityโs active, knowing endorsement and support of a destructive occupation of a \n15  neighborhood to the detriment of the well-being of those who live and work in that neighborhood. \n16  II.  PARTIES \n17  13.  Plaintiffs are residents, tenants, property owners, and small businesses in Seattleโs \n18  Capitol Hill neighborhood that have been harmed by CHOP.  \n19  14.

Defendant the City of Seattle (โthe Cityโ) is a municipality incorporated in the \n4  State of Washington. The Seattle Police Department (โSPDโ) is a division of the City. Jenny \n5  Durkan is the Mayor and chief executive of the City, and a policymaker for the City.  \n6  III.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7  32.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. ยง1331 \n8  because this action presents federal questions and seeks to redress deprivations of rights under \n9  the United States Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n10  33.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(1) because the events \n11  giving rise to these claims arose in the Western District of Washington. \n12  IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n13  A.  The Creation of CHOP \n14  34.  On June 8, 2020, with protests ongoing near the East Precinct, the City emptied the \n15  East Precinct of all weapons and valuables, and then abandoned it. \n16  35.  The City left behind at the precinct and in the surrounding areas large barriers that \n17  had been used in previous days to try to limit the movements of protesters. \n18  36.  Predictably, almost immediately after the SPD abandoned the precinct and the \n19  barriers, CHOP participants used the barriers to block off streets in the area and create a โno-copโ \n20  zone. Initially, the blocked-off area extended to all streets within one block from the precinct. \n21  37.  Without  any  police  presence,  the  CHOP  participants  organized  themselves, \n22  declared the area โFree Capitol Hill,โ and stationed guards by the barriers that the City had \n23  abandoned, thereby creating borders for the occupied area. The area later expanded, was referred \n24  to as CHAZ for several days, and eventually became known as CHOP. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 10  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 11 of 62\n \n1  38.  CHOPโs unofficial boundaries stretched north to East Denny Way, east to 13th \n2  Avenue, south to East Pike Street, and west to Broadway. It encompassed the entirety of Cal \n3  Anderson Park and sixteen city blocks in all. \n4  B.  The Activities of CHOP Participants \n5  39.  After the SPD vacated Capitol Hill, the CHOP participants claimed the area as their \n6  own with a physical presence and a loose form of governance and justice. \n7  40.  CHOP participants have maintained borders with barriers and people patrolling the \n8  perimeter, as well as vehicles parked in the middle of rights-of-way.  \n9  41.  Many CHOP participants lived on the streets and sidewalks and in Cal Anderson \n10  Park, in tents such as the following: \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18   \n19  42.  They painted graffiti on most available surfaces, and if a property owner painted \n20  over the graffiti, the graffiti was typically replaced within a few hours.

CHOP participants created various unpermitted, ad hoc food dispensaries and \n2  stores on public property in front of and near private residences and businesses. \n3  44.  CHOP participants created a โmedical tentโ at the Rancho Bravo restaurant under \n4  a festival tent. \n5  45.  On occasion, CHOP participants acted as a replacement police force, including by \n6  demanding that business owners release individuals who were caught committing crimes and by \n7  attempting to perform their own crime investigations. \n8  46.  CHOP participants occupied the streets and sidewalks 24 hours a day, and had \n9  speeches, debates, movies, music, and various other activitiesโincluding, in some instances, \n10  illegal fireworks showsโon the streets and sidewalks. Disturbances and noise pollution extended \n11  well past 10 p.m. and typically into the early morning of the next day.  \n12  47.  CHOP participants were observed carrying guns in the public streets and parks in \n13  broad daylight.  \n14  48.  Cal Anderson Park was one of the focal points of CHOP. The approximately 7-acre \n15  park, which was ostensibly owned by the City, was entirely handed over to the CHOP participants. \n16  The  City  supported  and  enabled  CHOPโs  occupation  of  the  park  through  providing \n17  washing/sanitation facilities, portable toilets, nighttime lighting, and other material support. \n18  49.  As a result of the Cityโs actions, Cal Anderson Park was transformed into a massive \n19  tent city for CHOP participants, as shown here:  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 13  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 14 of 62\n \n1  50.  Members of the public could not use Cal Anderson Park. CHOPโs control of the \n2  park continued unabated until July 1, 2020. Local residents attempting to take pictures too close \n3  to Cal Anderson Park were threatened by CHOP participants, who have said they would steal their \n4  smartphones. \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12   \n13  51.  CHOP participants even built makeshift gardens on the parkโs lawn to grow food \n14  for CHOP. The City handed over public property in the park for this use, as shown here: \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22  52.  CHOPโs control of Cal Anderson Park was a central nuisance to local residents and \n23  businesses. Many of the Plaintiffsโ properties overlook, border, or are adjacent to the park. Not \n24  only  were  those  residents  deprived  of  their  use  of  the  park,  but  problems  from  CHOPโs \n25  encampments in the park spilled over into the entire neighborhood. The hundreds of CHOP \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 14  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 15 of 62\n \n1  participants in the park created excessive noise, even late into the night, in violation of the Cityโs \n2  ordinances. Participants set off fireworks at all hours of the day and night. Trash, feces, and other \n3  refuse built up in the park, affecting the whole area. Worst of all, Cal Anderson Park was one of \n4  the most violent areas of CHOP. Local residents saw individuals in Cal Anderson Park carrying \n5  firearms. \n6  C.  The Effects of CHOP on Plaintiffs and the Class \n7  53.  The impacts on Plaintiffs and the Class were extensive. The experiences of each \n8  Plaintiff are described in detail below. However, all Plaintiffs and Class members have in common \n9  at least the following harms: a lack of public safety assistance and substantially impaired access to \n10  and  use  of  their  properties.  Lack  of  public-safety  assistance  even  in  life-threatening \n11  circumstances. \n12  54.  The Cityโs endorsement and recognition of CHOP went so far that the SPD adopted \n13  a policy and practice of not entering the area except in the case of life-threatening crimes, and even \n14  then, the SPD response was weak and delayed. \n15  55.  On information and belief, the SPD considered the area from Denny Way to Union \n16  Street and Thirteenth Avenue to Broadway to be a โno responseโ zone where the SPD would not \n17  respond to anything but the most serious crimes. \n18  56.  And even in the most serious situations, the SPDโs response was unconscionably \n19  delayed. As SPD Chief Carmen Best explained on June 11, 2020, as she stood next to Mayor \n20  Durkan: \n \n21 \nSPD has a responsibility to provide public safety services to the \nentire East precinct and the City. The actions of a small group cannot \n22 \nand should not deprive an entire segment of our community from \npublic-safety services. In the first day of the SPD not having access \n23 \nto the precinct, response times for crimes in progress were over \n24  fifteen minutes, about three times as long as the average โฆ. If that \nis your mother, or your sister, your cousin, your neighborโs kid that \n25  is being raped, robbed, assaulted, and otherwise victimized, youโre \nnot going to want to have to report that it took the police three times \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 15  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 16 of 62\n \nlonger to get there to provide services to them. The difference in the \n1 \namount of time could protect someoneโs life and prevent a violent \nattack. \n2 \n3  57.  Recent  events  in  CHOP  demonstrate  that  if  anything,  Chief  Best  was  being \n4  conservative in her description of the public-safety emergency in CHOP. \n5  58.  At approximately 2:20 a.m. on June 20, 2020, there were two people shot in CHOP. \n6  At least one of the shootings happened at or near the intersection of Tenth Avenue and Pine Street, \n7  around the corner from the abandoned East Precinct. One of the victims died before reaching the \n8  hospital. The second was admitted with life-threatening injuries. No suspects have been identified \n9  or taken into custody. \n10  59.  Raw video streamed from the area shortly after that shooting demonstrates the \n11  enormity of the risk created by the City for anyone who lives or works in CHOP. That video clearly \n12  captured the following:2 \n13  a.  The video appears to start a couple of minutes after the shooting. \n14  b.  One shooting victim was taken to the CHOP โmedic tentโ located in a \n15  parking lot under a festival tent. \n16  c.  No professional medics arrived until approximately 15 minutes into the \n17  video to tend to the first shooting victim. \n18  d.  No police were in the area until approximately 18 minutes into the video, \n19  when cars and lights and can be seen several blocks away, and police can be heard on \n20  megaphones demanding that barriers be moved to allow the police to enter. \n21  e.  Approximately 19 minutes into the video, a small phalanx of approximately \n22  8 police officers entered the area on foot and arrived in the area of the medical tent, \n23  apparently for the purpose of trying to locate and extract the first shooting victim. \n24 \n25 \n \n2 https://www.facebook.com/WWConverge/videos/297548387941384/?v=297548387941384 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 16  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 17 of 62\n \n1  f.   The  phalanx  of  officers  was  immediately  surrounded,  yelled  at,  and \n2  pursued by CHOP participants. \n3  g.  One police car finally entered the area approximately 20 minutes into the \n4  video. \n5  h.  The police did not engage with the crowd and promptly left the area, after \n6  which CHOP participants created a human chain across the street to bar any further \n7  entry. \n8  i.  There was a second shooting victim in CHOP located a couple of blocks \n9  away. It appears that no medics or police responded at all to the location of the second \n10  victim. \n11  j.  Approximately 35 minutes into the livestream video, the second victim was \n12  placed into a plain white cargo van and presumably taken to the hospital. A voice can \n13  be heard explaining that Medic One drove by but did not come to the assistance of the \n14  person who ended up in the white van. \n15  k.  Shortly after the second victim was driven away, private citizens began \n16  looking for bullet casings. No police were on the scene to perform any investigation in \n17  the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \n18  60.  On June 21, 2020, another shooting occurred in the area at approximately 11:00 at \n19  night. There was no police or medic response, and the shooting victim was transported to the \n20  emergency room by private vehicle. \n21  61.  In a press conference with Mayor Durkan on June 22, 2020, Chief Best reiterated \n22  the seriousness of the public-safety situation, stating: \n \n23 \nthere are countless individuals who are in the CHOP that are \nthere  to  engage,  as  the  Mayor  said  earlier,  in  peaceful \n24 \ndemonstrations. But there are also groups of individuals \nengaging in shootings, a rape, assaults, burglary, arson, and \n25 \nproperty destruction, and I have their police reports right \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 17  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 18 of 62\n \nhere. [*Holding up a stack of papers*] Iโm not making it up. \n1 \nThese things have happened. We cannot walk away from the \ntruth of what is happening there. This is not about politics \n2 \nand Iโm not a politician. This isnโt a debate about First \nAmendment rights. This is about life or death. So we need a \n3 \nplan. \n4 \n5  62.  In the early hours of June 29, yet another shooting occurred in the area.  This \n6  shooting, at 12th and Pike, left a 16-year-old dead and a 14-year-old in critical condition.   \n7  63.  According to reports, the shooting began when โCHOP securityโ opened fire on a \n8  white Jeep that had crashed into the CHOP barricades. Reports indicate that over a dozen shots \n9  were fired. \n10  64.  The City did not provide emergency medical services at the scene of the shooting \n11  in the CHOP area. Instead, one of the victims was transported by private vehicle out of the CHOP \n12  area and to a hospital. The other had to be taken โto a meeting point with Seattle Fire Department \n13  Personnel, who then transported the victim to Harborview Medical Center.โ \n14  65.  By the time the police reached the scene of the shooting at 12th and Pike to begin \n15  an investigation, much of the key evidence had already been tampered with or lost. As the SPD \n16  blotter put it, when police arrived on the scene to inspect the Jeep, โit was clear the crime scene \n17  had been disturbed.โ No suspects have been identified or placed into custody.   \n18  66.  That same night, and possibly in connection with the same incident, bullets were \n19  shot into the Onyx Condominium building, with at least one bullet coming within a foot of a \n20  resident asleep in bed.   \n21  67.  Over the course of nine days, there were two homicides in CHOP. There had been \n22  no homicides in Capitol Hill in 2020 before CHOP started, and in all of 2019, there were only \n23  three homicides in the entire Capitol Hill neighborhood.   \n24   \n25   \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 18  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 19 of 62\n \n1  2.  Impeded access to and use of property \n2  68.  All Plaintiffs and Class members did not have the ability to use public rights of \n3  way, including streets and sidewalks, to access their homes, businesses, and properties. \n4  69.  CHOP participants regularly moved the City-provided barriers and other large \n5  objects wherever they wished to block traffic, sidewalks, and all other manner of ingress and \n6  egress. \n7  70.  In many cases, this meant people could not use public streets and rights-of-way to \n8  enter or exit their homes or businesses, clients cannot visit businesses, and businesses could not \n9  get deliveries. The difficulties were magnified for the elderly and the disabled. \n10  71.  The barriers and the constant presence of CHOP participants also meant that \n11  residents, property owners, and businesses did not have full use of their property. If they could \n12  access their property, safety necessitated that many of them keep their doors locked. Many portions \n13  of property that were normally freely accessibleโsuch as garagesโhad to be shut at all hours or \n14  else CHOP participants would vandalize them. \n15  72.  Garbage and recycling services could not enter the area due to the myriad of \n16  barricades and CHOP border guards, forcing residents and businesses to pile up refuse without any \n17  idea when they might be able to discard it. \n18  73.  Residents and businesses in the area were unable to receive deliveries at their homes \n19  because delivery companies could not or would not enter CHOP and the surrounding area because \n20  of barriers and safety concerns. \n21  74.  Residents in and near CHOP were forced to endure loud noises, music, and even \n22  fireworks at all times of the day and night. \n23  75.  Residents in and near CHOP did not have free and safe access in or out of their \n24  homes. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 19  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 20 of 62\n \n1  76.  Businesses were unable to operate normally, or even open, because of blocked \n2  access and concerns for the safety of their suppliers, employees, and customers. \n3  77.  All of this is caused extensive economic and other harm to Plaintiffs and all other \n4  members of the Class. \n5  78.  As Chief Best stated during a joint press conference with Mayor Durkan on the \n6  afternoon of July 1, 2020: \n \n7 \nIf you have watched the news footage, you have seen how absolutely \ndevastating  the  damage  to  this  neighborhood  is.  I  can  tell  you \n8 \npersonally, after walking through the area, we walked the full perimeter, \nI was just stunned by the amount of graffiti, garbage, and property \n9 \ndestruction. As we walked around the neighborhood, many people were \n10  coming out of their apartments and homes and thanking the officers \nprofusely for being there and for helping to clean out the area. So, we \n11  donโt even know how much trauma people were experiencing because \nof what was happening in that area. \n12 \n13  3.   Plaintiffsโ individual stories \n14  79.  The impact of CHOP on residents, businesses, and property owners is best seen \n15  through the stories of Plaintiffs, who are suffering from the Cityโs policies every day. \n16  80.  Each Plaintiff and the Class has sufferedโand continues to suffer irreparable \n17  economic and non-economic injury as a direct result of CHOP participantsโ presence on Capitol \n18  Hill and its aftereffects. The Cityโs support for CHOP enabled, aided, and abetted the ongoing \n19  harm to each of the Plaintiffs and members of the Class.  \n20  81.  Although the City cleared CHOP on the morning of July 1, 2020, Plaintiffs and the \n21  Class have continued to suffer harm due to restrictions in the area resulting from the existence of \n22  CHOP, the continued public perception of the area as dangerous and unstable, and lost business \n23  that may never return. Plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to seek recovery for such ongoing \n24  harm. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 20  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 21 of 62\n \n1  82.  Plaintiff  Car  Tender.  Plaintiff  Car  Tenderโa  local  small  business  with  one \n2  locationโ has suffered a dramatic drop off in its auto-repair business since the establishment of \n3  CHOP. Since early June 2020, business revenues declined around 40% from the prior months of \n4  April and May 2020. This drop-in sales actually understates Car Tenderโs losses, however, as April \n5  and Mayโs revenues were already lower due to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In late May \n6  2020, Car Tenderโs revenues began an upswing coming out of the shutdown, which was suddenly \n7  interrupted by the sharp drop in customers caused by CHOP.  \n8  83.  Car Tenderโs loss of business revenue is a direct result of CHOP. Access to the \n9  shop has at times been substantially impeded due to barricaded streets. Further, customers told Car \n10  Tender that they would not bring their cars into the shop, out of fear of CHOPโs location just down \n11  the street from Car Tender. Customers even came to the shop only to immediately turn around and \n12  leave, because they were fearful to leave their cars at Car Tenderโs location. Because of the Cityโs \n13  enablement of CHOP, Car Tender is struggling to make ends meet. \n14  84.  Car  Tenderโs  premises  were  also  vandalized  by  CHOP  participants.  CHOP \n15  participants tore down the fence around Car Tenderโs car lot, permanently damaging the cement \n16  post such that an entire new fence will need to be constructed. They painted and vandalized with \n17  graffiti the side of Car Tenderโs building. Car Tender was fearful that if the company tried to cover \n18  up the graffiti, they would face reprisals from CHOP participants, as CHOP participants threatened \n19  to burn down other properties in the area when owners attempted to cover or clean up graffiti. \n20  85.  Car Tenderโs customers were understandably concerned for their safety, and with \n21  good reason. Indeed, Car Tenderโs shop was recently broken into by a man who assaulted the son \n22  of one of Car Tenderโs owners with a knife. The details of the incident demonstrate the extreme \n23  risk of harm to which the City has exposed Plaintiffs and the Class. \n24  86.  On June 14th at around 9:30 p.m., a person broke into Car Tenderโs building, armed \n25  himself with a knife and a spike that he found inside the building, and lit a fire in the shop. After \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 21  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 22 of 62\n \n1  receiving a call from a neighbor alerting them to the break-in, Car Tenderโs owner and son called \n2  9-1-1 and then went to the premises themselves, where they found the shopโs garage had been \n3  broken into. They found that the property had also been vandalized with Purell hand sanitizer, \n4  which the intruder had dumped everywhere to use as fuel for the fire he had started. That fire was \n5  still burning when the owner and his son arrived, but they were able to extinguish it. The intruder \n6  was still on the premises, however, and he accosted the ownerโs son with the knife and spike and \n7  abruptly assaulted him by hitting him in the chest. \n8  87.  Although blindsided by the intruderโs sudden unprovoked attack, the owner and his \n9  son were able to wrestle the intruder to the floor in a scuffle. The intruder meanwhile tried to cut \n10  the sonโs femoral artery and landed two large cuts to his clothing on the side of his leg. He also \n11  repeatedly attempted to stab the son with the spike. \n12  88.  After subduing the intruder, Car Tenderโs owner called 9-1-1 again, reporting the \n13  arson, burglary, and assault, requesting police assistance at the scene. Other neighbors also called \n14  9-1-1. But, despite the multiple 9-1-1 calls. the police never responded to the scene that evening. \n15  89.  Several CHOP participants on the street who witnessed the incident approached the \n16  shop and demanded the release of the apprehended intruder. Car Tenderโs owner at first insisted \n17  that he was waiting for the police to come to the scene. An angry mob of CHOP participants, \n18  perhaps as many as 500 although possibly more, gathered around Car Tenderโs fence and broke it \n19  down, insisting on the release of the intruder. Members of CHOP mob insisted that the police \n20  would never dare respond. Faced with a threat of mob violence, Car Tenderโs owner and son \n21  handed the intruder over to CHOP participants. \n22  90.  Because the police refused to protect Car Tenderโs property from burglary and \n23  arson, Car Tenderโs owner was forced to sleep at the shop in an effort to protect it.  Car Tenderโs \n24  owner tried to contact Mayor Durkanโs office to report his concerns as a resident and small \n25  business owner but received no response. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 22  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 23 of 62\n \n1  91.  Car Tenderโs experience was not unique. Other local businesses also suffered from \n2  the Cityโs actions. \n3  92.  Plaintiff  Richmark  Label.  Plaintiff  Richmark  Label  is  a  local  family-owned \n4  business on Capitol Hill that runs label-printing operations out of a manufacturing facility on Pine \n5  Street, directly adjacent to CHOP. Richmark Labelโs business has been negatively affected as a \n6  direct consequence of CHOP.  \n7  93.  CHOP frequently blocked access to the 11th Avenue side of Richmark Labelโs \n8  building, where Richmark Label maintains a loading dock for receiving deliveries and shipping. \n9  Richmark Label must receive deliveries on an ongoing basis in order to maintain its business as \n10  well as make shipment of its products. Richmark Labelโs ability to use its loading dock was \n11  substantially impeded, as the 11th Avenue access was frequently blocked by barricades, or because \n12  CHOP participants engaged in intimidation tactics, or because of other CHOP activities. Some \n13  delivery drivers reported to Richmark Label that they would not even attempt delivery to their \n14  building, because it is unsafe. Several delivery drivers who attempted delivery were stopped and \n15  accosted by CHOP participants. Richmark Labelโs usual shippers refused to deliver and UPS \n16  recently elected not to come and pick up a pallet of wine labels for shipment, one of Richmark \n17  Labelโs largest sources of business. On other occasions, labels shipped late, incurring costs and \n18  straining Richmark Labelโs business relationships with its customers. \n19  94.   The Cityโs support of CHOP put Richmark Labelโs business at risk, as well as the \n20  livelihood of its over 70 employees. \n21  95.  This loss to business is not the only harm Richmark Label is suffering due to CHOP. \n22  Richmark Label owns its facilities, a historic building from 1927, on which the company paid to \n23  have an artistic mural painted as a gift to the whole Capitol Hill community. That mural was \n24  vandalized by CHOP participants beyond repair, whereas before CHOPโs occupation there had \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 23  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 24 of 62\n \n1  only been minor instances of occasional graffiti. Now the wall will have to be repaired and \n2  repainted.  \n3  96.  Richmark Label also owns a parking lot on the 11th Avenue side of the building. It \n4  rents the parking spaces during non-business hours. Richmark Label was forced by CHOP to shut \n5  the parking lot down because the roads for accessing the parking lot were blocked and customers \n6  are and were afraid of entering the area. The company is receiving none of the usual rental income \n7  it typically receives from the parking spaces. The parking lot also typically serves as customer \n8  parking for Richmark Label and several of its tenants who rent space in the companyโs building. \n9  But, due to CHOP and its aftereffects, both Richmark Label and its tenants are being deprived of \n10  customer parking. \n11  97.  Unauthorized cars also parked in Richmark Labelโs lot. Richmark Label contacted \n12  towing companies, but all refused to tow the cars because CHOP made the area unsafe. Richmark \n13  Label called the police on multiple occasions regarding the unauthorized cars parked on their \n14  property, but the police would not act. Richmark Label called 9-1-1 regarding the unauthorized \n15  cars trespassing on their property, only to be told at least twice that SPD was not responding to \n16  calls in the area.  \n17  98.  Like Plaintiff Car Tender, Richmark Label was threatened with violence by CHOP \n18  participants. When CHOP first arose, Richmark Label allowed a local news crew to access its roof \n19  to film the protests and CHOP. SPD officers then also accessed Richmark Labelโs roof to assess \n20  the situation, where they were photographed by CHOP participants. Those photographs were then \n21  posted online, leading to a social media frenzy against the company. Subsequently, Richmark \n22  Labelโs employees reported that they did not feel safe coming to work, because of the threat of \n23  harassment and violence from CHOP participants. CHOP participants set up cones across 11th \n24  Avenue, which must be crossed to access Richmark Labelโs building. CHOP participants stopped \n25  people and required them to answer questions about who they are and what they were doing in the \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 24  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 25 of 62\n \n1  area before letting them pass. The result is that customers, shippers, and employees were scared to \n2  even enter the area.  \n3  99.  Richmark Label was in contact with the Mayorโs office, but the office did not return \n4  the companyโs calls, offer any assistance, or provide any opportunity to challenge the Cityโs \n5  decision to authorize the ongoing occupation of the CHOP area. The Cityโs support of CHOP \n6  through  encouragement  and  material  support  enabled  CHOPโs  threat  to  Richmark  Labelโs \n7  business.  \n8  100.  Plaintiff Northwest Liquor and Wine. Northwest Liquor and Wineโa one-location \n9  store specializing in high-end wine, beer, and spiritsโis yet another local small business that \n10  suffered as a result of the CHOP occupation. After record sales in May 2020, the store had its \n11  worst month in June 2020 since opening at that location in 2012. In June 2020, the companyโs \n12  sales were down approximately 70% from average.  \n13  101.  Customers are unable to visit the store because the surrounding streets have been \n14  blocked off to traffic. Northwest Liquor and Wine has access to an adjacent parking garage, but \n15  they have been forced to close it to prevent CHOP participants from camping out in it and even \n16  starting fires. CHOP barricades also meant that suppliers were unable to make deliveries.  \n17  102.  The owners and employees did not feel safe, as there were disturbances in the store \n18  and people on the streets nearby carrying guns. Northwest Liquor and Wine normally maintains \n19  around 4 to 6 employees. Due to CHOP, its employees were understandably too scared to come to \n20  work out of concern for their safety.  \n21  103.  Plaintiff Magdalena Sky (Tattoos and Fortune). Plaintiff Magdalena Sky is an \n22  activist and supporter of Black Lives Matter. Ms. Sky is the sole proprietor of Tattoos and Fortune. \n23  Ms. Sky is autistic and has worked tirelessly for years using her unique artistic skills to support \n24  and grow her business. Her business is her own safety net and primary source of income. CHOP \n25  ripped that business out from under her feet. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 25  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 26 of 62\n \n1  104.  Like many other local businesses, Tattoos and Fortune is sinking because of the \n2  Cityโs support of CHOP. Ms. Skyโs tattoo and fortune telling services depend on regular client \n3  access to its Capitol Hill studio. Tattoo and Fortuneโs studio is within CHOP, which made client \n4  access impossible. The barricades and encampments blocked both vehicle and foot access to the \n5  studio, as well as delivery of vital business supplies, just as they blocked the roads, parking, \n6  doorways, and driveways of many local businesses. As a result, Ms. Sky was forced to close \n7  Tattoos and Fortuneโs doors. Without clients, Tattoos and Fortune cannot generate any revenue. \n8  In addition, Tattoos and Fortune suffered from the lack of trash service, access for emergency \n9  services, and police protection. Even if Ms. Skyโs clients had access to the studio, many were \n10  fearful to come because of CHOP. To reach her business, her clients would have had to cross \n11  barricades that CHOP participants set up, where they might be stopped, questioned, and/or \n12  harassed by CHOP participants, as others were. \n13  105.  Ms. Sky herself witnessed theft and looting from other local businesses and feared \n14  CHOP participants might steal and loot from her business, should she even try to open her studioโs \n15  doors. On one occasion, Ms. Sky was followed and harassed, like so many others have been due \n16  to the rise in harassment and sexual assault in the area since CHOP began. The fear of violence \n17  caused Ms. Sky stress, exacerbated by her autism. The City ignored her concerns, as with the \n18  mental health of many local residents and business owners. Her businessโher primary means of \n19  livelihoodโis losing all its revenue. Some of her clients may never return, as they canceled \n20  appointments and began seeking tattoo and fortune services elsewhere.  \n21  106.  Capitol Hill is a diverse neighborhood, known for its minority presence and as a \n22  center for Seattleโ LGBTQ residents. Many small business owners in the area are minority-owned \n23  and suffering loss of property and business from CHOP, just as Tattoos and Fortune is. The City \n24  and CHOP did not respond to concerns of small businesses like Ms. Skyโs Tattoos and Fortune. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 26  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 27 of 62\n \n1  Ms. Sky, along with other local business owners, had no forum in which to voice her concerns and \n2  try to stem her businesses losses accruing each day CHOP and its aftereffects continue.  \n3  107.  Plaintiff Bergmanโs Lock and Key. Plaintiff Bergmanโs Lock and Key is a small \n4  business that has operated on Capitol Hill since 1956.  \n5  108.  Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs employees were not safe to come to work due to CHOP. \n6  Several on their way to or from work were followed by CHOP participants wielding baseball bats, \n7  who threatened them not to come into the area. To protect its property from CHOP participants, \n8  Bergmanโs Lock and Key was forced to board up its premises. Its building was tagged with graffiti \n9  and vandalized. Because CHOP became more dangerous as the days progressed, the company \n10  closed around 3:00 p.m., two and half hours before its normal 5:30 p.m. closing time.  \n11  109.  Bergmanโs Lock and Key is suffering financially. Its customers cannot access the \n12  store due to roadblocks, barricades, and lack of parking caused by the Cityโs support of CHOP. \n13  Other customers are simply too scared to come, because of Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs proximity \n14  to the CHOP zone. Customers called citing their fears and the company was forced to refer them \n15  to competitor businesses outside of the CHOP area. Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs revenues declined \n16  in June 2020 by 60% due to CHOP. Bergmanโs Lock and Key was able to continue working as an \n17  essential business during the COVID-19 shutdown, but CHOP stopped nearly all customers from \n18  coming in. Business deliveries and shipments were also routinely delayed. \n19  110.  The City actively supported CHOP participants near Bergmanโs Lock and Key. The \n20  City provided cleaning stations for CHOP participants, large stainless-steel sinks, and portable \n21  toilets. \n22  111.    Bergmanโs Lock and Key tried to complain to the City, but received no response.  \n23  112.  Plaintiff Matthew Ploszaj. Plaintiff Matthew Polszaj has lived for approximately 8 \n24  years in an apartment he leases at 1210 E. Pine Street. His residence was within CHOP, next to \n25  the Seattle Police Departmentโs East Precinct. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 27  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 28 of 62\n \n1  113.  During the existence of CHOP, there were several times that Mr. Ploszaj was unable \n2  to access his apartment because of obstructions created by CHOP and CHOP participants. Those \n3  obstructions  included  people,  physical  barriers,  camping  tents,  festival  tents,  makeshift \n4  โstorefronts,โ and other structures on the streets and sidewalks around his apartment building. \n5  114.  Because of these obstructions and because he feared for his safety, Mr. Ploszaj was \n6  forced on several occasions during the existence of CHOP to leave the area and stay elsewhere in \n7  Seattle. \n8  115.  Mr. Ploszajโs apartment building was broken into four times during the existence \n9  of CHOP, even though it had never been broken into at any other time during his previous 8 years \n10  at that address.  The Seattle police were contacted each time the apartment was broken into, but \n11  the police did not respond on any of those occasions.  \n12  116.  On the evening of June 29, 2020, an apartment in Mr. Ploszajโs building was \n13  burglarized.  Mr. Ploszaj and his neighbor contacted the police after the burglary, at approximately \n14  10:30 p.m.  Police told them that they would not respond to the building because of its location \n15  within CHOP and requested that Mr. Ploszaj and his neighbor meet them at 20th and Madison \n16  (more than 8 blocks away) to make a report. One of the residents reported to that location. After \n17  an hour had passed since their initial phone call, no police had responded, and Mr. Ploszaj and his \n18  neighbor called police again.  They were able to make a report on the phone during this second \n19  phone call, but no officers responded to investigate. \n20  117.  On June 25, 2020, a CHOP participant climbed atop Mr. Ploszajโs building and \n21  threatened to kill himself. Mr. Ploszaj called 9-1-1 numerous times to seek assistance. He was \n22  asked whether he wanted to meet an officer somewhere outside CHOP because police would not \n23  respond to his address.  Mr. Ploszaj declined and continued to call 9-1-1 several times during the \n24  90 minutes that the individual was threatening suicide. The 9-1-1 operators thanked him for the \n25  updates but police never responded to assist. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 28  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 29 of 62\n \n1  118.  Plaintiff Argento LLC.  Plaintiff Argento owns and operates Cafรฉ Argento.  Argento \n2  suffered lost income and business because of CHOP. During the existence of CHOP, the presence \n3  of numerous CHOP participants wielding guns forced Argento to open later and close earlier \n4  because of concerns for the safety of Argento employees and customers. \n5  119.  Argento customers were also unable to access the cafรฉ, or were reluctant to come \n6  to the cafรฉ, during the existence of CHOP, because of the numerous blockades and other obstacles \n7  on the public streets and sidewalks outside the cafรฉ. Customers and employees were also harassed \n8  on public streets and sidewalks by CHOP participants, and employees were often too afraid to \n9  come to work. \n10  120.  Access to the cafรฉ for the disabled was especially difficult because of the numerous \n11  blockades and other obstacles placed and created by CHOP participants. Argentoโs owner, Faizel \n12  Khan, contacted the Seattle Department of Transportation about the inaccessibility for disabled \n13  persons, but the Department of Transportation did nothing to help improve the access. \n14  121.  CHOP participants frequently came into the cafรฉ in order to pressure Mr. Kahn and \n15  his employees to support the political views of CHOP and CHOP participants. \n16  122.  CHOP participants regularly demanded to use the cafรฉ restrooms and often refused \n17  to leave, and on occasion left behind used needles in the bathroom. \n18  123.  Mr.  Kahn  called  9-1-1  four  times  regarding  incidents  at  the  cafรฉ  during  the \n19  existence of CHOP, but he was told that police would not respond to his area unless there was a \n20  violent incident. \n21  124.  CHOP participants regularly deposited human waste and other waste on and in the \n22  streets, sidewalks, buses, patios, doorways, and other areas around Cafรฉ Argento. \n23  125.  During the existence of CHOP, Argento was unable to use City services for trash \n24  and recycling, and could not receive package deliveries from UPS, Federal Express, or Amazon. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 29  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 30 of 62\n \n1  126.  Plaintiff Onyx HOA. Plaintiff Onyx HOA is an association of Capitol Hill residents \n2  and condo owners in the Onyx Condominium building. The HOA and its residents suffered harm \n3  from CHOP. The Onyx Condominiumโs residents felt unsafe and were constantly barraged by \n4  excessive noise, fireworks, and other nuisances. The building was subject to graffiti and other acts \n5  of vandalism at the hands of CHOP participants. The HOA and its residents called 9-1-1 but \n6  received no response or direction from the City. The HOAโs insurer threatened to raise rates and \n7  premiums if CHOP was not disbanded. Tenants made plans to leave, threatening the funding of \n8  the HOA. All tenants have lost value in terms of property values as a direct result of the Cityโs \n9  support of CHOP. \n10  127.  The  Onyx  Condominiums  are  on  the  border  of  CHOP.  As  a  result,  Onyx \n11  Condominium residentsโ access to their own homes was impeded, due to barricades on the public \n12  streets. For example, the president of Onyx HOA, individual Plaintiff Wade Biller, was stopped \n13  by CHOP participants at the barricades and told he was not allowed to drive through. He was \n14  stopped by a CHOP participant while trying to drive down 12th Avenue to access his home. At \n15  other times, so-called โsecurityโ for CHOP came to the barricades and offered to escort him into \n16  the area to access his home so that CHOP participants would not vandalize his car.    \n17  128.  CHOP participants stole an expensive compact dumpster bin belonging to Onyx \n18  HOA. Onyx HOAโs president, Mr. Biller, demanded the bin back, but CHOP participants refused \n19  to return it. During negotiations for return of the bin, Mr. Biller was assaulted by a CHOP \n20  participant who violently kicked him in the back as he tried to leave the scene. The HOA president \n21  called the police, but the police did not respond to the incident of battery and assault for more than \n22  90 minutes, by which point the perpetrator was long gone. Eventually, when CHOP participants \n23  had access to City-owned barricades to encircle CHOP, the compactor bin was returned.    \n24  129.  Onyx HOA was forced to hire additional security to protect the property and its \n25  residents from the CHOP participants. At any time, two to four armed guards had to be present, as \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 30  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 31 of 62\n \n1  some CHOP participants in the area were violent and armed with guns. The HOAโs residents lived \n2  under constant fear and threat to their wellbeing and property.  \n3  130.  Mr. Biller, in his capacity as Onyx HOAโs president, wrote to Mayor Durkan on \n4  June 11, 2020, about the plight of the buildingโs residents. He wrote: โWe are fending for ourselves \n5  as residents and businesses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. We have had to hire private security \n6  to help keep tabs on the escalating issues . . . . I ask that you take a strong stance and allow the \n7  police to reclaim our streets for the residents who live here and donโt [want] to become part of this \n8  anti-police and anti-government movement.โ  Mayor Durkan did not respond or provide any \n9  opportunity to challenge the Cityโs policies supporting the occupation of the CHOP area.   \n10  131.  In the early morning hours of June 29, bullets were shot into the Onyx building, \n11  with at least one coming within a foot of a resident asleep in bed.   \n12  132.  Madrona Real Estate Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs Madrona Real Estate Services, Madrona \n13  Real Estate Investors IV, Madrona Real Estate Investors VI, and 12th and Pike Associates LLC \n14  (collectively โMadrona Real Estateโ) suffered economic loss from CHOP, including in the form \n15  of reduced rents, property damage, and a decline in property values. Their tenantsโCapitol Hillโs \n16  local residents and businessesโwere also harmed and harassed.  \n17  133.  Madrona Real Estate owns and/or manages multiple residential and commercial \n18  buildings on Capitol Hill in and around CHOP. The presence of CHOP greatly reduced the value \n19  or property in what was, until recently, one of the most popular and expensive neighborhoods in \n20  Seattle.   \n21  134.  A resident in a building managed by Madrona Real Estate recently called 9-1-1 to \n22  respond to an incident of violence near Madrona Real Estateโs building at 1414 12th Avenue. The \n23  resident had witnessed from her condoโs patio a fight in the street occurring at or near the \n24  intersection of 12th Avenue and Union. The resident saw what appeared to be a man and a woman \n25  fighting over a child, causing the woman to run into a nearby building and barricading the door to \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 31  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 32 of 62\n \n1  block the assaulting man. The resident called 9-1-1, who took her name and number. She waited \n2  for hours, but police never responded to the incident or called her back. This is just one example \n3  of the lawlessness the City enabled in the area. The same resident normally walked her dog in the \n4  neighborhood, but was hesitant to leave her residence. She witnessed CHOP participants openly \n5  doing hard drugs on the street around her building with impunity due to the lack of any SPD \n6  presence.   \n7  135.  The same building at 1414 12th Avenue managed and owned by Madrona Real \n8  Estate was broken into.  It was vandalized in various ways, including by pulling out pipes.  In one \n9  instance, the fire alarm was activated, which set off the sprinkler system (causing evacuation of \n10  the buildingโs over 100 residents and causing flooding in the building garage). Residents also \n11  reported that boxes and other items were stolen. During the CHOP occupation, an individual \n12  trespassed on the property and defecated in buildingโs lobby.  \n13  136.  At other locations in the area, Madrona Real Estateโs residents reported that their \n14  condos were broken into or burglarized by CHOP participants. CHOP participants harassed \n15  residents, vandalized the Madrona Real Estateโs property, and left human feces on multiple \n16  premises.  \n17  137.  SPD refused to help Madrona Real Estate protect private property or otherwise to \n18  help address these problems. At considerable expense, Madrona Real had to hire increased private \n19  security to protect its residents and property. At the building where the fire system was vandalized, \n20  Madrona Real Estate incurred considerable expense in fixing the damage to property and had to \n21  pay for a fire watch to be instituted.  \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 32  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 33 of 62\n \n1  138.  On the morning of June 23, 2020, one of Madrona Real Estateโs commercial \n2  tenants, a restaurant located at 12th Avenue and Pike Street, near but not directly in the CHOP \n3  blockaded area, was attempting to access its location in an effort to try to reopen. However, the \n4  entrances and stoop area in front of the restaurant were entirely blocked by an encampment erected \n5  by a CHOP participant. The tenant called the police, asking for assistance in removing trespassers \n6  from its private property, so that it could access and open the property. The police said that they \n7  would not respond because they โare not allowed to come within two blocks of CHOPโ.   \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n139.  Clearly, the Cityโs refusal to even respond to assaults in the neighborhood, let alone \n21 \ntake any measures to ensure public order and access, detracted from the areaโs desirability for \n22 \ncurrent and potential residents and businesses. At a new property Madrona Real Estate has opened \n23 \nin the area with 45 residential units, only 3 have been leased. Up until the emergence of CHOP the \n24 \narea was among the trendiest location for residents, but, since the emergence of CHOP, Madrona \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 33  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 34 of 62\n \n1  Real Estate has suddenly had no interest in the 42 unleased units, because no one is interested in \n2  moving to the area.  \n3  140.  Madrona Real Estateโs residents and tenants face other hardships as well. Many of \n4  the areaโs millennial residents regularly shop online, but, according to Madrona Real Estateโs \n5  residents and tenants, Amazon would not deliver packages in area, due the barricaded streets and \n6  presence of CHOP participants. The inability to purchase or ship through Amazon is even more \n7  acutely felt in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people rely on deliveries to safely \n8  deliver food, medicine, and other essential items.   \n9  141.  Most of Madrona Real Estateโs commercial tenants wanted to open but were unable \n10  to do so, because they were fearful of CHOP, had no way of attracting customers, and/or could not \n11  be accessed due to blocked streets. Unable to generate revenue, many of these tenants asked \n12  Madrona Real Estate for rent relief. Many are small, locally owned stores. Madrona Real Estate \n13  has been giving concessions in the form of free rent, resulting in economic loss, but even so many \n14  of the small commercial tenants are still facing bankruptcy.  \n15  142.  The  Cityโs  policies  with  respect  to  CHOP  have  resulted  in  other  sources  of \n16  economic loss to Madrona Real Estate. For example, Madrona Real Estate operates a parking \n17  garage near CHOP. But, since the occupation of the CHOP area started, nearly no one is coming \n18  to the area to shop or dine. Parking revenue in June 2020 was only a small fraction of the average.   \n19  143.  Madrona Real Estate complained to the City and even sent a letter to Mayor \n20  Durkan. Mayor Durkan did not respond or acknowledge the plight of the many residents of \n21  Madrona Real Estate services, let alone provide any recourse to challenge the Cityโs policies and \n22  conduct.    \n23  144.  Plaintiff Hunters Capital. Plaintiff Hunters Capital is a real-estate company that \n24  owns or manages multiple residential, commercial, and mixed-use buildings on Capitol Hill in and \n25  around CHOP. Like Madrona Real Estate, the presence of CHOP is causing economic injury to \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 34  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 35 of 62\n \n1  Hunters Capital, including loss of revenue, damage to property, and decline in property value. \n2  Hunters Capital has recently had investors back out of Capitol Hill development projects, citing \n3  CHOP as the reason to withdraw. Every day the City supported the ongoing occupation of CHOP, \n4  Hunters Capital incurred further irreparable harm.  \n5  145.  Hunters  Capital  property  and  employees  were  also  threatened  by  CHOP \n6  participants. For example, a Hunters Capital maintenance employee was recently attempting to \n7  clean up CHOP graffiti at a Hunters Capital building located near 10th Avenue and Pike Street at \n8  around 7:00 am in the morning. As he started to paint over the graffiti, the worker was accosted \n9  by a group of CHOP participants. The participants ordered him to stop removing the graffiti and \n10  threatened to burn the building down if he did not comply. Because of the threats, the maintenance \n11  worker left without painting over the graffiti, emotionally distraught due to the threats of violence \n12  and arson.   \n13  146.  Hunters  Capitalโs  residential  tenants  found  that  the  area  around  CHOP  was \n14  unlivable. For example, they reported numerous noise and safety concerns. Although the City has \n15  a noise ordinance, it was not enforced in and around CHOP. CHOP participants violated the \n16  ordinance late into every night, even setting off fireworks into the early hours of the morning. \n17  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants simply could not sleep and were deprived of their right to \n18  quiet enjoyment of their homes. Hunters Capital wrote to the City repeatedly, but the City did not \n19  respond to the concerns or provide any recourse or ability to challenge the Cityโs policies or \n20  conduct with respect to CHOP.  \n21  147.  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants also reported concern for their physical safety. \n22  Many who used the local Cal Anderson Park for recreation or to walk their pets could not do so \n23  because of safety concerns and rampant public drug use. Incidents of assault and harassment \n24  occurred in the area. Hunters Capitalโs residents recently witnessed a peaceful individual forcefully \n25  removed from the area by CHOP mobs. Female renters in particular had reported concerns about \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 35  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 36 of 62\n \n1  their personal safety, in light of numerous reported instances of sexual assault within CHOP. Some \n2  residential tenants have threatened to break their leases at properties owned by Hunters Capital \n3  because of the extensive problems created by CHOP. \n4  148.  Hunters Capitalโs commercial tenants are also suffering. Many reported that they \n5  could not open, because they feared doing so would expose them to looting and arson. Many \n6  tenants witnessed assault, theft, and looting. These commercial tenants were forced by CHOP to \n7  close and board up their stores in order to protect them. Some commercial tenants physically could \n8  not open under any circumstances, as CHOP participants blocked store entrances, including by \n9  setting up residential areas for CHOP participants on public streets and sidewalks with tents. \n10  Hunters Capitalโs commercial tenants are struggling. Many are small businesses and storefronts \n11  that depend on visitors coming to Capitol Hill. Many currently cannot pay their rent as a direct \n12  consequence of CHOP and its aftereffects.  \n13  149.  Other Hunters Capital commercial tenants with office space in the area reported \n14  that they are and were unable to come to work at their office space, because of blocked access and \n15  fear of CHOP participants. Additionally, the commercial office tenants reported that the noise \n16  issues were so serious that they and their employees were unable to use their office space for work. \n17  Loud speeches and chanting at all hours of the day made normal working conditions impossible. \n18  The  vast  majority  of  Hunters  Capital  commercial-office  tenants  report  that  they  and  their \n19  employees were simply unable to come to work at all.  \n20  150.  Hunters Capitalโs tenants have already begun to leave because of CHOP, and others \n21  cannot  pay  rent.  Every  day  that  passes  more  of  the  companyโs  tenants  leave  the  area,  at \n22  considerable loss to Hunters Capital. Further, there has been no interest from prospective tenants. \n23  As long as CHOP and its aftereffects remain, nearly no one is interested in relocating to the Capitol \n24  Hill neighborhood. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 36  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 37 of 62\n \n1  151.  Plaintiff Olive ST Apartments. Olive ST Apartments is another small business on \n2  Capitol Hill that struggled because of CHOP. Olive ST Apartments owns two apartment buildings \n3  close  to  Cal  Anderson  Park.  Previously  a  desirable  location  for  renters,  life  for  Olive  ST \n4  Apartmentsโ tenants became unlivable. The tenants were terrified by CHOP participants carrying \n5  guns, in addition to the rampant violence, harassment, and vandalism within CHOP. Olive ST \n6  Apartmentsโ owner was videotaped and harassed while trying to move a garbage dumpster several \n7  blocks outside of CHOP just so the garbage could get picked up.  \n8  152.  Due to safety concerns, Olive ST Apartments was forced to hire private security. \n9  Nevertheless, Olive ST Apartmentsโ buildings were covered with graffiti multiple times. The \n10  company tried cleaning the graffiti off, only for its buildings to be vandalized again. On several \n11  occasions, CHOP participants attempted to break into its buildings, once breaking the lock box for \n12  mail. Olive ST Apartments called the police, but the police told Olive ST Apartmentsโ security \n13  guard that they would not send anyone to the area.  \n14  153.  The noise, including from Cal Anderson Park, also made conditions for Olive ST \n15  Apartmentsโ tenants unlivable. The company received constant complaints about the noise at all \n16  times of day and night, including gun shots. Tenants left to avoid the noise.   \n17  154.  In addition to ceding the nearby Cal Anderson Park to CHOP, the City supported \n18  the CHOP participants near Olive ST Apartments by providing them with barricades, lights, toilets, \n19  handwashing stations, and fire extinguishers. The City allowed CHOP participants to use bright \n20  lights at Cal Anderson Park to facilitate CHOP activities there, causing a nuisance to Olive ST \n21  Apartmentsโ tenants.  \n22  155.  Given the unlivable conditions, it was impossible for the company to rent its \n23  apartments. Tenants moved out because of the nearby presence of CHOP. No new renters have \n24  interest in moving to the area.

Plaintiff  Redside  Partners.  Plaintiff  Redside  Partners  performs  real-estate \n2  management services to buildings near CHOP. Its business has also been hurt by CHOP and its \n3  aftereffects. Redside Partners employees reported that they do not feel safe coming to work, as the \n4  companyโs offices are near Cal Anderson Park. The companyโs employees report widespread \n5  lawlessness, including vandalism, graffiti, and public drug use affecting the buildings the company \n6  manages. CHOP participants trespassed on Redside Partnersโs properties, including climbing up \n7  fire escapes to get on building roof tops. Redside Partners complained to the City but received no \n8  response.  \n9  157.  Capitol Hillโs real-estate companies like Plaintiffs Madrona Real Estate, Hunters \n10  Capital, and Redside Partners have invested millions of dollars over the years to turn Capitol Hill \n11  into a desirable location, with modern condos, restaurants, and shops. They have made investments \n12  in new, state-of-the-art buildings and the restoration of many historic buildings. Over the last \n13  several decades, they have helped transform Capitol Hill into one of the nationโs most vibrant and \n14  architecturally attractive neighborhoods, a diverse melting pot for both local residents as well as \n15  tourists, with the Cityโs best boutique shopping, dining, socializing, and urban living. It has \n16  fostered a livable community for many new residents and a superstructure for many thriving small \n17  businesses, which employ thousands of employees from a diverse set of backgrounds. The \n18  immense value and wealth this has created, for Plaintiffs, the Capitol Hill community, and Seattle \n19  more generally is actively being destroyed by the Cityโs actions. \n20  158.  Plaintiff Rancho Bravo. Rancho Bravo is a restaurant well-known for providing \n21  quality Mexican food at affordable prices. Its location on Capitol Hill is on 11th and Pine Street, in \n22  the center of what became CHOP. In the days following the SPDโs abandonment of the East \n23  Precinct, Rancho Bravoโs owner and others met with city officials, including the Fire Chief, and \n24  urged them to remove the barricades that had been left behind. They pointed out that, without the \n25  barricades, the CHOP participants could continue their protest activities but would not obstruct \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 38  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 39 of 62\n \n1  streets or hamper businesses. The next day, the City not only failed to remove the existing \n2  barricades which had been used by police during the protests, but the City also provided additional \n3  concrete barriers to CHOP participants to set up their โautonomous zoneโ to keep police and others \n4  out. \n5  159.  Also, after the Cityโs decision to abandon the East Precinct, CHOP participants, \n6  without asking Rancho Bravo, set up a makeshift medical center in the outside seating areas in \n7  front of the restaurant. This โmedic stationโ was in operation for weeks and obstructed customer \n8  access to seating.   \n9  160.  At one point during the occupancy, CHOP participants set up a vehicle and trailer \n10  blocking the northeast access point to the Rancho Bravo parking lot. The participants involved in \n11  placing these obstructions set up a food stand on the street near Rancho Bravo serving tacos, \n12  burritos, fruit, and other concessions. Rancho Bravoโs owner met with the owners of this food \n13  stand and asked if they had a permit. He was told that they had no permit but that the CHOP leaders \n14  had approved their activities. \n15  161.  During  the  CHOP  occupancy,  Rancho  Bravo  stayed  open,  believing  that  its \n16  property would be in greater danger had it abandoned the restaurant. Having seen the damage to \n17  other buildings in the area, Rancho Bravo was concerned that CHOP participants would vandalize \n18  or perhaps even burn down the Rancho Bravo building if it were abandoned. As it was, CHOP \n19  participants left extensive graffiti on and around the restaurant building.  Rancho Bravoโs business \n20  dropped precipitously during the occupancy, leading to significant economic losses.   \n21  162.  Plaintiff Sway and Cake. Sway and Cake is a clothing store located on 12th Street \n22  and Pike Street. Its storefront looked out on barricades placed by CHOP participants at the entrance \n23  to CHOP at that intersection. Sway and Cake had been closed due to the public health crisis and \n24  was preparing to re-open at the time the protests began. However, once SPD abandoned the East \n25  Precinct, and the City discontinued providing police and emergency services to the area, Sway and \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 39  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 40 of 62\n \n1  Cake had to board up its storefront and remain closed despite State orders permitting re-opening. \n2  The store feared the possibility of vandalism, arson, or other crimes. Also, the environment in the \n3  CHOP, according to the storeโs owner, was not conducive to her clientele; rather, it was completely \n4  lawless and dangerous. Sway and Cakeโs owner visited the store while CHOP was being occupied \n5  and, when approaching the barricades, would be asked by those guarding the barriers why she was \n6  entering the area.   \n7  163.  Plaintiff Shuffle LLC/Cure Cocktail. Cure Cocktail is a restaurant and bar with \n8  windows and a patio overlooking Cal Anderson Park from its location on Nagle Place.  Cure \n9  Cocktailโs business suffered dramatically once the CHOP occupation began. Access to Nagle Place \n10  was blocked by barricades, and the patio, rather than looking over the normally pleasant Cal \n11  Anderson Park, now provided a view of, among other things, armed CHOP participants and a tent \n12  city. Because of the notoriety of CHOP and the barricades, deliveries of inventory to Cure Cocktail \n13  were cancelled. Without police presence, the area was dangerous, and escalated in danger as crime, \n14  including shootings, became common. Potential customers no longer wanted to be near the \n15  restaurant or the area.  A once vibrant business, even during the health crisis through online orders, \n16  Cure Cocktailโs revenues declined dramatically. When interacting with Cure Cocktail personnel, \n17  CHOP participants would ask questions such as, โAre you for the CHOP or are you for the police?โ  \n18  Even though Cure Cocktail supports Black Lives Matter and other causes, it became fearful in its \n19  communications with the protestors over what might happen if they offended CHOP participants.  \n20  In some communications, they were threatened with โexposureโ over Instagram or other social \n21  media sites if they did not express support for specific causes.       \n22  D.  The City Actively Supported and Encouraged CHOP and CHOP Participants. \n23  164.  In the face of all this destruction, City leaders, including Mayor Durkan, embraced \n24  the existence, message, and methods of CHOP and CHOP Participants. They did this with physical \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 40  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 41 of 62\n \n1  support  and  extensive  verbal  support  and  encouragement  that  has  expressly  endorsed  the \n2  barricading and occupation of City streets and parks.   \n3  165.  Since the day that the City abandoned the East Precinct, the City had full knowledge \n4  of the problems created for businesses and residents in and around CHOP, including property \n5  damage, lack of police response, the inability for workers and residents to enter and leave the area, \n6  the  inability  for  businesses  to  receive  deliveries,  and  other  adverse  impacts  on  residents, \n7  businesses, and property owners in the area. The City nevertheless adopted a policy supporting the \n8  CHOP occupation, acting with deliberate indifference toward those suffering harms from it. \n9  Evidence of the Cityโs knowledge includes the following: \n10  a.  At a June 11, 2020 press conference with Mayor Durkan, Chief Best made \n11  it clear that the City was fully aware that its 9-1-1 response times had tripled and that \n12  there was a serious public-safety crisis for anyone who lives or works in CHOP. \n13  b.  On June 16, 2020, the City stated, via a press release from the Mayorโs \n14  office: \n \n15 \nBeginning last Tuesday, City officials have been on site on Capitol \nHill  to  work  [to]  meet  community  needs  including \n16 \nhygiene, sanitation and safety.  Utilities including  Puget  Sound \nEnergy and SPU have been able to respond to the area for service. \n17 \nSeattle Police Chief Carmen Best has visited the site multiple \n18  times. Over the past week, conversations continued between City \nofficials,  organizers  onsite  for  the  CHOP, residents and \n19  businesses. โฆ Every day, Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins, \nSeattle Department of Transportation Director Sam Zimbabwe, \n20  and Seattle Public Utilities General Manager Mami Hara have \nbeen  on  site.  On  Sunday,  they held  a  meeting with  onsite \n21 \norganizers, small businesses, and residents to discuss proposed \nchanges to the protest zone. \n22 \nc.  On information and belief, Mayor Durkan and the SPD have been inundated \n23 \nwith complaints about CHOP that describe in detail the extensive property damage, \n24 \nrestricted access, and economic loss that residents, businesses, and property owners are \n25 \nsuffering. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 41  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 42 of 62\n \n1  d.  In  response  to  at  least  some  requests  from  desperate  businesses  and \n2  residents for her to cease her support of CHOP, Mayor Durkanโs office has provided a \n3  stock response acknowledging that the City is โmaintainingโ a space for CHOP, \n4  including by, for example, providing a โsturdier concrete barrierโ to help CHOP block \n5  a public street. The stock response states in part as follows: \n \n6 \nThank you for reaching out.  \n \n7 \nThe Capitol Hill Organized Protest has emerged as a gathering \nplace where community members can demand change of their \n8 \nlocal,  state,  and  federal  government.  Capitol  Hill  and  Cal \n9  Anderson Park have long been a gathering place for justice. While \nthere have been inaccurate and misleading depictions of the CHOP \n10  from the President and some national media, the City believes first \namendment activities can continue while also maintaining public \n11  safety  and  allowing  access  for  residents  and  businesses  who \noperate in the area. Mayor Durkan believes these changes can help \n12 \nensure any focus of the CHOP and Cal Anderson will allow for \npeaceful demonstrations to continue. \n13 \n  \nBeginning last Tuesday, City officials have been on site on Capitol \n14 \nHill  to  work  [to]  meet  community  needs  including  hygiene, \n15  sanitation and safety.

Over \nthe past week, conversations continued between City officials, \n17  organizers onsite for the CHOP, residents and businesses. The \nCity is committed to maintaining space for community to come to \n18 \ntogether, protest and exercise their first amendment rights.

Additionally all \nplans have been crafted with the goal of allowing access for \n22  emergency personnel including fire trucks. \n \n23 \nEvery  day,  Seattle  Fire  Chief  Harold  Scoggins,  Seattle \nDepartment  of  Transportation  Director  Sam  Zimbabwe,  and \n24 \nSeattle Public Utilities General Manager Marni Hara have been on \nsite.

In coordination with protesters onsite, work began at \n1 \n6:30 a.m. on Tuesday to remove a tent barrier at 10th and Pine and \nreplace it with a sturdier concrete barrier to improve public safety. \n2 \nThe  City  has  successfully  worked  with  protesters  onsite  to \nreconfigure the CHOP to allow for public safety and better access \n3 \nfor  the  local  community.  That  has  involved  rerouting  traffic, \n4  freeing up alley access, opened streets, and replacing makeshift \nbarriers with heavy concrete barriers that can be painted.  \n5 \n6 \ne.  In addition to the numerous City officers listed above, Mayor Durkan \n7 \nherself has personally visited CHOP and has seen what is happening. In an interview given \n8 \nin her City offices on Facebook Live on June 12, 2020, Mayor Durkan made clear that she \n9 \nhad seen the barriers and talked to CHOP participants and apparently approved of them \n10 \nusing an individual with behavioral health issues to enforce the perimeter: โItโs interesting, \n11 \nwhen I was at the CHAZ, walking around, similar kind of philosophy, because thereโs this \n12 \none guy, some behavioral health issues, and it was like, look, he has some hard times, and \n13 \nhe helps on that barricade over there, and then when he starts having a hard time, we just \n14 \nbring him over here, take care of him, feed him. And thatโs what you gotta do, right?โ3 \n15 \nf.  On June 22, 2020, Mayor Durkan stated at a press conference: \n16   \nOver the days, tens of thousands of people have peacefully gathered \n17  or visited Capitol Hill. During the day, there have been no major \nincidents. But we know it is very different at night, particularly in \n18 \nrecent nights.

But the impacts have increased, and the \n1 \nsafety has decreased. Both on Saturday morning and last night there \nwere  incidents  of  gun  violence.  And  that  escalating  violence \n2 \nconcerns me, Chief Best,  residents,  businesses, and the greater \ncommunity. All of Capitol Hill has been impacted.  \n3 \n4 \ng.  At the same June 22, 2020 press conference, Chief Best stated that reports \n5 \nto the police demonstrate that some CHOP participants are โengaging in shootings, a rape, \n6 \nassaults, burglary, arson, and property destruction, and I have their police reports right here. \n7 \nIโm not making it up. These things have happened.โ \n8 \nh.  At a press conference on June 29, 2020, the morning after yet another fatal \n9 \nshooting in the CHOP area, Chief Best repeatedly emphasized how dangerous the situation \n10 \nis within CHOP, stating:  \n11   \n[I]tโs very unfortunate that we have yet another murder in this area \n12 \nidentified as the CHOP. Two African American men dead at a place \nwhere they claim to be working for Black Lives Matter. But theyโre \n13 \ngone. Theyโre dead now. And weโve had multiple other incidents โ \nassaults, rape, robbery, and shootings. And so, you know, this is \n14 \nsomething that is going to need to change. Weโre asking people to \n15  remove themselves from this area for the safety of the people. If they \ncare about people, theyโre gonna have to try to help us to make it \n16  safe. Not opposed to anybodyโs issue or concern. They certainly can \ndemonstrate, you know, and peacefully any place, but they canโt \n17  hostilely take over a neighborhood and cause the crime levels to go \nup like this. Two men are dead.

Reportedly,  the  City  reached  an  informal  agreement  with  CHOP \n8  participants to allow limited one-way access on Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues starting on June \n9  16, 2020 (Plaintiffs were not invited to participate in these negotiations). However, as part of that \n10  agreement, the City actually fortified the rest of CHOP with new barriers (again without providing \n11  Plaintiffs notice or an opportunity to be heard on the matter). And even the planned limited access \n12  for  some  streets  almost  immediately  broke  down  when  CHOP  participants  reestablished \n13  impediments. The Cityโs response to this was apparently to do nothing. \n14  169.  At the same time that the City has acted with deliberate indifference to property \n15  owners and people who live and work in and near CHOP, the City physically aided, endorsed, and \n16  actively encouraged CHOP participants to continue their occupation of public spaces. \n17  170.  The City physically aided CHOP participants in their occupation of the area in at \n18  least the following ways: \n19  a.  When the City abandoned the East Precinct on June 8, 2020, it left behind \n20  the barriers that had previously blocked street access and protected the East Precinct from \n21  protesters. These barriers foreseeably served as the raw materials that allowed CHOP \n22  participants to block streets and create CHOP within a very short time. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 48  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 49 of 62\n \n1  b.  On June 16, 2020, the City provided even more concrete barriers to CHOP \n2  participants so that CHOP participants could replace wooden barriers and fortify their \n3  blockages of streets.4 \n4  c.  The City provided portable toilets and wash stations for CHOP participants. \n5  d.  The  City  has  provided  medical  equipment,  including  beds  and  other \n6  supplies, to the CHOP โmedical tent.โ \n7  e.  The City provided nighttime lighting at Cal Anderson Park. \n8  171.  As the City admitted in Mayor Durkanโs July 1, 2020 emergency order, the City \n9  โfacilitatedโ CHOP by:  \n10  โ*  Providing basic hygiene, water, litter, and garbage removal. \n11  *  Temporarily allowing obstructions of public parks, streets, and sidewalks \n12  *  Modifying SPD and SFD response protocolsโฆ. \n13  *  Modifying streets and pedestrian access routes. \n14  *  Providing social services outreach and engagementโฆ. \n15  *  Facilitating  modified  city  services  delivery  to  local  residents  and  businesses \n16  impacted by events in this area.โ \n17  172.  The Cityโs policies effectively authorized the actions of the CHOP participants. The \n18  City communicated clearly to CHOP participants that they may indefinitely continue occupying \n19  the streets in the area, maintaining their barricades, and blocking traffic, all without interference \n20  from the City. The City has communicated this message in at least the following ways: \n21  a.  On June 11, 2020, during a joint press conference with the Chief of Police, \n22  Mayor Durkan stated: โThereโs not a specific date โฆ because we are trying to do things \n23  that are responsible.โ \n24 \n25 \n \n4 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 49  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 50 of 62\n \n1  b.

We could have the Summer of \n4  Love.โ \n5  c.  On June 16, 2020, the City announced through an official statement from \n6  Mayor Durkan that it had negotiated with CHOP participants to adjust some but not all \n7  their barriers to allow  one-way traffic on Twelfth Avenue.5 This agreement was an \n8  endorsement  of  CHOP  participantsโ  other  barriers  and  its  overall  occupation  of  the \n9  neighborhood. \n10  d.  In announcing the supposed opening of a one-way corridor, the City made \n11  clear in a statement from the Mayor that it was an active participant in maintaining and \n12  solidifying CHOP barriers and boundaries:   \n \n13 \nThe City is committed to maintaining space for community to come \ntogether, protest and exercise their first amendment rights. Minor \n14 \nchanges to  the protest  zone  will implement  safer  and sturdier \nbarriers to protect individuals in this area, allow traffic to move \n15 \nthroughout the Capitol Hill neighborhood, ease access for residents \n16  of apartment building in the surrounding areas, and help local \nbusinesses manage deliveries and logistics. [emphasis added]6 \n17 \ne.  Also on June 16, 2020, Mayor Durkan suggested that the City agreed that \n18 \npolice officers will only enter the occupied area for โsignificant life-safety issues.โ7  \n19 \nf.  On  June  22,  2020,  Mayor  Durkan  and  Chief  Best  held  a  joint  press \n20 \nconference in which they expressed concern about the impacts of CHOP but also indicated \n21 \nat that time there was no specific timeline or plan for lessening those impacts or removing \n22 \nthe blockades, barriers, and tents from CHOP. \n23 \n24 \n \n25  5 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n6 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n7 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 50  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 51 of 62\n \n1  173.  The City also made numerous statements indicating that it endorsed and would \n2  continue to support what CHOP participants were doing in the area, thereby ensuring the continued \n3  and indefinite occupation and blockading of the neighborhood, and all the damage it has caused \n4  and will cause. The Cityโs statements include at least the following: \n5  a.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan posted following on her Twitter page: \n6  โThe Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone #CHAZ is not a lawless wasteland of anarchist \n7  insurrection โ it is a peaceful expression of our communityโs collective grief and their \n8  desire to build a better world.โ \n9  b.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan also posted on her Twitter page: โFor the \n10  thousands of individuals who have been on Capitol Hill, I think youโve seen what Iโve \n11  seen: the painting of Black Lives Matter along Pine Street, food trucks, spaghetti potlucks, \n12  teach-ins, and movies.โ \n13  c.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan stated during a joint press conference with \n14  the Chief of Police:   \n \n15 \nLawfully gathering and expressing first Amendment rights, and \ndemanding we do better as a society, and providing true equity for \n16 \ncommunities of color, is not terrorism.

Food  trucks,  spaghetti \n19  potlucks, teach-ins, movies, free granola bars . . . . \n20  d.  During the same press conference on June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan also \n21  stated: \nThe Capitol Hill areaโin fact, some of my family is up there right \n22  nowโโฆ it is not an armed ANTIFA militia no-go zone. It is, a \nnumber of people are there, weโve had ongoing communications \n23 \nwith them, with the businesses, with the residents, and we will \nmake sure that we find some way for people to continue to protest \n24 \npeacefully while also getting ingress and egress.

But we want to make sure that the businesses \n1 \nand residents feel safe and weโll continue to move that forward. \n2 \n3  e.  During her Facebook Live interview, Mayor Durkan also stated โI was up \n4  there today, walking around, talking to people, and I think we just have to continue to \n5  listen to people and figure out a way that thereโs still a way for people to have that kind \n6  of free expression, but we need to open up the streets, too, at least 12th so we can get \n7  fire through, and like that, so weโre going to keep talking to people and listening to \n8  them. But I heard a lot of great ideas and I heard a lot of community strength there. \n9  That was cool.โ \n10  f.  Also on June 12, 2020, during her interview with CNNโs Chris Cuomo, \n11  Mayor Durkan said, โWeโve got four blocks in Seattle that just saw pictures of that is \n12  more like a block party atmosphere. Itโs not an armed takeover. Itโs not a military junta. \n13  We will โ we will make sure that we can restore this. But we have block parties and \n14  the like in this part of Seattle all the time. Itโs known for that.โ  \n15  g.  On June 12, 2020, Mayor Durkan endorsed the gardens being planted in Cal \n16  Anderson Park on Twitter: โEarlier today I visited the #CHAZ and met Marcus \n17  Henderson, the person behind the new community garden popping up in Cal Anderson \n18  Park. Read more about Marcus and the work thatโs gone into creating the gardens: \n19  thestanger.com/slog/2020/06/1.โ \n20  h.  Mayor Durkan also tweeted on June 12, 2020: โFor as long as I can \n21  remember, Capitol Hill has been autonomous โ itโs been a place where people go to \n22  express  themselves  freely.  Today  at  the  #CHAZ,  I  spoke  with  organizers  and \n23  community about how we can move forward and keep our communities safe, together.โ \n24 \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 52  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 53 of 62\n \n1  i.  Mayor Durkan tweeted on June 16, 2020: โThe #CHOP has emerged as a \n2  gathering place for community to demand change of their local, state, and federal \n3  government.โ \n4  j.  On June 19, 2020, Mayor Durkan officially declared that there was no \n5  longer a state of emergency in the City because โdemonstrations since that day have \n6  been and continue be largely peaceful.โ \n7  k.  On June 21, 2020, after two people were shot in CHOP and one of them \n8  died, Mayor Durkan issued a statement indicating that the City still had no plans to \n9  cease supporting CHOP and that the City was instead acting to work with and preserve \n10  CHOP. \n11  174.  The City changed its tone after it learned that this lawsuit would be filed, and \n12  especially after Plaintiffs filed their first complaint. This included finally clearing CHOP of \n13  barricades and CHOP participants on July 1, 2020, in the face of an impending motion for a \n14  temporary restraining order. But the Cityโs earlier assistance and endorsement of CHOP and \n15  CHOP participants caused, and continue to cause, harm to Plaintiffs and the Class that would not \n16  have occurred absent the Cityโs actions. \n17  175.  The clearing of the area on July 1, 2020, was easily and accomplished without \n18  violence on either side, demonstrating that the City could have and should have cleared the area \n19  far earlier. \n20  V.

The Class is hereby defined as follows: All persons or entities who own property \n24  in, have a business in, or reside in the area in the City of Seattle bounded by the following streets: \n25  Denny Way, Union Street, Thirteenth Avenue, and East Broadway.

The definition of the Class is unambiguous. Plaintiffs are members of the Class, \n4  and all members of the Class can be identified through public records and notified by mail or other \n5  means of notification. \n6  179.  The number of Class members makes joinder impractical. Plaintiffs do not know \n7  the exact number of members in the Class, but believe the total number of businesses, residents, \n8  and property owners in the Class to be in the thousands. \n9  180.  There  are  numerous  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  Class  that \n10  predominate over any individual issues. These issues include the following: \n11  a.  Whether the City has participated in, endorsed, or encouraged the creation, \n12  maintenance, and continued existence of CHOP. \n13  b.  All facts regarding the existence and maintenance of CHOP including at least \n14  the following: \n15  i.  The boundaries and nature of the SPDโs โno-goโ zone in and \n16  around CHOP. \n17  ii.  All  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  the  Cityโs \n18  participation in, endorsement of, or encouragement of the \n19  creation, maintenance, and continued existence of CHOP. \n20  iii.  The nature and scope of activities of CHOP participants. \n21  c.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class have legally protected constitutional property \n22  rights. \n23  d.  Whether the City has infringed on those property rights by its actions with \n24  regard to CHOP. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 54  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 55 of 62\n \n1  e.  Whether the City was required to provide notice and a hearing to Class \n2  members before infringing on those property rights. \n3  f.  Whether CHOP and CHOP participants are a nuisance within the meaning of \n4  RCW 7.48.010, et seq. \n5  g.  Whether the City has participated in the maintenance of that nuisance. \n6  h.  Whether the City has acted with deliberate indifference toward Plaintiffs and \n7  the Class. \n8  i.  Whether the harm suffered by Plaintiffs and the Class was foreseeable and \n9  obvious. \n10  j.  Whether the Cityโs actions constitute an unlawful gift within the meaning of \n11  the Washington Constitution. \n12  k.  Whether  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  have  suffered  a  taking  without  just \n13  compensation. \n14  l.  Whether the Cityโs actions were pursuant to a City policy. \n15  m. Whether the Cityโs actions were ratified by a City policymaker.  \n16  n.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to injunctive relief. \n17  181.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the members of the Class. All Plaintiffs \n18  reside in the Class and have been subject to the same course of conduct by the City. \n19  182.  The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the Class. Plaintiffs are all \n20  members of the Class and have there are no conflicts between Plaintiffs and other Class members. \n21  Plaintiffs are well-informed as to the nature of this case and the claims against the City and have \n22  retained competent and experienced counsel that intend to prosecute this action vigorously. \n23  183.  The City has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to all Plaintiffs \n24  and the Class such that injunctive relief is appropriate respecting the Class as a whole. \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 55  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 56 of 62\n \n1  184.  The issues that Class members have in common predominate over any individual \n2  issues. The City engaged in a common course of conduct giving rise to the harms suffered by \n3  Plaintiffs and the Class. A single, common policy is at issue in this case. Individual questions, if \n4  any, pale by comparison to the numerous common questions that dominate. The injuries sustained \n5  by the Class members flow, in each instance, from a common nucleus of operative facts. \n6  185.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \n7  adjudication of this controversy because joinder of all class members is impracticable. The \n8  prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would impose heavy burdens \n9  upon the courts and the City and would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications of the \n10  questions of law and fact common to the Class. A class action would achieve substantial economies \n11  of time, effort, and expense, and would assure uniformity of decision as to persons similarly \n12  situated without sacrificing procedural fairness. Individual litigation of the legal and factual issues \n13  raised by the conduct of the City would increase delay and expense to all parties and to the court \n14  system. The class action device presents far fewer management difficulties and provides the \n15  benefits of a single, uniform adjudication, economies of scale and comprehensive supervision by \n16  a single court. Given the similar nature of the claims of the members of the Class and the uniform \n17  application of Washington and federal law to the claims of Plaintiffs and the members of the Class, \n18  the Classโs claims can and will be most effectively managed by a class action. \n19     \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 56  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 57 of 62\n \n1  VI.

Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint as if set forth herein. \n7  187.  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  have  constitutionally  protected  property  interests,  as \n8  defined by Washington state law, to exclude others from their property, to the use and quiet \n9  enjoyment of their property, and to access their property via public rights-of-way.  \n10  188.  The City has infringed on those constitutionally protected interests, including by \n11  (1) creating, assisting, endorsing, and encouraging an indefinite, unpermitted occupation and \n12  blockade of the public streets, sidewalks, and parks in and around CHOP, thereby denying \n13  Plaintiffs access to their properties, and (2) creating, assisting, endorsing, and encouraging the \n14  pervasive vandalism and trespasses against Plaintiffsโ properties, thereby denying Plaintiffs the \n15  ability to use their properties and exclude others from them.  \n16  189.  Plaintiffs and the Class also have constitutionally protected liberty interests in the \n17  fundamental right of free movement and the right to remain in a public place of oneโs choosing.     \n18  190.  The City has infringed on those constitutionally protected liberty interests through \n19  its CHOP policies, including by, among other conduct as alleged throughout this Complaint, \n20  granting de facto autonomy over the CHOP area to the CHOP participants and allowing them to \n21  determine who could and could not travel through and within the CHOP area.   \n22  191.  The City has infringed on Plaintiffsโ constitutionally protected interests without \n23  providing Plaintiffs with any due process before depriving them of these interests, or providing \n24  any recourse following the deprivation of the interests. In particular, the City provided Plaintiffs \n25  with no notice or opportunity to be heard before or after depriving Plaintiffs of the freedom of \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 57  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 58 of 62\n \n1  movement, the right to access their properties, the right to use their properties, and the right to \n2  exclude others from their properties,  \n3  192.  The City has done so pursuant to City policy as created, ratified, and authorized by \n4  City policymakers, including Mayor Durkan, without any notice to Plaintiffs or opportunity for \n5  them to be heard.  \n6  193.  As a direct result of the Cityโs actions, Plaintiffs and the Class have been denied \n7  regular and customary use of, access to, and enjoyment of their property, including the ability to \n8  drive or park in CHOP, the ability to walk to their homes or business without obstruction, the \n9  ability to accept deliveries to their homes or business, the ability to prevent and remedy vandalism, \n10  the ability to prevent trespasses and theft against their properties, the ability to freely move about, \n11  and the ability to remain in a public place of oneโs choosing.  \n12  194.  Plaintiffs and the Class have been harmed by this deprivation, including through \n13  loss of revenue, loss of property value, damages to property, and other damages.  \n14  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION โ SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n15  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n16  U.S. Const. amend XIV ยง 1 \n17  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n18  195.

Plaintiffs have a right pursuant to substantive due process to be protected from \n21  state-created dangers. \n22  197.  The Cityโs actions, assistance, endorsements, and encouragements of CHOP and \n23  CHOP participants greatly increased the likelihood of property damage, loss of business revenue \n24  and rental income, personal injury, loss of use of property, and other damages to Plaintiffs.

All  damages  suffered,  and  still  to  be  suffered,  by  Plaintiffs  were  and  are \n4  foreseeable, known, and obvious.  \n5  199.  The City acted with deliberate indifference to the known and obvious harm that \n6  would be suffered by Plaintiffs. \n7  200.  The City did so pursuant to City policy as created and ratified by City policymakers, \n8  including Mayor Durkan. \n9  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION โ TAKING \n10  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n11  U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV \n12  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n13  201.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint. \n14  202.  Plaintiffs and the Class have constitutionally protected property rights to use and \n15  enjoy their properties, to exclude others from their properties, and to access their properties via \n16  public rights-of-way.  \n17  203.  The City deprived Plaintiffs of those rights by affirmatively creating, assisting, \n18  endorsing, and encouraging an indefinite, unpermitted invasion, occupation, and blockade of the \n19  public rights-of-way that provide access to Plaintiffsโ private properties, as well as by affirmatively \n20  creating,  assisting,  endorsing,  and  encouraging  the  physical  invasion  of  Plaintiffsโ  private \n21  properties by CHOP participants.  \n22  204.  The City did so pursuant to City policy as created and ratified by City policymakers, \n23  including Mayor Durkan. \n24  205.  Plaintiffs have not received compensation for the deprivation of their property \n25  rights. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 59  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 60 of 62\n \n1  206.  The Cityโs actions constitute an unlawful taking for private use and/or an unlawful \n2  taking for public use without just compensation, which has caused Plaintiffs economic harm, \n3  including through a loss of property value, loss of business revenue, and a loss of investment-\n4  backed expectations. \n5  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION โ NEGLIGENCE \n6  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n7  207.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint. \n8  208.  The Cityโs affirmative acts as described in this complaint placed Plaintiffs and \n9  Class members at high and unreasonable risk of foreseeable harm, including but not limited to \n10  property damage, lost income and revenue, excessive noise, public safety hazards, vandalism, and \n11  decreased or lost access to their homes, properties, and businesses. \n12  209.  The City had a duty to protect Plaintiffs and Class members from that foreseeable \n13  harm. \n14  210.  The City breached its duty to protect Plaintiffs and Class members from that \n15  foreseeable harm.  \n16  211.  The City also owed the Plaintiffs and Class members a duty pursuant to the Seattle \n17  Municipal Code, including Chapter 15.52, which required the City to protect Plaintiffs and Class \n18  members from unreasonable risks of property damage and other harm and dangers by designating \n19  an alternate proposal for those who wished to create and participate in CHOP.  \n20  212.  The City also breached the duty created by the Seattle Municipal Code by not \n21  implementing the required procedures, process, and protections. \n22  213.  The Cityโs breach of its duties proximately caused harm to Plaintiffs and Class \n23  members, including but not limited to property damage, lost income and revenue, exposure to \n24  excessive noise and public safety hazards, increased expenses for security, and lost property value. \n25     \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 60  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 61 of 62\n \n1  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION โ NUISANCE \n2  RCW 7.48.010, et. seq.. \n3  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n4  214.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint. \n5  215.  As a direct result of the Cityโs affirmative acts, foot and vehicular traffic on the \n6  public streets, sidewalks, and other right of ways surrounding the properties, businesses, and \n7  residences of Plaintiffs and Class members were physically blocked and/or impeded.  \n8  216.  The  blocking  and  impeding  of  foot  and  vehicular  traffic  substantially  and \n9  unreasonably interfered with Plaintiffsโ and Class membersโ use and enjoyment of their properties, \n10  including by blocking access to those properties, and has caused harm to Plaintiffs, including by \n11  reducing property values and resulting in lost revenues. \n12  217.  The City directly participated in the creation and maintenance of this nuisance, \n13  including by providing concrete barriers to be used for this specific purpose to the CHOP \n14  participants.  \n15  218.  In  addition  to  blocking  public  rights-of-way,  the  Cityโs  actions  created  and \n16  maintained a series of unlawful and/or unreasonable conditions, including excessive noise, public \n17  safety hazards, vandalism, and poor health and sanitation conditions.  \n18  219.  These conditions annoyed, injured, and endangered the comfort, repose, health, and \n19  safety of Plaintiffs and Class members, and rendered Plaintiffs and Class members insecure in the \n20  use of their properties. \n21  220.  These conditions substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiffsโ and \n22  Class membersโ use and enjoyment of their properties, including by creating a reasonable fear \n23  among Plaintiffs and Class members of using their properties, and caused harm to Plaintiffs and \n24  Class members, including by reducing property values, inflicting property damage, and causing \n25  lost revenues. \n \n27  SECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCOMPLAINT   1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28  Case No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 61  TEL,S (E2A06T)T 4L0E7,- 2W20A0S  H FIANXG,T (O20N6 )9 8410071-2 224 \n \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 28   Filed 10/30/20   Page 62 of 62\n \n1   \n2  VII.

OVERVIEW \n11  1.  The  rights  of  free  speech  and  to  peaceably  assemble  are  enshrined  in  our \n12  constitutional tradition. Plaintiffs support free-speech rights and support the efforts of those like \n13  Black Lives Matter who, by exercising such rights, are bringing issues such as systemic racism \n14  and  unfair  violence  against  African  Americans  by  police  to  the  forefront  of  the  national \n15  consciousness.  Specifically,  Plaintiffs  support  the  free-speech  rights  of  many  of  those  who \n16  gathered on Capitol Hill to form what has been called โCHAZ,โ standing for the โCapitol Hill \n17  Autonomous Zone,โ or โCHOPโ for โCapitol Hill Organized Protestโ or โCapitol Hill Occupying \n18  Protest.โ1   \n19  2.  This lawsuit does not seek to undermine CHOP participantsโ message or present a \n20  counter-message.  Rather,  this  lawsuit  is  about  the  constitutional  and  other  legal  rights  of \n21  Plaintiffsโbusinesses, employees, and residents in and around CHOPโwhich were overrun by \n22  the City of Seattleโs unprecedented decision to abandon and close off an entire city neighborhood, \n23  leaving  it  unchecked  by  the  police,  unserved  by  fire  and  emergency  health  services,  and \n24  inaccessible to the public at large. The Cityโs decision subjected businesses, employees, and \n \n25 \n1 This complaint primarily refers to the area as โCHOP,โ and the people who participated in CHOP who are not \nbusinesses, employees, or residents of the area as โCHOP participants.โ \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 2  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 3 of 65\n \n1  residents of that neighborhood to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an \n2  inability to use and access their properties. \n3  3.  On June 8, 2020, the City of Seattle (โthe Cityโ) abruptly deserted the Seattle Police \n4  Departmentโs East Precinct on the corner of Twelfth Avenue and E. Pine Street in Seattleโs Capitol \n5  Hill neighborhood, leaving behind numerous barriers that had previously been used as a line \n6  between police and protesters. \n7  4.  When the City abandoned the precinct and the nearby barriers, a number of \n8  individuals who had been in the area took control of the barriers and used them to block off streets \n9  in an area around the East Precinct.  \n10  5.  In  the  days  and  weeks  after  the  City  abandoned  the  East  Precinct,  CHOP \n11  participants occupied the public streets, sidewalks, and parks in the area at all hours of the day and \n12  night. Rather than seeking to restore order and protect the residents and property owners within \n13  CHOP, the City instead chose to actively endorse, enable, and participate in the occupation of \n14  CHOP.  \n15  6.  The City provided Cal Anderson Park, a public park located at the center of CHOP,  \n16  to CHOP for use as the staging ground supporting CHOPโs occupation of the surrounding area. \n17  Supported by the City, countless CHOP participants resided in the park at all times of day and \n18  night, having turned it into a tent city. At any given time, hundreds of CHOP participants camped \n19  out in the park. Violence, vandalism, excessive noise, public drug use, and other crimes were \n20  rampant within the park.  \n21  7.  The Cityโs conduct resulted in CHOP being blocked off from public access. Among \n22  other conduct detailed below, the City provided the participants with concrete barriers to use to \n23  block the streets, which CHOP participants indeed used to barricade the streets and create borders. \n24  These borders, at times, were guarded by armed CHOP participants who oversaw who could or \n25  could not enter CHOP. As a result, the streets were barred to most all vehicular traffic, making it \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 3  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 4 of 65\n \n1  virtually impossible for residents and businesses to access their buildings, receive deliveries, and \n2  provide goods and services to the few customers willing to enter CHOP.  \n3  8.  The Cityโs conduct also resulted in the elimination of basic public safety within \n4  CHOP and nearby areas. For example, the City enacted a policy under which police would not \n5  enter the CHOP area except during life-and-death emergencies, and, even in those situations, the \n6  response was, at best, muted and late. After a fatal shooting in the early morning of June 20, 2020, \n7  for example, officers did not even approach the area of the shooting until approximately 20 minutes \n8  after the shooting, and no professional medical response was available for at least 15 minutes. At \n9  other times, even during life-and-death emergencies, the police acquiesced to demands from \n10  CHOP participants that they abandon the area. The City acknowledged the serious safety issues it \n11  created,  in  particular  noting  that  there  were  โdangerous  conditionsโ  at  night,  but  the  City \n12  nonetheless chose to maintain its policy of providing resources and support to the CHOP occupiers.  \n13  9.  The Cityโs conduct enabled the widespread destruction and vandalism of private \n14  property. Graffiti was and is pervasive throughout the areaโit is not only on barriers, streets, \n15  sidewalks, but also on nearly every private building within CHOP. Graffiti that was painted over \n16  almost immediately returned, and property owners were told by CHOP participants that if they \n17  dared to paint over graffiti, their buildings would be more severely vandalized or even burned to \n18  the ground. The City did nothing to prevent this conduct from June 8, 2020 to July 1, 2020, but, \n19  instead, actively endorsed and supported the ongoing occupation of the CHOP area and the \n20  destruction of property that accompanied it. As a result, property owners and their tenants were \n21  not able to fully use their properties. Property owners and tenants, for instance, had to lock and \n22  barricade their garages and loading areas at risk of having CHOP participants entering and \n23  vandalizing them. \n24  10.  The property owners, businesses, and residents in the area suffered ever-increasing \n25  property damage and economic loss every day that CHOP existed in their neighborhood, all \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 4  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 5 of 65\n \n1  because of the Cityโs active support, encouragement, and endorsement of the occupation. In \n2  particular, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan provided the CHOP participants with not just tangible \n3  resources but also a de facto stamp of approval. Her tweets, interviews, and other statements made \n4  it clear that the City was fully aware of what is happening, had no plan or timeline for remedying \n5  the ongoing harm, and in fact viewed the occupation of Capitol Hill as something akin to a \n6  perpetual block party, which the City wanted to support because of the viewpoints of CHOP \n7  participants. \n8  11.  Plaintiffs and others repeatedly pleaded with Mayor Durkan and others to cease \n9  enabling the destruction of their property and the imminent dangers posed to them and their \n10  neighborhood. But the City did not listen, or did not care, and it was only after Plaintiffs had to \n11  resort to litigation to make themselves heard that the City finally took action to disband CHOP \n12  12.  Again,  this  case  is  not  about  Plaintiffsโ  agreement  or  disagreement  with  the \n13  inspiration for CHOP, or the viewpoints expressed by the people occupying that area. Instead, it \n14  is about the Cityโs active, knowing endorsement and support of a destructive occupation of a \n15  neighborhood to the detriment of the well-being of those who live and work in that neighborhood. \n16  II.  PARTIES \n17  13.  Plaintiffs are residents, tenants, property owners, and small businesses in Seattleโs \n18  Capitol Hill neighborhood that have been harmed by CHOP.  \n19  14.  Plaintiff Hunters Capital LLC (โHunters Capitalโ) is a Washington limited liability \n20  company with its principal place of business in King County, Washington. Hunters Capital is a \n21  real-estate development, investment, and management company, headquartered near Cal Anderson \n22  Park in the Capitol Hill neighborhood with offices in the zone occupied by CHOP at 1620 \n23  Broadway Seattle, Washington. Hunters Capital owns and manages a portfolio of commercial, \n24  multi-family residential, and mixed-use properties in the Capitol Hill neighborhood within and \n25  around CHOP, including 500 E.

Pine Street, 426 15th Avenue East, 415 18th Avenue South, 523 15th Avenue East, \n2  1641 Nagle Place, and 501 E. Pike Street, in addition to other properties in the area it manages. \n3  Hunters Capital has suffered economic loss from CHOP. Additionally, its property was damaged \n4  and its tenants and employees were harassed.  \n5  15.  Plaintiff SRJ Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Car Tender (โCar Tenderโ) is a Washington \n6  corporation with its principal place of business in King County, Washington. Car Tender is an \n7  automotive  repair  business.  Car  Tenderโs  shop  is  located  at  1706  12th  Avenue  in  Seattle, \n8  Washington, in the heart of Seattleโs Capitol Hill neighborhood and directly borders the zone \n9  occupied by CHOP. Car Tender has been a small business since 1971 and currently has 10 \n10  employees. Car Tenderโs shop was vandalized and broken into by CHOP participants and its \n11  employees were assaulted. With access for customers cut off by CHOP, it suffered a loss of \n12  business.  \n13  16.  Plaintiff The Richmark Company d/b/a Richmark Label (โRichmark Labelโ) is a \n14  family-owned  Washington  company  with  its  principal  place  of  business  in  King  County, \n15  Washington. Richmark Label is a label printing and manufacturing business located at 1110 E. \n16  Pine Street, Seattle, Washington. Richmark Label is one of the largest manufacturing employers \n17  on Capitol Hill, with over 70 employees working at its facilities on Pine Street. Due to street \n18  blockages and barricades, and driversโ fear for safety, trucks and delivery vehicles were unable on \n19  multiple  occasions  to  access  Richmark  Labelโs  manufacturing  facility.

Plaintiff Rancho Bravo, Inc. (โRancho Bravoโ) is a Washington corporation with \n2  its principal place of business in King County, Washington. Rancho Bravo is a restaurant serving \n3  Mexican food and is located at 1001 E. Pine St, Seattle, Washington. The location where Rancho \n4  Bravo operates its restaurant was inhabited by CHOP participants who operated a makeshift \n5  medical center. Access to its parking lot and the streets surrounding Rancho Bravo was obstructed \n6  by CHOP participants. CHOP participants operated an unpermitted food stand on the street near \n7  to Rancho Bravoโs restaurant. \n8  32.   Defendant the City of Seattle (โthe Cityโ) is a municipality incorporated in the \n9  State of Washington. The Seattle Police Department (โSPDโ) is a division of the City. Jenny \n10  Durkan is the Mayor and chief executive of the City, and a policymaker for the City.  \n11  III.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12  33.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. ยง1331 \n13  because this action presents federal questions and seeks to redress deprivations of rights under \n14  the United States Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n15  34.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(1) because the events \n16  giving rise to these claims arose in the Western District of Washington. \n17  IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n18  A.  The Creation of CHOP \n19  35.  On June 8, 2020, with protests ongoing near the East Precinct, the City emptied the \n20  East Precinct of all weapons and valuables, and then abandoned it. \n21  36.  The City left behind at the precinct and in the surrounding areas large barriers that \n22  had been used in previous days to try to limit the movements of protesters. \n23  37.  Predictably, almost immediately after the SPD abandoned the precinct and the \n24  barriers, CHOP participants used the barriers to block off streets in the area and create a โno-copโ \n25  zone. Initially, the blocked-off area extended to all streets within one block from the precinct. \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 10  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 11 of 65\n \n1  38.  Without  any  police  presence,  the  CHOP  participants  organized  themselves, \n2  declared the area โFree Capitol Hill,โ and stationed guards by the barriers that the City had \n3  abandoned, thereby creating borders for the occupied area. The area later expanded, was referred \n4  to as CHAZ for several days, and eventually became known as CHOP. \n5  39.  CHOPโs unofficial boundaries stretched north to East Denny Way, east to 13th \n6  Avenue, south to East Pike Street, and west to Broadway. It encompassed the entirety of Cal \n7  Anderson Park and sixteen city blocks in all. \n8  B.  The Activities of CHOP Participants \n9  40.  After the SPD vacated Capitol Hill, the CHOP participants claimed the area as their \n10  own with a physical presence and a loose form of governance and justice. \n11  41.  CHOP participants have maintained borders with barriers and people patrolling the \n12  perimeter, as well as vehicles parked in the middle of rights-of-way.  \n13  42.  Many CHOP participants lived on the streets and sidewalks and in Cal Anderson \n14  Park, in tents such as the following: \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22   \n23  43.  They painted graffiti on most available surfaces, and if a property owner painted \n24  over the graffiti, the graffiti was typically replaced within a few hours. CHOP participants even \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 11  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 12 of 65\n \n1  threatened business owners with retaliation if they painted over graffiti. Examples of this pervasive \n2  graffiti include the following: \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 12  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 13 of 65\n \n1  44.  CHOP participants created various unpermitted, ad hoc food dispensaries and \n2  stores on public property in front of and near private residences and businesses. \n3  45.  CHOP participants created a โmedical tentโ at the Rancho Bravo restaurant under \n4  a festival tent. \n5  46.  On occasion, CHOP participants acted as a replacement police force, including by \n6  demanding that business owners release individuals who were caught committing crimes and by \n7  attempting to perform their own crime investigations. \n8  47.  CHOP participants occupied the streets and sidewalks 24 hours a day, and had \n9  speeches, debates, movies, music, and various other activitiesโincluding, in some instances, \n10  illegal fireworks showsโon the streets and sidewalks. Disturbances and noise pollution extended \n11  well past 10 p.m. and typically into the early morning of the next day.  \n12  48.  CHOP participants were observed carrying guns in the public streets and parks in \n13  broad daylight.  \n14  49.  Cal Anderson Park was one of the focal points of CHOP. The approximately 7-acre \n15  park, which was ostensibly owned by the City, was entirely handed over to the CHOP participants. \n16  The  City  supported  and  enabled  CHOPโs  occupation  of  the  park  through  providing \n17  washing/sanitation facilities, portable toilets, nighttime lighting, and other material support. \n18  50.  As a result of the Cityโs actions, Cal Anderson Park was transformed into a massive \n19  tent city for CHOP participants, as shown here:  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 13  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 14 of 65\n \n1  51.  Members of the public could not use Cal Anderson Park. CHOPโs control of the \n2  park continued unabated until July 1, 2020. Local residents attempting to take pictures too close \n3  to Cal Anderson Park were threatened by CHOP participants, who have said they would steal their \n4  smartphones. \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12   \n13  52.  CHOP participants even built makeshift gardens on the parkโs lawn to grow food \n14  for CHOP. The City handed over public property in the park for this use, as shown here: \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22  53.  CHOPโs control of Cal Anderson Park was a central nuisance to local residents and \n23  businesses. Many of the Plaintiffsโ properties overlook, border, or are adjacent to the park. Not \n24  only  were  those  residents  deprived  of  their  use  of  the  park,  but  problems  from  CHOPโs \n25  encampments in the park spilled over into the entire neighborhood. The hundreds of CHOP \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 14  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 15 of 65\n \n1  participants in the park created excessive noise, even late into the night, in violation of the Cityโs \n2  ordinances. Participants set off fireworks at all hours of the day and night. Trash, feces, and other \n3  refuse built up in the park, affecting the whole area. Worst of all, Cal Anderson Park was one of \n4  the most violent areas of CHOP. Local residents saw individuals in Cal Anderson Park carrying \n5  firearms. \n6  C.  The Effects of CHOP on Plaintiffs and the Class \n7  54.  The impacts on Plaintiffs and the Class were extensive. The experiences of each \n8  Plaintiff are described in detail below. However, all Plaintiffs and Class members have in common \n9  at least the following harms: a lack of public safety assistance and substantially impaired access to \n10  and  use  of  their  properties.  Lack  of  public-safety  assistance  even  in  life-threatening \n11  circumstances. \n12  55.  The Cityโs endorsement and recognition of CHOP went so far that the SPD adopted \n13  a policy and practice of not entering the area except in the case of life-threatening crimes, and even \n14  then, the SPD response was weak and delayed. \n15  56.  On information and belief, the SPD considered the area from Denny Way to Union \n16  Street and Thirteenth Avenue to Broadway to be a โno responseโ zone where the SPD would not \n17  respond to anything but the most serious crimes. \n18  57.  And even in the most serious situations, the SPDโs response was unconscionably \n19  delayed. As SPD Chief Carmen Best explained on June 11, 2020, as she stood next to Mayor \n20  Durkan: \n \n21 \nSPD has a responsibility to provide public safety services to the \nentire East precinct and the City. The actions of a small group cannot \n22 \nand should not deprive an entire segment of our community from \npublic-safety services. In the first day of the SPD not having access \n23 \nto the precinct, response times for crimes in progress were over \n24  fifteen minutes, about three times as long as the average โฆ. If that \nis your mother, or your sister, your cousin, your neighborโs kid that \n25  is being raped, robbed, assaulted, and otherwise victimized, youโre \nnot going to want to have to report that it took the police three times \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 15  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 16 of 65\n \nlonger to get there to provide services to them. The difference in the \n1 \namount of time could protect someoneโs life and prevent a violent \nattack. \n2 \n3  58.  Recent  events  in  CHOP  demonstrate  that  if  anything,  Chief  Best  was  being \n4  conservative in her description of the public-safety emergency in CHOP. \n5  59.  At approximately 2:20 a.m. on June 20, 2020, there were two people shot in CHOP. \n6  At least one of the shootings happened at or near the intersection of Tenth Avenue and Pine Street, \n7  around the corner from the abandoned East Precinct. One of the victims died before reaching the \n8  hospital. The second was admitted with life-threatening injuries. No suspects have been identified \n9  or taken into custody. \n10  60.  Raw video streamed from the area shortly after that shooting demonstrates the \n11  enormity of the risk created by the City for anyone who lives or works in CHOP. That video clearly \n12  captured the following:2 \n13  a.  The video appears to start a couple of minutes after the shooting. \n14  b.  One shooting victim was taken to the CHOP โmedic tentโ located in a \n15  parking lot under a festival tent. \n16  c.  No professional medics arrived until approximately 15 minutes into the \n17  video to tend to the first shooting victim. \n18  d.  No police were in the area until approximately 18 minutes into the video, \n19  when cars and lights and can be seen several blocks away, and police can be heard on \n20  megaphones demanding that barriers be moved to allow the police to enter. \n21  e.  Approximately 19 minutes into the video, a small phalanx of approximately \n22  8 police officers entered the area on foot and arrived in the area of the medical tent, \n23  apparently for the purpose of trying to locate and extract the first shooting victim. \n24 \n25 \n \n2 https://www.facebook.com/WWConverge/videos/297548387941384/?v=297548387941384 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 16  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 17 of 65\n \n1  f.   The  phalanx  of  officers  was  immediately  surrounded,  yelled  at,  and \n2  pursued by CHOP participants. \n3  g.  One police car finally entered the area approximately 20 minutes into the \n4  video. \n5  h.  The police did not engage with the crowd and promptly left the area, after \n6  which CHOP participants created a human chain across the street to bar any further \n7  entry. \n8  i.  There was a second shooting victim in CHOP located a couple of blocks \n9  away. It appears that no medics or police responded at all to the location of the second \n10  victim. \n11  j.  Approximately 35 minutes into the livestream video, the second victim was \n12  placed into a plain white cargo van and presumably taken to the hospital. A voice can \n13  be heard explaining that Medic One drove by but did not come to the assistance of the \n14  person who ended up in the white van. \n15  k.  Shortly after the second victim was driven away, private citizens began \n16  looking for bullet casings. No police were on the scene to perform any investigation in \n17  the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \n18  61.  On June 21, 2020, another shooting occurred in the area at approximately 11:00 at \n19  night. There was no police or medic response, and the shooting victim was transported to the \n20  emergency room by private vehicle. \n21  62.  In a press conference with Mayor Durkan on June 22, 2020, Chief Best reiterated \n22  the seriousness of the public-safety situation, stating: \n \n23 \nthere are countless individuals who are in the CHOP that are \nthere  to  engage,  as  the  Mayor  said  earlier,  in  peaceful \n24 \ndemonstrations. But there are also groups of individuals \nengaging in shootings, a rape, assaults, burglary, arson, and \n25 \nproperty destruction, and I have their police reports right \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 17  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 18 of 65\n \nhere.

This is not about politics \n2 \nand Iโm not a politician. This isnโt a debate about First \nAmendment rights. This is about life or death. So we need a \n3 \nplan. \n4 \n5  63.  In the early hours of June 29, yet another shooting occurred in the area.  This \n6  shooting, at 12th and Pike, left a 16-year-old dead and a 14-year-old in critical condition.   \n7  64.  According to reports, the shooting began when โCHOP securityโ opened fire on a \n8  white Jeep that had crashed into the CHOP barricades. Reports indicate that over a dozen shots \n9  were fired. \n10  65.  The City did not provide emergency medical services at the scene of the shooting \n11  in the CHOP area. Instead, one of the victims was transported by private vehicle out of the CHOP \n12  area and to a hospital. The other had to be taken โto a meeting point with Seattle Fire Department \n13  Personnel, who then transported the victim to Harborview Medical Center.โ \n14  66.  By the time the police reached the scene of the shooting at 12th and Pike to begin \n15  an investigation, much of the key evidence had already been tampered with or lost. As the SPD \n16  blotter put it, when police arrived on the scene to inspect the Jeep, โit was clear the crime scene \n17  had been disturbed.โ No suspects have been identified or placed into custody.   \n18  67.  That same night, and possibly in connection with the same incident, bullets were \n19  shot into the Onyx Condominium building, with at least one bullet coming within a foot of a \n20  resident asleep in bed.   \n21  68.  Over the course of nine days, there were two homicides in CHOP. There had been \n22  no homicides in Capitol Hill in 2020 before CHOP started, and in all of 2019, there were only \n23  three homicides in the entire Capitol Hill neighborhood.   \n24   \n25   \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 18  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 19 of 65\n \n1  2.  Impeded access to and use of property \n2  69.  All Plaintiffs and Class members did not have the ability to use public rights of \n3  way, including streets and sidewalks, to access their homes, businesses, and properties. \n4  70.  CHOP participants regularly moved the City-provided barriers and other large \n5  objects wherever they wished to block traffic, sidewalks, and all other manner of ingress and \n6  egress. \n7  71.  In many cases, this meant people could not use public streets and rights-of-way to \n8  enter or exit their homes or businesses, clients cannot visit businesses, and businesses could not \n9  get deliveries. The difficulties were magnified for the elderly and the disabled. \n10  72.  The barriers and the constant presence of CHOP participants also meant that \n11  residents, property owners, and businesses did not have full use of their property. If they could \n12  access their property, safety necessitated that many of them keep their doors locked. Many portions \n13  of property that were normally freely accessibleโsuch as garagesโhad to be shut at all hours or \n14  else CHOP participants would vandalize them. \n15  73.  Garbage and recycling services could not enter the area due to the myriad of \n16  barricades and CHOP border guards, forcing residents and businesses to pile up refuse without any \n17  idea when they might be able to discard it. \n18  74.  Residents and businesses in the area were unable to receive deliveries at their homes \n19  because delivery companies could not or would not enter CHOP and the surrounding area because \n20  of barriers and safety concerns. \n21  75.  Residents in and near CHOP were forced to endure loud noises, music, and even \n22  fireworks at all times of the day and night. \n23  76.  Residents in and near CHOP did not have free and safe access in or out of their \n24  homes. \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 19  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 20 of 65\n \n1  77.  Businesses were unable to operate normally, or even open, because of blocked \n2  access and concerns for the safety of their suppliers, employees, and customers. \n3  78.  All of this is caused extensive economic and other harm to Plaintiffs and all other \n4  members of the Class. \n5  79.  As Chief Best stated during a joint press conference with Mayor Durkan on the \n6  afternoon of July 1, 2020: \n \n7 \nIf you have watched the news footage, you have seen how absolutely \ndevastating  the  damage  to  this  neighborhood  is.  I  can  tell  you \n8 \npersonally, after walking through the area, we walked the full perimeter, \nI was just stunned by the amount of graffiti, garbage, and property \n9 \ndestruction. As we walked around the neighborhood, many people were \n10  coming out of their apartments and homes and thanking the officers \nprofusely for being there and for helping to clean out the area. So, we \n11  donโt even know how much trauma people were experiencing because \nof what was happening in that area. \n12 \n13  3.   Plaintiffsโ individual stories \n14  80.  The impact of CHOP on residents, businesses, and property owners is best seen \n15  through the stories of Plaintiffs, who are suffering from the Cityโs policies every day. \n16  81.  Each Plaintiff and the Class has sufferedโand continues to suffer irreparable \n17  economic and non-economic injury as a direct result of CHOP participantsโ presence on Capitol \n18  Hill and its aftereffects. The Cityโs support for CHOP enabled, aided, and abetted the ongoing \n19  harm to each of the Plaintiffs and members of the Class.  \n20  82.  Although the City cleared CHOP on the morning of July 1, 2020, Plaintiffs and the \n21  Class have continued to suffer harm due to restrictions in the area resulting from the existence of \n22  CHOP, the continued public perception of the area as dangerous and unstable, and lost business \n23  that may never return. Plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to seek recovery for such ongoing \n24  harm. \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 20  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 21 of 65\n \n1  83.  Plaintiff  Car  Tender.  Plaintiff  Car  Tenderโa  local  small  business  with  one \n2  locationโ has suffered a dramatic drop off in its auto-repair business since the establishment of \n3  CHOP. Since early June 2020, business revenues declined around 40% from the prior months of \n4  April and May 2020. This drop-in sales actually understates Car Tenderโs losses, however, as April \n5  and Mayโs revenues were already lower due to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In late May \n6  2020, Car Tenderโs revenues began an upswing coming out of the shutdown, which was suddenly \n7  interrupted by the sharp drop in customers caused by CHOP.  \n8  84.  Car Tenderโs loss of business revenue is a direct result of CHOP. Access to the \n9  shop has at times been substantially impeded due to barricaded streets. Further, customers told Car \n10  Tender that they would not bring their cars into the shop, out of fear of CHOPโs location just down \n11  the street from Car Tender. Customers even came to the shop only to immediately turn around and \n12  leave, because they were fearful to leave their cars at Car Tenderโs location. Because of the Cityโs \n13  enablement of CHOP, Car Tender is struggling to make ends meet. \n14  85.  Car  Tenderโs  premises  were  also  vandalized  by  CHOP  participants.  CHOP \n15  participants tore down the fence around Car Tenderโs car lot, permanently damaging the cement \n16  post such that an entire new fence will need to be constructed. They painted and vandalized with \n17  graffiti the side of Car Tenderโs building. Car Tender was fearful that if the company tried to cover \n18  up the graffiti they would face reprisals from CHOP participants, as CHOP participants threatened \n19  to burn down other properties in the area when owners attempted to cover or clean up graffiti. \n20  86.  Car Tenderโs customers were understandably concerned for their safety, and with \n21  good reason. Indeed, Car Tenderโs shop was recently broken into by a man who assaulted the son \n22  of one of Car Tenderโs owners with a knife. The details of the incident demonstrate the extreme \n23  risk of harm to which the City has exposed Plaintiffs and the Class. \n24  87.  On June 14th at around 9:30 p.m., a person broke into Car Tenderโs building, armed \n25  himself with a knife and a spike that he found inside the building, and lit a fire in the shop. After \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 21  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 22 of 65\n \n1  receiving a call from a neighbor alerting them to the break-in, Car Tenderโs owner and son called \n2  9-1-1 and then went to the premises themselves, where they found the shopโs garage had been \n3  broken into. They found that the property had also been vandalized with Purell hand sanitizer, \n4  which the intruder had dumped everywhere to use as fuel for the fire he had started. That fire was \n5  still burning when the owner and his son arrived, but they were able to extinguish it. The intruder \n6  was still on the premises, however, and he accosted the ownerโs son with the knife and spike and \n7  abruptly assaulted him by hitting him in the chest. \n8  88.  Although blindsided by the intruderโs sudden unprovoked attack, the owner and his \n9  son were able to wrestle the intruder to the floor in a scuffle. The intruder meanwhile tried to cut \n10  the sonโs femoral artery and landed two large cuts to his clothing on the side of his leg. He also \n11  repeatedly attempted to stab the son with the spike. \n12  89.  After subduing the intruder, Car Tenderโs owner called 9-1-1 again, reporting the \n13  arson, burglary, and assault, requesting police assistance at the scene. Other neighbors also called \n14  9-1-1. But, despite the multiple 9-1-1 calls. the police never responded to the scene that evening. \n15  90.  Several CHOP participants on the street who witnessed the incident approached the \n16  shop and demanded the release of the apprehended intruder. Car Tenderโs owner at first insisted \n17  that he was waiting for the police to come to the scene. An angry mob of CHOP participants, \n18  perhaps as many as 500 although possibly more, gathered around Car Tenderโs fence and broke it \n19  down, insisting on the release of the intruder. Members of CHOP mob insisted that the police \n20  would never dare respond. Faced with a threat of mob violence, Car Tenderโs owner and son \n21  handed the intruder over to CHOP participants. \n22  91.  Because the police refused to protect Car Tenderโs property from burglary and \n23  arson, Car Tenderโs owner was forced to sleep at the shop in an effort to protect it.  Car Tenderโs \n24  owner tried to contact Mayor Durkanโs office to report his concerns as a resident and small \n25  business owner but received no response. \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 22  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 23 of 65\n \n1  92.  Car Tenderโs experience was not unique. Other local businesses also suffered from \n2  the Cityโs actions. \n3  93.  Plaintiff  Richmark  Label.  Plaintiff  Richmark  Label  is  a  local  family-owned \n4  business on Capitol Hill that runs label-printing operations out of a manufacturing facility on Pine \n5  Street, directly adjacent to CHOP. Richmark Labelโs business has been negatively affected as a \n6  direct consequence of CHOP.  \n7  94.  CHOP frequently blocked access to the 11th Avenue side of Richmark Labelโs \n8  building, where Richmark Label maintains a loading dock for receiving deliveries and shipping. \n9  Richmark Label must receive deliveries on an ongoing basis in order to maintain its business as \n10  well as make shipment of its products. Richmark Labelโs ability to use its loading dock was \n11  substantially impeded, as the 11th Avenue access was frequently blocked by barricades, or because \n12  CHOP participants engaged in intimidation tactics, or because of other CHOP activities. Some \n13  delivery drivers reported to Richmark Label that they would not even attempt delivery to their \n14  building, because it is unsafe. Several delivery drivers who attempted delivery were stopped and \n15  accosted by CHOP participants. Richmark Labelโs usual shippers refused to deliver and UPS \n16  recently elected not to come and pick up a pallet of wine labels for shipment, one of Richmark \n17  Labelโs largest sources of business. On other occasions, labels shipped late, incurring costs and \n18  straining Richmark Labelโs business relationships with its customers. \n19  95.   The Cityโs support of CHOP put Richmark Labelโs business at risk, as well as the \n20  livelihood of its over 70 employees. \n21  96.  This loss to business is not the only harm Richmark Label is suffering due to CHOP. \n22  Richmark Label owns its facilities, a historic building from 1927, on which the company paid to \n23  have an artistic mural painted as a gift to the whole Capitol Hill community. That mural was \n24  vandalized by CHOP participants beyond repair, whereas before CHOPโs occupation there had \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 23  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 24 of 65\n \n1  only been minor instances of occasional graffiti. Now the wall will have to be repaired and \n2  repainted.  \n3  97.  Richmark Label also owns a parking lot on the 11th Avenue side of the building. It \n4  rents the parking spaces during non-business hours. Richmark Label was forced by CHOP to shut \n5  the parking lot down because the roads for accessing the parking lot were blocked and customers \n6  are and were afraid of entering the area. The company is receiving none of the usual rental income \n7  it typically receives from the parking spaces. The parking lot also typically serves as customer \n8  parking for Richmark Label and several of its tenants who rent space in the companyโs building. \n9  But, due to CHOP and its aftereffects, both Richmark Label and its tenants are being deprived of \n10  customer parking. \n11  98.  Unauthorized cars also parked in Richmark Labelโs lot. Richmark Label contacted \n12  towing companies, but all refused to tow the cars because CHOP made the area unsafe. Richmark \n13  Label called the police on multiple occasions regarding the unauthorized cars parked on their \n14  property, but the police would not act. Richmark Label called 9-1-1 regarding the unauthorized \n15  cars trespassing on their property, only to be told at least twice that SPD was not responding to \n16  calls in the area.  \n17  99.  Like Plaintiff Car Tender, Richmark Label was threatened with violence by CHOP \n18  participants. When CHOP first arose, Richmark Label allowed a local news crew to access its roof \n19  to film the protests and CHOP. SPD officers then also accessed Richmark Labelโs roof to assess \n20  the situation, where they were photographed by CHOP participants. Those photographs were then \n21  posted online, leading to a social media frenzy against the company. Subsequently, Richmark \n22  Labelโs employees reported that they did not feel safe coming to work, because of the threat of \n23  harassment and violence from CHOP participants. CHOP participants set up cones across 11th \n24  Avenue, which must be crossed to access Richmark Labelโs building. CHOP participants stopped \n25  people and required them to answer questions about who they are and what they were doing in the \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 24  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 25 of 65\n \n1  area before letting them pass. The result is that customers, shippers, and employees were scared to \n2  even enter the area.  \n3  100.  Richmark Label was in contact with the Mayorโs office, but the office did not return \n4  the companyโs calls, offer any assistance, or provide any opportunity to challenge the Cityโs \n5  decision to authorize the ongoing occupation of the CHOP area. The Cityโs support of CHOP \n6  through  encouragement  and  material  support  enabled  CHOPโs  threat  to  Richmark  Labelโs \n7  business.  \n8  101.  Plaintiff Northwest Liquor and Wine. Northwest Liquor and Wineโa one-location \n9  store specializing in high-end wine, beer, and spiritsโis yet another local small business that \n10  suffered as a result of the CHOP occupation. After record sales in May 2020, the store had its \n11  worst month in June 2020 since opening at that location in 2012. In June 2020, the companyโs \n12  sales were down approximately 70% from average.  \n13  102.  Customers are unable to visit the store because the surrounding streets have been \n14  blocked off to traffic. Northwest Liquor and Wine has access to an adjacent parking garage, but \n15  they have been forced to close it to prevent CHOP participants from camping out in it and even \n16  starting fires. CHOP barricades also meant that suppliers were unable to make deliveries.  \n17  103.  The owners and employees did not feel safe, as there were disturbances in the store \n18  and people on the streets nearby carrying guns. Northwest Liquor and Wine normally maintains \n19  around 4 to 6 employees. Due to CHOP, its employees were understandably too scared to come to \n20  work out of concern for their safety.  \n21  104.  Plaintiff  Sage  Physical  Therapy.  Plaintiff  Sage  Physical  Therapy  (โSageโ)  is \n22  another small business that suffered losses because of CHOP. When CHOP started in early June, \n23  clients immediately stopped coming, saying that they are scared to come near CHOP. Additionally, \n24  the few clients willing to venture near CHOP found Sageโs offices to be inaccessible, as many of \n25  the nearby streets have been blocked, and even on the few streets in the area that were not been \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 25  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 26 of 65\n \n1  blocked, the City ceased enforcing parking restrictions, allowing vehicles to remain parked \n2  indefinitely. As a result, there was no parking and Sageโs offices were therefore not accessible to \n3  its clients. The lack of access is especially hard on Sageโs clientele, as many are seeking therapy \n4  for injury and are unable to walk far. Sageโs clients cancelled appointments because of CHOP.  \n5  105.  Even one of Sageโs patients who resides within walking distance of Sageโs offices \n6  was unable to access Sageโs building due to CHOP. Sage has a patient who resides in an apartment \n7  building inside CHOP. The patient is on crutches from traumatic leg injury. She resides only a \n8  short distance from Sage, but the City enabled CHOP to place barriers across sidewalks, and \n9  different barricades popped up near Sage every day. Sageโs injured patient was not able to navigate \n10  around the barriers and the patient reported to Sage that she was upset about not being able to get \n11  to her much-needed therapy appointments.   \n12  106.  Sageโs owner also feared violence from the presence of CHOP. After CHOP arose, \n13  she observed a van parked outside Sageโs office with an automatic weapon in the front seat and a \n14  plywood barrier and padlock so that the back of the van was not visible. Sageโs owner is aware \n15  that CHOP participants nearby reportedly highjacked vehicles. Sageโs owner is also aware of an \n16  incident involving another local business owner known to Sageโs owner. After that business \n17  ownerโs store was closed for the day, a CHOP participant demanded to use the storeโs restroom, \n18  exposed himself to the female owner, and then attempted to assault the business owner, who \n19  fortunately was able to flee the scene. These incidents of violence against local businesses, \n20  compounded with a loss of business revenue, caused Sageโs owner physical stress, forced her to \n21  keep  the  office  door  locked  at  all  time  making  business  impossible,  and  acerbated  her \n22  hypertension.  \n23  107.  One of Sageโs clients reported that he was scared to come to his appointment \n24  because of CHOP, but decided that because he was in so much physical pain, he needed his therapy \n25  treatment. He parked near 11th Avenue for his appointment. He ended his appointment early, \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 26  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 27 of 65\n \n1  however, because he was concerned about a passing protest of CHOP participants. Upon returning \n2  to his car, he found that all four tires had been slashed by CHOP participants. He reported to Sage \n3  that, even though he suffers from pain and needs treatment, he would not attempt to come to future \n4  appointments because of CHOP. \n5  108.  Adding to Sageโs difficulties, Sageโs internet cable was cut, and Sage was unable \n6  to schedule an appointment for a Wave Cable technician to come fix the internet access because \n7  of the presence of CHOP. This put Sage at imminent risk, as Sageโs security camerasโmuch \n8  needed under the current circumstancesโrequire internet access and were therefore inoperable.  \n9  109.  To date, Sage has lost considerable revenue from patient cancellations due to \n10  CHOP, which places considerable strain on a small business like Sage. Around 60% of patients \n11  canceled their appointments.  \n12  110.  Sage employs three physical therapists and one personal trainer. Their livelihoods \n13  were threatened by CHOP. Sageโs company motto is: โUnapologetically fighting for good.โ  All \n14  of its employees are supporters of Black Lives Matter and pride themselves on providing a place \n15  of inclusivity and respect. The City did not listen to their concerns.  \n16  111.  Sageโs owner wrote to Mayor Durkan to complain about the current situation, as \n17  well as the difficulties CHOP caused for many of Sageโs disabled clients. That letter reads: โMy \n18  business Sage Physical Therapy is located at the corner of 12th Ave & E. Olive St within the \n19  CHAZ footprint. I have patients that live in the CHAZ neighborhood that are on crutches due to \n20  their injuries. They need physical therapy but they canโt get to my office because they canโt \n21  navigate the barricades. The sidewalks are blocked with heavy barricades. My patients arenโt able \n22  to access the disabled parking and loading zones because non-disabled people are parking there. \n23  People arenโt able to receive the care they deserve. The roads and sidewalks need to be cleared. I \n24  would like to remind you about the Americans with Disabilities Act. Blocking the road and \n25  sidewalk is against the ADA.

As a business owner, I feel abandoned by the city. This \n2  is unacceptable. The City of Seattle is violating ADA regulations.โ  The Mayor did not respond.  \n3  112.  Plaintiff Magdalena Sky (Tattoos and Fortune). Plaintiff Magdalena Sky is an \n4  activist and supporter of Black Lives Matter. Ms. Sky is the sole proprietor of Tattoos and Fortune. \n5  Ms. Sky is autistic and has worked tirelessly for years using her unique artistic skills to support \n6  and grow her business. Her business is her own safety net and primary source of income. CHOP \n7  ripped that business out from under her feet. \n8  113.  Like many other local businesses, Tattoos and Fortune is sinking because of the \n9  Cityโs support of CHOP. Ms. Skyโs tattoo and fortune telling services depend on regular client \n10  access to its Capitol Hill studio. Tattoo and Fortuneโs studio is within CHOP, which made client \n11  access impossible. The barricades and encampments blocked both vehicle and foot access to the \n12  studio, as well as delivery of vital business supplies, just as they blocked the roads, parking, \n13  doorways, and driveways of many local businesses. As a result, Ms. Sky was forced to close \n14  Tattoos and Fortuneโs doors. Without clients, Tattoos and Fortune cannot generate any revenue. \n15  In addition, Tattoos and Fortune suffered from the lack of trash service, access for emergency \n16  services, and police protection. Even if Ms. Skyโs clients had access to the studio, many were \n17  fearful to come because of CHOP. To reach her business, her clients would have had to cross \n18  barricades that CHOP participants set up, where they might be stopped, questioned, and/or \n19  harassed by CHOP participants, as others were. \n20  114.  Ms. Sky herself witnessed theft and looting from other local businesses and feared \n21  CHOP participants might steal and loot from her business, should she even try to open her studioโs \n22  doors. On one occasion, Ms. Sky was followed and harassed, like so many others have been due \n23  to the rise in harassment and sexual assault in the area since CHOP began. The fear of violence \n24  caused Ms. Sky stress, exacerbated by her autism. The City ignored her concerns, as with the \n25  mental health of many local residents and business owners. Her businessโher primary means of \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 28  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 29 of 65\n \n1  livelihoodโis losing all its revenue. Some of her clients may never return, as they canceled \n2  appointments and began seeking tattoo and fortune services elsewhere.  \n3  115.  Capitol Hill is a diverse neighborhood, known for its minority presence and as a \n4  center for Seattleโ LGBTQ residents. Many small business owners in the area are minority-owned \n5  and suffering loss of property and business from CHOP, just as Tattoos and Fortune is. The City \n6  and CHOP did not respond to concerns of small businesses like Ms. Skyโs Tattoos and Fortune. \n7  Ms. Sky, along with other local business owners, had no forum in which to voice her concerns and \n8  try to stem her businesses losses accruing each day CHOP and its aftereffects continue.  \n9  116.  Plaintiff Bergmanโs Lock and Key. Plaintiff Bergmanโs Lock and Key is a small \n10  business that has operated on Capitol Hill since 1956.  \n11  117.  Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs employees were not safe to come to work due to CHOP. \n12  Several on their way to or from work were followed by CHOP participants wielding baseball bats, \n13  who threatened them not to come into the area. To protect its property from CHOP participants, \n14  Bergmanโs Lock and Key was forced to board up its premises. Its building was tagged with graffiti \n15  and vandalized. Because CHOP became more dangerous as the days progressed, the company \n16  closed around 3:00 p.m., two and half hours before its normal 5:30 p.m. closing time.  \n17  118.  Bergmanโs Lock and Key is suffering financially. Its customers cannot access the \n18  store due to roadblocks, barricades, and lack of parking caused by the Cityโs support of CHOP. \n19  Other customers are simply too scared to come, because of Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs proximity \n20  to the CHOP zone. Customers called citing their fears and the company was forced to refer them \n21  to competitor businesses outside of the CHOP area. Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs revenues declined \n22  in June 2020 by 60% due to CHOP. Bergmanโs Lock and Key was able to continue working as an \n23  essential business during the COVID-19 shutdown, but CHOP stopped nearly all customers from \n24  coming in. Business deliveries and shipments were also routinely delayed. \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 29  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 30 of 65\n \n1  119.  The City actively supported CHOP participants near Bergmanโs Lock and Key. The \n2  City provided cleaning stations for CHOP participants, large stainless-steel sinks, and portable \n3  toilets. \n4  120.    Bergmanโs Lock and Key tried to complain to the City, but received no response.  \n5  121.  Plaintiff Matthew Ploszaj. Plaintiff Matthew Polszaj has lived for approximately 8 \n6  years in an apartment he leases at 1210 E. Pine Street. His residence was within CHOP, next to \n7  the Seattle Police Departmentโs East Precinct. \n8  122.  During the existence of CHOP, there were several times that Mr. Ploszaj was unable \n9  to access his apartment because of obstructions created by CHOP and CHOP participants. Those \n10  obstructions  included  people,  physical  barriers,  camping  tents,  festival  tents,  makeshift \n11  โstorefronts,โ and other structures on the streets and sidewalks around his apartment building. \n12  123.  Because of these obstructions and because he feared for his safety, Mr. Ploszaj was \n13  forced on several occasions during the existence of CHOP to leave the area and stay elsewhere in \n14  Seattle. \n15  124.  Mr. Ploszajโs apartment building was broken into four times during the existence \n16  of CHOP, even though it had never been broken into at any other time during his previous 8 years \n17  at that address.  The Seattle police were contacted each time the apartment was broken into, but \n18  the police did not respond on any of those occasions.  \n19  125.  On the evening of June 29, 2020, an apartment in Mr. Ploszajโs building was \n20  burglarized.  Mr. Ploszaj and his neighbor contacted the police after the burglary, at approximately \n21  10:30 p.m.  Police told them that they would not respond to the building because of its location \n22  within CHOP and requested that Mr. Ploszaj and his neighbor meet them at 20th and Madison \n23  (more than 8 blocks away) to make a report. One of the residents reported to that location. After \n24  an hour had passed since their initial phone call, no police had responded, and Mr. Ploszaj and his \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 30  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 31 of 65\n \n1  neighbor called police again.  They were able to make a report on the phone during this second \n2  phone call, but no officers responded to investigate. \n3  126.  On June 25, 2020, a CHOP participant climbed atop Mr. Ploszajโs building and \n4  threatened to kill himself. Mr. Ploszaj called 9-1-1 numerous times to seek assistance. He was \n5  asked whether he wanted to meet an officer somewhere outside CHOP because police would not \n6  respond to his address.  Mr. Ploszaj declined and continued to call 9-1-1 several times during the \n7  90 minutes that the individual was threatening suicide. The 9-1-1 operators thanked him for the \n8  updates but police never responded to assist. \n9  127.  Plaintiff Argento LLC.  Plaintiff Argento owns and operates Cafรฉ Argento.  Argento \n10  suffered lost income and business because of CHOP. During the existence of CHOP, the presence \n11  of numerous CHOP participants wielding guns forced Argento to open later and close earlier \n12  because of concerns for the safety of Argento employees and customers. \n13  128.  Argento customers were also unable to access the cafรฉ, or were reluctant to come \n14  to the cafรฉ, during the existence of CHOP, because of the numerous blockades and other obstacles \n15  on the public streets and sidewalks outside the cafรฉ. Customers and employees were also harassed \n16  on public streets and sidewalks by CHOP participants, and employees were often too afraid to \n17  come to work. \n18  129.  Access to the cafรฉ for the disabled was especially difficult because of the numerous \n19  blockades and other obstacles placed and created by CHOP participants. Argentoโs owner, Faizel \n20  Khan, contacted the Seattle Department of Transportation about the inaccessibility for disabled \n21  persons, but the Department of Transportation did nothing to help improve the access. \n22  130.  CHOP participants frequently came into the cafรฉ in order to pressure Mr. Kahn and \n23  his employees to support the political views of CHOP and CHOP participants. \n24  131.  CHOP participants regularly demanded to use the cafรฉ restrooms and often refused \n25  to leave, and on occasion left behind used needles in the bathroom. \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 31  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 32 of 65\n \n1  132.  Mr.  Kahn  called  9-1-1  four  times  regarding  incidents  at  the  cafรฉ  during  the \n2  existence of CHOP, but he was told that police would not respond to his area unless there was a \n3  violent incident. \n4  133.  CHOP participants regularly deposited human waste and other waste on and in the \n5  streets, sidewalks, buses, patios, doorways, and other areas around Cafรฉ Argento. \n6  134.  During the existence of CHOP, Argento was unable to use City services for trash \n7  and recycling, and could not receive package deliveries from UPS, Federal Express, or Amazon. \n8  135.  Plaintiff Onyx HOA. Plaintiff Onyx HOA is an association of Capitol Hill residents \n9  and condo owners in the Onyx Condominium building. The HOA and its residents suffered harm \n10  from CHOP. The Onyx Condominiumโs residents felt unsafe and were constantly barraged by \n11  excessive noise, fireworks, and other nuisances. The building was subject to graffiti and other acts \n12  of vandalism at the hands of CHOP participants. The HOA and its residents called 9-1-1, but \n13  received no response or direction from the City. The HOAโs insurer threatened to raise rates and \n14  premiums if CHOP was not disbanded. Tenants made plans to leave, threatening the funding of \n15  the HOA. All tenants have lost value in terms of property values as a direct result of the Cityโs \n16  support of CHOP. \n17  136.  The  Onyx  Condominiums  are  on  the  border  of  CHOP.  As  a  result,  Onyx \n18  Condominium residentsโ access to their own homes was impeded, due to barricades on the public \n19  streets. For example, the president of Onyx HOA, individual Plaintiff Wade Biller, was stopped \n20  by CHOP participants at the barricades and told he was not allowed to drive through. He was \n21  stopped by a CHOP participant while trying to drive down 12th Avenue to access his home. At \n22  other times, so-called โsecurityโ for CHOP came to the barricades and offered to escort him into \n23  the area to access his home so that CHOP participants would not vandalize his car.    \n24  137.  CHOP participants stole an expensive compact dumpster bin belonging to Onyx \n25  HOA. Onyx HOAโs president, Mr. Biller, demanded the bin back, but CHOP participants refused \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 32  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 33 of 65\n \n1  to return it. During negotiations for return of the bin, Mr. Biller was assaulted by a CHOP \n2  participant who violently kicked him in the back as he tried to leave the scene. The HOA president \n3  called the police, but the police did not respond to the incident of battery and assault for more than \n4  90 minutes, by which point the perpetrator was long gone. Eventually, when CHOP participants \n5  had access to City-owned barricades to encircle CHOP, the compactor bin was returned.    \n6  138.  Onyx HOA was forced to hire additional security to protect the property and its \n7  residents from the CHOP participants. At any time, two to four armed guards had to be present, as \n8  some CHOP participants in the area were violent and armed with guns. The HOAโs residents lived \n9  under constant fear and threat to their wellbeing and property.  \n10  139.  Mr. Biller, in his capacity as Onyx HOAโs president, wrote to Mayor Durkan on \n11  June 11, 2020, about the plight of the buildingโs residents. He wrote: โWe are fending for ourselves \n12  as residents and businesses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. We have had to hire private security \n13  to help keep tabs on the escalating issues . . . . I ask that you take a strong stance and allow the \n14  police to reclaim our streets for the residents who live here and donโt [want] to become part of this \n15  anti-police and anti-government movement.โ  Mayor Durkan did not respond or provide any \n16  opportunity to challenge the Cityโs policies supporting the occupation of the CHOP area.   \n17  140.  In the early morning hours of June 29, bullets were shot into the Onyx building, \n18  with at least one coming within a foot of a resident asleep in bed.   \n19  141.  Madrona Real Estate Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs Madrona Real Estate Services, Madrona \n20  Real Estate Investors IV, Madrona Real Estate Investors VI, and 12th and Pike Associates LLC \n21  (collectively โMadrona Real Estateโ) suffered economic loss from CHOP, including in the form \n22  of reduced rents, property damage, and a decline in property values. Their tenantsโCapitol Hillโs \n23  local residents and businessesโwere also harmed and harassed.  \n24  142.  Madrona Real Estate owns and/or manages multiple residential and commercial \n25  buildings on Capitol Hill in and around CHOP. The presence of CHOP greatly reduced the value \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 33  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 34 of 65\n \n1  or property in what was, until recently, one of the most popular and expensive neighborhoods in \n2  Seattle.   \n3  143.  A resident in a building managed by Madrona Real Estate recently called 9-1-1 to \n4  respond to an incident of violence near Madrona Real Estateโs building at 1414 12th Avenue. The \n5  resident had witnessed from her condoโs patio a fight in the street occurring at or near the \n6  intersection of 12th Avenue and Union. The resident saw what appeared to be a man and a woman \n7  fighting over a child, causing the woman to run into a nearby building and barricading the door to \n8  block the assaulting man. The resident called 9-1-1, who took her name and number. She waited \n9  for hours, but police never responded to the incident or called her back. This is just one example \n10  of the lawlessness the City enabled in the area. The same resident normally walked her dog in the \n11  neighborhood, but was hesitant to leave her residence. She witnessed CHOP participants openly \n12  doing hard drugs on the street around her building with impunity due to the lack of any SPD \n13  presence.   \n14  144.  The same building at 1414 12th Avenue managed and owned by Madrona Real \n15  Estate was broken into.  It was vandalized in various ways, including by pulling out pipes.  In one \n16  instance, the fire alarm was activated, which set off the sprinkler system (causing evacuation of \n17  the buildingโs over 100 residents and causing flooding in the building garage). Residents also \n18  reported that boxes and other items were stolen. During the CHOP occupation, an individual \n19  trespassed on the property and defecated in buildingโs lobby.  \n20  145.  At other locations in the area, Madrona Real Estateโs residents reported that their \n21  condos were broken into or burglarized by CHOP participants. CHOP participants harassed \n22  residents, vandalized the Madrona Real Estateโs property, and left human feces on multiple \n23  premises.  \n24  146.  SPD refused to help Madrona Real Estate protect private property or otherwise to \n25  help address these problems. At considerable expense, Madrona Real had to hire increased private \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 34  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 35 of 65\n \n1  security to protect its residents and property. At the building where the fire system was vandalized, \n2  Madrona Real Estate incurred considerable expense in fixing the damage to property and had to \n3  pay for a fire watch to be instituted.  \n4  147.  On the morning of June 23, 2020, one of Madrona Real Estateโs commercial \n5  tenants, a restaurant located at 12th Avenue and Pike Street, near but not directly in the CHOP \n6  blockaded area, was attempting to access its location in an effort to try to reopen. However, the \n7  entrances and stoop area in front of the restaurant were entirely blocked by an encampment erected \n8  by a CHOP participant. The tenant called the police, asking for assistance in removing trespassers \n9  from its private property, so that it could access and open the property. The police said that they \n10  would not respond because they โare not allowed to come within two blocks of CHOPโ.   \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n148.  Clearly, the Cityโs refusal to even respond to assaults in the neighborhood, let alone \n24 \ntake any measures to ensure public order and access, detracted from the areaโs desirability for \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 35  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 36 of 65\n \n1  current and potential residents and businesses. At a new property Madrona Real Estate has opened \n2  in the area with 45 residential units, only 3 have been leased. Up until the emergence of CHOP the \n3  area was among the trendiest location for residents, but, since the emergence of CHOP, Madrona \n4  Real Estate has suddenly had no interest in the 42 unleased units, because no one is interested in \n5  moving to the area.  \n6  149.  Madrona Real Estateโs residents and tenants face other hardships as well. Many of \n7  the areaโs millennial residents regularly shop online, but, according to Madrona Real Estateโs \n8  residents and tenants, Amazon would not deliver packages in area, due the barricaded streets and \n9  presence of CHOP participants. The inability to purchase or ship through Amazon is even more \n10  acutely felt in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people rely on deliveries to safely \n11  deliver food, medicine, and other essential items.   \n12  150.  Most of Madrona Real Estateโs commercial tenants wanted to open but were unable \n13  to do so, because they were fearful of CHOP, had no way of attracting customers, and/or could not \n14  be accessed due to blocked streets. Unable to generate revenue, many of these tenants asked \n15  Madrona Real Estate for rent relief. Many are small, locally owned stores. Madrona Real Estate \n16  has been giving concessions in the form of free rent, resulting in economic loss, but even so many \n17  of the small commercial tenants are still facing bankruptcy.  \n18  151.  The  Cityโs  policies  with  respect  to  CHOP  have  resulted  in  other  sources  of \n19  economic loss to Madrona Real Estate. For example, Madrona Real Estate operates a parking \n20  garage near CHOP. But, since the occupation of the CHOP area started, nearly no one is coming \n21  to the area to shop or dine. Parking revenue in June 2020 was only a small fraction of the average.   \n22  152.  Madrona Real Estate complained to the City and even sent a letter to Mayor \n23  Durkan. Mayor Durkan did not respond or acknowledge the plight of the many residents of \n24  Madrona Real Estate services, let alone provide any recourse to challenge the Cityโs policies and \n25  conduct.    \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 36  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 37 of 65\n \n1  153.  Plaintiff Hunters Capital. Plaintiff Hunters Capital is a real-estate company that \n2  owns or manages multiple residential, commercial, and mixed-use buildings on Capitol Hill in and \n3  around CHOP. Like Madrona Real Estate, the presence of CHOP is causing economic injury to \n4  Hunters Capital, including loss of revenue, damage to property, and decline in property value. \n5  Hunters Capital has recently had investors back out of Capitol Hill development projects, citing \n6  CHOP as the reason to withdraw. Every day the City supported the ongoing occupation of CHOP, \n7  Hunters Capital incurred further irreparable harm.  \n8  154.  Hunters  Capital  property  and  employees  were  also  threatened  by  CHOP \n9  participants. For example, a Hunters Capital maintenance employee was recently attempting to \n10  clean up CHOP graffiti at a Hunters Capital building located near 10th Avenue and Pike Street at \n11  around 7:00 am in the morning. As he started to paint over the graffiti, the worker was accosted \n12  by a group of CHOP participants. The participants ordered him to stop removing the graffiti and \n13  threatened to burn the building down if he did not comply. Because of the threats, the maintenance \n14  worker left without painting over the graffiti, emotionally distraught due to the threats of violence \n15  and arson.   \n16  155.  Hunters  Capitalโs  residential  tenants  found  that  the  area  around  CHOP  was \n17  unlivable. For example, they reported numerous noise and safety concerns. Although the City has \n18  a noise ordinance, it was not enforced in and around CHOP. CHOP participants violated the \n19  ordinance late into every night, even setting off fireworks into the early hours of the morning. \n20  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants simply could not sleep and were deprived of their right to \n21  quiet enjoyment of their homes. Hunters Capital wrote to the City repeatedly, but the City did not \n22  respond to the concerns or provide any recourse or ability to challenge the Cityโs policies or \n23  conduct with respect to CHOP.  \n24  156.  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants also reported concern for their physical safety. \n25  Many who used the local Cal Anderson Park for recreation or to walk their pets could not do so \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 37  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 38 of 65\n \n1  because of safety concerns and rampant public drug use. Incidents of assault and harassment \n2  occurred in the area. Hunters Capitalโs residents recently witnessed a peaceful individual forcefully \n3  removed from the area by CHOP mobs. Female renters in particular had reported concerns about \n4  their personal safety, in light of numerous reported instances of sexual assault within CHOP. Some \n5  residential tenants have threatened to break their leases at properties owned by Hunters Capital \n6  because of the extensive problems created by CHOP. \n7  157.  Hunters Capitalโs commercial tenants are also suffering. Many reported that they \n8  could not open, because they feared doing so would expose them to looting and arson. Many \n9  tenants witnessed assault, theft, and looting. These commercial tenants were forced by CHOP to \n10  close and board up their stores in order to protect them. Some commercial tenants physically could \n11  not open under any circumstances, as CHOP participants blocked store entrances, including by \n12  setting up residential areas for CHOP participants on public streets and sidewalks with tents. \n13  Hunters Capitalโs commercial tenants are struggling. Many are small businesses and storefronts \n14  that depend on visitors coming to Capitol Hill. Many currently cannot pay their rent as a direct \n15  consequence of CHOP and its aftereffects.  \n16  158.  Other Hunters Capital commercial tenants with office space in the area reported \n17  that they are and were unable to come to work at their office space, because of blocked access and \n18  fear of CHOP participants. Additionally, the commercial office tenants reported that the noise \n19  issues were so serious that they and their employees were unable to use their office space for work. \n20  Loud speeches and chanting at all hours of the day made normal working conditions impossible. \n21  The  vast  majority  of  Hunters  Capital  commercial-office  tenants  report  that  they  and  their \n22  employees were simply unable to come to work at all.  \n23  159.  Hunters Capitalโs tenants have already begun to leave because of CHOP, and others \n24  cannot  pay  rent.  Every  day  that  passes  more  of  the  companyโs  tenants  leave  the  area,  at \n25  considerable loss to Hunters Capital. Further, there has been no interest from prospective tenants. \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 38  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 39 of 65\n \n1  As long as CHOP and its aftereffects remain, nearly no one is interested in relocating to the Capitol \n2  Hill neighborhood. \n3  160.  Plaintiff Olive ST Apartments. Olive ST Apartments is another small business on \n4  Capitol Hill that struggled because of CHOP. Olive ST Apartments owns two apartment buildings \n5  close  to  Cal  Anderson  Park.  Previously  a  desirable  location  for  renters,  life  for  Olive  ST \n6  Apartmentsโ tenants became unlivable. The tenants were terrified by CHOP participants carrying \n7  guns, in addition to the rampant violence, harassment, and vandalism within CHOP. Olive ST \n8  Apartmentsโ owner was videotaped and harassed while trying to move a garbage dumpster several \n9  blocks outside of CHOP just so the garbage could get picked up.  \n10  161.  Due to safety concerns, Olive ST Apartments was forced to hire private security. \n11  Nevertheless, Olive ST Apartmentsโ buildings were covered with graffiti multiple times. The \n12  company tried cleaning the graffiti off, only for its buildings to be vandalized again. On several \n13  occasions, CHOP participants attempted to break into its buildings, once breaking the lock box for \n14  mail. Olive ST Apartments called the police, but the police told Olive ST Apartmentsโ security \n15  guard that they would not send anyone to the area.  \n16  162.  The noise, including from Cal Anderson Park, also made conditions for Olive ST \n17  Apartmentsโ tenants unlivable. The company received constant complaints about the noise at all \n18  times of day and night, including gun shots. Tenants left to avoid the noise.   \n19  163.  In addition to ceding the nearby Cal Anderson Park to CHOP, the City supported \n20  the CHOP participants near Olive ST Apartments by providing them with barricades, lights, toilets, \n21  handwashing stations, and fire extinguishers. The City allowed CHOP participants to use bright \n22  lights at Cal Anderson Park to facilitate CHOP activities there, causing a nuisance to Olive ST \n23  Apartmentsโ tenants.  \n24  164.  Given the unlivable conditions, it was impossible for the company to rent its \n25  apartments. Tenants moved out because of the nearby presence of CHOP. No new renters have \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 39  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 40 of 65\n \n1  interest in moving to the area. Each day CHOP and its aftereffects continue, Olive ST Apartments \n2  incurs further harm and economic loss.  \n3  165.  Plaintiff  Redside  Partners.  Plaintiff  Redside  Partners  performs  real-estate \n4  management services to buildings near CHOP. Its business has also been hurt by CHOP and its \n5  aftereffects. Redside Partners employees reported that they do not feel safe coming to work, as the \n6  companyโs offices are near Cal Anderson Park. The companyโs employees report widespread \n7  lawlessness, including vandalism, graffiti, and public drug use affecting the buildings the company \n8  manages. CHOP participants trespassed on Redside Partnersโs properties, including climbing up \n9  fire escapes to get on building roof tops. Redside Partners complained to the City but received no \n10  response.  \n11  166.  Capitol Hillโs real-estate companies like Plaintiffs Madrona Real Estate, Hunters \n12  Capital, and Redside Partners have invested millions of dollars over the years to turn Capitol Hill \n13  into a desirable location, with modern condos, restaurants, and shops. They have made investments \n14  in new, state-of-the-art buildings and the restoration of many historic buildings. Over the last \n15  several decades, they have helped transform Capitol Hill into one of the nationโs most vibrant and \n16  architecturally attractive neighborhoods, a diverse melting pot for both local residents as well as \n17  tourists, with the Cityโs best boutique shopping, dining, socializing, and urban living. It has \n18  fostered a livable community for many new residents and a superstructure for many thriving small \n19  businesses, which employ thousands of employees from a diverse set of backgrounds. The \n20  immense value and wealth this has created, for Plaintiffs, the Capitol Hill community, and Seattle \n21  more generally is actively being destroyed by the Cityโs actions. \n22  167.  Plaintiff Rancho Bravo. Rancho Bravo is a restaurant well-known for providing \n23  quality Mexican food at affordable prices. Its location on Capitol Hill is on 11th and Pine Street, in \n24  the center of what became CHOP. In the days following the SPDโs abandonment of the East \n25  Precinct, Rancho Bravoโs owner and others met with city officials, including the Fire Chief, and \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 40  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 41 of 65\n \n1  urged them to remove the barricades that had been left behind. They pointed out that, without the \n2  barricades, the CHOP participants could continue their protest activities but would not obstruct \n3  streets or hamper businesses. The next day, the City not only failed to remove the existing \n4  barricades which had been used by police during the protests, but the City also provided additional \n5  concrete barriers to CHOP participants to set up their โautonomous zoneโ to keep police and others \n6  out. \n7  168.  Also, after the Cityโs decision to abandon the East Precinct, CHOP participants, \n8  without asking Rancho Bravo, set up a makeshift medical center in the outside seating areas in \n9  front of the restaurant. This โmedic stationโ was in operation for weeks and obstructed customer \n10  access to seating.   \n11  169.  At one point during the occupancy, CHOP participants set up a vehicle and trailer \n12  blocking the northeast access point to the Rancho Bravo parking lot. The participants involved in \n13  placing these obstructions set up a food stand on the street near Rancho Bravo serving tacos, \n14  burritos, fruit, and other concessions. Rancho Bravoโs owner met with the owners of this food \n15  stand and asked if they had a permit. He was told that they had no permit but that the CHOP leaders \n16  had approved their activities. \n17  170.  During  the  CHOP  occupancy,  Rancho  Bravo  stayed  open,  believing  that  its \n18  property would be in greater danger had it abandoned the restaurant. Having seen the damage to \n19  other buildings in the area, Rancho Bravo was concerned that CHOP participants would vandalize \n20  or perhaps even burn down the Rancho Bravo building if it were abandoned. As it was, CHOP \n21  participants left extensive graffiti on and around the restaurant building.  Rancho Bravoโs business \n22  dropped precipitously during the occupancy, leading to significant economic losses.   \n23  171.  Plaintiff Sway and Cake. Sway and Cake is a clothing store located on 12th Street \n24  and Pike Street. Its storefront looked out on barricades placed by CHOP participants at the entrance \n25  to CHOP at that intersection. Sway and Cake had been closed due to the public health crisis and \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 41  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 42 of 65\n \n1  was preparing to re-open at the time the protests began. However, once SPD abandoned the East \n2  Precinct, and the City discontinued providing police and emergency services to the area, Sway and \n3  Cake had to board up its storefront and remain closed despite State orders permitting re-opening. \n4  The store feared the possibility of vandalism, arson, or other crimes. Also, the environment in the \n5  CHOP, according to the storeโs owner, was not conducive to her clientele; rather, it was completely \n6  lawless and dangerous. Sway and Cakeโs owner visited the store while CHOP was being occupied \n7  and, when approaching the barricades, would be asked by those guarding the barriers why she was \n8  entering the area.   \n9  172.  Plaintiff Shuffle LLC/Cure Cocktail. Cure Cocktail is a restaurant and bar with \n10  windows and a patio overlooking Cal Anderson Park from its location on Nagle Place.  Cure \n11  Cocktailโs business suffered dramatically once the CHOP occupation began. Access to Nagle Place \n12  was blocked by barricades, and the patio, rather than looking over the normally pleasant Cal \n13  Anderson Park, now provided a view of, among other things, armed CHOP participants and a tent \n14  city. Because of the notoriety of CHOP and the barricades, deliveries of inventory to Cure Cocktail \n15  were cancelled. Without police presence, the area was dangerous, and escalated in danger as crime, \n16  including shootings, became common. Potential customers no longer wanted to be near the \n17  restaurant or the area.  A once vibrant business, even during the health crisis through online orders, \n18  Cure Cocktailโs revenues declined dramatically. When interacting with Cure Cocktail personnel, \n19  CHOP participants would ask questions such as, โAre you for the CHOP or are you for the police?โ  \n20  Even though Cure Cocktail supports Black Lives Matter and other causes, it became fearful in its \n21  communications with the protestors over what might happen if they offended CHOP participants.  \n22  In some communications, they were threatened with โexposureโ over Instagram or other social \n23  media sites if they did not express support for specific causes.       \n24  D.  The City Actively Supported and Encouraged CHOP and CHOP Participants. \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 42  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 43 of 65\n \n1  173.  In the face of all this destruction, City leaders, including Mayor Durkan, embraced \n2  the existence, message, and methods of CHOP and CHOP Participants. They did this with physical \n3  support  and  extensive  verbal  support  and  encouragement  that  has  expressly  endorsed  the \n4  barricading and occupation of City streets and parks.   \n5  174.  Since the day that the City abandoned the East Precinct, the City had full knowledge \n6  of the problems created for businesses and residents in and around CHOP, including property \n7  damage, lack of police response, the inability for workers and residents to enter and leave the area, \n8  the  inability  for  businesses  to  receive  deliveries,  and  other  adverse  impacts  on  residents, \n9  businesses, and property owners in the area. The City nevertheless adopted a policy supporting the \n10  CHOP occupation, acting with deliberate indifference toward those suffering harms from it. \n11  Evidence of the Cityโs knowledge includes the following: \n12  a.  At a June 11, 2020 press conference with Mayor Durkan, Chief Best made \n13  it clear that the City was fully aware that its 9-1-1 response times had tripled and that \n14  there was a serious public-safety crisis for anyone who lives or works in CHOP. \n15  b.  On June 16, 2020, the City stated, via a press release from the Mayorโs \n16  office: \n \n17 \nBeginning last Tuesday, City officials have been on site on Capitol \nHill  to  work  [to]  meet  community  needs  including \n18 \nhygiene, sanitation and safety.  Utilities including  Puget  Sound \nEnergy and SPU have been able to respond to the area for service. \n19 \nSeattle Police Chief Carmen Best has visited the site multiple \n20  times. Over the past week, conversations continued between City \nofficials,  organizers  onsite  for  the  CHOP, residents and \n21  businesses. โฆ Every day, Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins, \nSeattle Department of Transportation Director Sam Zimbabwe, \n22  and Seattle Public Utilities General Manager Mami Hara have \nbeen  on  site.  On  Sunday,  they held  a  meeting with  onsite \n23 \norganizers, small businesses, and residents to discuss proposed \nchanges to the protest zone. \n24 \nc.  On information and belief, Mayor Durkan and the SPD have been inundated \n25 \nwith complaints about CHOP that describe in detail the extensive property damage, \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 43  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 44 of 65\n \n1  restricted access, and economic loss that residents, businesses, and property owners are \n2  suffering. \n3  d.  In  response  to  at  least  some  requests  from  desperate  businesses  and \n4  residents for her to cease her support of CHOP, Mayor Durkanโs office has provided a \n5  stock response acknowledging that the City is โmaintainingโ a space for CHOP, \n6  including by, for example, providing a โsturdier concrete barrierโ to help CHOP block \n7  a public street. The stock response states in part as follows: \n \n8 \nThank you for reaching out.  \n \n9 \nThe Capitol Hill Organized Protest has emerged as a gathering \nplace where community members can demand change of their \n10 \nlocal,  state,  and  federal  government.  Capitol  Hill  and  Cal \n11  Anderson Park have long been a gathering place for justice. While \nthere have been inaccurate and misleading depictions of the CHOP \n12  from the President and some national media, the City believes first \namendment activities can continue while also maintaining public \n13  safety  and  allowing  access  for  residents  and  businesses  who \noperate in the area. Mayor Durkan believes these changes can help \n14 \nensure any focus of the CHOP and Cal Anderson will allow for \npeaceful demonstrations to continue. \n15 \n  \nBeginning last Tuesday, City officials have been on site on Capitol \n16 \nHill  to  work  [to]  meet  community  needs  including  hygiene, \n17  sanitation and safety. Utilities including Puget Sound Energy and \nSPU have been able to respond to the area for service. Seattle \n18  Police Chief Carmen Best has visited the site multiple times. Over \nthe past week, conversations continued between City officials, \n19  organizers onsite for the CHOP, residents and businesses. The \nCity is committed to maintaining space for community to come to \n20 \ntogether, protest and exercise their first amendment rights. Minor \nchanges to the protest zone will implement safer and sturdier \n21 \nbarriers to protect individuals in this area, allow traffic to move \nthroughout  the  Capitol  Hill  neighborhood,  ease  access  for \n22 \nresidents of apartment building in the surrounding areas, and help \n23  local businesses manage deliveries and logistics. Additionally all \nplans have been crafted with the goal of allowing access for \n24  emergency personnel including fire trucks. \n \n25 \nEvery  day,  Seattle  Fire  Chief  Harold  Scoggins,  Seattle \nDepartment  of  Transportation  Director  Sam  Zimbabwe,  and \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 44  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 45 of 65\n \nSeattle Public Utilities General Manager Marni Hara have been on \n1 \nsite. On Sunday, they held a meeting with onsite organizers, small \nbusinesses,  and  residents  to  discuss  proposed  changes  to  the \n2 \nprotest zone. In coordination with protesters onsite, work began at \n6:30 a.m. on Tuesday to remove a tent barrier at 10th and Pine and \n3 \nreplace it with a sturdier concrete barrier to improve public safety. \n4  The  City  has  successfully  worked  with  protesters  onsite  to \nreconfigure the CHOP to allow for public safety and better access \n5  for  the  local  community.  That  has  involved  rerouting  traffic, \nfreeing up alley access, opened streets, and replacing makeshift \n6  barriers with heavy concrete barriers that can be painted.  \n7 \n8  e.  In addition to the numerous City officers listed above, Mayor Durkan \n9  herself has personally visited CHOP and has seen what is happening. In an interview given \n10  in her City offices on Facebook Live on June 12, 2020, Mayor Durkan made clear that she \n11  had seen the barriers and talked to CHOP participants and apparently approved of them \n12  using an individual with behavioral health issues to enforce the perimeter: โItโs interesting, \n13  when I was at the CHAZ, walking around, similar kind of philosophy, because thereโs this \n14  one guy, some behavioral health issues, and it was like, look, he has some hard times, and \n15  he helps on that barricade over there, and then when he starts having a hard time, we just \n16  bring him over here, take care of him, feed him. And thatโs what you gotta do, right?โ3 \n17  f.  On June 22, 2020, Mayor Durkan stated at a press conference: \n \n18 \nOver the days, tens of thousands of people have peacefully gathered \nor visited Capitol Hill. During the day, there have been no major \n19 \nincidents. But we know it is very different at night, particularly in \nrecent nights.

Most of \nthem supported protestersโ right to gather at the outset. They stand \n2 \nwith them in solidarity. But the impacts have increased, and the \nsafety has decreased. Both on Saturday morning and last night there \n3 \nwere  incidents  of  gun  violence.  And  that  escalating  violence \n4  concerns me, Chief Best,  residents,  businesses, and the greater \ncommunity. All of Capitol Hill has been impacted.  \n5 \n6  g.  At the same June 22, 2020 press conference, Chief Best stated that reports \n7  to the police demonstrate that some CHOP participants are โengaging in shootings, a rape, \n8  assaults, burglary, arson, and property destruction, and I have their police reports right here. \n9  Iโm not making it up. These things have happened.โ \n10  h.  At a press conference on June 29, 2020, the morning after yet another fatal \n11  shooting in the CHOP area, Chief Best repeatedly emphasized how dangerous the situation \n12  is within CHOP, stating:  \n \n13 \n[I]tโs very unfortunate that we have yet another murder in this area \nidentified as the CHOP. Two African American men dead at a place \n14 \nwhere they claim to be working for Black Lives Matter. But theyโre \n15  gone. Theyโre dead now. And weโve had multiple other incidents โ \nassaults, rape, robbery, and shootings. And so, you know, this is \n16  something that is going to need to change. Weโre asking people to \nremove themselves from this area for the safety of the people. If they \n17  care about people, theyโre gonna have to try to help us to make it \nsafe. Not opposed to anybodyโs issue or concern. They certainly can \n18 \ndemonstrate, you know, and peacefully any place, but they canโt \nhostilely take over a neighborhood and cause the crime levels to go \n19 \nup like this. Two men are dead. Two men are dead. And a child, a \n14-year-old,  is  hospitalized  and  we  donโt  know  what  is  gonna \n20 \nhappen to that kid.  \n21   \nโฆ \n22   \nYou know, at this point, the East Precinct, while important to us, \n23  whatโs much more important is that this neighborhood is not under \nsiege and that there are not people being victimized. You know, the \n24 \nprecinct is a building. The precinct is a building. But people dying, \nrapes, robbery, assault โ that is what we need to deal with.

The extent of the Cityโs knowledge of what was going on in CHOP is demonstrated \n10  by the following from Mayor Durkanโs emergency order that went into effect on July 1, 2020: \n11   \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 48  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 49 of 65\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24   \n25   \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 49  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 50 of 65\n \n1  176.  Despite having knowledge of exactly what was happening at CHOP by being there \n2  every day and in apparently constant contact with area residents and business owners, the City \n3  acted with deliberate indifference toward the safety and property interests of those residents and \n4  businesses.  \n5  177.  The City also enabled the blocking of ingress and egress for businesses and \n6  residents in the area, without providing plaintiffs any notice of this deprivation or opportunity to \n7  be  heard  on  the  matter.  Reportedly,  the  City  reached  an  informal  agreement  with  CHOP \n8  participants to allow limited one-way access on Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues starting on June \n9  16, 2020 (Plaintiffs were not invited to participate in these negotiations). However, as part of that \n10  agreement, the City actually fortified the rest of CHOP with new barriers (again without providing \n11  Plaintiffs notice or an opportunity to be heard on the matter). And even the planned limited access \n12  for  some  streets  almost  immediately  broke  down  when  CHOP  participants  reestablished \n13  impediments. The Cityโs response to this was apparently to do nothing. \n14  178.  At the same time that the City has acted with deliberate indifference to property \n15  owners and people who live and work in and near CHOP, the City physically aided, endorsed, and \n16  actively encouraged CHOP participants to continue their occupation of public spaces. \n17  179.  The City physically aided CHOP participants in their occupation of the area in at \n18  least the following ways: \n19  a.  When the City abandoned the East Precinct on June 8, 2020, it left behind \n20  the barriers that had previously blocked street access and protected the East Precinct from \n21  protesters. These barriers foreseeably served as the raw materials that allowed CHOP \n22  participants to block streets and create CHOP within a very short time. \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 50  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 51 of 65\n \n1  b.  On June 16, 2020, the City provided even more concrete barriers to CHOP \n2  participants so that CHOP participants could replace wooden barriers and fortify their \n3  blockages of streets.4 \n4  c.  The City provided portable toilets and wash stations for CHOP participants. \n5  d.  The  City  has  provided  medical  equipment,  including  beds  and  other \n6  supplies, to the CHOP โmedical tent.โ \n7  e.  The City provided nighttime lighting at Cal Anderson Park. \n8  180.  As the City admitted in Mayor Durkanโs July 1, 2020 emergency order, the City \n9  โfacilitatedโ CHOP by:  \n10  โ*  Providing basic hygiene, water, litter, and garbage removal. \n11  *  Temporarily allowing obstructions of public parks, streets, and sidewalks \n12  *  Modifying SPD and SFD response protocolsโฆ. \n13  *  Modifying streets and pedestrian access routes. \n14  *  Providing social services outreach and engagementโฆ. \n15  *  Facilitating  modified  city  services  delivery  to  local  residents  and  businesses \n16  impacted by events in this area.โ \n17  181.  The Cityโs policies effectively authorized the actions of the CHOP participants. The \n18  City communicated clearly to CHOP participants that they may indefinitely continue occupying \n19  the streets in the area, maintaining their barricades, and blocking traffic, all without interference \n20  from the City. The City has communicated this message in at least the following ways: \n21  a.  On June 11, 2020, during a joint press conference with the Chief of Police, \n22  Mayor Durkan stated: โThereโs not a specific date โฆ because we are trying to do things \n23  that are responsible.โ \n24 \n25 \n \n4 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 51  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 52 of 65\n \n1  b.  On June 12, 2020, in response to a direct question from CNNโs Chris \n2  Cuomo about how long the City would allow CHOP participants to continue to occupy the \n3  neighborhood, Mayor Durkan responded, โI donโt know. We could have the Summer of \n4  Love.โ \n5  c.  On June 16, 2020, the City announced through an official statement from \n6  Mayor Durkan that it had negotiated with CHOP participants to adjust some but not all \n7  their barriers to allow  one-way traffic on Twelfth Avenue.5 This agreement was an \n8  endorsement  of  CHOP  participantsโ  other  barriers  and  its  overall  occupation  of  the \n9  neighborhood. \n10  d.  In announcing the supposed opening of a one-way corridor, the City made \n11  clear in a statement from the Mayor that it was an active participant in maintaining and \n12  solidifying CHOP barriers and boundaries:   \n \n13 \nThe City is committed to maintaining space for community to come \ntogether, protest and exercise their first amendment rights. Minor \n14 \nchanges to  the protest  zone  will implement  safer  and sturdier \nbarriers to protect individuals in this area, allow traffic to move \n15 \nthroughout the Capitol Hill neighborhood, ease access for residents \n16  of apartment building in the surrounding areas, and help local \nbusinesses manage deliveries and logistics. [emphasis added]6 \n17 \ne.  Also on June 16, 2020, Mayor Durkan suggested that the City agreed that \n18 \npolice officers will only enter the occupied area for โsignificant life-safety issues.โ7  \n19 \nf.  On  June  22,  2020,  Mayor  Durkan  and  Chief  Best  held  a  joint  press \n20 \nconference in which they expressed concern about the impacts of CHOP but also indicated \n21 \nat that time there was no specific timeline or plan for lessening those impacts or removing \n22 \nthe blockades, barriers, and tents from CHOP. \n23 \n24 \n \n25  5 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n6 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n7 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 52  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 53 of 65\n \n1  182.  The City also made numerous statements indicating that it endorsed and would \n2  continue to support what CHOP participants were doing in the area, thereby ensuring the continued \n3  and indefinite occupation and blockading of the neighborhood, and all the damage it has caused \n4  and will cause. The Cityโs statements include at least the following: \n5  a.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan posted following on her Twitter page: \n6  โThe Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone #CHAZ is not a lawless wasteland of anarchist \n7  insurrection โ it is a peaceful expression of our communityโs collective grief and their \n8  desire to build a better world.โ \n9  b.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan also posted on her Twitter page: โFor the \n10  thousands of individuals who have been on Capitol Hill, I think youโve seen what Iโve \n11  seen: the painting of Black Lives Matter along Pine Street, food trucks, spaghetti potlucks, \n12  teach-ins, and movies.โ \n13  c.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan stated during a joint press conference with \n14  the Chief of Police:   \n \n15 \nLawfully gathering and expressing first Amendment rights, and \ndemanding we do better as a society, and providing true equity for \n16 \ncommunities of color, is not terrorism. It is patriotism. The right to \nchallenge government and authority is fundamental to who we are \n17 \nas Americans. โฆ And for the thousands of individuals whoโve been \n18  on Capitol Hill, many of them, what youโll see is a painting of \nBlack  Lives  Matter  along  Pine  Street.  Food  trucks,  spaghetti \n19  potlucks, teach-ins, movies, free granola bars . . . . \n20  d.  During the same press conference on June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan also \n21  stated: \nThe Capitol Hill areaโin fact, some of my family is up there right \n22  nowโโฆ it is not an armed ANTIFA militia no-go zone. It is, a \nnumber of people are there, weโve had ongoing communications \n23 \nwith them, with the businesses, with the residents, and we will \nmake sure that we find some way for people to continue to protest \n24 \npeacefully while also getting ingress and egress. Weโve had blocks \nof Seattle in Capitol Hill shut down every summer for everything \n25 \nfrom Block Party to Pride. This is not really that much of an \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 53  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 54 of 65\n \noperational challenge. But we want to make sure that the businesses \n1 \nand residents feel safe and weโll continue to move that forward. \n2 \n3  e.  During her Facebook Live interview, Mayor Durkan also stated โI was up \n4  there today, walking around, talking to people, and I think we just have to continue to \n5  listen to people and figure out a way that thereโs still a way for people to have that kind \n6  of free expression, but we need to open up the streets, too, at least 12th so we can get \n7  fire through, and like that, so weโre going to keep talking to people and listening to \n8  them. But I heard a lot of great ideas and I heard a lot of community strength there. \n9  That was cool.โ \n10  f.  Also on June 12, 2020, during her interview with CNNโs Chris Cuomo, \n11  Mayor Durkan said, โWeโve got four blocks in Seattle that just saw pictures of that is \n12  more like a block party atmosphere. Itโs not an armed takeover. Itโs not a military junta. \n13  We will โ we will make sure that we can restore this. But we have block parties and \n14  the like in this part of Seattle all the time. Itโs known for that.โ  \n15  g.  On June 12, 2020, Mayor Durkan endorsed the gardens being planted in Cal \n16  Anderson Park on Twitter: โEarlier today I visited the #CHAZ and met Marcus \n17  Henderson, the person behind the new community garden popping up in Cal Anderson \n18  Park. Read more about Marcus and the work thatโs gone into creating the gardens: \n19  thestanger.com/slog/2020/06/1.โ \n20  h.  Mayor Durkan also tweeted on June 12, 2020: โFor as long as I can \n21  remember, Capitol Hill has been autonomous โ itโs been a place where people go to \n22  express  themselves  freely.  Today  at  the  #CHAZ,  I  spoke  with  organizers  and \n23  community about how we can move forward and keep our communities safe, together.โ \n24 \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 54  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 55 of 65\n \n1  i.  Mayor Durkan tweeted on June 16, 2020: โThe #CHOP has emerged as a \n2  gathering place for community to demand change of their local, state, and federal \n3  government.โ \n4  j.  On June 19, 2020, Mayor Durkan officially declared that there was no \n5  longer a state of emergency in the City because โdemonstrations since that day have \n6  been and continue be largely peaceful.โ \n7  k.  On June 21, 2020, after two people were shot in CHOP and one of them \n8  died, Mayor Durkan issued a statement indicating that the City still had no plans to \n9  cease supporting CHOP and that the City was instead acting to work with and preserve \n10  CHOP. \n11  183.  The City changed its tone after it learned that this lawsuit would be filed, and \n12  especially after Plaintiffs filed their first complaint. This included finally clearing CHOP of \n13  barricades and CHOP participants on July 1, 2020, in the face of an impending motion for a \n14  temporary restraining order. But the Cityโs earlier assistance and endorsement of CHOP and \n15  CHOP participants caused, and continue to cause, harm to Plaintiffs and the Class that would not \n16  have occurred absent the Cityโs actions. \n17  184.  The clearing of the area on July 1, 2020, was easily and accomplished without \n18  violence on either side, demonstrating that the City could have and should have cleared the area \n19  far earlier. \n20  V.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n21  185.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of similarly situated persons pursuant to Fed. R. \n22  Civ. Proc. 23(b)(2) and/or 23(b)(3). \n23  186.  The Class is hereby defined as follows: All persons or entities who own property \n24  in, have a business in, or reside in the area in the City of Seattle bounded by the following streets: \n25  Denny Way, Union Street, Thirteenth Avenue, and East Broadway. This definition excludes the \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 55  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 56 of 65\n \n1  City of Seattle and any departments or agencies of the City of Seattle, including the Seattle Police \n2  Department. \n3  187.  The definition of the Class is unambiguous. Plaintiffs are members of the Class, \n4  and all members of the Class can be identified through public records and notified by mail or other \n5  means of notification. \n6  188.  The number of Class members makes joinder impractical. Plaintiffs do not know \n7  the exact number of members in the Class, but believe the total number of businesses, residents, \n8  and property owners in the Class to be in the thousands. \n9  189.  There  are  numerous  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  Class  that \n10  predominate over any individual issues. These issues include the following: \n11  a.  Whether the City has participated in, endorsed, or encouraged the creation, \n12  maintenance, and continued existence of CHOP. \n13  b.  All facts regarding the existence and maintenance of CHOP including at least \n14  the following: \n15  i.  The boundaries and nature of the SPDโs โno-goโ zone in and \n16  around CHOP. \n17  ii.  All  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  the  Cityโs \n18  participation in, endorsement of, or encouragement of the \n19  creation, maintenance, and continued existence of CHOP. \n20  iii.  The nature and scope of activities of CHOP participants. \n21  c.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class have legally protected constitutional property \n22  rights. \n23  d.  Whether the City has infringed on those property rights by its actions with \n24  regard to CHOP. \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 56  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 57 of 65\n \n1  e.  Whether the City was required to provide notice and a hearing to Class \n2  members before infringing on those property rights. \n3  f.  Whether CHOP and CHOP participants are a nuisance within the meaning of \n4  RCW 7.48.010, et seq. \n5  g.  Whether the City has participated in the maintenance of that nuisance. \n6  h.  Whether the City has acted with deliberate indifference toward Plaintiffs and \n7  the Class. \n8  i.  Whether the harm suffered by Plaintiffs and the Class was foreseeable and \n9  obvious. \n10  j.  Whether the Cityโs actions constitute an unlawful gift within the meaning of \n11  the Washington Constitution. \n12  k.  Whether  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  have  suffered  a  taking  without  just \n13  compensation. \n14  l.  Whether  the  City  has  treated  the  Class  differently  from  others  similarly \n15  situated  in  violation  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \n16  Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n17  m. Whether the Cityโs actions were pursuant to a City policy. \n18  n.  Whether the Cityโs actions were ratified by a City policymaker.  \n19  o.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to injunctive relief. \n20  190.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the members of the Class. All Plaintiffs \n21  reside in the Class and have been subject to the same course of conduct by the City. \n22  191.  The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the Class. Plaintiffs are all \n23  members of the Class and have there are no conflicts between Plaintiffs and other Class members. \n24  Plaintiffs are well-informed as to the nature of this case and the claims against the City and have \n25  retained competent and experienced counsel that intend to prosecute this action vigorously. \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 57  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 58 of 65\n \n1  192.  The City has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to all Plaintiffs \n2  and the Class such that injunctive relief is appropriate respecting the Class as a whole. \n3  193.  The issues that Class members have in common predominate over any individual \n4  issues. The City engaged in a common course of conduct giving rise to the harms suffered by \n5  Plaintiffs and the Class. A single, common policy is at issue in this case. Individual questions, if \n6  any, pale by comparison to the numerous common questions that dominate. The injuries sustained \n7  by the Class members flow, in each instance, from a common nucleus of operative facts. \n8  194.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \n9  adjudication of this controversy because joinder of all class members is impracticable. The \n10  prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would impose heavy burdens \n11  upon the courts and the City and would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications of the \n12  questions of law and fact common to the Class. A class action would achieve substantial economies \n13  of time, effort, and expense, and would assure uniformity of decision as to persons similarly \n14  situated without sacrificing procedural fairness. Individual litigation of the legal and factual issues \n15  raised by the conduct of the City would increase delay and expense to all parties and to the court \n16  system. The class action device presents far fewer management difficulties and provides the \n17  benefits of a single, uniform adjudication, economies of scale and comprehensive supervision by \n18  a single court. Given the similar nature of the claims of the members of the Class and the uniform \n19  application of Washington and federal law to the claims of Plaintiffs and the members of the Class, \n20  the Classโs claims can and will be most effectively managed by a class action. \n21  VI.

Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint as if set forth herein. \n2  196.  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  have  constitutionally  protected  property  interests,  as \n3  defined by Washington state law, to exclude others from their property, to the use and quiet \n4  enjoyment of their property, and to access their property via public rights-of-way.  \n5  197.  The City has infringed on those constitutionally protected interests, including by \n6  (1) creating, assisting, endorsing, and encouraging an indefinite, unpermitted occupation and \n7  blockade of the public streets, sidewalks, and parks in and around CHOP, thereby denying \n8  Plaintiffs access to their properties, and (2) creating, assisting, endorsing, and encouraging the \n9  pervasive vandalism and trespasses against Plaintiffsโ properties, thereby denying Plaintiffs the \n10  ability to use their properties and exclude others from them.  \n11  198.  Plaintiffs and the Class also have constitutionally protected liberty interests in the \n12  fundamental right of free movement and the right to remain in a public place of oneโs choosing.     \n13  199.  The City has infringed on those constitutionally protected liberty interests through \n14  its CHOP policies, including by, among other conduct as alleged throughout this Complaint, \n15  granting de facto autonomy over the CHOP area to the CHOP participants and allowing them to \n16  determine who could and could not travel through and within the CHOP area.   \n17  200.  The City has infringed on Plaintiffsโ constitutionally protected interests without \n18  providing Plaintiffs with any due process before depriving them of these interests, or providing \n19  any recourse following the deprivation of the interests. In particular, the City provided Plaintiffs \n20  with no notice or opportunity to be heard before or after depriving Plaintiffs of the freedom of \n21  movement, the right to access their properties, the right to use their properties, and the right to \n22  exclude others from their properties,  \n23  201.  The City has done so pursuant to City policy as created, ratified, and authorized by \n24  City policymakers, including Mayor Durkan, without any notice to Plaintiffs or opportunity for \n25  them to be heard.  \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 59  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 60 of 65\n \n1  202.  As a direct result of the Cityโs actions, Plaintiffs and the Class have been denied \n2  regular and customary use of, access to, and enjoyment of their property, including the ability to \n3  drive or park in CHOP, the ability to walk to their homes or business without obstruction, the \n4  ability to accept deliveries to their homes or business, the ability to prevent and remedy vandalism, \n5  the ability to prevent trespasses and theft against their properties, the ability to freely move about, \n6  and the ability to remain in a public place of oneโs choosing.  \n7  203.  Plaintiffs and the Class have been harmed by this deprivation, including through \n8  loss of revenue, loss of property value, damages to property, and other damages.  \n9  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION โ SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n10  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n11  U.S. Const. amend XIV ยง 1 \n12  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n13  204.

Plaintiffs have a right pursuant to substantive due process to be protected from \n16  state-created dangers. \n17  206.  The Cityโs actions, assistance, endorsements, and encouragements of CHOP and \n18  CHOP participants greatly increased the likelihood of property damage, loss of business revenue \n19  and rental income, personal injury, loss of use of property, and other damages to Plaintiffs. This \n20  subjected Plaintiffs and the Class to harm that they not would have suffered absent the Cityโs \n21  actions. \n22  207.  All  damages  suffered,  and  still  to  be  suffered,  by  Plaintiffs  were  and  are \n23  foreseeable, known, and obvious.  \n24  208.  The City acted with deliberate indifference to the known and obvious harm that \n25  would be suffered by Plaintiffs. \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 60  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 61 of 65\n \n1  209.

V, XIV \n6  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n7  210.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint. \n8  211.  Plaintiffs and the Class have constitutionally protected property rights to use and \n9  enjoy their properties, to exclude others from their properties, and to access their properties via \n10  public rights-of-way.  \n11  212.  The City deprived Plaintiffs of those rights by affirmatively creating, assisting, \n12  endorsing, and encouraging an indefinite, unpermitted invasion, occupation, and blockade of the \n13  public rights-of-way that provide access to Plaintiffsโ private properties, as well as by affirmatively \n14  creating,  assisting,  endorsing,  and  encouraging  the  physical  invasion  of  Plaintiffsโ  private \n15  properties by CHOP participants.  \n16  213.  The City did so pursuant to City policy as created and ratified by City policymakers, \n17  including Mayor Durkan. \n18  214.  Plaintiffs have not received compensation for the deprivation of their property \n19  rights. \n20  215.  The Cityโs actions constitute an unlawful taking for private use and/or an unlawful \n21  taking for public use without just compensation, which has caused Plaintiffs economic harm, \n22  including through a loss of property value, loss of business revenue, and a loss of investment-\n23  backed expectations. \n   \n24 \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 61  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 62 of 65\n \n1  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION โ EQUAL PROTECTION \n2  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n3  U.S. Const. amend. XIV ยง 1 \n4  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n5  216.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint. \n6  217.  The City repeatedly expressed support for and endorsed the political message of \n7  the CHOP participants, which includes calls for autonomy from City services like the police.   \n8  218.  To further promote the political viewpoints of the CHOP participants, the City \n9  endorsed the actions of the CHOP participants and provided support for the CHOP participants to \n10  occupy the streets, sidewalks, and other public and private spaces throughout the CHOP area, even \n11  though the CHOP participants lacked the permit that the Cityโs Municipal Code requires for events \n12  of this type.  See Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 15.52.  Moreover, the City entirely ignored the \n13  provisions of the Seattle Municipal Code that require the City to โdesignate an alternate proposalโ \n14  where, as here, a demonstration โwould unreasonably disrupt the orderly or safe circulation of \n15  traffic; would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety, or present an unreasonable \n16  risk of injury, to the public, the participants, or City employees; or would present an unreasonable \n17  risk of damage to property.โ  See Seattle Municipal Code 15.52.060 (providing that the City โshall \n18  designate an alternate proposal . . . .โ (emphasis added).). \n19  219.  Moreover, in addition to providing material support and encouragement to the \n20  CHOP participants, the City supported the CHOP participants by declining to provide police \n21  protection in areas occupied by CHOP participants; declining to enforce criminal laws against \n22  CHOP participants; declining to enforce zoning and nuisance laws against CHOP participants; and \n23  refusing to respond to 9-1-1 calls or otherwise provide emergency services to areas occupied by \n24  CHOP participants.   \n25 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 62  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 63 of 65\n \n1  220.  Meanwhile, the City continued to provide police protection to areas not occupied \n2  by CHOP participants; continued to enforce criminal laws outside of the CHOP area; continued to \n3  enforce zoning and nuisance laws outside of the CHOP area; and continued to enforce protest-\n4  permit requirements and other time, place, and manner restrictions outside of the CHOP area. \n5  221.  This difference between how the City treated areas occupied by CHOP versus other \n6  areas of the City amounted to preferential treatment for the CHOP participants based on the \n7  political viewpoints they were expressing.   \n8  222.  In other words, because the City favored the CHOP participantsโ viewpoints, the \n9  City granted the CHOP participants de facto autonomy over the CHOP area and de facto immunity \n10  from law enforcement, all while continuing to exercise governmental authority elsewhere in the \n11  City and continuing to enforce the law against everyone else.  \n12  223.  The Cityโs policy of granting the CHOP participants de facto autonomy and de \n13  facto immunity from law enforcement amounts to discrimination on the basis of political speech, \n14  and was not narrowly tailored to serve any substantial, legitimate government objective.  \n15  224.  As a result of the Cityโs awarding the CHOP participants de facto autonomy over \n16  the CHOP area, Plaintiffsโ rights to freely express their own viewpoints, including any viewpoints \n17  contrary to those of the CHOP participants, were severely restricted.  CHOP participants regularly \n18  threatened, bullied, and even assaulted individuals whom they suspected might hold viewpoints \n19  contrary to their own, and the Cityโs policies allowed them to do so with impunity.  CHOP \n20  participants even threatened violence against individuals taking pictures in public places and \n21  property owners painting over graffiti on their own buildings.   \n22  225.  Even if the Cityโs conduct and policies were not discriminatory on the basis of \n23  political speech, the Cityโs policies and conduct were irrational and arbitrary.   \n24  226.  For instance, the Cityโs policy of refusing to respond to 9-1-1 calls from the CHOP \n25  area, while continuing to respond to 9-1-1 calls and provide emergency services elsewhere in the \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 63  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 64 of 65\n \n1  City, was irrational because any obstructions or dangers to providing services within CHOP were \n2  created and maintained by the Cityโs own policy of supporting and endorsing the actions of the \n3  CHOP participants.   \n4  227.  Moreover, the policy was arbitrary because City continued to respond to 9-1-1 calls \n5  and provide emergency services outside of the CHOP area, including in similarly dangerous \n6  situations.  For example, while CHOP was still ongoing, the City provided emergency response \n7  services in the following dangerous situations, among many others: \n8  a.  In North Seattle on June 29, police reportedly responded to โ[a] 911 call with \n9  yelling in the background and a report of a man with a gun.โ8  Medics \n10  responded to the scene as well.   \n11  b.  In Wallingford on June 24, Seattle Police Department officers responded to \n12  reports of a man in crisis and armed with a knife and took the suspect into \n13  custody.9 \n14  c.  On June 24, the Seattle Fire Department responded to reports of a gas leak near \n15  the 5000 block of 14th Avenue NW.10   \n16  d.  On June 22, the Seattle Fire Department responded to reports of toxic fumes \n17  in a building at the 10300 block of Meridian Ave N.11 \n18  228.  Through the above-alleged conduct, the City has violated the Equal Protection \n19  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   \n20  229.  The City did so pursuant to City policy as created and ratified by City policymakers, \n21  including Mayor Durkan.   \n22  230.  Plaintiffs and the Class have been harmed by this denial of equal protection, \n23  including through loss of revenue, loss of property value, damages to property, and other damages.  \n24   \n8 https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2020/06/29/man-kills-woman-in-domestic-violence-incident-in-north-seattle/ \n25  9 https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1275883690229329920 \n10 https://twitter.com/SeattleFire/status/1275842278821523456 \n11 https://twitter.com/SeattleFire/status/1275122174630608897 \n \n27 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \nCase No. 2:20-cv-00983 TSZ - 64  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \n28 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 9   Filed 07/10/20   Page 65 of 65\n \n1  VII.

OVERVIEW \n3  1.  The  rights  of  free  speech  and  to  peaceably  assemble  are  enshrined  in  our \n4  constitutional tradition. Plaintiffs support free-speech rights and support the efforts of those like \n5  Black Lives Matter who, by exercising such rights, are bringing issues such as systemic racism \n6  and  unfair  violence  against  African  Americans  by  police  to  the  forefront  of  the  national \n7  consciousness. Specifically, Plaintiffs support the free speech rights of many of those who have \n8  gathered on Capitol Hill to form what has been called โCHAZ,โ standing for the โCapitol Hill \n9  Autonomous Zone,โ or โCHOPโ for โCapitol Hill Organized Protestโ or โCapitol Hill Occupying \n10  Protest.โ1   \n11  2.  This lawsuit does not seek to undermine CHOP participantsโ message or present a \n12  counter-message.  Rather,  this  lawsuit  is  about  the  constitutional  and  other  legal  rights  of \n13  Plaintiffsโbusinesses, employees, and residents in and around CHOPโwhich have been overrun \n14  by  the  City  of  Seattleโs  unprecedented  decision  to  abandon  and  close  off  an  entire  city \n15  neighborhood, leaving it unchecked by the police, unserved by fire and emergency health services, \n16  and inaccessible to the public at large. The Cityโs decision has subjected businesses, employees, \n17  and residents of that neighborhood to extensive property damage, public safety dangers, and an \n18  inability to use and access their properties. \n19  3.  On June 8, 2020, the City of Seattle (โthe Cityโ) abruptly deserted the Seattle Police \n20  Departmentโs East Precinct on the corner of Twelfth Avenue and E. Pine Street in Seattleโs Capitol \n21  Hill neighborhood, leaving behind numerous barriers that had previously been used as a line \n22  between police and protesters. \n23 \n24 \n \n25 \n1 This complaint primarily refers to the area as โCHOP,โ and the people who are participating in CHOP who are not \nbusinesses, employees, or residents of the area as โCHOP participants.โ \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 2    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 3 of 56\n \n1  4.  When the City abandoned the precinct and the nearby barriers, a number of \n2  individuals who had been in the area took control of the barriers and used them to block off streets \n3  in an area around the East Precinct.  \n4  5.  In  the  days  and  weeks  after  the  City  abandoned  the  East  Precinct,  CHOP \n5  participants have occupied the public streets, sidewalks, and parks in the area at all hours of the \n6  day and night. Rather than seeking to restore order and protect the residents and property owners \n7  within CHOP, the City instead chose to actively endorse, enable, and participate in the occupation \n8  of CHOP.  \n9  6.  The City has provided Cal Anderson Park, a public park located at the center of \n10  CHOP,  to CHOP for use  as the staging ground supporting CHOPโs occupation of the surrounding \n11  area. Supported by the City, countless CHOP participants now reside in the park at all times of day \n12  and night, having turned it into a tent city. At any given time, hundreds of CHOP participants are \n13  camped out in the park. Violence, vandalism, excessive noise, public drug use, and other crimes \n14  are rampant within the park.  \n15  7.  The Cityโs conduct has resulted in CHOP being blocked off from public access. \n16  Among other conduct detailed below, the City recently provided the participants with concrete \n17  barriers to use to block the streets, which CHOP participants have indeed used to barricade the \n18  streets and create borders. These borders have, at times, been guarded by armed CHOP participants \n19  who oversee who can or cannot enter CHOP. As a result, the streets are barred to most all vehicular \n20  traffic, making it virtually impossible for residents and businesses to access their buildings, receive \n21  deliveries, and provide goods and services to the few customers willing to enter CHOP.  \n22  8.  The Cityโs conduct has also resulted in the elimination of basic public safety within \n23  CHOP and nearby areas. For example, the City has enacted a policy under which police will not \n24  enter the CHOP area except during life-and-death emergencies, and, even in those situations, the \n25  response is, at best, muted and late. After a fatal shooting in the early morning of June 20, 2020, \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 3    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 4 of 56\n \n1  for example, officers did not even approach the area of the shooting until approximately 20 minutes \n2  after the shooting, and no professional medical response was available for at least 15 minutes. At \n3  other times, even during life-and-death emergencies, the police have acquiesced to demands from \n4  CHOP participants that they abandon the area. The City has acknowledged the serious safety issues \n5  it has created, in particular noting that there are โdangerous conditionsโ at night, but the City has \n6  nonetheless chosen to maintain its policy of providing resources and support to the CHOP \n7  occupiers.  \n8  9.  The Cityโs conduct has enabled the widespread destruction and vandalism of \n9  private property. Graffiti is pervasive throughout CHOPโit is not only on barriers, streets, \n10  sidewalks, but also on nearly every private building within CHOP. Graffiti that is painted over \n11  almost immediately returns, and property owners have been told by CHOP participants that if they \n12  dare to paint over graffiti, their buildings will be more severely vandalized or even burned to the \n13  ground. The City has done nothing to prevent this conduct, but, instead, has actively endorsed and \n14  supported  the  ongoing  occupation  of  the  CHOP  area  and  the  destruction  of  property  that \n15  accompanies it. As a result, property owners and their tenants have not been able to fully use their \n16  properties. Property owners and tenants have, for instance, had to lock and barricade their garages \n17  and loading areas at risk of having CHOP participants entering and vandalizing them. \n18  10.  The property owners, businesses, and residents in the area suffer ever-increasing \n19  property damage and economic loss every day that CHOP exists in their neighborhood, all because \n20  of the Cityโs active support, encouragement, and endorsement of the occupation. In particular, \n21  Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has provided the CHOP participants with not just tangible resources \n22  but also a de facto stamp of approval. Her tweets, interviews, and other statements have made it \n23  clear that the City is fully aware of what is happening, has no plan or timeline for remedying the \n24  ongoing harm, and in fact views the occupation of Capitol Hill as something akin to a perpetual \n25  block party. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 4    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 5 of 56\n \n1  11.  Plaintiffs and others have repeatedly pleaded with Mayor Durkan and others to \n2  cease enabling the destruction of their property and the imminent dangers posed to them and their \n3  neighborhood. But the City has not listened, or has not cared, and Plaintiffs have had to resort to \n4  litigation to make themselves heard. \n5  12.  Again,  this  case is  not  about  Plaintiffsโ  agreement  or  disagreement  with  the \n6  inspiration for CHOP, or the viewpoints expressed by the people occupying that area. Instead, it \n7  is about the Cityโs active, knowing endorsement and support of a destructive occupation of a \n8  neighborhood to the detriment of the well-being of those who live and work in that neighborhood. \n9  II.  PARTIES \n10  13.  Plaintiffs are residents, tenants, property owners, and small businesses in Seattleโs \n11  Capitol Hill neighborhood that have been harmed by CHOP. Without an injunction restraining the \n12  City from continuing its policies of supporting and enabling the occupation of the CHOP area, \n13  each of the Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm, by, among other things, being subject \n14  to acts of violence, harassment, trespass and vandalism; denial of access to their property; loss of \n15  police protection and public services, including trash, medical, and fire services; loss of business \n16  revenue; loss of the use of public streets, sidewalks, and parks near or adjacent to their property, \n17  residence, or premises; reduction in property value; destruction of property; and other economic \n18  and non-economic injuries. \n19  14.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  30.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. ยง1331 \n3  because this action presents federal questions and seeks to redress deprivations of rights under \n4  the United States Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n5  31.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(e)(1) because the events \n6  giving rise to these claims arose in the Western District of Washington. \n7  IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n8  A.  The Creation of CHOP \n9  32.  On June 8, 2020, with protests ongoing near the East Precinct, the City emptied the \n10  East Precinct of all weapons and valuables, and then abandoned it. \n11  33.  The City left behind at the precinct and in the surrounding areas large barriers that \n12  had been used in previous days to try to limit the movements of protesters. \n13  34.  Predictably, almost immediately after the SPD abandoned the precinct and the \n14  barriers, CHOP participants used the barriers to block off streets in the area and create a โno-copโ \n15  zone. Initially, the blocked-off area extended to all streets within one block from the precinct. \n16  35.  Without  any  police  presence,  the  CHOP  participants  organized  themselves, \n17  declared the area โFree Capitol Hill,โ and stationed guards by the barriers that the City had \n18  abandoned, thereby creating borders for the occupied area. The area later expanded, was referred \n19  to as CHAZ for several days, and eventually became known as CHOP. \n20  36.  CHOPโs unofficial boundaries stretch north to East Denny Way, east to 13th \n21  Avenue, south to East Pike Street, and west to Broadway. It encompasses the entirety of Cal \n22  Anderson Park and sixteen city blocks in all. \n23  B.  The Activities of CHOP Participants \n24  37.  Ever since the SPD vacated Capitol Hill, the CHOP participants have claimed the \n25  area as their own with a physical presence and a loose form of governance and justice. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 10    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 11 of 56\n \n1  38.  CHOP participants have maintained borders with barriers and people patrolling the \n2  perimeter, as well as vehicles parked in the middle of rights-of-way.  \n3  39.  Many CHOP participants live on the streets and sidewalks and in Cal Anderson \n4  Park, in tents such as the following: \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12   \n13  40.  They have painted graffiti on most available surfaces, and if a property owner paints \n14  over the graffiti, the graffiti is typically replaced within a few hours. CHOP participants have even \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 11    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 12 of 56\n \n1  threatened business owners with retaliation if they paint over graffiti.

CHOP participants have created various unpermitted, ad hoc food dispensaries and \n2  stores on public property in front of and near private residences and businesses. \n3  42.  CHOP participants have created a โmedical tentโ in a private parking lot corner \n4  under a festival tent. \n5  43.  On  occasion,  CHOP  participants  have  acted  as  a  replacement  police  force, \n6  including by demanding that business owners release individuals who were caught committing \n7  crimes and by attempting to perform their own crime investigations \n8  44.  CHOP participants occupy the streets and sidewalks 24 hours a day, and have \n9  speeches, debates, movies, music, and various other activitiesโincluding, in some instances, \n10  illegal fireworks showsโon the streets and sidewalks. Disturbances and noise pollution extend \n11  well past 10 p.m. and typically into the early morning of the next day.  \n12  45.  CHOP participants have been observed carrying guns in the public streets and parks \n13  in broad daylight.  \n14  46.  Cal Anderson Park is one of the focal points of CHOP. The approximately 7-acre \n15  park, which is ostensibly owned by the City, has been entirely handed over to the CHOP \n16  participants.  The  City  has  supported  and  enabled  CHOPโs  occupation  of  the  park  through \n17  providing washing/sanitation facilities, portable toilets, and other material support. \n18  47.  As a result of the Cityโs actions, Cal Anderson Park has been transformed into a \n19  massive tent city for CHOP participants, as shown here:  \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 13    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 14 of 56\n \n1  48.  Members of the public can no longer use Cal Anderson Park. CHOPโs control of \n2  the park has not abated, as shown in the below pictures taken the afternoon of June 23, 2020 (local \n3  residents attempting to take pictures too close to Cal Anderson Park have been threatened by \n4  CHOP participants, who have said they will steal their smartphones): \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12   \n13  49.  CHOP participants have even built makeshift gardens on the parkโs lawn to grow \n14  food for CHOP. The City has handed over public property in the park for this use, as shown here: \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22  50.  CHOPโs control of Cal Anderson Park is a central nuisance to local residents and \n23  businesses. Many of the Plaintiffsโ properties overlook, border, or are adjacent to the park. Not \n24  only are those residents deprived of their use of the park, but problems from CHOPโs encampments \n25  in the park spill over into the entire neighborhood. The hundreds of CHOP participants in the park \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 14    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 15 of 56\n \n1  create excessive noise, even late into the night, in violation of the Cityโs ordinances. Participants \n2  set off fireworks at all hours of the day and night. Trash, feces, and other refuse have built up in \n3  the park, affecting the whole area. Worst of all, Cal Anderson Park has been one of the most violent \n4  areas of CHOP. Local residents have seen individuals in Cal Anderson Park carrying firearms.  \n5  C.  The Effects of CHOP on Plaintiffs and the Class \n6  51.  The impacts on Plaintiffs and the Class have been extensive. The experiences of \n7  each Plaintiff are described in detail below. However, all Plaintiffs and Class members have in \n8  common at least the following harms: a lack of public safety assistance and substantially impaired \n9  access to and use of their properties. \n10  1.  Lack of public-safety assistance even in life-threatening circumstances \n11  52.  The Cityโs endorsement and recognition of CHOP has gone so far that the SPD has \n12  adopted a policy and practice of not entering the area except in the case of life-threatening crimes, \n13  and even then, the SPD response is weak and delayed. \n14  53.  On information and belief, the SPD considers the area from Denny Way to Union \n15  Street and Thirteenth Avenue to Broadway to be a โno responseโ zone where the SPD will not \n16  respond to anything but the most serious crimes. \n17  54.  And even in the most serious situations, the SPDโs response is unconscionably \n18  delayed. As SPD Chief Carmen Best explained on June 11, 2020, as she stood next to Mayor \n19  Durkan: \n \n20 \nSPD has a responsibility to provide public safety services to the \nentire East precinct and the City. The actions of a small group cannot \n21 \nand should not deprive an entire segment of our community from \npublic-safety services. In the first day of the SPD not having access \n22 \nto the precinct, response times for crimes in progress were over \n23  fifteen minutes, about three times as long as the average โฆ. If that \nis your mother, or your sister, your cousin, your neighborโs kid that \n24  is being raped, robbed, assaulted, and otherwise victimized, youโre \nnot going to want to have to report that it took the police three times \n25  longer to get there to provide services to them. The difference in the \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 15    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 16 of 56\n \namount of time could protect someoneโs life and prevent a violent \n1 \nattack. \n2  55.  Recent  events  in  CHOP  demonstrate  that  if  anything,  Chief  Best  was  being \n3  conservative in her description of the public-safety emergency in CHOP. \n4  56.  At approximately 2:20 a.m. on June 20, 2020, there were two people shot in CHOP. \n5  At least one of the shootings happened at or near the intersection of Tenth Avenue and Pine Street, \n6  around the corner from the abandoned East Precinct. One of the victims died before reaching the \n7  hospital. The second was admitted with life-threatening injuries. No suspects have been identified \n8  or taken into custody. \n9  57.  Raw video streamed from the area shortly after that shooting demonstrates the \n10  enormity of the risk created by the City for anyone who lives or works in CHOP. That video clearly \n11  captured the following:2 \n12  a.  The video appears to start a couple of minutes after the shooting. \n13  b.  One shooting victim was taken to the CHOP โmedic tentโ located in a \n14  parking lot under a festival tent. \n15  c.  No professional medics arrived until approximately 15 minutes into the \n16  video to tend to the first shooting victim. \n17  d.  No police were in the area until approximately 18 minutes into the video, \n18  when cars and lights and can be seen several blocks away, and police can be heard on \n19  megaphones demanding that barriers be moved to allow the police to enter. \n20  e.  Approximately 19 minutes into the video, a small phalanx of approximately \n21  8 police officers entered the area on foot and arrived in the area of the medical tent, \n22  apparently for the purpose of trying to locate and extract the first shooting victim. \n23  f.   The  phalanx  of  officers  was  immediately  surrounded,  yelled  at,  and \n24  pursued by CHOP participants. \n25 \n \n2 https://www.facebook.com/WWConverge/videos/297548387941384/?v=297548387941384 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 16    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 17 of 56\n \n1  g.  One police car finally entered the area approximately 20 minutes into the \n2  video. \n3  h.  The police did not engage with the crowd and promptly left the area, after \n4  which CHOP participants created a human chain across the street to bar any further \n5  entry. \n6  i.  There was a second shooting victim in CHOP located a couple of blocks \n7  away. It appears that no medics or police responded at all to the location of the second \n8  victim. \n9  j.  Approximately 35 minutes into the livestream video, the second victim was \n10  placed into a plain white cargo van and presumably taken to the hospital. A voice can \n11  be heard explaining that Medic One drove by but did not come to the assistance of the \n12  person who ended up in the white van. \n13  k.  Shortly after the second victim was driven away, private citizens began \n14  looking for bullet casings. No police were on the scene to perform any investigation in \n15  the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \n16  58.  On June 21, 2020, another shooting occurred in the area at approximately 11:00 at \n17  night. There was no police or medic response, and the shooting victim was transported to the \n18  emergency room by private vehicle. \n19  59.  In a press conference with Mayor Durkan on June 22, 2020, Chief Best reiterated \n20  the seriousness of the public-safety situation, stating: \n \n21 \nthere are countless individuals who are in the CHOP that are \nthere  to  engage,  as  the  Mayor  said  earlier,  in  peaceful \n22 \ndemonstrations. But there are also groups of individuals \nengaging in shootings, a rape, assaults, burglary, arson, and \n23 \nproperty destruction, and I have their police reports right \n24  here. [*Holding up a stack of papers*]  Iโm not making it up. \nThese things have happened. We cannot walk away from the \n25  truth of what is happening there. This is not about politics \n \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 17    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 18 of 56\n \n \n1  and Iโm not a politician. This isnโt a debate about First \nAmendment rights. This is about life or death. So we need a \n2  plan. \n3  2.  Impeded access to and use of property \n4  60.  All Plaintiffs and Class members have not had the ability to use public rights of \n5  way, including streets and sidewalks, to access their homes, businesses, and properties. \n6  61.  CHOP participants regularly move the City-provided barriers and other large \n7  objects wherever they wish to block traffic, sidewalks, and all other manner of ingress and egress. \n8  62.  In many cases, this has meant people cannot use public streets and rights-of-way to \n9  enter or exit their homes or businesses, clients cannot visit businesses, and businesses cannot get \n10  deliveries. The difficulties are magnified for the elderly and the disabled. \n11  63.  The barriers and the constant presence of CHOP participants has also meant that \n12  residents, property owners, and businesses do not have full use of their property. If they can access \n13  their property, safety necessitates that many of them have to keep their doors locked. Many \n14  portions of property that are normally freely accessibleโsuch as garagesโhave to be shut at all \n15  hours or else CHOP participants will vandalize them. \n16  64.  Garbage and recycling cannot enter the area due to the myriad barricades and \n17  CHOP border guards, forcing residents and businesses to pile up refuse without any idea when \n18  they might be able to discard it. \n19  65.  Residents and businesses in the area are unable to receive deliveries at their homes \n20  because delivery companies cannot or will not enter CHOP and the surrounding area because of \n21  barriers and safety concerns. \n22  66.  Residents in and near CHOP are forced to endure loud noises, music, and even \n23  fireworks at all times of the day and night. \n24  67.  Residents in and near CHOP do not have free and safe access in or out of their \n25  homes. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 18    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 19 of 56\n \n1  68.  Businesses are unable to operate normally, or even open, because of blocked access \n2  and concerns for the safety of their suppliers, employees, and customers. \n3  69.  All of this is causing extensive economic and other harm to Plaintiffs and all other \n4  members of the Class. \n5  3.   Plaintiffsโ individual stories \n6  70.  The impact of CHOP on residents, businesses, and property owners is best seen \n7  through the stories of Plaintiffs, who are suffering from the Cityโs policies every day. \n8  71.  Each Plaintiff and the Class has sufferedโand continues to sufferโ irreparable \n9  economic and non-economic injury as a direct result of CHOP participantsโ presence on Capitol \n10  Hill. The Cityโs support for CHOP enables, aids, and abets the ongoing harm to each of the \n11  Plaintiffs and members of the Class. Each Plaintiff and Class member will continue to suffer \n12  irreparable harm unless restrained by this Court. \n13  72.  Plaintiff  Car  Tender.  Plaintiff  Car  Tenderโa  local  small  business  with  one \n14  locationโ has suffered a dramatic drop off in its auto-repair business since the establishment of \n15  CHOP. Since early June 2020, business revenues have declined around 40% from the prior months \n16  of April and May 2020. This drop in sales actually understates Car Tenderโs losses, however, as \n17  April and Mayโs revenues were already lower due to the height of COVID-19 pandemic. In late \n18  May 2020, Car Tenderโs revenues began an upswing coming out of the shutdown, which was \n19  suddenly interrupted by the sharp drop in customers caused by CHOP.  \n20  73.  Car Tenderโs loss of business revenue is a direct result of CHOP. Access to the \n21  shop has at times been substantially impeded due to barricaded streets. Further, customers have \n22  told Car Tender that they will not bring their cars into the shop, out of fear of CHOP located just \n23  down the street from Car Tenderโs location. Customers have even come to the shop only to \n24  immediately turn around and leave, because they were fearful to leave their cars at Car Tenderโs \n25  location. Because of the Cityโs enablement of CHOP, Car Tender is struggling to make ends meet. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 19    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 20 of 56\n \n1  74.  Car Tenderโs premises have also been vandalized by CHOP participants. CHOP \n2  participants tore down the fence around Car Tenderโs car lot, permanently damaging the cement \n3  post such that an entire new fence will need to be constructed. They have also painted and \n4  vandalized with graffiti the side of Car Tenderโs building. Car Tender is fearful that if the company \n5  tries to cover up the graffiti they will face reprisals from CHOP participants, as CHOP participants \n6  have threatened to burn down other properties in the area when owners have attempted to cover or \n7  clean up graffiti. \n8  75.  Car Tenderโs customers are understandably concerned for their safety, and with \n9  good reason. Indeed, Car Tenderโs shop was recently broken into by a man who assaulted the son \n10  of one of Car Tenderโs owners with a knife. The details of the incident demonstrate the extreme \n11  risk of harm to which the City has exposed Plaintiffs and the Class. \n12  76.  On June 14th at around 9:30 p.m., a person broke into Car Tenderโs building, armed \n13  himself with a knife and a spike that he found inside the building, and lit a fire in the shop. After \n14  receiving a call from a neighbor alerting them to the break-in, Car Tenderโs owner and son called \n15  9-1-1 and then went to the premises themselves, where they found the shopโs garage had been \n16  broken into. They found that the property had also been vandalized with Purell hand sanitizer, \n17  which the intruder had dumped everywhere to use as fuel for the fire he had started. That fire was \n18  still burning when the owner and his son arrived, but they were able to extinguish it. The intruder \n19  was still on the premises, however, and he accosted the ownerโs son with the knife and spike and \n20  abruptly assaulted him by hitting him in the chest. \n21  77.  Although blindsided by the intruderโs sudden unprovoked attack, the owner and his \n22  son were able to wrestle the intruder to the floor in a scuffle. The intruder meanwhile tried to cut \n23  the sonโs femoral artery and landed two large cuts to his clothing on the side of his leg. He also \n24  repeatedly attempted to stab the son with the spike. \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 20    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 21 of 56\n \n1  78.  After subduing the intruder, Car Tenderโs owner called 9-1-1 again, reporting the \n2  arson, burglary, and assault, requesting police assistance at the scene. Other neighbors also called \n3  9-1-1. But, despite the multiple 9-1-1 calls. the police never responded to the scene that evening. \n4  79.  Several CHOP participants on the street who witnessed the incident approached the \n5  shop and demanded the release of the apprehended intruder. Car Tenderโs owner at first insisted \n6  that he was waiting for the police to come to the scene. An angry mob of CHOP participants, \n7  perhaps as many as 500 although possibly more, gathered around Car Tenderโs fence and broke it \n8  down, insisting on the release of the intruder. Members of CHOP mob insisted that the police \n9  would never dare respond. Faced with a threat of mob violence, Car Tenderโs owner and son \n10  handed the intruder over to CHOP participants. \n11  80.  Because the police refused to protect Car Tenderโs property from burglary and \n12  arson, Car Tenderโs owner now is forced to sleep at the shop in an effort to protect it. Car Tenderโs \n13  owner has tried to contact Mayor Durkanโs office to report his concerns as a resident and small \n14  business owner, but has received no response. \n15  81.  Car Tenderโs experience is not unique. Other local businesses are also suffering \n16  from the Cityโs actions. \n17  82.  Plaintiff  Richmark  Label.  Plaintiff  Richmark  Label  is  a  local  family-owned \n18  business on Capitol Hill that runs label-printing operations out of a manufacturing facility on Pine \n19  Street, directly adjacent to CHOP. Richmark Labelโs business has been negatively affected as a \n20  direct consequence of CHOP.  \n21  83.  CHOP has frequently blocked access to the 11th Avenue side of Richmark Labelโs \n22  building, where Richmark Label maintains a loading dock for receiving and shipping. Richmark \n23  Label must receive deliveries on an ongoing basis in order to maintain its business as well as make \n24  shipment of its products. Richmark Labelโs ability to use its loading dock is substantially impeded, \n25  as the 11th Avenue access has frequently been blocked by barricades, participants engaged in \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 21    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 22 of 56\n \n1  intimidation tactics, or other CHOP activities. Some delivery drivers have reported to Richmark \n2  Label that they will not even attempt delivery to their building, because it is unsafe. Several \n3  delivery  drivers  who  have  attempted  delivery  have  been  stopped  and  accosted  by  CHOP \n4  participants. Richmark Labelโs usual shippers have refused to deliver and UPS recently elected \n5  not to come and pick up a pallet of wine labels for shipment, one of Richmark Labelโs largest \n6  sources of business. On other occasions, labels have been shipped late, incurring costs and \n7  straining Richmark Labelโs business relationships with its customers. \n8  84.   Unable to timely supply its customers, Richmark Label will permanently lose its \n9  customers unless public safety and regular access on public streets is promptly restored. The Cityโs \n10  support of CHOP is putting Richmark Labelโs business at risk, as well as the livelihood of its over \n11  70 employees. \n12  85.  This loss to business is not the only harm Richmark Label is suffering due to CHOP. \n13  Richmark Label owns its facilities, a historic building from 1927, on which the company paid to \n14  have an artistic mural painted as a gift to the whole Capitol Hill community. That mural has now \n15  been vandalized by CHOP participants beyond repair, whereas before CHOPโs occupation there \n16  had only been minor instances of occasional graffiti. Now the wall will have to be repaired and \n17  repainted, but Richmark Label is fearful of doing so while it is under a continued threat of \n18  vandalism.  \n19  86.  Richmark Label also owns a parking lot on the 11th Avenue side of the building. It \n20  rents the parking spaces during non-business hours. Richmark Label has been forced by CHOP to \n21  shut the parking lot down because the roads for accessing the parking lot have frequently been \n22  blocked and customers are afraid of entering the area. The company is therefore receiving none of \n23  the usual rental income it typically receives from the parking spaces. The parking lot also typically \n24  serves as customer parking for Richmark Label and several of its tenants who rent space in the \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 22    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 23 of 56\n \n1  companyโs building. But, due to CHOP, both Richmark Label and its tenants are now being \n2  deprived of customer parking. \n3  87.  Unauthorized cars have also parked in Richmark Labelโs lot. Richmark Label has \n4  contacted towing companies, but all have refused to tow the cars because CHOP makes the area \n5  unsafe. Richmark Label has called the police on multiple occasions regarding the unauthorized \n6  cars parked on their property, but the police have not acted. Richmark Label has called 9-1-1 \n7  regarding the unauthorized cars trespassing on their property, only to be told at least twice that \n8  SPD is not responding to calls in the area.  \n9  88.  Like Plaintiff Car Tender, Richmark Label has also been threatened with violence \n10  by CHOP participants. When CHOP first arose, Richmark Label allowed a local news crew to \n11  access its roof to film the protests and CHOP. SPD officers then also accessed Richmark Labelโs \n12  roof  to  assess  the  situation,  where  they  were  photographed  by  CHOP  participants.  Those \n13  photographs were then posted online, leading to a social media frenzy against the company. \n14  Subsequently, Richmark Labelโs employees have reported that they do not feel safe coming to \n15  work,  because  of  the  threat  of  harassment  and  violence  from  CHOP  participants.  CHOP \n16  participants have set up cones across 11th Avenue, which must be crossed to access Richmark \n17  Labelโs building. CHOP participants have been stopping people and requiring them to answer \n18  questions about who they are and what they are doing in the area before letting them pass. The \n19  result is that customers, shippers, and employees are scared to even enter the area.  \n20  89.  Richmark Label has been in contact with the Mayorโs office, but the office has not \n21  been returning the companyโs calls, offering any assistance, or providing any opportunity to \n22  challenge the Cityโs decision to authorize the ongoing occupation of the CHOP area. The Cityโs \n23  support of CHOP through encouragement and material support has enabled CHOPโs threat to \n24  Richmark Labelโs business.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 23    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 24 of 56\n \n1  90.  Plaintiff Northwest Liquor and Wine. Northwest Liquor and Wineโa one-location \n2  store specializing in high-end wine, beer, and spiritsโis yet another local small business that has \n3  suffered since CHOP occupation began in early June. After record sales in May 2020, the store is \n4  having its worst month in June 2020 since opening at that location in 2012. In June 2020, the \n5  companyโs sales have been down approximately 70% from average and sales are continuing to \n6  sink, threatening the companyโs ability to pay its rent.  \n7  91.  Customers are unable to visit the store because the surrounding streets have been \n8  blocked off to traffic. Northwest Liquor and Wine has access to an adjacent parking garage, but \n9  they have been forced to close it to prevent CHOP participants from camping out in it and even \n10  starting  fires.  CHOP  barricades  have  also  meant  that  suppliers  have  been  unable  to  make \n11  deliveries.  \n12  92.  The owners and employees do not feel safe, as there have been disturbances in the \n13  store and people on the streets nearby carrying guns. Northwest Liquor and Wine normally \n14  maintains around 4 to 6 employees. Since CHOP started, its employees have understandably been \n15  too scared to come to work out of concern for their safety.  \n16  93.  Plaintiff  Sage  Physical  Therapy.  Plaintiff  Sage  Physical  Therapy  (โSageโ)  is \n17  another small business suffering losses because of CHOP. When CHOP started in early June, \n18  clients immediately stopped coming, saying that they are scared to come near CHOP. Additionally, \n19  the few clients willing to venture near CHOP have found Sageโs offices to be inaccessible, as many \n20  of the nearby streets have been blocked, and even on the few streets in the area that have not been \n21  blocked, the City has ceased enforcing parking restrictions, allowing vehicles to remain parked \n22  indefinitely. As a result, there is no parking and Sageโs offices are therefore not accessible to its \n23  clients. The lack of access if is especially hard on Sageโs clientele, as many are seeking therapy \n24  for injury and are unable to walk far. Sageโs clients have been canceling their appointments, \n25  because of CHOP.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 24    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 25 of 56\n \n1  94.  Even one of Sageโs patients who resides within walking distance of Sageโs offices \n2  has been unable to access Sageโs building due to CHOP. Sage has a patient who resides in an \n3  apartment building inside CHOP. The patient is on crutches from traumatic leg injury. She resides \n4  only a short distance from Sage, but the City has enabled CHOP to place barriers across sidewalks, \n5  and different barricades pop up near Sage every day. Sageโs injured patient is not able to navigate \n6  around the barriers and the patient has reported to Sage that she upset about not being able to get \n7  to her much-needed therapy appointments.   \n8  95.  Sageโs owner also fears violence from the presence of CHOP. After CHOP arose, \n9  she observed a van parked outside Sageโs office with an automatic weapon in the front seat and a \n10  plywood barrier and padlock so that the back of the van was not visible. Sageโs owner is aware \n11  that CHOP participants nearby have reportedly highjacked vehicles. Sageโs owner is also aware of \n12  an incident involving another local business owner known to Sageโs owner. After that business \n13  ownerโs store was closed for the day, a CHOP participant demanded to use the storeโs restroom, \n14  exposed himself to the female owner, and then attempted to assault the business owner, who \n15  fortunately was able to flee the scene. These incidents of violence against local businesses, \n16  compounded with a loss of business revenue, have caused Sageโs owner physical stress, forced her \n17  to  keep  the  office  door  locked  at  all  time  making  business  impossible,  and  acerbated  her \n18  hypertension.  \n19  96.  One of Sageโs clients reported that he was scared to come to his appointment \n20  because of CHOP, but decided that because he was in so much physical pain, he needed his therapy \n21  treatment. He parked near 11th Avenue for his appointment. He ended his appointment early, \n22  however, because he was concerned about a passing protest of CHOP participants. Upon returning \n23  to his car, he found that all four tires had been slashed by CHOP participants. He reported to Sage \n24  that, even though he suffers from pain and needs treatment, he will not attempt to come to future \n25  appointments because of CHOP. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 25    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 26 of 56\n \n1  97.  Adding to Sageโs difficulties, Sageโs internet cable has been cut, and Sage has been \n2  unable to schedule an appointment for a Wave Cable technician to come fix the internet access \n3  because of the presence of CHOP. This has put Sage at imminent risk, as Sageโs security \n4  camerasโmuch needed under the current circumstancesโrequire internet access and are therefore \n5  currently inoperable.  \n6  98.  To date, Sage has lost considerable revenue from patient cancellations due to \n7  CHOP, which places considerable strain on a small business like Sage. Around 60% of patients \n8  have canceled their appointments.  \n9  99.  Sage employs three physical therapists and one personal trainer. Their livelihoods \n10  are now threatened by CHOP. Sageโs company motto is: โUnapologetically fighting for good.โ  All \n11  of its employees are supporters of Black Lives Matter and pride themselves on providing a place \n12  of inclusivity and respect. The City has not listened to their concerns.  \n13  100.  Sageโs owner has written to Mayor Durkan to complain about the current situation, \n14  as well as the difficulties CHOP has caused for many of Sageโs disabled clients. That letter reads: \n15  โMy business Sage Physical Therapy is located at the corner of 12th Ave & E. Olive St within the \n16  CHAZ footprint. I have patients that live in the CHAZ neighborhood that are on crutches due to \n17  their injuries. They need physical therapy but they canโt get to my office because they canโt \n18  navigate the barricades. The sidewalks are blocked with heavy barricades. My patients arenโt able \n19  to access the disabled parking and loading zones because non-disabled people are parking there. \n20  People arenโt able to receive the care they deserve. The roads and sidewalks need to be cleared. I \n21  would like to remind you about the Americans with Disabilities Act. Blocking the road and \n22  sidewalk is against the ADA. This current environment on Capitol Hill is unacceptable!!! Letโs \n23  not forget about people with disabilities. As a business owner, I feel abandoned by the city. This \n24  is unacceptable. The City of Seattle is violating ADA regulations.โ  The Mayor has not responded.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 26    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 27 of 56\n \n1  101.  Plaintiff Magdalena Sky (Tattoos and Fortune). Plaintiff Magdalena Sky is an \n2  activist and supporter of Black Lives Matter. Ms. Sky is the sole proprietor of Tattoos and Fortune. \n3  Ms. Sky is autistic and has worked tirelessly for years using her unique artistic skills to support \n4  and grow her business. Her business is her own safety net and primary source of income. Now, \n5  CHOP is ripping that business out from under her feet. \n6  102.  Like many other local businesses, Tattoos and Fortune is sinking because of the \n7  Cityโs support of CHOP. Ms. Skyโs tattoo and fortune telling services depend on regular client \n8  access to its Capitol Hill studio. Tattoo and Fortuneโs studio is within CHOP, which has made \n9  client access impossible. The barricades and encampments have blocked both vehicle and foot \n10  access to the studio, as well as delivery of vital business supplies, just as they have blocked the \n11  roads, parking, doorways, and driveways of many local businesses. As a result, Ms. Sky has been \n12  forced to close Tattoos and Fortuneโs doors. Without clients, Tattoos and Fortune cannot generate \n13  any revenue. In addition, Tattoos and Fortune is suffering from the lack of trash service, access for \n14  emergency services, and police protection. Even if Ms. Skyโs clients had access to the studio, many \n15  would be fearful to come because of CHOP. To reach her business, her clients would need to cross \n16  barricades that CHOP participants have set up, where they might be stopped, questioned, and/or \n17  harassed by CHOP participants, as others have been. \n18  103.  Ms. Sky herself has witnessed theft and looting from other local businesses and  \n19  fears CHOP participants might steal and loot from her business, should she even try to open her \n20  studioโs doors. On one occasion, Ms. Sky was followed and harassed, like so many others have \n21  been due to the rise in harassment and sexual assault in the area since CHOP began. The fear of \n22  violence has caused Ms. Sky stress, exacerbated by her autism. The City has ignored her concerns, \n23  as with the mental health of many local residents and business owners. Her businessโher primary \n24  means of livelihoodโis losing all its revenue. Some of her clients may never return, as they have \n25  already canceled appointments and gone to other businesses.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 27    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 28 of 56\n \n1  104.  Capitol Hill is a diverse neighborhood, known for its minority presence and as a \n2  center for Seattleโ LGBTQ residents. Many small business owners in the area are minority-owned \n3  and suffering loss of property and business from CHOP, just as Tattoos and Fortune is. The City \n4  and CHOP have not responded to concerns of small businesses like Ms. Skyโs Tattoos and Fortune. \n5  Ms. Sky, along with other local business owners, has no forum in which to voice her concerns and \n6  try to stem her businesses losses, accruing each day CHOP continues.  \n7  105.  Plaintiff Bergmanโs Lock and Key. Plaintiff Bergmanโs Lock and Key is a small \n8  business that has operated on Capitol Hill since 1956.  \n9  106.  Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs employees are not safe to come to work due to CHOP. \n10  Several on their way to or from work have been followed by CHOP participants wielding baseball \n11  bats, who threatened them not to come into the area. To protect its property from  CHOP \n12  participants, Bergmanโs Lock and Key has been forced to board up its premises. Its building has \n13  been tagged with graffiti and vandalized. Because CHOP becomes more dangerous as the day \n14  progresses, the company closes around 3:00 p.m., two and half hours before its normal 5:30 p.m. \n15  closing time.  \n16  107.  Bergmanโs Lock and Key is suffering financially. Its customers cannot access the \n17  store due to roadblocks, barricades, and lack of parking caused by the Cityโs support of CHOP. \n18  Other customers are simply too scared to come, because of Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs proximity \n19  to the CHOP zone. Customers have called citing their fears and the company has been forced to \n20  refer them to competitor businesses outside of the CHOP area. Bergmanโs Lock and Keyโs \n21  revenues have already declined this month by 60%, due to CHOP. Bergmanโs Lock and Key was \n22  able to maintain working as an essential business during the COVID-19 shutdown, but now CHOP \n23  has stopped nearly all customers from coming in. Business deliveries and shipments are also \n24  routinely delayed. \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 28    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 29 of 56\n \n1  108.  The City has been actively supporting CHOP participants near Bergmanโs Lock \n2  and Key. The City has provided cleaning stations for CHOP participants, large stainless-steel \n3  sinks, and portable toilets. \n4  109.    Bergmanโs Lock and Key has tried to complain to the City, but has received no \n5  response.  \n6  110.  Plaintiff Onyx HOA. Plaintiff Onyx HOA is an association of Capitol Hill residents \n7  and condo owners in the Onyx Condominium building. The HOA and its residents have suffered \n8  harm from CHOP. The Onyx Condominiumโs residents feel unsafe and are constantly barraged by \n9  excessive noise, fireworks, and other nuisances. The building has been subject to graffiti and other \n10  acts of vandalism at the hands of CHOP participants. The HOA and its residents have called 9-1-\n11  1, but have received no response or direction from the City. The HOAโs insurer has threatened to \n12  raise rates and premiums soon if CHOP is not disbanded. Tenants are already planning to leave, \n13  which will only make it harder for the tenants that do remain to fund the HOA. All tenants have \n14  lost value in terms of property values as a direct result of the Cityโs support of CHOP. \n15  111.  The  Onyx  Condominiums  are  on  the  border  of  CHOP.  As  a  result,  Onyx \n16  Condominium residentsโ access to their own homes has been impeded, due to barricades on the \n17  public streets. For example, the president of Onyx HOA, individual Plaintiff Wade Biller, has been \n18  stopped by CHOP participants at the barricades and told he is not allowed to drive through. He has \n19  also been stopped by a CHOP participant while trying to drive down 12th Avenue to access his \n20  home. At other times, so-called โsecurityโ for CHOP has come to the barricades and offered to \n21  escort him into the area to access his home so that CHOP participants do not vandalize his car.    \n22  112.  CHOP participants recently stole an expensive compact dumpster bin belonging to \n23  Onyx HOA. Onyx HOAโs president, Mr. Biller, demanded the bin back, but CHOP participants \n24  refused to return it. During negotiations for return of the bin, Mr. Biller was assaulted by a CHOP \n25  participant who violently kicked him in the back as he tried to leave the scene. The HOA president \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 29    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 30 of 56\n \n1  called the police, but the police did not respond to the incident of battery and assault for more than \n2  90 minutes, by which point the perpetrator was long gone. Eventually, when CHOP participants \n3  had access to city-owned barricades to encircle CHOP, the compactor bin was returned.    \n4  113.  Onyx HOA has been forced to hire additional security to protect the property and \n5  its residents from the CHOP participants. At any time, two to four armed guards must be present, \n6  as some CHOP participants in the area have been violent and are themselves armed with guns. The \n7  HOAโs residents live under constant fear and threat to their wellbeing and property.  \n8  114.  Mr. Biller, in his capacity as Onyx HOAโs president, wrote to Mayor Durkan on \n9  June 11, 2020, about the plight of the buildingโs residents. He wrote: โWe are fending for ourselves \n10  as residents and businesses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. We have had to hire private security \n11  to help keep tabs on the escalating issues . . . . I ask that you take a strong stance and allow the \n12  police to reclaim our streets for the residents who live here and donโt [want] to become part of this \n13  anti-police and anti-government movement.โ  Mayor Durkan has not responded or provided any \n14  opportunity to challenge the Cityโs policies supporting the occupation of the CHOP area.   \n15  115.  Madrona Real Estate Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs Madrona Real Estate Services, Madrona \n16  Real Estate Investors IV, Madrona Real Estate Investors VI, and 12th and Pike Associates LLC \n17  (collectively โMadrona Real Estateโ) are suffering economic loss from CHOP, including in the \n18  form of reduced rents, property damage, and a decline in property values. Their tenantsโCapitol \n19  Hillโs local residents and businessesโare also being harmed and harassed.  \n20  116.  Madrona Real Estate owns and/or manages multiple residential and commercial \n21  buildings on Capitol Hill in and around CHOP. The presence of CHOP is greatly reducing the \n22  value or property in what was, until recently, one of the most popular and expensive neighborhoods \n23  in Seattle.   \n24  117.  A resident in a building managed by Madrona Real Estate recently called 9-1-1 to \n25  respond to an incident of violence near Madrona Real Estateโs building at 1414 12th Avenue. The \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 30    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 31 of 56\n \n1  resident had witnessed from her condoโs patio a fight in the street occurring at or near the \n2  intersection of 12th Avenue and Union. The resident saw what appeared to be a man and a woman \n3  fighting over a child, causing the woman to run into a nearby building and barricading the door to \n4  block the assaulting man. The resident called 9-1-1, who took her name and number. She waited \n5  for hours, but police never responded to the incident or called her back. This is just one example \n6  of the lawlessness the City has enabled in the area. The same resident has normally walked her \n7  dog in the neighbor, but now is hesitant to leave her residence. She has witnessed CHOP \n8  participants openly doing hard drugs on the street around her building with impunity due to the \n9  lack of any SPD presence.   \n10  118.  The same building at 1414 12th Avenue managed and owned by Madrona Real \n11  Estate has been broken into by CHOP participants, who have vandalized the building, pulled out \n12  pipes, and even pulled the fire alarm and set off the sprinkler system (causing evacuation of the \n13  buildingโs over 100 residents and flooding in the building garage). Residents have also reported \n14  that CHOP participants have stolen boxes and other items from residents. CHOP participants have \n15  trespassed on the property and defecated in buildingโs lobby.  \n16  119.  At other locations in the area, Madrona Real Estateโs residents have reported that \n17  their condos have been broken into or burglarized by CHOP participants. CHOP participants have \n18  harassed residents, vandalized the Madrona Real Estateโs property, and left human feces on \n19  multiple premises.  \n20  120.  SPD has refused to help Madrona Real Estate to protect  private property or \n21  otherwise to help address these problems. At considerable expense, Madrona Real has had to hire \n22  increased private security to protect its residents and property. At the building where the fire \n23  system was vandalized, Madrona Real Estate has incurred considerable expense in fixing the \n24  damage to property and has even had to pay for a fire watch to be instituted.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 31    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 32 of 56\n \n1  121.  On the morning of June 23, 2020, one of Madrona Real Estateโs commercial \n2  tenants, a restaurant located at 12th Avenue and Pike Street, near but not directly in the CHOP \n3  blockaded area, was attempting to access its location in an effort to try to reopen. However, the \n4  entrances and stoop area in front of the restaurant were entirely blocked by an encampment erected \n5  by a CHOP participant. The tenant called the police, asking for assistance in removing trespassers \n6  from its private property, so that it could access and open up the property. The police said that they \n7  would not respond because they โare not allowed to come within two blocks of CHOPโ.   \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n122.  Clearly, the Cityโs refusal to even respond to assaults in the neighborhood, let alone \n21 \ntake any measures to ensure public order and access, is detracting from the areaโs desirability for \n22 \ncurrent and potential residents and businesses. At a new property Madrona Real Estate has opened \n23 \nin the area with 45 residential units, only 3 have been leased. Up until the emergence of CHOP the \n24 \narea was among the trendiest location for residents, but, since the emergence of CHOP, Madrona \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 32    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 33 of 56\n \n1  Real Estate has suddenly had no interest in the 42 unleased units, because no one is interested in \n2  moving near CHOP.  \n3  123.  Madrona Real Estateโs residents and tenants face other hardships as well. Many of \n4  the areaโs millennial residents regularly shop online, but, according to Madrona Real Estateโs \n5  residents and tenants, Amazon will not deliver packages in area, due the barricaded streets and \n6  presence of CHOP participants. The inability to purchase or ship through Amazon is even more \n7  acutely felt now in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many people rely on deliveries to \n8  safely deliver food, medicine, and other essential items.   \n9  124.  Most of Madrona Real Estateโs commercial tenants want to open but are unable to \n10  do so, because they are fearful of CHOP, have no way of attracting customers, and/or cannot be \n11  accessed due to blocked streets. Unable to generate revenue, many of these tenants are asking \n12  Madrona Real Estate for rent relief. Many are small, locally owned stores. Madrona Real Estate \n13  has been giving concessions in the form of free rent, resulting in economic loss, but even so many \n14  of the small commercial tenants are still facing bankruptcy.  \n15  125.  The  Cityโs  policies  with  respect  to  CHOP  have resulted  in  other  sources  of \n16  economic loss to Madrona Real Estate. For example, Madrona Real Estate operates a parking \n17  garage near CHOP. But, since the occupation of the CHOP area started, nearly no one is coming \n18  to the area to shop or dine. Parking revenue this month is only a small fraction of the average.   \n19  126.  Madrona Real Estate has complained to the City and even sent a letter to Mayor \n20  Durkan. Mayor Durkan has not responded or even acknowledged the plight of the many residents \n21  Madrona Real Estate services, let alone provided any recourse to challenge the Cityโs policies and \n22  conduct.     \n23  127.  Plaintiff Hunters Capital. Plaintiff Hunters Capital is a real-estate company that \n24  owns or manages multiple residential, commercial, and mixed-use buildings on Capitol Hill in and \n25  around CHOP. Like Madrona Real Estate, the presence of CHOP is causing economic injury to \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 33    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 34 of 56\n \n1  Hunters Capital, including loss of revenue, damage to property, and decline in property value. \n2  Hunters Capital has recently had investors back out of Capitol Hill development projects, citing \n3  CHOP as the reason to withdraw. Every day the City supports the ongoing occupation of CHOP, \n4  Hunters Capital incurs further irreparable harm.  \n5  128.  Hunters Capital property and employees have also been threatened by CHOP \n6  participants. For example, a Hunters Capital maintenance employee was recently attempting to \n7  clean up CHOP graffiti at a Hunters Capital building located near 10th Avenue and Pike Street at \n8  around 7:00 am in the morning. As he started to paint over the graffiti, the worker was accosted \n9  by a group of CHOP participants. The participants ordered him to stop removing the graffiti and \n10  threatened to burn the building down if he did not comply. Because of the threats, the maintenance \n11  worker left without painting over the graffiti, emotionally distraught due to the threats of violence \n12  and arson.   \n13  129.  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants are finding that the area around CHOP is now \n14  unlivable. For example, they have reported numerous noise and safety concerns. Although the City \n15  has a noise ordinance, it is not enforced in and around CHOP. CHOP participants are violating the \n16  ordinance late into every night, even setting off fireworks into the early hours of the morning. \n17  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants simply cannot sleep and are being deprived of their right to \n18  quiet enjoyment of their homes. Hunters Capital has repeatedly written to the City, but the City \n19  has not responded to the concerns or provided any recourse or ability to challenge the Cityโs \n20  policies or conduct with respect to CHOP.  \n21  130.  Hunters Capitalโs residential tenants have also reported concern for their physical \n22  safety. Many who used the local Cal Anderson Park for recreation or to walk their pets no longer \n23  do so because of safety concerns and rampant public drug use. Incidents of assault and harassment \n24  have occurred in the area. Hunters Capitalโs residents recently witnessed a peaceful individual \n25  forcefully removed from the area by CHOP mobs. Female renters in particular have reported \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 34    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 35 of 56\n \n1  concerns about their personal safety, in light of numerous reported instances of sexual assault \n2  within CHOP. Some residential tenants have threatened to break their leases at properties owned \n3  by Hunters Capital because of the extensive problems created by CHOP. \n4  131.  Hunters Capitalโs commercial tenants are also suffering. Many report that they \n5  cannot open, because they fear doing so will expose them to looting and arson. Many tenants have \n6  themselves witnessed assault, theft, and looting. These commercial tenants have been forced by \n7  CHOP to close and board up their stores in order to protect them. Some commercial tenants \n8  physically could not open under any circumstances, as CHOP participant have blocked the store \n9  entrances, including by setting up residential areas for CHOP participants on public streets and \n10  sidewalks with tents. Unable to open, Hunters Capitalโs commercial tenants are struggling. Many \n11  are small businesses and storefronts that depend on visitors coming to Capitol Hill. Many currently \n12  cannot pay their rent as a direct consequence of CHOP.  \n13  132.  Other Hunters Capital commercial tenants with office space in the area have \n14  reported that they are unable to come to work at their office space, because of blocked access and \n15  fear of CHOP participants. Additionally, the commercial office tenants have reported that the noise \n16  issues are so serious that they and their employees are unable to use their office space for work. \n17  Loud speeches and chanting at all hours of the day simply make normal working conditions \n18  impossible. The vast majority of Hunters Capital commercial-office tenants report that they and \n19  their employees are simply unable to come to work at all.  \n20  133.  Hunters Capitalโs tenants have already begun to leave because of CHOP, and others \n21  cannot  pay  rent.  Every  day  that  passes  more  of  the  companyโs  tenants  leave  the  area,  at \n22  considerable loss to Hunters Capital. Further, there is no interest from prospective tenants. As long \n23  as CHOP remains, nearly no one is interested in relocating to the Capitol Hill neighborhood. \n24  134.  Plaintiff Olive ST Apartments. Olive ST Apartments is another small business on \n25  Capitol Hill that is struggling because of CHOP. Olive ST Apartments owns two apartment \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 35    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 36 of 56\n \n1  buildings close to Cal Anderson Park. Previously a desirable location for renters, life for Olive ST \n2  Apartmentsโ tenants has now become unlivable. The tenants have been terrified by CHOP \n3  participants carrying guns, in additional to the rampant violence, harassment, and vandalism in the \n4  area caused by CHOP. Olive ST Apartmentsโ owner has been videotaped and harassed while trying \n5  to move a garbage dumpster several blocks outside of CHOP just so the garbage could get picked \n6  up.  \n7  135.  Due to safety concerns, Olive ST Apartments has been forced to hire private \n8  security. Nevertheless, Olive ST Apartmentsโ buildings have been covered with graffiti multiple \n9  times. The company has tried cleaning the graffiti off, only for its buildings to be vandalized again. \n10  On several occasions, CHOP participants have attempted to break into its buildings, once breaking \n11  the lock box for mail. Olive ST Apartments has called the police, but the police told Olive ST \n12  Apartmentsโ security guard that they would not send anyone to the area.  \n13  136.  The noise, including from Cal Anderson Park, has also made conditions for Olive \n14  ST Apartmentsโ tenants unlivable. The company receives constant complaints about the noise at \n15  all times of day and night, including gun shots. Tenants have left to avoid the noise.   \n16  137.  In addition to ceding the nearby Cal Anderson Park to CHOP, the City has \n17  supported the CHOP participants near Olive ST Apartments by providing them with barricades, \n18  lights, toilets, handwashing stations, and fire extinguishers. The City allows CHOP participants to \n19  use bright lights at Cal Anderson Park to facilitate CHOP activities there, causing a nuisance to \n20  Olive ST Apartmentsโ tenants.  \n21  138.  Given  the  unlivable  conditions,  it  is  impossible  for  the  company  to  rent  its \n22  apartments. Tenants are already moving out because of the nearby presence of CHOP. No new \n23  renters have interest in moving to the area. Each day CHOP continues, Olive ST Apartments incurs \n24  further harm and economic loss.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 36    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 37 of 56\n \n1  139.  Plaintiff  Redside  Partners.  Plaintiff  Redside  Partners  performs  real-estate \n2  management services to buildings near CHOP. Its business is also being hurt by CHOP. Redside \n3  Partners employees have reported that they do not feel safe coming to work, as the companyโs \n4  offices are near Cal Anderson Park. The companyโs employees report widespread lawlessness, \n5  including vandalism, graffiti, and public drug use affecting the buildings the company manages. \n6  CHOP participants have trespassed on Redside Partnersโs properties, including climbing up fire \n7  escapes to get on building roof tops. Redside Partners has complained to the City but has received \n8  no response.  \n9  140.  Capitol Hillโs real-estate companies like Plaintiffs Madrona Real Estate, Hunters \n10  Capital, and Redside Partners have invested millions of dollars over the years to turn Capitol Hill \n11  into a desirable location, with modern condos, restaurants, and shops. They have made investments \n12  in new, state-of-the-art buildings and the restoration of many historic buildings. Over the last \n13  several decades, they have helped transform Capitol Hill into one of the nationโs most vibrant and \n14  architecturally attractive neighborhoods, a diverse melting pot for both local residents as well as \n15  tourists, with the Cityโs best boutique shopping, dining, socializing, and urban living. It has \n16  fostered a livable community for many new residents and a superstructure for many thriving small \n17  businesses, which employ thousands of employees from a diverse set of backgrounds. The \n18  immense value and wealth this has created, for Plaintiffs, the Capitol Hill community, and Seattle \n19  more generally is actively being destroyed by the Cityโs actions. \n20  D.  The City Has Actively Supported and Encouraged CHOP the CHOP Participants. \n21  141.  In the face of all this destruction, City leaders, including Mayor Durkan, have \n22  embraced the existence, message, and methods of CHOP and CHOP Participants. They have done \n23  this with physical support and extensive verbal support and encouragement that has expressly \n24  endorsed the barricading and occupation of City streets and parks.   \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 37    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 38 of 56\n \n1  142.  Since the day that the City abandoned the East Precinct, the City has had full \n2  knowledge of the problems created for businesses and residents in and around CHOP, including \n3  property damage, lack of police response, the inability for workers and residents to enter and leave \n4  the area, the inability for businesses to receive deliveries, and other adverse impacts on residents, \n5  businesses, and property owners in the area. The City has nevertheless adopted a policy supporting \n6  the CHOP occupation, acting with deliberate indifference toward those suffering harms from it. \n7  Evidence of the Cityโs knowledge includes the following: \n8  a.  At a June 11, 2020 press conference with Mayor Durkan, Chief Best made \n9  it clear that the City was fully aware that its 9-1-1 response times had tripled and that \n10  there was a serious public-safety crisis for anyone who lives or works in CHOP. \n11  b.  On June 16, 2020, the City stated, via a press release from the Mayorโs \n12  office: \n \n13 \nBeginning last Tuesday, City officials have been on site on Capitol \nHill  to  work  [to]  meet  community  needs  including \n14 \nhygiene, sanitation and safety. Utilities including Puget Sound \nEnergy and SPU have been able to respond to the area for service. \n15 \nSeattle Police Chief Carmen Best has visited the site multiple \n16  times. Over the past week, conversations continued between City \nofficials,  organizers  onsite  for  the  CHOP, residents and \n17  businesses. โฆ Every day, Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins, \nSeattle Department of Transportation Director Sam Zimbabwe, \n18  and Seattle Public Utilities General Manager Mami Hara have \nbeen  on  site.  On  Sunday,  they held  a  meeting with  onsite \n19 \norganizers, small businesses, and residents to discuss proposed \nchanges to the protest zone. \n20 \nc.  On information and belief, Mayor Durkan and the SPD have been inundated \n21 \nwith complaints about CHOP that describe in detail the extensive property damage, \n22 \nrestricted access, and economic loss that residents, businesses, and property owners are \n23 \nsuffering. \n24 \nd.  In  response  to  at  least  some  requests  from  desperate  businesses  and \n25 \nresidents for her to cease her support of CHOP, Mayor Durkanโs office has provided a \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 38    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 39 of 56\n \n1  stock response acknowledging that the City is โmaintainingโ a space for CHOP, \n2  including by, for example, providing a โsturdier concrete barrierโ to help CHOP block \n3  a public street. The stock response states in part as follows: \n \n4 \nThank you for reaching out.  \n \n5 \nThe Capitol Hill Organized Protest has emerged as a gathering \nplace where community members can demand change of their \n6 \nlocal,  state,  and  federal  government.  Capitol  Hill  and  Cal \n7  Anderson Park have long been a gathering place for justice. While \nthere have been inaccurate and misleading depictions of the CHOP \n8  from the President and some national media, the City believes first \namendment activities can continue while also maintaining public \n9  safety  and  allowing  access  for  residents  and  businesses  who \noperate in the area. Mayor Durkan believes these changes can help \n10 \nensure any focus of the CHOP and Cal Anderson will allow for \npeaceful demonstrations to continue. \n11 \n  \nBeginning last Tuesday, City officials have been on site on Capitol \n12 \nHill  to  work  [to]  meet  community  needs  including  hygiene, \n13  sanitation and safety. Utilities including Puget Sound Energy and \nSPU have been able to respond to the area for service. Seattle \n14  Police Chief Carmen Best has visited the site multiple times. Over \nthe past week, conversations continued between City officials, \n15  organizers onsite for the CHOP, residents and businesses. The \nCity is committed to maintaining space for community to come to \n16 \ntogether, protest and exercise their first amendment rights. Minor \nchanges to the protest zone will implement safer and sturdier \n17 \nbarriers to protect individuals in this area, allow traffic to move \nthroughout  the  Capitol  Hill  neighborhood,  ease  access  for \n18 \nresidents of apartment building in the surrounding areas, and help \n19  local businesses manage deliveries and logistics. Additionally all \nplans have been crafted with the goal of allowing access for \n20  emergency personnel including fire trucks. \n \n21 \nEvery  day,  Seattle  Fire  Chief  Harold  Scoggins,  Seattle \nDepartment  of  Transportation  Director  Sam  Zimbabwe,  and \n22 \nSeattle Public Utilities General Manager Marni Hara have been on \nsite. On Sunday, they held a meeting with onsite organizers, small \n23 \nbusinesses,  and  residents  to  discuss  proposed  changes  to  the \nprotest zone. In coordination with protesters onsite, work began at \n24 \n6:30 a.m. on Tuesday to remove a tent barrier at 10th and Pine and \n25  replace it with a sturdier concrete barrier to improve public safety. \nThe  City  has  successfully  worked  with  protesters  onsite  to \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 39    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 40 of 56\n \nreconfigure the CHOP to allow for public safety and better access \n1 \nfor the local  community.  That  has  involved  rerouting  traffic, \nfreeing up alley access, opened streets, and replacing makeshift \n2 \nbarriers with heavy concrete barriers that can be painted. \n3 \ne.  In addition to the numerous City officers listed above, Mayor Durkan \n4 \nherself has personally visited CHOP and has seen what is happening. In an interview given \n5 \nin her City offices on Facebook Live on June 12, 2020, Mayor Durkan made clear that she \n6 \nhad seen the barriers and talked to CHOP participants and apparently approved of them \n7 \nusing an individual with behavioral health issues to enforce the perimeter: โItโs interesting, \n8 \nwhen I was at the CHAZ, walking around, similar kind of philosophy, because thereโs this \n9 \none guy, some behavioral health issues, and it was like, look, he has some hard times, and \n10 \nhe helps on that barricade over there, and then when he starts having a hard time, we just \n11 \nbring him over here, take care of him, feed him. And thatโs what you gotta do, right?โ3 \n12 \nf.  On June 22, 2020, Mayor Durkan stated at a press conference: \n13 \n \n14  Over the days, tens of thousands of people have peacefully gathered \nor visited Capitol Hill. During the day, there have been no major \n15 \nincidents. But we know it is very different at night, particularly in \nrecent nights. The cumulative impacts of the gatherings and protests \n16 \nand the nighttime atmosphere and violence has led to increasingly \ndifficult circumstances for our businesses and residents. Most of \n17 \nthem supported protestersโ right to gather at the outset. They stand \n18  with them in solidarity. But the impacts have increased, and the \nsafety has decreased. Both on Saturday morning and last night there \n19  were  incidents  of  gun  violence.  And  that  escalating  violence \nconcerns me, Chief Best, residents, businesses, and the greater \n20  community. All of Capitol Hill has been impacted.  \n \n21 \n3 https://www.facebook.com/WWConverge/videos/250593506242797/?__tn__=kC-\nR&eid=ARBT9Zl4Zd0BnqFUyG1bgaapWeIo6meLrp9YI7QgilK36tLAFfNcpij4zHFTEwP0wNzoVQK7O1LPtpa8\n22 \n&hc_ref=ARTeZJ-\nMVhRABE0ZxnSxzApxaoAJVsmqCzhgB7vaP0wwkcuhf0CtwXnjqpvqfAIKLQk&__xts__[0]=68.ARDhXBScmD\n23  _P9GnI4X2NL4z0eUgRkuV8hj_BUWpBgtqxg133nAdZz00w2pqmYlrfVrVanpZgUlgy2rw9hbGAwTWLjcxp1fAP\nAVjYhDHpvEOpeSmJavdPNPPlK_wodfv_idPwOeVfsbgsB04YjUKfXfnUZvddSThmUspA_o5oqETWWFluP2o_\n24  Yh-\ntP64swtkdKoXl374Vd0zqTxRoapQChSzCt5dXToGlW6ESVGiUVQznk42YXs8U2lpzAwJmp99RXyrNW3fSYzU\n25  cPopUKTNN-\nKP7EBDNdje9UibYcP84111ipRk31bjIk5XrSRcU2rjmqzsd_KjoOwrpoHYKssQd5Vnwe6OvBXCSGW_4ctaQKX\nmwUcmaTA \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 40    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 41 of 56\n \n1  g.  At the same June 22, 2020 press conference, Chief Best stated that reports \n2  to the police demonstrate that some CHOP participants are โengaging in shootings, a rape, \n3  assaults, burglary, arson, and property destruction, and I have their police reports right here. \n4  Iโm not making it up. These things have happened.โ \n5  143.  Despite having knowledge of exactly what is happening at CHOP by being there \n6  every day and in apparently constant contact with area residents and business owners, the City has \n7  acted with deliberate indifference toward the safety and property interests of those residents and \n8  businesses.  \n9  144.  The City has not restored regular policing to the area in or around CHOP or \n10  improved 9-1-1 response in or around CHOP. \n11  145.  The City has also enabled the blocking of ingress and egress for businesses and \n12  residents in the area, without providing plaintiffs any notice of this deprivation or opportunity to \n13  be  heard  on  the  matter.  Reportedly,  the  City  reached  an  informal  agreement  with  CHOP \n14  participants to allow limited one-way access on Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues starting on June \n15  16, 2020 (Plaintiffs were not invited to participate in these negotiations). However, as part of that \n16  agreement, the City actually fortified the rest of CHOP with new barriers (again without providing \n17  Plaintiffs notice or an opportunity to be heard on the matter). And even the planned limited access \n18  for  some  streets  almost  immediately  broke  down  when  CHOP  participants  reestablished \n19  impediments. The Cityโs response to this was apparently to do nothing. \n20  146.  At the same time that the City has acted with deliberate indifference to property \n21  owners and people who live and work in and near CHOP, the City has physically aided, endorsed, \n22  and actively encouraged CHOP participants to continue their occupation of public spaces. \n23  147.  The City has physically aided CHOP participants in their occupation of the area in \n24  at least the following ways: \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 41    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 42 of 56\n \n1  a.  When the City abandoned the East Precinct on June 8, 2020, it left behind \n2  the barriers that had previously blocked street access and protected the East Precinct from \n3  protesters. These barriers foreseeably served as the raw materials that allowed CHOP \n4  participants to block streets and create CHOP within a very short time. \n5  b.  On June 16, 2020, the City provided even more concrete barriers to CHOP \n6  participants so that CHOP participants could replace wooden barriers and fortify their \n7  blockages of streets.4 \n8  c.  The City has provided portable toilets for CHOP participants that are \n9  regularly serviced. \n10  d.  The  City  has  provided  medical  equipment,  including  beds  and  other \n11  supplies, to the CHOP โmedical tent.โ \n12  148.  The  Cityโs  policies  have  effectively  authorized  the  actions  of  the  CHOP \n13  participants. The City has communicated clearly to CHOP participants that they may indefinitely \n14  continue occupying the streets in the area, maintaining their barricades, and blocking traffic, all \n15  without interference from the City. The City has communicated this message in at least the \n16  following ways: \n17  a.  On June 11, 2020, during a joint press conference with the Chief of Police, \n18  Mayor Durkan stated: โThereโs not a specific date โฆ because we are trying to do things \n19  that are responsible.โ \n20  b.  On June 12, 2020, in response to a direct question from CNNโs Chris \n21  Cuomo about how long the City would allow CHOP participants to continue to occupy the \n22  neighborhood, Mayor Durkan responded, โI donโt know. We could have the Summer of \n23  Love.โ \n24 \n25 \n \n4 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 42    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 43 of 56\n \n1  c.  On June 16, 2020, the City announced through an official statement from \n2  Mayor Durkan that it had negotiated with CHOP participants to adjust some but not all \n3  their barriers to allow one-way traffic on Twelfth Avenue.5 This agreement was an \n4  endorsement  of  CHOP  participantsโ  other  barriers  and  its  overall  occupation  of  the \n5  neighborhood. \n6  d.  In announcing the supposed opening of a one-way corridor, the City made \n7  clear in a statement from the Mayor that it was an active participant in maintaining and \n8  solidifying CHOP barriers and boundaries:   \n \n9 \nThe City is committed to maintaining space for community to come \ntogether, protest and exercise their first amendment rights. Minor \n10 \nchanges to the protest  zone will implement safer and sturdier \nbarriers to protect individuals in this area, allow traffic to move \n11 \nthroughout the Capitol Hill neighborhood, ease access for residents \n12  of apartment building in the surrounding areas, and help local \nbusinesses manage deliveries and logistics. [emphasis added]6 \n13 \ne.  Also on June 16, 2020, Mayor Durkan suggested that the City agreed that \n14 \npolice officers will only enter the occupied area for โsignificant life-safety issues.โ7  \n15 \nf.  On  June  22,  2020,  Mayor  Durkan  and  Chief  Best  held  a  joint  press \n16 \nconference in which they expressed concern about the impacts of CHOP but also suggested \n17 \nthat there was no specific timeline or plan for lessening those impacts or removing the \n18 \nblockades, barriers, and tents from CHOP. \n19 \n149.  The City has also made numerous statements indicating that it endorses and will \n20 \ncontinue to support what CHOP participants are doing in the area, thereby ensuring the continued \n21 \nand indefinite occupation and blockading of the neighborhood, and all the damage it has caused \n22 \nand will cause. The Cityโs statements include at least the following: \n23 \n24 \n \n25  5 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n6 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n7 https://durkan.seattle.gov/2020/06/city-of-seattle-responds-to-the-capitol-hill-organized-protest/ \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 43    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 44 of 56\n \n1  a.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan posted following on her Twitter page: \n2  โThe Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone #CHAZ is not a lawless wasteland of anarchist \n3  insurrection โ it is a peaceful expression of our communityโs collective grief and their \n4  desire to build a better world.โ \n5  b.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan also posted on her Twitter page: โFor the \n6  thousands of individuals who have been on Capitol Hill, I think youโve seen what Iโve \n7  seen: the painting of Black Lives Matter along Pine Street, food trucks, spaghetti potlucks, \n8  teach-ins, and movies.โ \n9  c.  On June 11, 2020, Mayor Durkan stated during a joint press conference with \n10  the Chief of Police:   \n \n11 \nLawfully gathering and expressing first Amendment rights, and \ndemanding we do better as a society, and providing true equity for \n12 \ncommunities of color, is not terrorism. It is patriotism. The right to \nchallenge government and authority is fundamental to who we are \n13 \nas Americans. โฆ And for the thousands of individuals whoโve been \n14  on Capitol Hill, many of them, what youโll see is a painting of \nBlack  Lives  Matter  along  Pine  Street.

Also on June 12, 2020, during her interview with CNNโs Chris Cuomo, \n6  Mayor Durkan said, โWeโve got four blocks in Seattle that just saw pictures of that is \n7  more like a block party atmosphere. Itโs not an armed takeover. Itโs not a military junta. \n8  We will โ we will make sure that we can restore this. But we have block parties and \n9  the like in this part of Seattle all the time. Itโs known for that.โ  \n10  g.  On June 12, 2020, Mayor Durkan endorsed the gardens being planted in Cal \n11  Anderson Park on Twitter: โEarlier today I visited the #CHAZ and met Marcus \n12  Henderson, the person behind the new community garden popping up in Cal Anderson \n13  Park. Read more about Marcus and the work thatโs gone into creating the gardens: \n14  thestanger.com/slog/2020/06/1.โ \n15  h.

Mayor Durkan tweeted on June 16, 2020: โThe #CHOP has emerged as a \n20  gathering place for community to demand change of their local, state, and federal \n21  government.โ \n22  j.

On June 21, 2020, after two people were shot in CHOP and one of theme \n2  died, Mayor Durkan issued a statement indicating that the City still had no plans to \n3  cease supporting CHOP and that the City was instead acting to work with and preserve \n4  CHOP. \n5  V.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n6  150.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of similarly situated persons pursuant to Fed. R. \n7  Civ. Proc. 23(b)(2) and/or 23(b)(3). \n8  151.  The Class is hereby defined as follows: All persons or entities who own property \n9  in, have a business in, or reside in the area in the City of Seattle bounded by the following streets: \n10  Denny Way, Union Street, Thirteenth Avenue, and East Broadway. This definition excludes the \n11  City of Seattle and any departments or agencies of the City of Seattle, including the Seattle Police \n12  Department. \n13  152.  The definition of the Class is unambiguous. Plaintiffs are members of the Class, \n14  and all members of the Class can be identified through public records and notified by mail or other \n15  means of notification. \n16  153.  The number of Class members makes joinder impractical. Plaintiffs do not know \n17  the exact number of members in the Class, but believe the total number of businesses, residents, \n18  and property owners in the Class to be in the thousands. \n19  154.  There  are  numerous  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  the  Class  that \n20  predominate over any individual issues. These issues include the following: \n21  a.  Whether the City has participated in, endorsed, or encouraged the creation, \n22  maintenance, and continued existence of CHOP. \n23  b.  All facts regarding the existence and maintenance of CHOP including at least \n24  the following: \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 46    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 47 of 56\n \n1  i.  The boundaries and nature of the SPDโs โno-goโ zone in and \n2  around CHOP. \n3  ii.  All  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  the  Cityโs \n4  participation in, endorsement of, or encouragement of the \n5  creation, maintenance, and continued existence of CHOP. \n6  iii.  The nature and scope of activities of CHOP participants. \n7  c.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class have legally protected constitutional property \n8  rights. \n9  d.  Whether the City has infringed on those property rights by its actions with \n10  regard to CHOP. \n11  e.  Whether the City was required to provide notice and a hearing to Class \n12  members before infringing on those property rights. \n13  f.  Whether CHOP and CHOP participants are a nuisance within the meaning of \n14  RCW 7.48.010, et seq. \n15  g.  Whether the City has participated in the maintenance of that nuisance. \n16  h.  Whether the City has acted with deliberate indifference toward Plaintiffs and \n17  the Class. \n18  i.  Whether the harm suffered by Plaintiffs and the Class was foreseeable and \n19  obvious. \n20  j.  Whether the Cityโs actions constitute an unlawful gift within the meaning of \n21  the Washington Constitution. \n22  k.  Whether  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  have  suffered  a  taking  without  just \n23  compensation. \n24  l.  Whether the Cityโs actions were pursuant to a City policy. \n25  m. Whether the Cityโs actions were ratified by a City policymaker.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 47    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 48 of 56\n \n1  n.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to injunctive relief. \n2  155.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the members of the Class. All Plaintiffs \n3  reside in the Class and have been subject to the same course of conduct by the City. \n4  156.  The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the Class. Plaintiffs are all \n5  members of the Class and have there are no conflicts between Plaintiffs and other Class members. \n6  Plaintiffs are well-informed as to the nature of this case and the claims against the City and have \n7  retained competent and experienced counsel that intend to prosecute this action vigorously. \n8  157.  The City has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to all Plaintiffs \n9  and the Class such that injunctive relief is appropriate respecting the Class as a whole. \n10  158.  The issues that Class members have in common predominate over any individual \n11  issues. The City engaged in a common course of conduct giving rise to the harms suffered by \n12  Plaintiffs and the Class. A single, common policy is at issue in this case. Individual questions, if \n13  any, pale by comparison to the numerous common questions that dominate. The injuries sustained \n14  by the Class members flow, in each instance, from a common nucleus of operative facts. \n15  159.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \n16  adjudication of this controversy because joinder of all class members is impracticable. The \n17  prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would impose heavy burdens \n18  upon the courts and the City and would create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications of the \n19  questions of law and fact common to the Class. A class action would achieve substantial economies \n20  of time, effort, and expense, and would assure uniformity of decision as to persons similarly \n21  situated without sacrificing procedural fairness. Individual litigation of the legal and factual issues \n22  raised by the conduct of the City would increase delay and expense to all parties and to the court \n23  system. The class action device presents far fewer management difficulties and provides the \n24  benefits of a single, uniform adjudication, economies of scale and comprehensive supervision by \n25  a single court. Given the similar nature of the claims of the members of the Class and the uniform \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 48    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 49 of 56\n \n1  application of Washington and federal law to the claims of Plaintiffs and the members of the Class, \n2  the Classโs claims can and will be most effectively managed by a class action. \n3  VI.  CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n4  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION โ PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n5  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n6  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n7  160.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint as if set forth herein. \n8  161.  Plaintiffs and the Class have constitutionally protected property rights, as defined \n9  by Washington state law, to exclude others from their property, to the use and quiet enjoyment of \n10  their property, and to access their property via public rights-of-way.  \n11  162.  The  City  has  infringed  on  those  rights,  including  by  (1) creating,  assisting, \n12  endorsing, and encouraging an indefinite, unpermitted occupation and blockade of the public \n13  streets, sidewalks, and parks in and around CHOP, thereby denying Plaintiffs access to their \n14  properties, and (2) creating, assisting, endorsing, and encouraging the pervasive vandalism and \n15  trespasses against Plaintiffsโ properties, thereby denying Plaintiffs the ability to use their properties \n16  and exclude others from them.  \n17  163.  The City has infringed on Plaintiffsโ constitutionally protected rights without \n18  providing Plaintiffs with any due process before depriving them of these rights, or providing any \n19  recourse following the deprivation of the rights. In particular, the City provided Plaintiffs with no \n20  notice or opportunity to be heard before or after denying the Plaintiffs of their rights to access their \n21  properties, use their properties, and exclude others from their properties.  \n22  164.  The City has done so pursuant to City policy as created, ratified, and authorized by \n23  City policymakers, including Mayor Durkan, without any notice to Plaintiffs or opportunity for \n24  them to be heard.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 49    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 50 of 56\n \n1  165.  As a direct result of the Cityโs actions, Plaintiffs and the Class have been denied \n2  regular and customary use of, access to, and enjoyment of their property, including the ability to \n3  drive or park in CHOP, the ability to walk to their homes or business without obstruction, the \n4  ability to accept deliveries to their homes or business, the ability to prevent and remedy vandalism, \n5  and the ability to prevent trespasses and theft against their properties.  \n6  166.  Plaintiffs and the Class have been harmed by this deprivation, including through \n7  loss of revenue, loss of property value, damages to property, and other damages.  \n8  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION โ NUISANCE \n9  RCW 7.48.010 et seq. \n10  For injunctive relief only \n11  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n12  167.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint as if set forth fully \n13  herein. \n14  168.  As a direct result of the Cityโs actions, foot and vehicular traffic on the public \n15  streets, sidewalks, and other right of ways surrounding Plaintiffsโ businesses and residences are \n16  physically blocked and/or impeded. \n17  169.  The blocking and impeding of foot and vehicular traffic has substantially and \n18  unreasonably interfered with Plaintiffsโ use and enjoyment of their properties, including by \n19  blocking access to those properties, and has caused harm to Plaintiffs, including by reducing \n20  property values and resulting in lost revenues. \n21  170.  The City has directly participated in the creation and maintenance of this nuisance, \n22  including by providing concrete barriers to be used for this specific purpose to the CHOP \n23  participants.  \n24  171.  In addition to blocking public rights-of-way, the Cityโs actions have created and \n25  maintained a series of unlawful and/or unreasonable conditions throughout the CHOP area, \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 50    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 51 of 56\n \n1  including excessive noise, public safety hazards, vandalism, and poor health and sanitation \n2  conditions.  \n3  172.  These conditions have annoyed, injured, and endangered the comfort, repose, \n4  health, and safety of Plaintiffs, and rendered Plaintiffs insecure in the use of their properties.  \n5  173.  These conditions have substantially and unreasonably interfered with Plaintiffsโ use \n6  and enjoyment of their properties, including by creating a reasonable fear among Plaintiffs of using \n7  their properties, and have caused harm to Plaintiffs, including by reducing property values, \n8  inflicting property damage, and resulting in lost revenues. \n9  174.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the City to remove these nuisances on behalf of themselves \n10  and the Class. \n11  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION โ SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n12  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n13  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n14  175.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint as if set forth fully \n15  herein. \n16  176.  Plaintiffs have a right pursuant to substantive due process to be protected from \n17  state-created dangers. \n18  177.  The City โs actions, assistance, endorsements, and encouragements of CHOP and \n19  CHOP participants have greatly increased the likelihood of property damage, loss of business \n20  revenue and rental income, personal injury, loss of use of property, and other damages to Plaintiffs. \n21  178.  All  damages  suffered,  and  still  to  be  suffered,  by  Plaintiffs  were  and  are \n22  foreseeable.  \n23  179.  The City has acted with deliberate indifference to the known and obvious harm that \n24  would be suffered by Plaintiffs. \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 51    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 52 of 56\n \n1  180.  The City has done so pursuant to City policy as created and ratified by City \n2  policymakers, including Mayor Durkan. \n3  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION โ UNLAWFUL GIFT \n4  Article VIII, Section 7 of Washington State Constitution \n5  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n6  181.  Article VIII, Section 7 of the Washington State Constitution provides: โNo county, \n7  city, town or other municipal corporation shall hereafter give any money, or property, or loan its \n8  money, or credit to or in aid of any individual, association, company or corporation, except for the \n9  necessary support of the poor and infirm, or become directly or indirectly the owner of any stock \n10  in or bonds of any association, company or corporation.โ \n11  182.  In direct violation of Article VIII, Section 7, the City has given away an interest in \n12  public property without consideration and with donative intent to CHOP participants.  \n13  183.  In particular, the City has ceded to CHOP the publicโs property interests in Cal \n14  Anderson Park, the Seattle Police Department East Precinct building, multiple concrete barriers, \n15  and the public streets and thoroughfares of the area occupied by CHOP participants.  \n16  184.  The City has granted CHOP participants the right to occupy and use these public \n17  properties without interference and to the exclusion of others, in direct contradiction to local law \n18  and ordinances. For example, CHOP participants have established themselves in tent encampments \n19  and have set up permanent occupation on public premises, including Cal Anderson Park. The City \n20  has also given control of the former Seattle Police Department East Precinct, which CHOP \n21  participants have renamed. Further CHOP participants have excluded members of the public from \n22  public use of Cal Anderson Park and has excluded, even under the threat of violence, SPD from \n23  making use of the East Precinct to provide police services in the area.   \n24  185.  They City and the Mayor have actively supported and abetted the takeover of public \n25  property by CHOP, through active encouragement, endorsement, and material support to CHOP \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 52    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 53 of 56\n \n1  participants. The Cityโs actions have resulted in the effective transfer of the publicโs property right \n2  to CHOP, through granting CHOP exclusive use of this property. Further, the City and Mayorโs \n3  active encouragement indicates the intent of gifting this public property indefinitely for CHOPโs \n4  solely private use, without any rent or benefit to the City or public. \n5  186.  The purpose of Article VIII, Section 7 is to prevent public property from being used \n6  to benefit private interests where the public interest is not primarily served. The CHOP movement \n7  is a private movement with private ideological motives, distinct from the public at large. Indeed, \n8  CHOP participants stationed at the boundaries of the CHOP zone have actively prevented some \n9  members of the public from entering.  \n10  187.  On information and belief, the City has received no remuneration or other benefit \n11  in exchange for ceding the right to exclusively occupy public property to CHOP. The City has \n12  therefore ceded interest in public property to private individuals without any consideration.  \n13  188.  Because the City has received no consideration or remuneration from CHOP \n14  participants for the rights to use public property, the intent of the City has been to donate to CHOP \n15  participants a private benefit, not conferred on other members of the public more broadly.  \n16  189.  Not only is the public interest not served, the Cityโs gift of public property has \n17  actively harmed the public, especially the residents of Capitol Hill. CHOP participants have used \n18  their newly gifted rights in public property ceded to them by the City as a staging ground for acts \n19  of vandalism and trespass against adjacent private property, including the properties of the \n20  Plaintiffs. The CHOP encampments in Cal Anderson Park have also facilitated acts of assault, \n21  violence, and harassment against private residents and business employees in the surrounding area. \n22  The presence of CHOP on public property ceded by the City has also had a negative economic \n23  impact, in the form of reduced property values and lost business revenues, in the Capital Hill \n24  neighborhood.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 53    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 54 of 56\n \n1  190.  As a direct and foreseeable result of the City gifting an interest in public property \n2  to CHOP, Plaintiffsโ injuries include but are not limited to: (i) deprivation of their use of that public \n3  property in Capitol Hill; (ii) the loss of police protection previously provided through the East \n4  Precinct; (iii) limitation on access to their private property; (iv) vandalism and trespass to their \n5  private property by CHOP participants; (v) damage to property; (vi) a loss in property value; (vii) \n6  a loss of business revenue; (viii) and/or other economic loss. These harms have been caused by \n7  CHOP participants residing in Cal Anderson Park and other public property ceded to them by the \n8  City.  \n9  191.  Plaintiffs have standing to assert a violation of Article VIII, Section 7 because \n10  Plaintiffs are property owners, residents, and/or business owners in the areas near Cal Anderson \n11  Park and the East Precinct. The Cityโs gift of public property has adversely affected their interest \n12  in their adjacent private property, businesses, and/or residences, as described above. Alternatively, \n13  Plaintiffs have standing to assert a violation of Article VIII, Section 7 because Plaintiffs are all \n14  taxpayers of the City of Seattle.  \n15  192.  Plaintiffs are currently being adversely affected, and will continue to be adversely \n16  affected, by the Cityโs gift of public property to CHOP in violation of Article VIII, Section 7 of \n17  the Washington State Constitution, unless that unlawful gifting is restrained by this Court. \n18  FIFTH OF ACTION โ TAKING \n19  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n20  On behalf of Plaintiffs and the Class \n21  193.  Plaintiffs incorporate all other allegations in this complaint. \n22  194.  Plaintiffs and the Class have constitutionally protected property rights to use and \n23  enjoy their properties, to exclude others from their properties, and to access their properties via \n24  public rights-of-way.  \n25 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT - 54    LAW OFFICES \nCALFO EAKES LLP \n  1301 SECOND AVENUE, SUITE 2800 \nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON 98101 \nTEL, (206) 407-2200   FAX, (206) 407-2224 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983   Document 1   Filed 06/24/20   Page 55 of 56\n \n1  195.  The City has deprived Plaintiffs of those rights by affirmatively creating, assisting, \n2  endorsing, and encouraging an indefinite, unpermitted invasion, occupation, and blockade of the \n3  public rights-of-way that provide access to Plaintiffsโ private properties, as well as by affirmatively \n4  creating,  assisting,  endorsing,  and  encouraging  the  physical  invasion  of  Plaintiffsโ  private \n5  properties by CHOP participants.  \n6  196.  The City has done so pursuant to City policy as created and ratified by City \n7  policymakers, including Mayor Durkan. \n8  197.  Plaintiffs have not received compensation for the deprivation of their property \n9  rights. \n10  198.  The Cityโs actions constitute an unlawful taking for private use and/or an unlawful \n11  taking for public use without just compensation, which has caused Plaintiffs economic harm, \n12  including through a loss of property value, loss of business revenue, and a loss of investment-\n13  backed expectations. \n14  VII.  JURY DEMAND \n15  Plaintiffs demand a trial by jury.  \n16  VIII.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \n18  A.  Judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant for actual damages in an \n19  amount to be proven at trial; \n20  B.  Prejudgment interest at the maximum rate allowed by law; \n21  C.

INTRODUCTION \n11  Plaintiffs seek to hold the City responsible for the acts of private parties in and around the \n12  Capitol Hill Organized Protest (โCHOPโ).1 However, the City is not liable for those private acts and \n13  the complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law. The City took measured, appropriate steps to \n14  rapidly unfolding events in responding to the CHOP. As has been widely reported, the City supported \n15  the exercise of First Amendment rights by peaceful protesters in public streets and a park in the \n16  Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.2 Plaintiffs \n17  expressly โsupport the free-speech rights of many of those who gathered on Capitol Hillโ but are \n18  unclear about whose free-speech rights they do not support.  Complaint at ยถ1. As the amended \n19 \n \n1 The CHOP has also been referred to as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest and the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone \n20 \n(โCHAZโ). \n2 โThe protections afforded by the First Amendment are nowhere stronger than in streets and parks, both categorized for \n21  First Amendment purposes as traditional public fora. In such fora, the government's right โto limit expressive activity [is] \nsharply circumscribed.โ Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 45, 103 S.Ct. 948. Among traditional public fora, public parks โฆ \nare especially important locales for communication among the citizenry, as they have immemorially been held in trust for \n22 \nthe use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between \ncitizens, and discussing public questions.โ Berger v. City of Seattle, 569 F.3d 1029, 1035โ36 (9th Cir. 2009) (some \n23  citations, quotations, and footnotes omitted). \n \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S. Holmes \nSeattle City Attorney \nCERTIFICATION - 2 \n701 5th Avenue, Suite 2050 \n2:20-CV-00983  Seattle, WA 98104-7095 \n \n(206) 684-8200\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 11   Filed 07/23/20   Page 3 of 21\n \n1  complaint acknowledges, when opportunistic criminal and other activity in and around the CHOP \n2  overshadowed important free speech activity, the City cleared the CHOP.  \n3  Plaintiffs allege they were deprived of their rights to due process and equal protection and that \n4  they suffered takings of their property because the City did not act sooner to clear the CHOP. They \n5  bring federal claims under 42 USC ยง1983. However, plaintiffs fail to state any claims upon which \n6  relief may be granted.  \n7  Governments are not required to prevent third-party conduct, including criminal conduct, \n8  absent rare exceptions to the rule not presented here. Although they attempt to blame the City for \n9  private acts, the conduct that the plaintiffs complain of is that of private parties who plaintiffs have \n10  not named in this suit. Their complaint also fails to comply with requirements for a damages class \n11  under FRCP 23. This Court should dismiss plaintiffsโ complaint with prejudice. If the Court does not \n12  dismiss the Complaint outright, it should deny class certification.    \n13  II.  FACTS \n14  As a purported class, plaintiffs allege that the City violated their civil rights by leaving the \n15  East Precinct building and not clearing the CHOP sooner. Complaint at ยถยถ3, 35-38.3 As required in a \n16  Rule 12(b)(6) motion, all well-pled factual allegations in the Complaint are treated as true for \n17  purposes of this motion.  They note that City barriers were used by protesters to block City streets \n18  and vehicular access to residences and buildings. Id. at ยถยถ4, 7. They allege that the City is responsible \n19  for the acts of those they allege are โCHOP participantsโ because the City โendorse[d], enable[d], and \n20 \n21 \n \n3 Plaintiffs suggest that the City cleared the CHOP in response to a threatened TRO motion from Plaintiffs. Although it \n22 \nhas no bearing on the motion before the Court, the City feels compelled to note that plaintiffs are mistaken. The City made \nits decision to clear the CHOP based on events in the CHOP, not this lawsuit. That the clearing of the CHOP was a success \n23  speaks to the Cityโs careful approach and operational planning and provides no support for the contention that there was \nundue delay on the Cityโs part.  \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

Id. ยถยถ8-9, 40-48, \n3  51-53. \n4  Plaintiffs complain that the Cityโs non-enforcement of laws led to pervasive crimes of \n5  vandalism by non-City actors. Id. at ยถ9. They allege that the Cityโs support for the Black Lives Matter \n6  movement and attempts to find a peaceful resolution to the CHOP amounts to an endorsement of \n7  criminal and other activity. Id. at ยถ10.  \n8  As a group, plaintiffs complain of a variety of harm, including graffiti, different provision of \n9  emergency services inside the CHOP than outside it, and loss of vehicular access to their property \n10  stemming from CHOP participantsโ use of barriers.  They complain that the City did not engage in \n11  regular policing within CHOP and declined to enforce criminal laws. Id. at ยถ174, 219. They allege \n12  the  City  โenabledโ  CHOP  participants  to  block  vehicular  access  and  physically  aided  CHOP \n13  participants by leaving barriers in the area, providing more barriers, and providing portable toilets \n14  and other equipment. ยถยถ177, 179. They further contend that the City โeffectively authorizedโ the \n15  actions of CHOP participants by allowing CHOP to exist for weeks.

ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES \n2  A.  Motion to Dismiss Standard \n3  Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) requires a court to determine โwhether the complaint's factual \n4  allegations, together with all reasonable inferences, state a plausible claim for relief.โ Cafasso, U.S. \n5  ex rel. v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys. Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Ashcroft v. \n6  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-78, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949โ50 (2009)). โA claim has facial plausibility when \n7  the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \n8  defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citation \n9  omitted). When determining the sufficiency of a claim, a court must โaccept factual allegations in the \n10  complaint  as  true  and  construe  the  pleadings  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  non-moving \n11  party.โ Fayer v. Vaughn, 649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks \n12  omitted). The court, however, need โnot assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because they \n13  are cast in the form of factual allegations.โ Id. โ[C]onclusory allegations of law and unwarranted \n14  inferences are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.โ Id.; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 \n15  S.Ct. at 1949 (โA pleading that offers labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements \n16  of a cause of action will not do.โ) (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \n17  B.  ยง1983 claims require allegations that the government directly caused harm: plaintiffsโ \ncomplaint does not allege such harm \n18   \nA municipality cannot be liable under ยง1983 on a respondeat superior theory. Rather, liability \n19 \nonly attaches where the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation through a โpolicy or \n20 \ncustom, whether made by its lawmakers or those whose edicts or acts may be fairly said to represent \n21 \nofficial policy.โ Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 \n22 \nL.Ed.2d 611 (1978).

Sery, 513 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n6  To maintain a claim under ยง1983, a Plaintiff must show that (1) the conduct complained of \n7  was committed by a person acting under color of state law, and that (2) the conduct deprived a person \n8  of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Parratt v. \n9  Taylor,  451  U.S.  527,  535,  101  S.Ct.  1908,  68  L.Ed.2d  420  (1981), overruled  on  other \n10  grounds, Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). โThe state-\n11  action element  in  ยง 1983 excludes  from  its  reach  merely  private  conduct,  no  matter  how \n12  discriminatory or wrongful.โ Caviness v. Horizon Cmty. Learning Ctr., Inc., 590 F.3d 806, 812 (9th \n13  Cir. 2010)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted ). It exists to โavoid[ ] imposing on the \n14  State,  its  agencies  or  officials,  responsibility  for  conduct  for  which  they  cannot  fairly  be \n15  blamed.โ Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 936, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). \n16  Here, while City officials were unmistakably supportive of peaceful protected speech and seriously \n17  concerned about accompanying criminal activity, even had they exhibited the total nonchalance about \n18  CHOP activities which Plaintiffsโ claim, โ[a]ction taken by private entities with the mere approval or \n19  acquiescence of the State is not state action.โ Caviness, 590 F.3d at 817. Regarding alleged failures \n20  to act, such omissions are not actionable under section 1983 unless they involve a failure to perform \n21  a legally required act. Lacey v. Maricopa County, 693 F.3d 896, 917 (9th Cir. 2012). \n22  Generally, a municipality is liable under Monell only if a municipal policy or custom was the \n23  โmoving forceโ behind the constitutional violation. See Galen v. County of Los Angeles, 477 F.3d \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S. Holmes \nSeattle City Attorney \nCERTIFICATION - 6 \n701 5th Avenue, Suite 2050 \n2:20-CV-00983  Seattle, WA 98104-7095 \n \n(206) 684-8200\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 11   Filed 07/23/20   Page 7 of 21\n \n1  652, 667 (9th Cir. 2007). There must be โa direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom \n2  and the alleged constitutional deprivation.โ City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. \n3  1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). In other words, there must be proximate cause. The Supreme Court \n4  has noted that โ[p]roximate cause is often explicated in terms of foreseeability or the scope of the risk \n5  created by the predicate conduct.โ Paroline v. United States, 572 U.S. 464, 134 S.Ct. 1710, 1719, 188 \n6  L.Ed.2d 714 (2014). โA requirement of proximate cause thus serves, inter alia, to preclude liability \n7  in situations where the causal link between conduct and result is so attenuated that the consequence \n8  is more aptly described as mere fortuity.โ Id. \n9  Plaintiffsโ attempt to draw connections between City acts and CHOP participant activity is \n10  not supported by the facts or the law. The City did nothing that directly exposed plaintiffs to harms. \n11  The harms that the plaintiffs allege occurred over a period of weeks, and plaintiffs have alleged โmere \n12  acquiescenceโ inadequate to support their claim.  See, e.g. Caviness, 590 F.3d at 812. There are no \n13  allegations that the City directly interacted with plaintiffs and left them in a worse position than the \n14  one they were in before the City interacted with them.  \n15  The plaintiffs simply do not, and cannot, allege that any City action directly injured them. \n16  Rather, they complain of City inaction. Under well-established case law, their Complaint falls short \n17  of raising any legally viable claim. Plaintiffs were not directly harmed by the Cityโs allowance of \n18  first-amendment activity, provision of sanitation services to protesters, attempts to improve safety in \n19  the area with barriers, and temporary departure from the East Precinct building. Rather, the harm they \n20  identify was caused by private actors, and Plaintiffs allege the City violated their rights by (1) not \n21  preventing such harm from occurring in the first place and (2) not preventing additional harm once \n22  the City was on notice such harm was occurring. As explained below, the City is not liable where it \n23 \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

Were it otherwise, the City would face liability for all crime \n2  that occurred within the City.  \n3  C.  The Due Process Clause does not require governments to exercise discretion to prevent \nprivate actors from harming others  \n4 \nโ[N]othing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the \nlife, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors. The Clause is \n5 \nphrased as a limitation on the State's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels \nof safety and security. It forbids the State itself to deprive individuals of life, liberty, or \n6 \nproperty without โdue process of law,โ but its language cannot fairly be extended to \nimpose an affirmative obligation on the State to ensure that those interests do not come \n7 \nto harm through other means.โ   \n \n8 \nDeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S. Ct. 998, 1003, 103 L. \n9 \nEd. 2d 249 (1989)(emphasis added). โAs a general rule, members of the public have no constitutional \n10 \nright to sue [public] employees who fail to protect them against harm inflicted by third parties.โ L.W. \n11 \nv. Grubbs, 974 F.2d 119, 121 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing DeShaney 489 U.S. at 197). This rule is rooted \n12 \nin the discretionary nature of law enforcement activity: \n13 \nThe deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion, even in the presence of seemingly \nmandatory legislative commands, is illustrated by Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 119 S.Ct. \n14 \n1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999), which involved an ordinance that said a police officer โ โshall \norderโ โ persons to disperse in certain circumstances, id., at 47, n. 2, 119 S.Ct. 1849. This \n15 \nCourt rejected out of hand the possibility that โthe mandatory language of the ordinance ... \nafford[ed]  the  police no discretion.โ Id., at  62,  n.  32,  119  S.Ct.  1849.  It  is,  the  Court \n16 \nproclaimed,  simply  โcommon  sense  that all police officers  must  use  some discretion in \ndeciding when and where to enforce city ordinances.โ Ibid. (emphasis added). \n17 \n \nTown of Castle Rock, Colo. v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 761, 125 S. Ct. 2796, 2806, 162 L. Ed. 2d 658 \n18 \n(2005). The โbenefit that a third party may receive from having someone else arrested for a crime \n19 \ngenerally does not trigger protections under the Due Process Clause, neither in its procedural nor in \n20 \nits โsubstantiveโ manifestations.โ Id. at 768; 125 S.Ct. at 2810. The Fourteenth Amendment and Civil \n21 \nRights Act of 1871 โdid not create a system by which police departments are generally held \n22 \nfinancially accountable for crimes that better policing might have prevented.โ Id.

Absent an exception to the general rule that no claim arises from an alleged failure to \n3  exercise discretion to enforce lawsโnone applies hereโthe claim fails as a matter of law.  \n4    Perhaps in an effort to avoid the rule that failing to take discretionary acts cannot support \n5  liability, plaintiffs identify a municipal code provision, claim with no factual support that it applies \n6  here, and then allege that the statute required a single mandatory action that the City failed to take. \n7  This allegation is defeated on the face of the pleadings because Plaintiffs admit the protesters โlacked \n8  a permitโ, Complaint at ยถ218. They attempt to argue that the City was required to โdesignate an \n9  alternative proposalโ i.e. impose conditions on the CHOP by permit to reduce its impacts on the \n10  neighborhood. However, by the plain terms of SMC 15.52.060, the City is only required to take the \n11  action plaintiffs suggest when it denies a permit application that meets certain statutory criteria. See \n12  SMC 15.52.060(B) (If the Special Events Committee denies an application for a special event permit \n13  for  a  โfree  speechโ  event,  โthe  City  shall  designate  an  alternative  proposal  and  may  impose \n14  conditionsโฆ.โ). The City did not fail to take any mandatory action.   \n15  D.  The โstate-created dangerโ exception does not apply here: the City did not directly \nplace plaintiffs in danger  \n16   \nAgain, โ[t]he general rule is that a state is not liable for its omissions and the Due Process \n17 \nClause does not impose a duty on the state to protect individuals from third parties.โ Martinez v.

The Due Process \n19 \nClause does not provide a baseline level of protection against the acts of private parties that the City \n20 \nmust provide to persons or property. The City anticipates that plaintiffs will argue the โstate-created \n21 \ndangerโ exception applies here.  This exception only applies, however, when government employees \n22 \naffirmatively place a plaintiff in a position of danger which the plaintiff would not have otherwise \n23 \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. 998. A plaintiff must prove three elements to prevail on \n2  a โstate-created dangerโ argument. โFirst, she must show that the officersโ affirmative actions created \n3  or exposed her to an actual, particularized danger that she would not otherwise have faced. Second, \n4  she must show that the injury she suffered was foreseeable. Third, she must show that the officers \n5  were deliberately indifferent to the known danger.โ Martinez, 943 F.3d at 1271. The City discusses \n6  how the complaint fails to allege facts supporting the first and third elements of this test below.5 \n7  1.  The City did not expose plaintiffs to actual or particularized danger that plaintiffs \nwould not have faced but for City action. \n8 \nPlaintiffs simply do not plead a single circumstance where City action exposed them to an \n9 \nactual, particularized danger. In Johnson v. City of Seattle, 474 F.3d 634, 635 (9th Cir. 2007) the \n10 \nNinth Circuit rejected the argument that by failing to engage in more aggressive policing in response \n11 \nto civil unrest, the City placed Johnson and others in โa position of enhanced danger.โ The court \n12 \nrejected  that  argument  because:  โthe  more  passive  operational  plan  that  the  police  ultimately \n13 \nimplemented did not violate substantive due process because it โplaced [the Pioneer Square Plaintiffs] \n14 \nin no worse position than that in which [they] would have been had [the Defendants] not acted at \n15 \nall.โ DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. 998.).โ See also Munger v.

City of San Jose, 897 F.3d 1125, 1129, 1133-35 (9th Cir. 2018) the Ninth \n19 \nCircuit considered whether the created-danger exception applied to police officers who affirmatively \n20 \ndirected political rally attendees into a โcrowd of violent anti-Trump protestersโ and the attendees \n21 \nwere beaten, robbed and/or targeted by protesters throwing objects like eggs and bottles. Because the \n22 \n \n23  5 While the Cityโs position is that Plaintiff cannot establish any of the three elements of the test, for the purposes of the \nRule 12 motion, the City will limit its discussion to two of the three. \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

Id.  \n3  Plaintiffs do not allege a particularized danger. Rather, they generally complain about private \n4  criminal conduct, and the Cityโs knowledge of such crime. It is well-established, however, that these \n5  types of complaints are not enough to state a viable cause of action. This matter is controlled by \n6  Johnson v. City of Seattle and Munger.  \n7  2.  Plaintiffs complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to show deliberate indifference. \n8  Plaintiffs similarly cannot establish the third required element of a โstate created dangerโ \n9  exception. โDeliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal \n10  actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action. It requires a culpable mental state, \n11  and the standard [the Court] appl[ies] is even higher than gross negligence.โ Hernandez 897 at 1135. \n12  To meet the culpable mental state requirement, a plaintiff must demonstrate that governmental actors \n13  both recognized and intended to expose plaintiff to an unreasonable risk, and that the exposure was \n14  likely to lead to injury. Id.  \n15  For reasons discussed above, plaintiffs do not come close to alleging facts needed to support \n16  an argument the City intended to expose plaintiffs to an unreasonable risk. They argue that the City \n17  should have known generalized increased criminal activity would result from City acts. That is not \n18  enough, even if it were true that City acts were the causal factor in any complained-of criminal \n19  activity, which it is not. Plaintiffs have simply not pled any facts that support an inference that the \n20  City took action for the purpose of exposing the plaintiffs to a particularized unreasonable risk of \n21  harm.   \n22   \n23 \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

In the present case, for example, \npetitioners could argue that it was possible for the troops to maintain their position in front of \n16  the buildings if they had been willing to kill a large number of rioters. In rebuttal, the \nGovernment could persuasively argue that the indiscriminate use of deadly force would have \n17  enraged the mob still further and would have increased the likelihood of future disturbances. \nWhich strategy is a court to accept? Clearly, it is far sounder to defer to the other duly \n18  constituted branches of government in this regard.   \n \n19  Citoli v. City of Seattle, 115 Wn. App. at 491, 61 P.3d at 1182 (2002). In another case, the District \n20  Court for the District of Columbia rejected similar allegations to those made here:   \n21  Plaintiff's allegations that the riot control program formulated and adopted by officials of the \nUnited  States  and  the  District  of  Columbia  intentionally  sacrificed  private  property  in \n22  disturbance zones in order to further the public purpose of disturbance control, likewise do \nnot establish a Fifth Amendment taking of property for public use without just compensation. \n23   \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

U.S. 497 F.2d 683 (1974). \n3    Notwithstanding the same argument being considered and rejected by courts, as in Citoli, \n4  National Bd. of Young Men's Christian Ass'ns, and Monarch Ins., the plaintiffs propose that if the \n5  government had used a different strategy in response to civil unrest, plaintiffs might have suffered \n6  less damage from private parties. Such proposals do not support legally viable takings or other claims.  \n7  F.  Plaintiffs arguments under the Equal Protection Clause also fail: the City did not \ndiscriminate against them, nor violate their free speech rights \n8   \nPlaintiffs allege that the City violated the Equal Protection clause by expressing support for \n9 \nthe political message of some CHOP participants, providing support for CHOP participants even \n10 \nthough the participants lacked a permit, declining to enforce criminal and civil laws against CHOP \n11 \nparticipants, and not providing more police services inside the CHOP. Complaint at ยถยถ217-219. They \n12 \nallege that because the City engaged in different policing, other law enforcement and provision of \n13 \ngovernmental services outside the CHOP, the City violated the Plaintiffsโ civil rights by expressing a \n14 \npreference for the CHOP participantsโ speech. Id. at ยถยถ220-223. They further contend that CHOP \n15 \nparticipants took action against the plaintiffs based on speech, but do not allege the City did anything \n16 \nbecause of the plaintiffsโ speech. Id. at ยถ224. Plaintiffs appear to argue that the City violates the Equal \n17 \nProtection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it does not provide the same level of policing in \n18 \ndifferent parts of the City, duplicating their due process arguments. Plaintiffs again fail to delineate \n19 \nbetween peaceful, law-abiding protesters and others who then came to the CHOP area, and between \n20 \naffirmative acts by the City such as provision of sanitation services (which decreased some harms \n21 \nabout which Plaintiffsโ complain, like feces in the area) and times when the City did not act as \n22 \nPlaintiffs would have preferred.  \n23 \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

Plaintiffs do not allege that the City acted with an intent to discriminate against \nthem, and their equal protection claim therefore fails. \n2   \nโ[T]he purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every \n3 \nperson  within  the  State's  jurisdiction  against  intentional  and  arbitrary  discrimination,  whether \n4 \noccasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted \n5 \nagents.โ Vill. of Willowbrook v.

To state an equal protection violation under the \n7 \nFourteenth Amendment, a plaintiff must usually allege a government acted with an intent or purpose \n8 \nto discriminate against the plaintiff based on membership in a protected class. Lee v. City of Los \n9 \nAngeles, 250 F.3d 668, 686 (9th Cir. 2001). โโDiscriminatory purposeโ ... implies more than intent as \n10 \nvolition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker ... selected or \n11 \nreaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part โbecause of,โ not merely โin spite of,โ its adverse \n12 \neffects upon an identifiable group.โ Id. at 687 (citation and quotation omitted). An equal protection \n13 \nclaim will not lie by โconflating all persons not injured into a preferred class receiving better \n14 \ntreatmentโ than the plaintiff. Thornton v. City of St. Helens, 425 F.3d 1158, 1167 (9th Cir. 2005) \n15 \n(citing Joyce v. Mavromatis, 783 F.2d 56, 57 (6th Cir. 1986)). Similarly, โevidence of different \n16 \ntreatment of unlike groups does not support an equal protection claim.โ Id. at 1168. Here, the Plaintiffs \n17 \ncomplaint alleges no facts sufficient to support the notion that the City responded to the CHOP with \n18 \nan intent to discriminate against Plaintiffs. The businesses say they supported the protesters message, \n19 \nas the City did. Complaint at ยถ1. No facts in the complaint support the notion that the City acted as it \n20 \ndid because of some animus towards plaintiffs.6  \n21 \n \n22 \n6 If Plaintiffs are intending to advance a claim based on viewpoint discrimination, they clearly cannot do so when, \naccording to the facts alleged in the Complaint, all of the parties involved (the city, the peaceful protesters, and the \n23  plaintiffs) share a similar viewpoint about the relevant matter of public concern. Plaintiffs do not say they the City \nretaliated against them because of their speech, but that โCHOP participants regularly threatened, bullied, and assaulted \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S. Holmes \nSeattle City Attorney \nCERTIFICATION - 15 \n701 5th Avenue, Suite 2050 \n2:20-CV-00983  Seattle, WA 98104-7095 \n \n(206) 684-8200\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 11   Filed 07/23/20   Page 16 of 21\n \n1  Although unclear from the Amended Complaint, it is possible plaintiffs make a novel โclass \n2  of oneโ argument as to each purported class member. See Engquist v. Oregon Department of \n3  Agriculture, 553  U.S.  591,  128  S.Ct.  2146,  170  L.Ed.2d  975  (2008).  Such  claims  require \n4  discriminatory intent and cannot be supported by an alleged failure to take a discretionary act alone. \n5  See Engquist, 553 U.S. at 601-09, 128 S.Ct. at 2152-2157; Hanes v. Zurick, 578 F.3d 491, 496 (7th \n6  Cir. 2009) (An โofficer motivated by malice alone is not exercising discretion and is not weighing the \n7  factors relevant to the officer's duties to the public.โ); Le Fay v. Le Fay, 1:13-CV-1362 AWI MJS, \n8  2015 WL 106262, at *7 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2015), aff'd sub nom. LeFay v. LeFay, 673 Fed. Appx. 722 \n9  (9th Cir. 2016) (malice required to support class of one theory in case involving class of one equal \n10  protection theory based on discretionary law enforcement decision). Critically, plaintiffs do not allege \n11  that the City was motived by malice and therefore took discriminatory action against them. Rather, \n12  they allege that the City failed to stop private actors from conduct which the plaintiffs (often \n13  understandably) disliked. Plaintiffsโ complaint fails to allege the basic factual elements required to \n14  support an equal protection claim. The courtโs analysis need go no further than this to determine that \n15  their equal protection claim fails.  \n16  2.  To  the  extent  the  Plaintiffs  make  a  First  Amendment  claim  under  the  Equal \nProtection clause, it fails because they do not allege (1) the City took retaliatory \n17  action against them because of their speech (2) that would have chilled a person of \nordinary firmness from participating in First Amendment speech or (3) that they \n18  were injured by government retaliation. \n \n19  Government action that suppresses protected speech in a discriminatory manner may violate \n20  both the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, \n21  384 n. 4, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (noting that the Supreme Court โhas occasionally \n22 \n \n23  individuals whom they suspected might hold viewpoints contrary to their own[.]โ  Complaint at ยถ224 (emphasis added).  \nThis is not enough to establish governmental retaliation based on an expressed viewpoint.    \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.

Where plaintiffs allege \n3  violations of the Equal Protection Clause relating  to  expressive conduct,  courts analyze those \n4  arguments using the framework applicable to alleged content or viewpoint discrimination under the \n5  First Amendment. Dariano v. Morgan Hill Unified Sch. Dist., 767 F.3d 764, 779โ80 (9th Cir. 2014). \n6  To demonstrate a First Amendment violation, a plaintiff must (1)  provide evidence  of \n7  retaliatory governmental action motivated by an intention to interfere with First Amendment rights; \n8  (2) that defendantโs conduct โwould chill or silence a person of ordinary firmness from future First \n9  Amendment activity,โ Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino Cty., 192 F.3d 1283, 1300 (9th Cir. 1999) \n10  (citation omitted) and (3) that but for the governmentโs retaliatory acts an injury to the plaintiff would \n11  not have occurred. Lacey v. Maricopa Cty., 693 F.3d 896, 917 (9th Cir. 2012). In the First Amendment \n12  context, there is no right to a response or any particular action when a citizen petitions the government \n13  for redress of a grievance, including filing a police report.  See, e.g.. Mancini v. City of Cloverdale \n14  Police Dep't, 15-CV-02804-JSC, 2015 WL 4512274, at *6 (N.D. Cal. July 24, 2015); Doe v. County \n15  of San Mateo, 2009 WL 735149 at *6 (N.D. Cal. March 19, 2009).  \n16    Here, plaintiffs allege no facts that the Cityโs response to the CHOP was motivated by a desire \n17  to suppress plaintiffsโ speech. They do not identify what speech plaintiffs engaged in or even desired \n18  to engage in, when the City heard it, nor how the City retaliated against it. The allegedly retaliatory \n19  acts they complainโthreats of violence, for exampleโare not City actions, but that of private actors. \n20  In short, plaintiffsโ complaint satisfies none of the elements of a First Amendment claim, and their \n21  First Amendment claim under the Equal Protection clause is properly dismissed as a matter of law.   \n22   \n23 \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S. Holmes \nSeattle City Attorney \nCERTIFICATION - 17 \n701 5th Avenue, Suite 2050 \n2:20-CV-00983  Seattle, WA 98104-7095 \n \n(206) 684-8200\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 11   Filed 07/23/20   Page 18 of 21\n \n1  G.  Class certification is unavailable because plaintiffs complain of distinct harms occurring \nat different times and differing damages  \n2   \nFRCP 23(c)(1)(A) addresses the timing of a district court's class certification determination, \n3 \nand states: โTime to Issue: At an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class \n4 \nrepresentative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.โ \n5 \nFRCP 23(c)(1)(A). Preemptive motions by the defense to deny class certification are properly \n6 \nconsidered by the trial court. Vinole v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 571 F.3d 935, 940 (9th Cir. \n7 \n2009). Whether to permit discovery prior to considering a motion to deny certification is within the \n8 \ndiscretion of the trial court, and discovery is properly denied where plaintiffs do not make a prima \n9 \nfacie showing  of  Rule  23's  prerequisites  or  that  discovery  measures  were  โlikely  to  produce \n10 \npersuasive information substantiating the class action allegations.โ Doninger v. Pac. Nw. Bell, \n11 \nInc., 564 F.2d 1304, 1313 (9th Cir. 1977). \n12 \nClass certification is not appropriate in civil rights cases involving varied incidents that \n13 \nproduced differing harms allegedly caused by third parties and governments. Plaintiffs in such cases \n14 \ncannot satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)โs commonality requirement. In a recent, and directly comparable, \n15 \nNorthern District of California case, the court denied class certification in a case involving a โcreated \n16 \ndangerโ theory where police officers were alleged to have directed plaintiffs into a dangerous crowd. \n17 \nHernandez v. City of San Jose, 16-CV-03957-LHK, 2019 WL 4450930, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, \n18 \n2019). The court noted that causation โdoomedโ plaintiffsโ class certification motion. Id. Each alleged \n19 \nincident would require a causation analysis, and because the incidents involved โthird-party attackersโ \n20 \nthere were unique proximate cause arguments as to each plaintiff: each would be required to show \n21 \nthat they would not have been injured by private parties but for the governmental action. Id. The same \n22 \nanalysis holds true here, and it warrants denial of class certification on this ground alone. \n23 \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S. Holmes \nSeattle City Attorney \nCERTIFICATION - 18 \n701 5th Avenue, Suite 2050 \n2:20-CV-00983  Seattle, WA 98104-7095 \n \n(206) 684-8200\n \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00983-TSZ   Document 11   Filed 07/23/20   Page 19 of 21\n \n1  The Hernandez court also noted that damages issues in cases like this one pose an \n2  insurmountable predominance problem under Rule 23(b)(3). Id. (citing and quoting Lambert v. \n3  Nutraceutical Corp., 870 F.3d 1170, 1182 (9th Cir. 2017), rev'd and remanded on other grounds, \n4  139 S. Ct. 710 (2019)(โ[a] Rule 23(b)(3) plaintiff must show a class wide method for damages \n5  calculations as a part of the assessment of whether common questions predominate over individual \n6  questions.โ)). Hernandez noted that each plaintiff was alleging different injuries that would not be \n7  susceptible to calculation using a damages model, as required by Rule 23. In cases like Hernandez \n8  and this one โ[q]uestions of individual damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm questions \n9  common to the class.โ Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 34, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1433, 185 L. \n10  Ed. 2d 515 (2013) (cited and quoted in Hernandez at *17). \n11  As in Hernandez, for multiple reasons, there is no class here that can be properly certified. \n12  The City therefore respectfully requests the Court deny class certification, in the event that the \n13  Cityโs Rule 12 motion is not granted in full.  \n14  IV.  CONCLUSION  \n15  Plaintiffs  complain  of  private  action,  not  discriminatory  governmental  action.  Their \n16  allegations that the City knew of ongoing criminal and other activity and failed to stop it cannot \n17  support their due process and equal protection claims. Similarly, their allegation that property access \n18  was temporarily impaired (but never eliminated) by private parties cannot establish a viable takings \n19  claim. Similarly, their purported class cannot satisfy basic Rule 23 requirements.  \n20  Pursuant to Rule 12, because Plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, \n21  the City requests plaintiffsโ complaint be dismissed with prejudice. In the alternative, the City requests \n22  // \n23  // \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS AND DENY CLASS  Peter S.
