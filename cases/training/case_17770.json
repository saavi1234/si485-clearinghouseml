On August 12, 2020, a female employee filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiff sued Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought back pay, front pay, compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant discriminated against her by refusing to give her proper break time to pump breastmilk while on shift and initially sought class certification.</p><p>On December 29, 2016, the plaintiff requested a break to pump breastmilk. She claimed that her managers refused to allow her to pump as the restaurant was busy. The plaintiffโs breasts began to visibly leak through her shirt, and she was required to continue serving customers. Upon seeing that she was leaking, the plaintiffโs managers informed her that she would be permitted to take a break in fifteen minutes. During this time, the plaintiff claimed she was still required to interact with customers with a soaked-through shirt. The plaintiff claimed that approximately forty minutes after being allowed to pump, she was called into the office by her managers and berated. </p><p>The plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that she was discriminated against on the basis of her gender and pregnancy in violation of Title VII. The EEOC issued a determination that there was reasonable cause to believe that the defendant violated Title VII and permitted the plaintiff to file this lawsuit.</p><p>Upon filing on August 14th, 2020, the case was assigned to Judge Eileen S. Willett. On August 14, 2020, the case was reassigned from the Magistrate to the District Court to Judge Steven P. Logan, per local rules. </p><p>On August 14th, 2020, Judge Logan issued a preliminary order stating that any motion to dismiss the case is discouraged if the pleading can be cured by filing an amended pleading. On September 1, 2020, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint was largely identical to the original, except that the plaintiff was now suing individually with no collective action allegations. Accordingly, the scope of relief was amended to eliminate relief to other individuals similarly situated. There was no additional information from the pleadings as to why the class allegations were dropped.</p><p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Plaintiff was employed by Defendant from approximately March 2016 until \n24 \nDecember 2016 at its 59th and Thunderbird location in Glendale, Arizona. \n  25 \n26  10.  Plaintiff was a nursing mother while employed with Defendant. \n27 \n11.  Throughout the timeframe relevant to this Complaint, Plaintiff would inform \n28 \nher managers that she needed regular breaks to express breastmilk, which would typically \n \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-01595-ESW   Document 1   Filed 08/12/20   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  occur no more than once or twice per shift. \n2 \n12.  If Plaintiff did not timely pump breastmilk consistent with a regular schedule, \n3 \nher  breasts  would  become  painfully  engorged,  or  her  breasts  would  sometimes  leak \n  4 \nbreastmilk. \n5 \n6  13.  On or about December 29, 2016, Plaintiff requested a short break to pump \n7 \nbreastmilk. \n8 \n14.  Plaintiffโs managers refused to let her take a break to pump breastmilk, \n9 \nclaiming that the restaurant was too busy to authorize her break. \n10 \nC 0 \n6\nPULLP , 258 anozirA ,elad puorgnamdlooc. 111123    coming1 i5n.t o wPolrakin. tiff was also told that she should have managed her time better before \n ORG WA 31 etiuS .dsttocS3 nadl0o1z4@m3โz   1145   custom1e6r-.f acinPgla rionlteif.f  returned to her post working as a cashier, which is a high-volume, \nL vlB24.\n NADLO  thgishtroN .N 00.084 :xaF & leT4 1167   breastm1i7lk.  thrAoupgphr ohxeirm sahtierlty.  twenty minutes later, Plaintiffโs breasts began to visibly leak \nZ 54 18 \n1\n18.

Upon discovering that her breasts were leaking through her shirt, Plaintiffโs \n22 \nmanager told her that she could take a break in fifteen minutes. \n23 \n20.  While she was waiting, Plaintiffโs undergarments and work uniform became \n24 \ncold and soggy in plain view of guests. \n  25 \n26  21.

Vinnie F also stated that the whole team โhad his back,โ indicating that \n7 \nPlaintiffโs peers not only knew about the embarrassing event, but also that they had \n8 \napparently chosen Vinnie Fโs side. \n9 \n26.

At all relevant times, Plaintiff and the Collective Members are and have been \n  25 \n26  similarly situated, have had substantially similar job positions, and were each denied \n27 \nreasonable break periods to express breastmilk while on-shift.
