          "description": "MINUTE ORDER denying the Government's 82 MOTION for Reconsideration and finding as moot the Government's 85 MOTION for Leave to File Supplemental Declaration. The Government renews its request that the Court stay its preliminary injunction issued on November 18, 2020, contending that, inter alia, (1) given the rise in COVID-19 infections in States along the southern border, \"enjoining the CDC Order [that allows for the expulsion of class members pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 265] at this juncture would create or exacerbate conditions conducive to further COVID-19 outbreaks,\" Gov't's Mot., ECF No. 82 at 9-10; (2) the increase in the number of unaccompanied minors, could lead to \"hospital systems in some localities \" to be overwhelmed; id. at 11; and (3) the \"recent increases in the number of referrals to\" the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\"), during the pandemic, could lead to \"greater challenges in accommodating the expected increases in referrals of covered minors,\" and potentially force ORR transport class members further inland, id. at 12-15. The Government states that it is \"not seeking reconsideration of this Court's order granting Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 15, or provisionally granting Plaintiff's motion to certify a class, ECF No. 2.\" Gov't's Mot., ECF No. 82 at 4 n.2. In opposition, the Plaintiff argues that \"[the Government's] failure to contest the Court's merits ruling is an arguably fatal flaw for a stay application and should be determinative here... particularly given [the Government's] additional failure to contest the irreparable harm to the children.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 84 at 5 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff also contends that (1) no class member in ORR custody has required hospitalization due to COVID-19, see id. at 5; (2) the Government's speculation that there will be an increase in the number of unaccompanied children entering the country \"is riddled with inconsistencies and misdirection,\" id. at 7; and (3) the Government has \"not demonstrated that [U.S. Customs & Border Protection] or ORR facilities lack additional capacity to hold children even if the numbers substantially increase,\" id. at 9. In this Court, motions for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are examined under the \"standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e)\". United States v. Fareri, No. CR 09-54 (EGS), 2018 WL 8754169, at *2 (D.D.C. Oct. 19, 2018) (Sullivan, J.). Under that standard, a Rule 59(e) motion-and in this case a 54(b) motion-\"need not be granted unless the district court finds that there is an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\" Id. As the Government is requesting that the Court reconsider its denial of a stay of its November 18, 2020 preliminary injunction, the Court will review the Government's motion using the factors governing the granting of a stay pending an appeal. A \"stay pending [an] appeal is always an extraordinary remedy,\" United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 449 F. Supp. 2d 988, 990 (D.D.C. 2006) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); and the \"party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion,\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 43334 (2009). In determining whether to grant a stay pending an appeal, a Court must consider \"(1) whether the applicant has made a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\" Nken, 556 U.S. at 34. Of these, the \"first two factors of the traditional standard are the most critical.\" Id. Here, the Government clearly has not met its burden. Even though the \"first two factors of the traditional [stay] standard are the most critical,\" id.; the Government does not even consider the first stay factor-likelihood of success on the merits, see generally, Gov't's Mot., ECF No. 82-nor does it sufficiently explain how it will be \"irreparably injured absent a stay,\" see id. (stating only \"any increase in the transfer of class members into [border] States' health care systems is likely to cause irreparable harm to the public\"). The Government also fails to address the final two factors- whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding, and where the public interest lies. See generally, Gov't's Mot., ECF No. 82. Because the Court finds that the Government did not note any intervening change of controlling law, provide sufficient new evidence concerning the stay factors, or point out any clear error or manifest injustice, see Fareri, 2018 WL 8754169, at *2, it is ORDERED that the Government's motion for reconsideration, ECF No. 82, is DENIED.

    "summary": "<p><strong><u>Immigration Safeguards For Unaccompanied Children</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>Previously, unaccompanied children arriving at the border seeking safety were awarded protection under two laws. First, provisions in the Homeland Security Act vest care for unaccompanied children with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), giving the minors access to legal care and housing. Second, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) requires that minors must be transferred to ORR custody within 72 hours following apprehension, and removal of a child requires a decision by an immigration judge. Separately, statutes affirming internationally agreed upon protections permit unaccompanied children to seek shelter in the United States by claiming asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from torture. Furthermore, immigration laws recognize the possibility that immigrants arrive at the border with a communicable disease, however these statutes do not permit deportation without screening for persecution or torture.</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>CDC Issues Emergency Public Health Order (Title 42 Process)</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2020, President Trump announced that public health provision of Title 42 of the U.S. Code would be used to suspend entry of all individuals at the border who lack proper documentation. Simultaneously, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a regulation without notice and comment. Specifically invoking language contained in Section 265, the government claimed that the Surgeon General may prohibit introduction of persons that pose serious danger to the United States because of the presence of a communicable disease in their country of origin. Pursuant to the regulation, the CDC issued an order that other agencies may immediately suspend the introduction of these immigrants because of the danger they pose to Border Patrol personnel at ports of entry. The order gives the U.S. Department of Homeland Security discretion to allow exceptions based on the totality of the circumstances. The order remains silent on application for individuals seeking asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection, and circumstances for unaccompanied children. In the complaint, this regulation and subsequent order is referred to as the Title 42 Process.</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>The Plaintiff&rsquo;s Apprehension Under the Title 42 Process and Subsequent Lawsuit</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>On August 11, 2020, border patrol agents apprehended Plaintiff, a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor fleeing persecution in Guatemala. Immediately, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) placed him into custody awaiting deportation under the Title 42 Process. Despite the presence of a relative in the United States and vacancy in an Office of Refugee Resettlement facility, Plaintiff &ndash; exhibiting no COVID-19 symptoms &ndash; remained in CBP custody.</p>\r\n<p>In response to this treatment by CPB, on August 14, 2020, Plaintiff, represented by the ACLU, sued the leaders of numerous governmental departments, including the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the CDC, and officials leading CPB, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the Administrative Procedure Act for unlawful agency action and arbitrary and capricious enforcement. Plaintiff alleged that the Title 42 Process violates the requirements of the TVPRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Public Health Service Act. The plaintiff requested also that the court certify a class for purposes of the suit comprised of &ldquo;[a]ll unaccompanied noncitizen children who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. government custody in the United States, and (2) are or will be subjected to the Title 42 Process.&rdquo; In addition, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the new Title 42 Process as applied to himself and other class members, as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff filed a motion for class-wide preliminary injunction on August 20, 2020, asking the court to cease the application of the Title 42 Process to himself and class members. On September 6, 2020, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey for the preparation of a report and recommendation on both the motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On September 25, 2020, Magistrate Judge Harvey recommended that Judge Sullivan grant the class certification and the preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 5793305. He found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on his claim that the government's regulation and order exceeded the authority granted by the Public Health Service Act because the Act does not authorize the government to expel Plaintiff or putative class members from the United States outside of the removal process of the Immigration and Nationality Act and other safeguards in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, including protections provided in the TVPRA.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2020, Judge Sullivan adopted Magistrate Judge Harvey's recommendations and granted Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and provisionally granted the class certification motion. 502 F. Supp. 3d 492. The order declared that the removal of Plaintiff without due process exceeded the authority that public health emergency decrees usually confer. Judge Harvey noted that in another case with similar facts where the D.C. District Court examined the Title 42 Process, the court also granted a preliminary injunction based on likelihood of success on the merits. For more information, see <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>J.B.B.C. v. Wolf</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 25, 2020, Defendants appealed the district court's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Defendants then filed a motion to stay pending appeal on December 3, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, Defendants moved for reconsideration of the November 18 order, which the court denied on December 3, 2020. Defendants contended that, given the strain on the healthcare systems along the southern border and the increased number of unaccompanied minors covered by the CDC order, prohibiting the expulsion of class members deprived the government of an \"important tool\" to help address the public health emergency. This, they argued, increased the risk of transmitting COVID-19 into the United States and further strained the country's limited healthcare resources. The court ruled that the government did not meet its burden of showing that the circumstances justified a stay pending appeal.</p>\r\n<p>In response to status reports submitted to the court regarding Defendants' compliance with the preliminary injunction, on January 22, 2021, the district court ordered the parties to submit joint status reports addressing Defendants' compliance and, more specifically, updating the court on the situation regarding thirty-two minors who the government returned to Guatemala in November 2020 in violation of the injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On January 29, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted Defendants' motion to stay. 2021 WL 9100552. Shortly thereafter, the Biden Administration, which had taken office just days before the stay was issued, announced changes to the Trump-era immigration policies. More specifically, on February 11, 2021, the CDC issued a notice stating that it had &ldquo;exercised its discretion to temporarily exempt from expulsion unaccompanied noncitizen children encountered in the United States&rdquo; pending a reassessment of the Title 42 Process. As a result, on March 1, 2021, Defendants filed a joint motion to hold the briefing schedule in abeyance, which the D.C. Circuit granted the following day. On July 19, 2021, following the aforementioned reassessment of the Title 42 Process, the CDC issued an order that exempted unaccompanied noncitizen children from the process's application.</p>\r\n<p>In the district court, Defendants filed multiple joint motions throughout 2021 to hold the case in abeyance, which the court granted. The defendants also continued filing status reports to the court. Defendants filed with the D.C. Circuit on March 2, 2022, a motion to terminate the abeyance, vacate this court&rsquo;s preliminary injunction as moot, and remand to the district court for a determination of whether the case as a whole is moot. On October 17, 2022, the D.C. Circuit ordered the abeyance be lifted. 2022 WL 17246563. As requested by Defendants, the circuit court also ordered the case be remanded to the district court to consider whether all or part of the case had become moot.</p>\r\n<p>On November 22, 2022, Defendants filed a motion in district court seeking to have the case dismissed as moot or, in the alternative, to have the court vacate the preliminary injunction. On January 25, 2023, the district court issued an order granting Plaintiff's motion to hold Defendants' motion to dismiss in abeyance. The order also stayed the case pending completion of appellate proceedings in a related case, <em><a href=\"../../../../case/18184\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas</a></em>. 652 F.Supp.3d 103.</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2023, implementation of the Title 42 Process ended after the CDC's public health emergency expired. Federal courts quickly thereafter resolved <em>Huisha-Huisha.&nbsp;</em>With the implementation of the Title 42 Process over, and with the resumption of immigration processing of noncitizens apprehended in the United States without travel documents, the parties jointly stipulated to dismiss this case in November 2023.</p>",

On November 18, 2020, this Court entered a preliminary injunction in this case, \nenjoining the expulsion of class members pursuant to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (“CDC”) Order issued on October 13, 2020.  See Order, ECF Nos. 79, 80.  The \ngovernment appealed that injunction and sought a stay of the injunction pending appeal.

Reg. 42,828, 42,830 (Aug. 5, 2021). \n4.  On May 11, 2023, CDC’s public health emergency declaration concerning \nCOVID-19 expired.  See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/end-of-\nphe.html.  By its own terms, the Title 42 Policy terminated on that date.   \n5.  On May 18, 2023, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the D.C. Circuit in \nArizona v. Mayorkas (also known as Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas in the lower courts), involving \nseveral states’ motion to intervene in Huisha-Huisha.  The Supreme Court’s order vacated the \nCircuit’s denial of the States’ motion to intervene, and remanded with instructions to dismiss the \nmotion as moot.  See Order, Arizona v. Mayorkas, No.  22-592 (May 18, 2023).  \n6.  On remand, the D.C. Circuit vacated the Huisha-Huisha permanent injunction and \nRule 54 judgment and remanded with instructions to dismiss the case as moot.  Order, Huisha-\nHuisha v. Mayorkas, No. 22-5325 (Sept. 7, 2023).  The D.C. Circuit’s mandate in Huisha-\nHuisha issued on October 31, 2023.   \n7.  In addition, the Western District of Louisiana’s preliminary injunction against \nCDC’s attempts to rescind the Title 42 Policy has now been vacated.  See Judgment, Louisiana v. \nCDC, 22-cv-00885 (June 14, 2023), ECF No. 190. \n8.  Defendants have resumed immigration processing of those noncitizens \napprehended in the United States without travel documents, including unaccompanied children, \nunder its Title 8 authorities.  \n9.  In light of these developments, the parties jointly stipulate to dismiss this case \nwithout prejudice.  The preliminary injunction in this case is not necessary at this time because \nthe “Title 42 Policy” is not being applied to unaccompanied children, or any other individuals.   \n10.  This Court need not direct notice to the class because this dismissal is without \nprejudice, the dismissal would not preclude class members from filing any future claims \nconcerning 42 U.S.C. § 265 or the “Title 42 Policy” should circumstances change, and because \nno unaccompanied children are currently subject to the Title 42 Policy.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 155   Filed 11/06/23   Page 3 of 3\nDated: November 6, 2023             Respectfully submitted, \n \n  BRIAN M.

Pre-COVID-19 Pandemic \nPrior to the current COVID-19 pandemic and pursuant to the \nTVPRA, unaccompanied children who entered the United States and \nwere nationals of countries that do not share a border with the \nUnited States were required to be transferred to the care and \ncustody of the Department of Health and Human Services’ (“DHH”) \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), within 72 hours of their \ndetainment, for placement in the “least restrictive setting that \nis in the best interest of the child.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b). \nUnaccompanied children from countries that share borders with \nthe United States were initially screened to determine that the \nunaccompanied child: (1) was not a victim of trafficking; (2) \ndid not have “a credible fear of persecution”; and (3) was “able \nto make an independent decision” about their admission into the \nUnited States. Id. § 1232(a)(2)(A). Absent these determinations, \nthe unaccompanied child was also transferred to the care and \ncustody of ORR. Id. § 1232(a)(3). These unaccompanied children \nalso had access to “counsel to represent them in legal \nproceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, \nexploitation, and trafficking,” id. § 1232(c)(5); and some were \n                     \n169 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The Government does not object to \nMagistrate Judge Harvey’s recitation of the alleged facts. \nSee generally, Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 4 of 50\nprovided “independent child advocates . . . to effectively \nadvocate for the[ir] best interest.” Id. § 1232(c)(6).  \nIn addition, all unaccompanied children retained their \nrights under the INA to (1) apply for asylum, id. § 1158(a)(1); \ncontest their removal to a country where their “life or freedom \nwould be threatened . . . because of [their] race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion,” id. § 1231(b)(3) (“withholding of removal”); \nor, pursuant to FARRA, (3) make a case that “he or she would be \ntortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.” Id. § \n1231 Note.  \n2. COVID-19 Pandemic and CDC Orders \nSince 1893, federal law has provided federal officials with \nthe authority to stem the spread of contagious diseases from \nforeign countries by prohibiting, “in whole or in part, the \nintroduction of persons and property from such countries.” Act \nof February 15, 1893, ch. 114, § 7, 27 Stat. 449, 452, ECF No. \n15-5 at 5 (“1893 Act”). Under current law, \nWhenever the Surgeon General determines that \nby reason of the existence of any communicable \ndisease in a foreign country there is serious \ndanger  of  the  introduction  of  such  disease \ninto the United States, and that this danger \nis so increased by the introduction of persons \nor  property  from  such  country  that  a \nsuspension  of  the  right  to  introduce  such \npersons  and  property  is  required  in  the \ninterest  of  the  public  health,  the  Surgeon \nGeneral,  in  accordance  with  regulations \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 5 of 50\napproved  by  the  President,  shall  have  the \npower to prohibit, in whole or in part, the \nintroduction of persons and property from such \ncountries or places as he shall designate in \norder  to  avert  such  danger,  and  for  such \nperiod of time as he may deem necessary for \nsuch purpose. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 265 (“Section 265”). In 1966, “the Surgeon General’s \n§ 265 authority was transferred” to HHS, which in turn \n“delegated this authority to the [Centers for Disease Control \n(“CDC”)] in 2001 and [t]he President’s functions under § 265 \nwere assigned to the Secretary of HHS in a 2003 executive \norder.” Compl., ECF No. 1 at 13 n.2.  \nOn March 24, 2020, as the COVID-19 virus spread throughout \nthe country, the CDC issued a new regulation, pursuant to \nSection 265, aiming to “provide[] a procedure for CDC to suspend \nthe introduction of persons from designated countries or places, \nif required, in the interest of public health.” Control of \nCommunicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of \nIntroduction of Persons Into United States From Designated \nForeign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes, 85 Fed. \nReg. 16559-01, 2020 WL 1330968, (March 24, 2020) (“Interim \nRule”). The Interim Rule created Section 71.40 to “enable the \nCDC Director to suspend the introduction of persons into the \nUnited States” and stated, in relevant part,  \n(b) For purposes of this section: \n \n(1) Introduction into the United States \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 6 of 50\nof persons from a foreign country (or one \nor more political subdivisions or regions \nthereof) or place means the movement of \na person from a foreign country (or one \nor more political subdivisions or regions \nthereof) or place, or series of foreign \ncountries  or  places,  into  the  United \nStates  so  as  to  bring  the  person  into \ncontact  with  persons  in  the  United \nStates,  or  so  as  to  cause  the \ncontamination of property in the United \nStates,  in  a  manner  that  the  Director \ndetermines  to  present  a  risk  of \ntransmission of a communicable disease to \npersons  or  property,  even  if  the \ncommunicable  disease  has  already  been \nintroduced, transmitted, or is spreading \nwithin the United States; \n \n(2) Serious danger of the introduction of \nsuch communicable disease into the United \nStates  means  the  potential  for \nintroduction  of  vectors  of  the \ncommunicable  disease  into  the  United \nStates, even if persons or property in \nthe United States are already infected or \ncontaminated  with  the  communicable \ndisease; and \n \n(3)  The  term  “Place”  includes  any \nlocation  specified  by  the  Director, \nincluding any carrier, as that term is \ndefined  in  42  CFR  71.1,  whatever  the \ncarrier's nationality. \n \nId. at 16566-67. The CDC’s Interim Rule was made effective \nimmediately, “without advance notice and comment,” Compl., ECF \nNo. 1 at 13 ¶ 50; though the CDC explained that “[p]ursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B),” of the APA, HHS “conclude[d] that there \n[was] good cause to dispense with prior public notice and the \nopportunity to comment on this rule before finalizing this \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 7 of 50\nrule.” Interim Rule at 16564. Specifically, the CDC stated that \n“[g]iven the national emergency caused by COVID-19, it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public health—and, by \nextension, the public interest—to delay these implementing \nregulations until a full public notice-and-comment process is \ncompleted.” Id. at 16565. Finally, noting that Section 265 \napplied to “persons” in general, the CDC declared that the \n“interim final rule [would] not apply to U.S. citizens or lawful \npermanent residents . . . [because the] CDC believes that, at \npresent, quarantine, isolation, and conditional release, in \ncombination with other authorities, while not perfect solutions, \ncan mitigate any transmission or spread of COVID-19 caused by \nthe introduction of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents \ninto the United States.” Id. at 16564. \n  Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the CDC Director issued an \norder suspending the introduction of “covered aliens” which he \ndefined as “persons traveling from Canada or Mexico (regardless \nof their country of origin) who would otherwise be introduced \ninto a congregate setting in a land Port of Entry [(“POE”)] or \nBorder Patrol station at or near the United States borders with \nCanada and Mexico” for a period of 30 days. Notice of Order \nUnder Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act \nSuspending Introduction of Certain Persons From Countries Where \na Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. 17060-02, 2020 WL \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 8 of 50\n1445906 (March 26, 2020) (“March Order”). The CDC Director found \nthe March Order necessary because the public health risks \ninclude[d] transmission and spread of COVID-\n19  to  [U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection \n(“CBP”)]  personnel,  U.S.  citizens,  lawful \npermanent residents, and other persons in the \nPOEs  and  Border  Patrol  stations;  further \ntransmission  and  spread  of  COVID-19  in  the \ninterior;  and  the  increased  strain  that \nfurther transmission and spread of COVID-19 \nwould  put  on  the  United  States  healthcare \nsystem  and  supply  chain  during  the  current \npublic health emergency. \n \nId. at 17061. In a section titled “Determination and \nImplementation,” the March Order declared that “[i]t is \nnecessary for the public health to immediately suspend the \nintroduction of covered aliens” and “require[d] the movement of \nall such aliens to the country from which they entered the \nUnited States, or their country of origin, or another location \nas practicable, as rapidly as possible.” Id. at 17067. The CDC \nDirector then “requested that DHS implement th[e] [March Order] \nbecause CDC does not have the capability, resources, or \npersonnel needed to do so” and then notes that “CBP [had \nalready] developed an operational plan for implementing the \norder.” Id. In April, the March Order was extended another 30 \ndays. See Extension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the \nPublic Health Service Act; Order Suspending Introduction of \nCertain Persons From Countries Where a Communicable Disease \nExists, 85 Fed. Reg. 22424-01, 2020 WL 1923282 (April 22, 2020) \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 9 of 50\n(“April Order”). The March Order was extended again on May 20, \n2020 and amended to “clarify that it applies to all land and \ncoastal [POEs] and Border Patrol stations at or near the United \nStates' border with Canada or Mexico that would otherwise hold \ncovered aliens in a congregate setting.” Amendment and Extension \nof Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service \nAct; Order Suspending Introduction of Certain Persons From \nCountries Where a Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. \n31503-02, 31504, 2020 WL 2619696 (May 26, 2020) (“May Order”). \nThe May Order also extended the duration of the order until the \nCDC Director “determine[s] that the danger of further \nintroduction of COVID-19 into the United States has ceased to be \na serious danger to the public health,” though the CDC would \nstill conduct a recurring 30-day review. Id. Finding that: (1) \nthe CDC Order had “significantly mitigated the specific public \nhealth risk identified in the initial Order by significantly \nreducing the population of covered aliens held in congregate \nsettings in POEs and Border Patrol stations,” id. at 31505; and \n(2) “due to their lack of legal immigration status, there is \nsignificant uncertainty that covered aliens would be able to \neffectively self-quarantine, self-isolate, or otherwise comply \nwith existing social distancing guidelines, if they were \nconditionally released,” id. at 31508; the CDC Director \nrequested that DHS “continue to implement the operational plan \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 10 of 50\ndeveloped to carry out the” March and April Orders, id. The \nCourt will refer to the process developed by the CDC and \nimplemented by the March, April, and May Orders as the “CDC \nOrders.”3  \n  As noted above, the CBP had already developed its plan to \nimplement the March Order and issued a memorandum on April 2, \n2020 establishing its procedures for implementing the order. See \nCompl., ECF No. 1 at 17 ¶ 65; see also COVID-I9 CAPIO, ECF No. \n15-5 at 15 (“CAPIO Memo”). Specifically, the CAPIO Memo \ninstructed that when implementing the CDC Orders, agents may \ndetermine whether individuals are subject to the CDC Orders \n“Based on training, experience, physical observation, \ntechnology, questioning and other considerations.” CAPIO Memo, \nECF No. 15-5 at 15. If an individual was determined to be \nsubject to the CDC Orders, they were to be “transported to the \nnearest POE and immediately returned to Mexico or Canada \ndepending on their point of transit.” Id. at 17. The CAPIO Memo, \n“provide[d] no instructions on medical screenings or other \nprocedures for determining whether a covered noncitizen may have \nCOVID-19,” Compl., ECF No. 1 at 17 ¶ 68; and did “not exempt \nminors from forcible expulsion,” id. at 18 ¶ 69. \n                     \n3 Plaintiff refers to the process under 42 U.S.C. § 265 as the \n“Title 42 Process,” see Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mot., ECF No. 15; \nwhile the Government refers to it as the “CDC Order.” See \nGov’t’s Combined Opp’n, ECF No. 42 at 12.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 11 of 50\n  On September 11, 2020, the CDC published its final rule. \nSee Control of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: \nSuspension of the Right To Introduce and Prohibition of \nIntroduction of Persons Into United States From Designated \nForeign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes, 85 Fed. \nReg. 56424-01, 2020 WL 5439721, (Sept. 11, 2020) (Effective \nOctober 13, 2020) (“Final Rule”). The Final Rule, which \nreferences this case but makes no changes to its determinations \nand findings as relevant for this action, see id. at 56437, \nstates “[i]t has long been recognized that ‘where a general \npower is conferred or duty enjoined, every particular power \nnecessary for the exercise of the one, or the performance of the \nother, is also conferred.’” Id. at 56445. It further states that \n“HHS/CDC identifies particular powers that it may exercise under \n[Section 265] by defining the phrase to ‘[p]rohibit, in whole or \nin part, the introduction into the United States of persons’ to \nmean ‘to prevent the introduction of persons into the United \nStates by suspending any right to introduce into the United \nStates, physically stopping or restricting movement into the \nUnited States, or physically expelling from the United States \nsome or all of the persons.’” Id. \n3. CDC Orders’ Effect on Plaintiff  \nPlaintiff is a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala, who entered \nthe United States in August 2020, was apprehended by CBP and \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 12 of 50\ninitially held in CBP custody in McAllen, Texas, before he was \nmade subject to expulsion pursuant to the CDC Orders and CAPIO \nMemo. See id. at 19 ¶¶ 77, 81. His father lives in the United \nStates and has a pending immigration case. See id. ¶ 78. \nPlaintiff is from “an indigenous Mayan family” and alleges to \nhave (1) “experienced severe persecution in Guatemala” due to \nhis father’s political opinions; and (2) had his life threatened \ndue to his refusal to join a gang. Id. ¶ 79. He states that, if \nhe is “allowed to remain in the United States, he could live \nwith his father . . . or another suitable sponsor.” Id. ¶ 84. \nFurther, Plaintiff asserts that, “even if [he is] required to \nfirst reside for a short time in a[n] ORR children[’s] shelter, \nhe could do so safely . . . [because] ORR facilities [] have \nexperience with communicable diseases . . . [and] are currently \nwell under capacity, [which would allow for] social distancing \nand quarantine[ing].” Id. at 20 ¶ 85. Plaintiff alleges that, \ninstead of remaining in CBP custody, he “could have been \ntransferred directly to his father or another sponsor or to an \nORR shelter, [and] he would [have] pose[d] minimal, if any, \nadditional risk to border agents.” Id. ¶ 88. On August 14, 2020, \nafter Plaintiff filed this action and a motion for class \ncertification, the Government exempted him from the CDC Orders. \nSee Escobar Francisco Decl., ECF No. 14-1 at 2 ¶ 11.  \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 13 of 50\n4. CDC Orders’ General Effect on Unaccompanied Children \nPlaintiff alleges that unaccompanied children have “been \nrequired to remain in DHS custody longer than the time it would \nhave taken to transfer them to their family members or to an ORR \nfacility,” Compl., ECF No. 1 at 20 ¶ 89; and that “arranging for \nair transport to deport individuals will generally take longer \nthan time in which DHS must transfer children to ORR or family \nmembers.” Id. at 21 ¶ 90. He further alleges that some \nunaccompanied “children are held for days or weeks in hotels \n[as] they await flights back to their home countries, [while] \n[o]thers are detained in CBP facilities near the border, \nreportedly held in cage-like settings with other children.” Id. \n¶ 91. Finally, Plaintiff states,  \nUnaccompanied  children  subject  to  the  [CDC \nOrders] face numerous problems accessing legal \nrepresentation.  Because  children  can  be \nexpelled under Title 42 in a matter of days, \nthe  child  or  any  family  member  who  obtains \ninformation about the child has only a limited \namount of time in which to advocate for the \nchild. And because the [] Process [pursuant to \nthe  CDC  Orders]  has  operated  largely  in \nsecret, its rules and procedures have remained \nopaque  to  children,  their  parents,  and  any \nlawyers and advocates who seek to help them. \nUnaccompanied  children  are  also  unable,  by \nreason of their youth, to advocate effectively \nfor themselves, especially when detained in \ncustodial  settings  by  government  officers. \nMany do not speak English, and lack even a \nbasic comprehension of the U.S. legal system. \nTheir  relatives  are  similarly  not  well-\nsituated  to  help  navigate  this  process, \nespecially given the time constraints; many \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 14 of 50\nchildren  are  from  families  in  which  few \nmembers have had significant formal schooling, \nmuch less any fluency in English. \n \nId. at 21-22 ¶ 93. At the time he filed his motion for \npreliminary injunction, Plaintiff alleged that the DHS had \n“already expelled at least 2,000 unaccompanied children pursuant \nto the CDC Order[s],” Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mem., ECF No. 15-1 at \n10; but Plaintiff now alleges that the number of expelled \nunaccompanied children had “exceeded 13,000 by the end of \nOctober.” Pl.’s Notice of November 17, 2020, ECF No. 78.4 \nB. Procedural Background \nPlaintiff filed this action on August 14, 2020, see Compl., \nECF No. 1; and a motion for class certification, see Pl.’s Cert. \nMot., ECF No. 2, that same day. On August 20, 2020, Plaintiff \nfiled a motion for a classwide preliminary injunction. See Pl.’s \nPrelim. Inj. Mot., ECF No. 15. The Government filed its Combined \nOpposition to Plaintiff’s Motions for Class Certification and \nfor Classwide Preliminary Injunction (“Gov’t’s Combined Opp’n”) \non September 8, 2020, see Gov’t’s Combined Opp’n, ECF No. 42; \nand Plaintiff filed his Combined Reply Memorandum in Support of \nMotions for Classwide Preliminary Injunction and Class \n                     \n4 Citing to Hamed Aleaziz, Border Officials Turned Away \nUnaccompanied Immigrant Children More Than 13,000 Times Under \nTrump’s Pandemic Policy, BuzzFeed News (Oct. 28, 2020), \nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/border-\nofficials-turned-away-unaccompanied-immigrants. \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 15 of 50\nCertification (“Pl.’s Combined Reply”) on September 15, 2020. \nPl.’s Combined Reply, ECF No. 52.  \nMagistrate Judge Harvey, having been referred Plaintiff’s \nmotions and this case for full case management, issued his R. & \nR. on September 25, 2020. See R. & R., ECF No. 65; see also \nSept. 6, 2020 Min. Order. The Government submitted objections to \nthe R. & R. on October 2, 2020, see Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69; \nPlaintiff filed his Response to the Government’s Objections on \nOctober 9, 2020, see Pl.’s Resp., ECF No. 72; and the Government \nfiled its Reply to Plaintiff’s Response to the Government’s \nObjections (“Gov’t’s Objs. Reply”) on October 14, 2020, see \nGov’t’s Objs. Reply, ECF No. 75. The objections are ripe and \nready for the Court’s adjudication. \nII.  Legal Standards  \nA. Objections to a Magistrate Judge’s Report and \nRecommendation \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), a party \nmay file specific written objections once a magistrate judge has \nentered a recommended disposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1)-(2). \nA district court “may accept, reject or modify the recommended \ndisposition.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); see also 28 U.S.C. § \n636(b)(1) (“A judge of the court may accept, reject, or modify, \nin whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the \nmagistrate judge.”). A district court “must determine de novo \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 16 of 50\nany part of the magistrate judge’s disposition that has been \nproperly objected to.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).“If, however, \nthe party makes only conclusory or general objections, or simply \nreiterates his original arguments, the Court reviews the [R. & \nR.] only for clear error.” Houlahan v. Brown, 979 F. Supp. 2d \n86, 88 (D.D.C. 2013) (citation omitted). “Under the clearly \nerroneous standard, the magistrate judge’s decision is entitled \nto great deference” and “is clearly erroneous only if on the \nentire evidence the court is left with the definite and firm \nconviction that a mistake has been committed.” Buie v. D.C., No. \nCV 16-1920 (CKK), 2019 WL 4345712, at *3 (D.D.C. Sept. 12, 2019) \n(citing Graham v. Mukasey, 608 F. Supp. 2d 50, 52 (D.D.C. 2009)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). \nObjections must “specifically identify the portions \nof the proposed findings and recommendations to which objection \nis made and the basis for objection.” LCvR 72.3(b).“[O]bjections \nwhich merely rehash an argument presented to and considered by \nthe magistrate judge are not ‘properly objected to’ and are \ntherefore not entitled to de novo review.” Shurtleff v. EPA, 991 \nF. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Morgan v. Astrue, No. \n08-2133, 2009 WL 3541001, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 30,2009)).  \nB. Preliminary Injunction  \n“A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must \nestablish [1] that he is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 17 of 50\nthat he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.” \nAamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (alteration \nin original) (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011)). Where the federal government is the opposing \nparty, the balance of equities and public interest factors \nmerge. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). A \npreliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only \nbe awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled \nto such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 22 (2008) (citation omitted). “The purpose of a \npreliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative \npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \nheld.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). In \nthis Circuit, the four factors have typically been evaluated on \na “sliding scale,” such that if “the movant makes an unusually \nstrong showing on one of the factors, then it does not \nnecessarily have to make as strong a showing on another factor.” \nDavis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291–92 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009). \nIn the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter v. \nNatural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008), “the D.C. \nCircuit has suggested that a positive showing on all four \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 18 of 50\npreliminary injunction factors may be required.” Holmes v. FEC, \n71 F. Supp. 3d 178, 183 n.4 (D.D.C. 2014); see also Sherley, 644 \nF.3d at 393 (“[W]e read Winter at least to suggest if not to \nhold that a likelihood of success is an independent, \nfreestanding requirement for a preliminary injunction.”) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted)). Nonetheless, “the \nCircuit has had no occasion to decide this question because it \nhas not yet encountered a post-Winter case where a preliminary \ninjunction motion survived the less rigorous sliding-scale \nanalysis.” ConverDyn v. Moniz, 68 F. Supp. 3d 34, 46 n.2 (D.D.C. \n2014). \nIII.  Analysis \n  Before proceeding to its analysis, the Court observes that \nanother court in this District recently examined CBP’s new \nprocess pursuant to the CDC Orders, in a case with facts similar \nto those before this Court. In J. B. B. C. v. WOLF, et al., \nDocket No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. filed June 9, 2020), the \nplaintiff, a 16-year-old boy from Honduras, whose father also \nlives in the United States and had a pending asylum case, was \napprehended by CBP when he entered the country near El Paso, \nTexas and made subject to expulsion pursuant to the CDC Orders \nand CAPIO Memo. J. B. B. C. Compl., Dkt No. 20-cv-1509, ECF No. \n1 at 19-20 ¶¶ 76-80. At the time he filed his complaint, the \nplaintiff in J. B. B. C., had been in a hotel for five days as \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 19 of 50\nCBP moved under the new process to place him on a flight to \nHonduras. Id. ¶¶ 83-84. Since his expulsion was imminent, he \nfiled a motion for temporary restraining order (“T.R.O.”) that \nsame day, presenting many of the same arguments as presented in \nthis case. See generally, J. B. B. C. Emergency Mot. for T.R.O., \nECF No. 2. At a June 24, 2020 hearing, Judge Nichols granted the \nTRO, finding that the J. B. B. C. plaintiff was likely to \nsucceed on the merits. J. B. B. C. Hr’g Tr., Dkt No. 20-cv-1509, \nECF No. 39 at 49-50.  \nSpecifically, Judge Nichols found that: (1) Section 265 does \nnot grant the CDC Director the power to return or remove, in \nlight of the fact that immigration statutes directly “reference \nthe power to return or to remove,” id. at 50; (2) Section 265 \n“should be harmonized, to the maximum extent possible, with \nimmigration statutes,” id.; and (3) the CDC Director is not \nentitled to deference under Chevron, USA, Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984), because Section 265 \nmust be “read in light of statutes that the CDC Director quite \nplainly has no special expertise regarding and . . . the order \ndoes very little by way of an analysis of what exactly the power \nto prohibit the introduction of persons and property means,” id. \nat 51-50. Notably, after Judge Nichols’s ruling, the Government \ntransferred the J. B. B. C. plaintiff to ORR, noting that he \nwould “no longer be subject to the challenged CDC Order” and \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 20 of 50\nclaimed that the case was moot. J. B. B. C. Notice to Ct., Dkt \nNo. 20-cv-1509, ECF No. 41 at 1. When the J. B. B. C. plaintiff \nfiled an amended complaint, adding another plaintiff, E.Y.E., a \n15-year-old boy from Guatemala, who claimed to be escaping an \nabusive grandfather and aunt, and who had siblings in the United \nStates who had been granted asylum the previous year based on \nsimilar claims, the Government excepted him from the CDC Orders \nas well. See J. B. B. C. Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt No. 20-cv-1509, \nECF No. 47 at 9. The J. B. B. C. plaintiffs then voluntarily \ndismissed the case. See J. B. B. C. Notice of Voluntary \nDismissal, Dkt No. 20-cv-1509, ECF No. 48.  \nA. Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification \nPursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n23(b)(2), Plaintiff has sought certification of the following \nclass: All unaccompanied noncitizen children who (1) are or will \nbe detained in U.S. government custody in the United States, and \n(2) are or will be subjected to the Title 42 Process (“Subject \nClass”). Pl.’s Cert. Mot., ECF No. 2 at 1. \nMagistrate Judge Harvey found that Plaintiff’s motion for \nclass certification should be provisionally granted because \nPlaintiff met the: (1) numerosity requirement by providing \nevidence that almost 6,000 unaccompanied non-citizen children \nwere apprehended at the southwest border between April and July \n2020, [and] more than 2,000 unaccompanied non-citizen children \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 21 of 50\nhad been expelled, R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 17; (2) commonality \nrequirement because the challenged CDC Orders are a “a uniform \npolicy or practice that affects all class members,” id. at 18; \n(3) typicality requirement since Plaintiff’s claims and the \nclaims of the putative class “stem from a unitary course of \nconduct—expulsion of unaccompanied non-citizen children” under \nthe CDC Orders and “are based on the same legal theories,” id. \nat 19; (4) adequacy requirement because, citing to JD v. Azar, \n925 F.3d 1291, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam), the \n“Plaintiff is an adequate class representative who, with his \ncounsel, will vigorously pursue the claims of the putative \nclass,” id. at 21; and the cohesiveness requirement because the \nGovernment allegedly applied the same illegal CDC Orders to the \nPlaintiff and Subject Class, and the Plaintiff and Subject Class \nseek the same relief, see id. at 22. \nThe Government’s only objection to Magistrate Judge \nHarvey’s recommendation is that the case upon which he relied—\nJ.D. v. Azar-was wrongly decided because allowing a Plaintiff \nwhose claims are moot to serve as a class representative “is an \nimproper relaxation of Article III’s strict requirement of a \ncase or controversy.” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 38.  \nHowever, J.D. v. Azar is binding precedent on this Court. \nSee Hopkins v. Price Waterhouse, 920 F.2d 967, 975 (D.C. Cir. \n1990)(“[T]he trial court . . . [is] nonetheless bound by the law \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 22 of 50\nof the circuit.”). Furthermore, the actions the Government has \ntaken to avoid judicial scrutiny by mooting the claims of the \nunaccompanied children, Plaintiff’s counsel bring to their \nattention, arguably reveals an intent to make Plaintiff’s claim \n“so inherently transitory that the [Court] will not have [] \nenough time to rule on [the] motion for class certification \nbefore the proposed representative's individual interest \nexpires.” J.D., 925 F.3d at 1309. However, the “relation back” \ndoctrine, which allows a “motion for certification [to] ‘relate \nback’ to the filing of the complaint,” id. at 1308; was created \nso that a class would not be deprived of its day in court by a \ndefendant simply exempting the class representatives in order to \nmoot the class’ claims, see Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 \nU.S. 44, 51 (1991); see also Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. 204, 213 \nn.11 (1978) (holding that the State’s action of excepting some \nof the named plaintiffs “did not deprive the District Court of \nthe power to certify the class action”). Having addressed the \nGovernment’s sole objection to this recommendation, and finding \nno clear error in this portion of the R. & R., the Court ADOPTS \nMagistrate Judge Harvey’s recommendation, and PROVISIONALLY \nGRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. Pl.’s Cert. \nMot., ECF No. 2. \n   \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 23 of 50\nB. Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n1. Plaintiff is likely to Succeed on the Merits  \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and Local \nCivil Rule 65.1, Plaintiff seeks a “classwide preliminary \ninjunction enjoining the application of the [CDC Orders] to \nPlaintiff and Class Members.” Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mot., ECF No. \n15 at 1. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits because (1) Section 265 “does not \nauthorize deportation”; (2) “unaccompanied children are entitled \nto explicit statutory procedures and protections [and those] \nlater-enacted statutes control over whatever [Section] 265 may \nauthorize in general”; and (3) “subjecting Class Members to the \nCDC Orders is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the” APA. \nPl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mem., ECF No. 15-1 at 21. \nMagistrate Judge Harvey found “that Plaintiff is likely to \nprevail in his argument that the CDC Orders instituting the \nTitle 42 Process exceed the authority granted by Congress \npursuant to Section 265,” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 24; noting that \nthe Government’s “parsing of the plain text of the statute makes \nan unsupported (and unwarranted) logical leap . . . by asserting \nthat ‘[t]he statute’s reference to prohibiting the introduction \n‘in whole or in part’ supports the interpretation that a person \nmay be intercepted and then quarantined in the United States or \nintercepted and then expelled,’” id. at 25 (emphasis in \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 24 of 50\noriginal); see also Final Rule at 56425–26. The Government makes \na number of objections, which the Court addresses below. \nChevron provides the framework for reviewing an agency’s \ninterpretation of a statute that the agency is charged with \nadministering. See 467 U.S. at 837. The first step in this \nreview process is for the court to determine “whether Congress \nhas directly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Id. at \n842. “If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the \nmatter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect \nto the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id. at 842–\n43. In determining whether the statute unambiguously expresses \nthe intent of Congress, the court should use all the \n“traditional tools of statutory construction,” including looking \nto the text and structure of the statute, as well as its \nlegislative history, if appropriate. See id. at 843 n.9; see \nalso Bell Atlantic Tel. Co. v. FCC, 131 F.3d 1044, 1047 (D.C. \nCir. 1997). If the court concludes that the statute is either \nsilent or ambiguous with respect to the precise question at \nissue, the second step of the court’s review process is to \ndetermine whether the interpretation proffered by the agency is \n“based on a permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, \n467 U.S. at 843. The court must defer to agency interpretations \nthat are not “arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to \nthe statute.” Id. at 844.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 25 of 50\na. Section 265 Likely Does Not Authorize \nExpulsions \n \nThe Court first reviews “the language of the statute \nitself.” United States Ass'n of Reptile Keepers, Inc. v. Zinke, \n852 F.3d 1131, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Both Plaintiff and the \nGovernment provide various definitions for the word \n“introduction” and the phrase “prohibit . . . the introduction \nof.” See Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mem., ECF No. 15-1 at 25-26 (citing \nIntroduce, Universal English Dictionary 1067 (John Craig ed. \n1861) (the “term—'introduction’—meant then, as now, ‘the act of \nbringing into a country.’”); Gov’t’s Combined Opp’n, ECF No. 42 \nat 29-30 (citing Universal English Dictionary 458 (John Craig \ned. 1869) (“to ‘prohibit . . . the introduction’ naturally means \nto intercept or prevent such a process.”). The Government \nfurther states the meaning of the word “prohibit” is “to forbid; \nto interdict by authority; to hinder; to debar; to prevent; [or] \nto preclude.” Gov’t’s Combined Opp’n, ECF No. 42 at 30 (citing \nProhibit, Oxford English Dictionary 1441 (1933)). Based on these \ndefinitions, the Government argues that Section 265 “clearly \nincludes the authority to intercept persons who have already \ncrossed the border and are in the process of being introduced \ninto the United States.” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 16. \nMagistrate Judge Harvey assumed without deciding that the \nGovernment’s interpretation—intercepting or preventing a process \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 26 of 50\nwas legally sound, finding that even if the court “accept[s] \nthat ‘to ‘prohibit . . . the introduction’ means ‘to intercept \nor prevent such a process’, [it] does not lead to the conclusion \nthat ‘prohibition,’ ‘interception,’ or ‘prevention’ includes \n‘expulsion.’” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 25. Magistrate Judge Harvey \nreasoned that to “prohibit” “connotes stopping something before \nit begins, rather than remedying it afterwards.” Id. at 25-26.  \nThe Government argues that Magistrate Judge Harvey’s \nreasoning—that “the Government’s interpretation is wrong because \nthe definition of ‘prohibit’ connote[s] stopping something \nbefore it begins, rather than remedying it afterwards,” R. & R., \nECF No. 65 at 25-26;—“makes no sense” because he “[a]ssumed \nwithout deciding that the government’s interpretation of the \n‘introduction’ and the phrase ‘prohibit . . . the introduction’ \nof are legally sound,” id. at 25; and since the CDC Order only \napplies to persons who are in the process of being introduced \nrather than already introduced, expelling them does not remedy \nsomething afterwards because they have not been introduced, see \nGov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 17. The Court disagrees. Even \naccepting that the phrase, “prohibit[ing] . . . the introduction \nof,” means “intercepting” or “preventing”; the phrase does not \nencompass expulsion; but merely means that the process of \nintroduction can be halted. Expelling persons, as a matter of \nordinary language, is entirely different from interrupting, \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 27 of 50\nintercepting, or halting the process of introduction.5 Put \nanother way, interrupting, intercepting, or halting the process \nof introduction does inexorably lead to expulsion.  \nNeither Section 265 nor any of the definitions provided by \nthe Government contain the word “expel.” They do not even \ncontain synonyms of the word expel, such as “eject” or “evict.” \nSee Synonyms for Expel, Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-\nWebster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expel (last \nvisited Oct. 27, 2020). The Court finds this to be significant, \nbecause even “broad rulemaking power must be exercised within \nthe bounds set by Congress,” Merck & Co. v. United States Dep't \nof Health & Human Servs., 385 F. Supp. 3d 81, 92 (D.D.C. 2019), \naff'd, 962 F.3d 531 (D.C. Cir. 2020); and the CDC “does not \n[have the] power to revise clear statutory terms,” Util. Air \nReg. Grp., 573 U.S. at 327. To be sure, as Plaintiff and \nMagistrate Judge Harvey point out, “when Congress wants to grant \nthe power to expel individuals out of the United States, it does \nso plainly.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 29. For example, in the \nChinese Exclusion Act of 1882, enacted only eleven years before \nthe 1893 Act, Congress was very explicit in its deportation \n                     \n5 With regard to the Government’s objection to Magistrate Judge \nHarvey finding support for this interpretation in the title of \nSection 265: “Suspension of entries and imports from designated \nplaces to prevent spread of communicable diseases,” 42 U.S.C. § \n265; his point was that Section 265 does not address expulsion, \nnot the meaning of entry as a matter of immigration law. \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 28 of 50\nrequirements, declaring “it shall not be lawful for any Chinese \nlaborer to come, or, having so come . . . ninety days [after the \nAct], to remain within the United States.” Chinese Exclusion Act \nof May 6, 1882, ch. 126, § 1 (emphasis added).  \nFinally, the Government objects on the grounds that \nMagistrate Judge Harvey’s interpretation leads to an absurd, \nunworkable result because it results in Section 265 being \nwithout effect at land borders. Gov’t’s Opp’n, ECF No. 69 at 18-\n19. However, Magistrate Judge Harvey persuasively explained why \nhis interpretation does not result in Section 265 being without \neffect at land borders. R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 36-38. \nb. The Statutory Context Provides Support for \nInterpreting Section 265 to Likely Not \nAuthorize Expulsions \n \nSince “statutory language cannot be construed in a vacuum, \n. . . [i]t is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that \nthe words of a statute must be read in their context and with a \nview to their place in the overall statutory scheme.” Davis v. \nMichigan Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989) (citing \nUnited States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828 (1984)); see also K \nMart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291 (1988) (“In \nascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must \nlook to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as \nthe language and design of the statute as a whole.”). Plaintiff \nargues that neither Section 265 nor “a neighboring provision \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 29 of 50\nlaying out the ‘penalties’ for violation of ‘any regulation \nprescribed’ under § 265 make any mention of such expulsion \nauthority.” Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mem., ECF No. 15-1 at 22 (citing \n42 U.S.C. § 271). The Government contends that “the explicit \nlanguage in Section 265 authorizing the prohibition of persons \n(or property) from ‘a foreign country’ to protect against ‘the \nintroduction of such disease into the United States’. . . [in] \ncontext . . . clearly includes expulsion.” Gov’t’s Combined \nOpp’n, ECF No. 42 at 31. Citing the CDC’s additional reliance on \n“42 U.S.C. § 264 (‘Section 264’), entitled ‘Regulations to \ncontrol communicable diseases’” which authorizes the CDC “to \nmake and enforce such regulations . . . to prevent the \nintroduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases \nfrom foreign countries into the States or possessions,” \nMagistrate Judge Harvey looked to that adjacent Section and \nfound that it “does not contemplate regulations that authorize \nexpulsion from the United States. . . . [but] only regulations \nthat ‘provide for the apprehension, detention, or conditional \nrelease of individuals.’” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 27. Magistrate \nJudge Harvey observed that “in a section where one would expect \nthe term to appear—where Congress has delineated the \ngovernment’s power to prevent the spread of contagious disease \nfrom individuals coming into the United States from a foreign \ncountry—it does not.” Id. at 27-28.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 30 of 50\nThe Government points to the rule of statutory construction \nthat requires a statute to be construed in a manner such that \nparticular construction does not render another provision \nsuperfluous to argue that Magistrate Judge Harvey’s reasoning \nwas flawed because if Section 264 authorized expulsion, Section \n265 would be superfluous. Gov’t’s Opp’n, ECF No. 69 at 20. The \nCourt disagrees. That “Section 264 does not contemplate \nregulations that authorize expulsion from the United States,” R. \n& R., ECF No. 65 at 27; provides contextual support for \ninterpreting Section 265 to not provide authority to expel \npersons. Plaintiffs have conceded that Section 265 vests the \ngovernment with significant “authority to bar entry into the \ncountry, at least through the regulation of vessels (including \nairplanes) arriving in the United States.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 \nat 36. Accordingly, interpreting Section 265 to not authorize \nexpulsions does not render the provision superfluous. \nIn addition, the Government also argues that Magistrate \nJudge Harvey erred when he concluded that Congress could not \nhave delegated the authority by silence by not expressly \nproviding for expulsion authority in Section 265 because that \nsection expressly delegated the power to issue regulations that \naccomplish its purpose. Gov’t’s Obj., ECF No. 69 at 20. The \nGovernment’s argument is beside the point; if Section 265 does \nnot provide the authority to expel persons; then it does not \n30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 31 of 50\ndelegate the authority to issue regulations to expel persons. \nThe Government further argues that just because this is the \nfirst time it has claimed that Section 265 provides it with the \nauthority to expel persons since the provision was enacted 75 \nyears ago does not mean that it does not have such authority. \nId. The Government cites the historic and unprecedented nature \nof the pandemic and the legislative history of the Section 265 \nto argue that if “Section 265 authority is sparingly used only \ntracks the extraordinary nature of the authority and the fact \nthat it is very rarely needed.” Id. at 22. The Court agrees that \nthe undisputed authority granted in Section 265 is extraordinary \nand that the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. But that is \nentirely distinguishable from whether or not Section 265 \nauthorizes the Government to expel persons. The Court also notes \nthat the legislative history cited by the Government provides \nnot support for its position that Section 265 authorizes it to \nexpel persons.6 \nBeyond Section 264, Magistrate Judge Harvey noted that the \n“statute is shot through with references to quarantine . . . but \n                     \n6 The Government also argues that the situation here is \ndistinguishable from the newly discovered power at issue in \nUtility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014). \nGov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 21-22. Magistrate Judge Harvey’s \ninvocation of this authority, however, is only one of the \nmultitude of reasons why plaintiff is likely to succeed on the \nmerits of his claim. \n \n31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 32 of 50\nit contains not a word about the power of the [CDC] to expel \nanyone who has come into the country.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 28 \n(citing 42 U.S.C., Chap. 6A, Subchap. II, Part G (entitled \n“Quarantine and Inspection.”); 42 U.S.C. § 267 (entitled \n“Quarantine stations, grounds, and anchorages”); 42 U.S.C. § 268 \n(entitled “Quarantine duties of consular and other officers”); \n42 U.S.C. § 270 (entitled “Quarantine regulations governing \ncivil air navigation and civil aircraft”); 42 U.S.C. § 271 \n(entitled “Penalties for violation of quarantine laws”); 42 \nU.S.C. § 272 (entitled “Administration of oaths by quarantine \nofficers”)). The statutory scheme reflects Congress’s focus on \nthe public’s health, authorizing the CDC to create regulations \nthat allow for the “apprehension, detention, examination, or \nconditional release of individuals” entering from foreign \ncountries to stop the spread of communicable diseases from those \ncountries, 42 U.S.C. § 264; and then in times of serious danger, \nto halt the “introduction of persons” from designated foreign \ncountries. 42 U.S.C. § 265. Notably, Congress established \nspecific penalties for violations of any of the CDC’s \nregulations pursuant to Sections 264, 265, 266 (entitled \n“Special Quarantine Powers in Time of War”), and 269 (entitled \n“Bills of health”). 42 U.S.C. § 271. However, not only is \nexpulsion not mentioned in the statute, but all of these \nsections, including Section 265, are referred to as “quarantine \n32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 33 of 50\nlaws,” suggesting that the CDC’s powers were limited to \nquarantine and containment. Id.  \nc. Harmonizing Section 265 With Relevant \nImmigration Statutes Provides Support for \nInterpreting Section 265 to Likely Not \nAuthorize Expulsions \n \nIn conducting his contextual analysis and in harmonizing \nSection 265 with immigration statutes, Magistrate Judge Harvey: \n(1) notes that several immigration statutes under Title 8 use \nwords such as “remove” or “return,” whereas none of these words \nare found in Section 265, see R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 30; and (2) \nfinds the Government’s reading of Section 265 to include the \npower to expel “unaccompanied minors like Plaintiff and the \nputative class members, . . . conflicts with various rights \ngranted in the TVPRA and the INA,” id. at 32. Citing to dicta \nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 25 (1983), the \nGovernment objects to this by arguing that “‘language in one \nstatute usually sheds little light upon the meaning of different \nlanguage in another statute.’” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 22 \n(internal brackets omitted). In that vein, the Government argues \nthat (1) statutes such as Section 265 which is “designed to \nprohibit the introduction of persons into the United States to \navoid the spread of a communicable disease into the country” \nshould not be compared to immigration statutes which are \n“designed to confer immigration benefits based on an alien’s \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 34 of 50\nindividual circumstances” because the statutes have different \naims, id. at 22-23; and (2) “statutes are already in harmony—the \nimmigration provisions are of general applicability, and Section \n265 temporarily suspends their effects in limited circumstances” \nsuch as a national emergency, id. at 24-25. The Government’s \narguments are unpersuasive.  \n“It is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation \nthat absent provision[s] cannot be supplied by the courts.” \nRotkiske v. Klemm, 140 S. Ct. 355, 360–61 (2019) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted). First, as Plaintiff \npoints out and Magistrate Judge Harvey agrees, “the Supreme \nCourt routinely points to other statutes as evidence that \nCongress knows how to legislate in particular ways.” Pl.’s \nCombined Reply, ECF No. 52 at 15 (collecting cases); see also R. \n& R., ECF No. 65 at 30 n.11. In view of current immigration \nlaws, which speak to deportation by using words such as “remove” \nand “return,” see 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(3A) (“[t]he Attorney \nGeneral shall prescribe conditions . . . to . . . return . . . \ninadmissible aliens”); § 1182(h)(2) (“No waiver shall be granted \n. . . for a period of not less than 7 years immediately \npreceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the \nalien from the United States.”) (emphasis added); the Court \nrecognizes, as did Judge Nichols, that “[t]here's a serious \nquestion about whether [Section 265’s] power includes the power \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 35 of 50\n. . . to remove or exclude persons who are already present in \nthe United States” and the “fact that Congress did not use \n[words such as ‘return’ or ‘remove’] . . . . suggests at a \nminimum that the power to remove is not granted by [S]ection \n265,” J. B. B. C. Hr’g Tr., Dkt No. 20-cv-1509, ECF No. 39 at \n50. \nThe Government contends that Section 265 contains a \n“clearly expressed congressional intention” to suspend the \neffect of Title 8 because Section 265 authorizes the suspension \nof other laws that provide for the right to introduce persons \ninto the country. Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 25. The \nGovernment argues that Magistrate Judge Harvey was wrong to rely \non the absence of the phrase “[n]otwithstanding any other \nprovision of law” in Section 265 for the proposition that it was \nnot meant to suspend the effect of relevant Title 8 provisions \nbecause that phrase would logically appear in a subsequently \nenacted statute, but the relevant Title 8 provisions were \nenacted subsequent to Section 265. Id. However, the phrase \n“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law” is not used to \nsupersede only earlier-enacted statutes, but is properly read as \n“Congress’s indication that the statute containing that language \nis intended to take precedence over any pre-existing or \nsubsequently-enacted legislation on the same subject.” U.S. v. \nPuentes, 803 F.3d 597, 606 (11th Cir. 2015)(internal citation \n35 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 36 of 50\nomitted). Further, the Government’s contention that Section 265 \nand the relevant provisions of Title 8 are not on the “same \nsubject” is unavailing since the Government intends to use \nSection 265 to expel persons from the United States just as \nTitle 8 provides for the removal of persons.  \nThe Government also argues that Magistrate Judge Harvey had \nno “sound reason” to conclude that the phrase “suspension of the \nright to introduce” in Section 265 is not a “clearly expressed \ncongressional intention” to suspend the effect of Title 8 \nprovisions. Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 26. Rather, according \nto the Government, the legislative history of the predecessor \nstatute shows that Congress intended to authorize the temporary \nsuspension of the immigration laws. Id. at 26-27. However, the \nlanguage of Section 265 contains no “clear intention” to \nauthorize the suspension of the relevant provisions of Title 8. \nEpic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1632 (2018).  \nThe Government further argues that Magistrate Judge Harvey \nimproperly invoked the canon of “the specific governs the \ngeneral” to find that the relevant provisions of Title 8 take \nprecedence over Section 265 because his reasoning—that “[i]t is \nnot clear how Section 265 . . . could be considered more \nspecifically targeted to matters of immigration or as providing \nmore specific solutions,” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 36;—is flawed \nbecause “Section 265 is not designed to target immigration at \n36 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 37 of 50\nall . . . it is a public health provision designed only to \naddress the specific and rare instance of a public health crisis \npresented by the outbreak of a communicable disease.” Gov’t’s \nObjs., ECF No. 69 at 28. Since the Government concedes that \n“Section 265 is not designed to target immigration at all” it \nclearly cannot be the more specific statute when it is being \nrelied upon to expel unaccompanied children who are entitled to \nprotections under the relevant provisions of Title 8. Id. \nFinally, the Government argues that Magistrate Judge Harvey \nerred in dismissing its “argument that Section 265 would be \nrendered a nullity if it must be applied in conjunction with \nimmigration provisions.” Id. at 28-29. However, as explained \nsupra, Magistrate Judge Harvey persuasively explained why his \ninterpretation does not result in Section 265 rendered a \nnullity. R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 36-38. \nd. The Government’s Interpretation of Section \n265 is Likely Not Entitled to Chevron \nDeference \n \nMagistrate Judge Harvey found that because the statute is \nnot ambiguous using traditional tools of statutory \ninterpretation, there was no need to reach step two of the \nChevron analysis.7 R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 38 n.15. He stated, \n                     \n7 Because he found the statute to be unambiguous, Magistrate \nJudge Harvey improperly invoked the constitutional avoidance \ndoctrine. See McFadden v. United States, 576 U.S. 186, 197 \n(2015) (noting that the “canon of constitutional avoidance . . . \n37 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 38 of 50\nhowever, that even if there were ambiguity, he would find, as \ndid Judge Nichols, that deference would not be justified because \nthe question for the claim is purely legal and does not depend \nupon the CDC’s scientific and technical expertise. See id.  \nThe Government argues that, pursuant to Chevron, “simply \nbecause a question is purely legal says nothing about whether \nthe Court should defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation \nof the statute it administers.” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 30. \nThe Government contends that it is within CDC’s delegated \nauthority and expertise to interpret the word “introduction” \nbecause in interpreting the word, the CDC “utilized [its] \nscientific and technical knowledge and experience regarding \ncommunicable diseases generally and applied it to the specific \npublic health threat here.” Id. at 31. Assuming for the purpose \nof responding to the Government’s objections that the term is \nambiguous, the Court disagrees that the CDC’s interpretation \nimplicates its scientific and technical expertise because the \nGovernment has not explained how that scientific and technical \nexpertise lead it to interpreting “introduction” to encompass \n“expulsion.” Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2416 (2019) \n                     \nhas no application in the interpretation of an unambiguous \nstatute . . .”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Magistrate \nJudge Harvey’s invocation of this canon, however, is only one of \nthe multitude of reasons why plaintiff is likely to succeed on \nthe merits of his claim.  \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 39 of 50\n(noting that “[a] court must make an independent inquiry into \nwhether the character and context of the agency interpretation \nentitled it to controlling weight”). Accordingly, CDC is not \nentitled to deference with respect to its interpretation.  \nFor the reasons above, the Court ADOPTS Magistrate Judge \nHarvey’s finding that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the \nmerits of his claim. \n2. Irreparable Injury \nPlaintiff contends that, at the time he filed his \ncomplaint, he was likely to suffer an irreparable injury if he \nwas expelled under Section 265 because he would have been “sent \nsummarily back to Guatemala without any meaningful opportunity \nto assert his claims for relief, and where he would have faced \ngrave harm from those he sought to escape.” Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. \nMem., ECF No. 15-1 at 39. Further, Plaintiff provided \ndeclarations demonstrating that returned children are \n“frequently trafficked from rural to urban areas and across \nborders or to border areas, where they are often sexually \nexploited or subject to exploitative labor.” Lisa Frydman Decl., \nECF No. 15-12 ¶ 6.  \nMagistrate Judge Harvey found that Plaintiff “adequately \nestablished a likelihood of irreparable injury should a \npreliminary injunction not issue,” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 41; \nbecause “Plaintiff has presented declarations from attorneys \n39 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 40 of 50\nrepresenting numerous unaccompanied children who have crossed \nthe border and have bona fide claims for humanitarian relief, \nincluding fear of persecution on the basis of protected \ncharacteristics, but have been subjected to the [CDC Orders] and \nthreatened with deportation prior to receiving any of the \nprotections the immigration laws provide,” id. at 39. \nThe Government’s sole objection is that Magistrate Judge \nHarvey “improperly collapse[d] independent requirements such \nthat Plaintiff’s purported likelihood of success on the merits \napparently establishes irreparable harm.” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. \n69 at 32. \nMagistrate Judge Harvey was persuaded that Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Provisional Class demonstrated that in the \nabsence of injunctive relief they were likely to suffer \nirreparable harm because they could be subject to “sexual and \nother violence and face the possibility of torture and death.” \nR. & R., ECF No. 65 at 39; see also Lisa Frydman Decl., ECF No. \n15-12 ¶ 6. (averring that returned children are “frequently \ntrafficked from rural to urban areas and across borders or to \nborder areas, where they are often sexually exploited or subject \nto exploitative labor.”). Furthermore, Magistrate Judge Harvey \nrecognized that “the burden of removal alone cannot constitute \nthe requisite irreparable injury.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 40 \n(quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). Magistrate \n40 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 41 of 50\nJudge Harvey appropriately distinguished the facts upon which \nthat holding rested from this situation because here, “the \nputative class members are being returned without any \nopportunity to apply for asylum or withholding of removal. Once \nexpelled from the United States and outside the jurisdiction of \nthe Court, it is not clear that a remedy can be provided.” R. & \nR., ECF No. 65 at 40. The Government’s objections do not address \nMagistrate Judge Harvey’s reasoning on this point. See \ngenerally, Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69; Reply, ECF No. 75. \nFor the reasons above, the Court ADOPTS Magistrate Judge \nHarvey’s finding that Plaintiff adequately established a \nlikelihood of irreparable injury should a preliminary injunction \nnot issue. \n3. Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \nPlaintiff contends that “[p]reventing [the Government] from \nremoving unaccompanied children until final disposition of this \ncase would not substantially injure the government” because: (1) \n“unaccompanied children referred to ORR care are typically \nreleased to sponsors under the TVPRA, which in most cases will \nbe a parent or close relative who can ensure the child will \nself-quarantine,” Pl.’s Prelim. Inj. Mem., ECF No. 15-1 at 41; \n(2) the CDC Orders do “not make DHS officers safer, and in fact, \nlikely increases any potential exposure” because expelling \nunaccompanied children takes longer than transferring them to \n41 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 42 of 50\nthe ORR, id. at 42; and (3) “public health officials have \noverwhelmingly noted there are numerous safety measures that can \nbe taken to avoid the spread of COVID-19, including \nquarantines,” id. \n Magistrate Judge Harvey found that the [p]ublic interest \nin enjoining unlawful government action, protecting non-citizen \nchildren from being wrongfully removed, and preventing risks to \n“public health caused by the [CDC Orders] weighed in Plaintiff’s \nfavor,” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 41-42; and while “a preliminary \ninjunction will impose some hardships on [the Government], the \npublic interest and immitigable hardships to Plaintiff outweigh \nthe mitigable hardships to [the Government],” id. at 42. \nThe Government objects on two grounds. First, that \nMagistrate Judge Harvey erred in his evaluation of the public \ninterest because the children would be held in “congregate \nsettings in border settings ill-equipped” to deal with the \npublic health issues posed by the pandemic, resulting in an \nincreased risk of COVD-19 transmission and infection among the \nchildren, others being held, DHS personnel, and the United \nStates population at large.8 Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 33. \n                     \n8 The Government makes similar objections by arguing that \nMagistrate Judge Harvey “erred in disregarding the ways in which \nthe CDC Order and its enforcement” protect persons other than \nDHS personnel at the border; specifically “aliens, DHS personnel \nand the American public, as well as the vital healthcare \nresources of this Nation,” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 34; and \n42 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 43 of 50\nHowever, Magistrate Judge Harvey did consider but ultimately \nrejected the Government’s position, noting that the Government’s \n“argument is suspect given that the alternative to quarantine \nthat they propose—expulsion pursuant to the [CDC Order]—results \nin unaccompanied minors often being detained longer while \nawaiting expulsion than they would otherwise be, and the \nconcomitant lengthened exposure of class members to other non-\ncitizens, Customs and Border Patrol officers, and local medical \npersonnel.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 45.  \nSecond, the Government objects on the grounds that \nMagistrate Judge Harvey failed to consider Deputy Director \nJallyn Sualog’s declaration as to why the use of hotels are \njustified—specifically that the children can be placed in \nindividual rooms with doors that close and private facilities \nfor sleeping, eating and bathing. Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at \n34. Although Magistrate Judge Harvey did not specifically \nreference Ms. Sualog’s declaration on this specific point, he \nrejected the justification she provided, relying on persuasive \nauthority for the proposition that the Government “had failed to \n                     \nthat he “failed to consider the CDC Director’s conclusion that \nconditional release is not a viable option here due to \nsignificant uncertainty that covered aliens could effectively \nself-quarantine, self-isolate, or otherwise comply with social \ndistancing guidelines, particularly in light of the CDC’s \ninability to effectively monitor such a large number of people \nso released,” id. at 34-35. \n \n43 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 44 of 50\ndemonstrate how hotels, which are otherwise open to the public \nand have unlicensed staff coming in and out, located in areas \nwith high incidence of CIVD-19, are any better for protecting \npublic health than licensed facilities would be” and that \n“[e]ven if the infection control protocols at [the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement] come under stress, or are forced to make \nsome adjustments,” the program’s facilities are likely to \n“remain far safer than unregulated hotel stays for both detained \nminors and the general public.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 44 \n(quoting In Chambers Order at 4, Flores v. Barr, CV 85-4544 \n(DMG) (AGRx) (C.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2020), ECF No. 990 (“In \nChambers Flores Order”) (quoting Flores, 2020 WL 5491445, at \n*6). \nNext, the Government argues that Magistrate Judge Harvey’s \n“conclusion regarding the public health implications of \ntransferring putative class members to the [ORR] is . . . \nfraught with errors” for three reasons. Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. \n69 at 35. First, the Government argues that he erred by focusing \non the number of available beds rather than the rationale \narticulated by Deputy Director Sualog—specifically that “the \nincreased rate of referrals to ORR of minors with higher rates \nof exposure would create operational difficulties and make it \nmore difficult to implement sufficient containment protocols.” \nGov’t’s Objs., ECF No 69 at 35. Second, he “failed to take into \n44 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 45 of 50\naccount the judgment of Deputy Director Sualog that ORR had \nalready reached the threshold that puts ORR in significant \nstress.” Id. Third, he was wrong to give weight to the rationale \narticulated in Flores—specifically that Deputy Director Sualog’s \ndeclaration lacked support from a “public health official” \nbecause she attested that the COVD-19 infection control measures \nwere developed in consultation with the CDC. Id. at 36. Along \nthese lines, the Government contends that it was error for \nMagistrate Judge Harvey to give no weight to Deputy Director \nSualog’s opinion given that she oversees the operations of the \nagency. Id.  \nThe Court is not persuaded by the Government’s objections. \nMagistrate Judge Harvey directly addressed Deputy Director \nSualog’s rationale, but rejected it on the same grounds as did \nthe court in Flores—specifically noting that “there are \nsufficient numbers of currently under-utilized [ORR] facilities \nsuch that transfers can be allocated among facilities to avoid \nover-concentration or bottlenecking,” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 46 \n(citing In Chambers Order at 4, Flores, No. CV 85-4544 DMG, ECF \nNo. 990, (AGRx) (C.D. Cal Sept. 21, 2020)). Magistrate Judge \nHarvey also correctly pointed out that there was good reason to \nnot credit Deputy Director Sualog’s assertions because they were \n“highly speculative” and not supported by “scientific or \nempirical analysis.” R. & R., ECF No. 65at 46 (quoting In \n45 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 46 of 50\nChambers Flores Order at 3). The Court also finds it persuasive \nthat following the issuance of Magistrate Judge Harvey’s R. & \nR., the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nagreed with the court’s relevant determination in Flores: \n[T]he government has not established that the \nadditional referrals would actually overwhelm \nthe  ORR  system.  The  same  ORR  official \ndetermined in March 2020, when the system was \noperating at 30 percent capacity overall, that \nthe population of minors was sufficiently low \nto  allow  ORR  to  implement  COVID-19  safety \nprotocols effectively. She now urges us not to \nrely on that determination and points out that \nthe  population  was  “practically  static”  at \nthat time, so the system's intake capacity was \nnot  burdened.  Since  March,  however,  the \npopulation of minors in ORR care has dropped \ntenfold; as of August 24, 2020, the system was \noperating at 3 percent capacity, with 10,000 \nvacant  beds.  See  Sept.  4  Order,  2020  WL \n5491445,  at  *8.  The  government  has  not \nsatisfactorily  explained  why  ORR's  largely \nempty shelters are not capable of absorbing \neven as many as 140 additional minors a week \nfor short-term stays before those minors are \nexpelled  under  Title  42.  Nor  has  the \ngovernment offered testimony from any public \nhealth official explaining why holding minors \nin  hotels,  which  are  open  to  the  public, \npresents less risk of COVID-19 exposure and \nspread, both to the minors and to the public, \nthan holding them in licensed facilities. \n \nFlores v. Barr, No. 20-55951, 2020 WL 5883905, *5-*6 (9th Cir. \nOct. 4, 2020).  \nThe Government concludes that Magistrate Judge Harvey \n“erroneously minimized the public health exigency posed by the \npandemic, which requires the Government to utilize its broad \n46 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 47 of 50\npowers under Section 265 to effectively address the public \nhealth dangers to aliens, DHS personnel and the American public” \nnoting that the Court should not “substitute its judgment for \nthat of Government officials tasked with ensuring the public \nhealth and safety of our Nation.” Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at \n36-37. Magistrate Judge Harvey recognized that “a preliminary \ninjunction will impose hardships on the government and may force \nit . . . to make difficult decisions about allocation of \nresources to mitigate the risks caused by COVID-19.” R. & R., \nECF No. 65 at 46. Rather than this being a situation where the \nCourt is substituting its judgment for that of government \nofficials; however, here the government officials are not acting \nwithin the bounds set by Congress. Accordingly, the Court finds \nthat Magistrate Judge Harvey correctly weighed the public \ninterest in favor of “the general importance of [the CDC and \nDHS’s] faithful adherence to its statutory mandate,” which does \nnot permit expulsion. Jacksonville Port Auth. v. Adams, 556 F.2d \n52, 59 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  \nFor the reasons above, the Court therefore ADOPTS \nMagistrate Judge Harvey’s finding that Plaintiff adequately \nestablished that the public interest and immitigable hardships \nto Plaintiff outweigh the mitigable hardships to the Government. \nHaving found no clear error in this portion of the R. & R., \nthe Court therefore ADOPTS Magistrate Judge Harvey’s \n47 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 48 of 50\nrecommendation, and GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary \ninjunction. Mot., ECF No. 15.  \n4. The Injunction Applies to the Final Rule \nMagistrate Judge Harvey recommends that “the preliminary \ninjunction . . . be crafted to . . . prohibit[] expulsion from \nthe United States under the Title 42 process whether that \nconduct has been permitted in orders issued by the CDC Director \npursuant to the authority of the Interim Final Rule or the Final \nRule” because “there is no relevant material difference between \nthe CDC Director’s authority under the Final Rule and the \nauthority that the government here has argued he enjoys under \nthe Interim Final Rule.” R. & R., ECF No. 65 at 47-48. The \nGovernment objects to this relief but has not identified any \nmeaningful way in which the Final Rule differs from the Interim \nFinal Rule. See Gov’t’s Objs., ECF No. 69 at 37. Accordingly, \nthe Court will enjoin expulsion from the United States under \nTitle 42 for CDC Orders issued pursuant to the Interim Final \nRule or the Final Rule. See Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. \nContractors of Am. V. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 662 \n(1993).  \n5. The Court Will Not Require Plaintiff to Post a Bond \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) provides that “[t]he \ncourt may issue a preliminary injunction . . . only if the \nmovant gives security in an amount that the court considers \n48 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 49 of 50\nproper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found \nto have been wrongly enjoined.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). “Courts \nin this Circuit have found the Rule ‘vest[s] broad discretion in \nthe district court to determine the appropriate amount of an \ninjunction bond,’ including the discretion to require no bond at \nall.” Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 107 \n(D.D.C. 2012) (Sullivan, J.) (quoting DSE, Inc. v. United \nStates, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (internal citation \nomitted). Here, Plaintiff is a child allegedly fleeing \nprosecution in his home country and does not have the ability to \npost a bond. Additionally, he is seeking to vindicate important \nrights under the immigration laws. Accordingly, the Court will \nwaive the requirement for an injunction bond. See id. \nIV.  Conclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons the court ADOPTS the Report and \nRecommendation, ECF No. 65 and PROVISIONALLY GRANTS Plaintiff’s \nMotion to Certify Class, ECF No. 2, and GRANTS Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 15. The Government’s \nrequest to stay the Court’s Order while it decides whether to \nappeal and/or pending appeal is DENIED for substantially the \nsame reasons as those articulated in this Opinion. An \nappropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.  \n   \n49 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 80   Filed 11/18/20   Page 50 of 50\nSO ORDERED.  \nSigned:  Emmet G.

      "text": "Case 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 148   Filed 01/06/23   Page 1 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n \n   \nP.J.E.S., A MINOR CHILD, by and through \n      \nhis father and NEXT FRIEND, Mario Escobar \nFrancisco, on behalf of himself and others \n \nsimilarly situated,  \n \nPlaintiff, \nNo. 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH \nv.   \n \nALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, Secretary of \nHomeland Security, et al.,  \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nMOTION TO HOLD MOTION TO DISMISS IN ABEYANCE \n  Plaintiff hereby moves to hold the pending motion to dismiss, ECF No. 147, in abeyance \npending resolution of appellate proceedings in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas.  Defendants oppose \nthis motion. \n1.  The government’s motion to dismiss this challenge to the Title 42 policy as \napplied to unaccompanied children relies heavily on this Court’s vacatur of that policy in the \nparallel Huisha-Huisha litigation.  However, the Supreme Court has, since the filing of the \ngovernment’s motion, stayed the Huisha-Huisha order and granted certiorari to decide an \nintervention question in that case.  As explained below, holding the motion to dismiss in this case \nin abeyance pending Huisha-Huisha will avoid briefing and deciding mootness questions based \non hypothetical scenarios, and best conserves the resources of the parties and the Court. \n2.  On November 18, 2020, this Court entered a preliminary injunction in this case, \nenjoining the expulsion of unaccompanied noncitizen children class members pursuant to the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) Title 42 policy.  See Order, ECF Nos. 79, \n80.  That order was stayed pending appeal.  Order, P.J.E.S. v. Mayorkas, et al., No. 20-5357 \n(D.C. Cir. Jan. 29, 2021).   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 148   Filed 01/06/23   Page 2 of 5\n3.  On February 11, 2021, CDC issued a notice temporarily excepting \nunaccompanied noncitizen children from the Title 42 policy.  See CDC, Notice of Temporary \nException From Expulsion of Unaccompanied Noncitizen Children Encountered in the United \nStates Pending Forthcoming Public Health Determination (Feb. 11, 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/\ncoronavirus/2019-ncov/more/pdf/CDCPauseNotice-ExceptfromExpulsion.pdf.  On July 16, \n2021, the CDC issued a superseding order excepting unaccompanied children from the Title 42 \nProcess.  86 Fed. Reg. 38717, 38720 (July 22, 2021).  And on August 2, 2021, CDC issued \nanother order which incorporated the July 16 exception for unaccompanied children.  86 Fed. \nReg. 42828, 42829 n.5 (Aug. 5, 2021).  This litigation, in this court and the court of appeals, was \nheld in abeyance. \n4.  The State of Texas challenged the July and August orders, seeking to reinstitute \nexpulsions of unaccompanied children.  Texas v. Biden, No. 21-cv-579 (N.D. Tex.).  On March \n4, 2022, the Texas court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcing those orders to except \nunaccompanied children from expulsion.  Texas v. Biden, 589 F. Supp. 3d 595, 623-24 (N.D. \nTex. 2022). \n5.  On March 11, 2022, CDC terminated all prior suspension orders to the extent they \napplied to unaccompanied children.  87 Fed. Reg. 15243 (Mar. 17, 2022).  Texas sought to \namend its complaint to challenge this latest order, but the court denied leave to amend, and the \nparties stipulated to dismiss the suit without prejudice.  Texas, No. 21-cv-579 (N.D. Tex.), ECF \nNos. 106, 111, 115. \n6.  On April 1, 2022, CDC issued an order seeking to terminate all prior suspension \norders under 42 U.S.C. 265, not just those that applied to unaccompanied minors.  87 Fed. Reg. \n19941 (Apr. 6, 2022).  The CDC’s termination order was preliminarily enjoined on May 20, \n2022, on the ground that the termination order required notice and comment rulemaking.  \nLouisiana v. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, No. 22-cv-885, 2022 WL 1604901 \n(W.D. La. May 20, 2022).  The appeal of that decision is pending, and argument is tentatively \nscheduled for the week of March 6, 2023.  See No. 22-30303 (5th Cir.). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 148   Filed 01/06/23   Page 3 of 5\n7.  On August 30, 2022, the government moved in the D.C. Circuit to vacate this \nCourt’s preliminary injunction in P.J.E.S. and remand the case to this Court for a determination \nwhether the case is moot.  The D.C. Circuit remanded for a determination of mootness and to \nconsider the vacatur request.  Order, P.J.E.S., No. 20-cv-5357 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 17, 2022).  On \nOctober 28, 2022, the parties filed a status report proposing a briefing schedule regarding \nmootness, and this Court entered the schedule.  ECF Nos. 145-46.   \n8.  On November 15, 2022, this Court granted summary judgment in parallel \nlitigation regarding the Title 42 process.  Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, No. 21-100, 2022 WL \n16948610 (D.D.C. Nov. 15, 2022).  The court vacated and set aside “the Title 42 policy—\nconsisting of the regulation at 42 C.F.R. § 71.40 and all orders and decision memos issued by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention or the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices suspending the right to introduce certain persons into the United States.”  Id. at *16.  \nThe federal government has appealed.  No. 22-05325 (D.C. Cir.). \n9.  On November 22, 2022, Defendants in this case filed their motion to dismiss on \nmootness grounds.  ECF No. 147-1.  Defendants relied heavily on the Huisha-Huisha vacatur \norder in their mootness arguments.  See id. at 8 (“in Huisha-Huisha, this Court has already \ndeclared the ‘Title 42 Policy’ unlawful and has vacated and set [it] aside”); id. at 10 (similar); id. \nat 13 (similar).  In particular, Defendants noted that while this Court had granted a temporary \nstay of its vacatur judgment in Huisha-Huisha, “[o]nce the five-week stay expires and the \nHuisha-Huisha order becomes effective at midnight on December 21, 2022, the regulation at 42 \nC.F.R. § 71.40 and all CDC orders issued thereunder will be vacated, and DHS will begin \nprocessing all noncitizens entering the United States pursuant to Title 8.”  Id. at 7. \n10.  However, that did not occur.  A group of States moved to intervene in Huisha-\nHuisha and ultimately sought relief from the Supreme Court.  On December 27, the Supreme \nCourt granted the States’ request for a stay and granted certiorari to consider whether the States \nmay intervene.  Arizona v. Mayorkas, No. 22-592, 2022 WL 17957850 (U.S. Dec. 27, 2022).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 148   Filed 01/06/23   Page 4 of 5\nThe Court directed expedited briefing and scheduled argument for March 1, 2023.  Order, \nArizona, No. 22-592 (U.S. Jan. 4, 2023). \n11.  Plaintiff’s response to the government's motion to dismiss on mootness grounds in \nthis case is presently due January 9, 2022. \n12.  An abeyance of the pending motion is appropriate under the circumstances.  The \nsituation with regard to the Title 42 policy is currently in flux.  Among other potential changes in \nthe coming months, the Supreme Court’s consideration of the Huisha-Huisha litigation, as well \nas the pending appeal in that case in the D.C. Circuit, bear directly on one of the circumstances \non which Defendants’ motion relies: this Court’s vacatur order in Huisha-Huisha.  If the Huisha-\nHuisha vacatur order is affirmed, Plaintiff expects to stipulate to dismissal of the instant case.  \nRather than brief mootness based on hypothetical scenarios, it would conserve the resources of \nthe parties and the Court to hold this motion in abeyance pending the outcome of appellate \nproceedings in Huisha-Huisha. \n13.  Counsel for Defendants has indicated that they oppose Plaintiff’s request in this \ncase to hold the motion to dismiss in abeyance.  However, Defendants have informed Plaintiff \nthat they do not oppose a 21-day extension of the current briefing schedule should the Court \nchoose not to hold the government’s mootness motion in abeyance.  Under such a schedule, \nPlaintiff’s brief would be due January 30, 2022, and Defendants’ reply would be due February \n13, 2022. \n14.  In sum, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court hold in abeyance the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss pending appellate proceedings in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas.  \nIn the alternative, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant an extension of 21 days, \nuntil January 30, to respond to the motion to dismiss. \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 148   Filed 01/06/23   Page 5 of 5\nDated: January 6, 2023              Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Lee Gelernt_____________________ \nStephen B.

Congress’s system \nrequires the executive branch to follow specific procedures to identify and evaluate humanitarian \nprotection claims whenever it seeks to expel, turn away, or otherwise remove someone from the \nUnited States.  And it bars the executive branch from discounting the rights of people at or within \nour borders who seek humanitarian protection (or “asylum seekers”) when providing for the public \nhealth.  Yet even as acts of persecution and torture continue to be documented in the Northern \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 9 of 21\nTriangle, Mexico, and many other places worldwide,1 our government has returned over one \nhundred thousand  people to Mexico or their countries of origin without respecting the safeguards \nCongress created.2   \nDefendants purport to have authority under the Public Health Service Act to expel asylum \nseekers like Plaintiff and the proposed class members—children who have fled their home \ncountries and entered the United States alone—without these safeguards.  Plaintiff and the \nproposed class members are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that Defendants’ \nexpulsion policy is in fact unlawful because, among other things, the U.S. humanitarian protection \nsystem that Defendants ignore is comprehensive, and its procedures are mandatory.3  IRAP agrees \nwith Plaintiff that the Court should grant his motion for classwide preliminary injunction for all \n \n1 See, e.g., UN News, Coronavirus lockdowns in Central America, exploited by criminal gangs, \nMay 15, 2020, https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/05/1064172; Sofia Menchu, Families in rural \nGuatemala  flee  after  armed  groups  sets  homes  on  fire,  Reuters,  Aug.  16,  2020, \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-guatemala-indigenous/families-in-rural-guatemala-flee-after-\narmed-group-sets-homes-on-fire-idUSKCN25C0TN; Publicly reported cases of violent attacks on \nindividuals returned to Mexico under the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” as compiled by Human \nRights First, Human Rights First, May 13, 2020, https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/\nfiles/PubliclyReportedMPPAttacks5.13.2020.pdf;    Poland:  Crackdown  On  LGBT  Activists, \nHuman Rights Watch, Aug. 7, 2020, https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/07/poland-crackdown-\nlgbt-activists; Jen Kirby, Concentration camps and forced labor: China’s repression of the \nUighurs,  explained,  Vox,  July  28,  2020,  https://www.vox.com/2020/7/28/21333345/uighurs-\nchina-internment-camps-forced-labor-xinjiang;    Brendan  Cole,  Jehovah’s  Witness  in  Russia \nConvicted  of  Extremism,  Concern  Over  Crackdown,  Newsweek,  July  28,  2020, \nhttps://www.newsweek.com/jehovahs-witnesses-russia-persecution-1521023. \n2  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection,  “Nationwide  Enforcement  Encounters:    Title  8 \nEnforcement  Actions  and  Title  42  Expulsions,”  https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-\nenforcement-statistics/title-8-and-title-42-statistics (last visited Aug. 31, 2020). \n3 In J.B.B.C. v. Wolf, Judge Nichols held in an oral ruling that the plaintiff—an unaccompanied \nminor similar to the Plaintiff and the proposed class members here—had demonstrated likelihood \nof success on the merits of his claim that 42 U.S.C. § 265 does not grant the director of the CDC  \nthe expulsion power the director asserts because, among other things, the statute does not override \nimmigration laws.  See Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-2, Ex. D, at 49-51 (“[I]n the Court’s view, [section \n265] should be harmonized, to the maximum extent possible, with immigration statutes, including \nthose already referenced that grant special protections to minors and also those immigration \nstatutes that deal with communicable diseases and quarantines.”). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 10 of 21\nthe reasons set out in Plaintiff’s brief.  It submits this brief to further detail how the expulsion \npolicy is contrary to the laws Congress enacted to protect asylum seekers, even setting aside the \nspecial and critical protections to which Plaintiff is entitled under the Homeland Security Act and \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.  IRAP urges the Court to grant Plaintiff’s \nmotion for classwide preliminary injunction. \nARGUMENT \nI.  DEFENDANTS’ EXPULSION POLICY CONTRAVENES THE TEXT OF \nTHE REFUGEE ACT AND RELATED HUMANITARIAN PROTECTION \nLAWS  \nUnder U.S. law, the federal government is prohibited from returning people to places where \nthey will be persecuted or tortured and is required to give people who reach our borders an \nopportunity to seek asylum.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16, 208.17; 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(1).  To ensure that the Executive does not run afoul of these mandates, Congress requires \nit to follow specific procedures to identify and adjudicate humanitarian protection claims whenever \nit seeks to remove a person from the United States.  This system is comprehensive, and there is no \nlegal basis for the Executive to circumvent it on public health grounds. \nA.  Congress requires the Executive to follow specific procedures to identify and \nevaluate humanitarian protection claims \nCongress requires the Executive to follow specific procedures to protect the rights of \nasylum seekers at or within U.S. borders.  As Plaintiff explains, unaccompanied children like him \nand the proposed class members are entitled to special protections under the Homeland Security \nAct and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.  See Pl.’s Br. at 3-4.  Even in the \nordinary course, however, the protections to which asylum seekers are entitled are robust.  See id. \nat 4-6.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 11 of 21\nOrdinarily, when the government seeks to remove a person from the United States, it must \nprovide a removal hearing with many procedural safeguards—including access to counsel (at no \ngovernment  expense)  and  opportunities  to  present  evidence  and  cross-examine  government \nwitnesses—to afford that person, among other things, a fair opportunity to present claims for \nhumanitarian protection.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.  To demonstrate that the government must protect \nthem  from  persecution,  a  person  may  apply  for  withholding  of  removal  under  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3), which, with limited exceptions,  bars the government from removing someone to a \nplace where their “life or freedom would be threatened . . . because of [their] race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”  To demonstrate that \nthe government must protect them from torture, the person may apply for deferral or withholding \nof  removal  under  law  implementing  the  U.N.  Convention  Against  Torture,  which  bars  the \ngovernment from removing anyone to any place where it is “more likely than not” that he or she \nwould be tortured.  8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c), 1208.17(a).  In removal proceedings, a person may \nalso apply for asylum status, which confers additional rights beyond protection from removal.  A \nperson is generally eligible for asylum if they are a “refugee”—that is, they cannot return to their \nhome country “because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, \nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42).   Asylum  status,  unlike withholding or deferral  of \nremoval, provides a pathway to lawful permanent resident status, see 8 U.S.C. § 1159(b), and, \nultimately, U.S. citizenship, see 8 U.S.C. § 1427(a).  A person who does not prevail in the \nadministrative removal hearing has the right to an appeal, see 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5), and \nultimately has access to federal judicial review, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 12 of 21\nCongress has also created an expedited removal process to permit quick removals of certain \nnarrowly delineated classes of recent arrivals.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) (applying to people \narriving in the United States who are determined to lack valid entry documents or to be seeking \nadmission through material misrepresentation, subject to limited expansion by the Attorney \nGeneral); 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D) (exempting certain unaccompanied children).  Yet even as to \nthose people who are subject to expedited removal, Congress took care to ensure that any who \nmight be eligible for asylum or entitled to withholding or deferral of removal would not be \nremoved  unlawfully:    In  the  expedited  removal  system,  a  person  who  expresses  a  fear  of \npersecution or torture is referred for a “credible fear” screening, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A), \n(b)(1)(B)(ii), where they are given an opportunity to consult with a person of their choosing, see 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv); to be interviewed by an asylum officer with specialized training and \nunder proper supervision, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B), (E); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d); and, so long as \ntheir fear is deemed credible, to be placed in full removal proceedings, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f).  \nThis initial screening process sets a low evidentiary threshold so that anyone who might possibly \nhave a claim for humanitarian protection can present it in full removal proceedings with proper \nprocedural protections. \nB.  Congress  has  prohibited  the  Executive  from  blocking  access  to  the \nhumanitarian protection system on health-related grounds \nCongress further requires the Executive to make public health decisions in a manner that \nrespects the rights of people seeking humanitarian protection.  Defendants suggest that guarding \nthe public health requires them to overlook the specific rights of asylum seekers.  See, e.g., supra \nn.2;  Amendment and Extension of Order Suspending  Introduction of Certain  Persons from \nCountries Where a Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. 31,503, 31,508 (May 26, 2020).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 13 of 21\nBut Congress was clear that potential health concerns are not grounds for preventing asylum \nseekers from accessing humanitarian protection. \nFirst, Congress drafted the humanitarian protection laws such that a person’s health would \nbe irrelevant to whether they could be granted asylum status, withholding of removal, or protection \nunder the Convention Against Torture.  Under the Convention Against Torture, the government is \nprohibited from returning a person to their torturers without exception.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.17(a).  \nWith respect to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), a person facing persecution \nis ineligible for protection only if they have persecuted others; participated in Nazi persecution, \ngenocide, or the commission of any act of torture or extrajudicial killing; or pose a serious threat \nto the security of the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B).  A person is barred from asylum \nonly for the narrow set of reasons set out in 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), (b)(2), which overlap in part \nwith the exceptions for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) and similarly have \nnothing to do with health.  See also Pl.’s Br. at 4-6 & nn.3-4.4 \nSecond, even though Congress created a mechanism in the immigration laws for the \ngovernment to remove a person from the country on health-related grounds, it specifically declined \nto make such health-related grounds barriers to applying for and being granted humanitarian \nprotection from removal.  Ordinarily, a person who seeks to enter the country or to be granted \ncertain immigration statuses must be “admissible.”  This means that they must not fall within any \nof the grounds of exclusion specified in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a), such as lacking valid entry documents, \n \n4 The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice recently issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking that purports to construe the national security bar to asylum and withholding \nof  removal  to  allow  agencies  to  consider  “emergency  public  health  concerns  based  on \ncommunicable disease due to potential international threats from the spread of pandemics.”  \nSecurity Bars and Processing, 85 Fed. Reg. 41,201 (July 9, 2020).  The proposed rule is not in \neffect, nor is it at issue in this case.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 14 of 21\n8  U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i),  having  crossed  the  border  without  inspection,  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), or having been convicted of certain crimes, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A), (B).  A \nperson may also be inadmissible on “health-related grounds,” including being “determined . . . to \nhave  a  communicable  disease  of  public  health  significance,”  8  U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(1)(A)(i); \naccording to the government, COVID-19 is one such disease.5  Yet Congress was clear that a \nperson may apply for and be granted humanitarian relief regardless of whether there might be \ngrounds, including a health-related inadmissibility ground, to remove them:  A person may apply \nfor and be granted asylum “irrespective” of whether they are admissible.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).   \nAs the government itself has acknowledged:  an individual seeking asylum is simply “not subject \nto inadmissibility grounds at the time of [an] asylum grant.”  USCIS Policy Manual Vol. 7, Part \nM, Ch. 3 (2020), available at https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-m-chapter-3; \nsee  also  USCIS  Policy  Manual  Vol.  8,  Part  B,  Ch.  3  (2020),  available  at \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-3  (no  specific  medical \nexamination or vaccination required for granting asylum).  Withholding and deferral of removal, \nfor their part, by definition are available when a person could otherwise be removed.   \nThird, though it rejected the notion that asylum seekers might be barred from humanitarian \nprotection on health-related grounds, Congress accounted for the public health by permitting the \nExecutive to screen asylum seekers on arrival.  Asylum seekers may be screened under the federal \nlaws relating to quarantine, isolation, and contact-tracing that apply to citizens and noncitizens \nalike.  See 42 C.F.R. §§ 71.1, 71.20, 71.36.  And under the immigration laws, asylum seekers, like \nother noncitizens, may be screened for inadmissibility grounds, including “communicable diseases \n \n5 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Immigration Court Practices \nDuring the Declared National Emergency Concerning the COVID-19 Outbreak, PM 20-10, at 1 \nn.1 (Mar. 18, 2020), available at https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/1259226/download. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 15 of 21\nof public health significance,” according to procedures specified by Congress and the Department \nof Health and Human Services.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(i).  These procedures permit the \ngovernment to conduct medical exams and to detain for medical screening certain individuals \narriving at ports of entry or from places “where any [relevant] diseases are prevalent or epidemic.”  \nSee, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1222; 42 C.F.R. § 34.3 (describing the scope of medical exams).  And they \nspecify that when a medical examiner cannot make a diagnosis, the government must postpone the \nmedical examination until a diagnosis can be made and, in the meantime, refer the noncitizen for \nany medical care that might be necessary.  See 8 C.F.R. § 34.5.  The medical screening and its \nresult may lead the government to charge an asylum seeker with a health-related inadmissibility \nground in removal proceedings and, ultimately, to remove them—but only if they are not granted \nasylum or withholding or deferral of removal.  Whatever the result of the screening, what the \ngovernment may not do is bypass credible fear interviews or removal proceedings, deprive asylum \nseekers of the opportunity to apply for humanitarian protection from removal, or prevent asylum \nseekers from being granted such protection on health grounds. \nIn  adopting  the  challenged  policy,  the  Executive  has  upended  Congress’s  carefully \ndelineated system.  Congress has accounted for the public health and taken care to ensure that \nhealth considerations will not prevent a person from applying for or being granted protection. \nII.  DEFENDANTS’ EXPULSION POLICY CONTRAVENES CONGRESS’S \nINTENT \nThat Congress did not give the Executive discretion to expel asylum seekers as Defendants \nare doing is also evident from the legislative history of the Refugee Act, the laws implementing \nthe U.N. Convention Against Torture, and procedural reforms enacted in 1996.  This legislative \nhistory shows that Congress recognized an urgent, morally grounded need for strong protections \nfor asylum seekers.  And it shows that Congress anticipated that the executive branch might \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 16 of 21\nattempt to circumvent its laws and specifically aimed to prevent the executive branch from doing \nso. \nA.  Congress understood our obligations to asylum seekers in stark moral terms \nCongress was mindful of the dangers of returning people to their abusers and understood \nour obligation to protect asylum seekers in stark moral terms.  The laws Congress enacted \noriginated in the non-refoulement provision of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of \nRefugees, which had urgent moral underpinnings.6  As Louis Henkin, an American framer of the \ntreaty, explained:  In the years following the Second World War, “there had been stories, and some \nevidence, that police of some countries had pushed refugees back into the hands of the pursuing \nNazis.”  “[G]overnments,” therefore, “were asked to commit themselves not to prevent a person \nfrom escaping oppression and not to become an accomplice to their oppression.”  Henkin Aff. \n¶¶ 4, 6, Resp’ts’ Br., McNary v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 1992 WL 541267 (U.S. Dec. 21, \n1992).  Universal recognition of the non-refoulement principle was considered essential to an \neffective  refugee  protection  system.    See  The  Refugee  Convention,  1951:    The  Travaux \nPreparatoires  Analysed  with  a  Commentary  by  Dr  Paul  Weis  235,  available  at \nhttps://www.unhcr.org/en-us/protection/travaux/4ca34be29/refugee-convention-1951-travaux-\npreparatoires-analysed-commentary-dr-paul.html [hereinafter “Travaux”] (“The Chairman felt \nthat if the work of the Committee resulted in the ratification of [the non-refoulement provision] \nalone, it would have been worth while.”); see also Exec. Comm. of the High Commissioner’s \nProgramme, Note on International Protection ¶ 10, U.N. Doc. A/AC.96/815 (1993), available at \n \n6 Though the United States did not ultimately ratify the Convention, the Convention’s provisions \nwere carried through in relevant part to the U.N. Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which \nthe United States did ratify.  114 Cong. Rec. 29,391 (1968); 114 Cong. Rec. 29,607-08 (1968); see \nalso H.R. Rep. No. 96-608, at 17 (1979) (noting that the enactment of asylum and non-refoulement \nprovisions “conforms United States statutory law to our [Protocol] obligations”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 17 of 21\nhttps://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae68d5d10.html (“It would be patently impossible to provide \ninternational protection to refugees if States failed to respect this paramount principle of refugee \nlaw and human solidarity.”).  See generally I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 436-39 \n(1987) (treating negotiating history and UNHCR material as persuasive authority). \nBecause of the strong interests at stake, the framers of the Refugee Convention specifically \nrejected the notion that people seeking humanitarian protection might be expelled on health-related \ngrounds.  The U.S. delegate maintained that “refugees should not be expelled . . . because they had \nbeen sick or indigent,” and the treaty’s Committee Notes reflect consensus around this position:  \nthe treaty “would not,” the Committee explained, “permit the deportation of [refugees] on ‘social \ngrounds,’ such as indigence or illness.”  Travaux 222, 225.  When transmitting the U.N. Protocol \nRelating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees—which  incorporated  the  protections  of  the  Refugee \nConvention—to  President  Johnson  for  ratification,  Secretary  of  State  Rusk  echoed  these \nsentiments:  Since “refugees by definition are without a homeland, deportation of a refugee is a \nparticularly serious measure, and it would not be humanitarian to deport a refugee for reasons of \nhealth or economic dependence.” 114 Cong. Rec. 27,758-59 (1968). \nWhen Congress codified the protections of the Refugee Convention and Protocol in the \n1980 Refugee Act, Congress remained all too aware of the grave dangers asylum seekers would \nface were the United States to turn its back on them, and thus sought to conform statutory \nprotections to the non-refoulement mandate.  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 96-608, at 17 (1979) (noting \nthat the asylum and non-refoulement provisions are designed to “conform[] United States statutory \nlaw to our obligations under [the Convention and Protocol]”); Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. \n96-212, § 101(a), 94 Stat. 102, 102 (“declar[ing] that it is the historic policy of the United States \nto respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands”).  Senator \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 18 of 21\nKennedy pointed to the “tragic results” of the country’s lack, at the time, of a consistent asylum \npolicy, including “instances where people came up to our embassies[,] were rejected, and were \nlater shot.”  The Refugee Act of 1979, S. 643:  Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 96th \nCong. 36 (1979).  In the House debates, Representative Chisholm held up the “tragic plight” of \nthousands of Haitians who had sought asylum in Florida, citing evidence of “the arrest and indeed \nexecution of Haitians deported by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.”  125 Cong. Rec. \n11,973 (1979). \nWhen Congress enacted an expedited removal process in 1996, it remained attentive to the \nrisks of removal.  Even as it recognized some utility in permitting the Executive to remove certain \npeople more quickly, Congress deliberately made the central, credible fear standard for avoiding \nexpedited removal “a low screening standard for admission into the usual full asylum process,” \n142 Cong. Rec. 11,491 (1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch), to avoid the “danger that an alien with a \ngenuine asylum claim w[ould] be returned to persecution,” H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at 158 (1996).  \nSee also Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 107 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’d sub nom. Grace v. Barr, \n965 F. 3d 883, 902 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (acknowledging that Congress’s purpose to ensure that \n“individuals with  valid asylum claims are not  returned to  countries where they  could  face \npersecution” is evident in both the asylum system’s design and legislative history).   \nWhen implementing the non-refoulement provision from the U.N. Convention Against \nTorture, Congress similarly recognized the dangers many asylum seekers faced outside the United \nStates, announcing that it would be the policy of the United States “not to expel, extradite, or \notherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial \ngrounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”  Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242(a), 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 19 of 21\nAt the direction of Congress, the Department of Justice promulgated regulations making protection \nmandatory, with no exceptions.  See Regulations Concerning the Convention Against Torture, 64 \nFed. Reg. 8478, 8481 (Feb. 19, 1999).  This was in keeping with the aim of the framers of the \nConvention Against Torture, who desired “to afford the greatest possible protection against \ntorture.”  See Report of the Working Group on a Draft Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/L.1470, at ¶ 44 (Mar. \n12, 1979), available at http://hr-travaux.law.virginia.edu/document/catcidtp/ecn4l1470/nid-159. \nB.  Congress required the Executive to follow specific procedures so that the \nExecutive would not undercut the rights of asylum seekers \nIn  creating  the  modern  asylum  system  Congress  mandated  specific  procedures  for \nidentifying and evaluating protection claims, see supra Part I.A., to prevent the Executive from \nundercutting asylum seekers’ rights.  Under the previous system, claims for asylum domestically \nwere left completely to the discretion of the executive branch and did not require any particular \nprocedure.  See 8 C.F.R. § 108.1 (1979).  Congress considered this system to be unfair and \ninadequate, and too susceptible to the whims of political climate and world events.  See, e.g., H.R. \nRep. No. 96-608, at 1, 17-18 (1979) (seeking “to eliminate current discrimination on the basis of \noutmoded geographical and ideological considerations” and deeming domestic asylum provision \n“necessary and desirable” for a “fair and workable asylum policy which is consistent with this \ncountry’s tradition of welcoming the oppressed of other nations and with our obligations under \ninternational law”).  Representative Holtzman, a House sponsor of the Refugee Act, explained the \nproblem:  “One of the matters that has concerned me greatly about the admission of . . . persons \nwho seek asylum is the fact that there really are no specific procedures that would assure that due \nprocess is granted when such persons are questioned in order [to] determine[] whether or not they \nmeet the present statutory standards.”  Admission of Refugees into the United States, Hearings \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 20 of 21\nbefore the Subcomm. on Immigration, Citizenship, and Int’l Law, H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 95th \nCong. 126 (1977).  “[W]hen Congress creates a statutory scheme and does not really specify how \nthat scheme is to be implemented,” she continued, “it can be thwarted by the executive branch.”   \nId. at 127; see also id. (statement of John E. McCarthy, Chairman, Comm. on Migration and \nRefugee Affairs, Am. Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Serv.) (“You’re treading on very \ndangerous ground when you’re examining these people because if you’re wrong and the person is \nforced to return you have got a terrible problem. . . .  We don’t have the standards here which are \nso necessary.”); id. (pointing to politicized denials of protection to Chilean refugees). \nWith the 1980 Refugee Act, which was designed to be comprehensive, Congress sought to \nremedy this problem.  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 96-608, at 1 (1979) (“The purpose of the bill is to \nestablish a coherent and comprehensive U.S. refugee policy.  This objective is accomplished by \ncreating a systematic and flexible procedure for the admission and resettlement of refugees.”); S. \nRep. No. 96-256, at 1 (1979) (proposed bill would “establish[] for the first time a comprehensive \nUnited States refugee resettlement and assistance policy”).  It created a new, “specific statutory \nbasis for United States asylum policy,” and directed the Attorney General to establish uniform \nprocedures that would bind the executive branch.  H.R. Rep. No. 96-608, at 17-18 (1979); see also \n126 Cong. Rec. 4507 (1980) (statement of Rep. Holtzman) (the bill “mandates a procedure for the \nconsideration of asylum claims by people who are here on our shores”).  And it amended the terms \nof the then-existing statutory withholding of removal provision to use mandatory language, to \navoid any suggestion that whether to grant withholding might be within the Executive’s discretion.  \nSee H.R. Rep. No. 96-608, at 18 (1979).  When Congress created a threshold asylum screening \nprocess in 1996, it again set limits on the Executive by, among other things, taking care to specify \nthe training, supervision, and review to which the immigration officers conducting screenings \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 30-1   Filed 08/31/20   Page 21 of 21\nwould be required to be subjected.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III), (b)(1)(E); 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3); see also 142 Cong. Rec. 11,491 (1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (“I feel very \nstrongly that the appropriate, fully trained asylum officers conduct the screening in the summary \nexclusion process”).  And Congress similarly cabined the Executive’s discretion in implementing \nthe Convention Against Torture, making clear that its prohibitions applied notwithstanding any \nother government policy.  See Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. \n105-277, § 2242(a), 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822. \nIn short, understanding our humanitarian responsibilities to be urgent moral obligations, \nCongress acted deliberately to prevent them from being circumvented by the executive branch. \nDefendants’ expulsion policy contravenes Congress’s clear aim. \nCONCLUSION \nBecause Defendants are expelling people from our country without regard to Congress’s \ncarefully crafted system for identifying and protecting those who fear persecution and torture, \nIRAP urges the Court to grant Plaintiff’s motion for classwide preliminary injunction. \n \nDated:  August 31, 2020        Respectfully submitted, \nNew York, N.Y. \n/s/ Kathryn Austin     \nKathryn Austin (D.D.C.

This  case  challenges  the  government’s  unprecedented  new  system  for  restricting \nimmigration along the Canadian and Mexican borders in the name of public health and under the \npurported authority of 42 U.S.C. § 265.  This system is established in a set of agency documents—\na new regulation, several orders, and an implementation memo—which Plaintiff collectively refers \nto as the “Title 42 Process.” \n2.  Among  other  things,  the  Title  42  Process  authorizes  the  summary  expulsion  of \nunaccompanied minors without any procedural protections—even if the children show no signs of \nhaving COVID-19, and even if the children are fleeing danger and seeking protection in the United \nStates. \n3.  Plaintiff P.J.E.S. is a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala who came to the United States \nunaccompanied.  P.J.E.S. was forced to flee to the United States to escape severe persecution in \nGuatemala.    His  father  currently  lives  in  the  United  States  and  is  awaiting  immigration \nproceedings.  After P.J.E.S. came to the United States, CBP apprehended him and subjected him \nto the Title 42 Process.  He is currently in CBP custody in the McAllen, Texas, area \n4.  Prior to the Title 42 Process, and pursuant to longstanding immigration statutes protecting \nchildren and those seeking protection, Plaintiff should have been given shelter in a children’s \nfacility until he could be released to his father or another suitable sponsor in the United States, and \nis entitled to a full hearing, and appeals, to determine his right to remain in the United States with \nhis father.   \n5.  Through the Title 42 Process, the Administration has sought to usurp Congress’s role and \nbypass the entire immigration statutory scheme.  Specifically, the Administration contends that \npublic health provisions in Title 42 of the U.S. Code—provisions that have rarely been used and \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 4 of 31\nnever in this way—entitle it to set aside the immigration laws.   \n6.  But those public health provisions do not authorize this unprecedented Title 42 Process.  \nTitle 42 authorizes various powers, such as testing and quarantines, but has never been interpreted \nto authorize the broad powers the government is claiming here.  The statutes protecting children \nand those seeking protection were enacted after the Title 42 provisions and contain no exception \nfor individuals with communicable diseases.   \n7.  In fact, Congress has a long history of squarely addressing communicable diseases in the \nimmigration laws.  Under the specific immigration provisions enacted by Congress, if a border \nofficial suspects that an arriving noncitizen has a communicable disease deemed serious by the \ngovernment, the official has numerous options, including testing and even quarantine.  But \nunaccompanied children may under no circumstances be deported without a proper opportunity to \ndetermine their right to remain in the United States.  The Administration’s use of Title 42 is a \ntransparent end-run around Congress’s considered decision to provide protection to children and \nothers fleeing danger even where communicable disease is a concern—and to address that concern \nthrough testing and quarantines, not deportations. \n8.  Not only does the Title 42 Process violate the immigration statutes, but its application to \nunaccompanied children is patently arbitrary and capricious from a public health standpoint.   \n9.  The principal stated justifications for the Title 42 Process are that it is necessary to protect \nborder officers and that the introduction of persons into congregate settings poses a danger to \npublic health.  Specifically, the government asserts that when a person arrives at the border seeking \nprotection and lacks a visa, border agents from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \nwill be forced to spend additional time screening the individual under the immigration laws, \nthereby exposing the officers to great danger.  But as public health experts have uniformly \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 5 of 31\nexplained, numerous safety measures are available, including social distancing, face masks, and \ngloves.   \n10.  Moreover, under the regular operation of the immigration laws, unaccompanied children, \nlike the named Plaintiff here, are transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n(“ORR”), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), within 72 hours of the \nchild’s apprehension.   \n11.  Instead, under the Title 42 Process, unaccompanied minors are regularly being held at \nhotels for multiple days—and frequently for more than 72 hours—as Defendants arrange for \ntheir deportation.   \n12.  Whatever  the  Administration’s  motivation  for  applying  the  Title  42  Process  to \nunaccompanied children, the Process is unlawful.  Plaintiff would face grave danger in his home \ncountry and must be given the opportunity to remain to the United States to receive the statutory \nprotections to which he is entitled under the laws passed by Congress.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n13.  This case arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq.; \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. and its implementing \nregulations;  the  Convention  Against  Torture  (“CAT”),  see  Foreign  Affairs  Reform  and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. \n2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231); and the Public Health Service Act \nof 1944, 42 U.S.C § 201, et seq. \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), and the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.  See also 5 U.S.C. § 702 (waiver of sovereign \nimmunity). \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 6 of 31\n15.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants are agencies of the \nUnited States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacity, Defendants reside \nin this District, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred \nin this District.   \nPARTIES \nPlaintiff \n16.  Plaintiff P.J.E.S. is a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala.  He fled to seek protection in the \nUnited States.  After he came to the United States, CBP apprehended him and subjected him to the \nTitle 42 Process.  He sues by and through his father and Next Friend, Mario Escobar Francisco. \nDefendants \n17.  Defendant Chad Wolf is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, which is a cabinet-\nlevel department of the U.S. government.  He is sued in his official capacity.  In that capacity, \nDefendant Wolf is responsible for the administration of the immigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1103.  DHS’s components include CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(“ICE”). \n18.  Defendant Mark A. Morgan is the Acting Commissioner of CBP.  He is sued in his official \ncapacity.  In that capacity, he directed the issuance of the CBP’s memorandum implementing \nexpulsions under the Title 42 Process, and is a supervisory official responsible for implementing \nthe Title 42 Process.  CBP is the sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for the initial processing \nand detention of noncitizens who are apprehended at or between U.S. ports of entry.  CBP is \nresponsible for implementing the Title 42 Process and conducts expulsions pursuant to its terms.  \n19.  Defendant Todd C. Owen is the Executive Assistant Commissioner of CBP’s Office of \nField Operations (“OFO”).  He is sued in his official capacity.  OFO is the largest component of \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 7 of 31\nCBP and is responsible for border security, including immigration and travel through U.S. ports \nof entry.  Defendant Owen is a supervisory official responsible for implementing the Title 42 \nProcess at ports of entry. \n20.  Defendant Rodney S. Scott is the Chief of U.S. Border Patrol. He is sued in his official \ncapacity.  Border Patrol is responsible for border security between ports of entry.  Defendant Scott \nis a supervisory official responsible for implementing the Title 42 Process between ports of entry.  \n21.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence is the Deputy Director of ICE, and is the Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the Director.  ICE is the sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for \ncarrying out removal orders and overseeing immigration detention.  Defendant Albence is sued in \nhis official capacity. \n22.  Defendant Alex M. Azar II is the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), which \nis a cabinet-level department of the U.S. government.  He is sued in his official capacity.  In that \ncapacity, Defendant Azar is responsible for the oversight of both the Centers for Disease Control \n(“CDC”) and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), which are components of HHS.  \n23.  Defendant Dr. Robert R. Redfield, M.D., is the Director of the CDC.  He is sued in his \nofficial capacity.  In that capacity, he authorized the Title 42 Process at issue in this case. \n24.  Defendant Heidi Stirrup is the Acting Director of ORR.  She is sued in her official capacity.  \nORR is statutorily responsible for the care and custody of unaccompanied children in federal \nimmigration  custody.   The  agency  oversees a  network  of  shelters  and  facilities that  house \nunaccompanied children; evaluates potential sponsors for the children; and operates various \nprograms designed to ensure that unaccompanied children access certain procedural protections in \ntheir removal proceedings.  The agency is a component of HHS.  In that role, Defendant Stirrup \noversees the care and custody of unaccompanied children in immigration custody.  \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 8 of 31\nFACTS \nUnaccompanied Children in the Immigration System \n25.  Every day, unaccompanied children flee persecution and danger in their home countries \nand journey to the United States seeking safety.  Many of them come from El Salvador, Honduras, \nGuatemala, and Mexico because of the escalating influence of powerful gangs that control large \nswaths of these countries and frequently target children.  Many unaccompanied children from these \ncountries are also fleeing gender-based, family-based, and other types of violence. \n26.  In recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of unaccompanied children and their critical \nneed for protection, Congress has passed two laws to guarantee their proper care and facilitate their \nefforts to seek humanitarian relief.   \n27.  In 2002, Congress included provisions in the Homeland Security Act that transferred \nresponsibility for the care and custody of unaccompanied children from the former Immigration \nand Naturalization Service to ORR, which is part of HHS.  6 U.S.C. § 279(a).  Congress enacted \nthis provision because it saw that immigration enforcement-oriented agencies were ill-equipped to \ncare  for  unaccompanied  children.    Congress  therefore  vested  responsibility  for  the  care  of \nunaccompanied children, including the provision of housing and access to legal services to pursue \nclaims for immigration relief, in an agency—ORR—that had demonstrated experience working \nwith vulnerable immigrants and refugees.   \n28.  In  2008,  Congress  enacted  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act \n(“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, which established even stronger protections for unaccompanied \nchildren.  The TVPRA created a number of significant safeguards concerning the care, custody, \nand removal proceedings of unaccompanied children, and confirmed ORR’s responsibility to \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 9 of 31\nensure their care.1   \n29.  Under  the  TVPRA,  unaccompanied  children  from  “noncontiguous  countries”—i.e., \ncountries other than Canada and Mexico—must be transferred to ORR custody within 72 hours \nafter their apprehension, absent exceptional circumstances.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3).  Children from \nCanada and Mexico may be subject to an initial screening for trafficking fear of persecution, and \ndecision-making capacity before they are transferred to ORR.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), \n(a)(3).  \n30.  After referral from CBP, ORR is responsible under the statute for housing and caring for \nunaccompanied children.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c).  The statute requires ORR to “promptly” place the \nchild  “in  the  least  restrictive  setting  that  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  child.”    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(2)(A).  Such placements can include referral to shelters or care facilities operated by \nentities that contract with ORR.   \n31.  ORR does not operate its own housing facilities for unaccompanied children.  Instead, ORR \ncontracts with providers throughout the country who operate shelters, group homes, foster care \nprograms, and other living situations for the children.  The shelter providers take care of the \nchildren’s day-to-day needs, such as food, housing, education, and medical treatment.  The \nproviders operate under ORR’s direction and supervision, and must comply with federal standards \nand ORR guidelines governing the care of unaccompanied children.   \n32.  ORR is also statutorily required to evaluate options for the child’s release from federal \ncustody to a family member or other adult who can care for the child.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(3)(A).  \nOften, unaccompanied children traveling to the United States can reunite with parents or family \nmembers already here, which enables ORR to facilitate swift releases. \n                                                 \n1 Although the TVPRA refers to HHS, ORR (as an HHS subagency) carries out these statutory \nfunctions.   \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 10 of 31\n33.  The  TVPRA  also  includes  safeguards  concerning  the  removal  proceedings  of \nunaccompanied children.  Most importantly, if DHS seeks to remove a child who wishes to remain \nin the United States, the child must be put into full removal proceedings before an immigration \njudge, with the opportunity for an administrative appeal and review in the court of appeals.  Such \nchildren cannot be removed via fast-track removal processes applicable to others.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(a)(5)(D)(i).   \n34.  Unaccompanied  children  are  also  entitled  to  other  statutory  procedural  protections, \nincluding access to counsel, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(iii), and eligibility for the appointment of a \nchild advocate to look out for their interests, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(6).  Through these provisions, \nCongress recognized that unaccompanied children require special safeguards to ensure their full \naccess to humanitarian relief from removal. \n35.  In short, unaccompanied children are entitled to specific procedures before they can be \nexpelled from the country, and must be provided critical safeguards to facilitate their ability to \nseek humanitarian relief.   \n36.  Even  apart  from  the  TVPRA,  unaccompanied  children,  like  other  noncitizens,  have \nstatutory rights to seek relief in the United States from persecution and torture.  Three forms of \nrelief are possible: asylum, withholding of removal, and protection from torture.    \n37.  The  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”)  provides,  with  certain  enumerated \nexceptions—that do not include public health concerns—that “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port \nof arrival . . . ), irrespective of such alien’s status,” may apply for asylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \nTo qualify for asylum, a noncitizen must show a “well-founded fear of persecution” on account of \na protected ground.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).  Congress has expanded asylum eligibility for \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 11 of 31\nunaccompanied children, by exempting them from various requirements applicable to adults, \nincluding the one-year deadline for filing an application.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E).   \n38.  Second, in keeping with this country’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and \nthe 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, Congress has barred the removal of an \nindividual to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face persecution on a \nprotected ground.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).  This form of relief, known as “withholding of removal,” \nrequires the applicant to meet a higher burden with respect to the likelihood of harm but is \nmandatory if the standard is met. \n39.  Third, the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), implemented by FARRA, prohibits the \ngovernment from returning a noncitizen to a country where it is more likely than not that he would \nface torture.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note. \nThe Treatment of Communicable Diseases Under the Immigration Laws \n40.  The immigration system has long had to deal with communicable diseases.  Congress has \nthus enacted specific immigration provisions to address them, dating back to the late 1800s when \nCongress first began regulating immigration. \n41.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1) contains various “health-related” grounds of inadmissibility.  The \nstatute applies to noncitizens who present specified public health concerns, such as noncitizens \nwho have “communicable disease[s] of public health significance,” id. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(i); who \nhave not been vaccinated against certain widespread infectious diseases (e.g., mumps, measles, \nrubella), id. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(ii); who have “physical or mental disorder[s]” that may present \n“threat[s] to the property, safety, or welfare” of themselves or others, id. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(iii); or \nwho are “drug abuser[s] or addict[s],” id. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(iv).  But these statutes do not permit the \ndeportation of individuals without a screening for persecution or torture, and do not permit the \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 12 of 31\nsummary deportation of children in violation of the TVPRA.   \n42.  The  immigration  statute  also  contains  a  detention  provision  that  applies  to  certain \nnoncitizens “arriving at ports of the United States” who may be inadmissible on the health-related \ngrounds, or who come “from a country or have embarked at a place where any of such diseases \nare prevalent or epidemic.”  8 U.S.C. § 1222(a).  Such noncitizens may only be detained “for a \nsufficient time to . . . subject [them] to observation and an examination,” id., but may not be \ndeported without a screening for persecution or torture as the immigration statutes require. \nThe Administration’s Efforts to Bar Immigrants and the New Title 42 Process \n43.  The current Administration has repeatedly and publicly stated that restricting access to \nasylum, as well as eliminating the TVPRA, are among its key immigration objectives.  The \nPresident, his close advisors, and a succession of agency officers have repeatedly stated that the \nTVPRA creates a “loophole” in the border that they seek to close.  They have characterized \nunaccompanied children as dangerous gang members seeking to exploit the immigration laws.   \n44.  The Administration has also sought to use numerous regulatory and policy mechanisms to \nprevent noncitizens from seeking protection in this country, but the Title 42 Process at issue here \ngoes further than any of those efforts because it leaves almost no avenue open to seek protection. \n45.  Before  COVID-19,  Administration  officials  discussed  using  public  health  powers  to \nrestrict immigration and circumvent the protections in the immigration laws.  White House \nadvisors  repeatedly  proposed  invoking  the  government’s  public  health  powers  to  impose \nimmigration restrictions, and justifying those restrictions by pointing to diseases like influenza and \nmumps.     \n46.  Notwithstanding the clear statutory framework that requires the United States to allow \npeople arriving at the border (with or without valid travel documents) to apply for asylum, \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 13 of 31\nwithholding of removal, and CAT relief, and to provide special protections to unaccompanied \nchildren, the President announced on March 20, 2020, that the CDC would issue an order pursuant \nto the public health provisions of Title 42 of the U.S. Code “to suspend the introduction of all \nindividuals seeking to enter the U.S. without proper travel documentation” across the northern and \nsouthern borders.  The President stated that the order would be executed by “immediately \nreturning” such individuals “without delay.”   \n47.  The specific provision of Title 42 invoked by the Administration was § 265.  That provision \ndates to 1893 and was later reenacted in substantially the same language in the Public Health \nService Act of 1944.  Section 265 provides in relevant part: The Surgeon General may “prohibit . . . \nthe introduction of persons or property” from designated places where “by reason of the existence \nof any communicable disease in a foreign country there is serious danger of the introduction of \nsuch disease into the United States.”2 \n48.  Deportation has never been an available penalty under § 265, and in fact, § 265 applies to \nboth noncitizens and citizens.  Rather, the Public Health Service Act prescribes certain civil and \ncriminal penalties for violations of § 265, including “a fine of not more than $1,000 or . . . \nimprisonment for not more than one year, or both.”  42 U.S.C. § 271(a). \n49.  Although § 265 and its predecessors have existed since 1893, no regulation implementing \nthat statute has ever authorized the broad immigration powers Defendants are claiming here.     \n50.  To exercise this new immigration power, the CDC thus issued a new regulation, without \nadvance notice and comment, on the same day as the President’s announcement.  See Control of \nCommunicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of Introduction of Persons Into United \n                                                 \n2 In 1966, the Surgeon General’s § 265 authority was transferred to what is now HHS.  In 2001, \nHHS delegated this authority to the CDC.  The President’s functions under § 265 were assigned \nto the Secretary of HHS in a 2003 executive order.  \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 14 of 31\nStates From Designated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes, 85 Fed. Reg. \n16559-01 (Mar. 24, 2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020). \n51.  Specifically, the regulation added a new provision, 42 C.F.R. § 71.40, which provides that \nthe CDC may prohibit the “introduction into the United States of persons” from foreign countries.  \n85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563; see 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(a).  The public notice of the regulation describes the \n“introduction of persons” in 42 U.S.C. § 265 to “encompass those who have physically crossed a \nborder of the United States and are in the process of moving into the interior in a manner the [CDC] \nDirector determines to present a risk of transmission of a communicable disease.”  85 Fed. Reg. at \n16,563; see 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(b)(1).  And it describes “serious danger of the introduction of [a \nparticular communicable] disease into the United States” in § 265 as meaning “the potential for \nintroduction of vectors of the communicable disease into the United States, even if persons or \nproperty in the United States are already infected or contaminated with the [same] communicable \ndisease.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563; see 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(b)(2). \n52.  The regulation exempted U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (“LPRs”), and members \nof the armed forces, stating that the “CDC believes that, at present, quarantine, isolation, and \nconditional  release,  in  combination  with  other  authorities,  while  not  perfect  solutions,  can \nmitigate” the spread of COVID-19 by such individuals.  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,564; see 42 C.F.R. \n§ 71.40(e), (f).   \n53.  The regulation also provides that, if an order suspending the introduction of persons “will \nbe implemented in whole or in part” by CBP, “then the [CDC] Director shall, in coordination with \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security or other applicable Federal department or agency head, \nexplain in the order the procedures and standards by which any authorities or officers or agents are \nexpected to aid in the enforcement of the order.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 16,564; see 42 C.F.R. \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 15 of 31\n§ 71.40(d)(2). \n54.  Pursuant to its new regulatory authority, the CDC issued a 30-day “Order Under Sections \n362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 265, 268] Suspending Introduction of \nCertain Persons From Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists.”  85 Fed. Reg. 17,060-\n17088 (Mar. 26, 2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020).  The Order directed the “immediate \nsuspension of the introduction” of certain persons, referred to as “covered aliens.”  85 Fed. Reg. \nat 17,067.  “Covered aliens” are those seeking to enter the United States through Canada or Mexico \nwho “seek[] to enter . . . at POEs [ports of entry] who do not have proper travel documents, aliens \nwhose entry is otherwise contrary to law, and aliens who are apprehended near the border seeking \nto unlawfully enter the United States between POEs.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  Section 365 of the \nAct, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 268, provides that “[i]t shall be the duty of the customs officers and \nof Coast Guard officers to aid in the enforcement of quarantine rules and regulations.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 268(b). \n55.  A principal justification for these restrictions was that “[t]he introduction into congregate \nsettings in land POEs and Border Patrol stations” of such individuals risks “transmission and \nspread of COVID-19 to CBP personnel” and others.  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061. \n56.  The Order contemplates the forcible return of individuals back to the country from which \nthey entered (Canada or Mexico), their home country, or another location.  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,067.   \n57.  Although the Order is issued by the CDC, and the regulation provides that the CDC and \nDHS  must  coordinate  in  developing  corresponding  procedures  and  standards,  42  C.F.R. \n§ 71.40(d)(2), the Order states that CBP “developed an operational plan for implementing the \norder.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,067.   \n58.  In addition to repeating the regulatory exceptions for U.S. citizens and LPRs, the Order \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 16 of 31\nexempts from the ban the spouses and children of citizens and LPRs (whether or not they have \nvalid documents); persons from foreign countries with valid travel documents; and persons from \ncountries in the visa waiver program who present at ports of entry.  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  The \nvisa waiver program applies to nationals of 39 countries. \n59.  The Order also states that DHS customs officers could, in their discretion, determine that \na noncitizen “should be excepted [from the Order] based on the totality of the circumstances, \nincluding consideration of significant law enforcement, officer and public safety, humanitarian, \nand public health interests.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  Other than stating that a supervisor must \napprove such exceptions, the Order contains no standards or further procedures for exercising that \ndiscretion.  See id.  \n60.  The Order and regulation are silent on their application to individuals seeking asylum, \nwithholding of removal, or CAT protection, and are likewise silent regarding their application to \nunaccompanied children. \n61.   The March 20 Order was extended for an additional 30 days on April 20, 2020.  See \nExtension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act, 85 Fed. Reg. \n22,424 (Apr. 22, 2020) (effective date Apr. 20, 2020). \n62.  On May 20, 2020, the CDC extended the Order indefinitely, and amended it to cover both \nland and coastal ports of entry and Border Patrol stations.  See Amendment and Extension of Order \nUnder Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 31,503 (May 26, 2020) \n(effective date May 21, 2020). \n63.  The May 20 amended Order acknowledges that “certain areas of the country are beginning \na phased reopening of their communities,” but states that “[a]t this critical juncture, it would be \ncounterproductive to . . . relax[] restrictions” on the immigration of persons “who pose a risk of \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 17 of 31\nfurther introducing COVID-19 into the United States.”  85 Fed. Reg. at 31,505.  As with the prior \ntwo 30-day Orders, a principal justification articulated for the indefinite Order was the danger to \nborder agents who would have to inspect persons who come without documents.  \n64.  The CDC acknowledged that there were alternatives to expulsion but concluded that it was \nnot worth the resources for those who lacked documents.  The CDC also presumed, without \nevidence, that those without documents covered by the Order would lack a means of self-\nquarantining. \nDHS’s Implementation of the Title 42 Process \n65.  On April 2, 2020, CBP issued a memorandum (“CBP Memo”) describing the agency’s \nimplementation of the Title 42 Process, an effort it calls “Operation Capio.”  CBP Memo 2.   \n66.  To determine whether a noncitizen is “subject to the CDC Order,” the CBP Memo instructs \nofficers to use “experience” and “physical observation” to determine whether they “believe[] that \nit is more likely than not” that the person whom they encounter in “[e]nforcement efforts on the \nSWB [southwestern border] and NB [northern border],” anywhere “within the area of operation of \na Border Patrol station or POE operated by CBP,” is “seeking to enter” without proper travel \ndocuments at or between POEs.  CBP Memo 1.   \n67.  Covered noncitizens “will be transported to the nearest POE and immediately returned to \nMexico or Canada, depending on their point of transit.”  CBP Memo 3.  Those who are “not \namenable to immediate expulsion to Mexico or Canada, will be transported to a dedicated facility \nfor limited holding prior to expulsion” to their home country.  Id.  Such facilities can be “a tent, \nsoft-sided facility or predesignated CBP/USBP facility with dedicated space.”  Id. \n68.  The CBP Memo provides no instructions on medical screenings or other procedures for \ndetermining whether a covered noncitizen may have COVID-19. \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 18 of 31\n69.  The CBP Memo does not exempt minors from forcible expulsion.   \n70.  CBP deported nearly 1,000 unaccompanied children in March and April.  In May, over \n1,000 unaccompanied children were taken into CBP custody, and only 39 of these children were \ntransferred to ORR shelters rather than being summarily expelled.  In June, CBP apprehended over \n1,600 unaccompanied children, and only 61 (less than four percent) were transferred to ORR \ncustody.  On June 25, 2020, Defendant Mark Morgan, Acting Commissioner of CBP, testified \nbefore Congress that over 2,000 unaccompanied children had been deported under the Title 42 \nProcess as of that date.   \n71.  In addition to deporting children to their home countries, CBP has turned back multiple \nchildren to Mexico in the middle of the night. \n72.  CBP also temporarily houses unaccompanied children in hotels as they await deportation \nflights.  Unaccompanied children subject to the Title 42 Process are often in the hotels for multiple \ndays, and often longer than 72 hours. \n73.  The number of referrals of unaccompanied children to ORR has thus plummeted.  Before \nthe Title 42 Process, ORR shelters received as many as 77 children daily.  But in April, daily \nreferrals dropped to the single digits, and ORR stated it received only 58 children from CBP that \nmonth.  That same month, CBP apprehended over 700 unaccompanied children at the southwest \nborder.  In May 2020, the total number of children in ORR custody was reportedly about 1,600, \ndown from approximately 12,500 children in April 2019.  As of mid-June, ORR had less than 975 \nchildren, a 72% decline from the number of children in custody in late March. \n74.  Before  expelling  children  to  their  home  countries  under  the  Title  42  Process,  the \ngovernment tests children to ensure they do not have COVID-19. \n75.  CDC suggested in the May 20 Order that there has been a reduced rate of transmission and \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 19 of 31\nthat this is due to reduced number of “covered aliens” at ports of entry and border patrol stations.  \nCDC offered no evidence for this claim. \n76.  The use of the term “Title 42 Process” throughout this complaint refers collectively to the \nnew regulation, all three of the CDC Orders—the original March 20 order, the April 20 extension, \nand the May 20 indefinite extension and amendment—and the CBP Memo. \nDefendants Seek to Expel Plaintiff Under the Title 42 Process \n77.  Plaintiff  P.J.E.S.  is  a  16-year-old  boy  from  Guatemala.    He  is  one  of  the  many \nunaccompanied children subject to summary expulsions by CBP pursuant to the Title 42 Process.   \n78.  Plaintiff’s father, Mario Escobar Francisco, lives in the United States.  His father has a \npending immigration case. \n79.  Plaintiff experienced severe persecution in Guatemala.  Plaintiff is from an indigenous \nMayan family.  Plaintiff fled Guatemala after he and his other family members were threatened \nwith death due to his father’s political opinions.  In addition, gang members threatened to kill \nPlaintiff when he refused to join them \n80.  Plaintiff fled Guatemala because he was afraid for his life and journeyed the United States \nto seek safety and reunite with his father. \n81.  On or around August 11, 2020, Plaintiff entered the United States, and CBP apprehended \nhim.  CBP subjected him to the Title 42 Process, and he faces imminent deportation back to \nGuatemala.  He is currently in CBP custody in the McAllen, Texas area. \n82.  The  threat  of  persecution  and  torture  to  Plaintiff  is  imminent  and  real.  Many \nunaccompanied children, like Plaintiff, are from Central America’s Northern Triangle (Honduras, \nGuatemala, and El Salvador), one of the most violent regions in the world with high rates of \nmurder.  And children are not exempt from this widespread danger.  Indeed, many children are \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 20 of 31\ntargeted specifically by gang members for recruitment or experience gender-related violence. \n83.  Many children are also eligible for other forms of humanitarian relief Congress has \nprovided, including visas for young people who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by \ntheir parents or guardians; or relief for victims of trafficking or crime.  \n84.  If Plaintiff is allowed to remain in the United States, he could live with his father, who \ncurrently resides in the United States and is waiting for him, or another suitable sponsor.   \n85.  Even if Plaintiff was required to first reside for a short time in a ORR children shelter, he \ncould do so safely.  There are ORR facilities that have experience with communicable diseases.  \nMoreover,  because  ORR  facilities  are  currently  well  under  capacity,  social  distancing  and \nquarantine would be possible. \n86.  Even before the Title 42 Process took effect, the ORR-contracted shelter network was \noperating significantly below capacity.  The system can house approximately 14,000 children.  \nNews reports stated that in the first two months of 2020, ORR was housing only about 2,000 to \n3,000 children nationwide.   \n87.  After the Title 42 Process went into place, the numbers dropped even more precipitously.  \nAs of July 17, 2020, the number of children detained in ORR custody was reportedly at about \n820—approximately 6 percent of total capacity. \n88.  Because Plaintiff could have been transferred directly to his father or another sponsor or to \nan ORR shelter, he would pose minimal, if any, additional risk to border agents. \n89.  Children have been required to remain in DHS custody longer than the time it would have \ntaken to transfer them to their family members or to an ORR facility.   \n90.  The Title 42 Process is not justified by public health concerns.  A principal justification is \nthat border agents will have greater exposure if they are required to process individuals who lack \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 21 of 31\ndocuments and that it is therefore necessary to deport such individuals to reduce the risk to agents.  \nBut, as Plaintiff’s facts illustrate, arranging for air transport to deport individuals will generally \ntake longer than time in which DHS must transfer children to ORR or family members.  In addition, \nwhere the individual shows no signs of COVID-19, as is likely true for many of the unaccompanied \nchildren at issue here, the risk is even less.   \n91.  Defendants do not publicly disclose the locations where they are holding unaccompanied \nchildren subject to the Title 42 Process.  News reports, confirmed by the experiences of numerous \nunaccompanied children, state that children are held for days or weeks in hotels while they await \nflights back to their home countries.  Others are detained in CBP facilities near the border, \nreportedly held in cage-like settings with other children.   \n92.  Public reports show that unaccompanied children subject to the Title 42 Process are \nregularly housed in hotels, for an average of four to five days while waiting for deportation flights.  \nA 5-year-old was recently detained for 19 days at in a hotel. \n93.  Unaccompanied children subject to the Title 42 Process face numerous problems accessing \nlegal representation.  Because children can be expelled under Title 42 in a matter of days, the child \nor any family member who obtains information about the child has only a limited amount of time \nin which to advocate for the child.  And because the Title 42 Process has operated largely in secret, \nits rules and procedures have remained opaque to children, their parents, and any lawyers and \nadvocates who seek to help them.  Unaccompanied children are also unable, by reason of their \nyouth, to advocate effectively for themselves, especially when detained in custodial settings by \ngovernment officers.  Many do not speak English, and lack even a basic comprehension of the \nU.S. legal system.  Their relatives are similarly not well-situated to help navigate this process, \nespecially given the time constraints; many children are from families in which few members have \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 22 of 31\nhad significant formal schooling, much less any fluency in English. \nThe Title 42 Process Is An Extreme Outlier  \n94.  The  Title  42  Process  at  issue  here  follows  other  invocations  of  COVID-19  by  the \nAdministration to ban immigration, but it is far more extreme in seeking to eliminate statutory \nprotections for vulnerable noncitizens and children.  And it is not only a ban on entry, but provides \nfor summary expulsion for those who entered the country.   \n95.  For example, in February and March of 2020, the President issued a series of Proclamations \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) to prohibit the entry of certain persons traveling from China, Iran, and \ncertain European countries where COVID-19 was prevalent.  However, unlike the Title 42 Process, \nthose Proclamations expressly stated that they did not restrict “any individual’s eligibility for \nasylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the regulations issued pursuant to the \nlegislation implementing the Convention Against Torture.”   \n96.  At the same time, the government continues to permit large numbers of people to enter the \nUnited States.  In addition to the Title 42 Process at issue here, DHS issued two other orders on \nMarch 20, 2020, which temporarily suspended “non-essential” travel from Canada and Mexico.  \nUnder  these  orders,  permitted  “essential  travel”  broadly  includes  citizens,  returning  LPRs, \nindividuals traveling for medical purposes, individuals traveling to attend education institutions, \nindividuals traveling to work in the United States (e.g., agricultural workers), truck drivers moving \ncargo between the United States and Canada, emergency responders, and those engaged in military \ntravel and operations.   \n97.  On  May  22,  2020,  Defendant  Wolf  issued  an  “exemption”  from  the  President’s \nProclamations under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), which additionally permitted certain professional athletes, \ntheir staff, and their dependents to enter the country.  Defendant Wolf determined that it served \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 23 of 31\n“the national interest” to permit noncitizens who compete in, inter alia, the National Basketball \nAssociation, the Professional Golfers’ Association Tour, and the National Hockey League, to enter \nthe country and participate in sporting events. \n98.  Hundreds of thousands of individuals continue to move back and forth across the U.S.-\nMexico border every day.  Since March 20, 2020, when the Title 42 Process first went into effect, \nnumerous individuals exempted from the ban have come into the United States.  \n99.  The Title 42 Process is inconsistent with how other countries have handled migration in \nthe  time  of  COVID-19,  particularly  with  respect  to  asylum  seekers  and  other  vulnerable \npopulations.  Numerous countries in Western Europe, such as France, Italy, and Spain, have \nexempted asylum seekers from their immigration prohibitions, and permitted them to seek relief \nfrom persecution from inside their countries.  And while Canada has imposed certain restrictions \non the migration of adults without documentation if they do not enter at official ports of entry, it \nexpressly exempts unaccompanied children from those restrictions.   \nClass Action Allegations \n100.  Plaintiff brings this action under Federal Civil Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) \non behalf of himself and a class of all other persons similarly situated. \n101.  Plaintiff seeks to represent the following Proposed Class: All unaccompanied noncitizen \nchildren who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. government custody in the United States, and \n(2) are or will be subjected to the Title 42 Process.   \n102.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  According to Defendants’ own public \nreports,  confirmed  by  numerous  news  articles  and  other  sources,  there  are  hundreds  of \nunaccompanied children that fit in the class definition, including numerous future unaccompanied \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 24 of 31\nchildren. \n103.  The class meets the commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  The members of the class \nare subject to a common practice: subjection to the Title 42 Process, despite the numerous statutory \nprotections Congress has enacted, including for unaccompanied children.  By definition, all class \nmembers are or will be subject to that practice.  The lawsuit raises numerous questions of law \ncommon to members of the proposed class, including: whether § 265 authorizes expulsions; \nwhether the Title 42 Process violates the immigration statutes; and whether the promulgation of \nthe Title 42 Process satisfied the APA’s requirements.  Plaintiff and proposed class members also \nshare a common core of facts: all are minors who came (or will come) to the United States \nunaccompanied and were (or will be) subsequently taken into DHS custody; all have been (or will \nbe) subjected to the Title 42 Process; and none have been afforded the protections provided under \nthe immigration laws, including the requirement that unaccompanied children be transferred to \nORR custody. \n104.  The proposed class meets the typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3), because the claims \nof the representative Plaintiff are typical of the claims of the class.  Plaintiff is an unaccompanied \nchild who came to the border and was subjected to the Title 42 Process and threatened with swift \nexpulsion, without being afforded any of the statutory protections he should have received.  \n105.  The proposed class meets the adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).  The representative \nPlaintiff seeks the same relief as the other members of the class—among other things, an order \ndeclaring the Title 42 Process unlawful as applied to unaccompanied children, and an injunction \nagainst the application of the Title 42 Process.  In defending their rights, Plaintiff will defend the \nrights of all proposed class members fairly and adequately.  \n106.  The proposed class is represented by counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 25 of 31\nFoundation Immigrants’ Rights Project and other experienced attorneys.  Proposed Class Counsel \nhave extensive experience litigating class action lawsuits and other complex systemic cases in \nfederal  court  on  behalf  of  unaccompanied  migrant  children  and  other  noncitizens  facing \ndeportation.  \n107.  The proposed class also satisfies Rule 23(b)(2).  Defendants have acted (or will act) on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class by subjecting them to the Title 42 Process rather than \naffording them the protections of the immigration laws.  Injunctive and declaratory relief is \ntherefore appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(VIOLATION OF TVPRA, 8 U.S.C. § 1232, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n108.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n109.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  The APA also provides relief for a failure to act: “The reviewing court shall . . . \ncompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n110.  The TVPRA, 8 U.S.C. § 1232, includes mandatory requirements for the processing, \ncustody, release, and removal of unaccompanied children.  Defendants’ subjection of Plaintiff to \nthe Title 42 Process violates the statute in numerous ways, including that he has been deprived of \ncertain procedural safeguards concerning his right to remain in the United States; and that he has \nbeen deprived of numerous safeguards designed to ensure his safety and proper care. \n111.  Defendants’ subjection of Plaintiff to the Title 42 Process violates the TVPRA. \n112.  As a result, Defendants’ application of the Title 42 Process and regulation to Plaintiff is \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 26 of 31\ncontrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n113.  Moreover, by refusing to grant Plaintiff the statutory protections to which the TVPRA \nentitles him, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(ULTRA VIRES, VIOLATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. \n265, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n114.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n115.  Title 42 of the U.S. Code does not authorize the expulsion of noncitizens from the United \nStates. \n116.  Title 42 of the U.S. Code also does not authorize the expulsion of children from the United \nStates without affording them the protections of the TVPRA or other statutory protections afforded \nunder the INA.  As a result, the application of the Title 42 Process to Plaintiff, which will result in \nhis expulsion from the United States, is contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n117.  The Title 42 Process which was purportedly established pursuant to the authority of 42 \nU.S.C. § 265, was not authorized by that provision and is ultra vires. \n118.  The application of the Title 42 Process to Plaintiff is contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL, \nAND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, \n5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n \n119.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n120.  The “withholding of removal” statute, INA § 241(b)(3), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), \nbars the removal of an individual to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 27 of 31\npersecution.  \n121.  Only an immigration judge can determine whether a minor faces a risk of persecution and \nis entitled to withholding of removal after full removal proceedings in immigration court.  8 C.F.R. \n§ 1208.16(a). \n122.  Defendants applied the Title 42 Process and regulation to Plaintiff without any of these \nrequired safeguards.   \n123.  Application of the Title 42 Process and regulation to Plaintiff therefore violated 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3), and its implementing regulations.   \n124.  As a result, Defendants’ actions against Plaintiff are contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n125.  In  addition,  by  refusing  to  grant  Plaintiff  the  procedures  mandated  by  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3), and its implementing regulations, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably \ndelayed actions mandated by the statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(ASYLUM: VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1108(a), AND ADMINISTRATIVE \nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n126.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n127.  The INA provides, with certain exceptions, that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in \nthe United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival \nand including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in \ninternational or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum in \naccordance with this section . . . .”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \n128.  Defendants’ application of the Title 42 Process to Plaintiff has prevented him from \napplying for asylum in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), and was therefore contrary to law.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 28 of 31\nSee 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n129.  In addition, by refusing to grant Plaintiff the meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum \nto which his is entitled, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by \nthe statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(VIOLATION OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING ACT \nOF 1998, CODIFIED AT 8 U.S.C. § 1231 NOTE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE \nPROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n130.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n131.  FARRA prohibits the government from returning a noncitizen to a country where it is more \nlikely than not that he would face torture. \n132.  Pursuant to regulation, only an immigration judge, after full removal proceedings in \nimmigration court, can determine whether a minor faces a risk of torture if removed from the \nUnited States.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a). \n133.  Defendants applied the Title 42 Process and regulation to Plaintiff, to provide for his \nsummary expulsion without placing them into full removal proceedings.   \n134.  The  application  of  the  Title  42  Process  to  Plaintiff  therefore  violated  § 1231(b)(3), \nFARRA, and their implementing regulations.   \n135.  Defendants’ actions were contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n136.  In addition, by refusing to grant Plaintiff access to full removal proceedings, Defendants \nhave withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(VIOLATION OF 8 U.S.C. § 1101, ET SEQ., AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A)) \n137.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 29 of 31\n138.  The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., sets out the sole mechanisms established by Congress \nfor the removal of noncitizens. \n139.  The INA provides that removal proceedings before an immigration judge under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a is “the sole and exclusive procedure” by which the government may determine whether \nto remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise specified” in the INA.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n140.  The Title 42 Process creates an alternative removal mechanism.  The Title 42 Process \npurports to operate outside of the immigration laws set forth by Congress in Title 8. \n141.  Because the Title 42 Process provides for the expulsion of Plaintiff without the procedures \nspecified in the INA, it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1229a and the INA. \n142.  As a result, Defendants’ actions against Plaintiff were contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n143.  In addition, by refusing to grant Plaintiff access to the procedures specified in the INA, \nDefendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(1). \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n144.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n145.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Defendants have not \narticulated  a  reasoned  explanation  for  their  decision  to  apply  the  Title  42  Process  to \nunaccompanied children; failed to consider relevant factors in applying the Title 42 process to \nthem, including their statutory protections as unaccompanied children and their fear of persecution \nand torture in their home countries; relied on factors Congress did not intend to be considered; \nfailed to consider reasonable alternatives that were less restrictive; and offered no sufficient \nexplanation for their decision to expel them from the country. \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 30 of 31\n146.   Plaintiff’s subjection to the Title 42 Process is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law \nbecause it also departs from the agency’s existing policies for the processing, care, custody, and \nremoval of unaccompanied children, including unaccompanied minors with contagious diseases, \nas well as prior policies prohibiting the return of individuals who fear persecution or torture, \nwithout providing a reasoned explanation for departing from these policies.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays this Court to: \na.  Certify a Class of:  All unaccompanied noncitizen children who (1) are or will be detained \nin U.S. government custody in the United States, and (2) are or will be subjected to the Title 42 \nProcess; \nb.  Appoint the undersigned as Class Counsel;   \nc.  Declare unlawful the Title 42 Process as applied to Plaintiff and Class Members; \nd.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants from applying the Title 42 Process to Plaintiff and \nClass Members; \ne.  Enter an order providing relief for Plaintiff and Class Members by ordering that Defendants \nstay their expulsion, remove them from the Title 42 Process, and to afford them the TVPRA’s \nstatutory requirements and protections, as well as the procedures guaranteed by the INA including \naccess to asylum, withholding of removal, CAT relief, and all other forms of relief to which they \nare eligible; \nf.  Award Plaintiff’s counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, \nand any other applicable statute or regulation; and \ng.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245   Document 1   Filed 08/14/20   Page 31 of 31\nDated: August 14, 2020       Respectfully submitted, \n/s/ Celso J.

Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 7(m), Plaintiff \ncontacted counsel for the government for their position on this Motion.

The scheme challenged \nin this case is called the “Title 42 Process.”  Defendants stated in June 2020 that, as of that time, \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15   Filed 08/20/20   Page 2 of 3\nthey had expelled approximately 2,000 unaccompanied children pursuant to the Title 42 Process.  \nRecent reports show that more such children are expelled every day.  Due to the irreparable harm \nfaced by the children subject to the Title 42 Process, Plaintiff believes expedited consideration is \nwarranted. \nDated: August 20, 2020        Respectfully submitted, \n/s/Lee Gelernt_____________________ \nStephen B.

Under longstanding safeguards in the immigration \nstatutes for unaccompanied children and asylum seekers, P.J.E.S. was entitled to various \nprotections—including expeditious transfer from CBP to the care of the Office of Refugee and \nResettlement (“ORR”), release to his father in the United States as soon as possible, and a full \nhearing before an immigration judge on his asylum claim.  Instead, Defendants moved to \nsummarily deport him based on an unprecedented and unlawful Order issued by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) authorizing the expulsion of unaccompanied minors \nwithout any hearing, even where, as here, the minor has no symptoms of COVID-19.   \nWhile Defendants have now agreed not to expel P.J.E.S., they have already expelled at \nleast 2,000 unaccompanied children pursuant to the CDC Order, which is based on the \ngovernment’s supposed expulsion powers under the public health provisions of Title 42.  And \nmore children face the same fate every day.  Plaintiff therefore respectfully moves this Court, in \nconjunction with his previously filed motion for class certification, for a preliminary injunction \nbarring the expulsion of any unaccompanied child under this new, unlawful deportation system. 1  \n                                                           \n1 Because the Named Plaintiff was subjected to the Title 42 Process when the class complaint \nand class certification motion were filed, the Court can certify the class and issue class relief.  \nSee J.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, 1311 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court \nto resolve both the pending Motion for Class Certification and this Motion together.  See ECF \nNo. 2 (Motion for Class Certification); see also Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d 317, 328-35 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (explaining that plaintiffs “need only provisional class certification in order for \nthe Court to grant their preliminary injunction,” and describing standards that govern provisional \nclass certification). \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 11 of 44\n \nThe government’s new Title 42 expulsion process, based on a new regulation, several \niterations of the CDC Order, and an implementation memo (hereafter collectively the “Title 42 \nProcess”), is patently unlawful.  Judge Nichols in this District has already found the Process \nlikely is unlawful in the only ruling thus far on the issue.  See Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-2, Ex. D, \n(Transcript of June 24, 2020 Preliminary Injunction Hearing and Oral Ruling) (hereinafter \n“J.B.B.C. PI Ruling”); Order, J.B.B.C. v. Wolf, No. 20-cv-1509, (D.D.C. June 24, 2020), ECF \nNo. 38. \nJudge Nichols’s decision is correct, for at least two reasons.  First, Title 42 does not \nauthorize deportations at all.  Rather, it authorizes testing, and in extreme cases, detention and \nquarantine.  In short, Title 42 provides for public health measures.  It is not a deportation statute.  \nSecond, even assuming that Title 42 somehow could be construed to authorize deportations of \nsome noncitizens, it does not override later-enacted statutes protecting children and those \nseeking protection.  Indeed, Congress specifically addressed communicable diseases in the \nimmigration laws.  Those laws allow the government to bar entry of some individuals with \ncommunicable diseases, but it is well established that unaccompanied children and those seeking \nprotection must be provided the protections to which they are entitled, and may not be \nautomatically expelled even if they actually have a communicable disease. \nAt bottom, this is a separation of powers case.  The Administration has circumvented the \nprocess created by Congress to deal with unaccompanied minors, those seeking protection and \nthose with communicable diseases.  And, because of the government’s unlawful actions, \nunaccompanied children are suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm.  The Court \nshould therefore grant provisional class certification and a preliminary injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from subjecting unaccompanied children to the Title 42 Process. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 12 of 44\n \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Immigration Laws’ Protections for Unaccompanied Children \nCongress has carefully and repeatedly worked to ensure that unaccompanied children are \nafforded unique, mandatory, and protective procedures when they face deportation.  \nSpecifically, two laws guarantee the children’s proper care and facilitate their efforts to \nseek humanitarian protection.  First, in 2002, Congress included provisions in the Homeland \nSecurity Act (“HSA”) to “ensur[e] that the interests of the child are considered in decisions and \nactions relating to the care and custody of an unaccompanied alien child.”  6 U.S.C. \n§ 279(b)(1)(B).  Through the HSA, Congress vested responsibility for the care of unaccompanied \nchildren, including the provision of housing and access to legal services to pursue claims for \nimmigration relief, in the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), a component of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  ORR had demonstrated experience \nworking with vulnerable immigrants and refugees, and thus more suitable to oversee the care of \nunaccompanied children than immigration enforcement authorities.   \nSecond, in 2008, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct (“TVPRA”), which strengthened those protections by creating specific mechanisms for \nprocessing the claims of unaccompanied children who had claims for relief from removal.  \nAmong those protections was that certain unaccompanied children, like Plaintiff here, should be \nswiftly referred to ORR, which would then take responsibility for their care, and release them to \nfamily members or other suitable sponsors in the United States.  See J.D. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 1291, \n1301-02 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (describing TVPRA statutory scheme and ORR shelter system). \nThus, Congress has prescribed a careful and comprehensive set of directions to federal \nagencies for how unaccompanied children should be processed and cared for upon their \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 13 of 44\n \napprehension.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(C), (a)(5), (c)(2)-(3).  Congress has also set forth \nspecific instructions concerning the procedures Defendants must follow before removing \nunaccompanied children.2  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(A), (a)(5).   \nB.  The Immigration Laws’ Protections for Asylum Seekers \nMore generally, Congress also has proscribed longstanding protections for noncitizens, \nincluding children, seeking protection from persecution and torture.  First, the asylum statute, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158, provides that any noncitizen in the United States has a right to apply for asylum, \nregardless of their status.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1) (providing that “[a]ny alien who is \nphysically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a \ndesignated port of arrival . . .), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum”).  The \nasylum statute provides a narrow list of bars to asylum., none of which apply here.3  Moreover, \nCongress expressed a special concern with expanding access to asylum for unaccompanied \nchildren by, e.g., exempting them from the one-year deadline that ordinarily applies to asylum \napplications and preventing their removal to a “safe third country,” id. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E), \n                                                           \n2 For children from “noncontiguous” countries, like Plaintiff P.J.E.S., Congress directed that \nsuch children be expeditiously transferred to ORR custody within 72 hours.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(b)(3).  For children from contiguous countries, i.e. Canada and Mexico, Defendants may \nconduct a screening for them prior to transfer to ORR.  Id. § 1232(a)(2)-(4).  Children in ORR \ncare cannot be deported via fast-track proceedings, and instead must receive full removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge, along with other statutory protections.  Id. \n§ 1232(a)(5)(D)(iii).  The Title 42 process does not comply with the TVPRA’s mandates. \n3 The statute makes asylum unavailable to an applicant who, inter alia, previously applied for and \nwas denied asylum, id. § 1158(a)(2)(C) (previous denial bar); engaged in persecution or terrorist \nactivities, id. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(i) (persecution of others bar); id. at § 1158(b)(2)(A)(v) (terrorist \nbar); id. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(iv) (national security bar); has committed certain crimes, id. \n§§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) (particularly serious crime bar), 1158(b)(2)(A)(iii) (serious non-political \ncrime bar); and who “was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United \nStates,” id. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) (firm settlement bar).   \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 14 of 44\n \nand providing them the opportunity to apply for asylum in the first instance before an asylum \nofficer in a non-adversarial setting, id. § 1158(b)(3)(C).  \nSecond, the withholding of removal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), provides that a \nnoncitizen “may not” be removed to a country where their “life or freedom” would be threatened \nbased on a protected ground.  A grant of withholding is mandatory if the individual meets the \nstatutory criteria.  INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 420 (1999).  Congress enacted this \nstatute to “conform[] it to the language of Article 33 [of the 1951 U.N. Convention of \nRefugees],” INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 421 (1984), in several respects, including by making \nwithholding “mandatory” where the eligibility criteria are satisfied, INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, \n480 U.S. 421, 440 n.25 (1987), and by giving it broad application where the government seeks to \nreturn a noncitizen to a country where he fears persecution, see Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, 951 \nF.3d 1073, 1089 (9th Cir. 2020).  Congress again outlined specific and narrow bars to \nwithholding of removal; none apply here.4  Notably, moreover, only an immigration judge can \ndetermine whether a minor faces a risk of persecution and is entitled to withholding of removal \nafter full removal proceedings in immigration court.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a). \nThird, protections under Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) prohibit returning a \nnoncitizen to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face torture.  Article 3 of \n                                                           \n4  A withholding applicant who assisted in Nazi persecution is barred from withholding.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B).  The other bars address persecutors, id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(i); particularly \nserious crimes, id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii); serious non-political crimes, id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii); and \nsecurity and terrorism, id. § 1231(b)(3)(B)(iv). \nThe Department of Homeland Security recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking \nfor a rule providing, among other things, that the national security bars to asylum and \nwithholding of removal would “apply in the context of public health emergencies related to the \npossible threat of introduction or further spread of international pandemics into the United \nStates.”  Security Bars and Processing, 85 Fed. Reg. 41,201 (July 9, 2020).  This proposed rule \nhas not gone into effect and is not at issue in this case. \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 15 of 44\n \nCAT provides that “[n]o State Party shall expel, return (‘refouler’) or extradite a person to \nanother State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of \nbeing subjected to torture.”  Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, at 20 (1988).  \nCongress subsequently implemented Article 3 of CAT.  See Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”) § 2242(a), Pub. L. No. 105-207, Div. G. Title XXI, 112 \nStat. 2681 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16-.18 (implementing \nregulations).  There are no bars to eligibility for CAT protection.  See, e.g., Negusie v. Holder, \n555 U.S. 511, 514 (2009).  As with withholding, only an immigration judge, after full removal \nproceedings in immigration court, can determine whether a minor faces a risk of torture if \nremoved from the United States.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a).  \nC.   Immigration Laws’ Treatment of Communicable Diseases  \nCongress has specially addressed communicable diseases in the immigration laws.  From \nthe earliest days of immigration regulation, Congress has explicitly authorized the deportation of \nindividuals based on public health concerns.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084, \n1085.  Similar statutes exist today.  There are several “[h]ealth-related grounds” of \ninadmissibility that authorize the deportation of noncitizens based on specified public health \nconcerns, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1), including if a noncitizen is determined to have “a \ncommunicable disease of public health significance,” id. § 1182(a)(1)(i).  Immigration statutes \nalso provide for medical examination and detention as part of immigration processing.  See id. \n§ 1222(a) (authorizing detention of arriving noncitizens who might have a communicable disease \nor is “coming from a country or have embarked at a place where any of such diseases are \nprevalent or epidemic,” but only “for a sufficient time to . . . subject [them] to observation and an \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 16 of 44\n \nexamination”); id. § 1222(b) (authorizing physical and mental examination of arriving \nnoncitizens).  But these statutes do not permit the summary deportation of children in violation \nof the TVPRA, or deportation without a screening for persecution or torture. \nD.  The Title 42 Process  \nAnnounced by the President on March 20, 2020, the Title 42 Process is a new shadow \nimmigration system purportedly established under the government’s public health powers \ncodified in Title 42 of the U.S. Code.  Specifically, in a series of agency documents, the CDC \nhas invoked 42 U.S.C. § 265 to bar and expel noncitizens who arrive at the border or enter the \ncountry without documents.5   \nSection 265 of Title 42 was first enacted in 1893 and was later reenacted in substantially \nthe same language in the Public Health Service Act of 1944.  Act of February 15, 1893, § 7, ch. \n114, 27 Stat. 449, 452; Public Health Service Act, Pub. L. 78-410, § 362, 58 Stat. 682, 704 \n(1944).  It provides in relevant part that the Surgeon General may “prohibit . . . the introduction \nof persons or property” from designated places where “by reason of the existence of any \ncommunicable disease in a foreign country there is serious danger of the introduction of such \ndisease into the United States.”6  42 U.S.C. § 265.  The penalties for violating § 265 include “a \n                                                           \n5 See Control of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of Introduction of \nPersons into United States From Designated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health \nPurposes, 85 Fed. Reg. 16,559 (Mar. 24, 2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020); Order Under \nSections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act Suspending Introduction of Certain \nPersons From Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. 17,060 (Mar. 26, \n2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020); Extension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the \nPublic Health Service Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 22,424 (Apr. 22, 2020) (effective date Apr. 20, 2020); \nAmendment and Extension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service \nAct, 85 Fed. Reg. 31,503 (May 26, 2020) (effective date May 21, 2020); U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection and U.S. Border Patrol “Operation Capio” Memo [hereinafter “CBP Memo”], \nsee Decl. of Adrienne Harrold (“Harrold Decl.”), Ex. E. \n6 This authority of the Surgeon General has been transferred to HHS and delegated to the CDC.  \nSee 85 Fed. Reg. 16,559, 16,560 n.1 (explaining reorganizations and transfers of authority). \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 17 of 44\n \nfine of not more than $1,000 or . . . imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.”  Id. \n§ 271(a).  Deportation is not an available penalty.  See id. \nShortly after the President’s announcement, the CDC published an interim final rule \nproviding that the CDC may prohibit the “introduction into the United States of persons” from \nforeign countries.  85 Fed. Reg. 16,559, 16,563; see 42 C.F.R. § 71.40(a).  Pursuant to this new \nregulation, the CDC issued an Order to forcibly return asylum seekers back to the country from \nwhich they entered, their home country, or another location.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 17,060, 17,067.  \nThe initial March 20 Order, which was set to expire in 30 days, was extended for an additional \n30 days on April 20, 85 Fed. Reg. 22,424, and then extended indefinitely on May 20, 85 Fed. \nReg. 31,503. \nOn April 2, 2020, CBP issued a memorandum describing the agency’s implementation of \nthe Title 42 Process, an effort it calls “Operation Capio.”  See CBP Memo, Harrold Decl., Ex. E.  \nThe CBP Memo clarifies that the only humanitarian protection provided under the Title 42 \nProcess is limited to an inadequate CAT screening, and does not include screenings for \npersecution.  CBP Memo at 4.  The CAT screenings, moreover, are not conducted by \nimmigration judges, and lawyers report that even these limited CAT screenings are not uniformly \nundertaken, and when they are, they lack the most rudimentary procedural safeguards.  See \nDeclaration of Linda Corchado (“Corchado Decl.”), ¶¶ 13-14; Declaration of Lisa Frydman \n(“Frydman Decl.”), ¶¶ 32; Declaration of Taylor Levy (“Levy Decl.”), ¶ 6 \nCBP Chief Operating Officer Mark Morgan testified on June 25, 2020, that over two \nthousand unaccompanied children had been summarily deported under the Title 42 as of that \ndate.  See Hearing on CBP Oversight Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs 1:10:09 (June 25, 2020), https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/cbp-oversight-\n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 18 of 44\n \nexamining-the-evolving-challenges-facing-the-agency.  Unaccompanied children subject to the \nTitle 42 Process regularly spend multiple days in hotels or CBP facilities while waiting for \ndeportation flights.  See Interim Report on the Use of Temporary Housing for Minors and \nFamilies Under Title 42 by Independent Monitor, ECF No. 873 at 8, Flores v. Barr, No. 85-cv-\n04544 (C.D. Cal July 22, 2020) [hereinafter “Monitor Report”], Harrold Decl., Ex. H; see id. at \n11 (describing an average of 4 to 5 days, and one child held in a hotel for 11 days).  These \ndetention locations are not made public. Frydman Decl., ¶ 31; Corchado Decl., ¶¶ 5-8; Levy \nDecl., ¶ 5.  While children are sometimes allowed to call parents or other relatives, DHS officers \nare usually on the line during those calls, and often prevent the children from disclosing any \ninformation concerning their locations.  Levy Decl., ¶ 5; Corchado Decl., ¶¶ 7, 10.   \nDefendants’ court filings, news reports, and Congressional testimony state that \nDefendants test all or “virtually all” children in its care for COVID-19 before expulsion, often as \na condition of their expulsion agreements with the receiving countries.  See Dara Lind & Lomi \nKriel, ICE Is Making Sure Migrant Kids Don’t Have COVID-19—Then Expelling Them to \n‘Prevent the Spread’ of COVID-19, ProPublica (Aug. 10, 2020), Harrold Decl., Ex. G.7  If the \nchild tests positive for COVID-19, the child is quarantined in the United States; only if the child \ntests negative is he or she expelled under Title 42.  Id. \nIn short, the government has implemented this Title 42 process as an alternative \nimmigration system, ignoring the various protections for vulnerable noncitizens, including \nunaccompanied minors, and deporting people with no hearings, purportedly under its Title 42 \nauthority rather than the immigration system established under Title 8 of the U.S. Code. \n                                                           \n7 Available at https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-is-making-sure-migrant-kids-dont-have-\ncovid-19-then-expelling-them-to-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19 \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 19 of 44\n \nE.  The Proposed Class \nPlaintiff P.J.E.S. seeks provisional class certification and a preliminary injunction on \nbehalf of a proposed class of unaccompanied children subjected to the unlawful Title 42 Process, \ndefined as: \nAll unaccompanied immigrant children who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. \ngovernment custody in the United States, and (2) are or will be subjected to the \nTitle 42 Process.   \n \nSee ECF No. 2-1 (Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Class Certification).  There are \nhundreds of unaccompanied children subjected to the Title 42 Process every month.  See id.  \nPlaintiff’s counsel here, and immigration lawyers who work with unaccompanied children, have \ncollectively advocated for dozens of unaccompanied children facing expulsion under Title 42, \nbut those dozens comprise only a small fraction of the total number of unaccompanied children \nexpelled every month without contacting any lawyers or advocates.  See Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-\n2, ¶¶ 2-12 & Exs. A-C. \nP.J.E.S.’s story is emblematic of other proposed class members’ experiences.  P.J.E.S. is \na 16-year-old boy from Guatemala.  He comes from an indigenous Mayan family.  He and his \nfamily members faced death threats for his father’s political opinions.  P.J.E.S. also was \nthreatened by gang members after he refused to join them.  He was ultimately forced to flee \npersecution and possibly death.  P.J.E.S. journeyed to the United States to seek safety and to \nreunite with his father, who previously fled Guatemala and currently resides in the United States.  \nSee Complaint, ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 77-81; Declaration of Mario Escobar Francisco (“Escobar \nFrancisco Decl.”), ¶¶ 2-11. \nOn or around August 11, 2020, P.J.E.S entered the United States.  CBP apprehended him \nand took him to a CBP facility in McAllen, Texas.  At the time the Complaint and Class \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 20 of 44\n \nCertification Motion were filed in this case, P.J.E.S. was subject to the Title 42 Process and \nfaced imminent expulsion back to Guatemala.  Stefaniak Decl., ECF No. 2-4, ¶¶ 1-3; Escobar \nFrancisco Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.  After Plaintiff filed this lawsuit and his counsel met and conferred \nwith government counsel, Defendants voluntarily agreed to take him out of the Title 42 Process \nand transfer him to ORR custody.  Escobar Francisco Decl., ¶ 11.   \n  The Proposed Class Members are often fleeing circumstances of extreme danger and \nharm in their home countries.  Many unaccompanied children come from El Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Honduras, where the danger to children is well-documented.  Frydman Decl., ¶¶ \n5-20.  Many are also eligible for various forms of humanitarian relief in the United States, which \nthe Title 42 Process stops them from seeking. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nOn a motion for a preliminary injunction, a court must consider “whether (1) the plaintiff \nhas a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the plaintiff would suffer irreparable \ninjury were an injunction not granted; (3) an injunction would substantially injure other \ninterested parties; and (4) the grant of an injunction would further the public interest.”  Sottera, \nInc. v. FDA, 627 F.3d 891, 893 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nThe first two prongs of the inquiry (likelihood of success and irreparable harm) are the “most \ncritical.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  Where, as here, a plaintiff seeks \npreliminary relief on behalf of a proposed class, the Court may grant provisional certification of \nthe class and issue classwide relief.  See, e.g., J.D., 925 F.3d at 1305-06 (observing that district \ncourt had resolved pending motions for class certification and classwide preliminary injunction \nin tandem); Damus, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 328-35 (certifying class of detained asylum seekers for \npurpose of granting preliminary injunction). \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 21 of 44\n \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE CLASS IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS. \nThe proposed class of unaccompanied children are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nchallenge to the government’s unprecedented process of subjecting them to rapid expulsion \nunder the supposed authority of 42 U.S.C. § 265.  As explained below, § 265 does not authorize \ndeportation at all.  But even if such deportations were permitted, unaccompanied children are \nentitled to explicit statutory procedures and protections.  Those specific, later-enacted statutes \ncontrol over whatever § 265 may authorize in general.  Moreover, subjecting Class Members to \nthe Title 42 Process is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”). \nThe only court to have considered these claims thus far recently held the plaintiff in that \ncase had demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits.  Specifically, Judge Nichols held in \nan oral ruling that: \nIn my view, the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the question of whether 42 U.S.C. \n265 grants the director of the CDC the power the government articulates here for \nthree related reasons.  The first is that the statute authorizes the director of the CDC \nto prohibit the introduction of persons and property by its plain terms.  There’s a \nserious question about whether that power includes the power also to remove or \nexclude persons who are already present in the United States.  There are other \nprovisions, obviously, in the immigration statutes that reference the power to return \nor to remove.  The fact that Congress did not use those terms here, I think, is – \nsuggests at a minimum that the power to remove is not granted by section 265. \n \nEven  if  the  power  to  remove  were  read  [into]  section  265,  the  plaintiff  has \nlikelihood  of  success  because  the  provision,  in  the  Court’s  view,  should  be \nharmonized, to the maximum extent possible, with immigration statutes, including \nthose already referenced that grant special protections to minors and also those \nimmigration statutes that deal with communicable diseases and quarantines. \n \n. . . The Court, in addition, does not believe that the CDC director is likely entitled \nto Chevron deference; whereas, here the provision at issue, 42 U.S. Code 265, needs \nto also be read in light of statutes that the CDC director quite plainly has no special \nexpertise regarding, and also whereas, here the order does very little by way of an \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 22 of 44\n \nanalysis of what exactly the power to prohibit the introduction of persons and \nproperty means. \n \nJ.B.B.C. PI Ruling, Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-2, Ex. D at 49-51. \n \nA.  Section 265 Does Not Authorize Deportations At All.   \n  The Title 42 Process has been created under the purported authority of 42 U.S.C. § 265, a \nprovision that has lain dormant and largely forgotten in the U.S. Code for over a hundred years.  \nDefendants claim to have discovered in this statute a source of unlimited authority to execute \nsummary deportations as they see fit, without regard for the carefully crafted policy judgments of \nthe Nation’s immigration laws.  But when an agency claims to discover “an unheralded power” \nlying dormant “in a long-extant statute,” courts “typically greet its announcement with a measure \nof skepticism.”  Util. Air Reg. Grp v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014).  And, indeed, this novel, \nsweeping assertion of Executive dominance in the realm of immigration exceeds the power \ngranted by § 265.  Nothing in § 265, or Title 42 more generally, purports to authorize any \ndeportations (much less deportations in violation of the specific protections described below, \ninfra Section I.B). \n1.  The text, context, and structure of § 265 demonstrate that it does not \nauthorize deportations. \n \nSection 265 authorizes the CDC to prohibit the “introduction of persons” under certain \ncircumstances.  It says nothing about any power to physically remove people from the United \nStates.  Nor does a neighboring provision laying out the “penalties” for violation of “any \nregulation prescribed” under § 265 make any mention of such expulsion authority.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 271.  Instead, § 271 provides for fines and imprisonment of individuals for violation of \npublic health regulations.  Nowhere in Title 42 does any statute mention the newly asserted \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 23 of 44\n \npower to deport, in the name of public health, independent of Congress’s carefully reticulated \nimmigration scheme.   \nThat silence speaks volumes.  The Supreme Court has “long recognized that deportation \nis a particularly severe ‘penalty.’”  Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 365 (2010) (quoting Fong \nYue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 740 (1893)).  Thus, the extreme exercise of \ngovernmental power involved in physically removing a person from the country is one that must \nbe granted by Congress, as “the Constitution creates no executive prerogative to dispose of the \nliberty of the individual.”  Valentine v. U.S. ex rel. Neidecker, 299 U.S. 5, 9 (1936) (holding that \nextradition power “does not exist save as it is given by act of Congress” or a treaty).   \nSuch powers of physical removal from the country—whether called deportation, removal, \nextradition, or expulsion—“must be affirmatively granted” by Congress.  Id. at 12 (emphasis \nadded) (rejecting argument that power to extradite U.S. citizens could be implied from provision \nstating that United States was not bound to extradite them).  Accordingly, where Congress seeks \nto authorize that extraordinary physical control, it does so in explicit terms.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231 (immigration removals); id. § 1225(b)(2)(c) (“may return the alien” to contiguous \ncountry); 18 U.S.C. §§ 3185, 3186, 3196 (extradition authority).  Courts do not—and, given the \ngravity of the asserted power, must not—lightly read an expulsion power into statutes that do not \nexplicitly grant it.  Valentine, 299 U.S. at 12; cf. Util. Air Reg. Grp., 573 U.S. at 324 (“We expect \nCongress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and \npolitical significance.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nowhere in Title 42 has Congress \ngranted that power. \nThat is not to say that Congress has ignored public health considerations in crafting \nimmigration policy.  To the contrary, from the earliest days of immigration regulation—\n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 24 of 44\n \npredating the 1893 enactment of the predecessor to § 265—Congress has explicitly authorized \nthe deportation of individuals based on public health concerns.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, \n26 Stat. 1084, 1085.  And similar statutes exist today.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1) (“[h]ealth-\nrelated grounds” of inadmissibility, including communicable diseases); 8 U.S.C. § 1222 (medical \ndetention and examination as part of immigration processing).  Because courts “presume \ndifferences in language like this convey differences in meaning[,]” particularly where \ncontemporaneous statutes address related issues, Congress’s decision to grant deportation power \nin the immigration statutes but not in Title 42 is conclusive.  See Wisc. Cent. Ltd. v. United \nStates, 138 S. Ct. 2067, 2071-72 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nCritically, § 265, the provision on which Defendants rely for their new power, could not \nbe read to authorize expulsions because that section refers only to “persons,” and in no way \ndifferentiates between citizens and noncitizens.  If the government is correct that § 265 \nauthorizes expulsions, it would therefore mean that Congress gave the executive branch the \npower to expel U.S. citizens as well as noncitizens.  See Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 \n(2005) (rejecting “the dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases” even if only some applications raise constitutional concerns).  It is \ninconceivable that Congress would seek to give the executive branch that (plainly \nunconstitutional) power, must less that it would do so without any explicit statutory language.8 \n                                                           \n8 Moreover, nothing in the text of § 265 would limit Defendants’ claim of an implied \nenforcement regime to deportation.  In theory, the government could assert an implied power for \neven more extreme measures.  See Merck & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 962 \nF.3d 531, 540 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (rejecting agency’s “construction of the statute [which] would \nseem to give it unbridled power”). \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 25 of 44\n \n2.  Section 265 Was Designed To Regulate Transportation. \n \nThe omission of deportation authority from § 265 was no mistake.  To the contrary, it \nreflects Congress’s design of that statute—as a means to stop travel from countries experiencing \nan outbreak of disease by regulating the transportation companies that bring people to the United \nStates.  Section 7 of the Act of February 15, 1893, ch. 114, 27 Stat. 449, 452, which became \n§ 265 without material change in the Public Health Service Act, Pub. L. 78-410, § 362, 58 Stat. \n682, 704 (1944), was designed to regulate transportation entities that brought persons and goods \nto the United States, and it imposed fines and imprisonment on such transportation entities if \nthey violated a public health order.  See also Harrold Decl., Ex. A (copy of 1893 Act).  If an \nindividual’s entry or presence was unlawful, the immigration system provided the sole \nmechanism for returning the individual to his home country.  Past practice bears out this design: \nWhen § 265 was used in 1929 to combat meningitis, another deadly disease transmitted by \nasymptomatic carriers via airborne respiratory droplets, deportation was not authorized.  It \ntherefore makes sense that § 265 does not silently authorize a whole new deportation process, \ndevoid of the procedural protections Congress created for noncitizens, including for those with \ncommunicable diseases.  Defendants cannot now create such an unauthorized system out of \nwhole cloth.  See Merck, 962 F.3d at 536 (agencies are “bound” by Congress’s choice of \n“means”). \na.  The text of the 1893 provision demonstrates that the “means” Congress chose was the \nregulation of transportation, not of individual travelers, and underscores that Congress never \nauthorized deportations.  Section 7 of the 1893 Act granted the “power to prohibit, in whole or in \npart, the introduction of persons and property” into the country.  27 Stat. 452 (emphasis added).  \nThat term—“introduction”—meant then, as now, “‘the act of bringing into a country.’”  \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 26 of 44\n \nIntroduce, Universal English Dictionary 1067 (John Craig ed. 1861)); see also Introduce, \nWebster’s Collegiate Dictionary 453 (1st ed. 1898) (“[t]o lead, bring, or usher in”).  As a matter \nof ordinary language and usage, introducing a person into a country or place is an action taken by \na third party—here, the shipping company.  See, e.g., Walsh v. Preston, 109 U.S. 297, 298, 314, \n315 (1883) (“colonization” contract requiring party to “introduce” immigrant families into Texas \nwas unsatisfied, where there was no evidence individuals who came “were brought to Texas by \n[the party];” rather, “they came and settled of their own accord”).  The plain text of § 265 is thus \ndirected not at individuals seeking to come to the United States, but rather those proposing to \nbring such individuals here.  \nb.  The statutory context reinforces the plain text.  The 1893 Act was shot through with \nprovisions specifically directed at the regulation of ships.  See Act of Feb. 15, 1893, ch. 114, § 1 \n(unlawful for ships to enter U.S. ports from abroad except in accordance with public health \nregulations); § 2 (requiring ships abroad to obtain a bill of health); § 3 (authorizing, inter alia, \nregulation of “vessels sail[ing] from any foreign port or place”); § 4 (charging the Surgeon \nGeneral with, inter alia, obtaining sanitary information about foreign ports); § 5 (issuance of \nregulations for, inter alia, “vessels in foreign ports,” and prohibition on vessels arriving without \na bill of health); § 6 (providing for “an infected vessel” to be “remand[ed]” to quarantine \nstation).   \nCritically, the 1893 Act imposed penalties only against ships—and set them high enough \nto deter those vessels from sailing to this country in violation of the Act.  See id. § 1 ($5000.00 \nfine for “vessel” violating the Act); id. § 2 (same for “vessel” entering United States without bill \nof health); see also id. § 3 (conditioning penalties on “any vessel or owner or officer thereof” on \nposting of regulations in consular offices abroad); 24 Cong. Rec. 378 (raising penalties). \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 27 of 44\n \nFurthermore, an examination of immigration statutes in force in 1893 makes plain that \nCongress knew exactly how to provide for the removal of individuals.  Those statutes covered \nthose coming by ship and individually by land, and explicitly authorized deportations, separate \nand apart from regulations they imposed on ships involved in transporting immigrants.  See, e.g., \nChinese Exclusion Act of May 6, 1882, ch. 126, §§ 2, 12, 22 Stat. 58, 59, 61 (establishing \npenalties for vessels, and separately providing for unauthorized immigrants “to be removed . . . \nto the country whence [they] came”); Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, §§ 10, 11, 26 Stat. 1084, \n1086 (establishing penalties for “master, agent, consignee, or owner of” a “vessel” who violates \nthe Act’s provisions, and separately providing for unauthorized immigrants to “be immediately \nsent back on the vessel by which they were brought in” and that “any alien who shall come into \nthe United States in violation of law may be returned”); id. § 8 (providing “the Secretary of the \nTreasury may prescribe rules for inspection along the borders of Canada, British Columbia, and \nMexico”); Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §§ 8, 9, 19, 20, 21, 32 Stat. 1213 1215-16, 1218-19, \n1221 (providing for noncitizens to “be immediately sent back . . . on the vessels bringing them,” \n“deported,” or “taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came”). \nIt would have been “easy enough for Congress” to include the same kind of provisions in \nthe 1893 Act.  Nasrallah v. Barr, 140 S. Ct. 1683, 1692 (2020).  Instead, Congress imposed \npenalties only on those involved in transportation, and used the term “introduction” to refer to the \npenalty-triggering conduct of such third parties.  But Congress said nothing about any power to \ndeport individuals who came to our shores.  The government nevertheless now seeks to read into \nthe statute’s silence and implicit power to expel; but “it is not the proper role of the courts to \nrewrite [a law] passed by Congress and signed by the President.”  Id.  \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 28 of 44\n \n  c.  The legislative history of the 1893 Act further confirms what is demonstrated by the \ntext, context, and structure: Section 7 was a regulation of transportation entities. \n  The 1893 Act responded to a specific public health threat—a cholera epidemic in Europe.  \nSee, e.g., 24 Cong. Rec. 359 (1893) (letter from physician explaining the “considerable” danger \nof an imminent cholera outbreak from Europe).  A principal proponent of the 1893 Act, Senator \nChandler, explained that “90 or 95 percent of the immigration into the United States comes into \nthe city of New York, and that the most danger of cholera is to be apprehended from vessels \narriving at that port.”  Id. at 360.  He expressed confidence that controlling travel by ship would \neffectively protect the country.  Id. at 363 (“there will be no great danger of the introduction of \ncholera this year unless it comes in the steerages,” a class of ship travel). \n  As one of the 1893 Act’s sponsors, Senator Harris, further explained, Section 7 \ntherefore allowed the President “to prevent the coming at all” of “vessels, passengers, crews, and \ncargo, which are sailing to this country.”  Id. at 392.  Congress expected that an invocation of \nSection 7 would cause shipping companies to refuse boarding, halting travel from designated \nlocations at the source, thereby addressing the public health risk.   \nIndeed, when Senator Harris was asked about individuals crossing at land borders, he \nexplained that an earlier Act providing general authority to quarantine and inspect individuals—\nnot the new 1893 legislation—“clothes the Marine Hospital Service with ample power to protect \nthe Mexican and Canadian borders.”  Id. at 370.  The new authority to regulate transportation \nentities was simply part of the larger framework already in place that included not just the \nimmigration laws but also the public health quarantine powers. \nd.  The use of the statute since its enactment in 1893 reinforces the absence of any \ndeportation power.  To Plaintiff’s knowledge, the only time the statute has been invoked to \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 29 of 44\n \nprohibit the introduction of persons was in 1929, and it did not authorize deportations.9  \nPresident Hoover issued an Executive Order invoking Section 7 of the 1893 Act to restrict the \n“Transportation of Passengers” from China and the Philippines because of a meningitis outbreak.  \nExec. Order No. 5143 (June 21, 1929), Harrold Decl., Ex. B.  The Order provided that “no \npersons may be introduced directly or indirectly, by transshipment or otherwise into the United \nStates” except as permitted by the Treasury Secretary.  The use of passive voice—“may be \nintroduced”—makes clear that the Order was directed to third parties, namely transportation \ncompanies.  The Treasury Department also issued associated regulations “governing the \nembarkation of passengers and crew” at ports in those countries “and their transportation to \nUnited States ports.”10  The regulations further addressed how to handle vessels which arrived in \nthe United States when a meningitis case had occurred during the voyage, but, notably, only \nauthorized detention, quarantine, and testing—not deportation. \ne.  Finally, any suggestion that the correct interpretation of § 265 renders that statute \nineffective would be seriously mistaken.  Congress vested the government with a significant \npower totally separate from any need to deport individuals from the country: shutting down all \n                                                           \n9 Most invocations of § 265 have involved regulation of goods or delegation of authority to \nparticular officers or agencies.  In addition to the 1929 use of § 265, the provision has been \ninvoked, with additional statutory authorities, four other times to address persons.  None of the \nfour purported to authorize deportations.  One addressed the Do Not Board list, a mechanism to \ncontrol transportation access, and the Public Health Lookout, a means to refer individuals at \nports to CDC for isolation.  Criteria for Requesting Federal Travel Restrictions for Public Health \nPurposes, 80 Fed. Reg. 16,400 (Mar. 27, 2015).  Another proposed, but unadopted, regulation \nrepeated the language of § 265 without elaboration.  Control of Communicable Diseases, 70 Fed. \nReg. 71,891, 71,910 (Nov. 30, 2005).  The two others addressed quarantine and information \ngathering.  Control of Communicable Diseases, 81 Fed. Reg. 54230 (Aug. 15, 2016); Control of \nCommunicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine, 85 Fed. Reg. 7874 (Feb. 12, 2020).    \n10 Regulations Governing the Embarkation of Passengers and Crew at Ports in China and the \nPhilippine Islands and Their Transportation to the United States Ports Prescribed in Accordance \nwith Executive Order Approved June 21, 1929, Harrold Decl., Ex.

And, despite the age of the statute, that tool remains \npowerful today: § 265 permits the government to halt the vast majority of international travel by \nbarring ships, planes, trains, and other modes of transportation from bringing people from \ndesignated places to this country.  \nThe efficacy of that approach was clear from the beginning.  The statute was passed \nagainst the backdrop of an extraordinary Executive action taken just months before, in \nSeptember 1892.  See U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, Quarantine Restrictions Upon Immigration to Aid \nin the Prevention of the Introduction of Cholera into the United States (Sept. 1, 1892), Harrold \nDecl., Ex. D.  The Surgeon General explained that “vessels conveying” immigrants from certain \ncountries experiencing cholera outbreaks were a “direct menace to the public health,” and \nordered that “no vessel from any foreign port carrying immigrants shall be admitted” to any U.S. \nport “until said vessel shall have undergone” 20 days of quarantine.  Id.  Contemporaneous \nmedia coverage explained this step would “practically put a stop to immigration, for no \nsteamship company will continue to transport people to this country” given the costs of \nquarantine.  Twenty Days Quarantine, N.Y Times (Sept. 2, 1892).11  The crisis triggered \nsignificant debate among the Cabinet as to the President’s authority to take such a drastic step \nwithout clear statutory authority.  See id.  Shortly afterward, Congress enacted the 1893 Act \ngranting the authority to regulate vessels to prevent the spread of disease. \nThus, while Congress’s goal was to keep out disease, the means it authorized was \nregulation of transportation entities, not the deportation of individuals outside of the extensive \n                                                           \n11 https://www.nytimes.com/1892/09/02/archives/twenty-days-quarantine-the-government-takes-\ndecisive-action-a.html \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 31 of 44\n \nimmigration system Congress has enacted and refined over the decades.  Merck, 962 F.3d at 536 \n(“[A]gencies are bound, not only by the ultimate purposes Congress has selected, but by the \nmeans it has deemed appropriate, and prescribed, for the pursuit of those purposes.”) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  “The withholding of agency authority is as significant as the granting \nof it, and we have no right to play favorites between the two.”  Dir., Office of Workers’ Comp. \nPrograms, Dep’t of Labor v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 136 \n(1995); see also A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 \n(2012) (“[A]n absent provision cannot be supplied by the courts.”).   \n*  *  * \nIn sum, § 265 authorizes no deportations at all.  Rather, it provides authority to halt \ntransportation companies from introducing people from countries suffering an epidemic to the \nUnited States, by, for example, ship, train, and, in modern times, aircraft.   \nB.  Section 265 Does Not Override the Immigration Laws’ Protections for \nUnaccompanied Children. \n \nEven if § 265 did authorize deportation in general, the specific protections Congress \nenacted for unaccompanied children and those fleeing persecution prohibit the deportation of \nmembers of the putative class.  Congress has carefully and repeatedly enacted special safeguards \nfor unaccompanied children and persons fleeing persecution.  These statutes contain specific \nexceptions from their coverage, but no exception for communicable diseases or public health \ncrises.  Section 265 must be read in conjunction with the specific protections for those groups. \n1. Congress has carefully and repeatedly worked to ensure that unaccompanied children \nlike the Class Members are afforded unique, mandatory, and protective procedures when they \nface deportation.  See Background, Part I.  Defendants have jettisoned that entire statutory \nscheme. \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 32 of 44\n \nCongress included provisions in the HSA to “ensur[e] that the interests of the child are \nconsidered in decisions and actions relating to the care and custody of an unaccompanied alien \nchild,” 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(B), vesting responsibility for the care of unaccompanied children, \nincluding the provision of housing and access to legal services to pursue claims for immigration \nrelief, in an agency—ORR—that had demonstrated experience working with vulnerable \nimmigrants and refugees, id. § 279(a).  Congress subsequently strengthened those protections in \nthe TVPRA by providing for important procedural safeguards before they could be removed.  \nSee Background, Part A.   \nThus, Congress prescribed a careful and comprehensive set of directions to federal \nagencies for how unaccompanied children should be processed and cared for upon their \napprehension.  Among other protections, Congress required federal agencies to expeditiously \ntransfer children from noncontiguous countries, and children from contiguous countries after an \ninitial screening, to ORR custody.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(4), 1232(b)(3).  It then required ORR to \nprovide safe and secure placements for all children in its care, and to facilitate their release to \nsponsors.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)-(3).  It prevented DHS from removing such children through \nfast-track processes applicable to adults, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(A), id. § 1232(a)(5)(D)(ii), and \nguaranteed their access to counsel, id. § 1232(c)(5).  Through these provisions, Congress sought \nto satisfy its domestic and international obligations to protect a uniquely vulnerable set of \nchildren, who have claims for various forms of humanitarian protection.  Indeed, the legislative \nhistory of the TVPRA is replete with statements describing this country’s “special obligation to \nensure that [unaccompanied] children are treated humanely and fairly.”  154 Cong. Rec. S10886-\n01, S1086, 2008 WL 5169970 (Dec. 10, 2008); see also 153 Cong. Rec. H14098-01, H14118 \n(Dec. 4, 2007) (discussing statute’s purpose of “provid[ing] critical immigration mechanisms to \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 33 of 44\n \nprotect children”).  Through their creation of an alternative immigration system, Defendants have \ncircumvented the carefully-drawn scheme Congress set forth for the treatment and care of \nunaccompanied children.   \nUnaccompanied children also have a right to seek protection from persecution and \ntorture, as Congress has long prescribed.  As explained above, children—like others seeking \nprotection—are entitled to seek asylum, withholding, and CAT protection.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1158(a)(1), 1231(b)(3), 1231 Note.  And Congress has taken steps to specially safeguard \nunaccompanied children’s access to humanitarian protection, exempting them from various \nlimitations on asylum and providing them with access to a special non-adversarial proceeding.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(a)(2)(E), 1158(b)(3)(C).   \nIn short, Congress carefully crafted the statutory provisions governing asylum, \nwithholding, and CAT protection to ensure that noncitizens within our country or at the border \ncould seek relief from persecution.  In so doing, Congress sought to satisfy its domestic and \ninternational obligations to protect those fleeing persecution and torture.  And, critically, \nCongress enshrined procedural access to these forms of protection before a person—particularly \nan unaccompanied child—can be deported from the country.  The Title 42 Process jettisons all \nthose protections and safeguards, subjecting these children to summary deportation back to \npersecution and torture.12 \n                                                           \n12 The only humanitarian protection provided under the Title 42 Process is limited to CAT, and is \ntotally inadequate—especially for unrepresented unaccompanied children.  Noncitizens are only \nreferred for a CAT screening if they “make an affirmative, spontaneous and reasonably \nbelievable claim that they fear being tortured in the country they are being sent back to.”  CBP \nMemo 4 (emphasis added).  This means that children must know precisely what to say when they \narrive in the U.S., and may be summarily returned to the countries they fled without the \ngovernment ever even asking whether they would face torture in that country.   \n \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 34 of 44\n \n2. The government has refused to provide these statutory protections to unaccompanied \nchildren subject to the Title 42 Process because, in its view, the powers granted by § 265 render \nthe entire set of legislation regarding immigration irrelevant.  But whatever Title 42 authorizes in \ngeneral, it cannot override the provisions of the immigration laws designed to ensure protection \nfor unaccompanied minors and those seeking protection, even where such individuals are \nsuspected of having a communicable disease.   \nSuch an interpretation would violate numerous canons of statutory construction.  As with \nall potential conflicts, the Court must read § 265 and the child protection and refugee statutes \ntogether, to make sense of all Congress’s work without discarding any of it.  See FDA v. Brown \n& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 143 (2000) (“The classic judicial task of reconciling \nmany laws enacted over time, and getting them to make sense in combination, necessarily \nassumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute.”) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, as Judge Bybee explained in another asylum case, “the \nPresident may not ‘override particular provisions of the INA’ through the power granted him in” \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), despite the breadth of language in that emergency provision.  East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 760 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Trump v. Hawaii, 138 \nS. Ct. 2392, 2411 (2018)).   \n                                                           \nUnsurprisingly, this screening offers essentially no protection: As of May 27, 2020, out \nof thousands of expulsions under Title 42, Defendants reportedly conducted a mere 85 screening \ninterviews for CAT, of which only four applicants passed the screening stage.  Camilo Montoya-\nGalvez, As Trump pushes to reopen, U.S. continues expelling migrants at border, citing \npandemic, CBS News (June 1, 2020), https://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-trump-pushes-to-\nreopen-u-s-officials-continue-border-expulsion-policy-citing-pandemic.  Advocates working \nwith unaccompanied children report that children typically do not receive CAT assessments until \na lawyer intervenes; until then, the child may not even be aware that such an assessment is \navailable.  See Corchado Decl., ¶¶ 13-14; Frydman Decl., ¶ 32; Levy Decl., ¶ 6.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 35 of 44\n \nSo too with § 265.  As Judge Nichols explained in finding a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of this claim, § 265 “should be harmonized, to the maximum extent possible, with \nimmigration statutes, including those . . . that grant special protections to minors and also those \nimmigration statutes that deal with communicable diseases and quarantines.”  J.B.B.C. PI Ruling, \nKang Decl., Ex. D at 50.  Even if § 265 could be read to authorize some summary deportations \n(which it cannot), it must be read to accommodate Congress’s subsequent specific legislative \ncommands.  See Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc. v. Hawke, 211 F.3d 638, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2000) \n(“A broad statute when passed ‘may have a range of plausible meanings,’ but subsequent acts \ncan narrow those meanings . . . .”) (quoting Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 143).   \nMoreover, the specific should be read to control over the general.  See, e.g., Air All. \nHouston v. EPA, 906 F.3d 1049, 1061 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (“[A]n agency may not circumvent \nspecific statutory limits on its actions by relying on separate, general rulemaking authority.”).  \nThe TVPRA embodies Congress’s focus on a particularly vulnerable group of noncitizens \nseeking safety in this country.  It is “a precisely drawn, detailed statute,” Brown v. GSA, 425 U.S. \n820, 834 (1976), that comprehensively delineates what the government must do before it seeks to \nremove an unaccompanied child.  By contrast, § 265 says nothing at all about removal; or children; \nor steps the government must take or may skip.  The general terms of § 265 cannot be construed to \nbypass the specific provisions of the TVPRA.  See Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. \n148, 159 n.2 (1976) (explaining that “the more specific legislation will usually take precedence \nover the more general”); cf. Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 443 (1998) (holding \nCongress may not give the President “the power to cancel portions of a duly enacted statute”).  \nThis interpretive principle has particular force where the more specific statute is the later-enacted \none; that is the case here, as all the child protective and refugee statutes postdate § 265.  See \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 36 of 44\n \nUnited States v. Juvenile Male, 670 F.3d 999, 1008 (9th Cir. 2012) (explaining that “[w]here two \nstatutes conflict, the later-enacted, more specific provision generally governs”).  Recent \nCongresses have spoken clearly and explicitly regarding the required treatment of \nunaccompanied minors; the Executive is not at liberty to ignore those commands. \n*  *  * \n  For decades, Congress—fully aware that exigent circumstances might emerge—has \nenacted and reinforced unique protections for vulnerable children and asylum seekers, including \nthose with communicable diseases, subject to narrow exceptions not applicable here.  Congress \nhas, moreover, specifically chosen not to erase those protections even for those with diseases, \nrelying instead on quarantine as the proper way to balance health concerns and the safety of \nchildren and those fleeing danger.  To permit Defendants to obliterate those protections would \n“contradict Congress’ clear intent as expressed in its more recent, [child and asylum seeker] \nspecific legislation.”  Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 143.  If there is to be a public health \nexception to those critical protections, Congress must be the Branch to enact it. \nC.  Defendants’ Actions Are Arbitrary and Capricious.   \n \nDefendants’ application of the Title 42 Process to unaccompanied children is also \narbitrary and capricious for failure to “engage in ‘reasoned decisionmaking’” as the APA \nrequires.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1905 \n(2020) (quoting Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015)).  Specifically, Defendants have \nprovided no reasoned explanation for their actions.  Nowhere do any of the documents setting \nforth the Title 42 Process offer any reasoned explanation for applying the Process to \nunaccompanied children, including those fleeing abuse, persecution, and torture.  “An agency \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 37 of 44\n \naction that lacks explanation is a textbook example of arbitrary and capricious action.”  Mori v. \nDep’t of the Navy, 917 F. Supp. 2d 60, 64 (D.D.C. 2013).   \nThis new deportation system represents an extraordinary break from prior agency policy \nand practice with regard to unaccompanied children.  Defendants have long recognized their \nmandatory obligations under the TVPRA to transfer unaccompanied minors into ORR custody \nand refer them to full removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.  As the D.C. Circuit recently \nreiterated, “reasoned decision-making requires that when departing from precedents or practices, \nan agency must offer a reason to distinguish them or explain its apparent rejection of their \napproach.”  Grace v. Barr, 965 F.3d 883, 900 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and \nalterations omitted).  But the CDC Orders and the promulgated regulations do not even \nacknowledge that the Process will be applied to unaccompanied children, much less justify the \ndecision to begin summarily removing such children.  Nor do the Orders or regulations anywhere \n“grapple with how the new policy affected . . . [Defendants’] statutory mandate” to protect \nunaccompanied children.  Id. at 901 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “An \nagency may not . . . depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still \non the books.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). \nRelatedly, Defendants have “entirely failed to consider . . . important aspect[s] of the \nproblem.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n43 (1983).  In the Orders and regulations, Defendants are silent on the Process’s impact on \nunaccompanied children and those seeking protection.  CDC’s reasoning does not address that it \nis keeping children from seeking protection and is returning them to danger, contrary to the \nTVPRA and protection statutes.  Nat’l Lifeline Ass’n v. FCC, 921 F.3d 1102, 1112-13 (D.C. Cir. \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 38 of 44\n \n2019) (finding action arbitrary and capricious where it “failed to address the problem that would \nbe created as a result” of its conduct).   \nPublicly-available information concerning Defendants’ implementation of the Title 42 \nProcess underscores its irrationality.  For one, DHS selectively exempts certain noncitizens from \nthe Title 42 Process when it chooses, without any public health-related justification for those \nexemptions.  CBP’s Implementation Memo states that individuals with certain criminal histories \nmust be removed from the Title 42 Process and placed into the ordinary immigration and \ncriminal system.  See CBP Memo at 3 (exempting those with certain criminal convictions as \n“[s]ubjects not amenable to being expelled”).  Defendants cannot claim that having a prior \nconviction makes one less likely to transmit COVID-19, yet they choose to detain such \nindividuals in ICE custody (presumably for lengthy periods), rather than expel them.  Yet they \nrefuse to exempt unaccompanied children.  Moreover, public reports show that Defendants are \ntesting every unaccompanied child for COVID-19 prior to expulsion, because their deportation \nagreements with receiving countries forbid them from expelling children who are positive for \nCOVID-19.  Harrold Decl., Ex. G (ProPublica article).  It is irrational to ban children from this \ncountry because of COVID-19, but expel only those children who are free of infection.13  \nII.  SUBJECTING UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN TO THE TITLE 42 PROCESS \nHAS CAUSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE THEM IRREPARABLE \nHARM. \n \nPlaintiff P.J.E.S.’s experiences are emblematic of the experiences of the children in the \nProposed Class.  He is a sixteen-year-old boy of indigenous Mayan ancestry.  His father was \n                                                           \n13 The Title 42 Process is arbitrary and capricious for other reasons as well, including that it \n“runs counter to the evidence before the agency.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  In the interest of \nobtaining interim relief, Plaintiff does not rely on those other reasons in this Motion, but will do \nat later stages of this case, once the administrative record has been produced. \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 39 of 44\n \ntargeted because of his political views, and had to flee Guatemala to escape threats on his life.  \nEscobar Francisco Decl., ¶¶ 2-7.  P.J.E.S. has similarly been targeted for numerous reasons.  Id., \n¶¶ 8-9.  Once he came to the United States, he was detained for several days and was facing \nimminent deportation, before his immigration lawyers and undersigned counsel learned of him.  \nSee Stefaniak Decl., ECF No. 2-4, ¶ 3; Escobar Francisco Decl., ¶ 10.  Only after counsel’s \nintervention did Defendants voluntarily take him out of the Title 42 Process and transfer him to \nORR; he has since begun the process of reunifying with his father in this country.  Otherwise, he \nwould have been sent summarily back to Guatemala without any meaningful opportunity to \nassert his claims for relief, and where he would have faced grave harm from those he sought to \nescape.     \nThe experiences of other immigration lawyers and advocates, confirmed by news reports \nand other public sources, demonstrate that P.J.E.S.’s story is typical.  See Frydman Decl., ¶¶ 26-\n32; Corchado Decl., ¶¶ 5-14; Levy Decl., ¶¶ 3-6; see also Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-2, ¶¶ 2-11 & \nExs. A-C.  Their clients are other unaccompanied children who come to the United States \nseeking protection.  Most, if not all, of them have bona fide claims for humanitarian relief, \nincluding asylum, trafficking-related relief, or visas available to young people who have \nexperienced abuse, abandonment, or neglect at the hands of their parents.  See Frydman Decl., ¶¶ \n5-20; Corchado Decl., ¶¶ 6-13; Levy Decl., ¶ 6; see also Declaration of Chris Palusky (“Palusky \nDecl.”), ¶ 4.  When they come to this country seeking help, children are housed in unknown \nhotels or CBP locations, with strict limits on their access to relatives or counsel.  They are then \ndeported in a matter of days or weeks.  See Monitor Report at 12, Harrold Decl., Ex. H \n(describing lengths of custody for children subject to Title 42); Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-2, ¶¶ 2-\n11 & Exs. A-C. \n30 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 40 of 44\n \nLawyers in the United States sometimes hear of unaccompanied children’s cases only \nafter the child has already been expelled back to danger.  They have been returned to dangerous \ncircumstances, often with limited resources and family support, where they may be unable to \navoid serious harm or even death.  Frydman Decl., ¶¶ 21-25. \nMoreover, many unaccompanied children in the Title 42 Process come from El Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Honduras, which are widely recognized as being among the most dangerous \ncountries in the world, particularly for children.  Frydman Decl., ¶¶ 5-20.  The U.S. Department \nof State has itself acknowledged that extreme gang violence is prevalent in these countries, \nincluding homicide, torture, kidnapping, extortion, or other forms of persecution.  See, e.g., U.S. \nDept’ of State, 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Guatemala at 18, 28, \nhttps://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GUATEMALA-2019-HUMAN-RIGHTS-\nREPORT.pdf (describing that gangs coerce vulnerable children to joining them and exploit \nchildren in sex trafficking).14 \nThese facts more than satisfy the preliminary injunction standard, which requires “only a \nlikelihood of irreparable injury.”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8-9 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (preliminary injunction request).  Numerous courts have held that similar \nshowings suffice to show irreparable injury.  See, e.g., Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, \n146 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds sub nom., Grace v. Barr, 965 \nF.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (finding fear of “domestic violence, beatings, shootings, and death in \n                                                           \n14 See also U.S. Dept’ of State, 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Honduras at \n1-2, https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ HONDURAS-2019-HUMAN-\nRIGHTS-REPORT.pdf (describing extreme gang violence directed at vulnerable populations, \nincluding “acts of homicide, torture, kidnapping, extortion, human trafficking, intimidation, and \nother threats”); U.S. Dept’ of State, 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: El \nSalvador at 1, https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/EL-SALVADOR-2019-\nHUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf (similar).   \n31 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 41 of 44\n \ntheir countries of origin” constitute irreparable injury); Demjanjuk v. Holder, 563 F.3d 565, 565 \n(6th Cir. 2009) (granting stay for noncitizen who asserted removal would violate CAT); Devitri \nv. Cronen, 289 F. Supp. 3d 287, 296–97 (D. Mass. 2018) (risk of persecution if removed is \nirreparable harm); Orantes-Hernandez v. Meese, 685 F. Supp. 1488, 1504–05 (C.D. Cal. 1988) \n(plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if they were summarily removed without being afforded \nopportunity to exercise their right to apply for asylum); see also J.B.B.C. PI Ruling, Kang Decl., \nECF No. 2-2, Ex. D at 51 (Judge Nichols finding that unaccompanied child had shown “he is \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an order” staying his expulsion under Title 42); \nAnd there is “a public interest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed . . . to \ncountries where they are likely to face substantial harm.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 436 \n(2009).  \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF HARMS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST BOTH WEIGH \nDECIDEDLY IN FAVOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR CLASS MEMBERS. \n \nPreventing Defendants from removing unaccompanied children until final disposition of \nthis case would not substantially injure the government for several reasons. \nFirst, unaccompanied children referred to ORR care are typically released to sponsors \nunder the TVPRA, which in most cases will be a parent or close relative who can ensure the \nchild will self-quarantine as needed and will be subject to local health restrictions.  Insofar as \nchildren must spend short periods in ORR’s juvenile facilities before release, that network can \ndeal with communicable diseases.  See Palusky Decl., ¶¶ 5-7; Monitor Report at 19 n.12, Harrold \nDecl., Ex. H.  Moreover, the ORR shelter network is currently operating at a very small fraction \nof its total capacity, meaning that quarantine and social distancing measures are feasible in those \nfacilities.  See Kang Decl., ECF No. 2-2, Ex. B; see also Palusky Decl., ¶¶ 3-5.  And again, \nDefendants apparently have the capacity to test all unaccompanied children in their care prior to \n32 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 42 of 44\n \nexpulsion.  See Harrold Decl., Ex. G (ProPublica article).  If so, there is no reason why they \ncannot do so before sending them to ORR custody, to further minimize the risk of infection in \nORR facilities.   \nSecond, contrary to the CDC Orders’ stated justifications, the Title 42 Process does not \nmake DHS officers safer, and in fact, likely increases any potential exposure.  Under the \nTVPRA, juveniles like Plaintiff must be transferred to ORR or a sponsor within 72 hours, see 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(b)(3)—and can often be transferred much faster.  Yet deporting children under \nTitle 42 generally takes DHS longer than that, due to the need to make travel arrangements and \nobtain any necessary travel permissions.  Monitor Report at 8, Harrold Decl., Ex. H (explaining \nthat, under Title 42 Process, unaccompanied children “routinely spend multiple days temporarily \nhoused in hotels”); id. at 11 (describing “[o]ne unaccompanied minor had been held in a hotel for \n11 days”). \nThird, public health officials have overwhelmingly noted there are numerous safety \nmeasures that can be taken to avoid the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines.15  See \nDeclaration of Les Roberts & Stephen P. Kachur, ¶¶ 10-16.  The CDC Orders do not reach a \ndifferent conclusion, but note only that in the government’s view it is not worth the resources or \nnot worth trying to safely process asylum seekers.  See, e.g., 85 Fed. Reg. at 17067 (speculating \nthat brief detention of noncitizens in Border Patrol stations would “divert [healthcare] resources \naway from the domestic population”).  Thus, the Administration has chosen to de-prioritize those \nfleeing danger, even as it permits or even encourages large recreational activities (such as beach \noutings), air travel by tens of thousands of foreign visitors, and other events and activities. \n                                                           \n15 Letter to HHS Secretary Azar and CDC Director Redfield Signed by Leaders of Public Health \nSchools, Medical Schools, Hospitals, and Other U.S. Institutions, Columbia Mailman School of \nPublic Health (May 18, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/y8q3asun. \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS   Document 15-1   Filed 08/20/20   Page 43 of 44\n \nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, the Court should provisionally certify the proposed Class, issue a \nclasswide preliminary injunction, and enjoin Defendants from applying the Title 42 Process to \nthe Class. \n \n \nDated: August 20, 2020             Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/Lee Gelernt_____________________ \nStephen B.

IRLI is dedicated to litigating immigration-related cases on \nbehalf of United States citizens. IRLI has litigated or filed amicus cu-\nriae briefs in many immigration-related cases before federal courts and \nadministrative  bodies,  including  Trump  v.  Hawaii,  138  S. Ct.  2392 \n(2018); United States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); Arizona Dream \nAct Coal. v. Brewer, 818 F.3d 101 (9th Cir. 2016); Wash. All. of Tech. \nWorkers v.

IRLI has represented a wide variety of plaintiffs in immigration \nmatters, ranging from American workers who have been displaced by \nforeign workers to foreign workers who have not been paid by their \nemployers. Consequently, IRLI is dedicated to assisting the courts in \nmaintaining a rational immigration system for the benefit of its cli-\nents. \nSTATEMENT \nThis case raises the question of whether statutory provisions governing \nthe public health system that authorize the executive branch to ban \nthe introduction of aliens into the United States from countries when \nthere is a danger of introducing disease have been implicitly repealed \nby subsequent enactments in immigration provisions governing asy-\nlum,  removal  of  aliens,  and  trafficking  of  children.  E.g.,  8 U.S.C. \n1 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 6 of 13\n \n§§ 1158, 1231, 1232.  \nThe Public Health Service Act contains immigration-related provi-\nsions that address the introduction of diseases from foreign countries. \nPub. L. No. 78-410, §§ 361–62, 58 Stat. 682, 703–04 (1944). Section 361 \nof the Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 264) authorizes the executive branch \nto make and enforce regulations “to prevent the introduction, trans-\nmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries” \nand for the “apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individ-\nuals” who are “coming into a State or possession from a foreign coun-\ntry” for the “purpose of preventing the introduction, transmission, or \nspread  of  such  communicable  diseases.”  Section  362  (codified  at \n42 U.S.C. §265) of the act authorizes the executive branch to promul-\ngate regulations that “prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of \npersons and property from such countries or places . . . in order to \navert such danger, and for such period of time . . . necessary for such \npurpose.”  \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Health \nand Human Services (HHS) issued an Interim Final Rule to allow the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director to invoke \nhis authority under Section 265. Control of Communicable Diseases; \nForeign Quarantine: Suspension of Introduction of Persons Into United \nStates From Designated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health \nPurposes, 85 Fed. Reg. 16,559–67 (Mar. 24, 2020). Subsequently, the \nCDC issued an order in response limiting travel to the United States. \nNotice of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Ser-\nvice Act Suspending Introduction of Certain Persons From Countries \nWhere a Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. 17,060–88 (Mar. \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 7 of 13\n \n26, 2020). The order enlisted the assistance of U.S. Customs and Bor-\nder Protection (CPB) for implementation. Id. Plaintiff filed this lawsuit \nalleging the government’s actions under 42 U.S.C. § 265 violate the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. Compl. ¶¶ 108–146. Plaintiff now seeks \na preliminary injunction. Mot. ECF 15. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nTo prevail in a motion for a preliminary injunction a plaintiff \nmust demonstrate 1) a substantial likelihood of success on the mer-\nits, 2) that they would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is \nnot granted, 3) that an injunction would not substantially injure oth-\ner interested parties, and 4) that the public interest would be fur-\nthered by the injunction. A district court must balance the strength \nof a plaintiff’s arguments in each of the four elements when deciding \nwhether to grant a preliminary injunction.  \nMills v. District of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1308 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (in-\nternal quotations and citations omitted). \nARGUMENT \nThe provisions of 42 U.S.C. §§ 264–65 authorize the executive branch \nto prohibit the introduction of people or property from countries where \nthe CDC has determined there exists a communicable disease. These \nprovisions  were  enacted  in  the  Public  Health  Service  Act,  Pub.  L. \nNo. 78-410, §§ 361–62, 58 Stat. 682 (1944). Subsequent enactments of \nimmigration provisions address the removal of aliens, 8 U.S.C. § 1231, \nand efforts to combat the trafficking of children, 8 U.S.C. § 1232. Im-\nmigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Pub. L. No. 82-414, § 214, 66 \nStat. 163, 202; William Wilburforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act \nof 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, § 235, 122 Stat. 5044, 5073. This case \npresents the question of whether later enacted immigration provisions \nhave implicitly repealed the earlier public health provisions.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 8 of 13\n \nI. Repeals by implication are disfavored. \n“It is, of course, a cardinal principle of statutory construction that re-\npeals by implication are not favored.” United States v. United Cont’l \nTuna Corp., 425 U.S. 164, 168 (1976). “The courts are not at liberty to \npick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two stat-\nutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a \nclearly  expressed  congressional  intention  to  the  contrary,  to  regard \neach as effective. ‘When there are two acts upon the same subject, the \nrule is to give effect to both if possible.’” Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. \n535, 551 (1974) (quoting United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198 \n(1939)). Furthermore, the courts treat allegations of partial repeal by \nimplication in the same manner as allegations of total repeal by impli-\ncation. E.g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1017 (1984); \nHunter v. FERC, 711 F.3d 155, 159 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Under the general \nrule of statutory construction, the provisions of Title 42 have not been \nrepealed by subsequent enactments in Title 8. \nThere are two situations, however, where courts find repeals by im-\nplication:  \n“(1) where provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the \nlater act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of \nthe earlier one; and (2) if the later act covers the whole subject of the \nearlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate \nsimilarly as a repeal of the earlier act. But, in either case, the inten-\ntion of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest.”  \nKremer  v.  Chem.  Constr.  Corp.,  456  U.S.  461,  468  (1982)  (quoting \nRadzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 154 (1976)). Such a \nfinding  is  rare.  See  Branch  v.  Smith,  538  U.S.  254,  293  (2003) \n(O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (observing the \nCourt had not found an implied repeal outside the anti-trust context \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 9 of 13\n \nsince 1917, or any implied repeal since 1975). \nII. Section 245 is neither a substitute for nor in irreconcilable \nconflict with the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nThe first circumstance for finding a repeal by implication is not pre-\nsent. The executive’s powers to restrict immigration under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 265 are not boundless. That provision can only be invoked when four \nprerequisites are satisfied: the CDC must (1) determine the existence of \na communicable disease in a foreign country; (2) that there is serious \ndanger  of  the  introduction  of  the  disease  into  the  United  States; \n(3) that the danger from the disease is increased by the introduction of \npersons or property from that country; and (4) that the suspension of \nthe introduction of such persons or property is required in the interest \nof public health. Id. Therefore, 42 U.S.C. § 265 is not a provision of \ngeneral application. Furthermore, it is notable that neither the com-\nplaint, ECF 1, nor Plaintiff’s memorandum in support of their motion, \nECF 15-1, dispute whether the CDC has satisfied the prerequisites of \nsection 265.  \nBecause section 265 is one of limited application, it is not difficult to \ngive effect to both it and the statutory provisions of Title 8. The provi-\nsions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, \n1231, 1232) are of general application and normally apply. In contrast, \nsection 265 only applies in limited circumstances and over limited pe-\nriods of time. Such an interpretation flows naturally from the generalia \nspecialibus non derogant (general/specific) canon of statutory construc-\ntion. “[W]here general and specific authorizations exist side-by-side, \nthe general/specific canon avoids rendering superfluous a specific pro-\nvision that is swallowed by the general one.” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 10 of 13\n \nLLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012). The provisions of \nTitle 42 can, and should be, given full effect. \nThe second circumstance for finding repeal by implication here can \nbe dispensed with quickly. The public health provisions and immigra-\ntion provisions at issue are in different titles of the U.S. Code (8: Aliens \nand Nationality; 42: The Public Health and Welfare). Section 265 of \nTitle 42 was created in an act that consolidated the laws relating to the \nPublic Health Service. Public Health Service Act, § 362, 58 Stat. at \n704. Clearly, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as amended \ndoes not cover the whole subject of public health. There is some overlap \nin subject matter, but the Public Health Service Act is not a subset of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act. For example, the former’s crea-\ntion of a National Health Service Corps does not exist anywhere in the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act.  Public  Health  Service  Act,  § 203, \n58 Stat. at 683. Therefore, neither circumstance for finding a repeal by \nimplication exists here. \nNat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Defs. of Wildlife, is instructive on this \npoint. 551 U.S. 644 (2007). The Clean Water Act (1972) gave the Envi-\nronmental Protection Agency authority to issue permits for the dis-\ncharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Defs. of Wildlife v. United \nStates EPA, 420 F.3d 946, 950 (9th Cir. 2005). The same Act permitted \nstates to apply to the EPA to administer the permit program within \ntheir borders. Id. Furthermore, the Clean Water Act mandated that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency approve such applications if nine \nconditions were met. Id. Subsequently, in 1973 Congress enacted the \nEndangered Species Act. Id. The Endangered Species Act required that \nagencies  must  ensure  that  their  actions  would  not  adversely  affect \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 11 of 13\n \nthreatened species. Id. at 950–51. The Defs. of Wildlife plaintiff chal-\nlenged the transfer of a permit process to Arizona under the Clean Wa-\nter Act on the grounds that the transfer did not conform to the re-\nquirements of the Endangered Species Act. Id. at 955. \nThe Ninth Circuit vacated the permit process transfer, even though \nthe nine requirements of the Clean Water Act had been satisfied. Id. \nat 978. The Ninth Circuit held that the requirements of the Endan-\ngered Species Act also applied, effectively creating a tenth requirement \nfor the application process. Id. at 975; Defs. of Wildlife v. United States \nEPA, 450 F.3d 394, 404 n.2 (9th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he very definite, un-\nqualified language of the after-enacted Endangered Species Act must \nstill prevail.”) (Berzon, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  \nOn writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed. 551 U.S. at 673. \nThe Supreme Court noted that the Ninth Circuit’s grafting of a tenth \nrequirement from the Endangered Species Act into the permit applica-\ntion process impermissibly created an implicit repeal of the mandate of \nthe Clean Water Act. Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders, 551 U.S. at 663. \nSimilarly here, the provisions of Title 42 cannot be wiped out implicitly \nby the later enactments to Title 8 when there has been no specific re-\npeal. \nIII. Congress’s subsequent amendments to the immigration-related \nprovisions of the Health Service Act show a lack of implicit \nrepeal. \nSection 361 of the Public Health Service Act, authorizing regulations to \nprevent the introduction of disease from foreign countries and allowing \nthe apprehension of aliens coming from a foreign country, has been \namended three times after the enactment of the Immigration and Na-\n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 12 of 13\n \ntionality Act of 1952. The Hawaii Omnibus Act (1960) removed refer-\nences to the Territory of Hawaii. Pub. L. 86–624, § 29, 74 Stat. 419, \n624. The National Consumer Health Information and Health Promo-\ntion Act of 1976 redefined state to include the District of Columbia. \nPub. L. 94–317, § 301, 90 Stat. 695, 707. The Public Health Security \nand Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 modified the \nregulatory requirements governing the apprehension of aliens. Pub. L. \nNo. 107–188,  § 142,  116 Stat.  594,  626–27.  Congress’s  repeated \namendments to the provision authorizing regulations to restrict the \nintroduction of aliens to prevent the spread of communicable diseases \nshows that Congress has not intended an implicit repeal of the execu-\ntive’s authority in this area. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the motion for preliminary injunction \nshould be denied. \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 57   Filed 09/17/20   Page 13 of 13\n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ John M.

The Executive Branch has carried this out \nthrough a two-step process.   \nFirst, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) issued an interim final \nrule amending its Foreign Quarantine Regulations to authorize the CDC Director to issue orders \nsuspending “the introduction into the United States of persons from designated foreign countries \n… or places” if necessary to address a “serious danger of the introduction of … communicable \ndisease into the United States.”  85 Fed. Reg. 16,559, 16,566 (Mar. 24, 2020) (42 C.F.R. \n§ 71.40(a)).  The CDC rule purports to rest not on any authority granted by the Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”), which Congress enacted in 1952 and has amended multiple times since \nthen, but rather on a public health provision originally enacted in 1893 and later re-enacted as \nsection 362 of the 1944 Public Health Service Act.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563; see also Act of \nFeb. 15, 1893, ch. 114, § 7, 27 Stat. 449, 452.  Now codified at 42 U.S.C. § 265, the public \nhealth provision authorizes the Director of the CDC to address “a serious danger of the \nintroduction of” a “communicable disease” from a foreign country “into the United States” by \n“prohibit[ing], in whole or in part, the introduction of persons and property from such countries \nor places as he shall designate in order to avert such danger, and for such period of time as he \nmay deem necessary for such purpose.”  While the CDC interprets this authority expansively, the \nCDC Rule does not apply to all persons entering the United States.  Rather, United States \ncitizens, lawful permanent residents, and certain members of the U.S. military are excluded \nentirely from the scope of the authority that the rule creates.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 16,567 (42 \nC.F.R. § 71.40(f)). \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 7 of 16\nSecond, exercising his new authority under the interim final rule, the CDC Director \nissued an order suspending for 30 days the introduction of persons traveling across the land \nborders with Mexico or Canada who would otherwise enter a “congregate setting” in a land port \nof entry or Border Patrol station.  85 Fed. Reg. 17,061, 17,067 (Mar. 26, 2020) (“CDC Order” or \n“Order”).  The Order does not apply to (1) United States citizens, lawful permanent residents, \nand their spouses or children; (2) members of the United States military, and their spouses or \nchildren; or (3) persons who arrive at a port of entry who either have valid travel documents or \nare in the visa waiver program and not otherwise subject to travel restrictions.  See id. at 17,061.  \nThose persons who remain covered after application of these exceptions are denominated \n“covered aliens.”  Id.  The CDC Order requests that the Department of Homeland Security return \nsuch “covered aliens” immediately or as rapidly as possible “to the country from which they \nentered the United States, to their country of origin, or another location as practicable.”  Id. at \n17,067.  The CDC Director has twice extended his suspension order (collectively, “CDC \nOrders”), most recently doing so for an indefinite period of time.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 31,503, \n31,504 (May 26, 2020).  In the same order, the Director also extended its scope to cover coastal \nports of entry and border patrol stations.  Id.  Airports remain uncovered.  Id. at 31,504 n.1. \nEven before the CDC issued its interim final rule and the Director issued the CDC \nOrders, the INA already authorized expedited removal of noncitizens without valid entry \ndocuments who arrive at the United States border, or who are apprehended in the United States \nafter having entered the country without inspection and who are unable to prove that they have \nbeen physically present in the country for two years.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (iii).  \nImmigration officers may proceed immediately to remove such noncitizens unless they indicate \nan intention to apply for asylum, in which case asylum officers evaluate whether the noncitizens \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 8 of 16\nhave a credible fear of persecution, subject to additional review.  See id. § 1225(b)(1)(B).  In \nlight of this existing authority, the actual scope of new authority granted by the CDC Orders is \neffectively targeted to a particular group—namely, those “covered aliens,” and particularly \nunaccompanied minors, who would seek asylum or withholding of removal based on persecution \nor torture they would face if returned to their country of origin.  And, as the CDC Orders \nthemselves state, the Orders’ intent includes return of these very persons to those very countries \nof origin where they face persecution.   \nThe CDC Orders purport to provide an exception for persons who “should be excepted \nbased on the totality of the circumstances, including consideration of significant law \nenforcement, officer and public safety, humanitarian, and public health interests,” 85 Fed. Reg. \nat 17,061.  But nothing in the Orders indicates how this exception is to be applied or whether it \nwill accommodate applications for asylum or withholding of deportation on the grounds of \npersecution or torture in the noncitizen’s home country.  A subsequently leaked April 2020 \nCustoms and Border Protection memorandum refers only to treatment of a “Convention Against \nTorture Claim,” but even as to that, the protection described by the memo is sparse: “Aliens that \nmake an affirmative, spontaneous and reasonably believable claim that they fear being tortured \nin the country they are being sent back to, will be taken to the designated station and referred to \nUSCIS.”2  There is no mention of asylum or other grounds for withholding of deportation. \n   \n \n2   COVID-19 Capio Memorandum, at 4, https://www.documentcloud.org/ \ndocuments/6824221-COVID-19-CAPIO.html (visited August 21, 2020). \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 9 of 16\nARGUMENT \nI.  THE CDC ORDERS VIOLATE STATUTES PROVIDING FOR ASYLUM, \nWITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL, PROTECTION AGAINST TORTURE, AND \nPROTECTION OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN \nA.  United States Statutes Protect From Removal Noncitizens Facing Persecution \nOr Torture In Their Home Countries, And Extend Special Protections To \nUnaccompanied Children \nSince 1980, and continuing through 2008, Congress has enacted a series of protections \nfor noncitizens arriving in, or physically present in, the United States who face persecution or \ntorture in their home countries, including special procedural protections for unaccompanied \nnoncitizen children before they may be removed from the United States.  These statutes seek to \neffectuate fundamental principles of international law and international treaty obligations of the \nUnited States, including those enshrined in the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the \nStatus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.   \nThe first of these protections is asylum.  Congress established the asylum process in the \nRefugee Act of 1980.  In that Act, Congress largely adopted the definition of refugee in the 1951 \nConvention and 1967 Protocol, the latter of which the United States had ratified in 1968.  As \nrelevant to the “covered aliens” at issue in this case, United States law defines a “refugee” as \n“any person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality … and who is unable or \nunwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, \nthat country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, \nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(42); compare 1951 Convention art. 1(A)(2); 1967 Protocol art. 1(2).  With certain \nexceptions not relevant here, none of which concerns public health, the INA guarantees to “[a]ny \nalien who is physically present in the United States”—like Plaintiff here—the right to apply for \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 10 of 16\nasylum protection as a refugee.  Id. § 1158(a)(1), (b)(1)(A).  While the determination of whether \nto grant such a person asylum is discretionary, the right to apply for asylum is not.   \nA second protection is withholding of removal on the basis of persecution.  While the \nINA authorizes removal of noncitizens from the United States for specified reasons, see, e.g., 8 \nU.S.C. § 1229a(a)(2), the INA prohibits such removal (again, with certain exceptions not \nrelevant here that do not concern public health) to a country if “the alien’s life or freedom would \nbe threatened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion,” id. § 1231(b)(3)(A).  In contrast with asylum, if the \nrequirements for withholding of removal are satisfied, then withholding is mandatory.  See, e.g., \nINS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 419-20 (1999).  This prohibition on forcible return to a \ncountry where a person’s life or freedom would be threatened derives from the international law \nprinciple of non-refoulement, which is set forth in, among other sources, the 1951 Convention.  \nSee 1951 Convention, Art. 33(1) (“No Contracting State shall expel or return (‘refouler’) a \nrefugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would \nbe threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social \ngroup or political opinion.”).3 \nYet a third protection provided to noncitizens is protection from torture, derived from the \nUnited States’ implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other \nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”).  See Foreign Affairs Reform \nand Restructuring Act of 1998. Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (codified \n \n3   Earlier this summer, the Department of Homeland Security and Executive Office for \nImmigration Review issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, seeking to amend their regulations \nto provide that international pandemic threats may be considered for purposes of applying the \n“danger to the security of the United States” exception to asylum and withholding of deportation.  \nSee 85 Fed. Reg. 41,201 (July 9, 2020). \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 11 of 16\nat 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note).  Under the regulations implementing that statute, withholding or \ndeferral of removal is mandatory if the applicant shows that it is “more likely than not that he or \nshe would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.”  8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16(c)(2), \n208.17(a).  In contrast to asylum and withholding of deportation, the torture need not be on the \ngrounds of the person’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion. \nFinally, in addition to these protections available to noncitizens facing persecution or \ntorture in their countries of origin, Congress legislated special protections for unaccompanied \nnoncitizen children in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.  See Pub. \nL. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (Dec. 23, 2008).  In addition to provisions regarding custody, the \nTVPRA requires the government to adhere to specific procedures before removing \nunaccompanied children from the United States, including opportunities for such children to \ninvoke protections based on a fear of persecution.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a).   \nB.  Section 362 Of The 1944 Public Health Service Act Does Not Override The \nSpecific Protections From Removal That Congress Has Enacted In The \nIntervening Decades \nThe CDC Orders’ instruction that “covered aliens” be immediately or rapidly removed \nfrom the United States with no opportunity to invoke asylum, withholding of removal, or the \nTVPRA—and with no provision for the processing of CAT claims other than “affirmative, \nspontaneous” statements by the noncitizen—appears to rest on the proposition that an authority \ngranted by section 362 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 265, overrides the statutory \nprotections from removal described above.  But there is no reason why section 265 need be, or \nshould be, read to conflict with (or override) those statutes, for several reasons. \nFirst, it is a longstanding rule of statutory construction that “[w]hen confronted with two \nActs of Congress allegedly touching on the same topic, [a] Court is not at liberty to pick and \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 12 of 16\nchoose among congressional enactments and must instead strive to give effect to both.”  Epic \nSys. Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  That is not only possible here, but doing so would give effect to the most natural \nconstruction of the text of the public health statute.  Section 265 is about the prohibition of “the \nintroduction of persons and property” into the United States.  It is not about removal (or \nexpulsion) of persons from the United States.  Nor, importantly, does section 265 address in any \nway the myriad protections against the forcible return of persons to countries where they face \npersecution or torture, or protections for unaccompanied children.  For these reasons, there is no \nreason why section 265 must, or should, be read to address a subject about which it says \nnothing—removal or expulsion of persons from the United States—or to negate fundamental, \ninternationally recognized, and congressionally legislated protections that section 265 never \nmentions.   \nSecond, congressional action in the more-than-half century since the Public Health \nService Act was enacted further confirms that Congress would not have understood that public \nhealth authority to have overridden the statutory protections described in Part I.A of this brief.  \nTo start, Congress has addressed communicable diseases in the immigration laws since 1891.  \nSee Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084, 1084 (excluding from admission “persons \nsuffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease”).  The current INA states that a \nnoncitizen is inadmissible if he or she has “a communicable disease of public health \nsignificance,” which determination is to be made “in accordance with regulations prescribed by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a(1)(A)(i).  In making this an \ninadmissibility ground, Congress also made it a ground for removal of persons who have arrived \nat a port of entry or entered the country without inspection.  See id. § 1229a(a)(2) (authorizing \n- 8 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 13 of 16\ncharging of “alien” in removal proceedings “with any applicable ground of inadmissibility under \nsection 1182(a)”).  Yet, having provided for removal on this communicable disease ground, \nCongress also subjected that removal power to the normal defenses to removal, see id. \n§ 1229a(c)(4)—which include the protections of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT.  \nGiven what Congress actually did do when it turned its attention to the issue of “communicable \ndiseases” in the INA, it would be unreasonable to read section 265—a provision from an earlier \npublic health law—to free the Executive Branch from the restrictions against removal in those \nlater-enacted laws. \nCongress also has specifically addressed the authority of the Executive Branch to conduct \nexpedited removal of persons who arrive at the country’s land borders or cross them without \ninspection.  It did so in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996 (“IIRIRA”).  And while those provisions purport to grant broad authority to the Attorney \nGeneral and immigration officers, the provisions nevertheless require that noncitizens subject to \nexpedited removal be given an opportunity to present any grounds they may have for asylum, \nwithholding of deportation, or CAT protection.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (authorizing removal \nwithout substantial hearing “unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum \nunder section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution”); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4) (providing for \ninterview “[i]f an alien subject to the expedited removal provisions indicates an intention to \napply for asylum, or expresses a fear of persecution or torture, or a fear of return to his or her \ncountry”).  The CDC Orders deny these protections to the same persons covered by the INA’s \nexpedited removal procedures—the persons denominated “covered aliens” by those Orders.  But \nCongress already considered the circumstances in which inadmissible noncitizens could be \nremoved expeditiously, and it made clear that even in those circumstances, the noncitizen is \n- 9 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 14 of 16\nentitled to a substantial hearing (at minimum, an asylum officer interview, subject to further \nreview) on claims of persecution or torture giving rise to protection from removal.  Again, given \nwhat Congress actually did do when it turned its attention to the issue of expedited removal in \nIIRIRA, it would be unreasonable to read section 265—a public health provision addressing the \nprohibition of introduction of persons into the United States—to free the Executive Branch from \nthe restrictions enacted in expedited removal provisions themselves. \nIn sum, in the many decades after Congress enacted section 265, it developed, enacted, \nand repeatedly modified a comprehensive set of immigration laws that both address the issues at \nthe heart of the CDC Orders—communicable diseases and expedited removal—and impose \nspecific restrictions on the authority of the Executive Branch to remove noncitizens from the \nUnited States in service of important broadly-recognized principles, including non-refoulement \nand protection of minors.  That history is significant because, as courts recognize, “the meaning \nof one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken \nsubsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand.”  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000).  Given the substantial history of legislative action since \nCongress enacted section 265, that public health provision cannot be read as broadly as the CDC \nDirector does in his Orders to simply negate the myriad statutory protections from removal that \nCongress subsequently enacted.  As the Supreme Court has explained, the “classic judicial task \nof reconciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to ‘make sense’ in combination, \nnecessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later \nstatute.”  United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 (1988).  That is, at minimum, the case here.   \nThere is no reason why section 265 should be read, or needs to be read, to authorize the \nExecutive Branch to remove persons seeking protection from persecution and torture without \n- 10 - \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 36   Filed 09/03/20   Page 15 of 16\ngranting those persons the hearings to which Congress said they are entitled on such claims.  Nor \nis there any need or reason for section 265 to be read to authorize the Executive Branch to expel \nunaccompanied minors from the United States without first requiring the procedures that \nCongress mandated take place. \nThe current legal structure provides the government with various public health tools to \naddress communicable diseases without sacrificing the right of noncitizens to seek protection \nestablished by this Nation’s laws.  Testing and quarantine of noncitizens, including those seeking \nour protection, can be implemented in a manner consistent with our treaty obligations; indeed, \nCongress has provided for that power, see 42 U.S.C. Part G (Quarantine and Inspection), and the \nCDC has issued Foreign Quarantine Regulations pursuant to that authority, see 42 C.F.R. Part 71 \n(Foreign Quarantine).   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should hold that section 265 is part of the larger \nlegal landscape and cannot be read to free the Executive Branch from the asylum, withholding of \nremoval, CAT, and TVPRA protections mandated by Congress. \n \nDated:  August 21, 2020  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  /s/ Paul R.Q.

Recent agency action in response to the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic—specifically, an interim final rule promulgated by the Department of Health and Human \nServices and a series of orders issued by Defendant Robert R. Redfield, Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), pursuant to Section 362 of the Public Health Service \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 265 (“Section 265”)—allowed the government to detain Plaintiff pending expul-\nsion from the United States without many of the legal protections that he would otherwise have \nenjoyed under various immigration laws.  In his present action against various federal officials \n(“Defendants” or the “government”), Plaintiff seeks an injunction prohibiting enforcement of those \nprocedures, which Plaintiff collectively calls the “Title 42 Process,” against those situated simi-\nlarly to Plaintiff—that is, unaccompanied non-citizen children detained in the United States by the \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 2 of 50\ngovernment after entering the country.  He argues that the Title 42 Process violates the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), 706(2)(A), because the expulsion of non-citizens from \nthe United States in the manner contemplated and practiced exceeds the authority granted by Sec-\ntion 265; conflicts with certain immigration laws—specifically, the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, various provisions of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Re-\nstructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1231 Note; and constitutes arbitrary and capri-\ncious agency action because the agency did not offer a reasoned explanation for applying the Title \n42 Process to unaccompanied children. \n  Currently before the Court are (1) Plaintiff’s request for provisional certification of a class \ndefined as all unaccompanied non-citizen children who are or will be detained in U.S. government \ncustody in the United States and who are or will be subjected to the Title 42 Process and (2) his \nrequest for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of that process against members of \nthe putative class.1  For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff’s motion for class certification should be \nprovisionally granted and his motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted. \n \n \n                                                           \n1 Judge Sullivan referred this case to the undersigned for full case management.  The docket entries relevant to this \nReport and Recommendation are (1) Plaintiff’s Complaint (ECF No. 1), (2) his motion for class certification and its \nexhibits (ECF Nos. 2 through 2-4), (3) his motion for preliminary injunction and its exhibits (ECF No. 14-1 (sealed \nexhibit); ECF Nos. 15 through 15-12 (redacted opening brief and non-sealed exhibits)), (4) the government’s com-\nbined opposition to both motions and its exhibits (ECF Nos. 42 through 42-5 (redacted opposition brief and non-sealed \nexhibits); ECF Nos. 44-2, 44-3 (sealed, unredacted brief and sealed exhibit)), (5) Plaintiff’s combined reply and its \nexhibits (ECF No. 51-1 (sealed, unredacted reply); ECF Nos. 52 through 52-4 (redacted reply and non-sealed exhib-\nits)), (6) the government’s motion to strike or, in the alternative, motion for leave to file an additional declaration and \nits exhibits (ECF No. 58), (7) Plaintiff’s response to the government’s motion to strike/motion for leave to file (ECF \nNo. 61), and (8) the government’s reply in further support of its motion to strike/motion for leave to file (ECF No. \n63).  In addition, the undersigned has considered the briefs of amici curiae Scholars of Refugee and Immigration Law \n(ECF No. 36), the International Refugee Assistance Project (ECF No. 37), and the Immigration Reform Law Institute \n(“IRLI”) (ECF No.57).

BACKGROUND \n  Because resolution of Plaintiff’s preliminary injunction motion hinges, at least in part, on \nthe legal question of whether the agency regulations, orders, and guidance implementing the Title \n42 Process conflict with various federal statutes, this section begins with an outline of the statutory \nand regulatory enactments comprising the Title 42 Process, then discusses a similar prior case in \nthis District brought by an unaccompanied minor who had been subjected to the Title 42 Process, \nand concludes with Plaintiff’s participation in that process. \n  A.  Statutory and Regulatory Background \n  Section 265 states: \nWhenever the Surgeon General determines that by reason of the existence of any \ncommunicable disease in a foreign country there is serious danger of the introduc-\ntion of such disease into the United States, and that this danger is so increased by \nthe introduction of persons or property from such country that a suspension of the \nright to introduce such persons and property is required in the interest of the public \nhealth, the Surgeon General, in accordance with regulations approved by the Pres-\nident, shall have the power to prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of per-\nsons and property from such countries or places as he shall designate in order to \navert such danger, and for such period of time as he may deem necessary for such \npurpose. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 265.  The parties agree that this provision passed in 1944 as part of the Public Health \nService Act, Pub. L. 78-410, § 362, 58 Stat. 682, 704 (1944), is based on and substantially similar \nto a provision in a statute enacted in 1893 (the “1893 Act”) that gave the President “the power to \nprohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of persons or property” from foreign countries that, \n“by reason of the existence of cholera or contagious diseases” in those countries, “posed a serious \ndanger of introduction of the same into the United States.”  ECF No. 5-5 at 5 (attaching Act of \nFebruary 15, 1893, ch. 114, § 7, 27 Stat. 449, 452).  Since the enactment of Section 265, the au-\nthority of the Surgeon General passed to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 4 of 50\nServices, who then delegated it to the Director of the CDC.  See Control of Communicable Dis-\neases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of Introduction of Persons into United States from Desig-\nnated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes [hereinafter, “Interim Final Rule”], \n85 Fed. Reg. 16,559-01, 16560 & n.1 (Mar. 24, 2020) (effective Mar. 20, 2020) (codified at 42 \nC.F.R. § 71.40).  \n  Relying on that authority, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 24, 2020, the \nCDC published the Interim Final Rule to implement Section 265 “and other applicable provisions \nof the [Public Health Service] Act” to provide a “robust, efficient mechanism for exercising the \nauthority . . . to suspend the introduction of persons into the United States, should the public health \nrequire it.”  Interim Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 16,559-01, 16,562.  The rule enabled the CDC Di-\nrector to  \nprohibit the introduction into the United States of persons from designated foreign \ncountries  (or  one  or  more  political  subdivisions  and  regions  thereof)  or \nplaces . . . by issuing an order in which the Director determines that: \n \n(1)  By reason of the existence of any communicable disease in a foreign \ncountry (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or \nplace, there is serious danger of the introduction of such communi-\ncable disease into the United States, and \n \n(2)   This danger is so increased by the introduction of persons from such \ncountry (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or \nplace that a suspension of the introduction of such persons into the \nUnited States is required in the interest of the public health. \n \nInterim Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 16,559-01, 16,563.  It further defined  \n“introduction into the United States of persons” from a foreign country . . . to clar-\nify that “introduction” can encompass those who have physically crossed a border \nof the United States and are in the process of moving into the interior in a manner \nthe Director determines to present a risk of transmission of a communicable disease.  \nThis additional mechanism to halt the travel of such persons and rapidly moving \nthem outside the United States constitutes preventing their “introduction” into the \nUnited States. \n \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 5 of 50\nInterim Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 16,559-01, 16,563. \n  Two days later, the CDC Director issued the first of a series of three orders (the “CDC \nOrders”) directed to preventing the “introduction” of certain persons into the United States in the \ninterest of public health.  The order asserts that  \na serious danger of the introduction of COVID-19 into the land [ports of entry] and \nBorder Patrol stations at or near the United States borders with Canada and Mexico, \nand into the interior of the country as a whole, because COVID-19 exists in Canada, \nMexico, and the other countries of origin of persons who migrate to the United \nStates across the land borders with Canada and Mexico. \n \nNotice of Order Under Sections 362 and 365[2] of the Public Health Service Act Suspending In-\ntroduction of Certain Persons from Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists [hereinafter, \n“March 20 Order”], 85 Fed. Reg. 17,060-02, 17,061 (Mar. 26, 2020) (effective Mar. 20, 2020).  \nThe CDC Director found that “persons travelling from Canada or Mexico (regardless of their coun-\ntry of origin)” who must be held for significant periods of time in “congregate settings” at land \nports of entry and Border Patrol stations as they undergo immigration processing “would typically \nbe aliens seeking to enter the United States at [ports of entry] who do not have proper travel doc-\numents, aliens whose entry is otherwise contrary to law, and aliens who are apprehended near the \nborder seeking to unlawfully enter the United States.”  March 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  \nThe order further states that land Ports of Entry and Border Patrol stations “are not equipped to[ ] \nquarantine, isolate, or enable social distancing by persons who are or may be infected with \nCOVID-19” and that the “public health tool called conditional release, which involves the release \nof potentially infected individuals from federal custody subject to conditions calculated to mitigate \nthe risk of disease transmission, such as mandatory self-isolation and CDC monitoring at home” \n                                                           \n2 Section 365 of the Public Health Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 268, assigns to customs and Coast Guard officers the \n“duty . . . to aid in the enforcement of quarantine rules and regulations.” \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 6 of 50\nis “not a viable solution” because many such aliens “may lack homes or other places in the United \nStates where they can self-isolate, and CDC lacks the resources and personnel necessary to effec-\ntively monitor such a large number of persons.”  March 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061, 17,067.  \nTherefore, as “[t]he introduction into [those] congregate settings” of these “covered aliens”—de-\nfined as “persons travelling from Canada or Mexico (regardless of their country of origin) who \nwould otherwise be introduced into a congregate setting in a land Port of Entry or Border patrol \nstation at or near the United States border with Canada and Mexico”—increased the public health \nrisk posed by the pandemic, the CDC Director “suspend[ed] the introduction of all covered aliens \ninto the United States for a period of 30 days,” noting that “[t]he faster a covered alien is returned \nto the country from which they entered the United States, to their country of origin, or another \nlocation as practicable, the lower the risk the alien poses of introducing, transmitting, or spreading \nCOVID-19” in the United States.3  March 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061, 17,067.   \nThe duration of the March 20 Order was extended for another 30 days on April 22, 2020.  \nExtension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act; Order Suspend-\ning Introduction of Certain Persons from Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists, 85 \nFed. Reg. 22,424-01 (Apr. 22, 2020) (effective date Apr. 20, 2020).  And, in an order known as \nthe “May 20 Order,” the CDC Director amended the March 20 Order (as extended) to “clarify that \nit applies to land and coastal Ports of Entry and Border Patrol stations that would otherwise hold \naliens in a congregate setting”4 and extended its duration “until he determines the risk of further \n                                                           \n3 The March 20 Order exempts from its coverage U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and military personnel; \nthe spouses and children of those individuals; individuals from foreign countries who hold valid travel documents; \nand individuals from foreign countries in the visa waiver program not otherwise subject to travel restrictions.  March \n20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061.  It also allows customs officers to make individualized exceptions on a case-by-case \nbasis under a totality of the circumstances, “including consideration of significant law enforcement, officer and public \nsafety, humanitarian, and public health interests.”  March 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061. \n  \n4 The May 20 Order “recognizes that in certain limited instances, a fact-based inquiry may be required to determine \nwhether individuals are covered aliens within the meaning of the [May 20 Order].  For example, it may be unclear \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 7 of 50\nCOVID-19 into the United States from covered aliens has ceased to be a serious danger to the \npublic health.”  Amendment and Extension of Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public \nHealth Service Act; Order Suspending Introduction of Certain Persons from Countries Where a \nCommunicable Disease Exists [hereinafter, “May 20 Order”], 85 Fed. Reg. 31,503-02, 31,504 \n(May 26, 2020) (effective May 21, 2020). \nOn September 11, 2020, the CDC published a final rule with an effective date of October \n13, 2020, unless the Interim Final Rule “is vacated or enjoined by a court, in which case the Sec-\nretary [of Health and Human Services] will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing \nan updated effective date for th[e] [final] rule.”  Control of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quar-\nantine: Suspension of the Right to Introduce and Prohibition of Introduction of Persons into United \nStates from Designated Foreign Countries or Places for Public Health Purposes [hereinafter, “Final \nRule”], 85 Fed. Reg. 56,424-01, 56,424 (Sept. 11, 2020) (effective Oct. 13, 2020) (to be codified \nat 42 C.F.R. 71.40).  The Final Rule makes some changes to the Interim Final Rule: the title is \nchanged to replace the term “communicable disease” with the term “quarantinable communicable \ndisease,” it adds a requirement that the CDC Director include in any order issued under the regu-\nlation a statement about the danger of introduction of the disease in the places from which people \nare being prohibited, and it no longer uses the word “vector” to refer to humans.  Final Rule, 85 \nFed. Reg. at 56,443–56,444.  However, the material provisions remain the same and are “clarified” \nby explanations of the agency’s interpretations of the language of Section 265.  For example, the \nFinal Rule states that the term “introduction” includes the situation “when a person on U.S. soil \nmoves further into the United States”; that the phrase “prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction \n                                                           \nwhether individuals who arrive at a coastal border by boat departed from Mexico, or another country, such as Haiti.”  \nMay 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 31,507 n.28.  The CDC “defer[red]” to the Department of Homeland Security “regard-\ning the operational considerations necessary to address such scenarios.”  May 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 31,507 n.28.   \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 8 of 50\ninto the United States of persons” includes the power of “physically expelling from the United \nStates some or all of the persons”; and that the phrase “suspension of the right to introduce” means \n“to cause the temporary cessation of the effect of any law, rule, decree, or order pursuant to which \na person might otherwise have the right to be introduced or seek introduction into the United \nStates.”  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 56,425–56,426.  Further, the Final Rule declares that “[n]o \naction can or will be taken under this final rule absent an administrative Order issued by the [CDC] \nDirector.”5  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 56,425. \n                                                           \n5 Pursuant to the Final Rule, 42 C.F.R. § 71.40 will read: \n \nSuspension of the right to introduce and prohibition of the introduction of persons into the United States from desig-\nnated foreign countries or places for public health purposes. \n \n(a)   The Director may prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction into the United States of persons from desig-\nnated foreign countries (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or places, only for such \nperiod of time that the Director deems necessary to avert the serious danger of the introduction of a quaran-\ntinable communicable disease, by issuing an order in which the Director determines that: \n(1)   By reason of the existence of any quarantinable communicable disease in a foreign country (or one \nor more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or place there is serious danger of the introduction \nof such quarantinable communicable disease into the United States; and \n(2)   This danger is so increased by the introduction of persons from such country (or one or more polit-\nical subdivisions or regions thereof) or place that a suspension of the right to introduce such persons \ninto the United States is required in the interest of public health. \n(b)   For purposes of this section: \n(1)   Introduction into the United States means the movement of a person from a foreign country (or one \nor more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or place, or series of foreign countries or places, \ninto the United States so as to bring the person into contact with persons or property in the United \nStates, in a manner that the Director determines to present a risk of transmission of a quarantinable \ncommunicable disease to persons, or a risk of contamination of property with a quarantinable com-\nmunicable disease, even if the quarantinable communicable disease has already been introduced, \ntransmitted, or is spreading within the United States; \n(2)   Prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction into the United States of persons means to prevent the \nintroduction of persons into the United States by suspending any right to introduce into the United \nStates, physically stopping or restricting movement into the United States, or physically expelling \nfrom the United States some or all of the persons; \n(3)   Serious danger of the introduction of such quarantinable communicable disease into the United \nStates means the probable introduction of one or more persons capable of transmitting the quaran-\ntinable communicable disease into the United States, even if persons or property in the United States \nare already infected or contaminated with the quarantinable communicable disease; \n(4)   The term Place includes any location specified by the Director, including any carrier, as that term is \ndefined in 42 C.F.R. 71.1, whatever the carrier's flag, registry, or country of origin; and \n(5)   Suspension of the right to introduce means to cause the temporary cessation of the effect of any law, \nrule, decree, or order pursuant to which a person might otherwise have the right to be introduced or \nseek introduction into the United States. \n(c)   Any order issued by the Director under this section shall include a statement of the following: \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 9 of 50\nMeanwhile, on April 2, 2020, Customs and Border Protection issued a memorandum re-\ngarding its implementation of the Title 42 Process.  ECF No. 15-4, ¶ 6; ECF No. 15-5 at 15–18.  \n                                                           \n(1)   The foreign countries (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or places from which \nthe introduction of persons shall be prohibited; \n(2)   The period of time or circumstances under which the introduction of any persons or class of persons \ninto the United States shall be prohibited; \n(3)   The conditions under which that prohibition on introduction shall be effective in whole or in part, \nincluding any relevant exceptions that the Director determines are appropriate; \n(4)   The means by which the prohibition shall be implemented; and \n(5)   The serious danger posed by the introduction of the quarantinable communicable disease in the \nforeign country or countries (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or places from \nwhich the introduction of persons is being prohibited. \n(d)   When issuing any order under this section, the Director shall, as practicable under the circumstances, consult \nwith all Federal departments or agencies whose interests would be impacted by the order. The Director shall, \nas practicable under the circumstances, provide the Federal departments or agencies with a copy of the order \nbefore issuing it. In circumstances when it is impracticable to engage in such consultation before taking action \nto protect the public health, the Director shall consult with the Federal departments or agencies as soon as \npracticable after issuing his or her order, and may then modify the order as he or she determines appropriate. \nIn addition, the Director may, as practicable under the circumstances, consult with any State or local author-\nities that he or she deems appropriate in his or her discretion. \n(1)   If the order will be implemented in whole or in part by State and local authorities who have agreed \nto do so under 42 U.S.C. 243(a), then the Director shall explain in the order the procedures and \nstandards by which those authorities are expected to aid in the enforcement of the order. \n(2)   If the order will be implemented in whole or in part by designated customs officers (including any \nindividual designated by the Department of Homeland Security to perform the duties of a customs \nofficer) or Coast Guard officers under 42 U.S.C. 268(b), or another Federal department or agency, \nthen the Director shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security or other applicable \nFederal department or agency head, explain in the order the procedures and standards by which any \nauthorities or officers or agents are expected to aid in the enforcement of the order, to the extent that \nthey are permitted to do so under their existing legal authorities. \n(e)   This section does not apply to: \n(1)   Members of the armed forces of the United States and associated personnel if the Secretary of \nDefense provides assurance to the Director that the Secretary of Defense has taken or will take \nmeasures such as quarantine or isolation, or other measures maintaining control over such individ-\nuals, to prevent the risk of transmission of the quarantinable communicable disease into the United \nStates; or \n(2)  Other United States government employees or contractors on orders abroad, or their accompanying \nfamily members who are on their orders or are members of their household, if the Director receives \nassurances from the relevant head of agency and determines that the head of the agency or depart-\nment has taken or will take, measures such as quarantine or isolation, to prevent the risk of trans-\nmission of a quarantinable communicable disease into the United States. \n(f)   This section shall not apply to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and lawful permanent residents. \n(g)   Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or \ncircumstance, shall be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by \nlaw, unless such holding shall be one of utter invalidity or unenforceability, in which event the provision \nshall be severable from this section and shall not affect the remainder thereof or the application of the provi-\nsion to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances. \n \n85 Fed.

Id. at 18.  Those who are not “covered aliens” are to be “process[ed] \nunder existing statutory authorities found in Title 8 of the U.S. Code,” which includes the TVPRA, \nthe INA, and the FARRA, among other immigration statutes.

Wolf, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. June 9, 2020), ECF \nNo. 1.  J.B.B.C. also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order seeking to enjoin his expul-\nsion from the United States, arguing, as Plaintiff does here, that Section 265 does not authorize \n10 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 11 of 50\nexpulsion of non-citizens; that the Title 42 Process violates mandatory protections for unaccom-\npanied non-citizen children included in the TVPRA as well as rights under the asylum and with-\nholding of removal provisions of the INA; and that the Title 42 Process constitutes arbitrary and \ncapricious agency action because it lacks a reasoned explanation as to why the agency failed to \nexempt unaccompanied children from its purview.

He found that J.B.B.C. was likely to \nsucceed on the merits of his claim.  He stated, first, that there was a “serious question” about \nwhether Section 265’s grant of the power “to prohibit the introduction of persons and property” \ncould be read to “include[ ] the power also to remove or exclude persons who are already present \nin the United States,” noting that, while immigration statutes “reference the power to return or to \nremove,” Section 265 dies not include those terms.  JBBC Transcript at 50.  Second, he found that, \neven if Section 265 were read to include the power to remove, it would still have to be harmonized \nwith immigration statutes, including those that “grant special protection to minors” and that “deal \nwith communicable diseases and quarantines.”  JBBC Transcript at 50.  He further found that the \nCDC Director’s definition of “introduction” to include the power to expel from the United States \nwas likely not entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), because Section 265 “needs to be read in light of [immigration] \n11 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 12 of 50\nstatutes that the CDC director quite plainly has no special expertise reading” and because the CDC \nDirector provided “little by way of analysis of what the power to prohibit the introduction of per-\nsons and property means.”  JBBC Transcript at 50–51.  Judge Nichols did not reach the question \nof whether the Title 42 Process is arbitrary and capricious, but indicated that he would “likely \nconclude that [it] . . . was not” because the steps the government has taken were “appropriate to \nensure . . . the reduced communication of the disease.”  Id. at 51.  In addition, Judge Nichols ruled \nthat J.B.B.C. had established that he was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a tem-\nporary restraining order and that the balance of harms and public interest weighed in favor of \ngranting the motion in light of the fact that only a single individual was at issue and he had no \nsymptoms of COVID-19.  Id. at 51–52. \nAlthough at the hearing, the parties in JBBC anticipated an expedited schedule for sum-\nmary judgment briefing (id. at 53–54 (“I will stress that I would like the merits briefing to move \nquickly.”); Order, JBBC, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. June 24, 2020), ECF No. 38 (giving the parties \nfive days to propose a summary judgment briefing schedule)), such briefing was ultimately unnec-\nessary.  On June 29, 2020, the parties filed a document stating that the government had “transferred \nthe custody of [J.B.B.C.] to the Office of Refugee Resettlement”—presumably pursuant to the \nTVPRA, which directs that “unaccompanied alien child[ren]” from non-contiguous countries who \nare in the custody of the federal government must be transferred to the custody of  that office “not \nlater than 72 hours after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child,” 8 U.S.C. § \n1232(b)(3); see also 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A) (describing the functions of the Office of Refugee \nResettlement)—“for immigration processing under Title 8 of the U.S. Code.”  Notice to the Court \nat 1, JBBC, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. June 29, 2020).  The government therefore planned to file a \nmotion to dismiss the case as moot.  Id.  On July 2, 2020, an amended complaint was filed, adding \n12 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 13 of 50\nE.Y., an unaccompanied non-citizen minor from Guatemala, as a plaintiff.  Amended Complaint, \nJBBC, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. July 2, 2020), ECF No. 42.  Declarations filed in connection with \nthe government’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint represented that both J.B.B.C. and \nE.Y. had been excepted from the Title 42 Process and transferred to the custody of the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement in order that their cases could proceed in immigration court.

July 23, 2020), \nECF No. 47-2.  Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on August 6, 2020.  \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice, JBBC, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. Aug. \n6, 2020), ECF No. 48. \nC.  Plaintiff’s Complaint and Subsequent Developments \nAccording to the Complaint, Plaintiff is a 15-year-old boy from an indigenous Mayan fam-\nily in Guatemala.  ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 77, 79.  His father resides in the United States and has a pending \nimmigration case.  Id., ¶ 78.  Plaintiff alleges that he fled Guatemala after being threatened with \ndeath due to his father’s political opinions and also because he refused to join a gang.  Id., ¶ 79.  \nHe entered the United States from Mexico and was apprehended by Border Patrol agents on or \naround August 11, 2020.  Id.  He was placed in custody in McAllen, Texas, and subjected to the \nTitle 42 Process.  Id.   \nThe Complaint further alleges that, according to Congressional testimony by the Acting \nCommissioner of Customs and Border Protection, as of June 25, 2020, “over 2,000 unaccompanied \nchildren had been deported under the Title 42 Process.”  Id., ¶ 70.  Correspondingly, the total \nnumber of children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement has plummeted: whereas \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 14 of 50\nin April, the office had 12,500 children in its custody, in May it had approximately 1,600 and in \nJune, approximately 975.  Id., ¶ 73. \nThe Complaint pleads seven causes of action:   \n(1)  The Title 42 Process violates mandatory provisions in the TVPRA relating \nto the processing, custody, release, and removal of unaccompanied children; \n \n(2)  The Title 42 Process was not authorized by Section 265, the provision under \nwhich it was purportedly established; \n \n(3)  The Title 42 Process violates provisions in the INA governing the processes \nby which a non-citizen can be granted withholding of removal; \n \n(4)    The Title 42 Process violates provisions in the INA governing the granting \nof asylum; \n \n(5)  The Title 42 Process violates the provision in the FARRA governing the \ndetermination of whether a non-citizen minor can be returned to a country \nwhere he is likely to face torture; \n \n(6)  The Title 42 Process violates provisions in the INA establishing the proce-\ndure by which the government may determine whether a non-citizen minor \nshould be removed; and \n \n(7)  Applying the Title 42 Process to unaccompanied minors constitutes arbi-\ntrary and capricious agency action because the government failed to articu-\nlate a reasoned explanation and to consider relevant factors in making the \ndecision to do so. \n \nECF No. 1, ¶¶ 108–146.  In the Complaint and in his simultaneously-filed motion for class certi-\nfication, Plaintiff seeks certification of a class comprising “[a]ll unaccompanied noncitizen chil-\ndren who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. government custody in the United States, and (2) are \nor will be subjected to the Title 42 Process”; he also requests appointment of class counsel.  Id. at \n30; see generally ECF No. 2-1.  He further seeks a declaration that the Title 42 Process is unlawful \nas applied to Plaintiff and the putative class and an order requiring Defendants to stay their expul-\nsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process and afford the protections of the TVPRA, \nINA, and FARRA.  ECF No. 1 at 30.    \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 15 of 50\n  On August 14, 2020, after Plaintiff filed this action and his counsel met and conferred with \ncounsel for the government, Defendants agreed not to subject Plaintiff to the Title 42 Process and \nto transfer him to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement—a program of the Department \nof Health and Human Services responsible for the care of unaccompanied non-citizen children in \nthe United States—to be processed pursuant to normal immigration procedures under Title 8 of \nthe U.S. Code.  ECF No. 15-1 at 20; ECF No. 44-2 at 28; see also ECF No. 14-1, ¶ 11.  Plaintiff \nis currently residing in a shelter run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.  ECF No. 52-1, ¶ 3.  \nThereafter, on August 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking an \norder enjoining Defendants from applying the Title 42 Process to the putative class members.  ECF \nNo. 15-2 at 1. \nII.  DISCUSSION \n  A.  Motion for Class Certification \nA party seeking class certification must show that it meets the “four threshold require-\nments” of Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: “(1) numerosity (a ‘class [so large] \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable’); (2) commonality (‘questions of law or fact common \nto the class’); (3) typicality (named parties' claims or defenses ‘are typical . . . of the class’); and \n(4) adequacy of representation (representatives ‘will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe class’).”  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997) (alterations in original) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)).  Where, as here, the plaintiff seeks certification of a class under \nRule 23(b)(2), he must also show that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declara-\ntory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 16 of 50\n  Plaintiff has clarified that, at this point, he seeks only provisional class certification.  ECF \nNo. 15-1 at 2, 10 n.1.  Although a plaintiff requesting provisional certification must still demon-\nstrate that Rule 23’s requirements are met, the court’s normally “rigorous analysis” is “tempered \n[ ] by the understanding that such certifications ‘may be altered or amended before the decision on \nthe merits.’”  Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. Supp. 3d 317, 329 (D.D.C. 2018) (first quoting Gen. Tel. \nCo. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982), then quoting Bame v. Dillard, No. 05-cv-1833, \n2008 WL 2168393, at *5 (D.D.C. May 22, 2008)); accord Kirwa v. Dep’t of Def., 285 F. Supp. 3d \n21, 44 (D.D.C. 2017); see also, e.g., Afghan and Iraqi Allies Under Serious Threat Because of \ntheir Faithful Service to the U.S. v. Pompeo, No. 18-cv-1388 (TSC), 2019 WL 367841, at *1 n.1 \n(D.D.C. Jan. 30, 2019) (granting provisional class certification “for the sole purpose of resolving” \na motion for preliminary injunction, a motion for partial dismissal, and a motion for expedited \ndiscovery). \n  As noted, Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of “[a]ll unaccompanied noncitizen children who \n(1) are or will be detained in U.S. government custody in the United States, and (2) are or will be \nsubjected to the Title 42 Process.”  ECF No. 1 at 30; ECF No. 2-1 at 7.  Defendants do not address \nwhether Plaintiff has made the required showing as to the first three Rule 23(a) requirements—\nnumerosity, commonality, and typicality—or the Rule 23(b) cohesiveness requirement, that the \ngovernment has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class.  Rather, the \ngovernment argues only that Plaintiff is not an adequate class representative because he has “al-\nready effectively received the individual relief he sought in this lawsuit: to be processed pursuant \nto Title 8’s immigration procedures as opposed to being expelled under the CDC Order[s].”  ECF \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 17 of 50\nNo. 44-2 at 28.  Nevertheless, the discussion below addresses each of the pertinent Rule 23 re-\nquirements.  See, e.g., Damus, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 329 (addressing each of the Rule 23 requirements \nbut only “briefly analyz[ing]” those that were uncontested). \n    1.  Numerosity \n  A putative class is sufficiently numerous to justify class action treatment when there are \nenough members that joinder would be impractical.  See, e.g., Amchem, 521 U.S. at 613.  “Gener-\nally speaking, courts have found that a proposed class of at least forty members will satisfy” this \nrequirement.  Bynum v. District of Columbia, 214 F.R.D. 27, 32 (D.D.C. 2003) (collecting cases).  \nMoreover, “classes including future claimants generally meet the numerosity requirement due to \nthe ‘impracticality of counting such class members, much less joining them.’”  JD v. Azar, 925 \nF.3d 1291, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (quoting 1 Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \n§ 3.15).  “[P]recise quantification of the class members is not necessary because the court may \nmake common sense assumptions to support a finding of numerosity.”  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 32 \n(quoting Civic Ass’n of Deaf of N.Y.C. v. Giuliani, 915 F. Supp. 622, 632 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)).  Thus, \nthe plaintiff must only provide a “reasonable basis for the estimate provided.”  Damus, 313 F. \nSupp. 3d at 330 (quoting Kifafi v. Hilton Hotels Retirement Plan, 189 F.R.D. 174, 176 (D.D.C. \n1999)).  \n  Here, Plaintiff has provided evidence, including government and news reports, that in the \nperiod between April and July 2020, almost 6,000 unaccompanied non-citizen children were ap-\nprehended at the southwest border; that more than 2,000 unaccompanied non-citizen children had \nbeen expelled from the United States pursuant to the Title 42 Process as of late June 2020; and \nthat, between June 24, 2020 (when Judge Nichols issued his ruling in JBBC) and August 14, 2020 \n(when the motion for class certification in this case was filed) counsel for Plaintiff have themselves \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 18 of 50\nidentified dozens of unaccompanied non-citizen children subject to the Title 42 Process.  ECF No. \n2-2 at 1–2, 11–29.  The undersigned thus finds that the numerosity requirement is met. \n    2.  Commonality \n  “The commonality requirement asks whether ‘there are questions of law or fact common \nto the class.’”  JD, 925 F.3d at 1321.  A class’ claims depend on a “common contention” such that \nthis requirement is met where “determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is \ncentral to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Id. (quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \nv. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)).  “[E]ven a single common question will do.”  Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 359. \n  This case challenges expulsion under the Title 42 Process, which is “a uniform policy or \npractice that affects all class members.”  RIL-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 181 (D.D.C. 2015) \n(quoting DL v. District of Columbia, 713 F.3d 120, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2013)).  Determination that the \nTitle 42 Process is not permitted by existing law because Section 265 does not provide authority \nfor expulsion of unaccompanied non-citizen children from the United States will resolve the core \nissue in this action “in one stroke.”  JD, 925 F.3d at 1321.  And “there [ ] is no evident variation \namong [the putative class members] concerning their ultimate entitlement to relief: if any person \nin the class has a meritorious claim, they all do.”  Id.  Therefore, the commonality requirement is \nmet.  \n    3.  Typicality \n  “[T]ypicality concerns the relationship between the representative’s individual claims and \nthe class’ claims rather than the relatedness of the entire class’ claims.”  Id. at 1322.  That is, “the \ntypicality requirement focuses on whether the representatives of the class suffered a similar injury \nfrom the same course of conduct” that injured the putative class members.  Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 19 of 50\n34.  Where “the claims or defenses of the representatives and the members of the class stem from \na single event or unitary course of conduct, or if they are based on the same legal or remedial \ntheory,” typicality is satisfied.  JD, 925 F.3d at 1322 (quoting 7A Mary Kay Kane, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure § 1764).  The claim Plaintiff has pleaded in the Complaint is on all fours with \nthe claims of the putative class.  They stem from a unitary course of conduct—expulsion of unac-\ncompanied non-citizen children from the United States under the Title 42 Process—and are based \non the same legal theories.  Hence, this requirement is also met. \n    4.  Adequacy \n  “Adequacy of representation imposes two criteria on plaintiffs seeking to represent a class: \n‘(1) the named representative must not have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the unnamed \nmembers of the class, and (2) the representative must appear able to vigorously prosecute the in-\nterests of the class through qualified counsel.’”  Ramirez v. ICE, 338 F. Supp. 3d 1, 47 (quoting \nTwelve John Does v. District of Columbia, 117 F.3d 571, 575 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).   \n  Defendants have not identified any interest that Plaintiff has that is antagonistic to or con-\nflicts with the putative class members and none are apparent.  Indeed, courts have found that where, \nas here, the plaintiff “seek[s] identical relief for all class members, [ ] there are no conflicting \ninterests that might derail certification on this prong.”  Coleman ex rel. Bunn v. District of Colum-\nbia, 306 F.R.D. 68, 84 (D.D.C. 2015) (Sullivan, J.).  The government instead argues that, it having \nvoluntarily excepted Plaintiff from expulsion under the Title 42 Process—as the government has \napparently done with all other unaccompanied non-citizen minors that Plaintiff’s counsel has \nbrought to its attention, including the two plaintiffs in JBBC (ECF No. 2-2 at 2–3)—Plaintiff is no \nlonger motivated to prosecute the interests of the class.  For that reason, the government contends \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 20 of 50\nthat “[t]here is no evidence that Plaintiff would vigorously pursue class claims, and his interest is \npresumably now focused on his own Title 8 immigration proceeding.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 28–29. \n  First, as Defendants recognize, “the D.C. Circuit has held that the fact that a putative class \nrepresentative’s case is moot at the time of certification does not alone moot the case or otherwise \nrender the putative class representative inadequate.”  Id. at 29 (citing JD, 925 F.3d at 1313).  In-\ndeed, “the Supreme Court has specifically recognized that a plaintiff with a moot claim may serve \nas a class representative.”  JD, 925 F.3d at 1313 (citing U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 \nU.S. 388, 404 (1980), and Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402–03 (1980)).  As Plaintiff points out, \nthe “short-lived duration” of a putative class representative’s claim “only reinforces [the claim’s] \ninherently transitory nature,” and makes certifying a class more appropriate, not less. JD, 925 F.3d \nat 1313 (noting further that “the ephemerality of individual claims makes class-action treatment \n‘particularly important’ so as to ‘ensur[e] that a justiciable claim is before the Court.’” (alteration \nin original) (quoting Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 268 (2003))).  That is precisely what hap-\npened in JD—the D.C. Circuit allowed two named plaintiffs to serve as class representatives not-\nwithstanding the fact that their claims were moot.6  JD, 925 F.3d at 1313.  And, in a declaration \nfiled with his Reply, Plaintiff has reaffirmed his willingness to act as class representative and to \n“vigorously pursue this case.”  ECF No. 52-1 at 1 (Declaration of P.J.E.S.).  Defendants’ specula-\ntion that Plaintiff’s attention is “presumably” focused elsewhere does not undermine that evidence.  \nSee, e.g., JD, 925 F.3d at 1313 (rejecting the government’s objection that the named plaintiffs with \nmoot claims were inadequate to represent the class where “beyond noting the mootness of [their] \nclaims, [it] identifie[d] no reason to doubt their ability to vigorously press the action”); Ramirez, \n                                                           \n6 Defendants do not claim that the entire action is moot because Plaintiff’s claim is moot.  Therefore, there is no need \nto address whether the exceptions to mootness for practices that are capable of repetition yet evading review or those \nthat the defendant has voluntarily ceased to engage in apply here. \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 21 of 50\n338 F. Supp. 3d at 47 (finding that the plaintiffs had met their burden to show that the proposed \nclass representatives were adequate based on “declarations attesting their willingness and abilities \nto take an active role in th[e] litigation and to protect the interests of absent plaintiffs”).  \n  Finally, the government has not suggested that counsel here is unqualified to act as class \ncounsel.  See, e.g., In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 292 F. Supp. 3d 14, 94–95 \n(D.D.C. 2017) (noting that a proposed representative is adequate if his interests do not conflict \nwith the interests of other class members and “he will vigorously prosecute the interests of the \nclass through qualified counsel” (quoting Lindsay v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co., 251 F.R.D. 51, 55 \n(D.D.C. 2008)).  Plaintiff is represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union and \nthe American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, who have submitted declarations \ndetailing their extensive experience in complex class actions, including class actions involving \nimmigration rights.  ECF No. 2-2, ¶¶ 13–33; ECF No. 2-3, ¶¶ 2–4.  The undersigned thus finds \nthat Plaintiff is an adequate class representative who, with his counsel, will vigorously pursue the \nclaims of the putative class.  See, e.g., Damus, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 331 (finding the adequacy re-\nquirement met where “[n]o trace of a conflict exist[ed] [ ], and Plaintiffs [were] represented by \nvery capable counsel from the American Civil Liberties Union . . . .”). \n    5.  Cohesiveness \n  Plaintiff seeks certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which, as noted, requires that (1) “the \nparty opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” \nand (2) “final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the \nclass as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).   “A principal purpose of Rule 23(b)(2) class actions \nis to enable class resolution of civil-rights claims alleging classwide deprivations of protected \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 22 of 50\nrights.”  JD, 925 F.3d at 1314.  Both of the Rule’s requirements are met here—a conclusion that \nthe government again does not contest. \n  First, the Complaint alleges that the government “has acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see ECF No. 1 at 25.  The gravamen \nof the claims here is that the government applied the allegedly illegal Title 42 Process to the puta-\ntive class members—indeed, the class definition makes clear that the class includes only unaccom-\npanied non-citizen minors who are or will be “subjected” to that process.  ECF No. 1 at 25, 30; \nECF No. 2-1 at 7.  That is sufficient.  See, e.g., Nio v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 323 F.R.D. 28, 34–\n35 (D.D.C. 2017) (finding that Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements were satisfied where the plaintiffs \n“challeng[ed] the application of standardized [immigration] policies that generally appl[ied] to the \nclass”).  Second, the Complaint seeks the same injunctive and declaratory relief for the entire \nclass—i.e., an injunction enjoining enforcement of the Title 42 Process against Plaintiff and the \nputative class members, an order requiring the government to remove Plaintiff and the putative \nclass members from that process, and a declaration that the Title 42 Process is unlawful as applied \nto Plaintiff and the putative class members.  ECF No. 1 at 30.  That, too, is sufficient.  See, e.g., \nRamirez, 338 F. Supp. 3d at 48 (finding that Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirements were met where the \nplaintiffs sought “injunctive relief requiring only [ ] compliance” with the TVPRA and not “a court \norder mandating any particular outcome with respect to any particular former unaccompanied mi-\nnor” under the statute). \n  For these reasons, Plaintiff’s motion for class certification should be provisionally granted. \n \n \n \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 23 of 50\n  B.  Preliminary Injunction \n  A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy” that “should be granted only when \nthe party seeking the relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Cobell v. Nor-\nton, 391 F.3d 251, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  To be entitled to a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff \n“must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an in-\njunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  \n“The first two factors of the [ ] standard are the most critical.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 \n(2009).  The last two factors—the balance of hardships and public interest—merge when the gov-\nernment is the party opposing the preliminary injunction.  Ctr. for Pub. Integrity v. Dep’t of Def., \n411 F. Supp. 3d 5, 14 (D.D.C. 2019) (citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 435). \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Plaintiff contends that Section 265, the provision upon which the CDC primarily relied to \npromulgate the Interim Final Rule and, by extension, the CDC Orders, does not authorize the gov-\nernment to expel him or the putative class members from the United States outside of the removal \nprocess of the INA and without other safeguards included in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, including \nspecial protection for unaccompanied minors mandated in the TVPRA and the ability to make an \nasylum claim.7  ECF No. 15-1 at 10–11; ECF No. 55-1 at 9.  He relies on interpretations of the \nvocabulary of Section 265, its context within the subsection of the Public Health Service Act it \noccupies, its relationship to other relevant statutes, and its legislative and enforcement history.  \n                                                           \n7 Plaintiff has requested that the Court defer ruling on its claim that the Interim Final Rule and the CDC Orders \nconstitute arbitrary and capricious agency action in light of the promulgation of the Final Rule, which will shortly \nbecome effective, and also because the Court does not have a full administrative record.  ECF No. 51-1 at 25.   Because \nthe undersigned finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims that the \nstatute at issue—Section 265—did not authorize expulsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process, the \nundersigned will not address that claim, consideration of which will benefit from access to the administrative record.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 24 of 50\nApplication of these traditional tools of statutory interpretation establish that Plaintiff is likely to \nprevail in his argument that the CDC Orders instituting the Title 42 Process exceed the authority \ngranted by Congress pursuant to Section 265.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842–43 & n.9 (stating \nthat, when a court “employing traditional tools of statutory construction” determines that a statute \nis unambiguous, it must “give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress” and “re-\nject administrative constructions which are contrary” to that intent).  \n  The “interpretation of [Section 265] ‘begins where all such inquiries must begin: with the \nlanguage of the statute.’”  U.S. Ass’n of Reptile Keepers, Inc. v. Zinke, 852 F.3d 1131, 1135 (D.C. \nCir. 2017) (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989)).  The pro-\nvision states that, when the CDC Director determines that a serious danger of the introduction of \na communicable disease that exists in a foreign country into the United States is “so increased by \nthe introduction of persons or property from such country that a suspension of the right to introduce \nsuch persons and property is required in the interest of public health,” then the CDC Director shall, \nin accordance with valid regulations, “have the power to prohibit, in whole or in part, the intro-\nduction of persons and property” from such countries for the amount of time he deems necessary \nto protect the public health.  42 U.S.C. § 265.   \nThe government has made clear, both in its briefing here and in the Final Rule, that it \ninterprets the word “introduction” to “suggest[ ] a continuing process that is most naturally read to \nextend beyond a person’s immediate physical crossing of the border” and that “to ‘prohibit . . . the \nintroduction’ naturally means to intercept or prevent such a process.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 31; see \nalso Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 56,425–56,426 (stating that the term “introduction” includes the \nsituation “when a person on U.S. soil moves further into the United States”). \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 25 of 50\nAssuming without deciding that the government’s interpretations of the word “introduc-\ntion” and the phrase “prohibit . . . the introduction” are legally sound,8 Defendants parsing of the \nplain text of the statute makes an unsupported (and unwarranted) logical leap at that point by as-\nserting that “[t]he statute’s reference to prohibiting the introduction ‘in whole or in part’ supports \nthe interpretation that a person may be intercepted and then quarantined in the United States or \nintercepted and then expelled.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 31(emphasis added); see also Final Rule, 85 Fed. \nReg. at 56,425–56,426 (stating that the phrase “prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction into \nthe United States of persons” includes the power of “physically expelling from the United States \nsome or all of the persons”).  Put simply, accepting that “to ‘prohibit . . . the introduction’” means \n“to intercept or prevent such a process” does not lead to the conclusion that “prohibition,” “inter-\nception,” or “prevention” includes “expulsion.”  Indeed, the primary definition of “prohibit” is “to \nforbid by authority or command,” to “enjoin” or “interdict,” Prohibit, Merriam-Webster Una-\nbridged Dictionary; of “intercept” is “to take, seize, or stop by the way or before arrival at the \ndestined place: stop or interrupt the progress or course of,” Intercept, Merriam-Webster Una-\nbridged Dictionary; of “prevent” is “to deprive of power or hope of acting, operating, or succeeding \nin a purpose,” Prevent, Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary. These each connote stopping \n                                                           \n8 Plaintiff has not conceded that they are so.  Rather, he has constructed an intricate argument contending that, because \n“[a]s a matter of ordinary language and usage,” relying on dictionary definitions of the word, “introducing a person \ninto a country or place is an action taken by a third party,” the use of the word “introduction” in the statute must be \n“directed not at individuals seeking to come to the United States, but rather those proposing to bring such individuals \nhere.”  ECF No. 15-1 at 25–26.  That interpretation is, according to Plaintiff, reinforced by the statutory context of the \n1893 Act, which was “shot through with provisions specifically directed at the regulation of ships”—that is, vessels \nthat were bringing “persons and property” into the country—whereas statutes authorizing deportations of people at \nthe time explicitly authorized the removal or return of the person.  Id. at 27. Moreover, examining the remarks of \nproponents of the 1893 Act in the Senate, Plaintiff finds evidence that they, too, were focused on the ships arriving in \nthe United States, rather than those arriving on their own steam at land borders.  Id. at 28.  Finally, Plaintiff notes that, \n“to [his] knowledge, the only time the [1893 Act] has been invoked to prohibit the introduction of persons was in \n1929, and it did not authorize deportations.”  Id. at 28–29 & n.10.  Thus, Plaintiff argues, Section 265 reflects that \nCongress designed the statute “as a means to stop travel from countries experiencing an outbreak of disease by regu-\nlating the transportation companies that bring people to the United States.”  Id. at 25.  The undersigned does not pass \non the soundness of that argument because there is a more direct route to determine the statute’s meaning, which is \ndiscussed below. \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 26 of 50\nsomething before it begins, rather than remedying it afterwards. That is reinforced by the title of \nthe Section 265: “Suspension of entries and imports from designated places to prevent spread of \ncommunicable diseases.”  42 U.S.C. § 265 (emphasis added); see Almendarez-Torres v. United \nStates, 523 U.S. 224, 234 (1998) (“[T]he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools \navailable for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.” (quoting Bhd. of R.R. Train-\nmen v. Balt. & Ohio R.R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528–29 (1947))).     \nThe government purports to find support for its interpretation that the statute encompasses \nthe authority to expel individuals from the United States in the phrase “in whole or in part”: “[t]he \nstatute’s reference to prohibiting the introduction ‘in whole or in part’ supports the interpretation \nthat a person may be intercepted and then quarantined in the United States or intercepted and then \nexpelled.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 31.  The government stretches the syntax of that clause well past its \nbreaking point.  Its argument works only if one believes that Congress, through the statutory lan-\nguage, intended “prohibit[ion] . . . in part” to mean “apprehension and quarantine” and “pro-\nhibit[ion][ ] in whole” to mean “apprehension and expulsion.”  But regular English usage does not \nconsider “prohibition”—or “introduction,” for that matter—to be a quantity that can be divided \ninto pieces.  There is a far more natural reading of the clause in its context: that the CDC Director \n“shall have the power to prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of persons and property \nfrom such countries or places as he shall designate,” 42 U.S.C. § 265, means that he may prohibit \nthe introduction of some persons or property from those places or all persons or property from \nthem.  That is, “in whole or in part” relates to the proportion of persons or property from designated \nplaces to be intercepted and denied entry; it does not purport to define the type of actions that the \nCDC Director may take in order to intercept and deny entry.  Surely, then, the most natural reading \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 27 of 50\nof the provision is that it contemplates interception to prevent an individual from arriving in the \nUnited States, rather than to expel him once he has arrived. \nIndeed, that interpretation is further supported by the statutory context.  FDA v. Brown & \nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132–33 (2000) (“It is a ‘fundamental canon of statutory \nconstruction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place \nin the overall statutory scheme.’” (quoting Davis v. Mich. Dep’t of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 \n(1989))).  Adjacent to Section 265 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 264 (“Section \n264”), entitled “Regulations to control communicable diseases,” is one of the provisions on which \nthe CDC relied in promulgating both the Interim Final Rule and the Final Rule.  See Interim Final \nRule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 16,563 (“In addition to section 362”—that is, 42 U.S.C. § 265—“other sec-\ntions of the [Public Health Service] Act are relevant to this rulemaking, including . . . 42 U.S.C. \nsection 264 . . . .”); Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 56,443 (same).  That provision addresses regula-\ntions that the government is “authorized to make and enforce . . . to prevent the introduction, trans-\nmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States or pos-\nsessions,” 42 U.S.C. § 264(a), that is, regulations governing situations similar to those addressed \nby Section 265.  Tellingly, Section 264 does not contemplate regulations that authorize expulsion \nfrom the United States.  Rather, the provision mentions only regulations that “provide for the ap-\nprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals.”9  42 U.S.C. § 264(b).  More, those \nregulations allow for the “apprehension, detention, examination, or conditional release of individ-\nuals” but only if the individual is “coming into a State or possession from a foreign country or \n                                                           \n9 As noted, conditional release is a public health tool that “involves the release of potentially infected individuals from \nfederal custody subject to conditions calculated to mitigate the risk of disease transmission, such as mandatory self-\nisolation and CDC monitoring at home.”  March 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,061. \n \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 28 of 50\npossession.”10  42 U.S.C. § 264(c).  Importantly, the power to expel such individuals from the \nUnited States is not mentioned.  That is, in a section where one would expect the term to appear—\nwhere Congress has delineated the government’s power to prevent the spread of contagious disease \nfrom individuals coming into the United States from a foreign country—it does not. \nIndeed, expulsion from the United States is nowhere mentioned in the statute.  The statute \nis shot through with references to quarantine—unsurprising given the provisions at issue are part \nof the Public Health Act and address the power of the Surgeon General to mitigate the risk of \ncontagious disease—but it contains not a word about the power of the Surgeon General to expel \nanyone who has come into the country.   See, e.g., 42 U.S.C., Chap. 6A, Subchap. II, Part G (enti-\ntled “Quarantine and Inspection.”); 42 U.S.C. § 267 (entitled “Quarantine stations, grounds, and \nanchorages”); 42 U.S.C. § 268 (entitled “Quarantine duties of consular and other officers”); 42 \nU.S.C. § 270 (entitled “Quarantine regulations governing civil air navigation and civil aircraft”); \n42 U.S.C. § 271 (entitled “Penalties for violation of quarantine laws”); 42 U.S.C. § 272 (entitled \n“Administration of oaths by quarantine officers”).  Even the provision governing “[s]pecial quar-\nantine powers in time of war” provides for only examination and detention—arguably the opposite \nof expulsion.  42 U.S.C. § 266.  The statute also prescribes the penalty for violating “any regulation \nprescribed under section 264 to 266” as punishment by fine or imprisonment of up to one year.   \n28 U.S.C. § 271(a).  Again, there is no mention of expulsion.   \nIt is unlikely then that, having repeatedly identified the tools the government can use to \nprevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases—none of which expressly include \n                                                           \n10 There is an exception allowing apprehension and examination of individuals already in the country but only if they \nare “reasonably believed” to be (1) “infected with a communicable disease in a qualifying stage” and either (2) “mov-\ning or about to move from a State to another State” or (3) “a probable source of infection to individuals who . . . will \nbe moving from a State to another State.”  42 U.S.C. § 264(d)(1).  Upon a finding that such an individual is infected, \nregulations may also provide for detention “for such time and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 264(d)(1). \n28 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 29 of 50\nexpulsion of individuals from the United States—Congress intended by that silence, and the lan-\nguage it chose for Section 265, to give the government that power.   A power which, as the Plaintiff \npoints out without contradiction from the Defendant, the government has not claimed in the more \nthan 75 years Section 265 was enacted.  ECF No. 15-1 at 28–29 & n.10.  “When an agency claims \nto discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power,” courts should “greet its announcement \nwith a measure of skepticism.”  Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (re-\njecting an agency’s interpretation of its governing statute when it claimed a significant expansion \nof regulatory authority “without clear congressional authorization”). \nThat interpretation is buttressed by the fact that, as Plaintiff points out, when Congress \nwants to grant the power to expel individuals out of the United States, it does so plainly.  Plaintiff \ncites statutes from as early as 1882 that explicitly authorize removal of individuals from the coun-\ntry.  The statute known as the Chinese Exclusion Act stated that “any Chinese person found un-\nlawfully within the United States shall be caused to be removed therefrom to the country from \nwhence he came” after a court had found that the individual was “not lawfully entitled to be or \nremain in the United States.”  An Act to Execute Certain Treaty Stipulations Relating to the Chi-\nnese, ch. 126, § 12, 22 Stat. 58, 61 (May 6, 1882).  A 1891 statute concerning the importation of \naliens under contract to perform labor provided that “all aliens who may unlawfully come to the \nUnited States shall, if practicable, be immediately sent back on the vessel by which they were \nbrought in” and that “any alien who shall come into the United States in violation of law may be \nreturned as by law provided.”  An Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration \nand the Importation of Aliens Under Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor, ch.551, §§ 10–11, \n26 Stat. 1084, 1086 (Mar. 3, 1891).  The same is true of modern statutes.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(2)(A), (C) (allowing an alien who has arrived on land from a contiguous country and who \n29 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 30 of 50\nis “not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted” to be “return[ed] . . . to that territory \npending a proceeding”); 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(1)(A) (“Except as otherwise provide in this section, \nwhen an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United \nStates within a period of 90 days . . . .”); 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(B) (allowing “an immigration of-\nficer who finds an unaccompanied alien child” who is a national or habitual resident of a contigu-\nous country “at a land border or port of entry of the United States and determines that such child \nis inadmissible” to “return such child to the child’s country of nationality or country of last habitual \nresidence”); 18 U.S.C. § 3186 (authorizing a fugitive from another country found in the United \nStates to be “take[n] [ ] to the territory of such foreign government” by an agent of that govern-\nment).  Moreover, as Plaintiff emphasizes, Congress has made clear when public health concerns \nmerit disallowing a non-citizen to remain in the United States.  Section 1182 of Title 8 makes \ninadmissible “[a]ny alien . . . who is determined (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services) to have a communicable disease of public health signif-\nicance.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1)(A)(i).  But Section 265 contains no such clear language, which \nindicates that Congress did not intend to grant that power.11  See JBBC Transcript at 49–50 (finding \nthat Section 265 does not “permit[ ] the return of individuals” to their home countries in part be-\ncause Congress did not use terms like “return” or “remove,” which are used in immigration stat-\nutes); cf. Epic Sys., __ U.S. at __, 138 S. Ct. at 1626 (noting other statutes in which Congress had \n                                                           \n11 Relying on a single statement in dicta from a 1983 Supreme Court case, the government argues that an “interpreta-\ntive approach” that looks to the language used in one statute to interpret the meaning of another has been “rejected.”   \nECF No. 44-2 at 15 (citing Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 25 (1983)).  Not so.  As Plaintiff points out, the \nSupreme Court regularly uses that “interpretive approach.”  ECF No. 51-1 at 15 (citing McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S. \nCt. 2452, 2462 (2020) (“History shows that Congress knows how to withdraw a reservation . . . .”); Rotkiske v. Klemm, \n__ U.S. __, __, 140 S.

Supp. 3d 81, 96 (D.D.C. 2019) (stating that the fact \nthat Congress “precisely legislated” in an area in one statute indicates that such power was not \ngranted by a different statute because “Congress knows how to speak on that subject when it wants \nto”), aff’d, 962 F.3d 531 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \nIndeed, the power the government claims under Section 265 is breathtakingly broad.  The \nInterim Final Rule notes that, by speaking of “persons,” rather than “non-citizens” or “aliens,” \nSection 265 also applies to citizens.  Interim Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 16,564.  The Final Rule \nalso indicates that Section 265 covers citizens.  Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. at 56,448.  The govern-\nment consequently admitted before Judge Nichols that the section authorizes the government to \nexpel even U.S. citizens who arrive from a foreign country during a pandemic.  JBBC Transcript \nat 26–27.  Yet, it is unlikely that Congress would grant the CDC Director the power to expel \ncitizens from the United States without making a clear statement to that effect.  Indeed, as Plaintiff \npoints out (ECF No. 15-1 at 23; ECF No. 51-1 at 12), the Supreme Court has stated that the power \nto remove a citizen from the country “must be affirmatively granted” in order to exist.  Valentine \nv. United States ex rel. Neidecker, 299 U.S. 5, 12 (1936).  Section 265 includes no such affirmative \ngrant.  And if Section 265 were read to include that power, it would raise serious constitutional \nissues.  See, e.g., Doe v. Mattis, 928 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (“A fundamental attribute of United \nStates citizenship is a ‘right to . . . remain in this country’ . . . .”) (first alteration in original) (quot-\ning Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133, 139 (1952))); Dessouki v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 915 F.3d 964, \n967 (3d Cir. 2019) (“The Executive cannot deport a citizen.”).

As the Supreme Court has instructed, “[i]f one [proposed statutory construction] would \nraise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail—whether or not those con-\nstitutional problems pertain to the particular litigant before the Court.”  Clark v. Suarez Martinez, \n543 U.S. 371, 380-81 (2005).   \nFurthermore, as Judge Nichols also found, Section 265 must be read in conjunction with \nstatutes governing immigration under Title 8 of the U.S. Code.  JBBC Transcript at 50 (“Even if \nthe power to remove were read [into] [S]ection 265, the plaintiff has [a] likelihood of success \nbecause the provision . . . should be harmonized, to the maximum extent possible, with immigra-\ntion statutes, including those . . . that grant special protections to minors and also those . . . that \ndeal with communicable diseases and quarantines.”).  The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed \nthat “[i]t is [a] [c]ourt’s duty to interpret Congress’ statutes as a harmonious whole rather than at \nwar with one another.”  Epic Sys., __ U.S. at __, 138 S. Ct. at 1619.  Here, if Section 265 is read \nto allow expulsion from the United States of unaccompanied minors like Plaintiff and the putative \nclass members, it conflicts with various rights granted in the TVPRA and the INA.12 \n                                                           \n12 The Complaint also claims that the Title 42 Process conflicts with provisions in FARRA, which implements Article \n3 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”).  \nECF No. 1, ¶¶ 130–136 (citing the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub.

The statute was passed “to enhance the efforts of the United States to \nprevent trafficking in persons,” specifically unaccompanied alien children in the United States.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(a)(1).  It imposes certain mandatory obligations on the government and provides \ncertain rights to unaccompanied alien minors, including that an unaccompanied alien child (other \nthan one from a contiguous country, to whom special rules apply) must be placed in removal pro-\nceedings under the INA and must be provided access to counsel.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D).  They \nmust also be transferred into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement within 72 hours \nafter it has been determined that the individual is an unaccompanied alien child.  8 U.S.C. § \n1232(b)(3); 6 U.S.C. § 279(a), (b)(1)(A); see also JD, 925 F.3d at 1300–02 (describing the \nTVPRA’s statutory scheme).  Second, the INA provides additional protections for non-citizens, \nincluding unaccompanied children.  Section 1231(b)(3) prohibits the removal of a non-citizen to a \ncountry where he is likely to face persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership \nin a particular social group, or political opinion.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).  The decision regarding \nwhether “the exclusion, deportation, or removal of an alien” to such country shall be withheld must \nbe made by an immigration judge.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a).  Similarly, the INA provides that “[a]ny \nalien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States . . . may \napply for asylum,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), with certain exceptions not relevant here.  Unaccompa-\nnied alien children are excepted from the one-year deadline that normally applies to asylum appli-\ncations and from the option to be removed to a third country where the asylee would not be subject \nto persecution and would have access to a fair asylum procedure.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), (B), \n(E).  It is undisputed that the summary expulsions of the Title 42 Process render these protections \nand procedures unavailable.  ECF No. 44-2 at 41–48. \n                                                           \n25.  Because the question of whether the Title 42 Process likely violates FARRA is unnecessary to the determination \nhere, the undersigned does not address it.    \n33 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 34 of 50\nThe government contends that Section 265 “takes precedence over the identified immigra-\ntion provisions.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 41.  But “[a] party seeking to suggest that two statutes cannot \nbe harmonized, and that one displaces the other, bears the heavy burden of showing ‘a clearly \nexpressed congressional intention’ that such a result should follow.”  Epic Sys., __ U.S. at __, 138 \nS. Ct. at 1624 (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. \nv. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U.S. 528, 533 (1995)).  The conventional way to signal that one statutory \nprovision is intended to override conflicting provisions is the construction, “Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law.”  See, e.g., Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Grp., 508 U.S. 10, 18 (1993) (“As we \nhave noted previously in construing statutes, the use of such a ‘notwithstanding’ clause clearly \nsignals the drafter’s intention that the provisions of the ‘notwithstanding’ section override con-\nflicting provisions of any other section.  Likewise, the Courts of Appeal generally have ‘interpreted \nsimilar “notwithstanding” language . . . to supersede all other laws, stating that “[a] clearer state-\nment is difficult to imagine.”’” (alterations in original) (internal citation omitted) (some internal \nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Liberty Mar. Corp. v. United States, 928 F.2d 413, 416 (D.C. \nCir. 1991))); see also, e.g., Epic Sys., __ U.S. at __, 138 S. Ct. at 1626 (“Congress has [ ] shown \nthat it knows how to override the Arbitration Act when it wishes—by explaining, for example, \nthat, ‘[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, . . . arbitration may be used . . . only if’ certain \nconditions are met . . . .” (some alterations in original) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2))). \nHere, the government attempts to find such a clear statement of congressional intent to \noverride the provisions of Title 8 of the U.S. Code in the statement Section 265’s language refer-\nring to a “suspension of the right to introduce such persons and property,” asserting that “[t]he \nphrase ‘suspension of the right to introduce’ [ ] naturally means the temporary cessation of the \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 35 of 50\neffect of any laws, including immigration laws, pursuant to which a person might otherwise claim \na right to be introduced into the United States.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 42.   \nDefendants’ argument is not likely to succeed.  The phrase in Section 265 is not “a clearly \nexpressed congressional intention,” Epic Sys., __ U.S. at __, 138 S. Ct. at 1624, that an order \npromulgated under that section can override conflicting provisions of Title 8 of the U.S. Code.  \nUnlike the “notwithstanding” clause that the Supreme Court has approved as sufficiently clear, the \nphrase contains no reference to the suspension of laws or specific rights.  Indeed, the examples the \ngovernment provides to support its notion that the term “suspension” overrides the operation of \nconflicting laws help to prove the opposite.  For example, Defendants cite 10 U.S.C. § 123(a), \nwhich allows—during wartime or national emergency—the President to “suspend the operation of \nany provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commis-\nsioner officers.”  ECF No. 44-2 at 42.  But that statute explicitly suspends the “operation of any \nprovision of law,” much like a “notwithstanding” clause explicitly identifies “any other provision \nof law.”  Similarly, the Suspension Clause of the Constitution specifically identifies the right sus-\npended by stating that “[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless \nwhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”  U.S. Const. art I, § 9, \ncl. 2, quoted in ECF No. 44-2 at 42.  In short, Defendants have not shown that the vague language \nof Section 265 evinces congressional intention to allow an order by the CDC Director to suspend \nthe operation of all immigration laws. \nDefendants’ remaining contentions are no more successful.  They cite the canon of statu-\ntory construction that a more specific provision targeting a particular issue will generally trump a \nprovision more generally covering the issue, arguing that Section 265 is more specific than the \nimmigration laws Plaintiff cites “because it applies only in a rare and specific circumstance.”  ECF \n35 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 36 of 50\nNo. 44-2 at 46.  That canon is most often applied when the two provisions “are interrelated and \nclosely positioned, both in fact being parts of [the same statutory scheme].”  RadLAX Gateway \nHotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (alterations in original) (quoting \nHCSC-Laundry v. United States, 450 U.S. 1, 6 (1981) (per curiam)).  That is not the case here.  \nMoreover, the immigration laws cited are clearly part of a “comprehensive scheme [that] has de-\nliberately targeted specific problems with specific solutions.”  RadLAX, 566 U.S. at 645 (quoting \nVarity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 519 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting)).  It is not clear how \nSection 265–which Defendants suggest is a broad grant of discretion to the CDC Director to reg-\nulate the introduction of communicable diseases into the United States (see, e.g., ECF No. 44-2 at \n14–15 (describing the “broad power” granted by Section 265))—could be considered more specif-\nically targeted to matters of immigration or as providing more specific solutions.   \nFinally, Defendants suggest that a reading of Section 265 that does not authorize the CDC \nDirector to issue orders allowing expulsion from the United States of unaccompanied non-citizen \nchildren outside the processes mandated by Title 8 of the U.S. Code renders the statute a nullity.  \nThat point requires little discussion.  Plaintiff’s concede that the CDC Director has authority to bar \nentry into the country, at least through the regulation of vessels (including airplanes) arriving in \nthe United States.  ECF No. 15-1 at 28–30 & n.9 (citing Criteria for Requesting Federal Travel \nRestrictions for Public Health Purposes, 80 Fed. Reg. 16,400 (Mar. 27, 2015), which addresses the \n“Do Not Board” list, “enabling domestic and international public health officials to request that \nindividuals with communicable diseases who meet specific criteria . . . be restricted form boarding \ncommercial aircraft arriving into, departing from, or traveling within the United States.”); ECF \nNo. 51-1 at 16; ECF No. 15-5 at 7 (attaching Executive Order No. 5143, which reads, “[I]n order \nto prevent the further introduction of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis form foreign ports into \n36 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 37 of 50\nthe United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 7 of the Act of Congress \napproved February 15, 1893 [now 42 U.S.C. § 265] . . . it is ordered that no persons may be intro-\nduced directly or indirectly by transshipment or otherwise into the United States or any of its pos-\nsessions or dependencies from any port in China (including Hong Kong) or the Philippine Is-\nlands . . . .”).  Again, those violating a barring order may be prosecuted and face up to one year of \nimprisonment.  42 U.S.C. § 271(a).  The CDC Director can also, pursuant to valid regulations, \napprehend, examine, quarantine, or conditionally release persons traveling into the United States \nfrom a foreign country.13 42 U.S.C. § 264(a), (c).  What the statute has not authorized him to do, \nhowever, is to summarily expel members of the class from the United States in derogation of its \nimmigration laws.  But as Plaintiff points out, that Section 265 “does not authorize this particular \ninvocation—an order singling out particular noncitizens, including unaccompanied children, and \noverriding protections for those individuals—does not [ ] make the statute meaningless.”14  ECF \nNo. 51-1 at 23.   \nThe fact that the government may believe that, without the power to summarily expel un-\naccompanied non-citizen children, Section 265 is not up to the task of preventing the introduction \nor spread of a communicable disease in the United States does not change the legal question of \nwhat the statute allows. “[A]gencies are ‘bound, not only by the ultimate purposes Congress has \n                                                           \n13 And presumably, while quarantined, the immigration process can go forward, including medical examination under \n8 U.S.C. § 1222(a) (authorizing examination and detention of aliens to determine whether they have a communicable \ndisease) and application of 8 U.S.C § 1182(a)(1)(i) (making inadmissible any alien who is determined to have a com-\nmunicable disease of public health significance).    \n \n14 For this reason, IRLI’s amicus brief misses the mark.  The organization argues that immigration statutes governing \nasylum, removal of non-citizens, and the trafficking of children in the INA and TVPRA do not implicitly repeal \nSection 265.  See generally ECF No. 48-1.  But there is no question of implicit repeal here because neither is Section \n265 “in irreconcilable conflict” with those immigration provisions—they can co-exist—nor were those immigration \nprovisions “clearly intended as a substitute” for Section 265.  Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 154 \n(1976) (identifying the “two well-settled categories of repeals by implication—(1) where provisions in the two acts \nare in irreconcilable conflict . . . ; and (2) [where] the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly \nintended as a substitute” (quoting Posadas v. Nat’l City Bank of N.Y., 296 U.S. 497, 503 (1936)). \n \n37 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 38 of 50\nselected, but by the means it has deemed appropriate, and prescribed, for the pursuit of those pur-\nposes.’”  Merck, 962 F.3d at 536 (quoting Colo. River Indian Tribes v. Nat’l Indian Gaming \nComm’n, 466 F.3d 134, 139–40 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  To the extent those means seem insufficient, \n“the proper approach under our system of separation of powers is for Congress to amend the stat-\nute, not for the Executive Branch and the courts to rewrite the statute beyond what the statute’s \nterms can reasonably bear.”  District of Columbia v. Dep’t of Labor, 819 F.3d 444, 450 (D.C. Cir. \n2016). \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim.15 \n  2.  Irreparable Injury \nTo show irreparable injury sufficient to merit a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must \nestablish that the injury is “certain and great” and “of such imminence that there is a ‘clear and \npresent need for equitable relief.’”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F. 3d \n290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985)).  That said, “a preliminary injunction requires only a likelihood of irreparable \ninjury[;] Damocles’ sword does not have to actually fall on all [plaintiffs] before the court will \nissue an injunction.”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8–9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n(internal citation omitted).  Plaintiff has met his burden on this requirement. \n                                                           \n15 Because the undersigned finds, “using the traditional tools of statutory construction,” that the statute is not ambig-\nuous, “that is the end of the matter” and there is no need to determine whether it is appropriate to defer to the agency’s \ninterpretation.  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842–43 & n.9.  However, even if there were ambiguity, the undersigned would \nfind, as did Judge Nichols, that deference to the government’s interpretation of the statute would not be justified.  \nJBBC Transcript at 50–51.  The question for this claim is purely legal: does Section 265 authorize expulsions from \nthe United States, or does it not? The CDC’s “scientific and technical knowledge” (ECF No. 33 & n.14) has no bearing \non that question of statutory interpretation. Cf. FedEx Home Delivery v. NLRB, 849 F.3d 1123, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(no deference where agency has “no special administrative expertise that a court does not possess” (quoting NLRB v. \nUnited Ins. Co. of Am., 390 U.S. 254, 260 (1968))); Kisor v. Wilkie, __ U.S. __, __, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2417 (2019) \n(“When the agency has no comparative expertise in resolving a regulatory ambiguity, Congress presumably would \nnot grant it that authority.”).   “[T]he ‘reconciliation’ of distinct statutory regimes ‘is a matter for the courts,’ not \nagencies.” Epic Sys., __ U.S. at __, 138 S. Ct. at 1629 (quoting Gordon v. N.Y. Stock Exch., Inc., 422 U.S. 659, 685-\n86 (1975)). \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 39 of 50\nPlaintiff has presented declarations from attorneys representing numerous unaccompanied \nchildren who have crossed the border and have bona fide clams for humanitarian relief, including \nfear of persecution on the basis of protected characteristics, but have been subjected to the Title 42 \nProcess and threatened with deportation prior to receiving any of the protections the immigration \nlaws provide.  See, e.g., ECF No. 15-10, ¶¶ 5–14 (declaration of attorney Linda Corchado); ECF \nNo. 15-11, ¶¶ 3–6 (declaration of attorney Taylor Levy); see also, e.g., ECF No. 15-12, ¶¶ 26–32 \n(declaration of Lisa Frydman, Vice President of International Programs at Kids in Need of De-\nfense, an advocacy and legal services organization).  Many come from El Salvador, Guatemala, \nand Honduras, dangerous countries in which children are often targeted for sexual and other vio-\nlence and face the possibility of torture and death.  ECF No. 15-12, ¶¶ 5–11.  Similar showings \nhave been held sufficient to demonstrate irreparable injury.  See, e.g., Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. \nSupp. 3d 96, 146 (D.D.C. 2018) (finding that declarations asserting fear of “rape, domestic vio-\nlence, beating, shootings, and death” in the plaintiffs’ countries of origin sufficed to establish like-\nlihood of irreparable injury), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds sub nom. Grace v. Barr, \n965 F.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020); Devitri v. Cronen, 289 F. Supp. 3d 287, 296–97 (D. Mass. 2018) \n(declaration asserting likelihood of persecution if removed sufficient); Orantes-Hernandez v. \nMeese, 685 F. Supp. 1488, 1504–05 (C.D. Cal. 1988) (finding that plaintiffs would suffer irrepa-\nrable harm if they were summarily removed without being afforded the opportunity to exercise \ntheir right to apply for asylum).  Indeed, Judge Nichols found a likelihood that a plaintiff similarly-\nsituated to Plaintiff here would likely suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.  \nJBBC Transcript at 51 (“It is certainly the case that plaintiff has not established that those harms \nare certain to occur, but there is at a minimum the risk that those harms, which are specified in \n39 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 40 of 50\nsome detail, could occur.  And so the Court concludes that the plaintiff has established . . . that he \nis likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an order here.”). \nThere is the additional risk that, once expelled from the United States, Plaintiff’s harm will \nno longer be remediable.  In other contexts, courts have found that the movement of a minor be-\nyond the jurisdiction of the court can constitute irreparable harm when it interferes with the ability \nof the court to provide relief.  See, e.g., Mendoza v. Pascual, No. CV 615-40, 2015 WL 1880309, \nat *5 (S.D. Ga. Apr. 24, 2015) (applying the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Interna-\ntional Child Abduction); Velasquez v. Velasquez, No. 14-cv-1688, 2014 WL 7272934, at *5 (E.D. \nVa. Dec. 15, 2014) (finding that petitioner had shown irreparable harm from the possibility that \nhis children would be removed from the jurisdiction because that would “frustrate the effort of \nth[e] Court in resolving the [dispute]”).  To be sure, in Nken, the Supreme Court held that “the \nburden of removal alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.”  556 U.S. at 435.  But \nthat holding rested on the ability of a removed alien to “continue to pursue [a] petition[ ] for review \n[of the removal order],” which afforded the opportunity to return to the United States “with a \nrestoration of the immigration status” the alien had enjoyed upon removal.  Id.  Here, however, the \nputative class members are being returned without any opportunity to apply for asylum or with-\nholding of removal.  Once expelled from the United States and outside the  jurisdiction of the \nCourt, it is not clear that a remedy can be provided.16  Cf. Doe, 928 F.3d at 22 (finding irreparable \nharm likely to flow from the transfer of a dual citizen detained in Iraq to an unidentified third \n                                                           \n16 That is precisely the argument the government has made in a different case in this jurisdiction challenging the \nTitle 42 Process.  In GYJP v. Wolf, the plaintiff, an unaccompanied 13-year-old girl from El Salvador, crossed into \nthe United States and was apprehended by Customs and Border Patrol officers.  Complaint, ¶¶ 76–80, GYJP, No. 20-\ncv-1511 (TNM) (D.D.C. June 9, 2020), ECF No. 3.  Approximately six days later, she was expelled from the United \nStates pursuant to the Title 42 Process and flown back to El Salvador. Id., ¶¶ 80–85.  In that litigation, the government \nhas taken the position that the court is without jurisdiction to hear the case because the plaintiff lacks constitutional \nstanding.  See generally Motion to Dismiss, GYJP, No. 20-cv-1511 (TNM) (D.D.C. Aug. 17, 2020), ECF No. 38. \n40 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 41 of 50\ncountry because he would then be in the custody of that third country “without continuing over-\nsight by—or recourse to—the United States”). \nLastly, “[i]t is well-established that acts by [g]overnment agencies in derogation of statu-\ntory rights of the public or certain individual members of the public can constitute irreparable \ninjury.” Kirwa, 285 F. Supp. 3d at 42 n.22 (quoting Gates v. Schlesinger, 366 F. Supp. 797, 800 \n(D.D.C. 1973)); see also JL v. Cissna, 341 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1068 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (identifying \nmultiple common harms resulting from deprivation of right to seek humanitarian benefits for \nabused, abandoned, and neglected juveniles); Tefel v. Reno, 972 F. Supp. 608, 619–20 (S.D. Fla. \n1997) (“[T]he Court finds . . . that Plaintiffs and class members would suffer irreparable harm if \nthey are deported to their native countries after having been denied an opportunity to have a hear-\ning on their claims for suspension of deportation.”).  In light of the finding above in Section II.B.1 \nthat the claim that expulsion under the Title 42 Process exceeds the authority granted by Sec-\ntion 265 is likely to succeed, this is a clear harm that each member of the putative class has suffered \nor will suffer.  Therefore, the undersigned finds that Plaintiff has adequately established a likeli-\nhood of irreparable injury should a preliminary injunction not issue. \n3.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest   \nBeyond the irreparable harm that Plaintiff and members of the putative class will suffer \nwithout an injunction, the balance of the equities also favors Plaintiff.  See Costa v. Bazron, No. \n19-3185 (RDM), 2020 WL 2025701, at *8 (D.D.C. Apr. 25, 2020) (“[W]here the government is a \nparty to the suit, the harm to defendants and the public interest merge and ‘are one and the same, \nbecause the government’s interest is the public interest.” (quoting Pursuing America’s Greatness \nv.

Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 165 (1944).  \nAdditionally, the government has failed to take into account the harm to the public interest \nin continuing its current practice of housing unaccompanied non-citizen minors in hotels while \nthey await expulsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process—a practice that would end \nif an injunction issued requiring Plaintiff and the putative class to be excepted from expulsion from \nthe United States under the Title 42 Process.

Cal. 2020) (noting that the question \nbefore that court is the practice of holding minors detained pursuant to the Title 42 Process in \nhotels prior to expulsion and “not . . . the validity of Title 42 expulsions”), appeal docketed, No. \n20-55951 (9th Cir. Sept. 10, 2020), the court found that the government had “failed to demonstrate \nhow hotels, which are otherwise open to the public and have unlicensed staff coming in and out, \nlocated in areas with high incidence of COVID-19, are any better for protecting public health than \n43 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 44 of 50\nlicensed facilities would be” and that “[e]ven if the infection control protocols at [the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement] come under some stress, or are forced to make some adjustments,” the \nprogram’s facilities are likely to “remain far safer than unregulated hotel stays for both detained \nminors and the general public,” In Chambers Order at 4, Flores, No. CV 85-4544 DMG (AGRx) \n(C.D. Cal Sept. 21, 2020), ECF No. 990 (quoting Flores, __ F. Supp. 3d at __, 2020 WL 5491445, \nat *6). \nAgainst these arguments, Defendants first assert that an injunction against the Title 42 Pro-\ncess would make officers at the border less safe, noting that many such officers have contracted \nCOVID-19 and several have died.  To be sure, “[i]t goes almost without saying . . . that promoting \npublic health—especially during a pandemic—is in the public interest,” and the premature loss of \nany life is tragic.  Nat’l Immigr. Project of Nat’l Lawyers Guild v. Exec. Off. of Immigr. Rev., No. \n1:20-cv-00852 (CJN), __ F. Supp. 3d __, __, 2020 WL 2026971, at *12 (D.D.C. 2020).  But the \ngovernment’s proof that the preliminary injunction Plaintiff seeks would endanger Customs and \nBorder Patrol officers more than the Title 42 Process is, ultimately, unavailing.  The measure of \nthe public interest and hardship to the government depends on the injunction proposed.  Here, \ndenying the government the power to expel unaccompanied minors does not leave the government \npowerless to address the pandemic.  As discussed above in Section II.B.1, the government has \nmany options available to it.  It has tools at its disposal to limit entry into the country and can \napprehend, examine, quarantine, or conditionally release unaccompanied minors.  The real issues \nare potential exposure to the virus at congregation points and operational costs—as the government \nadmits—of mitigating that risk through effective quarantine and/or conditional release and moni-\ntoring of putative class members who enter the country unlawfully.  See, e.g., ECF No. 44-2 at 24, \n57; March 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 17,066–17,067; May 20 Order, 85 Fed. Reg. at 31,508, n.32.  \n44 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 45 of 50\nBut the government’s argument is suspect given that the alternative to quarantine that they pro-\npose—expulsion pursuant to the Title 42 Process—results in unaccompanied minors often being \ndetained longer while awaiting expulsion than they would otherwise be, and the concomitant \nlengthened exposure of class members to other non-citizens, Customs and Border Patrol officers, \nand local medical personnel.  Plaintiff has provided a report from an independent monitor filed in \nthe Flores litigation that found expelling children from the United States under the Title 42 Process \ntakes an average of five days, “with a substantial number of children experiencing extended stays \nof more than 10 days,”  (ECF No. 52-3 at 30), as opposed to the 72 hours mandated under the \nTVPRA for transfer to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, see 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3) (under nor-\nmal process, Homeland Security must transfer children within 72 hours to the custody of the Office \nof Refugee Resettlement).  This longer period would appear to subject Customs and Border Patrol \nofficers to greater risk from unaccompanied non-citizen children—and, indeed, vice-versa—than \nthe prior process.  \nNext, Defendants rely on a declaration from Jallyn Sualog, the Deputy Director of the Of-\nfice of Refugee Resettlement, submitted with the government’s opposition to the current motions.  \nMs. Sualog attests to particular concern about the number of unaccompanied non-citizen children \nthat the Office of Refugee Resettlement “can safely absorb into the system at one time,” asserting \nthat the program “would likely come under significant stress if [it] were to begin to receive on a \nregular basis approximately 75 to 100 referrals of [unaccompanied minor children] per week, with \napproximately 30% of [them] having tested positive or been exposed to COVID-19.”  ECF No. \n42-5 at 4; ECF No. 44-2 at 56.  In Flores, Judge Gee recently addressed whether the very same \nassertions by the very same declarant made out a likelihood of harm to the government and found \n45 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 46 of 50\nthem wanting.  She found that the underlying factual contentions—that there would be an addi-\ntional 75 to 100 referrals per week, of whom 30 percent would need to be isolated or quarantined—\nwere “highly speculative,” noting that the government failed to support its assumptions with a \ndeclaration from a public health official providing “scientific or empirical analysis” to support the \nstatements.  In Chambers Order at 3, Flores, No. CV 85-4544 DMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal Sept. 21, \n2020), ECF No. 990.  In a supplemental declaration, Ms. Sualog asserts that between September \n1, 2020, and September 16, 2020, the Office of Refugee Resettlement received 568 referrals of \nunaccompanied non-citizen children, 2 of whom were COVID-19 positive and 170 of whom were \nCOVID-19 exposed, which works out to 30 percent.17  ECF No. 58-1 at 6.  It is not disputed, \nhowever, that, at the present time, the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s care-provider facilities are \noperating at well below capacity and they have thousands of beds available.  ECF No. 42-5, ¶ 31–\n32.  Judge Gee specifically found that “there are sufficient numbers of currently under-utilized \n[Office of Refugee Resettlement] facilities such that transfers can be allocated among facilities to \navoid over-concentration or bottlenecking.”  In Chambers Order at 4, Flores, No. CV 85-4544 \nDMG (AGRx) (C.D. Cal Sept. 21, 2020), ECF No. 990. \nThe undersigned appreciates that, in light of the pandemic, a preliminary injunction will \nimpose hardships on the government and may force it, as it has all Americans, to make difficult \ndecisions about allocation of resources to mitigate the risks caused by COVID-19.  Federal courts \nare not empowered to reorganize agencies’ priorities when those agencies are acting within the \nbounds prescribed by Congress.  Here, however, the public’s interest in ensuring that those bounds \nare honored—the “overriding public interest” in the “importance of an agency’s faithful adherence \nto its statutory mandate,” Jacksonville Port Auth., 556 F.2d at 59—coupled with its interest in \n                                                           \n17 Ms. Sualog indicates that the government measures “exposure” based on the unaccompanied minors’ self-report \nconcerning their travel history.  ECF No. 42-5, ¶ 20; ECF No. 58-1 at 21.   \n46 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 47 of 50\nprotecting children from being “deliver[ed] [ ] into the hands of their persecutors,” E. Bay Sanctu-\nary Covenant, 950 F.3d at 1281, weigh in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction in this case. \n  4.  Breadth of Injunction and Bond \nThe undersigned has found that all four factors to be considered when deciding a motion \nfor a preliminary injunction weigh in favor of granting the motion.  The question then becomes \nthe breadth of that preliminary injunction.  In his Reply, Plaintiff notes that the Interim Final Rule, \nunder which the CDC Orders here were issued, will be superseded by the Final Rule on the earlier \nof two dates: October 11, 2013, or the date that the Interim Final Rule “ceases to be in effect,” \nbecause it has been “vacated or enjoined by a court.”  ECF No. 51-1 at 32 (citing 85 Fed. Reg. at \n56,424).  He therefore asks that, if the Court issues a preliminary injunction, it “specify that [the \ninjunction] encompass the Final Rule and any substantially similar CDC Order granted under its \nterms.”  ECF No. 51-1 at 32. \nAs should be clear from the discussion above, there is no relevant material difference be-\ntween the CDC Director’s authority under the Final Rule and the authority that the government \nhas here argued he enjoys under the Interim Final Rule.  The Final Rule interprets “‘[p]rohibit, in \nwhole or in part, the introduction into the United States of persons’ to mean ‘to prevent the intro-\nduction of persons into the United States by suspending any right to introduce into the United \nStates, physically stopping or restricting movement into the United States, or physically expelling \nfrom the United States some or all of the persons.’”  85 Fed. Reg. at 56,425 (alteration in original) \n(emphasis added).  That is precisely the interpretation the government urged here in connection \nwith the Interim Final Rule and the CDC Orders.  ECF No. 44-2 at 14–15 (“The statute grants the \nExecutive Branch ‘the power to prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of persons’ into the \nUnited States during an outbreak of a communicable disease in order to avert the danger of the \n47 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 48 of 50\ndisease spreading into the United States.  By granting that broad power, Congress necessarily gave \nthe Executive Branch the authority to take actions needed to exercise that power.  That in-\ncludes . . . the power to promptly expel persons who managed to surreptitiously cross over the U.S. \nborder from a designated foreign country in violation of a Section 265 order and then are halted \nwhile in the process of moving into the interior.”  (internal citation omitted) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § \n265) (emphasis added).  The undersigned agrees with Plaintiff that the preliminary injunction \nshould be crafted to make clear that it prohibits expulsion from the United States under the Title \n42 Process whether that conduct has been permitted in orders issued by the CDC Director pursuant \nto the authority of the Interim Final Rule or the Final Rule. \nPlaintiff also asks the Court not to require him to post a bond pursuant to Rule 65(c) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  That rule states that “[t]he court may issue a preliminary injunc-\ntion . . . only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the \ncosts and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 65(c).  “Courts in this Circuit have found the Rule ‘vest[s] broad discretion in the district court \nto determine the appropriate amount of an injunction bond,’ including the discretion to require \nno bond at all.”  Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2012) (Sullivan, \nJ.) (internal citation omitted) (quoting DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. \n1999)); see also Council on Am.-Islamic Relations v. Gaubatz, 667 F. Supp. 2d 67, 81 (D.D.C. \n2009) (same).  In determining the appropriateness or amount of a bond, courts take into account \nthe financial wherewithal of the party seeking the preliminary injunction and whether the action \nseeks to enforce important federal rights or public interests.  See, e.g., Carranza v. Reams, No. 20-\nCV-00977, 2020 WL 2320174, at *14 (D. Colo. May 11, 2020); Booth v. Galveston Cty., No. 3:18-\nCV-00104, 2019 WL 4305457, at *2 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 11, 2019); Flack v. Wis. Dep’t of Health \n48 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 49 of 50\nServs., 328 F. Supp. 3d 931, 955 (W.D. Wis. 2018); Simms, 872 F. Supp. 2d at 107.  Here, Plaintiff, \na 15-year-old boy from Guatemala allegedly fleeing persecution in his home country and seeking \nto represent a class including similarly-situated children, does not have the ability to post a bond.  \nAdditionally, this action seeks to vindicate important rights granted under immigration laws. The \nundersigned therefore recommends that the Court waive the requirement for an injunction bond or \nrequire a nominal amount.  See, e.g., Page Commc’ns Eng’rs, Inc. v. Froehlke, 475 F.2d 994, 997 \n(D.C. Cir. 1973) (recognizing the court’s “discretion to fix bond in a nominal amount”); cf. Laster \nv. District of Columbia, 439 F. Supp. 2d 93, 99 (D.D.C. 2006) (suggesting that where, as here, the \ndefendant did not request a bond, none is required).   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff’s Motion for \nClass Certification (ECF No. 2) be PROVISIONALLY GRANTED and the Court provisionally \ncertify a class pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure con-\nsisting of all unaccompanied noncitizen children who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. govern-\nment custody in the United States, and (2) are or will be subjected to expulsion from the United \nStates under the Title 42 Process, whether pursuant to an Order issued by the Director of the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention under the authority granted by the Interim Final Rule, 85 \nFed. Reg. 16559-01, or the Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 56,424-01.  The undersigned FURTHER \nRECOMMENDS that Plaintiff be appointed as Class Representative and that Plaintiff’s counsel \nfrom the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project be appointed as Lead Class Counsel and his other \ncounsel be appointed as Class Counsel. \n  The undersigned FURTHER RECOMMENDS that Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary \ninjunction (ECF No. 15-2) be GRANTED and that the Court order that Defendants, their agents, \n49 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 65   Filed 09/25/20   Page 50 of 50\nand any person acting in concert with them are enjoined from expelling the Class Members from \nthe United States under the Title 42 Process, whether pursuant to an Order issued by the Director \nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the authority granted by the Interim Final \nRule, 85 Fed. Reg. 16559-01, or the Final Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 56,424-01. \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe parties are hereby advised that under the provisions of Local Rule 72.3(b) of the United \nStates District Court for the District of Columbia and the Minute Order of Judge Sullivan entered \nin this case on September 6, 2020, any party who objects to the Report and Recommendation must \nfile a written objection thereto with the Clerk of this Court within 7 days of the party’s receipt of \nthis Report and Recommendation.  The written objections must specifically identify the portion of \nthe report and/or recommendation to which objection is made, and the basis for such objections.  \nAny oppositions shall be due no later than 7 days after being served with a copy of the objections; \nand replies shall be due no later than 5 days after being served with a copy of the opposition.  The \nparties are further advised that failure to file timely objections to the findings and recommenda-\ntions set forth in this report may waive their right of appeal from an order of the District Court that \nadopts such findings and recommendation.

The Government renews its request that the Court \nstay its preliminary injunction issued on November 18, 2020, \ncontending that, inter alia, (1) given the rise in COVID-19 \ninfections in States along the southern border, \"enjoining the CDC \nOrder [that allows for the expulsion of class members pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 265] at this juncture would create or exacerbate \nconditions conducive to further COVID-19 outbreaks,\" Gov't's \nMot., ECF No. 82 at 9-10; (2) the increase in the number of \nunaccompanied minors, could lead to \"hospital systems in some \nlocalities \" to be overwhelmed; id. at 11; and (3) the \"recent \nincreases in the number of referrals to\" the Office of Refugee \nResettlement (\"ORR\"), during the pandemic, could lead to \"greater \nchallenges in accommodating the expected increases in referrals of \ncovered minors,\" and potentially force ORR transport class \nmembers further inland, id. at 12-15. The Government states that it \nis \"not seeking reconsideration of this Court's order granting \nPlaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, ECF No. 15, or \nprovisionally granting Plaintiff's motion to certify a class, ECF No. \n2.\" Gov't's Mot., ECF No. 82 at 4 n.2. In opposition, the Plaintiff \nargues that \"[the Government's] failure to contest the Court's \nmerits ruling is an arguably fatal flaw for a stay application and \nshould be determinative here... particularly given [the \nGovernment's] additional failure to contest the irreparable harm to \nthe children.\" Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 84 at 5 (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted). Plaintiff also contends that (1) no class \nmember in ORR custody has required hospitalization due to \nCOVID-19, see id. at 5; (2) the Government's speculation that \nthere will be an increase in the number of unaccompanied children \nentering the country \"is riddled with inconsistencies and \nmisdirection,\" id. at 7; and (3) the Government has \"not \ndemonstrated that [U.S. Customs & Border Protection] or ORR \nfacilities lack additional capacity to hold children even if the \n\nnumbers substantially increase,\" id. at 9. In this Court, motions for \nreconsideration pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure are examined under the \"standard set forth in \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e)\". United States v. Fareri, \nNo. CR 09-54 (EGS), 2018 WL 8754169, at *2 (D.D.C. Oct. 19, \n2018) (Sullivan, J.). Under that standard, a Rule 59(e) motion-and \nin this case a 54(b) motion-\"need not be granted unless the district \ncourt finds that there is an intervening change of controlling law, \nthe availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error \nor prevent manifest injustice.\" Id. As the Government is requesting \nthat the Court reconsider its denial of a stay of its November 18, \n2020 preliminary injunction, the Court will review the \nGovernment's motion using the factors governing the granting of a \nstay pending an appeal. A \"stay pending [an] appeal is always an \nextraordinary remedy,\" United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., \n449 F. Supp. 2d 988, 990 (D.D.C. 2006) (internal citation and \nquotation marks omitted); and the \"party requesting a stay bears \nthe burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of \nthat discretion,\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 43334 (2009). In \ndetermining whether to grant a stay pending an appeal, a Court \nmust consider \"(1) whether the applicant has made a strong \nshowing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the \napplicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether \nissuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\" \nNken, 556 U.S. at 34. Of these, the \"first two factors of the \ntraditional standard are the most critical.\" Id. Here, the \nGovernment clearly has not met its burden. Even though the \"first \ntwo factors of the traditional [stay] standard are the most critical,\" \nid.; the Government does not even consider the first stay factor-\nlikelihood of success on the merits, see generally, Gov't's Mot., \nECF No. 82-nor does it sufficiently explain how it will be \n\"irreparably injured absent a stay,\" see id. (stating only \"any \nincrease in the transfer of class members into [border] States' \nhealth care systems is likely to cause irreparable harm to the \npublic\"). The Government also fails to address the final two \nfactors- whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the \nother parties interested in the proceeding, and where the public \ninterest lies. See generally, Gov't's Mot., ECF No. 82. Because the \nCourt finds that the Government did not note any intervening \nchange of controlling law, provide sufficient new evidence \nconcerning the stay factors, or point out any clear error or manifest \ninjustice, see Fareri, 2018 WL 8754169, at *2, it is ORDERED \nthat the Government's motion for reconsideration, ECF No. 82, is \nDENIED.

In light of further de-\nvelopments, both in the courts and in the Executive Branch, the government has moved to dismiss \nthis case as moot.  Plaintiff now asks that Defendants’ motion be held in abeyance.  For the reasons \nbelow, Plaintiff’s motion is granted and this case is stayed. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nSection 265 provides that, when there is a serious danger of importation into the United \nStates of a communicable disease from a foreign country that “is so increased by the introduction \n \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 2 of 13\nof persons or property from such country that a suspension of the right to introduce such persons \nand property is required in the interest of the public health,” the government has “the power to \nprohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of persons and property from such countries or places \nas [it] shall designate in order to avert such danger, and for such period of time as [it] may deem \nnecessary for such purpose.”  42 U.S.C. § 265.   In March 2020, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, \nthe government (via the Department of Health and Human Services) issued an interim final rule \n(the “Interim Final Rule”) under the statute, which authorized the Director of the CDC to “suspend \nthe introduction of persons into the United States.”  PJES ex rel. Francisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. \n3d 492, 503 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Control of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: \nSuspension of Introduction of Persons Into United States From Designated Foreign Countries or \nPlaces for Public Health Purposes, 85 Fed. Reg. 16559-01, 16563, 2020 WL 1330968 (Mar. 24, \n2020)); see also Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, __ F. Supp. 3d __, 2022 WL 16948610, at *1 \n(D.D.C. 2022) [hereinafter, Huisha-Huisha II] (same), appeal docketed, No. 22-5325 (D.C. Cir. \nDec. 9, 2022); see also Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 560 F. Supp. 3d 146, 157 (D.D.C. 2021) \n[hereinafter, Huisha-Huisha I] (same), aff’d in part and remanded, 27 F.4th 718 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n[hereinafter, Huisha-Huisha III]; see also Louisiana v.

May 23, 2022). \n  Under the authority of the Interim Final Rule, the CDC issued orders “suspending . . . the \nintroduction of ‘covered aliens,’ . . . defined as ‘persons traveling from Canada or Mexico (regard-\nless of their country of origin) who would otherwise be introduced into a congregate setting in a \nland Port of Entry . . . or Border Patrol station at or near the United States borders with Canada \nand Mexico.’”  Huisha-Hiusha II, __ F. Supp. 3d at __, 2022 WL 16948610, at *2 (quoting Notice \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 3 of 13\nof Order Under Sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act Suspending Introduction of \nCertain Persons from Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. 17060-02, \n17061, 2020 WL 1445906 (Mar. 26, 2020)); see also id. at __, 2022 WL 16948610, at *3 (discuss-\ning the two extensions of that rule in April 2020 and May 2020).  Under the authority of those \norders, a number of “covered noncitizens,” including asylum seekers and unaccompanied children, \nwere detained pending expulsion and/or expelled from the United States.  See Huisha-Huisha I, \n560 F. Supp. 3d at 159; PJES, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 505–506.  \n  Plaintiff filed this action in August 2020 and sought certification of a class of “[a]ll unac-\ncompanied noncitizen children who (1) are or will be detained in U.S. government custody in the \nUnited States, and (2) are or will be subjected to the Title 42 Process,” and followed up one week \nlater a motion for a class-wide preliminary injunction.  PJES, 502 F. Supp. 3d at 509 (citing ECF \nNo. 2 at 1).  One week later, he filed a motion for a preliminary injunction arguing that “Section \n265 ‘does not authorize deportation’”; that “‘unaccompanied children are entitled to explicit stat-\nutory procedures and protections,’” such as those included in the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1232; and that “‘subjecting Class Members to the CDC Orders is arbitrary and capricious \nin violation of the’ [Administrative Procedures Act (‘APA’)].”  Id. at 510 (quoting ECF No. 15-1 \nat 21); see also id. at 534–35.   \n  In September 2020, the government issued a final rule (the “Final Rule”) that, in relevant \npart, reaffirmed its authority to expel certain individuals under Section 265.  See id. at 505 (citing \nControl of Communicable Diseases; Foreign Quarantine: Suspension of the Right to Introduce \nand Prohibition of Introduction of Persons into United States from Designated Foreign Countries \nor Places for Public Health Purposes, 85 Fed. Reg. 56424-01, 2020 WL 5439721 (Sept. 11, 2020), \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 4 of 13\ncodified at 42 C.F.R. § 71.40); see also id. at 520 (“[T]here is no relevant material difference \nbetween the CDC Director’s authority under the Final Rule and the authority that the government \nhere has argued he enjoys under the Interim Final Rule.” (citing ECF No. 65 at 47–48)).  In October \n2020, the CDC replaced its earlier orders with a new order exercising that power.  See Huisha-\nHuisha I, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 158 (citing Order Suspending the Right to Introduce Certain Persons \nfrom Countries Where a Quarantinable Communicable Disease Exists, 85 Fed. Reg. 65806, \n65808, 2020 WL 6081986 (Oct. 16, 2020)). \n  In November 2020, Judge Sullivan provisionally certified the proposed class in this case \nand granted Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.  See generally PJES, 502 F. Supp. 3d \nat 501–21.  He found that Plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of his argument that neither \n“the vocabulary of Section 265, its context within the subsection of the Public Health Service Act \nit occupies, its relationship to other relevant statutes, [nor] its legislative and enforcement history” \nauthorized the expulsion of the class members from the United States and, therefore, the rules and \norders at issue “exceed[ed] the authority granted by Congress” in the statute.  Id. at 534–35; see \nalso id. at 510–16.  He further found that class members were likely to suffer irreparable injury in \nthe absence of a preliminary injunction and that the balance of the equities and the public interest \nfavored granting Plaintiff’s motion.  See id. at 516–20.  The government appealed that decision \nand, in January 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted its motion to stay the district court’s order pending \ndisposition of the appeal.  PJES ex rel. Francisco v. Peskoske, No. 20-5357, 2021 WL 9100552 \n(D.C. Cir. Jan. 29, 2021). \n  In early February 2021, the CDC “issued a notice ‘temporarily except[ing] . . . unaccom-\npanied noncitizen children’ from expulsion under the Title 42 Process” pending its reassessment \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 5 of 13\nof its October 2020 order.  Huisha-Huisha I, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 159 (alterations in original) (quot-\ning Notice of Temporary Exception from Expulsion of Unaccompanied Noncitizen Children En-\ncountered in the United States Pending Forthcoming Public Health Determination, 86 Fed. Reg. \n9942-01, 2021 WL 600683 (Feb. 11, 2021)).  Both the D.C. Circuit and this Court granted the \nparties’ motions to hold the case in abeyance.1  See id. at 160.  In July 2021, the CDC issued an \norder “fully excepting” unaccompanied noncitizen children from the Title 42 Process.  Public \nHealth Determination Regarding an Exception for Unaccompanied Noncitizen Children from the \nOrder Suspending the Right to Introduce Certain Persons from Countries Where a Quarantinable \nCommunicable Disease Exists, 86 Fed. Reg. 38717-01, 38717, 2021 WL 3081447 (July 22, 2021).  \nIn August 2021, the CDC issued a new order reaffirming the Title 42 Process as it applied to \n“covered noncitizens” other than unaccompanied noncitizen children.  Public Health Reassess-\nment and Order Suspending the Right to Introduce Certain Persons from Countries Where a Quar-\nantinable Communicable Disease Exists, 86 Fed. Reg. 42828-02, 42829, 2021 WL 3403847 (Aug. \n5, 2021).  In March 2022, while this case was still held in abeyance, the CDC issued an order \nterminating all prior orders to the extent that they applied the Title 42 Process to unaccompanied \nchildren, which had the effect of continuing the exception of unaccompanied children from that \nprocess.2  See generally Public Health Reassessment and Immediate Termination of Order Sus-\n \n1 At that point, although the case had been appealed to the D.C. Circuit, there were proceedings in this Court regarding \n32 unaccompanied minors who had been returned to Guatemala pursuant to the Title 42 Process after the injunction \nprohibiting its enforcement had gone into effect and before the D.C. Circuit stayed the injunction.  See ECF No. 97. \n \n2 “The March 2022 Order apparently was issued in response to litigation in Texas challenging Defendants’ practice of \nnot applying Title 42 to unaccompanied alien children.”  Louisiana, __ F. Supp. 3d at __, 2022 WL 1604901, at *3; \nsee also Complaint, Texas v. Biden, 589 F. Supp. 3d 595 (N.D. Tex. 2022) (No. 21-cv-579), ECF No. 1.  On March \n4, 2022, the Texas district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the July 2021 and August \n2021 orders “to the extent that they except unaccompanied alien children from Title 42 procedures based solely on \ntheir status as unaccompanied alien children.”  Texas, 589 F. Supp. 3d at 623–24.  In light of the Texas court’s finding \nthat the CDC “had not adequately explained its decision to treat [unaccompanied children] differently than other \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 6 of 13\npending the Right to Introduce Certain Persons from Countries Where a Quarantinable Communi-\ncable Disease Exists with Respect to Unaccompanied Noncitizen Children, 87 Fed.

In October 2022, at the request of Defendants, the D.C. \nCircuit lifted the abeyance in this case and remanded it to this Court to consider whether all or part \nof the case has become moot.  See Order, PJES v. Mayorkas, No. 20-5357 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 17, \n2022).  The government filed its motion to dismiss the complaint as moot in November 2022.  ECF \nNo. 147. \n  Meanwhile, back in January 2021, a different group of plaintiffs filed an action challenging \nthe Title 42 Process as it applies to noncitizen family units including at least one child under eight-\neen years old.  Huisha-Huisha I, 560 F. Supp. 3d at 162.  Judge Sullivan granted a preliminary \ninjunction finding, as in PJES, that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim \nthat  \nthe CDC Orders instituting the Title 42 Process exceed the authority granted by \nCongress pursuant to Section 265 because “[n]othing in [Section] 265, or Title 42 \nmore generally, purports to authorize any deportations, much less deportations in \nviolation of’ statutory procedures and humanitarian protections, including the right \nto seek asylum.”  \n   \nId. at 166–67 (alterations in original).  The government again appealed, and in January 2022, the \nD.C. Circuit reversed the grant, “find[ing] it likely that aliens covered by a valid § 265 order have \n \nnoncitizens” subject to the Title 42 Process, the agency “reopened this issue and reconsidered” whether unaccompa-\nnied children should be excepted from the policy.  Public Health Reassessment and Immediate Termination of Order \nSuspending the Right to Introduce Certain Persons, 87 Fed. Reg. 15243-01, 15244, 15251–52, 2022 WL 797266.  It \nultimately concluded in March 2022 that unaccompanied children should continue to be excepted from the Title 42 \nProcess “based on the current public health circumstances.”  Id. at 15244.  Thereafter, Texas v. Biden was voluntarily \ndismissed (and, consequently, the preliminary injunction was dissolved) in October 2022 because the matters at issue \nhad “largely been superseded by later events.”  Joint Status Report, Texas v. Biden, No. 21-cv-579 (N.D. Tex. Oct. \n11, 2022); Stipulation of Dismissal without Prejudice, Texas v. Biden, Bo. 21-cv-579 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 18, 2022); see \nalso Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, 11A Federal Practice and Procedure § 2947 (3d ed.) (“A preliminary \ninjunction remains in effect until a final judgment is rendered or the complaint is dismissed[.]”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 7 of 13\nno right to be in the United States, and the Executive can immediately expel them” except to a \nplace “where they will be persecuted or tortured.”  Huisha-Huisha III, 27 F.4th at 721–22. \n  In April 2022, the CDC found that “there is no longer a serious danger that the entry of \ncovered noncitizens . . . into the United States will result in the introduction, transmission, and \nspread of COVID-19 and that a suspension of the introduction of covered noncitizens is no longer \nrequired in the interest of public health” and issued an order terminating all prior Title 42 orders \nsuspending the rights of noncitizens to enter the United States.3  See Public Health Determination \nand Order Regarding Suspending the Right to Introduce Certain Persons from Countries Where \na Quarantinable Communicable Disease Exists, 87 Fed. Reg. 19941-01, 19942, 2022 WL 1016059 \n(Apr. 6, 2022).  However, in May 2022, a court in the Western District of Louisiana issued a \nnationwide preliminary injunction on the basis that the April 2022 order violated the APA because \nit was not issued through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process.4  Louisiana, __ F. Supp. \n3d at __, 2022 WL 1604901, at *17–23.  The government has appealed that ruling.  See ECF No. \n147-1 at 10. \n  Then, in November 2022, Judge Sullivan issued a decision finding that the rules and orders \nissued under Title 42 that prohibited the introduction of certain noncitizens into the United States \nand authorized their expulsion—specifically, “the regulation at 42 C.F.R. § 71.40 and all orders \nand decision memos issued by the [CDC] or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nsuspending the right to introduce certain persons into the United States”—are arbitrary and capri-\n \n3 The March 2022 and April 2022 orders together thus had the effect of terminating the Title 42 Process as to all \nnoncitizens, while leaving the implementing regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 71.40, in place.   \n \n4 The injunction applies only to the April 2022 order—called the “Termination Order” in the decision, see Louisiana, \n__ F. Supp. 3d at __, 2022 WL 1604901, at *3—not to the March 2022 order excepting unaccompanied children from \nthe Title 42 Process.  As noted, the preliminary injunction finding that order invalid is no longer in force, see note 2, \nsupra.  Thus, unaccompanied children are not currently subject to the Title 42 Process. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 8 of 13\ncious because the agencies (1) failed to “acknowledge and explain its departure from past prac-\ntice,” Huisha-Huisha II, __ F. Supp. 3d at __, 2022 WL 16948610, at *10 (quoting Grace v. Barr, \n965 F.3d 883, 903 (D.C. Cir. 2020)), 16; (2) “failed to consider the harms to migrants subject to \nexpulsion,” id. at __, 2022 WL 16948610, at *10; and (3) “failed to adequately consider alterna-\ntives” and instituted a policy “that did not rationally serve its stated purpose,” id. at __, 2022 WL \n16948610, at *11.  He vacated the policy and permanently enjoined its application to the class \nmembers.  Id. at __, 2022 WL 16948610, at *16.  The government appealed but did not seek a stay \nof the district court’s injunction.  The D.C. Circuit then denied a motion to intervene (and dis-\nmissed as moot a motion to stay) brought by many of the states—including Louisiana—that had \nsuccessfully enjoined the April 2022 CDC order terminating its Title 42 orders suspending the \nintroduction of noncitizens (other than unaccompanied children) into the United States.5  Order, \nHuisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, No. 22-5325 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 16, 2022).  The Supreme Court granted \ncertiorari as to the order denying intervention and stayed the district court’s order enjoining en-\nforcement of the Title 42 Process shortly thereafter.  Arizona v. Mayorkas, 598 U.S. __, 143 S. Ct. \n478 (2022). \n  Thus, at this point, the CDC has rescinded or attempted to rescind all of its orders author-\nizing the expulsion of individuals pursuant to Section 265, including the orders putatively invali-\ndated in this case involving unaccompanied children; the rescission of some of those orders—but \nnot the orders as to unaccompanied children enjoined in this case—has been enjoined by a court \nin the Western District of Louisiana in a decision the government has appealed to the Fifth Circuit; \n \n5 Those states are Arizona, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Ne-\nbraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.  States’ \nNotice Regarding Motion to Intervene and Alternative Renewed Motion to Intervene at 2, Huisha-Huisha v. Mayor-\nkas, No. 22-5325 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 2022). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 9 of 13\nthe judgment entered pursuant to Huisha-Huisha II invalidating the entire Title 42 Policy, includ-\ning its implementing regulation, 42 U.S.C. § 71.40, has been stayed by the Supreme Court so that \nit can determine whether the states that sought to intervene in Huisha-Huisha to defend the policy \nwere properly denied that opportunity; and, according to Defendants in Huisha-Huisha (which, \npursuant to an order issued by the D.C. Circuit on January 20, 2023, is held in abeyance “pending \nthe Supreme Court’s disposition of Arizona v. Mayorkas”), the government has “decided to under-\ntake notice-and-comment rulemaking to replace” 42 C.F.R. § 71.40, the regulation underlying all \nof the CDC orders at issue not only in Huisha-Huisha, but also in this case and in Louisiana.  \nMotion to Hold Case in Abeyance at 8, Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, No. 22-5325 (D.C. Cir. Jan. \n9, 2023); Order, Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, No. 22-5325 (D.C. Jan. 20, 2023) (holding the case \nin abeyance pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Arizona v. Mayorkas). \n  Into this thicket, Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss this case as moot or, in the \nalternative, to dissolve the preliminary injunction, arguing that the case is moot because the CDC \nhas terminated its Title 42 orders with respect to unaccompanied children and “there is no evidence \nthat [the] CDC will reinstate its Title 42 process for unaccompanied children in the near future \nduring this pandemic.”6  ECF No. 147 at 12, 14.  Plaintiff’s opposition to that motion is due on \nJanuary 30, 2023, ECF No. 149, but he has signaled that he will argue that the “voluntary cessa-\ntion” exception to mootness applies, see ECF No. 151 at 2 (“Plaintiff disputes that, absent affir-\nmance in Huisha-Huisha, Defendants have carried their ‘heavy burden’ of demonstrating that it is \n‘absolutely clear’ that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” \n(quoting Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v.

Va. 2012) (noting that an injunction that was stayed pending appeal became enforceable \nwhen the case was remanded). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 10 of 13\n2019 n.1 (2017)).  Plaintiff now seeks to hold Defendants’ motion to dismiss in abeyance pending \nthe completion of appellate proceedings in Huisha-Huisha.7  ECF No. 148 at 4. \nII.  DISCUSSION \n  “Resolving a motion to stay or to hold a matter in abeyance pending the outcome of a \nrelated or parallel proceeding turns upon the unique circumstances of the case, and is largely a \nmatter of discretion for the court.”  Khadr v. Bush, 587 F. Supp. 2d 225, 229 (D.D.C. 2008).  “The \npower to [stay or hold proceedings in abeyance] ‘is incidental to the power inherent in every court \nto control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for \ncounsel, and for litigants.’”  Drug Reform Coordination Network, Inc. v. Grey House Publ’g, Inc., \nNo. 14-cv-701, 2015 WL 13668667, at *1 (D.D.C. Aug. 5, 2015) (quoting Landis v. North Amer-\nican Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1936)).  A court “must weigh competing interests and maintain \nan even balance,” Landis, 299 U.S. at 254, and “may grant such a motion if it finds that ‘[i]n the \ninterest of judicial economy and avoiding unnecessary litigation’ a stay is appropriate,” Khadr, \n587 F. Supp. 2d at 229 (alteration in original) (quoting Al–Anazi v. Bush, 370 F. Supp. 2d 188, 199 \n(D.D.C.2005)); see also, e.g., IBT/HERE Employee Representatives’ Council v. Gate Gourmet \nDiv. Ams., 402 F. Supp. 2d 289, 292 (D.D.C.2005) (“[A] trial court may, with propriety, find it is \nefficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a stay of an action before \nit pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the case.” (quoting Leyva v. \nCertified Grocers of Cal., Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863–64 (9th Cir 1979)). \n \n7 At the time the motion to dismiss this case was filed, it appears that the government had not yet decided to appeal \nthe decision in Huisha-Huisha II, which invalidated the entire the Title 42 Process.  ECF No. 147-1 at 12 (noting that \n“once the five-week stay [of the injunction that the district court imposed at the request of the defendants in that case] \nexpires and the Huisha-Huisha order becomes effective . . . the regulation at 42 C.F.R. § 71.40 and all CDC orders \nissued thereunder will be vacated[.]”).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 11 of 13\n  Plaintiff argues that the motion to dismiss should be held in abeyance because “[t]he situ-\nation with regard to the Title 42 policy is currently in flux.”  ECF No. 148 at 4.  More specifically, \nhe contends that awaiting the outcome of the Huisha-Huisha litigation the most efficient way to \nproceed because, if the district court’s decision stands, the entire Title 42 Process, including the \nimplementing regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 71.40, will be nullified.  See id.  Indeed, in that situation, he \n“expects to stipulate to dismissal” of this case.  ECF No. 148 at 4; see also ECF No. 151 at 1 (“As \nPlaintiff indicated, if the vacatur order [of Huisha-Huisha II] is affirmed he expects to stipulate to \ndismissal, and no further briefing or decision from this Court will be necessary.”).  Defendants \nrejoin that Huisha-Huisha is not material to whether this case is moot because the CDC “has ter-\nminated its Title 42 orders insofar as they applied to unaccompanied children—an agency action \nthat has not been challenged.”8  ECF No. 150 at 2.  However, Defendants themselves acknowledge \nthat they relied on the district court’s decision in Huisha-Huisha II to argue that this case is moot.  \nSee ECF No. 150 at 2–3; see also ECF No. 147-1 at 11–12, 13, 15, 18 (discussing Huisha-Huisha \nII).  They further recognize that Huisha-Huisha II provides an “independent reason why this case \nis moot” and “lend[s] additional support to Defendants’ argument that there is no actual contro-\nversy between the parties.”  ECF No. 150 at 2–3.  For its part, the Court notes that, if Huisha-\nHuisha II is upheld and the Title 42 Process is invalid, there will be no need to address potentially \ncomplicated mootness questions such as whether the voluntary cessation exception applies to the \ngovernment and, if so, if it applies in this case.  See ECF No. 147-1 at 14 n.1 (suggesting that the \ndoctrine does not apply to the government).   “[A] stay of the proceedings in one case is justifiable \neven where the parallel proceedings ‘may not settle every question of fact and law,’ but would \n \n8 The Court notes that the July 2021 and August 2021 orders excepting unaccompanied children from the Title 42 \nProcess were challenged in Texas v. Biden.  See note 2, supra.  It does not appear that the March 2022 order terminating \nthe Title 42 Process as to unaccompanied children has been challenged. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 12 of 13\nsettle some outstanding issues and simplify others.”  Bridgeport Hosp. v. Sebelius, No. 09-cv-\n1344, 2011 WL 862250, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2011) (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 256). \n  More, Defendants have not even attempted to argue that any harm will flow from a stay in \nthis case.  They assert that waiting for conclusion of appellate proceedings in Huisha-Huisha will \n“unnecessarily prolong resolution of [their] motion to dismiss.”  ECF No. 150 at 3.  But, as Plaintiff \npoints out, the injunction in this case is not currently doing any work, as Defendants “by their own \nadmission . . . are not presently seeking to expel unaccompanied children under the Title 42 Pol-\nicy.”  ECF No. 151 at 1.  That is, this is not a situation in which Defendants interests are harmed \nbecause they cannot enforce orders they believe to have been lawfully promulgated unless and \nuntil their motion to dismiss is granted and/or the preliminary injunction is dissolved.  On the other \nhand, granting Plaintiff’s motion and staying the case will “preserve everyone’s resources,” in-\ncluding the Court’s, by deferring potentially unnecessary briefing and decision.  ECF No 151 at 2. \nFinally, the Court’s “independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion exists” and dismiss cases where it is lacking, ECF No. 150 at 3 (quoting Arbaugh v. Y&H \nCorp., 546 U.S. 500, 514, (2006)), does not require denial of Plaintiff’s motion.  Rather, it is well-\nsettled that a court may address “certain non-merits, nonjurisdictional issues” prior to determining \nits jurisdiction “because ‘[j]urisdiction is vital only if the court proposes to issue a judgment on \nthe merits.’”  Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., 486 F.3d 1342, 1348 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (alter-\nation in original) (quoting Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malaysia Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 431 \n(2007)).  Resolution of Plaintiff’s motion “does not entail any assumption . . . of substantive ‘law-\ndeclaring power.’” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Sinochem, 549 U.S. at 424); see also Hydro \nEnergy 1, S.a.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain, No. 21-cv-2463, 2022 WL 2315519, at *1–2  (D.D.C. June \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02245-EGS-GMH   Document 152   Filed 01/25/23   Page 13 of 13\n28, 2022)   (granting a motion to stay prior to determining whether the defendant, the Kingdom of \nSpain, was immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act). \nIn sum, having weighed the competing interests, the Court finds that a stay is appropriate \n“[i]n the interest of judicial economy and avoiding unnecessary litigation.”  Khadr, 587 F. Supp. \n2d at 229 (alteration in original) (quoting Al–Anazi, 370 F. Supp. 2d at 199). \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiff’s motion to hold Defend-\nants’ motion to dismiss in abeyance (ECF No. 148) is GRANTED.  It is further ORDERED that \nthis case is STAYED pending completion of appellate proceedings in Huisha-Huisha v.
