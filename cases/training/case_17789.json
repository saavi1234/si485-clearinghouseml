The parties disagree about whether discovery should proceed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss, which the parties are still briefing (the reply is due on February 2, 2021). Plaintiffs are a putative class of 77 former Black franchisees of McDonald's. They operated more than 300 restaurants. Plaintiffs seek between $4 million and $5 million per restaurant in compensatory damages, plus punitive damages. All together, Plaintiffs seek more than $1 billion in damages. In light of the number of plaintiffs, the anticipated scope of discovery, and the enormity of the requested damages, it makes sense to assess the viability of the complaint before proceeding headlong into discovery. Discovery surely would be burdensome and expensive, so the sufficiency of the complaint must come first. Discovery is hereby stayed pending further order of the Court. Mailed notice.

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Steven C. Seeger: This Court reviewed Plaintiffs' motion for substitution of counsel (Dckt. No. 71 ), filed by Loevy & Loevy. The motion is, by all appearances, news to the attorneys who currently represent the Plaintiffs (the Ferraro Law Firm). The Ferraro Law Firm then filed a motion for an emergency hearing (Dckt. No. 72 ), and Loevy & Loevy filed a motion to respond (Dckt. No. 73 ). The motion to file a response (Dckt. No. 73 ) is hereby granted. Loevy & Loevy's response is due by November 17, 2022. The emergency seems to be driven by the upcoming deadline to file an amended complaint, which is currently set for November 18, 2022. This Court has moved that deadline a few times already. Still, to take some pressure off the situation, the Court will move that deadline once again. Any amended complaint is due by December 16, 2022. The Court directs Plaintiffs' counsel (meaning Loevy & Loevy, and Ferraro Law Firm) to confer in good faith, and try to sort out the future representation of the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' attorneys must file a joint statement about the future direction of the case by November 30, 2022. In the meantime, the situation seems fluid, but it appears that many, but not all, of the original Plaintiffs (39, to be exact) (defined as the \"Crawford Plaintiffs\") want to be represented by Loevy & Loevy, not the Ferraro Law Firm. By the look of things, it appears that many of the original Plaintiffs want to stick with their current lawyers (the Ferraro Law Firm). Is that right? If so, what are the respective numbers? And how would that work, exactly? Is Plaintiffs' counsel proposing that both firms participate in the case, with each firm representing different groups of Plaintiffs? How would that work in a putative class action, which requires putative class counsel, if some named Plaintiffs want to be represented by non-class counsel? Presumably that's not the plan, which seems like a recipe for extra costs and wasted time (imagine both firms seeking discovery from McDonald's, on behalf of different groups of Plaintiffs). Or, does each firm propose that it represent everyone, meaning an all-or-nothing affair? And if so, what if some of the named Plaintiffs don't want to be represented by one of the firms? Then what? The parties undoubtedly can envision other issues, too. Basically, give it some thought, talk it over, and report back to the Court. If it chooses to do so, McDonald's can weigh in by December 2. A party usually doesn't get to weigh in on who represents the adverse party, but given the dynamics at stake, maybe McDonald's can anticipate other potential complications. The Court takes the other motions under advisement, and will set a hearing as necessary after receiving that status report. Mailed notice (jjr, ) (Entered: 11/15/2022)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Steven C. Seeger: McDonald's raised the statute of limitations in its original motion to dismiss. (Dckt. No. 25 ) In a recent filing (before the filing of the second amended complaints), McDonald's reiterated that the timeliness of the claims remains an issue. (Dckt. No. 77 ) In particular, McDonald's dropped a footnote stating that many of the claims are time-barred, based on when the various plaintiffs exited the McDonald's franchise system. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. Even so, McDonald's has raised the issue, and the parties will need to address it one way or the other. Sooner is better than later. Presumably it is a knowable fact when any particular plaintiff left the McDonald's system. There is unlikely to be a dispute about that date, but if there is, it is helpful to know that, too. Also, pinning down when each of the plaintiffs left the McDonald's system may shed considerable light on the likely parameters of the cases (if they survive a motion to dismiss on other grounds). That's a long way of saying that the parties should pin down the facts to figure out what claims are likely untimely. Whittling down the case to remove any untimely claims helps everyone. To that end, the Court orders the following. By January 27, 2023, Plaintiffs' counsel must serve a user-friendly table or spreadsheet that identifies, with specificity, the date when each particular Plaintiff left the McDonald's franchise system. McDonald's must respond in writing by February 17, 2023. McDonald's must identify any areas of dispute, if any, and must flag (by Plaintiff) any claims that appear to be time barred. The goal is to figure out, sooner rather than later, what claims are likely time barred, and what claims are likely timely, before burning any additional resources on those claims. The parties must file a status report on the status of their discussions on that project by February 24, 2023. The parties must attach their respective spreadsheets/tables.

No. 79 ) Not to be outdone, on December 16, 2022, the Manning Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint with 836 paragraphs, weighing in at 158 pages. (Dckt. No. 78 ) Viewed together, the number of paragraphs in the two complaints has a comma in it. It can be a challenge to draft a complaint that includes the claims of dozens of individual plaintiffs. Even so, the complaints pushed the boundaries of what is permissible under the Federal Rules. (Every District Court Judge in the country has the same favorite word in the Federal Rules: \"short.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).) McDonald's needs significant time to respond to such significant filings. In the meantime, McDonald's filed a three-page motion to dismiss as a placeholder. That motion (Dckt. No. 82 ) is denied without prejudice, for administrative purposes only. The responses to the second amended complaints are due by March 31, 2023. If McDonald's elects to file motions to dismiss, McDonald's can refile the motion in each case and then file a supporting memorandum, too. A response period of that length is appropriate given the girth of the complaints, and given that Plaintiffs had two and a half months to file the second amended complaints after this Court's ruling on the motion to dismiss on September 28, 2022. The allotted time will give the parties time and space to have productive settlement discussions, too. Mailed notice (jjr, ) (Entered: 01/11/2023)"

Counsel who filed the original complaint, the Ferraro Law Firm, requested a status hearing about \"what appears to be a massive, active, and blanket solicitation of Ferraro Law's clients by another law firm, Loevy & Loevy.\" (Dckt. No. 72 ) Loevy & Loevy, for its part, filed a motion for substitution of counsel (Dckt. No. 71 ), seeking to represent the so-called \"Crawford Plaintiffs.\" This Court then issued an Order directing counsel to meet and confer about the future representation of Plaintiffs, and report back with a joint statement about the plan going forward. (Dckt. No. 74 ) In their joint statement (Dckt. No. 76 ), the Ferraro Law Firm and Loevy & Loevy proposed that the Court sever the case, with separate complaints in separate case numbers. The Court agrees. To that end, on December 16, 2022, the Ferraro Law Firm filed a second amended complaint (the \"King Complaint\"), and so did Loevy & Loevy (the \"Manning Complaint\") (which includes the Crawfords, so the lingo has changed). See King Cplt. (Dckt. No. 79 ); Manning Cplt. (Dckt. No. 78 ). A single case can't have two operative complaints. And the individual plaintiffs want to pursue different complaints by different lawyers. The case is hereby severed. The King Complaint will stay put and remain with this case number (20-cv-5132). The Manning Complaint will have a new case number. The Court directs the Clerk's Office to open a new case, file the Manning Complaint (Dckt. No. 78 ) under that new case number, and designate the cases as related. The cases will stay on the same scheduling track. The Court will consolidate the two cases for discovery if need be (that statement is not suggestive about any motion to dismiss). Discovery in both cases remains stayed. Counsel, especially Plaintiffs' counsel, must make substantial efforts to coordinate the two cases to avoid unnecessary burdens and expense. Severance would not be a reason to double the amount of discovery aimed at McDonald's (e.g., severance will not expose McDonald's to 50 interrogatories, meaning twice the number contemplated by the Federal Rules, absent a showing of good cause). The Court will expect Plaintiffs' counsel to cooperate and coordinate their discovery requests (including depositions) to minimize the burdens imposed by two sets of Plaintiffs' lawyers. The motion to substitute counsel (Dckt. No. 71 ) and the motion for a status hearing (Dckt. No. 72 ) are hereby denied as moot. Mailed notice (jjr, ) (Entered: 01/11/2023)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Steven C. Seeger: Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint as a Matter of Course Pursuant to Rule 15 (Dckt. No. 28 ) is hereby granted. Rule 15(a)(1)(B) provides that a party \"may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within... 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). As the plain text reveals, Rule 15(a)(1)(B) contemplates an amendment \"without the permission of the court.\" See 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 1480 (3d ed. 2020). As long as the party files the amended pleading within 21 days, there is no need to ask the Court for anything. \"The purpose of the amendment-as-of-right provision is to avoid judicial involvement in the pleading process when there is little reason for doing so.\" Id.; see also Bertha v. Sullivan, 719 F. App'x 516, 518 (7th Cir. 2017) (\"Bertha filed his amended complaint within that [21-day] time limit, so permission from the judge was unnecessary.\"). \"[W]hether to allow an amendment\" is \"out of the court's hands entirely\" if the party files an amendment within 21 days. See Swanigan v. City of Chicago, 775 F.3d 953, 963 (7th Cir. 2015). Here, Plaintiffs filed a \"motion for leave\" to file an amended complaint \"as a matter of course.\" (Dckt. No. 28 ) Those are two different things -- a party does not need permission to file an amended pleading as a matter of course. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 23, 2020. (Dckt. No. 24 ) So, under the Federal Rules, Plaintiffs had a right to file an amended complaint by November 13, 2020, meaning 21 days later. But instead of filing an amended complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, and did so on November 13, 2020. There was no need to file a motion for permission because, under the Federal Rules, they did not need permission. But by filing a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, instead of filing the amended complaint itself, Plaintiffs missed the deadline to file an amended complaint without permission. They asked for permission when they didn't need it, and thus missed a deadline to file something without permission. And by missing the deadline to file something without permission, Plaintiffs now need permission. Permission is granted. The motion (Dckt. No. 28 ) is granted. Plaintiffs attached the proposed first amended complaint as an attachment to their motion. Plaintiffs shall file the first amended complaint as a freestanding docket entry by November 23, 2020. Mailed notice. (jjr, ) Modified on 11/18/2020 (jjr, ). (Entered: 11/16/2020)"

No. 41 ) But this Court already gave Plaintiffs leave to file a 35-page response brief. On September 18, 2020, this Court issued an Order that increased the page limits for all parties on the then-forthcoming motion to dismiss. \"The page limit for Defendants' opening brief, and Plaintiffs' response brief, is 35 pages.\" Plaintiffs are asking the Court for leave to do something that they already have leave to do, so the motion is moot.

This Court will adopt the proposed scheduling order in the McPherson case once it is formally transferred. The parties proposed that Plaintiffs' opposition to the motions to dismiss in the King and Manning cases would be due on June 19, not June 5 (meaning the original due date as of the time of filing the motion.) But the Court sees that Plaintiffs went ahead and filed the response on June 5 anyway (Dckt. No. 106 ), during the pendency of the motion for more time. (This Court acknowledges that it did not exactly break the land-speed record in issuing a ruling on the motion for more time. So the Court can see why Plaintiffs went ahead and filed the response on the original due date, to avoid a potential issue. For what it's worth, this Court would have given Plaintiffs more time. The Court thanks the parties for their patience.) The reply by McDonald's is due by July 19, as proposed. That's more time (about a month and a half) than the parties originally requested for the reply by McDonald's (about a month), because Plaintiffs filed their response on June 5 not June 19. This Court is not going to accelerate the deadline of July 19 because maybe the parties set that deadline for some other reason (e.g., a summer vacation). Still, McDonald's can file its reply early if it is in a position to do so. Mailed notice. (jjr, ) (Docket Text Modified on 6/23/2023) (jjr, ). (Entered: 06/12/2023)"

          "description": "MINUTE entry before the Honorable Steven C. Seeger: The Court reviewed the joint status report about the statute of limitations, as well as the accompanying spreadsheets. (Dckt. No. 90 ) This Court directed the parties to \"pin down\" when each Plaintiff left the McDonald's system. In particular, this Court directed Plaintiffs' counsel to \"serve a user-friendly table or spreadsheet that identifies, with specificity,\" the date \"when each particular Plaintiff left the McDonald's franchise system.\" (Dckt. No. 87 ) Plaintiffs responded by serving a spreadsheet that provided only the year. Plaintiffs' response was underwhelming, inadequate, and non-compliant. If someone asked you what date it is, you probably wouldn't answer \"2023.\" Giving the year might be good enough if, say, someone asked when you graduated from college. But it is not good enough when the goal of an exercise is to \"pin down\" the statute of limitations. The day matters when figuring out if a claim is timely. And, in a franchise context, it is usually easy to pin down when, exactly, the franchisor/franchisee relationship ended. It is not the sort of thing that is left up in the air or loosey-goosey. It presumably is written down in a franchise agreement, or some other contract. So, Plaintiffs must do it again. Plaintiffs must serve a supplemental spreadsheet by March 10, 2023. If they do not know anything about their departure date, other than the year, then they must say so, with a supporting declaration from each Plaintiff. Unlike Plaintiffs, McDonald's did offer a date-certain when each Plaintiff left the system. McDonald's pointed to the \"Defendants' Documented Exit Date.\" (Dckt. No. [90-2]) By March 15, 2023, McDonald's must produce documents supporting the departure dates in its spreadsheet. Plaintiffs must serve a responsive spreadsheet by March 29, 2023. For each Plaintiff, if Plaintiffs has reason to dispute the dates in the spreadsheet by McDonald's, Plaintiffs must explain why. The parties must meet and confer, and must file an updated status report with the accompanying spreadsheets by April 5, 2023. The Court expects compliance in good faith. Plaintiffs' last effort was inadequate, so the Court expects more compliance on the second go-around. The Court offers one last observation. The parties stated that they \"disagree over... whether such issues are ripe for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage prior to discovery.\" (Dckt. No. 90 ) The issue is ripe because the Court said that it is ripe. Or, at the very least, this Court will help it ripen on the vine. District courts have expansive authority to manage their dockets, streamline cases, and narrow the issues as they see fit. That power can include trimming cases of claims that do not belong, and that are destined to hit the exits of the courthouse. There is no point in having time-barred claims hang around, because they will simply add dead weight to the case. The Court wants to get to the bottom of this issue sooner rather than later, before consuming untold resources for potentially time-barred claims. It is true that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, and that the statute of limitations is not normally an issue at the motion-to-dismiss stage (unless the face of the complaint shows that it is time barred). Even so, the Federal Rules allow early motions for summary judgment. And, this Court has the discretion to authorize multiple rounds of summary judgment motions, including an early motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitations, and a later motion for summary judgment on everything else. Plaintiffs point to a possible argument about tolling, but that's neither here nor there. Step one is to figure out if something needs to be tolled in the first place. So, the Court directs all parties to engage in this process in good faith. A failure to comply will lead to appropriate relief. Emailed notice (cdh, ) (Entered: 02/27/2023)"

    "summary": "<p>On August 31, 2020, 52 black McDonald&rsquo;s franchisees filed this lawsuit against McDonald&rsquo;s in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs claimed that McDonald&rsquo;s racially discriminated against them in its management policies and set the franchisees up to fail by placing them in economically depressed locations and high-crime areas. The plaintiffs sued under 42 U.S. &sect; 1981 (part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteeing equal rights under the law), alleging that McDonald&rsquo;s knowingly discriminated against Plaintiffs by denying equal advancement opportunities to them as compared to white counterparts. Additionally, the plaintiffs sued under state law, alleging that McDonald&rsquo;s engaged in disproportionately harsh enforcement of the Franchise Agreement that amounted to a breach of contract and fraudulent omission of requirements that were more stringent for them as well as of opportunities that were available to white franchisees. Represented by the Ferraro Law Firm based in Florida, the franchisees sought between $4 and $ 5 million per restaurant in compensatory damages, consequential damages, and punitive damages as well as attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs. Judge Steve C. Seeger was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>McDonald&rsquo;s moved twice to dismiss the franchisees&rsquo; complaint for failure to state a valid claim. Following the first motion, the franchisees amended their complaint on November 16, 2020, to include 25 more plaintiffs, add details regarding McDonald&rsquo;s Franchise Agreement, and remove an explicit cause of action for punitive damages, though Plaintiffs still seek punitive damages. McDonald&rsquo;s filed the second motion to dismiss on December 21, 2020, after which franchisees responded.</p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2021, McDonalds filed a reply both to the franchisees' amended complaint and in support of defendant's motion to dismiss. This reply alleged plaintiffs' claims failed because they were conclusory, failed to use facts particular enough to support their claims, and were time-barred under the statute of limitations of 42 U.S. &sect; 1981.</p>\r\n<p>limitations of 42 U.S. &sect; 1981.</p>\r\n<p>On September 28, 2022, the court ruled that the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; amended complaint was granted. At this status hearing, the amount of a potential settlement was divulged by the plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel inadvertently. The judge sealed this portion of the hearing. On December 16, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The amended complaint added additional plaintiffs and provided more detailed information about each plaintiff&rsquo;s claim. On December 30, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs&rsquo; second amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On January 11, 2023, the case was referred to Judge Maria Valdez to conduct a settlement conference. She ordered the plaintiffs to submit a demand letter by January 25, 2023, and the defendants to submit an offer letter by February 9, 2023. Further, on January 11, the court ordered plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel to produce documentation that showed when plaintiffs left the McDonald's system in order to determine untimely claims. The court found the plaintiff&rsquo;s response to be non-compliant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An attorneys only settlement conference was held on April 13, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2023, the defendants filed another motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs filed their response on June 5, 2023. As of October 2024, the case is ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This case arises from McDonald’s systematic racial discrimination against its \nBlack franchisees.  \n2.  Plaintiffs are all Black, former McDonald’s franchisees who were forced out of \nthe McDonald’s system due to McDonald’s systematic racial discrimination.  \n3.  Plaintiffs put their hearts and souls into their dreams of owning and operating \nMcDonald’s stores and building generational wealth for their families.  \n4.  In return, McDonald’s directed that Plaintiffs, solely because they were Black, \ncould only franchise and operate stores that were in predominantly Black neighborhoods. These \n2 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 3 of 158 PageID #:1790\nstores had lower sales and profits than McDonald’s stores in white neighborhoods. McDonald’s \nrefused to allow Plaintiffs to become franchisees in white neighborhoods. \n5.  In addition, once Plaintiffs were part of the McDonald’s system, McDonald’s \ncontinued to discriminate against them based on their race and breached McDonald’s agreements \nwith Plaintiffs. For instance, McDonald’s refused to offer Plaintiffs the same support that \nMcDonald’s offered white franchisees, and McDonald’s subjected Plaintiffs to harassing \ntreatment that it never directed at white franchisees.  \n6.  Finally, when it came time to sell their franchises, McDonald’s continued to \ndiscriminate against Plaintiffs because of their race and breach McDonald’s agreements with \nPlaintiffs. For example, McDonald’s refused to allow Plaintiffs to sell to their preferred Black \nbuyers, and it instead forced Plaintiffs to sell at lower prices to white buyers that McDonald’s \nhad hand-picked.  \n7.  McDonald’s pitched the prospect of becoming a franchisee to Black owners, \nincluding Plaintiffs, as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become business owners, to acquire \ngenerational wealth, and to become leaders in their local communities. Like much of what \nMcDonald’s has sold in the United States, it sold Plaintiffs and other Black franchisees what it \nadvertised was a part of the American dream. But it was a false promise. In reality, McDonald’s \ntrapped Black franchisees in a cycle of financial duress driven by racism. \n8.  In particular, McDonald’s executives and managers began by forcing Plaintiffs \ninto substandard, low-profit stores in predominantly Black communities with high crime rates. \nMcDonald’s executives intentionally placed Black franchisees in these stores based on the racist \nbelief that customer sales would increase—and that McDonald’s bottom line would therefore \n3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 4 of 158 PageID #:1791\nimprove—if stores were operated by individuals who had the same skin color as the rest of the \ncommunity.  \n9.  McDonald’s race discrimination against Black franchisees did not end with their \ninitial placement in substandard, dangerous locations. Plaintiffs’ experiences also reveal a \nstunning pattern of race discrimination by McDonald’s from the beginning to the end of their \nrelationships with McDonald’s.  \n10.  Once placed in these substandard locations, Black franchisees were forced to pay \nsignificantly higher operating costs than their white counterparts due to security costs, higher \ninsurance rates, and higher employee turnover. Yet, when confronted with the economic harms it \nhad caused, McDonald’s refused to provide Black franchisees with any of the needed financial \nassistance, including rent relief. Meanwhile, McDonald’s routinely provided such assistance, \nincluding rent relief, to white owner/operators, who did not face nearly as serious operating \nchallenges.  \n11.  Moreover, when Black franchisees approached McDonald’s about purchase \nopportunities in affluent white communities—stores that could have given them the financial \ncash flow to help pay costs at their lower-profit locations—McDonald’s uniformly denied them \nthose opportunities because they were Black. \n12.  McDonald’s also held Plaintiffs to higher operating standards solely because of \ntheir race. Regional staff consistently demanded that Plaintiffs complete unnecessary and costly \nrenovations or remodels on their stores. McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs no breathing room when it \ncame to completing renovations, often shortly after Plaintiffs’ purchase of a store, whereas white \nfranchisees were routinely granted a generous time frame to complete remodels upon purchase. \n4 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 5 of 158 PageID #:1792\n13.  When McDonald’s identified a Black franchisee it wanted to force out of the \nsystem, McDonald’s relied on a well-honed practice to do so: ramping up unannounced \ninspections at all times of the day and night to find infractions McDonald’s could use to justify a \npoor business review.  In turn, McDonald’s drew upon these poor business reviews to deem \nfranchisees ineligible for expansion or deny renewal of their leases. In contrast, when \nMcDonald’s wanted to keep a white franchisee in the system, McDonald’s provided extensive \nadvanced notice of their planned inspections, and helped prepare white franchisees for a \nsuccessful inspection. \n14.  When Black franchisees protested this racist treatment, requested financial \nassistance, or when McDonald’s simply wanted to cast them off in favor of a white \nowner/operator, McDonald’s employed the “inspection” tactic to force them out of the system. \n15.  McDonald’s racially discriminatory business practices were compounded by \nadditional overt displays of racism by McDonald’s, up and down the chain of command. The \nroutine racist indignities that Black franchisees, including Plaintiffs, suffered included but were \nnot limited to McDonald’s executives’ racist comments, McDonald’s regional staff’s non-\nresponse to hate crimes committed at Plaintiffs’ stores, and McDonald’s rejection of Plaintiffs’ \nefforts to have their family members join the McDonald’s system through the Next Generation \nprogram. \n16.  Moreover, in 2017, McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook announced his “Bigger \nBolder Vision 2020” program, which was introduced as a plan to modernize McDonald’s \nlocations across the country. But the Bigger Bolder Vision plan was also a racially \ndiscriminatory plan to force Black franchisees out of the McDonald’s system. It worked by \nfavoring franchisees with multiple locations as well as franchisees with newer stores, who could \n5 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 6 of 158 PageID #:1793\nmore easily afford to cover the cost of expensive renovations. Black franchisees, including \nPlaintiffs, largely did not fall into either of these camps. McDonald’s executives knew that Black \nfranchisees were unable to engage in the Bigger Bolder Vision program, but they did not care. \nInstead, McDonald’s regional managers forced Black franchisees to engage in the Bigger Bolder \nVision program—an impossible task—and, when they could not, McDonald’s deployed \nincreased inspections to force Black franchisees out of the system. \n17.  The Bigger Bolder Vision program was a turning point for many Black \nfranchisees, including Plaintiffs, who were forced by McDonald’s discriminatory actions to \ndecide between risking financial ruin or leaving the businesses they had poured years of their \nlives into. But the intentional racial discrimination left them no choice: one-third of Black \nfranchisees left McDonald’s during Easterbrook’s tenure, ending in 2019, and roughly half of \nBlack franchisees exited by 2020. \n18.  McDonald’s intentional race discrimination continued even once Plaintiffs were \nforced to leave—it extended to interfering in Plaintiffs’ sales of their stores at the end of their \nrelationships with McDonald’s. Rather than approving prospective buyers who were interested in \npurchasing Plaintiffs’ stores, McDonald’s withheld its consent to those sales without justification \nand in breach of their franchise agreements. Behind the scenes, McDonald’s had hand-picked \nparticular buyers to take over Plaintiffs’ stores, who typically bought the stores for less than they \nwere worth. In particular, where Plaintiffs had turned around economically depressed locations, \nMcDonald’s selected new white owner/operators to purchase the stores, and it prohibited \nPlaintiffs from negotiating with other prospective buyers. \n19.  McDonald’s intentional discrimination against Plaintiffs based solely on the fact \nthat they were Black directly caused them extreme harm. Among other things, McDonald’s \n6 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 7 of 158 PageID #:1794\ndiscriminatory and illegal actions devastated Plaintiffs’ livelihoods, deprived them of valuable \nopportunities, and ruined their physical and emotional health. Without McDonald’s intentional \nrace discrimination against Plaintiffs, they would never have suffered this harm. \n20.  Plaintiffs now seek to recover for the harm McDonald’s caused and to redress the \nrace discrimination and other tortious conduct they suffered at the hands of McDonald’s. On \nbehalf of 48 Plaintiffs, this complaint discusses McDonald’s intentional race discrimination and \nother illegal activities, and the direct effect that McDonald’s misconduct had on each of the \nPlaintiffs. \n21.  As one Plaintiff put it, “When we [Black franchisees] first got started, we always \nknew we were behind. We had to run faster to catch up. The only problem is we didn’t \nunderstand that we weren’t running the same race.” \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n22.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, §1332, \nand § 1367.  \n23.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants McDonald’s USA, LLC and \nMcDonald’s Corporation because each of their principal places of business is in the State of \nIllinois and because they have the requisite minimum contacts with the State necessary to \nconstitutionally permit the Court to exercise jurisdiction. \n24.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claim have occurred and are occurring in the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois, and Defendants transacted affairs and conducted activity that gave rise to the \nclaim of relief in this District. Further, both Defendants’ principal place of business is in this \nDistrict.  \n7 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 8 of 158 PageID #:1795\n25.

Defendant McDonald’s USA, LLC, the franchisor for \nMcDonald’s in the United States, is a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonald’s Corporation that \nis similarly incorporated in Delaware and operates its principal place of business in Illinois. For \nease of reference, both defendants are referred to collectively as “McDonald’s” throughout the \ncomplaint. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nFranchise Structure \n65.  McDonald’s business model depends on its franchisees. Out of McDonald’s \n38,000 locations around the globe, approximately 93% are operated by franchisees. McDonald’s \nretains control of the remaining locations through its wholly owned subsidiary, McDonald’s \nOperations Co. (“McOpCo”). McDonald’s earns roughly 69% of its $21-23 billion in annual \nrevenue from the rents and fees it charges its franchisees. \n66.  As the franchisor, McDonald’s develops and oversees McDonald’s restaurants, \nincluding a specific menu of food items. McDonald’s owns or leases the land on which the \nrestaurants are located. Franchisees, also known as owner/operators, are granted the right to \n10 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 11 of 158 PageID #:1798\noperate a specific McDonald’s restaurant and sell McDonald’s products in exchange for fees and \nan agreement to pay rent. \n67.  For a traditional restaurant, a franchisee will oversee a restaurant at a dedicated \nMcDonald’s location with a full menu. The typical franchise term for this type of restaurant is set \nat 20 years. \n68.  McDonald’s also franchises “satellite restaurants” that are located at non-\ndedicated McDonald’s sites, such as in a shopping center or hospital, and sell a limited menu of \nfood items. \n69.  McDonald’s offers a third type of lease—a BFL or “Business Franchise Lease,” \nin which McDonald’s leases the restaurant and its business facilities for a shorter period of time. \n70.  McDonald’s offered BFLs to many Black operators as a method of recruiting \npersons of color into the system. \n71.  Each franchisee is part of a regionally based “co-op,” made up of other \nfranchisees in the same TV market area. Co-ops hold regular meetings as often as once a month. \n72.  Additionally, McDonald’s offers the Next Generation Training Program to allow \nqualified family members of current franchisees an expedited path to becoming an \nowner/operator. \n73.  What McDonald’s pitches as a tremendous growth opportunity to prospective \nfranchisees is more akin to a feudal system, in which McDonald’s provides the land and reaps \nthe rewards of its franchisees’ labor. This power imbalance is captured in McDonald’s standard \nfranchise agreement, which it executes with each of its franchisees. \n74.  The Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit A, stipulates that franchisees must \nmeet a stringent set of requirements and pay a variety of fees to McDonald’s. Fees include rent \n11 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 12 of 158 PageID #:1799\nbased on a percentage of the location’s gross sales, collective advertising costs, a monthly \nservice fee subject to gross sales, and royalties. \n75.  Franchisees bear the costs of operations. These operational costs include \ninsurance, maintenance, and equipment, like kitchen fixtures and lighting, all of which must \nsatisfy standards that McDonald’s sets. All franchisees must comply with all of McDonald’s \nrequirements for quality, service, and cleanliness, as well as any new or existing procedures \nMcDonald’s imposes, though McDonald’s enforces unevenly depending on the race of the \nfranchisee.  \n76.  Even though the Agreement is favorable to McDonald’s, McDonald’s retains \nobligations to its franchisees. Under the Agreement, McDonald’s pledges to “make available to \nFranchisee all additional services, facilities, rights, and privileges relating to the operation of the \nRestaurant which McDonald’s makes generally available, from time to time, to all its franchisees \noperating McDonald’s restaurants.” (Franchise Agreement ¶ 3) (emphasis added). \n77.  Additionally, McDonald’s reserves the right to inspect a franchisee’s restaurant \nbut only at “reasonable times to ensure that [the] Franchisee’s operation” complies with \nMcDonald’s standards and policies. Franchisees may be required to renovate their stores in \ncompliance with McDonald’s standard building plans, including when those plans are \n“reasonably changed from time to time by McDonald’s.” (Franchise Agreement ¶ 12) (emphasis \nadded). \n78.  Given that the typical lease term is set at 20 years, McDonald’s begins discussions \nabout whether to renew a franchisee’s lease at least three years prior to the lease’s expiration.  \n79.  If a franchisee wishes to extend his or her lease or expand to additional locations, \nthe franchisee and McDonald’s engage in discussions about potential extensions or expansions.  \n12 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 13 of 158 PageID #:1800\n80.  Expansion and ownership of multiple stores is key to a franchisee’s success at \nMcDonald’s. Owning multiple stores gives a franchisee breathing room if one store dips in sales \nor requires a costly renovation.  \n81.  In the past, McDonald’s applied a 40-mile standard for expansion, meaning that \noperators were encouraged to not to expand beyond a 40-mile radius from their stores’ location. \nMore recently, McDonald’s has relaxed that standard and allowed operators to purchase stores \nbeyond the 40-mile radius, though it has done so only with white franchisees. \n82.  If a franchisee decides to sell a location, he or she must first receive McDonald’s \nwritten consent. The franchisee must provide McDonald’s at least 20 days’ notice of their \nintention to sell, along with the name and address of the prospective buyer, and the terms and \nconditions of the agreement. McDonald’s reserves the right of first refusal, meaning that it has \nthe first option to purchase the restaurant.  \n83.  In evaluating whether to provide consent for a sale, McDonald’s may consider the \nprospective purchaser’s “work experience and aptitude; financial background; character; ability \nto personally devote time and best efforts to managing the Restaurant; residence in the locality of \nthe Restaurant; equity interest in the Restaurant; conflicting interests; and such other criteria and \nconditions as McDonald’s shall then apply.” Franchise Agreement § 15(d). However, “[s]uch \nconsent shall not be arbitrarily withheld.” Id.  \n84.  Significantly, McDonald’s does not employ an “open market” system for selling \nits stores. To purchase a store, a franchisee must either receive an offer from McDonald’s for a \nparticular location or a franchisee must hear about the store being put up for sale from the seller \nor through the grapevine. As a result, Black franchisees were limited to purchasing restaurants \n13 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 14 of 158 PageID #:1801\nMcDonald’s offered them—low-volume stores in dangerous locations—or to purchasing from \nother Black operators, who helped them access opportunities that were not accessible.   \n85.  Even when Black franchisees have been able to position themselves to invest in \nrebuilds or renovations to their restaurants, McDonald’s does not provide equitable opportunities \nand treatment, but instead continues its pattern of discriminating against Black franchisees.  \n86.  McDonald’s maintains an internal set of national standards setting out the \nrequired equipment, layout, and physical condition that each of its restaurants must maintain, \ncalled the National Restaurants Building and Equipment Standards (NRBES). McDonald’s has a \npractice of providing new franchisees with what is referred to as an NRBES letter, which \ndescribes all of the renovations and upgrades (referred to as “reinvestments”) required to bring \nthe restaurant into compliance with the NRBES.  \n87.  The NRBES letter sent to each franchisee states that, as a condition of purchase, \nfranchisees must complete all the necessary reinvestments within a specific time frame from \npurchase. Depending on the age and condition of the restaurant, the expected cost to complete all \nof these “reinvestments” could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Because \nMcDonald’s forced Black franchisees to older, less profitable, lower quality restaurant locations, \nBlack franchisees faced disproportionately higher initial “reinvestment” costs than white \nfranchisees.   \n88.  McDonald’s told Black franchisees that the NRBES were consistently and \nuniformly applied to all franchisees. McDonald’s evaluated franchisees’ compliance with the \nNRBES in the business process to measure future opportunities for relocations, rebuilds, and \nrewrites (renewals of a lease). But unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, and contrary to the claimed \nconsistent and uniform application, McDonald’s had a practice of requiring Black franchisees to \n14 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 15 of 158 PageID #:1802\ncomplete their reinvestments and bring their restaurants into compliance with the NRBES within \nmuch shorter time frames than white franchisees, and with much less flexibility and leeway.  \n89.  McDonald’s employs a hierarchical system to oversee its franchisees. During \nPlaintiffs’ tenures, the President of McDonald’s USA managed overall operations for the \ncorporation’s 14,000 restaurants across the country. Below the President, the Presidents of the \nEast and West Divisions oversaw all restaurants in the eastern and western areas of the country, \nrespectively. Within each of those two divisions, the General Manager or Regional Manager \nsupervised franchisees within a particular region, as well as managed real estate and \ndevelopment strategy. The “Vice President and Regional Manager,” along with the Vice \nPresident of Quality, Service, and Cleanliness (“QSCVP”), was responsible for all franchising \ndecisions within a given region, including setting up the franchisee with a particular location and \ndetermining whether a franchisee was eligible for growth and rewrite. Field Service Managers or \nRepresentatives managed and developed strategy for a sub-set of franchisees and reported to the \nQSCVP.  Finally, Business Consultants conducted graded visits and inspections, reporting back \nto the Field Service Manager, who in turn reported to the Director of Operations.  \n90.  At each stage of the franchising process, from selecting a franchise location to \nsetting rental prices to approving the sale of a store and more, McDonald’s employees \nintentionally discriminated against Black franchisees. \nA History of Racial Discrimination Against Black Franchisees \n91.  McDonald’s has a long history of discriminating against Black franchisees. \n92.  Upon its founding in 1955, McDonald’s installed its restaurants only in white \nneighborhoods and barred Black individuals from becoming franchisees.  \n93.  However, following white flight from urban areas in the late 1960s and 1970s and \nMartin Luther King’s assassination in 1968, McDonald’s began recruiting Black owner/operators \n15 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 16 of 158 PageID #:1803\nto take over stores in cities. McDonald’s approved only “zebra” or “salt and pepper” \npartnerships, in which Black franchisees partnered with a white owner/operator to purchase a \nlocation. \n94.  In 1972, McDonald’s first Black owner/operator, Herman Petty, helped found the \nNational Black McDonald’s Operators Association (NBMOA) to advocate for Black franchisees. \n95.  In 1982, McDonald’s sued Charles Griffis, a Black owner/operator, for breach of \ncontract after he bought two Popeyes franchise locations—a McDonald’s competitor. Griffis \ncountersued McDonald’s for intentionally placing him in “ghetto” locations and restricting him \nfrom purchasing stores in suburban areas. McDonald’s settled with Griffis for $4.7 million. \n96.  That same year, McDonald’s began facing public allegations against McDonald’s \nfor its practice of “redlining” Black owner/operators by forcing them into agreements to operate \nolder, lower-volume restaurants in need of costly renovations in Black neighborhoods.  \n97.  Jesse Jackson’s civil rights organization, PUSH, protested McDonald’s practice of \nsystematically placing Black franchisees in less desirable and higher-debt restaurants. The \nNAACP in Chicago and Los Angeles echoed those protests and organized boycotts of the \nrestaurant chain. \n98.  In 1996, McDonald’s Executive Vice President Tom Dentice conceded in a letter \nthat “for business reasons we thought were valid at the time, the company has placed many \nBlack Franchisees in restaurants that have not allowed them to achieve the same level of \neconomic success as their peers.” (Ex. B). McDonald’s admitted that by discriminating against \nBlack franchisees based on their race, it thought it would make more money.  \n99.  This is not the only evidence that McDonald’s knew that it was discriminating \nagainst Black franchisees on the basis of their race for McDonald’s own financial benefit. In \n16 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 17 of 158 PageID #:1804\n1996, McDonald’s CEO Ed Rensi agreed to implement a program that McDonald’s said was \nintended to establish equity between Black and white franchisees. As part of the program, \nMcDonald’s pledged to sell more profitable restaurants to Black franchisees and to offer them \ntemporary rent relief. But McDonald’s never followed through on these pledges to rectify the \ndiscrimination it knew it was perpetuating. Instead, McDonald’s leadership disbanded the \nprogram in 2001, unbeknownst to Plaintiffs. \n100.  If McDonald’s had made any progress to establish equity, it was wiped out when \nSteve Easterbrook and Chris Kempczinski took the reins as CEO and President of McDonald’s \nUSA, respectively, in 2015. Upon assuming the role of CEO, Easterbrook said that the number \nof Black owner/operators at McDonald’s did not matter. This set the stage for the company to \neliminate its nascent equity initiatives. \nMcDonald’s Continuing Practice of Discrimination Against Plaintiffs \n101.  Beginning in 2017, Easterbrook and Kempczinski unveiled the “Bigger Bolder \nVision 2020” program with the goal of modernizing 80% of current McDonald’s restaurants. The \nProgram would require costly renovations for older restaurants, estimated at as much as \n$750,000 per store.  \n102.  McDonald’s knew that the program would eliminate Black owner/operators from \nthe McDonald’s system. That impact was revealed by an impact study conducted by the Boston \nConsulting Group prior to the program’s implementation. Easterbrook and Kempczinski were \naware of the results of the impact study and the disproportionate effect Bigger Bolder Vision \n2020 would have on Black owner/operators, but they relentlessly pushed it anyway because they \nwanted to force Black owner/operators to exit the McDonald’s system.  \n103.  Under Easterbrook’s and Kempczinski’s racially discriminatory tenure as CEO \nand USA President of McDonald’s, respectively, approximately a third of Black owner/operators \n17 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 18 of 158 PageID #:1805\nwere forced out of the McDonald’s system—a much higher percentage than non-Black operators \nwho left during this time. This exodus of Black franchisees coincided with Easterbrook’s \ndecisions to deprioritize Black employees and consumers, including Easterbrook’s purge of \nBlack McDonald’s employees from positions in senior leadership, an intentional decision to \ndirect advertising budgets away from Black consumers, and the resulting decrease in sales to \nBlack consumers.  \n104.  In July 2018, McDonald’s USA demoted Senior Executives Vicki Guster-Hines \nand Domineca Neal, both Black women. Both had relayed or spoken out about Black franchisees \nbeing subjected to discriminatory practices, like unfair grading visits. Their demotions were part \nof McDonald’s purge of 43 Black senior executives during Easterbrook’s tenure, composing \n85% of McDonald’s Black employees who were at Executive Director level and above. Guster-\nHines and Neal sued McDonald’s for discrimination in January 2020. \n105.  The Guster-Hines and Neal complaint revealed inside corporate information to \nPlaintiffs for the first time, including evidence that McDonald’s had been systematically and \nintentionally discriminating against Plaintiffs on the basis of their race. Prior to these revelations, \nMcDonald’s had caused Plaintiffs to believe that McDonald’s was treating Black \nowners/operators the same as white owners/operators.  \n106.  Compounding the problem, given McDonald’s control of information as the \nfranchisor, and given its supposed public commitment to racial equality, Plaintiffs were unaware, \nand they could not know or have learned through due diligence, that McDonald’s was depriving \nthem of franchise opportunities offered to white franchisees and was otherwise discriminating \nagainst them on the basis of their race. \n18 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 19 of 158 PageID #:1806\n107.  In reality, by 2019, the annual cashflow gap between Black and non-Black \nfranchisees increased to $65,706, up more than $45,000 from 2010.  \n108.  Owner-operator Larry Tripplett filed a letter on behalf of the NBMOA to \nMcDonald’s East and West Zone Division Presidents, stating that “the trajectory of the treatment \nof Black Owners is moving backwards. Through no fault of our own we lag behind the general \nmarket in all measures.” (Ex. C). He noted that “[t]he current state of affairs for Black Owners \ncan only be described as hostile” and identified permanent rent reduction as one necessary step, \namong others. (Ex. C). \n109.  By 2020, roughly half of Black franchisees had been forced out of the \nMcDonald’s system, as compared to only 10% of white owner/operators in the same timeframe. \nDespite Easterbrook’s firing in 2020, Black franchisees’ circumstances have not improved under \nnow-CEO Chris Kempczinski. \n110.  Plaintiffs were victims of race discrimination in all aspects of their experiences as \nfranchisees, from acquiring their first store to being forced out of the system.  \n111.  Taken together, Plaintiffs’ factual allegations paint a powerful and detailed \npicture of McDonald’s intentional racial discrimination against Black franchisees, including \nPlaintiffs, and the economic harm that Plaintiffs suffered as a direct result of and solely because \nof that intentional discrimination. \n112.  McDonald’s intentional race discrimination against Plaintiffs followed a tried-\nand-true pattern. To begin, McDonald’s QSCVPs made a racist decision to put Plaintiffs in \ncharge of older, low-volume locations in high-crime areas that were in need of repair. \nMcDonald’s placed franchisees in Black communities that reflected Plaintiffs’ race because \nMcDonald’s thought Black owners should be limited to Black communities because of the color \n19 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 20 of 158 PageID #:1807\nof their skin. In addition, McDonald’s thought that it would benefit McDonald’s bottom line to \nput Black franchisees in Black communities. As a result, Black franchisees were placed in Black \nneighborhoods and could not purchase stores in suburban, white neighborhoods.  \n113.  Conversely, white franchisees were rarely, if ever, placed in stores that served \nBlack consumers. \n114.  Plaintiffs all became franchisees believing that they would have equal access to \nMcDonald’s portfolio, not to just restaurants, but to profitable restaurants. But for being Black, \nMcDonald’s would have granted Plaintiffs that access. \n115.  McDonald’s discrimination in franchise acquisition did not end there. When a \nwhite owner/operator struggled to turn a profit at a store, McDonald’s cast the store off to a \nBlack operator, rather than running it as a company-owned store. \n116.  Once placed in these franchise locations, Plaintiffs faced a series of security and \noperational issues—challenges that McDonald’s knew about and failed to disclose prior to \npurchase. Many of Plaintiffs’ stores were robbed; individuals were killed in these stores or their \nparking lots; and one Plaintiff was violently assaulted on the way home from work. Plaintiffs’ \nemployees feared coming into work. Their stores were constantly in need of repair, as \nindividuals would destroy or graffiti the property.  \n117.  As a result, Plaintiffs were forced to spend much more money than their white \ncounterparts on security and maintenance measures, including security guards, video cameras, \nbulletproof windows, and repairs. McDonald’s knew that Plaintiffs were forced to spend much \nmore money on these measures. \n118.  Plaintiffs also used “security costs” as shorthand for the myriad other costs and \nprofit losses that came with McDonald’s redlining them into low-income neighborhoods. The \n20 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 21 of 158 PageID #:1808\nlocation McDonald’s placed a franchisee dictated the store’s profit margins. Owner/operators in \nlow-income neighborhoods were forced to decrease standard prices of food and drink items to \nsell them, and the customer base in low-income neighborhoods was more likely to buy lower-\nprice items, like a double cheeseburger, as opposed to prices with a higher mark-up, like a drink \nor fries.  \n119.  Even though white and Black owner/operators had the same products, branding, \nand experience, white operators were able to charge higher prices and sell far more profitable \nitems, whereas Black owner/operators, including Plaintiffs, had to sell less profitable products \nfor lower prices, solely because of their race. To analogize, McDonald’s allowed white \nowner/operators to sell their items at Saks Fifth-Avenue prices and forced Black owner/operators \nto sell the same items at Walmart prices because of the company’s racial discrimination. \n120.  Again, McDonald’s discriminated against Black franchisees by deciding to never \nsubsidize these costs for Black franchisees. McDonald’s could have offset the additional costs \nthat Black owner/operators faced by granting rent relief, meaning that it would have charged a \nlower percentage for rent, but McDonald’s did not offer this relief to Black franchisees. At the \nsame time, this practice was commonplace for white operators, as McDonald’s often granted \nthem rent relief when they suffered a dip in sales. But McDonald’s either refused to grant rent \nrelief to Plaintiffs or granted them a negligible amount, especially as compared to their white \ncounterparts, because of their race. \n121.  In spite of McDonald’s stacking the odds against them, Plaintiffs attempted to \novercome these financial hurdles by purchasing more franchise locations and growing their \nbusinesses. But once again, McDonald’s intentional race discrimination prevented their success. \n21 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 22 of 158 PageID #:1809\nMcDonald’s routinely blocked Black owner/operators from purchasing white franchisees’ \nlocations by refusing to sign off on those deals. \n122.  As a result, McDonald’s stuck Black owner/operators in a cycle they could not \nescape from—placing them in low-income, high-crime areas, forcing them to pay unforeseen \nsecurity and operational costs, and prohibiting them from purchasing stores in affluent areas that \ncould have helped alleviate the financial burden. \n123.  McDonald’s standard operating procedure of discriminating against Black \nfranchisees was thrown into starker relief with the implementation of Bigger Bolder Vision 2020. \nDespite knowing that the modernization program would have a disproportionate effect on Black \nowner/operators, McDonald’s pushed ahead with the program anyway.  \n124.  McDonald’s also relied on a well-honed practice of forcing Black \nowner/operators out of the system, which it applied only to Black owner/operators: ramping up \nunannounced inspections on their stores at all times of the day or night at far greater frequency \nand with much greater inconvenience than inspections of white franchisees’ stores. By increasing \ninspections, McDonald’s had a better chance of finding faults at a Black franchisee’s store that \nthey could use to justify deeming them ineligible for expansion or refusing to renew their lease. \nOften, inspections became so incessant and unbearable that Plaintiffs felt they had no choice but \nto exit the system. At other times, the cost of maintenance and security became so high that \nwithout McDonald’s support, Plaintiffs were forced to sell off their stores. Again, McDonald’s \ntreated Black franchisees, including Plaintiffs, this way solely because of the color of their skin. \n125.  Even in the sale of their stores, Plaintiffs were not free from McDonald’s \ndiscrimination and its economic consequences. Rather than allowing Plaintiffs to sell to the \nhighest bidder, as McDonald’s did for white franchisees, McDonald’s again discriminated \n22 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 23 of 158 PageID #:1810\nagainst Plaintiffs based on their race and breached the franchise agreement by arbitrarily \nwithholding consent to prevent Plaintiffs’ sales. In doing so, McDonald’s was able to place the \nwhite owner/operators it had hand-picked into the stores Plaintiffs had turned around from \neconomically depressed to profitable. \n126.  Were it not for Plaintiffs’ race, McDonald’s would not have intentionally placed \nthem in undesirable locations; it would not have denied them financial assistance in operating \nand maintaining those locations; it would not have denied them the opportunity to expand; it \nwould not have subjected them to incessant unannounced inspections to the point they were \nforced out of the system; and it would not have interfered with the sale of their stores to the \nbuyers of their choice. But for Plaintiffs’ race and McDonald’s intentional race discrimination, \nPlaintiffs would have had a chance of succeeding as franchisees.  \n127.  McDonald’s intentional discrimination is evident in the number of Black \nfranchisees in its system as well. From 1998 to 2020, the number of Black franchisees fell from \n377 to 186. Meanwhile, the number of total McDonald’s stores doubled from 15,086 to 38,999. \nStores owned by Black franchisees only earn about two-thirds of the average McDonald’s store.  \n128.  While the facts alleged above amply demonstrate McDonald’s intentional \ndiscrimination against Black franchisees, including Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs’ individual \nexperiences that follow amplify that McDonald’s purposely treated them worse because they \nwere Black and that McDonald’s intentional discrimination caused them massive harm. \nKenneth Manning \n129.  Kenneth Manning owned and operated twenty stores throughout Alabama, \nGeorgia, and North Carolina during his tenure at McDonald’s. He is Black. \n130.  In total, Manning spent 41 years working for McDonald’s and worked in a variety  \n23 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 24 of 158 PageID #:1811\nof roles, including as a store manager and Director of Operations, before pursuing a career as an \nowner/operator.  \n131.  Manning was well-recognized as a leader in the McDonald’s community during  \nhis four-decade long career. He received the NBMOA’s Mentor Award, McDonald’s East \nDivision Second Vice President Award for assisting the entire East Division in achieving results, \nthe NBMOA’s Service Award, the Atlanta Region’s Profit Excellence Award, and the Atlanta \nRegion Climb the Mountain Award.  \n132.  Manning was also a leadership operator serving on the Store Technology Board,  \nchaired the East Division Real & Profit team, served on the NLC Food team, served on the East \nDivision Leadership Council, served on the Lot & Light Pole Task Force, served as Triad Co-op \nVice President and President, served as the East Division NBMOA Second Vice President, \nserved as the Raleigh Region NBMOA Chapter President, and served on the Atlanta Region \nNBMOA. \n133.  In 1991, Manning applied to be an owner/operator but was denied because of \nMcDonald’s racial discrimination. Specifically, McDonald’s discriminated against prospective \nBlack franchisees by limiting their opportunities to enter the system. McDonald’s informed him \nthat they had no stores available for purchase. Instead, they proposed that he supervise a white \nowner’s restaurants and help him grow from one to five stores. \n134.  In March 2001, Vice President of Operations Marty Ranft and Regional Manager \nKaren King approached Manning about purchasing two stores in North Carolina. They told him \non a Thursday that the two stores were available and gave him until Monday to decide whether \nto buy them. Manning decided to accept the offer and purchase them. \n24 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 25 of 158 PageID #:1812\n135.  In 2004, Ranft approached him again about purchasing a third store from Plaintiff \nRonnie Thornton, with the stipulation that he needed to rebuild it within 18 months. Manning \nbought the store and spent more than a million dollars rebuilding it, ultimately making it the \nmost profitable store in the Eastern Division. \n136.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s placed Manning \nin such underperforming stores solely because of his race. In 2009, Vice President of Operations \nfor the Atlanta Region Debbie Stroud offered Manning ten company stores in the Atlanta region, \nwhich were collectively underperforming by $11 million. Manning turned down the deal given \nthe amount of money the stores were losing. \n137.  However, Stroud continued to push these stores on Manning and told him \nexplicitly that McDonald’s wanted to place a Black operator in the region. McDonald’s had \napproached several Black operators about purchasing this location and completing a rebuild \nthere.  \n138.  Stroud sweetened the deal by proposing that if Manning purchased the ten Atlanta \nstores, she would allow him to buy five more stores in Montgomery, Alabama, which would \nsubstantially grow his business. Manning accepted the offer and purchased the ten Atlanta stores \nand five stores in the Montgomery area. In doing so, he became the second largest operator in \nMcDonald’s Eastern Division. \n139.  McDonald’s also discriminated against Manning in his ability to freely sell his \nstores, solely because of his race. In July or August 2009, Vice President of Franchising Jeff \nWilfong called Manning to talk about the 15-store deal. Plaintiff Manning informed Wilfong that \n25 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 26 of 158 PageID #:1813\nhe would be selling his North Carolina stores to his brother, Keith, to which Jeff responded, “I \ndon’t know if I’m gonna approve that deal.” \n140.  Marty Ranft, who was now General Manager of the region, went back and forth \nfor months with Manning about why he was unwilling to approve the deal. Eventually, he \napproved the deal, but only for Ken to sell two of his three North Carolina stores to his brother.  \n141.  McDonald’s did not want to transfer the North Carolina stores to Keith because \nKeith was not making as much money at the time (Keith owned several stores at the time) and \nKenneth’s stores would increase his financial holdings. McDonald’s denied the transfer solely \nbecause of Keith’s race, as it did not want to grow familial Black wealth. \n142.  McDonald’s discrimination against Manning as a Black owner/operator \ncontinued. At an NBMOA conference in Detroit in 2007, Wilfong commented in front of a group \nof Black owner/operators: “Hey, I was wondering why there was no more fried chicken in \nDetroit.” Wilfong received no reprimand or consequences from McDonald’s for making such a \nblatantly racist remark. \n143.  Later on, Plaintiff Gordon Thornton called Manning and relayed that he had told \nWilfong he was racist because he had offered a store to a Latina woman without mentioning to \nany Black operators that it was for sale. Two weeks later, Wilfong met with Manning and told \nhim, “I’ve been labeled a racist, talk to me and let me know if I’m being a racist.” Manning told \nhim, “The way you will not be perceived as a racist is to do right by Black people and people of \ncolor.” \n144.  Again, McDonald’s did not reprimand Wilfong for this discriminatory and \ninappropriate behavior. Instead, it continued to allow his career to flourish at the company. \n26 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 27 of 158 PageID #:1814\n145.  In June 2010, McDonald’s Franchise Legal Counsel John Richardson sent a letter \nblocking Manning from buying profitable stores back in the future from his brother, though that \nhad not originally been part of the franchise agreement or contingency in the deal. White \nowner/operators routinely sell and buy back stores from family members. \n146.  In addition, McDonald’s subjected Manning to an exigent rebuild schedule that it \ndid not require of white owner/operators. In the first year alone after he purchased the Atlanta \nand Montgomery stores, Manning completed three rebuilds of the Atlanta region stores—an \nunheard-of number of rebuilds in that time frame—for $5 million on top of the $16 million he \nhad paid for the stores. McDonald’s had not required any white owner/operator in the region to \ncomplete as many rebuilds in such a short period of time.  \n147.  Regarding one of the three stores, Stroud and McDonald’s Development Director \nVivian Valdivia had requested that Ken complete the rebuild within the first year, though he was \noriginally informed he would have four years to do it. They noted that a company-owned \nMcDonald’s location was being built down the road and implied that they would offer the new \nstore to Ken if he completed the rebuild within the year, which he did. Several months later, \nMcDonald’s demanded that Manning rebuild one of the other Atlanta stores because of its \nleaking roof, which Manning did. \n148.  In October 2011, Vice President of Franchising and Operations Darren Hall \noffered another underperforming store in the area to Manning (“Centerville”). Hall was so \ninsistent that Manning purchase Centerville that he called Manning every night until the night of \nthe sale to ensure that Manning would purchase it. \n149.  In January 2012, Hall informed Manning that McDonald’s was selling the store \ndown the road—originally promised to him—to Jerry Murphy, a white owner/operator based \n27 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 28 of 158 PageID #:1815\nmore than forty miles away. Manning had attended meetings with the construction manager for \nthat store in anticipation of taking it on. Hall stated that they were not offering him the store \nbecause he was not eligible for expansion. Manning knew this explanation was not true, given \nthat Hall had insisted he buy the Centerville location a mere three months ago—a point that he \nraised with Hall. Were it not for Manning’s race, McDonald’s would not have reneged on its \npromise to sell him the company-owned store and sold it to a white operator it had hand-picked. \n150.  Hall immediately retaliated against Manning for speaking up about his unfair \ntreatment. Following his conversation with Hall, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black \noperators out of the system by increasing their inspections of Manning’s stores. Two field \nservice managers visited the store for a few days to conduct an inspection. In the two and a half \nyears prior, Manning had never had McDonald’s employees conduct an inspection of his store. \n151.  Three months later, Chief Franchising Officer John Kujawa approached Manning \nat a meeting and stated, “I hear you’re making a lot of trouble down there in the Atlanta region.” \nManning told Kujawa about Hall’s excuse for not selling the company-owned store to him and \nstated that it was unfair that the store had been promised to him and then retracted. Manning also \nraised the issue of McDonald’s employing two different standards for the stores it offered to \nfranchisees and the stores franchisees sought out themselves. Kujawa commented that he hoped \nMcDonald’s was not ramping up graded visits on Manning’s stores because Manning had \ncomplained about his unfair treatment to Hall. Manning informed him that they were. \n152.  In approximately summer 2012, McDonald’s Business Consultant Myra Overbay \ninformed Manning’s store manager Tammy Horn that McDonald’s was going to force Manning \nout. In response, Manning sent a formal complaint about Overbay to Hall. \n28 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 29 of 158 PageID #:1816\n153.  McDonald’s subjected Overbay to an HR investigation, but she remained as \nManning’s consultant, though McDonald’s advised her not to speak to Manning. However, she \nignored this dictate and yelled at Manning one day outside of a meeting. Like Wilfong, Overbay \nreceived no consequences for her inappropriate behavior and continued to work as a business \nconsultant at McDonald’s. This served as further evidence that McDonald’s employed two \ndifferent standards for Black franchisees and white employees—punishing Black employees who \nspoke out and allowing white employees to act inappropriately without consequence. \n154.  In the fall of 2013, at a meeting, Atlanta QSCVP Darren Hall asked Manning to \nsell all of his stores and refrain from buying any new stores until Hall had identified particular \nlocations for purchase. Manning responded that Hall must want him out of the system because he \nonly had to wait a year for Manning to no longer be eligible to buy again.  \n155.  The retaliation continued. Manning attempted to negotiate deals on his own, but \nHall blocked all of them. Specifically, the stores Manning wanted to buy were sold to other \nowner/operators. \n156.  In December 2013, Manning was able to buy a store from his good friend, Mark \nMines, in Forest Park, Georgia. The store was low-volume and Manning was able to pay cash for \nit since McDonald’s had cut off his financing with Chase Bank.  \n157.  In early 2014, Field Service Manager Ken Jenkins inadvertently sent out an email \ninstructing his business consultants to ramp up grading and noting that “the most powerful \nweapon you have is the pen.” Manning filed a formal complaint to Darren Hall. \n158.  In retaliation for Manning’s complaint, inspections of Manning’s stores became \nincreasingly onerous from then on. Beginning in the summer of 2014, Business Consultant \nWassuf Hajbeh and Field Service Manager Tom Dodd began another series of stringent \n29 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 30 of 158 PageID #:1817\ninspections. One inspection took place on Christmas Eve. At one point, Hall relayed to Manning \nthat Hall’s staff said Manning was “too New York-ish,” which Manning understood to mean that \nhe was too Black. \n159.  During Manning’s last operator review in summer of 2016, QSCVP Valerie \nWilliams met with Manning to discuss selling his last store and leaving the system. Williams \nwanted Manning to say that he was retiring so that it would not look bad on his record, meaning \nthat McDonald’s would otherwise note that he was fired or kicked out of the system. Worn down \nfrom losing everything he had worked his entire life to build, Manning agreed. \n160.  On her way to the meeting, Williams was over an hour late, so Dodd and \nManning called her on speakerphone. Williams said that she was lost and Manning asked if she \nwas heading to his house. Williams responded that she supposed she was at Manning’s house \nbecause she was in front of a nice housing development. When she arrived at the correct address, \nshe told them, “Hey, Ken, you have a nice house.” Dodd and Wassuf, as well as Manning, were \nshocked at Williams’ racist comment. \n161.  Later on, Dodd apologized to Manning for how he had been treated and admitted \nthat he did not feel good doing the Region’s dirty work.  \n162.  As a result of the constant racial harassment, Manning tried to sell his stores in \n2017. He began negotiations with Ed Gerena, who wanted to buy all 16 stores. However, \nMcDonald’s blocked the sale to Gerena and in doing so, prohibited Manning from selling the \nstores for what they were worth. Manning also refinanced his heavy debt load, only to have it \nblocked by Atlanta Regional Finance Director David Knies. \n163.  Facing the pressure to sell, Manning was forced to accept lower offers from the \nbuyers McDonald’s had put forward, all of whom were white. Indeed, Williams pressured him, \n30 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 31 of 158 PageID #:1818\ntelling Manning that if he did not sell his restaurant to John Hurt at the low-ball price they had \npresented, she would get McDonald’s attorney to terminate his franchise agreement. Manning \nimmediately called General Manager and Vice President Greg Watson to file a complaint and \nrequest that Williams be instructed not to threaten him. This interference in the sale of his stores \nfurther demonstrated McDonald’s racial discrimination, as it forced Manning out of the system at \na loss, in favor of its preferred white owner/operators. \n164.  McDonald’s granted the white owner/operators concessions to incentivize the sale \nof Manning’s restaurants, including allowing them to wait longer to complete rebuilds on the \nstores than they had for Manning. But for Manning’s race, McDonald’s would not have stamped \nout his successful business as one of the largest owner/operators in the Eastern Division and \nforced him to sell his stores for less than they were worth. \nKeith Manning \n165.  Keith Manning owned and operated eleven McDonald’s stores in the North \nCarolina region. He is Black. \n166.  Manning began working at McDonald’s in 1977 as a cashier. Between 1977 and \n1991, he worked in variety of roles at McDonald’s, including as a Swing Manager, First \nAssistant to the General Manger, General Manager, Supervisor, and Director of Operations.   \n167.  Manning became an owner/operator on or around September 16, 1992, when he \npurchased his first franchise location in Far Rockaway Queens, New York.  \n168.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s placed Manning \nin such stores, particularly in Far Rockaway Queens and Brooklyn, with low-volume sales and \nhigher operating costs due to crime, higher insurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely \nbecause of his race.  As a result, Manning faced a host of security issues at his restaurants, \n31 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 32 of 158 PageID #:1819\nincluding two shootings at one of his restaurants where two young girls were grazed by a bullet, \nand another individual was shot.  Manning subsequently lost his customer base. As a result, he \nwas forced to sell his restaurants in New York and move to North Carolina. \n169.  In 2000, McDonald’s again placed Manning into predominantly Black \nneighborhoods, in Durham, to substandard locations with low-volume sales and higher operating \ncosts due to crime, higher insurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely because of his \nrace. Marty Ranft, then Director of Operations in the Durham Region, explained to Manning that \nMcDonald’s was looking for someone to operate restaurants in the “hood.”  McDonald’s even \nsent representatives to New York to verify that his stores were located in “inner-city” \nneighborhoods similar to the Durham restaurant location.   \n170.  Around 2010, Manning was excluded from the same rent opportunities provided \nto white franchisees.  Manning contacted then-General Manager Marty Ranft because he had not \nbeen provided with any rent figures in the commitment letter for the lease extension to one of his \nstores. Ranft informed Manning that he needed to sign the commitment letter, and that he should \nnot be concerned about McDonald’s increasing rent. Manning relied on that information in \ndeciding to sign the commitment letter.  \n171.  After Manning had signed, Ranft informed Manning that the rent was nearly \ndoubling, from approximately 8.5 to 14.25%.  Manning and other concerned operators met with \nEast Division President Karen King, who admitted that it was unfair, but McDonald’s was \nraising the rent regardless because Manning could afford the burden. Manning also learned that \nAndrea Endrusick, a white operator, was receiving a rewrite at the same time, but McDonald’s \nwas not forcing her to pay the excessively high rent increase being imposed on Manning. \n32 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 33 of 158 PageID #:1820\n172.  Manning was excluded from the purchase of restaurants in the open market \nthroughout his franchise terms solely because of his race. For example, around 2012, Manning \ncommunicated to Marty Ranft that he wanted to purchase a restaurant in a neighborhood, which \ndid not have a predominantly Black customer base. Ranft told Manning that he was better suited \nto operate among Black customers. \n173.  McDonald’s denied Manning financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. For instance, in 2015, \nManning was operating a store adjacent to a brand-new Walmart. The Vice President & QSCVP, \nYolanda Cook, had presented Manning with an opportunity for a restaurant near a Walmart, with \n20-year projections of sales and profits. The Walmart store, however, closed approximately three \nyears after opening due, in large part, to high crime. Manning then made a reasonable request \nthat McDonald’s reduce his excessively high rent of 16 percent to offset the reduction in sales, \nespecially in light of Walmart’s closing due to high crime in the area. Vice President General \nManager Debbie Stroud informed Manning that McDonald’s could not reduce his rent and she \nprovided no legitimate business justification for why he could not receive the requested financial \nassistance. Were it not for Manning’s race, he would have been provided the permanent rent \nrelief routinely provided to white franchisees. \n174.  McDonald’s provided Manning with misleading financial information and \nconcealed information to restrict his growth into more profitable locations. For example, in 2014, \nMcDonald’s asked Manning to rebuild a store in Durham. After the store opened, the Finance \nManager in the Raleigh region, Kyle Sykes, informed Manning that he would also be responsible \nfor the past through rent of the restaurant. This information was never provided to Manning until \n33 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 34 of 158 PageID #:1821\nthe rebuild was completed. As a result, this lowered the value of the restaurant because it induced \nless cash flow, and Manning was forced to sell the store in 2017.  \n175.  Around 2017, McDonald’s instructed Manning to adopt the new Bigger Bolder \nVision plan. That plan required him to renovate four of his stores within three years. McDonald’s \npressured Manning to complete renovations sooner. Vice President General Manager Debbie \nStroud and Vice President & QSCVP Tim Fisher met with Manning on a Sunday afternoon and \ngave an ultimatum—either complete renovations a year sooner, or sell his stores. McDonald’s \nenforced its renovation standards more stringently on Manning, as compared to white \nowner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising agreement. \n176.  Manning had no choice but to exit on McDonald’s terms, at a loss.  \n177.  As a result, Manning was forced to sell all nine stores in 2017 for a total of $2.8 \nmillion, destroying a nearly 30-year process of creating generational wealth and ownership for \nManning and his family.   \n178.  But for Manning’s race, McDonald’s would not have engaged in the continuing \nmisconduct alleged herein.   \nDelores and Christine Crawford \n179.  Delores Crawford and her daughter, Christine Crawford, are former McDonald’s \nowner/operators in the Augusta, Georgia, region, who owned nine stores during their tenure with \nMcDonald’s. They are Black. \n180.  Following her franchisee training in 1988, Delores expressed interest in \npurchasing stores in Aiken, South Carolina, where her family was based. Instead, the Franchising \nOfficer and QSCVP proposed a store in Beaufort, South Carolina.  \n34 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 35 of 158 PageID #:1822\n181.  After Delores had accepted the Beaufort store, but before she moved, McDonald’s \nstarted selling company-owned stores in the Aiken-Augusta area. However, McDonald’s would \nnot allow Delores to give up the Beaufort store in exchange for purchasing stores in her \nhometown. Instead, McDonald’s offered those restaurants to Tommy and Pam Powers—white \nowner/operators based much farther away in Barnwell, South Carolina. As a result, Delores \npurchased the store in Beaufort, South Carolina, and spent her first two and a half years as a \nfranchisee living away from her family. \n182.  In February 1990, McDonald’s offered to buy her Beaufort restaurant in exchange \nfor the purchase of two if its company-owned restaurants, one in North Augusta, South Carolina, \nand the other in Augusta, Georgia. \n183.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, in 1995, McDonald’s offered \nDelores the “Regency” store in Augusta, Georgia. McDonald’s informed her that Marvin \nWhaley, the former white owner/operator, did not have the comfort level to run a restaurant in \nthe neighborhood. The Regency store was located in a predominantly Black, low-income area \nwith security issues. Delores agreed to purchase the store. \n184.  In 1999, Delores purchased another store in Augusta, Georgia, that had been built \nin the Children’s Medical Center. \n185.  Meanwhile, Christine entered McDonald’s Next Generation program in 2003 and \nwas approved in 2005 to become an owner/operator. \n186.  In 2012, the Crawfords purchased a second store in North Augusta and the year \nafter, in 2013, bought another store in Augusta, Georgia (the “Jimmie Dyess” location). \n35 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 36 of 158 PageID #:1823\n187.  During their careers as owner/operators, the Crawfords established themselves as \nleaders in both McDonald’s and their local community. Delores was recognized as Female \nEntrepreneur of the Year and Minority Business of the Year in her community. Within \nMcDonald’s, she was a founding member of the Women Operators Network (“W.O.N.”), served \non the NBMOA Board, served as a Board Member for global Ronald McDonald House \nCharities, and served as co-op treasurer. Christine was elected co-op President twice, elected \nVice Chair of the East Division Leadership Council (out of 4,000 restaurants represented), and \nserved on several national leadership teams, including menu innovation and experience of the \nfuture. Christine planned several Next Generation Leadership trainings for the NBMOA and \nW.O.N., and received the 2007 Spirit Award, among other honors. \n188.  Throughout their tenure, the Crawfords faced serious security issues at their \nstores. At the Regency location, an individual was murdered in the parking lot, and there was at \nleast one armed robbery and an instance in which customers kicked in and broke a window. The \nCrawfords employed an off-duty sheriff to guard the location on weekend evenings. At the North \nAugusta location, an individual attempted an armed burglary. At the Med Center location, there \nwas at least one robbery and a suicide in the parking lot. The Crawfords were forced to spend \nmuch more on security to safeguard their stores. \n189.  In addition to spending more on security, to remain eligible for growth by passing \nbusiness reviews, the Crawfords had to fund extraordinary labor costs. They paid more on labor \nthan the top 25% of McDonald’s restaurants. \n190.  At a co-op meeting, Jerry Baine, a white owner/operator, bragged that he spent \nonly 13-14% of sales on labor costs. Franchise Manager Bill Pegg acknowledged that this was \nunacceptable, but still allowed Baine’s operations to grow. \n36 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 37 of 158 PageID #:1824\n191.  Almost immediately after purchasing the Jimmie Dyess store in 2012, the \nCrawfords began facing financial issues at the location, as it was underperforming by $700,000 \nper year. The Crawfords requested rent relief and McDonald’s awarded them only $20,000 in \nrelief, far less relief than McDonald’s provides to its white franchisees. McDonald’s denied the \nCrawfords financial assistance in the form of meaningful rent relief, routinely offered to white \nowner/operators, solely because they were Black. \n192.  Additionally, the Crawfords shared their concerns about a new McDonald’s \nlocation opening up near Jimmie Dyess, known as the Grovetown location.  \n193.  McDonald’s has a dedicated “impact fund” that it uses to mitigate the financial \nimpact a new restaurant has on another location’s sales. But rather than pulling from the impact \nfund to assist the Crawfords, who had recently renovated the Jimmie Dyess location as part of \nthe “Create Your Own Taste Test” program, McDonald’s awarded the location to Jerry Baine’s \ndaughter as a retirement gift to him. \n194.  But for the Crawfords’ race, they would have been offered financial assistance \nfrom the impact fund or been offered to purchase the restaurant, like Jerry Baine’s daughter. \n195.  The Crawfords voiced their concerns about McDonald’s lack of support to then-\nCEO Don Thompson and Mike Andres, who both retired shortly thereafter. In her December \n2014 e-mail to Thompson, Christine detailed the financial issues with Jimmie Dyess, and \nMcDonald’s lack of response, and noted that “[t]he most unfortunate part is that this is not an \natypical situation.”  \n196.  Ultimately, the Crawfords realized that they could not financially maintain their \nrestaurants. In a meeting with the region and their accountants, the Crawfords realized that they \nhad lost $600,000 on the Jimmie Dyess restaurant, while McDonald’s had made $900,000 during \n37 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 38 of 158 PageID #:1825\nthe same time period off of the restaurant’s rent. To continue operations, they were borrowing \nagainst Delores’s and her husband’s retirement funds. In October 2017, they put their restaurants \nup for sale. \n197.  Christine sent Franchising Officer Valerie Williams a list of potential buyers she \nwanted to speak to, including Jim Booth. Williams replied that the QSCVP would provide names \nof potential buyers who were supported by the region, meaning that they had been hand-picked \nby McDonald’s. \n198.  Christine also sent the list of potential buyers to General Manager of the Atlanta \nregion Greg Watson. Watson told Christine that she would only be able to sell her restaurants \nonly to “buyers that are included in the class picture of the future of the region,” whom \nMcDonald’s would identify and bring to the Crawfords.  \n199.  After a deal did not go forward with one potential buyer, Christine asked Watson \nabout offering the restaurants to Jim Booth. Watson instructed her to meet with David Cravens \nfirst. \n200.  The Crawfords ended up selling their restaurants for $5.1 million in 2018 to \nDavid Cravens, a white owner/operator McDonald’s had hand-picked. The Crawfords would \nhave been able to sell their restaurants for a significantly higher amount if McDonald’s had not \ninterfered with their efforts to sell to the buyer of their choice. This interference in the sale \nfurther demonstrated McDonald’s racial discrimination, as it forced the Crawfords out of the \nsystem at a loss, in favor of its preferred white owner/operator. \nVan Jakes \n201.  Van Jakes owned and operated five McDonald’s stores in the Atlanta region. He \nis Black. \n38 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 39 of 158 PageID #:1826\n202.  Jakes was formerly the President of the Atlanta Black McDonald’s Owner \nOperator Association, served on the Executive Board of the Greater Atlanta McDonald’s Owner \nOperator Association, and was President of the African American Consumer Market Target \nMarketing Subcommittee.  \n203.  Jakes is also a former professional football player in the National Football \nLeague, where he played for notable teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, and \nGreen Bay Packers. He played cornerback, but “never took a hit as hard as the ones McDonald’s \nput on me during my 24 years as an operator.” \n204.  Jakes retired from football and yearned to be an entrepreneur. Around 1994, he \nbecame an owner/operator in Atlanta. In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of \nintentionally placing Black franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, \nMcDonald’s forced Jake to purchase four stores with a “take-it-or-leave-it” attitude. All of the \nstores were in economically distressed, high-crime areas with a predominantly Black customer \nbase. All needed major rebuilds or renovations. All required security to protect employees, \ncustomers and property. Jakes was never offered a store in a white neighborhood and was only \noffered these stores solely because of his race. \n205.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Jakes, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. McDonald’s required Jakes to reinvest in his Panola Road, Georgia, restaurant three \ntimes over the course of his franchise term. By contrast, McDonald’s did not require a white \nowner/operator, Patrick Dennis, in the same region to make any reinvestments to his restaurant \nlocated just a few miles down the road in Peachtree City, Georgia. These changes included \nmodernizations that McDonald’s told Jakes were nationally mandated, such as changing the \n39 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 40 of 158 PageID #:1827\ngreen roof to a red roof. McDonald’s would not have required such trivial and constant \nrenovations by Jakes but for his race. \n206.  McDonald’s also required Jakes to invest in restaurants within short time frames, \nnot required of white franchisees, in locations McDonald’s knew would fail to generate an \nadequate return on the owner’s individual investment. Jakes purchased two stores in Stone \nMountain from a white owner/operator who had not been complying with company standards.  \nYet, when Jakes purchased the store, McDonald’s told him he could not grow other stores until \nhe complied with conditions the company had not demanded of the white owner/operators.   \n207.  As a result, around 2014, Jakes informed McDonald’s regional staff, including \nVice President of Franchising and Operations Darren Hall and General Manager Sharlene Smith, \nthat he intended to sell the stores because the previous owner left them in such terrible condition. \nJakes wanted to purchase a new store being built. Rather than approving Jakes’s decision, \nMcDonald’s demanded that he continue rebuilding the two dilapidated stores and awarded the \nnewly built store to a white owner/operator.  \n208.  Jakes had also communicated to county officials that he sought to purchase the \nstore. But because McDonald’s would not give Black owners/operators like Jakes the \nopportunity to purchase the new store, county board officials refused to approve the new store’s \ndevelopment. As a result, Darren Hall and Sharlene Smith informed Jakes that he was not to talk \nto county officials.  \n209.  Jakes’s efforts for equality were not received well by McDonald’s regional staff.  \nIn retaliation, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Jakes’s stores to give him bad business reviews. These reviews, in \nturn, were used as pretext to force him out of the McDonald’s system. Inspectors would regularly \n40 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 41 of 158 PageID #:1828\narrive unannounced late on Friday nights with a goal of documenting the smallest infraction. \nMcDonald’s Vice President of Operations for the Atlanta Region Debbie Stroud would \nspecifically visit Jakes’s stores herself to find infractions and force him out of the business—a \ntactic she employed with other Black owner/operators she wanted to push out of business. \n210.  One inspector suggested to Jakes that he, as a mere three-store operator, should \njust give up, sell, and get out of business. Were it not for Jakes’s race, he would not have been \nsubjected to unequal inspections that were not directed at white operators. White franchisees in \nthe region, such as Keith Sirockman, were allowed to dictate the circumstances for inspections, \nincluding negotiating the date and time. \n211.  Jakes also served as President of the Purchasing Committee for McDonald’s. In \nthat capacity, he learned that McDonald’s would allow white operators to become vendors, \nincluding advertising vendors, while denying that same opportunity to Black operators. Around \n2015, Jakes sought to become a vendor to distribute disposable gloves within restaurants. Jakes \nprovided McDonald’s with samples, submitted a bid, and waited patiently for approval.  \nAlthough he was approved by a local purchasing committee in Atlanta, McDonald’s denied \nJakes the opportunity without any legitimate business justification. But for his race, Jakes would \nhave been allowed to become a vendor. \n212.  As McDonald’s continued to prevent Jakes from expanding his business, he was \nforced out of the system and lost five stores in 2016. \n213.  Were it not for Jakes’s race, McDonald’s would not have engaged in the \ncontinuing misconduct alleged herein, which destroyed a nearly 20-year process of creating \ngenerational wealth and ownership for Jakes and his family.   \nAnnis Alston-Staley and Harry Staley \n214.  Annis Alston-Staley and her husband, Harry Staley, owned and operated ten  \n41 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 42 of 158 PageID #:1829\nMcDonald’s stores in the New Jersey region. They are Black. \n215.  Prior to becoming a franchisee in 1995, Annis worked for twenty years at \nMcDonald’s corporate division, including as a Regional Manager and Senior Vice President for \nfive years. \n216.  In that role, Annis sat in on corporate meetings in which McDonald’s would name  \nproblematic owner/operators that they wanted to force out of the system. The majority of owners \nthey identified as problematic were Black. \n217.  She witnessed how McDonald’s forced Black operators out of the system by \nconducting frequent, unannounced inspections, blaming the operators for cash flow issues, and \nby unfairly rating Black operators’ performance. In doing so, they were able to justify their \ndecision not to rewrite Black operators’ stores. Additionally, she observed how McDonald’s \noffered stores that were difficult to run to Black operators. \n218.  McDonald’s denied the couple opportunities to purchase franchises in their \ndesired location solely because they were Black. When Annis and Harry decided to purchase a \nstore as franchisees in 1995, she asked to be placed in Raleigh. McDonald’s typically honors \nsenior management’s location choice when they transition to becoming owner/operators. \nHowever, the Regional Manager rejected her request. The Regional Manager offered her stores \nat the North Carolina shore, which were notoriously difficult to run, given the highly seasonal \nnature of the customer base. \n219.  Annis and Harry refused to take on those locations and opted to purchase stores in \nMiddlesex and Pompton Plains, New Jersey, in 1995, at the direction of McDonald’s Zone \nManager, who had been Annis’s prior supervisor. The couple then purchased two more locations \nin Union and Vauxhall, NJ. Regional Manager Mason Smoot and President of the East Zone \nDivision incentivized the couple to purchase the Vauxhall store, located on the turnpike, by \n42 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 43 of 158 PageID #:1830\npromising them that McDonald’s would make certain improvements to the store and projected \nthat sales would increase to $3.5 million as a result. McDonald’s never followed through on that \npromise and never made the improvements. \n220.  McDonald’s set a high rent for the Vauxhall location, charging the Staleys 15% of \ngross sales per year, compared to the typical rate of 6-10% per year. Additionally, the location \nnever met McDonald’s projected sales of $3.5 million per year. McDonald’s typically set high \nrents like this on low-volume stores that it knew would not fulfill their projected sales. \n221.  The Staleys accepted McDonald’s proposal to take on a newly built store in \nSomerville, New Jersey. Like the Vauxhall store before it, McDonald’s managers provided \ninaccurate sales records and projections for the store’s revenue to encourage the couple to \npurchase the store. In reality, the Somerville store was substandard, low-volume, and located in a \nflood plain. McDonald’s also did not disclose to the Staleys prior to their purchase that the \nlocation had strict noise ordinances in place, which hampered sales, nor did it disclose the flood \nplain, which they knew about.  \n222.  Both Harry’s son and nephew entered the Next Generation program and qualified \nto become store managers. However, they could not obtain a review for approval to become \nfranchisees because their assigned consultant would not put them forward. In the end, neither \nHarry’s son nor nephew ended up receiving the review needed to qualify as a prospective \nfranchisee. \n223.  Annis and Harry decided to sell their remaining stores because the cost of staying \nin business had become too high, as a direct result of McDonald’s unreasonable demands that \nthey rebuild and renovate their stores. \n43 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 44 of 158 PageID #:1831\n224.  Were it not for the Staleys’ race, McDonald’s would have allowed them to \npurchase stores in Raleigh, would have charged them less rent, and would have disclosed to them \nthat the restaurant in Somerville would make less money because of the applicable noise \nordinance.  \nRobert Bonner \n \n225.  Robert Bonner is a former owner and operator of six stores in Illinois and the St. \nLouis region. He is Black. \n226.  Bonner received recognition for his leadership in the local communities where he \noperated, including investing nearly $1 million into community programs. \n227.  Bonner first became an owner/operator in 1990 when he purchased a store in East \nSt. Louis, a predominantly Black neighborhood. The store had historically low-volume sales and \nhigher operating costs, such as higher security costs due to crime, higher insurance rates, and \nhigher employee turnover. McDonald’s did not support Bonner’s purchase of the store and \ndenied him meaningful support to improve the business location, while locations with white \ncustomer bases were routinely provided such assistance.   \n228.  McDonald’s considered Bonner to be too independent and influential as a Black \noperator and sought to keep a close watch on him.  Regional staff communicated to Bonner that \nhe was simply a “glorified manager” for the company and nothing more.  \n229.  McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Bonner’s stores. Regional staff began increasing the scope of their \ninspections and would regularly arrive unannounced with a goal of documenting the smallest \ninfractions. Were it not for Bonner’s race, he would not have been subjected to a campaign of \nunannounced, stringent inspections. \n44 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 45 of 158 PageID #:1832\n230.  Around 2013, McDonald’s sought to increase the pressure on Bonner and \ninformed him that they were adding new requirements, one of which would be investing in a full \nremodel of his store for a McCafé, which is a café-style chain owned by McDonald’s. Regional \nstaff informed Bonner that the investment was obligatory and that he would need to take out a \nsizeable loan.  Despite McDonald’s claim that these investments were mandatory, McDonald’s \ndid not require white franchisees to make investments in similar locations to Bonner’s where the \ninvestment was unlikely to generate an adequate return. McDonald’s also took a starkly different \napproach when one of its nationally-imposed strategies did not work—Bonner knew that \nMcDonald’s allowed Black operators to flounder and ultimately to fail, while McDonald’s \nhelped white operators remain afloat through measures like rent relief.  \n231.  McDonald’s also denied Bonner the same growth opportunities to higher-volume, \nlower-cost stores that it offered to white franchisees. On multiple occasions between 2005 and \n2013, McDonald’s prevented Bonner from both selling his stores and purchasing new locations. \nFor example, Bonner had a deal with Steve Short to sell his stores for approximately $800,000.  \nHowever, Regional Manager Robert Sanders communicated to Short that he planned to buy \nBonner’s store for much less and stated, “I’ll be damned if I let a Black operator be much richer \nthan me.”  As a result, Bonner had to sell the store for less approximately 25% less than the deal \nhe had lined up, and as a result was unable to complete a planned deal to purchase seven stores in \nthe Oklahoma region.  Bonner also sought to purchase a store in the Atlanta region. Sanders \ncontacted the Regional Manager in Atlanta and encouraged him not to sell to Bonner. Were it not \nfor Bonner’s race, McDonald’s management would not have interfered with his sales and \nprevented his success as a franchisee. \n45 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 46 of 158 PageID #:1833\n232.  As a result of McDonald’s efforts to prevent Bonner from expanding and its \ndesire to push a successful Black operator out of the system, Bonner was forced to sell his stores \nin 2013.  \n233.  But for Bonner’s race, McDonald’s would not have engaged in the continuing \nmisconduct alleged herein, which destroyed a nearly 23-year process of creating generational \nwealth and ownership for Bonner and his family. \nLarry Brown \n \n234.  Larry Brown is a former owner and operator of 10 stores in the Iowa region.  He \nis Black. \n235.  Brown first became a McDonald’s franchise owner/operator in 2000.   \n236.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores, between 2000 and 2017, McDonald’s placed Brown in \nstores with low-volume sales and higher operating costs, solely because of his race.   \n237.  To force him into these locations, McDonald’s provided Brown with false \nfinancial information to induce him to purchase McDonald’s least desirable franchises, and made \nfalse statements about the availability of other franchise locations to restrict his growth into more \nprofitable locations. Around 2013, McDonald’s informed Brown that it wanted to build a new \nstore in between his two stores.  Regional staff provided him with an ultimatum that if he did not \npurchase the store, McDonald’s would sell it to another owner.  McDonald’s provided false \nfinancial information and made revenue projections that McDonald’s knew were not realistic, \nand which turned out to be nearly $1 million more than the actual revenue, all in an effort to \ninduce Brown to purchase this store, which he did.  \n46 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 47 of 158 PageID #:1834\n238.  Around 2015, McDonald’s denied Brown financial support to allow him to \novercome the hardships he faced because of McDonald’s false statements about the financial \nviability of these stores. McDonald’s denied Brown financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. \n239.  McDonald’s attempted to place Brown into a location where the city planned to \nconstruct a highway bypass. McDonald’s intentionally concealed this information from Brown, \nwho learned about the bypass just before he entered into the contract for the restaurant.   \n240.  In another instance, Brown sought to purchase another restaurant and McDonald’s \nyet again concealed information about a planned bypass.  Brown finally learned about the bypass \nand road construction planned from the zoning department.  At a follow-up meeting on the deal, \nBrown confronted McDonald’s regional staff, including General Manager Kim Corral and Vice \nPresident Kevin Lyon, who provided Brown with no legitimate business reason as to why they \nhad concealed the construction. Instead, McDonald’s retaliated against Brown for rejecting a \nstore and sought to prevent him from acquiring a new store.    \n241.  But for Brown’s race, McDonald’s would not have provided him with false \nfinancial information to induce him to purchase McDonald’s least desirable locations, or \nretaliated against him for opposing their mistreatment of him.  \n242.  McDonald’s intentionally denied Brown purchase opportunities because of his \nrace.   Around 2012, Brown negotiated with a franchise owner in Iowa and agreed to purchase \nten new restaurants.  The agreement was presented to McDonald’s for final approval. \nMcDonald’s Vice President Walt Maney informed Brown that he was reserving the restaurants \nfor purchase by McDonald’s Corporation Executives Sue Immick and Dave Roberts, both of \n47 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 48 of 158 PageID #:1835\nwhom were white.  But for Brown’s race, McDonald’s would not have interfered with his \nbusiness deal.  \n243.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Brown, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. McDonald’s gave Brown six months to complete the renovations on one of his stores, \nwhile the previous white owner/operator, Steve Nelson, was allowed to operate the store for \nyears without making such renovations.  \n244.  When Brown complained about McDonald’s lack of support, McDonald’s \ndeployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by increasing their inspections of \nBrown’s stores. Regional staff began conducting unreasonable and unequal inspections of \nPlaintiffs’ restaurants to generate bad business reviews in retaliation for Brown’s complaints. \nThey used these reviews, in turn, as pretext to force Brown out of the McDonald’s system \nbecause of his race. Inspectors would regularly arrive unannounced, late at night at Brown’s \nstores with the goal of documenting the smallest infraction. But for Brown’s race, he would not \nhave been subjected to unequal inspections that were not directed at white operators.   \n245.  McDonald’s intentionally placed Brown in an untenable economic position, so \nthat Brown had no choice but to exit on McDonald’s terms, at a loss.  In 2017, McDonald’s \ninstructed a white owner/operator, David Roberts, to “low ball” Brown by offering less for his \nstores than they were worth. This interference in the sale further demonstrated McDonald’s racial \ndiscrimination, as it forced Brown out of the system at a loss, in favor of its preferred white \nowner/operator.  \n246.  After the sale was complete, McDonald’s provided Roberts with the assistance \nthat it had never offered Brown. \n48 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 49 of 158 PageID #:1836\nBenny and Eleanor Clark \n \n247.  Benny Clark and his wife, Eleanor Clark, are former McDonald’s franchise \nowners and operators of four stores in the Columbia, South Carolina, region. They are Black. \n248.  The Clarks first became McDonald’s franchise owner/operators in 1999 in \nColumbia, South Carolina. \n249.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, between 1999 and 2019, \nMcDonald’s placed the Clarks into substandard locations with low-volume sales and higher \noperating costs due to crime, higher insurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely \nbecause of their race. The Clarks sought more profitable locations, but McDonald’s denied them \nthe opportunity to purchase these restaurants because of their race. \n250.  McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of the Clarks’ stores to generate bad business reviews. The Clarks \nreceived poorer reviews than white owner/operators like Sandy Webb, whose restaurants were in \nsimilar or worse condition. Were it not for the Clarks’ race, they would not have been subjected \nto unequal inspections that were not directed at white operators.   \n251.  Around 2019, McDonald’s informed the Clarks that they were no longer \ninterested in supporting small operators with only a few restaurants, as a result of Bigger Bolder \nVision 2020. The Clarks appealed to the national headquarters, particularly given that white \nowner/operators were allowed to continue operations for either a few restaurants or a single \nrestaurant.  Yet, McDonald’s never provided the Clarks with any financial relief to remain in \nbusiness.   \n49 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 50 of 158 PageID #:1837\n252.  McDonald’s placed the Clarks in an untenable position of economic duress, so \nthat the Clarks had no choice but to exit on McDonald’s terms, at a loss. The Clarks were forced \nto sell their stores in 2019.  \nGlenda Claypool \n \n253.  Glenda Claypool brings this action, on behalf of, and pending appointment as \nPersonal Representative of the Estate of her late husband, Sherman Claypool, a former \nMcDonald’s franchise owner and operator of five stores in the Milwaukee region. He was Black. \n254.  Claypool first became a McDonald’s franchise owner/operator in 1971. He was \none of the founding members of the NBMOA and attended the first convention for the \norganization in May 1972.  In May 2022, the Illinois House of Representatives passed a \nresolution acknowledging Claypool, among the other founding members, for laying the \nfoundation for “African American entrepreneurs in the United States today.” \n255.  Unfortunately, Claypool was treated differently based on his race within the \nMcDonald’s Corporation. In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally \nplacing Black franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s placed \nClaypool in stores with low-volume sales and higher operating costs due to crime, higher \ninsurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely because of his race. Claypool faced a \nseries of security issues at his stores: his employees were frequently robbed and in one incident, \none man was shot.  Field Consultant Diane Hatterson told Claypool that white regional staff were \nuncomfortable coming to Black neighborhoods. \n256.  Despite being pigeonholed into Black communities, Claypool was not provided \nthe social and cultural support McDonald’s provided to owner/operators in white communities.  \n50 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 51 of 158 PageID #:1838\nFor example, Claypool created a program where he would take the restaurant sales from \nJuneteenth and give scholarships to underserved Black youth in the community.  \n257.  When regional staff learned about the Claypool’s program, Field Consultant \nDiane Hatterson and other regional staff informed him that they could not have a scholarship for \nBlack youth, regardless of the holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black \npeople. Were it not for Claypool’s race, he would never have been prevented from creating \ncommunity programs for his Black customer base.     \n258.  Despite being relegated to substandard locations, McDonald’s denied Claypool \nmeaningful support to allow him to overcome the financial hardships it created, while white \nfranchisees were routinely provided such assistance. Around 2014, a reckless driver drove into \nthe store, which suspended Claypool’s operations for weeks. In addition, a truck fell into a \nsinkhole in front of Claypool’s store, which prevented customers from entering the store or \naccessing the drive-through for about eight months. Claypool sought financial assistance from \nMcDonald’s because of these incidents but was denied. By contrast, McDonald’s provided \nfinancial aid to white owner/operators in the area, like Steve Killian.  \n259.  McDonald’s also deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system \nby increasing their inspections of Claypool’s stores to generate bad business reviews. Inspectors \nwould regularly arrive unannounced late on Friday nights with the goal of documenting the \nsmallest infraction at Claypool’s store. Around 2012, Field Consultant Alejandra Herrera would \narrive at unreasonable hours to inspect Claypool’s store, including on the night of a snowstorm.  \nOn other occasions, McDonald’s would send inspectors to spend more than an hour analyzing \nevery salad dressing in the restaurant. But for Claypool’s race, he would not have been subjected \nto these unreasonable and unequal inspections that were not directed at white operators.   \n51 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 52 of 158 PageID #:1839\n260.  McDonald’s required Claypool to invest in a remodel within a short timeframe, \nnot required of white franchisees, in locations McDonald’s knew would fail to generate an \nadequate return on Claypool’s individual investments.  \n261.  In 2014, McDonald’s informed Claypool that he needed to remodel immediately, \nor they would not renew his lease. Because of the time crunch and financial hardship, Claypool \nwas forced to sell his store to a white owner/operator, Jeff Sterns. Strikingly, McDonald’s did not \nrequire Sterns to remodel immediately. Instead, it provided him financial support and gave him \nat least seven years to remodel the store. This differential standard for remodeling further \ndemonstrated McDonald’s racial discrimination, as it denied Claypool an extension to remodel \nbut offered that same extension to a white owner/operator. \nJuneth Daniel \n262.  Juneth Daniel owned and operated four McDonald’s stores in the Alabama region. \nShe is Black. \n263.  In 1998, Juneth Daniel started working at McDonald’s as a shift manager on \nweekends and during summer break between college semesters. In 2000, she graduated college, \nbecame a full-time manager, and attended Hamburger University.  \n264.  From there, Daniel worked her way up the ranks, receiving multiple promotions \nin the process. Between 2006 and 2008, Daniel applied and was approved to become a \nMcDonald’s franchise owner/operator after interviewing with McDonald’s East Division \nFranchising Officer Marion Foran and East Division Franchising Manager Toni Nightlinger.  \n265.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, QSCVP Debbie Stroud \ndirected Daniel to visit franchise store opportunities, all in Black neighborhoods, all with low \n52 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 53 of 158 PageID #:1840\nsales, and all requiring renovations. Stroud would not have directed Daniel to these various \nlocations but for her race. \n266.  In February 2008, McDonald’s presented Daniel with a new store location in \nMontgomery, Alabama (“Eastchase”). The rent was 15.5% and projected to bring in $2.6 million \nin sales. Daniel was not aware at the time that no seasoned operators in the co-op were interested \nin purchasing the Eastchase store given its high rent. During negotiations, no one from \nMcDonald’s ever informed Daniel of the possibility that another franchise location might be \nbuilt near the Eastchase Store within a few years.  \n267.   Daniel entered into a BFL with McDonald’s. Part of the agreement was that \nDaniel would purchase a store in Union Springs, Alabama (“Union Springs”)—a location that no \nother operator wanted because of its location, low sales, and investment requirements. \nMcDonald’s ran it as a company-owed store prior to Daniel’s purchase and had not completed \nreinvestments on the store. Additionally, the Union Springs store was located in a low-income, \npredominantly Black, rural town and hiring for the store was very difficult. \n268.  The Eastchase store’s sales never reached the $2.6 million in sales McDonald’s \nhad projected. As a result, she financially struggled to acquire the Union Springs Store. \nNevertheless, in September 2009, Daniel purchased the Union Springs restaurant, which was \nalso located in a predominantly Black, low-income area.  \n269.  Daniel requested rent relief for the Eastchase store because it was not meeting \nsales projections, which McDonald’s only partially granted and granted only for one year. \nMcDonald’s denied Daniel financial assistance in the form of meaningful rent relief, which was \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because she was Black. \n53 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 54 of 158 PageID #:1841\n270.  Over the next few years, Daniel struggled to turn Eastchase, Selma, and Union \nSprings into profitable franchises. Union Springs struggled to bring in revenue because of the \nprofitability of Selma, and the two stores operated under a blended rent system. Eastchase carried \nhigh rent and costs, while Selma carried extra costs in terms of security and the renovations \nrequired upon purchase. Meanwhile, the Union Springs store required early renovations and \nextra costs in terms of security, including an armored car service, as well as maintenance and \nrepairs. \n271.  In May 2010, Daniel acquired two more locations in Selma, one of which was \nlocated in a Walmart (“Walmart Store”). Both these stores were located in high-crime, low-\nvolume areas, and no other franchisees were interested in operating them.  \n272.   Because this was the only opportunity to grow as a franchisee that McDonald’s \noffered to Daniel, she took on the stores. McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more \nstringently on Daniel, as compared to white owner/operators, solely because of her race and in \nviolation of the franchising agreement. For example, as part of the agreement between \nMcDonald’s and Daniel, she had to renovate the lobby in the Selma location within six months \nof purchasing the store.  \n273.  However, Daniel had to request an extension from General Manager of the \nAtlanta Region Harry Coaxum for the remodel because she could not afford to renovate the \nlobby due to Eastchase’s and Union Spring’s low sales. Coaxum denied Daniel’s request, telling \nher that she bought the stores under the requirement to renovate. This was the despite the fact \nthat on transition, the Selma store had no managers, high theft, high crime, no employees, and \nwas located in a poverty-stricken area. Daniel was forced to live in a local hotel for days at a \n54 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 55 of 158 PageID #:1842\ntime when she took the store over in order to improve operations, while at the same time \nmanaging operations for her other locations that were located an hour to an hour and a half away. \n274.  Even though McDonald’s inaccurately projected much higher sales for the \nEastchase store, McDonald’s never adjusted the price or lowered the rent on the store. The \nlocation never reached McDonald’s projection of $2.6 million per year.  \n275.  In or around 2014, Daniel met with Vice President and General Manager Sharlene \nSmith and Finance Manager Tanya Squire to discuss her stores and potentially receiving \nfinancial assistance from McDonald’s. During this meeting, Smith and Squire scolded Daniel for \nleasing office space for her business. Because Daniel operated locations in three different \ncounties, she needed the office space to store equipment, hold meetings, and conduct day-to-day \nbusiness operations. Despite this and the fact that many of her white counterparts had office \nspace, Smith and Squire told her it was an unnecessary expense. Rather than aiding Daniel, \nMcDonald’s, via Smith and Squire, blamed her for the economic harm McDonald’s had caused \nthrough inaccurate projections because of her race. \n276.  In or around 2015, McDonald’s corporate management asked Daniel about her \nopinion on whether Technology Consultant Bob Coneen should be promoted to Business \nConsultant. Daniel gave her honest assessment that Coneen had poor interactions with her staff, \nincluding swearing and yelling at one of her managers, and belittling Daniel in their interactions. \nDespite her complaints, McDonald’s promoted him to Business Consultant. \n277.  In or around 2015, Daniel began negotiations with Plaintiff Kenneth Manning to \npurchase his Taylor Road store and sell her Selma location. Now-General Manager Darren Hall \nkilled the deal, without providing any explanation, and allowed the location to be sold to Ronald \n55 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 56 of 158 PageID #:1843\nHay, a white owner/operator. But for Daniel’s race, Hall would have allowed the sale to go \nthrough. \n278.  In or around 2016, Daniel complained to QSCVP Valerie Williams about \ncontinuing racist harassment at her Eastchase location. The store had been vandalized with the \n“N-word” as well as drawings of male genitalia. Local adolescents would go through the drive-\nthrough and say the “N-word” into the speaker because they knew the location was Black-\nowned. Williams provided no response or acknowledgment of these racist hate crimes Daniel \nwas forced to endure. \n279.  In or around 2016, McDonald’s built a new location (the “Love Travel Stop”) \napproximately fifteen minutes away from the Eastchase store. General Manager Darren Hall and \nQSCVP Sharlene Smith never offered Daniel the chance to bid or consider purchasing the \nlocation. Were it not for Daniel’s race, Hall and Smith would have considered her for this store \nthat impacted her Eastchase location. \n280.  In 2015 and 2016, Daniel worked to reset and improve her business as a \nMcDonald’s franchisee but was prevented from doing so because of McDonald’s further \ndiscrimination. Daniel reached out to now-Vice President and General Manager for the Raleigh \nRegion Debbie Stroud and the NBMOA in an attempt to change regions.  \n281.  Word of Daniel’s attempt to change regions traveled back to the Atlanta Regional \nOffice. Then-QSCVP Valerie Williams stepped in and interfered with Daniel’s requests, \nensuring that she would not be able to change regions or succeed as a franchisee. Williams sent \nbusiness consultants to grade Daniel’s restaurants at unannounced and unreasonable times, \nincluding late at night.  \n56 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 57 of 158 PageID #:1844\n282.  Daniel complained to Ombudsman Bill Lowery about Williams’s behavior and \nher belief that Williams was retaliating against her for seeking out other McDonald’s managers \nto attempt to switch regions. In doing so, Daniel was challenging McDonald’s practice of \nkeeping Black operators stuck in undesirable franchise locations. \n283.  In 2016, Daniel and her team attended a co-op training at a local restaurant owned \nby the Hays—white owner/operators. She noted that there was a large commercial fan at the \nfront of the drive-through at this location, which was a clear food safety violation for \nMcDonald’s and the City. However, the Hays had not been penalized for it. By contrast, Daniel \nwas poorly graded or forced to repair the most minute defect, such as having a tile with a small \nstain on it or a slot not working on a food storage cabinet. But for her race, Daniel would not \nhave been required to make such trivial repairs or risk receiving poor reviews for the most minor \nof defects. \n284.  In 2016, during a meeting with the NBMOA that Daniel attended, McDonald’s \npresented their plan for the future of franchisees. They informed the group that their overarching \nplan was to weed out small operators because only operators with five or more traditional \nlocations would be able to satisfy the plan’s terms. McDonald’s knew at the time that this plan \nwould force Black franchisees out of the system.  \n285.  In or around 2017, Daniel was forced to hire security for her Union Springs \nlocation—an added cost that her white counterparts did not have to pay—after the KKK \nthreatened to commit violence at the store because it was Black-owned. Again, Daniel notified \nWilliams about the hate crime and requested to transfer locations. Again, Williams did nothing \nand continued to set Daniel up to fail. \n57 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 58 of 158 PageID #:1845\n286.  In 2017, in retaliation for Daniel’s complaints, Williams informed Daniel at her \nannual business review that she was ineligible for growth or rewrite. \n287.  In 2017, Daniel attended another McDonald’s meeting in which they presented \nthe Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 plan. The meeting was a turning point for her, given McDonald’s \nstatement that it would be difficult to afford the new investments if you were a small operator. \n288.  In or around 2017, Daniel started exploring selling her stores. Williams sent her \nthe names of two local operators—Buddy Rogers and Gerry Murphy. Williams told her that if \nDaniel could sell her restaurants, she would find a deal for her in central Atlanta. The locations \nWilliams offered were located in the highest-crime areas of Atlanta, including one location \nowned by Plaintiff Floyd Sims that McDonald’s knew was going to close eventually.  \n289.  In or around 2017, Daniel traveled to North Carolina, at the border of Virginia, to \nexplore purchasing promising locations from an NBMOA operator in the Raleigh Region. \nWilliams killed any potential deal, informing Daniel that she could not look at other locations \nwithout Williams’ consent. It was common practice among Daniel’s white counterparts to look at \nor negotiate with operators in other regions to continue to grow, reorganize, or relocate their \nrestaurants. White owner/operators including Gerry Murphy and Ronald Hay had purchased \nfrom operators in other counties. However, Williams denied Daniel the opportunity to grow \noutside of her region solely because of her race. \n290.  In 2016 and 2017, Daniel faced a high-risk pregnancy and could not stand or walk \nfor long periods of time. Although McDonald’s was aware of her medical condition, the business \nconsultants continued to conduct inspections and graded visits early in the morning and late at \nnight without warning. McDonald’s was deploying their tactic of forcing Black operators out of \nthe system by increasing their inspections of Daniel’s stores. \n58 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 59 of 158 PageID #:1846\n291.  Following her Cesarean delivery, Daniel needed to take time off to recover. Even \nso, right after she gave birth, Operations Manager Robert Smith began calling her frequently to \nask when she would return to work. \n292.  Under Williams’s instructions, McDonald’s attempted to force Daniel on the \nBigger Bolder Vision 2020 schedule, despite the fact that she could not oversee such a large \nproject when she had not yet recovered and could not be physically present in the stores. \n293.  When Daniel returned to the store full time in 2018, Williams continued to \npressure her to execute the Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 plan. Daniel realized soon thereafter that \nshe could not financially meet the demands of Bigger Bolder Vision 2020, given the loss of sales \nat her Union Springs store due to the restructured marketing in the Montgomery/Dothan co-op.  \n294.  McDonald’s enforced the Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 plan more stringently on \nBlack owner/operators than on white owner/operators, as Daniel experienced. But for her race, \nshe would not have been pressured to strictly follow the Bigger Bolder Vision schedule during a \nperiod of medical recovery. \n295.  In or around 2018, Daniel emailed General Manager Greg Watson regarding a \nfood safety visit Business Consultant Robert Smith completed that Daniel believed was unfair. \nSmith did not give her supervisor time to correct the issues, as he did for white franchisees.  \n296.  In 2018, Daniel sold her stores for virtually nothing to Gerry Murphy—the only \nowner/operator McDonald’s presented to her as a potential buyer.  \nYves Dominique \n297.  Yves Dominique owned and operated six McDonald’s stores in the Atlanta region \nduring his time at McDonald’s. He is Black. \n298.  Prior to becoming a McDonald’s franchisee, Dominique had worked as an \nAssistant Manager under Plaintiff Keith Manning when he was 15 years old. Though Dominique \n59 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 60 of 158 PageID #:1847\nworked as a police officer in New York for 20 years, he kept in touch with Manning, who was by \nthen a franchisee.  \n299.  Dominique entered McDonald’s Advocate Program to facilitate his pathway to \nbecoming an owner/operator, though the Advocate Program provides no guarantees of approval. \n300.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, in approximately 2008, \nFranchise Manager Paul Carpenter approached Dominique about an opportunity to purchase a \nstore in Atlanta, located in one of the highest-crime and most challenging areas of the city. \nDominique believed that he would not have been chosen for that location were it not for being \nBlack. However, because he had few opportunities to purchase other franchise locations, \nDominique accepted the offer. \n301.  The Atlanta store was in poor condition. For example, the ceiling tiles were loose \nbecause of how badly the store was infested with rats. Even so, Dominique poured himself into \nthe store to remodel it and make it a success. Throughout his tenure at McDonald’s, Dominique \npassed every business review and was always recommended for growth. \n302.  As Dominique sought to expand, he began negotiations with a white \nowner/operator who was selling a store in Midtown Atlanta. Despite engaging in serious \nnegotiations for the store, the deal fell through after McDonald’s informed him McDonald’s \nwould not support the sale. McDonald’s did not provide a reason. McDonald’s provided the \nsame response when Dominique negotiated a deal to buy a store on Northside Drive, also owned \nby a white operator named John Tomasse. Again, McDonald’s informed Domonique that they \nwould not approve the deal. McDonald’s withheld its consent because it did not want to transfer \nwhite-owned, profitable stores to Black owner/operators. \n60 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 61 of 158 PageID #:1848\n303.  In 2012, Dominique purchased an additional four stores in the region. \nImmediately thereafter, McDonald’s raised the rent on the stores to 13.68% of gross sales, \nthough they did not raise the rent on any other operator in his region. \n304.  In 2014, McDonald’s demanded that Dominique undertake a remodel on one of \nhis stores, which compounded the debt he had from purchasing the new locations.  \n305.  Though Dominique’s stores were located in a low-income urban area, \nDominique’s hard work had made them profitable. Dominique wanted to sell his stores to a \nBlack owner/operator named Mark Mines, but McDonald’s did not approve and arbitrarily \nwithheld its consent in breach of the franchise agreement. Instead, McDonald’s directed him to \nJessica Dean, a white/owner operator, ensuring that these profitable locations would not go to a \nBlack franchisee. This interference in the sale further demonstrated McDonald’s racial \ndiscrimination, as it forced Dominique out of the system at a loss, in favor of its preferred white \nowner/operator. \n306.  McDonald’s then informed Dominique that he could not be a single-store \nowner/operator, despite the fact that McDonald’s permitted many white owner/operators to own \nonly one store, including a franchisee in Mount Zion named Ray Justice and another franchisee, \nKip Mecer. Instead, McDonald’s wanted to force Dominique out of the system solely because of \nhis race and used the one-store standard as a pretext to do so. As a result, Dominique was forced \nto sell his last store in 2017. \nWise Finley \n307.  Wise Finley first became a McDonald’s franchise owner/operator in downtown \nDetroit, Michigan in 1987. He is Black.  \n308.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s placed Finley \n61 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 62 of 158 PageID #:1849\ninto such a location for his first restaurant, which was located at Griswold and State Street in \ndowntown Detroit and had no drive-through. At the time Finley acquired this store, there was a \nsignificant homeless population that sought shelter in the restaurant.  \n309.  Despite the store’s challenges, Finley ran the store for two years, during which \ntime he managed to increase its sales by 30%.  \n310.  After his first year operating the restaurant, McDonald’s Field Consultant Errol \nSerbes instructed Finley to remodel the store’s lobby. Former McDonald’s Director of Field \nOperations Pat Isaac also communicated with Finley about the specifics of the renovation, \nincluding that McDonald’s would pay for the remodel upfront, and he could reimburse \nMcDonald’s when he exercised the BFL.   \n311.  In fact, Finley ended up paying more than $100,000 for the remodel.  \n312.  In 1989, Finley became the President of the Detroit Chapter of the Black \nMcDonald’s Operator’s Association and a board member of the NBMOA. That same year, \nFinley was ready to exercise his BFL, but when he tried to do so, McDonald’s informed him that \nit was going to sell the restaurant to another owner/operator. McDonald’s directed Finley to \nacquire other franchise locations in Michigan. McDonald’s denied Finley’s request to exercise \nhis BFL in retaliation for his involvement with the Detroit BOA and in an effort to push him out \nof the city. \n313.  Finley began operating three stores in Michigan: (1) Ypsilanti, (2) Maynard Street \nin Ann Arbor, and (3) South University in Ann Arbor. Neither Ann Arbor location had a drive-\nthrough. He operated these franchise stores from 1989 into 1994, making approximately \n$200,000 in annual profits.  \n62 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 63 of 158 PageID #:1850\n314.  Then, in 1994, Ted Lyons, McDonald’s Regional Manager at the time, offered \nFinley the opportunity to purchase a six-store package in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Specifically, \nLyons proposed that if Finley sold his three stores in Michigan and relocated to Chattanooga, \nFinley would start off operating two franchise stores, and then over the course of the following \ntwo years would acquire four additional stores.  \n315.  Finley, looking to expand his career as a McDonald’s franchisee, accepted \nLyons’s offer. One of the two Chattanooga stores he acquired immediately was located on \nShallowford Road and the other located on Fourth Street.  \n316.  In 1995, Finley was operating the two stores in Chattanooga when McDonald’s \nopened a new location about one mile from the Shallowford Store. This impacted Finley’s \nstore’s sales by 32%.  \n317.  In situations where a new store is built near an existing location, McDonald’s \nroutinely provides financial assistance—usually in the form of monetary compensation—to \nfranchisees for the negative impact that the new location is predicted to have on the franchisee’s \nsales. Despite this, McDonald’s never gave Finley the opportunity to bid for the new store \nlocation, nor did they offer financial assistance or impact funds to Finley. McDonald’s denied \nfinancial assistance—which it routinely gave to white operators who were impacted by a store \nopening—to Finley solely because he was Black. \n318.  Later that year, three white men entered the Shallowford Store and carved “KKK” \non two tables in the restaurant. These men also set fire to a waste basket in the bathroom.  \n319.  When Finley reported the racist vandalism to Lyons (via phone), Lyons responded \nto the effect of, “It is what it is.” Neither McDonald’s nor Lyons took this racist incident \nseriously nor offered any support or resources to Finley. \n63 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 64 of 158 PageID #:1851\n320.  After that incident, Finley met with Lyons and told him he wanted to return to \nDetroit. Lyons told Finley if he left Tennessee and those two stores, he could not continue as a \nMcDonald’s franchisee and would be exiled from the system. As a counteroffer, Lyons proposed \nbuying the franchise stores from Finley for $300,000 and in return, allowing Finley to leave the \nsystem.  \n321.  In 1996, Finley met with Noel Kaplan, Herbert Williams, and Ted Lyons about \nhis desire to return to Michigan and operate restaurants there. Kaplan and Williams offered to \npurchase the Chattanooga stores for $500,000, which would enable Finley to relocate anywhere.  \n322.  After that meeting, Lyons asked Finley to run the stores until McDonald’s could \nfind another buyer, which Finley agreed to do for approximately three to four months. Lyons was \nunable to find another franchise operator to take over the Chattanooga locations, so McDonald’s \nbought back the stores from Finley. Within one year of Finley leaving Chattanooga, both \nrestaurants closed and were no longer operational. \n323.  When Finley returned to Detroit area in 2000, he purchased a franchise store \nlocated on Ford Road in Dearborn, Michigan. At the time of purchase, the store’s sales were \napproximately $1.3 million. \n324.  Dearborn has one of the largest Muslim communities in Michigan. Because of the \ndemographics, McDonald’s asked Finley to be one of the two franchise stores to test Halal \nproducts, and Finley agreed.  \n325.  In 2001, Finley launched the Halal product line out of the Ford Road Store. By \n2012, Finley had nearly tripled the sales at this store, largely due to the Halal products.  \n326.  In 2003, Finley remodeled the Ford Road Store, which included adding a double \ndrive-through. The remodel cost him over $300,000. \n64 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 65 of 158 PageID #:1852\n327.  In 2007, Finley purchased another franchise store, the Grand River Store. \n328.  In 2013, Terry Reese, Regional Vice President at the time, called Finley and \nasked him what the Halal products were generating in sales. Finley informed Reese that the Halal \nproducts were generating at least a million dollars at his store. Without explanation, Reese told \nFinley that McDonald’s was considering pulling the Halal products from the store. Shortly after \nthat conversation, Reese resigned. \n329.  Subsequently, Poncho Gonzalez, who replaced Terry Reese as Regional Vice \nPresident, contacted Finley and told him that they were removing the Halal products from his \nstore. Finley met with Gonzalez about this decision and informed him that it would affect his \nsales by $1.1 million. Despite the success of the Halal products and the impact it would have on \nFinley’s sales, Gonzalez and McDonald’s moved forward with pulling Halal products from the \nFord Road Store’s menu. \n330.  As a result of this decision, Finley asked McDonald’s for a rent reduction for the \nFord Road Store, but Gonzalez only agreed to partially reduce Finley’s rent payment.   \n331.  Finley ended up selling the store to an Indian operator, and later learned that \nGonzalez had given the new operator the full amount of rent relief that Finley had previously \nrequested. This confirmed that McDonald’s would have granted Finley the rent relief requested \nwere it not for his race. \n332.  In 2016, Finley was forced to sell his stores because of loss of sales. McDonald’s \npaid him $1.9 million for both stores.  \nJacqueline and Anthony George \n333.  Jacqueline George and her husband, Anthony George, are former owners and \noperators of six McDonald’s franchise locations in Pennsylvania and Ohio. They are Black.  \n65 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 66 of 158 PageID #:1853\n334.  Jacqueline and Anthony George operated McDonald’s franchise stores for 21 \nyears. The Georges purchased their first McDonald’s franchise location in 1990 in North  \nHuntingdon, Pennsylvania, with the assistance of Marion Foran, a McDonald’s executive. Two \nyears later, the Georges purchased a second franchise location in East Liberty, Pennsylvania.  \n335.  In 1997, the Georges sold their two Pennsylvania franchise locations, and \npurchased three locations in Ohio as part of a package under the direction of former McDonald’s \nexecutive Jan Fields. In 2002, the Georges acquired the final franchise location they would \noperate, in The Plains, Ohio. The Georges’ Ohio franchise stores were located in rural, low-\nincome areas.  \n336.  In or around 2005, major road construction began near one of the Georges’ \nfranchise locations at East State Street. This road construction lasted approximately eight months \nand caused a substantial decline in the store’s sales; an estimated $500,000 loss in sales volume.   \n337.  As a result of the disruption to their restaurant, the Georges requested rent relief \nfrom then-General Manager Monica Boyles and Vice President of Quality, Service, and \nCleanliness Mason Smoot. Boyles and Smoot denied the Georges’ request without offering \nfurther explanation. McDonald’s denied the Georges financial assistance in the form of rent \nrelief, routinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because they were Black. \n338.  In 2012, the Georges were forced to sell their franchise locations to another \nfranchisee, Chris Celic.   \nWesley Hall \n339.  In 2005, Wesley Hall, owned and operated two stores in the Alabama region. He \nis Black. \n340.  In 2005, Hall applied to become a McDonald’s franchise operator through the \nonline registration process. Subsequently, McDonald’s called Hall and offered him two locations \n66 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 67 of 158 PageID #:1854\nto operate in Selma, Alabama. Hall then inquired about franchise stores in Florida, and \nMcDonald’s told him that he could either accept their offer and operate the stores in Alabama or \nbe passed over for any other franchise locations.   \n341.  To make the deal more appealing, McDonald’s told Hall that one of the Selma \nstores was projected to bring in $600,000 in yearly sales. Hall relied on that projection in \nagreeing to purchase the store. In reality, the store only brought in approximately $200,000 in \nannual sales.  \n342.  In September 2005, Hall accepted McDonald’s proposal regarding the two Selma \nstores and began operating the restaurants.  \n343.  Pursuant to his Franchise Agreement, Hall was to operate the restaurants from \n6:00 am to 12:00 am seven days a week. Additionally, McDonald’s required Hall to agree to \nrental payments of 15%. \n344.  In or around 2008, McDonald’s Business Consultant Willie Jackson forced Hall \nto start operating his stores 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This schedule change caused \nHall’s operational expenses, including labor, maintenance, utilities, and food, to significantly \nincrease.  \n345.  Hall quickly realized that operating 24 hours a day every day of the week was \nunsustainable, so he proposed that he stay open 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays and return to \nthe previous work schedule for the remaining weekdays. McDonald’s rejected Hall’s proposal.  \n346.  McDonald’s did not mandate that similarly situated white franchise operators \nkeep their stores open 24 hours a day. Were it not for Hall being Black, McDonald’s would not \nhave imposed the 24-hour requirement on him. \n67 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 68 of 158 PageID #:1855\n347.  McDonald’s denied Hall financial assistance in the form of rent relief, routinely \noffered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. On multiple occasions, Hall \nrequested that McDonald’s reduce his rental payments from 15% to 10% of gross sales. \nMcDonald’s rejected this request out of racial discrimination. \n348.  Both Selma stores were located in high crime areas. Hall was robbed and his staff \nwere assaulted on multiple occasions. Moreover, people would frequently steal food from Hall’s \nstores so regularly that he ended up installing padlocks on his store’s refrigerators.  \n349.  One Friday night, a woman wielding a machete assaulted a customer, and Hall \nhad to intervene to stop her from seriously injuring anyone. As a result, Hall’s insurance \npayments were higher than other franchise operators in the region. \n350.  Hall was ultimately forced to hire security officers for the safety and security of \nhis staff and stores. Additionally, Hall had to deal with high employee turnover because of the \noperating hours and frequent criminal activity in the area.   \n351.  McDonald’s knew, or should have known, that Hall’s stores were not financially \nviable as a result of the security and coinciding operational costs because they examined the \nstores’ financial records every thirty days.  \n352.  For white operators who faced similar situations in their stores as Hall, \nMcDonald’s routinely reduced their rent to 5% or 6%. McDonald’s denied that same relief to \nHall, despite its practice of granting it, solely because he was Black. \n353.  When Hall sought out franchise opportunities in Tampa, Florida, McDonald’s \nsummoned him to a meeting and chastised him for inquiring about these other stores.   \n354.  McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Hall’s stores. In or around 2007 to 2010, Hall was subjected to \n68 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 69 of 158 PageID #:1856\nincreasingly rigorous and frequent inspections at both of his Selma stores. These inspections \nwere more frequent and inconvenient than those imposed on white franchisees.   \n355.  With no financial support from McDonald’s, eventually, Hall was forced to leave \nthe McDonald’s franchise system in 2010.  \nAl and Kristen Harris \n356.  Al Harris and his daughter, Kristen Harris, owned and operated twelve \nMcDonald’s stores in the Tidewater and Richmond regions of Virginia during their tenure at \nMcDonald’s. They are Black. \n357.  Al worked for 37 years in the McDonald’s system—21 years as an owner and 16 \nprior to that as an employee. In that capacity, he held several leadership positions, including ten \nyears as President of the Virginia Black McDonald’s Owners Association (“BMOA”) and ten \nyears on the Regional Owners Executive Board. He was awarded the Regional Leadership \nAward four years in a row. \n358.  Kristen, who spent 15 years in the McDonald’s system and 11 years as an \napproved owner, also held a host of leadership positions. She served as the Virginia BMOA \nSecretary for two years, served as the Regional Women’s Operator Network Vice President for \none year, spent four years as a Regional People Team member, served for three years as the co-\nop People Team Lead, and served for two years on the Regional Next Generation leadership \nteam. Kristen was awarded the Virginia BMOA Leadership award twice and the Regional Street \nFighter award. \n359.  Prior to becoming a franchisee, Al worked for 16 years in McDonald’s corporate \noffice in a variety of roles, including in marketing, product development, operations, and as a \nminority ombudsman. \n69 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 70 of 158 PageID #:1857\n360.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s proposed this \ntype of store to Al and denied him the opportunity to purchase a store in an affluent white \nneighborhood solely because of his race. In 1997, Al approached Debra Koenig, the East Coast \nZone Division Manager, about becoming a franchisee and purchasing stores in Asheville, North \nCarolina. Koenig, a white woman, told Al, “You know they will never let you purchase those \nstores. You’re black.” \n361.  Al understood this to mean that McDonald’s would not let him purchase these \nstores because they were high-volume locations in an affluent white area—the type of area \nMcDonald’s would not place Black owner/operators. McDonald’s sold the Asheville store he \nhad requested to a white owner/operator, Don Raznik. \n362.  Koenig sent Al purchase options in the inner city of New Orleans, a dangerous \narea of Dallas, Texas, and finally, a low-income area of Virginia Beach. \n363.  The proposed Virginia Beach store was located in a high crime area of town. In \naddition to that store, McDonald’s proposed that Al buy a new store it had built on Birdneck \nRoad in Virginia Beach that had been open for six months and was underperforming.  \n364.  Al told then-Regional Manager Louie Mele that he did not want to purchase the \nBirdneck location because of its low sales, operational issues, and location in a high-crime area. \nMele responded that the two restaurants were a package deal and that it was both of them or \nnothing. \n365.  Several white operators were purchasing restaurants in the region around the same \ntime, and McDonald’s offered them opportunities to purchase much more attractive restaurants. \n70 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 71 of 158 PageID #:1858\nBut for being Black, McDonald’s would have also offered Al similarly desirable franchise \nopportunities from the outset. \n366.  In 2000, McDonald’s offered Al the opportunity to purchase five stores in the \nRichmond, Virginia area in exchange for selling three of his Virginia Beach restaurants. \nMcDonald’s Regional Manager Steve Plotkin instructed Al that he would need to sell them to \nspecific parties. Specifically, the First Colonial Road and Birdneck locations had to be sold to \nPaul Smith, a white owner/operator, and the Chimney Hill location needed to be sold to \nMcOpCo. These forced sales reduced the price Al received for the restaurants because he could \nnot negotiate offers with other potential buyers. By contrast, white owner/operators in the region, \nincluding Hugh Far and Leon Dickey, were allowed to pursue offers with buyers of their \nchoosing. But for his race, Al would have been allowed to seek out other buyers for these \nrestaurants and sell them for their full value. \n367.  One of the Richmond stores—“Crater Road”—was a low-volume store with \noperational issues, located in a dangerous part of town. Al communicated to Plotkin that he did \nnot want to purchase this location for these reasons. Plotkin ignored Al and stated that the five \nstores needed to be purchased as a package. Additionally, Crater Road’s current operator’s son, \nTom Bishop (a white owner/operator) was allowed to purchase better locations nearby, rather \nthan being forced to purchase Crater Road. Indeed, McDonald’s intentionally directed Al to the \nCrater Road location and forced him to buy it solely because of his race. \n368.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Al, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. After purchasing the stores, McDonald’s informed Al that he needed to remodel or \n71 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 72 of 158 PageID #:1859\nrelocate the Crater Road store to a location that would cost 4% more in rent. McDonald’s had not \nforced the last owner/operator of Crater Road, who was white, to remodel or relocate.  \n369.  The Harrises dealt with numerous security issues during their tenure at \nMcDonald’s. Five of their stores were robbed multiple times between 1998 and 2017. In \nFebruary 2005, an individual was killed in one of their store’s lobbies. They incurred extra \nsecurity costs because they offered policemen in uniform free meals to deter crime. They also \nfaced staffing issues as employees were too scared to come into work. \n370.  In January 2012, McDonald’s informed Al that they were building a new store 1.5 \nmiles from his South Hill location. When Al expressed his concerns about the impact the new \nstore would have on South Hill’s sales, McDonald’s reassured him that it would only reduce \nsales by 10%. They encouraged Kristen, who had completed the Next Generation training \nprogram in April 2009, to purchase the store.  \n371.   Area Real Estate Manager Bill Savage conducted a survey of the potential impact \nof the new store, which projected it to be double what McDonald’s had estimated. The Harrises \naccordingly requested impact relief but were granted only $25,000, roughly a fifth of what other \nwhite owner/operators had been granted in similar circumstances. \n372.  One such white owner/operator, Sue Derlack, told Al that when she had informed \nMcDonald’s that the impact of a new store was going to be much higher for her location than \nMcDonald’s had predicted, they had cut her a check for substantially more impact funding than \nwhat Al had received. That was not the case for the Harrises solely because of their race. \n373.  As a result, Kristen felt forced to purchase the store so that they could avoid \nanother owner/operator eating into Al’s sales. \n72 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 73 of 158 PageID #:1860\n374.  When Al’s South Hill store was being rebuilt and up for rewrite in 2018, the \nHarrises asked Field Operations Officer Barbara Calloway if Kristen could purchase the store at \nthat time. Calloway denied their request. \n375.  By contrast, the Harrises knew of several other white Next Generation operators \nhad been able to sell stores to their children, including Frank Harmon and Paul Smith. \n376.  At their operator review on April 24, 2015, Al and Kristen asked QSCVP Doug  \nJubic about expanding to Raleigh as it was the only area with opportunities for growth at the \ntime. Jubic told them that they could not grow into a different region, although several white \nowner/operations had been allowed to purchase stores in different co-ops and regions. \n377.  When Bigger Bolder Vision was launched in 2020, the guidelines for passing \ngraded company visits became more stringent. \n378.  The Harrises’ Business Consultant Julie Mariotti accidentally sent a text to \nKristen intended for someone else. Mariotti wrote of the Harrises: “They don’t care about \ncustomer. They only care about faking it to pass visits.” \n379.  McDonald’s discriminated against Kristen because of her race in their non-\nresponse to this situation, as demonstrated by their proactive response to a white operator. \nKristen wrote to Mariotti’s Regional Supervisor Helen Greco and told her she found the text \ndisrespectful and unfounded based on their 95% customer complaint recovery rate. She \nexpressed her concerns that Mariotti was not evaluating their stores from a fair and unbiased \nstandpoint. Kristen requested that they be assigned a new consultant, but Greco denied her \nrequest. \n380.  By contrast, another white operator, Dave Traub, had similar issues with Mariotti, \nrequested a new consultant, and McDonald’s assigned a different business consultant. This \n73 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 74 of 158 PageID #:1861\ndivergence demonstrates that McDonald’s employed two different standards for Black and white \nfranchisees, granting white franchisee’s requests and allowing them to succeed. \n381.  Prior to being forced out of the McDonald’s system in 2019, the Harrises were \noutperforming their co-op in sales, guest count, customer complaint responses, and customer \nrecovery. Despite their success, when they were one visit away from passing the number of visits \nto be deemed eligible for rewrite, McDonald’s failed them on a company graded visit (“CEV”), \nbased on a company guideline over which McDonald’s had complete discretion.   \n382.  Although only two of their four stores were up for rewrite, the Harrises could not \nfind an operator who willing to purchase the two stores alone without the other two stores \nincluded in the package. The Harrises were therefore forced to sell their two remaining stores as \nwell, which they had only finished renovating and reopening four months prior and had no desire \nto sell. \n383.  The Harrises were forced to sell their remaining stores in 2019. Al barely broke \neven on his investment after 40 years in the McDonald’s system. But for their race, the Harrises \nwould have passed their company graded visit and remained in the McDonald’s system.  \nLawrence Holland \n384.  Plaintiff Lawrence Holland is a former owner and operator of two McDonald’s \nfranchise locations in Jackson, Georgia. Holland is Black. \n385.  Holland’s brother owned and operated a McDonald’s franchise in Boulder, \nColorado. Holland initially worked at his brother’s franchise so that he could qualify to apply to \nbe a franchisee. In 2003, he purchased a standalone McDonald’s store in Jackson, Georgia \n(“Jackson”).  \n74 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 75 of 158 PageID #:1862\n386.  In 2005, Holland attempted to purchase a new hybrid McDonald’s store located at \na truck stop (“Truck Stop”) in the same area from Franchising Manager Bruce Freeman. \n387.  Originally, his application was denied due to his finances. However, an hour after \nhis application was denied, he was offered a two-year BFL to purchase the location. The BFL \nwould lock Holland into a seven-year obligation. Additionally, the BFL would increase the \nlocation’s rent by an additional 4% (18% overall) until Holland exercised his option on the loan. \nThese loans are difficult to repay unless the franchisee has a second or third store that is turning a \nprofit. Even though McDonald’s knew of Holland’s financial situation ahead of this purchase, \nHolland was allowed to move forward with the purchase using the BFL. \n388.  McDonald’s denied Holland financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. Holland asked \nMcDonald’s several times to lower the rent at the Truck Stop location because of its tight profit \nmargins. McDonald’s denied every request. By contrast, Holland knew of a white franchisee \nwhose rent was lowered from 12% to 9% because of tight profit margins.  \n389.  At one point during his time as a franchisee for the Truck Stop location, another \nlocation on the same freeway became available for purchase. Regional Manager Debbie Stroud \ndenied Holland’s request to purchase it. \n390.  At one of his business reviews, Holland saw that the Field Consultant had written \npositive comments. However, after the Field Consultant reviewed those comments with Stroud, \nthe Field Consultant changed the comments and gave Holland a negative review. \n391.  After Holland was given a bad business review at the Jackson location, Stroud \ntold him he could sell the store now or wait for McDonald’s to “take it.” It became clear that \nStroud wanted to force Holland out of the McDonald’s system. \n75 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 76 of 158 PageID #:1863\n392.  At his last annual business review for the Jackson location, McDonald’s corporate \ninformed him that he would not be granted a new 20-year lease for the location. McDonald’s \njustified this decision because Holland did not have two pieces of equipment needed for a new \nMcCafé. Holland had already installed this equipment at the Truck Stop location. He had already \nordered these pieces for the Jackson location and was waiting for the shipment to be delivered. \nHe showed the Operations Manager a receipt for the purchase. There was no reason to believe it \nwould not be installed shortly after arrival. Despite that, McDonald’s would not grant him the \nlease and used the equipment as a pretext to deny Holland’s rewrite. \n393.  Holland’s last annual business review was cancelled without his knowledge. He \nwas not contacted by phone or email about the cancellation. The review was then rescheduled to \nthe date after the required due date for the McCafé equipment installation. McDonald’s knew \nHolland would not have the equipment installed by that date. As a result, Holland failed the \nbusiness review, could not obtain a new lease, and was forced to sell the Jackson location in \n2011.  \n394.  If his review had been conducted as scheduled, there would not have been an \nissue with the equipment not being installed. He could have discussed the issue with corporate \nand expedited the installation.  \n395.  Holland ultimately sold the Truck Stop location. He had struggled to make a \nprofit at the location and McDonald’s had demanded that he remodel the lobby, although the \nstore was new when he purchased it.  \n396.  After Holland sold his franchises, several key pieces of information came to his \nattention. First, none of the three white franchise owner/operators near the Truck Stop location \nwanted to purchase the store due to its high rent. Other stores in the area had 9–12% rents, while \n76 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 77 of 158 PageID #:1864\nthe Truck Stop location had a 14% rent. As mentioned, Holland’s BFL increased his rent to 18% \nfor this location. \n397.  Second, Freeman informed him that the original sale was going to be a two-store \npackage for both the Jackson and Truck Stop locations. The Truck Stop location could not \nfinancially operate as a standalone store, and the Jackson location was known as a “problem” \nstore because it was an older facility with faulty equipment. This location was so problematic \nthat nearby McDonald’s franchise owner/operators wanted nothing to do with the store.  \n398.  Third, the previous white owner/operator of the Jackson location had experienced \nsimilar issues for years with no repercussions from McDonald’s corporate. The white owner was \nnot forced to make repairs, even when anticipating a sale to Holland. Unlike the white \nowner/operator and solely because of his race, Holland was pushed out of the system because \nMcDonald’s saddled him with a problem store. \n399.  But for his race, McDonald’s would have disclosed this information prior to his \npurchases, rather than putting Holland at a disadvantage and compromising his opportunity to be \na successful owner/operator. \nGlenna and Douglas Hollis \n400.  Plaintiffs Glenna Hollis and her husband, Douglas Hollis, are former \nowner/operators of six McDonald’s franchise locations in and around Orlando, Florida. The \nHollises are Black. \n401.  In 1988, Douglas Hollis began working at McDonald’s restaurants in New York’s \nWestchester and Rockland Counties as a registered applicant—a pathway to becoming a \nfranchisee for individuals without previous McDonald’s experience. Hollis has a bachelors and \nMaster of Business Administration in Finance. Prior to entering the registered applicant program, \nhe had 17 years of corporate experience at IBM and Xerox Corporations. At the same time, \n77 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 78 of 158 PageID #:1865\nGlenna Hollis began working at McDonald’s restaurants to learn the business alongside her \nhusband. \n402.  From 1988 to 1996, Douglas owned and operated a McDonald’s franchise at 1201 \nNorth Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (“Broad Street”). He purchased this location \nusing a BFL.  \n403.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s placed Douglas \ninto such a location for his first store. The Broad Street location was the only purchase offer \nDouglas received after successfully completing the registered applicant program. It was an \nunderperforming store with low sales in an area of North Philadelphia that had one of the highest \ncrime rates in the city. The store was constantly under siege by drug and gang activity. The \nBroad Street location had been unsuccessfully recycled three to four times before Douglas \npurchased the location. All prior owners were Black or persons of color who had filed for \nbankruptcy and exited McDonald’s system. The location had high operating costs, high \nemployee turnover, and additional 24/7-armed security costs for the location.  \n404.  At this time, white owner/operators were placed in affluent communities in and \naround Philadelphia, while Black owners and operators were placed in lower-income, higher-\ncrime areas. But for Douglas being Black, McDonald’s would not have directed him to this store. \n405.  Executives were not happy with Douglas’s decision to hire security, even though \nit was needed. McDonald’s also subjected the Broad Street store to incessant field consultant \ninspections. Those consultants consistently gave bad reviews because of location-specific issues, \nlike security, that were beyond Douglas’s control. \n78 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 79 of 158 PageID #:1866\n406.  McDonald’s misled Douglas in several ways prior to his purchase of this location. \nMcDonald’s misrepresented why prior owners and operators had failed at this location. \nMcDonald’s attributed their failures to incompetence and subpar operations, rather than the \ngeneral consensus that the location had more significant operational challenges than any other \nmetro Philadelphia location. \n407.  McDonald’s also promised Douglas that it would provide additional support if he \npurchased this location. Instead, Douglas was subjected to unannounced visits from corporate \nlate at night and on weekends, as well as undeservedly poor reviews. He felt he was held to \nhigher standards than white franchisees, despite operating in a more challenging environment. \n408.  Despite these issues, Douglas was able to increase sales from $900,000 to $1.1 \nmillion at the location and eventually exercised his BFL option to purchase the restaurant. Even \nwith his successes under difficult circumstances, he was never offered any expansion \nopportunities in the Philadelphia region. \n409.  Douglas sold this location back to McDonald’s in 1996 at a loss. Douglas decided \nto take the loss to leave the location and area, hoping for better opportunities. \n410.  From 1996 to 2001, Douglas owned and operated four franchise locations in and \naround Portland, Oregon. He relocated from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Portland, Oregon with \nthe sole assistance of a Black McDonald’s Senior Level Executive Vice President and Zone \nManager. \n411.  The Hollises attempted to purchase more corporate stores in this area, but their \napplications were denied. These stores were later sold to white owner/operators. But for their \nrace, McDonald’s would have provided them with the opportunity to buy company-owed stores. \n79 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 80 of 158 PageID #:1867\n412.  Ultimately, the Hollises sold these franchise locations and relocated to Orlando, \nFlorida. \nLaetitia Johnson \n413.  Plaintiff Laetitia Johnson formerly owned and operated four McDonald’s stores in \nthe Atlanta Region.  \n414.  In 1995, Johnson entered a BFL with McDonald’s to purchase her first franchise \nstore in Greenville, South Carolina (“Greenville”). \n415.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s placed Johnson \nin such a location with her Greenville store, which was located in an economically depressed \nneighborhood. The store did not reach the required production levels, so Johnson sold it to a \nMcDonald’s field consultant.  \n416.  Subsequently, Johnson acquired another BFL store in Spartanburg, South \nCarolina, which was also in a low-income and rural area. Johnson only owned and operated this \nstore for a short time.  \n417.  Between 2003 and 2006, Johnson acquired two more franchise locations—Kings \nTree and Lake City. Johnson purchased these locations from a white owner/operator. In or \naround 2015, Johnson acquired four additional franchise stores that McDonald’s was operating at \nthe time, one of which was located off the Jimmy Carter Highway (“Jimmy Carter”).  \n418.  The Jimmy Carter Store suffered severe financial setbacks when an infrastructure \nconstruction project began on the highway. \n419.  Additionally, Johnson faced security concerns at all of her stores, including an \narmed robbery at the Kings Tree location.  As a result, Johnson hired a security company to \nguard all four of her stores.  \n80 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 81 of 158 PageID #:1868\n420.  Johnson applied to refinance her loan with her bank, Wells Fargo. If secured, \nJohnson would have paid $36,000 less per month than she was currently paying. Wells Fargo \nwas prepared to grant Johnson’s request to refinance the loan. However, McDonald’s refused to \napprove the refinancing, without explanation.   \n421.  Johnson attended a co-op meeting where McDonald’s held a vote on the \nimplementation of the Dollar Menu. Several franchisees, including Johnson, voted against the \ndollar menu. \n422.  When Sharlene Smith, a McDonald’s General Manager, learned of her vote, she \nsaid to Johnson, “You’ll regret this.”  \n423.  When Johnson wanted to retire, her son sought to purchase these four stores.  \n424.  McDonald’s interfered with Johnson’s son’s purchase of these four stores by \nmaking false statements about the finances of these operations to her son and refusing to approve \nany deal involving her son.  \n425.  Specifically, QSCVP Valerie Williams and Sharlene Smith refused to allow \nJohnson to sell the four stores to her son and pressured her to sell to white operators. But for \nJohnson’s race, McDonald’s would not have interfered in the sale of her restaurants to her son. \n426.  Eventually, in 2018, Johnson was forced to sell her stores to a white buyer for half \nthe price she originally paid. This interference in the sale further demonstrated McDonald’s \nracial discrimination, as it forced Johnson out of the system at a loss, in favor of its preferred \nwhite owner/operator. \nHarold and Jeremy Lewis \n \n427.  Harold Lewis and his son, Jeremy Lewis, are former owners and operators of \ntwenty McDonald’s franchise locations in the San Diego and Las Vegas regions. They are Black. \n81 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 82 of 158 PageID #:1869\n428.  Harold Lewis purchased his first McDonald’s franchise location in San Diego, \nCalifornia in 1987.  He would eventually become recognized for his leadership by both \nMcDonald’s and his local community. McDonald’s recognized Harold with the distinguished \n“Ronald Award,” which honors operators for outstanding service to the community. Harold is \nalso a recipient of the McDonald’s “Outstanding Store Award.”  \n429.  When Harold Lewis purchased his first McDonald’s franchise location in 1987, \nMcDonald’s was blatantly forcing Black franchisees into predominantly Black communities. It \nwas at that time that Charles Griffis filed a race discrimination countersuit, asserting that Black \nindividuals were systematically kept from buying store in white neighborhoods.   \n430.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, when Harold sought to \npurchase his first store, the Regional Vice President informed him that he was being offered a \nrestaurant in a “rough area,” referring to a predominantly Black community in the southern part \nof San Diego. McDonald’s knew that these locations had low-volume sales and higher operating \ncosts, such as higher security costs due to crime.   \n431.  Harold became one of only two Black operators in the San Diego region.  \nBetween 1987 and 2015, McDonald’s would continue to direct Harold to predominantly Black \ncommunities that the company considered to be rough areas. McDonald’s placed Harold in six \nsuch stores in Las Vegas when he decided to relocate and sell his San Diego stores in or around \n2007.  \n432.  Harold sought to expand his business to more profitable locations but learned that \nMcDonald’s sought to deprive him of economic opportunities solely because of his race. For \nexample, he learned that McDonald’s was attempting to sell a profitable store that was \n82 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 83 of 158 PageID #:1870\napproximately six blocks from his store to a white owner/operator. McDonald’s had not provided \nHarold notice or a fair opportunity to purchase the store that would impact his store’s pricing and \ncustomer base.  \n433.  When Harold immediately complained to McDonald’s about the sale of the new \nstore, General Manager Cody Teets and QSCVP Bill Garrett informed him that McDonald’s had \nalready completed a Letter of Interest with the white operator, and intended to move forward \nwith the deal.  Harold then complained to McDonald’s corporate executives, including \nMcDonald’s President Jan Fields, that this would be another example of McDonald’s following \ndiscriminatory expansion policies when it pertained to Black operators. Eventually, McDonald’s \nstopped pursuing the deal. \n434.  As a result, Cody Teets and other McDonald’s staff retaliated against Harold. \nThey attempted to prevent Harold from receiving McDonald’s 365 Black Award and blocked \nHarold and Jeremy from growing their business. For example, Jeremy had purchased a \nMcDonald’s store in Las Vegas around 2013. He had worked in his father’s McDonald’s stores \nsince approximately 1996 to learn the business, including working closely with store managers, \nshift managers, and field service consultants to ensure they met their goals and targets to drive \nprofits. Jeremy completed the Next Generation Program and was approved as an owner/operator.  \nNevertheless, Cody Teets and other McDonald’s executives prevented Jeremy from expanding to \nadditional stores in retaliation for Harold’s complaint about race discrimination. Jeremy sought \nto purchase another location that would impact his current store, but McDonald’s sold it to a \nwhite operator instead. \n435.  Around 2014, Cody Teets and other McDonald’s executives also sought to \nprevent Harold from expanding his business after he completed his annual business review. \n83 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 84 of 158 PageID #:1871\nHarold sought to purchase two new stores in his area, but Teets alleged that Harold was not \neligible for expansion based on “financial reasons.” Harold later learned that there were no \njustifiable financial reasons for not expanding his business, and he was deemed expandable again \nsix months later. However, the damage had already been done. During this time, Harold lost out \non the opportunity to purchase the two stores.   \n436.  Teets and other McDonald’s staff also provided Harold with misleading financial \ninformation about the impact a competing store would have on his restaurant.  Harold learned \nthat Teets was attempting to sell two available restaurants near Harold’s stores: one store was \nbeing sold to a white operator from another region. Harold told Cody there would be significant \nimpact on his stores, but Teets assured Harold that the company projected less than a 7% loss of \nsales in his locations.  As a result of McDonald’s misleading financial information, Harold’s \nbusiness lost approximately 30% of sales and revenue.   \n437.  In 2015, Teets and other McDonald’s staff conspired to force Harold and Jeremy \nout of business.  As a result of the impact on his business from McDonald’s misleading financial \ninformation, Harold sought to sell his impacted stores and to purchase a profitable store.  \nMcDonald’s informed Harold that a deal was viable if Jeremy sold his store to Harold. The two \nfollowed McDonald’s guidance and Jeremy sold his store. \n438.  After Jeremy sold his store, Teets and other regional staff altered the terms of the \ndeal to prevent Harold from acquiring a loan to purchase the store. McDonald’s increased the \nstore’s price by approximately $300,000 at the eleventh hour of negotiations and never approved \nthe bank loan. \n439.  To remedy the situation, Harold attempted to sell Jeremy back one of the stores.  \nJeremy sought to purchase the store, but McDonald’s staff informed him that he could not apply. \n84 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 85 of 158 PageID #:1872\nMcDonald’s asserted that since Harold was leaving the business, Jeremy did not have enough \nexperience and could not be a solo owner/operator, even though Jeremy had been involved in the \nbusiness for nearly 20 years. White operators, including Tom Ault, were allowed to exit and sell \ntheir business to their children. McDonald’s failed to provide any legitimate business reasons for \nthe denial of Jeremy’s franchise opportunity, or why similarly situated white operators were \ntreated differently. \n440.  Ultimately, by 2015, Harold and Jeremy had owned and lost nine stores and \nJeremy had owned and lost one store.  But for Harold and Jeremy’s race, McDonald’s would not \nhave prevented the purchase and sale of stores, which destroyed a nearly 30-year process of \ncreating generational wealth and ownership for themselves and their family. \nJoseph Mbanefo \n441.  Joseph Mbanefo is a New York resident who owned and operated five stores in \nBrooklyn, New York. He is Black. \n442.  Mbanefo had an extensive career in budgeting and finance. After receiving a \nmaster’s degree in public finance, he had several leadership positions, including Budget Analyst \nfor the City of New York’s Department of Finance, Budget Director for the City of New York’s \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice, and Acting Assistant Commissioner of Finance for the \nDepartment of Juvenile Justice. \n443.  In 1996, Mbanefo asked to purchase a McDonald’s location in Long Island, where \nhe lived. McDonald’s refused without providing an explanation. \n444.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores, McDonald’s offered Mbanefo such a store in a high-\ncrime area of Brooklyn on Pitkin Avenue, as well as a satellite store four blocks away on \nBelmont Avenue. Regional Manager Paul Facella told Mbanefo that McDonald’s wanted to \n85 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 86 of 158 PageID #:1873\nplace him in this neighborhood. Mbanefo understood this to mean that McDonald’s was placing \nhim in this location because he was Black and would not have placed a white owner/operator \nthere. \n445.  Mbanefo faced serious security concerns at the Belmont Avenue and Pitkin \nAvenue locations, as well as another location he acquired on Rutland Road. Individuals would \nroutinely jump over the counter, attack his staff, take money from the cash registers, and flee. \nMbanefo initially hired security officers but they were unable to control the situation. As a result, \nhe hired private security officers with attack dogs to protect himself and his staff. He closed the \nstore at 5–6 PM every evening because customers were afraid to enter the store after dark. \n446.  Though Mbanefo showed the security videos from his stores to his assigned \nBusiness Consultant and told Facella that he did not want to die in his store, they did not \nrespond.  \n447.  For years, Mbanefo asked Facella and QSCVP Bill Lowery to close the Belmont \nAvenue and Rutland Avenue stores, given the security concerns, but McDonald’s refused to do \nso. Regional Manager Art Alamo and Lowery told him that if they closed the store, Mbanefo \nwould not receive another store in the New York region. \n448.  Lowery and McDonald’s continued to hinder Mbanefo’s growth prospects, telling \nhim he would never be able to grow his franchise in the New York region. Still, Mbanefo was \neager to expand, even if it meant purchasing stores in a different region. Lowery and Alamo \nproposed two locations in Philadelphia.  \n449.  Mbanefo visited the stores in Philadelphia and was horrified to find that they were \nlocated in a high-crime, unsafe neighborhood. He refused to take them on. A fellow franchisee \nnamed Al Chambers, a Black man Mbanefo had trained with, ended up purchasing the \n86 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 87 of 158 PageID #:1874\nPhiladelphia stores and was shot and killed at work. Chambers died in the hospital when \nMbanefo when to visit him, and Mbanefo was tasked with informing his wife and children of his \ndeath. McDonald’s refused to close the store, even for Chambers’ funeral, and the event haunts \nMbanefo to this day. \n450.  But for Mbanefo being Black, McDonald’s would never have directed him to this \nlocation, as further proven by whom they selected as the store’s buyer. \n451.  Soon thereafter, McDonald’s demanded that Mbanefo renovate his Pitkin Avenue \nlocation because it was old and in poor condition. The renovation cost $2 million. When he \nagreed to renovate, Mbanefo asked to renew his 20-year lease on the Pitkin Avenue store, which \nwas typically granted to franchisees who conducted significant remodels. Director of Operations \nMary Steidel refused without offering a reason. \n452.  Following the renovation, sales at the Pitkin Avenue store skyrocketed. With the \nincrease in revenue, Regional Manager Steve Kerley started pressuring Mbanefo to sell the store. \n453.  When he refused to sell, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black \noperators out of the system by increasing their inspections of Mbanefo’s stores. Kerley and \nBusiness Consultant Lori Prymak began harassing Mbanefo with unannounced inspections of the \nPitkin Avenue store, starting as early as 7 am. Kerley and Prymak would arrive at the store in \nwhite sneakers and would point at the marks on their shoes after inspecting his store. During one \ninspection, upon seeing a photo of The Beatles in the store lobby, Kerley asked Mbanefo how he \nended up working for McDonald’s if he did not know anything about The Beatles’ music, \nimplying that Mbanefo did not have the same knowledge or cultural experience as someone who \nwas white.  \n87 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 88 of 158 PageID #:1875\n454.  Mbanefo is not aware of any white owner/operators who were subject to the same \nkind of unannounced, early morning inspections. McDonald’s would not have subjected him to \nsuch demanding inspections or pressured him to sell a successful store if he were a white \nowner/operator. \n455.  Aware of Mbanefo’s continuing desire to expand, Director of Operators Mary \nSteidel, Field Service Manager John Stantonastasso, and Business Consultant Ken Pilar \napproached him about purchasing three stores from Rick Yandoli, a white owner/operator who \nhad filed for bankruptcy.  \n456.  Mbanefo, Yandoli, and McDonald’s negotiated a deal for Mbanefo to purchase \nthe three stores for $3.6 million around 2010. At that time, Mbanefo was not eligible for growth \nbut McDonald’s told him not to worry about it. Within a few weeks, they informed Mbanefo that \nthey would conduct another inspection and gave him a passing business review, which made him \neligible to grow and buy the Yandoli stores. The most profitable store was instead sold to Paul \nHandel, a white operator. Were it not for Mbanefo’s race, he would have been allowed to \npurchase the most profitable store as part of the package. \n457.  Three weeks before the deal was finalized, Senior Vice President and Chief \nRestaurant Officer Mason Smoot called Mbanefo to inform him that the most profitable of the \nthree stores was being pulled from the deal. Ultimately, Mbanefo purchased the other two stores \nfor $2.6 million. \n458.  Linda Brinkman, McDonald’s accountant, referred Mbanefo to John Sharkey, \nanother accountant affiliated with McDonald’s, who convinced him the stores were worth $2.6 \nmillion.  \n88 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 89 of 158 PageID #:1876\n459.  Brinkman coordinated the loan for the two stores with Lake Forest Bank. Sharkey \nprepared the paperwork and Sandy McCraren arranged the loan for which Mbanefo would pay \n$53,000 per month. They promised that Mbanefo would receive a 20-year loan on the stores as \nsoon as they received it from the landlord. \n460.  Around 2010, to check Sharkey’s calculations, Mbanefo hired a new accountant, \nJennifer Lepore, who analyzed the loan and found that he was overpaying by about $15,000-\n$20,000 per month for the Yandoli stores. When Lepore and Mbanefo approached Brinkmann, \nSmoot, Kerley, and Brinkman about this inconsistency, they refused to listen to him. Lake Forest \nBank ultimately admitted that it was attempting to charge him the wrong amount for the loan.  \n461.  In turn, Mbanefo requested that his overpayment be returned to him, and that they \nadjust his future payment schedule. McDonald’s refused to provide Mbanefo with adequate \nfinancial relief for their own failures. Instead, McDonald’s merely provided Mbanefo with an \nadditional loan to create more unnecessary debt for him. \n462.  Since McDonald’s refused to provide Mbanefo with adequate relief, McDonald’s \nsent Mbanefo a notice to take over his store immediately. As a result, Mbanefo was forced to file \nbankruptcy. \n463.  In 2012, McDonald’s subjected Mbanefo’s Conkland Avenue location to a \nsurprise audit without providing a reason. An auditor inspected his records for two days and \nfound nothing. He passed the audit with flying colors. \n464.  That same year, McDonald’s forced Mbanefo out of the system. He received an \noffer to purchase all four stores for $6.3 million and $5.1 million from Jacques Lawrence and \nBruce Corley, respectively. In breach of the Franchising Agreement, McDonald’s refused to \napprove the offers without providing a reason. \n89 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 90 of 158 PageID #:1877\n465.  Eventually, in December 2012, Mbanefo sold his four stores back to McDonald’s \nat a loss, for $2.3 million. But for Mbanefo’s race, McDonald’s would not have interfered with \nthe sale of his stores to particular sellers that resulted in a multi-million dollar loss. Additionally, \nafter ignoring Mbanefo’s years-long pleas to close the Rutland Road and Belmont Avenue stores, \nMcDonald’s shut the store down only after it had bought it back from him. \n466.  As a result of the stress he experienced during his time at McDonald’s, Mbanefo \nsuffered a series of health issues, including developing blood pressure, diabetes, and suffering a \nstroke. While he experienced these health conditions during his tenure at McDonald’s, Marty \nBalls insisted she wanted to visit Mbanefo while he was sick but Mbanefo refused and opted to \nmeet with her at a nearby Marriott hotel. Balls insisted Mbanefo bring all of his medications to \nmake sure he was not lying about his illnesses, which Mbanefo did. \nLois and Mitchell McGuire \n467.  Plaintiffs Lois and Mitchell McGuire are former owner/operators of four \nMcDonald’s franchise locations in Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey. Mitchell was a retired \nNewark police officer when he began his second career with McDonald’s. They are Black. \n468.  In 2000, McDonald’s offered the McGuires their first location in Newark, New \nJersey. In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing Black \nfranchisees into substandard stores, the restaurant was a low-volume store located in a high-\ncrime neighborhood and required 24/7 security, which the McGuires had to pay out-of-pocket. \nSecurity alone cost them $100 per day.  \n469.  The McGuires were hesitant about the location, but they felt it was their only \noption to get into the McDonald’s system. They ultimately decided to purchase the store. Had the \nMcGuires not been Black, McDonald’s would not have offered them this location. \n90 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 91 of 158 PageID #:1878\n470.  Despite the many obstacles the location presented, the McGuires were able to \nincrease sales. Even so, those sales did not offset the security costs. The McGuires asked their \nRegional Manager several times if McDonald’s could provide financial assistance or a rent \nreduction. The McDonald’s Regional Manager refused to provide the financial assistance, which \nMcDonald’s routinely provided to similarly situated white franchisees, solely because they were \nBlack. \n471.  After purchasing the first location, the McGuires asked McDonald’s about \nadditional franchise opportunities. Again, McDonald’s offered them another location in Newark \nthat required heavy security. But for their race, McDonald’s would have offered the McGuires \nother locations with greater revenue and lower costs. The McGuires purchased this location. \n472.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on the McGuires, \nas compared to white owner/operators, solely because of their race and in violation of the \nfranchising agreement. After operating this second location for about a year, McDonald’s told \nthe McGuires that the restaurant needed extensive remodeling. McDonald’s never informed the \nMcGuires during purchase negotiations that these remodels would be required to operate the \nstore. The McGuires could not afford those renovations. \n473.  Because the McGuires could not afford the renovations, they were forced to sell \ntheir two restaurants. McDonald’s would not allow them to participate in the sale of the \nrestaurant and instead presented the McGuires with its own pre-selected buyer. \n474.  In 2007, McDonald’s offered the McGuires two locations in Jersey City, Jersey. \nMcDonald’s did not disclose that these locations, like those in Newark, required extensive \nremodeling and heavy security paid for out-of-pocket. McDonald’s did not allow the McGuires \nto purchase restaurants on the open market. The McGuires could only purchase from or sell to \n91 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 92 of 158 PageID #:1879\npersons that McDonald’s presented to them. With no other options, they decided to purchase \nthese locations. \n475.  In 2007, the McGuires took full control of the Jersey City location on Mallory \nAvenue. After they took over, one of the location’s managers informed them that the former \nowner/operator had switched all the equipment with old or broken equipment from another \nlocation he had owned. The managers had informed McDonald’s. Both the managers and the \nMcGuires informed the company that all their equipment was old or needed to be replaced, but \nthe company did not address these issues. \n476.  After owning the Mallory Avenue location for a year, McDonald’s informed the \nMcGuires that they would need to completely remodel the restaurant. The McGuires could not \nafford the remodel. Like their Newark locations, they were forced to sell the Mallory Avenue \nlocation. \n477.  In 2007, the McGuires purchased a McDonald’s franchise located in a strip mall \non Grand Street. This location also required significant security paid for out-of-pocket. They \nentered this contract under the impression that McDonald’s would cover some of the security \ncosts. Their contract covered “cam charges” paid to McDonald’s, which were supposed to pay in \npart for a patrol car in their parking lot. These charges significantly influenced their decision to \nbuy this location. \n478.  McDonald’s never provided that patrol car despite the McGuires’ payments. They \nhad to once again pay out-of-pocket for 24/7 security after already paying their contractual “cam \ncharges.” In effect, they had to pay for security twice. \n92 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 93 of 158 PageID #:1880\n479.  On May 21, 2011, the Grand Street location burned down in a fire. Under the \nterms of their franchise contract, the McGuires could not find their own contractor to complete \nthe rebuild. Instead, they had to rely on McDonald’s to complete the rebuild. \n480.  For the year that the store was closed for the rebuild, the McGuires had to pay \nrent, service fees, and cam charges. McGuire wrote a letter to the company’s CFO, citing \nunfairness, but the company did not meaningfully respond. The McGuires had to continue \npaying these fees. \n481.  The McGuires’ insurance refused to continue to pay the McGuires’ rent and \nservice fees, as well as other expenses while the restaurant was closed, because they believed the \ncontractor McDonald’s hired was taking too long to complete the rebuild. McDonald’s excused \nthe delay by claiming that the construction manager was ill, and the McGuires had to wait for \nhim to recover before the reconstruction could continue. The McGuires asked for a replacement \nconstruction manager, but McDonald’s refused solely because of their race. This contrasted with \nother white owner/operators discussed, who McDonald’s offered financial assistance to due to \nmore minor operational challenges, like traffic issues or road closures. \n482.  As a result, the McGuires were forced to take out a home equity loan to make up \nfor the lack of insurance payments.  \n483.  The McGuires were forced to sell this location to cover their losses. Additionally, \nMcDonald’s took the balance of the owed rent and service fees from their closing settlement \nwhen they sold the restaurant.   \n484.  During their time as owner/operators, Mitchell served as the President of the \nBlack McDonald’s Operators of America. He had several meetings in his role with company \nexecutives seeking to advance racial equity in restaurant sales by addressing systemic problems \n93 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 94 of 158 PageID #:1881\nBlack operators faced. McDonald’s retaliated against the McGuires for this advocacy by offering \nthem restaurants with high operating costs. \nScott and Dwight Miller \n485.  Scott Miller and his father, Dwight Miller, are former owners and operators of \neight McDonald’s franchise locations in Champaign, Illinois. They are Black. \n486.  Dwight Miller purchased his first McDonald’s franchise location in St. Charles, \nMissouri in 1997. When McDonald’s implemented its parity program in 2000, Dwight sold the \nSt. Charles store and purchased seven McDonald’s stores in Champaign, Illinois. \n487.  In September 2011, McDonald’s approved Scott to become a franchisee through \nthe Next Generation program. Three months later, in December 2011, Scott purchased one of the \nstores from his father. \n488.   During their tenure as owner/operators in Champaign, the Millers were the only \nBlack McDonald’s franchisees in central and downstate Illinois. \n489.  Between 2008 to 2017, Dwight and Scott Miller were recognized for their \nleadership by both McDonald’s and their local community. Fellow McDonald’s franchisees \nelected Dwight to be Chair of the Regional Leadership Team, a position he served in for four \nyears, and Representative for the National Leadership Committee. In 2012, Parkland College \nawarded Dwight its Entrepreneur of the Year award. In 2014, Central Illinois Business Magazine \nrecognized Scott as its 40 Under 40 “Man of the Year.”  \n490.  In 2017, three years before five of their stores’ leases would expire, Scott and \nDwight began talks with then-Vice President of Operations Alvaro Bonta, their Field Service \nManager Cindy Armstrong, and their Regional Controller about rewriting the leases for their \nstores. Scott also asked about purchasing four of the stores from his father, which Bonta and \nArmstrong verbally approved. \n94 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 95 of 158 PageID #:1882\n491.  On February 21, 2018, the Millers met with the new Vice President of Operations \nChioke Elmore for what was supposed to be an introductory informational meeting.  \n492.  Instead, Elmore informed them that Scott could not purchase Dwight’s four stores \nand that they would not be rewriting their five stores when the leases expired in 2020. Elmore  \njustified this decision by telling the Millers that their stores’ sales were below the average of TV \nmarket sales, meaning the sales of other stores within the same media or television market. \nMillers had never heard of McDonald’s using TV market sales as a metric of a store’s \nperformance before. \n493.  Dwight attempted to explain that their sales were cyclical and could depend on \nhow well the University of Illinois football team was doing, given that their games drove more \nbusiness into the town. Additionally, the store was above the regional average in almost every \ncategory that McDonald’s considers during reviews. Elmore did not want to hear it. \n494.  On April 8, 2019, the Millers wrote a letter to McDonald’s Rewrite Committee, \nappealing Elmore’s decision not to rewrite the lease on their five stores. They cited the fact that \nin their experience, McDonald’s always gave a specific reason for deciding not to rewrite the \nstore that related to the restaurant, plus an opportunity to correct the problem. They concluded: \n“We are assuming that McDonald’s is holding everyone to the same standard.”  \n495.  On May 7, 2018, Elmore, Armstrong, and new Field Service Manager Brian \nTemple conducted a business review of the Millers’ stores and gave them a failing grade. This \nwas the first time the Millers had not passed a business review. \n496.  Elmore, Armstrong, and Temple looked for reasons to mark down the Millers on \nsections of the review. For example, they failed them on the “People” portion of the review for \nnot having Hamburger University-certified managers. When the Millers produced their \n95 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 96 of 158 PageID #:1883\nmanagers’ Hamburger University certifications, Elmore said that those certifications were not in \ntheir system, though that was not a requirement. Temple called the Millers afterwards and \napologized for how Elmore had spoken to them during the review. \n497.  As a result of failing their business review, the Millers were no longer eligible for \nexpansion and Scott was no longer eligible to purchase his father’s stores. \n498.  On May 15, 2018, Elmore called the Millers to inform them that the Rewrite \nCommittee had denied their rewrite appeal. \n499.  In spring 2018, the Millers decided to put their restaurants up for sale. Elmore \nprovided them with a list of three potential buyers, including Brad Davis. \n500.  The Millers searched for other potential buyers who were eligible for expansion in \ntheir region. They began working on a deal and drew up a contract with one such \nowner/operator, Blake Linders, to purchase their stores for $15.5 million. Linders, who is white, \ninformed McDonald’s that he was planning on buying the Millers’ stores. \n501.  However, in October 2018, Linders withdrew from the deal. McDonald’s told him \nhe was not able to purchase the stores because his sales were below the TV market sales in the \nregion. Management also made a comment about Linders’s children potentially not being \naccepted into the Next Generation program and his own stores not being rewritten if he \npurchased the Millers’ stores. \n502.  Facing the 2020 deadline to sell their stores, the Millers were boxed into a corner \nto sell them to Elmore’s pick, Brad Davis—a white owner/operator—for $12.25 million. Thirty-\nthree months after the Millers sold their stores to Davis, Davis sold them to Blake Linders for \n$24 million. \n96 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 97 of 158 PageID #:1884\n503.  McDonald’s denied the Millers’ rewrite request because they were below TV \nmarket sales, but allowed Linders, a white owner/operator whose sales were also below the TV \nmarket, to purchase more stores. Store sales below the TV market were never a reason to deny \nrewrite. But for the Millers’ race, McDonald’s would not have denied their rewrite request nor \nScott’s purchase of his father’s store on the pretextual basis of the TV market metric. If \nMcDonald’s had not discriminated against them, the Millers would have continued to operate \nsuccessful businesses. \n504.  McDonald’s denied the Millers’ deal with Linders but later allowed a white \nowner/operator, Davis, to sell the same stores to Linders for twice their purchase price. This \ninterference in the sale further demonstrated McDonald’s racial discrimination, as it forced the \nMillers out of the system at a loss, in favor of its preferred white owner/operator. But for the \nMillers’ race, McDonald’s would not have interfered with their sale to Linders and caused them \nto lose $11.75 million on the sale. \nDawn Mussenden \n505.  Dawn Mussenden owned and operated five McDonald’s stores in the New York \nand Atlanta regions. She is Black. \n506.  Before working at McDonald’s, Mussenden had a well-paying job in financial \nmanagement and was the leader of her finance group. Given her husband’s entrepreneurial \nambitions, she decided to change her career path and trained with her husband at Hamburger \nUniversity to become a franchisee. \n507.  As Mussenden and her husband prepared to buy their first restaurant in the New \nYork region, her husband told the Regional Manager that he was not interested in buying a store \nin the outer boroughs of New York City, given his concern for their safety.  \n97 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 98 of 158 PageID #:1885\n508.  The Regional Manager eventually offered them a restaurant that would be built on \nCentral Islip on Long Island. Mussenden and her husband would be the first Black owners on \nLong Island, a fact they took pride in. However, in keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory \npractice of intentionally placing Black franchisees into substandard stores, the Central Islip store \nwas a low-volume and unprofitable location. \n509.  However, Mussenden became concerned when she attended a Long Island \noperator’s meeting and learned that all the white operators had turned the restaurant down. They \nwarned her that it was a bad deal, even though the Regional Manager told Mussenden that the \nrestaurant’s sales would reach $2 million. As the white operators had forewarned, sales never \ncame close to that figure. Solely because they were Black, the Regional Manager pigeonholed \nMussenden and her husband into a store that no white operator wanted to take on. \n510.  The restaurant was located in a high-crime area of Central Islip, and several \nrobberies occurred at the store, as well as regular drug use. Mussenden and her husband needed \nto hire security to ensure the store’s safety, but could not afford to pay security guards every \nnight. Mussenden asked McDonald’s for financial assistance to help cover security costs, but \nMcDonald’s refused. Tragically, one night when security was not at the store, one of her favorite \nemployees was killed in a robbery. \n511.  Other white operators told Mussenden that McDonald’s had paid for their stores’ \nsecurity when asked. But for Mussenden being Black, McDonald’s would have helped offset her \nsecurity costs. \n512.  McDonald’s later offered Mussenden and her husband a store in a mall on Long \nIsland. Mussenden faced issues with this location as well because the mall charged rent based on \nthe store’s square footage, not based on gross sales, as was McDonald’s typical practice.  \n98 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 99 of 158 PageID #:1886\n513.  She and her husband asked McDonald’s to negotiate with the mall, but they never \ndid. Because of the high costs, they were eventually forced to sell the restaurant for virtually \nnothing to another operator. That operator, in turn, faced so many challenges with the restaurant \nthat he left shortly thereafter. \n514.  McDonald’s made promises to the couple about providing other opportunities for \nexpansion to them, but never followed through. For example, the Regional Manager told them he \nplanned to offer them a restaurant on Sunrise Highway—an opportunity the couple was excited \nabout. However, McDonald’s ended up selling that restaurant to a white operator.  \n515.  A few years later, McDonald’s offered the couple a three-restaurant deal. One \nstore was located in a dangerous neighborhood. The couple begged McDonald’s to exclude that \nstore from the deal. \n516.  The restaurants McDonald’s offered to the couple followed the same pattern: low \nvolume, high rent, and high operation costs. When better opportunities came along, Mussenden \nand her husband saw them go to white operators. McDonald’s pegged the couple for undesirable \nfranchise opportunities and denied them more appealing ones solely because of their race. \n517.  When Dawn and her husband got divorced, they divided their three remaining \nrestaurants. Mussenden took one restaurant (“Roosevelt”), which she worked tirelessly to \nimprove. She brought sales up to $2.7 million and won awards as a result, including a corporate \ntrip to the Bahamas.  \n518.  Despite her success at Roosevelt, when she inquired about buying more \nrestaurants, specifically McOpCo restaurants in her area, McDonald’s told her none were for \nsale. However, a white operator, who already owned 12 to 13 other restaurants, was able to \npurchase one of the McOpCo stores for his son in the NextGen program. Had Mussenden been \n99 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 100 of 158 PageID #:1887\nwhite, McDonald’s would have offered her expansion opportunities in her area, given her \ndemonstrated record of success. \n519.  Given McDonald’s refusal to provide her with expansion opportunities, \nMussenden decided to seek them out for herself. Mussenden heard about an operator in Brooklyn \nwho was going into bankruptcy and selling his store, and she asked the Regional Manager \nwhether she could purchase it. The regional manager hemmed and hawed, saying he would look \ninto it, and that the decision was ultimately that of McDonald’s corporate headquarters. \nMussenden was never offered the store.  \n520.  This followed a pattern Mussenden had observed and personally experienced: \nMcDonald’s franchisees received the best restaurants if they were white and the worst \nrestaurants if they were Black. \n521.  Eventually, Mussenden purchased two other stores from a friend who was retiring \nin Atlanta. On paper the stores looked promising, but Mussenden did not know when she \npurchased them that a new development was being built near the stores that would include \nseveral competitors’ restaurants.  \n522.  Mussenden approached the Regional Manager to ask for assistance due to the \nunexpected competition in the area. After several meetings, McDonald’s would only agree to a \nvery small amount of assistance, which was not nearly sufficient to make up for the loss of sales \ndue to the development.  \n523.  McDonald’s regularly provided much greater assistance to white owners-\noperators. Mussenden was personally informed by white owner-operators that they paid only 4% \nrent and received substantial assistance from McDonald’s. Mussenden would have received such \nfinancial assistance and support but for being Black. \n100 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 101 of 158 PageID #:1888\n524.  Eventually, the QSCVP Valerie Williams came to her store and told her that with \n“all the things coming down the pike” with the Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 plan, she did not \nbelieve Mussenden was in a financial position to keep the store and should sell it. Williams’ \ncomment aligned with McDonald’s corporate executives’ awareness that Bigger Bolder Vision \n2020 would decimate Black franchisees’ operations and their decision to force Black \nowner/operators to comply with the modernization program anyway. \n525.  After that meeting, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out \nof the system by increasing their inspections of Mussenden’s stores. Mussenden was subject to \nconstant, unannounced store inspections. The business consultants conducting the visits were \ncondescending towards her and her employees. \n526.  During the worst visit, a business consultant opened a meat cabinet, screamed that \nthe meat was expired, and slammed the contents of a meat container on a prep counter, causing \nthe meat to fly everywhere. Mussenden’s employees were traumatized, and Mussenden cried in \nher car after the inspection. \n527.  Ultimately, Mussenden decided to sell her stores. When Mussenden was in the \nprocess of selling them, she spoke to a white operator and mentioned that her rent was 12%. The \nwhite operator told her he had never paid rent that high. McDonald’s charged Mussenden an \nobjectively higher amount of rent solely because she was Black. \nWilliam Rasul \n \n528.  William Rasul owned and operated three McDonald’s stores in the Atlanta region. \nHe is Black. \n101 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 102 of 158 PageID #:1889\n529.  He would eventually become recognized for his leadership by both McDonald’s \nand their local community.  Rasul served on the board of directors for the Old National \nMerchants Association, and was named businessman of the year in the City of College Park. \n530.  Rasul began working at McDonald’s in 1979 as a maintenance man.  Eventually, \nhe became an Operations Manager, overseeing approximately 25 restaurants.  \n531.  After working for McDonald’s for 20 years, Rasul purchased his first store as a \nfranchisee in 1999.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, between 1999 and 2010, \nMcDonald’s placed Rasul into such stores, with low-volume sales and higher operating costs due \nto crime, higher insurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely because of his race.  For \nexample, Rasul regularly had to purchase bulletproof windows. Insurance companies required \nhim to replace his security guards with certified law enforcement officers. McDonald’s never \nprovided an opportunity or considered Rasul for a store in a neighborhood that was not \npredominantly Black.   \n532.  McDonald’s denied Rasul financial assistance in the form of rent relief, routinely \noffered to white owner/operators in the region like Doug Taper and Stanford Delky, solely \nbecause he was Black. For instance, McDonald’s relegated Rasul to another store in a \nsubstandard location, specifically a store in Riverdale that was non-compliant with the American \nDisabilities Act and required a complete remodeling.  McDonald’s then required Rasul to \nremodel the store within a short timeframe not required of white franchisees. Rasul asked Vice \nPresident of Operations for the Atlanta Region Debbie Stroud and David Neese for financial \nassistance, including a loan to repair and remodel the store, but they denied his request. \n102 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 103 of 158 PageID #:1890\n533.  McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Rasul’s stores to generate bad business reviews. In turn, they \nrelied on the poor business reviews as a pretext to force him out of the McDonald’s system. \nInspectors would regularly arrive unannounced with a goal of documenting the smallest \ninfraction. Stroud would deputize regional staff and inspectors to conduct these visits. At one \npoint, Stroud went so far as to accuse Rasul of using drugs. But for Rasul’s race, he would never \nhave been subjected to these unreasonable inspections and accusations.   \n534.  As a result of McDonald’s continuing misconduct alleged herein, Rasul was \nforced to sell his stores in 2010 and file for bankruptcy.    \nDwayne Richard Johnson \n535.  Dwayne Richard Johnson is a former owner/operator of two McDonald’s \nfranchise locations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is Black. \n536.  Johnson began learning about operating McDonald’s franchises at age 17 though \nworking at his uncle’s, Bob Wright, restaurants in Philadelphia. Johnson started off completing \nvarious maintenance jobs. As the years progressed, his uncle gave him more responsibilities. \nJohnson developed a passion for McDonald’s and dreamt of becoming a franchise owner. \n537.  After college, he moved to Boston to work full-time with Dow Chemical. In 1985, \nhe left to follow his dream of becoming an operator. Johnson began running operations as a \nmanager and supervisor at his uncle’s restaurants.  \n538.  Johnson first witnessed McDonald’s discrimination again Black operators when \nsales at one of his uncle’s restaurants began to dip. In response, McDonald’s began to subject the \nrestaurant to incessant inspections. Johnson and his uncle told the company that the sales dip was \ndue to a fence that had been built in the area, which impeded access to the restaurant. However, \nMcDonald’s honed in on operations, old equipment, and his uncle’s inability to upgrade the \n103 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 104 of 158 PageID #:1891\nequipment, and built a case against his uncle as an operator. His uncle was forced to sell the \nrestaurant. \n539.  Johnson was a well-regarded manager who had won management awards. As a \nresult, the company offered him jobs as a manager for other restaurants. He made it known to the \ncompany that his goal was to become an operator. \n540.  In 1991, he received a call that a Black operator was selling his restaurant in \nNorth Philadelphia. Since Johnson did not have the capital to buy it on his own, McDonald’s \noffered to place him on a fast-track program where he would function as an owner but receive a \nsalary from the company. In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally \nplacing Black franchisees into substandard stores, McDonald’s placed Johnson into such a store \nin North Philadelphia. \n541.  During the sales process, Johnson noticed that the Black operator of the \nPhiladelphia restaurant seemed to have been pushed out and forced to sell in a similar way to his \nuncle. He also knew the store was in a difficult neighborhood and would be challenging to \nmaintain. Even so, he was thrilled to become an operator and was unsure if he’d receive another \nopportunity. \n542.  By 1993, Johnson took over the restaurant as a traditional owner. Though it was a \nchallenging store, he ran it well and increased sales.  \n543.  In 2000, McDonald’s offered him the opportunity to buy a second restaurant. This \nWest Philadelphia restaurant was similar to his first—a two-story restaurant in a rough \nneighborhood. The restaurant was in poor condition and needed a lot of work. Johnson had not \nbeen offered a second store in his seven years as an operator, so he accepted the restaurant \n104 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 105 of 158 PageID #:1892\ndespite its challenges. However, McDonald’s would not have offered Johnson this location were \nit not for his race. \n544.  Around 2005, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of \nthe system by increasing their inspections of Johnson’s stores. Johnson started to receive more \nfrequent inspections in both locations. The business consultants told him that each location \nneeded repairs and remodels. Johnson ended up spending $300,000 to remodel his first \nrestaurant.  \n545.  Since Johnson did not have the funds to remodel the second location, McDonald’s \narranged a buyer for Johnson to sell the restaurant to. Regional Manager Harry Coaxum told \nJohnson that he would get a better restaurant in exchange for selling. That never happened. \n546.  Johnson started preparing to seek approval for rewrite on the first location. He \nmet with an accountant to make sure the restaurant’s numbers were where they needed to be. \nJohnson met with his accountant, the Regional Manager and Cedri Jones, the Regional Vice \nPresident. During that meeting, Jones verbally promised to rewrite his restaurant. \n547.  When the time came to actually renew the lease, Johnson was denied rewrite. \nJones denied ever promising the rewrite to him. McDonald’s told Johnson they were denying \nhim the rewrite based on not meeting the financial ratios required and certain operational issues. \nHowever, to make this argument, they needed to pull Johnson’s financial ratios from 8 years \nback. In terms of operations, Johnson had done the remodels and reinvestments required of him. \nMcDonald’s reasons for denying the rewrite were pretextual, as it sought to push out a Black \nowner/operator who had turned around difficult stores, solely because of his race. \n548.  Having worked for the company since he was 17 years old and given everything \nto it, Johnson was devastated for his career at McDonald’s to end in this way. \n105 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 106 of 158 PageID #:1893\nJeffery Rogers \n549.  Jeffery Rogers owned and operated McDonald’s stores in the Jacksonville region \nof Florida. He is Black. \n550.  In August 2005, after completing his franchisee training, Rogers purchased a \nstand-alone McDonald’s store and a McDonald’s store within a Walmart as part of a package \ndeal in Jacksonville, Florida. In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of \nintentionally placing Black franchisees into substandard stores, McDonald’s placed Rogers into \nsuch a store, located in a high-crime area in Jacksonville. \n551.  Rogers’ purchase of the stores was brokered by Jim McCabe, the QSCVP for the \nregion in May 2005, who had personally pitched the sale as “the perfect two store deal” to \nRogers and his wife. The stores were located on the north side of Jacksonville, a predominantly \nBlack, low-income, and high-crime area. \n552.  McCabe told him that the restaurant would be an excellent fit for him and his wife \nbased on the area’s demographics. McCabe said that the neighborhood would benefit greatly \nfrom having two professional Black role models running the store with the promise of growth, \nbecause the north side was expanding. \n553.  Rogers understood this to mean that he and his wife fit the profile for dealing with \na “difficult” demographic and area because they were Black. Indeed, but for their race, \nMcDonald’s would not have directed them to that restaurant. \n554.  McCabe underscored that point by informing Rogers that regional leadership—\nGeneral Manager Charlie Roberson, Director of Field Services Walt Maney, and Franchising \nDirector Marion Foran—wanted to keep a Black operator in these stores. \n555.  McCabe passed along Ken Meeks’ phone number, then the current \nowner/operator, and instructed Rogers to talk to him about his interest in buying the stores. \n106 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 107 of 158 PageID #:1894\nMeeks told Rogers that regional leadership had instructed him only to speak to Rogers and no \nother prospective buyers. \n556.  During his first walk-through of the restaurant, Rogers became concerned about \nmaintenance issues including the ISP register system, the grills, and the HVAC. During closing, \nRogers complained about those issues and was reassured by Field Service Manager Marcia \nKeeney and Field Service Consultant Scott Mason that they were acceptable and met \nMcDonald’s standards. Rogers relied on those statements in his decision to purchase the \nrestaurant. \n557.  In reality, they were all expensive reinvestment issues. Six months later, Mason \ninformed Rogers that he needed to replace these items to pass his annual business review. \n558.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Rogers, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. When Rogers questioned why he needed to replace them as he had recently been told \nthey were acceptable, Mason simply stated that they needed to close the deal with Meeks before \nthe end of the month and it was now Rogers’ responsibility to replace these items. In total, those \nrenovations cost Rogers $100,000. \n559.  Additionally, following the sale, a former employee informed Rogers that the \nrestaurant had been temporarily closed for five days in March 2005, due to a major rat and roach \ninfestation problem, as well as other food safety concerns. McCabe had not disclosed this \ninformation during the sale. \n560.  Despite the obstacles, Rogers passed his business reviews and became eligible for \ngrowth. But the franchising team continued to present him only stores located in high-crime, \nlow-income, Black communities around the country. Between 2004 – 2005, McDonald’s \n107 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 108 of 158 PageID #:1895\napproached Rogers about purchasing stores in “inner-city” areas of Atlanta, West Philadelphia, \nColumbia, SC, Selma, AL, Charlotte, NC, and Baltimore, MD. \n561.  None of the white registered applicants Rogers knew from franchisee training \nwere offered stores in the African American Consumer Market. Neither would Rogers have been \noffered such stores but for his race. \n562.  During his business review in 2007 or 2008, Finance Director Allison Peck stated \nthat maybe Rogers was not cut out to be a businessman and should reconsider going back into \nlaw enforcement. \n563.  Rogers was caught off guard and insulted by her comment, which he believed to \nbe racially motivated. He asked his white counterparts at the co-op meeting if they had received \nsimilar comments and they said they had not. \n564.  After Rogers spoke to Field Service Manager Marcia Keeney about the lack of \nassistance he had received from Roberson and McCabe, Roberson deployed McDonald’s tactic \nof forcing Black operators out of the system by increasing inspections of Rogers’ stores. The \ncorporation created an environment where, despite Rogers’ best efforts, they would not allow \nhim to achieve success.  \n565.  Rogers spoke to his white counterparts at co-op meetings, including Dave \nMullins, Tom LeSanti, Joe King, and Awilda Duffy, who said they were not receiving such \nfrequent inspections. McDonald’s had pegged him as an owner/operator they wanted to force out \nof the system. \n566.  As a result of the stress of operations, Rogers suffered three heart attacks between \n2007 and 2010. The unannounced inspections continued unabated even while he was in the \nhospital. \n108 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 109 of 158 PageID #:1896\n567.  When Rogers complained to Field Service Consultant Julie Woodruff about the \nrelentless inspections, she began crying and told him, “It’s not me, I’m only following orders and \nthis is above my pay grade,” effectively conceding that McDonald’s had placed a target on \nRogers’ back. \n568.  In 2007 or 2008, McCabe requested that Rogers and his wife meet with him and \nRegional Director of Field Service Bonnie Wiess at the Worldwide Convention in Orlando. \nMcCabe offered Rogers and his wife two stores in another high-crime area in Jacksonville and \nagain insisted that the neighborhood would benefit from the presence of two upstanding Black \nrole models.  \n569.  When Rogers refused to take on the stores, Roberson called him and threatened to \nend his career. \n570.   In winter 2009, Rogers requested a loan from Chase to complete required \nreinvestments for his store. \n571.  In December 2009, Chase banker Dajuana Cohen emailed Rogers and let him \nknow that she was waiting on an exception from the regional McDonald’s office to approve the \nloan. Cohen asked him who he had “piss[ed] off” at the regional office and told him that she had \nbeen instructed by Finance Director Allison Peck and Roberson to deny his loan application, \nalthough his financials were in good shape. \n572.  Rogers consulted with his white counterparts at a co-op meeting, including \nAwilda Duffy, Kathy Schurman, Dave Mullins, Tom Lisante, Mark Boozer, Jim Van Laere, and \nJoe King, to see if they had ever experienced or heard of anything like the McDonald’s regional \noffice withholding a loan approval. They had not. Indeed, Peck and Roberson were retaliating \nagainst Rogers for refusing to purchase stores in a high-crime, predominantly Black area. \n109 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 110 of 158 PageID #:1897\n573.  On February 25, 2010, Linda Rogers, in McDonald’s finance department, emailed \nRogers and stated that his financials were acceptable and that he had exceeded the company’s \nminimum target for cash flow. \n574.  But a week later, on March 6, 2010, Jay Mages informed Rogers that would be \nconducting an internal audit of the store, without further explanation. Rogers understood the \naudit to be further retaliation on McDonald’s part. \n575.  On December 3, 2010, Field Service Director Harry Thomas threatened to place \nRogers on a performance improvement plan during his business review. Immediately following \nthe review, Rogers went into cardiac arrest and was shuttled into surgery. \n576.  While he was in recovery and his wife took over running the store, Field Service \nManager Carolyn Shivers and Field Service Consultant Julie Woodruff continued conducting \nexcessive, unannounced grading visits. \n577.  On December 23, 2010, Shivers and Woodruff conducted an unannounced \ngrading visit while Rogers was still on leave. Rogers asked why they were conducting a visit on \na busy holiday weekend while he was home recovering from a heart attack. He attempted to call \ntheir supervisor, Director of Field Services Harry Thomas, but he would not pick up the phone. \n578.  Ultimately, Rogers’ doctor urged him to sell the store due to the stress it was \nputting on his health and his risk of a fatal heart attack. Despite receiving multiple offers for his \nstore, in 2011, Charlie Roberson blocked those offers, thereby breaching the Franchise \nAgreement’s stipulation that McDonald’s could not arbitrarily withhold consent to a sale. \nInstead, Roberson sent Rogers a buyer he would approve.  \n579.  In a final retaliatory act in February 2011, at Roberson’s direction, Franchising \nManager Carl Patula sent Rogers an NRBES M&R repair list, and required inflated \n110 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 111 of 158 PageID #:1898\nreinvestments in order to reduce sales profits. McDonald’s used this well-known pattern and \npractice against operators forced out of the system. \n580.  Rogers sold the store on May 1, 2011, after which the excessive field service \nvisits stopped immediately. \nCarrie Salone \n581.  Carrie Salone owned and operated two McDonald’s stores in Atlanta, Georgia. \nShe is Black. \n582.  Prior to entering the McDonald’s system as an owner/operator, Salone was a \nPublic Health Director at the Center for Disease Control for 25 years. She received her Master’s \nDegree in public health from Morehouse School of Medicine. \n583.  As a McDonald’s owner/operator, Salone was a pillar of her community and was \nfrequently recognized for her leadership. She served on the Ronald McDonald House Board, \nserved as the Vice Chair of the Atlanta Region Supply Chain, and as the McDonald National \nGospel Chair. During her tenure, her restaurant won “Crew Person of the Year” award. \n584.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, McDonald’s directed Salone \nto such stores to purchase. In 2003, Salone worked with Franchising Manager Darryl Clarke to \npurchase her first store as a franchisee. Clarke proposed the Buckhead location in Atlanta—the \nonly option presented to her.  \n585.  In 2006, Salone purchased another store from Lou Matti, a white owner/operator, \nin Decatur, Georgia, at the recommendation of Vice President of Operations for the Atlanta \nRegion Debbie Stroud. Salone learned after the sale that it was a low-volume store that needed \nserious repairs and new equipment. During her discussion with Matti, he informed Salone that \nMcDonald’s had paid for most of his expenses during the time he owned the restaurant because it \n111 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 112 of 158 PageID #:1899\nwas a low-volume, older store. However, McDonald’s did not provide this same support to \nSalone solely because of her race. \n586.  Following the sale, McDonald’s awarded Matti a higher volume store in an \naffluent commercial district. \n587.  Salone repeatedly approached Stroud, General Manager Sharlene Smith, and Vice \nPresident and General Manager Harry Coaxum to expand into more profitable locations and \noffset the costs of her lower-volume stores. She proposed locations including Alpharetta, Cobb, \nDunwoody, and Gwinnett, where the owner/operators of McDonald’s stores were predominantly \nwhite. All three denied her requests. \n588.  By contrast, white operators, including J.M. Owens, Frank and Pat Phalen, Tim \nPhalen, Keith Sirockman, and Jim Abetti, who experienced sales decreases as a result of traffic \nissues or road closures were awarded additional restaurants to offset the financial burden. Due to \nracial discrimination, McDonald’s blocked Salone from addressing the economic harm it had \ncaused her by placing her in a low-volume store. \n589.  On November 8, 2008, Salone sent an email to Regional Vice President Harry \nCoaxum, complaining about the unfair grading of her restaurants as well as Stroud’s behavior \nand tone in their meetings. Coaxum requested that she summarize Stroud’s inappropriate \nbehavior in an email. He indicated that other BMOA operators had voiced numerous complaints \nabout Stroud including her language, approach, and unannounced visits, as compared to white \noperators.  \n590.  Salone related that Stroud had told her she would not rewrite her restaurant. In \nresponse, Coaxum stated, “I am working with her on this issue as it relates to [her] treatment to \nBlack operators.” Salone also included in her email to Coaxum that two white operators—Ray \n112 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 113 of 158 PageID #:1900\nJustice and Keith Sirockman—had expressed that Stroud did not approach them in this manner, \nnor did they receive unannounced graded visits without notice. They stated that they would have \nkicked Stroud out of their restaurants if she had approached them in that manner. As a result, \nCoaxum was on notice of Stroud’s racial discrimination against Salone. \n591.  On January 9, 2009, Salone met with Stroud to request financial assistance for the \nBuckhead location as increasing real estate taxes were making operational costs higher. Salone \nwas aware that Lou Matti and Keith Muller, both white owner/operators in the area, had been \ngranted financial assistance. \n592.  Rather than approving financial assistance, Stroud recommended to Salone that \nshe sell both restaurants in order to purchase stores in more affluent areas. Again, because of her \nrace, Salone was denied financial assistance that Stroud had approved for white owner/operators. \n593.  Salone could not afford to sell both restaurants, given that she would need to \nforgo income and wait until McDonald’s approached her with another available restaurant. She \ntold Stroud that as a single parent of young children, she could not afford to sit out and wait for \nnew restaurant opportunities that might not come. She therefore refused Stroud’s proposal and \nrequested to keep both stores and receive other opportunities to buy additional stores.  \n594.  In response, Stroud sent her a recap of their discussion and indicated that the \nsituation would only get worse. Stroud and her staff began conducting graded visits of Salone’s \nrestaurants at late hours on weekdays and weekends. Stroud’s Field Consultant Willie Jackson \ntold Salone that he did not want to be in her restaurants at these off times, but that Stroud had \ninstructed him to do so. He also indicated that other white operators in the region, like Keith \nMuller, Keith Sirockman, and Jim Abetti, were not being subjected to such visits. \n113 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 114 of 158 PageID #:1901\n595.  In August of 2009, Salone was forced to sell the Buckhead store because the cost \nof maintaining it had become too high. \n596.  During her tenure as a franchisee, Salone expressed her concerns about her \ngrowth as compared to white operators to the NBMOA and her state representative. In turn, the \nNBMOA met with McDonald’s leadership on several occasions and complained about their lack \nof support for Salone. \n597.  On November 16, 2015, Georgia State Representative Billy Mitchell wrote a \nletter to McDonald’s, applauding Salone’s extraordinary business leadership in her community \nand how she had helped build the McDonald’s brand. He noted that he was aware of \nMcDonald’s unfair treatment of Salone as a Black, single-store operator, as compared to white \noperators, and expressed his disdain for McDonald’s attempt to force her out of the system. \nMitchell later recognized Salone at the state capitol for her leadership as a Black owner/operator \nin her community. \n598.  In retaliation for her complaints of discriminatory treatment to the NBMOA and \nto her state representative, between February and June 2016, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of \nforcing Black operators out of the system by increasing their inspections of Salone’s stores. \nGeneral Manager Smith, Regional Director of Operations Tammy Branham, and Field \nOperations Manager Noel Blackwood started conducting several unannounced inspections of her \nrestaurants. \n599.  In March 2016, Smith met with Salone and advised Salone to sell the Decatur \nstore to Keith Muller, a white owner/operator who owned 15 other stores. Salone pled with \nSmith not to force her out of the system and stated that as a female Black operator with a single \nstore and as a single parent, she would be leaving the system unwillingly. Indeed, Salone had \n114 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 115 of 158 PageID #:1902\nmet with the bank a month earlier, which had told her that she was a long-term operator and \nMcDonald’s could easily help in this situation, meaning that the bank could provide additional \nfunds for remodeling and restructuring. \n600.  On March 15, 2016, the NBMOA leadership met with Sharlene Smith on behalf \nof Salone and expressed their concerns that they were forcing a Black single parent out of the \nsystem. \n601.  McDonald’s did not budge. Facing financial concerns and under pressure from \nMcDonald’s, Salone put her Buckhead store up for sale for $1 million. \n602.  McDonald’s urged Keith Muller to buy the store. He initially offered Salone \n$200,000 before coming back with an offer of $625,000. Salone learned that Smith had offered \nhim 40% towards remodeling the restaurant if he bought the store at the higher price. Muller, as \na white owner/operator, had been offered an incentive to purchase the store that McDonald’s had \nnever proposed to Salone. \n603.  Smith contacted Salone and pressured her to sell the store to Muller, warning her \nthat her circumstances would worsen and she would receive no support from McDonald’s if she \ndid not sell. Salone therefore was forced to sell the restaurant to Muller in 2016 at a loss. Had \nSalone been a white owner/operator, Smith would not have pressured her to sell a profit-\ngenerating store. Additionally, this interference in the sale further demonstrated McDonald’s \nracial discrimination, as it forced Salone out of the system at a loss, in favor of its preferred \nwhite owner/operator. \n604.  As a result of the pressure and financial stress from her time at McDonald’s, \nSalone’s mental health has suffered and she has sought therapy. \n \n \n115 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 116 of 158 PageID #:1903\nJeremiah Simmons \n605.  Jeremiah Simmons owned and operated two McDonald’s stores in the New York \nregion. He is Black. \n606.  In 1997, Simmons purchased his first store in Wyandanch, NY, which was \nsupposed to be part of a two-store package. McDonald’s reneged on the original agreement and \nsold the second store to a white owner/operator. \n607.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees in substandard stores, McDonald’s proposed only such stores to Simmons as \nhe sought opportunities to expand. The New York Regional Manager presented him with \nfranchise opportunities in low-income, high-crime areas in Camden, Philadelphia (the same store \nthat was offered to Plaintiff Joseph Mbanefo), and New Jersey. Simmons visited the stores and \nrefused to take them on given their locations in high-crime areas. The Black owner/operator who \ntook over the Camden, Philadelphia location was shot and killed in a robbery at the store. The \nRegional Manager would not have offered these locations to Simmons but for his race. \n608.  In 2002, Simmons sold the Wyandanch store to buy a store in Brooklyn, NY, \nwhich required a complete rebuild. Four years later, in 2006, Simmons gave up the Brooklyn \nstore to purchase a two-store package, both in Jamaica, Queens, known as “Parsons 1” and \n“Parsons 2.” \n609.  The stores were located in a high crime, low-income neighborhood. Simmons had \nto employ security guards at both locations.  \n610.  Given the low volume of Parsons 1, McDonald’s asked him to close down the \nstore in 2008. \n611.  McDonald’s never offered Simmons any opportunities to purchase stores in high-\nincome, suburban areas, solely because of his race. \n116 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 117 of 158 PageID #:1904\n612.  McDonald’s denied Simmons financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. Given the high rent fee \non the Parsons 2 location, 17.25%, Simmons repeatedly asked his Regional Manager and Field \nService Manager for rent relief. He approached them with his attorney and accountant. \nMcDonald’s never granted his requests. \n613.  After the New York co-op voted to install McCafé in all of the region’s stores, \nSimmons was forced to invest in a McCafé for his Parsons 2 location.   \n614.  Between the McCafé investment, dollar menu additions, his high rent fee, and \nMcDonald’s repeated denial of rent relief, Simmons could no longer afford to maintain his store \nand decided to sell. \n615.  Simmons agreed to sell the store for $2.3 million to Dave Galinsky, a white \nowner/operator, who drew up a contract for the sale. However, USA Senior Vice President and \nChief Restaurant Officer Mason Smoot requested to meet with Galinsky over dinner. Two days \nlater, Galinsky rescinded his offer. \n616.  The only remaining interested buyer was Bruce Colley, another white/owner \noperator that McDonald’s had hand-picked to take over the store, who purchased the franchise \nlocation for $2.1 million in 2010. As a result of McDonald’s interfering with the sale, Simmons \nlost $200,000. This interference in the sale further demonstrated McDonald’s racial \ndiscrimination, as it forced Simmons out of the system at a loss, in favor of its preferred white \nowner/operator. \nFloyd Sims \n617.  Floyd Sims is a former owner and operator of seven McDonald’s franchise \nlocations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. He is Black. \n117 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 118 of 158 PageID #:1905\n618.  In 2000, Sims entered the McDonald’s franchise system after completing two \nyears of unpaid training in the Registered Applicant Program and attending Hamburger \nUniversity. Atlanta Regional Vice President Bill Lamar helped place him in a location in Atlanta \non 4334 Fulton Industrial Boulevard (“Fulton” restaurant). In keeping with McDonald’s \ndiscriminatory practice of intentionally placing Black franchisees into substandard stores in \nBlack neighborhoods, Lamar directed Sims to such a store, telling him that this location was an \nexcellent opportunity for him. The store was in low-income area, but as with many similarly \nsituated African Americans, Sims’ choice was either to accept the offer or be denied the chance \nto become a franchisee, so Sims accepted the offer.  \n619.  Sims purchased the Fulton restaurant for $510,000 with a percentage rent of \n8.5%. Unfortunately for Sims, the Fulton restaurant was plagued with issues from the very \nmoment he received the keys. The store was located in one of the most dangerous areas of \nAtlanta. Despite the high crime rate of the area and the restaurant’s poor track record, Sims was \nable to make the store profitable.  \n620.  As a result of his success with the Fulton restaurant, McDonald’s soon awarded \nSims another store. In 2004, having met the criteria for expansion, Sims entered into another \nfranchise agreement with McDonald’s for a store located at 5710 Fulton Industrial Blvd.  \n621.  In 2007, Sims purchased a store in Mableton, Georgia for $700,000 (“Mableton” \nrestaurant). This store, like others in his organization, was also located in an economically \ndepressed “inner-city” neighborhood.  \n622.  Shortly thereafter, in 2008, McDonald’s built a much larger location nearby Sims’ \nMableton location. Rather than allowing Sims the opportunity to purchase the store, McDonald’s \nawarded it to another white owner/operator.  \n118 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 119 of 158 PageID #:1906\n623.  This new McDonald’s restaurant was detrimental to Sims’ location. The impact of \nits competition caused sales at his Mableton store to decrease by approximately $300,000 per \nyear.  \n624.  Simultaneously, Sims’ first restaurant, the Fulton restaurant, began losing money \nas the surrounding neighborhood experienced dramatic deterioration, due to a rise in crime. \n625.  In 2010, however, Sims was presented with an opportunity to grow his business \nand balance out his restaurants’ financial situation with a better performing restaurant, after \nbeing approached by a white owner/operator, J.M. Owens, who wished to sell him four \nMcDonald’s locations.  \n626.  Sims was willing and eager to purchase these locations but the sale was initially \nblocked by QSCVP Debbie Stroud, without providing a legitimate business reason. \n627.  McDonald’s eventually approved the deal and Sims followed through with the \npurchase of four additional stores in Smyrna, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, for $2.5 million. \nSims became the first African American to own four stores in Cobb County. However, the stores \nwere all older and in need of significant remodeling on tight timelines. \n628.  After he purchased the Marietta locations, Sims discovered that one of the \nMarietta locations was infested with roaches. This was something that McDonald’s failed to \ndisclose to him. \n629.  Another of Sims’ locations, the Windy Hill Road store in Smyrna, was initially \nsuccessful. However, in 2014, Sims learned from Max Bacon, Mayor of Smyrna, that \nMcDonald’s was building a new store in an area called “The Crossing” at 3260 South Cobb \nDrive, Smyrna, Georgia, close to the store Sims had just purchased.   \n119 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 120 of 158 PageID #:1907\n630.  McDonald’s wanted to sell the store to a white owner/operator, but Max Bacon \ntold Sims to communicate to McDonald’s that if Sims was not going to be the owner, Bacon \nwould not approve the store’s development. \n631.  Sims first expressed his reservations about the store’s financial projections to \nMcDonald’s Finance Manager Steve Stringler and requested a lower rent percentage rate in \nbuying the store, given that he would need to shut down his current store nearby to make the \npurchase. \n632.  McDonald’s leadership was unwilling to lock in a permanent rent structure, and \ninstead advised Sims that if the restaurant did not make any sales, then the rate would adjust in \nthe future. They negotiated the percentage rate and McDonald’s initially dropped it to 6% in May \n2016. But only seven months later, in January 2017, McDonald’s doubled the rent to 13%. The \nrent escalation had a detrimental impact on Sims’ business. \n633.  At the same time, Sims’ original Fulton store continued to struggle financially. \nGreg Watson and QSCVP Valerie Williams would not entertain any options to close the store or \nallow Sims to sell it back to them.  \n634.  At that point, the restaurant had become more of a crime scene than a dining \nestablishment. Multiple shootings and a murder had occurred on the Fulton restaurant’s \npremise—an individual had been shot in the head in the parking lot. \n635.  In 2015, Sims reached out to Watson and Williams for help. He detailed the \nsituation with the stores and asked them to consider closing the Fulton restaurant, which had \nbecome a money pit and a liability at that point. The Fulton restaurant had also reached its \nexpiration term for the lease and its closure would allow the other stores Sims owned to gain \nsales and turn a profit. \n120 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 121 of 158 PageID #:1908\n636.  McDonald’s denied Sims financial assistance in the form of rent relief, routinely \noffered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. Specifically, Sims sent a detailed \nletter to Watson and Stringler that if they insisted on keeping the Fulton restaurant open, he \nwould need their support in paying for an armed security guard and permanent rent reduction. He \nalso asked for rent reduction at the Mapleton restaurant, which had a net positive cashflow of \nonly $26,000 annually. The rent was 11% at that time and he asked for a 5% reduction over the \nnext four years. Watson denied his request without providing a reason. By contrast, McDonald’s \nhad provided rent relief to other white owner/operators in the region, including Doug Taper and \nStanford Delky. \n637.  After McDonald’s refused to close the Fulton restaurant, Sims informed them that \nhe would not be seeking to renew the new agreement. \n638.  Watson then advised Sims that the non-renewal of one restaurant in a franchise \nmeant non-renewal of all the stores a franchisee owned. Sims did not want to lose all of his \nstores but was forced to sell the remaining stores. \n639.  After rejecting a new 20-year term franchise agreement at the Fulton store, Sims \nbegan to feel McDonald’s wrath. McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out \nof the system by increasing their inspections of all of Sims’ stores, and he began receiving low \nmarks on his business reviews. \n640.  By 2016, McDonald’s was trying to force him to sell his restaurants. Watson \ninformed Sims that he needed to sell two of his restaurants. McDonald’s eventually closed the \nFulton store because no one would buy it. \n641.  In 2016, Smyrna announced plans to widen Windy Hill Road. Sims was forced to \nclose his location because of the city’s road construction. McDonald’s would have known that \n121 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 122 of 158 PageID #:1909\nthese changes were in the works when the second location owned by the white owner/operator \nwas remodeled. However, McDonald’s gave Sims no notice of this.  \n642.  Also in 2016, McDonald’s refused to renew Sims’ lease on his 13402 Fulton \nIndustrial Blvd location.  \n643.  McDonald’s then approached Sims and told him they wanted him to close two of \nhis four stores—one in Marietta and one in Smyrna. This request fell into McDonald’s practice \nof forcing successful Black franchisees with multiple locations to downsize and thus prevent \nthem from acquiring wealth.  \n644.  When Sims refused to do what McDonald’s requested of him, the company began \na retaliation campaign against him. \n645.  McDonald’s VP Greg Watson (“Watson”) removed the field consultant Sims had \nlong worked with and replaced that individual with a series of different field consultants who \npromptly began a systematic series of unnecessary inspections and gradings designed to rate \nSims locations poorly and force him out of business.  \n646.  Sims received a series of letters from Watson urging him to sell his locations. \n647.  In 2016, Sims traveled to McDonald’s regional office and attempted to complain \nabout what he viewed as race-related treatment to Watson and Steve Stringler, Finance Manager. \nSims’ complaints fell on deaf ears.  \n648.  Also in 2016, McDonald’s changed the terms of the lease on his other Smyrna \nlocation on South Cobb Drive in an effort to get him to sell. This led to significant financial \nlosses for Sims.  \n122 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 123 of 158 PageID #:1910\n649.  In approximately 2017, QSCVP Valerie Williams told him that if he refused to \nsell his 20594 Fulton Industrial Boulevard location, the entire region was going to come after \nhim. As a result, in 2017, Sims sold two of his stores for approximately $1.5 million. \n650.  McDonald’s then went after his final four stores in Cobb County by increasing \ninspections and trying to force failures. \n651.  McDonald’s targeted Sims with harsh inspections and enforcement on the \npretextual basis of its Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 program, which required operators to heavily \ninvest in order to modernize all restaurants. If the required investments were not made, restaurant \nowners were considered to be in breach. Sims received a breach letter from McDonald’s in \nDecember 2017 for his two Marietta restaurants. \n652.  When he received passing marks by one field consultant, Wasef, that consultant \nwas replaced by a field consultant willing to do McDonald’s bidding. McDonald’s began \nunreasonably, zealously, and selectively searching for imperfections and crawling on floors to \ngive him failing marks. \n653.  When the inspections failed to force Sims out of the system, Watson increased the \nrent on his restaurants and declined his request to provide rent relief.  \n654.  Sims was finally forced to find a buyer for his restaurants and sell. In 2018, he \nsold his remaining franchise locations in Cobb County, despite the fact that he did not want to \nleave the system. \n655.  Sims sold these stores to Jeff Hedrick, a white owner/operator, who had more \nthan 25 stores in the Atlanta area. \n123 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 124 of 158 PageID #:1911\n656.  Sims was in attendance at a Black McDonald’s Owner Association meeting where \nMcDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook walked out of the meeting when confronted by Black \nowner/operator complaints of discriminatory treatment.  \nAllen Stafford \n657.  Allen Stafford is a former owner and operator of twelve McDonald’s franchise \nlocations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. He is Black. \n658.  Stafford won the Regional Managers Award for the Atlanta Region in 2016.  \n659.  Stafford originally worked in McDonald’s corporate office as special coordinator \nsupervisor and a pathway coordinator. He was approached by Marvin Whaley and Bill Winger \nwho suggested he would be a great owner/operator. Whaley and Winger recruited Stafford to the \nBFL Program.  \n660.  Unbeknownst to him, McDonald’s saw Stafford as an ideal owner/operator they \ncould use to acquire information about different failing locations. \n661.  Stafford purchased his first McDonald’s franchise location at the CNN Center in \ndowntown Atlanta, Georgia, in 1992. Whaley placed Stafford in this location. McDonald’s \nwanted the previous owner out and told Stafford that he could make significant profits at this \nlocation with McDonald’s help.  \n662.   McDonald’s lowered the rent on this location to incentivize Stafford to invest. \nApproximately a year and half after he purchased it, McDonald’s moved the location from one \nspace inside the CNN Center to another, telling Stafford it would increase his profits. \nMcDonald’s then raised the rent.  \n663.  In 1993, Whaley helped Stafford acquire a Special Distribution Store located at \nGeorgia State University. McDonald’s raised the rent significantly. Stafford requested rental \nrelief for this location, which was routinely provided to white owner/operators, but was denied \n124 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 125 of 158 PageID #:1912\nsolely because he was Black. By contrast, McDonald’s had provided rent relief to other white \nowner/operators in the region, including Doug Taper and Stanford Delky. \n664.  In 1997, Stafford acquired the Sandy Springs location. In 2016, Stafford requested \nrent relief on this location and was denied. McDonald’s requested that he complete renovations \non this location but Stafford informed McDonald’s he could not afford to do so. By contrast, \nMcDonald’s did not require a white owner/operator, Patrick Dennis, in the same region to make \nany reinvestments to his restaurant after purchasing it. \n665.  In 2017 through 2018, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators \nout of the system by increasing their inspections of Stafford’s stores. QSCVP Valerie Williams \nwould frequently come to this location with a consultant inspector and conduct these inspections \nherself, which was highly unusual. \n666.  Frank Phalen was a white owner/operator located a few miles from Stafford’s \nSandy Springs location who was not subject to the same type or frequency of inspections during \nthis same time period. But for his race, Stafford would not have been subject to such constant, \ndemanding inspections. \n667.  In 2000, Stafford acquired several locations, including another Special \nDistribution Store location on Marriot and Broad Streets. He also acquired locations on Mitchell \nStreet, Peachtree, and two locations within the Atlanta Zoo. He requested rent relief for all these \nlocations but did not receive it.  \n668.  McDonald’s specifically directed Stafford to the Marriot and Broad Street \nlocation, a substandard location with low-volume sales and higher operating costs. \n669.  McDonald’s induced Stafford to agree to the Marriot and Broad Street acquisition \nby telling him that if he finished out the existing lease, McDonald’s would agree to renew the \n125 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 126 of 158 PageID #:1913\nlease for a fresh, 20-year term. However, McDonald’s never had any intention of renewing the \nlease, and at the end of the initial lease term, McDonald’s closed this location without any \nwarning.  \n670.  Also in 2000, Bill Lamar suggested that Stafford needed a big store location to \nhelp keep his smaller, failing locations afloat. Lamar then helped Stafford acquire the Moreland \nlocation. Later, in 2013, Stafford did a rebuild of this large location.  \n671.  In 2005, at the direction of Bill Lamar, Stafford acquired a location on Glenwood \nAvenue that had five years remaining on the previous owner’s lease (with a right of renewal). \nThis location was in a poor, Black neighborhood and after the lease term was up, McDonald’s \nrefused to renew the lease and closed this location.  \n672.  Stafford asked several McDonald’s managers—including Jeff Wilfong, Sharlene \nSmith, and General Manager of the Atlanta Region Greg Watson—for rent relief for his \nlocations between 2013 and 2017 but was ultimately denied.  \n673.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Stafford, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. In 2018, McDonald’s told Stafford he needed to do a Major Renovation Project \n(“MRP”) at several of his locations. Stafford told McDonald’s that he could not afford to do an \nMRP at the Jimmy Carter and Sandy Springs locations. \n674.  In 2019, after Stafford complained to McDonald’s about their unreasonable \ndemands that he do the MRP, McDonald’s retaliated against Stafford by conducting additional \ninspections and giving poor grades to Stafford’s Jimmy Carter location. The Jimmy Carter \nlocation was placed on an Improvement Process for Underperforming Restaurants (“IPUR”). At \nthe time, there were far worse locations owned by white owner/operators in Stafford’s trading \n126 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 127 of 158 PageID #:1914\narea that were not on an IPUR but were much worse in terms of operations and sales, including \nones that could not pass health inspections. However, these locations were treated differently \nthan Stafford’s location because they were owned by white franchisees. But for Stafford being \nBlack, he would not have been placed on an IPUR. \n675.  Stafford’s son, Allen Stafford Jr., was in the Next Generation program but \nfollowing Stafford’s complaints to McDonald’s about their unreasonable directives, McDonald’s \nretaliated by refusing to promote his son out of the program. Two other white candidates that \nwere similarly situated and in the program at the same time as Stafford’s son, were, however, \npromoted. Stafford’s son would have been promoted but for his race and but for Stafford’s \ncomplaints. \n676.  Unwilling to continue to be retaliated against, Stafford sold the Jimmy Carter, \nSandy Springs, Moreland Avenue, and Powers Ferry locations, his four remaining locations, in \nJuly of 2019.  \nSerge and Karen Tancrede \n677.  Serge Tancrede and his wife, Karen Tancrede, owned and operated four \nMcDonald’s stores in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are Black. \n678.  Prior to becoming an owner/operator, Karen was a Franchise Manager at \nMcDonald’s. She was responsible for interviewing, selecting, and screening potential \nMcDonald’s owner/operators up and down the East Coast. \n679.  Karen witnessed McDonald’s purposeful efforts to place more Black operators \ninto stores to fulfill then-CEO Ed Rensi’s pledge of parity for Black operators. She warned \nGeneral Managers at the time that they needed to be careful not to grow franchisees in markets \nthat were not necessarily prepared for in terms of security concerns. They did not heed her \nwarnings and continued to place them in high-crime locations. \n127 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 128 of 158 PageID #:1915\n680.  Before becoming an owner/operator, Serge was a Business Consultant for \nMcDonald’s. In that role, he conducted inspections of owner/operators’ stores. Serge saw \nfirsthand how McDonald’s forced out operators that it wanted to eliminate from the system by \nincreasing the frequency of inspections. In doing so, McDonald’s increased the likelihood that \nbusiness consultants would spot issues McDonald’s could use to justify an operator’s exit. \n681.  The Tancredes’ journey as McDonald’s franchisees began in early 2004, when the \nowner/operator of the 56th and Vine location in Philadelphia was murdered in a robbery attempt \nat the store. Serge was the store’s Business Consultant and knew and liked the team. He pitched \nthe idea to McDonald’s of taking over the store with Karen as joint owner/operators.  \n682.  QSCVP Rich Doane and Regional General Manager Dave Murphy insisted that if \nSerge and Karen were to enter the system as owner/operators of 56th and Vine, they would also \nhave to purchase a store on Chestnut Hill. This was in keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory \npractice of casting off undesirable locations it no longer wanted to run to Black franchisees. \n683.  The Chestnut Hill location faced serious security issues and had been the target of  \nviolence. At one point, its managers were violently injured to the point that a hazmat team was \ncalled in to clean up the blood. \n684.  The Chestnut Hill store also presented financial concerns, as it had \nunderperformed under its former owner/operator Rosa Rosado. After Rosado failed to achieve \npositive cash flow on the store and demanded to sell it, McDonald’s bought the store back from \nher. Because McDonald’s did not want to operate it, McDonald’s cast it off to the Tancredes. If \nthe Tancredes were not Black owner/operators, McDonald’s would never have given them an all-\nor-nothing deal that included the Chestnut Hill store. \n128 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 129 of 158 PageID #:1916\n685.  The Tancredes accepted the two-store package but struggled to run Chestnut Hill. \nMcDonald’s failed to disclose that the restaurant was infested with mold. It had also failed to \ninform them that the street in front of the restaurant would be undergoing construction, though \nMcDonald’s was aware of the construction plans. The construction reduced Chestnut Hill’s sales \nby 80%. As a result, the Tancredes were losing an average of $10,000 per month on this location.  \n686.  McDonald’s denied the Tancredes financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because they were Black. The Tancredes \nrequested rent relief, given the store’s construction and mold issues. They worked with \naccountants to craft proposals for temporary rent relief, but Rich Doane, on behalf of \nMcDonald’s, refused. \n687.  Upon information and belief, McDonald’s had granted rent relief to other \nsimilarly situated owner/operators in the region who were not Black, including Rosa Rosado, \nChris Chung, and the Dukart family.  \n688.  Bleeding money from the Chestnut Hill store, the Tancredes told Rich Doane they \nwanted to leave the location and were willing to give it back to McDonald’s for nothing. Doane \nrefused, though he had permitted a non-Black operator—Rosado—to sell the store back to \nMcDonald’s. \n689.  Instead of providing the Tancredes with assistance for the Chestnut Hill store, \nMcDonald’s sent in a corporate auditor.  \n690.  In approximately 2009–2010, the Tancredes sold the Chestnut Hill location for $1 \nby including it in a package deal with their more profitable Germantown location. \n691.  In addition to those two locations, two of the Tancredes’ stores—52nd and Vine \nand 56th and Vine—were located in the highest crime area of Philadelphia. Even so, the \n129 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 130 of 158 PageID #:1917\nTancredes worked relentlessly to make the stores a success and became two of the top operators \nin the Philadelphia region. \n692.  Though McDonald’s was aware of the security concerns and risks of operating \nthese stores, particularly given the murder of the last owner/operator, McDonald’s refused to \nhelp offset the cost of the security measures the Tancredes were forced to implement. \n693.  Serge and Karen Tancrede worked with a security task force, led by fellow \nowner/operator John Dawkins, to provide real life examples and suggestions on how inner-city \nrestaurants can be secured, and on the financial support that would be appropriately sought from \nMcDonald’s Corporation considering the extensive shared liabilities. Some of the ideas they \nproposed included upgraded lighting in the restaurants, better security cameras, and bulletproof \nwindows in certain stores. McDonald’s also conducted a study to see what solutions could be \nimplemented. \n694.  Following that study, McDonald’s, including General Manager Deb Massa, chose \na select few owner/operators and provided them with financial assistance for security concerns. \nHowever, Massa denied the Tancredes’ request for such financial assistance. \n695.  Indeed, each time the Tancredes requested financial assistance, they were told that \ntheir restaurants performed well above the national average in sales revenue and therefore they \ndid not need McDonald’s financial help. While it was accurate that the sales revenue on these \ntwo locations was above the national average, it was also true that the profitability and return on \ninvestment was well below that of restaurants with the same sales revenue. This was due to the \nadditional cost burdens that came with operating restaurants in an inner-city environment. In \nfact, only certain owner/operators, namely white franchisees, were granted that financial \nassistance. McDonald’s denied financial assistance to the Tancredes because of their race. \n130 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 131 of 158 PageID #:1918\n696.  The danger of operating the 52nd and Vine and 56th and Vine stores escalated. In \nspring 2008, two men followed Serge home from the store and robbed him of $30,000 in cash at \ngunpoint. The robbers beat Serge, shot at, and almost killed him. \n697.  Serge had been transporting some of the cash proceeds home prior to depositing \nthem at the bank. Rather than offering security solutions or support, the General Manager of the \nregion responded by telling Serge that he had put other operators at risk by having cash on him. \n698.  Following Serge’s assault, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black \noperators out of the system by increasing their inspections of the couple’s stores. Field Services \nManager Stacey Sharpneck and Business Consultant Rosalyn Tyson began conducting frequent \nand unannounced inspections of the Tancredes’ stores. The Tancredes passed all the inspections \nwith flying colors. \n699.  Given their prior professional experience in McDonald’s corporate, Serge and \nKaren recognized the increased inspections as McDonald’s attempt to force them out of the \nsystem. McDonald’s was retaliating against them because Serge had been vocal about the \ndifferential treatment operators in the region faced. \n700.  In conjunction with the inspections, McDonald’s made unreasonable requests for \nthe Tancredes to renovate their two remaining stores, including that they build a McCafé at the \nVine Street and 52nd and Chestnut locations, as part of McDonald’s national roll-out of McCafé.  \n701.  The Tancredes pled with McDonald’s to exclude both of their locations from this \nplan because it was not economically viable to install a McCafé in a high-crime area of \nPhiladelphia. They pointed to the fact that there were no Starbucks or Dunkin’ Donuts in this \narea of the city. McDonald’s did not listen and insisted that they install a McCafé to avoid \ndefault. \n131 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 132 of 158 PageID #:1919\n702.  To protect their mental health and quality of life, the Tancredes were eventually \nforced to sell off their last remaining restaurant. They notified McDonald’s of the closing date \nfor the sale of the two restaurants. Several weeks prior to the sale, at the Tancredes’ annual \nbusiness review, the Tancredes communicated the sale of their last remaining store to Regional \nManager Harry Coaxum directly. He lamented, “That’s a shame. We were prepared to discuss \ntoday relocating you to a multiple store package in Delaware and facilitating the sale of this \nrestaurant.” The restaurants in Delaware he was referring to were high-crime areas that \nMcDonald’s owned as company stores and were looking to cast off on Black operators. \n703.  On the closing date, no one from corporate made themselves available to sign off \non the deal, which was highly unusual. The closing date had been clearly identified in the \npurchase and sale agreement with owner/operator Scott Nigh. McDonald’s had financially \napproved the sale, but it was made clear that McDonald’s Corporation did not agree with or \nsupport Scott Nigh as the purchaser. Karen had to call personal friends in corporate to force the \nsale through. \nGordon Thornton \n \n704.  Gordon Thornton is a former owner and operator of four McDonald’s stores in the \nRaleigh/Durham, North Carolina, region. \n705.  Thornton began working at McDonald’s corporate shortly after college. Since \nthen, he has held various positions, including Director of Operations and Ombudsman.    \n706.  Thornton first became a McDonald’s franchise owner/operator in 1993. In \nkeeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing Black franchisees into \nsubstandard stores in Black neighborhoods, between 1993 and 2012, McDonald’s placed \nThornton in such stores with low-volume sales and higher operating costs due to crime, higher \n132 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 133 of 158 PageID #:1920\ninsurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely because of his race.  Thornton sought to \npurchase a restaurant in a neighborhood that was not predominantly Black, but McDonald’s \ndenied him the opportunity because of his race. \n707.  McDonald’s denied Thornton financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. Around 2012, two of \nhis stores were impacted by eminent domain. Thornton subsequently asked McDonald’s for \nfinancial assistance but was not provided sufficient relief to supplement the loss to his stores.  \nBut for Thornton’s race, Thornton would have been provided sufficient relief to offset the impact \non his stores. \n708.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Thornton, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. In 2012, Thornton was required to remodel to meet McDonald’s new operating \nstandards. McDonald’s knew the remodel was not financially feasible for Thornton but did not \nprovide him with sufficient alternative relief, as white owner/operators were being provided in \nhis region.   \n709.  As a result, Thornton was forced to sell his stores in 2012. But for Thornton’s \nrace, he would not have lost these stores. \nRonnie Thornton \n \n710.  Ronnie Thornton is a former owner and operator of five McDonald’s stores in the \nRaleigh/Durham, North Carolina, region. He is Black. \n711.  Thornton served his country as a Captain in the U.S. Army. Upon completing his \nmilitary obligation, Thornton left the military in 1990 and entered the corporate world as a \nMarket Manager with Kentucky Fried Chicken, during which he was responsible for managing \n133 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 134 of 158 PageID #:1921\n12 KFC restaurants in North Carolina. After successful working as a Market Manager for sever \nyears, Thornton decided to pursue his dream of becoming an entrepreneur and applied to become \na McDonald’s franchisee. Once he was accepted into the program, he completed the qualification \nprocess and successfully completed his Hamburger University training in nine months—a \nremarkably short period of time.  \n712.  Thornton became a McDonald’s franchise owner/operator in 1998 as part of \nMcDonald’s program to increase parity among Black operators. While waiting for an offer for \nhis first store in 1998, he approached McDonald's about acquiring the restaurant near the \nGreensboro, North Carolina Airport, since it was currently managed by McOpCo and in \nrelatively near proximity to where he lived.  Instead of approving this sale, McDonald’s directed \nThornton to take over the Summit Ave. location several miles further away, which was also a \nMcOpCo-run store and the oldest McDonald’s in the state, as it opened in 1959. In addition, the \nlocation was in dire need of rebuild and was guarded around the clock because of its location in a \nhigh-crime, low-income area.   \n713.  McDonald’s excluded Thornton from the same opportunities to purchase higher-\nvolume, lower-cost stores offered to white franchisees. In 1998, McDonald’s sold the \nGreensboro Airport location to a white owner/operator, Scott Lang.  But for his race, \nMcDonald’s would have allowed Thornton to purchase this restaurant.  Instead, in keeping with \nMcDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing Black franchisees into substandard \nstores, McDonald’s directed him to a less profitable location. \n714.  Throughout the years, McDonald’s sold Thornton the first, sixth, and twenty-\nninth oldest restaurants in North Carolina, all of which had on-site security and were in desperate \nneed of rebuilds. In one case, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of \n134 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 135 of 158 PageID #:1922\nthe system by increasing their inspections of Thornton’s store. Business Consultant Mildred \nStutts began conducting unreasonable and unequal inspections to generate poor business \nreviews.  Marty Ranft, then Regional Manager, relied on these business reviews to deny \nThornton rewrite on the sixth oldest location, which forced Thornton to sell the location and \noperate as a single-store owner, beginning in 2003. Thornton requested that Stutts be replaced as \nhis consultant, after which he was able to repurchase that location, as well as an additional three \nlocations over the next seven years.   \n715.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Thornton, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of his race and in violation of the franchising \nagreement. This was despite the fact that McDonald’s knew Thornton would not be able to \nreadily execute the remodels, as he owned some of the oldest and most dilapidated restaurants in \nthe state. \n716.  McDonald’s denied Thornton financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. In 2011, McDonald’s \nsought to build a new restaurant (“Richfield”) near his area for no legitimate business \nreason.  When McDonald’s informed Thornton of the new store, Thornton advised McDonald’s \nthat the new location would lose money for quite some time and that it would also adversely \naffect the sales and profits at his other two locations in Stanly County, North Carolina.  When \nMcDonald’s decided to move forward with the Richfield location anyway, Thornton was forced \nto either purchase the location or suffer the financial impact of a new store eating into his \nsales.  But for Thornton's race, McDonald’s would not have forced this new store to be built in \nThornton's area. \n135 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 136 of 158 PageID #:1923\n717.  Around 2017, and in conjunction with Bigger Bolder Vision 2020, McDonald’s \nprepared to impose new and more stringent requirements to reinvest in new products and \nequipment that would put Thornton's business under cash flow stress.  Because he simply could \nnot afford to invest in the new program and three rebuilds, Thornton was forced to sell his stores \nin 2017. \nErrol Thybulle \n718.  Plaintiff Errol Thybulle owned and operated two restaurants, as well as two \nsatellite restaurants, in the South Bronx, New York. Thybulle is Black. \n719.  Thybulle wanted to work in the New York region. In keeping with McDonald’s \ndiscriminatory practice of intentionally placing Black franchisees into substandard stores in \nBlack neighborhoods, in April 1990, McDonald’s awarded him his first franchise location in the \nSouth Bronx—one of the highest crime areas of the city. McDonald’s told him that it was the \nonly location available.  \n720.  Thybulle regularly faced security issues at his restaurants, including individuals \nslashing seats and graffitiing the walls. To maintain the store and ensure staff safety, Thybulle \nhad to hire extra security guards and spend an abnormal amount on maintenance and repairs. \nThybulle spent approximately twice the typical amount of maintenance and repair fees and two \nto four times the normal amount of security fees on his stores. \n721.  During his regular operator reviews with then-Regional Manager Paul Facella and \nfield service managers, all of whom were white, Thybulle repeatedly requested rent relief to \noffset the high cost of security and repairs.  \n722.  McDonald’s denied Thybulle financial assistance in the form of rent relief, \nroutinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. While McDonald’s \n136 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 137 of 158 PageID #:1924\ngranted white owner/operators rent relief, they allowed Thybulle to financially struggle without \nstepping in to help. \n723.  McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Thybulle’s stores. Field service representatives began conducting \nunannounced inspections of Thybulle’s stores, including on weekend days.  \n724.  When Thybulle asked white colleagues whether they were ever subject to an \nunannounced inspection on a Saturday at 5 PM, they responded that it had never happened to \nthem. But for his race, Thybulle would not have been subjected to unannounced inspections at \nunreasonable hours. \n725.  Thybulle was ultimately forced to close his two satellite stores because the \nsecurity and maintenance costs were too high to maintain, and the stress of operations had \nbecome too much to bear. \nWilliam (Pete) Washington \n \n726.  William Washington is a Virginia resident and a former owner/operator of six \nstores in the Richmond, Virginia, region during his tenure at McDonald’s. He is Black. \n727.  Washington began working at McDonald’s in 1973 and became a franchisee \nwhen he purchased his first store in 1998.   \n728.  During his first year as an owner/operator, McDonald’s recognized Washington \nas “Rookie of the Year.” He served as secretary of the Richmond owner/operator co-op and the \nVirginia Black McDonald’s Owner Association for more than 15 years. Washington was also \nrecognized with numerous regional awards during his early years for sales and transaction \nincreases. \n137 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 138 of 158 PageID #:1925\n729.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, between 1994 and 2016, \nMcDonald’s directed Washington into such stores, with low-volume sales and higher operating \ncosts due to crime, higher insurance rates, and higher employee turnover, solely because of his \nrace. Washington sought to buy restaurants from a white owner/operator, Donald J. Both, who \nowned approximately 17 restaurants in the Richmond region.  But McDonald’s did not approve \nthose sales because Washington was Black and allowed him to purchase restaurants only in \nBlack neighborhoods.    \n730.  In 2010, Washington downsized to two restaurants—the two most challenging \nstores to run in the highest crime area of the city. \n731.  McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Washington’s stores. Between 1994 and 2013, Washington \nconsistently received positive business reviews following inspections. Yet, in or around 2014, \nMcDonald’s inspectors began regularly arriving to his stores with the goal of documenting the \nsmallest infraction. For example, he received a lower grade when the corporation told him that \nhis employees were not “smiling enough.” But for Washington’s race, these unreasonable \ninspections and grading would not have occurred. \n732.  McDonald’s required Washington to invest in a relocation of his store within a \nshort timeframe not required of white franchisees in locations McDonald’s knew would fail to \ngenerate an adequate return on an individual’s investment. For example, in 2016, McDonald’s \nrequired Washington to relocate, even though it would have substantially increased his debt \nwithout comparable revenue. The relocation would have also increased his rent from \napproximately 8 to 14%. Washington requested alternative options where, at the very least, his \n138 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 139 of 158 PageID #:1926\nrent would not skyrocket. McDonald’s denied Washington financial assistance in the form of \nrent relief, routinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. By contrast, \nMcDonald’s had provided white owner/operators in the region, like Sue Derlack, meaningful \nfinancial assistance in similar circumstances. \n733.  As a result of McDonald’s discrimination against him, Washington had no choice \nbut to sell his stores in 2016.   \nLance Williams \n734.  Plaintiff Lance Williams owned and operated two McDonald’s stores in the \nAtlanta region. He is Black. \n735.  Prior to entering the McDonald’s franchise system, Williams worked as a \nMcDonald’s corporate employee for several years. In 1995, Williams was a business field \nconsultant for five to seven local McDonald’s operators, during which time he learned about the \nfranchise system. As a field consultant, McDonald’s pressured Williams to “find something \nwrong” with other franchisees’ restaurants whenever McDonald’s wanted to force those \nfranchisees out of the system.  \n736.  In 2001, Williams became a McDonald’s franchisee when he acquired two stores \nin the Mobile, Alabama, region. Williams lived in New Orleans and relocated to Alabama for the \nopportunity to begin a career as a McDonald’s operator. \n737.  Within the Mobile metropolitan area, there were approximately 30 McDonald’s \nrestaurants at the time. Until 2010, Williams was the only Black owner/operator of those 30 \nlocations.  \n738.  In 2009, McDonald’s started sending field consultants to check on Williams’ \nstores more and more frequently. At one point, field consultants were visiting Williams’ stores \nweekly, but not visiting the other stores in the area with that same regularity.   \n139 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 140 of 158 PageID #:1927\n739.  Beginning in 2012, McDonald’s made it increasingly difficult for Williams to \nsuccessfully operate his stores. McDonald’s field consultants reported that there were “food \nsafety issues” at Williams’s stores, even though no such issues existed. From his experience as a \nField Consultant with McDonald’s, Williams knew that consultants reported “food safety issues” \nto manufacture a breach of contract claim for McDonald’s and force an operator out of the \nsystem.  \n740.  The frequency of these visits became so excessive that Williams asked the Field \nConsultants how he could reduce their visits. The Field Consultant told Williams, “If you get \nhere before we do, there won’t be any issues.” The next visit by the consultants was at \napproximately 5:30 am.  \n741.  McDonald’s threatened Williams that if he did not immediately sell his stores, he \nwould be in default and indebted approximately one million dollars. Accordingly, Williams was \nforced to sell his stores in 2013.  \n742.  Solely because he was one of the only Black operators in an overwhelmingly \nwhite region, McDonald’s deployed its tactic of forcing Black operators out of the system by \nincreasing their inspections of Williams’ stores. They succeeded and Williams was forced to sell \nhis stores. \nNorman Williams \n743.  Norman Williams owned and operated a McDonald’s store in the Richmond \nregion of Virginia. He is Black. \n744.  Williams worked for McDonald’s for nearly 17 years before becoming a \nfranchisee. His roles included manager trainee, business consultant, supervisor, and field service \nmanager.  \n140 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 141 of 158 PageID #:1928\n745.  Williams became an owner/operator in 1994 in the Indianapolis region. Initially, \nWilliams asked to look at stores near his home in the St. Louis region. But Regional Manager \nKevin Don refused and told Williams that he would only recommend him for other regional \nstores and that McDonald’s would not sell him a restaurant in the St. Louis area. \n746.  Around the same time, a white colleague who had similarly been pushed out of \ncorporate was searching for purchasing opportunities in the St. Louis area. McDonald’s \npresented him and another white male opportunities to buy restaurants in the St. Louis region. \nBut for being Black, Don would have similarly offered Williams franchise opportunities in his \nhometown of St. Louis. \n747.  McDonald’s offered Williams a store in Indianapolis (“1610 E. Washington”) as \npart of a two-store deal. However, the second restaurant had very low volume and Williams \nturned it down. Williams was never offered new stores that were built in Indianapolis.  \n748.  Within a year of buying the store, the original owner/operator of 1610 E. \nWashington bought a McDonald’s restaurant down the street and installed a play area. Williams’ \nsales plummeted as a result.  \n749.  Williams asked for permission to sell the store and relocate many times but, \nwithout explanation, Regional Manager James Daughtry told him that he would not assist him or \nprovide a letter of recommendation. White owner-operators were selling their restaurants in the \nregion and relocating without issue. But for his race, Daughtry would have allowed Williams to \ndo the same. \n750.  Ultimately, McDonald’s allowed him to sell the store and leave the region, but \nWilliams only received $50,000 for the store. \n141 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 142 of 158 PageID #:1929\n751.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, the Regional Manager of \nNorfolk, Virginia, reached out to Williams about an opportunity to buy two restaurants that were \nlocated in a dangerous area, which he initially turned down. The Regional Manager told him he \nwas offered these restaurants—all of them urban, high crime, and low volume—because of his \nexperience as an ex-corporate employee. In that capacity, he said Williams would be able to do \nbetter in these locations than another operator.  \n752.  Williams knew this was McDonald’s coded way of saying that because he was \nBlack, he would do best with a Black customer base and that he would not have been offered this \nundesirable location but for being Black. \n753.  Norman ultimately bought two different stores located in Norfolk. Though \nWilliams was initially satisfied with these stores, his rent payments grew dramatically, with \nrental payments increasing at a staggered rate from 9.5% to 12%. No white operator in the area \nhad a rent payment over 9%. \n754.  McDonald’s denied Williams financial assistance in the form of rent relief or rent \nrestructuring, routinely offered to white owner/operators, solely because he was Black. Williams \nasked McDonald’s to change his staggered rent to a flat rate. McDonald’s refused. By contrast, \nMcDonald’s had provided white owner/operators in the region, like Sue Derlack, meaningful \nfinancial assistance in similar circumstances. \n755.  The mall near Williams’s restaurant closed, which caused a dramatic decrease in \nWilliams’s sales. Even so, McDonald’s continued to refuse to provide any rent relief.  \n756.  Williams’ other restaurant (“Norfolk State” or “NS”) was also located in a high \ncrime area, was in poor condition, and its rent fluctuated between 10–14%.  \n142 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 143 of 158 PageID #:1930\n757.  It became apparent that McDonald’s was aware how undesirable the stores it had \noffered Williams were. One of Williams’s friends asked Regional Manager Steve Plackton if \nWilliams had good stores, to which he responded “no” and that Williams had “dogs.” \nMcDonald’s was completely aware that it had discriminatorily placed Williams in unprofitable, \ndifficult locations. \n758.  Eventually, Williams was forced to sell his two low-performing stores. \nMcDonald’s told him that they would provide him opportunities to buy additional stores after he \nsold the two low-performing ones. McDonald’s never provided those opportunities.  \n759.  Around 2013, Williams approached Regional Manager Bill Garret for rent \nassistance. Garret asked him why he should lower his rent if he could just sell the store to \nsomeone who could pay full price. \n760.  When Williams’s store was up for rewrite, Field Operations Officer Barbara \nCalloway spent roughly five minutes in Williams’s restaurant before telling him that she was not \ngoing to recommend him for rewrite. Calloway had similarly forced out between three to five \nother Black owner/operators during her one- to two-year tenure at McDonald’s. \n761.  Around 2018, Williams received offers to buy his store, including an offer from \nformer Regional Manager Leon Dickey. However, Calloway and Harry Thomas, the new \nRegional Manager, pressured Williams to sell to another buyer. They knew Dickey had made a \nverbal offer but refused to approve the sale. \n762.  McDonald’s placed Williams in an untenable position of economic duress. \nWilliams had no choice but to sell the restaurant for $200,000 less than what Leon had offered \nhim due to McDonald’s interference. \n \n \n143 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 144 of 158 PageID #:1931\nJacqueline Wynn \n763.  Plaintiff Jacqueline Wynn formerly owned and operated McDonald’s stores in the \nAlabama and Atlanta Region. She is Black. \n764.  In May 1994, McDonald’s offered Wynn the opportunity to purchase a franchise \nstore in Roanoke, Alabama. Roanoke was still a heavily segregated town at the time. For \nexample, the local high school had banned interracial dating. \n765.  Wynn informed McDonald’s that she wanted to purchase a store in the Florida or \nAtlanta region but did not want to operate a store in Alabama. McDonald’s insisted that it was a \ngood opportunity because Roanoke did not have a McDonald’s. However, the town of Roanoke \ndid not want a McDonald’s, particularly one run by a Black woman. \n766.  During her time operating the Roanoke store, Wynn was the target of hate crimes, \nincluding individuals leaving Ku Klux Klan pamphlets at the store and property destruction. As a \nresult, Wynn requested a transfer to another franchise store outside of Alabama. \n767.  In keeping with McDonald’s discriminatory practice of intentionally placing \nBlack franchisees into substandard stores in Black neighborhoods, in 1995, McDonald’s \ntransferred Wynn to such a franchise location in Atlanta, Georgia. McDonald’s falsely informed \nWynn that the Atlanta store was fully operational and fully staffed. Wynn relied on that \nstatement in her decision to purchase the Atlanta location. \n768.  Upon arriving at the Atlanta store, Wynn noticed that the equipment was damaged \nand there was no full-time staff. Wynn soon learned that employee retention was low in part \nbecause of the surrounding area’s demographics. \n769.  Later on, Wynn was told that the Atlanta store was notoriously difficult to run and \nthat the last operator had suffered a heart attack from the stress of running the location. \nMcDonald’s transferred her there because they could not find another operator to run it and \n144 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 145 of 158 PageID #:1932\nwanted to wash their hands of the store. But for being Black, McDonald’s would not have placed \nWynn in such a difficult and unprofitable location. \n770.  From the start of Wynn’s tenure at the Atlanta store, she was flooded with \ninspections by McDonald’s field consultants. They gave her negative reviews because of her \nlimited staff and the condition of the store’s equipment. When she requested help from the field \nconsultants, they offered no support or resources for her. Instead, the business consultants \npunished Wynn for a problem that McDonald’s had created in failing to disclose the state of the \nequipment and staffing. As a result, Wynn took out loans to repair the equipment and bring on \nfull-time staff. \n771.  In 1999, Wynn acquired another franchise location in Gwinnett, Georgia \n(“Gwinnett”). McDonald’s made unreasonable demands of Wynn regarding that store as well. \nWhen they demanded that she install a particular type of equipment, Wynn responded that she \ndid not yet have the funds but would install the equipment as soon as she could afford it.  \n772.  After that, McDonald’s retaliated against Wynn and deployed their tactic of \nforcing Black operators out of the system by increasing their inspections of Wynn’s stores. For \nexample, a field consultant reported to the Regional Manager that the Gwinnett store was using \nout-of-state hamburger buns. Wynn had witnessed the inspection and knew that none of the buns \nwere out-of-state. Instead, field consultants manufactured issues to force Wynn out of the store.  \n773.  They succeeded and Wynn ended up selling the Gwinnett store in 2009 to \nPlaintiff Allen Stafford. In turn, McDonald’s threatened Stafford that he would not be able to \nexpand to other locations if he did not purchase Wynn’s store.  \n774.  McDonald’s enforced its renovation standards more stringently on Wynn, as \ncompared to white owner/operators, solely because of her race and in violation of the franchising \n145 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 146 of 158 PageID #:1933\nagreement. Throughout her time operating the Atlanta store, Wynn had to partially remodel the \nstore twice to meet the required standards. In 2010, McDonald’s went further and demanded that \nWynn fully renovate the Atlanta store, despite being in the height of the recession. By contrast, \nMcDonald’s did not require a white owner/operator, Patrick Dennis, in the same region to make \nany reinvestments to his restaurant. \n775.  Wynn asked McDonald’s to conduct a demographic study to evaluate the cost-\nbenefit ratio of the remodel. McDonald’s never completed the study. \n776.  Given McDonald’s lack of support, Wynn hired an independent firm to conduct a \ndemographic study. The research firm found that the entire area was “dead” in terms of \nrestaurant profits and did not project that the restaurant would turn a profit until 2014 if she \ncompleted the remodel. \n777.  Subsequently, Wynn informed McDonald’s about the study’s results, and told the \nfield consultant that it was not financially feasible to tear down the store when it was operating \nwell in its current state. \n778.  Shortly thereafter, McDonald’s sent Wynn a letter, asking her not to renew her \nlease on the store. Wynn tried negotiating with McDonald’s to renew her lease and even \nproposed that she could obtain a loan for the remodel, but McDonald’s refused to negotiate with \nher.   \n779.  McDonald’s hand-selected a purchaser of Wynn’s Atlanta store. Wynn did not \nreceive market value for the store, but Wynn felt that she had no choice but to sell it to \nMcDonald’s pick. Wynn therefore unwillingly sold her remaining franchise store.   \n \n \n \n146 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 147 of 158 PageID #:1934\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. § 1981—Race Discrimination in Contracting \n780.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n781.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a member of the class protected by this statute, in that \nPlaintiffs are all Black. \n782.  As described in greater detail above, Defendants intentionally discriminated \nagainst Plaintiffs on the basis of their race in their making, performance, modification and/or \ntermination of their franchisor/franchisee contractual relationship with Plaintiffs. In doing so, \nDefendants denied Plaintiffs the enjoyment of the benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of \nthis contractual relationship. \n783.  If it were not for Defendants’ intentional race discrimination, Plaintiffs would not \nhave suffered the harms discussed in this Complaint. \n784.  As described in greater detail above, Defendants intentionally discriminated \nagainst Plaintiffs on the basis of their race by engaging in misconduct such as: \na.  forcing Plaintiffs to franchise locations that were less profitable, located in lower-\nincome or higher-crime neighborhoods, and in poorer physical condition than the \nfranchise locations made available to white franchisees; \nb.  denying Plaintiffs access to profitable franchise locations that were made \navailable to white franchisees; \nc.  targeting Plaintiffs for unfair and unreasonable enforcement of their \nfranchisor/franchisee contracts, including unfair and unreasonable expectations \nand timeliness for physical improvements or renovations to their restaurants, in a \nmanner that was not reflected in Defendants’ franchisor/franchisee relationship \n147 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 148 of 158 PageID #:1935\nwith white franchisees; \nd.  targeting Plaintiffs for unfair and unreasonable inspections and grading of their \nrestaurants, in a manner that was not reflected in Defendants’ \nfranchisor/franchisee relationship with white franchisees; \ne.  denying Plaintiffs the benefit of programs and opportunities that were offered to \nwhite franchisees; and \nf.  denying Plaintiffs’ requests to sell their franchises to the buyer of their choosing \nat a favorable negotiated price, in a manner that was not reflected in Defendants’ \napproval decisions with respect to the sale of white-owned franchises. \n785.  As a result of Defendants’ misconduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs suffered \nand continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business opportunities, \ndirect and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, emotional injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other grievous and continuing \ninjuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT II \n42 U.S.C. § 1981—Race Discrimination in Contracting (Pattern or Practice) \n786.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n787.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a member of the class protected by this statute, in that \nPlaintiffs are all Black. \n788.  Defendants’ misconduct alleged in Count I, and as described in greater detail \nabove, was part of a pattern or practice of discriminatory decision-making, pursuant to which \nDefendants regularly and purposefully discriminated against Black franchisees. \n789.  This discriminatory pattern or practice was so pervasive that it amounted to the \nDefendants’ standard operating procedure with regard to their treatment of Black franchisees. \n148 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 149 of 158 PageID #:1936\nDefendants’ discriminatory pattern and practice includes, as alleged above: forcing Black \nfranchisees to locations that were less profitable than locations offered to white franchisees; \nunfairly applying standards to Black franchisees that Defendants did not apply to white \nfranchisees; and refusing to agree Black franchisees’ proposed sales of their stores and instead \nforcing Black franchisees to sell to Defendants’ preferred purchasers when Defendants did not \nimpose such conditions on white franchisees.  \n790.  As a result of Defendants’ misconduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs suffered \nand continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business opportunities, \ndirect and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, emotional injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other grievous and continuing \ninjuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT III \n42 U.S.C. § 1981—Race Discrimination in Contracting (Retaliation) \n791.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n792.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a member of the class protected by this statute, in that \nPlaintiffs are all Black. \n793.  As described in greater detail above, each of the Plaintiffs engaged in protected \nactivity by complaining to Defendants about their intentional race discrimination, including but \nnot limited to the categories of misconduct described in Count I. In particular, Defendants \nintentionally discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of their race in their making, \nperformance, modification and/or termination of their franchisor/franchisee contractual \nrelationship with Plaintiffs. In doing so, Defendants denied Plaintiffs the enjoyment of the \nbenefits, privileges, terms and conditions of this contractual relationship. \n149 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 150 of 158 PageID #:1937\n794.  As described in greater detail above, in retaliation for Plaintiffs’ protected \nactivity, Defendants intentionally and knowingly subjected Plaintiffs to adverse treatment in their \nfranchisor/franchisee relationship with Plaintiffs. But for Plaintiffs’ protected activity, \nDefendants would not have taken such acts against Plaintiffs.  \n795.  Defendants did not subject similarly situated franchisees who had not engaged in \nprotected activity to the same adverse treatment to which Defendants subjected Plaintiffs. This \nincludes white franchisees, who had no basis to complain about racially discriminatory \nmistreatment and so were not subjected to adverse treatment in retaliation for protected activity. \n796.  As a result of Defendants’ misconduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs suffered \nand continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business opportunities, \ndirect and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, emotional injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other grievous and continuing \ninjuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT IV \n42 U.S.C. § 1982—Discrimination in the Leasing of Real Property \n797.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n798.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a member of the class protected by this statute, in that \nPlaintiffs are all Black. \n799.  As described in greater detail above, Defendants intentionally discriminated \nagainst Plaintiffs on the basis of their race in the leasing of real property, including but not \nlimited to: Defendants refused to lease favorable, more profitable restaurant locations to \nPlaintiffs which Defendants made available to white franchisees; Defendants forced Plaintiffs to \nless profitable, lower quality restaurant locations; and Defendants unfairly and unreasonably \n150 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 151 of 158 PageID #:1938\ndenied Plaintiffs’ requests to sell their franchises and transfer their interest in real property to the \nbuyers of their choosing at a favorable negotiated price. \n800.  If it were not for Defendants’ intentional race discrimination, Plaintiffs would not \nhave suffered the harms discussed in this Complaint. \n801.  As a result of Defendants’ misconduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs suffered \nand continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business opportunities, \ndirect and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, emotional injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other grievous and continuing \ninjuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT V \n42 U.S.C. § 1982—Discrimination in the Leasing of Real Property (Pattern or Practice) \n802.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n803.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a member of the class protected by this statute, in that \nPlaintiffs are all Black. \n804.  Defendants’ misconduct alleged in Count IV, and as described in greater detail \nabove, was part of a pattern or practice of discriminatory decision-making, pursuant to which \nDefendants regularly and purposefully discriminated against Black franchisees. \n805.  This discriminatory pattern or practice was so pervasive that it amounted to the \nDefendants’ standard operating procedure with regard to their treatment of Black franchisees. \nDefendants’ discriminatory pattern and practice includes, as alleged above: forcing Black \nfranchisees to locations that were less profitable than locations offered to white franchisees; \nrefusing to allow Black franchisees to lease locations that were more profitable and only \nproviding white franchisees the opportunity to lease such locations; and refusing to agree Black \nfranchisees’ proposed sales of their stores and instead forcing Black franchisees to sell to \n151 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 152 of 158 PageID #:1939\nDefendants’ preferred purchasers when Defendants did not impose such conditions on white \nfranchisees.  \n806.  As a result of Defendants’ misconduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs suffered \nand continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business opportunities, \ndirect and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, emotional injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other grievous and continuing \ninjuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT VI \n42 U.S.C. § 1982—Discrimination in the Leasing of Real Property (Retaliation) \n807.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n808.  Each of the Plaintiffs is a member of the class protected by this statute, in that \nPlaintiffs are all Black. \n809.  As described in greater detail above, each of the Plaintiffs engaged in a protected \nactivity by complaining to Defendants about their intentional race discrimination, including but \nnot limited to the categories of misconduct described in Count IV. In particular, Defendants \nintentionally discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of their race in the leasing of real \nproperty, including but not limited to: Defendants refused to lease favorable, more profitable \nrestaurant locations to Plaintiffs which Defendants made available to white franchisees; \nDefendants forced Plaintiffs to less profitable, lower quality restaurant locations; and Defendants \nunfairly and unreasonably denied Plaintiffs’ requests to sell their franchises and transfer their \ninterest in real property to the buyers of their choosing at a favorable negotiated price. \n810.  As described in greater detail above, in retaliation for Plaintiffs’ protected \nactivity, Defendants intentionally and knowingly subjected Plaintiffs to adverse treatment in their \n152 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 153 of 158 PageID #:1940\nfranchisor/franchisee relationship with Plaintiffs. But for Plaintiffs’ protected activity, \nDefendants would not have taken such acts against Plaintiffs.  \n811.  Defendants did not subject similarly situated franchisees who had not engaged in \nprotected activity to the same adverse treatment to which Defendants subjected Plaintiffs. This \nincludes white franchisees, who had no basis to complain about racially discriminatory \nmistreatment and so who were not subjected to adverse treatment in retaliation for protected \nactivity. \n812.  As a result of Defendants’ misconduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs suffered \nand continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business opportunities, \ndirect and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, emotional injuries \nresulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other grievous and continuing \ninjuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT VII \nIllinois State Law—Breach of Contract \n813.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n814.  Each of the Plaintiffs had a valid and enforceable written contract with \nDefendants. \n815.  Plaintiffs performed their obligations under the contract. \n816.  As described in greater detail above, Defendants breached the contract by failing \nto perform their obligations under the contract. \n817.  As described in greater detail above, among the contractual obligations that \nDefendants breached was their obligation to make available to Plaintiffs the same services, \nfacilities, rights, and privileges with respect to their operation of McDonald’s franchises as \nDefendants made generally available to other franchisees, specifically white franchisees. Section \n153 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 154 of 158 PageID #:1941\n3 of the Franchise Agreement provides that McDonald’s must “make available to Franchisee all \nadditional services, facilities, rights, and privileges relating to the operation of the Restaurant \nwhich McDonald’s makes generally available, from time to time, to all its franchisees operating \nMcDonald’s restaurants.” (Franchise Agreement ¶ 3) (emphasis added). McDonald’s breached \nthis obligation by, among other things: not providing Plaintiffs the rent relief and other financial \nassistance Defendants provided to white franchisees; conducting reviews of Plaintiffs’ \nrestaurants at unreasonable times and under unreasonable circumstances that Defendants did not \nimpose on white franchisees; prohibiting Plaintiffs from obtaining loans when McDonald’s \nallowed such loans to white franchisees; and not providing Plaintiffs notice or relief from the \nopening of other McDonald’s locations near Plaintiffs’ stores when McDonald’s provided such \nnotice and relief to white franchisees.  \n818.  In addition, Defendants agreed to conduct reviews of Plaintiffs’ restaurants only \nat “reasonable times to ensure that [the] Franchisee’s operation” complied with McDonald’s \nstandards and policies. (Franchise Agreement ¶ 12) (emphasis added). Defendants breached this \nobligation by conducting reviews of Plaintiffs’ restaurants at unreasonable times and under \nunreasonable circumstances.  \n819.  Further, Defendants agreed that they would only require Plaintiffs to renovate \ntheir stores when Defendants’ plans and standards are “reasonably changed from time to time by \nMcDonald’s.” (Franchise Agreement ¶ 12) (emphasis added). Defendants breached this \nobligation by forcing Plaintiffs to renovate their stores when Defendants’ plans and standards \nhad not change or had not reasonably changed.  \n820.  Further, Defendants’ agreed that “consent shall not be arbitrarily withheld” when \nPlaintiffs attempted to sell their stored. Franchise Agreement § 15(d). Defendants breached this \n154 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 155 of 158 PageID #:1942\nobligation when they arbitrarily refused to accept the terms of sale proposed by Plaintiffs when \nthey attempted to sell their stores, and when Defendants insisted that Plaintiffs sell their stores to \nbuyers hand-picked by Defendants.  \n821.  As a result of Defendants’ breach of contract described in this Count, Plaintiffs \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business \nopportunities, direct and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, \nemotional injuries resulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other \ngrievous and continuing injuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT VIII \nIllinois State Law—Fraud \n822.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n823.  As described in greater detail above, Defendants knowingly made one or more \nfalse statements of material fact to Plaintiffs, including but not limited to regarding the \navailability of franchise locations, the past, present or reasonably anticipated future performance \nor profitability of franchise locations, the physical conditions of franchise locations, and the \ngeneral availability or lack of general availability of various services, facilities, rights, and \nprivileges that were available to other franchisees. \n824.  As described in greater detail above, in knowingly making these false statements \nof fact, Defendants intended to induce Plaintiffs to act or fail to act. \n825.  As described in greater detail above, Plaintiffs relied on Defendants’ false \nstatements of material fact, including but not limited to: in making the decision to enter into the \nfranchisor/franchisee contractual relationship, in selecting or accepting franchise locations, in \nseeking or applying for various services, facilities, rights, and privileges that were available to \n155 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 156 of 158 PageID #:1943\nother franchisees, and in making countless other strategic business decisions in the purchase, \noperation, and sale of their franchises. \n826.  As a result of Defendants’ fraudulent conduct described in this Count, Plaintiffs \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business \nopportunities, direct and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, \nemotional injuries resulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other \ngrievous and continuing injuries and damages as set forth above. \nCOUNT IX \nIllinois State Law—Tortious Interference with Business Relationships \n827.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n828.  As described in greater detail above, as a result of their status as McDonald’s \nfranchisees, Plaintiffs had valid business relationships with one or more individuals or entities, \nincluding but not limited to business loans or financing provided by financial institutions or \ninvestors. \n829.  Defendants had knowledge of these business relationships. \n830.  As described in greater detail above, Defendants, without any justification, \nintentionally interfered with these business relationships, including but not limited to through \ntheir racially discriminatory conduct and breach of contract alleged in the Counts above. \n831.  As a result of Defendants’ interference with business relationships described in \nthis Count, Plaintiffs suffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost \nprofits, lost business opportunities, direct and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to \nprofessional reputation, emotional injuries resulting from Defendants’ intentional racial \ndiscrimination, and other grievous and continuing injuries and damages as set forth above. \n \n156 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 157 of 158 PageID #:1944\nCOUNT X \nIllinois State Law—Unjust Enrichment \n832.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully restated here. \n833.  As described in greater detail above, through its fraudulent misrepresentations \nabout the future financial viability of the substandard franchise locations made available to Black \nfranchisees, through its unreasonably stringent and frequent restaurant inspections, and through \nits unrelenting insistence that Plaintiffs make reinvestments in their restaurant locations to meet \nMcDonald’s ever evolving list of strict building and equipment requirements, McDonald’s \ninduced Plaintiffs to make substantial repairs, renovations, and other improvements to their \nrestaurants.  \n834.  Since the land and buildings at all McDonald’s locations are ultimately owned by \nMcDonald’s, and are only temporarily leased to owner/operators, McDonald’s obtained a \nsignificant benefit from these improvements made by Plaintiffs, in the form of increased value to \nthe restaurant properties. \n835.  As described in greater detail above, in doing so, McDonald’s unjustly retained a \nbenefit to Plaintiffs’ detriment, and that retention violates the fundamental principles of justice, \nequity, and good conscience. \n836.  As a result of Defendants’ unjust enrichment described in this Count, Plaintiffs \nsuffered and continue to suffer damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost business \nopportunities, direct and indirect financial loss and harm, damage to professional reputation, \nemotional injuries resulting from Defendants’ intentional racial discrimination, and other \ngrievous and continuing injuries and damages as set forth above. \n*  *  * \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter judgment in their \n157 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 78 Filed: 12/16/22 Page 158 of 158 PageID #:1945\nfavor and against Defendants, awarding compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney’s \nfees, and any other relief this Court deems just and appropriate. \nJury Demand \nPlaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n38(b)  on all issues so triable. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED: \nKENNETH MANNING, ET AL. \nBy: /s/Jon Loevy \nJon Loevy \nRoshna Bala Keen \nDaniel M.

Plaintiffs are Black, former McDonald’s franchisees, who bought into McDonald’s \npublic commitment to the Black communities it serves only to be misled and denied equal opportunity \nto economic success by McDonald’s systematic and covert racial discrimination.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 5 of 67 PageID #:868\n2.  Plaintiffs entered the McDonald’s franchise system with the expectation that it would \nopen the door to opportunities to develop thriving businesses to pass on to their children.   \n3.  Plaintiffs were more than McDonald’s franchisees; they were employers and pillars in \ntheir communities.  In many cases, they became parental figures providing the safety and security \noften lacking in the depressed, crime-ridden neighborhoods that McDonald’s steered them to.  \n4.  For more than 50 years, McDonald’s has branded itself as a socially conscious \ncompany, committed to strengthening Black entrepreneurship, and embracing racial opportunity as a \ncritical component of its corporate culture.   \n5.  On June 16, 2020, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Kempczinski, \nappeared on CNBC’s “Mad Money with Jim Cramer” and stated that, “McDonald’s has created more \nmillionaires within the Black community than probably any other corporation on the planet.”   \n6.  In response to the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, \nMcDonald’s  proclaimed,  “We  do  not  tolerate  inequity,  injustice,  or  racism.”    McDonald’s \nadvertisements read, “They were all one of us.  We see them in our customers.  We see them in our \ncrew members.  We see them in our franchisees.  And this is why the entire McDonald’s family \ngrieves.  It’s why we stand for them and any other victims of systematic oppression and violence.” \n7.  As recently as McDonald Corporation’s Verified Complaint against its former CEO, \nStephen J. Easterbrook, McDonald’s continues to falsely represent a corporate commitment to \nequality:  “Today, [McDonald’s] continues its efforts to cultivate a safe, nondiscriminatory, and \nrespectful workplace, including most recently through a renewed values statement that makes clear \nMcDonald’s commitment to operating its business with integrity and creating equal opportunities.”  \nMcDonald’s Corporation v. Easterbrook, Case Id. 2020-0658, Verified Compl. [D.E. 1], at ⁋ 34 (Del. \nCh. Aug. 10, 2020) (emphasis added).  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 6 of 67 PageID #:869\n8.  These statements are patently false and highlight the dichotomy between McDonald’s \ncorporate  ethos  as  a  recruiter  and  developer  of  Black  entrepreneurs  and  its  record  on  race:  \nMcDonald’s has a decades-long history of racial discrimination against its own Black franchisees.  \n9.  McDonald’s  proclaims  a  commitment  to  racial  equality,  profits  from  its  Black \ncustomers, yet places Black franchisees in locations that are destined to fail, with low-volume sales \nand high operating costs, leading to consistent profit shortfalls or losses, impeding Black franchisees’ \nefforts to grow as they acquire other stores, necessary for success under McDonald’s own franchise \nmodel, to force Black franchisees out, repeating this pattern of misconduct over and over again. \n10.  McDonald’s racial discrimination has resulted in an increasing cash flow gap between \nMcDonald’s Black franchisees as compared to White ones.  This cash flow gap more than tripled \nfrom 2010 to 2019, per National Black McDonald’s Operators Association (“NBMOA”) data.  \n11.  Plaintiffs’  average  annual  sales  of  $2  million  was  more  than  $700,000  under \nMcDonald’s national average of $2.7 million between 2011 and 2016, and $2.9 million in 2019. \n12.  As a result, the historic high of approximately 400 Black McDonald’s franchisees in \n1998 has been more than cut in half.  Today, there are less than 200 Black franchisees.  See Figure \n1 below, based on NBMOA and McDonald’s data. \n13.  At the same time, from 1998 to date, the total number of McDonald’s franchised \nrestaurants more than doubled.  See Figure 2 below, based on data from McDonald’s Corporation.   \n14.  These differences are statistically significant and are the result of Defendants’ racial \nbias and barriers within the McDonald’s franchise system, effectuated by Defendants through \nsystematic and covert racial discrimination targeted against Black franchisees. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 7 of 67 PageID #:870\n \nFigure 1:  Number of Black McDonald’s Franchisees \n \n \nFigure 2: Number of McDonald’s Franchised Restaurants \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 8 of 67 PageID #:871\n15.  McDonald’s definition of success is a one-way street:  as long as McDonald’s is paid \nits rent, service fees, related vendor expenses, and renovation loans with McDonald’s approved \nbanks, the franchisee is a “success” by McDonald’s standards, regardless of the fact that the \nindividual franchisee has not earned a single dollar of profit for him or herself.   \n16.  On the other hand, an individual franchisee’s definition of success is entirely different:  \non average, a successful McDonald’s franchisee makes $400,000 to $500,000 of profit per year, \nwhereas Black McDonald’s franchisees were put in locations that had no chance of generating profits \nfor Black franchisees that even come close to that level of success. \n17.  Knowing  that  Black  franchisees  historically  had  very  limited  access  to  the \nMcDonald’s system and would take what they could get, McDonald’s systematically kept Black \nfranchisees  in  underperforming  locations  with  low  revenues  and  high  expenses  where  White \nfranchisees refused to own and operate restaurants.  By steering and restricting Black franchisees \ngrowth beyond predominantly Black neighborhoods because of their race, McDonald’s increased its \nown success at the expense of Black franchisees who had little to no success individually. \n18.  Black franchisees go in and out of locations with consistent profit shortfalls, on land \nand buildings owned by McDonald’s, operated by Black franchisees to better target Black consumers, \nwith improvements paid for by Black franchisees, maximizing McDonald’s profits, while White \nfranchisees are offered newer, safer, and more profitable locations.   \n19.  But for their race, Black franchisees, and more specifically, the Plaintiffs, would have \nbeen given the opportunity to successfully operate newer, safer, and more profitable restaurants like \nWhite McDonald’s franchisees.   \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 9 of 67 PageID #:872\n20.  McDonald’s  knowingly  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs,  Black  franchisees,  a \nprotected class under federal law (42 U.S.C. §1981), who were parties to franchise agreements with \nMcDonald’s, by, including, but not limited to:  \na.  Steering Plaintiffs to, and restricting growth beyond, substandard locations \nwith low-volume sales and higher operating costs, such as higher security costs \ndue to crime, higher insurance rates, and higher employee turnover, because \nof their race; \n \nb.  Excluding Plaintiffs from the purchase of restaurants in the open market \nthroughout their franchise terms because of their race; \n \nc.  Providing Plaintiffs with misleading financial information to induce them to \npurchase McDonald’s least desirable franchises and fraudulently concealing \ninformation to restrict Plaintiffs’ growth into more profitable locations;  \n \nd.  Requiring Plaintiffs to invest in rebuilds and/or renovations within short time \nframes not required of White franchisees in locations McDonald’s knew would \nfail to generate an adequate return on Plaintiffs’ individual investments;  \n \ne.  Excluding Plaintiffs from the same growth opportunities to higher-volume, \nlower-cost stores offered to White franchisees;   \n \nf.  Failing to provide any legitimate business reasons for repeated denials of \nfranchise opportunities to Plaintiffs over many years; \n \ng.  Denying Plaintiffs meaningful support to allow them to overcome financial \nhardships, while White franchisees were routinely provided such assistance, \nincluding, but not limited to, permanent rent relief and impact funding;  \n \nh.  Depriving  Plaintiffs  of  the  same  legacy  opportunities  offered  to  White \nfranchisees through McDonald’s Next Generation (“Next Gen”) program; \n \ni.  Retaliation against Plaintiffs for rejecting offers to continue operations in \ncrime-ridden  neighborhoods  with  low-volume  sales,  including  through \ntargeted, increased, and unreasonable inspections;  \n \nj.  Unreasonable and unequal inspections and grading of Plaintiffs’ restaurants to \ngenerate  bad  business  reviews  as  pretext  to  force  Plaintiffs  out  of  the \nMcDonald’s system because of their race; and/or \n \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 10 of 67 PageID #:873\nk.  Placing Plaintiffs in untenable positions of economic duress, denying them \neligibility for growth and renewal of their agreements, and arbitrarily denying \nfinal approval of their buyers, so that Plaintiffs had no choice but to exit on \nMcDonald’s terms, at a loss. \n \n21.  Through these series of repeated and interrelated events, McDonald’s intentionally \nand covertly deprived Plaintiffs of the same rights enjoyed by White franchisees to the creation, \nperformance, enjoyment, and all benefits of their contractual relationships with Defendants. \n22.  McDonald’s fraudulently claimed to have remedied their discriminatory practices in \nthe 1990s, through a campaign of misinformation, non-binding parity deals, and empty promises.   \n23.  As of 1998, and thereafter, Plaintiffs were led to believe that McDonald’s history of \ndiscrimination was in the past.  Plaintiffs all operated under the assumption of parity and fair dealing \nby  McDonald’s.    Through  McDonald’s  control  of  information  as  the  franchisor,  and  public \ncommitment to racial equality, Plaintiffs were unaware, and could not know or have learned through \ndue diligence, that McDonald’s would deprive them of franchise opportunities offered to White \nfranchisees.   \n24.  After 1998, during the period of “parity,” when Plaintiffs encountered operational \ndifficulties, they were systematically isolated and led to believe that they were “bad operators” and \nindividually responsible for the excessive operational expenses, insufficient sales volume, lost profits, \nlost business opportunities, and damage to their professional reputations. \n25.  McDonald’s discriminatory and fraudulent practices were not apparent to Plaintiffs \nwhen committed, and only became apparent when viewed in light of the later acts establishing a \npattern of systematic and covert racial discrimination targeted against Black franchisees, which \nbecame public through the January 7, 2020, filing of a racial discrimination lawsuit by Black \nMcDonald’s  senior  executives,  Victoria  Guster-Hines  and  Domineca  Neal.    Guster-Hines  v. \nMcDonald’s USA LLC, No. 20-00117, Compl. [D.E. 1] (N.D. Ill. Jan. 1, 2020).   \n7 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 11 of 67 PageID #:874\n26.  Through the Guster-Hines and Neal Complaint, Plaintiffs discovered inside corporate \ninformation for the first time that revealed that their franchise terminations by McDonald’s were \npart of a renewed practice of covert and systemic discrimination against Black franchisees post-parity \nat the executive level. \n27.  Plaintiffs learned that they were not in fact “bad operators,” who mismanaged their \nrestaurants,  as  McDonald’s  led  them  to  believe,  but  rather  that  McDonald’s  own  executives \nrecognized  that  the  company  deliberately  divested  opportunities  from  Black  franchisees, \nimplemented business plans with a discriminatory impact on Black franchisees, made exceptions for \nWhite Next Generation candidates it did not make for Black candidates, graded Black Consumer \nMarket stores “differently, in a negative way,” and overall abandoned its commitment to racial \nequality on a company-wide basis:  “McDonald’s continuing pattern and practice of intentional race \ndiscrimination [] should outrage everyone, especially those who grew up going to McDonald’s and \nbelieving the ‘Golden Arches’ were swell.”  (Compl., at ¶¶ 1, 65, 75). \n28.  After the  public filing, Plaintiffs began to exchange information and  engage in \ndiscussions  with  other  former  McDonald’s  franchisees  after  years  of  intentional  isolation  by \nMcDonald’s only to realize that they each suffered the same series of ongoing denials of franchise \nopportunities by McDonald’s, post-parity, despite operating in different domestic locations and \nbackgrounds, because they have one thing in common:  they are Black.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n29.  This is an action based on McDonald’s denial of Plaintiffs’ right to equality in their \ncontracts in violation of Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended by the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), and fraudulent inducement \nand omission (Count III). \n8 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 12 of 67 PageID #:875\n30.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332, 1343(a)(3), and 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  \n31.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state-law claims pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1367 because they are so related to Plaintiffs’ federal question claims that they form part \nof the same case or controversy.  \n32.  Plaintiffs’ claims are properly joined under the permissive joinder provisions of Rule \n20, Fed. R. Civ. P., as their claims arise out of the same series of transactions or occurrences and raise \ncommon questions of law or fact.  \n33.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants  because  McDonald’s \nCorporation is headquartered in this District and McDonald’s USA maintains its principal place of \nbusiness in Chicago, Illinois.   \n34.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Defendants \nreside in this District, where its principal place of business is located, and a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in Chicago, Illinois, which is within this District.  \nTHE PARTIES \nA.

As a result of Defendants’ racial discrimination, breach of contract, and fraud alleged \nherein, each of the individual Plaintiffs named above have been subjected to the same pattern and \npractice of discrimination and suffered substantial damages in the forms described below and \namounts that will be proven at trial.   \n99.  At all times material, McDonald’s led Plaintiffs to believe that they wanted all \nfranchisees to succeed, were committed to racial equality, and, as such, any losses they suffered were \nbecause they were “bad operators” and/or “mismanaged” their organizations.   \n100.  As a result of Defendants’ affirmative misrepresentations and omissions, systematic \nisolation of Plaintiffs throughout their franchise terms, and control of vital information bearing on \nPlaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs were unaware, and could not have reasonably known or have learned \nthrough the exercise of due diligence, the true nature and extent of McDonald’s systematic and covert \nracial discrimination.   \n101.  By agreement with Defendants, who were previously provided by Plaintiffs earlier \nthis year with a draft complaint, as of June 8, 2020 all viable statutes of limitation applicable to \nPlaintiffs’ claims were tolled. \nB.  Defendants \n102.  Defendant McDonald’s USA is a Delaware limited liability corporation with its \nprincipal place of business located at 110 North Carpenter Street, Chicago, Illinois.  McDonald’s \nUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of McDonald’s Corporation and the franchisor of the McDonald’s \nfranchise system, which develops, operates, franchises, and services a system of fast-food restaurants \nin the United States.  \n103.  Defendant McDonald’s Corporation is a publicly traded Delaware corporation with its \nprincipal place of business located at One McDonald’s Plaza, Oak Brook, Illinois.  McDonald’s \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 25 of 67 PageID #:888\nCorporation is the sole member of McDonald’s USA, and is the worldwide franchisor of the \nMcDonald’s franchise system.   \nCOMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n104.  McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs what, at first, appeared to be a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to invest in and become a part of America’s best-known international corporation.   \n105.  Yet, by covertly restricting and steering Plaintiffs to older and underperforming store \nlocations because of their race, misleading financial representations and omissions, exclusion from \ngrowth opportunities, unequal and unreasonable renovation and rebuild requirements, and application \nof harsher and unreasonable grading and inspection standards, McDonald’s intentionally impeded \nPlaintiffs’ ability to succeed and grow within the franchise they dedicated their lives to.   \nA.  The McDonald’s Franchise Model:  Unequal Bargaining Power, The Franchise \nAgreement, and Misleading Franchise Disclosure Documents \n \n106.  McDonald’s  is  a  heavily  franchised  business  model.    As  of  May  1,  2020, \napproximately 95% of all U.S. restaurants are franchised to independent franchisees and about 5% \nare franchised to company-owned McDonald’s (“McOpCo”) restaurants.   \n107.  By franchising nearly 100% of its restaurants, McDonald’s has grown to become one \nof  the  largest  commercial  real  estate  owners  in  the  world:    McDonald’s  owns  and  controls \napproximately 55% of the land and 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets.  \nOn  the  other  hand,  Plaintiffs,  as  former  franchisees,  never  owned  any  land  or  buildings  in \nconsolidated markets.  \n108.  In  2019,  revenues  for  McDonald’s  Corporation  totaled  $21.1  billion,  returning \napproximately  $8.6  billion  to  shareholders  through  a  combination  of  shares  repurchased  and \ndividends paid at year-end 2019.  McDonald’s revenues consist of rents, royalties, and initial \nfranchise fees.  Franchisees’ sales are not recorded as revenues of McDonald’s Corporation.  \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 26 of 67 PageID #:889\n109.  Under this business model, McDonald’s obtains new capital as well as enormous \nprofits from its franchisees, with little to no investment of its own.  By using franchisees to acquire \nland and to build restaurants, McDonald’s creates captive tenants out of its franchisees.   \n110.  As captive tenants, Plaintiffs were charged unreasonably high rent and service fees \nover long lease terms. \n(i)  The Franchise Agreement  \n111.  The decision to offer any franchise opportunity is within McDonald’s sole discretion \nfrom the point of initial entry into the McDonald’s franchise system and throughout the franchise \nrelationship. \n112.  According  to  “Your  Path  to  Becoming  a  McDonald’s  Franchisee,”  prospective \nfranchisees can only enter the Franchisee Training Program if they meet the following requirements: \na.  Ability to invest a minimum of $500,000 in non-borrowed personal funds; \nb.  Divestiture of all existing business interests;  \nc.  Commitment to an extensive training program that can range from 12-18 \nmonths, with a minimum of 20 hours per week; and  \n \nd.  Relocation based on availability of restaurants. \n \nSee  McDonald’s  “Your  Path  to  becoming  a  McDonald’s  franchisee,”  at  p.  23, \nhttps://www.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/usa/nfl/documents/franchising/Your_Path_to_Becoming_\na_McDonalds_Franchisee.pdf.  \n113.  McDonald’s will not work with applicants “who desire a specific restaurant location \nor limited geographic area.”  See McDonald’s Franchising FAQ, https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-\nus/about-us/franchising/franchising-faq.html.  \n114.  McDonald’s requires every franchisee to sign its standard Franchise Agreement in \norder to operate one or more, new or existing, McDonald’s restaurants located on real estate owned \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 27 of 67 PageID #:890\nor leased by McDonald’s, and leased to the franchisee through an Operator’s Lease, incorporated as \nExhibit A to the Franchise Agreement (the “Lease”), for a twenty (20) year term.  Franchisees have \nabsolutely no right or option to renew after the initial 20-year Lease term.  Instead, in McDonald’s \nsole discretion, McDonald’s offers franchisees of its choice the opportunity to rewrite their Lease \nthree (3) years prior to expiration of the 20-year term.  This puts enormous pressure on franchisees, \nwhich McDonald’s used as leverage to extract unreasonable conditions from Plaintiffs throughout \ntheir franchise terms.  True and correct copies of McDonald’s USA’s standard Franchise Agreement \n(Traditional), A-1, and an exemplar of Plaintiff Dominique’s Franchise Agreement, A-2, are attached \nas  Composite  Exhibit  “A”  (together  with  the  Lease  and  Franchise  Disclosure  Document, \ncollectively referred to as the “Franchise Agreement”).1 \n115.  Under the Franchise Agreement, McDonald’s owns or leases the franchised premises, \nso that the franchisee is always the tenant.  Franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant \nusing the McDonald’s system through a license and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, \nthrough the Lease, which is coterminous with the Franchise Agreement.  Failure to renew therefore \nincludes eviction and loss of the franchisee’s business. \n116.  Franchisees pay initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new \nfranchise, as well as continuing rent and royalties to McDonald’s based upon a percent of sales with \nminimum rent payments.  This structure enables McDonald’s to generate significant and predictable \nlevels of cash flow. \n117.  Franchisees are responsible for all related occupancy costs, which include property \ntaxes, maintenance, structural repairs, and acquiring and maintaining insurance coverage upon taking \n \n1 McDonald’s has possession of Plaintiffs’ individual Franchise Agreements.  According to McDonald’s \nAnnual Report, McDonald’s Corporation is the franchisor of any Franchise Agreement entered into (and not \nlater amended or superseded) prior to approximately 2005, and McDonald’s USA is the franchisor of any \nFranchise Agreement entered into since approximately 2005. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 28 of 67 PageID #:891\npossession  of  the  restaurant,  which  name  McDonald’s  as  an  additional  insured.    (Franchise \nAgreement, Ex. A, at ¶¶ 12 & 17, and Lease, at Sections 2.06, 2.08, 4.02, 4.03, and 6.05). \n118.  McDonald’s  also  requires  franchisees  to  rebuild,  renovate,  and/or  make  major \nremodels at franchisees’ sole cost and expense.  (Lease, at Section 2.06).  McDonald’s owns the real \nestate with all improvements paid for by the franchisees.   \n119.  Through the Franchise Agreement, McDonald’s agrees in relevant part: \nGeneral Services of McDonald’s.  McDonald’s shall advise and consult \nwith Franchisee periodically in connection with the operation of the \nRestaurant and also, upon Franchisee’s request, at other reasonable \ntimes.  .  .McDonald’s  shall  also  make  available  to  Franchisee  all \nadditional services, facilities, rights, and privileges relating to the \noperation  of  the  Restaurant  which  McDonald’s  makes  generally \navailable,  from  time  to  time,  to  all  its  franchisees  operating \nMcDonald’s restaurants. \n \n(Franchise Agreement, Ex. A, at ¶ 3) (emphasis added).   \n120.  Pursuant to Section 12, titled “Compliance with Entire System,” McDonald’s and \nPlaintiffs further agreed to a reasonableness standard with respect to inspections and renovations as \nfollows:  \nMcDonald’s  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the  Restaurant  at  all \nreasonable times to ensure that Franchisee’s operation thereof is in \ncompliance with the standards and policies of the McDonald’s System.  \n \nFranchisee  shall  comply  with  the  entire  McDonald’s  System, \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: (c) Keep the Restaurant \nconstructed and equipped in accordance with the building blueprints \nand  equipment  layout  plans  that  are  standard  in  the  McDonald’s \nSystem or as such blueprints and plans may be reasonably changed \nfrom time to time by McDonald’s. \n \n(Id., at ¶ 12) (emphasis added). \n \n121.  Through McDonald’s  Franchise  Disclosure Document (“FDD”), incorporated by \nreference into the Franchise Agreement and an exemplar copy of which is attached as Exhibit “B” \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 29 of 67 PageID #:892\nhereto,2  McDonald’s  provides  “prospective  franchisees”3  with  “Financial  Performance \nRepresentations,” that include pro forma statements with the national average sales of domestic \ntraditional McDonald’s restaurants opened at least one (1) year prior.  For example, the most recent \n2020 FDD attached hereto provides, in pertinent part, as follows:  \nAll Domestic Traditional Restaurants  \n \nOf  the  approximately  12,032  domestic  traditional  McDonald’s \nrestaurants  opened  at  least  1  year  as  of  December  31,  2019, \napproximately 79% had annual sales volumes in excess of $2,300,000; \napproximately 70% had annual sales volumes in excess of $2,500,000; \nand  approximately  60%  had  annual  sales  volumes  in  excess  of \n$2,700,000.  The average annual sales volume of domestic traditional \nMcDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, \nwas $3,009,000 during 2019.  The highest and lowest annual sales \nvolume in 2019 for these domestic traditional McDonald’s restaurants \nwas $12,654,000 and $654,000, respectively.  The median annual sales \nvolume of domestic traditional McDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 \nyear as of December 31, 2019, was $2,910,000 during 2019. \n \nTraditional Franchised Restaurants \n \nOf  the  approximately  11,435  domestic  traditional  franchised \nMcDonald’s restaurants opened at least 1 year as of December 31, \n2019,  approximately  78%  had  annual  sales  volumes  in  excess  of \n$2,300,000; approximately 68% had annual sales volumes in excess of \n$2,500,000;  and  approximately  58%  had  annual  sales  volumes  in \nexcess of $2,700,000.  The average annual sales volume of domestic \ntraditional franchised McDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 year as of \nDecember 31, 2019, was $2,970,000 during 2019.  The highest and \nlowest annual sales volume in 2019 for these domestic traditional \nMcDonald’s restaurants was $12,654,000 and $654,000, respectively.  \nThe median annual sales volume of domestic traditional franchised \n \n2 By way of example, attached is the most recent version of McDonald’s FDD, issued May 1, 2020.  \nMcDonald’s issues its FDD annually and provides all prospective franchisees with the FDD prior to joining \nthe McDonald’s franchise system.  McDonald’s has possession of the individual disclosure documents it \nprovided to Plaintiffs.   \n3  A  “prospective  franchisee”  is  defined  by  the  Franchise  Rule  as  “any  person  (including  any  agent, \nrepresentative, or employee) who approaches or is approached by a franchise seller to discuss the possible \nestablishment of a franchise relationship.”  16 C.F.R. Part 436.  McDonald’s therefore provides financial \ndisclosure not only upon entry, but also throughout the franchise term for any additional purchases of a \nfranchise and/or in connection with a sale of a franchise.   \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 30 of 67 PageID #:893\nMcDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, \nwas $2,867,000 during 2019. \n \nTraditional Company Owned Restaurants  \n \nOf the approximately 597 domestic traditional McOpCo restaurants \nopened at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, approximately 99% \nhad annual sales volumes in excess of $2,300,000; approximately 98% \nhad annual sales volumes in excess of $2,500,000; and approximately \n95% had annual sales volumes in excess of $2,700,000.  The average \nannual sales volume of domestic traditional McOpCo restaurants open \nat least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, was $3,758,000 during 2019.  \nThe highest and lowest annual sales volume in 2019 for these domestic \ntraditional  McOpCo  restaurants  was  $8,182,000  and  $2,047,000, \nrespectively.  The median annual sales volume of domestic traditional \nMcOpCo restaurants open at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, was \n$3,629,000 during 2019. \n \n(FDD, Ex. B, at Item 19) (emphasis added).   \n122.  At all times material hereto, Plaintiffs’ average annual sales were more than $700,000 \nunder McDonald’s disclosed national averages of $2.7 million between 2011 and 2016, and $2.9 \nmillion in 2019.  \n123.  McDonald’s dictates uniformity of the operational structure and revenue expectations \nof  all  its  franchisees’  stores,  even  though  they  are  cognizant  that  Black-owned  and  operated \nMcDonald’s franchises generate significantly lower revenue and assume higher operational costs than \nthe national average due to the low-income and high-cost locations it steers its Black franchisees to.  \n124.  McDonald’s knew or should have known that these differential revenue and operating \ncosts of Black-operated franchises as compared to White-operated franchises are not random or due \nto poor management.  These differences are statistically significant and are the result of the historical \nracial bias and barriers built into the McDonald’s franchise system.   \n125.  Acquisition of a McDonald’s franchise under these conditions was nothing short of a \n“financial suicide mission.” \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 31 of 67 PageID #:894\n(ii)  The Cost to Operate a McDonald’s Franchise \n126.  To purchase a McDonald’s franchise, McDonald’s requires an initial down payment \nof 40% of the total cost for a new restaurant, or 25% of the total cost for an existing restaurant.  \nMcDonald’s website, Buying a Franchise, available at https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-\nus/franchising/acquiring-franchising.html.  Generally, McDonald’s requires a minimum of $500,000 \nof non-borrowed personal resources.  See n. 4.  The balance of the purchase price may be financed \nfor no more than seven (7) years.  Id. \n127.  Pursuant to McDonald’s 2020 FDD, McDonald’s estimates a franchisee’s Estimated \nInitial Investment to be between $1,314,500 to $2,306,500, which do not include ongoing percentage \nrate or service fees.   \n128.  Franchisees pay McDonald’s the following ongoing fees: \na.  Service fee:  A monthly fee based upon the restaurant’s sales performance (as \nof this filing date, a Service Fee of 4.0% of Gross Sales); and  \n \nb.  Rent:  A monthly base rent and pass thru rent, if applicable, plus percentage \nrent in amounts calculated as a percentage of monthly Gross Sales, and that \nmay  include  rent  escalations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  fixed-rent \nescalations,  escalations  based  on  an  inflation  index,  and  fair-value \nadjustments, with terms ranging from annually to every five (5) years.  \n \n(Franchise Agreement, Ex. A, at ¶¶ 8–9; FDD, Ex. B, at Items 5–7, and Ex. A, at pp. 11–12). \n \n129.  Gross Sales include all revenues from sales, excluding sales or use tax, and are \ncalculated based on the preceding month, and are defined in Paragraph 7 of the Franchise Agreement, \nin pertinent part, as “all revenues from sales of the Franchisee based upon all business conducted \nupon or from the Restaurant, …”  Gross Sales are used to determine McDonald’s service fee and \nmonthly rents, which are a percentage thereof.   \n130.  Gross sales at McDonald’s restaurants are almost exclusively based on location.    \n \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 32 of 67 PageID #:895\n(iii)  A Financial Suicide Mission:  The Cost to Operate a Black McDonald’s \nFranchise \n \n131.  Unequal bargaining power characterizes the relationship between franchisees and \nMcDonald’s and this bargaining disparity is even more palpable for Black applicants and operators \nlike Plaintiffs.    \n132.  This unequal bargaining position made it easy for McDonald’s to award Black \nfranchisees entering the system the oldest stores, in need of the most reinvestment, in tough and \ndepressed areas, that had been routinely rejected by White franchisees, many of which McDonald’s \nwanted to close, but needed someone to operate until McDonald’s could sell its real estate. \n133.  McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs locations with higher operating costs, such as security, \ninsurance, and employee training and turnover, and which required substantial renovations and \nrebuilds, as compared to White-owned franchises.   \n134.  McDonald’s discriminatory practices led to low cash flow and decreased equity for \nBlack owner/operators, forcing Black owner/operators, including Plaintiffs, into significant debt and, \nin many cases, bankruptcy. \n135.  According to documents from the NBMOA, this cash flow gap between Black and \nWhite McDonald’s franchisees more than tripled between 2010 and 2019.   \n136.  For McDonald’s, it was a win-win strategy to collect high rent and fees for substandard \nstores, built upon a history of discrimination it successfully executed for decades. \nB.  McDonald’s History of Discrimination Against Black Franchisees \n137.  The McDonald’s franchise system was established in 1955, but Black franchisees \nwere denied entry until 1968, following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  \n138.  In  the  wake  of  civil  unrest  and  heighted  racial  tension  in  the  United  States, \nMcDonald’s implemented “zebra” partnerships between silent, White investors and Black operators \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 33 of 67 PageID #:896\nin order to expand its real estate footprint into predominantly Black areas where White franchisees \ncould not safely operate.  \n139.  On December 21, 1968, Herman Petty opened his first restaurant in the inner-city of \nChicago, becoming the first Black Owner/Operator of a McDonald’s franchise.   \n(i)  Boycott in Cleveland 1969  \n140.  A boycott of McDonald’s in 1969 made headlines in Ohio and led to the first Black \nfranchisees in the McDonald’s system opening stores in depressed areas of Cleveland.   \n141.  In  a  January  25,  1970,  article  regarding  the  first  Black  owned  and  operated \nMcDonald’s franchise, the New York Times reported:  “Spokesman for Negro groups, who banded \ntogether to form Operation Black Unity have been demanding black ownership of four existing \nMcDonald’s units … All are in predominantly Negro areas.”  Cleveland Negro Wins a Franchise, \nN.Y. Times, Jan. 25, 1970, available at https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/25/archives/cleveland-\nnegro-wins-a-franchise-9month-controversy-over-restaurant.html (emphasis added).   \n142.  In 1972, the National Black McDonald’s Operators Association, also known as the \nNBMOA, was founded to help promote growth in the industry by Black owner/operators. \n143.  During  hearings  held  on  April  7  and  8,  1976,  before  the  United  States  Senate \nCommittee on Commerce regarding the Fairness in Franchising Act, Donald R. Conley, President of \nthe McDonald’s Operator’s Association, testified that McDonald’s primary  tool used to force \nfranchisees to sell prior to expiration of their agreements is their power over renewal of franchise \nagreements, entirely within McDonald’s control and discretion, allowing them to discriminate against \nfranchisees.  See U.S. Senate, Hearing of the Committee on Commerce, S. 2335 (1996), at pp. 381–\n397.   \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 34 of 67 PageID #:897\n144.  Mr.  Conley  testified  that  McDonald’s  inhibits  franchisees’  expansion,  while \nencroaching on their territories, with new McDonald’s restaurants that cut sales volume, thereby \ndepressing the resale value of the franchise at franchisee’s loss and McDonald’s gain.  Id.  He \nexplained that because McDonald’s franchise agreement has a restrictive covenant that prevents the \nfranchisee from owning any business other than his own McDonald’s operation, the franchisee is \nlocked into the McDonald’s store as his only business such that cutting the sales volume or \nprofitability of that one business by siphoning off sales to additional units is a process employed by \nMcDonald’s to devalue the business interest and drive the franchisee out of business.  Id. \n145.  In the same hearing, Vice President of McDonald’s Corporation is cited in an excerpt \nfrom the company’s in-house publication, “Insight,” as stating that pursuant to McDonald’s renewal \npolicy, being a good operator, having high sales volume, and/or being favorably regarding by \ncustomers does not entitle a franchisee to renewal.  Id. at 382.  According to McDonald’s, renewal \ncan be denied for other completely subjective evaluations “at the whim of management.”  Id. at 387. \n146.  Unfortunately, McDonald’s reinstituted these same discriminatory business practices \nthat existed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, after the monumental announcement of “parity” in the \n1990s. \n(ii)  Trouble Under the Golden Arches:  Black Franchisee Sues McDonald’s \nfor Racial Steering \n \n147.  By the 1980s, Black franchisees were operating in the McDonald’s franchise system, \nbut McDonald’s did not treat Black franchisees as equals to White franchisees.  \n148.  In 1983, Charles Griffis, a Black McDonald’s owner/operator in the Los Angeles \nmarket, filed a race discrimination countersuit against McDonald’s, alleging, among other things, that \nMcDonald’s systematically excluded Black franchisees from buying stores in White neighborhoods.  \n149.  In a March 12, 1984, New York Times article, Griffis detailed his experience: \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 35 of 67 PageID #:898\nMy stores are in hellholes, he said.  They get robbed once or twice a \nmonth, and I pay $20,000 a month in security services they don’t pay \nin good neighborhoods.  We had a murder in one and we still get the \nwindows smashed and the bathrooms vandalized.  I’ve upgraded my \nstores a lot and I don’t see why I shouldn’t have a shot at a store in \na good neighborhood. \n \nTamar Lewin, McDonald’s is Battling with Black Franchisee, N.Y.

In response to McDonald’s racial practices, and Griffis’ situation, the New York \nchapter of the NBMOA also wrote to McDonald’s New York Regional Vice President at the time to \nadvise that, “black McDonald’s owner-operators are primarily confined to ghetto areas and not \nallowed to expand as fast as their white counterparts.”  Id. (emphasis added). \nMCDONALD'S IS BATTLING WITH BLACK FRANCHISEE \n“Charles  Griffis  came  to  California  in \n1977 when he heard he might be able to \nbuy  a  McDonald’s  franchise  in  Santa \nBarbara… It turns out, though, that the \nstore was in Los Angeles on Santa Barbara \nStreet, right in the middle of the ghetto… \nIt was an old store in real bad shape.” \n“. . .[Rev. Jesse] Jackson wrote McDonald’s on behalf of his Operation PUS H to complain that blacks \n  felt they were ‘being subjected to a double standard’ in that they were confined to inner-city areas \nwith high maintenance and security costs, and were usually offered only recycled stores, which \n  are generally more expensive and less profitable than new ones. . .   \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 36 of 67 PageID #:899\n151.  As of the publication of the March 1984 article, there were 137 Black McDonald’s \noperators nationwide, with 267 restaurants, totaling approximately two (2) stores per Black operator, \nas compared to the average of five (5) stores per McDonald’s White operator.  Id. \n152.  Today,  McDonald’s  has  dwindled  down  to  a  similarly  low  number  of  Black \nfranchisees, following false promises of parity and a reverse course back to discrimination.    \n(iii)  McDonald’s Admits Racial Steering and Need for Parity \n \n153.  In the late 1990s, McDonald’s leadership admitted that McDonald’s excluded Black \nfranchisees from franchise opportunities afforded to White franchisees. \n154.  Specifically, through Executive Vice President, Thomas S. Dentice, McDonald’s \nadmitted, “[T]he company has placed many Black Franchisees in restaurants that have not \nallowed them to achieve the same level of economic success as their peers.”  A true and correct \ncopy of the April 18, 1996, Dentice Letter to NBMOA Chairman, Reggie Webb, is attached as \nExhibit “C” hereto, with excerpts quoted below (emphasis added).   \n  I am also highly frustrated that Black \nFranchisees  have been part of the \nMcDonald’s system for almost thirty \nyears  and  as  a  group  have  not \nachieved the same level of success as \nother franchisees that have the same \ntenure.  . . .  [F]or business reasons \nwe thought were valid at the time, \nthe  company  has  placed  many \nBlack Franchisees in restaurants \nthat  have  not  allowed  them  to \nachieve the same level of economic \nsuccess as their peers.   \n \nI am personally tired of this lack of \nprogress by my company.  I am tired \nof being the person that has to listen \nto your calls for help and not seeing \nprogress.    I  am  tired  of  making \nexcuse[s] for myself and others and I \nam tired of working my tail off to \nachieve our mutual goals and being \nconsidered the enemy.  \n  \n33 \n \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 37 of 67 PageID #:900\nThis process will be viewed for what it is; achieving parity for \nour Black Franchisees, not reaching a comfortable financial or \nfranchising solution for the company.   \n*** \nWe may disagree at times on the what’s and how’s as we move \nforward, but I know that we do not and will not disagree on what \nwe want to accomplish-----Parity. \n \n   \n \n155.  Yet, parity was never truly achieved.  McDonald’s spent the next decade instituting \naspirational and temporary measures and promising Black franchisees, including Plaintiffs, that it \nwas working to achieve parity between Black and White McDonald’s franchisees.  \n156.  Plaintiffs relied on these representations and had no reason to believe McDonald’s \nwas discriminating against them. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 38 of 67 PageID #:901\n157.  On  November  14,  2002,  NBMOA  leadership  addressed  McDonald’s  past \ndiscriminatory practices in a letter from NBMOA Chairman and CEO, Larry C. Tripplett, to NBMOA \nMembership, which described its negotiations with McDonald’s Leadership “to ensure that Parity is \nmet and maintained.”  See Nov. 14, 2002 Tripplett Letter, Exhibit “D” hereto, with excerpts below. \nFirst, let me remind you of what you \nalready  know.    We  are  “Free \nPeople.”    We  have  the  right  to \nexpect  not  to  be  discriminated \nagainst by anyone.  Discrimination \nis illegal in this Country.  We make \nsignificant  contributions  to  the \nMcDonald’s System every day.  In \nsome cases, these contributions are \nmade under very difficult dangerous \nenvironmental circumstances.  We \ndo so proudly and professionally as \nwe all desire the American Dream \nof successful Business Ownership.  \nWe  deserve  and  will  demand \nnothing less than equal treatment.  \nWe must continue to stand United \nand Strong.  We have nothing to \nfear.  \n \nAs  you  are  aware,  the  NBMOA \nExecutive Committee is in earnest \nnegotiations with the Leadership of \nMcDonald’s Corporation to ensure \nthat Parity is met and maintained.  \nWe  believe  that  each  and  every \nAfrican  American  Franchisee \nsho uld receive real assurances that \nwhen  Parity  is  met,  the \n  discriminatory practices of the past \nwill not reoccur.  \n \n158.  In 2006, after a decade of fighting for parity, Don Thompson became the first Black \nPresident of the Western Division of McDonald’s and went on to serve as the first Black President \nand CEO of McDonald’s from 2012 to 2015.   \n \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 39 of 67 PageID #:902\n(iv)  Change in McDonald’s Leadership in 2015:  Reverse Course for Black \nFranchisees \n \n159.  In 2015, Easterbrook replaced Thompson as McDonald’s President and CEO, and \nhand-picked Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s current CEO and then President of McDonald’s USA.   \n160.  Under  Easterbrook  and  Kempczinski’s  leadership,  McDonald’s  instituted \ndiscriminatory policies including, but not limited to, rejecting advertising budget modifications to \ntarget  Black  consumers,  denying  Black  franchisees  opportunities  for  growth,  confining  Black \nfranchisees to inner-city or urban areas with higher costs, denying Black franchisees’ requests for \nrent relief, and implementing initiatives such as the Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 (“BBV2020”) \nmodernization plan that negatively and disproportionately impacted Black franchisees, including \nPlaintiffs, in order to force them out the McDonald’s franchise system.  \n161.  These discriminatory practices and policies led to the cash flow gap between Black \nfranchisees in comparison to White franchisees tripling from 2010 to 2019, and a mass exodus of \nmore than half of McDonald’s Black franchisees from the McDonald’s franchise system, which is \ndisproportionate to the loss of White franchisees during the same time, according to NBMOA data.  \n162.  Because McDonald’s controls all data and messaging to its franchisees, including \nfrom the NBMOA, Plaintiffs continued to believe at all times material, including without limitation \nduring their franchise terms, that they were operating under the parity agreement and that McDonald’s \ncorporate practices were supportive of racial diversity and equal opportunities.   \n163.  It was not until the January 7, 2020, Guster-Hines and Neal Complaint against \nMcDonald’s for intentional racial discrimination that Plaintiffs learned of McDonald’s renewed \npattern and practice of covert and systemic discrimination against Black franchisees post-parity at the \ncorporate level.  Guster-Hines v. McDonald’s USA LLC, No. 20-00117, Compl. [D.E. 1] (N.D. Ill. \nJan. 1, 2020).  \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 40 of 67 PageID #:903\n164.  The same pervasive racial discrimination, disparate treatment, and substantial wealth \ngap for Black franchisees continues today under the leadership of Christopher Kempczinski.   \n(v)  McDonald’s Leadership is Once Again on Notice of Ongoing Disparate \nTreatment of Black Franchisees; Continues Making False Promises \n \n165.  On March 12, 2019, Tripplett, as Chairman and CEO of the NBMOA, notified \nMcDonald’s  USA  Division  Presidents,  Charlie  Strong  and  Mario  Barbosa,  of  McDonald’s \ndiscriminatory actions, in a letter which raised “serious concerns regarding the status of African \nAmerican Owners within McDonald’s Corporation.”  A copy of the March 12, 2019 Tripplett Letter \nto McDonald’s is attached as Exhibit “E” hereto.  Specifically, Tripplett advised McDonald’s \nleadership  that  “the  trajectory  of  the  treatment  of  African  American  Owners  is  moving \nbackwards.  Through no fault of our own we lag behind the general market in all measures.  This is \nreflected in the loss of sales to African American consumers.  We believe that the loss of sales is \nclosely correlated to how African Americans are treated within the Company.”  Id., at p. 1 \n(emphasis added). \n166.  Tripplett called for “urgent progress now,” given, “[t]he current state of affairs for \nAfrican American Owners [which] can only be described as hostile.”  Id., at p. 3.  The letter ended \nwith a strong call for action:  “[W]e need change now.”  Id.  (emphasis added).   \n167.  On  November  4,  2019,  following  Easterbrook’s  firing,  Tripplett  provided  an \n“Informational Update” to NBMOA Members, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit “F” hereto.  \nTripplett advised NBMOA members that McDonald’s current CEO, Kempczinski, and Joe Erlinger, \nPresident of McDonald’s USA, called him directly to assure him as follows:  “[Kempczinski] \nexpressed his plans to continue to work on our cash flow gaps as he and Steve Easterbrook agreed to \ndo at our convention in Houston,” and “[Erlinger] expressed his desire to work with the NBMOA in \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 41 of 67 PageID #:904\nachieving our initiatives.”  Id., at p. 1.  “We are cautiously optimistic,” Tripplett advised NBMOA \nmembers.  Id.   \n168.  Despite McDonald’s empty promises and assurances to the NBMOA, intended to \ninduce Black franchisees like Plaintiffs to operate its substandard stores, McDonald’s knowingly \ncontinued institutional, systemic, and covert racial discrimination against its Black franchisees. \nC.  “Big Mac Attack” on Black Owner/Operators:   \nMcDonald’s Intentional and Covert Racial Discrimination \n \n(i)  Take it or Leave it:  Steering to High-Cost and Low-Volume Locations \n169.  When  Plaintiffs  sought  entrance  into  the  McDonalds’s  franchise  system,  and \nthroughout their franchise terms, McDonald’s systematically steered Plaintiffs to stores in Black \nneighborhoods and restricted their growth to more profitable locations given to White franchisees.  \nThese neighborhoods were the tough areas, often filled with high-crime, patrons with little to no \nmeans to purchase significant meal tickets, leading to low-volume cash sales and high operating costs \nin the form of higher insurance rates, security costs, and employee turnover.   \n170.  McDonald’s offered White franchisees packages with no restraints, on better terms, \nand in better locations than Plaintiffs. \n171.  McDonald’s induced Plaintiffs into purchasing these substandard restaurants by, \namong other things, rushing Plaintiffs, and requiring same-day inspections.  McDonald’s told \nPlaintiffs that it could take months, if not years, to be offered another restaurant if they turned down \na site.  McDonald’s made Plaintiffs believe that these substandard locations were their only way in.  \n172.  For example, during Plaintiff Dominique’s Operator Approval meeting, McDonald’s \nrepresentatives told him they had a restaurant that they felt would be a “good fit” based on his \nbackground in law enforcement.  McDonald’s told Mr. Dominique that they needed an answer \n“ASAP” and asked him to fly down to Atlanta, Georgia that same day to inspect the location.  \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 42 of 67 PageID #:905\n173.  At the time, the restaurant was owned by another Black franchisee, Plaintiff Van Jakes.  \nThe restaurant was a non-traditional (no drive-through) site in Downtown Atlanta in a high-crime \narea and with a significant homeless population.  As Mr. Dominique later learned, McDonald’s then \nVice-President and General Manager, Debbie Stroud, forced Mr. Jakes out of this restaurant and was \nnow pushing it on to Mr. Dominique as part of McDonald’s fraudulent scheme and pattern of \ndiscrimination, continuing the same perpetual cycle of giving bad restaurants in bad neighborhoods \nto Black franchisees.   \n174.  Based on McDonald’s misrepresentations and omissions regarding the availability of \nstores, their locations, and future growth opportunities, Plaintiffs believed that if they did not take the \nstore(s) McDonald’s offered them, their chances of entering McDonald’s franchise system would be \nextremely limited.  Plaintiffs relied on McDonald’s representations because they believed that they \nhad equal access to locations within the McDonald’s franchise as Whites. \n175.  Unbeknownst  to  Plaintiffs,  McDonald’s  offered  Black  franchisees  historically \nunderperforming restaurants that White franchisees did not want to purchase and continued to deny \nthem  access  to  profitable  locations  throughout  their  franchise  terms.    Conversely,  and  upon \ninformation and belief, White franchisees were routinely given preferred locations and were able to \nbuy and sell restaurants without restriction, allowing them to prosper. \n176.  Through this process, McDonald’s covertly excluded Plaintiffs from the opportunity \nto purchase restaurants in the open market and deprived Plaintiffs of the ability to achieve the same \nlevel of economic success as White franchisees.   \n177.  What is more, Plaintiffs had to risk their own safety in these high-crime areas, often \ncontending with drug dealers selling controlled substances inside and outside the restaurant, vagrants \nhassling customers, multiple incidents of fights, and even a murder in the parking lot of the \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 43 of 67 PageID #:906\nCrawfords’ restaurant.  Plaintiffs were solely responsible for paying for required additional security \ncosts, including armed guards.   \n178.  Plaintiffs often had to carry licensed firearms for their personal security.  These \ndangerous environments made it difficult for Plaintiffs to attract and retain experienced managers and \nemployees. \n179.  Knowing  that  Black  franchisees  historically  had  very  limited  access  to  the \nMcDonald’s  system,  McDonald’s  intentionally  misled  Plaintiffs  by,  among  other  things:    (i) \nproviding Plaintiffs with financial representations that McDonald’s knew did not—and could not—\naccurately reflect the net revenues of the locations it steered Plaintiffs to; (ii) assurances that these \nrestaurants would be profitable if Plaintiffs made significant initial investments in rebuilds and/or \nrenovations, encouraging debt as part of a fraudulent scheme to force Plaintiffs into debt, bankruptcy, \nand/or economic duress, and more easily cycle them out of the system; and (iii) assurances that any \nlosses would be offset by growth opportunities to better locations, which was the key to any \nsuccessful McDonald’s franchise model.  \n180.  Even  after  Plaintiffs  entered  the  system  through  these  substandard  locations, \nMcDonald’s continued to deny Plaintiffs the opportunity to own and operate franchises in more \nprofitable locations, unless these more profitable locations were packaged with low-volume, high-\ncost locations.   \n181.  For example, when McDonald’s offered Plaintiff Mason entry into the McDonald’s \nsystem through restaurants within Walmart stores in the Raleigh/Durham Region, where White \nfranchisees did not want to purchase because they were historically underperforming, McDonald’s \nassured Mr. Mason that he would have opportunities for growth if he increased sales.  Yet, even after \nMr. Mason increased sales in his initial Walmart locations, with the expectation that he would be \n40 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 44 of 67 PageID #:907\ngiven an opportunity to purchase a traditional store, McDonald’s continued to offer Mr. Mason \nadditional Walmart locations and refused to approve him for any traditional stores, falsely telling him \nthat none were available, while instead approving them for sale to White franchisees. \n182.  Unbeknownst to Mr. Mason, Marty Ranft, a former QSC VP of the McDonald’s \nRaleigh/Durham Region, was known by McDonald’s to have made derogatory and racist comments \nabout Black McDonald’s employees and franchisees.  According to senior executives, Guster-Hines \nand Neal, as revealed through their January 2020 public filing, Mr. Ranft told McDonald’s senior \nexecutive, Vicki Guster-Hines, and another Black executive, that “90%” of what the black franchisees \nhad to say about their experiences at McDonald’s was a “goddamn lie,” and, “You are a [N-word] \nlike all the rest – you just believe you are better cause you are a smart one.”  Guster-Hines v. \nMcDonald’s USA LLC, No. 20-00117, Compl. [D.E. 1,], at ¶ 59 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 2020).   \n183.  For no reason other than Mr. Mason’s race, and in the same way it did to all Plaintiffs \nnamed herein, McDonald’s intentionally concealed this information and limited Mr. Mason’s ability \nto grow and expand his franchise organization throughout his franchise term.   \n(ii)  McDonald’s Requires Plaintiffs to Make Significant Initial Investments in \nSubstandard Locations:  Unreasonable Rebuilds and Renovations \n184.  Despite placing Plaintiffs in locations McDonald’s knew would not generate an \nadequate return on Plaintiffs’ individual reinvestment due to low-volume sales and high expenses, \nMcDonald’s required Plaintiffs to pay for improvements to McDonald’s real estate in the form of \nexcessive and unnecessary rebuilds and/or renovations within a short time, offering initial short-term \nlower rent, but then rapidly escalating for the remaining franchise term, setting Plaintiffs up for \nfinancial failure.   \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 45 of 67 PageID #:908\n185.  McDonald’s knew or should have known that the rebuilds and/or renovations it \nrequired would not provide increased sales to Plaintiffs’ locations sufficient to offset Plaintiffs’ \nupfront losses.  \n186.  Plaintiffs paid for the costs associated with any rebuilds, renovations, and major \nremodels, often seeking outside financing, and driving them into debt.   \n187.  In certain instances where McDonald’s contributed to the rebuild and/or renovation \ncosts, McDonald’s charged Plaintiffs escalating rent it knew Plaintiffs could not afford.  \n188.  In comparison, McDonald’s offered White owner/operators newer restaurants that did \nnot require significant reinvestment and/or locations with higher volume-sales that McDonald’s knew \nwould generate an adequate return on investment and would offset renovation and/or rebuild costs. \nMcDonald’s also placed White owner/operators on a voluntary reinvestment program without the \nsame time restrictions placed on Black franchisees.  As representative examples of specific instances \nof such unequal treatment with respect to reinvestment requirements,   \na.  Plaintiff Van Jakes:  McDonald’s required Plaintiff Jakes to reinvest in his \nPanola Road, Georgia, McDonald’s restaurant three (3) times over the course \nof his franchise term when, by contrast, McDonald’s did not require a White \nowner/operator, Patrick Dennis, in the same Region to make any reinvestments \nto his restaurant located just a few miles down the road in Peachtree City, \nGeorgia.  These changes included modernizations that McDonald’s told Mr. \nJakes were nationally mandated, such as changing a green roof to red.   \nb.  Plaintiff  Yvonne  Knox:    Plaintiff  Knox  struggled  with  one  low-volume \nMcDonald’s restaurant for nearly four decades located in a depressed, crime-\nridden area of Detroit, Michigan.  In 2013, a McDonald’s Field Consultant told \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 46 of 67 PageID #:909\nMs. Knox that she had to reimage her store a second time.  Ms. Knox complied, \nrelying on McDonald’s assurances that the reinvestment would increase sales, \nso  that  she  could  finally  sell  her  store  and  buy  a  profitable  McDonald’s \nfranchise.  After the reimaging, McDonald’s told Ms. Knox that she could not \nbuy outside of her Region, even though White operators routinely owned and \noperated outside of their initial Regions.  Through this process, and throughout \nher franchise term, McDonald’s restricted Ms. Knox’s ability to grow beyond \nthe predominantly Black neighborhood it offered her initially, benefiting from \nthe improvements she paid for, and perpetuating the same cycle at the end of \nher term by telling her that she could only sell to another Black owner/operator.   \nc.  Plaintiff Larry Brown:  After Plaintiff Brown sought to purchase ten (10) \nMcDonald’s restaurants that McDonald’s Vice President, Walt Maney, had \nreserved  for  McDonald’s  Corporation  executives,  Sue  Immick  and  Dave \nRoberts, who were leaving the company and wanted to become McDonald’s \nowner/operators, Plaintiff Brown faced retaliation in the form of unreasonable \nrenovation requirements.  McDonald’s initially told Mr. Brown that three (3) \nrestaurants  required  rebuilds,  but  later  required  him  to  bring  all  ten  (10) \nrestaurants in compliance with National Restaurant Brand Standards within six \n(6) months, even though these restaurants had been in the same condition for \nover five (5) years under different ownership. \n189.  When McDonald’s forced Plaintiffs out and offered stores to White owner/operators, \nMcDonald’s did not require White owner/operators to immediately reinvest and/or remodel by a \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 47 of 67 PageID #:910\ncertain date.  Moreover, certain restaurants Plaintiffs sold to White owner/operators years ago are in \nthe same condition Plaintiffs left them.   \n190.  On the other hand, in certain cases where McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs’ stores to \nBlack owner/operators, McDonald’s required immediate reinvestment and/or remodels, continuing \nthe same perpetual cycle of giving bad restaurants in bad neighborhoods to Black owner/operators \nand setting them up for financial failure to then force them out and start the cycle again.     \n191.  Even McDonald’s-owned McOpCo stores were kept in disrepair for years until \nMcDonald’s turned around and immediately required Plaintiffs to reinvest in significant rebuilds \nand/or renovations as a condition of purchase.   \n192.  McDonald’s rebuild and renovation requirements forced Plaintiffs to sink their own \nfunds into locations McDonald’s knew would not provide any return on investment, benefitting only \nMcDonald’s as the owner of the real estate, while driving Plaintiffs into significant debt. \n(iii)  McDonald’s Arbitrarily Denies Plaintiffs Opportunities for Growth \n193.  The economics of owning McDonald’s franchises is to own more than one location so \nthat overhead costs can be absorbed by the multiple locations and yield a profit to the franchise \nowners.   \n194.  McDonald’s knew that to grow a profitable franchise organization in its franchise \nsystem, Plaintiffs needed restaurants with higher sales volume and cash flow to offset the low-\nvolume, high-cost stores it offered them.   \n195.  Yet, McDonald’s refused reasonable proposals from Plaintiffs to expand within the \nMcDonald’s system by opening McDonald’s restaurants at sites Plaintiffs were ready, willing, and \nqualified to operate, offering these profitable locations to White franchisees instead. \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 48 of 67 PageID #:911\n196.  For  no  reason  other  than  Plaintiffs’  race,  McDonald’s  systematically  rejected \nPlaintiffs’ sites and/or failed to provide Plaintiffs with any meaningful assistance to locate better \nrestaurants in better neighborhoods.   \n197.  Plaintiffs would wait years before McDonald’s made an offer for another store, only \nto find out they were offering another “hood” restaurant, meaning it was a low-volume store in an \neconomically distressed community with a high crime rate.  These substandard restaurants were \nconsistently offered to Black owner/operators over White owner-operators.    \n198.  In  certain  instances  where  Plaintiffs  were  given  the  opportunity  to  purchase  a \nprofitable store, it was at a significantly higher premium, with oppressive conditions attached, such \nas an agreement to purchase other substandard locations as part of a “packaged deal.” \n199.  Despite McDonald’s representations and continued assurances to Plaintiffs that it \nwould assist in growth opportunities, McDonald’s continued to intentionally deprive Plaintiffs of any \nmeaningful assistance to find other viable expansion locations over the course of their franchise \nrelationship.  \n200.  Indeed, McDonald’s did the opposite and went as far as to saturate the market and \nencroach upon Plaintiffs’ locations by opening McDonald’s stores just miles apart.   \n201.  While McDonald’s offered impact funds to offset new store competition to White \noperators up front before the new, competing restaurant became operational, Plaintiffs were made to \n“wait and see,” until the actual impact could be assessed.   \n202.  This forced Plaintiffs to continue to operate at a loss, sometimes for more than a year, \nwhile they waited for the full impact of the competing stores to be realized and assessed. \n \n \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 49 of 67 PageID #:912\n(iv)  McDonald’s False Promise of “Rent Relief” and Misleading Financial \nAssistance \n \n203.  Despite  Plaintiffs’  significant  investments  and  hard  work  over  decades  in  the \nMcDonald’s franchise system, when Plaintiffs requested financial assistance to reduce the rent, \nMcDonald’s either denied their requests or rent was temporarily reduced and then escalated causing \nfurther financial harm.   \n204.  McDonald’s knew when it escalated Plaintiffs’ rents that Plaintiffs would not be able \nto pay their rent over the long term, yet McDonald’s refused to provide Plaintiffs with permanent rent \nrelief, even though McDonald’s offered this relief to White franchisees.   \n205.  Through the FDD, McDonald’s provided Plaintiffs with a table of total acquisition \nand development costs, along with Fixed Percentage Rent rates, explaining how McDonald’s sets and \ncontrols these costs and rent rates as follows:  \nThe percentages used in computing monthly payments based on Gross \nSales are determined by McDonald’s management in consideration \nof the rights being granted by the Franchise Agreement, the drawing \npower of the McDonald’s restaurant, the value of the McDonald’s \nSystem as a whole and McDonald’s interests in obtaining a profit in \nlight  of  competitive  conditions.    All  payments  made  by  you  to \nMcDonald’s constitute a single financial arrangement between you and \nMcDonald’s  which,  taken  as  a  whole  and  without  regard  to  any \ndesignation or description, reflect the value of the rights being made \navailable to you by McDonald’s and the services being rendered by \nMcDonald’s during the franchise term.  The percentages may vary \namong franchises depending upon when the franchise was sold as well \nas other factors.  In unusual circumstances that involve special costs, \nthe fees paid by you may be higher than those outlined in this Item 6. \n \n(See FDD, Ex. B, at Item 6) (emphasis added).  \n206.  After  placing  Plaintiffs  in  restaurants  with  no  “drawing  power,”  guided  by \nMcDonald’s own “interests in obtaining a profit,” McDonald’s denied Plaintiffs any legitimate \n46 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 50 of 67 PageID #:913\nfinancial assistance, including, but not limited to, repeated requests for permanent rent reductions, \nfinancial restructuring, and paying for security not required by White owned and operated restaurants.   \n207.  McDonald’s kept Plaintiffs on the hook throughout his franchise terms through false \npromises and minimal relief efforts, as they drove Plaintiffs further and further into debt, isolating \nthem at every step of the process to then make it easier to force each Plaintiff out once they are no \nlonger profitable to McDonald’s.  \n(v)  Targeted and Unreasonable Inspections and Grading \n \n208.  Once Plaintiffs were in dire financial situations and/or refused to continue operations \nin crime-ridden neighborhoods with low-volume sales, McDonald’s began targeted, rigorous, and \nunreasonable inspections and harsh grading that White franchisees were not subjected to, generating \nnegative business reviews of Plaintiffs’ restaurants.   \n209.  The number of inspections grew exponentially, with close to ten (10) inspections in a \nsingle quarter in certain instances, and the inspections began to take place late at night or at odd hours.   \n210.  Whereas Plaintiffs generally had positive business reviews prior to experiencing \nfinancial hardship and/or rejecting McDonald’s offer to continue to operate in substandard locations, \nthat immediately shifted as McDonald’s began grading Plaintiffs more harshly in business reviews in \na manner that disproportionately impacted Black franchisees as compared to White franchisees.   \n211.  McDonald’s knew and leveraged the fact that Plaintiffs’ eligibility for growth and \nrenewal, or “rewrite,” of their franchise term depended on business reviews and passing inspections. \n212.  By  instituting  harsher  grading  standards  and  through  unreasonable  inspections, \nMcDonald’s negatively impacted Plaintiffs’ performance ratings as pretext for McDonald’s denial of \ngrowth and/or rewrite opportunities.  \n \n47 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 51 of 67 PageID #:914\n(vi)  No Choice But to Sell:  McDonald’s Forced Exit Scheme  \n213.  Under the oppressive terms of McDonald’s rewrite process, McDonald’s has absolute \nand sole discretion with respect to whether a franchisee may or may not be offered a new term \nfranchise, or “rewrite.”  See McDonald’s U.S. Rewrite (New Term) Policy, Exhibit L to the FDD, \nwhich is subject to change “in McDonald’s sole discretion.”  \n214.  Pursuant to McDonald’s Rewrite Policy, three (3) years prior to the franchise term \nexpiring, the rewrite process begins.  (FDD, Ex. B, at Exhibit L).  McDonald’s controls the rewrite \nprocess:  Only McDonald’s Rewrite Committee has the authority to offer or decline to offer a new \nterm franchise, the Rewrite Committee’s recommendations are submitted by the Vice President of \nthe  Field  Office  of  the  Rewrite  Committee,  compromised  of  members  of  McDonald’s  U.S. \nmanagement.  Id.  The decision of the Rewrite Committee is final.  Id.  \n215.  When McDonald’s concludes that it will not offer a new term franchise, McDonald’s \nwill extend an “alternative offer, which will give the Owner/Operator the opportunity to sell the \nrestaurant business to a qualified buyer prior to the expiration of the current franchise.  Subject to \nthe terms stated in the alternative offer, which include a release, McDonald’s will commit to offer a \nnew term franchise to the qualified buyer.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \n216.  Plaintiffs with interested buyers were blocked by McDonald’s, who had final approval \nin “qualifying” buyers.  McDonald’s rejected Plaintiffs’ potential buyers without any legitimate \nbusiness justification.  For example,  \na.  Plaintiff Christine Crawford:  When Plaintiff Christine Crawford presented \nMcDonald’s with a list of operators interested in purchasing her restaurants, then \nGeneral Manager of the Atlanta Region, Greg Watson, told Ms. Crawford that she \ncould only offer them to operators who were, “a part of the class picture of the \n48 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 52 of 67 PageID #:915\nregion’s future.”  Similarly, in an email from McDonald’s Atlanta Region Vice \nPresident, Valarie Williams, McDonald’s told Ms. Crawford, “The QSC VP will \nprovide names of potential buyers that are supported by the region for you to \nnegotiate the sale of your restaurants.”   \nb.  Plaintiff Jeremiah Simmons:  After McDonald’s USA Senior Vice President \nand Chief Restaurant Officer, Mason Smoot, told Plaintiff Simmons to invest in \na McCafé despite his low-volume sales or leave the system, Mr. Simmons began \nlooking  for  potential  buyers.    Mr.  Simmons  had  an  offer  from  another \nMcDonald’s owner/operator and agreed on a selling price.  The buyer withdrew \nthe  offer,  however,  shortly  after  speaking  to  Mr.  Smoot.    McDonald’s \nsubsequently  approved  another  McDonald’s  owner/operator’s  offer  to  the \npurchase Mr. Simmons’ franchise for $400,000 less than his original offer.   \n217.  Because McDonald’s controlled the exit process, there was no way for Plaintiffs to \ngauge what their restaurants could have sold for in an open market.   \n218.  McDonald’s systematically dealt with Plaintiffs on an individual basis to cover up \ntheir discriminatory practices and fraudulent scheme from Black franchisees.   \n219.  McDonald’s led Plaintiffs to believe at all times material hereto that they had no choice \nbut to sell and that their financial losses were caused by Plaintiffs’ individual deficiencies as a “bad \noperators” or operational deficiencies within Plaintiffs’ network of stores.   \n220.  With the looming threat of further financial penalties, and no process for disputing \nqualification denials of buyers in the rewrite process McDonald’s controlled, Plaintiffs could not \nafford to wait for another “qualified buyer,” and were forced to sell their stores at a loss.  \n49 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 53 of 67 PageID #:916\n221.  As a result of McDonald’s discriminatory practices, unfair retaliation, breach of \ncontract, and fraud alleged herein, Plaintiffs have suffered substantial damages in amounts that will \nbe proven at trial, including, but not limited to, lost profits, lost value of the franchise(s), lost capital \ncontributions, lost investments, lost revenue, lost business opportunities, attorneys’ fees, costs, and \nany and all unnecessary out-of-pocket expenses. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1981 \n(As to Plaintiffs, Christine Crawford, Delores Crawford, Juneth N.

Plaintiffs, Christine Crawford, Delores Crawford, Juneth N. Daniel, Yves Dominique, \nVan Jakes, Ralph King, Keith Manning, Kenneth Manning, Dawn Mussenden, Laetitia Johnson, \nCarrie Salone, Floyd Sims, Larry Brown, John Mason, Ronnie Thornton, Lisa Gunter, f/k/a Lisa \nMcKenzie, Mitchell McGuire, Lois McGuire, Hayes Ferrell, Yvonne Knox, Arthur Scott, Errol \nService, Melvin Jones, George Gipson, Michael Simon, Victor Bruce, David White, Barbara White, \nJohn Tillman, Allen Stafford, Keristin Holloway, Gloria Holloway, George Jones, Jane Jones, Wise \nFinley, Lewis Anderson, Scott Miller, Dwight Miller, Faye Hobley, Paul Hoskins, Michele Hoskins, \nAl Harris, Kristen Harris, Norman H. Williams, William (Pete) Washington, Benny Clark, and \nEleanor Clark (collectively, the “1981 Plaintiffs”), adopt, reallege, and incorporate the allegations of \nparagraphs 1 through 221 of this Amended Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n50 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 54 of 67 PageID #:917\n223.  The 1981 Plaintiffs are members of a protected class due to their race as Black citizens \nwho have the same right to make and enforce contracts as White citizens pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1981.  \n224.  The  Franchise  Agreements  between  the  1981  Plaintiffs  and  McDonald’s  are \n“contracts” within the meaning of Section 1981, as amended, providing that Black citizens have the \nsame  right  to  “the  making,  performance,  modification,  and  termination  of  contracts,  and  the \nenjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the [franchise] relationship” as White \ncitizens.  42 U.S.C. § 1981(b). \n225.  McDonald’s violated 42 U.S.C. § 1981 by denying the 1981 Plaintiffs the same \nfranchise opportunities made available to White franchisees. \n226.  McDonald’s  treated  the  1981  Plaintiffs  differently  from  other  similarly-situated \nfranchisees in their region and nationwide because they are Black, by, including, but not limited to:   \na.  Restricting  the  1981  Plaintiffs  to  older,  recycled  restaurants,  in  poor-\nperforming and dangerous locations with high operating costs and low-volume \nsales;  \n \nb.  Requiring the 1981 Plaintiffs to invest in rebuilds and/or renovations within \nshort timeframes not required of White franchisees;  \n \nc.  Excluding 1981 Plaintiffs from the same growth opportunities offered to White \nfranchisees;   \n \nd.  Failing to provide any legitimate business reasons for repeated denials of \nfranchise opportunities to 1981 Plaintiffs over many years; \n \ne.  Denying  1981  Plaintiffs  meaningful  support  to  allow  them  to  overcome \nfinancial hardships, while White franchisees were routinely provided such \nassistance, including, but not limited to, permanent rent relief and impact \nfunding;  \n \nf.  Depriving 1981 Plaintiffs of the same legacy opportunities offered to White \nfranchisees through McDonald’s Next Gen program; \n \n51 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 55 of 67 PageID #:918\ng.  Retaliation  against  the  1981  Plaintiffs  for  rejecting  offers  to  continue \noperations in crime-ridden neighborhoods with low-volume sales, including \nthrough targeted, increased, and unreasonable inspections;  \n \nh.  Disparate  treatment  with  respect  to  inspections  and  grading  of  the  1981 \nPlaintiffs’ restaurants as part of a scheme to generate bad business reviews to \nforce Plaintiffs out of the McDonald’s system because of their race; and/or \n \ni.  Placing the 1981 Plaintiffs in untenable positions of economic duress, denying \nthem eligibility for growth and renewal of their agreements, and arbitrarily \ndenying final approval of their buyers, so that the 1981 Plaintiffs had no choice \nbut to sell their entire franchise organization at a loss or walk away from the \nbusiness after decades investing in and cultivating their businesses. \n \n227.  By the conduct described above, Defendants intentionally and willfully deprived 1981 \nPlaintiffs of the same rights enjoyed by White citizens to be free from racial discrimination in the \nright to enter into contracts and the right to enjoy all of the privileges and benefits of established \ncontractual relationships in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. \n228.  As a direct and proximate result of McDonald’s conduct, 1981 Plaintiffs collectively \nlost close to three-hundred (300) stores with compensatory damages averaging between four million \ndollars ($4,000,000.00) and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per store. \n229.  McDonald’s engaged in willful, wanton, malicious, and or/reckless conduct that \ninjured 1981 Plaintiffs in disregard of their protected rights, thereby entitling them to punitive \ndamages.   \n230.  McDonald’s willful, wanton, malicious, and/or reckless conduct includes, but is not \nlimited to, its racially discriminatory practices and fraudulent conduct that resulted in substantial and \nirreparable damages sustained by the1981 Plaintiffs.   \n231.  Defendants fraudulently concealed their discriminatory practices through the conduct \ndescribed above, including systematic isolation of the 1981 Plaintiffs and controlling the information \n52 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 56 of 67 PageID #:919\nthey  received,  designed  to  prevent  the  1981  Plaintiffs  discovery  of  McDonald’s  ongoing \ndiscriminatory practices post-parity. \n232.  At all times material, Defendants had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their \nconduct and the high probability that injury and/or damage to  the1981 Plaintiffs would result, and \ndespite that knowledge, willfully, wantonly, and recklessly pursued their course of conduct.   \n233.  Defendants actively and knowingly participated in such conduct, and/or their officers, \ndirectors, or managers knowingly condoned, ratified or consented to such conduct.   \n234.  Defendants’ conduct is so gross and flagrant as to show a reckless disregard or a \nconscious wanton, reckless indifference to consequences or a grossly careless disregard for the life, \nsafety, and/or rights of 1981 Plaintiffs.  \n235.  McDonald’s has demonstrated an outrageous conscious disregard for 1981 Plaintiffs’ \nrights with implied malice, warranting the imposition of punitive damages. \n236.  But for 1981 Plaintiffs’ race and McDonald’s discriminatory denial of equal franchise \nopportunities, and as a direct and proximate result of McDonald’s practice of ongoing discrimination \nduring each 1981 Plaintiffs’ franchise term, the 1981 Plaintiffs suffered and continue to suffer \ndamages in an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limit, including, without limitation:  special or \nconsequential damages in the form of lost profits and opportunities; damages for the intangible injury \nthat results from the denial of civil rights under the law; emotional and physical suffering and distress, \nhumiliation, damage to professional reputations and future business prospects; punitive damages in \nan amount sufficient to deter Defendants’ similar wrongful conduct in the future; and an award of \nattorneys’ fees, expert fees, and costs. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, Christine Crawford, Delores Crawford, Juneth N.

The Breach of Contract Plaintiffs entered into Franchise Agreements to own and \noperate McDonald’s domestic franchised restaurants, on the entry dates, and in the locations specified \nabove. \n239.  The Breach of Contract Plaintiffs substantially performed all material terms of the \nFranchise Agreements by, among other things, operating their restaurants in compliance with the \nstandards prescribed by the McDonald’s System, making timely payments of undisputed amounts \ndue to McDonald’s and suppliers, unless excused, complying with non-compete provisions, and \nallowing McDonald’s to inspect their restaurants at reasonable times.   \n240.  Pursuant to Section 3 of the Franchise Agreement, “General Services of McDonald’s,” \nMcDonald’s agreed to, “make available to Franchisee all additional services, facilities, rights, and \nprivileges relating to the operation of the Restaurant which McDonald’s makes generally available, \n55 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 59 of 67 PageID #:922\nfrom time to time, to all its franchisees operating McDonald’s restaurants.”  (Franchise Agreement, \nEx. A, at ¶ 3) (emphasis added).   \n241.  McDonald’s breached Section 3 of the Franchise Agreement by, inter alia: \na.  Excluding the Breach of Contract Plaintiffs from the right to grow their \norganizations to profitable locations offered to other franchisees;  \n \nb.  Excluding the Breach of Contract Plaintiffs from participation in the Next Gen \nlegacy program offered to other franchisees;  \n \nc.  Disproportionately imposing rebuild and/or renovation requirements on the \nBreach of Contract Plaintiffs that were not imposed on other franchisees; \nand/or \n \nd.  Failing to approve the Breach of Contract Plaintiffs’ reasonable requests for \nfinancial  assistance  and/or  restructuring  plans  that  were  offered  to  other \nfranchisees, including, but not limited to, permanent rent adjustments and \nimpact funding.   \n \n242.  McDonald’s further agreed to a reasonableness standard with respect inspections and \nrenovation/rebuild requirements pursuant to Section 12, “Compliance with Entire System:”  \nMcDonald’s  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the  Restaurant  at  all \nreasonable times to ensure that Franchisee’s operation thereof is in \ncompliance with the standards and policies of the McDonald’s System.  \n \nFranchisee  shall  comply  with  the  entire  McDonald’s  System, \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: (c) Keep the Restaurant \nconstructed and equipped in accordance with the building blueprints \nand  equipment  layout  plans  that  are  standard  in  the  McDonald’s \nSystem or as such blueprints and plans may be reasonably changed \nfrom time to time by McDonald’s. \n \n(Id., at ¶ 12) (emphasis added).  Article 7 of the Operator’s Lease, incorporated as Exhibit A into the \nFranchise Agreement, similarly requires any inspections to be “during reasonable business hours.”  \n(Operator’s Lease, at § 7.01) (emphasis added).   \n243.  McDonald’s breached Section 12 of the Franchise Agreement by inter alia: \na.  Imposing high-cost rebuilds and/or renovations of the Breach of Contract \nPlaintiffs’ restaurants in locations that McDonald’s knew would not provide \n56 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 60 of 67 PageID #:923\nan adequate return on investment and in short time frames not required of other \nfranchisees; and/or \n \nb.  Increased,  harassing,  and  targeted  inspections  of  the  Breach  of  Contract \nPlaintiffs’ restaurants, including outside of regular business hours.  \n \n244.  McDonald’s also owed a duty of good faith and fair dealing to the Breach of Contract \nPlaintiffs in its performance under the Franchise Agreement.  \n245.  In its performance of the Franchise Agreement, McDonald’s violated its duty of good \nfaith and fair dealing by, inter alia: \na.  Engaging in unreasonable and targeted inspections of Breach of Contract \nPlaintiffs’ restaurants as pretext for denying them growth and rewrite; \n \nb.  Applying harsher grading standards to the Breach of Contract  Plaintiffs’ \nrestaurants in order to generate bad business reviews;  \n \nc.  Denying Plaintiffs meaningful financial assistance, including, rent relief and \nimpact money for building new stores within their trade area; \n \nd.  Imposing excessive costs and investments and modifications, including those \nrequired  under  the  BBV2020  plan,  and  then  arbitrarily  reneging  on  the \n“unprecedented investment” promised by McDonald’s through its partnering \nprogram; \n \ne.  Placing the Breach of Contract Plaintiffs in positions of economic duress and \nasking Plaintiffs to sign one-sided release agreements at every step of the \nfranchise relationship; and/or \n \nf.  Forcing the Breach of Contract Plaintiffs to sell their franchises at a loss after \nfailing  to  approve  reasonable  requests  for  financial  assistance  and/or \nrestructuring plans, that could have resolved any outstanding obligations and \ndebt on one store in the organization and allowed the Breach of Contract \nPlaintiffs to remain in the system.   \n \n246.  As a direct and proximate result of McDonald’s conduct, Breach of Contract Plaintiffs \ncollectively lost close to three-hundred (300) stores with compensatory damages averaging between \nfour million dollars ($4,000,000.00) and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per store. \n57 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 61 of 67 PageID #:924\n247.  As a direct, proximate, and foreseeable result of McDonald’s breach of contract and \nbad faith, the Breach of Contract Plaintiffs have incurred substantial damages in amounts that will be \nproven at trial, including, without limitation, reasonable compensation for the time and effort \nexpended in planning and preparing their franchise business, lost profits, and out-of-pocket expenses \nthey incurred in pursuing the franchise business, in an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limit, \nand any applicable prejudgment and post-judgment interest.    \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, Christine Crawford, Delores Crawford, Juneth N.

As fully set forth above, Defendants failed to disclose material information to the \nFraudulent Omission Plaintiffs throughout their franchise terms, including, but not limited to:  \na.  Failing to disclose that the substandard locations it offered to the Fraud \nPlaintiffs were not the only available sites and that other profitable locations \nwere being offered to White franchisees;  \n \n59 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 30 Filed: 11/16/20 Page 63 of 67 PageID #:926\nb.  Failing to disclose that the financial performance of the Fraud Plaintiffs’ \nrestaurant locations would be in line with the national average of domestic \ntraditional McDonald’s restaurants opened at least one (1) year prior; \n \nc.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s would require Plaintiffs to rebuild and/or \nremodel their restaurants, with little or no impact on sales, on short timelines, \nand without permanent rent relief;  \n \nd.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s would offer growth opportunities to \nhigher-volume,  lower  cost  locations  to  White  franchisees  over  Black \nfranchisees;  \n \ne.  Failing to disclose the information that McDonald’s used to determine the \nFraud Plaintiffs’ renewal upon expiration of their franchise terms; \n \nf.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s would begin harassing inspections of the \nFraud  Plaintiffs’  restaurants  if  the  Fraud  Plaintiffs  experience  financial \ndifficulty;  \n \ng.  Failing to disclose that the Fraud Plaintiffs’ restaurants would be subject to \nharsher grading than similarly situated franchisees to generate bad business \nreviews when the Fraud Plaintiffs experience financial difficulty; and/or \n \nh.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s had no intention of qualifying the Fraud \nPlaintiffs’ ready and willing buyers at the point of exit.  \n \n250.  McDonald’s intended that these material omissions would induce the Fraud Plaintiffs \nto accept substandard locations, invest in significant renovations and/or rebuilds, accept unequal \nterms as part of temporary financial assistance, continue to accept substandard stores as a condition \nto own and operate profitable stores, accept McDonald’s rewrite denial and sell their stores.   \n251.  McDonald’s fraudulently concealed this systemic practice and controlled all of the \ninformation provided to franchisees such that the Fraud Plaintiffs did not know, have reason to know, \nnor could have discovered, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, the foregoing omissions. \n252.

Seeger: Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint as a Matter\nof Course Pursuant to Rule 15 (Dckt. No. 28 ) is hereby granted. Rule 15(a)(1)(B) provides that a party \"may amend its\npleading once as a matter of course within... 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a\nmotion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). As the plain text reveals, Rule\n15(a)(1)(B) contemplates an amendment \"without the permission of the court.\" See 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed. Prac. &\nProc. § 1480 (3d ed. 2020). As long as the party files the amended pleading within 21 days, there is no need to ask the Court\nfor anything. \"The purpose of the amendment-as-of-right provision is to avoid judicial involvement in the pleading process\nwhen there is little reason for doing so.\" Id.; see also Bertha v. Sullivan, 719 F. App'x 516, 518 (7th Cir. 2017) (\"Bertha filed\nhis amended complaint within that [21-day] time limit, so permission from the judge was unnecessary.\"). \"[W]hether to allow\nan amendment\" is \"out of the court's hands entirely\" if the party files an amendment within 21 days. See Swanigan v. City of\nChicago, 775 F.3d 953, 963 (7th Cir. 2015). Here, Plaintiffs filed a \"motion for leave\" to file an amended complaint \"as a\nmatter of course.\" (Dckt. No. 28 ) Those are two different things -- a party does not need permission to file an amended\npleading as a matter of course. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 23, 2020. (Dckt. No. 24 ) So, under the\nFederal Rules, Plaintiffs had a right to file an amended complaint by November 13, 2020, meaning 21 days later. But instead\nof filing an amended complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, and did so on November 13,\n2020. There was no need to file a motion for permission because, under the Federal Rules, they did not need permission. But\nby filing a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, instead of filing the amended complaint itself, Plaintiffs missed the\ndeadline to file an amended complaint without permission. They asked for permission when they didn't need it, and thus\nmissed a deadline to file something without permission. And by missing the deadline to file something without permission,\nPlaintiffs now need permission. Permission is granted. The motion (Dckt. No. 28 ) is granted. Plaintiffs attached the proposed\nfirst amended complaint as an attachment to their motion. Plaintiffs shall file the first amended complaint as a freestanding\ndocket entry by November 23, 2020.

Seeger: The Court reviewed the Joint Initial Status Report (Dckt. No. 43 ).\nThe parties disagree about whether discovery should proceed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss, which the parties are\nstill briefing (the reply is due on February 2, 2021). Plaintiffs are a putative class of 77 former Black franchisees of\nMcDonald's. They operated more than 300 restaurants. Plaintiffs seek between $4 million and $5 million per restaurant in\ncompensatory damages, plus punitive damages. All together, Plaintiffs seek more than $1 billion in damages. In light of the\nnumber of plaintiffs, the anticipated scope of discovery, and the enormity of the requested damages, it makes sense to assess\nthe viability of the complaint before proceeding headlong into discovery. Discovery surely would be burdensome and\nexpensive, so the sufficiency of the complaint must come first. Discovery is hereby stayed pending further order of the Court.\nMailed notice.

Plaintiffs are Black, former McDonald’s franchisees, who bought into McDonald’s \npublic commitment to the Black communities it serves only to be misled and denied equal opportunity \nto economic success by McDonald’s systematic and covert racial discrimination.  \n2.  Plaintiffs entered the McDonald’s franchise system with the expectation that it would \nopen the door to opportunities to develop thriving businesses to pass on to their children.   \n3.  Plaintiffs were more than McDonald’s franchisees; they were employers and pillars in \ntheir communities.  In many cases, they became parental figures providing the safety and security \noften lacking in the depressed, crime-ridden neighborhoods that McDonald’s steered them to.  \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 5 of 51 PageID #:5\n4.  For more than 50 years, McDonald’s has branded itself as a socially conscious \ncompany, committed to strengthening Black entrepreneurship, and embracing racial opportunity as a \ncritical component of its corporate culture.   \n5.  On June 16, 2020, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Kempczinski, \nappeared on CNBC’s “Mad Money with Jim Cramer” and stated that, “McDonald’s has created more \nmillionaires within the Black community than probably any other corporation on the planet.”   \n6.  In response to the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, \nMcDonald’s  proclaimed,  “We  do  not  tolerate  inequity,  injustice,  or  racism.”    McDonald’s \nadvertisements read, “They were all one of us.  We see them in our customers.  We see them in our \ncrew members.  We see them in our franchisees.  And this is why the entire McDonald’s family \ngrieves.  It’s why we stand for them and any other victims of systematic oppression and violence.” \n7.  As recently as McDonald Corporation’s Verified Complaint against its former CEO, \nStephen J. Easterbrook, McDonald’s continues to falsely represent a corporate commitment to \nequality:  “Today, [McDonald’s] continues its efforts to cultivate a safe, nondiscriminatory, and \nrespectful workplace, including most recently through a renewed values statement that makes clear \nMcDonald’s commitment to operating its business with integrity and creating equal opportunities.”  \nMcDonald’s Corporation v. Easterbrook, Case Id. 2020-0658, Verified Compl. [D.E. 1], at ⁋ 34 (Del. \nCh. Aug. 10, 2020) (emphasis added).  \n8.  These statements are patently false and highlight the dichotomy between McDonald’s \ncorporate  ethos  as  a  recruiter  and  developer  of  Black  entrepreneurs  and  its  record  on  race:  \nMcDonald’s has a decades-long history of racial discrimination against its own Black franchisees.  \n9.  McDonald’s  proclaims  a  commitment  to  racial  equality,  profits  from  its  Black \ncustomers, yet places Black franchisees in locations that are destined to fail, with low-volume sales \n2 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 6 of 51 PageID #:6\nand high operating costs, leading to consistent profit shortfalls or losses, impeding Black franchisees’ \nefforts to grow as they acquire other stores, necessary for success under McDonald’s own franchise \nmodel, to force Black franchisees out, repeating this pattern of misconduct over and over again. \n10. McDonald’s racial discrimination has resulted in an increasing cash flow gap between\nMcDonald’s Black franchisees as compared to White ones.  This cash flow gap more than tripled \nfrom 2010 to 2019, per National Black McDonald’s Operators Association (“NBMOA”) data.  \n11. Plaintiffs’  average  annual  sales  of  $2  million  was  more  than  $700,000  under\nMcDonald’s national average of $2.7 million between 2011 and 2016, and $2.9 million in 2019.  \n12. As a result, the historic high of approximately 400 Black McDonald’s franchisees in\n1998 has been more than cut in half.  Today, there are less than 200 Black franchisees.  See Figure \n1 below, based on NBMOA and McDonald’s data. \nFigure 1:  Number of Black McDonald’s Franchisees \n3 \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 7 of 51 PageID #:7\n \n13.  At the same time, from 1998 to date, the total number of McDonald’s franchised \nrestaurants more than doubled.  See Figure 2 below, based on data from McDonald’s Corporation.   \n \nFigure 2: Number of McDonald’s Franchised Restaurants \n \n14.  These differences are statistically significant and are the result of Defendants’ racial \nbias and barriers within the McDonald’s franchise system, effectuated by Defendants through \nsystematic and covert racial discrimination targeted against Black franchisees.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 8 of 51 PageID #:8\n15.  McDonald’s  knowingly  discriminated  against  Plaintiffs,  Black  franchisees,  a \nprotected class under federal law (42 U.S.C. §1981), who were parties to franchise agreements with \nMcDonald’s, by, including, but not limited to:  \na.  Steering Plaintiffs to locations with low-volume sales and higher operating \ncosts, such as higher security costs due to crime, higher insurance rates, and \nhigher employee turnover, because of their race; \n \nb.  Excluding Plaintiffs from the purchase of restaurants in the open market \nbecause of their race; \n \nc.  Providing Plaintiffs with misleading financial information to induce them to \npurchase McDonald’s least desirable franchises;  \n \nd.  Requiring Plaintiffs to invest in rebuilds and/or renovations within short time \nframes not required of White franchisees;  \n \ne.  Excluding Plaintiffs from the same growth opportunities to higher-volume, \nlower-cost stores offered to White franchisees;   \n \nf.  Failing to provide any legitimate business reasons for repeated denials of \nfranchise opportunities to Plaintiffs over many years; \n \ng.  Denying Plaintiffs meaningful support to allow them to overcome financial \nhardships, while White franchisees were routinely provided such assistance, \nincluding, but not limited to, permanent rent relief and impact funding;  \n \nh.  Depriving  Plaintiffs  of  the  same  legacy  opportunities  offered  to  White \nfranchisees through McDonald’s Next Generation (“Next Gen”) program; \n \ni.  Retaliation against Plaintiffs for rejecting offers to continue operations in \ncrime-ridden  neighborhoods  with  low-volume  sales,  including  through \ntargeted, increased, and unreasonable inspections;  \n \nj.  Disparate treatment with respect to inspections and grading of Plaintiffs’ \nrestaurants as part of a scheme to generate bad business reviews to force \nPlaintiffs out of the McDonald’s system because of their race; and/or \n \nk.  Placing Plaintiffs in untenable positions of economic duress, denying them \neligibility for growth and renewal of their agreements, and arbitrarily denying \nfinal approval of their buyers, so that Plaintiffs had no choice but to exit on \nMcDonald’s terms, at a loss. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 9 of 51 PageID #:9\n16.  Through these series of repeated and interrelated events, McDonald’s intentionally \nand covertly deprived Plaintiffs of the same rights enjoyed by White franchisees to the creation, \nperformance, enjoyment, and all benefits of their contractual relationships with Defendants. \n17.  But  for  Plaintiffs’  race,  McDonald’s  would  have  offered  Plaintiffs  profitable \nrestaurant locations, opportunities for growth and expansion, on equal terms as White franchisees, \nrather than forcing them out after decades of sweat and tears dedicated to the franchise. \n18.  McDonald’s discriminatory and fraudulent practices were not apparent to Plaintiffs \nwhen committed, and only became apparent when viewed in light of the later acts establishing a \npattern of systematic and covert racial discrimination targeted against Black franchisees.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This is an action based on McDonald’s denial of Plaintiffs’ right to equality in their \ncontracts in violation of Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (Count I), \nbad faith breach of contract (Count II), fraudulent inducement and omission (Count III), and for \npunitive damages (Count IV). \n20.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332, 1343(a)(3), and 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  \n21.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ state-law claims pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1367 because they are so related to Plaintiffs’ federal question claims that they form part \nof the same case or controversy.  \n22.  Plaintiffs’ claims are properly joined under the permissive joinder provisions of Rule \n20, Fed. R. Civ. P., as their claims arise out of the same series of transactions or occurrences and raise \ncommon questions of law or fact.  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 10 of 51 PageID #:10\n23.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants  because  McDonald’s \nCorporation is headquartered in this District and McDonald’s USA maintains its principal place of \nbusiness in Chicago, Illinois.   \n24.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because Defendants \nreside in this District, where its principal place of business is located, and a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in Chicago, Illinois, which is within this District.  \nTHE PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n25.  Plaintiffs  are  members  of  a  federally-protected  class  who  owned  and  operated \nMcDonald’s restaurant(s).   \n26.

Defendants \n76.  Defendant McDonald’s USA is a Delaware limited liability corporation with its \nprincipal place of business located at 110 North Carpenter Street, Chicago, Illinois.  McDonald’s \nUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of McDonald’s Corporation and the franchisor of the McDonald’s \nfranchise system, which develops, operates, franchises, and services a system of fast-food restaurants \nin the United States.  \n77.  Defendant McDonald’s Corporation is a publicly traded Delaware corporation with its \nprincipal place of business located at One McDonald’s Plaza, Oak Brook, Illinois.  McDonald’s \n15 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 19 of 51 PageID #:19\nCorporation is the sole member of McDonald’s USA, and is the worldwide franchisor of the \nMcDonald’s franchise system.   \nCOMMON FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n78.  McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs what, at first, appeared to be a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to invest in and become a part of America’s best-known international corporation.   \n79.  Yet, by covertly restricting and steering Plaintiffs to older and underperforming store \nlocations because of their race, misleading financial representations and omissions, exclusion from \ngrowth opportunities, unequal renovation and rebuild requirements, and application of harsher and \nunreasonable grading and inspection standards, McDonald’s intentionally impeded Plaintiffs’ ability \nto succeed and grow within the franchise they dedicated their lives to.   \nA.  The McDonald’s Franchise Model:  Unequal Bargaining Power, The Franchise \nAgreement, and Misleading Franchise Disclosure Documents \n \n80.  McDonald’s  is  a  heavily  franchised  business  model.    As  of  May  1,  2020, \napproximately 95% of all U.S. restaurants are franchised to independent franchisees and about 5% \nare franchised to company-owned McDonald’s (“McOpCo”) restaurants.   \n81.  McDonald’s requires every franchisee to sign its standard Franchise Agreement in \norder to operate one or more, new or existing, McDonald’s restaurants located on real estate owned \nor leased by McDonald’s, and leased to the franchisee through an Operator’s Lease (“Lease”), for a \ntwenty (20) year term.  True and correct copies of McDonald’s USA’s standard Franchise Agreement \n(Traditional), A-1, and an exemplar of Plaintiff Dominique’s Franchise Agreement, A-2, are attached \nas Composite Exhibit “A” (the “Franchise Agreement”).1  \n \n1 McDonald’s has possession of Plaintiffs’ individual Franchise Agreements.  Upon information and belief, the Franchise \nAgreements attached hereto contain the same or substantially similar terms as each of the Franchise Agreements entered \ninto with the individual Plaintiffs.  Upon information and belief, McDonald’s Corporation is the franchisor of any \nFranchise Agreement entered into (and not later amended or superseded) prior to approximately 2005, and McDonald’s \nUSA is the franchisor of any Franchise Agreement entered into since approximately 2005. \n16 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 20 of 51 PageID #:20\n82.  The Franchise Agreement provides in relevant part:  \nGeneral Services of McDonald’s.  McDonald’s shall advise and consult \nwith Franchisee periodically in connection with the operation of the \nRestaurant and also, upon Franchisee’s request, at other reasonable \ntimes.  .  .McDonald’s  shall  also  make  available  to  Franchisee  all \nadditional services, facilities, rights, and privileges relating to the \noperation  of  the  Restaurant  which  McDonald’s  makes  generally \navailable,  from  time  to  time,  to  all  its  franchisees  operating \nMcDonald’s restaurants. \n \n(Franchise Agreement, Ex. A, at ¶ 3) (emphasis added).  Pursuant to Section 12, titled “Compliance \nwith Entire System,” McDonald’s and Plaintiffs further agreed as follows:  \nMcDonald’s  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the  Restaurant  at  all \nreasonable times to ensure that Franchisee’s operation thereof is in \ncompliance with the standards and policies of the McDonald’s System.  \n \nFranchisee  shall  comply  with  the  entire  McDonald’s  System, \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: (c) Keep the Restaurant \nconstructed and equipped in accordance with the building blueprints \nand  equipment  layout  plans  that  are  standard  in  the  McDonald’s \nSystem or as such blueprints and plans may be reasonably changed \nfrom time to time by McDonald’s. \n \n(Id., at ¶ 12) (emphasis added).  \n \n83.  Through McDonald’s Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”), a true and correct \ncopy of which is attached as Exhibit “B” hereto,2 McDonald’s provides prospective franchisees with \n“Financial  Performance  Representations,”  that  include  pro  forma  statements  with  the  national \naverage sales of domestic traditional McDonald’s restaurants opened at least one (1) year prior.  For \nexample, the most recent 2020 FDD attached hereto provides, in pertinent part, as follows:  \nAll Domestic Traditional Restaurants  \n \nOf  the  approximately  12,032  domestic  traditional  McDonald’s \nrestaurants  opened  at  least  1  year  as  of  December  31,  2019, \napproximately 79% had annual sales volumes in excess of $2,300,000; \n \n2 By way of example, attached is the most recent version of McDonald’s FDD, issued May 1, 2020.  McDonald’s issues \nits FDD annually and provides all prospective franchisees with the FDD prior to joining the McDonald’s franchise system.  \nMcDonald’s has possession of the individual disclosure documents it provided to Plaintiffs.   \n17 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 21 of 51 PageID #:21\napproximately 70% had annual sales volumes in excess of $2,500,000; \nand  approximately  60%  had  annual  sales  volumes  in  excess  of \n$2,700,000.  The average annual sales volume of domestic traditional \nMcDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, \nwas $3,009,000 during 2019.  The highest and lowest annual sales \nvolume in 2019 for these domestic traditional McDonald’s restaurants \nwas $12,654,000 and $654,000, respectively.  The median annual sales \nvolume of domestic traditional McDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 \nyear as of December 31, 2019, was $2,910,000 during 2019. \n \nTraditional Franchised Restaurants \n \nOf  the  approximately  11,435  domestic  traditional  franchised \nMcDonald’s restaurants opened at least 1 year as of December 31, \n2019,  approximately  78%  had  annual  sales  volumes  in  excess  of \n$2,300,000; approximately 68% had annual sales volumes in excess of \n$2,500,000;  and  approximately  58%  had  annual  sales  volumes  in \nexcess of $2,700,000.  The average annual sales volume of domestic \ntraditional franchised McDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 year as of \nDecember 31, 2019, was $2,970,000 during 2019.  The highest and \nlowest annual sales volume in 2019 for these domestic traditional \nMcDonald’s restaurants was $12,654,000 and $654,000, respectively.  \nThe median annual sales volume of domestic traditional franchised \nMcDonald’s restaurants open at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, \nwas $2,867,000 during 2019. \n \nTraditional Company Owned Restaurants  \n \nOf the approximately 597 domestic traditional McOpCo restaurants \nopened at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, approximately 99% \nhad annual sales volumes in excess of $2,300,000; approximately 98% \nhad annual sales volumes in excess of $2,500,000; and approximately \n95% had annual sales volumes in excess of $2,700,000.  The average \nannual sales volume of domestic traditional McOpCo restaurants open \nat least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, was $3,758,000 during 2019.  \nThe highest and lowest annual sales volume in 2019 for these domestic \ntraditional  McOpCo  restaurants  was  $8,182,000  and  $2,047,000, \nrespectively.  The median annual sales volume of domestic traditional \nMcOpCo restaurants open at least 1 year as of December 31, 2019, was \n$3,629,000 during 2019. \n \n(FDD, Ex. B, at Item 19) (emphasis added).   \n18 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 22 of 51 PageID #:22\n84.  At all times material hereto, and upon information and belief, Plaintiffs’ average \nannual sales were more than $700,000 under McDonald’s disclosed national averages of $2.7 \nmillion between 2011 and 2016, and $2.9 million in 2019.  \n85.  McDonald’s dictates uniformity of the operational structure and revenue expectations \nof  all  its  franchisees’  stores,  even  though  they  are  cognizant  that  Black-owned  and  operated \nMcDonald’s franchises generate significantly lower revenue and assume higher operational costs than \nthe national average due to the low-income and high-cost locations it steers its Black franchisees to.  \n86.  McDonald’s knew or should have known that these differential revenue and operating \ncosts of Black-operated franchises as compared to White-operated franchises are not random or due \nto poor management.  These differences are statistically significant and are the result of the historical \nracial bias and barriers built into the McDonald’s franchise system.   \n87.  Acquisition of a McDonald’s franchise under these conditions was nothing short of a \n“financial suicide mission.” \n(i)  The Cost to Operate a McDonald’s Franchise \n88.  To purchase a McDonald’s franchise, McDonald’s requires an initial down payment \nof 40% of the total cost for a new restaurant, or 25% of the total cost for an existing restaurant.3  \nGenerally, McDonald’s requires a minimum of $500,000 of non-borrowed personal resources.  See \nn. 3.  The balance of the purchase price may be financed for no more than seven (7) years.  Id. \n89.  Periodically,  franchisees  at  their  cost,  are  required  by  McDonald’s  to  rebuild, \nrenovate, and/or make major remodels to their restaurants.    \n90.  Owner/operators pay McDonald’s the following ongoing fees: \na.  Service fee:  A monthly fee based upon the restaurant’s sales performance (as \nof this filing date, a service fee of 4.0% of gross sales); and  \n \n3  McDonald’s  website,  Buying  a  Franchise,  available  at  https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-\nus/franchising/acquiring-franchising.html. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 23 of 51 PageID #:23\n \nb.  Rent:  A monthly base rent or percentage rent that is a percentage of monthly \nsales and that may include rent escalations, including, but not limited to, fixed-\nrent  escalations,  escalations  based  on  an  inflation  index,  and  fair-value \nadjustments, with terms ranging from annually to every five (5) years.  \n \n(Franchise Agreement, Ex. A, at ¶¶ 8–9; FDD, Ex. B, at Items 5–7, and Ex. A, at pp. 11–12). \n \n91.  Franchisees are also responsible for acquiring and maintaining insurance coverage \nupon  taking  possession  of  the  restaurant,  which  name  McDonald’s  as  an  additional  insured.  \n(Franchise Agreement, Ex. A, at ¶ 17). \n(ii)  A Financial Suicide Mission:  The Cost to Operate a Black McDonald’s \nFranchise \n \n92.  Unequal bargaining power characterizes the relationship between franchisees and \nMcDonald’s and this bargaining disparity is even more palpable for Black applicants and operators.    \n93.  This unequal bargaining position made it easy for McDonald’s to award Black \nfranchisees entering the system the oldest stores, in need of the most reinvestment, in tough and \ndepressed areas, that had been routinely rejected by White franchisees, many of which McDonald’s \nwanted to close, but needed someone to operate until McDonald’s could sell its real estate. \n94.  McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs locations with higher operating costs, such as security, \ninsurance, and employee training and turnover, and which required substantial renovations and \nrebuilds, as compared to White-owned franchises.   \n95.  McDonald’s discriminatory practices led to low cash flow and decreased equity for \nBlack owner/operators, forcing Black owner/operators, including Plaintiffs, into significant debt and, \nin many cases, bankruptcy. \n96.  According to documents from the NBMOA, this cash flow gap between Black and \nWhite McDonald’s franchisees more than tripled between 2010 and 2019.   \n20 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 24 of 51 PageID #:24\n97.  For McDonald’s, it was a win-win strategy to collect high rent and fees for substandard \nstores, built upon a history of discrimination it successfully executed for decades. \nB.

The McDonald’s franchise system was established in 1955, but Black franchisees \nwere denied entry until 1968, following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  \n(i)  Boycott in Cleveland 1969  \n99.  A boycott of McDonald’s in 1969 made headlines in Ohio and led to the first Black \nfranchisees in the McDonald’s system opening stores in depressed areas of Cleveland.   \n100.  In  a  January  25,  1970,  article  regarding  the  first  Black  owned  and  operated \nMcDonald’s franchise, the New York Times reported:  “Spokesman for Negro groups, who banded \ntogether to form Operation Black Unity have been demanding black ownership of four existing \nMcDonald’s units … All are in predominantly Negro areas.”  Cleveland Negro Wins a Franchise, \nN.Y. Times, Jan. 25, 1970, available at https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/25/archives/cleveland-\nnegro-wins-a-franchise-9month-controversy-over-restaurant.html (emphasis added).   \n101.  In 1972, the National Black McDonald’s Operators Association, also known as the \nNBMOA, was founded to help promote growth in the industry by Black owner/operators. \n(ii)  Trouble Under the Golden Arches:  Black Franchisee Sues McDonald’s \nfor Racial Steering \n \n102.  By the 1980s, Black franchisees were operating in the McDonald’s franchise system, \nbut McDonald’s did not treat Black franchisees as equals to White franchisees.  \n103.  In 1983, Charles Griffis, a Black McDonald’s owner/operator in the Los Angeles \nmarket, filed a race discrimination countersuit against McDonald’s, alleging, among other things, that \nMcDonald’s systematically excluded Blacks from buying stores in White neighborhoods.  \n104.  In a March 12, 1984, New York Times article, Griffis detailed his experience: \n21 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 25 of 51 PageID #:25\nMy stores are in hellholes, he said.  They get robbed once or twice a \nmonth, and I pay $20,000 a month in security services they don’t pay \nin good neighborhoods.  We had a murder in one and we still get the \nwindows smashed and the bathrooms vandalized.  I’ve upgraded my \nstores a lot and I don’t see why I shouldn’t have a shot at a store in \na good neighborhood. \n \nTamar Lewin, McDonald’s is Battling with Black Franchisee, N.Y. Times, March 12, 1984, \navailable at https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/12/business/mcdonald-s-is-battling-with-black-\nfranchisee.html; see also excerpt of the article below (emphasis added). \n105.  In response to McDonald’s racial practices, and Griffis’ situation, the New York \nchapter of the NBMOA also wrote to McDonald’s New York Regional Vice President at the time to \nadvise that, “black McDonald’s owner-operators are primarily confined to ghetto areas and not \nallowed to expand as fast as their white counterparts.”  Id. (emphasis added). \nMCDONALD'S IS BATTLING WITH BLACK FRANCHISEE \n“Charles  Griffis  came  to  California  in \n1977 when he heard he might be able to \nbuy  a  McDonald’s  franchise  in  Santa \nBarbara… It turns out, though, that the \nstore was in Los Angeles on Santa Barbara \nStreet, right in the middle of the ghetto… \nIt was an old store in real bad shape.” \n“. . .[Rev. Jesse] Jackson wrote McDonald’s on behalf of his Operation PUS H to complain that blacks \n  felt they were ‘being subjected to a double standard’ in that they were confined to inner-city areas \nwith high maintenance and security costs, and were usually offered only recycled stores, which \n  are generally more expensive and less profitable than new ones. . .   \n22 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 26 of 51 PageID #:26\n106.  As of the publication of the March 1984 article, there were 137 Black McDonald’s \noperators nationwide, with 267 restaurants, totaling approximately two (2) stores per Black operator, \nas compared to the average of five (5) stores per McDonald’s White operator.  Id. \n107.  Today,  McDonald’s  has  dwindled  down  to  a  similarly  low  number  of  Black \nfranchisees, following false promises of parity and a reverse course back to discrimination.    \n(iii)  McDonald’s Admits Racial Steering and Need for Parity \n \n108.  In the late 1990s, McDonald’s leadership admitted that McDonald’s excluded Black \nfranchisees from franchise opportunities afforded to White franchisees. \n109.  Specifically, through Executive Vice President, Thomas S. Dentice, McDonald’s \nadmitted, “[T]he company has placed many Black Franchisees in restaurants that have not \nallowed them to achieve the same level of economic success as their peers.”  A true and correct \ncopy of the April 18, 1996, Dentice Letter to NBMOA Chairman, Reggie Webb, is attached as \nExhibit “C” hereto, with excerpts quoted below (emphasis added).   \n  I am also highly frustrated that Black \nFranchisees  have been part of the \nMcDonald’s system for almost thirty \nyears  and  as  a  group  have  not \nachieved the same level of success as \nother franchisees that have the same \ntenure.  . . .  [F]or business reasons \nwe thought were valid at the time, \nthe  company  has  placed  many \nBlack Franchisees in restaurants \nthat  have  not  allowed  them  to \nachieve the same level of economic \nsuccess as their peers.   \n \nI am personally tired of this lack of \nprogress by my company.  I am tired \nof being the person that has to listen \nto your calls for help and not seeing \nprogress.    I  am  tired  of  making \nexcuse[s] for myself and others and I \nam tired of working my tail off to \nachieve our mutual goals and being \nconsidered the enemy.  \n23 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 27 of 51 PageID #:27\nThis process will be viewed for what it is; achieving parity for \nour Black Franchisees, not reaching a comfortable financial or \nfranchising solution for the company.   \n*** \nWe may disagree at times on the what’s and how’s as we move \nforward, but I know that we do not and will not disagree on what \nwe want to accomplish-----Parity. \n \n110.  Yet, parity was never truly achieved.  McDonald’s spent the next decade instituting \naspirational and temporary measures and promising Black franchisees, including Plaintiffs, that it \nwas working to achieve parity between Black and White McDonald’s franchisees.  Plaintiffs relied \non these representations and had no reason to believe McDonald’s was discriminating against them. \n111.  On  November  14,  2002,  NBMOA  leadership  addressed  McDonald’s  past \ndiscriminatory practices in a letter from NBMOA Chairman and CEO, Larry C. Tripplett, to NBMOA \n24 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 28 of 51 PageID #:28\nMembership, which described its negotiations with McDonald’s Leadership “to ensure that Parity is \nmet and maintained.”  See Nov. 14, 2002 Tripplett Letter, Exhibit “D” hereto, with excerpts below. \nFirst, let me remind you of what you \nalready  know.    We  are  “Free \nPeople.”    We  have  the  right  to \nexpect  not  to  be  discriminated \nagainst by anyone.  Discrimination \nis illegal in this Country.  We make \nsignificant  contributions  to  the \nMcDonald’s System every day.  In \nsome cases, these contributions are \nmade under very difficult dangerous \nenvironmental circumstances.  We \ndo so proudly and professionally as \nwe all desire the American Dream \nof successful Business Ownership.  \nWe  deserve  and  will  demand \nnothing less than equal treatment.  \nWe must continue to stand United \nand Strong.  We have nothing to \nfear.  \n \nAs  you  are  aware,  the  NBMOA \nExecutive Committee is in earnest \nnegotiations with the Leadership of \nMcDonald’s Corporation to ensure \nthat Parity is met and maintained.  \nWe  believe  that  each  and  every \nAfrican  American  Franchisee \nshould receive real assurances that \n \nwhen  Parity  is  met,  the \ndiscriminatory practices of the past \n \nwill not reoccur.  \n112.  In 2006, after a decade of fighting for parity, Don Thompson became the first Black \nPresident of the Western Division of McDonald’s and went on to serve as the first Black President \nand CEO of McDonald’s from 2012 to 2015.   \n(iv)  Change in McDonald’s Leadership in 2015:  Reverse Course for Black \nFranchisees \n \n113.  In 2015, Easterbrook replaced Thompson as McDonald’s President and CEO, and \nhand-picked Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s current CEO and then President of McDonald’s USA.   \n25 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 29 of 51 PageID #:29\n114.  Under  Easterbrook  and  Kempczinski’s  leadership,  McDonald’s  instituted \ndiscriminatory policies including, but not limited to, rejecting advertising budget modifications to \ntarget  Black  consumers,  denying  Black  franchisees  opportunities  for  growth,  confining  Black \nfranchisees to inner-city or urban areas with higher costs, denying Black franchisees’ requests for \nrent relief, and implementing initiatives such as the Bigger Bolder Vision 2020 (“BBV2020”) \nmodernization plan that negatively and disproportionately impacted Black franchisees, including \nPlaintiffs, in order to force them out the McDonald’s franchise system.  \n115.  These discriminatory practices and policies led to the cash flow gap between Black \nfranchisees in comparison to White franchisees tripling from 2010 to 2019, and a mass exodus of \nmore than half of McDonald’s Black franchisees from the McDonald’s franchise system.   \n116.  On January 7, 2020, two Black McDonald’s senior executives, Victoria Guster-Hines \nand Domineca Neal, filed suit against McDonald’s for intentional racial discrimination,  bringing to \nlight  this  renewed  pattern  and  practice  of  covert  and  systemic  discrimination  against  Black \nfranchisees post-parity.  Guster-Hines v. McDonald’s USA LLC, No. 20-00117, Compl. [D.E. 1] \n(N.D. Ill. Jan. 1, 2020).  \n117.  The Guster-Hines Complaint revealed inside information at the corporate level for the \nfirst  time,  alleging  McDonald’s  deliberately  divested  opportunities  from  Black  franchisees, \nimplemented business plans with a discriminatory impact on Black franchisees, made exceptions for \nWhite Next Generation candidates it did not make for Black candidates, graded Black Consumer \nMarket stores “differently, in a negative way,” and overall abandoned its commitment to racial \nequality on a company-wide basis:  “McDonald’s continuing pattern and practice of intentional race \ndiscrimination [] should outrage everyone, especially those who grew up going to McDonald’s and \nbelieving the ‘Golden Arches’ were swell.”  Id., at ¶¶ 1, 65, 75.  \n26 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 30 of 51 PageID #:30\n118.  The same pervasive racial discrimination, disparate treatment, and substantial wealth \ngap for Black franchisees continues today under the leadership of Christopher Kempczinski.   \n(v)  McDonald’s Leadership is Once Again on Notice of Ongoing Disparate \nTreatment of Black Franchisees; Continues Making False Promises \n \n119.  On March 12, 2019, Tripplett, as Chairman and CEO of the NBMOA, notified \nMcDonald’s  USA  Division  Presidents,  Charlie  Strong  and  Mario  Barbosa,  of  McDonald’s \ndiscriminatory actions, in a letter which raised “serious concerns regarding the status of African \nAmerican Owners within McDonald’s Corporation.”  A copy of the March 12, 2019 Tripplett Letter \nto McDonald’s is attached as Exhibit “E” hereto.  Specifically, Tripplett advised McDonald’s \nleadership  that  “the  trajectory  of  the  treatment  of  African  American  Owners  is  moving \nbackwards.  Through no fault of our own we lag behind the general market in all measures.  This is \nreflected in the loss of sales to African American consumers.  We believe that the loss of sales is \nclosely correlated to how African Americans are treated within the Company.”  Id., at p. 1 \n(emphasis added). \n120.  Tripplett called for “urgent progress now,” given, “[t]he current state of affairs for \nAfrican American Owners [which] can only be described as hostile.”  Id., at p. 3.  The letter ended \nwith a strong call for action:  “[W]e need change now.”  Id.  (emphasis added).   \n121.  On  November  4,  2019,  following  Easterbrook’s  firing,  Tripplett  provided  an \n“Informational Update” to NBMOA Members, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit “F” hereto.  \nTripplett advised NBMOA members that McDonald’s current CEO, Kempczinski, and Joe Erlinger, \nPresident of McDonald’s USA, called him directly to assure him as follows:  “[Kempczinski] \nexpressed his plans to continue to work on our cash flow gaps as he and Steve Easterbrook agreed to \ndo at our convention in Houston,” and “[Erlinger] expressed his desire to work with the NBMOA in \n27 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 31 of 51 PageID #:31\nachieving our initiatives.”  Id., at p. 1.  “We are cautiously optimistic,” Tripplett advised NBMOA \nmembers.  Id.   \n122.  Despite McDonald’s empty promises and assurances to the NBMOA, intended to \ninduce Black franchisees like Plaintiffs to operate its substandard stores, McDonald’s knowingly \ncontinued institutional, systemic, and covert racial discrimination against its Black franchisees. \nC.  “Big Mac Attack” on Black Owner/Operators:   \nMcDonald’s Intentional and Covert Racial Discrimination \n \n(i)  Take it or Leave it:  Steering to High-Cost and Low-Volume Locations \n123.  When Plaintiffs sought entrance into the McDonalds’s franchise system, McDonald’s \nsystematically steered Plaintiffs to stores in Black neighborhoods.  These neighborhoods were the \ntough areas, often filled with high-crime, patrons with little to no means to purchase significant meal \ntickets, leading to low-volume cash sales and high operating costs in the form of higher insurance \nrates, security costs, and employee turnover.   \n124.  McDonald’s offered White franchisees packages with no restraints, on better terms, \nand in better locations than Plaintiffs. \n125.  McDonald’s induced Plaintiffs into purchasing these substandard restaurants by, \namong other things, rushing Plaintiffs, and requiring same-day inspections.  McDonald’s told \nPlaintiffs that it could take months, if not years, to be offered another restaurant if they turned down \na site.  McDonald’s made Plaintiffs believe that these substandard locations were their only way in.  \n126.  For example, during Plaintiff Dominique’s Operator Approval meeting, McDonald’s \nrepresentatives told him they had a restaurant that they felt would be a “good fit” based on his \nbackground in law enforcement.  McDonald’s told Mr. Dominique that they needed an answer \n“ASAP” and asked him to fly down to Atlanta, Georgia that same day to inspect the location.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 32 of 51 PageID #:32\n127.  At the time, the restaurant was owned by another Black franchisee, Plaintiff Van Jakes.  \nThe restaurant was a non-traditional (no drive-through) site in Downtown Atlanta in a high-crime \narea and with a significant homeless population.  As Mr. Dominique later learned, McDonald’s then \nVice-President and General Manager, Debbie Stroud, forced Mr. Jakes out of this restaurant and was \nnow pushing it on to Mr. Dominique as part of McDonald’s fraudulent scheme and pattern of \ndiscrimination, continuing the same perpetual cycle of giving bad restaurants in bad neighborhoods \nto Blacks.   \n128.  Based on McDonald’s misrepresentations and omissions regarding the availability of \nstores, their locations, and future growth opportunities, Plaintiffs believed that if they did not take the \nstore(s) McDonald’s offered them, their chances of entering McDonald’s franchise system would be \nextremely limited.  Plaintiffs relied on McDonald’s representations because they believed that they \nhad equal access to locations within the McDonald’s franchise as Whites. \n129.  Unbeknownst  to  Plaintiffs,  McDonald’s  offered  Black  franchisees  historically \nunderperforming restaurants that White franchisees did not want to purchase.  Conversely, and upon \ninformation and belief, White franchisees were routinely given preferred locations and were able to \nbuy and sell restaurants without restriction, allowing them to prosper. \n130.  Through this process, McDonald’s covertly excluded Plaintiffs from the opportunity \nto purchase restaurants in the open market and deprived Plaintiffs of the ability to achieve the same \nlevel of economic success as White franchisees.   \n131.  Plaintiffs took the bad to get the good, as McDonald’s intentionally misled them by, \namong other things:  (i) providing Plaintiffs with financial representations that McDonald’s knew did \nnot—and could not—accurately reflect the net revenues of the locations it steered Plaintiffs to; (ii) \nassurances that these restaurants would be profitable if Plaintiffs made significant initial investments \n29 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 33 of 51 PageID #:33\nin rebuilds and/or renovations, encouraging debt as part of a fraudulent scheme to force Plaintiffs into \ndebt, bankruptcy, and/or economic duress, and more easily cycle them out of the system; and (iii) \nassurances that any losses would be offset by growth opportunities to better locations, which was the \nkey to any successful McDonald’s franchise model.  \n132.  Even  after  Plaintiffs  entered  the  system  through  these  substandard  locations, \nMcDonald’s continued to deny Plaintiffs the opportunity to own and operate franchises in more \nprofitable locations, unless these more profitable locations were packaged with low-volume, high-\ncost locations.   \n133.  For example, after Plaintiff Mason increased sales in his initial restaurants located \nwithin Walmart stores in the Raleigh/Durham Region with the expectation that he would be given an \nopportunity to purchase a traditional store, McDonald’s again offered Mr. Mason six (6) additional \nWalmart restaurants.  McDonald’s told him that there were no traditional stores available in the \nmarket for him to purchase, which was not true.   \n134.  Marty Ranft, a former QSC VP of the McDonald’s Raleigh/Durham Region, had an \ninventory of McDonald’s restaurants located within Walmart stores that White franchisees in the \nRegion did not want to purchase because these restaurants were historically underperforming stores \ndue to low sales volume and located in substandard locations.  McDonald’s, by and through Mr. \nRanft, steered Plaintiff Mason to an initial 4-store package, take-it-or-leave-it deal, that only included \nWalmart restaurants in the Virginia market located in substandard locations.   \n135.  For no reason other than Mr. Mason’s race, McDonald’s then intentionally limited \nPlaintiff Mason’s ability to grow and expand his franchise organization into traditional stores.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Mr. Ranft was known by McDonald’s to have made derogatory and racist \ncomments about Black McDonald’s employees and franchisees.  For example, and upon further \n30 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 34 of 51 PageID #:34\ninformation and belief, in 2005, Mr. Ranft told McDonald’s senior executive, Vicki Guster-Hines, \nand another Black executive, that “90%” of what the black franchisees had to say about their \nexperiences at McDonald’s was a “goddamn lie,” and, “You are a [N-word] like all the rest – you just \nbelieve you are better cause you are a smart one.”  Guster-Hines v. McDonald’s USA LLC, No. 20-\n00117, Compl. [D.E. 1,], at ¶ 59 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 7, 2020).   \n136.  What is more, Plaintiffs had to risk their own safety in these high-crime areas, often \ncontending with drug dealers selling controlled substances inside and outside the restaurant, vagrants \nhassling customers, multiple incidents of fights, and even a murder in the parking lot of Plaintiff \nCrawfords’ restaurant.   \n137.  Plaintiffs often had to carry licensed firearms for their personal security.  These \ndangerous environments made it difficult for Plaintiffs to attract and retain experienced managers and \nemployees. \n(ii)  McDonald’s Requires Plaintiffs to Make Significant Initial Investments:  \nRebuilds and Renovations \n \n138.  Despite placing Plaintiffs in locations McDonald’s knew could not succeed under its \nown franchise model, McDonald’s required Plaintiffs to invest in rebuilds and/or renovations within \na short time, offering initial short-term lower rent, but then rapidly escalating for the remaining \nfranchise term, setting Plaintiffs up for financial failure.   \n139.  McDonald’s knew or should have known that the rebuilds and/or renovations it \nrequired would not provide increased sales to Plaintiffs’ locations sufficient to offset Plaintiffs’ \nupfront losses.  \n140.  Plaintiffs paid for the costs associated with any rebuilds, renovations, and major \nremodels, often seeking outside financing, and driving them into debt.   \n31 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 35 of 51 PageID #:35\n141.  In certain instances where McDonald’s contributed to the rebuild and/or renovation \ncosts, McDonald’s charged Plaintiffs escalating rent it knew Plaintiffs could not afford.  \n142.  Upon information and belief, White-owner/operators were not immediately required \nto rebuild and McDonald’s placed White owner/operators on a voluntary reinvestment program \nwithout the same time restrictions. \n143.  McDonald’s required Plaintiff Jakes, for example, to make substantial and numerous \nreinvestments in his Panola Road, Georgia restaurant.  During the twenty-two (22) years he owned \nand operated Panola Road, McDonald’s required him to rebuild or reinvest in the store three (3) times.  \nBy contrast, a White owner/operator, Patrick Dennis, was allowed to operate a much older restaurant \njust a few miles down the road from him in Peachtree City, Georgia for years without being required \nto rebuild (e.g., changing green roof to red roof and other modernizations).   \n144.  Similarly, after purchasing the ten (10) stores, Plaintiff Brown was told he had only \nsix (6) months to bring the stores to National Restaurant Brand Standards, even though the stores had \nremained in the same condition for more than five (5) years prior to his ownership. \n145.  Even  McDonald’s  own  McOpCo  stores  were  kept  in  disrepair  for  years  until \nMcDonald’s turned around and immediately required Plaintiffs to reinvest in significant rebuilds \nand/or renovations as a condition of purchase.   \n146.  When McDonald’s forced Plaintiffs out and offered stores to White owner/operators, \nMcDonald’s did not require White owner/operators to immediately reinvest and/or remodel by a \ncertain date.  Upon information and belief, certain restaurants Plaintiffs sold to White owner/operators \nyears ago are in the same condition Plaintiffs left them.   \n147.  On the other hand, in certain cases where McDonald’s offered Plaintiffs’ stores to \nBlack owner/operators, McDonald’s required immediate reinvestment and/or remodels, continuing \n32 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 36 of 51 PageID #:36\nthe same perpetual cycle of giving bad restaurants in bad neighborhoods to Black owner/operators \nand setting them up for financial failure to then force them out and start the cycle again.     \n148.  McDonald’s rebuild and renovation requirements forced Plaintiffs to sink their own \nfunds into locations McDonald’s knew would not provide any return on investment, benefitting only \nMcDonald’s as the owner of the real estate, while driving Plaintiffs into significant debt. \n(iii)  McDonald’s Arbitrarily Denies Plaintiffs Opportunities for Growth \n149.  The economics of owning McDonald’s franchises is to own more than one location so \nthat overhead costs can be absorbed by the multiple locations and yield a profit to the franchise \nowners.   \n150.  McDonald’s knew that to grow a profitable franchise organization in its franchise \nsystem, Plaintiffs needed restaurants with higher sales volume and cash flow to offset the low-\nvolume, high-cost stores it offered them.   \n151.  Yet, McDonald’s refused reasonable proposals from Plaintiffs to expand within the \nMcDonald’s system by opening McDonald’s restaurants at sites Plaintiffs were ready, willing, and \nqualified to operate, offering these profitable locations to White franchisees instead. \n152.  For  no  reason  other  than  Plaintiffs’  race,  McDonald’s  systematically  rejected \nPlaintiffs’ sites and/or failed to provide Plaintiffs with any meaningful assistance to locate better \nrestaurants in better neighborhoods.   \n153.  Plaintiffs would wait years before McDonald’s made an offer for another store, only \nto find out they were offering another “hood” restaurant, meaning it was a low-volume store in an \neconomically distressed community with a high crime rate.  These substandard restaurants were \nconsistently offered to Black owner/operators over White owner-operators.    \n33 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 37 of 51 PageID #:37\n154.  In  certain  instances  where  Plaintiffs  were  given  the  opportunity  to  purchase  a \nprofitable store, it was at a significantly higher premium, with oppressive conditions attached, such \nas an agreement to purchase other substandard locations as part of a “packaged deal.” \n155.  Despite McDonald’s representations and continued assurances to Plaintiffs that it \nwould assist in growth opportunities, McDonald’s continued to intentionally deprive Plaintiffs of any \nmeaningful assistance to find other viable expansion locations over the course of their franchise \nrelationship.  \n156.  Indeed, McDonald’s did the opposite and went as far as to saturate the market and \nencroach upon Plaintiffs’ locations by opening McDonald’s stores just miles apart.   \n157.  While McDonald’s offered impact funds to offset new store competition to White \noperators up front before the new, competing restaurant became operational, Plaintiffs were made to \n“wait and see,” until the actual impact could be assessed.  This forced Plaintiffs to continue to operate \nat a loss, sometimes for more than a year, while they waited for the full impact of the competing \nstores to be realized and assessed. \n(iv)  McDonald’s False Promise of “Rent Relief” and Misleading Financial \nAssistance \n \n158.  Despite  Plaintiffs’  significant  investments  and  hard  work  over  decades  in  the \nMcDonald’s franchise system, when Plaintiffs requested financial assistance to reduce the rent, \nMcDonald’s either denied their requests or rent was temporarily reduced and then escalated causing \nfurther financial harm.   \n159.  McDonald’s knew when it escalated Plaintiffs’ rents that Plaintiffs would not be able \nto pay their rent over the long term, yet McDonald’s refused to provide Plaintiffs with permanent rent \nrelief, even though McDonald’s offered this relief to White franchisees.   \n34 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 38 of 51 PageID #:38\n160.  Through the FDD, McDonald’s provided Plaintiffs with a table of total acquisition \nand development costs, along with Fixed Percentage Rent rates, explaining how McDonald’s sets and \ncontrols these costs and rent rates as follows:  \nThe percentages used in computing monthly payments based on Gross \nSales are determined by McDonald’s management in consideration \nof the rights being granted by the Franchise Agreement, the drawing \npower of the McDonald’s restaurant, the value of the McDonald’s \nSystem as a whole and McDonald’s interests in obtaining a profit in \nlight  of  competitive  conditions.    All  payments  made  by  you  to \nMcDonald’s constitute a single financial arrangement between you and \nMcDonald’s  which,  taken  as  a  whole  and  without  regard  to  any \ndesignation or description, reflect the value of the rights being made \navailable to you by McDonald’s and the services being rendered by \nMcDonald’s during the franchise term.  The percentages may vary \namong franchises depending upon when the franchise was sold as well \nas other factors.  In unusual circumstances that involve special costs, \nthe fees paid by you may be higher than those outlined in this Item 6. \n \n(See FDD, Ex. B, at Item 6) (emphasis added).  \n161.  After  placing  Plaintiffs  in  restaurants  with  no  “drawing  power,”  guided  by \nMcDonald’s own “interests in obtaining a profit,” McDonald’s denied Plaintiffs any legitimate \nfinancial assistance, including, but not limited to, repeated requests for permanent rent reductions, \nfinancial restructuring, and paying for security not required by White owned and operated restaurants.  \n162.  For example, after McDonald’s steered Plaintiff Sims to a one of the most dangerous \nareas of Atlanta, plagued by drugs and prostitution, Mr. Sims asked McDonald’s to pay for an armed \nsecurity guard and provide a permanent rent reduction.  McDonald’s refused.  When Mr. Sims \ndeclined to renew his agreement for this initial, substandard store, McDonald’s began to impose \nescalated inspections of his other restaurants and he suddenly began to have bad business reviews.  \nFinally,  McDonald’s  targeted  Mr.  Sims  under  the  pretext  of  BBV2020  in  order  to  require \nunreasonable renovations and find him in breach for failing to comply.  Like all Plaintiffs named \nherein, McDonald’s kept Mr. Sims on the hook throughout his franchise term through false promises \n35 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 39 of 51 PageID #:39\nand minimal relief efforts, as it drove him further and further into debt, isolating him at every step of \nthe process to then make it easier to force him out once he was no longer profitable to McDonald’s.  \n(v)  Targeted and Unreasonable Inspections and Grading \n \n163.  Once Plaintiffs were in dire financial situations and/or refused to continue operations \nin crime-ridden neighborhoods with low-volume sales, McDonald’s began targeted, rigorous, and \nunreasonable inspections and harsh grading that White franchisees were not subjected to, generating \nnegative business reviews of Plaintiffs’ restaurants.   \n164.  The number of inspections grew exponentially, with close to ten (10) inspections in a \nsingle quarter in certain instances, and the inspections began to take place late at night or at odd hours.   \n165.  Whereas Plaintiffs generally had positive business reviews prior to experiencing \nfinancial hardship and/or rejecting McDonald’s offer to continue to operate in substandard locations, \nthat immediately shifted as McDonald’s began grading Plaintiffs more harshly in business reviews in \na manner that disproportionately impacted Black franchisees as compared to White franchisees.  \n166.  McDonald’s knew and leveraged the fact that Plaintiffs’ eligibility for growth and \nrenewal, or “rewrite,” of their franchise term depended on business reviews and passing inspections. \n167.  By  instituting  harsher  grading  standards  and  through  unreasonable  inspections, \nMcDonald’s negatively impacted Plaintiffs’ performance ratings as pretext for McDonald’s denial of \ngrowth and/or rewrite opportunities.  \n(vi)  No Choice But to Sell:  McDonald’s Forced Exit Scheme  \n168.  Under the oppressive terms of McDonald’s rewrite process, McDonald’s has absolute \nand sole discretion with respect to whether a franchisee may or may not be offered a new term \nfranchise, or “rewrite.”  See McDonald’s U.S. Rewrite (New Term) Policy (“McDonald’s Rewrite \nPolicy”), Exhibit L to the FDD, which is subject to change “in McDonald’s sole discretion.” \n36 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 40 of 51 PageID #:40\n169.  Pursuant to McDonald’s Rewrite Policy, three (3) years prior to the franchise term \nexpiring, the rewrite process begins.  (FDD, Ex. B, at Exhibit L).  McDonald’s controls the rewrite o \nprocess:  Only McDonald’s Rewrite Committee has the authority to offer or decline to offer a new \nterm franchise, the Rewrite Committee’s recommendations are submitted by the Vice President of \nthe  Field  Office  of  the  Rewrite  Committee,  compromised  of  members  of  McDonald’s  U.S. \nmanagement.  Id.  The decision of the Rewrite Committee is final.  Id.  \n170.  When McDonald’s concludes that it will not offer a new term franchise, McDonald’s \nwill extend an “alternative offer, which will give the Owner/Operator the opportunity to sell the \nrestaurant business to a qualified buyer prior to the expiration of the current franchise.  Subject to \nthe terms stated in the alternative offer, which include a release, McDonald’s will commit to offer a \nnew term franchise to the qualified buyer.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \n171.  Plaintiffs with interested buyers were blocked by McDonald’s, who had final approval \nin “qualifying” buyers.  McDonald’s rejected Plaintiffs’ potential buyers without any legitimate \nbusiness justification.  For example, when Plaintiff Christine Crawford presented a list of operators \ninterested in purchasing her restaurants, the general manager of the Atlanta Region, Greg Watson, \ntold Ms. Crawford that she could only offer them to operators who were, “a part of the class picture \nof the region’s future.”  Similarly, in an email from McDonald’s Atlanta Region Vice President, \nValarie Williams, McDonald’s told Ms. Crawford, “The QSC VP will provide names of potential \nbuyers that are supported by the region for you to negotiate the sale of your restaurants.”   \n172.  Because McDonald’s controlled the exit process, there was no way for Plaintiffs to \ngauge what their restaurants could have sold for in an open market.   \n173.  McDonald’s systematically dealt with Plaintiffs on an individual basis to cover up \ntheir discriminatory practices and fraudulent scheme from Black franchisees.   \n37 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 41 of 51 PageID #:41\n174.  McDonald’s led Plaintiffs to believe at all times material hereto that they had no choice \nbut to sell and that their financial losses were caused by Plaintiffs’ individual deficiencies as a “bad \noperators” or operational deficiencies within Plaintiffs’ network of stores.   \n175.  With the looming threat of further financial penalties, and no process for disputing \nqualification denials of buyers in the rewrite process McDonald’s controlled, Plaintiffs could not \nafford to wait for another “qualified buyer,” and were forced to sell their stores at a loss.  \n176.  As a result of McDonald’s discriminatory practices, unfair retaliation, bad faith breach \nof contract, and fraud alleged herein, Plaintiffs have suffered substantial damages in amounts that \nwill be proven at trial, including, but not limited to, lost profits, lost value of the franchise(s), lost \ncapital contributions, lost investments, lost revenue, lost business opportunities, attorneys’ fees, costs, \nand any and all unnecessary out-of-pocket expenses. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nVIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1981 \n(As to Plaintiffs, Christine Crawford, Delores Crawford, Juneth N. Daniel, Yves Dominique, \nVan Jakes, Ralph King, Keith Manning, Kenneth Manning, Dawn Mussenden, Laetitia \nJohnson, Carrie Salone, Floyd Sims, Larry Brown, John Mason, Ronnie Thornton, Lisa \nGunter, Mitchell McGuire, Lois McGuire, Hayes Ferrell, Yvonne Knox, Arthur Scott, Errol \nService, Melvin Jones, George Gipson, Michael Simon, Victor Bruce, David White, John \nTillman, Allen Stafford, Kurt Holloway, Kent Jones, Wise Finley, and Lewis Anderson, \nagainst McDonald’s) \n \n177.  Plaintiffs, Christine Crawford, Delores Crawford, Juneth N. Daniel, Yves Dominique, \nVan Jakes, Ralph King, Keith Manning, Kenneth Manning, Dawn Mussenden, Laetitia Johnson, \nCarrie Salone, Floyd Sims, Larry Brown, John Mason, Ronnie Thornton, Lisa Gunter, f/k/a Lisa \nMcKenzie, Mitchell McGuire, Lois McGuire, Hayes Ferrell, Yvonne Knox, Arthur Scott, Errol \nService, Melvin Jones, George Gipson, Michael Simon, Victor Bruce, David White, John Tillman, \nAllen Stafford, Kurt Holloway, Kent Jones, Wise Finely, and Lewis Anderson, adopt, reallege, and \n38 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 42 of 51 PageID #:42\nincorporate the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 176 of this Complaint as though fully set forth \nherein. \n178.  Plaintiffs are members of a protected class due to their race as Black citizens who have \nthe same right to make and enforce contracts as White citizens pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981.  \n179.  The Franchise Agreements between Plaintiffs and McDonald’s are “contracts” within \nthe meaning of Section 1981, providing that Black citizens have the same right to “the making, \nperformance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, \nterms, and conditions of the [franchise] relationship” as White citizens.  42 U.S.C. § 1981(b). \n180.  McDonald’s  violated  Section  1981  by  denying  Plaintiffs  the  same  franchise \nopportunities made available to White franchisees. \n181.  McDonald’s treated Plaintiffs differently from other similarly-situated franchisees in \ntheir region and nationwide because they are Black, by, including, but not limited to:   \na.  Restricting Plaintiffs to older, recycled restaurants, in poor-performing and \ndangerous locations with high operating costs and low-volume sales;  \n \nb.  Requiring Plaintiffs to invest in rebuilds and/or renovations within short \ntimeframes not required of White franchisees;  \n \nc.  Excluding Plaintiffs from the same growth opportunities offered to White \nfranchisees;   \n \nd.  Failing to provide any legitimate business reasons for repeated denials of \nfranchise opportunities to Plaintiffs over many years; \n \ne.  Denying Plaintiffs meaningful support to allow them to overcome financial \nhardships, while White franchisees were routinely provided such assistance, \nincluding, but not limited to, permanent rent relief and impact funding;  \n \nl.  Depriving  Plaintiffs  of  the  same  legacy  opportunities  offered  to  White \nfranchisees through McDonald’s Next Gen program; \n \nm.  Retaliation against Plaintiffs for rejecting offers to continue operations in \ncrime-ridden  neighborhoods  with  low-volume  sales,  including  through \n39 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 43 of 51 PageID #:43\ntargeted, increased, and unreasonable inspections;  \n \nn.  Disparate treatment with respect to inspections and grading of Plaintiffs’ \nrestaurants as part of a scheme to generate bad business reviews to force \nPlaintiffs out of the McDonald’s system because of their race; and/or \n \no.  Placing Plaintiffs in untenable positions of economic duress, denying them \neligibility for growth and renewal of their agreements, and arbitrarily denying \nfinal approval of their buyers, so that Plaintiffs had no choice but to sell their \nentire franchise organization at a loss or walk away from the business after \ndecades investing in and cultivating their businesses. \n \n182.  By the conduct described above, Defendants intentionally and willfully deprived \nPlaintiffs of the same rights enjoyed by White citizens to be free from racial discrimination in the \nright to enter into contracts and the right to enjoy all of the privileges and benefits of established \ncontractual relationships in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. \n183.  As a direct and proximate result of McDonald’s conduct, Plaintiffs collectively lost \nover two-hundred (200) stores with compensatory damages averaging between four million dollars \n($4,000,000.00) and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per store. \n184.

Daniel, Yves \nDominique, Van Jakes, Ralph King, Keith Manning, Kenneth Manning, Dawn Mussenden, Laetitia \nJohnson, Carrie Salone, Floyd Sims, Larry Brown, John Mason, Ronnie Thornton, Lisa Gunter, f/k/a \nLisa McKenzie, Mitchell McGuire, Lois McGuire, Hayes Ferrell, Yvonne Knox, Arthur Scott, Errol \nService, Melvin Jones, George Gipson, Michael Simon, Victor Bruce, David White, John Tillman, \nAllen Stafford, Kurt Holloway, Kent Jones, Wise Finely, and Lewis Anderson, respectfully request \nthat the Court enter judgment against Defendants awarding Plaintiffs (a) actual damages, (b) special \nor consequential damages in the forms described above, (c) fees and costs of this action, and (d) such \nother and further relief as the Court deems proper. \nCOUNT II \nBAD FAITH BREACH OF CONTRACT \n(As to All Plaintiffs Against Defendants) \n \n185.  Plaintiffs adopt, reallege and incorporate the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 176 \nof this Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n186.  Plaintiffs  entered  into  Franchise  Agreements  to  own  and  operate  McDonald’s \ndomestic franchised restaurants, on the entry dates, and in the locations specified for each Plaintiff \nspecified in paragraphs 26 through 73.   \n187.  Pursuant to Section 3 of the Franchise Agreement, “General Services of McDonald’s,” \nMcDonald’s agreed to, “make available to Franchisee all additional services, facilities, rights, \nand privileges relating to the operation of the Restaurant which McDonald’s makes generally \n41 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 45 of 51 PageID #:45\navailable, from time to time, to all its franchisees operating McDonald’s restaurants.”  (Franchise \nAgreement, Ex. A, at ¶ 3) (emphasis added).   \n188.  McDonald’s further agreed to a reasonableness standard with respect its inspection \nand rebuild rights pursuant to Section 12, “Compliance with Entire System,” as follows:  \nMcDonald’s  shall  have  the  right  to  inspect  the  Restaurant  at  all \nreasonable times to ensure that Franchisee’s operation thereof is in \ncompliance with the standards and policies of the McDonald’s System.  \n \nFranchisee  shall  comply  with  the  entire  McDonald’s  System, \nincluding, but not limited to, the following: (c) Keep the Restaurant \nconstructed and equipped in accordance with the building blueprints \nand  equipment  layout  plans  that  are  standard  in  the  McDonald’s \nSystem or as such blueprints and plans may be reasonably changed \nfrom time to time by McDonald’s. \n \n(Id., at ¶ 12) (emphasis added).   \n \n189.  McDonald’s breached Section 3 of the Franchise Agreement by, inter alia: \na.  Excluding  Plaintiffs  from  growth  opportunities  made  available  to  White \nfranchisees without any legitimate business reason;  \n \nb.  Denying Plaintiffs the same level of meaningful financial assistance offered to \nWhite franchisees, including, but not limited to, permanent rent adjustments \nand impact funding;  \n \nc.  Excluding Plaintiffs from participation in the Next Gen legacy program;  \n \nd.  Disproportionately  imposing  rebuild  and/or  renovation  requirements  on \nPlaintiffs that were not imposed on White franchisees; and/or \n \ne.  Failing  to  approve  reasonable  requests  for  financial  assistance  and/or \nrestructuring plans.   \n \n190.  McDonald’s breached Section 12 of the Franchise Agreement by inter alia: \na.  Demanding  unnecessary  and  unreasonable  rebuilds  and/or  renovations  of \nPlaintiffs’ restaurants in locations that McDonald’s knew would not provide \nany return on investment; and/or \n \nb.  Increased, harassing, and targeted inspections of Plaintiffs’ restaurants.  \n \n42 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 46 of 51 PageID #:46\n191.  Beyond the written terms of the Franchise Agreement, McDonald’s owed a duty of \ngood faith and fair dealing to Plaintiffs in its performance under the Franchise Agreement.  \n192.  In its performance of the Franchise Agreement, McDonald’s violated its duty of good \nfaith and fair dealing by, inter alia: \na.  Engaging in unreasonable and targeted inspections of Plaintiffs’ restaurants; \n \nb.  Applying  harsher  grading  standards  to  Plaintiffs’  restaurants  in  order  to \ngenerate bad business reviews;  \n \nc.  Denying Plaintiffs meaningful financial assistance, including, rent relief and \nimpact money for building new stores within their trade area; \n \nd.  Imposing excessive costs and investments and modifications, including those \nrequired  under  the  BBV2020  plan,  and  then  arbitrarily  reneging  on  the \n“unprecedented investment” promised by McDonald’s through its partnering \nprogram; \n \ne.  Placing Plaintiffs in positions of economic duress and asking Plaintiffs to sign \none-sided release agreements at every step of the franchise relationship; and/or \n \nf.  Forcing Plaintiffs to sell their franchises at a loss after failing to approve \nreasonable requests for financial assistance and/or restructuring plans, that \ncould have resolved any outstanding obligations and debt on one store in the \norganization and allow Plaintiffs to remain in the system.   \n \n193.   As a direct and proximate result of McDonald’s conduct, Plaintiffs collectively lost \nover two-hundred (200) stores with compensatory damages averaging between four million dollars \n($4,000,000.00) and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per store. \n194.  As a direct, proximate, and foreseeable result of McDonald’s breach of contract and \nbad faith, Plaintiffs have incurred substantial damages in amounts that will be proven at trial, \nincluding, without limitation, reasonable compensation for the time and effort expended in planning \nand preparing their franchise business, lost profits, and out-of-pocket expenses they incurred in \npursuing the franchise business, in an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limit, and any applicable \nprejudgment and post-judgment interest.    \n43 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 47 of 51 PageID #:47\nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  enter  judgment  against \nDefendants, awarding Plaintiffs (a) actual damages, (b) special or consequential damages in the forms \ndescribed above, and (c) such other and further relief as the Court deems proper. \nCOUNT III \nFRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT AND FRAUDULENT OMISSION \n(As to All Plaintiffs Against Defendants) \n \n195.  Plaintiffs adopt, reallege and incorporate the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 176 \nof this Complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n196.  As fully set forth above, McDonald’s made misrepresentations of material fact and/or \nfailed to disclose material information, including, but not limited to:  \na.  Representing that the substandard locations it offered Plaintiffs were the only \navailable sites and that other sites were extremely limited;  \n \nb.  Representing  to  Plaintiffs  that  the  financial  performance  of  Plaintiffs’ \nrestaurant locations would be in line with the national average of domestic \ntraditional McDonald’s restaurants opened at least one (1) year prior; \n \nc.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s would require Plaintiffs to rebuild and/or \nremodel their restaurants, with little or no impact on sales, on short timelines, \nand without permanent rent relief;  \n \nd.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s would offer growth opportunities to \nhigher-volume,  lower  cost  locations  to  White  franchisees  over  Black \nfranchisees;  \n \ne.  Representing that Plaintiffs would be given equal opportunity for renewal \nupon expiration of their franchise terms; \n \nf.  Failing to disclose that Plaintiffs’ restaurants would be subject to unreasonable \nand targeted inspections when Plaintiffs experience financial difficulty;  \n \ng.  Failing to disclose that Plaintiffs’ restaurants would be subject to harsher \ngrading than similarly situated franchisees to generate bad business reviews \nwhen Plaintiffs experience financial difficulty; and/or \n \nh.  Failing to disclose that McDonald’s had no intention of qualifying Plaintiffs’ \nready and willing buyers at the point of exit.  \n \n44 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 48 of 51 PageID #:48\n197.  McDonald’s knew or should have known that these representations were false. \n198.  McDonald’s intended that these statements and material omissions would induce \nPlaintiffs to accept substandard locations, invest in significant renovations and/or rebuilds, accept \nunequal terms as part of temporary financial assistance, continue to accept substandard stores as a \ncondition to own and operate profitable stores, accept McDonald’s rewrite denial and sell their stores.   \n199.  Plaintiffs did not know, have reason to know, nor could have discovered, through the \nexercise of reasonable diligence, the falsity of the foregoing misrepresentations and/or omissions \nwhen made. \n200.  As the result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs were unaware, and could not know or \nhave learned through reasonable diligence, that entering the McDonald’s franchise system would \ndeprive them of franchise opportunities offered to White franchisees and that the deprivation of those \ncontractual rights were a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ acts and omissions.  \n201.  Plaintiffs reasonably and justifiably relied upon McDonald’s misrepresentations and \nmade financial decisions to their detriment. \n202.   As a direct and proximate result of McDonald’s conduct, Plaintiffs collectively lost \nover two-hundred (200) stores with compensatory damages averaging between four million dollars \n($4,000,000.00) and five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) per store. \n203.  As  a  direct,  proximate,  and  foreseeable  result  of  McDonald’s  fraudulent \nmisrepresentations and concealment, Plaintiffs have incurred substantial damages in amounts that \nwill be proven at trial, including without limitation, lost profits and other damages in excess of the \njurisdictional limit. \n45 \n \n\nCase: 1:20-cv-05132 Document #: 1 Filed: 08/31/20 Page 49 of 51 PageID #:49\nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  respectfully  request  that  the  Court  enter  judgment  against \nDefendants awarding Plaintiffs (a) actual damages, (b) special or consequential damages in the forms \ndescribed above, and (c) such other and further relief as the Court deems proper. \nCOUNT IV \nPUNITIVE DAMAGES \n(As to All Plaintiffs Against Defendants) \n \n204.  Plaintiffs adopt, reallege, and incorporate each and every allegation in paragraphs 1 \nthrough 176 of the Complaint as if fully restated herein.  \n205.  McDonald’s engaged in willful, wanton, malicious, and or/reckless conduct that \ninjured Plaintiffs in disregard of their protected rights. \n206.  McDonald’s willful, wanton, malicious, and/or reckless conduct includes, but is not \nlimited to, its racially discriminatory practices and fraudulent conduct that resulted in substantial and \nirreparable damages sustained by Plaintiffs.    \n207.  McDonald’s has demonstrated an outrageous conscious disregard for Plaintiffs’ rights \nwith implied malice, warranting the imposition of punitive damages. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment against Defendants and request the following \nrelief from the Court: \na.  Declaration that the acts and practices complained of herein are violations of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1981; \n \nb.
