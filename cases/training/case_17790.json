    "summary": "<p>This case is about discrimination that students with disabilities face in the Oregon Public School system. On January 22, 2019, plaintiffs brought a class-action suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against the Oregon Department of Education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs sought to address the long-standing problem in Oregon of denying students with disabilities the ability to attend a full day of school or, in some cases, the chance to attend school at all.</p>\r\n<p>J.N., the lead plaintiff, was a 6-year-old public school student. He had a disability and was eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA. Due to behaviors related to his disability, J.N. had been subjected to a shortened school day. When he was in kindergarten, J.N. was forced to attend a truncated form of school for the entire 2017-2018 school year. For a few months, this meant that J.N.'s entire day of schooling was only an hour. Other plaintiffs also were subject to shortened school days, including schooling under an hour a day, as a result of their disability.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs argued that the discriminatory consequences of the shortened school day policy violated the IDEA, the ADA, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Under the IDEA, every state has to \"ensure\" that it provides \"special education\" and \"related services\" to all children with disabilities aged 3 to 21 who reside in the state. The IDEA also requires that every child be provided a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Under Title II of the ADA, individuals with disabilities cannot be excluded from participating in, excluded from the benefits of, or be discriminated against in public school. Title II also requires that all students regardless of disability status be provided with an equal education. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that institutions receiving federal funding provide assistance and benefits to individuals with disabilities.</p>\r\n<p>In the complaint, the plaintiffs requested the following relief: a permanent enjoinder of defendants from subjecting the plaintiffs to policies that violate the IDEA, the ADA, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; an order requiring defendants to create and implement new policies that would ensure compliance with FAPE standards; and an order demanding that defendants develop and maintain policies and practices to ensure that the State of Oregon and individual Oregon school districts do not discriminate against students with disabilities, including exclusion of students with disabilities from a full school day. The case was assigned to Judge Ann L. Aiken.</p>\r\n<p>On April 19, 2019, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs responded to this motion, but both parties began to participate in settlement talks in October 2019. However, no settlement agreement was reached, and on February 3, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.</p>\r\n<p>On September 1, 2020, Judge Aiken denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs had standing to proceed. 2020 WL 5209846. The defendants filed their answer to the complaint shortly thereafter. The court then granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification on February 5, 2021. 338 F.R.D. 256. The certified class consisted of \"all students with disabilities aged 3 to 21 residing in Oregon who are eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA and are currently being subjected to a shortened school day or are at substantial risk of being subjected to a shortened school day due to their disability-related behaviors.\"</p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2021, the parties agreed to an interim settlement, under which a neutral expert would evaluate the use of shortened school days and then the parties would negotiate any remedies. The case was stayed while the expert report was pending. On June 30, 2022, the expert submitted their report, which found that shortened school days were harmful to students and that Oregon did not provide enough guidance to school districts on helping students return to full-day instruction.</p>\r\n<p>After failed settlement conferences and ongoing discovery, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings on November 4, 2022. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on March 16, 2023, and the defendants also moved for summary judgment on April 13, 2023.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on August 11, a new Oregon law passed requiring school districts to give parents the right to refuse and to revoke a shortened school day schedule for children with disabilities.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then attended a status conference on September 29, 2023, where the parties agreed to dismiss the defendants&rsquo; motion for judgment on the pleadings until settlement discussions concluded. The parties continued to hold unsuccessful settlement conferences.</p>\r\n<p>On October 27, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were moot because they had been addressed by the new Oregon law and other voluntary changes the Oregon Department of Education had made. On October 30, 2023, the court reinstated the defendants&rsquo; motion for judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of November 18, 2023, the court has not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss or the motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the case is ongoing.</p>",

(“COPAA”) assert \nclaims under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“Title II”), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n(“Section 504”) against the Oregon Department of Education (“ODE”), ODE Director \nand Assistant Superintendent of Public Instruction Colt Gill, and Oregon Governor \nand Superintendent of Public Instruction Katherine Brown.  Defendants move to \nPAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\ndismiss for lack of standing.  For the reasons discussed below, defendants’ Motion \n(doc. 33) is DENIED. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Legal Framework \n  Before turning to the allegations in the Complaint, the Court will provide a \nbrief overview of the three statutory schemes at issue in this case—the IDEA, Title \nII, and Section 504—and the policies that Oregon has adopted to implement its duties \nunder those statutes. \n  A.  IDEA \n  The  federal  Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act  (“IDEA”) \n20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework to meet \nthe educational needs of children with disabilities.  The IDEA was passed in 1975 in \nresponse  to Congress’ perception  that a majority of the approximately 8 million \nAmerican children with disabilities “were either totally excluded from schools or were \nsitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \n‘drop out.’”  Board of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Central Sch. Dist., Westchester Cty. \nv.  Rowley,  458 U.S.  176, 179 (1982)  (alterations  normalized);  see  also  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1400(c)(2).  The IDEA is designed to “ensure that all children with disabilities have \navailable to them a free appropriate education” and “that the rights of children with \ndisabilities and parents of such children are protected[.]”  20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A)–\n(B).  \nPAGE 2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n  To obtain funding under the IDEA, a State  must implement  policies  and \nprocedures  to  ensure a  free  appropriate  public education  (“FAPE”) in  the  least \nrestrictive environment (“LRE”) “to all children with disabilities residing in the State \nbetween the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive[.]”  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A) & (a)(5).  A FAPE \nconsists  of “special education”—instruction specially designed to meet the unique \nneeds of a child with disability—and “related services”—developmental, corrective, \nand other support services as may be required to assist a child to benefit from that \ninstruction.  20 U.S.C. § 1401(9), (29), (26); Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas \nCty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, __ U.S. __, 137 S. Ct. 988, 993–94 (2017).  A least restrictive \nenvironment is to the maximum extent appropriate, a general education in a regular \nclassroom environment.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5).  “[R]emoval . . . occurs only when the \nnature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the \nuse of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.”  Id.  \n  A State receiving funding under the IDEA must formulate an individualized \neducation program, or IEP, for each eligible child.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(4).  The IEP \nsets out a written comprehensive plan to achieve that child’s unique academic and \nfunctional  goals  and  includes  “the  special  education  and  related  services  to  be \nprovided so that [the child] can advance appropriately toward those goals.”  Fry v. \nNapoleon Cmty. Schs., __ U.S. __, 137 S. Ct. 743, 749 (2017); 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d) \n(defining IEP); C.F.R. § 300.320.  The IEP thus serves as the “primary vehicle” for \nensuring each child a FAPE in the least restrictive environment.  Fry, 137 S. Ct. at \nPAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n749.  The IEP is developed by a child’s IEP Team,1 which then reviews and revises \nthe  IEP  to  ensure  compliance  with  a  detailed  set  of  procedures.  \n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(4);  34 C.F.R. §  300.320—300.328.  Further,  the standard  for \ndetermining whether a child receives a FAPE is whether the educational program \noffered to the child via the IEP is “reasonably calculated to enable a child to make \nprogress  appropriate in light of the child’s  circumstances”—a  “standard [that]  is \nmarkedly more demanding” than de minimis progress.  Endrew F., 137 S. Ct. at \n1000—01 (“When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program \nproviding merely more than de minimis progress from year to year can hardly be said \nto have been offered an education at all.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  The IDEA anticipates that a child’s disability-related behaviors may challenge \na State’s ability to provide a FAPE.  20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(5).  Thus, a State, through \nits  local educational agency (“LEA”)—typically a school  district—must  conduct a \nfunctional behavioral assessment  for any child who displays challenging behaviors \ndue to a disability and, as appropriate, for any child removed from school for more \nthan ten school days.  20 U.S.C. § 1415(k)(1)(D)(ii),  (F).  Further, a school may not \nremove a child from a regular education environment unless “the nature or severity \nof the [child’s] disability . . . is such that education in regular classes with the use of \n                                                                 \n  1  The IEP team includes the child’s parents or guardians, special education  teachers, and a \nqualified  local  educational  agency  (“LEA”),  usually  school  district,  representative.    20 U.S.C. \n§ 1414(d)(1)(B).   In developing  the  IEP, the team  must consider  a child’s strengths;  the parents’ \nconcerns “for enhancing the education of their child”; the child’s intial or most recent evaluation; and \nthe child’s academic, developmental,  and functional needs.  20 U.S.C.  § 1414(d)(3)(A).   If the child has \nbehaviors that impede that child’s or other students’ learning, the IEP team must consider “the use of \npositive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies to address that behavior” and the \nneed for communicative assistive devices and services, among other things.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B).    \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nsupplementary  aids  and  services  cannot  be  achieved  satisfactorily.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); 34 C.F.R. § 300.114.   \n  The IDEA accords two distinct procedural safeguards to parents and students \nto challenge a student’s placement or the formulation or implementation of an IEP:  \n(1) an impartial due process hearing before a hearing officer that can be appealed to \nthe state education agency and then to a court 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), (i)(2)(a); and \n(2) a state complaint resolution process before the state education agency, that can \nalso be appealed in a civil action, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(f), (i)(2)(a).  If a parent or other \nperson challenges a child’s program, that child must “stay put” in his or her “current \neducational placement”  unless that child’s  parent requests  otherwise.   34 C.F.R. \n§ 300.518(a).  This guarantee is termed the “stay put” provision.  See Olu-Cole v. E.L. \nHaynes Public Charter Sch., 930 F.3d 519, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (“The purpose of the \nstay-put command is to strip schools of the unilateral authority they traditionally \nemployed to exclude disabled students from school.”) (quoting Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. \n305, 323 (1988)) (alterations normalized) (emphasis in Olu-Cole). \n  Oregon accepts federal funding for special education under the IDEA.  Thus, \nOregon’s state education agency, ODE, must ensure that the LEA’s are providing a \nFAPE to all eligible students.  ODE must monitor the LEAs’ performance, enforce the \nIDEA’s  requirements,  and  obtain  and  provide  technical  assistance.  \n20 U.S.C. § 1416(a)(1) & (3), (e)(1).  Accordingly, Oregon has enacted statutes and \nregulations to comply with those requirements.  See ORS Title 30, Ch. 343 (Special \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nEducation and Other Specialized Education Services); OAR Ch. 581 Div. 15 (Special \nEducation).   \n  Under Oregon’s IDEA framework, each LEA is responsible for evaluating and \ndetermining the eligibility for all children in the district.  OAR 581-015-2105.  The \nLEA must then provide those children a FAPE in the least restrictive environment.2  \nOAR 581-015-2040; OAR 581-015-2240.  Further, LEAs must provide parents an \nopportunity to participate in IEP development, annual IEP review,  and any IEP \nmodification meetings.  OAR 581-015-2190; OAR 581-015-2195.  LEAs must provide \nprior  written  notice  to parents  before  making IEP changes that  affect  a child’s \nplacement.  OAR 581-015-2310.   \n  Oregon has adopted procedures for the two administrative review processes \nrequired by federal law:  a due process hearing before an Administrative Law Judge \nof the Oregon Office of Administrative Hearings, OAR 581-015-2340, OAR 581-015-\n2365; and the “state complaint process” conducted by ODE, OAR 581-015-2030.  \n  B.  Title II of the ADA and Section 504  \n  Title  II of  the  ADA,  42 U.S.C.  §§ 12131  et  seq.,  and  Section  504  of  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, are federal anti-discrimination  laws.  \nUnder Title II, “no qualified individual with a disability  shall, by reason of such \ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \n                                                                 \n  2    OAR  581-015-2240,  modeled  after  20 U.S.C.  § 1412(a)(5)(A),  provides  that  “[t]o  the \nmaximum extent appropriate,  children with disabilities . . . are educated  with children who do not \nhave a disability and [s]pecial classes, separate schooling or other removal of children with disabilities \nfrom the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such \nthat education in regular classes with the use of supplementary  aids and services cannot be achieved \nsatisfactorily.” \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  “A regulation implementing Title II requires a \npublic  entity  to  make  ‘reasonable  modifications’  to  its  ‘policies,  practices,  or \nprocedures’ when necessary to avoid . . . discrimination[]” on the basis of disability.  \nFry, 137 S. Ct. at 749; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  Under Section 504, no person with \ndisabilities  “shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]”   29 U.S.C.  § 794(a).  \nCourts have interpreted Section 504 to require “reasonable modifications to existing \npractices to accommodate persons with disabilities.”  Fry, 137 S. Ct. at 749 (citing \nAlexander  v.  Choate,  469  U.S.  287,  299–300 (1985))  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).   \n  In the context of public education, Title II and Section 504 forbid the denial of \nmeaningful access to public education.3  See A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1204 (9th Cir. 2016) (stating elements of a claim under Title \nII or Section 504 and applying to public education).  Title II and Section 504 thus \nguarantee  equal access  to  public  education;  the  IDEA  guarantees  individually-\ntailored education services and educational benefit from those services.  See Endrew \nF.,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1000 (holding  that  a  FAPE under  the  IDEA must  confer  an \n“educational benefit that is . . . more than de minimis”).  \n                                                                 \n  3  Although Title II and Section 504 differ in several respects, see K.M. ex rel. Bright v. Tustin \nUnified Sch. Dist., 725 F.3d 1088, 1099 (9th Cir. 2013), those differences are not material to this motion \nto dismiss, so plaintiffs’ Title II and Section 504 claims will be addressed together. \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n  Under Section 504, a State must provide a FAPE to all school children with \ndisabilities,  often  implemented  through  an  individualized  Section  504  plan.  \n34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a); see also Mark H. v. Lemahieu, 513 F. 3d 922, 933 (9th Cir. \n2008).  A FAPE under Section 504 consists of special education and related aids and \nservices designed to meet the needs of children with disabilities as adequately as the \nneeds of nondisabled children.  See 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a), (b)(1).  Thus, although a \nSection  504  FAPE is  similar  to  an  IDEA  FAPE,  the  504  FAPE “require[s]  a \ncomparison between  the manner in which the needs of disabled and non-disabled \nchildren are met[.]”  Mark H., 513 F.3d at 933.  But “adopting a valid IEP under the \nIDEA is sufficient to provide a FAPE under Section 504.”  McKnight v. Lyon Cty. Sch. \nDist., 812 Fed. App’x 455, 456 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Mark H., 513 F. 3d at 933); see \nalso 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(b)(2).4   \nII.  Factual and Procedural Background \n  Plaintiffs E.O., J.V., B.M., J.N.,  and COPAA bring this action on behalf of \nthemselves and similarly-situated Oregon students who are eligible under the IDEA, \nTitle II, and Section 504 for special education and related services and “are currently \nbeing subjected to a shortened school day or are at substantial risk of being subjected \nto a shortened school day due to their disability-related behaviors.”  Compl. ¶ 31 \n(doc.1). \n                                                                 \n  4  For the purpose of this motion, the Court will address the IDEA, Title II, and Section 504 \nclaims  together  because,  as  discussed  below,  plaintiffs  allege  a  systemic  failure  of  policies  and \nprocedures that result in unnecessarily shortened school day schedules for children with disabilities—\nan alleged  violation of all three statutes.  See, e.g., Christopher S. ex rel. Rita S. v. Stanislaus Cty. \nOffice of Educ., 384 F.3d 1205, 1208–09, 1212 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that a policy of shortened school \ndays for autistic students violates the IDEA, Title II, and Section 504).   \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n  A.  Individual Named Plaintiffs \n  The four named plaintiffs are Oregon public school students with disabilities \nwho live in small rural districts and are eligible for special education and related \nservices under the IDEA, Title II, and Section 504.  Compl. ¶¶ 55, 67, 79, 91.  They \nallege that their districts have shortened their school days due to their disability-\nrelated behaviors without first providing the supports and services that would enable \nthem to attend a full school day.  Compl. ¶¶ 55, 74, 83, 95.  Although three of the four \nnamed plaintiffs do not presently suffer shortened school days, they have suffered \nshortened school days in the past and they assert that they face a significant risk of \nbeing subjected to an unlawfully shortened school day in the future.  They allege that \ntheir respective districts  delayed, often times for years, the functional behavioral \nassessments that are required for students to receive the supports to address their \ndisability-related  behaviors  and  that  instead  of  providing those  supports,  their \ndistricts shortened their school days—against the wishes of parents and sometimes \nwithout proper IEP documentation.  They also allege that they repeatedly engaged \ntheir districts to obtain those supports only to have them withdrawn even after they \nwere shown to be effective.  In some cases, districts re-instituted supports but only \nafter protracted challenges from parents and advocates.   \n  E.O.,  diagnosed  with  autism  spectrum  disorder  and  attention  deficit \nhyperactivity disorder, now in the fourth grade, currently has a school day shortened \nby thirty minutes.  E.O.’s disability-related behaviors were evident in his first-grade \nyear, but a functional behavioral assessment  was  not done until his third-grade \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nyear—after  he had missed  a  significant amount  of  school because  he had  been \nsuspended or sent home from school because of his behaviors.  By that time, his school \nday had been reduced to a half-day, which the district failed to document in his IEP.  \nAfter an attorney intervened, the district increased E.O.’s school day to its present \nlength.  But the district has still not provided him additional supports to ensure he is \nsuccessful during his longer school day, and he fears his school day will be reduced \neven more in the future.  \n  J.N.,  diagnosed  with  hearing  impairment,  anxiety,  hyperactivity,  and \ndevelopmental delay, had his school day reduced to a single hour within the first three \nweeks of first grade.  He was then denied behavioral supports and communication \ntechnology support related to his hearing impairment for over a year.  After J.N.’s \nmother filed an administrative complaint and after J.N. was started on medication, \nthe district agreed to increase his school day, but the district has yet to provide the \nbehavioral supports J.N. needs to succeed at a full day.  Further, J.N.’s medication \ncauses him to fall asleep during school, and his teachers and school staff do not wake \nhim.  \n  J.V., diagnosed with autism, began receiving IDEA-required special education \nand related services before kindergarten.  But on the first day of kindergarten, J.V.’s \ndistrict reduced him to a two-hour school day due to disability-related behaviors  \nwithout conducting a functional behavioral assessment to see if additional supports \ncould help.  Instead, the district recommended residential placement.  J.V.’s mother \nobtained legal counsel that persuaded  the district  to provide  supports  including \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\ncommunication  technology,  which  proved  to  be  effective,  but  the  district  later \nwithdrew them.  J.V.’s mother then filed an administrative complaint.  In response, \nthe district provided J.V. a communication device, consultation with a behavioral \nexpert, and a full school day.  J.V., now a second-grader, fears that those supports \nwill be again be withdrawn and his school day will again be shortened. \n  B.M.,  diagnosed  with  autism  spectrum  disorder  and  epilepsy,  repeatedly \npetitioned his district for an autism or behavioral specialist and a communication \ndevice that his IEP team determined he “urgently needed.”  Compl. ¶ 97.  Because \nthe district would not provide those supports and instead cut his school day to 30 \nminutes  and  because  B.M.’s  communication  skills  and  behaviors  severely \ndeteriorated,  he  retained  an  attorney.    That attorney  and  the  district’s  special \neducation director wrote to ODE explaining that the district lacked the expertise and \nresources to meet B.M.’s and similar students’ behavioral needs.  ODE failed to assist \nB.M.’s district and, in response to B.M.’s administrative complaint, disavowed prior \nsubstantial knowledge of and any responsibility for B.M.’s situation.  Even though \nB.M. prevailed at the administrative hearing, his district  allowed  him to attend \nschool only once, provided him a handful of home tutoring sessions, and removed him \nfrom the school’s  roster for failure to attend.  As a result, B.M. was  placed in a \nresidential facility in another school district.  The State no longer monitors B.M.’s \nsituation to determine whether he receives a FAPE.  \n \n \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n  B.   COPAA \n  COPAA is a national non-profit consisting of parents  of and advocates for \nchildren with disabilities.  COPAA’s mission is to protect and enforce the legal and \ncivil rights of students with disabilities and their families.  One of COPAA’s primary \ngoals is to secure appropriate educational services for children with disabilities in \naccordance with federal laws.  Members of COPAA include the parents of, attorneys \nfor, and advocates for the named plaintiffs and the proposed plaintiff class. \n  C.  Defendants \n  Defendants include ODE, the state educational agency (“SEA”) for Oregon; \nColt Gill,  Director  of  ODE and  Deputy Superintendent  of Public Instruction for \nOregon; and Katherine Brown,  Governor of Oregon and Superintendent of Public \nInstruction for Oregon.5   \n  As SEA for Oregon, ODE has primary responsibility under the IDEA for the \nsupervision of public elementary and secondary schools in Oregon and the provision \nof a FAPE in the least restrictive environment.  ODE is also a public entity covered \nby Title II and a recipient of federal financial assistance subject to Section 504. \n  In  their  roles  as  Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction  and  as  Deputy \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction and ODE Director,  respectively, defendants \nBrown  and  Gill  are  responsible  for  supervising  and  directing  ODE’s  services, \nprograms, and activities; supervising all special education programs administered by \n                                                                 \n  5  In this opinion,  defendants  will  generally  be referred  to collectively,  and  ODE  will be \nidentified  by name where appropriate,  for example, when discussing actions taken by the agency or \nits employees. \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nother state agencies; and coordinating with other public agencies as needed to ensure \nthat  eligible students  receive the  services  required  by the  IDEA.    OR.  CONST. \nArt. VIII, § 1; ORS 326.300; ORS 326.310; ORS 343.041; 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(12)(A). \nSTANDARDS \n  When a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the action must be dismissed.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  A challenge to standing is appropriately raised under Rule \n12(b)(1).  Chandler v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. \n2010).  Plaintiffs, as the party seeking to invoke subject matter jurisdiction of the \nCourt, have the burden of establishing standing.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 561 (1992).  “A Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be facial or factual.”  \nSafe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  \nA  facial  attack  disputes  whether  the  allegations  contained  in  a  complaint  are \nsufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction.  Id.  By contrast, a factual attack disputes \nthe truth of those allegations.  Id. \nDISCUSSION \n  Plaintiffs bring claims under the IDEA, Title II of the ADA, and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act alleging a systemic failure of policies and procedures that deny \nthem a FAPE and that result in discrimination.  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the \nstate  of  Oregon  has  known  for  years  that  many  Oregon  public  schools  have \n“unnecessarily and unlawfully shortened the school day” for children with disability-\nrelated behaviors.  Compl. ¶¶ 1, 105–111.  Plaintiffs allege that the State has an \naffirmative statutory duty to monitor and assist the school districts and enforce the \nPAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nIDEA, Title II, and Section 504 provisions, and that the State has failed to fulfill its \nstatutory duty under these statutes due to several systemic deficiencies.  Plaintiffs \nfurther  allege  that  these  deficiencies  have  resulted  in  a  FAPE  denial  and \ndiscrimination to the named plaintiffs and others like them.  They seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief. \n  Defendants challenge plaintiffs’ standing to sue.  “The purpose of the standing \ndoctrine is to ensure that the plaintiff has a concrete dispute with the defendant, not \nthat the plaintiff will ultimately prevail against the defendant.”  Hall v. Norton, 266 \nF.3d 969, 976–77 (9th Cir. 2001).   \n  To demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an injury in fact that is \nconcrete  and particularized,  and actual  or  imminent;  (2)  fairly  traceable to  the \nchallenged conduct of the defendant;  and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable \njudicial decision.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, __ U.S. __, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547–48 (2016) \n(citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61).  Each prong must be established “with the manner \nand degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561.  “At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting \nfrom the defendant’s conduct may suffice[.]”  Id.   When, as here, defendants make a \nfacial challenge to standing, the Court must accept plaintiffs’ allegations as true and \ndetermine  whether  they  sufficiently  allege an  injury resulting  from  defendants’ \nconduct.  Id.   \n  “In a class action, standing is satisfied if at least one named plaintiff meets the \nrequirements.”  Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007). \nPAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nA.  Individual Named Plaintiffs \n  Defendants argue that:  (1) although E.O.’s school day is currently shortened, \nhe suffers no actual injury; (2) the other named plaintiffs suffer no imminent harm \nbecause state  and federal laws  provide procedural safeguards against unlawfully \nshortened school days; (3) the alleged injuries are not “fairly traceable” to defendants’ \nactions nor are they likely to be redressed by defendants because the harm depends \non the independent actions of school districts and parents, and the complaint itself \ndemonstrates  that the state’s  existing procedures are effective;  and (4) plaintiff’s \nrequested relief is too broad and too vague.  \n    1.  Injury \n  The denial of a FAPE and disability-based discrimination are injuries to a \nstudent sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the standing inquiry.  See e.g., Brooke \nM. ex rel. Stacey M. v. Alaska Dep’t of Educ. & Early Dev., 293 Fed. App’x  452, 454 \n(9th Cir. 2008) (finding standing for a plaintiff who alleged that defendant’s “conduct \ndeprived her of the free appropriate public education that IDEA guarantees”); Rivera \nv. Fremont Union High Sch. Dist., No. 5:12-cv-05714-EJD, 2013 WL 4674831, at * 2 \n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 30, 2013) (holding that a plaintiff’s allegation of FAPE denial “would \nlikely  constitute  the  requisite  injury”  sufficient  to  confer  standing);  Paul  G.  v. \nMonterey Peninsula Unified Sch. Dist., 256 F. Supp. 3d. 1064, 1071 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \n(holding  that  a plaintiff’s  allegation of  FAPE denial  was  sufficient  to  establish \nstanding in facial challenge). \nPAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n  Here, plaintiffs’ allegations that they suffer an unlawfully shortened school \nday, thus loss of instructional time, constitutes a denial of a FAPE.  See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1412(a)(5)(A) and OAR 581-015-2240 (providing that a FAPE in the least restrictive \nenvironment requires that “[s]pecial classes, separate schooling, or other removal of \nchildren with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the \nnature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the \nuse of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily”).  Although \na shortened school day is not a per se violation of the IDEA, plaintiffs allege that their \nshortened school day programs were “inappropriate” and “unnecessary” because their \ndistricts  shortened  school  days  without  satisfying  the  IDEA’s  procedural \nrequirements.  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the districts failed to first consider \nand provide supplementary aids and services that could enable the students to attend \na full day, Compl. ¶ 50, 59, 76, 77, 86, 97, and that, in some cases, the districts failed \nto adequately document the shortened school days in students’ IEPs and 504 plans, \nid. ¶¶ 48, 74. \n  Plaintiffs further allege that, as a result, they have been unable to access an \neducation and have fallen behind “academically and behaviorally.”  Id. ¶ 52.  E.O. \n“has academic needs that are not being met,” and he “[has] experienced gaps in his \nlearning.”  Id. ¶¶ 73, 75.  He has become socially isolated and has lost his school \nfriends because he was deprived of developing self-regulation skills.  Id. ¶ 78.  J.N.’s \nacademic  and  behavioral progress  was  impaired,  id. ¶  64,  he  was  “emotionally \ndevastated” from being excluded (“that’s [the school] where they hurt me”), id., and \nPAGE 16 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nwas transferred to a new school where he now sleeps through his classes undisturbed \nby teachers  and “has . . . missed  hours of instruction  daily even while  physically \npresent at school[,]” id. ¶¶ 65, 66.  J.V. who, in the first grade, was placed on a two-\nhour day and in a completely isolated 8’ x 16’ workspace, “regressed in his verbal and \nsocial communication skills” and his autistic behaviors worsened.  Id. ¶¶ 84–86.  And, \nlike B.M., who was institutionalized, “some students fall so far behind academically \nand  behaviorally . . . that  their  districts  eventually choose  to  deny them . . . any \neducation at all.”  Id. ¶ 52. \n  Accordingly, plaintiffs have alleged they have been denied a FAPE because of \nprocedural inadequacies that resulted in the loss of educational opportunities and the \ndeprivation of educational benefits.  L.M. v Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist., 556 F.3d \n900,  909  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (“Procedural  inadequacies  that  result  in  the  loss  of \neducational opportunity . . . clearly result in the denial of a FAPE[]” under the IDEA); \nN. B. v. Hellgate Elem. Sch. Dist., ex rel. Bd. of Directors, Missoula Cty., Mont., 541 \nF.3d 1202, 1207–08 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding that “procedural inadequacies that result \nin the loss of educational opportunity . . . or that cause[] a deprivation of educational \nbenefits[]” constitute denial of a FAPE under the IDEA). \n  Defendants argue that E.O.’s currently shortened school day is not an “actual” \ninjury  because  E.O.  has  not  challenged  his  current  IEP  through  ODE’s \nadministrative remedies.  At oral argument, defendants clarified that they are not \narguing that E.O.’s  claims should be dismissed  because he failed to exhaust his \nadministrative  remedies,  but instead reason  that E.O.  has not plausibly alleged \nPAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\ninjury because, if he were to file a complaint with ODE, he might obtain relief through \nthe administrative process.  The Court disagrees.  E.O. has adequately alleged denial \nof a FAPE because he has been deprived of educational benefit due to the loss of \ninstructional time.  That E.O. could obtain relief for an injury through some other \navenue does not render that injury speculative or implausible.  See Paul G., 256 F. \nSupp. 3d at 1071 (holding that an administrative “finding [of a FAPE denial] is not \nnecessary to plausibly allege injury for the purpose of standing”).   \n  Defendants also argue that J.N., J.V., and B.M.’s allegations of future harm \nare  speculative  because  state  and  federal  laws  provide  safeguards  against  the \nimposition of unlawfully shortened school days.   \n  Defendants contend that J.N., J.V., and B.M.’s allegations of a future FAPE \ndenial are speculative because Oregon’s recently-enacted Abbreviated School Day \nstatute, ORS 343.161, prohibits a school district from shortening a student’s school \nday unless  that student’s  IEP team  determines  that  a shortened  school  day  is \nappropriate based on the student’s needs and has “considered at least one option that \nincluded appropriate supports for the student and that could enable the student to \naccess” a full-length school day.  ORS 343.161(3)(a).  \n  But plaintiffs allege they were placed on shortened school-day schedules and, \nthus denied a FAPE, even after the Abbreviated School Day statute went into effect \non July 1, 2017.  In December 2017, E.O. was placed on a half-day schedule, which \nhis district failed to document in his IEP.  Compl. ¶ 74.  J.N.’s district reduced his \nschool day to one hour in September 2017, id. ¶ 59, and increased his school day to \nPAGE 18 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\njust over two hours in January 2018 without implementing supports, id. ¶¶ 60, 61.  \nJ.V.’s district lengthened his school day from two to three hours (still denying him a \nfull day) in September 2017 and withdrew the supports that he had used successfully \nthe year before.  Id. ¶ 88.  B.M.’s district allowed him to attend school only one day of \nthe 2018–19 school year, removed him from the roster, and failed to replace the home-\ntutor when she quit.  Id. ¶ 103.  It does not appear that the Abbreviated School Day \nstatute has stopped school districts from unnecessarily shortening students’ school \ndays. \n  Defendants  also  contend  that  the  allegations  of  future  FAPE denial  are \nspeculative  because  the  IDEA’s  “stay-put”  provision  prohibits  a  district  from \nchanging a child’s “current educational placement” during administrative or judicial \nreview of a new IEP.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j).  But plaintiffs allege that this provision \nhas perpetuated the harm caused by a district’s FAPE denial.  Each student alleges \nthat he was  effectively “stayed put” in unnecessarily shortened school schedules, \nseparated from peers, and sometimes isolated while waiting for delayed behavioral \nassessments or while their parents’ administrative complaints were pending.  \n  E.O. remained on a half-day schedule against his mother’s wishes and without \nIEP documentation until an attorney intervened, after which the district lengthened \nhis day.  Id. ¶¶ 73–74, 76.  J.N. remained on a one-hour school day against his \nmother’s wishes and without behavioral assessment or plan for five months, id. ¶ 59–\n61, then a two-hour day for months until his mother filed a complaint, id. ¶ 62, and \nnow, although attending all day with medication, has yet to receive supports.  Id. ¶ \nPAGE 19 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n66.  J.V. remained on a two-hour school day against his mother’s wishes and without \nbehavioral assessment or supports, id. ¶ 83, then sent home with infrequent tutoring \nsessions while the district evaluated a residential placement for him.  Id. ¶ 86.  J.V. \nstayed home until his mother retained an attorney.  Id. ¶ 87.  B.M. remained on a \nthirty-minute school day without the supports he needed, id. ¶ 95, then sent home, \nid. ¶¶ 97–99, where he stayed until his mother prevailed in the administrative review \nprocess.  Id. ¶ 102–103.  It appears that the stay-put provision has not protected \nplaintiffs from being placed on unnecessarily shortened school day schedules and \ninstead has the potential to lock students into unnecessarily shortened school day \nschedules while parents and advocates seek recourse. \n  The Court concludes that E.O. sufficiently alleges that he suffers an actual \ninjury and that J.N., J.V., and B.M., who have yet to receive the supports they need \nto succeed at full-day school and whose previously non-compliant districts are not \nbeing  monitored,  are  at  risk  of  imminent  future  harm  from  again  suffering \nunnecessarily shortened school days. \n    2.  Causation \n  To establish causation, the second prong of standing, a plaintiff’s injury must \nbe “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the \nindependent action of some third party not before the court.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–\n61 (alterations normalized).  “The line of causation between the defendant’s action \nand the plaintiff’s harm must be more than attenuated.”  Washington Envtl. Council \nv. Bellon, 732 F.3d 1131, 1141 (9th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks  omitted).  \nPAGE 20 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nBut a “causal chain does not fail simply because it has several links, provided those \nlinks are not hypothetical or tenuous and remain plausible.”  Id. at 1141–42 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \n  Plaintiffs allege that they have been denied educational instruction and needed \nsupports  and that they are inappropriately excluded from the classroom because \ndefendants do not adequately supervise and monitor school districts or enforce the \nIDEA, Title II, and Section 504. \n  Defendants argue that the causal chain is too attenuated because plaintiffs’ \ninjuries turn on the independent actions of the districts and the parents.  Defendants \nassert that, before a student can be placed on a shortened school day, a district must \nviolate state and federal law and a student’s parent must fail to invoke the existing \nadministrative remedies.   \n  A defendant  need  not  be the  “sole  source”  of  harm,  nor must  a plaintiff \n“eliminate any other contributing causes to establish its standing.”  Barnum Timber \nCo. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 633 F.3d 894, 901 (9th Cir. 2011).  Traceability is satisfied \nwhen a plaintiff’s standing theory of causation “relies . . . on the predictable effect of \nGovernment action on the decisions of third parties.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, \n___U.S.___, 139 S. Ct. 2552, 2566 (2019); see also Oregon Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 \nF.3d 1101, 1105 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that harm to mentally-incapacitated criminal \ndefendants held in county jails was fairly traceable to the failure of the State’s mental \nhospital to timely accept them for treatment).  Here, plaintiffs assert that the IDEA \nimposes an affirmative statutory duty on the State to monitor and assist the districts \nPAGE 21 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nand enforce the provision of a FAPE and that their injuries are fairly traceable to the \nState’s failure to do so.  Compl. ¶¶ 41, 47, 112–29.   \n  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the State (1) lacks policies and procedures to \nrequire  the districts  to  systematically  collect  and report  data  on students  with \nshortened  school  days,  Compl.  ¶¶  115–17;  (2)  lacks  policies  and  procedures  to \nsystematically monitor school districts’ compliance with federal and state statutes \ninstead  of  relying  solely  on  haphazard  administrative  complaints  to  identify \nnoncompliant districts and correct violations, id. ¶¶ 119–122; and (3) fails to provide \nthe districts “adequate resources, technical assistance, and training to prevent the \nunnecessary use of shortened school days[,]” id. ¶ 123.  Plaintiffs further allege that \n“the  State’s  education  funding  formula  rewards  school  districts  that  impose \nshortened school days by paying them the same amount for providing a student with \none of hour of tutoring as it would if that student had received a full day of instruction \nin school.”  Id. ¶ 53.  In sum, plaintiffs argue that the districts’ failure to provide a \nFAPE are a “predictable effect” of Government action, in this case the State’s failure \nto develop and implement effective policies to hold the districts accountable and to \nprovide  badly-needed  assistance.    See  Dept.  of  Commerce,  139  S.  Ct.  at  2566.  \nPlaintiffs also assert that the State cannot simply point to administrative remedies \nwhen those remedies have proved inadequate to stop districts from denying FAPE by \nimposing unlawfully shortened school days.6   \n                                                                 \n  6  Defendants  argue that the Complaint  demonstrates  that “existing  [state  administrative \nreview] policies are effective”  to prevent IDEA violations  by school districts because plaintiffs  allege \nthat they “obtained  relief from inappropriate  use of an abbreviated  school day program after filing \nadministrative complaints with ODE.”  Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss 14 (doc. 33).  The Court disagrees.  That \nPAGE 22 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\n  The Court agrees.  The IDEA expressly provides that the State of Oregon, in \nexchange for receiving federal funding, is responsible for ensuring that all qualified \nchildren with disabilities receive a FAPE.   20 U.S.C. § 1412.  The IDEA’s monitoring, \nenforcement, and assistance provisions contemplate that a State has control or should \nhave control over the districts.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1416(a)(1) & (3) (requiring States to \nmonitor  and  enforce  implementation  of  the  IDEA and  to  use  quantitative and \nqualitative indicators to ensure that LEAs provide a FAPE in the least restrictive \nenvironment);  20 U.S.C. § 1416(e)(1)  (requiring  States  to  work  with  “technical \nassistance  providers”  and  to  identify  and  implement  professional  development, \ninstructional strategies, and methods of instruction that are scientifically-based to \nensure that a FAPE is provided); see also Cordero v. Penn. Dep’t of Educ., 795 F. \nSupp. 1352, 1362 (M.D. Pa. 1992) (explaining that a State’s duty under the IDEA \n“amounts to more than creating and publishing some procedures and then waiting \nfor the phone to ring[]”).  Thus, although school districts formulate and implement \nIEPs, the State has an affirmative statutory duty to monitor, investigate, and enforce \nthe IDEA requirements and to assist the districts to ensure that they comply with \n                                                                 \nODE has recognized during administrative review that districts have inappropriately  used shortened \nschool days and, therefore, violated the IDEA does not mean that those review procedures are effective \nto prevent IDEA violations.  Indeed, plaintiffs’ allegations, Compl. ¶¶ 62–66, 89–90, 102–04, that they \nexperienced unnecessarily shortened school days and were denied needed supports and services before \nand after  administrative  review,  when accepted  as true, leads  to the conclusion  that the existing \nreview procedures are not effective to prevent IDEA violations by school districts.  Moreover, plaintiffs’ \nallegations suggest that, even when ODE recognized a violation and ordered a school district to comply \nwith the IDEA, plaintiffs’ injuries were not always remedied.  J.N. prevailed in his complaint and even \nthough he attends a full day, has been placed in a separate  classroom for students with behavioral \nneeds  and has yet to receive any support  other than medication,  which often causes  him to sleep \nthrough school.  Id. ¶ 65.  B.M. prevailed in his administrative complaint, yet, his school only allowed \nhim to  attend  one  day,  removed  him from  the  roster,  failed  to  sustain  his  home-tutoring,  and \ndischarged him to a residential facility.  Id. ¶¶ 103–104. \n \nPAGE 23 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nstate and federal law.  The Court concludes that the plaintiffs sufficiently allege that \ntheir harm is fairly traceable to the State’s failure to fulfill its statutory duty to \nensure that the school districts provide plaintiffs a FAPE. \n    3.  Redressability \n  The  final  standing  prong  is  redressability.    “To  establish  Article  III \nredressability,  the  plaintiffs  must  show  that  the  relief  they  seek  is  both  (1) \nsubstantially likely to redress their injuries; and (2) within the district court’s power \nto  award.”    Juliana  v.  United  States,  947  F.3d  1159,  1170  (9th  Cir.  2020).  \n“Redressability does not require certainty, but only a substantial likelihood that the \ninjury will be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Bellon, 732 F.3d at 1146.  A \nplaintiff  “need  not show  that  a favorable decision  will  relieve his  every  injury.”  \nMassachusetts v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007) (quoting Larson v. \nValente,  456 U.S. 228, 244,  n.15  (1982))  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted) \n(emphasis in original).  A slowing or reduction in harm may satisfy redressability.  Id. \nat 525–26.  “Agencies, like legislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in \none fell regulatory swoop.”  Id. at 524.   \n  Plaintiffs seek both declaratory and injunctive relief.  They ask the Court to \ndeclare the State in violation of state and federal law because it has failed to ensure \nplaintiffs a FAPE.  Plaintiffs also ask the Court to enjoin the State from subjecting \nplaintiffs to policies and practices that violate their rights under the statutes and to \norder the State to “develop, adopt, and implement policies and practices” that will \nPAGE 24 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nensure that the districts provide to all eligible children a FAPE in the least restrictive \nenvironment.  Compl. at p. 48.   \n  Under the IDEA, courts are authorized to fashion the relief that is appropriate, \nbased on the facts in each case.  20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); 34 C.F.R. § 300.516(c)(3).  \nThis may include injunctive, declaratory, or other relief.  Id.; see, e.g., Emma C. v. \nEastin, 673 Fed. App’x 637, 639–40 (9th Cir. 2016) (affirming the district court’s \njurisdiction under a Consent Decree to order California to develop and implement a \nstatewide  plan to satisfy the IDEA’s monitoring requirements); D.L. v. District of \nColumbia, 860 F.3d 713, 719 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (upholding, in an IDEA class action, the \ndistrict court’s “programmatic” injunction requiring the District of Columbia to “set \ncompliance benchmarks” and show “annual improvement in the numbers of children \nidentified  as  needing,  evaluated  for,  and  offered  special  education  and  related \nservices[]”); Corey H. v. Bd. of Educ. Of City of Chicago, 995 F. Supp. 900, 918 (N.D. \nIll. 1998) (requiring Illinois, in an IDEA class action, to submit a comprehensive plan \nfor  monitoring  school  districts’  compliance  with  the  IDEA’s  least  restrictive \nenvironment requirements);  Morgan Hill  Concerned Parents Assoc.  v.  California \nDept. of Educ., No. 2:11-cv-3471-KJM-AC, 2013 WL 1326301 at *8 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 29, \n2013) (“[T]he injury is redressable because the abdication of [California’s duty to \nmonitor  district  compliance  under  the  IDEA] is  alleged to  be  ongoing, and the \ninjunctive relief requested could cause those children currently denied FAPE to be \nprovided FAPE in the future.”).  Thus, it is within the Court’s power to shape relief \nPAGE 25 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nto address the particular ongoing systemic deficiencies that plaintiffs allege is the \ncause of the harm they suffer. \n  Defendants argue that redressability is not sufficiently alleged because, here, \nredress turns on the actions or inactions of independent third parties (the districts \nand the parents) who are not before the Court.  As discussed above, regardless of the \nactions  of  the  districts  and  the parents,  the State  is  ultimately responsible  for \nensuring that all children with disabilities receive a FAPE.   \n  Defendants also argue that the requested relief is too broad because it would \naffect  all  Oregon children with  disabilities,  not just  plaintiffs,  and is  too vague \nbecause  plaintiffs  have  not  identified  particular  defective  policies.    The  Court \ndisagrees.  Plaintiffs challenge a statewide failure to effectively implement the IDEA, \nTitle  II,  and  Section  504,  which  necessarily  affects  all  Oregon  children  with \ndisabilities.  The ultimate scope of the remedy involves determinations that can only \nbe made after all parties have presented their evidence at trial.    \n  In sum, the individual named plaintiffs sufficiently allege all three standing \nprongs:  injury in fact, traceability, and redressability.  \n  B.  COPAA’s Associational Standing \n  An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (1) \n“its members  would  otherwise  have standing to sue in their own  right,” (2) “the \ninterests at stake are germane to the organization’s purpose,” (3) and “neither the \nclaim  asserted  nor  the  relief  requested  requires  the  participation  of  individual \nmembers in the lawsuit.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), \nPAGE 26 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nInc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (citing Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising \nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs have \nalleged the second and third requirements for associational standing.  This Court \nfinds  that  the  interests  at  stake  are  germane  to  COPAA’s  mission  to  secure \nappropriate educational services for children with disabilities and that the requested \nequitable relief does not require individual members’ participation in this suit. \n  Instead,  defendants  argue that the  Complaint  does  not demonstrate  that \nCOPAA’s members  would  have standing to  sue  in their  own  right  because the \nComplaint fails to identify at least one COPAA member who “ha[s] suffered or will \nsuffer harm.”  Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss 12 (doc. 33) (quoting Assoc. Gen. Contractors of \nAmerica  v.  Dept.  of  Transp.,  713  F.3d  1187,  1194  (9th  Cir.  2013)  (alterations \nnormalized).  And, although defendants do not dispute that denial of FAPE to a child \nis also harm to the child’s parent, they argue that “the complaint does not allege that \nany COPAA member is a parent of a child who has been denied FAPE.”  Def.’s Reply \nto Mot. to Dismiss 11 (doc. 47). \n  The Ninth Circuit does not require an association to name a specific member \nin its complaint “[w]here it is relatively clear . . . that one or more members have been \nor will be adversely affected by a defendant’s action, and where the defendant need \nnot know  the identity of  a particular  member to understand and respond  to an \norganization’s  claim  of  injury[.]”    Nat’l  Council  of  La Raza  v.  Cegavske, \n800 F.3d 1032, 1041  (9th Cir.  2015).    Plaintiffs  allege  that  “COPAA’s  members \ninclude parents, attorneys, and advocates of the Named Plaintiffs and members of \nPAGE 27 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nthe Plaintiff class.”  Compl. ¶ 131.  Under the IDEA, denial of a FAPE to a child is \nalso an injury to a parent.  Winkelman ex rel. Winkelman v. Parma City Sch. Dist., \n550 U.S. 516, 531 (2007); see also Blanchard v. Morton Sch. Dist., 509 F.3d 934, 938 \n(9th Cir. 2007) (holding that a mother is “a proper plaintiff [under Title II and Section \n504], at least insofar as she is asserting and enforcing the rights of her son and \nincurring expenses for his benefit[]”).  Because the named plaintiffs allege that they \nare either currently being denied a FAPE or at substantial risk of being denied one \nand because parents of those plaintiffs are among COPAA’s members, it is relatively \nclear that one or more COPAA members has suffered or will suffer harm from the \nalleged failure of the State to enforce the IDEA, Title II, and Section 504.  Thus, \nCOPAA sufficiently alleges standing. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have \nplausibly alleged standing.  Accordingly, defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (doc. \n33) is DENIED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated this _1_s_t_ day of September 2020. \n___________/_s_/A__n_n_ _A_i_k_e_n_________ \nAnn Aiken \nUnited States District Judge \nPAGE 28 – OPINION AND ORDER ",

The Greenwood Report summarizes Dr. Greenwood's review and findings. \nPlaintiffs seek leave from this Court to file an unredacted version of the report under \nseal.  Plaintiffs certify that defendants have reviewed the proposed redactions and do \nnot oppose the motion. \nSTANDARDS \nThere is a presumptive right of public access to court records.  See Nixon v. \nWarner Comm., Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978).  That right is \"based on the need for \nfederal  courts,  although  independent-indeed,  particularly  because  they  are \nindependent-to  have  a  measure  of accountability  and  for  the  public  to  have \nconfidence in the administration of justice.\"  Ctr.  for Auto Safety v.  Chrysler Grp., \nLLC, 809 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nParties seeking to seal documents in a dispositive motion must thus meet the \nhigh  threshold  requiring  \"compelling  reasons\"  with  specific  factual  findings  to \nsupport a sealing.  Kamakana v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1178-80 \n(9th Cir. 2006) (citing Foltz v.  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.  Co.,  331 F.3d 1122, 1136 \n(9th Cir. 2003)). The \"compelling reasons\" test requires showing more than just \"good \ncause.\"  Id.  This  standard applies  even if the  motion or its  attachments were \npreviously filed under seal or protective order.  Id. at 1179. \nPage 2 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nThe Ninth Circuit has \"carved out an exception\" to the compelling reasons \nstandard for  documents produced in discovery  and documents  not attached to  a \ndispositive motion.  Foltz, 331 F.3d at 1135 (citing Phillips ex rel. Estates of Byrd v. \nGeneral Motors Corp., 307 F.3d 1206, 1213 (9th Cir. 2002)).  To seal such documents, \nthe moving party need only provide \"good cause\" to show, San Jose Mercury News, \nInc. v.  U.S. Dist. Court-N. Dist. (San Jose), 187 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir. 1999), that \n\"specific  prejudice  or  harm will result.\"  Phillips,  307 F.3d at 1210-11  (citation \nomitted).  \"If a  court  finds  particularized  harm  will  result  from  disclosure  of \ninformation to the public, then it balances the public and private interests to decide \nwhether a protective order is necessary.\" Id. (citing Glenmede Trust Co. v. Thompson, \n56 F.3d 476, 483 (3d Cir. 1995)). \nImportantly,  however,  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  interpreted  the  terms \n\"dispositive\"  and  \"non-dispositive\"  loosely  when  determining which  standard to \napply.  Ctr. for Auto Safety, 809 F.3d at 1098 (\"To only apply the compelling reasons \ntest to the narrow category of dispositive motions goes against the long held interest \nin ensuring the public's understanding of the judicial process and of significant public \nevents.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, when the sealed material \"is \nmore than tangentially related to the underlying cause of action,\" the \"compelling \nreasons\" standard applies.  Id. at 1099. \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs' motion to certify is more than tangentially related to the merits of \nthe case; accordingly, plaintiffs' motion to seal is subject to the compelling reasons \nPage 3 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nstandard.  Plaintiffs contend that the unredacted version of the Greenwood Report \nshould be filed under seal because it includes biographical, educational, and medical \ninformation that could be  used to  identify the  named plaintiffs,  who  are  minor \nchildren.  Plaintiffs made 55 one-to-two-word redactions to the publicly filed version \nof the Greenwood Report. The redacted information includes the named plaintiffs' \nhometowns and counties, doc. 66 ex 2 pp. 9, 16, 23, 30; schools they have attended, \nid. at 10, 16, 31, 32; programs they have been placed in, id. at 9,  10, 14, 30, 40, 41; \nschool districts where plaintiffs have attended school, id. at 10, 14, 16, 23, 24, 30, 31, \n32, 38, 39, 40; and school staff who have worked with plaintiffs, id. at 39. \nThe Court finds compelling reasons to seal these portions of the Greenwood \nReport-protecting  the  privacy  of minor  children  involved  in  federal  litigation, \nincluding suits, such as this one, brought to enforce the plaintiffs rights under the \nIndividuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act,  20  U.S.C.  §§  1400,  et  seq .. \nSee 20 U.S.C. §§  1417(c)  (requiring the Secretary to \"ensure the protection of the \nconfidentiality of any personally identifiable data, information, or records, collected \nor maintained ... pursuant to\"  the IDEA);  1412(a)(8) (requiring states receiving \nfederal funds  through the  IDEA to  ensure  that state agencies  comply with the \nconfidentiality provision in section 1417(c)); Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2(a) (requiring redaction \nof\"the name of an individual known to be a minor\" from court filings).  Although the \nGreenwood Report does not include the named plaintiffs' full names, both versions of \nthe report include each child's age, disabilities, educational history, and details of \neach student's educational and behavioral assessments and Individual Education \nPage 4 - OPINION AND ORDER \n\nPlanWsi.t thh iisn formaatnitdoh nre e dacitnefodr maittwi oounbl,ed e  astyo  \nidentthinefya  mepdl aintiffs. \nTheC ourt altshoat thrfi een qduse sted arrneead rarcottwialoiynlt soo r ed \nbalatnhcneea  mepdl ainptriiffvsaa'nc dty h peu blaiccc'etsso s  judicial records, \nPlainrteidffasco tnelidyn  formanteicoens tsoap rryo ttehcneta  mepsl aintiffs' \nidentfriotmi epsud bilsiccla onsldue rmfteo  sotft  hGer eenwRoeopdoa rctc estsoi ble \nthpeu blAiccc.o rdtihnCego luycr,ot n cltuhdaets  plraeiqnuteipsffrtsoe'td e ctive \nordiensre  cessary. \nCONCLUSION \nPlainUtniopffposs'e Mdot iofno Lre avtoe F ilUen deSre a(ld o7c7.)  \n1s GRANTED. \nIT IOSR DSEOR ED. \nDattehd5-i i\"J1sy  ofF ebruary 2020. \n�� \nAnnA iken \nU.SD.i stJruidcgte  \nPage 5 - OPINION AND ORDER ",

For years, hundreds of children with disabilities across Oregon have been denied \nthe opportunity to attend a full day of school.  This longstanding denial persists unabated today.  \nThough all children with disabilities have the right under federal law to a free appropriate public \neducation and equal educational opportunity, many public schools throughout Oregon have \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 2 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 3 of 50\n \nunnecessarily and unlawfully shortened the school day for children who engage in challenging \nclassroom behaviors related to their disabilities.  Schools frequently resort to this drastic and \nharmful action without first adequately considering and developing services and supports that \nwould allow the students to successfully attend school for the full day, as required by law. \n2.  These excluded children are not among the very small group of students for \nwhom a shortened school day may be appropriate to accommodate medical conditions that limit \ntheir ability to attend school safely and productively.  Rather, they comprise a separate, larger \nclass of students who are denied the opportunity to attend school for the full day specifically due \nto their disability-related behaviors.     \n3.  Instead of receiving the full day of instruction provided to other students, which \ntypically lasts for six hours in Oregon public schools, children who are placed on shortened \nschool days often receive one or two hours of instruction per day; some receive as little as half an \nhour of daily instruction.  Even younger students—including five- and six-year-olds in their first \nyears of school—are routinely provided far less than a full school day because their needs have \nnot been supported.  Although shortened school days are often proposed as a temporary measure \nto manage student behaviors, students regularly remain on a shortened school day schedule for \nan extended and sometimes indefinite basis that can last for months, semesters, or entire school \nyears.  Some children who are subjected to shortened school days due to their disability-related \nbehaviors are eventually denied any instruction at all.  \n4.  When these children do receive instruction, it is often provided through tutoring at \nhome or in a separate classroom where they learn alone or solely with other students with \ndisabilities, rather than in a general education classroom where students with and without \ndisabilities learn together and are far more likely to enjoy academic and social success.  This \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 3 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 4 of 50\n \nisolation harms students by perpetuating the stigma, misunderstanding, and fear that often \nunderlies a school district’s decision to exclude children with disability-related behaviors from \nthe classroom.  It further reinforces the unwarranted feelings of shame and humiliation these \nchildren experience as a result of being deemed unfit to learn alongside their peers.  Children \nwho are placed in these restrictive and isolating environments receive a clear and discriminatory \nmessage: by virtue of their disabilities, they are unwelcome in and unsupported by their schools. \n5.  When children are subjected to shortened school days, they frequently fall behind \nacademically and miss out on critical social opportunities in which they can practice appropriate \nbehaviors.  Instead of receiving this needed instruction, they are separated and disconnected from \npeers who receive the academic, social, and emotional benefits of attending school for a full day.   \n6.  Shortening the school day of a child with a disability is not an appropriate \nsubstitute for providing the academic and behavioral services and supports that would enable that \nchild to learn and progress socially during a full school day.  The vast majority of children with \ndisability-related behavioral challenges can learn in general education classrooms along with \ntheir nondisabled peers if given the appropriate and legally required services and supports.   \n7.  The Governor of Oregon,1 the Oregon Department of Education, and its Director \n(collectively, Defendants or “the State”) are legally responsible for ensuring that all Oregon \nstudents with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education that is free from \ndiscrimination, and for taking effective action when school districts fail to provide such an \neducation.  Though well aware of this responsibility, the State has failed to effectively address \n                                                      \n1   The Governor of Oregon also serves as Oregon’s Superintendent of Public Instruction.  \nSee Or. Const. Art. VIII, § 1; Or. Rev. Stat. § 326.300. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 4 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 5 of 50\n \nthe practice among its school districts of unnecessarily subjecting students to shortened school \ndays, or denying them a school day entirely, due to their disability-related behaviors. \n8.  Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 \net seq., the State must “ensure” that all eligible children with disabilities receive a free \nappropriate public education.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1).  The standard for such an education is a \n“demanding” one: students with disabilities must receive an “appropriately ambitious” \neducational program that gives them “the chance to meet challenging objectives.”  Endrew F. v. \nDouglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 137 S. Ct. 988, 1000 (2017).  \n9.  Congress enacted the IDEA, an “ambitious piece of legislation,” in response to \nthe serious problem that “a majority of handicapped children in the United States were either \ntotally excluded from schools or [were] sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when \nthey were old enough to drop out.”  Id. at 999 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nSuch exclusion leads to “pervasive and tragic academic stagnation.”  Id.  Thus, for most children \nwith disabilities, an appropriate education requires fully integrating the students into the general \neducation classroom and curriculum.  See id. at 999–1000. \n10.  Accordingly, the IDEA also holds the State responsible for ensuring that children \nwith disabilities are educated in the least restrictive environment in which they can learn \nalongside their nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs.  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1412(a)(5).  Children with disabilities, including children whose disabilities affect their \nbehavior, may not be removed unnecessarily from general education classrooms in neighborhood \nschools in which they could be served effectively with appropriate services and supports.  See id.   \n11.  Under the requirements of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \n42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 5 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 6 of 50\n \n§ 794, the State may not discriminate against students on the basis of their disabilities.  State \nagencies and officials thus may not permit practices that result in the unnecessary segregation of \nchildren with disabilities who can be educated effectively for the full day in school alongside \ntheir nondisabled peers if given needed services and supports.  Congress enacted the ADA and \nSection 504 to directly address the discrimination that people with disabilities face when they are \nunnecessarily excluded from public life, such as the public school system, due to their \ndisabilities.  See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 599–601 (1999).   \n12.  The State of Oregon has been on notice for years that many of its school districts, \noften rural and small school districts, deny children with disability-related behaviors a full day of \nschool—or the chance to attend school at all—in lieu of providing them with needed services.  \nBy permitting these practices, Oregon violates the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.   \n13.  Despite years of pressure from families and advocates, the State has taken only \nbelated and insufficient steps to address this harmful and unlawful practice.  In January 2016, the \nState issued an Executive Memorandum to districts generally discouraging the use of shortened \nschool days due to student behaviors but approving the practice for students with severe \nbehaviors.2  In June 2017, the State passed a law that allows school districts to impose shortened \nschool days, but the law establishes each student’s “presumptive right” to the same hours of \ninstruction as other children receive and prohibits school districts from unilaterally shortening a \nstudent’s school day.  See O.R.S. §§ 343.161(4)(a)(C), (2).  The State further asked some of its \nadvisory bodies to provide recommendations to ensure that all Oregon students are supported in \n                                                      \n2   See Oregon Dep’t of Ed. (ODE), Executive Numbered Memorandum 009-2015-16 \nReduced School Days (Jan. 27, 2016), \nhttps://www.ode.state.or.us/news/announcements/announcement.aspx?ID=13563.  \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 6 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 7 of 50\n \nschool and “experience[] an inclusive, safe and welcoming learning environment.”3  Lastly, the \nState, through the Oregon Department of Education, has investigated administrative complaints \nabout this problem and, in some cases, ordered limited relief to individual students upon finding \nviolations of the IDEA.   \n14.  However, these policies and practices have been inadequate to identify, correct, or \nprevent the frequent violations of federal law that continue to occur on the State’s watch.  The \nState has yet to put an end to the widespread failures among its districts to provide students who \nhave disability-related behaviors with the supports they need to access a full day of instruction, \neven in cases where the absence of such services and supports drives unlawful reliance on \nshortened school days.  The State’s inertia in addressing this ongoing and systemic practice, \nbeyond the limited steps described above, has deprived these children of the education that the \nState is legally required to ensure.   \n15.  J.N., E.O., J.V., B.M.4 (“Named Plaintiffs”), and the class of children they seek to \nrepresent (collectively, “Plaintiff class”), are harmed or are at substantial and imminent risk of \nharm because Defendants’ actions and inactions unnecessarily segregate them and deprive them \nof educational services they need and to which they are entitled by the IDEA, ADA, and Section \n504.

Although the Supreme Court has made clear that “every child should have the \nchance to meet challenging objectives,” Endrew F., 137 S. Ct. at 1000, the children in the \nPlaintiff class have very little chance to meet any objectives due to their exclusion from school.  \nThese children, like all Oregon children, are entitled to a chance to meet challenging objectives \nand to a full and equal opportunity to learn free from discrimination.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief to remedy the harms that Defendants have caused the Plaintiff class. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n17.  J.N. is a 6-year-old public school student residing in Oregon.  He is a student with \na disability who is eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA.  He also is \na qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and Section 504.  Due to behaviors related \nto his disabilities, J.N. was subjected to a shortened school day during the entire 2017-2018 \nschool year, when he was in kindergarten.  For several months, the length of J.N.’s school day \nwas just one hour.  He brings this action through his next friend, T.S.  \n18.  E.O. is a 10-year-old public school student residing in Oregon.  He is a student \nwith a disability who is eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA.  He \nalso is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and Section 504.  Due to his \nbehavioral needs, E.O. currently receives a shortened school day.  He brings this action through \nhis next friend, Alisha Overstreet. \n19.  J.V. is a 7-year-old public school student residing in Oregon.  He is a student with \na disability who is eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA.  He also is \na qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and Section 504.  Until the current school \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 8 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 9 of 50\n \nyear, J.V. had never been permitted to attend school for a full day due to behaviors caused by his \ndisabilities.  He brings this action through his next friend, Sarah Kaplansky. \n20.  B.M. is a 14-year-old public school student residing in Oregon.  He is a student \nwith a disability who is eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA.  He \nalso is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and Section 504.  Because of his \ndisability-related behaviors, B.M. has received multiple shortened school day schedules of \nvarying lengths, including just thirty minutes of daily instruction during the 2015-2016 school \nyear.  Due to his behaviors, B.M. has been prohibited from attending school and provided little \nor no instruction this school year.  He brings this action through his next friend, Traci Modugno.   \n21.  Plaintiff Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc. (COPAA) is a national \nnot-for-profit membership organization of parents of children with disabilities, their attorneys, \nand their advocates.  COPAA’s mission is to protect and enforce the legal and civil rights of \nstudents with disabilities and their families.  COPAA’s primary goal is to secure appropriate \neducational services for children with disabilities in accordance with federal laws, including the \nIDEA, ADA, and Section 504.   \n22.  COPAA accomplishes its mission by, among other things: providing resources, \ntraining, and information to members to assist them in obtaining a free appropriate public \neducation and equal educational opportunity for children with disabilities; helping parents and \nadvocates file administrative complaints; educating the public and policymakers about the \nexperiences of children with disabilities and their families; and educating members about \ndevelopments in the federal laws and policies affecting education of children with disabilities.   \n23.  COPAA has more than 2,100 members located across the United States.  \nMembership is open to all persons who are interested in furthering COPAA’s purposes and who \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 9 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 10 of 50\n \npay annual dues as required.  The Board of Directors is composed exclusively of COPAA \nmembers.  COPAA has active members in Oregon, including parents of children who are eligible \nfor special education and related services under the IDEA and are currently being subjected, and \nare at substantial risk of being subjected, to shortened school days due to their behaviors.  \n24.  COPAA’s members also include attorneys and advocates who represent students \nwith disabilities in Oregon and seek to obtain a free appropriate public education and equal \neducational opportunity for these students.  The State’s failure to take effective action to address \nthe systemic and unlawful use of shortened school days by its school districts has made \nachieving this mission more difficult, time-consuming, and resource-intensive for these \nmembers.  In the absence of an adequate State system for detecting, correcting, and preventing \nthis practice, these attorneys and advocates have expended time and resources they would have \ndevoted to other work on behalf of students with disabilities in order to respond to requests for \nassistance concerning the inappropriate use of shortened school days. \n25.  COPAA’s office is located at 8 Market Place, Suite 300, Baltimore, MD 21202.  \nCOPAA brings this action on behalf of its active members who have children in the Plaintiff \nclass or who represent a child in the Plaintiff class as an attorney or advocate. \nB.  Defendants \n26.  Defendant Oregon Department of Education (ODE) is the “state educational \nagency” for Oregon, a governmental entity defined by the IDEA as “primarily responsible for the \nState supervision of public elementary and secondary schools” and the provision of a free \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment to all eligible students.  20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1401(32), 1412(a)(1), 1412(a)(5).  ODE is a public entity covered by Title II of the \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 10 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 11 of 50\n \nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., and a recipient of federal financial assistance subject to Section \n504, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  ODE’s office is located at 255 Capitol Street NE, Salem, OR 97310.    \n27.  Defendant Colt Gill is Director of ODE and the Deputy Superintendent of Public \nInstruction for Oregon.  He is responsible for supervising and directing ODE’s services, \nprograms, and activities, including enforcement of the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.  See Or. \nRev. Stat. §§ 326.300, 326.310.  He is further responsible for supervising all special education \nprograms administered by any other state agency and for coordinating with other public agencies \nas needed to ensure that eligible students receive the services required by the IDEA.  See Or. \nRev. Stat. § 343.041; 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(12)(A).  Defendant Gill’s office is located at 255 \nCapitol Street NE, Salem, OR 97310.  Defendant Gill is sued in his official capacity. \n28.  Defendant Katherine Brown is the Governor of Oregon and Superintendent of \nPublic Instruction for Oregon.  See Or. Const. Art. VIII, § 1; Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 326.300, 326.310.  \nShe is responsible for supervising and directing ODE’s services, programs, and activities, \nincluding enforcement of the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.  See id.  She is further responsible \nfor supervising all special education programs administered by any other state agency and for \ncoordinating with other public agencies as needed to ensure that eligible students receive the \nservices required by the IDEA.  See Or. Rev. Stat. § 343.041; 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(12)(A).  \nDefendant Brown’s office is located at 775 Court Street NE, Salem, OR, 97301.  Defendant \nBrown is sued in her official capacity. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n29.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because \nthe action arises under federal law, specifically the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 11 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 12 of 50\n \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Declaratory and \ninjunctive relief are available pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. \n30.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this district and because all \nDefendants maintain offices in this district and are responsible for enforcing the laws relevant to \nthis litigation in this district. \nTHE PLAINTIFF CLASS \n31.  Plaintiffs J.N., E.O., J.V., B.M., and COPAA bring this action pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) on behalf of the Named Plaintiffs and the following \nclass: All students with disabilities aged 3 to 21 residing in Oregon who are eligible for special \neducation and related services under the IDEA and are currently being subjected to a shortened \nschool day or are at substantial risk of being subjected to a shortened school day due to their \ndisability-related behaviors.5 \n32.  The Plaintiff class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \nDuring the 2016-2017 school year, a total of 77,964 Oregon children received special education \nservices under the IDEA, thousands of whom have disabilities that impact their behaviors.6  \nDisability Rights Oregon, the federally designated protection and advocacy program that \n                                                      \n5   The proposed Plaintiff class does not include students with medical needs unrelated to \ntheir behaviors that limit the students’ ability to attend school or students aged 18 to 21 who \nchoose to attend a partial day of school in order to work as part of an adult transition program.   \n6   See ODE, Statewide Report Card 2016-2017, at 71 (Nov. 30, 2017), \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/ode/schools-and-districts/reportcards/Documents/rptcard2017.pdf.  \nAmong these students, 4,996 have an “emotional disturbance,” 9,329 have autism spectrum \ndisorder, and 13,503 have an “other health impairment,” which includes attention deficit disorder \nand attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Id.  See also 34 C.F.R. § 300.8 (defining disability \ncategories). \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 12 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 13 of 50\n \nprovides legal advocacy to Oregon children with disabilities, reported to ODE in November 2015 \nthat it had received parent complaints concerning shortened school days for at least 34 students \nwith disabilities who have behavioral needs in 27 of Oregon’s 197 school districts.  Furthermore, \ndata from FACT Oregon, an advocacy organization that operates a helpline for Oregon parents, \nindicates that it received nearly 280 unduplicated calls on behalf of children with disabilities \nsubjected to shortened school days due to their behaviors from September 2016 to December \n2018 alone.  \n33.  There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of all class members, \nincluding (a) whether the State’s alleged failure to adequately supervise and monitor the use of \nshortened school days by its school districts and to enforce the provision of a free appropriate \npublic education in the least restrictive environment by those school districts violates the IDEA, \nand (b) whether the State’s alleged failure to adequately supervise, monitor, and enforce \nnondiscrimination policies and practices concerning the use of shortened school days by its \nschool districts violates Title II of the ADA and Section 504. \n34.  The claims of J.N., E.O., J.V., and B.M. are typical of the claims of the class.  \nDue to Defendants’ policies, practices, procedures, acts, and omissions, the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe class members are currently being subjected to or are at substantial risk of being subjected to \na shortened school day at an Oregon public school because of their disability-related behaviors. \n35.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass.  Each Named Plaintiff possesses a strong personal interest in the subject matter of this \nlawsuit.  The Named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel with expertise in federal \nlaws concerning disability rights and special education, as well as expertise in federal class \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 13 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 14 of 50\n \naction litigation.  Counsel have the legal knowledge and resources to fairly and adequately \nrepresent the interests of all class members in this action. \n36.  Defendants’ policies, practices, procedures, acts, and omissions harm all class \nmembers in the same manner.  Defendants’ failure to take effective action to identify, correct, \nand prevent the systemic use of shortened school days by Oregon school districts for children \nwith disability-related behaviors has deprived the Plaintiff class of the educational services to \nwhich they are entitled by federal law, subjected them to disability-based discrimination, and \nincreased their risk of being subjected to such harms in the future.  Final injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief is thus appropriate for the Plaintiff class as a whole.  \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \nA.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n37.  Under the IDEA, each state must “ensure” that it provides “special education” and \n“related services” to all children with disabilities aged 3 to 21 residing in the state.  20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1401(9), 1412(a)(1).  Special education means specially designed instruction that meets the \nunique needs of a child with a disability.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1401(29).  Related services means the \nsupportive services “required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1401(26).  The State directs local school districts to provide special education and \nrelated services to each eligible student with a disability by implementing an “individualized \neducation program” (IEP), an individually tailored statement that is developed, reviewed, and \nrevised by an “IEP team.”  See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d).   \n38.  The IDEA further requires states to “ensure” that “[t]o the maximum extent \nappropriate, children with disabilities . . . are educated with children who are not disabled, and \nspecial classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 14 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 15 of 50\n \neducational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is \nsuch that education in regular classes . . . cannot be achieved satisfactorily.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1412(a)(5).  \n39.  Together, these requirements are commonly referred to as the State’s duty to \nprovide students a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.  As the \nstate educational agency for Oregon, ODE is specifically “responsible for ensuring that” all \neligible Oregon children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education in the least \nrestrictive environment.  20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(11)(A), (a)(1), (a)(5).  ODE must coordinate with \nother public agencies as needed to ensure that children with disabilities receive the education to \nwhich they are entitled under the IDEA.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(12).  \n40.  To fulfill these responsibilities, the State, among other things, must engage in \n“effective monitoring” to ensure that local school districts provide a free appropriate public \neducation in the least restrictive environment to all eligible children.  See 20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1416(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(A), (a)(3)(B).  While the State must use data to measure school districts’ \nperformance, maintain an administrative complaint process,7 and take corrective action upon \nfinding any violations of the Act, see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1411(e)(2)(B)(i), 1415, 1416(a)(3), its duty \nrequires far more.     \n41.  Rather than focusing on technical compliance, the State’s “primary focus” must \nbe on “improving educational results and functional outcomes for all children with disabilities.”  \n                                                      \n7   Under the IDEA, a state’s administrative complaint processes must allow the filing of (a) \na “due process” complaint specific to an individual child, and (b) a “state complaint,” which any \norganization or individual may file alleging violations of the IDEA and that need not relate to a \nspecific child.  See 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.153, 300.507. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 15 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 16 of 50\n \n20 U.S.C. § 1416(a)(2)(A).8  The State must ensure that students actually receive a free \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412(a)(1), \n(a)(5); 1416(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(A).  Accordingly, the State must now guarantee that districts meet \nthe “markedly more demanding” standard for a free appropriate public education as clarified by \nthe Supreme Court in Endrew F., which explicitly demands that every child with a disability \nreceive an “ambitious” education, with the chance to meet “challenging objectives,” and \nanticipates that most children can do so in the general education classroom.  137 S. Ct. at 1000. \nB.  The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \n42.  Under Title II of the ADA (Title II), “no qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132; see 28 C.F.R. § 35.130.  Title II requires that public schools \nprovide children with disabilities an equal educational opportunity.

After \nevaluating the State’s technical compliance and educational results, each year since 2015, the \nU.S. Department of Education has listed Oregon as a state in need of assistance in implementing \nthe IDEA for two or more consecutive years.  See U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 2018 Determination \nLetters on State Implementation of IDEA (July 24, 2018), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/fund/data/report/idea/ideafactsheet-determinations-2018.pdf; U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 2017 Determination Letters on State Implementation of IDEA (July 12, 2017), \nhttps://sites.ed.gov/idea/files/ideafactsheet-determinations-2017.pdf; U.S. Dep’t of Educ., 2016 \nDetermination Letters on State Implementation of IDEA (July 10, 2016), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/fund/data/report/idea/ideafactsheet-determinations-2016.pdf; U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., Determination Letters on State Implementation of IDEA (June 2015), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/fund/data/report/idea/2015-ideafactsheet-determinations.pdf. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 16 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 17 of 50\n \n43.  Title II also prohibits the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities \nand requires public entities to administer their services, programs, and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  See \nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) (interpreting Title II); see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n44.  Public entities must make reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, or \nprocedures when necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the \nmodifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). \n45.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794, requires \nentities that receive federal financial assistance to provide aids, benefits, and services to \nindividuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual’s needs.  \n34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(2).   \n46.  Section 504 also requires that covered entities provide children with disabilities a \nfree appropriate public education, often implemented through an individualized “Section 504 \nplan.”  A free appropriate public education under Section 504 means special education and \nrelated aids and services designed to meet the needs of children with disabilities as adequately as \nthe needs of nondisabled children are met.  See 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(a), (b)(1).  This requirement \nis similar to the IDEA requirement to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) but, \n“unlike FAPE under the IDEA, FAPE under § 504 is defined to require a comparison between \nthe manner in which the needs of disabled and non-disabled children are met, and focuses on the \n‘design’ of a child’s educational program.”  Mark H. v. Lemahieu, 513 F.3d 922, 933 (9th Cir. \n2008).  Nonetheless, implementation of an IEP developed in accordance with the IDEA is one \nmeans of meeting Section 504’s requirement.  See 34 C.F.R. § 104.33(b)(2). \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 17 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 18 of 50\n \n47.  Both Title II and Section 504 prohibit states from discriminating when providing \neducational services, programs, and activities to children with disabilities, whether a state does \nso directly or through other arrangements.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1); 34 C.F.R. \n§ 104.4(b)(1).  Further, states may not provide educational services or administer their \neducational programs in a way that results in, aids, or perpetuates discrimination against children \nwith disabilities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(v), (b)(3); 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(1)(v), (b)(4).  \nThe State of Oregon must therefore adequately supervise the school districts that carry out its \neducational programs to ensure that students with disabilities are not subjected to discrimination.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Oregon Students with Disabilities are Unnecessarily Subjected to Shortened School \nDays  \n \n48.  For students whose disabilities lead to challenging classroom behaviors, school \ndistricts throughout Oregon frequently reduce the length of their school day, often by several \nhours, in violation of the students’ rights under federal law to receive a free appropriate public \neducation without discrimination based on disability.  These violations occur when districts \nmodify students’ IEPs or Section 504 plans to shorten their school days or informally shorten \nstudents’ daily schedules without documentation.  The widespread nature of this problem is \nreflected by the facts that each of the Named Plaintiffs is enrolled in a different school district in \na different region of Oregon and that COPAA members encounter this problem statewide.   \n49.  Although a small number of students with disabilities require a shortened school \nday to accommodate medical needs that limit the number of hours or the time of day when those \nstudents are able to learn, the children in the Plaintiff class are medically able to remain in school \nfor a full day.  They are excluded because of classroom behaviors related to their disabilities.   \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 18 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 19 of 50\n \n50.  Many school districts, often in rural and isolated areas of Oregon, routinely \nshorten the school day of such students without first developing, implementing, and revising as \nneeded plans to provide academic and behavioral interventions that will support the students’ \nneeds and ensure productive full days of school.  The failure to provide such interventions often \nmeans that, even when students return to school full-time after having been subjected to a \nshortened school day, their full instructional day is short-lived.  School districts often respond to \nthe students’ still-unmet behavioral needs either by again unlawfully resorting to shortened \nschool days or turning to other practices that deprive students of time in the classroom. \n51.  Such practices cause students to lose substantial instructional time and time to \nengage with their peers, making it harder for them to catch up academically and socially.  They \nalso experience stigma and emotional trauma associated with being unwelcome and excluded—\nespecially those placed on shortened schedules for prolonged or indefinite periods of time—\nwhich further compounds the challenges of returning to and reengaging in school for a full day.   \n52.  The harms resulting from unnecessary shortened school days can impact students \nfor years, derailing their future opportunities in school and in life.  Like Plaintiff B.M., see infra \npp. 28-32, some students fall so far behind academically and behaviorally while placed on a \nshortened school day schedule that their districts eventually choose to deny them access to any \neducation at all.  Students who are subjected to a shortened school day in lieu of receiving \nappropriate services and supports in school may face further consequences of having \nunaddressed behavioral needs, such as placement in residential facilities, institutionalization, or \ncourt-involvement.   \n53.  Even for students with disability-related behaviors who currently attend a full day \nof school, the State’s failure to effectively address this systemic practice has placed them at \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 19 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 20 of 50\n \nsubstantial risk of being subjected to a shortened school day and experiencing such harms in the \nfuture.  This risk is particularly heightened for those students who have previously been denied \nthe opportunity to attend school for the full day.  The passage of state legislation in 2017 that \nrequires districts to obtain data that would enable proactive monitoring of districts’ use of \nshortened school days has not solved this problem.  The law has not resulted in measurable \nprogress because the State has not actually collected or reviewed any such data; instead, it \ncontinues to rely on its ad hoc, administrative complaint process to identify and correct \nviolations.  Making matters worse, the State actually has exacerbated the risk of inappropriately \nand unlawfully shortened school days by expressly authorizing in its 2016 Executive \nMemorandum the use of shortened school days for students with the most severe behavioral \nneeds.  See supra n.2.  The State permits school districts to shorten students’ school days but \nfails to either effectively clarify the limited circumstances under which such shortened days may \nbe permissible or provide supports to help school districts educate students with behavioral needs \nfor a full school day.  See id.  Moreover, the State’s education funding formula rewards school \ndistricts that impose shortened school days by paying them the same amount for providing a \nstudent with one hour of tutoring as it would if that student had received a full day of instruction \nin school, creating a financial incentive to rely on shortened school days for students with \nchallenging behaviors.  See O.A.R. 581-023-0006(7)(b)(D).    \n54.  Despite notice that unlawfully shortened school days for students with disabilities \nrecur within and across Oregon school districts and have so recurred for years, the State’s \nacquiescence to this ongoing and statewide practice has enabled the districts’ continued reliance \non shortened school days.  Because of the State’s actions and inactions, students with \nchallenging behaviors are therefore at substantial and imminent risk of being subjected to this \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 20 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 21 of 50\n \npractice regardless of which school district serves them.  As a result, the State has deprived the \nNamed Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class of the education to which they are entitled. \nPlaintiff J.N. \n55.  Plaintiff J.N. is a 6-year-old boy in the first grade who receives special education \nand related services under the IDEA.  He has been diagnosed with a hearing impairment, anxiety, \nhyperactivity, and a developmental delay.  During the 2017-2018 school year, J.N.’s small, rural \nschool district drastically shortened his school day due to behaviors related to his disabilities. \n56.  J.N.’s teachers have described him as a very bright, tenacious, inquisitive, and \ncreative child.  He loves animals, books, superheroes, and “monster” trucks.   \n57.  As a result of his disabilities, J.N. has difficulty managing his behaviors, focusing \non learning, and expressing himself with words.  When he is upset or his work is not adequately \nengaging, J.N. has displayed disruptive classroom behaviors that include throwing objects and \nhitting or threatening others.   \n58.  After J.N. was diagnosed with hearing loss in October 2016, he was found eligible \nunder the IDEA to receive special education and related services as a student with a hearing \nimpairment.  When J.N. began kindergarten in September 2017, his IEP team noted that he \nneeded behavioral supports in addition to communication and technology supports related to his \nhearing impairment.  At the urging of J.N.’s mother and his educational advocate, the district \nagreed to conduct a functional behavioral assessment to analyze the functions of J.N.’s \nbehaviors.  It also developed a two-page interim behavior support plan for J.N., which focused \nprimarily on obtaining J.N.’s compliance with wearing his hearing aids.   \n59.  J.N. began kindergarten attending classes in the general education classroom for \nthe full school day, lasting roughly six hours.  However, J.N. soon had several incidents in which \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 21 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 22 of 50\n \nhe engaged in disruptive behaviors related to his disabilities.  Rather than expediting his \nbehavioral assessment or modifying his interim behavior support plan, his school district \nshortened J.N.’s school day to a single hour over his mother’s objections, within the first three \nweeks of his very first year in school.  As a result, J.N. was scheduled to receive only 15 minutes \nof instruction in literacy and 15 minutes in math—coupled with 15 minutes of recess and 15 \nminutes of sensory activities—in a separate classroom for special education students.  The \ndistrict sometimes failed to provide J.N. even this minimal amount of daily instruction.  \n60.  After shortening J.N.’s school day to a single hour, J.N.’s school district revised \nhis IEP in October 2017.  The school district did not include any academic goals or interventions \nin the IEP and acknowledged that J.N. was “not currently accessing any curriculum or classroom \nactivities” and was “unable to access his education.” \n61.  After repeated requests by his mother, the school district eventually increased the \nlength of J.N.’s school day.  By January 2018, he attended school for two hours and 15 minutes \neach day, including some time in the general education classroom.  However, although J.N. was \nstill missing nearly two-thirds of the school day that his peers received, the district did not \ncomplete his behavioral assessment or modify his interim behavior plan until that January.  \nDespite continued parent concerns, it did not formally evaluate J.N.’s academic and behavioral \nstrengths and needs until February 2018.  Following its delay in considering all of J.N.’s needs, \nthe district recognized in March 2018 that J.N. is additionally eligible for IDEA services due to \nhis behavior-related disabilities.   \n62.  In February 2018, J.N.’s mother filed an administrative state complaint against the \nschool district for, among other things, shortening J.N.’s school day without adequately \nconsidering and providing supportive services that could enable him to succeed for the full day.  \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 22 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 23 of 50\n \nThe complaint also alleged that ODE had violated its own obligations to ensure that J.N. and \nother children receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.   \n63.  ODE determined that J.N.’s district had indeed denied him a free appropriate \npublic education in the least restrictive environment by unnecessarily subjecting him to a \nshortened school day.  Despite this finding, ODE did not find itself in violation for failing to \nensure that J.N. received a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, \nasserting that it was unaware of the district’s failure to meet J.N.’s needs until the complaint. \n64.  Being subjected to a shortened school day substantially impaired J.N.’s ability to \nmake academic and behavioral progress and caused him to fall even further behind.  His \nexclusion from school has been emotionally devastating for J.N., who continues to want to be \nwith his classmates for the full day.  J.N. transferred to another school in the district and, when \nhis family drives past his old school, he often has told his mother: “that’s where they hurt me.” \n65.  Following the resolution of J.N.’s complaint, the district eventually agreed to \nincrease the length of his school day after he began taking medications that improved his \nbehaviors.  J.N. is now allowed to attend a full day of school, though he has been placed in a \nseparate classroom for students with behavioral needs.  Furthermore, the medication periodically \ncauses J.N. to fall asleep in class for much of the school day.  J.N.’s teachers and school staff do \nnot wake him when he falls asleep, and his IEP team has not reassessed how to meet his learning \nneeds.  He has thus missed hours of instruction daily even while physically present at school.  \n66.  J.N. has yet to receive effective interventions from the district to address his \nbehavioral needs, as the district has continued to implement strategies which proved ineffective \nbefore J.N. began taking medication to help manage his behaviors.  Even with the medication, \nthe district already has prohibited J.N. from attending a field trip with his class this school year \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 23 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 24 of 50\n \ndue to his behaviors, reflecting the district’s ongoing failure to adequately support J.N.’s \nbehavioral needs.  Without effective action by the State to ensure that J.N. consistently receives \nthe necessary behavioral supports, he faces a significant risk of being again subjected to a \nshortened school day due to his disability-related behaviors.   \nPlaintiff E.O. \n67.  Plaintiff E.O. is a 10-year-old boy in the fourth grade who receives special \neducation and related services under the IDEA from a small, rural school district.  Among other \ndisabilities, he has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder.  \n68.  E.O. is a bright and curious student.  School staff describe him as a very friendly, \ncheerful, kind-hearted, and compassionate boy who likes to give hugs.  He enjoys helping his \nteachers and setting a good example for younger students.  E.O. is interested in Greek mythology \nand archaeology, and he loves dinosaurs and Legos.  \n69.  Due to his disabilities, E.O. has difficulty regulating his emotions and impulses, \ninterpreting social cues, and remaining on task.  He becomes upset if he perceives that a situation \nis unfair, believes that he is being “picked on,” or experiences a change to his routine.  E.O. \nsometimes responds to his frustrations in school by yelling, stomping off, hitting, or kicking.  As \nhis IEP team has recognized, some of E.O.’s behaviors “may be interpreted as intentional when \nhe simply does not know another way.”  \n70.  E.O. began attending school in his current district in the 2015-2016 school year, \nwhen he was in the first grade.  School staff noted that E.O. lacked skills to self-regulate and, in \nFebruary 2016, the school developed a behavioral intervention plan with general strategies to \naddress E.O.’s behaviors.  This plan was developed without a functional behavior assessment \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 24 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 25 of 50\n \nanalyzing the purposes of E.O.’s behaviors, and it did not specify how school staff would teach \nE.O. the skills to manage his emotions or how they would measure the plan’s effectiveness.   \n71.  E.O. received a full day of school throughout the 2015-2016 school year, \nspending most of each day in the general education classroom.  In June 2016, the school district \nfound E.O. eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA due to his autism.   \n72.  E.O.’s challenging classroom behaviors continued during the second and third \ngrade.  In March 2017, the school district developed a new behavior intervention plan for E.O.  \nHowever, this plan was even less detailed than the generic behavioral intervention plan from the \nprior school year and similarly was not informed by a functional behavior assessment.  \n73.  The 2017-2018 school year was particularly challenging for E.O. as his needs \nremained unmet.  In October 2017, a district representative acknowledged that E.O. “definitely \nhas academic needs that are not being met right now,” but both school and district staff \nconsidered those needs secondary to his behavioral needs.  In response to his behaviors, the \nschool district repeatedly called E.O.’s parents to pick him up early and suspended him multiple \ntimes.  In December 2017, after the district proposed suspending him for five days, E.O.’s IEP \nteam concluded that his behaviors were a manifestation of his disabilities, and the district agreed \nto conduct a functional behavior assessment.  The district completed that assessment in January \n2018, by which time it already had suspended E.O. for eleven days that school year.  \n74.  By December of 2017, the district had placed E.O. on a half-day schedule due to \nhis behaviors, notwithstanding the State’s 2016 Executive Memorandum generally discouraging \nthe practice.  The district failed to document E.O.’s shortened school day in his IEP, in violation \nof the 2017 state law requiring districts to include a statement in the IEP “that explains the \nreasons the student was placed on an abbreviated school day program.”  O.R.S. § 343.161(4)(c).   \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 25 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 26 of 50\n \n75.  E.O. remained on a half-day schedule for the rest of his third grade year, spending \neach day in a class with just one other student and a special education aide.  He saw other \nstudents only at lunch.  His teachers that year reported that E.O. missed being in the general \neducation classroom and regularly talked about wanting to be with his peers.  After E.O. spent \nmuch of third grade receiving just half the instructional time that his classmates received, he \nexperienced gaps in his learning. \n76.  E.O.’s mother has repeatedly requested that E.O. be permitted to attend a full day \nof school and to learn in a general education classroom, but the district has continued to subject \nE.O. to a shortened school day over her objection.  At the start of the 2018-2019 school year, the \ndistrict shortened E.O.’s school day by one hour and fifteen minutes and placed him in a setting \nwhere he spent roughly two-thirds of each day separated from the general education class.  \nFollowing intervention by an attorney in December 2018, the district is now shortening E.O.’s \nschool day by thirty minutes each day.  It has not provided E.O. with any additional services or \nsupports to ensure that he is successful during his longer school day. \n77.  The State’s ongoing failure to effectively monitor the use of shortened school \ndays by local school districts has enabled E.O.’s district to shorten his school day with little \nconsideration of whether he could successfully remain at school for the full day with additional \nor different services and supports.   \n78.  Being unnecessarily denied the opportunity to attend a full day of school along \nwith his classmates has caused and continues to cause E.O. significant harm.  He has reported \nthat he “hates being different from his friends,” and while E.O. previously had some social \ninteractions with his classmates, those relationships fell apart during the period when he was \npermitted to attend school for only half a day.  He currently has no friends at school and is now \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 26 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 27 of 50\n \nreluctant to attend because he believes that no one likes him at his school.  E.O. wants to learn \nhow to connect with his peers, but his shortened school day has made it even harder for him to \ndevelop and practice the necessary skills for building positive relationships with others.  E.O. \nremains on a shortened school day schedule, and unless the district provides him with additional \nservices and supports to address this skills deficit, he is at significant risk of being subjected to \nan even shorter school day in the future.   \nPlaintiff J.V. \n79.  Plaintiff J.V. is a 7-year-old boy in the second grade who receives special \neducation and related services under the IDEA from a small, rural school district.  He has been \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.   \n80.  J.V. loves going to school and has been described by school staff as a fun and \nactive child who enjoys being helpful and responds well to praise.  He likes singing and building \nobstacle courses with cars and blocks.  J.V. is largely non-verbal and is limited in his ability to \ncommunicate, though he is eager to mimic the sounds of speech and interact socially with others. \n81.  Because of his disabilities, J.V. has difficulty adapting to changes in routine, \nconnecting with his peers, and sustaining attention to a given task.  When upset, J.V. has run \naway from adults, thrown objects, or been physically aggressive towards himself or others, \nincluding pinching and clawing himself or banging his fists.  Because J.V. is limited in his verbal \nability to communicate his needs and wants, his behaviors are a primary form of communication. \n82.  J.V. was diagnosed with autism at age two and received special education and \nrelated services under the IDEA prior to kindergarten.  Before J.V. had attended a single day of \nkindergarten, his IEP team “lower[ed] [its] demands/expectations” for him due to his behaviors. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 27 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 28 of 50\n \n83.  Although it had yet to conduct an assessment of J.V.’s behaviors or provide him \nwith a behavior support plan to help prevent and manage his behaviors in the classroom, J.V.’s \nschool district restricted J.V. to a severely shortened two-hour school day on his very first day of \nschool in the district in August 2016.  The district amended J.V.’s IEP in September 2016 to \nformally adopt the shortened school day that already was informally in place, over his mother’s \nobjections.  J.V. never attended school for the full 4.5 hour day that other students received \nduring his kindergarten year.  Often, J.V. did not receive even the mere two hours of instruction \nset forth in his IEP because his mother received near daily calls to pick him up early from school. \n84.  Moreover, under his shortened schedule, J.V. was completely isolated from his \npeers.  He received his instruction from two aides in an 8’ x 16’ workspace that was separate \nfrom the larger classroom in which other special education students learned.   \n85.  J.V. struggled both academically and behaviorally during his kindergarten year.  \nSchool staff had difficulty helping him focus on academic instruction during the short period he \nwas in school, and he regressed in his verbal and social communication skills.  Furthermore, \ndespite J.V.’s initial enthusiasm for school, his exclusion from school and his classmates \nnegatively impacted his perception of school and his desire to be there.   \n86.  J.V.’s behaviors worsened after he was placed on a shortened school day \nschedule, but instead of identifying additional or different services that could better support his \nneeds and inclusion in the classroom, the district proposed in November 2016 that J.V. be sent to \na secure residential facility located over 200 miles away from his home and family.  While the \ndistrict was evaluating the appropriateness of this facility for J.V., it offered J.V. six hours per \nweek of home tutoring in three two-hour sessions.  In actuality, the district generally provided \nthe tutoring sessions to J.V. only once or twice a week.   \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 28 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 29 of 50\n \n87.  With the help of legal counsel, J.V.’s mother convinced the school district to \nconsult with an independent behavioral expert who found that placement in the residential \nfacility was unnecessary and recommended that the district provide J.V. a device to help him \ncommunicate more effectively.  J.V. remained in his school, and the district agreed to increase \nthe length of his school day gradually—initially to two-and-a-half hours each day—with the \nexpectation that he would attend a full day of school by September of the 2017-2018 school year. \n88.  However, when J.V. returned to school in September 2017, the school district \nrefused to provide a communication device, ended its consultation with the behavioral expert, \nand returned J.V. to a shortened school day of three hours each day, just a few minutes longer \nthan his school day had been at the end of the prior school year.  \n89.  On behalf of J.V., his mother filed an administrative due process complaint \nagainst both the school district and ODE in October 2017.  ODE dismissed J.V.’s claims against \nitself for failing to ensure that J.V. received a free appropriate public education in the least \nrestrictive environment, holding that ODE is not a proper party to due process proceedings \nunless it is required by law to directly provide services.  The school district and J.V.’s mother \nreached a confidential settlement in November 2017.  J.V. completed the 2017-2018 year while \nsuccessfully attending school for one hour less each day than his first-grade classmates.   \n90.  J.V. currently attends a full day of school but remains at significant risk of being \nsubjected to a shortened school day in the future, especially given his school district’s decision \nlast school year to continue J.V. on a shortened school day despite indicating earlier that he \nwould attend school for the full day.  J.V.’s mother has not worked since he began school due to \nthe substantial risk that, absent effective action by the State, J.V.’s school district will return to \nits practice of sending him home early or constantly calling her to help manage J.V.’s behaviors.   \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 29 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 30 of 50\n \nPlaintiff B.M. \n91.  Plaintiff B.M. is a 14-year-old boy in the eighth grade who is eligible to receive \nspecial education and related services under the IDEA from a rural school district.  He has been \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy.  Since his family moved to the district in \n2013, B.M.’s school district has either restricted him to a significantly shortened school day or \nprohibited him from attending school at all due to behaviors caused by his disabilities.   \n92.  B.M. came to his current school district as a happy and affectionate child who had \nan infectious laugh and liked to smile.  He is athletic and enjoys swimming, basketball, and \njumping on the trampoline.  B.M. responds strongly to certain sensations and craves movement; \nfor example, B.M. flaps his hands at his sides or slaps his legs when he is excited, rocks back and \nforth while seated or standing, and enjoys spinning himself and jumping around.  B.M. has been \nconsistently described by the adults who work with him as a bright and intelligent child.   \n93.  Due to his disabilities, B.M. has trouble transitioning to new routines, maintaining \nattention, and controlling his impulses.  B.M. also struggles to initiate, engage in, and maintain \nsocial contact with others.  B.M. is nonverbal and his frustration with his inability to \ncommunicate has often led to aggressive behaviors, including biting his own hand, yelling, \nkicking, hitting, or pinching.   \n94.  B.M. moved to his current school district during the 2013-2014 school year, when \nhe was in the third grade.  The district placed him in a class with several other children with \ndisabilities and he became overwhelmed at the sensory stimuli in the classroom.  His behaviors \ndeteriorated and he began refusing to enter the building.  \n95.  B.M.’s challenging behaviors continued during the 2014-2015 school year and his \nmother received multiple calls a week to pick him up from school following behavioral \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 30 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 31 of 50\n \nincidents.  The school district ultimately presented his mother with the choice of keeping B.M. in \na classroom that was not effectively meeting his needs, accepting home instruction, or \ntransferring B.M. early to middle school.  Because B.M. was making little progress in his \nclassroom and she feared that he would be unable to thrive in a new school with classmates who \nwere two years older, B.M.’s mother reluctantly acquiesced to the home instruction.  \n96.  B.M. was moved to a middle school for the 2015-2016 school year, but he \nstruggled to return to school from home instruction, and the behavior support plan that the school \ndistrict developed was ineffective.  After this transition, his already minimal language skills \ndeteriorated further, and he lost the few words that he previously used to communicate.  The \nlength of B.M.’s school day has fluctuated throughout his time in the district, but he began the \n2015-2016 school year attending just the last half-hour of each school day; by March 2016, B.M. \nhad not received more than ninety minutes of daily instruction during that school year.   \n97.  Receiving such limited instruction in isolated settings only worsened B.M.’s \nbehaviors, yet the district continued to shorten his school day.  By March of 2016, the district \ndecided to provide B.M. only thirty minutes of instruction per day.  His instruction was to be \nprovided in a classroom separate from children without disabilities by a paraprofessional \neducator, rather than a teacher.  The IEP team also identified B.M.’s severely limited ability to \ncommunicate as a cause of his behaviors and determined that he urgently needed a device to help \nhim communicate.  However, the district was unable to hire the paraprofessional necessary to \nimplement this plan, and its minimal efforts to help him communicate were unsuccessful. \n98.  The district did hire an autism specialist to work with B.M. and students with \nsimilar needs, but B.M. was so disengaged from school by this point that he was only successful \nin attending school intermittently during the fall of 2016, never for a full day.  In September \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 31 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 32 of 50\n \n2016, the district contracted with a behavior specialist who had worked with B.M. previously, \neven though the behavior specialist was based over an hour away from the district.  The behavior \nspecialist was contracted to provide behavior coaching to B.M. in school on an interim basis and \nto train the paraprofessional educator who the district would hire to take over, but the district \nnever filled the paraprofessional position.  The behavior specialist resigned during the 2016 \nwinter break, and no district staff filled the specialist’s role. \n99.  Lacking needed academic, behavioral, and communication supports, B.M. \nbecame increasingly frustrated and resistant to his school’s efforts to educate him.  Although the \ngoal in B.M.’s IEP was to transition him to a four-hour school day by the end of the 2016-2017 \nschool year, he did not receive any services from the district to help him do this from January \n2017 through the end of that school year.   \n100.  On January 4, 2017, B.M.’s attorney wrote ODE’s Assistant Superintendent \nraising a concern that the district lacked the expertise required to support B.M. and that there \nwere multiple children in the district like B.M. whose behavioral needs were not being met.  The \nODE specialist replied that B.M. could file an administrative complaint.    \n101.  The special education director for B.M.’s school district also wrote ODE to share \nthe view that a lack of resources had limited the district’s ability to serve B.M. and that both the \ndistrict and B.M.’s attorney hoped the State would provide additional resources.  Despite these \nrequests for help, and an in-person meeting between ODE and the district to discuss providing \nsuch resources to meet B.M.’s needs, ODE failed to provide the district any additional resources.  \n102.  In April 2017, B.M.’s mother filed an administrative state complaint against the \nschool district and against ODE.  ODE found that the school district had failed to provide B.M. a \nfree appropriate public education and ordered the district to take corrective action.  However, it \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 32 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 33 of 50\n \ndid not substantiate any of the allegations against itself, instead asserting that none of the \ndistrict’s failures were due to a lack of resources from the State.  Furthermore, despite ODE’s \ndirect involvement in conversations about B.M.’s needs, ODE asserted that its knowledge of \nB.M.’s situation was only “slight” until the complaint was investigated and thus it had no prior \nopportunity to address the district’s noncompliance. \n103.  B.M.’s experiences at his school have been traumatic and have caused him to be \nextremely anxious about attending his school or entering the school building.  Although B.M. \nprevailed in his administrative claims against the school district, the district continues to fail to \nmeet his needs.  During the 2018-2019 school year, the district allowed B.M. to attend school \nonly once, and it provided him a handful of home tutoring sessions.  When the aide hired to \nprovide the home instruction left for another job, the district asked B.M.’s mother not to bring \nhim to school until a suitable replacement aide could be found.  After expressly prohibiting B.M. \nfrom attending school, the district removed B.M. from its roster for failure to attend and \nproposed transferring him out of the district. \n104.  Despite his continued eligibility for services under the IDEA, B.M.’s school \ndistrict is currently failing to provide him with any instruction or other services—in school or at \nhome—that would enable him to transition back to the school setting on a daily schedule that \nmeets his needs.  He has now been placed in a facility for residential treatment and is expected to \nreceive educational services from another school district.  Although the State did monitor the \ndistrict to ensure its compliance with the order requiring corrective action after B.M.’s \nadministrative complaint, the State has not continued to monitor whether the district is providing \nB.M. with the required educational services or supports, nor has it taken action to address the \ndistrict’s complete failure to do so.  Absent action from the State, when educational services \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 33 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 34 of 50\n \nresume for B.M., he faces a significant likelihood of again being denied needed instructional \ntime and experiencing the harms associated with unnecessary shortened school days.   \nB.  The State’s Knowledge of the Systemic, Unnecessary Use of Shortened School Days  \n105.  For several years, the State has had ample notice that its school districts \nunnecessarily and systematically deny children like J.N., E.O., J.V., and B.M. access to a full \nschool day and fail to provide these students with interventions, services, and supports required \nby federal law.   \n106.  On June 3, 2013, Disability Rights Oregon informed ODE that it had received \nfrequent inquiries from families across the state concerned about the use of shortened school \ndays for their children with behavioral needs.  Since at least 2013, advocates have regularly \nurged the State to solve this problem, prompting ODE to issue its 2016 Executive Memorandum.   \n107.  After being made aware by families and advocates that this practice has continued \nstatewide following issuance of the Executive Memorandum, the state legislature passed Senate \nBill 263 in June 2017.  The law concerns shortened (or “abbreviated”) school days, defined as \n“any school day during which a student receives instruction or educational services for fewer \nhours than other students who are in the same grade within the same school.”  O.R.S. \n§ 343.161(1)(a).  Among other things, the law establishes each student’s “presumptive right to \nreceive the same number of hours of instruction or educational services as other students who are \nin the same grade within the same school,” and prohibits districts from imposing a shortened \nschool day on a student without the parent’s consent.  O.R.S. §§ 343.161(1)(d), (2), (4)(a)(C).   \n108.  The State also has known of this systemic problem due to the long history of \nadministrative complaints filed against school districts and the State itself.  Since 2008, the State \nhas issued roughly thirty written opinions resolving state complaints on behalf of students across \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 34 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 35 of 50\n \nOregon who received shortened school days due to their behaviors, representing 12 percent of \nODE’s written opinions for state complaints but a mere fraction of the hundreds of families who \nhave reported the inappropriate use of shortened school days to advocates.  See supra ¶ 32. \n109.  However, the State repeatedly has disclaimed notice of violations until the filing \nof complaints.  For example, after finding that one school district had systemically denied free \nappropriate public education to students with disability-related behaviors by placing them on \nshortened school day schedules, ODE determined that it was “unaware of” the denials and “not \nafforded any reasonable opportunity to compel local compliance” prior to the complaints since \n“[l]ittle, if any, of the data obtained through the Department’s monitoring and supervision \nprocesses yields information that could put the Department on notice of any issues related to a \nspecific student.”9  Notwithstanding this position, the history of complaints involving shortened \nschool days—which does not include those resolved without a written opinion—has given the \nState clear notice that this practice occurs on a statewide basis and has persisted for years. \n110.  The State also has been notified of multiple complaints filed with the Office for \nCivil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education (OCR) alleging the unlawful use of shortened \nschool days under Title II and Section 504.  In 2014, OCR received three complaints involving \nshortened school days for students with behavioral needs in three rural Oregon districts, each of \nwhich settled.  OCR has also received complaints against Oregon districts for sending students \nwith disabilities home earlier than their peers for the school’s administrative convenience and, in \n                                                      \n9   ODE, Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Final Order Case No. 18-054-017, at 8-9 (June \n4, 2018), https://www.oregon.gov/ode/rules-and-policies/2018complaints/18-054-\n017%20Dallas.pdf. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 35 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 36 of 50\n \n2016, cautioned two districts against doing so.10  In all of these cases, the State was notified of \nthe allegations that its districts had unlawfully shortened the school days of students with \ndisabilities.    \n111.  Lastly, the State for years has been made aware of the harmful impact of \nunnecessarily shortened school days on children with disabilities through several local news \nreports and essays discussing this issue.11  \nC.  The State’s Inadequate System for Ensuring an Appropriate Education  \n112.  Despite its clear legal obligations and years of notice, the State has failed to \nimplement effective policies and procedures to ensure that Oregon children who are subjected to \nshortened school days or denied a school day entirely due to their behaviors receive the services \nto which they are entitled and are not unnecessarily excluded from school.  \n113.  The State has developed some policies in response to this ongoing problem, such \nas its 2016 Executive Memorandum and an administrative rule regarding minimum instructional \ntime.  See supra n.2 (citing O.A.R. 581-022-1620, renumbered as O.A.R. 581-022-2320).  The \nState also has developed general procedures to supervise and monitor school districts, which \n                                                      \n10   See e.g., U.S. Dep’t of Ed., Letter to Silver Falls Sch. Dist. 4J, No. 10151452 (May 16, \n2016), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10151452-a.pdf; U.S. \nDep’t of Ed., Letter to Beaverton Sch.

However, these policies and procedures are inadequate to meet the State’s \nstatutory obligation to ensure that students with disability-related behaviors receive a free \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment for a full school day or its \nobligation under federal civil rights laws to ensure nondiscrimination against these students.  \n115.  The State’s policies and procedures are defective in at least the following \nrespects: (1) the State does not collect readily available information about individual students \nwho are denied access to full school days due to their disabilities or the school districts that \nimpose shortened school days, information which could trigger the need for further monitoring \nof both individual and systemic failures; (2) the State does not take responsibility for ensuring \nschool districts’ compliance with federal law through its enforcement actions beyond \nimplementing its administrative complaint system; and (3) the State fails to provide districts with \nthe technical assistance and other supports needed to prevent the unlawful use of shortened \nschool days for children with disability-related behaviors.   \n116.  First, although the State has long been aware of the widespread and unlawful use \nof shortened school days throughout Oregon, it has no policies or procedures in effect that \nrequire school districts to report data that would allow it to identify the specific districts in need \nof further monitoring or corrective action.  As Defendant Gill has publicly acknowledged, the \nState “[does not] have a way of knowing” whether its districts satisfy educational obligations to \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 37 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 38 of 50\n \nOregon students with disability-related behavioral needs, including students who are subjected to \nshortened school days due to their disability-related behaviors.12 \n117.  Senate Bill 263 mandates that school districts create documentation which, if \ncollected by ODE, would allow the State to reliably estimate the number of Oregon children who \nreceive shortened school days during each school term.13  Furthermore, the State’s Executive \nMemorandum on shortened school days encourages—but does not require—districts to collect \ndata demonstrating that a shortened school day is appropriate for a given student and that the \nstudent’s parents have been meaningfully included in that decision.  See supra n.2.  However, the \nState has knowingly failed to collect and review any of this data in order to ensure that students \nreceive an education in accordance with federal law and its own administrative rules and policies \nregarding instructional time, even though two of its own advisory bodies have urgently \nrecommended robust data collection and reporting on shortened school days.14   \n118.  Moreover, the self-assessments that school districts must complete for the State \nunder the IDEA are based on a sample of student files that, in some cases, do not include records \nfrom students who experience shortened school days in school districts that systemically engage \nin this practice.  For example, even when the State investigated a series of complaints and found \n                                                      \n12   Alisha Roemeling, Violent student behaviors on the rise, officials say, THE REGISTER-\nGUARD (Nov. 26, 2018), https://www.registerguard.com/news/20181117/violent-student-\nbehaviors-on-rise-officials-say. \n13   Senate Bill 263 requires that school districts obtain from parents signed \nacknowledgements that they have been informed of their rights under the law and that districts \ndocument the reasons for placing a student on a shortened school day in the IEP.  See O.R.S. \n§§ 343.161(4)(b), (4)(c). \n14   See ODE, Oregon Safe and Effective Schools for ALL Students Advisory Committee, \n“Summary and Recommendations Report” 11 (June 2018); ODE, Joint State Advisory Council \nfor Special Education and State Interagency Coordinating Council, Minutes (Mar. 16, 2018), \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/SpecialEducation/Documents/sasceminutes3-\n16-18.pdf. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 38 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 39 of 50\n \nthat one school district had systemically denied a free appropriate public education in the least \nrestrictive environment to three students given shortened school days due to their disability-\nrelated behaviors, none of those students were included in the data sample reported to the State.  \nSee supra n.9, at 7, 9 n.19.  The State’s passive approach to ensuring the provision of a free \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment thus failed to detect this \nsystemic denial until these families filed complaints with the assistance of counsel. \n119.  Second, the State fails to take sufficient enforcement action to ensure compliance \nwith federal law or with its own deficient policies and procedures regarding shortened school \ndays and instructional time.  The State insists that it can “find and remediate local school district \nnon-compliance” through its administrative complaint procedures.15   \n120.  Although operating an effective complaint system is a critical responsibility of \nstate departments of education, the State’s haphazard correction of legal violations in the subset \nof claims that come forward through the complaint process does not and cannot ensure that all \nstudents actually receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment \nor prevent discrimination based on disability, particularly when a district is the subject of a \nsystemic complaint or multiple complaints about the same issue.  Furthermore, the State’s \ninsistence that the administrative complaints that are filed adequately represent all of the \n                                                      \n15   See ODE, Findings of Fact, Conclusions, and Final Order Case No. 17-054-012, at 17 \n(June 22, 2017), https://www.oregon.gov/ode/rules-and-policies/2017complaints/17-054-\n012%20ODE-Douglas%20Co.pdf.  As required, the State operates an administrative complaint \nprocess in which it investigates and resolves complaints alleging violations of the IDEA by \nschool districts or ODE itself.  See 34 C.F.R. § 300.151 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. §300.507 et seq.  \nParents of children with disabilities may also file claims of discrimination under Section 504 \nwith the State or they may file a claim of discrimination under the ADA directly with their \nschool district and appeal if needed to ODE.    \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 39 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 40 of 50\n \nindividual and systemic problems across districts regarding the use of shortened school days is \nbelied by the reports to advocates from hundreds of concerned families.  \n121.  For example, in August 2017, ODE found that one school district substantially \nshortened the school days of four children with disabilities to just two or three hours a day due to \ntheir disruptive behaviors.  It determined that the district gave little or no consideration to less \nrestrictive options and had systemically failed to consider providing positive behavioral \ninterventions and supports.  However, because the district did not document the services that it \nwas providing students, ODE concluded that it could not determine which services were needed \nto keep these students in school for the full day and that it thus lacked sufficient information to \nfind a violation of the IDEA.  Despite its own Executive Memorandum directing districts to use \nshortened school days only in extreme cases when all other options have failed, ODE did not act \nupon the known misuse of shortened school days for these students to ensure that the district was \nproviding a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment to students on \nshortened school days, such as by conducting onsite visits or offering technical assistance.  Two \nmonths later, the parent of another child with disability-related behaviors filed a complaint \nagainst the same district for needlessly shortening their child’s school day. \n122.  Even when the State finds that a school district has violated federal law, it does \nnot sufficiently guard against the same or new denials of students’ rights in the future.  For \ninstance, although ODE found that J.N. was denied a free appropriate public education when he \nwas subjected to a shortened school day, he continues to miss hours of daily instruction due to \nmedications he is compelled to take in order to remain at school.  Because of the State’s failure \nto ensure that its districts provide needed services and supports, J.N. and children like him \nremain unable to access a full day of instruction even after prevailing in the complaint process.   \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 40 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 41 of 50\n \n123.  Third, the State has failed to provide school districts with adequate resources, \ntechnical assistance, and training to help prevent the unnecessary use of shortened school days \nand to correct school districts’ legal violations prior to and apart from the filing of complaints.  \nThe 2016 Executive Memorandum advises school districts that a reduction in instructional time \nmay trigger the procedural safeguards of the IDEA, but it offers scarce guidance on how to \neffectively support students with behavioral needs and critically omits any reference to the \nnondiscrimination requirements of the ADA and Section 504.   \n124.  Some districts that wish to avoid the use of shortened school days and to provide \ntheir students with more effective behavioral supports struggle to do so in the absence of \nadditional resources from the State.  Upon information and belief, at least one school district that \nhas systemically imposed shortened school days on students with behavioral needs is now \nconsidering using funding that was intended to hire an additional special education teacher and \nother local resources to instead provide needed school-based behavioral services.  \n125.  Even when asked directly by districts for help, the State has declined to provide \nadditional resources, expertise, or training to help them support students with disability-related \nbehavior needs.  When B.M.’s attorney and his school district both asked ODE to help the \ndistrict meet B.M.’s needs, ODE did not provide any such assistance.  Instead, it asserted \nconfidence that the district was doing all that it could—despite later finding that the district had \ndenied B.M. a free appropriate public education—and acknowledged that the district’s difficulty \nin supporting B.M.’s needs is not a unique problem among Oregon districts.  \n126.  In the absence of needed assistance from the State, many districts have continued \nto resort to shortening the school day of children with behavioral needs.  Well after the State \nissued its Executive Memorandum, FACT Oregon reported that sixty-eight (roughly thirteen \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 41 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 42 of 50\n \npercent) of the unduplicated calls and emails it received from families seeking support through \nits special education helpline from September 2016 to January 2017 concerned children with \ndisabilities who received shortened school days due to their behaviors.  As FACT Oregon told \nthe State in 2017, “shortened school days for behavior, and the inappropriate use of shortened \nschool days in particular, remains a widespread problem for Oregon students with disabilities.”16 \n127.  Due to the State’s failures, Oregon school districts persist in denying students \nwith disability-related behaviors access to full school days without providing or adequately \nconsidering alternative services and supports that could enable these students to learn for the full \nday.  If the State took effective action to identify the districts engaged in this practice, correct \nviolations of federal law, and provide technical assistance and resources, the children in the \nPlaintiff class could receive the services that they need to be fully included in their schools. \n128.  Following years of calls by advocates for the State to end these systemic \nviolations of the rights of Oregon students with disabilities, State agency representatives met \nwith local stakeholders in June, August, and September 2018 to discuss this issue.  However, the \nState has not identified any concrete steps it has undertaken since then to address the ongoing \nproblem and Plaintiffs are aware of none.   \n129.  Through its continued inaction and ineffective policies and procedures regarding \nshortened school days, the State has violated its duties under the IDEA, ADA, and Section 504.  \nIn turn, the State has abandoned the many Oregon students with disabilities who will not receive \nthe education to which they are entitled under federal law until the State takes necessary action. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n                                                      \n16   Caitlin Shockley, FACT Oregon, SACSE Constituent Report 2 (Jan. 20, 2017), \nhttps://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/99821. \nComplaint for Equitable  Relief—Page 42 \n\nCase 6:19-cv-00096-AA    Document 1    Filed 01/22/19    Page 43 of 50\n \nCOUNT 1—Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. \n130.

Executive Summary \n \nExecutive Summary \n \n  When a student has difficulty reading, the response should not be \"Let#s reduce the amount \nof instructional time they are receiving-they will figure it out at home.” However, for students with \nsignificant behavior issues that is exactly what has been happening in many school districts across \nOregon. Students eligible for special education and related services, whose behaviors are difficult \nto manage and need to be taught replacement behaviors, are being placed on shortened school days \nusually with little or no instruction provided outside of their shortened school day. Some of these \nstudents only receive a total of 1-2 hours each day, and some receive less. \n  In 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed that a student#s individualized education \nprogram (IEP) \"must aim to enable the child to make progress,” since \"the essential function of an \nIEP is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement.” Endrew F., 137 S. Ct. \nat 999. As the Court explained, \"[a] substantive standard not focused on student progress would \ndo little to remedy the pervasive and tragic academic stagnation that prompted Congress to act.” \nThe Court acknowledged the IDEA is an \"ambitious” piece of legislation and further held that \n\"every child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives,” even though each student#s \ngoals and needs may differ. \n  In exchange for federal funding under the IDEA, states must have policies and procedures \nin effect to ensure the statute#s requirements are met. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a). The law vests State \nEducational Agencies (SEAs) with general supervision powers and duties over local school \ndistricts, including duties to oversee the collection of required data; analyze the data; issue \nfindings; and reach conclusions to prevent and remedy systemic problems. See 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1412(a)(11), 1450(2).  \n  To satisfy their obligations under the IDEA, SEAs must operate an effective general \nsupervision  system  and  must  \"maintain  high  academic  achievement  standards  and  clear \nperformance goals for children with disabilities, consistent with the standards and expectations for \nall students.” 20 U.S.C. § 1450(4)(A); see 20 U.S.C §1416(b)(2)(A). States must specifically \nensure that all eligible students receive a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive \nenvironment (LRE). 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1), (a)(5).  \n  Free appropriate public education (FAPE) means the provision of \"special education,” \nwhich is specially designed instruction to meet the student#s unique needs, and \"related services,” \nwhich are services \"required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education,” \nincluding developmental, corrective, and other supportive services. 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9), (26), \n(29); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.34, 300.39. Specially designed instruction means adapting, as appropriate \nto the needs of the child, \"the content, methodology, or delivery of instruction . . . [t]o address the \nunique needs of the child that result from the child#s disability; and . . . [t]o ensure access of the \nchild to the general curriculum, so that the child can meet the educational standards . . . that apply \nto all children.” 34 C.F.R. § 300.39(b)(3).  \n  Our analysis found that while less than 2% of students in special education are placed on a \nshortened school day, for those students and their families, this amounted to often a dramatic \ndecrease in the amount of instruction received, a loss of opportunities for interaction with peers, \nand an educational program that put them in a position to lag further and further behind their peers \n \n\n    6 \nin both academic and social emotional skills. School districts in Oregon that were placing students \neligible for special education on shortened school days viewed the decision as appropriate as long \nas they followed the right procedures. The districts did not often demonstrate an understanding \nthat  the  IEP  and  program  should  be  developed  and  calculated  to  allow  these  students  to \naggressively work toward moving the student along the LRE continuum toward more time with \npeers. We were unable to locate sufficient guidance, training, or other resources and support \nprovided by ODE to help districts understand the LRE considerations and the role of the IEP team \nto ambitiously move students back to a full-day. Thus, in many of the districts, shortened school \nday was viewed as a part of a long team placement on the LRE continuum.    \n  Our early analysis also showed the ODE monitoring system did not allow for appropriate \ndata gathering and monitoring of the use of shorten school days–this was only reconfirmed as our \nreview continued. Perhaps ODE recognized this as well, as ODE is implementing some changes \nin it#s monitoring process next year as outlined in the newly passed (June 16th, 2022) General \nSupervision Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR 581-015-2015), which outlines processes and \nprocedures that will improve the ODE#s monitoring and general supervisions processes. As the \nagency tasked with ensuring local school districts are providing each student, in every district, an \nopportunity to have access to and progress in the general curriculum and receive a FAPE in the \nLRE, these processes are vital to fulfilling its statutory duties.  \n  As a result of our analysis that included a survey of school districts across Oregon (93% \nresponse rate, representing 92% of students with disabilities across the state), talking with school \ndistrict personnel, ODE staff, compliance officers, families, and reviewing IEPs/FBAs/BIPs we \nmake the following recommendations to the ODE: \n  1. Clarify guidance on the use of Shortened School Days.  \n  2. Conduct mandatory training for all special education staff and administrators across the \nstate on the use of SSD that is consistent and available as new staff come into districts. \n  3. Designate IDEA funding to provide stipends for special education teachers and school \npsychologists to be paid at designated intervals during the school year with increased stipends for \nhigh need areas. \n  4. Establish a statewide program to offer Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) training \nfor paraprofessionals and other school staff as well as required supervision by regional Board \nCertified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs). \n  5. Create and fund regional Intensive Interagency Support Teams that districts can call on \nto provide training, consultation, and coaching in addressing behavior needs. \n  6. Purchase, implement, and mandate the use of a Statewide IEP system.  \n  7. Include a process/procedure in the monitoring process to include low incident situations \nsuch as SSD.   \n  8. Issue guidance on how SB263 requires parent permission for a shortened school day and \nmeld the conflict between consent and meaningful participation. \n  9. Issue guidance on how to document Informal Removals. \n  10. Issue guidance on the use and processes for FBAs and BIPs, including sample \ndocuments that could be included in the statewide IEP system.  \n \n!  \n \n\n    7 \nB. Purpose of Review  \n  The Purpose of the Review is taken directly from the contract and the stipulated areas of \nreview. This scope did not change during the course of the review. The timelines changed due to \na variety of factors, but the scope of the work did not change.  \nIntroduction \na. The parties wish to settle J.N. et al. v.

INTRODUCTION \n  \nA. Background \nThere have always been students and young adults with disabilities, but educational \nservices have not always been available to them. In fact, as recently as 1970 it was legal to \nprevent students with disabilities from attending school (Johnson, 1986).1 One specific \nexample  allowed  the  exclusion  from  school  for  students  physically  or  mentally \nincapacitated (Code of Virginia, 1973).2 The history of educational services for students \nwith disabilities is filled with stories and examples of wholesale exclusion and legal \ndenials. Often, the best a parent could hope for was some form of educational service in a \nstate-run institution (Sheerenberger, 1983).3 \nAs  the  result  of  several  court  cases  and  pressure  from  parents,  Congress \ninvestigated educational services for students with disabilities. Two notable statements \nfrom their findings stand out: \nThe long-range implications of these statistics are that public agencies and \ntaxpayers will spend billions of dollars over the lifetimes of these individuals \nto maintain such persons as dependents and in a minimally acceptable lifestyle. \nWith proper education services, many would be able to become productive \ncitizens, contributing to society instead of being forced to remain burdens. \nOthers,  through  such  services,  would  increase  their  independence,  thus \nreducing their dependence on society (U.S.C.C.A.N, 1975, p. 1433). \n \nProviding educational services will ensure against persons needlessly being \nforced into institutional settings. One need only look at public residential \ninstitutions to find thousands of persons whose families are no longer able to \ncare for them and who themselves have received no educational services. \n \n1 Johnson,\tT.\tP.\t(1986).\tThe\tprincipal’s\tguide\tto\tthe\teducational\trights\tof\thandicapped\t\nstudents.\tNational\tAssociation\tof\tSecondary\tSchool\tPrincipals. \n2 Code of Virginia, Section 22.275.3 (1973). \n3 Scheerenberger, R. C. (1983). A history of mental retardation. Paul H. Brookes \nPublishing. \n \n\n    10 \nBillions  of  dollars  are  expended  each  year  to  maintain  persons  in  these \nsubhuman conditions . . . (U.S.C.C.A.N, 1975, p. 1433).4 \nCongress realized something needed to be developed to provide standard guidelines \nand some uniformity to the states in the provision of identification and educational services \nfor students with disabilities. The USCANN report helped with this, as did several court \ncases at the local level. These court cases clarified that specific procedures needed to be \nfollowed when determining if a student had a disability, the need for enforcement of \ncompulsory attendance laws, and alleviating biases against certain students (Diana v. State \nBoard  of  Education  of  California,  1970;  Mills  v.  DC  Board  of  Education,  1972; \nPennsylvania Association for Retarded Children v. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \n1972). The Education for all Handicapped Children Act was passed by Congress in 1975 \nand sought to address these issues being brought to the courts. \nP. L. 94-142 \nThe Education for All Handicapped Children Act, frequently referred to as P.L. 94-\n142, provided guidance to states allowing students with disabilities to access public \neducation as well as providing financial assistance to states to supplement state and local \nfunds to provide special education and related services. P.L. 94-142 mandated states \ncomply with the law to receive federal funding for special education (Yell, 2018).5 \n  Specifically:     \n  The intent when Congress passed P.L. 94-142 was to insure that all students with \ndisabilities will be assured that they in fact have a right to education, and to establish \na process by which State and local education agencies may be held accountable for \nproviding educational services for all handicapped children. (U.S.C.C.A.N, 1975). \nPL 94-142 has a profound impact in the lives of children with disabilities and \nprovided the foundation for special education as you know it. PL 94-142, which became \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990, is the primary law regarding the \neducational services for students with disabilities. The law and its specific components are \nimportant to the education of students with disabilities. Education, prior to 1975, for \n \n4 United States Code Congressional and Administrative News 1975 (U.S.C.C.A.N. 1975) \n5 Yell, M. L. (2018). The law and special education, fifth edition. Pearson. \n \n\n    11 \nstudents with disabilities existed in a few small locations across the country. As noted \nabove it was legal to prevent students with disabilities from receiving an education, and \nsome states it was a crime for parents of disabled children to enroll them in school. This \nlaw  changed  everything  for  students  with  disabilities,  and  public  education  became \neducation for all. \nThe problem with PL 94-142, now the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nis that it has not been evenly applied. The recent Supreme Court case in Endrew F. \nhighlighted the differences between the various circuits relating to the benefit students \neligible for special education and related services are to receive. Hopefully the long-term \nimpact of that case will be a clearer standard about the need for students to make \nappropriate  progress  in  light  of  their  unique  circumstances  while  receiving  special \neducation services.  \nIn  the  present  matter,  there  are  allegations  that  students  eligible  for  special \neducation and related services have been denied access to attending school for a full-day \ndue to their behaviors. Since PL 94-142, all children with disabilities have the right under \nfederal law to a free appropriate public education and equal educational opportunity. The \npresent matter is there is a concern that throughout Oregon students who engage in \nchallenging classroom behaviors related to their disability have been placed on placed on \na shortened school day. Children eligible for special education and related services who \nare placed on a shorted end school day receive significantly fewer hours of instruction as \ncompared to all other students, who typically receive six-hours in Oregon public schools, \nTherefore, our report excludes data or analysis related to students who receive a shortened \nschool  day  due  to  medical  necessity  (surgeries,  cancer  treatments,  problems  with \nmedications, stamina, etc.), phobia of school, or other parental circumstances or demands. \n  As one director of special education said to us, if a student has problems in reading \nyou don#t provide them with less instruction in reading. This sums up the absence of logic \nand evidence-based pedagogical decisions when placing students on shortened school \ndays. When students are denied access to a full-day of instruction they miss out not only \non the educational opportunities provided to the other students, but also the benefits and \nincidental learning from socialization and regular interactions with other students. These \nstudents often fall behind academically and miss out on critical social opportunities in \n \n\n    12 \nwhich they can practice appropriate behaviors and implement the strategies they are \nlearning. Instead of receiving this needed instruction and opportunities to practice, they are \nseparated and disconnected from peers who receive the academic, social, and emotional \nbenefits  of  attending  school  for  a  full-day.  This  isolation  perpetuates  the  stigma, \nmisunderstanding, and fear that often underlies a school district#s decision to exclude \nchildren with disability-related behaviors from the classroom.  \nThe impact of this isolation and these lost opportunities became abundantly clear \nover the past two years as schools across the nation provided virtual instruction to most \nstudents as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anecdotal reports from veteran teachers \nare that students are significantly more immature than previous chronologically aged peers \nand will need concerted efforts by all to help them \"catch-up” to where they are supposed \nto be. \n  Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et \nseq., the State must \"ensure” that all eligible children with disabilities receive a free \nappropriate public education. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1). Therefore, the Governor of Oregon \nas Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Oregon Department of Education, and its \nDirector (collectively, Defendants or \"the State”) are legally responsible for ensuring all \nOregon students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education and for taking \naction when school districts systemically fail to provide FAPE. The standard for such an \neducation is a \"demanding” one: students with disabilities must receive an \"appropriately \nambitious”  educational  program  that  gives  them  \"the  chance  to  meet  challenging \nobjectives.” Endrew F. v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 137 S. Ct. 988, 1000 (2017). \n  Accordingly, the IDEA also holds the State responsible for ensuring that children \nwith disabilities are educated in the least restrictive environment in which they can learn \nalongside their non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1412(a)(5). Children with disabilities, including children whose disabilities affect \ntheir behavior, may not be removed unnecessarily from general education classrooms in \nneighborhood schools in which they could be served effectively with appropriate services \nand supports. See id. 11. Under the requirements of Title II of the Americans with \n \n\n    13 \nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n  To fulfill these responsibilities, the State, among other things, must engage in \n\"effective monitoring” to ensure that local school districts provide a free appropriate public \neducation in the least restrictive environment to all eligible children. See 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1416(a)(1)(C), (a)(3)(A), (a)(3)(B). While the State must use data to measure school \ndistricts!performance, maintain an administrative complaint process, and take corrective \naction upon finding any violations of the Act, see 20 U.S.C. §§ 1411(e)(2)(B)(i), 1415, \n1416(a)(3), this duty involves far more. \n  In January 2016, the State issued an Executive Memorandum to districts generally \ndiscouraging the use of shortened school days due to student behaviors but approving the \npractice for students with severe behaviors. In June 2017, the State passed a law that allows \nschool districts to impose shortened school days, but the law established each student#s \n\"presumptive right” to the same hours of instruction as other children receive and prohibits \nschool  districts  from  unilaterally  shortening  a  student#s  school  day.  See  O.R.S.  §§ \n343.161(4)(a)(C), (2). The State further asked some of its advisory bodies to provide \nrecommendations  to  ensure  that  all  Oregon  students  are  supported  in  school  and \n\"experience[] an inclusive, safe and welcoming learning environment.” Lastly, the State, \nthrough the Oregon Department of Education, has investigated administrative complaints \nabout this problem and, in some cases, ordered limited relief to individual students upon \nfinding violations of the IDEA.!  \n \n\n    14 \nB. Original Charge \nScope of the Neutral Expert#s Work in Phase I \nPhase I is intended to be a statewide evaluation regarding the use of Shortened School Days \nto inform negotiations over remedies, if warranted, in Phase II. The scope of the Neutral \nExpert#s work in Phase I is as follows: \na. Determine the sources of information from which to gather evidence regarding use \nof Shortened School Days for the Target Population. These sources of information \ncould include (but would not be limited to): \ni. Records and data in ODE#s  possession relevant to Shortened School Day \nplacements for the Target Population; \nii. State  and district  statutes,  policies, guidelines,  processes, and  procedures \nrelevant to Shortened School Day placements for the Target Population; \niii.  Student-level  state  and  district  data  relevant  to  Shortened  School  Day \nplacements for the Target Population; \niv.  Interviews  regarding  Shortened  School  Day  placements  for  the  Target \nPopulation with individuals and/or focused groups of state and district staff, \nstudents, parents, guardians, various advisory committees, parent organizations, \nsubject-matter experts, and counsel for the parties; \nv. Targeted site visits to review individual student files and make classroom \nobservations for information related to Shortened School Day placements for the \nTarget Population. \nb. Gather information from the sources identified in (a) or otherwise determined \nrelevant  by  the  Neutral  Expert  through  data  collection,  document  review,  and \ninterviews needed to understand the data. The time period for the data collection shall \nbe from the 2017-2018 school year to the present, except to the extent the Neutral \nExpert determines that obtaining data from earlier school years is appropriate. The \ninformation gathering shall be completed within three (3) months after retention of the \nNeutral Expert; such time period may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties \nor, if the parties cannot agree, pursuant to an extension granted by Judge Acosta. \nc. Identify the  conditions under which Shortened School Days are used due to \ndisability-related  behavior  (i.e.,  where,  when,  why,  how  long)  for  the  Target \nPopulation. Plaintiffs and ODE will each supply the Neutral Expert with a checklist of \nessential data elements to be gathered in connection with uses of Shortened School \n \n\n    15 \nDays to assist the parties in determining the appropriateness of the uses of Shortened \nSchool Days. The checklists may be modified by the Neutral Expert as appropriate \nafter consulting with the parties. \nd. Identify and examine the root cause(s) at the state and/or district level of the use of \nShortened School Days due to disability-related behaviors for the Target Population. \ne. Synthesize information collected above and describe the magnitude and scope of the \nuse of Shortened School Days for the Target Population, including: (i) the number of \nstudents in the Target Population placed on Shortened School Days due to disability-\nrelated behaviors; (ii) the length of time that those students are placed on Shortened \nSchool Days; (iii) whether the students\"#placements on Shortened School Days were \nrevisited after any specified period and, if so, what time period; (iv) differences in \nutilization of Shortened School Days for the members of the Target Population based \non district type or student demographics; and (v) descriptive statistics and information \nrelated to the  time  and  location of services received  by students  in the Target \nPopulation. \nf. Identify uses of Shortened School Days for the Target Population that potentially fail \nto meet the requirements of federal law—namely, the IDEA, the ADA, and/or Section \n504—and also identify where districts are implementing positive practices with respect \nto serving the Target Population and/or reducing inappropriate uses of Shortened \nSchool Days. Nothing in this section allows the Neutral Expert to inquire into any \npotential violations of the IDEA, the ADA and/or Section 504 unrelated to the use of \nShortened School Days for the Target Population. \ng. Prepare a report describing the Neutral Expert#s sources used and findings relative \nto (a)-(f) above and, if any, advisory recommendations for Phase II to address the \nexistence of Shortened School Days that potentially fail to meet the requirements of \nfederal law. To the extent the Neutral Expert determines sharing a draft report with the \nparties for comment is appropriate, the Neutral Expert may do so prior to releasing the \nreport. The report shall be completed within six (6) months after retention of the \nNeutral Expert; such time period may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties \nor, if the parties cannot agree, pursuant to an extension granted by Judge Acosta. The \nreport shall be admissible as evidence in any court of law. The report shall not be \nconsidered confidential; to the extent any details of the report are required to remain \nconfidential under federal law, including IDEA and FERPA, to protect the privacy of \n \n\n    16 \nindividually identifiable students, the parties will prepare a version of the report that \nredacts only those details and that can be available to the public. \n \nThe report may include, if appropriate, recommendations for the creation of new \nprograms, hiring of new staff, contracting for services, developing new training \nsystems, redirection of existing resources, or any other possible remedies, including \nrecommending changes to state policies, statutes, or rules. The report may also include, \nif appropriate, recommendations for using existing programs, facilities, and staff to the \nextent those existing resources are adequate. The report may also recommend making \nno changes. Within the report, the Neutral Expert shall include their rationale to \nsupport each recommendation. \nh. The Neutral Expert will have monthly joint phone conferences with the parties and \ntheir counsel to report on progress and the parties will provide feedback to the Neutral \nExpert to ensure that the evaluation is progressing in accordance with the scope of \nwork. The parties may communicate any additional information to the Neutral Expert \nat any time during the evaluation period. \ni. Upon request of the Neutral Expert, the parties will assist the Neutral Expert in \nobtaining access to the sources of information as described in (a) and (b) above and \nODE will provide sufficient administrative support to perform the duties described in \n(a)-(g) above.!  \n \n\n    17 \nC. Barriers \nBarriers \n  We encountered multiple, unanticipated, and unnecessary barriers as we attempted \nto fulfill our charge and obtain the necessary data and anecdotal information from districts, \nincluding scheduling the visits and interviews, to write this report. We feel it is very \nimportant for the readers to have an understanding of these road-blocks when considering \nthe information included in this report and many of our recommendations designed to \nobviate such roadblocks that would prevent ODE from gathering and monitoring the same \ndata in the future. \n \nCOVID-19 \n  We started working on this project in December 2021. At around that same time there \nwas a dramatic surge in the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The parties made it very clear \nto us that not only would travel be difficult, but school districts did not want us to visit, and \nparents did not want to meet face-to-face. The reactions by school districts and parents, \nafraid of having others bringing more of the virus to their area, caused us to pause our \ntravel plans. We switched to setting up meetings using virtual means to quickly move \nforward with the tasks at hand.  \n \nScheduling Problems \n  A great deal of time was spent developing a regionally based travel schedule for each \nmonth targeting districts that represented the state both geographically and by the number \nof students on SSD. This schedule was shared with the parties with the understanding they \nwould be distributing it to the districts. We wanted to move forward in February with travel, \nbut the districts we sought to visit had not received notice of the trip. We wanted to then \nmove forward for travel in March, but the districts still had not received notice of the trip. \nWe ended up contacting districts directly and scheduling virtual meetings and making our \nown travel plans. \n \n \n \n \n\n    18 \nSurvey \n  During our initial stages of planning, we thought we would be able to use the data \nfrom the April 2021 survey. However, early on, after reviewing the data, we discovered \nthat to fulfill our obligation, and have reliable and valid data to analyze, we would need to \ncreate and distribute a new survey for school districts. With the help of Dr. Eric Wells at \nODE a new survey was formatted and distributed to Oregon school districts. The purpose \nof the survey was to gather information that clarified parts of the April 2021 survey that \nwere either vague or left unanswered. We worked very hard to develop a survey that was \nnot only easy to use, but one that allowed for school districts a clear sense of what data \nthey were expected to gather. To ensure we had adequate time to compile and analyze the \ndata a due date was given to all the districts when the survey was sent out. We assigned a \nteam member to be available by email to provide quick responses when districts had \nquestions. Our request for a response to the survey was not very well received.  \n  As a result of the lack of responses by the due date, we sought subpoenas from the \nDOJ to facilitate districts!#responses. The DOJ worked hard to get subpoenas out to all of \nthe remaining school districts, which took additional weeks. This was exactly what was \nneeded to get a much larger number of districts to respond to the survey. In addition to the \nsubpoenas, we sent out individual emails to each district that had not already responded. \nThere were, however, a number of districts that still refused to respond to the survey \nbecause they stated they could not  be compelled to provide information where that \ninformation  did  not  previously  exist,  hindering  our  efforts  to  fully  understand  the \nmagnitude of the problem of shortened school days in Oregon. \n \nRedacted IEPs \n  Many of the districts that refused to answer the survey were also subpoenaed seeking \ndocuments they had in their possession related to the files of students with disabilities on \nshortened school days due to behaviors. We received a lot of documents from these \ndistricts, however, many of the documents were redacted to such an extent it was almost \nimpossible to pull the needed data from them, such as the grade, disability, amounts of SSD \na student was receiving, how long the student was placed on SSD, and when the Step-up \nPlan contemplated the student returning to a full-school day. Some school districts sent \n \n\n    19 \nIEPs and student documents that were appropriately redacted (with only the student \nidentification information blocked out), but they sent them as separate files and pages and \nwith confusing numbers in their title so it took us many hours to figure out which \ndocuments belonged to the same student.  \n \nProvision of Documents \n  In January, 2022, when we sent a list to ODE and the Plaintiffs of information we \nneeded, and visits and interviews we wanted to conduct, we also included a list of student \ndocuments that we wanted to review from districts that had been geographically and \npopulation-wise selected. We were clear that we wanted at least 20 IEPs, along with the \nFBAs and BIPs and any other SSD documentation from each district. At our periodic \nmeetings with the parties we would update them regarding what progress had been made \non receiving documents. It was not until May that we started receiving a few documents \nand the majority of the documents were received mid to late June. This was one reason we \nrequested an extension to provide our investigative report; we had not received student \nIEPs, FBAs, BIPs and SSD documents to review and analyze to determine how the actual \nSSD  process  was  implemented  and  how  long  students  were  being  placed  on  SSD \nthroughout the state.  \n \nClassroom Visits \n  We wanted to see classrooms where students were being educated. As noted above \nCOVID-19 made that initially very difficult. Even as the intense threat of COVID started \nto dissipate, the schools still did not want us to visit classrooms, or even to meet with \nteachers. As we scheduled visits we were often limited to just talking with either the \ndirector of special education or the superintendent, both with a school board attorney \npresent. There were some school districts that would allow us only to meet with the \nsuperintendent at a date four weeks in the future and only for a few minutes. Needless to \nsay, this made fact-finding very difficult and prevented front-line staff from talking openly \nabout any changes they believed needed to be made. However, there was one district that \nmade teachers available to us (without an administrator or attorney present) allowing them \nto speak freely with us. We greatly appreciate their service. \n \n\n    20 \n \nLocal Control \n  In our interviews with ODE and district personnel, it was often stated that the \nminimum oversight and guidance by the ODE was due the fact that Oregon was a local \ncontrol state. Since this was highlighted as an important component of ODE#s authority to \nmonitor and oversee the education of students in the state, we wanted to talk with local \nschool district administrators about their thoughts regarding this concept. However, we \nwere prevented many times from doing this when talking with superintendents/directors of \nspecial education as some district attorneys objected to our questions on this topic. There \nwere other attorneys, however, who would participate in the conversations with district \npersonnel and allowed questions on this topic. At times these attorneys would even chime \nin and provide additional information to help us better understand their perception of the \nconcept.  \n \nParents \n  We spent a lot of our time reaching out to and trying to talk with parents. Very few \nof the initial group of parents we contacted responded or indicated they would be willing \nto talk. Joel Greenburg at DRO then became instrumental in helping pave the way to \nfacilitating contact with many of the parents with whom we talked. Also, we did have \ninstances where we had worked with parents to set up a time and modality to meet and then \nthe parent did not show. There were a number of districts that also told us they would \nprovide us names of parents with whom to talk. However, we received no names of parents \nto talk with from school districts.  \n!  \n \n\n    21 \nIII. Quantitative Summary \n \nQuantitative Summary \n \nBackground \n  As a part of the discussions prior to the interim settlement, ODE requested records on April \n9, 2021, from every Oregon school district. Plaintiffs had requested: (1) records from the 2017-18, \n2018-19, and 2019-20 school years showing districts!#efforts to implement Senate Bill 263, which \nconcerned the use of SSD; and (2) records from the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20 \nschool years documenting the number of students placed on SSD. One hundred and ten Oregon \nschool districts submitted documents including Abbreviated Day Notice and Acknowledgement \nforms, IEPs, and IEP meeting notes. After a review of this survey and analyzing the data the team \ndetermined a new survey would need to be developed and distributed.   \nTo see more detail of our survey, refer to the Methodology in Appendix B.      \nBelow we provide a summary of the quantitative information concerning the survey created \nand distributed in 2022 regarding the use of shortened school days (\"SSD”) for students with \ndisabilities in Oregon schools. We obtained this information from 185 Oregon school districts—\n93% of the state#s school districts, representing approximately 92% of students eligible for special \neducation and related services within the state for each of the target years. We sought information \nindicating how many Oregon public school students with disabilities experienced SSD as a part of \ntheir Individualized Education Program (\"IEP”) over the 2016–2017, 2017–2018, 2018– 2019, and \n2019–2020 school years. In addition to what is described below the reader can refer to the attached \nspreadsheet that includes the data from the four years collected in the survey. We also have graphs \n \n\n    22 \nhighlighting the changes from year-to-year. The data from the survey does not allow for the \ncomparison of how many students were placed on SSD for consecutive or multiple years. When \nasked, districts did have data on the number of students, but did not keep data on how many \nstudents were on SSD for multiple years, and due to the redactions of the IEPs provided, it was \nchallenging to gather this information. This again highlights the needs for clear and accurate data \nkeeping with a consistent format that allows for capturing this data easily.  \n  We were unable to make comparisons from 2016-17 to the 2019-2020 school year as the \ndistricts did not typically collect data from before SB 263. Therefore, the data are from the three \nyears after SB 263. Also, as noted, some of the districts refused to respond to the survey, with \nsome providing examples of redacted IEPs. A number of the redacted IEPs were from 2020-2021 \nand 2021-2022, a period after our reporting responsibility, so it is clear that SSD is continuing to \nthis day. The districts that responded with redacted IEPs often did not provide copies from 2017-\n2018. \n \nSpring 2022 Survey results.   \nI.  As indicated in the previous section the Spring 2022 survey resulted in 93% of the state's     \ndistricts responding. The graph below shows the percent of districts by the census locale that \nresponded.   \n \n\n    23 \n \n    \nA.  The graph below shows the number of students on SSD for each year and the age \nof those students.     \n \n \nElementary  Middle  High \nPre-School  School  School  School  Percent of \nSchool  SWD on  SWD on  SWD on  SWD on  Total SWD  total state \nYear  ASD  ASD  ASD  ASD  on SSD  SECC \n2016-2017  3  182  113  96  394  0.48% \n2017-2018  1  357  159  168  685  0.77% \n2018-2019  3  571  248  207  1029  1.04% \n2019-2020  4  563  227  192  986  1.04% \n \n \n \n\n    24 \n \nB.

How many students on SSD due to behavior had a re-entry/transition plan in place \nto remove them from the SSD.   \n \nIn addition to the above items, the new survey clarified that we were only asking for data on \nstudents with IDEA disabilities who were on SSD due to disability related behavior and provided \ndefinition of \"behavior” and \"re-entry/transition plan” for purposes of the survey.  \n \nData Inconsistencies \n  As noted above, there were challenges with the April 2021 survey and data. We worked to \nlearn from the problems and the information retrieved to develop a new survey that would more \naccurately identify the extent of the use of SSD for Oregon#s IDEA-eligible children. For a greater \ndiscussion of the specific methodology used in the Spring 2022 survey the reader is referred to \nAppendix B. \n  As  we  worked  to  collect  data  through  the  second  survey,  some  problems  with  the \nproduction of the data became evident. Specifically, a number of districts had to be called to clarify \ntheir data, many of the districts reported no specific mechanism for keeping track of the data, one \ndistrict used an intern to collect the data, some of the districts reported the data were kept in a \nnotebook (with the notebook going missing), one of the districts stated the data were kept in the \nhead of the director of special education and when that person passed away the data were gone. \nSome districts refused (under advice from counsel) to respond to the subpoena requesting data for \nthe survey and instead provided redacted (often overly redacted documents rendering them almost \nuseless) IEPs and meeting notes. However, we reviewed the redacted IEPs and, determined the \nnumber of students placed on shortened school day from specific districts and therefore included \n \n\n    27 \ntheir data as a part of our results. Finally, when there were inconsistencies with the data submitted \nin April 2021 from the data that were submitted in the Spring 2020 survey, we contacted the \ndistricts and sought clarification. We worked tirelessly to answer questions as quickly as possible \nand provide clarity to the districts. \n   Despite these challenges, we feel the data are a fairly accurate representation of the number \nof students eligible for special education and related services placed on a shortened school day due \nto behaviors for the school years 2017/18 through 2019/20. Although part of our task included \nreviewing data from 2016, we are less confident in our data from that year as 2016-2017 was \nbefore SB 263, and many districts reported that they did not keep data on the students they placed \non SSD prior to SB 263. The challenges discussed above and lack of consistent data and reporting, \nlead us to conclude there needs to be a more reliable means and method for obtaining the data on \nthe number of students who are placed on a shortened school day (for a more detailed explanation \nof our recommendations please see page 49). \n  From our research there is only one state that has school districts report to the state \ndepartment of education whether a student is placed on a shortened school day: Oklahoma. In our \nconversations  with  administrators  and  special  education  professionals  in  Oklahoma,  they \nunanimously stated that the reporting of students on shortened school days is not burdensome, is \nvery easy to do, and due to the methods established by the state, all but guarantees easier \naggregation of the data and clearly represents the number of students placed on a shortened school \nday (for a more detailed explanation of our recommendations please see page 49). \n \n \n \n \n\n    28 \nState Demographic Data \nThe state of Oregon currently consists of 197 school districts. The graphs below show the number \nof schools that reside in different locales by census sizes and the number of students with \ndisabilities in each of those locales.   \n \n \n \n \n\n    29 \n \nYear-to-Year Data \n \n \nAs one can see from the above graph, it appears there has been a increase in the number of students \nplaced on SSD. In 2017-2018 there were 685 students placed on SSD. In 2018-2019 there were \n1029 students placed on SSD. In 2019-2020 there were 986 students placed on SSD. This increase \nmay be due to a combination of two factors: 1) an actual increase in the number of students placed \non SSD and 2) better data gathering by districts. However, as these are baseline data on this topic, \na conclusive answer cannot be determined. The prompt made by ODE in April 2021 spurred \ndistricts into gathering data on the number of students placed on SSD, thus we feel we have a good \nrepresentation of the numbers of students placed on SSD over the past few years in Oregon.  \nI.  The majority of students on SSD due to behavior have Other Health Impairment, Emotional \nDisturbance, or Autism as their primary eligibility category.   \n \n\n    30 \n \n \nII.  The majority of students on SSD due to behavior are found in the following 5 locales: City: \nMid-Size, City: Small, Town: Fringe, Town: Distant, and Town Remote. \n \n \nIII. The location where the majority of SWD reside do not necessarily represent the same locales \nof where the majority of students on SSD, due to behavior, reside. This can be seen by \ncomparing the graph above with this one below.   \n \n\n    31 \n \n \nDocumentation (Parent Permission, Reason for SSD in IEP, Re-Entry Plan) \n  The data we collected sheds light on the number of signed parent acknowledgement forms, \nhow many IEPs included a reason for the student being on an SSD, and how many students had \ntransition plans in place. As evident in the graph below, there was a steady increase in the use of \neach of these from the 2016-17 school year to the 2018-19 school year that remained fairly steady \nfor the 2019-20 school year. We attempted to clarify the number of students with re-entry plans as \na part of their program. The previous April 2021 survey did not find many students with reentry \nplans. In addition, we looked at the impact of COVID on the use of SSD for students who could \nnot abide by the safety protocols.   \n \n\n    32 \n \n \n \nSynopsis \n1)  There were significant increases in the use of the Signed Parent Acknowledgement Form and \nthe inclusion of the reason for the student being on SSD in the IEP from 2016-17 to 2019-20. \nHowever, there was a slight decline from 2018-19 to 2019-2020.  \n \n\n    33 \n2)  There are significant differences between the number students with disabilities who are on \nSSD and the number of Signed parent acknowledgement, reasons for SSD included in the IEP, \nand re-entry plans.   \n3)  In addition to the data presented above, based on our conversations with districts across the \nstate, it appears there is a misunderstanding as to when the Parent Acknowledgement form \nneeds to be used. We found the absence of guidance on the implementation of placing students \non  SSD  in  accordance  with  SB  263  led  to  confusion  as  to  whether  the  Parent \nAcknowledgement form applies to students with IEPs since the parents are part of the IEP team \nwho is making the placement decision. (See Recommendation/Findings page 49) \n●  COVID did not appear to have much of an impact on the students placed on SSD. The only \nyear students were reported to be on SSD due to inability to follow COVID Safety \nprotocols was 2019-20. Of the 991 students reported on SSD due to behavior 32 (3%) were \nsaid to not be able to follow the COVID safety protocols.   \n \nSummary of Data \nWhen reviewing the data, we found that there were 57 districts who did not have any \nstudents on SSD due to behavior for the 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 school years. The three \ndistricts with the highest 3-year average of students placed on SSD due to behavior were Eugene, \nMedford, and Springfield.   \n \nTotal \nSchool  School  Pre- Elementar Middle  High  SWD on \nDistrict  Year  School  y School  School  School  SSD \nEugene SD  2016-2017  DNC  DNC  DNC  DNC  0 \nEugene SD  2017-2018  DNC  14  16  39  69 \n \n\n    34 \nEugene SD  2018-2019  DNC  48  20  46  114 \nEugene SD  2019-2020  DNC  24  8  35  67 \n   3 yr Ave     28.67  14.67  40.00  83.33 \nSpringfield  2016-2017  0  0  0  0  0 \nSD \nSpringfield  2017-2018  0  39  13  15  67 \nSD \nSpringfield  2018-2019  0  55  9  16  80 \nSD \nSpringfield  2019-2020  0  45  5  12  62 \nSD \n   3 yr Ave  0.00  46.33  9.00  14.33  69.67 \nMedford SD  2016-2017  0  3  0  0  3 \nMedford SD  2017-2018  0  52  7  12  71 \nMedford SD  2018-2019  0  18  6  7  31 \nMedford SD  2019-2020  0  43  9  9  61 \n   3 yr Ave  0.00  37.67  7.33  9.33  54.33 \n \n \n \n   \n   \nOVERALL SUMMARY  \n●  The majority of SWD in Oregon reside in Cities and Large Suburbs.  \n●  The majority of students placed on SSD reside in Small and Mid-Size cities and towns.   \n●  Over 1% of students with disabilities in Oregon are being placed on SSD due to behavior. \n●  The majority of students placed on SSD are of elementary age.   \n●  The majority of students placed on an SSD have a primary disability of Other Health \nImpairment, Emotional Disturbance, or Autism.   \n \n\n    35 \n●  There is not consistent use of the signed Parent Acknowledgement form, including the \nreason for SSD in the IEP, or the use of a re-entry plan.   \n●  COVID did not appear to have much of an impact on the student placed on SSD.   \n \n \n!  \n \n\n    36 \nIV. Qualitative Summary \n \n  In addition to the quantitative data, we also gathered qualitative data to understand \nthe why behind the numbers. We interviewed administrators, teachers, behavior specialists, \nschool psychologists, as well as parents from across the state to hear their comments related \nto this issue. The quantitative and qualitative data together allow for a deeper understanding \nof the issue. \n  Based on the survey results from April 2021 and comments from the focus groups \nwith the ODE staff we identified 20 school districts across the state for which we desired \nto interact with school personnel. We planned multiple weeks where we, as a team, could \ninterview individuals from different school districts. We relied on ODE/DOJ to contact the \nschool districts to let them know we would like to meet with them, talk with staff and \nteachers, and review IEPs and BIPs. As discussed in the Barriers section, multiple obstacles \nwere placed in our path and thwarted or delayed our efforts.  \n  Some districts never contacted us, making visits very difficult. Some of the districts \nwould only talk with us if their attorney was present. Some of the districts would only allow \nus to meet with the superintendent for 30 minutes on a day that we did not plan on being \nin Oregon, weeks in the future. It was not uncommon for attorneys for the districts to \ncontact us and decline to allow us to meet with school personnel, stating the teachers were \ntoo stressed to meet with us, they did not have coverage of the classes so there was no way \nthey could meet with us, or the topic was too emotional for them to talk about and should \nnot be addressed with the teachers.  \n  Despite our clarifying, multiple times, that the work we sought to accomplish was \nrelated to the lawsuit against ODE, and their districts were not targeted for a lawsuit, the \nresponse rate was poor. When we were able to meet with staff it was often with only the \nspecial education administrators or supervisors with their attorney present. While some \nschool board attorneys were collaborative and engaged in the process, some were not. One \nattorney  would  object  to  questions  we  posed,  most  notably  objectionable  were  any \nquestions related to local control. These were important questions as local control was often \ngiven as a justification for why there was not more oversight by ODE on district#s use of \n \n\n    37 \nSSD. These objections hindered our process and prevented our full understanding from \ntheir perspective about the way ODE does work with local school districts. \nSome districts were concerned about talking with us because they were worried that \nthings they said would be used against them in future lawsuits or complaint investigations. \nWe sought clarity from both the Plaintiffs and Defendants who assured us that it was highly \nunlikely  the  information  would  be  used  in  such  a  manner.  We  began  ALL  of  our \ndiscussions with school staff clarifying our role in the lawsuit, clarifying information they \nprovided would reference not them specifically, and reiterating the lawsuit was against \nODE and not their individual school district \n  We also stated to districts and families multiple times that we did not need, nor \nwant, personal identifiable information about students, as this was raised multiple times as \na reason why we could not meet with a variety of school staff or receive requested \ndocuments.  We  repeatedly  told  school  staff  and  parents  that  we  when  did  include \ncomments they made we would not include information that would identify who made the \ncomment. We would only state, for example, \"A teacher in Oregon stated . . .”, instead of \nnaming a specific teacher or a specific district. This also did not allay their fears that \ninformation provided to us would be used in either a future compliance investigation by \nthe state or in future lawsuits involving Disability Rights Oregon. In addition, we stated \nthat if any document was provided to us, either a flow-chart for decision making, a sample \nletter to a parent, an example of a behavior management plan, or a Step-up Plan for bringing \nthe student back to full-time, we would make sure to get their explicit written permission \nbefore including such a document as an example. As noted below, some of the districts \n(before the subpoena) were more than willing to share documents and examples.    \n  We  also let  districts know  we were  seeking examples  not  only of  ideas  for \nimprovement for ODE as it works to oversee the use of SSD due to behavior with IDEA-\neligible students, but also examples of what supports ODE was already providing that \ndistricts found effective and would want ODE to continue or expand. The statements made \nby district personnel related to what ODE has done well or areas of strength related to other \nareas of special education, outside of SSD due to behavior, are not included, as our contract \nexplicitly outlined the scope and topics of our report.  \n \n\n    38 \n  There were some districts, however, that were incredibly open (even prior to the \nsubpoenas) and arranged times for us to meet with staff at all levels, did not monitor our \nconversations, provided us documents, and worked very hard to assist in our learning about \nthe process of placing and working with students on shortened school days. These districts \nshared a lot of vital information, allowing us to learn important and necessary components \nof the provision of appropriate special education services for eligible students across the \nstate of Oregon. We came away from every conversation with these helpful school districts \nwith an increased acuity of the issue. This report would be incredibly different, lacking in \ndetail, and lacking in recommendations if these districts had not been as forthcoming as \nthey were. A great deal of the specific verbiage for the recommendations comes directly \nfrom the examples and words from the special education directors and teachers with whom \nwe met, which was only reinforced by the quantitative data we collected.  \n  There  were  also  a  few  attorneys  who  represented  school  districts  who  were \nincredibly helpful, arranging focus groups with multiple directors of special education, \ngoing into great length on the role of ODE and how they felt it should interact with local \nschool districts. These attorneys, when they were on the call, also provided a wealth of \nbackground information that greatly contributed to our work. We realize their role is to \nprotect the interests of their clients-the school districts-but they also had the greater good \nin mind as they discussed the role of ODE and the recommendations for improvement. \nTheir interests were not just their school districts, but all student with disabilities in Oregon \nas well. \n  In addition to school staff, we wanted to make sure the parents who were willing to \ntalk with us could do so without feeling concerned there may be retaliation or other \nramifications against their children or families. After extensive back and forth between the \nparties we reached an acceptable statement that would be made to the parents as a part of \nthe interviews.  \nAs part of my work, I am preparing a final report for the parties. In my final \nreport, I will not identify any parents or students. I will do my best to keep all \nparent identities confidential; however, if requested by either party, I will be \nrequired to provide them. That said, the parties are committed to attempting to \nresolve the lawsuit through a settlement.   \n \n \n\n    39 \nUnless required by law, the parties will not share parent identities with school \ndistricts. I will not share parent identities with school districts. \n \n  Finally, the qualitative piece was made very difficult by the impact of COVID-19. \nWhen this project started, we hoped to very quickly come to Oregon and meet with special \neducation directors, teachers, and parents. However, the Omicron variant of COVID rose \nrather precipitously making travel extremely difficult. This coupled with the fact that we \ndid not want to unwittingly spread and expose the virus to others prevented a lot of travel \nfor the first few months of the project. There is a lot that can be gleaned from a face-to face \nconversation, and we did the best we could to facilitate in-person visits \n  When face-to-face was not an option, we used Zoom/Google Meets/Microsoft \nTeams as a means to meet with school district personnel, subject matter experts, and with \nparents. While this was not ideal, we found many individuals appeared comfortable and \nconversant in the use of these forms of technology to interact with others after two years \nof virtual interactions due to COVID. These virtual meeting allowed for more personal \nconversations,  greater  flexibility  in  scheduling,  less  travel for  parents  to  centralized \nlocations, and significantly less exposure to COVID. We had genuine conversations with \nsome of the participants that enabled us to form and make the recommendations we have \nas a part of this report. The willingness of all the individuals to talk with us as a part of this \nproject could not have happened without the use of technology in this form.  \n  Given the reluctance of some of the districts to talk with us, the necessity of \nsubpoenas for answering the survey and meeting with us, and the problems with travel as \na result of COVID, we are actually pleased with the qualitative indicators that we obtained. \nThe conversations we had with the many district staff from across the state provide the \nspirit of what is necessary to provide appropriate recommendations included in this report. \nWe also sought input from ODE staff, education service directors, complaint investigators, \nand subject matter experts. The opinions expressed as a part of these interviews provided \nsignificant  insight,  and  combined  with  the  feedback  from  district  staff  and  parents, \nelucidated the challenges and spirit necessary to effectuate the recommendations included \nin this report.  \n  Eligible students being placed on a shortened school does not occur in a vacuum. \nOne cannot only talk about the students who are on shortened school day without also \n \n\n    40 \ntalking about the training for teachers, administrators, school psychologists, behavior \nspecialists, substitute teachers, and the needs of parents. There are many factors that go \ninto placing a student on shortened school day. We did hear about the eligibility process \nfor special education, staff shortages, and problems with transportation staff understanding \nand responding appropriately to the needs of the target student. We also heard about the \nneeds of bus drivers, the needs for providing FAPE, issues related to least restrictive \nenvironments, in addition to issues related to compensatory education for students who are \nplaced on a shortened school day. The behavior needs of the students were apparent in \nmany  different  areas  related  to  instruction  and  impacted  many  different  jobs  and \nresponsibilities.  \nThe questions that we used to gather information as a part of the interviews were \ndeveloped independent of both parties. The focus of the questions related to the process of \nhow a child is placed on a shortened school day, how frequently they are monitored, the \nrole  of  the  IEP  teams  in  the  decision-making  process,  the  use  of  FBAs/BIPs,  the \ndevelopment of a plan for bringing the student back into school for a full-day of education, \nand the specific strategies and skills that are to be taught to the student to facilitate their \ncoming back to school.    \nWe tailored our questions to the specific roles and responsibilities of the individuals \nwe were addressing. We did ask all district employees we talked with, what guidance or \nsupport they sought from ODE. The classroom teachers, who were all very forthcoming, \nall  deferred  that  question  to  their  supervisors  as  they  felt  it  was  the \nsupervisors/administrators role to address or seek guidance from ODE while their job was \nto listen to and implement what their supervisors/administrators stated was necessary.  \n  One item that was overarching as a part of the discussions was the need for \nclarification or additional guidance from ODE about the requirements of SB 263 as it \nrelates to students with disabilities on SSD due to disability related behaviors, the need for \nefficient and effective data gathering and reporting, and the need for support when there is \na student with intense behavioral needs. Please see the recommendations section of this \ndocument. \nWe are deeply indebted to the districts, ODE staff, and parents, who by taking time \nfrom their schedules and talking to use despite any reservations they may have had, \n \n\n    41 \nprovided  us  important  information  for  this  report.  The  conversations  with  teachers, \nprincipals, administrators and families, all clarified the need for increased guidance from \nODE in specific areas related to students on SSD due to disability related behavior. These \nqualitative statements give the meat on the bone to the quantitative data numbers that were \na part of the survey. The two work very closely with each other and are necessary to read \ntogether, not in isolation.   \n \n!  \n \n\n    42 \nV. Findings \n \nFindings \n \n1)  The Quantitative findings from the survey included: \na)  ·       The majority of SWD in Oregon reside in Cities and Large Suburbs. \nb)  ·       The majority of students on SSD reside in small and mid-size cities and towns.  \nc)  ·       Over 1% of student with disabilities are being placed on SSD due to behavior. \nd)  ·       The majority of students on SSD are of elementary age.  \ne)  ·       The majority of student placed on an SSD have a primary disability of Other Health \nImpairment, Emotional Disturbance, and Autism.  \nf)  ·       There is no consistent use of the signed parent permission, including the reason for \nSSD in the IEP, or the use a Re-entry plan.  \ng)  ·       COVID did not appear to have much of an impact on the student placed on SSD.   \n2)  Based on our research, there are no mandated trainings provided by ODE on the topic of \nShortened School Days (SSD), on how to prevent putting students on SSD, or on how to ensure \neffective use of Functional Behavior Assessments (FBAs) and Behavior Intervention Plans \n(BIPs), etc. There were some trainings provided by ODE at the COSA Conference (Coalition \nof School Administrators) regarding the new SB263 legislation and what it meant, but the \ntrainings were not about how to prevent or change the SSD process (and all trainings provided \n \n\n    43 \nat the COSA conference are an option for attendees). We were made aware of other trainings \nand guidance provided however, all were voluntary and districts had to seek out these trainings \nand supports, and we list those below: \na)  ODE guidance from 2018 on SB 263.6  \nb)  Hungerford Law Firm guidance for \"Step-Up Plans.” While we did not have access to this \nguidance, it was mentioned by multiple districts.  \nc)  Multiple ODE PowerPoints  \ni)  New Reduced School Day Legislation from Fall 2017; \nii)  HB 3318: New Legislation Regarding FBA and BIP best practices and implementation \nresources – Coalition of Oregon School Administrators (COSA) June 2018;  \niii) SB 263 – Shortened School Day – undated;  \niv) Responding to Students on Shortened School Day Programs – undated. \n3)   Due to the level of redactions of IEP documents received from multiple school districts, we \nwere unable to determine the prevalence of students remaining on SSD over multiple years,  \n4)  There is not an effective and efficient way for the state to gather and monitor data on the use \nof SSD. \n5)  Although most school districts opted to input cumulative information of students on SSD into \nour 2022 survey, there were some that neglected to respond, or refused and, instead, provided \nredacted copies of the students !IEPs. For some districts, the level of redaction made it \nimpossible to confirm if the same student was on SSD for multiple years. However, the districts \nthat  provided  files  (appropriately  redacted  only  to  remove  and  personally  identifiable \n \n6 https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and \nfamily/SpecialEducation/publications/Documents/sb263.pdf \n \n\n    44 \ninformation) for every student on SSD due to behavior allowed us to gather data and identify \nthe following trends: \na)  The most common IDEA eligibility categories were Emotional Disability (ED), Autism \n(AU), and Other Health Impaired (OHI). This is consistent with the April 2021 survey and \nour 2022 survey. \nb)  Many students started kindergarten on a SSD. \nc)  Most of the students had SSD information documented in their IEPs. \nd)  We did not find a single IEP that documented a student returning to full-day. \ne)  A large number of the students were on a SSD for multiple years. \nf)  Very few of the students on SSD were provided instruction outside of school (i.e., \ninstruction in the home or via video). For example, if the student only attended school from \n8:30am-11:30am and left  school  at  11:30am,  the district  did  not  provide  any  more \ninstruction to the student that day. \ng)  In the IEPs we reviewed that were written after SB 263 was enacted in June 2017, the vast \nmajority of the students (school years of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019) did not have a \nShortened  School  Day  notice  and  acknowledgement  form  that  was  signed  by  a \nparent/guardian. During the 2019-2020 school year there was an increase in the use of the \nsigned notice and acknowledgement forms.  \nh)  Most Functional Behavior Assessments (FBAs) and Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs) \nwere each one-page templates with spaces for IEP teams to fill in a few words or phrases.  \ni)  In most of the IEPs we reviewed from the 2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019 school \nyears there are no written plans regarding how that student#s SSD will be reviewed, nor \nany delineated timeframe, description of data to be collected and analyzed, or review dates.  \n \n\n    45 \nj)  In most of the IEPs we reviewed from the 2019-2020 school year, there was a \"Step-Up” \nplan which wrote out the timeframe, review meeting dates, specific behaviors the student \nneeds to improve, team members, and data to be collected.   \n6)  During interviews with school staff, administrators, lawyers, and parents, a standard \"Step-\nUp Plan” was described to us as being written and included in a student#s IEP when the \nIEP team decides to place a student on SSD. This plan details the procedures to be followed \nthat will eventually allow the student to return to attending school for a full-day.  \na)  During interviews with school staff and administrators, it was stated that most of the \nstudents are placed on SSD for multiple marking periods.  \nb)  However, in interviews with parents and upon review of IEP documents, it was clear \nthat most students are on SSD for multiple years. \n7)  In the interviews with school district personnel from across the state, there were two main \nreasons for why students eligible for special education and related services were placed on \nSSD due to behaviors: \"stamina” and \"safety.” Administrators and teachers alike explained \nthat some students cannot handle being at school all day and thus need a shortened school \nday to behave appropriately and safely for the abbreviated time they attend school.  \n8)  Based on discussion with school staff and administrators, written language in flowcharts \nor procedural documents, and written language in IEP documents (including FBAs, BIPs \nand Step-Up Plans) it is clear school districts and ODE leadership considered SSD as a part \nof the continuum of placement options for students eligible for special education—rather \nthan a temporary last resort with a cognizable plan to return to a full-day. \n9)  We learned through our interviews with staff, administrators, lawyers, and parents, there \nare currently Shortened School Day Programs for students eligible for special education \n \n\n    46 \n(and unidentified general education students). These programs have names (we heard about \nor found in IEP documents at least five different named SSD Programs) and most of them \nappear to be \"half-day” program, in which one half of the students in the program attend \nfor the morning (i.e., 8:30am-11:30am) and half of them attend for the afternoon (12:00pm-\n3:00pm). These are permanent programs that have been established to operate year-\nround—and have been in operation for multiple years—with full-time staff and most \nstudents remain in these programs for several years. \n10)  We found more often than not that the students are required to \"earn” their way back into \na full school day, for example, demonstrating a particular number of \"good days” when \nthey were at school for the shortened length of time. Some, but not all, districts were \nteaching the students the behavioral skills needed to be able to better function in a school \nsetting for more hours.   \n11)  In many of the IEPs we reviewed of students were placed on SSD, there were many districts \nthat did not include any behavioral goals and often there was no Behavior Intervention Plan \n(BIP) included.  \n12)  Based on interviews with school staff and parents and review of IEPs, it was clear that \nmany times districts do not take into consideration the impact on the families (i.e., parents \nhaving to change jobs or hours of work to be during the night, locating childcare services, \npaying for childcare services, etc.) when the district required their child to stay at home \nduring school hours. The impact on families was further exacerbated when the district did \nnot provide transportation services in the middle of the day and when students were \nassigned to programs that were not in their neighborhood school. \n \n\n    47 \n13)  Students with disabilities are being placed on SSD without parental consent. SB 263 \ncontains language that requires parental consent and forbids unilateral placement in one \nportion yet only requires meaningful participation in another. \na)  SB 263; Section 2. (1)(d) states $!\"Unilaterally place!#means a placement by a school \ndistrict without consent (italics added) of the student#s parent. Section 2. (3)(a)(B) states \n\"After the opportunity for the student#s parents to meaningfully participate in a meeting \nto discuss the placement;”  \nb)  Several IEP documents that we reviewed included a SSD notice and acknowledgement \nform that had written notes on it by the parent, an advocate or school staff person that \nthe parent disagreed with the SSD placement decision. The student was placed on SSD \nregardless. \nc)  Information gained through interviews with school staff, administrators and parents \nrevealed that Informal Removal (IR) is: 1) being used frequently with students with \ndisabilities due to behavior difficulties; and 2) little to no data are being collected or \nrecorded regarding its use. Informal Removal is when a student is taken out of the \nclassroom and forced to remain somewhere else in the school without receiving any \ninstruction  OR  when  a  school  staff  member  or  administrator  calls  a  student#s \nparent/guardian to come pick up the student and take him or her home because the \nstudent#s behaviors are too difficult to handle.  \n14)  Rural areas appear to be more heavily impacted as demonstrated by numbers collected in \nthe survey and IEP documents collected from rural areas.  \n \n\n    48 \na)  Information gained from parent, staff and administrator interviews coincided with this \ndata and provided reasons that pointed to lack of trained staff available and lack of mental \nand behavioral health services in the community. \nb)  Information gained from the Behavior Analyst Certification Board website and through \ninterviews with ODE staff, school staff, administrators, lawyers and parents indicate \nthat there is currently a significant shortage of Board Certified Behavior Analysts \n(BCBAs), Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst BCaBAs) and highly trained \nbehavior specialists in the entire state of Oregon (as of June 20, 2022 only 23 active \nBCBAs and BCaBAs listed as living and practicing in Oregon). Many districts \nexpressed opposition to the use of BCBAs; however, these same districts had no \nalternative effective program to address student behavior and had higher rates of SSD.  \n15)  There is currently no way for ODE to efficiently collect data on and monitor the use of \nSSD  using  their  current  practices  (this  includes  electronic  data  collection,  IEP \ndocumentation, paper records, or personnel to monitor the practice).   \n!  \n \n\n    49 \nVI. Recommendations  \n \n  Specific Recommendations \n  We have broken down the recommendations for changes based on the IDEA and its \nregulations, quantitative results from the survey and other state data gathered, IEP files that were \nreviewed from many school districts, and qualitative information received from interviews and \ncomments from school district personnel and parents/guardians we interviewed. We outlined the \nfoundation  for  these  recommendations  within  the  Findings  section.  This  section  on \nRecommendations should not be read without first reviewing the quantitative and qualitative data \nand the findings, which form the basis for our recommendations. It should be noted that these \nrecommendations are directed to the Oregon Department of Education (ODE). While many of the \nfindings are based on what is occurring within individual school districts, it is important for ODE \nto become aware so they are able to follow through with their general supervisory responsibility \nand implement to make statewide changes and improvements regarding the use of Shortened \nSchool Day (SSD) with students with disabilities. \n  We have divided our recommendations into two categories: Priority and Strongly Consider. \nThe Priority recommendations are those that should be addressed as soon as possible. The Strongly \nConsider recommendations are ones that not only will improve services for students eligible for \nspecial  education  and  related  services  but  will  also  improve  communication  and  working \nrelationships  with  parents.  Not  every  section  includes  accompanying  Strongly  Consider \nrecommendations. \n \n \n \n \n\n    50 \nRecommendation One \nBased on our findings that there is a lack of ODE guidance on Shortened School Days and a \npervasive lack of understanding of the relationship between SSD and least restrictive environment \n(LRE) we recommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nIssue guidance on the use of SSD with students   \ndue  to  behavior.  We  have  provided  sample \nguidance in the form of questions and answers \nlocated in Appendix V. \nDevelop and issue guidance on how the use of   \nShortened School Day and the IDEA mandate \nto  place  students  in  their  least  restrictive \nenvironment and intertwine.  \nConduct mandatory training for all LEAs on the   \nuse  of  SSD  for  special  education  staff  and \nadministrators. This training must include: \n1.  a universal format for the creation and \nuse of “Transition Plans” or “Step-Up \nPlans”;  \n2.  the data collection and analysis process \nthat needs to occur and be included in \nthe IEP documentation; and  \n3.  how to develop a Plan that does not \nrequire a student to “earn” their way \nback to a full day of school.  \n \n\n    51 \n1.  Set up a new position within ODE who   \nis the point person for districts and \nparents for all SSD questions/concerns.  \n●  This will ensure that all districts and \nparents receive consistent information \nand guidance. \n●  ODE point person would work with an \ninteragency support team (see more \nexplanation of the team in Appendix  \nT) to provide the necessary \nsupports/resources to districts and \nmonitor the effectiveness of the team’s \nefforts. \n●  ODE point person would also set up, \ncoordinate, and, when appropriate, \nprovide trainings on SSD. \n2.  Develop  and provide  training  on  the   \nLeast  Restrictive Environment  (LRE) \ncontinuum  and  how  behavior  goals, \nFunctional  Behavior  Assessments \n(FBAs),  and  Behavior  Intervention \nPlans  (BIPs)  are  the  essential  tools \nnecessary  to  ensure  students  are \neducated  in  the  LRE  and  to  prevent \nplacement  on  a  SSD  and  to  return \nstudents  from  a  SSD  to  full-day \nattendance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    52 \nRecommendation Two \nBased on our finding that there is a lack of necessary staffing in rural areas and for hard-to-fill \npositions across the state, we recommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nDesignate IDEA funding to provide stipends  Designate funding to provide full university \nfor  special  education  teachers  and  school  scholarships for in-state tuition of a select \npsychologists to be paid at designated intervals  group of students who commit to becoming \nduring the school year.  special education teachers (e.g., Teaching \nFellows”) in exchange for working in remote \nareas in Oregon for five years. This could be \nin the form of a promissory note that is \nforgiven at the completion of five years of \nservice. While this may not be something \nODE can fund independently, it is something \nODE can advocate for legislation to create this \nprogram and/or develop partnerships with \nstate universities. \nDesignate  IDEA  funding  to  provide  an  ODE could provide full university \nadditional  stipend  for  special  education  scholarships for special education teachers in \nteachers and school psychologists in remote  exchange for working in urban areas for five \nareas.  years. This could be in the form of a \npromissory note for which is forgiven at the \ncompletion of five years of service. \n  Designate funding to provide full university \nscholarships for in-state graduate programs for \na select group of students who commit to \nbecoming school psychologists in exchange \nfor working in remote areas for five years. \nThis could be in the form of a promissory note \nfor which is forgiven at the completion of five \nyears of service. The funding should include  \nany necessary supervision or practicums. If the \nODE does not to use IDEA funds for, the \nODE can advocate for legislation to create this \nprogram and/or develop partnerships with \nstate universities. \n \n\n    53 \n  ODE could provide full scholarships for school \npsychologists and work with the Universities to \npay  for  any  necessary  supervision  or \npracticums in exchange for working in urban \nareas for five years. This could be in the form \nof a promissory note for which is forgiven at \nthe completion of five years of service. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRecommendation Three \n  Based on our finding that there is a lack of behavior support resources and training for \nteachers, administrators, and school staff to understand the functions of behavior, preventative and \nproactive behavioral interventions, and appropriate consequence interventions (i.e., reactive and \nreinforcers), as well as the fact that almost every district noted the lack of mental health services \nand resources for districts to access and coordinate with to meet students!#needs, we therefore \nrecommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nEstablish  a  statewide  program  to  offer  Provide full scholarships for qualified \nRegistered  Behavior  Technician  (RBT)  individuals seeking to become BCBAs who \ntraining for paraprofessionals and other school  already work for ODE or a local school \nstaff as well as required supervision by regional  district and pay for any necessary supervision \nBoard Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs).  in exchange for working in rural areas for five \nyears. This could be in the form of a \npromissory note for which is forgiven at the \ncompletion of five years of service. \n \n\n    54 \nEmploy regional BCBAs to train and  Create a Joint Task Force with Oregon \nsupervise RBTs statewide. The number of  Teacher Standards and Practices Commission \nregions may not always align with the ESDs,  to consider changes in the regulations for all \nas the rural ESDs are not accessible for some  teacher training programs and administrator \ndistricts. The number of regional BCBAs must  training programs to include requirements for \nbe sufficient to be accessible to the districts  instruction and establishing an expected level \nthey serve and able to fulfill their ethical  of proficiency/understanding of:  \nduties of supervision.  ●  the IDEA’s requirement of a free \nappropriate public education (FAPE); \n●  LRE and the calculation of placement; \n●  Manifestation Determination Reviews \n(MDRs) particularly as they relate to \ninformal suspensions; \n●  the provision of appropriate behavior \nsupports; and \n●  the functions of behavior and the \nappropriate consequences. \nProvide a stipend to paraprofessionals who   \nsuccessfully complete the RBT training. This \nstipend should be increased for serving in rural \nareas. \nCreate and fund regional Intensive Interagency   \nSupport  Teams  that  districts  can  call  on  to \nprovide training, consultation, and coaching in \naddressing behavior needs. (See Appendix T \nfor a description of an Intensive Interagency \nSupport Team). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    55 \n \nRecommendation Four \nDue to the need to increase monitoring of the use of SSD by ODE, we recommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nPurchase, implement, and mandate the use of  Collect data on staffing shortages to identify \na Statewide IEP system.   the areas of greatest need and determine the \nbest use of state resources to address the \nshortages. We have made several \nrecommendations regarding staffing shortages, \nas we observed districts throughout the state \nutilizing SSD due to staffing shortages. There \nare no data available on vacant positions \nwithout going to each individual district. A \nmethod to formally collect these data would \nensure the stipends are being provided to the \ngreatest areas of need. This could also be in \nthe form of a statewide platform to advertise \njob openings for any prospective employee to \nbe able to see openings across the state. \nUsing a Statewide IEP system, collect data on   \nthe use of SSD as part of the annual monitoring \nprocess and monitor the prevalence and use of \nSSD quarterly once a statewide IEP system is \nin place. \nUse the monitoring data to identify districts   \nwith a greater percentage of students on SSD to \nprovide  supports,  resources,  and  corrective \nactions, when necessary, to decrease the use of \nSSD.  \nEnsure that included in the monitoring process   \nis a way to examine low incidence situations \nsuch as SSD.   \n \n\n    56 \nODE needs to provide guidance on calculating   \nthe amount of time a child is in school. School \nday = “bell to bell” v. “child’s school day” \nhttps://www.oregon.gov/ode/reports-and-\ndata/SpEdReports/BootCampMaterials/Proces\nsContentManual.docx \nIssue clear guidance, with examples, on how to   \ncorrectly  document  a  student’s  setting \nparticularly when a child is on SSD. Districts \nare  calculating  the  child’s  setting  without \nnoting the limited amount of time a child is \nattending due to SSD. \nIssue  guidance  that  districts  may  not  use   \ntransportation  needs  and/or  administrative \nconvenience  to  dictate  the  timeframe  of \nstudents  with  disabilities  attendance.  The \nguidance should explain that “school day” has \nthe  same  definition  for  students  with \ndisabilities and nondisabled students.  \nAdopt policies/regulations that require   \ndistricts to notify ODE when a student has \nreached 30 school days on a SSD placement. \nUpon notification, the ODE Point Person will \nimmediately coordinate the involvement of \nthe regional Intensive Interagency Support \nTeam (Appendix T). \n \n\n    57 \nIssue guidance on how to document Informal   \nRemovals for partial school days as \nsuspensions that count towards the 10 days \ntriggering an MDR. Mandate the reporting of \nall Informal Removals as suspensions on \nstudents’ disciplinary history in their \neducational record to be reported to ODE as \npart of the annual discipline data collection. \nODE should then review that data annually to \nidentify any districts that are not holding \nMDRs as needed for these suspensions and \nprovide training, support, and corrective \naction if training and support prove \nineffective. \nEstablish and provide to districts clear   \nconsequences, in the form of withholding \nfunding, to LEAs who do not follow ODE \nguidance on SSD and who do report use of \nSSD or accurately report use of SSD. A \nrecommended logical consequence would be \nto reduce the district’s IDEA and state funding \nfor any student who is placed on SSD for \nmore than 30 school days during a calendar \nyear. The funding would be reduced to reflect \nthe actual percentage of time each day the \nstudent is receiving live instruction from a \ncertified teacher. For example, if a student is \nonly allowed to attend school for half a day \nthe funding for that student would be cut in \nhalf and only restored incrementally as the \nstudent is returned to school. If funding has \nalready been paid to a district, the district \nwould be required to return a pro rata share of \nthat funding every 30 days with \ndocumentation of the student’s receipt of live \ninstruction from a certified teacher. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    58 \nRecommendation Five \nDue to the lack of understanding and need for clear guidance from ODE on SB 263, we recommend \nthe following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nIssue guidance on how SB263 requires parent  Revising  SB263  to  include  many  of  the \npermission for a shortened school day.   components  in  the  originally  proposed \nODE needs to provide guidance, so every  legislation  or  provide  guidance to  districts \ndistrict understands its responsibility and  that includes those components.   \nmelds the conflict between consent and \nmeaningful participation. \nIssue  guidance  specifying  if  a  district  is   \nconsidering placing a general education child \non SSD, the child should be put in the referral \nprocess for IDEA. We suggest the language \nfrom the original legislation should be used in \nthe guidance. \nIssue  guidance  on  requiring  the  use  of   \nFBA/BIP and Behavior goals, etc. – the IEP \nmust  address  the  child’s  unmet  needs \nresulting in the use of SSD so the child can \ndevelop  the  skills  to  move  on  the  LRE \ncontinuum to a less restrictive environment. \nWe suggest the guidance the language from \nthe original legislation should be used in the \nguidance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    59 \nRecommendation Six \nDue  to  a  lack  of  training  for  developing  and  implementing  FBAs  and  BIPs,  the  lack  of \nunderstanding of the role of an FBA and BIP for meaningful behavior change, and need for \nbehavior goals prior to placing a child on SSD due to behavior, we recommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nIssue guidance on FBAs and BIPs processes   \nand format including sample documents that \nwould be included in the statewide IEP \nsystem. See Appendix U for additional \nguidance on FBA/BIP development. \nEstablish a system for providing mandatory   \ntraining for special education staff and \nadministrators on FBAs and BIPs and the \nresulting behavioral goals. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRecommendation Seven \nTo prevent the overuse of SSD we recommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nIssue guidance that, for every student placed   \non SSD, 1 hour of 1:1 home instruction needs \nto be provided for every 2 hours of school \ninstruction missed. \n \n\n    60 \nIssue guidance that for every student placed   \non  SSD  for  longer  than  30  days, \ncompensatory education needs to be provided \nbased on a calculation of hours not at school \n= amount of equivalent school days missed. \nIssue guidance that if school districts decide   \nto provide a student instruction though video \n(asynchronous  or  synchronous)  while  they \nare at home on a SSD, no more than 2 hours \na day of instruction may be provided in this \nmanner. \n \n \n \n \n Recommendation Eight \nTo ensure agreements are carried out, we recommend the following: \nPriority  Strongly Consider \nAppoint  a  Special  Master  to  oversee  the   \nimplementation of the final agreement. \nAppoint a panel of advisors to review data and   \nmake recommendations to the special master \nregarding implementation of monitoring efforts \nrelated to SSD. The panel must include at least \none parent. \n!  \n \n\n    61 \nCONCLUSION \n  School personnel across Oregon appear to understand conceptually how and when the use \nof Shortened School Day (SSD) may be appropriate; however, there is a discrepancy between this \nconceptual understanding and the implementation of SSD in the student IEP files and survey data \nwe reviewed.   \n  When asked what other alternatives to SSD were attempted, the districts had few, if any, \nresponses despite the fact that SB 263 mandates at least one other placement be considered. Even \nmore concerning were the examples provided as justification for placing students on SSD. The \ntwo main reasons consistently given were \"stamina” and \"safety.” “Stamina” was explained to be \nthat a student did not have the emotional, psychological, or physical endurance to get through an \nentire school day without exhibiting inappropriate behaviors. \"Safety” ranged from: throwing \nitems, elopement, climbing on furniture, hitting, biting, kicking, to property damage (e.g., tearing \nposters off the wall, turning over desks or chairs). The IEPs of students on SSD that we reviewed \nranged from not having behavior goals, to behavior goals that did not pass \"The Dead Man Test,”7 \nto goals that appropriately addressed the identified behaviors that led to placement on SSD.  \n  Many districts !self-perceptions of their efforts to return students to full day are not \nsupported by the IEP documents provided or data submitted. The original proposed legislation for \nSB263 included mandatory timelines requiring frequent review of SSD placements, particularly \nfor any student on SSD for more than sixty (60) calendar days, to reinforce the presumption of a \nreturn to a full-school day. This language was removed from the final adopted version and ODE \nhas not issued any guidance to clarify the frequency of reviews or expected duration of placement \non SSD resulting in many students across Oregon spending years on SSD and missing years of \ninstruction. This is concerning. It was noted as a part of our research the two following facts: \n1)   Students who miss 10% of kindergarten lag, on average, almost a year behind in \nreading by third grade. \n2)   Students who miss two days of school per month will miss 1.5 years of instruction \nby the end of 12th grade.8 \n \n7 http://teachearlyautism.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-dead-mans-test.html \n8 https://www.readingrockets.org/article/waiting-rarely-works-late-bloomers-usually-just-wilt \n \n\n    62 \n  There are districts, however, that have figured out how to address inappropriate behaviors \nwhile keeping students in school for a full-day. What has become apparent throughout this process \nis the importance of leadership in how these decisions are made. Without any requirements for \nadditional  home  instruction,  placing  students  on  SSD  is  easier  than  dealing  with  difficult \nbehaviors. When the state and district leadership dedicate resources, provide training, and issue \nclear directives, it can be done. Where the district leadership saw SSD as a viable option, the data \nrevealed, and conversations with district staff supported, the inappropriate and extensive use of \nSSD. \n  For example, one superintendent in a district on the I-5 corridor told administrators and \nteachers that no students would be put on SSD in the district and instructed them to \"figure it out.” \nThis initially was met with resistance; however, over time, it has become the new practice in this \ndistrict. The commitment of the superintendent to all students receiving a full-day of instruction \nwas the key to ensuring staff members dug into their professional \"tool box” and found ways to \naddress the inappropriate behavior and teach the students the skills they lacked. \n  Additionally, two special education directors in very rural districts in eastern Oregon \nreported they did not place any students on SSD. They could not think of any examples of students \nthey were unable to serve with appropriate supplemental aids and services. The data provided by \nthese districts is consistent with their statements. \n  There were major inconsistencies across the state with how districts are implementing SSD \nfrom districts that do not place any students on SSD to districts that are clearly implementing as a \nregular practice and view SSD as an acceptable placement option. Many districts have created \nprograms that by design place children on SSD—often for years. These districts place both \nstudents eligible for special education and general education students (without considering the \nstudent#s eligibility under the IDEA) within these programs. Districts that are using SSD also have \nwidely varied \"Step-up Plans,” check-in systems, and expectations for students to return to a full-\nschool day. Most school districts we queried did not provide any additional instruction outside of \nthe student#s SSD to replace the instruction missed while the student was on SSD. In fact, the \nquestion was typically met with incredulity as to why that would be an expectation.  \n  These findings only reinforce the need for ODE to issue clear guidance, provide direct \ntraining and support for LEAs, to serve as a resource for schools and families, and to monitor the \n \n\n    63 \nuse of SSD on a consistent basis. Very few, if any, districts reported seeing ODE as a source of \nguidance or a resource for training and support—in fact, in one ESD, the special education director \nsaid this would be a philosophical shift. Due to the absence of clear guidance from ODE, districts \nrely on trainings and guidance from private law firms—whose clients are the school boards and \nnot the children they serve—and their own institutional knowledge of using SSD as an acceptable \nmethod to address inappropriate behaviors. Given the vacuum of leadership around the use of SSD, \nlack of consistent state training, and absence of monitoring of the use of SSD, districts utilize the \npath of least resistance—placing children with behavior issues on SSD.  \n  There is also a disconnect between ODE#s perspective of the prevalence, significance, and \nprolific use of SSD throughout the state through a variety of institutionalized programs and \npathways. There are students on SSD who are not attending school at all—their SSD includes \ntutoring at home for one (1) hour each day without any access to peers. There are also students \nwho have been on SSD for two or more years and continue to remain on SSD (we were provided \nentire student IEP files that included IEPs up through this past school year 2021-2022). In one \ndistrict alone there were 12 students who had been on SSD for 2, 3 or 4 years. \n  As part of our investigation, we asked ODE to identify exemplary districts, so we could \nsee what they were doing and how it might be emulated in other districts. However, in our \ninterview with one of the districts ODE identified, the district personnel proudly described a \nprogram they created that was specifically designed to serve two groups of students each on a half-\nday schedule (one in the morning and one in the afternoon). The program placed both students \nwith and without IEPs on SSD. The students who were not eligible for special education had not \nbeen referred for testing and had poor monitoring and Step-up Plans. For the students with IEPs, \ndistrict staff reported that placement in this program did not affect their placement on the \ncontinuum and did not need to be reflected on the IEP as attending an SSD program. These students \nwere typically in this program for years. \n  While the pandemic forced school districts to provide instruction remotely, what has \nbecome abundantly clear is the learning loss that children throughout our nation have suffered and \nfrom which they may never recover. This is consistent with the research documenting the impact \nof missing instruction on a child#s ability to learn and master basic academic skills. Perhaps even \nmore profound—as noted by almost every district with whom we spoke—is the regression and \nfailure to develop age-appropriate social skills that directly correlates with the demonstration of \n \n\n    64 \ninappropriate behaviors while at school, many of which impede their own learning and that of their \npeers.  Thus,  the  IEPs  and  district  staff that  referenced  the  use  of  virtual  instruction,  both \nsynchronous and asynchronous, as examples of the only instruction provided to students on SSD \nis  particularly  concerning.  The  lack  of  options  for  students  to  participate  with  peers  and \nopportunities for the students to engage face-to-face with their instructors and learn from the \nmodeling of their non-disabled peers poses significant long-term repercussions for students who \nare already academically, socially, and emotionally struggling.  \n  As ODE noted in its response to the SOS Systemic Risk Report Talking Points from May \n2022, action is required by the legislature to add authority to the Oregon Department of Education \nto address when local school districts and school boards are not in compliance with Oregon \nAdministrative rules. We believe the guidance passed by the state board on June 16, 2022 is a good \nstart (see Appendix Y). It would also require the Legislature to fund positions to monitor school \ndistrict compliance.  \n  Another  concerning  point  is  that  many  school  districts  are  not  counting  Informal \nSuspensions or Informal Removals of students with disabilities as part of the 10-days that would \ntrigger the need for an MDR. ODE must provide guidance and training to ensure districts \nunderstand and appropriately document as suspensions: \n● When a child is removed from the classroom due to behavior and sits in the principal#s office \nor other location away from their class and peers and direct instruction for greater than 60 \nminutes; and \n● any time a parent is called to pick up a child early from school due to behavior. \n \n  Finally, ODE is the entity that receives the funding from the federal government to serve \nstudents  eligible under  IDEA  for  special  education  service  and  therefore has  the  fiduciary \nresponsibility to ensure the districts to which they provide funding: \n1) provide students FAPE in the LRE; \n2) follow a linear progression across the continuum when restricting students!#access to non-\ndisabled peers; \n3) do not deny students the opportunity to participate in a full-school day with peers for \nextended periods of time;  \n \n\n    65 \n4) have the personnel and training resources they need to appropriately address students!#\nbehaviors; \n5) have the training they need to develop appropriate FBAs, BIPs, and behavior goals; and \n6) have the coaching they need to implement the BIPs along with collecting appropriate data \nand analyzing and using the data to ensure the student#s behavior improves.  \n \nStudents eligible for special education and related services have a presumptive right to \nattend the same amount of time as typically developing students. Shortened School Days should \nbe seen and used as a temporary and emergency tool to help a student acquire the skills they need \nto attend a full-day and to help school staff and administrators receive training, secure additional \nsupports, and make changes that are needed for the student to return to a full day within 30 school \ndays. SSD should never be seen as a placement option on the LRE continuum and should not be \nused on a consistent basis with one student or many students within a school district.  \nThe state has a difficult task ahead to ensure that SSD is sparingly used; however, we are \nconfident that with a firm commitment from ODE leadership to eradicate the improper use of SSD \nit can be done.   \n   \n \n\n    66 \nAppendices \n \nI.

While there are students who receive a shortened school day as a result \nof medical needs or outside of the school therapy needs, the focus of our work was to investigate \nand to make recommendations only for those placed on shortened or abbreviated school days as a \nresult of disability related behaviors. Oregon placed a greater emphasis on this practice when the \nlegislature passed, and the governor signed, SB 263 in 2017 and provided specific guidelines \nrelated to the educational needs of students as it relates to shortened or abbreviated school days. \n  To meet our charge, the team met with focus groups from the Oregon Department of \nEducation (ODE), school district staff, families, and other experts in the field in Oregon. The team \nplanned to gather and analyze data regarding the use of shortened or abbreviated school day \nmodeled on the survey of the Oregon school districts sent out in April of 2021, which our team \nexpanded and sought to clarify the scope of the data.  \nBelow is a description of the specific tasks the Neutral Experts were assigned and what \nwas done to complete those tasks.   \n \nTask One \na. Determine the sources of information from which to gather evidence regarding use of Shortened \nSchool Days for the Target Population. These sources of information could include (but would \nnot be limited to): \ni.  Records and data in ODE’s possession relevant to Shortened School Day placements for the \nTarget Population;  \n \n\n    72 \nODE had the results from the April 2021 survey that had responses from 56% of the \ndistricts in Oregon. We were not provided, nor did we find any other records in the \npossession of ODE specifically related to the monitoring or prevalence of the use of \nSSD in Oregon schools.  \n \nTask Two \nii. State and district statutes, policies, guidelines, processes, and procedures relevant to \nShortened School Day placements for the Target Population;  \n \nBased on our research, which includes discussing this topic with many directors of \nspecial education and district superintendents, we were unable to locate actual Board \npolicies on SSD despite districts having notice and acknowledgement forms and \nprocesses to follow when placing students on SSD. The only state statute found was \nSB263. In addition, we found no formal guidance or mandated training provided by \nODE.  We  identified  some  trainings  provided  by  ODE  at  the  COSA  Conference \n(Coalition of School Administrators), but these trainings were merely an option for \nattendees. We also identified other trainings that were offered to individual districts \nand ESDs based on request.  \n \nTask Three \nStudent-level state and district data relevant to Shortened School Day placements for the \nTarget Population. \n \n\n    73 \nWe developed a survey for districts to provide these data. We received responses to the \nsurvey from 185 districts (93% of school districts in Oregon), representing 92% of all \nstudents eligible for special education and related services for each of the target years. \nFor more information on the survey results and how this survey compares to the results \nof the April 2021 survey, please see the survey spreadsheet and go to the analysis \nsection of this document. We were also provided copies of IEPs and FBAs for students \nplaced on SSD. However, many of the documents districts provided were redacted to \nsuch an extent that it was very difficult to ascertain data on the prevalence of students \nwho were on a shortened school day over multiple years. However, the districts that \nsubmitted  documentation  redacting  only  the  requisite  personally  identifiable \ninformation,  as  requested,  allowed  us  to  see  there  are  students  who  are  part  of \nestablished SSD programs (i.e., students in these programs attend school for 2 or 3 \nhours a day) over multiple years that use a shortened school day as well as others whose \nIndividual Education Programs (IEPs) reflected they had been placed on shortened \nschool days for multiple years.   \n \nTask Four  \nInterviews regarding Shortened School Day placements for the Target Population with \nindividuals and/or focused groups of state and district staff, students, parents, guardians, \nvarious advisory committees, parent organizations, subject-matter experts, and counsel for \nthe parties. \n \n\n    74 \n1.  We attempted to contact all the individuals provided by both the Plaintiffs and the \nDefendants. Many did not respond, but the Neutral Experts interviewed all who did \nrespond. \n2.  We met with a variety of ODE personnel multiple times.  \n3.  We met with complaint investigators. \n4.  We met with many parents who had a child who was placed on a shortened school day. \nThe parents we interviewed also included parents who had moved out of the state in \norder to seek an appropriate education for their children.  \n5.  We spoke with 24 school districts across the state. See the list in Appendix S. As a part \nof  these  meetings  we  met  with  building-level  school  administrators,  teachers, \nbehavior  specialists,  Directors  of  Special  Education,  ESD  administrators,  and \nattorneys representing school districts.  \n6.   We also talked with students impacted by SSD. \n \nTask Five  \nTargeted site visits to review individual student files and make classroom observations for \ninformation related to Shortened School Day placements for the Target Population.  \n \nInitially  we  set  up  a  schedule  which  included  four  physical  visits  to  Oregon \n(January/March/April/May 2022), each to a specific geographic area of Oregon that \nwould allow us to visit a selected number of rural, suburban and urban school districts \nover 4-5 days. The goal of each visit was to meet with general education teachers, \nspecial education teachers, principals, directors of special education, superintendents \n \n\n    75 \nand parents, as well as review IEP documents and other SSD documents used with \nstudents with disabilities who had been placed on shortened school day due to behavior \nchallenges.  Unfortunately,  in  January,  when  beginning  work  on  this  project,  the \nOmicron variant of COVID-19 started to dramatically impact school districts and \nfamilies. We delayed our first visit as a result. However, there were other mitigating \nfactors preventing our visit to schools. Please see the section of this document regarding \nBarriers. In April, we were finally able to visit an ESD to talk with special education \ndirectors, and in May we visited three different school districts meeting with a variety \nof staff and touring and observing a wide range of classrooms. We also attended the \nJune 2022 COSA conference and spoke with a number of special education directors \nthere. \n \nTask Six  \nGather information from the sources identified in (a) or otherwise determined relevant by \nthe Neutral Expert through data collection, document review, and interviews needed to \nunderstand the data. The time period for the data collection shall be from the 2016-2017, \n2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years, except to the extent the Neutral Expert \ndetermines that obtaining data from earlier school years is appropriate. The information \ngathering shall be completed within three (3) months after retention of the Neutral Expert; \nsuch time period may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties \ncannot agree, pursuant to an extension granted by Judge Acosta.  \nWe created a survey and, with the help of ODE, we distributed it to districts within the \nthree months allotted; however, the response rate was low. It quickly became apparent \n \n\n    76 \nthat many districts would not respond without a subpoena, and Defendant’s counsel \nassisted in drafting and serving the subpoenas. Although it took a great deal of time to \nget the subpoenas out and multiple follow-ups with a number of schools to get them to \nrespond, we ended up with responses from 93% of public schools in Oregon. We \naccepted data from districts through June 21, 2022. Please see the extensive spreadsheet \ndeveloped as a result of that survey, and the resulting analysis of the data in that section \nof the report.  \n \nTask Seven \nIdentify the conditions under which Shortened School Days are used due to disability-\nrelated behavior (i.e., where, when, why, how long) for the Target Population. Plaintiffs \nand ODE will each supply the Neutral Expert with a checklist of essential data elements to \nbe gathered in connection with uses of Shortened School Days to assist the parties in \ndetermining the appropriateness of the uses of Shortened School Days. The checklists may \nbe modified by the Neutral Expert as appropriate after consulting with the parties. \nWe received a checklist of information the Plaintiffs desired that we gather. Initially, \nto save time collecting presumably the same data collected previously, we sought to \nuse the April 2021 survey; however, as noted in other parts of this document, we found \nmany deficiencies with the data, and there were also multiple inconsistencies with the \ninformation provided by the districts in response to the April 2021 survey. Therefore, \nwe developed a new survey that went out to all school districts in Oregon to gather \nresponsive information to many components of this task. With the assistance of ODE, \nwe distributed the survey and collected data from individual districts (where) for the \n \n\n    77 \n2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20 school years (when), and only collected data \nrelated to SSD due to behaviors (why).  \n  We only have documentary evidence of “how long” students were placed on SSD \nfrom a handful of districts, as districts were very reluctant to provide, and often advised \nby their attorneys to make available significantly redacted documents to the extent we \nwere unable to ascertain this information. However, the documentary evidence we did \nsecure was supported by the anecdotal evidence gathered by talking to school, district, \nESD, and ODE’s contracted complaint investigators–the students are placed on SSD \nfor extended periods of time, often for years.  \n \nTask Eight \nIdentify and examine the root cause(s) at the state and/or district level of the use of \nShortened School Days due to disability-related behaviors for the Target Population. \n   Due to the extensive amount of quantitative and qualitative information gathered \nregarding the root causes, please see the information detailed in the section of the report \ntitled Findings, with follow-up discussion in the Recommendations and Conclusion \nsections. Additionally, we would ask school districts what would happen if the parents \nwere not going to be home when the student was placed on a shortened school day. \nOne district stated that they would not place the student on a shortened school day if \nthey knew the child was going to be in an empty home. However, most school districts \nsaid that the parents would figure it out somehow and that it was not a concern. In \ntalking with the parents, there were multiple stories of parents who had to either quit \ntheir jobs (for example, a teacher who was also a parent of a child with a disability had \n \n\n    78 \nto quit their job because someone had to be home with the student starting at 930 every \nmorning), or one of the parents would have to work the night shift so he could be at \nhome with his child while his wife worked during the day.    \n  There were multiple stories of parents stating in IEP meeting where shortened \nschool day was being discussed that they did not want their child on a shortened school \nday and would like their child to be educated for a full-day like their peers. The IEP \nteam would still make the recommendations for a shortened school day and without the \nparents’ consent, place the student on a shortened school day. \n  Another theme across the state, with the rural areas appearing to be more heavily \nimpacted was the lack of staffing and mental health and behavioral supports. One \nadministrator shared that his ESD had shortened the day of one of their programs \nbecause they were not able to find staff to allow a full day. When asked what resources \nwere needed to be able to decrease the number of students on SSD the majority of the \ndistricts reported more staff and access to behavioral and mental health services.    \n \nTask Nine \nSynthesize information collected above and describe the magnitude and scope of the use of \nShortened School Days for the Target Population, including: (i) the number of students in the \nTarget Population placed on Shortened School Days due to disability-related behaviors; (ii) \nthe length of time that those students are placed on Shortened School Days; (iii) whether the \nstudents’ placements on Shortened School Days were revisited after any specified period and, \nif so, what time period; (iv) differences in utilization of Shortened School Days for the \nmembers of the Target Population based on district type or student demographics; and (v) \n \n\n    79 \ndescriptive statistics and information related to the time and location of services received by \nstudents in the Target Population. \nPlease  see  the  attached  spreadsheet  for  more  information  on  this  specific  area. \nAdditionally, please see the narrative accompanying the spreadsheet. We looked at all the \nIEPs provided to us that are legible. Many are redacted to such an extent it is impossible to \nfigure out the child’s disability, their grade, or the services that are provided to them (see \nfor example the IEP in Appendix X). Due to the absence of any statewide IEP system or \nsystematic mechanism for ODE to pull the requested data, we were forced to rely on data \ngathered independently and reported to us by the districts without any guarantees of fidelity \nin the process they employed. \n \nTask Ten \nIdentify uses of Shortened School Days for the Target Population that potentially fail to meet the \nrequirements of federal law—namely, the IDEA, the ADA, and/or Section 504—and also \nidentify where districts are implementing positive practices with respect to serving the Target \nPopulation and/or reducing inappropriate uses of Shortened School Days. Nothing in this section \nallows the Neutral Expert to inquire into any potential violations of the IDEA, the ADA and/or \nSection 504 unrelated to the use of Shortened School Days for the Target Population. \n \nThe IDEA requires the district to demonstrate a child is not able to be educated with non-\ndisabled peers with appropriate supplemental aids and services. We discovered and our \nqualitative data confirmed, districts are placing students on Shortened School Day without \never  attempting,  much  less  demonstrating,  a  child  cannot  access  a  full-day  without \n \n\n    80 \nsupplemental aids and services. There are also districts predetermining placement on \nShortened School Day for students prior to their enrollment and also prior to conducting \nan FBA, developing a BIP, or adding behavior goals to the IEP. One step beyond this is \nthat many districts have established space and staff to implement SSD programs into which \nstudents are placed and only allowed to attend school in that program for their education, \ni.e., 2 or 3 hours a day. Students placed in these programs appear to not be seen as placed \nin on a shortened day, because it is an established program. For example, one program in \na  district  has  a  teacher  and  several  paraprofessionals  that  work  a  full-day  for  the \n[intentionally left blank] Program. The students who attend the program are split into two \ngroups; half attend 8:30am-11:30am and half attend 12:00pm-3:00pm.  \n  Additionally,  as  implemented,  students  with  disabilities  are  being  placed  on \nShortened School Day without parental consent as SB 263’s conflicting language implies \nthat parents of SWD must only have the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the \ndecision, rather than consent to placement on Shortened School Day. This is contrary to \nthe prohibition on “unilateral placement” by a school district in SB 263 which states that \nplacing a child on SSD cannot happen “without parent consent”. \n \nTask Eleven \nPrepare a report describing the Neutral Expert’s sources used and findings relative to (a)-(f) \nabove and, if any, advisory recommendations for Phase II to address the existence of Shortened \nSchool Days that potentially fail to meet the requirements of federal law. To the extent the \nNeutral Expert determines sharing a draft report with the parties for comment is appropriate, the \nNeutral Expert may do so prior to releasing the report. The report shall be completed within six \n \n\n    81 \n(6) months after retention of the Neutral Expert; such time period may be extended by mutual \nagreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, pursuant to an extension granted by Judge \nAcosta. The report shall be admissible as evidence in any court of law. The report shall not be \nconsidered confidential; to the extent any details of the report are required to remain confidential \nunder federal law, including IDEA and FERPA, to protect the privacy of individually identifiable \nstudents, the parties will prepare a version of the report that redacts only those details and that \ncan be available to the public. \nThe report may include, if appropriate, recommendations for the creation of new programs, \nhiring of new staff, contracting for services, developing new training systems, redirection of \nexisting resources, or any other possible remedies, including recommending changes to state \npolicies, statutes, or rules. The report may also include, if appropriate, recommendations for \nusing existing programs, facilities, and staff to the extent those existing resources are adequate. \nThe report may also recommend making no changes. Within the report, the Neutral Expert shall \ninclude their rationale to support each recommendation. \n  Please see the Recommendations section of this report. \n \nQuantitative Data \nFrom the April 2021 survey, the ODE obtained this information from approximately 110 \nOregon school districts. As a part of the survey, the ODE sought information regarding how many \nOregon public school students with disabilities experienced SSD as a part of their Individualized \nEducation Program (“IEP”) over the 2016–2017, 2017–2018, 2018– 2019, and 2019–2020 school \nyears. These survey results reflect about half of the state’s school districts. \n  The data gathered in the April 2021 survey included: \n \n\n    82 \n• number of students on shortened school day (SSD), including students with disabilities \nand without disabilities, and students who were not clearly identified as having disabilities \nor not; \n• number of students on SSD whose parents or guardians were notified the student would \nreceive an SSD; \n• number of students on SSD whose parents had signed Abbreviated Day Notice and \nAcknowledgement forms; \n• number of students with disabilities for whom SSD is identified in their IEPs; and \n• number of students on SSD with a re-entry plan (a plan to transition out of placement on \nSSD). \n  Our team spent a considerable amount of time reviewing the data gathered in April of 2021. \nIn an effort to be more efficient with school districts and our time, we originally intended to use \nthat information as a foundation for our next steps, determining what additional data needed to be \ngathered and to include in the final report. Upon close review the team found, the information was \nincomplete and, at times, unclear. The data was not uniform in format, and school districts varied \nsignificantly as to how they produced the data, which made it difficult to make interpretations \nbased on the data. For example, one district reported more students on shortened school day than \nthe number of students that were eligible for special education and related services. This in \nconjunction with the fact that many districts that did not report any data left us with more questions \nabout the reliability of the data than our initial presumptions. More accurate information was \nrequired. \n  The  results  of  the  April  2021  survey  also  indicated  the  districts  varied  in  their \ndocumentation of notices about SSD sent to parents; signed parent/guardian acknowledgements \nthat their child would receive a SSD; the IEPs for children who had SSD identified in their IEPs; \nand/or summary graphs listing SSD recipients. The plaintiffs in their summary statement of the \nApril 2021 survey extrapolated from the districts that reported the number of students on SSD to \ncompare with the districts that did not report. We have chosen not to do that. We take this route \nbecause even though we do not have the data from every school district across Oregon, we have \ndata from 93% of the districts and this number represents approximately 92%% of the students \neligible for special education and related services.    \n \n\n    83 \n  There were four major questions gleaned from the data provided as a part of the April 2021 \nsurvey:  1)  There  was  inconsistent  documentation  of  how  districts  reported  signed  notices, \ninformation about how parents were involved; 2) The data did not include information from many \nof the school districts. This raised the questions, did the districts who were non-responders have \nno eligible students who were placed on a shortened school day? 3) There were inconsistencies for \nmost of the school districts in their data indicating they may not have understood the purpose of \nthe survey (i.e., to identify IDEA eligible students who were placed on a shortened school day as \na result of the student’s disability related behavior, and not due to a medical issue or doctor’s note).  \n4) Was it clear to the districts what constituted an abbreviated or shortened school day? For \nexample, were parent-initiated requests counted by the districts in their responses? \nNeed for a New Survey \n  The April 2021 survey sought to gather information related to the number of students \nplaced  on  a  shortened  school  day.  However,  the  data  inconsistencies  prevented  a  reliable \ninterpretation of the data. Therefore, we prioritized creating and distributing a new survey to the \nschool districts regarding the use of shortened school days for IDEA eligible children. We realized \nthe districts spent time on this survey in April 2021, and we were cognizant of the challenges \nfacing districts in the 2021-2022 school year with staffing and COVID-19 related issues. While \nwe did not want to place an additional burden on the districts, the data already gathered did not \nprovide the answers needed.   \n  Therefore, we sought to develop a survey that was clear in the intent of what was necessary, \nprovided more clear definitions of behavior, target population, shortened school day, and transition \nplans, did not allow for partial responses, provided a tool to facilitate data gathering, and provided \na point of contact on our team to quickly respond to questions or problems. Further, we worked \nwith special education directors in another state to field-test the questions in an effort to mitigate \nas many misinterpretations and other issues prior to sending out the new survey. Following the \nfield testing, we made changes to the format and explanation sheet.  \nThe survey this team developed sought to clarify and focus the data to target only students \nwith IDEA disabilities who were on SSD due to disability related behaviors as well as gathered \ndata on the student’s participation in the least restrictive environment. The questions sought the \nfollowing information:  \n \n\n    84 \n1.  The number of students with IDEA eligible disabilities on SSD due to disability \nrelated behavior. \n2.  The age range of the students identified above on SSD. \n3.  The primary disabilities of the students identified above on SSD. \n4.  Was the SSD included on the IEP? \n5.  Did the parents sign the form required by SB 263? \n6.  Was a plan in place to transition the students back to full day in place?   \nIn addition to the survey, a cover letter explaining the survey, we provided an email address for \nadditional questions. \n  Dr. Eric Wells of ODE assisted with the use of a tool to send out and gather the survey \ndata. ODE continued to support this work by sending the survey with a cover letter to contact \nmembers  of  our  team  with  questions  about  the  survey,  process,  and  other  items  needing \nclarification. The survey went out in February 2022 and the districts were provided three weeks to \ncomplete the survey. \n  Our team received feedback from one school board attorney and multiple districts after the \nletter and survey was sent out. The districts specifically expressed that gathering the data requested \nwas burdensome and onerous. The school board attorney further expressed concerns regarding \nlack of clarity on specific items and informed the Neutral Expert that the districts represented \nwould not complete the survey without a subpoena. The team reviewed and considered all the \nconcerns that were expressed. Something more was necessary. \n  As a result of the statement clarifying the lack of ability to voluntarily comply with the \nrequest, the team sought and obtained a subpoena for the districts to comply with the production \nof information for the survey. At that time, approximately 85 districts had responded to the original \nsurvey request. A subpoena was issued in the latter part of March 2022. The team again worked \nwith Dr. Eric Wells to resend the survey and notifying the districts that subpoenas had been \nprovided seeking compliance with answering the survey.  \n  We also had districts, under the advice of counsel, that would not answer the survey even \nwith a subpoena–stating they did not have to produce information that was not already available. \nA number of these districts, however, were provided a subpoena seeking documents relevant to \nthe issue of shortened school day within their district. These documents included IEPs, signed \n \n\n    85 \nnotices from parents, and behavior plans. Many of the districts provided these documents but \nredacted the documents in such a manner so as to render them almost useless.  \n  However, we were able to use these documents, even the ones heavily redacted, to \ndetermine the grade, disability category, years of service, and whether the parents had signed the \nnotices regarding shortened school day. We then analyzed every one of the documents and were \nable to use the information provided to answer the survey questions and assist in our making a \ndetermination about the extent of students across the state who are placed on a shortened school \nday. \n   \nQualitative Indicators \n  The above discusses the quantitative part of our assignment, determining the prevalence of \nplacing students with disabilities on shortened school day as a result of behaviors in the state of \nOregon. However, as the parties recognized in developing our charge, simply providing the \nnumbers of students across the state placed on SSD does not provide for a real understanding of \nthe needs of parents, teachers, administrators, and others across the state who are faced with \ndealing with this issue on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, we sought to interview administrators, \nteachers, behavior specialists, school psychologists, educational service districts (ESD), as well as \nparents from across the state to hear their comments related to this issue. We developed a list of \nquestions we posed to each group, with the option for expanding the scope of the questions based \non the responses. \nThe questions that we used to gather information as a part of the interviews were developed \nindependent of both parties. The focus of the questions related to the process of how a child is \nplaced on a shortened school day, behaviors the student demonstrated, how frequently they are \nmonitored, the role of the IEP teams in the decision making process, the role of the IEP in the \ndecision making process, the use of FBAs/BIPs, the development of a plan for bringing the student \nback into school for a full-day of education, the specific strategies and skills that are to be taught \nto the student to facilitate their coming back to school, and what services the student received from \nthe school after they were sent home early. There were also additional questions related to whether \nthe IEP team would still recommend a shortened school day if there was no parent at home to \nsupervise, what would happen if the parent disagrees with the school’s recommendation, and how \n \n\n    86 \nthe days were counted (i.e., as suspensions, excused/unexcused absences) if an administrator called \na parent to come pick up their child during the course of the school day independent of an IEP \nteam decision. We also asked overarching questions related to the guidance and support that was \nprovided by ODE on this topic, and sought feedback on, and examples of, any desires for guidance \nand support from ODE. \nWe tailored our questions to the specific roles and responsibilities of the individuals we \nwere addressing. We did ask all the district employees we interviewed, what guidance or support \nthey seek from ODE. The classroom teachers, who were all very forthcoming, all deferred that \nquestion to their supervisors as they felt it was their supervisors/administrators role to address or \nseek  guidance  from  ODE,  and  their  job  was  to  follow  the  directives  of  their \nsupervisors/administrators. We also made sure to ask all district personnel, what do they wish we \nknew about shortened school days, and what do they want from ODE. These, as noted above, \nformed the basis for many recommendations for the report.  \n  We also sought input from ODE staff, education service directors, complaint investigators, \nand subject matter experts. Consistently, all those we interviewed across the state provided \nthoughtful input that helped inform our recommendations in this report.  \n  One item that was overarching as a part of the discussions was the need for guidance from \nODE about the requirements of SB 263, the need for data reporting, and the need for supports and \nresources when there is a student with intense behavioral needs. For further information on this \ntopic, please see the recommendations section of this document. Our team's first focus groups were \nwith the ODE staff as other focus groups were being scheduled. Based on the survey results from \nApril 2021 and comments from the focus groups with the ODE staff and input from the plaintiffs, \nthe team identified 20 school districts across the state where we desired to interact face-to-face \nwith school personnel and conduct observations of programs and individual classrooms, when \npossible. We planned multiple weeks where we, as a team, could interview individuals from \ndifferent school districts. We were not prepared for the barriers placed in our path to accomplishing \nthis goal.. \n  Despite clarifying multiple times that the work we sought to accomplish related to the \nlawsuit against ODE, and that school districts were not being targeted for future lawsuits, the \nresponse rate was not very good. We relied on the ODE/DOJ to initially contact the school districts \n \n\n    87 \nto let them know we would like to meet with them, talk with teachers, and review individual \neducation programs (IEP) and behavior intervention plans (BIP), and transition plans. \n   \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n\n    88 \nAppendix C: \n \nSpreadsheet with Data \n!  \n \n\n    89 \nAppendix D: \n \nTerminology \n  We used the definitions provided as a part of the interim agreement, and are \ncopied below for reference.  \nFor the purposes of this Interim Agreement, the following definitions apply: \na. \"ADA” - Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 \net seq., and its implementing regulations. \nb. \"Effective Date” - the date on which this Interim Agreement has been fully \nexecuted by all parties. \nc. \"IDEA” - the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 \net seq., and its implementing regulations. \nd. \"FAPE” - a free appropriate public education within the meaning of the \nIDEA. \ne. \"FERPA” - the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, and its \nimplementing regulations. \nf. \"LEA” - local education agencies which provide educational services directly to \nstudents. \ng. \"LRE” - least restrictive environment. \nh. \"Section 504” - Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and its \nimplementing regulations. \ni. \"Shortened School Day”- refers to any school day during which a student within the \nTarget Population receives instruction or educational services in school for fewer hours \nthan other students who are in the same grade within the same school. \n \n\n    90 \nj. \"Target Population”- refers to the certified class for the lawsuit (i.e., \"all students with \ndisabilities aged 3 to 21 residing in Oregon who are eligible for special education and \nrelated services under the IDEA and are currently being subjected to a shortened school \nday or are at substantial risk of being subjected to a shortened school day due to their \ndisability-related behavior”).!  \n \n\n    91 \nAppendix E \nIDEA State Education Agency Part B Responsibility \nFEDERAL GUIDANCE \nA.

There \nare eight components related to general supervision:  \nI.  State Performance Plan;  \nII. Policies, Procedures, and Effective Implementation;  \nIII. Integrated Monitoring Activities;  \nIV. Fiscal Management;  \n \n\n    97 \nV. Data on Processes and Results;  \nVI. Improvement, Correction, Incentives and Sanctions;  \nVII.  Effective Dispute Resolution; and  \nVIII.  Targeted Technical Assistance and Professional Development. \n  !  \n \n\n    98 \nAppendix G \nState Performance Plan \n  The IDEA Part B, Sections 611 and 619 formula grant programs assist states in providing \na free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment (LRE) for students \nwith disabilities ages 3 through 21. In accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct (IDEA), Part B, Oregon is required to have in place a performance plan evaluating the state's \nimplementation of Part B and describing how the state will improve such implementation. This \nplan is called the Part B State Performance Plan (SPP) and is required to be posted on the state's \nwebsite. For the SSP the state sets specific targets to meet on the 17 indicators. It is important to \nnote  that  Indicator  17  is  the  State  Systemic  Improvement  Plan  (SSIP).  The  SSIP  is  a \ncomprehensive multi-year plan developed to improve the results of children with disabilities while \ndriving innovation and evidence-based practices. The targets in the SSIP are developed by each \nindividual state. The other 16 indicators are determined by OSEP. For students on SSD, indicators \nB5 and B6 are important. These two indicators look at Least Restrictive Environment, how much \ntime a student spends in the general education classroom. The state reports annually to the Office \nof Special Education Programs (OSEP) on its performance according to its SPP targets. This report \nis called the Part B Annual Performance Report (APR).  Oregon must also use  the targets \nestablished in the State Performance Plan (SPP) under 34 CFR § 300.601 and the priority areas \ndescribed in 34 CFR § 300.600(d) to analyze the performance of each LEA. The IDEA Part B, \nrequires Oregon to report annually, to the public, on the performance of each of its local \neducational agencies (LEA) according to the targets set in its SPP.  \n \nPolicies, Procedures, and Effective Implementation \n  Oregon is required to have policies and procedures that are aligned with the IDEA 34 \nCFR § 300.100. Oregon’s special education policies and procedures support state and local \nimplementation of the IDEA. Agencies responsible for special education and related services \nmust abide by Oregon State law, policies, procedures, and the federal regulations for the IDEA \nPart B and C. Agencies having these responsibilities are: local educational agencies (LEA), \n \n\n    99 \neducational service districts (ESD), public charter schools, accredited private schools, and \nfacilities as described in the applicable federal regulations and established by Oregon state laws. \n \n!  \n \n\n    100 \nAppendix H \n \nState Advisory Council for Special Education (SACSE) \n  The IDEA requires each state to develop and maintain an advisory panel to provide policy \nguidance for children with disabilities (34 CFR §300.167). In Oregon this panel is referred to as \nState Advisory Council for Special Education (SACSE).   \n  The IDEA Part B State Advisory Panel must include the following stakeholders: parents \nof students with disabilities; individuals with disabilities; state and local education officials; state \nand local agency representatives; general and special education school administrators and teachers; \nadvocacy groups; representatives of institutions of higher education that prepare special education \nand  related  services  personnel;  representatives  of  private  schools  and  charter  schools; \nrepresentatives  of  vocational,  community,  and  business  organizations  concerned  with  the \nprovision of transition services to youth with disabilities; and representatives of state juvenile and \ncorrections agencies (34 CFR §300.168). The IDEA B State Advisory Panel participates in the \nannual review and revision of the State Performance Plan (SPP) and Annual Performance Report \n(APR). This includes participation in the development of state targets, the review of data of \nimprovement activities, and making suggestions for updates to the activities and targets. \nIntegrated Monitoring Activities \n  In accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the ODE \nmust employ general supervision activities that include monitoring of local educational agencies \n(LEAs) with a particular emphasis on improving educational results and functional outcomes for \nall students with disabilities while ensuring that LEAs meet the requirements of the IDEA Part B. \nODE implements procedures for monitoring activities in accordance with the IDEA Part B, \nfederal regulation 34 CFR § 300.600. \nTiered Compliance Review \nODE will monitor every LEA in the state each year using the data available for each of the \ncompliance indicators identified in the State Performance Plan (SPP). For each LEA, data \n \n\n    101 \nsubmitted are compared to the targets for each compliance indicator identified in the SPP The \nfocus is the question- Does the LEA implement IDEA with fidelity? \n \nFiscal Management \nIDEA funds are provided for the excess cost of special education and related services for \nstudents with disabilities. IDEA funds are intended to supplement and not supplant state, local or \nother federal funds. \nFunds are awarded to ODE by the United States Department of Education (USDE), Office of \nSpecial Education Programs (OSEP), to \"flow-through\" to the LEA contingent upon an LEA's \napplication for Part B funds. \nFlow-through funds are awarded on a formula based on the number of students with disabilities \naged three through 21 served on December 1st, 1999, as well as the total student enrollment in \nthe LEA (in both public and private schools located in the LEA) and the poverty level of the \nLEA (defined as the free and reduced lunch count within the LEA) as provided by the OSEP. \nODE must ensure fiscal accountability at each phase in the distribution and use of the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B funds. \n \nData on Processes and Results \nAs a part of a state’s general supervision responsibilities, data are used for decision making about \nprogram management and improvement. This process includes: \n(1) Data collection and verification, (2) Data examination and analysis, (3) Public reporting of \ndata, (4) Status determination, and (5) Improvement activities. \n(1) Data Collection and Verification - IDEA requires that data are collected from LEAs through \na state- reported data collection system and reported in the Annual Performance Report (APR). \nTo effectively use these data, LEAs must regularly update the data, and the state must routinely \nexamine the collected data. The state uses the data, as well as information from other sources; \n \n\n    102 \nsuch as other state-collected data, patterns and trends in dispute resolution data and previous \nfindings, to evaluate the performance of the state and the LEAs on the State Performance Plan \n(SPP) indicators. These data are also useful in identifying the LEAs in need of monitoring, \nespecially when these data can be compared across SPP/APR indicators. \nIt is important for ODE to ensure that the data collected from the LEAs are accurate, as well as \nsubmitted in a timely manner. Accuracy has multiple levels, including that the data follow rules \nof entry or submission an reflect actual practice.  \n \nImprovement, Correction, Incentives, and Sanctions Improvement and Corrections \nIf ODE issues a finding of noncompliance for an LEA then the LEA must correct the \nnoncompliance, as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the date of notification. The \nLEA must identify the root cause of the area(s) of noncompliance and may be required to \ndevelop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) or an Improvement Plan based on their compliance \nreview determination. \nImprovement Plan \nLEAs with identified areas of noncompliance may be required to develop a written plan \naddressing the areas of noncompliance and include improvement strategies to ensure correction. \nThis Improvement Plan shall include methods of internal monitoring, safeguards, the person(s) \nresponsible for the implementation, and the date of implementation. Improvement Plan templates \nwill be provided by ODE. ODE will assist LEAs in the development of the improvement plan \nand timelines for completion.  \nCorrective Action Plan (CAP) \nCorrective Action Plans are developed in collaboration with ODE and will require the LEA to \ntake action specific to a particular area of non-compliance. \n \nEffective Dispute Resolution \n \n\n    103 \n  Several mechanisms are available through ODE to assist in resolving disputes. The \nprocesses are individualized education program (IEP) facilitation, mediation, formal complaints, \ndue process hearings, facilitated resolution sessions, and expedited due process hearings. \nTargeted Technical Assistance/Professional Development \n  Targeted Technical Assistance and Professional Development are ongoing activities and \nare a major part of the ODE general supervision system. Technical Assistance is designed to link \ndirectly to indicators in the State Performance Plan/Annual Performance Report (SPP/APR) and \nto improve the level of compliance in Oregon LEAs. The State’s comprehensive approach to \ntechnical assistance enables the Department to differentiate the scope of services provided for \nLEAs based on local needs. Technical Assistance provides a framework for LEAs to build their \ngeneral supervision. \n \n \n \n \n \n!  \n \n\n    104 \nAppendix I \n \nBackground of Need \n  ODE is very specific about the number of hours of education a student is expected \nto receive during an academic year. The focus of this report is the students who are not \nreceiving the hours of education due to their behaviors.  \nOregon Department of Education \nChapter 581 \nDivision 22 \nSTANDARDS FOR PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS \n581-022-2320 \nRequired Instructional Time \n(1)(a) Except as allowed under subsections (2) and (4), each school district shall ensure \nthat at least 92% of all students in the district and at least 80% of all students at each \nschool operated by the district are scheduled to receive annually the following minimum \nhours of instructional time: \n(A) Grade 12 — 966 hours; \n(B) Grades 9–11 — 990 hours; and \n(C) Grades K–8 — 900 hours. \n(b) A student who is 18 years of age or older or an emancipated minor or the person in \nparental relationship to a minor student may request to annually receive the minimum \nhours of instructional time. The school district must honor the request except as \nspecifically provided for by rule or law. \n \n\n    105 \n(2)(a) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (1), with the annual approval of \nthe local school board after a public hearing, the following students are exempted from \nthe instructional time requirement and are not included in the district#s calculation of \ninstructional time under subsection (1): \n(A) Students who have fulfilled all state requirements for graduation under OAR 581-\n022-2000; \n(B) Students who at the start of their senior year are on track to exceed all state \nrequirements for graduation under OAR 581-022-2000 as determined by the number and \ntype of credits earned by the student; and \n(C) Students who are earning credits toward a diploma through accelerated learning \nclasses, such as Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or classes at a post-\nsecondary institution, internship, work-based learning, or credits by proficiency. \n(b) Each year, the school district must report to the local school board the total number of \nstudents disaggregated by relevant sociodemographic group that have been exempted \nfrom the instructional time requirements under this subsection. \n(3) Nothing in this rule may be construed to affect the right of a person to be admitted to \nthe school district in which they reside under ORS 339.115. \n(4) A school district may request permission to exempt an alternative education program \nas defined in ORS 336.615 from the requirement in subsection (1). The request must be \nmade in writing to the Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Deputy \nSuperintendent is authorized to grant permission under this section without obtaining \napproval from the State Board of Education.

Shortened school days that are imposed \nrepeatedly as a disciplinary measure could count in creating a \"pattern” of removals that are a \nchange of placement that would trigger the IDEA#s procedural protections, including a \nmanifestation determination. For a student who was subjected to an administratively shortened \nday to address his behavior and it was done outside the IEP team process, those shortened days \nmay count in determining whether a pattern of removals constituting a change of placement \noccurred. It is up to a district to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a pattern or removal \nexists that would trigger a manifestation determination. \n \nCarrie Mason \nEducation Attorney \nMetro Defender Juvenile Division Education Rights Project \n100 Woodland Street \nNashville, Tennessee 37213 \nDear Ms. Mason: \n          July 27, 2018 \nThis letter responds to your correspondence to the U.S. Department of Education \n(Department), Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP). In that letter, you asked \nOSEP to provide clarification on partial day exclusions from school counting toward a \ndisciplinary change in placement. You asked, \"specifically, what factors should school \nstaff consider in determining, on a case by case basis, whether shortened school days are \nconsidered in the disciplinary change of placement analysis?” We regret the delay in \nresponding. \nIn your letter, you provide a description of one of your client#s cases in which a child \nexperienced an administratively shortened school day to address problem behavior at the \nchild#s school. You stated that the shortened school days did not occur as a result of the \n \n\n    117 \nindividualized education program (IEP) Team process. You further stated that you \nreached an agreement with the school for the child to be returned to full school days and \nfor compensatory services. However, you disagree with the school administrators about \nwhether the daily exclusions from school should be considered disciplinary removals \nwhen evaluating whether a pattern of removals has occurred that would constitute a \nchange of placement. You stated that you are concerned that students with disabilities in \nthis school are not being provided with the disciplinary protections required under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While we cannot comment \nspecifically on the facts of your case, we can provide clarification on the regulatory \nrequirements surrounding this issue. \nWe note that section 607(d) of the IDEA prohibits the Secretary from issuing policy \nletters or other statements that establish a rule that is required for compliance with, and \neligibility under, IDEA without following the rule-making requirements of section 553 of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, based on the requirements of IDEA section \n607(e), this response is provided as informal guidance and is not legally binding. This \nresponse represents an interpretation by the Department of the requirements of IDEA in \nthe context of the specific facts presented, and does not establish a policy or rule that \nwould apply in all circumstances. In addition, this response does not address issues under \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. \n \nThe Department of Education#s mission is to promote student achievement and \npreparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring \nequal access. \n \nThe IDEA authorizes school personnel to implement a short-term disciplinary removal \nfrom the current placement, such as an out-of-school suspension, for a child with a \ndisability who violates a code of student conduct, for up to 10 consecutive school days, to \nthe extent those alternatives are applied to children without disabilities, and for additional \nremovals of up to 10 consecutive school days for separate incidents of misconduct, so \nlong as those removals do not constitute a change of placement. 34 CFR §300.530(b)(1). \n \n\n    118 \nFor purposes of removals of a child with a disability from the child#s current educational \nplacement under 34 CFR §§300.530 through 300.536, a change of placement occurs if 1) \nthe removal is for more than 10 consecutive school days; or 2) the child has been \nsubjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern (i) because the series of \nremovals total more than 10 school days in a school year; (ii) because the child#s behavior \nis substantially similar to the child#s behavior in previous incidents that resulted in the \nseries of removals; and (iii) because of such additional factors as the length of each \nremoval, the total amount of time the child has been removed, and the proximity of the \nremovals to one another. 34 CFR §300.536(a). Additionally, the public agency must \ndetermine on a case- by-case basis whether a pattern of removals constitutes a change of \nplacement, and this determination is subject to review through due process and judicial \nproceedings. 34 CFR §300.536(b). \nIn general, the Department does not consider the use of exclusionary disciplinary \nmeasures to be disciplinary removals from the current placement for purposes of 34 CFR \n§300.530, so long as children with disabilities are: \n• Afforded the opportunity to continue to be involved in and make progress in the \ngeneral education curriculum; \n• Receive the instruction and services specified on their IEPs; and \n• Participate with non-disabled children to the extent they would have in their current \nplacement. \nThe use of short-term disciplinary measures under the circumstances you described, if \nimplemented repeatedly (emphasis added), could constitute a disciplinary removal from \nthe current placement, and thus the discipline procedures set out in 34 CFR §§300.530-\n300.536 would apply. \nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact Lisa Pagano of my \nstaff at 202-245-7413 or by email at Lisa.Pagano@ed.gov. \nSincerely, /s/ \nRuth E. Ryder, \nActing Director \nOffice of Special Education Programs!  \n \n\n    119 \n \nAppendix P \n \nSB 263 \n  There are clear directions as a part of the IDEA that students eligible for special \neducation and related services receive a free appropriate public education, one that confers the \nopportunity to access the general curriculum and make progress in the least restrictive \nenvironment. Oregon has something more, SB 263. This law took effect in July 2017. Given that \nthere are still students eligible for special education placed on abbreviated school days without \nfollowing the process outlined in SB 263 according to the documents we reviewed and parents \nwe interviewed, and the concerns articulated by school district personnel across the state in our \ninterviews, there needs to be clearer guidance to local school districts related to abbreviated \nschool days, along with increased supervision and monitoring by ODE of the use of this \nrestrictive practice. We recognize the legislature is not a party to this lawsuit, and ODE has no \nauthority to enforce any recommendations related to future legislative action; however our \ncharge also included recommendations for suggested changes, therefore, we make the following \nrecommendations. We strongly encourage both parties to review the recommendations and talk \nwith members of the Oregon legislature regarding improvements to the law. SB 263 was a really \ngood step in the right direction, we are making these recommendations after meeting with staff \nfrom across the state.  \n \nCurrent SB 263 \nEnrolled Senate Bill 263 \nSponsored by Senator GELSER; Senator KNOPP (Presession filed.) \nCHAPTER  \nAN ACT \nRelating to abbreviated school days; and declaring an emergency. \nBe It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon: \nSECTION 1.

However, there were a \nnumber of inconsistencies in the data reporting making it unreliable. Therefore, this new request \nis being made for the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-2020 school years.   \n \nTo help make this process easier for you, we have provided the attached spreadsheet to use while \ngathering information. You will be receiving a link to Smart Sheets Survey to submit your final \ndata.   \n \nDATA REQUESTED \n●  Please provide the number of students eligible for special education and related services \nin your district who have been placed on an “abbreviated school day” at any time during \nthe requested school years due to behavior for the following categories: \no  Preschool \no  Middle School \no  High School \no  For each disability category \nOne possible source for this information for the 2018-19 school year may be records \nprepared to comply with the requirement in OAR 581-022-2320(2)(b) that each school \ndistrict report annually to its school board “the total number of students disaggregated by \nrelevant sociodemographic group that have been exempted from the [state’s] instructional \ntime requirements.”  \n \n1.  Please provide the total number of students for whom: \na.  Disability related behaviors rendered them unable to follow COVID safety \nprotocols, thus necessitating an ASD. (i.e., If we were not in a Pandemic, \nthese students would have been on a full school day).   \n \n\n    132 \nb.  Signed parent/guardian acknowledgement in accordance with SB263 was \nobtained. \nc.  A written statement was placed in the student’s IEP explaining the reasons \nfor the abbreviated school day program.  \nd.  A transition plan was in place to return this student to a full school day.   \nPossible sources for this information may be the Abbreviated Day Notice and \nAcknowledgement form, student’s IEP, and student’s special education file. \n \nWe are striving to ensure the data collected are valid and reliable. When entering data please \nensure that you use a 0 (Zero) when there were no students for a particular data point, and if the \ndistrict did not collect the data please enter DNC in the cell.   \n \nWe are not requesting any personally identifiable information—just the number of students in \neach category. This will help the neutral third-party make appropriate recommendations \nregarding abbreviated school days for IDEA students.   \n \n \nFor the purpose of this request the following definitions will be used: \n“Behavior” includes maladaptive behaviors but may also include school refusal, \ndiscipline problems, toileting issues, etc. This does not include students who are on ASD \nfor community integration, work study programs, medical reasons, etc. \n \n“Target Population” refers to all students with disabilities aged 3 to 21 residing in \nOregon who are eligible for special education and related services under the IDEA and \nare currently being subjected to an abbreviated school day due to their behavior, \nregardless of whether it is documented in their IEP. \n \n“Abbreviated School Day,” or more generally “shortened school day,” refers to any \nschool-day during which a student within the Target Population receives instruction or \neducational services in school for fewer hours than other students who are in the same \ngrade within the same school.  \n  \n\"Transition Plan\" identifies: 1) the skills or behaviors that are currently inhibiting the \nstudent's learning and participation in a full day of school; 2) what resources (i.e., trained \npersonnel, FBA and/or BIP, space on campus, transportation, etc.) are currently \nunavailable to the student that he or she needs in order to learn and participate in a full \nschool day; 3) a plan for acquiring the necessary resources; 3) a target timeline with an \nend date for the student's attendance for full school day; 4) the type of data collected and \nrecord keeping that will occur and be analyzed regarding acquisition of necessary \nresources ; and 5) a consistent schedule of team meetings and data and record review \nregarding current student progress and acquisition of necessary resources. \n \n \n\n    133 \n“SB 263” Refers to the Oregon law passed in 2017 defining abbreviated school day and \ndistricts ’obligations when placing students on ASD.  \n \nIf you have any questions, please contact Dr. David Bateman at DavidBateman@me.com.

Because Oregon is primarily a rural state with only a few urban areas, resources to support \nstudents  with disabilities  with  mental health and behavior  challenges  (i.e.,  special  schools, \nbehavior  specialists, staff  training and  coaching,  mental  health  services,  community family \nsupports, etc.) are often sparse and difficult to find. When Local Education Agencies (LEAs) do \nnot have access to the necessary resources to adequately prevent or intervene with the challenging \nbehaviors displayed by some students, Individualized Education Program (IEP) teams frequently \nplace students on a shortened school day (SSD). LEAs often cite concerns for the safety of staff \nand students as a rationale for placing students on SSD. If the LEAs could receive ongoing support \nand could call for specific emergency support provided by an interagency team, or help developing \nand implementing the needed resources for students, the amount of days a student with disability \nis placed on SSD could be limited, if not prevented altogether.   \nInteragency teams to support IEP teams would serve the following purposes:  \n●  Identify local needs or discontinuity in policies, procedures, services, and programs that \nhinder children with disabilities from maintaining placement in full-day school programs;  \n●  Increase the availability, access, and quality of interagency behavior intervention and \nbehavioral  health  services  through  the  development  and  improvement  of  policies, \nprocedures, systems, funding, and other mechanisms for providing supports in the school \nsetting or alternative placement options that maintain a full-day school program; \n●  Help other service representatives understand the educational service system including \nlaws, regulations, and policies related to transition services; roles and responsibilities of \nfamilies and district personnel; roles of local or regional interagency planning teams; and \nroles now expected of other service agencies involved; and \n●  Develop a state-wide professional development program to create teams for all regions in \nthe state to provide training to those who support the LEAs along with follow-up coaching \n \n\n    136 \nregarding evidence-based mental health planning and interventions and behavior planning \nand intervention strategies. \nThe ODE should develop a system for providing intensive interagency support to students with \ndisabilities whose LEAs have determined they cannot be appropriately educated in a public \neducational setting and who have been placed on a shortened school day for more than 30 days \nand need assistance for the provision of an appropriate educational placement. This system should \nalso be aimed at providing assistance to students who are at substantial risk of waiting more than \n30 days for an appropriate educational placement. \n  LEAs must also  report  students with  disabilities who  are  placed  on  an  abbreviated \n(shortened) school day related to the display of challenging behavior(s) so ODE can determine \nwhether these students require intensive interagency coordination. \n \nProcedures \n  The system of intensive interagency coordination is not intended to replace the local \nprocess. In the majority of situations requiring interagency efforts, local IEP and Interagency \nTeams do not require additional assistance to assure the provision of appropriate educational \nprograms and placements for the students who they serve. Intensive interagency coordination is \ndesigned for the rare situations when local teams do not have the resources and supports needed \nto serve the students for a full day, and the students have been placed on an abbreviated school day \nfor more than 30 days. \n  LEAs have a crucial role in identifying which students require intensive interagency \ncoordination, since these are students whom the LEA has determined cannot currently be served \nin the public educational setting for a full day due to behaviors. It is important to address that these \nstudents are still entitled to a free appropriate public education and need supports to be able to \naccess a full educational day. In addition to assisting LEAs with providing appropriate educational \nprograms and placements, the system of intensive interagency coordination would work towards \nthe goal of enhancing the capacity of LEA programs so the needs of students with disabilities can \nbe met in public educational settings in most situations. \n  If there is a dispute about the appropriateness of the student’s program or placement, this \ndispute must be resolved through mediation and/or due process hearing procedures. Program \nand/or placement disputes should not be resolved through an intensive interagency coordination. \n \n\n    137 \nODE would require LEAs to identify any student in need of intensive interagency coordination.  \nInitial reports must be filed within five days of initial identification of these students and reports \nmust be updated on a monthly basis until an appropriate placement is provided. As stated above, \nthe students who must be identified are those:  \n(1) whose LEA has determined that the student due to behaviors cannot currently be served \nin the public educational setting; and  \n(2) who have been placed on a shortened school day for more than 30 days (or are at \nsubstantial risk of waiting more than 30 days for a placement.) \nIn addition, parents, advocates, representatives of child serving agencies, and other individuals \nmay be able to call the ODE point person regarding a student who may potentially require intensive \ninteragency coordination. \n  Once an LEA reports a student to ODE, the point person will work to coordinate the local \ninteragency supports, in conjunction with the District Support Specialists. The District Support \nSpecialists will make an initial determination regarding whether the student requires intensive \ninteragency coordination, or if he or she can be served by another portion of the special education \nsystem. \nIf  the  student  requires  intensive  interagency  coordination  to  access  an  appropriate \neducational placement, the District Support Specialists will assess the matter and work with the \nIEP and Interagency teams to determine the barrier(s) preventing the student from receiving full-\nday services in the agreed-upon placement. If necessary to resolve the matter, the District Support \nSpecialists will promptly schedule a meeting of the local interagency team, which should include \nthe family of the student, the LEA and representatives of the ESD, and other relevant child serving \nagencies, such as county offices of Intellectual Disabilities, Mental Health, and Children, Youth \nand Families, and regional offices of Vocational Rehabilitation. If the student’s placement is not \nresolved within 30 school days (with the exception of the summer months) by the local interagency \nteam, the District Support Specialists will forward a report to the office of the ODE Director for \nappropriate intervention with other state agencies based on the presenting issue(s). \n  The District Support Specialists in collaboration with ODE, will regularly review their \nreferrals to identify whether any illustrate the need to enhance the capacity of an LEA or ESD \nprogram. When the need to enhance local capacity is identified, the LEAs or ESDs at issue will \nincorporate specific details of capacity-building activities that will be undertaken to remedy the \n \n\n    138 \nneed in their special education plans (LEAs) or annual plans (ESDs). ODE will then monitor the \nLEAs or ESDs progress in building the identified capacity. \n  In addition to the case referral system described above, in accordance with the IDEA \nrelated to interagency coordination, ODE should identify the manner in which services should be \ncoordinated among child-serving agencies to ensure students with disabilities receive a free \nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment. ODE should also form an \ninteragency committee to coordinate services for individuals with disabilities, which would \naddress issues related to capacity building that are beyond the control of LEAs or ESDs. \n \n \n \n   \n \n\n    139 \nAppendix U \n \nRecommendations for Guidance on FBAs/BIPs \n \nODE Guidance for FBAs and BIPs \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the federal law outlining what \nis required to ensure each child with a disability needs to receive a Free Appropriate Public \nEducation (FAPE). Outlined in this law are a number of processes to help ensure teams and school \ndistricts use the necessary tools to determine and carry out the services to provide FAPE.  However, \nthere are “tools” included in IDEA that are not clearly defined or clearly outlined. Nowhere is this \nmore true than with Functional Behavioral Assessments (FBA). \nTherefore, local school districts look to states for guidance on the implementation of \nrequirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to ensure children with \ndisabilities receive Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). The IDEA regulations do not \ndefine an FBA or explain the steps required to complete one. Instead, FBA requirements are left \nto state law or local policy that may articulate a specific process. The only guidance from the \nfederal government, \"requires the public agency to ensure that the child is assessed in all areas \nrelated  to  the  suspected disability…..If a child's behavior  or  physical  status is of concern, \nevaluations addressing these areas must be conducted.\" 9          \nFederal law requires an FBA whenever a child with a disability has an educational placement \nchange for disciplinary reasons in the following instances: \n1.  when a child is removed from school for more than 10 consecutive days for behavior \nthat is a manifestation of the student’s disability; \n2.  when a child is removed for more than 10 school days for conduct that is not a \nmanifestation  of  the  disability  but  the  IEP  team  determines  that  an  FBA  is \nnecessary.10 \n          In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or that of others, the \nfederal regulations require IEP teams to consider the use of positive behavioral interventions, \n \n9 34 C.F.R. § 300.304 (c)(4). \n10 34 C.F.R. § 300.530 \n \n\n    140 \nsupports,  and  other  strategies  to  address  that  behavior.11 IEP  teams  have  wide  latitude  in \ndetermining how to best address a child’s behavior, through behavioral goals, behavioral supports \nand services (such as a behavior coach or counseling services), or a behavioral intervention plan \n(BIP). Broadly defined, a BIP is a plan based on the results of an FBA and, at a minimum, includes \na description of the problem behavior, global and specific hypotheses as to why the problem \nbehavior occurs, and intervention strategies that include proactive and reactive behavioral supports \nand services to address the behavior. Additionally, behavior can be addressed outside of the IEP \nprocess through a behavior contract or the use of informal strategies. \n          The IDEA regulations are silent on how an FBA is to be conducted. The IEP team \ndetermines  what  constitutes  a  valid  or  a  current  FBA.12 The  regulations  affirm  that  when \ndeveloping a child’s IEP, as it relates to a child whose behavior impedes his learning or that of \nothers, the IEP team must consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports and \nother strategies to address the behavior.13 This may, or may not include a FBA; however, behavior \nis to be addressed with an FBA in certain disciplinary situations.14 There’s further ambiguity \nregarding who is qualified to conduct an FBA, as “[t]he statute and regulations do not specify \nwhich individuals must conduct the FBA. There is no Part B requirement . . . that a Board Certified \nBehavior Analyst (BCBA) conduct the FBA, unless State law imposes such a requirement”.15 \n          To make matters worse for local school districts and for parents, there is also a lack of \nclarity about when to develop a BIP. Despite the fact that many students may clearly benefit from \na BIP, the only time a BIP is required by the IDEA is when a student’s behavior has led to a \ndisciplinary change of placement that is determined to be a manifestation of his/her disability.16 \nWhen this occurs, the IDEA regulations require the school to return the child to the placement \nfrom which he or she was removed and require the child’s IEP team to conduct an FBA and \ndevelop and implement a BIP for the child, or review and modify an existing BIP as necessary to \naddress the behavior.17 The regulations do not define a BIP or explain what such a plan must look \n \n11 34 C.F.R. § 300.324(a)(2)(i) \n12 34 C.F.R. Part 300, Analysis of Comments and Changes, Subpart E-Procedural Safeguards, \nFederal Register, Vol. 71, No. 156, p. 46721 (August 2006) \n13 34 C.F.R. § 300.324(a)(2) \n14 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.530(d)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(i) \n15 Letter to Janssen, 51 IDELR 253 (OSERS 2008) \n16 34 C.F.R. § 300.530(f)(1)(i-ii) \n17 34 C.F.R. § 300.530(f)(1) \n \n\n    141 \nlike. Like the contents and standards of the FBA, the contents and standards of the BIP is left to \nthe IEP team. \n          The IDEA does not specify who is qualified to conduct FBAs. States or even districts must \ndetermine who conducts the assessments. Although the IDEA does not state who should conduct \nFBAs, districts should ensure those who do conduct them are adequately trained. Since the \ndevelopment of an FBA often does not neatly fit under the responsibility of any one individual or \njob title within a school district, this furthers exemplifies the need for effective Guidance from \nstate education agencies. \n          The development of an FBA is a three-step process: 1) defining the problem behavior; 2) \ncollecting data about the antecedents and consequences of the behavior; and 3) developing a \nhypothesis about the function of the behavior. Appropriate FBAs use various methods of collecting \nrelevant data, identifying the child's most significant concerning behaviors, identifying the triggers \nand consequences of those behaviors, and providing guidance on how to create an educational \nprogram and behavior plan to address the behaviors. \n          As with FBAs, Local Education Agencies (LEA) seek guidance in best practice for the \ndevelopment of BIPs. The Supreme Court stated very clearly in the Endrew F. decision in 2017 \nthat the standard for determining FAPE is whether a district's plan is reasonably calculated to \nenable a child to make progress appropriately in light of the child's circumstances. The BIP should \nbe tailored to the unique needs of the particular child and be appropriately ambitious in light of the \nchild's  circumstances.18 IEP teams  should  consider the  behavioral needs of students  in the \ndevelopment, review, and revision of IEPs when necessary to provide FAPE. Teams must consider \nand include appropriate behavioral goals, objectives and other appropriate services and supports \nin the IEPs of children whose behavior impedes their own learning or the learning of their peers.19 \nHowever, since the content of the BIP is not clearly delineated in the federal regulations, there \nneeds to be guidance for LEAs from State Education Agencies (SEA) about the requirements and \nprocess. \n \n18 Endrew F. v. Douglas County School Dist. RE–1 798 F. 3d 1329 (2017). \n19 https://sites.ed.gov/idea/files/qa-endrewcase-12-07-2017.pdf \n \n\n    142 \n          In 2005, Researchers analyzed state guidance on FBA/BIP’s available to LEA’s and \ndetermined that 41 states had information and materials related to FBA development.20 They also \nfound, however, that the materials were not adequate to support local school districts in the \ndevelopment of FBAs. Some of these same researchers in a parallel study, found only 40 SEAs \nhad guidance related to the development of BIPs and, like the FBA study, the vast majority were \nnot adequate to support local school districts. \n          A major study was completed in 2011 by Zirkel.21 Among other important items, the Zirkel \nstudy found only 17 state laws provided definitions of FBAs and/or BIPs, and the vast majority of \nthese definitions merely mentioned some of the key elements in the special education literature, \nsuch as \"function\" for FBAs or \"interventions\" for BIP. It also identified only 31 specific state \nstatutes and regulations that related to the FBAs and BIPs, and most of the states were fairly limited \nin scope and specificity.  \n  In light of these current nationwide circumstances and Oregon’s Department of Education \n(ODE) current lawsuit regarding the lack of provision of FAPE for students with IEPs who were \nplaced on abbreviated school days due to their behavior challenges, we are recommending that \nODE provide clear Guidance for all LEAs on the necessary components for conducting FBAs and \ndeveloping and implementing BIPs across the state. Below are some suggested best practices that \ncan be used when developing guidance or best practice documents for Oregon LEA’s and families. \nFunctional Behavior Assessment Components  \n  An appropriate functional behavioral assessment consists of eight components, each of \nwhich is discussed below.   \n1.  A requirement for input to be collected from multiple sources in order to identify and \ndefine the problem target behavior(s). (Note: It is important for bias to be considered \nregarding the persons and sources of information collected. The FBA process should be \nimplemented by a team and the lead of the team should not be the student’s teacher). \na.  These sources must include: \ni.  a minimum of two individuals working directly with the student, AND \n \n20Killu, K., Weber, K. P., Derby, K. M., & Barretto, A. (2006).

Behavioral Disorders, 36(4), 262-278. \n \n\n    143 \nii. a minimum of two different routines or environments, AND \niii. a minimum of two methods of data with supporting details regarding who \nand what kind of information and data collection is appropriate (i.e., \ninterview, Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence data, duration, frequency), \nAND \nb.  Examples and non-examples must be provided to help professionals understand \nwhat multiple sources can look like (persons to interview, sources of paper \ninformation/document gathering and indirect and data collection) and how to \nprovide and describe results in a report. \n2.  Target problem behavior(s) are to be identified and defined (easily observable and \nmeasurable). (If more than one behavior is identified, it must be clear which behaviors \nwill be the focus of the FBA.)  \na.  to identify and operationally define (i.e., are observable and measurable and can \nbe seen, heard, counted) ALL target problem behaviors, AND \nb.  to provide a clear link between the target problem behavior(s) that is identified \nand the behavior that is identified in the Hypothesis Statement (Component 8) \nsection, AND  \nc.  to provide examples and non-examples to help professionals, AND  \nd.  to include clarifications on acceptable identification and definitions, AND \ne.  to provide the following clarifications and explanations: \ni.  If there is more than one problem behavior identified, the FBA needs to \naddress more than one target behavior or prioritize how and when they \nwill all be addressed.  \nii. Behaviors do not need to be broken down into discrete units (e.g., pushes \nuntil the other person is moved 1.5 meters/inches), but behaviors are \nclearly defined so anyone can determine when the behavior starts and \nstops (onset and offset). \niii. Behavior definitions in “dead man” terminology (i.e., a dead person could \n \n\n    144 \nperform the behaviors - “he lays on the ground”) are not acceptable.22 \niv. Any target problem behavior(s) that are checked from a pre-stocked \ndropdown checklist in a computer-based program should also always \ninclude an open-ended field for individualized description. \n1.  Baseline data on the problem behaviors are required to be collected and detailed or \nsummarized. The data is in addition to office discipline referrals (ODRs), in-school \nsuspension  (ISS),  and/or  out-of-school  suspension  (OSS)  data.  Note:  The \nguidelines do not need to indicate that they require the analysis process be at the \nlevel of a board certified behavior analyst, but it should include a summary of all \nthe data that allows a team to determine how behavior occurred over the time period \nthat data was collected (e.g., statements such as “4 times a day on average,” “10 \ntimes a week”). Baseline data collection guidelines include the following: \na.  must be collected across multiple days or multiple environments and during \ntimes when the behavior is most likely to occur and least likely to occur, \nAND \nb.  must address, in the description, the four essential details:  \ni.  name and definition of target behavior;  \nii. method/format  (e.g.,  frequency,  rating/intensity  scale,  ABC, \nduration, etc.),  \niii. time period it was collected (e.g., dates, statement such as “data \ncollected over last two weeks”), and \niv. analysis of outcomes (e.g., “average of four times a week”), AND \nc.  must provide examples for professionals (see below) of how or what data \ncan be collected and presented. See examples below: \ni.  “Frequency data box checked; 9/01/19-9/05/21; hitting averages \nthree times a week, and hitting was the problem behavior targeted”. \nii. “Data collected over the last three weeks show that Jack cursed 3-5 \ntimes a day.” \n \n22 \nhttps://www.zumbroed.org/cms/lib/MN01909273/Centricity/Domain/53/StrangerDeadMansTest.\npdf \n \n\n    145 \niii. Data may be provided in a graph, check box, or narrative format. \n2.  Setting Events (SE) (i.e., slow triggers, events that provide the context or “set the \nstage” for a higher likelihood of problem behavior) are required to be considered, \nidentified and the contingency to the target problem behavior be described. Note: \nIf the guidelines specify identifying setting events, then the Hypothesis Statement \n(Component 8) section should also include the identified setting event(s) and \nrelation to the target behavior. Setting events guidelines include the following: \na.  Requirements for the team to follow the SE-A-B-C analysis process, AND \nb.  Clear explanations and definitions of setting events, AND  \nc.  Requirement of at least one setting event analysis, AND \nd.  Description of the relation to the target behavior (all of which is included in \nthe hypothesis statement) (Component 8), AND \ne.  Provision of examples and non-examples to help professionals understand \nhow to identify setting events (and difference from setting and antecedents) \nand describe the relationship between a setting event and target behavior. \n3.  Antecedent events in which target problem behavior is least likely to occur (or \nappropriate behavior is more likely to occur) and most likely to occur are required \nto be identified and specified. Note: The guidelines need to make it clear that it is \nalso important to indicate in the FBA the situations in which there is an absence of \nthe target problem behavior. Antecedent events descriptions include the following:  \na.  Identification of one or more antecedent events in which problem behavior \nis least likely and most likely to occur, AND \nb.  Detailed explanation of how antecedent data should be collected (i.e., in \nobservable and measurable terms) and described within the FBA, AND \nc.  List of useful examples and non-examples for professionals to understand \nthe  difference  and  need  for  identifying  most  likely  and  least  likely \nantecedents. \n4.  Consequence events (i.e., how others respond immediately after problem behavior \noccurs) are required to be identified and described. Note: Guidelines need to explain \nthat there is a difference between describing the immediate consequence event that \noccurs and describing the consequence in a manner that serves as a function. For \n \n\n    146 \nexample, Consequence Event: Children look at the child and snicker and laugh; \nConsequence/Function: The child gains attention from peers. For this component, \nidentification of the consequence event(s) is important so that later in Components \n7 and 8, the inference and identification of the “function of the behavior” can be \nclearly tied to the baseline data acquired regarding the consequence events that are \nmaintaining the behavior. Consequence events descriptions need to include the \nfollowing: \na.  Identification of the immediate consequence event(s) following the target \nproblem behavior(s), AND  \nb.  Explanations to help professionals understand they need to describe all of \nthe consequence events in observable and measurable terms, AND \nc.  Explanations that consequences must be specified for each target behavior, \nwhen multiple target behaviors are present, AND  \nd.  List of useful examples and non-examples for professionals to help them \nunderstand how to identify immediate consequence events and describe \nthem adequately. \n5.  The function of the target problem behavior(s) is required to be identified and is \none listed in research literature (i.e., gain attention, gain tangible item, activity, or \nsensory stimulation, avoid attention, avoid task, activity or sensory stimulation), \nprovides specificity, and is linked to the FBA data (i.e., Components 4-6). Note: \nFunction of the target problem behaviors include the following:  \na.  Explanations of how valid functions are determined by what the individual \ntries to gain or avoid (positive reinforcement (access/obtain) or negative \nreinforcement (escape/avoid)) and are observable.  \nb.  Identification of a function for each of the identified target behaviors, AND \nc.  Description of the process for identifying the function(s), AND \nd.  Definition and link between functions of a target behavior to the data if there \nis more than one function for a behavior identified. AND \ne.  List of examples and non-examples with appropriate ways to write about \nthe function of the behavior and linking it to the data. \n \n\n    147 \n6.  An identifiable hypothesis/summary statement of the target problem behavior(s) is \nrequired to be present and includes the five main essential components discussed \npreviously (setting events, antecedent events, functions that are linked to the setting \nevents, antecedents and consequences, and current consequence events maintaining \nthe behavior). Hypothesis statement must include all of the following: \na.  A definition and examples of each of the five components, AND \nb.  A clear link to the SE-A-B-C data, AND \nc.  An example of a sample hypothesis statement for professionals to follow \nwhen providing their statement, including \ni.  Instructions  on  how  to  integrate  multiple  functions  within  the \nhypothesis statement (if there are multiple functions for the target \nbehavior), AND \nii. Examples  and  non-examples  on  how  to  incorporate  all  four \ncomponents in the hypothesis statement. \nBehavior Intervention Plan Component  \n  The FBA and, if available, previous BIP data is then used to develop an appropriate BIP. \nAn appropriate BIP consists of 10 components described below.   \n1.  A BIP is required to be developed in a timely manner upon completion of the FBA. Note: \nThe guidelines need to include some discussion about the difference between a new BIP \nand an updated BIP and, if the current BIP being reviewed is an update to a previous \nFBA/BIP, the team must describe how they determined the FBA information collected at \na much earlier date is still accurate or provide a description of the FBA data they updated \nto confirm the original hypothesis is still valid. Guidelines need to be clear about timelines \nfor BIP to be developed within a certain amount of time (i.e. school days) after FBA was \ncompleted and must be clear that all dates on all documents need to be accurate and \ncoincide with reported timelines. \n2.  The hypothesis/summary statement requires the following: \na.  Is linked to and developed from the FBA or data from previous BIP (and needs to \nbe restated and included in the new or updated BIP). AND \nb.  Is included/restated in the behavior intervention plan. AND  \nc.  Is identical to all five components as those included in the FBA.  \n \n\n    148 \nd.  Note: Guidelines can also provide for the FBA and BIP to be part of the same \ndocument (e.g., stapled together, page numbers are continuous; form numbers are \nsequential) and references correctly made to all the necessary components in the \none overall document. \n3.  Behavior goals for increasing the replacement behavior and decreasing the target problem \nbehavior are required to be identified and written in a way that is achievable, observable, \nand measurable and include a clear timeframe for achievement/monitoring. Note: 1) In \nshort term objectives, then these need to also include a measurable difference between each \nobjective progressing toward the goal, and 2) there should also be skill acquisition goals in \nthe student’s IEP linking to the target problem behaviors in the BIP (i.e., if the student’s \ninability to read is part of the reason the behavior is occurring, then a skill acquisition goal \nshould  be  included  regarding  his  or  her  reading  skills).  Behavior  goals  require  the \nfollowing: \na.  An explanation or delineation on forms separating goals that are needed for both \nreplacement behavior and target problem behavior, AND \nb.  An explanation how the goals need to be achievable, observable, measurable, and \ninclude a specific timeframe, with the measurable aspect being linked to current \nbaseline data from the FBA. AND \nc.  Explanations and examples or non-examples for written behavior goals.  \n4.  Strategies/interventions that directly address and modify antecedent events listed in the \n“when” component of the FBA Hypothesis Statement (Component 8) are required to be \nidentified and described in enough detail for implementation as a part of the intervention. \nRequirements for strategies/interventions are as follows: \na.  Identification of at least one antecedent intervention strategy. AND \nb.  Linkage  of  strategies  to  the  FBA  hypothesis  (both  to  the  setting  events, \nantecedent(s) and the function). AND \nc.  Detailed description of the intervention for ease of implementation and replication \n(e.g., who is doing the intervention, the different points at which different strategies \nare implemented related to the setting events, antecedents and consequences, and, \nhow the adults working with the child will use different prompting, teaching, \naccommodations and modifications, etc). AND \n \n\n    149 \nd.  Description  of  intervention  as  a  preventative  strategy  (the  intervention  is \nimplemented prior to student performance of problem behavior and to prevent the \nbehavior from occurring). AND \ne.  List of examples and non-examples to help professionals understand antecedent-\nbased strategies/interventions (proactive and preventative). \n5.  A replacement behavior (a minimum of one) must be identified, defined, and taught to the \nstudent that is linked to the FBA hypothesis (Component 8), and described in enough detail \nfor implementation. A replacement behavior must include the following: \na.  serve the same function as the problem behavior or is incompatible with the \nproblem behavior, AND  \nb.  describes an intervention with enough detail implementation (i.e., a stranger would \nbe able to implement the strategy). AND \nc.  the exact skill that will be taught, AND \nd.  who will teach the skill, AND \ne.  at what point related to the antecedent will the skill be prompted or practiced, AND  \nf.  how the skill will be taught (instructional plan), AND \ng.  explain that the replacement behavior should be one that is a functional equivalent \n(i.e., a behavior that directly seeks the same function) or an alternate skill (e.g., pro-\nsocial/ academically desirable behavior), AND \nh.  align with the behavior goals written in the IEP, AND \ni.  provide examples and non-examples for professionals to understand. \n6.  Reinforcement of the replacement behavior must be identified and described as ones that \nprovide the same outcome/function as did the target problem behavior and is described in \nenough detail to implement. Reinforcement of the replacement behavior must include the \nfollowing: \na.  Identification of at least one strategy in the BIP to reinforce the use of replacement \nbehavior, AND \nb.  Requirement that it results in the same outcome/function as the problem behavior, \nAND \nc.  Described  in  enough  detail  so  a  stranger  would  be  able  to  implement  the \nintervention with the student and/or multiple people would implement the strategy \n \n\n    150 \nin the same way.  \nd.  Provision of examples and non-examples to help professionals understand what \nreinforcement strategies/interventions are. \n7.  Elimination of the maintaining (current) consequence events and implementation of new \nconsequence events must include the following: \na.  Description  with  sufficient  detail  to  implement  (i.e.,  changes  the  way  others \nrespond to problem behavior). AND \nb.  Identification of at least one strategy in the BIP to minimize reinforcement of the \nproblem behavior. AND \nc.  Identification of at least one strategy be identified in the BIP to implement a \nconsequence when the target problem behavior occurs that decreases the likelihood \nof  the  occurrence  of  the  target  problem  behavior  in  the  future  (punishment \nprocedure), AND \nd.  Linkage to the function, AND \ne.  Detailed description enough that a stranger would be able to implement the strategy \nwith the student and/or multiple people would implement the strategy in the same \nway. AND \nf.  Explanation  that  drop-down  box  menus  are  not  appropriate  without  an \naccompanying detailed description of the intervention. AND \ng.  Inclusion  of  examples  and  non-examples  are  included  to  help  professionals \nunderstand  what  consequence  strategies  are.  Examples  should  include \nimplementation of punishment procedures, not just withholding reinforcement. \n8.  Crisis or safety plan must be included in the BIP and be described with sufficient detail. \nThis should include the following: \na.  A brief explanation of why an individualized Crisis or Safety Plan is needed (i.e., \nin the case that an extinction burst would include dangerous or violent behavior, \netc.), AND \nb.  An explanation that a crisis plan is not a behavior change intervention and is only \nused as a last resort in emergency cases. AND \nc.  An explanation that it may be a separate document referred to and attached to the \nBIP and would require:  \n \n\n    151 \ni.  sufficient detail regarding the individualization of the plan with who, what, \nwhen and how things will be done. AND \nii.  provide examples and non-examples to help professionals understand what \nand how to write a clear crisis/safety plan. \n9.  A detailed plan for collecting monitoring data on both the problem target behavior and \nreplacement behavior through the implementation of the BIP must be included in the BIP. \nThe plan must include the following: \na.  details and specifics describing who will collect the data, how often it will be \ncollected, and the format of the data collection and data presentation/explanation, \nAND \nb.  review dates for collecting outcome data on both the problem and replacement \nbehavior, AND  \nc.  strategies that are clearly linked to the target problem behavior and replacement \nbehavior on the intervention plan (i.e., frequency data for discrete occurrences of \nhitting or duration data for tantrum behavior). AND \nd.  examples and non-examples to help professionals understand what and how to write \na clear plan for data monitoring. \n10. A detailed plan for the collection of fidelity data on BIP implementation must be included \nin the BIP. This plan must include the following:  \na.  Detailed  description  of  specific  procedures  for  collecting  fidelity-of-\nimplementation data (e.g., who, when, how, review). AND \nb.  Examples and non-examples of the data to help professionals to write a clear and \nreplicable fidelity data collection plan. \n \n!  \n \n\n    152 \nAppendix V \n \nRecommendations for Guidance on Shortened School Day in a Question and Answer \nFormat \n \n \nShortened School Day \n \nThe  Oregon  Department  of  Education  (ODE),  as  the  State  Educational  Agency  (SEA),  is \nresponsible for general supervision of every Local Education Agency (LEA) within the state to \nensure the requirements of Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act \n(“IDEA”) are met pursuant to 34 CFR § 300.149.  \n \nDefinitions \n \nFAPE: All  students  with an Individualized Education Program  (IEP) are  entitled  to a free \nappropriate public education (FAPE). This includes students who are eligible for special education \nfrom the ages of 3 through 2123. FAPE is individually determined for each student with a disability. \nFAPE must include special education in the least restrictive environment (LRE) and may include \nrelated services, transition services, supplementary aids and services, and/or assistive technology \ndevices and services. The LEA is required to ensure a FAPE is available to students enrolled in \nthe LEA who are eligible for special education. \n \nLRE: The IDEA mandates all students with disabilities, 3 through 21 years of age, be educated, to \nthe maximum extent appropriate, with their non-disabled peers (i.e., the student’s LRE).24 The \nLRE is the appropriate balance of settings and services to meet the student’s individual needs. \nLEAs must have an array of services and a continuum of educational setting options available to \nmeet the individual LRE needs of each student. An appropriate LRE is one that enables the student \nto make reasonable gains toward goals identified in an IEP. The student’s IEP must indicate the \nindividualized LRE placement and provide a justification for any removal from the general \neducation setting to provide services. The IEP team must give first consideration to educating the \n \n23 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A) \n24 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5) \n \n\n    153 \nstudent in the general education setting with supplemental aids and services. Letter to Cohen, 25 \nIDELR 516 (OSEP 1996). If a student is unable to make progress in the general education setting \nwith appropriate supplemental aids and services, the IEP may consider to what extent, if any, the \nstudent may be removed from the general education classroom environment to receive specially \ndesigned instruction. In addition, consideration must be given to any potential current or long-term \nharmful effect on the student or on the quality of services the student needs, including the student’s \nability to graduate and achieve his or her post high-school goals. \n \nCompulsory Attendance: Oregon requires all children between the ages of 6 and 18 years who \nhave not completed the 12th grade to attend regularly a public full-time school during the entire \nschool term, unless a statutory exception applies. ORS 339.010. LEAs share responsibility with \nparents/guardians  to  ensure  school-age  children  are  enrolled  in  and  attending  appropriate \neducational programs. Further, all children eligible for special education between the ages of five \n(5) and twenty-one (21) have a civil right of access to a free, appropriate, public education. \n \nLength of the School Day: As part of the protections afforded under the IDEA, students with \ndisabilities have the right to attend school each day for the same length of time as non-disabled \nstudents. School day has the same meaning for all children—disabled and non-disabled—enrolled \nin the school. 34 CFR § 300.11(c). This premise is grounded in the IDEA and bolstered by Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504). Public agencies must comply with both the IDEA and \nSection 504 when a student is eligible for service under the IDEA. Yankton Sch. Dist. v. Shramm, \n93 F.3d 1369, 1376 (8th Cir. 1996). The failure to provide the same instructional time for students \nwith disabilities is actionable under the IDEA and Section 504 as a denial of a FAPE. K.F. v. \nFrancis Howell R-III Sch. Dist., No. 4:07CV01691 ERW. 2008 WL 723751, *4 (E.D. Mo. March \n17, 2018). \n \nInstruction Conducted in the Home is the most restrictive option on the continuum of special \neducation placements for students with disabilities. This placement is provided as a last resort \nwhen a student with disabilities requires that special education services and programs can only be \nconducted in the home or a mutually agreed upon location that is decided by the IEP Team. A \n \n\n    154 \nPrior Written Notice must be provided documenting this decision of the student’s educational \nplacement. \n \nHomebound Instruction is described as temporary excusals due to illness or other urgent reasons, \n“A principal or teacher may, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of mental, physical or other \nurgent reasons, excuse a student for nonattendance during a temporary period, but the term ‘urgent \nreasons’ shall be strictly construed and does not permit irregular attendance. A school district shall \nadopt rules and procedures governing temporary excusals that may be granted by principals and \nteachers under this section. A school district, area vocational technical school, may provide \nstudents temporarily excused under this section with homebound instruction for a period not to \nexceed three months. A school district, area vocational technical school, may request approval \nfrom ODE to extend the provision of homebound instruction, which shall be reevaluated every \nthree months.\" \n \nLegal Standard \nThe IDEA mandates eligible students receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) that \nincludes special education and related services that: \n(a) Are provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without \ncharge. \n(b) Meet the standards of the SEA, including the requirements of this part. \n(c) Include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school \neducation in the state involved. \n(d) Are provided in conformity with an individualized education program (IEP) that \nmeets the requirements of 34 CFR §§ 300.320 through 300.324. \n \nThe United  States Supreme  Court has  ruled  school  districts  must  offer  an  IEP reasonably \ncalculated to enable a student to make progress appropriate in light of the student’s unique \ncircumstances. Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District RE-1, 137 S. Ct. 988, 197 L Ed. 2d \n335, 349 (2017); see also Questions and Answers on Endrew F. v. Douglas County Sch. Dist. Re- \n1, December 7, 2017 (US Dept. of Educ.). \n \n \n\n    155 \nSchools have a fundamental obligation under the IDEA to provide a FAPE to all students that \naddresses each child’s unique academic, behavioral, emotional, physical, and functional needs that \nadversely affect his or her educational performance. Letter to Wentzell, 69 IDELR 79 (OSEP \n2016). The right to a FAPE is afforded to all eligible students. This principle flows from the \"zero-\nreject\" policy articulated in Timothy W v. Rochester, N.H. School District, 875 F. 2nd 954 (1st Cir. \n1989), guaranteeing a FAPE to all disabled students no matter the severity of their cognitive or \nbehavioral needs. \n \nStudents with disabilities must attend school for the same number of hours and minutes as non-\ndisabled students, unless a student’s IEP team determines otherwise based on a student’s unique, \ndisability-related needs. Shortening a student’s day raises issues regarding the provision of a FAPE \nunder the IDEA, as well as potential discrimination under Section 504. The only use of a shortened \nday as necessary for the provision of FAPE should be for a specific purpose and designed to meet \na student’s unique needs. A student’s IEP team must discuss the continuum of services and \nplacement, including shortened day and any alternatives considered as appropriate, and the Prior \nWritten Notice should reflect these proposals and refusals and the bases for the team’s decisions. \nIEP teams should exercise caution when placing a student on a shortened day as it may limit a \nstudent’s ability to make adequate progress on IEP goals, access the general education curriculum, \nmeet graduation requirements, and receive FAPE in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). \nAny offer of FAPE that includes a shortened day must be for a specific purpose and designed to \nmeet a student’s unique needs and reported to ODE if it lasts more than 30-school days. The use \nof a shortened school day for any student should be rare, temporary, and viewed as the last option \nbecause it severely restricts the student’s opportunity to receive an appropriate education with their \npeers and benefit from the modeling and incidental learning inherent to inclusive settings. \n \nUnder all but the rarest circumstances, a shortened school day should be in place for only a limited \namount of time. When an IEP team determines the need to shorten a student’s school day, the \nstudent’s IEP should include: \n1. An explanation of why the student’s unique disability-related needs require a shortened \nday. 34 CFR § 300.320(a)(1). \n \n\n    156 \n2. A clear explanation of the unique need or skill gap prohibiting the student from attending \na full day of school, 34 CFR §§ 300.320(a)(4)-(5), and the instruction the district will \nprovide to the student to close that skill gap. \n3. A clear connection to the growth and progress expected to be achieved by shortening the \nstudent’s school day (e.g., the student is expected to recover from the physical or \nmedical condition with rest and medical treatment). 34 CFR § 300.320(a)(3). \n4. An explicit plan for the student’s return to school for a full-day, which includes a plan \nto regularly meet on a pre-established timeline to review student data and determine \nwhether the student is able to return to school full-time and, if not, how much time can \nbe added to the student’s day. 34 CFR § 300.114. \nThe student must return to a full school day as soon as he or she is able, affording a student a full \neducational opportunity as required by 34 CFR § 300.109. \n \nAs a result of the interim agreement in the J.N. v. Oregon Department of Education lawsuit, we \nrecommend ODE issue the following Guidance to provide consistent, clear answers to districts \nand parents regarding the use of shortened school day for a child with a disability. \n \n1. What is the general requirement regarding the length of the school day for students with \ndisabilities? \n● All Oregon public schools share responsibility with parents/guardians to ensure school-age \nchildren are enrolled in and attending appropriate educational programs. Under Oregon’s \ncompulsory school law, all children between age 6 and 18 must attend a public or private or \nreceive home schooling unless the student is excused under the law or has graduated with a \nregular diploma. \n● Oregon’s compulsory school law applies to students with disabilities in the same manner as \nit applies to students without disabilities. Students with disabilities must attend school for \nthe  same  number  of  hours  and  minutes  as  non-disabled  students,  unless  a  student’s \nindividualized education program (IEP) team determines otherwise based on a student’s \nunique, disability-related needs. \n● A school district may excuse a school age child from compulsory school attendance upon \nrecommendation of the student#s physician and a psychiatrist or school psychologist, or \n \n\n    157 \nboth, and with the approval of ODE. Prior to seeking excusal and approval, the school \ndistrict must provide the child's parents with written notice of both the proposed excusal, \nincluding the reasons for the excusal, and an opportunity to be heard. \n \n2. When is it appropriate for a school district to provide a shortened school day for a student \nwith a disability? \nThe only time it is appropriate to shorten the school day for a student with a disability is \nwhen the student’s IEP team determines a shortened day is required to address the student’s \nunique disability-related needs. Examples of brief, shortened days for a specific purpose \nthat may not impede a student receiving FAPE in an LRE (this is not an exhaustive list): \ni) Student who has recently undergone chemotherapy treatment for cancer and is \ncurrently in recovery, needs a transitional reduced day due to fatigue associated \nwith recovery; \nii) Physician of a student transitioning to new seizure medications requests \ngradually increasing the length of day; \nBefore deciding to shorten the student’s day, the IEP team must consider if there are other \nways to meet the student’s needs. \n \n3. What are inappropriate uses of shortened school day for a student with a disability? \nShortened school day is only appropriate when it is necessary to address the student’s \nunique disability-related needs and enable the child to receive FAPE. The following non-\nexhaustive list provides examples of when shortened school day is not appropriate: \na) Managing Student Behavior as a Means of Discipline \ni)  An  LEA  may  not  reduce  a  student’s  instructional  time  as  a  form  of \npunishment or in lieu of a suspension or an expulsion.  \nii)  Attendance may not be conditioned upon the student’s taking medication or \nreceiving treatment, therapies, or other outside services.  \niii)  In the case of a student whose behavior impedes the student’s learning or \nthat of others, the IEP team must develop an IEP that addresses the student’s \nbehavioral needs. The IEP must include positive behavioral interventions, \n \n\n    158 \nsupports  and  strategies  reasonably  calculated  to  enable  the  student  to \nparticipate in the full school day.  \niv)  School removals are not positive behavioral supports. On August 1, 2016, \nthe  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s  Office  of  Special  Education  and \nRehabilitative Services (OSERS) issued guidance in the form of a Dear \nColleague Letter (DCL)25 emphasizing the requirement that schools provide \npositive behavioral supports to students with disabilities who need them. It \nalso clarifies the repeated use of disciplinary actions may suggest children \nwith disabilities may not be receiving appropriate behavioral interventions \nand  supports.  When  schools  fail  to  consider  and  provide  for  needed \nbehavioral supports through the IEP, it is likely to result in a child not \nreceiving the free appropriate public education to which they are entitled \nunder federal law. \nb) Accommodating Transportation Schedules \ni)  An LEA may not reduce a student’s instructional time by starting the \nstudent’s school day later or releasing the student earlier than non-disabled \npeers to accommodate a transportation schedule.  \nii)  It is not permissible for a school to release students with disabilities earlier \nthan their non-disabled peers to schedule an earlier bus route. Any LEA that \nhas permitted such actions up to now should take immediate steps to correct \nthe resulting denial of equal opportunity of access to education. \nc) Administrative Convenience \ni)  A student’s school day may not be shortened for administrative convenience \nincluding  staffing  shortages.  Student’s  whose  day  is  shortened  due  to \nadministrative convenience may be due compensatory education.   \nii)  LEAs may not develop programs that, by design, only allow students to \nattend a partial day. For example, it is not appropriate to place students with \ndisabilities in programs that only allow them to attend school in the morning \n \n25 https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/files/dcl-on-pbis-in-ieps--08-01-\n2016.pdf \n \n\n    159 \nor afternoon. A student may not be placed on a shorted school day upon \nbeing assigned to a particular program or class.   \niii)  Any  decision  to shorten  a student’s school day must  be  made on  an \nindividual, case-by-case basis by the student’s IEP team. The expectation \nfor all programs and classes is that students will attend a full day. \nd) Accommodating Regularly Scheduled Outside Therapies \nIEP teams may not shorten a student’s school day based solely on a parent’s request \nto  accommodate  regularly  scheduled  non-school  medical  or  therapeutic \nappointments. Instead, when absences are frequent due to outside therapies, the IEP \nteam should meet to determine how to ensure the continued provision of FAPE for \nthe child to continue to progress and meet the annual goals in the IEP. Schools must \nrefer to their local attendance and excusal policies to determine whether absences \nare excused. \n \n4.  Must a school district shorten a student’s school day upon request of the student’s \nparent? \nNo. If a parent requests a change in the length of the student’s school day, the \ndistrict must respond to the parent’s request. However, any changes to the student’s \nplacement, which include deviating from the regular school day schedule, must be \nmade by the student’s IEP team, which includes the parent. The only time it is \nappropriate to shorten the school day for a student with a disability is when the \nstudent’s IEP team determines a shortened day is required to address the student’s \nunique disability-related needs. This decision must be reflected in the student’s IEP, \nincluding documenting the data and reasons for the shortened day, behavior goals \nwithin the IEP (that are linked to the students Behavior Intervention Plan), and \nproviding a plan for returning to a full-day and the parent signed acknowledgement \nbased on SB 263.  \n \n5.  Is parental consent required before placing a child on a shortened school day? \n  Yes. SB 263 prohibits an LEA from unilaterally placing a child on a shortened \nschool day. Parents must agree with the decision and provide written consent for \n \n\n    160 \nthe student to be placed on a shortened school day. By law, Oregon requires parents \nto consent to a shortened school day when this is proposed by an IEP team. If a \nparent does not consent, the IEP team must propose a different placement that will \noffer the student FAPE.   \n \n6.  When parents and the LEA agree to shorten a student’s school day, what must the \nstudent’s IEP include? \n1)  The IEP team must provide documentation that it followed the guidelines \nin Appendix W and decision-tree Appendix Z for placing a student on a shortened \nschool day due to behavior challenges; \n2)  an  explanation  of  why  the  student’s  disability-related  needs  require  a \nshortened day; and \n3)  a plan for the student’s return to school for a full day, including a plan to \nregularly meet on an established timeline to review student data and determine \nwhether the student can return to school full-time or to increase the student’s time \nat school. \n \n7.  How long may an IEP team place a child on a shortened school day? \ni)  The student should return to a full school day as soon as he or she is able, \nand under all but the rarest circumstances, a shortened school day should be \nin place for only a limited amount of time.  \nii)  All students who are on placed a shortened-school day for more than 30 \nschool days or 6 calendar weeks (whichever comes first) must be reported \nto ODE.  \niii)  The IEP team must meet as often as necessary to review the plan and to \ndetermine when the student is able to return to school full-time. A meeting \nevery 4 to 6 weeks is recommended for most students on a shortened school \nday.   \n \n8.  What resources and supports are there to help school districts and IEP teams with a \nstudent with challenging behaviors before considering a shortened-day school program? \n \n\n    161 \nODE has several different synchronous and asynchronous trainings available for \nadministrators and special education and support staff which cover the guidelines \nfor completing an FBA and BIP and which discuss the procedures and decision \nprocess the IEP team  needs to follow for addressing a student’s challenging \nbehaviors. The District Support Specialists also need to provide support as does the \nrecommended intensive interagency support team. If the student requires additional \nsupports not available in the district, the district should contact ODE for assistance \nin obtaining the necessary supports.  \n \n9.  Is shortening a student#s school day in the student#s IEP a change in placement?   \nYes. Shortening a student’s school day is a change in placement, as it alters the \neducational  program  offered  to  the  student.  If  the  IEP  team  is  considering \nshortening the student’s day due to challenging behaviors, then they would follow \nthe decision-tree and utilize the guidelines provided by ODE for determining if and \nwhy that student needs a shortened school day. This decision must be made through \nthe IEP team process, and parents must consent to the change of placement.  \n \n10.  Must districts document a student#s shortened school days when the decision is not made \nby the IEP team? \nYes. Districts need to collect data on the days a student is administratively placed on a \nshortened school day informally (i.e., calling a parent to pick up child from school) and \nformally (i.e., an agreement has been made that child will come to school at a certain time \nand leave school at a certain time) to document the amount of time removed. Once a child \nhas missed ten school days, or portions of ten school days, due to formal or informal \nremovals, the LEA must determine if there is a pattern that constitutes a change of \nplacement such that a Manifestation Determination Review (MDR) is necessary. \n \n11.   What is the process for how a student can be placed on a shortened school day? \nShortening a student’s school day is a decision that must be made through the IEP team \nprocess. As part of the discussion, the IEP should discuss and answer the following \nquestions: \n \n\n    162 \na)  What skill is the student lacking to successfully attend the full school day and what \nspecific instructional steps are being put in place to address this skill deficit and \nenable the child to return to a full day? \nb) How will removal from school meet the student’s educational needs? How will \nremoval from school help close the skill gap? How will removal from school result \nin educational progress? \nc)  What services will the team provide to help close the skill gap and educate the \nstudent in the least restrictive environment, assist the student to be successful in \nschool the entire day, and make progress in the general education curriculum? \nd) What is the plan, including a timeline, to return the student to a full day of school? \nA school district may not require a student with a disability-related behavior to \n“earn” back the right to return to a longer or full school day by demonstrating good \nbehavior.  \ne)  Has the IEP team developed an IEP addressing the student’s behavioral needs \nthrough a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA), Behavior Intervention Plan, \nannual goals, related services, and supplementary aides and services? \nf)  Do the IEP and BIP include positive behavioral interventions, supports, skill \nacquisition, and strategies to enable the student to participate in the full school day? \n \n12.  How should a shortened school day be documented in the student’s IEP? \nThe  IEP  team  has  several  options  as  to  which  section  of  the  IEP  to  include  this \ndocumentation and specify why the unique disability-related needs of the child require a \nshortened day: \na)  There must be a comprehensive FBA and BIP which reflects the student’s skill \nstrengths, deficits, and behavior challenges with a clear link to the reasons that a \nshortened school day is needed to address those deficits and challenges. \nb) The IEP must include a Step-Up Plan for returning the student to a full-day as soon \nas the student is able and describe the frequency and proposed schedule for the \nteam to meet and discuss the plan to return the student to a regular school day. \nc)  The IEP and BIP should include goals and/or services designed to address the \ndisability-related  behavioral  needs  that  resulted  in  a  decision  to  shorten  the \nstudent’s school day.  \n \n\n    163 \nd) The IEP must include a clear description of the special education, related services, \nand  supplementary  aids  and  services  to  be  provided  including  the  amount, \nfrequency, location, and duration of services. \ne)  The IEP should clearly indicate the student is on a shortened school day and include \nthe specific hours/minutes that the school attends school and the calculation of time \nin general education must be based on a full school day, not on the student’s \nshortened day.  \n \n13.  After an IEP team has implemented a shortened school day for a student, what obligation \ndoes the school district have to monitor the shortened day program? \nSchool districts, through the IEP team process, should continuously monitor and \nreview the student’s progress and plan frequent IEP team meetings to determine \nwhether a shortened school day continues to be necessary to meet the student’s \nunique, disability-related needs. The student should return to a full day as soon as \nhe or she is able, and under most circumstances, a shortened day should be in place \nfor only a limited amount of time. If the student is placed on a shortened school day \nfor 30 days or more, the district must immediately report this to the ODE. \n \n14.  What are the obligations of the school district to provide services to students receiving a \nshortened-school day? \nAll students are entitled to receive education for a full school day. If, however, the \nIEP team determines the student requires a shortened school day, the district needs \nto document how the missed schooling will be provided to the student. For example, \nif the student can only attend school through to lunch, the IEP team should meet \nand determine the appropriate methods for the student to receive the afternoon \ninstruction.  IEP  teams  may  consider  technological  options  such  as  web \nconferencing, distance learning, video conferencing, and virtual classrooms to \nconnect students to the classroom and schools, when appropriate, to provide access \nto teachers, peers, and provide additional participation and learning opportunities. \nThe method of additional instruction should be documented in the student’s IEP. \n \n \n \n\n    164 \n15.  What are the obligations of the school district to inform parents of their rights regarding \nthe use of shortened school day? \nIt is the school board's responsibility to adopt written policies related to the use of \nshortened school day and distribute these yearly to parents. These policies must \nadopt or align with the guidance provided by ODE and include the following: \na)  The district's responsibilities to document informal and formal removals and \nconduct an MDR as appropriate; \nb) The IEP team#s duty to discuss the implications to the student of being \nplaced on shortened school day, develop a Step-Up Plan, and regularly meet \nto review the plan; \nc)  The  necessity  of  parental  consent  prior  to  a  student  being  placed  on \nshortened school day; and \nd) A description of the instructional services that will be provided to students \nplaced on shortened school day. \n \n16.  If a shortened school day is no longer necessary for a student, what steps must a district \ntake to return the student to a full day? \nIf a shortened school day is no longer necessary, the school district must conduct an IEP team \nmeeting to return the student to a full school day. The IEP team must also review the student’s \nIEP to ensure that it reflects a full-day program with the requisite services and supports needed \nfor the student’s individualized needs. A copy of the revised IEP and notice of full-day \nplacement must be provided to the parent. \n \n17. What can be done if there is a disagreement within the IEP team’s regarding whether to \nimplement a shortened school day? \nEither party may elect to participate in mediation to resolve the dispute. Mediation is a \nvoluntary  process  conducted  by  a  trained,  neutral  mediator  who  helps  facilitate \ndiscussion and assists parties in reaching a resolution. Federal law requires schools to \nprovide free mediation for disputes about IEPs or special education. Parents are allowed \nto bring a lawyer or others to mediation, but may need to pay for those individual \nservices. Either party may also file a special education complaint with the Oregon \n \n\n    165 \nDepartment of Education. The complaint must be in writing, signed, and submitted \nwithin one year of the decision to shorten the school day. \n \n18.  What are the responsibilities of local districts who contact a parent to remove a child \nduring the course of a school day, outside of an IEP team decision? \nThere may be instances where an administrator determines that a child eligible for \nspecial education and related services needs to be removed from school and contacts \nthe parents or guardians and asks for them to pick the child up early from school. In \nthese instances, these removals should be counted as suspensions and should be \ndocumented as suspensions due to behavior challenges. The number of days a student \ncan be removed due to a suspension is clearly limited by federal and state regulations. \n \n19.  What are the reporting requirements for school districts to the Oregon Department of \nEducation regarding students with disabilities placed on shortened school days? \nAll students with disabilities who are on a shortened school day for more than 30 school \ndays must be reported to the Oregon Department of Education. As a part of this \nreporting, the school district should justify its decision for the shortened school day \nwith the required documentation. ODE will monitor the number of students placed on \na shortened school day. For additional guidance, please see the attached decision tree \nand guidelines for shortened school days for students due to behavior challenges.  \n \n20.  What is the process if there is an urgent need for services that are not available? \nA school district may provide instruction to students eligible for special education on a \nshortened school day for a total of 30-school days without consulting or notifying ODE. \nThe reasons for allowing a student to receive a shortened school day in lieu of being \nphysically present at school should be defined by as mental, physical, or other urgent \nreasons.  \nExtensions \n1)  Following the initial 30-school days, the district must request and receive an \nextension from ODE to allow a student to continue being excused from school \nattendance and to provide instruction to students on a shortened school day. \n \n\n    166 \n2)  ODE should not act on any request for an extension until the initial 30-school \ndays has expired, with ODE acting on the request within one week. When an \nextension is requested, ODE should require that a licensed practitioner submit \nto the school district an updated examination and extension request within two \nweeks of the impending extension. \n3)  If an extension is not granted by ODE, the student must return to school. \n21.  What is the Difference Between Instruction Conducted in the Home versus Homebound \nInstruction? \nInstruction Conducted in the Home should not be confused with \"Homebound \nInstruction,\" which describes the instruction a LEA may provide when a student \nhas been excused from compulsory attendance due to temporary mental or physical \nillness or other urgent reasons. The most important difference between Instruction \nConducted in the Home and Homebound Instruction is that Homebound Instruction \nis NOT a special education placement while Instruction Conducted in the Home is \na placement made by the IEP Team. Formal definitions for each are below. \n22.  What happens when the school district reports to ODE about a student reaching 30 \nshortened school days? \nIf the school district has not already reached out for assistance from the Intensive \nInteragency Support Team, ODE will initiate the involvement of the Intensive \nInteragency Support Team to contact the school district. See Interagency Support \nTeam Description. This team will meet with the IEP team to review the student’s \nIEP, FBA, BIP and Step-Up plan. They will assist the team in determining if there \nare further resources that the team needs to assist the child in skill acquisition and/or \ndecreasing challenging behaviors (i.e., staff training, further assessment, additional \nstaff, etc.). They will continue to meet (virtually or in person) with the IEP team on \na regular basis until the student has resumed a full-day school program.  \n!  \n \n\n    167 \nAppendix W \n \nRecommended IEP Team Statement \n \n \nABBREVIATED SCHOOL DAY NOTICE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NOTICE TO \nPARENT/GUARDIAN OR FOSTER PARENT \n \nOregon law requires that if a student is placed on an abbreviated (shortened) school day program, school \ndistricts must then provide parents/guardians or foster parents with the notice below and also obtain a \nsigned parent/guardian or foster parent acknowledgement of receiving the notice. This must occur at least \nonce every month. A copy of the state law [SB 263] should be included along with this notice. \n \nNotice is hereby given that the school district’s responsibilities include the following: \n1.  The school district may not unilaterally place26 a student on an abbreviated (shortened) school \nday program,27 regardless of the age of the student. \n2.  A school district may provide an abbreviated school day program to a student with an \nindividualized education program (“IEP”) OR a foster youth28 only if all of the following actions \nare taken: \na.  The opportunity for the student’s parent, guardian, or foster youth parent to meaningfully \nparticipate in any and all meetings (IEP team meeting for student with an IEP) to discuss \nthe change of placement to abbreviated school day program, including the reasonable \nopportunity to  \ni.  physically attend the meeting and  \nii.  express ideas, suggestions and concerns \niii.  bring an advocate or other educational or behavior expert  \n \n26 !Unilaterally place” means a placement by a school district without the consent of the student\"s parent, or, if the \nstudent is a foster youth, without the consent of the student\"s foster parent and, if the student has a surrogate as \ndefined in ORS 419A.004, the consent of the surrogate. \n27 !Abbreviated school day program” means an education program in which a school district restricts a student\"s \naccess to hours of instruction or educational services; and that results in a student having an abbreviated school day \nfor more than 10 school days per school year. \n28 “Foster youth” means a child or ward who is in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services as \nprovided in ORS 418.015 or 419B.337 and who has been placed in substitute care. \n \n\n    168 \nb.

Has identified a form for tracking the total number of hours the student will be missing as \na part of the abbreviated school day program. \nk.  Has identified how the hours of lost instruction due to the abbreviated school day \nprogram will be made up (compensatory education). \n \nEach student has a presumptive right to receive the same number of hours of instruction or educational \nservices as other students who are in the same grade within the same school. \nFor parents/guardians or foster parents of students with IEPs, parents/guardians or foster parents have the \nright to request, at any time, a meeting of the IEP team to determine whether the student should no longer \nbe placed on an abbreviated school day program. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nI have received the information described above regarding the school district’s obligations surrounding \nabbreviated (shortened) school day programs. I am also aware of my student’s presumptive right to \nreceive the same number of hours of instruction or educational services, at the school site, as other \nstudents who are in the same grade within the same school. \n \n\n    169 \n \nParent/Guardian or Foster Parent Printed Name: _____________________________________________  \nParent/Guardian or Foster Parent Signature: _______________________ Date: ____________________!\n \n\n    170 \nAppendix X \n \nSample Redacted IEP \n \n \n!  \n \n\n    171 \n \n \n \n \n!  \n \n\n    172 \nAppendix Y \n \nJune 16, 2022 State Board Guidance \n \n581-015-2015 General Supervision (Proposed Replacement for Compliance Monitoring OAR)  \n(1)  \"General Supervision” means a system that enables the Department to ensure that the \nrequirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Oregon Revised Statutes, \nand Oregon Administrative Rules are being effectively implemented by school districts and \nprograms to produce both results for children and students with disabilities and compliance \nwith legal and regulatory requirements.  \n(2)  The requirements described in this rule apply to each school district or program involved in \nthe education of children or students with disabilities.  \n(3)  School districts and programs involved in the education of children or students with \ndisabilities shall undertake activities of General Supervision as directed by the Department, \nincluding but not limited to, the following activities:  \n(a)  Development and review of policies and procedures that document compliance with \nthe requirements in IDEA;  \n(b)  Collection, validation, and submission of data on processes and results;  \n(c)  Integrated monitoring activities, including but not limited to, district and program \nself-assessment, data collection, analysis and reporting, on-site visits, review of \npolicies and procedures, review of the development and implementation of IEPs \nand IFSPs, improvement planning, corrective action, and auditing federal fund use;  \n(d)  Participation in effective dispute resolution including but not limited to mediation \nas described in OAR 581-015-2335, due process hearings as described in OAR 581-\n015-2345, and state complaints as described in OAR 581-015-2030;   \n(e)  Compliance with any corrective actions required through State complaints and due \nprocess decisions; and  \n(f)  Participation in universal, targeted, and intensive technical assistance and \nprofessional development.  \n(4)  The Department may provide, or make available the provision of, universal, targeted, and \nintensive technical assistance, coaching, and professional development to support district \nand program capacity to meet general supervision requirements.  \n(5)  The Department shall notify any school district or program of any noncompliance \nidentified through the General Supervision system, in writing, within three months of its \nidentification. This notification shall include any required corrective action to be completed \nby the district or program and the timeline within which corrective action must be \ncompleted.  \n(6)  Notwithstanding section (5) above, the Department shall notify any school district or \nprogram of any noncompliance identified through the General Supervision system within \n30 days of its identification when the Department determines that the noncompliance could \ncause a student to be denied 10 or more instructional days consecutively or cumulatively \nwithin any one school year, as compared to the majority of general education students who \nare in the same grade within the attending school district or program. This notification shall \n \n\n    173 \ninclude any required corrective action to be completed by the district or program and the \ntimeline within which corrective action must be completed.  \n(7)  In determining the corrective action the school district or program must complete, the \nDepartment may consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to whether the \nnoncompliance:  \n(a)  Was extensive or found in only a small percentage of files;  \n(b)  Resulted in the denial of free appropriate public education, parent participation, or \nplacement in the least restrictive environment as required by the IDEA; and/or  \n(c)  Represents an isolated incident in the school district or program, or reflects a \nlongstanding failure to meet IDEA requirements.  \n(8)  When a school district or program is notified of noncompliance, the school district or \nprogram must correct the noncompliance, including completing any corrective action \nrequired by the Department, as soon as possible, and in no case later than one year after it \nwas identified.  \n(9)  Notwithstanding section (8) above, identified noncompliance must be corrected as soon as \npossible, and in no case later than 60 days after it was identified when the Department \ndetermines that the noncompliance could cause a student to be denied 10 or more \ninstructional days consecutively or cumulatively within any one school year, as compared \nto the majority of general education students who are in the same grade within the \nattending school district or program.  \n(10)  To demonstrate that the school district or program has corrected the noncompliance \nidentified by the Department, a school district or program must:  \n(a)  Correct each individual case of noncompliance, unless the child or student is no \nlonger within the jurisdiction of the school district or program;  \n(b)  Implement changes to policies, procedures, and/or practices that contributed to or \nresulted in the identified noncompliance, if needed; and   \n(c)  Submit updated data as required by the Department to document that the school \ndistrict or program is correctly implementing the specific regulatory requirements \nrelated to the identified noncompliance.  \n(11)  The Department will verify correction of noncompliance based on evidence according to \nsubsection (10) above, notify school districts and programs regarding correction status, and \nmay require further action from school districts or programs based on the Department#s \ndetermination.  \n(12)  School districts and programs that do not complete corrective actions and correct \nnoncompliance may be subjected to enforcement mechanisms, including but not limited to \nadditional reporting requirements, technical assistance, a corrective action plan or \nimprovement plan, and conditions on funding, and/or withholding funds, in whole or in \npart, by the Department.  \n(13)  The Department shall make determinations annually about the performance of each local \neducation agency consistent with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act at 34 C.F.R. § 300.600(a)(2).  \nStatutory/Other Authority: ORS 343.041, 343.045 & 343.055  \nStatutes/Other Implemented: ORS 343.041 & 343.055 History:  \nRenumbered from 581-015-0048, ODE 10-2007, f. & cert. ef. 4-25-07  \n \n\n    174 \nODE 2-2003, f. & cert. ef. 3-10-03  \nEB 11-1995, f. & cert. ef. 5-25-95 EB 6-1993, f. & cert. ef. 2-11-93  \n1EB 15-1983, f. 11-23-83, ef. 11-25-83!  \n \n\n    175 \nAppendix Z \n \nDecision Tree \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Introduction\na. The parties wish to settle J.N. et al. v. Oregon Department of Education et al.,\nUnited States District Court for the District of Oregon, Portland Division,\nNo. 6:19-cv-00096-AA (the “Action”).\nb. Plaintiffs are J.N., by and through his next friend, T.S.; E.O., by and through his\nnext friend, Alisha Overstreet; J.V. by and through his next friend, Sarah\nKaplansky; B.M., by and through his next friend, Traci Modugno, and the\nCouncil of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc. (COPAA).\nc. A class has been certified in the Action comprised of all students with disabilities\naged 3 to 21 residing in Oregon who are eligible for special education and related\nservices under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400\net seq. (IDEA), and are currently being subjected to a shortened school day or are\nat substantial risk of being subjected to a shortened school day due to their\ndisability-related behaviors.\nd. Defendants are the Oregon Department of Education (ODE), Colt Gill, in his\nofficial capacities as Director of ODE and Deputy Superintendent of Public\nInstruction for the State of Oregon, and Katherine Brown, in her official\ncapacities as Governor and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of\nOregon.\ne. This Interim Settlement Agreement (Interim Agreement) is not a final settlement\nof plaintiffs’ claims asserted in the Action.\nf. Defendants dispute the allegations against them in the Action.  This Interim\nAgreement is not an admission of liability, and defendants deny the allegations in\nthe Action.\ng. The parties represent and acknowledge that this Interim Agreement is the result of\nextensive, thorough, and good faith negotiations.  The parties further represent\nand acknowledge that the terms of this Interim Agreement have been voluntarily\naccepted, after consultation with counsel, for the purpose of making this Interim\nAgreement.\nh. The Court has jurisdiction over the Action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Venue\nis proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\ni. This Interim Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with federal law and the\nlaws of the State of Oregon.  The venue for all legal actions concerning this\nInterim Agreement will be in the United States District Court for the District of\nOregon, Portland Division (the “Court”).\nPage 1 of 9 \n\n2.   Definitions \nFor the purposes of this Interim Agreement, the following definitions apply: \na. “ADA” means Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 \net seq., and its implementing regulations. \nb. “Effective Date” means the date on which this Interim Agreement has been fully \nexecuted by all parties. \nc. “IDEA” means the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 \net seq., and its implementing regulations.  \nd. “FAPE” means a free appropriate public education within the meaning of the \nIDEA.  \ne. “FERPA” means the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1232g, and its implementing regulations. \nf. “LEA” means local education agencies which provide educational services \ndirectly to students. \ng. “LRE” means least restrictive environment within the meaning of the IDEA.  \nh. “Section 504” means Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and \nits implementing regulations. \ni. “Shortened School Day” refers to any school day during which a student within \nthe Target Population receives instruction or educational services in school for \nfewer hours than other students who are in the same grade within the same school. \nj. “Target Population” refers to the certified class for the lawsuit (i.e., “all students \nwith disabilities aged 3 to 21 residing in Oregon who are eligible for special \neducation and related services under the IDEA and are currently being subjected \nto a shortened school day or are at substantial risk of being subjected to a \nshortened school day due to their disability-related behavior”). \n3.  Phased Approach to Resolution of the Action \nThe parties share the goal of ensuring that LEAs provide all Oregon school children with \na FAPE in the LRE that is free from discrimination.  To achieve this shared goal, the parties \nagree to a two-phased approach to resolve the Action: (1) fact-finding by a Neutral Expert \nregarding the use of Shortened School Days for the Target Population in Oregon and preparation \nof a report with the Neutral Expert’s findings and recommendations (“Phase I”); and (2) \nfollowing completion of Phase I, negotiation of appropriate remedies (if any) for any identified \nsystemic misuse (if any) of Shortened School Days for the Target Population during a continued \nsettlement conference with Judge Acosta (“Phase II”).   \nPage 2 of 9 \n\n4.  Retention of Neutral Expert\nAs noted above, the parties agree that fact-finding regarding the alleged systemic misuse \nof Shortened School Days for the Target Population in Oregon public schools is needed to \ninform what (if any) remedies are needed to achieve the parties’ shared goal that LEAs provide \nOregon school children with a FAPE in the LRE that is free from discrimination.  \nFor purposes of Phase I, through the Oregon Department of Justice and the Department \nof Administrative Services, ODE shall retain the services of a mutually acceptable Neutral \nExpert with substantial experience in evaluating or assisting states and/or school districts in \ncomplying with the IDEA, the ADA, and Section 504. \nTo select the Neutral Expert, the parties will choose up to four individuals to be jointly \ninterviewed by ODE and counsel for the parties and then jointly select the appropriate Neutral \nExpert as expeditiously as possible but not later than 28 days after the Effective Date; such time \nperiod may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties or pursuant to an extension granted \nby Judge Acosta. If the parties cannot agree on the four individuals for interviews, each party \nwill choose up to two individuals to be interviewed. The parties further agree that if they are \nunable to agree on a Neutral Expert within that time period (including any extensions), each \nparty shall, within 7 days of the end of that time period (including any extensions), submit to \nJudge Acosta their nominee(s), preferred choice, and rationale, and he will select the Neutral \nExpert from those lists pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 706(a), whose compensation would be paid by \nthe State pursuant to Part 6 below.  The deadline for submission to Judge Acosta may be \nextended by mutual agreement of the parties or pursuant to an extension granted by Judge \nAcosta. \nIf the retained Neutral Expert becomes unavailable, a replacement Neutral Expert will be \nselected by mutual agreement of the parties. Within 30 days of learning of the retained Neutral \nExpert’s unavailability, ODE will identify its preferred candidate to plaintiffs by giving written \nnotice to plaintiffs’ counsel.  If, within 14 days of ODE’s identification, plaintiffs disapprove of \nor fail to respond to the ODE’s selection, counsel for the parties shall convene a telephone \nconference to discuss other possible candidates and determine whether they can agree on a \ncandidate.   \nIf the parties are unable to agree on the selection of a replacement Neutral Expert after \nfollowing the procedure outlined herein, then no later than seven (7) days after the telephone \nconference of counsel, each party will submit to Judge Acosta a list of up to two nominees and \nJudge Acosta will select the Neutral Expert pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 706(a), whose \ncompensation would be paid by the State pursuant to Part 6 below.  Each nominating party must \nidentify and describe each nominee’s qualifications and experience.   \nIf a replacement Neutral Expert is selected, to prevent duplicative costs, the replacement \nNeutral Expert will not be required or permitted to repeat the work already performed, except for \ngood cause shown.  \nPage 3 of 9 \n\n5. Scope of the Neutral Expert’s Work in Phase I \nPhase I is intended to be a statewide evaluation regarding the use of Shortened School \nDays to inform negotiations over remedies, if warranted, in Phase II.  The scope of the Neutral \nExpert’s work in Phase I is as follows:  \na.    Determine the sources of information from which to gather evidence regarding  \nuse of Shortened School Days for the Target Population.  These sources of \ninformation could include (but would not be limited to): \ni. Records and data in ODE’s possession relevant to Shortened School Day \nplacements for the Target Population;  \nii. State and district statutes, policies, guidelines, processes, and procedures \nrelevant to Shortened School Day placements for the Target Population;  \niii. Student-level state and district data relevant to Shortened School Day \nplacements for the Target Population;  \niv. Interviews regarding Shortened School Day placements for the Target \nPopulation with individuals and/or focused groups of state and district staff, \nstudents, parents, guardians, various advisory committees, parent \norganizations, subject-matter experts, and counsel for the parties;  \nv. Targeted site visits to review individual student files and make classroom \nobservations for information related to Shortened School Day placements \nfor the Target Population. \nb.    Gather information from the sources identified in (a) or otherwise determined  \nrelevant by the Neutral Expert through data collection, document review, and \ninterviews needed to understand the data.  The time period for the data collection \nshall be from the 2017-2018 school year to the present, except to the extent the \nNeutral Expert determines that obtaining data from earlier school years is \nappropriate.  The information gathering shall be completed within three (3) \nmonths after retention of the Neutral Expert; such time period may be extended \nby mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, pursuant to an \nextension granted by Judge Acosta.   \nc.    Identify the conditions under which Shortened School Days are used due to  \ndisability-related behavior (i.e., where, when, why, how long) for the Target \nPopulation. Plaintiffs and ODE will each supply the Neutral Expert with a \nchecklist of essential data elements to be gathered in connection with uses of \nShortened School Days to assist the parties in determining the appropriateness of \nthe uses of Shortened School Days. The checklists may be modified by the \nNeutral Expert as appropriate after consulting with the parties. \nPage 4 of 9 \n\nd. Identify and examine the root cause(s) at the state and/or district level of the use \nof Shortened School Days due to disability-related behaviors for the Target \nPopulation. \ne.    Synthesize information collected above and describe the magnitude and scope of  \nthe use of Shortened School Days for the Target Population, including: (i) the \nnumber of students in the Target Population placed on Shortened School Days \ndue to disability-related behaviors; (ii) the length of time that those students are \nplaced on Shortened School Days; (iii) whether the students’ placements on \nShortened School Days were revisited after any specified period and, if so, what \ntime period; (iv) differences in utilization of Shortened School Days for the \nmembers of the Target Population based on district type or student demographics; \nand (v) descriptive statistics and information related to the time and location of \nservices received by students in the Target Population. \nf.    Identify uses of Shortened School Days for the Target Population that potentially  \nfail to meet the requirements of federal law—namely, the IDEA, the ADA, and/or \nSection 504—and also identify where districts are implementing positive \npractices with respect to serving the Target Population and/or reducing \ninappropriate uses of Shortened School Days.  Nothing in this section allows the \nNeutral Expert to inquire into any potential violations of the IDEA, the ADA \nand/or Section 504 unrelated to the use of Shortened School Days for the Target \nPopulation. \ng.    Prepare a report describing the Neutral Expert’s sources used and findings relative  \nto (a)-(f) above and, if any, advisory recommendations for Phase II to address the \nexistence of Shortened School Days that potentially fail to meet the requirements \nof federal law.  To the extent the Neutral Expert determines sharing a draft report \nwith the parties for comment is appropriate, the Neutral Expert may do so prior to \nreleasing the report. The report shall be completed within six (6) months after \nretention of the Neutral Expert; such time period may be extended by mutual \nagreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, pursuant to an extension \ngranted by Judge Acosta.  The report shall be admissible as evidence in any court \nof law.  The report shall not be considered confidential; to the extent any details \nof the report are required to remain confidential under federal law, including \nIDEA and FERPA, to protect the privacy of individually identifiable students, the \nparties will prepare a version of the report that redacts only those details and that \ncan be available to the public.    \nThe report may include, if appropriate, recommendations for the creation of new \nprograms, hiring of new staff, contracting for services, developing new training \nsystems, redirection of existing resources, or any other possible remedies, \nincluding recommending changes to state policies, statutes, or rules. The report \nmay also include, if appropriate, recommendations for using existing programs, \nfacilities, and staff to the extent those existing resources are adequate. The report \nmay also recommend making no changes. Within the report, the Neutral Expert \nshall include their rationale to support each recommendation. \nPage 5 of 9 \n\nh.    The Neutral Expert will have monthly joint phone conferences with the parties  \nand their counsel to report on progress and the parties will provide feedback to the \nNeutral Expert to ensure that the evaluation is progressing in accordance with the \nscope of work.  The parties may communicate any additional information to the \nNeutral Expert at any time during the evaluation period.  \ni.    Upon request of the Neutral Expert, the parties will assist the Neutral Expert in  \nobtaining access to the sources of information as described in (a) and (b) above \nand ODE will provide sufficient administrative support to perform the duties \ndescribed in (a)-(g) above. \n6. Duration of the Neutral Expert’s Work and Compensation.  \nThe Neutral Expert shall be retained at least through the completion of Phase I and may \nbe retained in some role as part of Phase II subject to agreement by the parties.   \nFor work during Phase I, the Neutral Expert shall be reimbursed by the State up to a \nmaximum of $300,000 (including the Neutral Expert’s fee for all work performed by the Neutral \nExpert or anyone employed by the Neutral Expert), as well as all allowable expenses, such as \ntravel costs.     \nIf the State contracts with the Neutral Expert to begin to perform the duties outlined \nherein before the Effective Date, the time spent by the Neutral Expert on that work and the \namount spent to reimburse the Neutral Expert for that work shall count towards the expense cap.   \nPhase I shall be complete upon submission of the Neutral Expert’s report to the parties.   \n7. Transition to Phase II \nWithin five (5) business days after completion of Phase I, the parties shall commence \nPhase II by jointly contacting Judge Acosta to schedule date(s) for a continued settlement \nconference to negotiate remedies (if any).  Judge Acosta will then notify the Court that the \nsettlement conference is continuing and the stay should remain in effect until any party decides \n(after engaging in good faith discussions in continued settlement conferences during the first 60 \ndays of Phase II) to return to active litigation.  In that event, Judge Acosta will notify the Court \nthat the stay should be lifted.  \n8. Dispute Resolution and Enforcement \nAny allegation of an act or omission in breach of this Interim Agreement may be raised \nby either party through the dispute resolution process in this Section.  Each party will provide \nwritten notice to the opposing party of any alleged non-compliance.  The opposing party shall \nhave 21 days to provide a response and/or proposed solution.  During this time period, the parties \nshall work to resolve the dispute.  If the parties cannot resolve their dispute within this time \nperiod, any party may bring the matter to Judge Acosta for resolution. Judge Acosta’s rulings \nunder this Section shall be made in writing and will be final and not subject to appeal.  \nPage 6 of 9 \n\nIf, during Phase I or Phase II, Judge Acosta is not available, then Judge Stacie Beckerman \nwill be responsible for fulfilling Judge Acosta’s functions under this Interim Agreement. If Judge \nBeckerman is not available, then Judge Mustafa Kasubhai shall be responsible for fulfilling \nJudge Acosta’s functions.  If Judge Kasubhai is not available, then the parties will select a \nmutually-agreeable judge to fulfill Judge Acosta’s functions.     \n9.    Stay, Effective Period, and Preservation of Rights  \nWithin seven (7) days of the execution of this Interim Agreement by all parties, Judge \nAcosta will propose to the Court a stay of all proceedings in the Action so the parties can focus \non a comprehensive settlement that will result in a final settlement of the Action. \nPlaintiffs and ODE preserve all rights to seek or oppose a more comprehensive \nsettlement. Nothing in this Interim Agreement ends or prejudices a party’s right to assert other \npositions, assert any preserved claim or defense, or to seek or oppose additional relief in \nsettlement negotiations or in the Action.   \nThis Interim Agreement will terminate 60 days after commencement of Phase II as \ndescribed herein, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties.  Either party may restart \nthe proceedings in the Action only after engaging in good faith discussions in continued \nsettlement conferences during the first 60 days of Phase II.   \n10.    No Admission of Fault \nIn entering into this Agreement, ODE does not admit any wrongdoing or liability to \nplaintiffs, or any entitlement by plaintiffs to any relief under any claim upon which relief is \nsought in their complaint in this or any other matter.  Inclusion of obligations in this Interim \nAgreement shall not be construed as a finding or determination by the Court that, absent this \nInterim Agreement, ODE would otherwise have such obligations or requirements.   \n11. Force Majeure \nODE shall not be considered in breach of this Interim Agreement to the extent that \nperformance of any of the obligations incurred herein is prevented by an event of Force Majeure, \nincluding but not limited to: acts of God (such as, but not limited to, fires, explosions, \nearthquakes, drought, tidal waves, and floods); war, hostilities, invasion, act of foreign enemies, \nrebellion, revolution, insurrection, or military or usurped power, or civil war; contamination by \nradioactivity from any nuclear fuel, or from any nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear \nfuel, radioactive toxic explosive, or other hazardous properties of any explosive nuclear \nassembly or nuclear component of such assembly; riot, commotion, strikes, lock outs or disorder; \nor acts or threats of terrorism. \n12.    Funding \nNothing in this Agreement will be construed as permitting any violation of Article XI, \nSection 7 of the Oregon Constitution or any other law regulating liabilities or monetary \nobligations of the State of Oregon.  ODE will make diligent efforts to obtain necessary funding, \nappropriations, limitations, allotments, or other expenditure authority.  \nPage 7 of 9 \n\n13.
