    "summary": "<p>This case is about the federal law enforcement mission, &ldquo;Operation Diligent Valor,&rdquo; directed by the Department of Homeland Security against protestors during the widespread racial justice protests in Portland, Oregon in the summer of 2020. Individual Oregon residents along with Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice, Inc. brought this lawsuit on August 26, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against President Donald Trump, Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, the Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, as well as unlawful action exceeding authority by federal agencies under 40 U.S.C &sect; 1315. Plaintiffs also raised claims under 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1985 and 1986, alleging a conspiracy by the defendants to deprive the plaintiffs of their civil rights. Represented by the ACLU of Oregon and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including declarations that the acts of federal law enforcement agencies were unlawful and ultra vires, as well as expungement of all records and information of unlawful arrests. Plaintiffs also sought compensatory and punitive damages to be proven at trial.</p>\r\n<p>In July 2020, the federal government deployed more than 100 federal law enforcement officers or agents in response to the widespread protests against systemic racial injustice and police violence near the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse in downtown Portland, in which the plaintiffs participated. The plaintiffs alleged that heavily-armed, militarized law enforcement officials indiscriminately used excessive force against protestors and that a number of protestors were unlawfully detained or arrested by federal agents. They asserted that the defendants&rsquo; actions in support of &ldquo;Operation Diligent Valor&rdquo; violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly and their Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. In addition, they claimed that the actions undertaken by federal officials were not legally authorized because Chad Wolf was not properly serving as Acting Secretary of DHS under the requirement of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the deployed officers were not properly designated, and the deployed officers acted outside of the scope of their authority by acting off federal property and making warrantless arrests, among other acts.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Youlee Yim You on August 26, 2020. On January 8, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that maintained the core aspects of the original. On September 13, 2021, Magistrate Judge You issued findings and recommendations advising the court to grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' Bivens and conspiracy claims against the DHS Secretary and Federal Protective Service (FPS) Regional Director. On December 27, 2021, District Judge Michael H. Simon adopted Judge You's findings and recommendations in part. Judge Simon dismissed the Bivens claim against the DHS Secretary, determining that the plaintiff's Bivens claim was novel since the secretary was so far removed from the alleged unconstitutional acts, and that the special factors weighed against recognizing it as a new type of Bivens action. But the court did not dismiss the Bivens claim against the FPS Regional Director because he was personally involved in and directly supervised the alleged unconstitutional acts. Meanwhile, the court accepted Judge You's recommendation to dismiss the counts of conspiracy to violate the plaintiffs' Equal Protection rights by racially discriminating against them, finding that the plaintiffs did not allege sufficient facts to support their allegation that the DHS Secretary's and FPS Regional Director's animus against protestors was racially motivated.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed the district court's December 27, 2021 partial denial of their motions to dismiss to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (22-35183) on February 24, 2022. On February 2, 2023, the Ninth Circuit ultimately reversed the lower court&rsquo;s order denying the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss this case. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that a Bivens cause of action is not available in this case as it factually differs from the Bivens case and this presents a new context. The Court of Appeals suggested that alternative remedies were available to the plaintiffs, such as reporting any alleged misconduct to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the district court, on September 22, 2022, Magistrate Judge Youlee Kim issued findings and recommendations advising the court to grant the defendants&rsquo; series of motions to dismiss and limit the plaintiffs&rsquo; ability to sue the federal agents for monetary damages. In her report, the Judge relied on the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in Egbert v. Boule and stated that this decision foreclosed the plaintiffs from availing themselves of Bivens cause of action for their Fourth Amendment claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. This complaint asserted claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the Plaintiffs asserted FTCA claims for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). One plaintiff also asserted claims for trespass to chattels and false arrest/imprisonment, and another Plaintiff asserted a defamation claim.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 10, 2023, defendants filed a Partial Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs&rsquo; FTCA claims (other than the false arrest/imprisonment claim) should be dismissed. In response, plaintiffs dismissed the trespass to chattels claim and the defamation claim, opposing dismissal as to all other claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2024 Magistrate Judge Youlee Kim issued findings and recommendations regarding the defendants&rsquo; partial motion to dismiss, recommending that the court grant their motion in respect to plaintiffs&rsquo; assault, battery, IIED, and NIED claims. The defendants&rsquo; objected to the report in regards to the recommendations on plaintiffs&rsquo; battery, assault, IIED, and NIED claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2024, plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs sought to add a negligence claim against defendants. This claim alleged that defendants &ldquo;were negligent in their determination and/or authorization of when, whether, and how to deploy force and the amount of force used, in carrying out their use of their force, and/or in taking aim at their intended target(s) when they&rdquo; struck Plaintiffs. &nbsp;Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that this negligence claim should be dismissed because the FTCA has a discretionary function exception which precludes exercise of jurisdiction over the claims, and that the plaintiffs failed to state a negligence claim as their claim was premised on alleged intentional conduct.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice. On the same day, the court dismissed the case with prejudice, and each party bore their own costs and attorney&rsquo;s fees. The case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

RUSSELL    3 \nSUMMARY* \n \nCivil Rights \n \nReversing the district courtโs order denying defendantโs \nmotion to dismiss, the panel held that Bivens v. Six Unknown \nNamed Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. \n388 (1971), did not provide a cause of action for protesters \nwho alleged that Gabriel Russell, then the Director of the \nFederal Protective Serviceโs Northwest Region, ordered or \nacquiesced in subordinatesโ unlawful arrests and uses of \nexcessive  force  during  protests  outside  the  federal \ncourthouse in Portland, Oregon in the summer of 2020.. \nThe panel first held that it had jurisdiction over this \ninterlocutory  appeal.    The  Supreme  Courtโs  opinion  in \nWilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537 (2007), establishes that, in \nan interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity, \ncourts necessarily have jurisdiction to decide whether an \nunderlying Bivens cause of action exists. \nApplying the two-step analysis set forth in Egbert v. \nBoule, 142 S. Ct. 1793 (2022), the panel held that a Bivens \nremedy  could  not  be  extended  to  this  case  because  it \npresented a new context, and at least two independent factors \nindicated that the court was less equipped than Congress to \ndetermine whether the damages action should proceed.   \nThis case differed from Bivensโthe only Supreme Court \ncase recognizing an implied damages remedy for Fourth \nAmendment  violation  because  (1)  defendant  Gabriel \n \n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

RUSSELL \nRussell, a high-level supervisor, was of a different rank than \nthe agents in Bivens; (2) Russellโs alleged actions, which \nconsisted  of  ordering  or  acquiescing  in  unconstitutional \nconduct, took place at a higher level of generality than the \nactions of the agents in Bivens; and (3) the legal mandate \nunder which Russell acted differed from that of the agents in \nBivens in that Russell was directing a multi-agency operation \nto protect federal property and was carrying out an executive \norder.  And because Russell was carrying out an executive \norder, providing a Bivens remedy in this context would carry \na greater โrisk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into \nthe  functioning  of  other  branchesโ  than  was  present  in \nBivens.  This case also differed from Carlson v. Green, 446 \nU.S. 14 (1980), which involved prison officials and a claim \nof  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  under  the  Eighth \nAmendment.  \nAllowing a Bivens action to proceed in this case could \nexpose sensitive communications between Russell and other \nhigh-level  executive  officers.  Moreover,  Congress  had \nafforded plaintiffs an alternative remedy that independently \nforeclosed a Bivens action.  Because plaintiffs had no cause \nof action under Bivens, the panel did not consider whether \nRussell would be entitled to qualified immunity.  \n \n   \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 5 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V.

RUSSELL \nOPINION \n \nMILLER, Circuit Judge: \nDuring the summer of 2020, Mark Pettibone protested \noutside  the  federal  courthouse  in  Portland,  Oregon.  He \nalleges that federal officers unlawfully arrested protesters \nand  used  excessive  force,  including  by  indiscriminately \nusing tear gas against peaceful protesters. Together with \nother  protesters,  he  brought  this  action  against  Gabriel \nRussell, then the Director of the Federal Protective Serviceโs \nNorthwest Region, under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971). The district court denied Russellโs motion to dismiss. \nWe conclude that no Bivens cause of action is available in \nthis case, and we therefore reverse. \nI \nBecause this is an appeal from an order resolving a \nmotion to dismiss, we assume the truth of the facts alleged \nin  the  complaint.  Ellis  v.  Salt  River  Project  Agric. \nImprovement & Power Dist., 24 F.4th 1262, 1266 (9th Cir. \n2022).  \nFollowing the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis \nin  May  2020,  numerous  protests  took  place  across  the \ncountry, including near the Mark O. Hatfield United States \nCourthouse in Portland. In June 2020, the President issued \nan executive order stating that โ[o]ver the last 5 weeks, there \nhas been a sustained assault on the life and property of \ncivilians,  law  enforcement  officers,  [and]  government \npropertyโ  throughout  the  country  and  attributing  this  to \nโ[a]narchists and left-wing extremists [who] have sought to \nadvance a fringe ideology that paints the United States of \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 7 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    7 \nAmerica as fundamentally unjust and have sought to impose \nthat  ideology  on  Americans  through  violence  and  mob \nintimidation.โ Exec. Order No. 13,933, ยง 1, 85 Fed. Reg. \n40081 (June 26, 2020), revoked, Exec. Order No. 14,029, 86 \nFed. Reg. 27025 (May 14, 2021). The order directed the \nSecretary  of  Defense,  the  Attorney  General,  and  the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to provide โpersonnel to \nassist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, \nstatues, or property.โ Id. ยง 5, 85 Fed. Reg. at 40083. The \nfederal government subsequently deployed more than 100 \nlaw  enforcement  officers  from  Customs  and  Border \nProtection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the \nUnited States Marshals Service to Portland, in what officials \ncalled  โOperation  Diligent  Valor.โ  Russell  oversaw  the \nofficers in Portland. \nPettibone  alleges  that  officers  involved  in  Operation \nDiligent Valor arrested protesters โwithout any lawful basisโ \nand also โindiscriminately used violent tactics on lawful \nprotesters,โ including by โshooting them in the head and \nbody with impact munitions and pepper balls, spraying them \ndirectly in the face with pepper spray, shoving them to the \nground, hitting and beating them with batons, [and] firing \nmassive clouds of tear gas at them.โ Pettibone alleges that \nโ[t]he tactics used by the officers went beyond what was \nrequired  for  their  limited  mission  of  protecting  federal \nproperty and reflected a policy designed to retaliate against \nand  to  deter  the  protesters  because  of  their  views  and \nbeliefs.โ \nThe complaint includes specific allegations of allegedly \nunlawful  conduct  directed  at  individual  plaintiffs.  For \nexample, Pettibone alleges that he was โsnatched off the \nstreet and put in an unmarked van by unidentified men in \nmilitary-style uniforms who did not explain their actions . . . \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 8 of 19\n8  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL \nand held him in jail with no explanation.โ Another plaintiff \nalleges  that  although  he  โwore  distinctive  clothing  that \nidentified him as a member of the press,โ he was injured \nโwhen an unidentified federal officer shot him in the head \nwith an impact munition while he was lawfully attending the \nprotests.โ And another alleges that while โ[s]he merely stood \nin a line of women with arms linked,โ a tear-gas canister was \nโhurled  into  her  head,  causing  a  three-inch  gash  to  her \nforehead.โ \nAlthough Russell did not personally carry out any of the \narrests or uses of force, Pettibone alleges that Russell โknew \nor reasonably should have known that officers . . . would \ncause and were causing the arrests of protesters and the \nrepeated  use  of  excessive  force  against  protesters.โ \nAccording to the complaint, Russell โpersonally observed \nprotesters in Portland and the actions of federal officers from \nan  incident  command  post  or  an  emergency  operations \ncenter,โ  and  he  โmonitored  social  media  and  reviewed \npublicly available videos showing events at the protests.โ \nDespite  Russellโs  awareness  of  officersโ  uses  of  force, \nPettibone alleges, โRussell knowingly failed to order any \nchange in tactics or response to avoid unconstitutional injury \nto peaceful protesters.โ Pettibone also alleges that Russell \nโimplemented tactics that included identifying and arresting \nindividual  protestersโ  and  that  he  directed  the  arrest  of \ncertain protesters, including Pettibone.  \nPettibone brought this action in the District of Oregon \nagainst  various  federal  agencies  and  officers,  including \nRussell. As relevant to this appeal, the complaint asserted \nBivens claims against Russell, alleging that he violated the \nFourth  Amendment.  Russell  moved  to  dismiss  on  the \ngrounds that no Bivens remedy is available and that, even if \nit were, Russell is entitled to qualified immunity. The district \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 9 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    9 \ncourt rejected both arguments and denied the motion.  \nII \nIn this interlocutory appeal, Russellโs principal argument \nis that no Bivens cause of action is available here. The first \nquestion we must confront is whether we have jurisdiction \nto consider that argument. \nWe have appellate jurisdiction over โfinal decisions of \nthe district courts.โ 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. An order denying a \nmotion to dismiss does not end the litigation, and therefore \nit ordinarily is not โfinalโ and is not immediately appealable. \nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. v. Vaughn, 509 F.3d 1085, \n1089 (9th Cir. 2007). But there are exceptions to that general \nrule. Because qualified immunity is โan immunity from suit \nrather than a mere defense to liability,โ the denial of a motion \nto  dismiss  is  effectively  finalโand  thus  immediately \nappealableโwhen  the  motion  to  dismiss  is  based  on \nqualified immunity. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526โ\n27 (1985) (emphasis omitted); see Peck v. Montoya, 51 F.4th \n877, 885 (9th Cir. 2022). \nRussellโs  motion  to  dismiss  asserted  both  qualified \nimmunity and the lack of a Bivens cause of action. Pettibone \nargues that we may consider the Bivens issue only if we have \npendent appellate jurisdiction over itโthat is, only if it is \nโโinextricably  intertwinedโ  with  or  โnecessary  to  ensure \nmeaningful  review  ofโ  decisions  over  which  we  have \n[interlocutory] jurisdiction.โ Meredith v. Oregon, 321 F.3d \n807, 812 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Swint v. Chambers Cnty. \nCommโn, 514 U.S. 35, 51 (1995)); see CDK Global LLC v. \nBrnovich, 16 F.4th 1266, 1273โ74 (9th Cir. 2021). Pettibone \nrelies  on  Wong  v.  United  States,  in  which  we  applied \nprinciples of pendent appellate jurisdiction to decline to \nconsider the availability of a Bivens cause of action in an \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 10 of 19\n10  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL \ninterlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity. 373 \nF.3d  952  (9th  Cir.  2004).  Wong  explained  that  the \navailability  of  a  Bivens  remedy  is  not  โinextricably \nintertwinedโ with the question of qualified immunityโand \ntherefore is not properly before the court in an interlocutory \nappeal  from  a  denial  of  qualified  immunityโbecause \nโ[d]eciding  th[e]  [Bivens]  question  requires  the \nconsideration of entirely distinct legal standards from, and \nits resolution is not a logical predicate to the resolution of, \nthe qualified immunity issue.โ Id. at 961. Pettibone also \ninvokes older cases in which we rejected jurisdiction over \nthe Bivens question as โoutside the limited scope of th[e] \ninterlocutory appealโ from a denial of qualified immunity. \nPelletier v. Federal Home Loan Bank of S.F., 968 F.2d 865, \n871 (9th Cir. 1992); see Todd v. United States, 849 F.2d 365, \n368 (9th Cir. 1988). \nAll  of  those  cases,  however,  predated  the  Supreme \nCourtโs decision in Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.S. 537 (2007). \nIn Wilkie, the Court considered an interlocutory appeal from \na denial of qualified immunity, and it also resolved the \nantecedent Bivens issue. Id. at 548โ49. In explaining why \nthere was appellate jurisdiction to decide whether a Bivens \ncause of action existed, the Court did not apply the pendent \nappellate jurisdiction test. It did not ask, in other words, \nwhether โ(a) [the issues are] so intertwined that we must \ndecide  the  pendent  issue  in  order  to  review  the  claims \nproperly raised on interlocutory appeal, or (b) resolution of \nthe issue properly raised on interlocutory appeal necessarily \nresolves the pendent issue.โ Cunningham v. Gates, 229 F.3d \n1271,  1285  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (internal  citation  omitted). \nInstead,  the  Court  said,  without  elaboration,  that  the \nrecognition of the underlying Bivens cause of action was \nโdirectly implicated by the defense of qualified immunity \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 11 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    11 \nand properly before us on interlocutory appeal.โ Wilkie, 551 \nU.S. at 549 n.4 (quoting Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, \n257 n.5 (2006)). Wilkie establishes that, in an interlocutory \nappeal from a denial of qualified immunity, we necessarily \nhave jurisdiction to decide whether an underlying Bivens \ncause of action exists. \nOur more recent cases have reflected this understanding \nof Wilkie. In Mejia v. Miller, for example, we held that, in an \ninterlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity, we \nhad jurisdiction to decide whether a Bivens remedy was \navailable because โthe existence of the cause of action is an \nantecedent legal question defining the claim . . . , and it is \ndirectly implicated by the defense of qualified immunity.โ \n53 F.4th 501, 502 (9th Cir. 2022). We reached the same \nconclusion in Ioane v. Hodges, where we said that โ[b]efore \nreaching the issue of qualified immunity, the first question \nwe must address is whether [the plaintiff] may bring a Bivens \nsuit.โ 939 F.3d 945, 951 (9th Cir. 2018). Earlier, we took the \nsame approach in Ministerio Roca Solida v. McKelvey, 820 \nF.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2016). We explained that the defendant \nโfiled an interlocutory appeal to challenge the denial of \nqualified immunityโ and that such a challenge addresses, โby \nnecessity, the validity of the underlying Bivens cause of \naction.โ Id. at 1093 (emphasis added). In none of those cases \ndid we mention pendent appellate jurisdiction or apply the \ntest associated with that doctrine. \nTo be sure, in Mejia and the other recent cases, we did \nnot expressly address the pre-Wilkie cases, such as Wong, \nPelletier, and Todd, that rejected interlocutory jurisdiction \nover the Bivens issue. But the approach we have taken is \ninconsistent with that of the earlier cases. We read our more \nrecent decisions as implicitly recognizing that the earlier \ncases  are  โclearly  irreconcilableโ  with  Wilkie  and  are \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 12 of 19\n12  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL \ntherefore no longer good law. Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d \n889, 893 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). \nSince Wilkie, we have not directly addressed whether the \nnew  rule  is  that  we  have  jurisdiction  to  consider  the \navailability of a Bivens cause of action in an interlocutory \nappeal from a denial of qualified immunity, but every other \ncircuit to have considered that question has answered it in \nthe affirmative. Those courts have applied Wilkie to hold that \nin  an  interlocutory  appeal  from  a  denial  of  qualified \nimmunity, โone potential ground of decision is a conclusion \nthat the plaintiff does not have a legally sound claim for \nrelief.โ Vance v. Rumsfeld, 701 F.3d 193, 197 (7th Cir. 2012) \n(en banc); accord Vanderklok v. United States, 868 F.3d 189, \n197 (3d Cir. 2017); Tun-Cos v. Perrotte, 922 F.3d 514, 520 \n(4th Cir. 2019); Byrd v. Lamb, 990 F.3d 879, 881 (5th Cir. \n2021) (per curiam), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 2850 (2022); \nElhady v. Unidentified CBP Agents, 18 F.4th 880, 884 (6th \nCir. 2021), cert. denied sub nom. Elhady v.

Office of Inspector Gen. for \nU.S. Depโt of Labor, 881 F.3d 912, 918 (D.C. Cir. 2018). But \ncf. Dixon v. von Blanckensee, 994 F.3d 95, 101 n.4 (2d Cir. \n2021) (rejecting the plaintiffโs claim on qualified immunity \ngrounds and declining to determine jurisdiction over the \nBivens  question).  We  see  no  reason  to  depart  from  the \nconsensus among the other courts of appeals. \nWe  conclude  that  we  have  appellate  jurisdiction  to \nconsider Russellโs argument that no Bivens cause of action \nexists in this case. \nIII \nCongress has made a cause of action available to any \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 13 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    13 \nperson who has suffered โthe deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and \nlawsโ at the hands of someone acting under color of state \nlaw. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. But it has not created a general cause \nof action to redress violations of the Constitution by federal \nofficers. Nevertheless, in three cases decided between 1971 \nand 1980, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution \ncontains an implied cause of action through which plaintiffs \ncan seek damages from federal officers who violate their \nconstitutional rights. First, in Bivens, the Court held that a \nplaintiff  could  seek  damages  from  Federal  Bureau  of \nNarcotics  agents  who  allegedly  violated  his  Fourth \nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and \nseizures. 403 U.S. at 397. Next, in Davis v. Passman, the \nCourt extended that remedy to a plaintiff who alleged that \nher employer, a Member of Congress, had discriminated \nagainst her because of  her sex, in violation of the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 442 U.S. 228, 230โ\n31 (1979). Finally, in Carlson v. Green, the Court held that \nthe estate of a deceased prisoner could seek damages from \nfederal prison officials for violations of the prisonerโs Eighth \nAmendment  right  to  be  free  from  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment. 446 U.S. 14, 16โ18 (1980). \nAlthough the Supreme Court has not overruled Bivens, \nDavis, and Carlson, it has recognized that they are in tension \nwith โthe Courtโs general approach to recognizing implied \ndamages remedies,โ and that โthe analysis in the Courtโs \nthree Bivens cases might have been different if they were \ndecided today.โ Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1856 \n(2017). Since 1980, the Court has not recognized any new \nBivens remedy. To the contrary, โthe Court has made clear \nthat expanding the Bivens remedy is now a โdisfavoredโ \njudicial activity,โ id. at 1857 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 14 of 19\n14  PETTIBONE V.

Ct.  735,  741  (2020)  (โ[W]hen  a  court \nrecognizes  an  implied  claim  for  damages,โ  it  โrisks \narrogating legislative power.โ). Thus, if โthere is any reason \nto think that Congress might be better equipped to create a \ndamages remedyโ for a constitutional violation, we must \nrefrain from recognizing one.

Ct. at 1803 \n(emphasis added). \nBefore  affording  a  plaintiff  a  cause  of  action  under \nBivens, a court must go through two steps: \nFirst, we ask whether the case presents โa \nnew  Bivens  contextโโi.e.,  is  it \nโmeaningful[ly]โ  different  from  the  three \ncases  in  which  the  Court  has  implied  a \ndamages action. Second, if a claim arises in a \nnew context, a Bivens remedy is unavailable \nif there are โspecial factorsโ indicating that \nthe  Judiciary  is  at  least  arguably  less \nequipped than Congress to โweigh the costs \nand benefits of allowing a damages action to \nproceed.โ \nEgbert,  142  S.  Ct.  at  1803  (internal  citation  omitted) \n(quoting Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1858โ60). Applying that test, \nwe hold that the Bivens remedy cannot be extended to the \nclaims before us because this case presents a new context, \nand several factors indicate that we are less equipped than \nCongress to determine whether a damages action should \nproceed. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 15 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    15 \nA \nRecognizing a Bivens cause of action in this case would \nrequire extending Bivens to a new context. In assessing \nwhether  a  context  is  โnew,โ  the  Supreme  Court  has \ninstructed us not to examine Bivens cases in the lower courts, \nbut only โthe three cases in which the [Supreme] Court has \nimplied a damages action.โ Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1803; see \nLoumiet v. United States, 948 F.3d 376, 382 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(โ[T]he new-context analysis may consider only Supreme \nCourt decisions approving Bivens actions.โ). The Court has \nprovided  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  โdifferences  that  are \nmeaningful enough to make a given context a new one,โ \nincluding  โthe  rank  of  the  officers  involved; . . . the \ngenerality  or  specificity  of  the  official  action; . . . the \nstatutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was \noperating;  [and]  the  risk  of  disruptive  intrusion  by  the \nJudiciary into the functioning of other branches.โ Abbasi, \n137 S. Ct. at 1859โ60.  \nThis case differs from Bivensโthe only Supreme Court \ncase recognizing an implied damages remedy for Fourth \nAmendment violationsโalong all of those dimensions. In \nBivens, the defendants were agents of the Federal Bureau of \nNarcotics  who,  without  a  warrant,  โentered  [Bivensโs] \napartment[,] . . . manacled [him] in front of his wife and \nchildren, and threatened to arrest the entire familyโ before \nโsearch[ing] the apartment from stem to stern.โ 403 U.S. at \n389. Russell, a high-level supervisor, was of a different rank \nthan the agents in Bivens. Russellโs alleged actions, which \nconsisted  of  ordering  or  acquiescing  in  unconstitutional \nconduct, took place at a higher level of generality than the \nactions of the agents in Bivens, who personally seized Bivens \nand searched his apartment. The legal mandate under which \nRussell acted differed from that of the agents in Bivens in \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 16 of 19\n16  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL \nthat Russell, an officer of the Federal Protective Service, was \ndirecting  a  multi-agency  operation  to  protect  federal \nproperty  and  was  carrying  out  an  executive  order.  And \nbecause  Russell  was  carrying  out  an  executive  order, \nproviding a Bivens remedy in this context would carry a \ngreater โrisk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the \nfunctioning of other branchesโ than was present in Bivens. \nAbbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860. Those differences are more than \nsufficient to make this a new Bivens context. See id. at 1864โ\n65  (explaining  that  โthe  new-context  inquiry  is  easily \nsatisfiedโ  and  that  โeven  a  modest  extension  is  still  an \nextensionโ).  \nIn  reaching  a  contrary  conclusion,  the  district  court \nrecognized that Russell is of a higher rank than the agents in \nBivens and that, unlike those agents, he is accused of having \nordered or acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of his \nsubordinates, rather than carrying it out himself. But the \ndistrict court believed that those facts did not make this \ncontext new because Carlson established that a supervisory \nofficial could potentially be liable for a failure of oversight. \nSee Carlson, 446 U.S. at 16 n.1; Green v. Carlson, 581 F.2d \n669, 671 (7th Cir. 1978), affโd, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). Carlson, \nof course, was different from this case because it involved \nprison officials and a claim of cruel and unusual punishment \nunder the Eighth Amendment. 446 U.S. at 17. This case is \nlike neither Bivens nor Carlson, and we are not convinced \nthat a plaintiff can defeat a finding that a case presents a new \ncontext by showing that each of its facts, taken separately, \nresembles facts found in different Bivens precedents. But \neven if such a mix-and-match analysis were permissible, we \nwould still hold that this case presents a new context. Russell \nand the supervisory medical officer in Carlson were acting \nunder  different  mandates,  and  allowing  the  officer  in \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 17 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    17 \nCarlson to be held liable did not present the same โrisk of \ndisruptive intrusionโ into the functioning of the Executive \nBranch  because  that  officer  was  not  implementing  an \nexecutive  order.  See Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1860. Those \ndifferences alone are sufficient to make this a new Bivens \ncontext. \nB \nโIf there is even a single โreason to pause before applying \nBivens in a new context,โ a court may not recognize a Bivens \nremedy.โ Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1803 (quoting Hernandez, \n140 S. Ct. at 743). Here, at least two independent reasons \ncounsel in favor of withholding a Bivens remedy.   \nFirst, the โrisk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary \ninto the functioning of other branchesโ counsels hesitation \nin  this  case.  Abbasi,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1860.  Russell  was \noverseeing an operation that was carrying out an executive \norder. In other words, he was implementing a high-level \nexecutive policy in the context of an evolving situation. \nAllowing  a  Bivens  action  to  proceed  in  this  case  could \nexpose sensitive communications between Russell and other \nhigh-level executive officers regarding the implementation \nof that policy. See id. \nThe district court saw this issue differently. In its view, \nthe  case  โfocuses  on  Defendant  Russellโs  personal \ninvolvement and direct  causal connection to the alleged \nconstitutional violations while he was in Portland,โ not on \nโpurported high level policy decisions or communications \nwith  then-President  Trump.โ  But  Russellโs  โpersonal \ninvolvementโ  in  the  alleged  violations  consisted  of  his \nexercise of  broad control over a multi-agency operation \ncarried out to protect federal property as directed by an \nexecutive  order.  His  decisions  in  that  role  cannot  be \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 18 of 19\n18  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL \ndisentangled  from  how  he  was  interpreting  and \nimplementing policy developed by his superiors at the higher \nlevels of the Executive Branch.  \nSecond, โ[i]f there are alternative remedial structures in \nplace, โthat alone,โ like any special factor, is reason enough \nto  โlimit  the  power  of  the  Judiciary  to  infer  a \nnew Bivens cause of action.โโ Egbert, 142 S. Ct. at 1804 \n(quoting Abassi, 137 S. Ct. at 1858). Here, Congress has \nafforded plaintiffs like Pettibone an alternative remedy โthat \nindependently foreclose[s] a Bivens action.โ Id. at 1806. \nAggrieved parties can report any alleged misconduct to the \nInspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, \nwho must either investigate or refer the matter to the Officer \nfor  Civil  Rights  and  Civil  Liberties.  5  U.S.C.  app.  3 \nยง 8I(f)(2)(B)โ(C), (F)โ(G); see also 6 U.S.C. ยง 345(a)(1), \n(4), (6) (requiring Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties \nto investigate alleged misconduct). Pettibone argues that this \nremedy  is  insufficient  because  it  serves  only  an \nโinformation-gatheringโ function. But the Department can \ntake corrective action against employees in response to the \nInspector Generalโs reports, 5 U.S.C. app. 3 ยง 8I(f)(2)(H)(ii). \nThe grievance procedure is thus comparable to the remedy \ndeemed adequate in Egbert. There, the Court held that a \nregulation  requiring  an  agency  to  investigate  alleged \nmisconduct offered an adequate alternative to Bivens, even \nthough the complainant was โnot entitled to participate and \nha[d]  no  right  to  judicial  review  of  an  adverse \ndeterminationโโand  even  though,  as  here,  the  remedial \nscheme did not provide monetary relief. Egbert, 142 S. Ct. \nat 1806. The grievance procedure available in this case offers \na similar right to an investigation, and a similar possibility \nof  corrective  action.  Just  as  the  availability  of  such  a \ngrievance procedure precluded a Bivens action in Egbert, so \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY      Document 228      Filed 02/02/23      Page 19 of 19\n  PETTIBONE V. RUSSELL    19 \ntoo does it preclude a Bivens action in this case. See id. at \n1806โ07. \nBecause Pettibone has no cause of action under Bivens, \nwe need not consider whether Russell would be entitled to \nqualified immunity.  \nREVERSED. ",

(collectively, โPlaintiffsโ), for their Complaint against the named defendants \n(โDefendantsโ), allege as follows: \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n1.  Plaintiffs are individual Oregoniansโor, in the case of Black Millennial \nMovement and Rose City Justice, Inc., associations of individual Oregoniansโwho lawfully \nparticipated in protests in Portland, Oregon directed against systemic racism and police violence \ntowards Black Americans following the Minneapolis Police killing of George Floyd on May 25, \n2020.  This action arises out of Defendantsโ unlawful attempts to crush Black protesters and their \nsupporters through the use of excessive force and illegal detentions against Plaintiffs in violation \nof their rights under the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution as well \nas federal statutory law.     \n2.  As part of a federal mission known as โOperation Diligent Valor,โ spurred by \nPresident Donald J. Trump and directed by the purported Acting Director of the United States \nPage 2  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 3 of 61\nDepartment of Homeland Security (โDHSโ) Chad Wolf, the federal government deployed more \nthan a hundred federal law enforcement officers or agents employed by a variety of federal \nagencies in an alleged effort to โquellโ the protests, which were occurring near the Mark O. \nHatfield Federal Courthouse (the โHatfield Courthouseโ) in the center of Portland.  Such federal \nlaw enforcement officials, heavily armed and clad in military-type camouflage or dark uniforms, \nindiscriminately used violent tactics on lawful protesters, including shooting them in the head \nand body with impact munitions and pepper balls, spraying them directly in the face with pepper \nspray, shoving them to the ground, hitting and beating them with batons, firing massive clouds of \ntear gas at them, and, in some instances, arresting and detaining them without any lawful basis.  \nThe federal agencies or divisions and their leaders and employees responsible for this conduct \nare the Defendants in this action.   \n3.  Defendantsโ actions in support of โOperation Diligent Valorโ manifestly violated \nPlaintiffsโ rights enshrined in the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution:  the rights to peaceful assembly, to freedom of speech, and to freedom from \nunwarranted governmental seizures.     \n4.  Defendantsโ actions also violated federal statutory law for at least two reasons:   \na.  First, โOperation Diligent Valorโ was not legally authorized.  Pursuant to \n40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(a), the Acting Secretary of DHS has limited statutory authority to \ndesignate DHS employees to โprotect the buildings, grounds, and property that are \nowned, occupied, or secured by the Federal Government . . . and the persons on the \nproperty.โ  Defendant Wolf, however, had no such authority because he was not properly \ndesignated and serving as the Acting Secretary of DHS under the requirements of the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. ยง 113(g), and the Federal Vacancies Reform \nPage 3  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 4 of 61\nAct, 5 U.S.C. ยง 3348.  As a result, he had (and still has) no authority whatsoever under 40 \nU.S.C. ยง 1315 and his designation of DHS officers pursuant to โOperation Diligent \nValorโ was null and void.   \nb.  Second, even assuming โOperation Diligent Valorโ had been properly \nauthorized, the DHS officers conducting the operation exceeded their limited powers \nunder 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, which does not allow making warrantless arrests or taking \nactions such as detaining individuals or suppressing protests in locations that are away \nfrom, or not required to protect, federal property.   \n5.  Plaintiffs are now asking the Court to protect them and vindicate their rights by \ndeclaring Defendantsโ actions unlawful, entering appropriate injunctive relief, and awarding \nthem economic damages for the violation of their constitutional rights. \nII.  PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs.   \n6.  Plaintiff Mark Pettibone is a 30-year-old resident of Multnomah County, Oregon \nand a citizen of the United States.

He is currently employed as an educational department \nmanager at a local university hospital.  He has attended the protests outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse in support of Black Lives Matter and against the disproportionate use of police \nviolence against Black individuals. \n14.

Members of Black Millennial Movement \nhave participated frequently in the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse in support of Black \nLives Matter and against the disproportionate use of police violence against Black individuals. \n15.  Plaintiff Rose City Justice, Inc. is an Oregon nonprofit corporation whose mission \nis to bring awareness to the community, to reform systems founded on inequitable and raist \nideals, and to demand justice in a nonviolent manner.  Rose City Justice, Inc.โs members \nparticipated in the Black Lives Matter protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse to provide \nsupport and assistance. \nB.  Defendants.        \n16.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  He participated \nwith Defendant Wolf and others in setting in motion and causing deployment of โOperation \nDiligent Valor,โ as well as in acquiescing in and ratifying the unconstitutional and unlawful \nPage 6  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 7 of 61\nactions of DHS and other federal government employees as part of that operation.  He is sued in \nhis official capacity.   \n17.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is a government official who purports to serve as the \nActing Secretary of DHS; however, he was not properly designated to that position in \naccordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. ยง 113(g).  He participated in \nsetting in motion, causing, and supervising โOperation Diligent Valor,โ designating DHS \nemployees to serve in that operation, and acquiescing in and ratifying the unconstitutional and \nunlawful actions of such employees as set forth below.  He is sued in his individual and official \ncapacities.   \n18.  Defendant Gabriel Russell is the Regional Director for Region 10 of the Federal \nProtective Service (โFPSโ), which is an agency housed within DHS, where it is responsible for \nprotection of federal property.  He commanded the DHS Rapid Deployment Force for \nโOperation Diligent Valor,โ and is responsible for the actions of the federal employees who \nconducted that operation and who currently remain stationed in Portland, Oregon.  He is sued in \nhis individual and official capacities.   \n19.  Defendants Does 1-200 (โDefendant Doesโ) are unknown officers, agents, or \ncontract employees of DHS and/or the United States Marshals Service (โUSMSโ) deployed to \nPortland under color of federal authority as part of or in connection with โOperation Diligent \nValor.โ  They are not readily identifiable because they frequently acted in groups and wore \nuniforms, helmets, and/or other clothing without obvious identifying information.  Plaintiffs will \namend the Complaint to allege their true names and identities when ascertained.  Defendants \nDoes are sued in their individual capacities.  \nPage 7  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 8 of 61\n20.  Defendant DHS is a cabinet-level department of the United States government \nthat houses various departments and agencies, including United States Customs and Border \nProtection (โCBPโ), FPS, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ).  Defendant DHS \nis an โagencyโ as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. ยง 551(1).     \n21.  Defendant USMS is a federal law enforcement agency housed within the United \nStates Department of Justice.  Defendant USMS is an โagencyโ as that term is defined in 5 \nU.S.C. ยง 551(1).   \n22.  Each Defendant is responsible to Plaintiffs for the injuries and damages that \nPlaintiffs have suffered as a result of the actions of the Defendants alleged in this Complaint.   \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 \nbecause the claims in this action present federal questions in that they:  (1) seek to redress the \ndeprivation of rights under the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, \n(2) arise under the federal Administrative Procedures Act, and (3) arise under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 \nbecause they seek to redress violations of 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1985 and 1986.   \n24.  Venue is proper in the United States District Court, District of Oregon, Portland \nDivision, because the events giving rise to the claims took place in Multnomah County, Oregon.   \nIV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Portland Protests and the Federal Deployment of โOperation Diligent Valor.โ \n25.  Just after 8:00 p.m. on May 25, 2020, Minneapolis Police officers killed George \nFloyd, a 46-year-old African American man.  Mr. Floyd was arrested on suspicion of his \ninvolvement in a nonviolent offense.  After he was handcuffed and fell to the payment, a police \nofficer kneeled on Mr. Floydโs neck with the weight of his body.  For eight minutes and 46 \nPage 8  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 9 of 61\nseconds, the officer held his knee on Mr. Floydโs neck as Mr. Floyd pleaded for relief, until he \nwas killed.  Other officers held his legs or stood by and watched.   \n26.  The video of Mr. Floydโs murderโcoupled with the nationโs long history of \npolice killings of a disproportionately large number of Black Americansโtriggered a series of \nprotests opposing rampant police violence against Black Americans and supporting Black Lives \nMatter across the county, including in Portland, Oregon.   \n27.  Beginning on or about May 29, 2020, protesters took to the streets of Portland in \nlarge numbers.  These protests have continued for more than 80 consecutive nights and have \nincluded regular protests in the city parks and streets that surround the Hatfield Courthouse and \nthe Multnomah County Justice Center. \n28.  Over the course of the month following Mr. Floydโs tragic death, Defendant \nTrump issued multiple statements denouncing the protests in various cities and threatening to use \nfederal forces to crush them.  For example, on May 29, 2020, three days after the protests began \nin Minneapolis, Defendant Trump issued a tweet stating, โEither the very weak Radical Left \nMayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the \nNational Guard & get the job done right.โ1  He continued, โAny difficulty and we will assume \ncontrol, but when the looting starts the shooting starts.โ2  Similarly, on June 3, 2020, he claimed \nin a televised broadcast interview with Sean Spicer โthe nation needs law and order because you \nhave a bad group of people out there and theyโre using George Floyd and theyโre using a lot of \n \n1 Donald J.

On June 26, 2020, as the protests in Portland and elsewhere continued, Defendant \nTrump went further, issuing an Executive Order on Protecting American Monuments, \nMemorials, and Statutes and Combating Recent Criminal Violence (โExecutive Orderโ).4  The \nExecutive Order blamed โleft-wing extremistsโ for โadvanc[ing] a fringe ideology that paints the \nUnited States of America as fundamentally unjust and have sought to impose that ideology on \nAmericans through violence and mob intimidation.โ5  In addition, it directed the Secretary of \nDHS to provide โpersonnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, \nstatues, or property.โ6 \n30.  The Executive Order reflected Defendant Trumpโs consistent policy of defending \nracist monuments and institutions and attacking individuals who seek to dismantle them as \nlawless extremists.  For example, in a press conference on August 15, 2017, Defendant Trump \ncriticized protesters who sought to confront white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups opposing the \nremoval of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia as โalt-leftโ groups who were \nโvery, very violent,โ suggesting that both sides were to blame for the clash, even though the \nprincipal violence was by a right-wing extremist who killed a woman by driving his car into \n \n3 Associated Press Video Transcript, Trump: โthe nation needs law and orderโ, June 4, 2020, \nhttps://news.yahoo.com/trump-nation-needs-law-order-093644124.html. \n4 Exec.

Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson-whoโs \nnext, Washington, Jefferson?  So foolish!โ8  Similarly, on July 6, 2020, Defendant Trump \nmounted a defense of the Confederate flag and suggested NASCAR had made a mistake in \nbanning it at racing events while accusing a well-known Black race driver, Darrell Wallace, Jr., \nof perpetrating a hoax involving a noose found in his garage.9   \n31.  Acting pursuant to Defendant Trumpโs Executive Order and consistent with his \npurpose of suppressing protests against racism and white nationalism, on July 1, 2020, Defendant \nWolf announced that DHS would form a special task force charged with โconduct[ing] ongoing \nassessments of potential civil unrest or destruction and allocat[ing] resources to protect people \nand property,โ and to engage in โpotential surge activity to ensure the continuing protection of \ncritical locations.โ10  He further stated that the federal government โwonโt stand idly by while \n \n7 Michael D.

Starting in the early morning hours of July 4, 2020, the Rapid Deployment Force \nand affiliated USMS officers began to engage in tactical operations designed to crush the protests \nin Portland and to further Defendant Trumpโs stated political aim of appearing to take control \nover allegedly lawless cities run by Democratic mayors.  The tactics used by the officers went \nbeyond what was required for their limited mission of protecting federal property and reflected a \npolicy designed to retaliate against and to deter the protesters because of their views and beliefs.  \nThese tactics included the use of surveillance, warrantless arrests, or custodial detentions of \nprotesters, and the indiscriminate use of excessive force, including shooting protesters in the \nhead and body with impact munitions and pepper balls, spraying them directly in the face with \npepper spray, shoving them to the ground, hitting and beating them with batons, and firing \nmassive clouds of tear gas at them, even when doing so was not necessary to protect federal \nproperty.     \n35.  Many of these unlawful actions were captured on video or photographed by the \nnews media or other protesters as they occurred.  For example, on Saturday, July 11, 2020, \nOregon Public Broadcasting (โOPBโ) published a video showing federal law enforcement \nofficers shooting a 26-year-old protester, Donovan LaBella, in the head with impact munitions.  \nAt the time Mr. LaBella was shot, he was standing across the street from the Hatfield Courthouse \nprotesting while holding a music speaker above his head.15  As a result of that shooting, \nMr. LaBella suffered severe injuriesโhe was initially in critical condition upon admission to a \nhospital with a skull fracture, and he subsequently underwent facial reconstruction surgery for \nhis injuries.   \n \n15 Jonathan Levinson, Federal Officers Shoot Portland Protester in Head with โLess Lethalโ \nMunitions, OPB, July 12, 2020, https://www.opb.org/news/article/federal-officers-portland-\nprotester-shot-less-lethal-munitions/.   \nPage 13  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 14 of 61\n36.

Defendantsโ unlawful actions under โOperation Diligent Valorโ were immediately \ncondemned by state and local officials.  For example, Oregon Governor Kate Brown denounced \nthe shooting of Mr. LaBella as โthe tragic and avoidable result of President Donald Trump, for \nweeks, continuing to push for force and violence in response to protests . . . .  President Trump \ndeploying armed federal officers to Portland only serves to escalate tensions and, as we saw \nyesterday, will inevitably lead to unnecessary violence and confrontation.โ24  Portland Mayor \nTed Wheeler echoed Governor Brownโs concern, stating โthe actions of federal officers last night \nescalated, rather than de-escalated, already heightened tensions in our city.โ25   \n40.

For example, on July 13, 2020, two days after \nMr. LaBellaโs shooting, Defendant Trump lauded federal authorities for doing โa great jobโ in \nPortland.26  He stated that โPortland was totally out of control . . . .  [A]nd we very much quelled \nit, and if it starts again, weโll quell it again very easily.โ27   \n41.  Similarly, on July 16, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued a statement while visiting \nPortland in which he referred to Portlandโs demonstrators as โviolent anarchistsโ and a โviolent \nmob,โ and stated that โlocal and state leaders are . . . focusing on placing blame on law \nenforcement and requesting fewer officers in their community.โ28  In response to what he \ncharacterized as an invitation for DHS to pack up and go home, Defendant Wolf was blunt:  \nโThatโs just not going to happen on my watch.โ29 \n42.  The next day, July 17, 2020, Defendant Wolf posted a photo on Twitter of federal \nagents in camouflage within the Hatfield Courthouse, writing that โ[w]e will never surrender to \nviolent extremists on my watch.โ  He later removed the post.30   \n \n26 Noelle Crombie, Trump Says Feds in Portland Have Done โa Great Jobโ on Protests, \nOregonLive.com, July 13, 2020, https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/07/trump-says-feds-in-\nportland-have-done-a-great-job-on-protests.html; Remarks in a Roundtable Discussion on the \nPositive Impact of Law Enforcement and an Exchange with Reporters, 2009 Daily Comp.

One day later, on July 18, 2020, Defendant Trump issued a Twitter post, stating, \nโWe are trying to help Portland, not hurt it . . . .  Their leadership has, for months, lost control of \nthe anarchists and agitators.  They are missing in action.  We must protect Federal property, \nAND OUR PEOPLE.  These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal!โ31   \n44.  On July 20, 2020, Defendant Trump again criticized Portland as โtotally out of \ncontrol . . . the liberal Democrats running the place had no idea what they were doing.โ  He went \nstill further, threatening to deploy federal law enforcement officers to other cities run by โliberal \nDemocrats,โ specifically New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, and Oakland.  He \nportrayed those cities as out of control, characterizing them as โrun by very liberal Democrats.  \nAll run, really, by radical left.โ32   \nC.  Continued State and Local Opposition Finally Leads to a Stand Down, but Federal \nOfficers Remain in Portland Poised to Recommence Operations. \n45.  Despite the statements of Individual Defendants Trump and Wolf supporting \nโOperation Diligent Valor,โ state and local leaders continued to press their request that federal \nlaw enforcement officers leave Portland.  For example, on July 19, Portland City Commissioner \nJo Ann Hardesty stated that she was joining โthe loud chorus of elected officials calling for the \nfederal troops in Portlandโs streets to go home . . . . Their presence here has escalated tensions \nand put countless Portlanders exercising their First Amendment rights in greater danger.โ33   \n \n31 House Leaders โAlarmedโ Federal Officers Policing Protests, Associated Press, July 19, 2020, \nhttps://apnews.com/7c8c1a311b5c668a8cd4f757453bcf5c.  \n32 The White House, Remarks by President Trump on Phase Four Negotiations, July 20, 2020, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-phase-four-\nnegotiations/.  \n33 Katie Shepherd & Mark Berman, โIt Was Like Being Preyed Uponโ: Portland Protesters Say \nFederal Officers in Unmarked Vans Are Detaining Them, Wash.

These calls reflected the widely reported fact that the presence of federal officers \nwas aggravating rather than diffusing tension at the protests and significantly increasing the \nnumber of protesters, many of whom were now protesting against the presence of the federal \nofficers as well as in support of Black Lives Matter and in opposition to police violence against \nBlack Americans.34  Indeed, federal law enforcement officers speaking on the condition of \nanonymity acknowledged to OPB that their actions โcontributed to the quick escalation between \nlaw enforcement and groups of protesters, which had dwindled to a couple hundred people or \nless earlier this month [i.e., before the attack on Mr. LaBella].โ35  Such officers also \nacknowledged that โthe nature of the situation in Portland is a โcrisisโ being watched and \nmanaged from the highest levels of the federal government.โ36 \n47.  Against this backdrop, on July 28, 2020, Governor Brown negotiated an \nagreement with Vice President Mike Pence and other senior federal administration officials \nunder which CBP and ICE officers would โleave downtown Portlandโ and Oregon State Police \nwould step in to keep the peace and allow protesters to refocus attention on racial justice and \npolice accountability.37   \n48.  While federal officials have acknowledged this arrangement, they have steadfastly \nrefused to commit to a full disengagement.  For example, on July 28, 2020, Defendant Wolf \nacknowledged that Oregon State Police would step in, but informed the nation that DHS โwill \n \n34 Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, What Do Portland Protesters Want, and How Have the \nPolice Responded?, N.Y.

Along these same lines, on August 4, 2020, DHS confirmed that although federal \nofficers had not interfered with peaceful protesters during the preceding days, โ[t]here has been \nno reduction in federal presence; federal law enforcement officers remain in Portland at \naugmented levels.โ43  โ[T]he increased federal presence in Portland will remain until [DHS] is \ncertain that federal property is safe.โ44  DHS characterized the situation as โdynamic and \nvolatileโ and stated that โno determination of timetables for reduction of protective forces has yet \nbeen made.โ45  \n51.

The Deployment and Continued Presence of Federal Officers in Portland as Part of \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ Was Not Lawfully Authorized or Executed. \n54.  In addition to violating Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, the deployment of federal \nofficers to Portland as part of โOperation Diligent Valorโ was unlawful because Defendant Wolf \nlacked the authority to designate DHS employees to protect the Hatfield Courthouse and because \nthe operation was not executed in accordance with the federal statute under which Defendants \nclaimed to be acting.   \n1.  Defendant Wolf Lacked the Authority to Deploy Federal Officers to Portland \nBecause He Was Not Properly Serving as Acting Secretary of DHS. \n55.  Defendant Wolf designated DHS officers to protect the Hatfield Courthouse \npursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, which grants the Secretary of DHS (or properly serving Acting \nSecretary) limited statutory authority to designate DHS employees to โprotect the buildings, \ngrounds, and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the Federal Government . . . and \nthe persons on the property.โ  Defendant Wolfโs designation, however, was not lawful, valid, or \neffective because he was not legally serving as the Acting Secretary of DHS when he \ncommenced โOperation Diligent Valor.โ  As a result, he had and still has no power under 40 \nU.S.C. ยง 1315 and there was no lawful basis for the deployment of the Rapid Deployment Force \nto Portland.   \n56.  By way of background, the Secretary of DHS is normally appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate.  6 U.S.C. ยงยง 112(a)(1), 113(a)(1)(A).  In the \nevent of a vacancy, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 provides an order of succession to fill the \nposition pending the presidential appointment of a replacement.  Id. ยง 113(g).  Pursuant to this \norder of succession, the Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary for Management of DHS are next \nin line to serve in an acting capacity when there is a vacancy.  Id. ยง 113(g)(1).  Beyond this \nPage 21  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 22 of 61\nmandated order, โthe Secretary may designate such other officers of the Department in further \norder of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.โ  Id. ยง 113(g)(2). \n57.  Defendant Wolf assumed the role of Acting Secretary through a series of events \nfollowing the resignation of DHS Secretary Kristjen Nielsen on April 10, 2019.  At that time, the \nDeputy Secretary position had been vacant since April 14, 2018 and the Under Secretary for \nManagement had resigned on April 10, 2019, meaning that Secretary Nielsenโs own list of \nfurther successors would apply.  That list, which was set forth in Delegation 00106, Revision \nNo 08.5 (Apr. 10, 2019), provided that vacancies due to the Secretaryโs death, resignation, or \ninability to perform the functions of the position were to be filled in the following order: \n(1) Deputy Secretary, (2) Under Secretary for Management, (3) Administrator of Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, and (4) Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure \nSecurity Agency.  \n58.  Although this was the required order of succession, it was not followed.  Instead, \nthe person who purported to assume the Acting Secretary position was Keven McAleenan, who \nhad been serving as the Commissioner of CBP.  While Mr. McAleenan had been identified in \nDelegation 00106 as a potential successor to Secretary Nielsen in the event of a disaster or \ncatastrophic emergency, he was not properly in line to assume her role in the event of her \nresignation.  As a result, Mr. McAleenanโs assumption of the role of Acting Secretary was not \nlawful and all orders that he issued in that capacity are null and void. \n59.  Defendant Wolf assumed the position of Acting Secretary following Mr. \nMcAleenanโs resignation as of November 13, 2019.  Defendant Wolf took the position based on \na new version of Delegation 00106, Revision No. 08.6, that Mr. McAleenan issued on \nNovember 8, 2019, to create a new order of succession.  However, given that Mr. McAleenan \nPage 22  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 23 of 61\nhad not properly assumed the role of Acting Secretary in the first instance, he lacked the \nauthority to modify Delegation 00106, rendering his modifications invalid and making \nDefendant Wolfโs designation as Acting Secretary pursuant to such modifications similarly \ninvalid.   \n60.  Defendant Wolf was also barred at the time from lawfully serving or issuing valid \norders as Acting Secretary by a separate statute, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (โFVRAโ).  \nUnder the FVRA, the power of any acting official to perform the functions and duties of the \noffice expires 210 days after the office first became vacant.  5 U.S.C. ยง 3346.  Moreover, if 210 \ndays pass without a Senate-confirmed officer or a nomination for the office, the FVRA requires \nthe office to remain vacant.  Id. ยง 3348(b)(1).  When Mr. McAleenan issued his revision of \nDelegation 00106 under which Defendant Wolf assumed the Acting Secretary role, more than \n210 days had passed since Secretary Nielsen resigned on April 10, 2019, and the President had \nnot appointed a successor.  As a result, even if Mr. McAleenan had properly assumed his \nposition, he lacked the authority to modify Delegation 00106 so that Defendant Wolf could \nbecome Acting Secretary.  Passage of the 210-day deadline also meant that the office had to \nremain open and that it could not be filled with anyone serving in an acting capacity, including \nDefendant Wolf.   \n61.  The invalidity of Defendant Wolfโs claim to serve as Acting Secretary was \nconfirmed on August 14, 2020, in an analysis by the United States Government Accountability \nOffice (โGAOโ).48  The GAO concluded that, for the reasons summarized above, \n \n48 GAO, Decision in the Matter of Department of Homeland SecurityโLegality of Service of \nActing Secretary of Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of \nDeputy Secretary of Homeland Security, File No. B-331650 (Aug. 14, 2020), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf.   \nPage 23  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 24 of 61\nMr. McAleenan was the โincorrectโ official to have assumed the title of Acting DHS Secretary \nfollowing the resignation of Secretary Nielsen and that his subsequent amendments to the order \nof succession โwere invalid.โ  As such, Defendant Wolfโs purported assumption of the role was \nโimproperโ and pursuant to โan invalid order of succession.โ   \n62.  Given that Defendant Wolf did not lawfully assume the role of Acting Secretary \nof DHS and that more than 210 days had passed since the office became vacant, he was without \nany authority to designate employees of DHS to protect federal property pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315.  His orders deploying DHS officers to Portland as part of โOperation Diligent Valorโ and \nmaintaining such officers in the city should therefore be declared unauthorized and unlawful. \n2.  Even if โOperation Diligent Valorโ Had Been Validly Authorized, It Has \nBeen Conducted in a Manner Exceeding DHSโs Limited Authority Under 40 \nU.S.C. ยง 1315. \n63.  Even if it had been properly authorized, โOperation Diligent Valorโ has been \nconducted in a manner that exceeded DHSโs limited authority under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315.  Pursuant \nto 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2), DHS employees properly designated to protect federal property and \npersons on the property have limited enumerated powers, including the powers to: \na.  โenforce Federal laws and regulations for the protection of persons and \nproperty,โ 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2)(A); \nb.  โmake arrests without a warrant for any offense against the United States \ncommitted in the presence of the officer or agent or for any felony cognizable under the \nlaws of the United States if the officer or agent has reasonable grounds to believe that the \nperson to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony,โ id. ยง 1315(b)(2)(C); and  \nPage 24  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 25 of 61\nc.  โconduct investigations, on and off the property in question, of offenses \nthat may have been committed against property owned or occupied by the Federal \nGovernment or persons on the property,โ id. ยง 1315(b)(2)(E).   \n64.  Defendants have exceeded these limited powers by (a) engaging in the \nwarrantless arrest of multiple individuals well away from any federal property and without \nprobable cause to believe they were committing or had committed a felony; (b) using excessive \nforce to suppress protesters who were exercising their First Amendment rights and who were not \nposing any threat to federal property or persons on federal property; and (c) engaging in \nsurveillance and intelligence gathering directed at suppressing protests rather than protecting \nfederal property or persons on federal property.   \n65.  Defendantsโ employment of such tactics in excess of their statutory authority \nshould be declared unlawful, and Defendants should be enjoined from engaging in the same \ntactics in the future. \nE.  Factual Allegations Relating to Individual Plaintiffs.   \n1.  Plaintiff Mark Pettibone \n66.  Mr. Pettibone has attended the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse on \nmultiple occasions since they initially commenced in late May 2020.  While attending the \nprotests, he has repeatedly witnessed the use of excessive force by federal officers, including the \nuse of impact munitions, pushing and shoving, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas on \nindividuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful manner.  In the early morning hours of July 15, \n2020, after having attended the protests and non-violently protesting in support of Black Lives \nMatter, he was personally subjected to such unlawful tactics when he was snatched off the street \nPage 25  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 26 of 61\nby unidentified federal officers, who arrested him and detained him in jail for hours without ever \ninforming him of the reasons for their actions, much less charging him with an offense. \n67.  The incident began when Mr. Pettibone and a friend were walking home from the \nprotests a block west of Chapman Square on Main Street.  They were approached by a group of \npeople who warned them that unidentified men in camouflage were driving around the area in \nunmarked minivans and grabbing people off the street.  Almost immediately thereafter, an \nunmarked dark-colored minivan stopped in front of Mr. Pettibone and four to five men in \ncamouflaged military garb jumped out of the van and sought to detain him.   \n68.  Mr. Pettibone could not see any specific agency badges or identification on the \nclothing worn by the men, particularly given the darkness at the time, and they did not identify \nthemselves as law enforcement officers.  Uncertain about who the men were and afraid of what \nthey might do, Mr. Pettibone ran west on Main Street and then turned south on Broadway with \none of the camouflaged men chasing him.  As he ran down Broadway, the same or a similar \nunmarked van pulled up and stopped in front of him and several men wearing the same clothing \njumped out in front of him.  \n69.  Mr. Pettibone still did not know who the men were but felt that he was not free to \nleave.  He sank to his knees and asked โWhy?โ several times.  The men did not respond and \noffered no explanation for their actions.  Instead, they firmly led him into the unmarked van, \nwhere he was put on the floor.  One of the men restrained Mr. Pettiboneโs hands above his head \nand put pressure on his head and neck to force his head down.  The men then pulled his hat down \nover his eyes to temporarily blind him, determined that he had no weapons, and drove him into \nthe garage of a building that he later learned was the Hatfield Courthouse.   \nPage 26  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 27 of 61\n70.  Once Mr. Pettibone was inside the Hatfield Courthouse, a second group of \nunidentified men wearing fatigue pants and tee shirts photographed him, searched the contents of \nhis backpack without asking consent, cuffed his hands and ankles, and placed him in a cell.  \nWhile Mr. Pettibone was in the cell, two officers approached him, represented that they were \nrecording their interaction with him, and read Mr. Pettibone his Miranda rights.  The officers \nasked Mr. Pettibone to waive his Miranda rights.  Mr. Pettibone refused to answer questions and \nrequested a lawyer.  No lawyer was provided.  Instead, the officers left, saying, โThis interview \nis terminated.โ   \n71.  At the time of his arrest, Mr. Pettibone had not committed and was not \ncommitting any federal offense and he was blocks away from the Hatfield Courthouse.  In \naddition, the federal officers who detained him did not have either probable cause or a warrant \nfor his arrest.  After being held in the jail cell for more than an hour, Mr. Pettibone was released \nwithout being given any paperwork indicating that he had even been arrested, much less charged \nwith any crime.  He was given his belongings back in a garbage bag, but a respirator that was in \nhis backpack had been damaged, and it was unclear whether his cell phone had been accessed.  \n72.  Not surprisingly, the experience of being snatched off the street and put in an \nunmarked van by unidentified men in military-style uniforms who did not explain their actions, \nsearched his possessions without consent, and held him in jail with no explanation has injured \nMr. Pettibone and caused him significant emotional distress and anxiety.  Even after his arrest, \nMr. Pettibone has continued to experience anxiety about the potential of being arrested or \nstopped again for exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest.   \nPage 27  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 28 of 61\n73.  On information and belief, some or all of the federal officers who arrested \nMr. Pettibone were DHS employees, and the federal officers who photographed him, searched \nhis possessions, and imprisoned him were USMS employees.   \n74.  On information and belief, Mr. Pettibone was arrested and detained because of his \nparticipation in the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse, which was nonviolent in nature.    \n75.  Defendants have made multiple warrantless arrests of individuals in Portland who \nhad not committed and were not committing any federal offenses, including arrests of individuals \nwho were not in the immediate vicinity of the Hatfield Courthouse.  On information and belief, \nthese arrests, including Mr. Pettiboneโs arrest, were part of officially sanctioned behavior and \nreflected a policy, practice, or custom that was directed or sanctioned by high-ranking officials, \nincluding Defendants Wolf and Russell in support of Defendant Trumpโs policy of targeting \nprotesters supporting Black Lives Matter and opposing police violence on Black Americans as \nviolent left-wing extremists or anarchists undermining white nationalist values. \n3.  Plaintiff Mac Smiff. \n76.  Mr. Smiff has attended the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse on numerous \noccasions since they initially commenced in late May 2020 and has repeatedly witnessed the use \nof excessive force by federal officers, including the use of impact munitions, pushing and \nshoving, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas on individuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful \nmanner.  In the early morning hours of July 25, 2020, he was personally subjected to such \nunlawful actions when an unidentified federal officer shot him in the head with an impact \nmunition while he was lawfully attending the protests.   \n77.  At the time he was shot, Mr. Smiff was standing in Lownsdale Square, which is \nseparated from the Hatfield Courthouse by SW Third Avenue.  Mr. Smiff was wearing a helmet \nPage 28  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 29 of 61\nwhich had a sign on it indicating that he was a member of the press.  Federal officials were \nclearing nonviolent protesters in SW Third Avenue immediately in front of the Hatfield \nCourthouse, some 15 to 20 yards away from where Mr. Smiff was standing.  Mr. Smiff was \napproximately 10 feet away from any other protesters.  When Mr. Smiff looked down at his \nphone to send a tweet, he was shot in the right side of his face with an indelible hard-cap \npaintball, just below the line of his helmet and just above a face mask he was wearing.     \n78.  The impact of the shot and resulting shock caused Mr. Smiff to fall to the ground.  \nHe got up and retreated as well as he could towards SW Fourth Avenue where there was an \nambulance and volunteers providing medical care.  Mr. Smiff was partly blinded by the paint in \nhis face and had a large contusion on his head, which restricted his mobility.  He received \ntreatment from the volunteer medics, who told him that he may have suffered a concussion.   \n79.  As a result of being shot by the federal officers, Mr. Smiff suffered physical pain \nas well as anxiety that his concussion could leave him vulnerable to more serious adverse health \nconsequences if he were injured again.  This trauma affected Mr. Sniffโs ability to work in the \ndays following his injuries and the potential of repeated injury left him fearful of exercising his \nlawful right to peacefully protest during his recovery.   \n4.  Plaintiff Andre Miller.  \n80.  Mr. Miller attended the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse on numerous \noccasions since they initially commenced in late May 2020.  Mr. Miller has been involved in \ndocumenting the protests and providing volunteer crowd-safety and medic services at the \nprotests.  While at the protests, he has repeatedly witnessed the use of excessive force by federal \nofficers, including spraying peaceful protesters in the face with chemical irritants, hitting \nPage 29  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 30 of 61\nprotesters with batons and firing cannisters of tear gas indiscriminately into crowds of \nindividuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful manner.   \n81.  On July 22, 2020, he was personally subjected to such unlawful actions when an \nunidentified federal officer shot him in the head with a tear gas cannister, causing a gash in his \nhead that required seven stitches and a concussion that continues to have lingering effects.  At \nthe time he was injured, Mr. Miller was standing in a crowd of individuals on Main Street, \nbetween SW Fourth and Fifth Avenues.  The crowd was peacefully protesting when federal \nofficers began marching up Main Street while firing tear gas cannisters and impact munitions \ninto the crowd without any advance warning or instructions.   \n82.  The crowd began to fall back in response to the tear gas and shooting.  Mr. Miller \nturned and began to move back as well.  As he retreated west on Main Street, he looked to his \nright and left and was then hit on the forehead.  He exclaimed, โI got hit! I got hit!โ to his fiancรฉe \nwho was standing next to him.  She said she had been hit as well, apparently with the cannister \nthat ricocheted off of Mr. Miller.  Mr. Miller looked down at his phone and saw that blood was \nstreaming from his head.  His eye closest to the wound then filled with blood and he could not \nsee.  He was deeply frightened by the volume of blood as he remembered the wound suffered at \nthe protests by Donovan LaBella and he was unsure how badly he had been wounded.   \n83.  Mr. Millerโs fiancรฉe applied pressure to his forehead to stanch the bleeding.  She \nthen led him in the same direction with the crowd, moving west on Main Street towards SW \nFifth Avenue.  Mr. Miller and his fiancรฉe then turned north on SW Fifth Avenue, at which point \nMr. Miller could not walk further.  He sat down and his fiancรฉe continued to apply pressure to \nthe wound on his head and called for an ambulance.  They then walked to try to locate the \nemergency vehicle, but Mr. Miller passed out momentarily and was unable to continue walking.  \nPage 30  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 31 of 61\nHe was then helped into a safe vehicle where he laid down and then vomited twice.  Eventually, \nhe was transported to the hospital where he received treatment, including the removal of metal \nfragments from his wound, seven stitches, and a CAT scan.  \n84.  As a result of his injury, Mr. Miller has suffered significant pain, emotional \ntrauma, memory loss and confusion, and irritability.  He has been unable to work and the \npotential of further injury has left him fearful of exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest \nduring his recovery.   \n5.  Plaintiff Nichol Denison. \n85.  Ms. Denison attended the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse on several occasions \nin June and July 2020.  She witnessed the use of excessive force by federal officers, including \nthe use of impact munitions, pushing and shoving, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas on \nindividuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful manner.   \n86.  On July 24, 2020, she was personally subjected to such unlawful tactics when she \nhad a tear gas cannister hurled into her head, causing a three-inch gash to her forehead that \nultimately required 11 stitches.  Ms. Denison had come to the protests that evening as a member \nof the Wall of Moms, an unincorporated association with a mission to support Black Lives \nMatter, and to protect protesters supporting Black Lives Matter from being subject to excessive \nuse of force by the federal government.  She wore a bright yellow short-sleeved tee shirt over a \nlong-sleeved shirt, a respirator, and a bright yellow plastic hard hat with โBLMโ written on it in \nblack marker. \n87.  Shortly before she was hit by the tear gas cannister, Ms. Denison was standing \nwith the Wall of Moms outside the fence surrounding the Hatfield Courthouse.  People in her \nvicinity were chanting and yelling, and some were banging on the fence, but there were no \nPage 31  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 32 of 61\nlasers, no fireworks, and no items being thrown at the Hatfield Courthouse anywhere near where \nshe was standing.  Ms. Denison herself did not engage in any violence or destruction of property.  \nShe merely stood in a line of women with arms linked, facing the fence, which was \napproximately eight feet in front of them.     \n88.  As she and others were chanting, Ms. Denison saw federal officers emerge from \nthe Hatfield Courthouse.  They made no announcement or order to disperse.  Instead, they simply \nbegan launching cannisters of tear gas at the peaceful protesters without warning.  Some of the \nprotesters who had leaf blowers tried to blow the gas back towards the federal agents.   \n89.  While this was occurring, approximately five additional federal officers dressed in \nblack with the label โDHSโ on their chests came out from the Hatfield Courthouse and rushed up \nto the fence line.  They had their weapons drawn and pointing directly at the women who were \nstanding in the line with Ms. Denison.  Without any warning, the officers then began firing at \nMs. Denison and the other women through gaps in the fence.  The weapons appeared to be \nshooting pepper balls or bullets the size of paint balls.  The officers were close enough that Ms. \nDenison could see them looking for people to shoot, including her.   \n90.  Ms. Denison was hit repeatedly and was then struck far more forcefully in the \nhead by a tear gas cannister that was, on information and belief, thrown or shot from a position \nwell above her in the Hatfield Courthouse.  Although she was wearing a yellow hard hat, the \nblow stunned her.  She tried to back away through the crowd, but the blow to her head made it \ndifficult to move.  As she removed her mask to check her injury, she was exposed to additional \ntear gas, burning her face and eyes.  As she touched her head, she realized she was bleeding \nprofusely.  Meanwhile, federal officers were discharging more gas cannisters at the protesters. \nPage 32  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 33 of 61\n91.  Ms. Denison then worked her way as best she could to a medic van where \nvolunteers were offering treatment to injured protesters.  When she removed her hard hat and \nrespirator to receive treatment, she found that she had a three-inch v-shaped gash that was \ngushing blood and was exposed to a significant amount of tear gas.  The wound was too severe \nto be treated on site, and Ms. Denison was taken to the VA hospital by some friends, where she \nreceived 11 stiches before being taken home.  A photo showing the wound on Ms. Denisonโs \nhead taken at the hospital is below: \n \nPage 33  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 34 of 61\n     \n92.  Once she was at home, Ms. Denison developed a black eye and major swelling \nfrom the injury.  Although she was exhausted by the incident, she was unable to sleep and \nsuffered extreme anxiety, reliving the event in her mind and finding herself unable to stop \ncrying. \n93.  As a result of her injury, Ms. Denison has suffered pain and ongoing anxiety and \nirritability consistent with having received a concussion.  She has also incurred medical \nPage 34  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 35 of 61\nexpenses, and suffered limitations on her ability to perform her daily tasks during her recovery \nand fear of repeated injury for exercising her lawful right to peacefully protest.  \n6.  Plaintiff Maureen Healy. \n94.  Ms. Healy has attended protests supporting Black Lives Matter and opposing \npolice violence against Black Americans at multiple locations in Portland, including the Hatfield \nCourthouse.       \n95.  On July 20, 2020, Ms. Healy was among a large group of protesters in Lownsdale \nSquare in front of the Hatfield Courthouse who were peacefully protesting and chanting.  Just \nafter midnight, she saw a small number of protesters trying to remove plywood from around the \nHatfield Courthouse.   \n96.  Without warning, federal officers then appeared and began firing flash-bangs, \nimpact munitions, and tear gas cannisters into the crowd.  The federal officers were approaching \nthe Hatfield Courthouse and the crowd from the south, either from the Justice Center or the \nFederal Building.  The crowd began to fall back, and Ms. Healy heard other protesters telling \npeople to walk and not run to avoid trampling each other.  Many people, however, including Ms. \nHealy, began to turn and run.  Just as she did so, Ms. Healy was hit in the head with a projectile \nthat felt metallic and the size of a small can.  Although she was wearing a bike helmet at the \ntime, the impact cut her face and gave her a black eye and concussion as shown below: \nPage 35  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 36 of 61\n \n97.  Ms. Healy realized she had been hit and was bleeding profusely.  After calling out \nfor help, Ms. Healy was helped to some volunteer medics who sought to treat her injuries.  But \nfederal officers continued to fire tear gas into the area, forcing them all to move farther away to a \nvan where Ms. Healy was bandaged.  She was then driven to a location where her husband was \nable to pick her up and take her to the hospital for additional treatment. \n98.  The actions of the federal officers caused Ms. Healy to suffer pain, fear, and \nanxiety.  Ms. Healy has been forced to take time off from work owing to her concussion and \noutsource work to colleagues.  She has had multiple medical appointments and still does not \nknow what substance is trapped under her skin as a result of being struck by the metallic can.  \nAlthough she would have liked to continue attending protests while the federal officers were \ndeployed in and around the Hatfield Courthouse, she was afraid for her safety and did not do so.  \nPage 36  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 37 of 61\nIn other words, she has suffered a fear of repeated injury for exercising her lawful right to \npeacefully protest. \n7.  Plaintiff Christopher David. \n99.  On July 18, 2020, Mr. David attended the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse for \nthe first time.  He decided to attend after seeing news and online video footage of protesters \nbeing attacked by federal officers, as well as the online video of an unknown person being \nabducted in an unmarked van by officers without any readily apparent identifying insignia.  He \nwanted to support the voices of the protesters in support of Black Lives Matter and against police \nviolence. \n100.  Mr. David arrived downtown at around 8:15 p.m. on July 18, 2020.  Mr. David \nwas wearing a sweatshirt that said โNAVYโ on the front.  He was also wearing a disposable \nsurgical cloth facemask, but he was not wearing a respirator, helmet, or any other protective \nclothing.  \n101.  At around 10:45 p.m., as he was about to leave the protest, Mr. David saw federal \nofficers emerging from the Hatfield Courthouse.  He saw them launch tear gas cannisters and \nrush a line of protesters standing in the intersection, knocking several to the ground.   \n102.  Mr. David was standing in Lownsdale Square at the time.  He was shocked by the \nfederal officersโ actions and walked into SW Third Avenue to talk to the officers, as shown \nbelow: \nPage 37  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 38 of 61\n \n103.  Mr. David then attempted to ask the officers what they were doing and why they \nwere not honoring their oath to support the Constitution.  The officers did not verbally respond \nor instruct Mr. David to move, but one of the officers trained his firearm on Mr. Davidโs chest \nand then lowered it, after which another officer plowed into Mr. David to knock him back.  \n104.  Mr. David stumbled backwards in the street to recover his balance.  Two federal \nofficers then approached Mr. David, one after the other, and struck him with their batons while \none of them deployed a canister of chemical irritant spray directly into Mr. Davidโs face.  Mr. \nDavid was able to knock the cannister away in self-defense only to have another officer approach \nand spray him in the face again. \n105.  In addition to being sprayed twice in the face, Mr. David believes that he was \nstruck with a baton at least five times, including a blow to his right hand.  Mr. David tried to \nPage 38  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 39 of 61\nmove away, but the officers kept hitting him and spraying him with irritant.  An officer struck \nhim across the back with a baton after he had completely turned around and begun walking \naway.   \n106.  Mr. David was unable to see or move freely as a result of the chemicals deployed \ndirectly in his eyes and face.  He moved away gingerly, walking through a cloud of tear gas, and \nsat down on a park bench, where a volunteer street medic helped him with his injuries before \nlocating an ambulance for him.   \n107.  The ambulance took Mr. David to Portlandโs VA hospital, where he learned that \nhis right hand had been broken in two places as a result of the baton beating from the federal \nofficers.  His ring finger required surgery.  \n108.  At the time of the incident, Mr. David did not know which federal agency \nemployed the officers who beat and gassed him.  Subsequently, however, Kenneth Cuccinelli \n(purportedly Acting Deputy Secretary of the DHS) indicated that officers involved in beating \nMr. David were USMS officers.49   \n109.  Mr. David would like to return to the protests but has not done so because of the \nbeating that he received and the concerns of his family members that he will be further injured if \nhe returns.  โ[S]ometimes I have to listen to better advice from other people,โ he was forced to \n \n49 Deborah Bloom, Navy Veteran Says He Was Beaten โLike a Punching Bagโ in Portland, \nReuters, July 20, 2020, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-portland-\nveteran/navy-veteran-says-he-was-beaten-like-a-punching-bag-in-portland-idUSKCN24L2CP; \nVideo, Navy Vet Says Authorities Beat Him at Portland Protest, CNN (July 21, 2020), \nhttps://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/07/21/portland-protest-chris-david-navy-vet-ken-\ncuccinelli-response-sot-vpx.cnn. \nPage 39  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 40 of 61\nconclude.  โI am 53 and am not indestructible.โ50  In other words, he is fearful of repeated injury \nfor exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest. \n8.  Plaintiff Duston Obermeyer. \n110.  Like Mr. David, Mr. Obermeyer attended the protests outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse for the first time on July 18, 2020.  He was motivated by press reports that federal \nofficers were using excessive force to suppress the protests.  He believed the protesters should be \nfree to express their views in favor of Black Lives Matter and against systemic racismโviews he \nsupported himself.  Mr. Obermeyer was dressed in ordinary clothes with a cotton mask on his \nface.  He was not wearing any protective gear.   \n111.  When Mr. Obermeyer arrived at the protests, he witnessed a large number of \npeople talking and chanting emotionally about Black Lives Matter, police reform, and more \ngeneral government reform.  The protests were generally very peaceful and Mr. Obermeyer did \nnot observe protesters engaged in any actions that would appear to justify a harsh response from \nlaw enforcement. \n112.  At close to 11:00 p.m., as Mr. Obermeyer was standing in Lownsdale Square \nfacing the Hatfield Courthouse, he noticed a commotion on the right side of the front of the \nbuilding.  He then saw a phalanx of federal officers begin marching north towards a group of \nprotesters who were chanting in the middle of SW Third Avenue.  Mr. Obermeyer did not see \nany identification on the officersโ fatigues, but he did note that they were heavily armed, with \nbatons and automatic weapons.   \n \n50 Danielle Zoellner, โThey Just Started Whaling on Meโ: Veteran Speaks Out After Video of \nFederal Officers Beating Him at Portland Protests Goes Viral, The Independent, July 20, 2020, \nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/portland-protests-trump-veteran-\nchristopher-david-federal-officers-oregon-a9627466.html. \nPage 40  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 41 of 61\n113.  Mr. Obermeyer then saw the officers shoot tear gas into the crowd without any \nadvance warning and push a woman to the ground.  The woman was thrown to the ground with \nsuch force that she slid across the pavement.  Mr. Obermeyer saw no provocation for this use of \nforce by the federal officers.   \n114.  Mr. Obermeyer was shocked by what he saw and approached the federal officers \nin front of the Hatfield Courthouse.  While he was standing in SW Third Avenue with his hands \nup in a gesture showing that he meant no harm, Mr. Obermeyer heard a man to his leftโwhom \nhe did not know, but whom he later learned to be Mr. Davidโask the officers if they understood \ntheir oath of office.  They did not respond.  Mr. Obermeyer then repeated Mr. Davidโs question, \nand asked the federal officers whether they understood what an illegal order was.   \n115.  The federal officers did not respond verbally to the questions that either Mr. \nDavid or he had posed, but one of them came up to Mr. David and struck him with a baton.  The \nsame officer then tried to strike Mr. Obermeyer.  Other officers then approached and one pointed \nan automatic weapon in Mr. Obermeyerโs face while another shot him at point-blank range with \nan orange chemical irritant.  One of the officers also struck Mr. Obermeyer in the face and chest \nwith a baton.  A photograph of Mr. Obermeyer being sprayed in the face is set forth below: \n \nPage 41  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 42 of 61\n116.  Mr. Obermeyerโs eyes and nose burned terribly from the chemical and \nimmediately closed up.  The burning spread to every part of his body touched by the chemical.  \nHe was blinded, had difficulty breathing, and required the assistance of other protesters to guide \nhim away and flush out his eyes.  While medics attended to him, he listened to the sounds of \ngunfire, artillery simulation rounds, CS gas canisters being deployed, and protesters screaming.  \nTo Mr. Obermeyer, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it sounded like a combat zone. \n117.  The injuries Mr. Obermeyer suffered initially left him unable to walk.  After some \ntime, he was able to make it a block or so away from the scene where he continued to use eye-\nwash solution and water to flush his eyes and head.  After still more time, he was able to walk to \nhis car, but he still did not feel that he could drive and he called his wife who came and picked \nhim up.  When he got home, Mr. Obermeyer took multiple showers but was unable to completely \nrinse off the chemical that the officers had sprayed on him, which continued to burn his skin and \neyes, as well as the inside of his chest.     \n118.  Mr. Obermeyerโs injuries persisted, and it was three days before he felt well \nenough to resume his normal activities or to return to the protests, which he has only been able to \ndo on a limited basis.  Even in subsequent days, he has continued to have breathing problems and \nfelt pain in his chest and lungs.  He, too, has suffered a fear of repeated injury if he exercises his \nlawful right to peacefully protest. \n9.  Plaintiff James McNulty.  \n119.  Mr. McNulty attended the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse on July 21, \n2020.  He went because he believed that the federal officers were preventing demonstrators from \nexpressing their legitimate grievances about systemic racism.  He wanted to be another voice to \nstand up and say that what was happening is unacceptable.   \nPage 42  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 43 of 61\n120.  Mr. McNulty arrived at the protests shortly after 9:00 p.m.  He saw no vandalism, \nno fires, and nothing being thrown.  The protests were peaceful.   \n121.  At approximately 11:15 p.m., Mr. McNulty was standing with other protesters on \nSW Third Avenue near the intersection with Madison Street when he heard flash-bang grenades.  \nWhen he looked towards the Hatfield Courthouse, he saw federal officers wearing camouflage \nuniforms marching up Main Street towards the intersection with SW Third Avenue, launching \ntear gas cannisters and smoke grenades.  The officers came without any warning, and Mr. \nMcNulty did not hear them issue any orders of any kind.  The group of protesters standing next \nto him began to retreat, and Mr. McNulty followed them as the federal officers advanced up \nMain Street.   \n122.  A flash-bang grenade then went off at Mr. McNultyโs feet, and the area began to \nfill with tear gas, which was blowing towards Mr. McNulty.  To escape from the tear gas, Mr. \nMcNulty moved through the intersection of Main Street and SW Third Avenue, crossing in front \nof the federal officers.  As he crossed the intersection, his eyes and face began to burn.  The \nfederal officers then shot Mr. McNulty four times: three times with rubber bullets and one time \nwith a pepper ball.  He was given no warning and was not disobeying any orders or engaging in \nany violence before he was shot.         \n123.  Mr. McNulty was bleeding, in considerable pain, and unable to move easily.  He \nsought out volunteer medics who could assist him.  The medics provided Mr. McNulty with \nshort-term treatment and sent him to a hospital emergency room.  At the emergency room, Mr. \nMcNulty learned that one of the munitions that struck him in the back had not only gone through \nhis clothes, but pieced his skin, fat layer, and at least one layer of muscle.  The wound was \nsevere enough that Mr. McNulty had to have a CT scan to confirm that it had not punctured his \nPage 43  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 44 of 61\nperitoneal cavity.  A photograph showing two of his wounds taken at the emergency room where \nhe received treatment is set forth below (with personal identifying information redacted): \n \n124.  Mr. McNultyโs injuries caused him considerable pain, suffering, and emotional \ntrauma, as well as medical expenses, and an inability to conduct his daily activities in a normal \nPage 44  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 45 of 61\nmanner during the period of his recovery.  In addition, they have made him fearful of repeated \ninjury for exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest.  \n10.  Plaintiff Black Millennial Movement. \n125.  On June 5, 2020, a group of younger Black citizens in the Portland area gathered \ntogether to create the Black Millennial Movement.  These individuals came together in response \nto the killings of George Floyd and so many other Black citizens at the hands of the police.  With \nnational attention finally being focused on racial justice, these individuals sought to uplift the \nconcerns shared by many Black Millennials, including student debt, economic opportunity, \nhousing and home ownership, and political representation. \n126.  The group was organized by Cameron Whitten, a 29-year old Oregonian, who \ncreated a Facebook group and invited several other young Black leaders in the Portland \ncommunity to join him, including Gregory McKelvey, Shanice Clarke, and Candace Avalos.  \nThe Black Millennial Movement originated in that Facebook group.   \n127.  Traditionally, the press has focused on only one segment of Black leadership; the \nBlack Millennial Movement seeks to provide an alternate voice and educate others about the \ndisproportionate use of force used by law enforcement towards largely nonviolent protestersโa \nperspective that has not traditionally received media attention.   \n128.  Portland-area media, such as television station KATU, have looked to members of \nthe Black Millennial Movement to understand the opinions on the Portland protests held by \nyounger Black leaders in Portland, including how the public pressure caused by the protests is \nforcing local leaders to be more responsive than they have been previously.51 \n \n51 Lincoln Graves, Black Millennial Movement seeks to offer different perspective among Black \nleaders, KATU, July 30, 2020, https://katu.com/news/local/black-millennial-movement-seeks-to-\noffer-different-perspective-among-black-leaders. \nPage 45  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 46 of 61\n129.  Members of the Black Millennial Movement were regular participants in the \nnonviolent protests outside of the Hatfield Courthouse.  While attending those protests, members \nof the Black Millennial Movement have been repeatedly tear-gassed when federal officers \ndeploy tear gas in an effort to disperse the largely peaceful crowds.  Members of the Black \nMillennial Movement have suffered injuries from the tear gas used by the federal officers, \nincluding vomiting, debilitating pain, and irritation to their eyes, skin, and respiratory systems \nlasting nearly a week after the respective protest in which they were inflicted. \n130.  Being subjected to tear-gassing by federal officials further adversely affected \nBlack Millennial Movementโs ability to engage in free speech and to raise its concerns about the \nracial violence and injustice faced by the Black community.  After experiencing the harm caused \nby the tear gas deployed by federal officers and seeing video footage of disproportionate \nviolence deployed against nonviolent protesters on a nightly basis, members of the Black \nMillennial Movement have been fearful of exercising their lawful right to peacefully protest at \nthe Hatfield Courthouse.   \n11.  Plaintiff Rose City Justice, Inc. \n131.  Rose City Justice, Inc. (โRose City Justiceโ) is a Black-led, BIPOC supported, \ngrassroots organization committed to unifying local activism efforts in response to historical \nracial inequities by the justice system.  While Rose City Justice initially operated as an informal \ngroup following the murder of George Floyd, it incorporated as an Oregon nonprofit corporation \nin June 2020.  Rose City Justice has organized peaceful protests in various neighborhoods in \nPortland, including ones in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center and adjacent to the \nHatfield Courthouse, and participated in the Black Lives Matter protests outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse.   \nPage 46  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 47 of 61\n132.  After the presence of federal officers and their use of excessive force against \nprotesters increased in early July, Rose City Justice focused its efforts on providing support and \nsafety equipment to protesters outside the Hatfield Courthouse, including helmets, goggles, and \nmasks.  Its members assisted protesters who were injured by the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, \nand concussion grenades by federal officers against peaceful protesters and were injured \nthemselves by the officersโ tactics.  Several members of Rose City Justice have bruises from \nbeing shot with rubber bullets and experienced the adverse effects of tear gas. \n133.  Being subjected to federal officersโ excessive use of force against protesters \ncaused Rose City Justice to utilize its resources to support the peaceful protesters and deterred \ntheir ability to organize and engage in other protest activities.  The federal officersโ presence in \nPortland also inhibited its ability to advocate for ending racial inequities, especially as it related \nto its efforts to divert funds from the Portland Police Bureau to other community activities \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Fourth Amendment Right Against Unlawful Search and Seizure โ Bivens \nClaim) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in Their Individual Capacities)  \n134.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 133 as though fully set forth herein. \n135.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in their \nindividual capacities.   \n136.  The actions of Defendants Doesโincluding (1) the use of unjustifiable and \nexcessive physical force against Plaintiffs Smiff, Miller, Denison, Healy, David, Obermeyer, and \nMcNulty in an effort to move them from public spaces in which they gathered to express their \nPage 47  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 48 of 61\npolitical opinion and/or in retaliation against Plaintiffs for their viewpoints, (2) the seizure of Mr. \nPettibone without probable cause or a judicially authorized warrant, or, alternatively, (3) the \nextraordinary manner of Mr. Pettiboneโs seizure (an abduction off a public street in the early \nhours of the morning without stated justification by unidentified individuals who emerged from \nan unmarked van, whose clothing did not identify their name or agency or government, who did \nnot identify themselves, and who Congress had not authorized to make warrantless arrests in the \nfirst place)โand the actions of Defendants Wolf and Russell in ordering or approving such \nactions deprived Plaintiffs of their rights to be free from unlawful searches and seizures secured \nto them under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n137.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does acted in clear violation of well-settled law \nwith regard to standards for seizure of which a reasonable law enforcement officer in \nDefendantsโ positions should have been aware.  They are not entitled to qualified or official \nimmunity.   \n138.  The actions of Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does were intentional, malicious, \nand reckless and showed a callous disregard for, or indifference to, the federally protected civil \nrights of Plaintiffs.   \n139.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are jointly and severally liable to Plaintiffs \npursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  Plaintiffs have no adequate alternative remedy. \n140.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful actions of these Defendants, \nPlaintiffs are entitled to recover damages from Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does, and each of \nthem.   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nPage 48  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 49 of 61\n(Violation of First Amendment (Violation of Freedom of Speech and Assembly))  \n(Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice Against Individual \nDefendants Wolf and Russell and Does in Their Official Capacities)  \n141.  Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice hereby reallege and \nincorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 140 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n142.  The actions of Defendants Wolf and Russell in ordering and/or approving the \nindiscriminate use of excessive force against Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose \nCity Justice and their members as set forth aboveโviolated and threatens to continue to violate \nthe First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and assembly of Plaintiffs Black Millennial \nMovement and Rose City Justice and their members.   \n143.  Defendants Wolf and Russellโs actions were based on the viewpoint being \nexpressed by Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City Justiceโs members.  But for \ntheir nonviolent participation in the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse in support of Black Lives \nMatter and against police violence towards Black Americans.  Defendants would not have \nordered the indiscriminate deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents, flash-bangs, and \nless-lethal impact munitions and caused injury to Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City \nJusticeโs members.   \n144.  Defendantsโ actions of ordering and/or approving violence and/or deployment of \ntear gas and other chemical agents, flash-bangs, and impact munitions against protesters, \nincluding members of Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice, in retaliation \nagainst Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City Justicesโ membersโ expression of \ntheir viewpoints and exercise of their First Amendment rights.  Based on Defendantsโ past \nactions and the continued presence of federal law enforcement officials deployed as part of \nPage 49  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 50 of 61\nโOperation Diligent Valor,โ Defendants are reasonably likely to take similar actions in the \nfuture.   \n145.  By depriving Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice of the \nopportunity to express their views and retaliating against them and their members on the basis of \ntheir views, Defendants have violated Plaintiff Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City \nJusticesโ First Amendment rights and are imposing ongoing irreparable harm upon Plaintiffs.  \nPlaintiff Black Millennial Movementsโ effectiveness as an organization will be irreparably \nharmed by its inability to generate participation at protest events because potential participants \nwill have been deterred from participation by the threat of unjustified use of violence and/or tear \ngas.  Rose City Justiceโs ability to advocate for racial justice and to advance its mission was \nirreparably harmed by forcing it to divert resources to protect its members and supporters at \nprotests in front of the Hatfield Courthouse and preventing it from engaging in free speech and \nassembly, in responses to Defendantsโ practices. \n146.  The Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin violations of federal law by \nfederal officials.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320 (2015).   \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unlawful Agency Action Exceeding Statutory Authority Under  \n40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 โ 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 702, 706) \n(Plaintiff Pettibone Against Defendants Wolf and Russell in Their Official Capacities, and \nDHS and USMS) \n147.  Mr. Pettibone hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 146 as if fully set forth herein.   \n148.  The arrest of Mr. Pettibone was pursuant to a policy adopted by Defendants DHS, \nUSMS, Wolf and Russell. \nPage 50  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 51 of 61\n149.  The policy pursuant to which Mr. Pettibone was arrested is an agency action, \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 551. \n150.  The policy pursuant to which Mr. Pettibone was arrested is a final action, ripe for \njudicial review, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 704. \n151.  Federal government officials have issued statements approving of the policy \nleading to the arrest of Mr. Pettibone.   \n152.  Defendants DHS, USMS Wolf, Russell, and Defendant Does, acting pursuant to \nthe policy they had put in place, had no statutory authority to arrest Mr. Pettibone without a \nwarrant, as set forth below. \na.  There has been no valid designation of Defendants Does for duty in \nPortland in connection with the protection of property owned or occupied by the federal \ngovernment or persons on such property pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(1) because \nDefendant Wolf lacked the authority to make that designation and his purported \ndesignation has no force or effect.    \nb.  The arrest of Mr. Pettibone by Defendants Does occurred blocks away \nfrom the Hatfield Courthouse and beyond the geographic limit of โareas outside the \npropertyโ within the meaning of 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(1).   \nc.  Defendants Does patrol of the area where they arrested Mr. Pettibone, \nblocks away from the Hatfield Courthouse, was beyond โthe extent necessary to protectโ \nthe property or persons on the property within the meaning of 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(1). \nd.  Employees of DHS, including Defendants Does, do not possess any power \nunder 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2) to make warrantless arrests, let alone warrantless arrests \nwithout probable cause that a crime has been committed, while off the federal property.  \nPage 51  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 52 of 61\ne.  Mr. Pettibone did not commit a federal offense in the presence of \nDefendants Does. \nf.  Defendants Does did not have โreasonable grounds,โ within the meaning \nof 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2)(C), to believe that Mr. Pettibone had committed or was \ncommitting a felony under the laws of the United States. \ng.  Even assuming Defendants Does had โreasonable groundsโ within the \nmeaning of 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2)(C), to believe that Mr. Pettibone had committed or \nwas committing a felony under the laws of the United States, such โreasonable groundsโ \ndo not constitute probable cause sufficient to justify an arrest. \n153.  The policy that led to the arrest of Mr. Pettibone was an agency action (a) not in \naccordance with law, (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity, (c) in \nexcess of statutory authority, and/or (d) without observance of procedure required by law. \n154.  The Court should hold the policy that led to the arrest of Mr. Pettibone to be \nunlawful. \n155.  As a direct and proximate cause of his arrest, Mr. Pettibone has suffered legal \nwrong and/or was aggrieved and is realistically threatened by a repetition of Defendantsโ \nunlawful acts.  \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unlawful Agency Action by Deployment of Force Against Protesters Exceeding Authority \nUnder 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 โ 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 702, 706) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf and Russell in Their Official Capacities, and DHS and USMS) \n156.

Defendants Does deployed force to arrest Mr. Pettibone and others \nwithout the authority or grounds to make any such arrest. \n161.  The policy of deploying excessive force against Plaintiffs was an agency action \n(a) not in accordance with law, (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity, (c) in excess of statutory authority, and/or (d) without observance of procedure \nrequired by law. \n162.

The actions of Defendants in (a) ordering and/or approving the arrest of Mr. \nPettibone and (b) the search of his belonging while in federal custody, both of which were done \nwithout probable cause or pursuant to any applicable exception under the Fourth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution, violated Mr. Pettiboneโs rights to be free from unlawful searches \nand seizures.   \nPage 54  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 55 of 61\n166.

Plaintiffs bring this claim against Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in their \nindividual capacities.   \n175.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does conspired together to deprive Plaintiffs of \ntheir civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3).   \n176.  The conspiracy included those involved in ordering and executing โOperation \nDiligent Valorโ and conducting law enforcement actions in connection with that operation, \nincluding Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does.   \n177.  The conspirators engaged in overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, including, \nbut not limited to, using excessive force against civil rights activists outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse and in the surrounding area between July 4, 2020 and July 29, 2020, including \nshooting them in the head and body with impact munitions and pepper balls, spraying them \ndirectly in the face with pepper spray, shoving them to the ground, hitting and beating them with \nbatons, firing massive clouds of tear gas at them, and, in some instances, arresting and detaining \nthem without any lawful basis.  \n178.  The conspiracy targeted Black Americans and their supporters, who were \nprotesting on behalf of Black Lives Matter and in opposition to disproportionate police violence \nagainst Black Americans.  Both groups are protected classes under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3).  \nPage 56  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 57 of 61\n179.  Defendants Wolf and Russell directed the conspiracy to take these actions \nbecause of their adverse effects upon an identifiable groupโnamely, civil rights activists \nprotesting on behalf of Black Lives Matter and in opposition to Defendants Wolf, Russell, and \nDoes. \n180.  The conspiracy targeted Plaintiffsโ protected First Amendment activities because \nDefendants held animus towards Plaintiffsโ viewpoints as reflected in, but not limited to, the \npublic statements of Defendants Trump and Wolf.  The violent actions of the conspirators \ndirectly interfered with Plaintiffsโ protected First Amendment activities. \n181.  The conspiracy violently interfered with Plaintiffsโ rights to use public \naccommodations, and therefore their right to be free from the badges and incidents of slavery.  \nLownsdale Square, SW Third Avenue, and the surrounding environs are places of public \naccommodation.   \n182.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are liable in their individual capacities under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3) for damages.    \n183.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are liable for punitive damages due to their \nwillfully or recklessly depriving Plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws and/or equal \nprivileges and immunities under the laws. \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1986 (Failure to Prevent a Conspiracy to Deprive Rights)) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in Their Individual Capacities) \n184.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 183 as if fully set forth herein.   \nPage 57  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 58 of 61\n185.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1986 by failing to meet \ntheir duty to prevent or aid in preventing a conspiracy to deprive civil rights.   \n186.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does knew that a Section 1985 violation was about \nto occur or was occurring, had the power to prevent or aid in preventing it, and neglected or \nrefused to prevent or aid in preventing it. \n187.  As set forth above, the Section 1985 conspiracy consisted of using excessive force \nagainst civil rights activists outside the Hatfield Courthouse and in the surrounding area between \nJuly 4, 2020 and July 29, 2020, including shooting them in the head and body with impact \nmunitions and pepper balls, spraying them directly in the face with pepper spray, shoving them \nto the ground, hitting and beating them with batons, firing massive clouds of tear gas at them, \nand, in some instances, arresting and detaining them without any lawful basis, for the purpose of \ndepriving them of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, \nand Does knew such violence was planned and could have taken actions to stop or limit that \nviolence.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does willfully or negligently took no such action. \n188.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does could have and should have refused to issue \nor comply with unlawful orders, refused to use unlawful force against Plaintiffs, refused to order \nor allow officers under their command to carry out unlawful acts against Plaintiffs, and/or \nattempted to appeal to superiors to take a different course of action. \n189.  As a result of Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Doesโ failure to prevent the \nSection 1985 conspiracy, Plaintiffs were injured and their rights were violated. \n190.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does acted with reckless or callous indifference to \nthe federally protected rights of Plaintiffs and are therefore liable for punitive damages. \nPage 58  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 59 of 61\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court:   \n1.

Issue a declaration that Defendantsโ unlawful arrest of Mr. Pettibone violated the \nFourth Amendment;  \n6.  Enjoin Defendants to inform Mr. Pettibone whether Defendants maintain records \nrelating to his unlawful arrest, including without limitation, photographs, notes \nPage 59  -  COMPLAINT \n107810438.1 0099880-01343  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 1    Filed 08/26/20    Page 60 of 61\nand/or records of the arrest, and any information collected from Mr. Pettiboneโs \ncell phone;  \n7.

(collectively, โPlaintiffsโ), for their Amended Complaint against the named \ndefendants (โDefendantsโ), allege as follows: \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \n1.  Plaintiffs are individual Oregonians or, in the case of Black Millennial Movement \nand Rose City Justice, Inc., associations of individual Oregonians who lawfully participated in \nprotests in Portland, Oregon directed against systemic racism and police violence towards Black \nAmericans following the Minneapolis Police killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020.  This \naction arises out of Defendantsโ unlawful attempts to crush Black protesters and their supporters \nthrough the use of excessive force and illegal detentions against Plaintiffs in violation of their \nrights under the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution as well as \nfederal statutory law.     \n2.  As part of a federal mission known as โOperation Diligent Valor,โ spurred by \nPresident Donald J. Trump and directed by the purported Acting Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security (โDHSโ) Chad Wolf, the federal government deployed more \nPage 2  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 3 of 84\nthan a hundred federal law enforcement officers or agents employed by a variety of federal \nagencies in an alleged effort to โquellโ the protests, which were occurring near the Mark O. \nHatfield Federal Courthouse (the โHatfield Courthouseโ) in the center of Portland.  Such federal \nlaw enforcement officials, heavily armed and clad in military-type camouflage or dark uniforms, \nindiscriminately used violent tactics on lawful protesters, including shooting them in the head \nand body with impact munitions and pepper balls, spraying them directly in the face with pepper \nspray, shoving them to the ground, hitting and beating them with batons, firing massive clouds of \ntear gas at them, and, in some instances, arresting and detaining them without any lawful basis.  \nThe federal agencies or divisions and their leaders and employees responsible for this conduct \nare the Defendants in this action.   \n3.  Defendantsโ actions in support of โOperation Diligent Valorโ manifestly violated \nPlaintiffsโ rights enshrined in the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution:  the rights to peaceful assembly, to freedom of speech, and to freedom from \nunwarranted governmental seizures.     \n4.  Defendantsโ actions also violated federal statutory law for at least four reasons:   \na.  First, โOperation Diligent Valorโ and the actions undertaken in Portland \nby federal officers were not legally authorized.  Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(a), the \nActing Secretary of DHS has limited statutory authority to designate DHS employees to \nโprotect the buildings, grounds, and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the \nFederal Government . . . and the persons on the property.โ  Defendant Wolf, however, \nhad no such authority, nor did any DHS employee purporting to exercise delegated \nauthority on his behalf, because neither Defendant Wolf nor the prior individual who \npurported to serve in the role of Acting Secretary of DHS were properly serving as the \nPage 3  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 4 of 84\nActing Secretary of DHS under the requirements of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, \n6 U.S.C. ยง 113(g), and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. ยง 3348.  As a result, \nDefendant Wolf and other DHS officials had no authority whatsoever to designate \nemployees under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 and the designation of DHS officers pursuant to \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ was null and void.   \nb.  Second, even assuming Defendant Wolf or someone purporting to exercise \ndelegated authority on his behalf had possessed the authority to designate officers \npursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, the federal officers deployed to Portland were not \ndesignated by the memoranda on which Defendants rely. \nc.  Third, even assuming federal officers had been validly designated \npursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, the federal officers deployed to Portland exceeded the \nscope and terms of the designation by acting off federal property and/or by using force \nprior to the training that was a prerequisite for an officer to utilize the designated \nauthority.   \nd.  Fourth, even assuming the officers deployed to Portland had been validly \ndesignated under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 and had acted within the scope and terms of that \ndesignation, the DHS officers conducting the operation exceeded their limited powers \nunder 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, which does not allow making warrantless arrests or taking \nactions such as detaining individuals or suppressing protests in locations that are away \nfrom, or not required to protect, federal property.   \n5.  Defendantsโ conduct and โOperation Diligent Valorโ reflect Defendantsโ broader \npolicy of violating Plaintiffsโ First and Fourth Amendment rights through the use of excessive \nforce and illegal detentions. \nPage 4  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 5 of 84\n6.  Although Plaintiffs seek relief from actions undertaken by the Trump \nAdministration, protests in support of racial justice and against systemic racism and police \nviolence towards Black Americans will continue after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is inaugurated as \npresident on January 20, 2021.  So will protests against other federal policies or actions.  The use \nof force by federal officers against protesters thus affects protesters, including Plaintiffs, after the \nBiden Administration takes over the reins of power. \n7.  Plaintiffs are now asking the Court to protect them and vindicate their rights by \ndeclaring Defendantsโ actions unlawful, entering appropriate injunctive relief, and awarding \nthem economic damages for the violation of their constitutional rights. \nII.  PARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs.   \n8.  Plaintiff Mark Pettibone is a 30-year-old resident of Maricopa County, Arizona, \nand a citizen of the United States.

Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  He participated \nwith Defendant Wolf and others in setting in motion and causing deployment of โOperation \nDiligent Valorโ during 2020, as well as in acquiescing in and ratifying the unconstitutional and \nPage 7  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 8 of 84\nunlawful actions of DHS and other federal government employees as part of that operation and \npursuant to an unconstitutional policy.  He is sued in his official capacity.   \n19.  Defendant Chad F. Wolf is a government official who purports to serve as the \nActing Secretary of DHS; however, he was not properly designated to that position in \naccordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. ยง 113(g).  He participated in \nsetting in motion, causing, and supervising โOperation Diligent Valor,โ causing DHS employees \nto be supposedly designated to serve in that operation, and acquiescing in, ratifying, and failing \nto terminate the unconstitutional and unlawful actions of such employees pursuant to an \nunconstitutional policy as set forth below.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.   \n20.  On information and belief, Defendant Wolf knew or reasonably should have \nknown that โOperation Diligent Valorโ would cause and was causing the arrests of protesters and \nthe repeated use of excessive force against protesters described herein.  Defendant Wolf was \npersonally involved in negotiations with state and local officials about the deploying of federal \nofficers in Portland, including phone calls that he made to the mayor of Portland and the \ngovernor of Oregon on July 14, 2020.  He also visited the Hatfield Courthouse in person on July \n16, 2020, and met there with Portland Police Bureau officers and federal officers who were \nconfronting protesters nightly.  Defendant Wolf spoke repeatedly to the press about the unfolding \nevents in Portland, including in media interviews during the month of July 2020, and during a \npress conference on July 21, 2020.  He also testified on August 6, 2020, before the U.S. Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (โSenate Committeeโ) about the \nfederal response to the protests in Portland.  In both his statements to the press and in his \ntestimony to the Senate Committee, Defendant Wolf represented himself as being knowledgeable \nabout the actions of DHS officers towards demonstrators in Portland.  Indeed, he went so far as \nPage 8  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 9 of 84\nto label news coverage of the federal officers as false in certain respects, including specifically \ndenying that officers were stormtroopers, denying that DHS was acting against peaceful \nprotesters, denying that the officersโ clothing made them unidentifiable, and denying that the \nfederal agencies were the cause of the violence.  Defendant Wolf thereby indicated both that he \nwas reviewing independent media reports of events in Portland and that he believed he possessed \nsuperior knowledge of federal officersโ actions.   \n21.  Defendant Wolf publicly supported and failed to terminate the arrests and use of \nforce by federal officers in Portland.  Despite his awareness of the unlawful arrests of protesters \nand the repeated use of excessive force against them, he knowingly failed to order any change in \ntactics or response to avoid constitutional injury to peaceful protestors such as Plaintiffs.  As of \nAugust 6, 2020, he had not suspended, terminated, or disciplined any DHS employee for actions \nagainst protesters in Portland.  On information and belief, he failed to recommend or initiate \ndiscipline for any federal officers who arrested or used force against protesters in Portland.  \nDefendant Wolf knowingly failed or refused to terminate DHS employeesโ unlawful arrests and \nuse of excessive force with knowledge or in deliberate disregard of the risk that his inaction \nwould cause federal officers to inflict constitutional injuries on Plaintiffs.           \n22.  Defendant Gabriel Russell is the Regional Director for Region 10 of the Federal \nProtective Service (โFPSโ), which is an agency housed within DHS, where it is responsible for \nprotection of federal property.  He commanded the DHS Rapid Deployment Force for \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ in Portland and is responsible for the actions of the federal \nemployees who conducted that operation and acted pursuant to an unconstitutional policy and \nwho, upon information and belief, currently remain stationed in the Pacific Northwest and the \nPortland, Oregon, area.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities.   \nPage 9  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 10 of 84\n23.  Defendant Russellโs job duties include ensuring that the officers in the DHS \nRapid Deployment Force for โOperation Diligent Valorโ in Portland comply with applicable law, \nstandards, and practices and that they do not use excessive force.  On information and belief, he \nknew or reasonably should have known that no DHS employees were identified by the purported \ndesignations pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 that were signed by FPS Director Eric Patterson.  On \ninformation and belief, he knew or reasonably should have known the terms and scope of the \npurported designations pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 of DHS employees who participated in the \nDHS Rapid Deployment Force for โOperation Diligent Valorโ in Portland.     \n24.  Defendant Russell has tactical control of the DHS Rapid Deployment Force in \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ in Portland, including officers from FPS, United States Customs and \nBorder Protection (โCBPโ), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ).  \nBeginning on July 4, 2020, he implemented tactics that included identifying and arresting \nindividual protesters.  According to a July 21, 2020 statement by Mark Morgan, then-Acting \nCommissioner of CBP, while a โmultitudeโ of federal agencies were involved in the arrests, \nevery arrest was coordinated by a unified command under FPS leadership.1       \n25.  On information and belief, Defendant Russell knew or reasonably should have \nknown that officers in the DHS Rapid Deployment Force for โOperation Diligent Valorโ in \nPortland would cause and were causing the arrests of protesters and the repeated use of excessive \nforce against protesters described herein.  During at least the period from July 12, 2020 through \nJuly 29, 2020, Defendant Russell personally observed protesters in Portland and the actions of \nfederal officers from an incident command post or an emergency operations center.  He also \n \n1 DHS/CBP Press Conference (July 21, 2020), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2112&v=2XTYITCtFlc&feature=youtu.be.   \nPage 10  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 11 of 84\nmonitored social media and reviewed publicly available videos showing events at the protests.  \nHe was aware of the use of force against protesters by federal officers, including but not limited \nto the use of force against Plaintiff Christopher David.  On information and belief, he also \ndirected and was aware of the arrests of protesters, including Plaintiff Mark Pettibone.   \n26.  Despite his awareness of the unlawful arrests of protesters and the repeated use of \nexcessive force against them, Defendant Russell knowingly failed to order any change in tactics \nor response to avoid unconstitutional injury to peaceful protestors such as Plaintiffs.  On \ninformation and belief, Defendant Russell failed to take action to stop the arrests and use of \nexcessive force by federal officers or the arrests and use of force by DHS officers who were not \ndesignated by the purported 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 designations or whose actions exceeded the terms \nand scope of the purported designations.  On information and belief, he failed to recommend or \ninitiate discipline for federal officers who unlawfully arrested or used excessive force against \nprotesters in Portland.  Defendant Wolf knowingly failed or refused to terminate DHS \nemployeesโ unlawful arrests and use of excessive force with knowledge or in deliberate disregard \nof the risk that his actions and omissions would cause federal officers to inflict constitutional \ninjuries on Plaintiffs. \n27.  Defendants Does 1-200 (โDefendant Doesโ) are unknown officers, agents, or \ncontract employees of DHS and/or the United States Marshals Service (โUSMSโ) deployed to \nPortland under color of federal authority as part of or in connection with โOperation Diligent \nValorโ and pursuant to an unconstitutional policy.  They are not readily identifiable because they \nfrequently acted in groups and wore uniforms, helmets, and/or other clothing without obvious \nidentifying information.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Portland Protests and the Federal Deployment of โOperation Diligent Valor.โ \n33.  Just after 8:00 p.m. on May 25, 2020, Minneapolis Police officers killed George \nFloyd, a 46-year-old African American man.  Mr. Floyd was arrested on suspicion of his \ninvolvement in a nonviolent offense.  After he was handcuffed and fell to the pavement, a police \nofficer kneeled on Mr. Floydโs neck with the weight of his body.  For eight minutes and 46 \nseconds, the officer held his knee on Mr. Floydโs neck as Mr. Floyd pleaded for relief, until he \nwas killed.  Other officers held his legs or stood by and watched.   \n34.  The video of Mr. Floydโs murderโcoupled with the nationโs long history of \npolice killings of a disproportionately large number of Black Americansโtriggered a series of \nprotests opposing rampant police violence against Black Americans and supporting Black Lives \nMatter across the county, including in Portland, Oregon.   \n35.  Beginning on or about May 29, 2020, protesters took to the streets of Portland in \nlarge numbers.  These protests had continued for more than 80 consecutive nights as of the \ncommencement of this action and have included regular protests in the city parks and streets that \nsurround the Hatfield Courthouse and the Multnomah County Justice Center. \n36.  As the protests developed, Defendant Wolf quickly denied that there was any \nsystemic racism among law enforcement officers in this country.4  Likewise, over the course of \nthe month following Mr. Floydโs tragic death, Defendant Trump issued multiple statements \ndenouncing the protests in various cities and threatening to use federal forces to crush them.  For \n \n4 See, e.g., CBS This Morning, Acting Trump Cabinet member Chad Wolf denies systemic racism \nexists in police departments (June 17, 2020) (interview with Chad Wolf), \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/video/acting-trump-cabinet-member-chad-wolf-denies-systemic-\nracism-exists-in-police-departments/#x.  \nPage 13  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 14 of 84\nexample, on May 29, 2020, three days after the protests began in Minneapolis, Defendant Trump \nissued a tweet stating, โEither the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together \nand bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.โ5  \nHe continued, โAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the \nshooting starts.โ6  Similarly, on June 3, 2020, he claimed in a televised broadcast interview with \nSean Spicer โthe nation needs law and order because you have a bad group of people out there, \nand theyโre using George Floyd, and theyโre using a lot of other people to try and do some bad \nthings,โ and that โsuper liberal mayorsโ were undermining local law enforcement, requiring his \nadministration to bring in the National Guard.7 \n37.  On June 26, 2020, as the protests in Portland and elsewhere continued, Defendant \nTrump went further, issuing an Executive Order on Protecting American Monuments, \nMemorials, and Statutes and Combating Recent Criminal Violence (โExecutive Orderโ).8  The \nExecutive Order blamed โleft-wing extremistsโ for โadvanc[ing] a fringe ideology that paints the \nUnited States of America as fundamentally unjust and have sought to impose that ideology on \nAmericans through violence and mob intimidation.โ9  In addition, it directed the Secretary of \nDHS to provide โpersonnel to assist with the protection of Federal monuments, memorials, \nstatues, or property.โ10 \n \n5 Donald J.

The Executive Order reflected Defendant Trumpโs consistent policy of defending \nracist monuments and institutions and attacking individuals who seek to dismantle them as \nlawless extremists.  For example, in a press conference on August 15, 2017, Defendant Trump \ncriticized protesters who sought to confront white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups opposing the \nremoval of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia as โalt-leftโ groups who were \nโvery, very violent,โ suggesting that both sides were to blame for the clash, even though the \nprincipal violence was by a right-wing extremist who killed a woman by driving his car into \nher.11  Two days later, on August 17, 2017, Defendant Trump issues a tweet railing against those \nwho sought to remove Confederate statues, saying โSad to see the history and culture of our \ngreat country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.  \nYouโฆcanโt change history but you can learn from it.  Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson-whoโs \nnext, Washington, Jefferson?  So foolish!โ12  Similarly, on July 6, 2020, Defendant Trump \nmounted a defense of the Confederate flag and suggested NASCAR had made a mistake in \nbanning it at racing events while accusing a well-known Black race driver, Darrell Wallace, Jr., \nof perpetrating a hoax involving a noose found in his garage.13   \n39.

In accordance with his announcement, Defendant Wolf, FPS Director L. Eric \nPatterson, and other DHS officials created and sent a Rapid Deployment Force to Portland in \nadvance of the July 4, 2020 holiday weekend as part of what they termed โOperation Diligent \nValor.โ16  Defendant Wolf himself later confirmed to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs that he had directed additional federal personnel to \nPortland.17  The Rapid Deployment Force, which was directed by Defendant Russell, was \ncomposed of approximately 114 CBP and ICE officers.

Many of these unlawful actions were captured on video or photographed by the \nnews media or other protesters as they occurred.  For example, on Saturday, July 11, 2020, \nOregon Public Broadcasting (โOPBโ) published a video showing federal law enforcement \nofficers shooting a 26-year-old protester, Donovan LaBella, in the head with impact munitions.  \nAt the time Mr. LaBella was shot, he was standing across the street from the Hatfield Courthouse \nprotesting while holding a music speaker above his head.21  As a result of that shooting, \nMr. LaBella suffered severe injuries; he was initially in critical condition upon admission to a \nhospital with a skull fracture, and he subsequently had facial reconstruction surgery for his \ninjuries.   \n45.

For example, as early as \nJuly 6, 2020, Defendant Wolf publicly asserted that โthis is no longer about peaceful protesting,โ \nand Defendant Trump promptly amplified Defendant Wolfโs statement by quoting it in a tweet.32  \nOn July 13, 2020, two days after Mr. LaBellaโs shooting, Defendant Trump lauded federal \nauthorities for doing โa great jobโ in Portland.33  He stated that โPortland was totally out of \ncontrol . . . .  [A]nd we very much quelled it, and if it starts again, weโll quell it again very \neasily.โ34   \n50.  Similarly, on July 16, 2020, Defendant Wolf issued a statement while visiting \nPortland in which he referred to Portlandโs demonstrators as โlawless anarchistsโ and a โviolent \nmob,โ and stated that โlocal and state leaders are . . . focusing on placing blame on law \nenforcement and requesting fewer officers in their community.โ35  In response to what he \ncharacterized as an invitation for DHS to pack up and go home, Defendant Wolf was blunt:  \nโThatโs just not going to happen on my watch.โ36 \n \n32 Joshua Nelson, DHS Secretary Wolf says 'criminal mobs' taking over cities, not peaceful \nprotesters, Fox News (July 6, 2020) (Chad Wolf interview with Fox & Friends), \nhttps://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-criminal-mobs-are-taking-over-cities-\nfederal-provide-assistance; Donald J.

The next day, July 17, 2020, Defendant Wolf posted a photo on Twitter of federal \nagents in camouflage within the Hatfield Courthouse, writing that โ[w]e will never surrender to \nviolent extremists on my watchโ; he later removed the post.37   \n52.  One day later, on July 18, 2020, Defendant Trump issued a Twitter post, stating, \nโWe are trying to help Portland, not hurt it . . . .  Their leadership has, for months, lost control of \nthe anarchists and agitators.  They are missing in action.  We must protect Federal property, \nAND OUR PEOPLE.  These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal!โ38   \n53.  On July 20, 2020, Defendant Trump again criticized Portland as โtotally out of \ncontrol . . . the liberal Democrats running the place had no idea what they were doing.โ  He went \nstill further, threatening to deploy federal law enforcement officers to other cities run by โliberal \nDemocrats,โ specifically New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, and Oakland.  He \nportrayed those cities as out of control, characterizing them as โrun by very liberal Democrats.  \nAll run, really, by radical left.โ39   \n54.  At a press conference on July 21, 2020, Defendant Wolf specifically endorsed the \npractice of snatching protesters off the streets.

In late July, the Director of USMS, Donald Washington, parroted Defendant \nWolfโs characterization of the Portland protests as being riddled with anarchy and violence.  In \nan interview with Fox News, Director Washington ventured that the peaceful protest โin many \nrespects, has been hijacked by violent extremists who have no intent to arrive at any solution \nother than to continue to create chaos.โ41 \n56.  Defendant Wolf again endorsed DHS employeesโ conduct before the U.S. Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on August 6, 2020.  He asserted \nthat DHS โhad to start making arrests.โ42 \n57.  Defendant Wolf also suggested that individuals could be deemed violent merely \nbecause they were present near the Hatfield Courthouse.  On August 6, 2020, in his testimony to \nthe U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, he referred to \nviolence allegedly having occurred at the Hatfield Courthouse on multiple nights and asserted \nthat โyou know if you come there, thatโs what youโre coming to do.โ  He categorically stated that \nโsomeone showing upโ late at night โis not a peaceful protester.โ43      \n \n40 DHS/CBP Press Conference, supra note 1, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2112&v=2XTYITCtFlc&feature=youtu.be. \n41 Julia Musto, US Marshals Service Director Says Portland Protests โHijacked By Violent \nExtremists,โ Fox News Flash, July 29, 2020, https://www.foxnews.com/media/us-marshals-\nservice-director-says-portland-protests-hijacked-by-violent-extremists. \n42 Oversight of DHS Personnel Deployments to Recent Protests: Hearing Before U.S. Senate \nComm. on Homeland Sec. & Governmental Affairs, supra note 17, \nhttps://www.hsgac.senate.gov/oversight-of-dhs-personnel-deployments-to-recent-protests. \n43 Id. \nPage 23  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 24 of 84\nC.  Portland Police Assist Federal Forces in Suppressing Protesters. \n58.  Notwithstanding concerns expressed by Portlandโs elected officials, city police \ncooperated closely with federal forces deployed in Portland through at least July 22, 2020.  The \nPortland Police Bureau acknowledged through a spokesperson on July 4, 2020, that the Portland \nPolice Bureau was โcoordinate[ing] as neededโ with federal agencies.44  Portland Police Bureau \nDeputy Chief Chris Davis subsequently admitted that an FPS officer was present in the Portland \nPolice Bureauโs command post during demonstrations.  He also reported that the Portland Police \nBureau offered suggestions to the federal forces.  Portland Police Chief Lovell similarly \nconfirmed the โline of communicationโ with federal agencies.     \n59.  The Portland Police Bureau has a long history of shooting and killing unarmed \nBlack people.  For example, in 2003, 21-year-old Kendra James was shot by police during a \ntraffic stop.  In 2010, 25-year-old Aaron Campbell was killed by a police sharpshooter during a \nwelfare check.  In 2017, officers shot 17-year-old Quanice Hayes with an AR-15 while he was \non his knees during an arrest.  Prosecutors did not bring charges in any of these cases.  \nMoreover, the U.S. Department of Justice has supervised the Portland Police Bureau for much of \nthe past decade for engaging in a pattern or practice of excessive force against the mentally ill, in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.  Many of those targeted by the Portland Police Bureau were \nBlack.  For example, Andre Gladen, a legally blind 36-year-old Black man with schizophrenia, \n \n44 K.

Instead of removing him from the \nporch, officers killed him after, they say, he grabbed an officerโs knife.45  \n60.  Eighty percent of Portland Police Bureau officers are white, and the bureau \ncontinues to be linked to white supremacy. In 2010, the Portland Police Bureau had to discipline \nan officer for having erected plaques celebrating Nazi-era German soldiers in a public park.  \nIncredibly, the officer kept his job.  And more recently, in 2019, an officer was discovered \nsending texts to Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson, advising right-wing agitators how to avoid \narrest.  There is no question that the Portland Police Bureau is rife with racial animus against \nBlack persons and people of color.46 \n61.  On July 16, 2020, when Defendant Wolf visited Portland, he met personally with \nPortland Police Association President Daryl Turner.  Officer Turner said that his main objective \nin the meeting was to have the federal officers โworking alongside PPB Chief Lovell in \nconjunction with and communicating with him and his command staff.โ47  Officer Turner had \nalready publicly claimed that the demonstrations were โno longer about George Floyd, social \njustice, or police reformโ and labeled the protesters as โdefin[ing] the meaning of white \nprivilege.โ48   \n \n45 Tim Dickinson, RS Reports:  Progressive City, Brutal Police, Rolling Stone, July 17, 2020, \nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/portand-oregon-police-brutality-history-\n1027677/. \n46 Id. \n47 Rebecca Ellis, Portland Police Union Head Met with Federal Official Snubbed by City \nLeaders, OPB.org, July 17, 2020, https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-police-union-head-\nmet-dhs-head-chad-wolf/. \n48 Press Release, Portland Police Association, This Cannot Continue, (July 6, 2020) (statement \nby Daryl Turner, President), https://www.ppavigil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/07062020-\nThis-Cannot-Continue.pdf.  \nPage 25  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 26 of 84\n62.  On information and belief, at least five federal officials including Defendant Wolf \nparticipated in the July 16, 2020 meeting with Officer Turner.  On information and belief, \nDefendant Wolf also spoke separately to at least two other Portland Police Bureau officers at the \nHatfield Courthouse that day.     \n63.  The coordination between the federal and local forces manifested in concrete \nassistance provided by the Portland Police Bureau to the federal agencies and officers.  For \nexample, in the early morning hours of July 12, 2020, after federal officers had shot Mr. LaBella \nin the head with impact munitions, the Portland Police Bureau โresponded when federal officers \ncalled for help.โ49  Portland Police Bureau officers were seen talking with USMS officers in \nfront of the Hatfield Courthouse,50 ordered demonstrators to disperse,51 marched shoulder-to-\nshoulder with federal officers to clear the street, and reportedly arrested an individual at the \nbehest of FPS.52   \n64.  On multiple occasions, Portland Police Bureau officers worked together with \nfederal agencies to remove protestors.  Portland Police Bureau officers and federal officers \njointly advanced on protesters on at least July 4, July 12, and July 17, 2020.           \n65.

Continued State and Local Opposition Finally Leads to a Stand Down, but Federal \nOfficers Remain in Portland, Poised to Recommence Operations. \n66.  Despite the statements of Individual Defendants Trump and Wolf supporting \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ and the Policy, state and local leaders continued to press their request \nthat federal law enforcement officers leave Portland.  For example, Portland City Commissioner \nJo Ann Hardesty stated that she was joining โthe loud chorus of elected officials calling for the \nfederal troops in Portlandโs streets to go home . . . . Their presence here has escalated tensions \nand put countless Portlanders exercising their First Amendment rights in greater danger.โ53   \n67.  These calls reflected the widely reported fact that the presence of federal officers \nwas aggravating rather than diffusing tension at the protests and significantly increasing the \nnumber of protesters, many of whom were now protesting against the presence of the federal \nofficers as well as in support of Black Lives Matter and in opposition to police violence against \nBlack Americans.54  Indeed, federal law enforcement officers speaking on the condition of \nanonymity acknowledged to OPB that their actions โcontributed to the quick escalation between \nlaw enforcement and groups of protesters, which had dwindled to a couple hundred people or \nless earlier this month [i.e., before the attack on Mr. LaBella].โ55  Such officers also \n \n53 Katie Shepherd & Mark Berman, โIt Was Like Being Preyed Uponโ: Portland Protesters Say \nFederal Officers in Unmarked Vans Are Detaining Them, Wash.

Against this backdrop, on July 28, 2020, Governor Brown negotiated an \nagreement with Vice President Mike Pence and other senior federal administration officials \nunder which CBP and ICE officers would โleave downtown Portlandโ and Oregon State Police \nwould step in to keep the peace and allow protesters to refocus attention on racial justice and \npolice accountability.57   \n69.  Although federal officials acknowledged this arrangement, they steadfastly \nrefused to commit to a full disengagement.  For example, on July 28, 2020, Defendant Wolf \nacknowledged that Oregon State Police would step in, but informed the nation that DHS โwill \nnot back downโ and โwill continue to maintain our current, augmented federal law enforcement \npersonnel in Portland until we are assured that the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and other federal \nproperties will no longer be attacked and that the seat of justice in Portland will remain \nsecure.โ58  Similarly, on July 29, 2020, Mark A. Morgan, the Acting Senior Official Performing \nthe Duties of the Commissioner for CBP, reiterated that the federal officers โare not leaving \nPortlandโ until DHS deemed that โthe violent criminal activityโ was over.59   \n \n56 Id.  \n57 Governor Kate Brown (@OregonGovBrown), Twitter (July 29, 2020, 8:31 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/OregonGovBrown/status/1288497309848702977.  \n58 Press Release, U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., Acting Secretary Wolfโs Statement on Oregon \nAgreeing to Cooperate in Quelling Portland Violence (July 29, 2020), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/29/acting-secretary-wolfs-statement-oregon-agreeing-\ncooperate-quelling-\nportland?fbclid=IwAR12Gszc5r4WHfv_ngO0BWlck3aDkG6TlZQkAx5j6lHcBfSAmQP9ms6rv\n6g. \n59 CBP Mark Morgan (@CBPMarkMorgan), Twitter (July 29, 2020, 11:33 AM), \nhttps://twitter.com/CBPMarkMorgan/status/1288543305769406465). \nPage 28  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 29 of 84\n70.  Defendant Trump also issued similar statements refusing to disengage.  For \nexample on July 29, 2020, he tweeted that Governor Brown โisnโt doing her jobโ and proclaimed \nthat โ[w]e will not be leaving until there is safety!โ60  The next day, July 30, 2020, he went a step \nfurther, characterized the situation as an โemergency,โ and publicly threatened even further \nescalation if local authorities do not โclean out this beehive of โ of terrorists.  โฆ  If they donโt do \nit, weโll be sending in the National Guard. โฆ  Weโre telling [protesters], right now, that weโre \ncoming in very soon โ the National Guard.โ61  Finally, on July 31, 2020, he tweeted that \nโHomeland Security is not leaving Portland until local police complete cleanup of Anarchists \nand Agitators!โ62 \n71.  Along these same lines, on August 4, 2020, DHS confirmed that although federal \nofficers had not interfered with peaceful protesters during the preceding days, โ[t]here has been \nno reduction in federal presence; federal law enforcement officers remain in Portland at \naugmented levels.โ63  โ[T]he increased federal presence in Portland will remain until [DHS] is \ncertain that federal property is safe.โ64  DHS characterized the situation as โdynamic and \nvolatileโ and stated that โno determination of timetables for reduction of protective forces has yet \nbeen made.โ65  \n \n60 Donald J.

On August 7, 2020, OPB also reported that federal officials speaking off the \nrecord said that some of the forces might be drawn down, depending on how the weekend went, \nbut an elevated force would likely remain in Portland through the November election.66 \n73.  Subsequently, Defendant Trump continued to defend and reward the actions of \nDefendant Wolf and DHS.  On August 21, 2020, Defendant Trump thanked Defendant Wolf \nโvery much,โ commenting that โ[y]ouโre right in the heart of it, and youโve got some very big \nthings coming.  Very big things.  Good job.โ67 \n74.  Defendant Wolf likewise continues to express animosity toward Black Lives \nMatter and to work to marshal federal agencies to act against them.  During a press interview on \nAugust 31, 2020, Defendant Wolf indicated that he was personally talking to the United States \nAttorney General almost on a weekly basis about targeting the heads of Black Lives Matter for \ninvestigations and arrests.68    \n75.  Given these statements, there is a continuing risk that Defendantsโ illegal actions \nwill recommence and an ongoing need to address them through this lawsuit.  The Trump \nAdministrationโs replacement by the Biden Administration on January 20, 2021, does not \ndiminish this risk.  No matter who is president, protests in support of racial justice will continue \nas long as systemic racism is not dismantled, and protesters will continue to face illegal actions \nby the federal government unless they are addressed by the Court.  \n \n66 Conrad Wilson & Jonathan Levinson, Some Federal Forces Poised to Leave Portland, Others \nCould Remain Through Election, OPB, Aug. 7, 2020, \nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2020/08/07/federal-officers-leave-portland-election/. \n67 The White House, Remarks by President Trump at the 2020 Council for National Policy \nMeeting, Aug. 21, 2020, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-\ntrump-2020-council-national-policy-meeting/. \n68 Yael Halon, DOJ โtargeting and investigatingโ leaders, funders of far-left groups and rioters, \nWolf tells Tucker, Fox News (Aug. 31, 2020) (Chad Wolf interview), \nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/chad-wolf-doj-investigating-far-left-rioters.   \nPage 30  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 31 of 84\nE.

In addition to violating Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights, the deployment of federal \nofficers to Portland as part of โOperation Diligent Valorโ was unlawful because Defendant Wolf \nand FPS Director Patterson lacked the authority to designate DHS employees to protect the \nHatfield Courthouse, because the federal officers who were deployed had not been designated by \nthe purported designation, because the federal officersโ actions exceeded the scope and terms of \nthe purported designation, and because the operation was not executed in accordance with the \nfederal statute under which Defendants claimed to be acting.   \n1.

FPS Director Patterson, purporting to exercise the delegated authority of the \nSecretary of DHS, supposedly designated DHS officers to protect the Hatfield Courthouse \npursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, which grants the Secretary of DHS (or properly serving Acting \nSecretary) limited statutory authority to designate DHS employees to โprotect the buildings, \ngrounds, and property that are owned, occupied, or secured by the Federal Government . . . and \nthe persons on the property.โ  This supposed designation on behalf of Defendant Wolf, however, \nwas not lawful, valid, or effective because, among other things, Defendant Wolf was not legally \nserving as the Acting Secretary of DHS when he commenced โOperation Diligent Valor.โ  As a \nresult, he and those purporting to exercise delegated authority on his behalf, including FPS \nDirector Patterson, had and still have no power under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 and there was no lawful \nbasis for the deployment of the Rapid Deployment Force to Portland and DHS employeesโ \nactions alleged herein.   \nPage 31  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 32 of 84\n78.  By way of background, the Secretary of DHS normally is appointed by the \nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.  6 U.S.C. ยงยง 112(a)(1), \n113(a)(1)(A).  In the event of a vacancy, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 provides an order \nof succession to fill the position pending the presidential appointment of a replacement.  Id. \nยง 113(g).  Pursuant to this order of succession, the Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary for \nManagement of DHS are next in line to serve in an acting capacity when there is a vacancy.  Id. \nยง 113(g)(1).  Beyond this mandated order, โthe Secretary may designate such other officers of \nthe Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.โ  Id. ยง 113(g)(2). \n79.  Defendant Wolf assumed the role of Acting Secretary through a series of events \nfollowing the resignation of DHS Secretary Kristjen Nielsen on April 10, 2019.  At that time, the \nDeputy Secretary position had been vacant since April 14, 2018, and the Under Secretary for \nManagement had resigned on April 10, 2019.  The list of further successors signed by Secretary \nNielsen on that date, which was set forth in Delegation 00106, Revision No 08.5 (Apr. 10, 2019), \nprovided that vacancies due to the Secretaryโs death, resignation, or inability to perform the \nfunctions of the position were to be filled in the following order: (1) Deputy Secretary, (2) Under \nSecretary for Management, (3) Administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency, and \n(4) Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  \n80.  Although this was the required order of succession, it was not followed.  Instead, \nthe person who purported to assume the Acting Secretary position was Kevin McAleenan, who \nhad been serving as the Commissioner of CBP.  While Mr. McAleenan had been identified in \nDelegation 00106 as a potential successor to Secretary Nielsen in the event of a disaster or \ncatastrophic emergency, he was not properly in line to assume her role in the event of her \nPage 32  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 33 of 84\nresignation.  As a result, Mr. McAleenanโs assumption of the role of Acting Secretary was not \nlawful and all orders that he issued in that capacity are null and void. \n81.  One of the orders that Mr. McAleenan issued while purporting to serve as Acting \nSecretary was Revision 00.3 to DHS Delegation No. 00002, Delegation to the Under Secretary \nfor Management.  This revision purported to delegate to the Under Secretary of Management the \nauthority to designate DHS employees pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315.  In DHS Delegation \nNo. 02500, the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Management \nlater purported to sub-delegate this authority to the Director of the Federal Protective Service, the \noffice currently filled by Mr. Patterson.  FPS Director Patterson subsequently issued memoranda \npurporting to designate DHS employees pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315.  \n82.  Because Mr. McAleenanโs assumption of the role of Acting Secretary was not \nlawful, his attempted delegation of authority to designate DHS employees pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315 was null and void.  All orders and actions by FPS Director Patterson and any other DHS \nofficials purporting to exercise authority delegated by Revision 00.3 to DHS Delegation 00002, \nincluding any sub-delegated authority, should therefore be declared unauthorized and unlawful.  \nAny designation of DHS officers to protect federal property and persons in Portland that relies \non authority supposedly delegated by Revision 00.3 to DHS Delegation 00002, including any \nsub-delegation therefrom, should be declared null and void.   \n83.  Defendant Wolf assumed the position of Acting Secretary following \nMr. McAleenanโs resignation as of November 13, 2019.  Defendant Wolf took the position based \non a new version of Delegation 00106, Revision No. 08.6, that Mr. McAleenan issued on \nNovember 8, 2019, to create a new order of succession.  However, given that Mr. McAleenan \nhad not properly assumed the role of Acting Secretary in the first instance, he lacked the \nPage 33  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 34 of 84\nauthority to modify Delegation 00106, rendering his modifications invalid and making \nDefendant Wolfโs designation as Acting Secretary pursuant to such modifications similarly \ninvalid.  Revision No. 08.6 to Delegation 00106 was further invalid because 6 U.S.C. ยง 113(g)(2) \nauthorizes only the Secretary of DHS, and not an Acting Secretary, to designate other DHS \nofficers in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.    \n84.  Defendant Wolf was also barred at the time from lawfully serving or issuing valid \norders as Acting Secretary by a separate statute, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (โFVRAโ).  \nPursuant to the FVRA, the power of any acting official to perform the functions and duties of the \noffice expires 210 days after the office first became vacant.  5 U.S.C. ยง 3346.  Moreover, if 210 \ndays pass without a Senate-confirmed officer or a nomination for the office, the FVRA requires \nthe office to remain vacant.  Id. ยง 3348(b)(1).  When Mr. McAleenan issued his revision of \nDelegation 00106, under which Defendant Wolf assumed the Acting Secretary role, more than \n210 days had passed since Secretary Nielsen resigned on April 10, 2019, and the President had \nnot appointed a successor.  As a result, even if Mr. McAleenan had properly assumed his \nposition, he lacked the authority to modify Delegation 00106 so that Defendant Wolf could \nbecome Acting Secretary.  Passage of the 210-day deadline also meant that the office had to \nremain open and that it could not be filled with anyone serving in an acting capacity, including \nDefendant Wolf.   \n85.  The invalidity of Defendant Wolfโs claim to serve as Acting Secretary was \nconfirmed on August 14, 2020, in an analysis by the United States Government Accountability \nOffice (โGAOโ).69  The GAO concluded that, for the reasons summarized above, \n \n69 GAO, Decision in the Matter of Department of Homeland SecurityโLegality of Service of \nActing Secretary of Homeland Security and Service of Senior Official Performing the Duties of \nPage 34  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 35 of 84\nMr. McAleenan was the โincorrectโ official to have assumed the title of Acting DHS Secretary \nfollowing the resignation of Secretary Nielsen and that his subsequent amendments to the order \nof succession โwere invalid.โ  As such, Defendant Wolfโs purported assumption of the role was \nโimproperโ and pursuant to โan invalid order of succession.โ   \n86.  Given that Defendant Wolf did not lawfully assume the role of Acting Secretary \nof DHS and that more than 210 days had passed since the office became vacant, he and those \npurporting to exercise delegated authority on his behalf, including FPS Director Patterson, were \nwithout any authority to designate employees of DHS to protect federal property pursuant to 40 \nU.S.C. ยง 1315.  Defendantsโ orders deploying DHS officers to Portland as part of โOperation \nDiligent Valorโ and maintaining such officers in the city and purporting to designate authority to \nthem under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 should therefore be declared unauthorized and unlawful. \n87.  The actions and orders of Kevin McAleenan, Defendant Wolf, and FPS Director \nPatterson alleged herein have not been subsequently ratified.  Indeed, the FVRA prescribes that \nthey โmay not be ratified.โ  5 U.S.C. ยง 3348(d)(2).       \n2.  Even if Defendant Wolf and FPS Director Patterson Had Possessed \nAuthority to Designate Officers, the Federal Officers Deployed in โOperation \nDiligent Valorโ Were Not Designated. \n88.  Even if Defendant Wolf and those purporting to exercise delegated authority on \nhis behalf, including FPS Director Patterson, had possessed authority to designate officers \npursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, the federal officers deployed to Portland as part of โOperation \nDiligent Valorโ were not so designated by the memoranda on which Defendants rely.  Copies of \nthese memoranda signed by FPS Director Patterson are attached as Exhibits 1-10 hereto. \n \nDeputy Secretary of Homeland Security, File No. B-331650 (Aug. 14, 2020), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708830.pdf.   \nPage 35  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 36 of 84\n89.  The memoranda that purported to designate federal officers pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315 did not identify the individuals who were supposedly being designated, either within the \nbody of the instrument or in any attachment thereto.  The memoranda refer to an attached \ndistribution list but, on information and belief, no list was attached when the memoranda were \nissued.  On information and belief, no such list existed at the time.  Because the memoranda did \nnot identify the officers supposedly being designated, no officers were designated. \n90.  The conclusion that the memoranda did not designate any DHS employees was \nconfirmed on November 2, 2020, by the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.70  The DHS Inspector General noted that โit is impossible to identify which particular \nemployees [FPS Director Patterson] designated, or, stated differently, indicated, set apart, or \nchose, to exercise authority under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315.โ  The DHS Inspector General concluded \nthat, โ[a]s a result, his memoranda did not designate anyone under this statute.โ  \n91.  Because the memoranda did not designate any DHS employees, no federal officer \ndeployed to Portland has been designated pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315.  Defendantsโ actions that \nare supposedly authorized by these memoranda should be declared unlawful. \n3.  Even if Defendant Wolf and FPS Director Patterson Had Possessed \nAuthority to Designate Officers and Even if Federal Officers Had Been So \nDesignated, the Officers Exceeded the Scope and Terms of the Designation. \n92.  Even if Defendant Wolf and FPS Director Patterson had the authority to authorize \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ and even if the federal officers deployed to Portland as part of \nโOperation Diligent Valorโ had been validly designated pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315, the \n \n70 Joseph Cuffari, Inspector General of DHS, Management Alert โ FPS Did Not Properly \nDesignate DHS Employees Deployed to Protect Federal Properties under 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315(b)(1), OIG 21-05 (Nov. 2, 2020), at 6, \nhttps://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2020-11/OIG-21-05-Nov20.pdf.   \nPage 36  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 37 of 84\nofficersโ actions exceeded the scope and terms of the purported designation, including by using \nforce against Plaintiffs and arresting Mr. Pettibone off federal property and by using force \nagainst Plaintiffs and arresting Mr. Pettibone without having first received legal briefings. \n93.  The memoranda that purported to designate federal officers for duty in connection \nwith the protection of federal property expressly provide that the designation โis limited to law \nenforcement functions on the federal property assigned to you.โ    \n94.  The memoranda that purport to designate federal officers for duty in connection \nwith the protection of federal property expressly provided that โ[p]rior to utilizingโ the \ndesignated authority, the federal officers โare required to receive legal briefings provided by FPS \nlegal advisors on 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 authorities and jurisdiction, to include relevant criminal \nstatutory and regulatory provisions enforceable on the federal property.โ \n95.  On information and belief, DHS failed to provide the required legal briefings to \nsome or all of the federal officers deployed to Portland as part of โOperation Diligent Valorโ \nbefore they purported to exercise the authority supposedly granted.    \n96.  Defendants exceeded the scope and terms of the purported designation by \nperforming law enforcement functions off federal property and/or prior to receiving the legal \nbriefings mandated by the purported designation.

Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2), DHS employees properly designated to \nprotect federal property and persons on the property have limited enumerated powers, including \nthe powers to: \na.  โenforce Federal laws and regulations for the protection of persons and \nproperty,โ 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2)(A); \nb.  โmake arrests without a warrant for any offense against the United States \ncommitted in the presence of the officer or agent or for any felony cognizable under the \nlaws of the United States if the officer or agent has reasonable grounds to believe that the \nperson to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony,โ id. ยง 1315(b)(2)(C); and  \nc.  โconduct investigations, on and off the property in question, of offenses \nthat may have been committed against property owned or occupied by the Federal \nGovernment or persons on the property,โ id. ยง 1315(b)(2)(E).   \n98.

Factual Allegations Relating to Individual Plaintiffs.   \n1.  Plaintiff Mark Pettibone \n100.  Mr. Pettibone has attended the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse on \nmultiple occasions since they initially commenced in late May 2020.  While attending the \nprotests, he has repeatedly witnessed the use of excessive force by federal officers, including the \nuse of impact munitions, pushing and shoving, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas on \nindividuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful manner.  In the early morning hours of July 15, \n2020, after having attended the protests and non-violently protesting in support of Black Lives \nMatter, he was personally subjected to such unlawful tactics when he was snatched off the street \nby unidentified federal officers, who arrested him and detained him in jail for hours without ever \ninforming him of the reasons for their actions, much less charging him with an offense. \n101.  The incident began when Mr. Pettibone and a friend were walking home from the \nprotests a block west of Chapman Square on Main Street.  They were not on federal property nor \nengaged in any violent or unlawful behavior.  Nor were they in or near a crowd of people \nengaging in any violent or unlawful behavior.  Earlier in the evening, they had not engaged in \nany violent or threatening behavior and had not damaged federal property, nor had they been \nnear anyone engaged in such behavior.  They did not hear any orders to disperse given by federal \nofficers earlier in the vicinity of the Hatfield Courthouse.  They were approached by a group of \npeople who warned them that unidentified men in camouflage were driving around the area in \nunmarked minivans and grabbing people off the street.  Almost immediately thereafter, an \nunmarked dark-colored minivan stopped in front of Mr. Pettibone and four to five men in \ncamouflaged military garb jumped out of the van and sought to detain him.   \nPage 39  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 40 of 84\n102.  Mr. Pettibone could not see any specific agency badges or identification on the \nclothing worn by the men, particularly given the darkness at the time, and the men did not \nidentify themselves as law enforcement officers.  Uncertain about who the men were and afraid \nof what they might do, Mr. Pettibone ran west on Main Street and then turned south on \nBroadway with one of the camouflaged men chasing him.  As he ran down Broadway, the same \nor a similar unmarked van pulled up and stopped in front of him and several men wearing the \nsame clothing jumped out in front of him.  Mr. Pettibone thought that if they were federal agents, \nthey might be retaliating against him for participating in the protest earlier that evening near the \nHatfield Courthouse. \n103.  Mr. Pettibone still did not know who the men were but felt that he was not free to \nleave.  He sank to his knees on the public sidewalk on Broadway and asked โWhy?โ several \ntimes.  The men did not respond and offered no explanation for their actions.  Instead, they \nfirmly led him into the unmarked van, where he was put on the floor.  One of the men restrained \nMr. Pettiboneโs hands above his head and put pressure on his head and neck to force his head \ndown.  The men then pulled his hat down over his eyes to temporarily blind him, determined that \nhe had no weapons, and drove him into the garage of a building that he later learned was the \nHatfield Courthouse.   \n104.  Once Mr. Pettibone was inside the Hatfield Courthouse, a second group of \nunidentified men wearing fatigue pants and tee shirts photographed him, searched the contents of \nhis backpack without asking consent, cuffed his hands and ankles, and placed him in a cell.  \nWhile Mr. Pettibone was in the cell, two officers approached him, represented that they were \nrecording their interaction with him, and read Mr. Pettibone his Miranda rights.  The officers \nasked Mr. Pettibone to waive his Miranda rights.  Mr. Pettibone refused to answer questions and \nPage 40  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 41 of 84\nrequested a lawyer.  No lawyer was provided.  Instead, the officers left, saying, โThis interview \nis terminated.โ   \n105.  At the time of his arrest, Mr. Pettibone had not committed and was not \ncommitting any federal offense and he was blocks away from the Hatfield Courthouse.  In \naddition, the federal officers who detained him did not have either probable cause or a warrant \nfor his arrest.  After being held in the jail cell for more than an hour, Mr. Pettibone was released \nwithout being given any paperwork indicating that he had even been arrested, much less charged \nwith any crime.  He was given his belongings back in a garbage bag, but a respirator that was in \nhis backpack had been damaged, and it was unclear whether his cell phone had been accessed.  \n106.  Not surprisingly, the experience of being snatched off the street and put in an \nunmarked van by unidentified men in military-style uniforms who did not explain their actions, \nsearched his possessions without consent, and held him in jail with no explanation has injured \nMr. Pettibone and caused him significant emotional distress and anxiety.  Even after his arrest, \nMr. Pettibone has continued to experience anxiety about the potential of being arrested or \nstopped again for exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest.  In the wake of his arrest, \nMr. Pettibone was concerned for his safety; he attended only three additional protests in Portland \nafter his arrest because he was worried he would be targeted by federal forces.  Although \nMr. Pettibone would like to exercise his right to protest even after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is \ninaugurated as president on January 20, 2021, he is concerned that he will be targeted by the \nfederal government.  Mr. Pettibone believes Defendants used unlawful and excessive force to \nintimidate peaceful protesters and, accordingly, feels chilled in his ability to exercise his \nconstitutional right to peacefully protest near and at federal facilities. \nPage 41  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 42 of 84\n107.  On information and belief, some or all of the federal officers who arrested \nMr. Pettibone were DHS employees, and the federal officers who photographed him, searched \nhis possessions, and imprisoned him were USMS employees.   \n108.  On information and belief, Mr. Pettibone was arrested and detained because of his \nparticipation in the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse, which was nonviolent and lawful in \nnature.    \n109.  Pursuant to the Policy, Defendants have made multiple warrantless arrests of \nindividuals in Portland who had not committed and were not committing any federal offenses, \nincluding arrests of individuals who were not in the immediate vicinity of the Hatfield \nCourthouse.   \n110.  At a July 21, 2020 press conference, FPS Deputy Director Richard โKrisโ Cline \ndiscussed such a warrantless arrest caught on video and stated that the individual in the video \nwas released because the CBP officers โdid not have what they needed.โ71 \n111.  In an interview with Fox News, Defendant Wolf proclaimed that federal officers \nโare having to go out and proactively arrest individuals.โ  He criticized as โridiculousโ the \nsuggestion that DHS employees lacked the authority to arrest individuals off federal property.       \n112.  On information and belief, the warrantless arrests, including Mr. Pettiboneโs \narrest, were made pursuant to the Policy and were part of officially sanctioned behavior and \nreflected a policy, practice, or custom that was directed or sanctioned by high-ranking officials, \nincluding Defendants Wolf and Russell, in support of Defendant Trumpโs policy of targeting \n \n71 DHS/CPB Press Conference, supra note 1, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2112&v=2XTYITCtFlc&feature=youtu.be.  \nPage 42  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 43 of 84\nprotesters supporting Black Lives Matter and opposing police violence on Black Americans as \nviolent left-wing extremists or anarchists undermining white nationalist values. \n3.  Plaintiff Mac Smiff. \n113.  Mr. Smiff, a Black Oregonian, has attended the protests outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse on numerous occasions since they initially commenced in late May 2020, and has \nrepeatedly witnessed the use of excessive force by federal officers, including the use of impact \nmunitions, pushing and shoving, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas on individuals protesting \nin a peaceful and lawful manner.  In the evening of July 24, 2020, Mr. Smiff attended the \nprotests outside the Hatfield Courthouse as a member of the press.  He wore distinctive clothing \nthat identified him as a member of the press, including highly visible โPRESSโ signage on his \nhelmet, and tried to interview federal officers from the public sidewalk and street.  While Mr. \nSmiff tried to ask questions, a federal officer instructed another officer to photograph Mr. Smiff \nwith a camera attached to a large, 35-mm extended lens. \n114.  Later, in the early morning hours of July 25, 2020, Mr. Smiff was personally \nsubjected to unlawful actions such as he had witnessed on other dates when an unidentified \nfederal officer shot him in the head with an impact munition while he was lawfully attending the \nprotests.  Upon information and belief, federal officers used the photograph taken hours earlier to \ntarget and retaliate against Mr. Smiff for asking questions of the federal contingent surrounding \nthe Hatfield Courthouse.    \n115.  At the time he was shot in the early hours of July 25, Mr. Smiff was standing in \nLownsdale Square, which is separated from the Hatfield Courthouse by SW Third Avenue.  \nFederal officials did not have probable cause to believe that he had committed any crime.  He \nwas not on federal property and had not engaged in any violent or unlawful activity or damaged \nPage 43  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 44 of 84\nfederal property.  He did not see anyone else damaging federal property that evening either, and \nno one around him was engaged in any violent behavior.  Mr. Smiff was wearing a helmet which \nhad a conspicuous sign on it indicating that he was a member of the press, and federal officials \nknew or reasonably should have known that he was a journalist.   \n116.  Federal officials were clearing nonviolent protesters in SW Third Avenue \nimmediately in front of the Hatfield Courthouse, some 15 to 20 yards away from where Mr. \nSmiff was standing.  Mr. Smiff cannot recall hearing any dispersal orders from the federal \nofficials.  When Mr. Smiff looked down at his phone to send a tweet, he was shot in the right \nside of his face with an indelible hard-cap paintball, just below the line of his helmet and just \nabove a face mask he was wearing.  He was standing by himself, approximately 10 feet away \nfrom other people, with no other individuals close by.     \n117.  The impact of the shot and resulting shock caused Mr. Smiff to fall to the ground.  \nHe got up and retreated as well as he could towards SW Fourth Avenue where there was an \nambulance and volunteers providing medical care.  Mr. Smiff was partly blinded by the paint on \nhis face and had a large contusion on his head, which restricted his mobility.  He received \ntreatment from the volunteer medics, who told him that he may have suffered a concussion.   \n118.  At the time that Mr. Smiff was shot, DHS, USMS, and all their agents and \nemployees were enjoined by the District of Oregon from using physical force directed against \nany person whom they knew or reasonably should have known was a journalist, unless the \nfederal officers had probable cause to believe that the person had committed a crime.  The \ntemporary restraining order provided that wearing a professional or authorized press badge or \ndistinctive clothing that identifies the wearer as a member of the press would be considered \nPage 44  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 45 of 84\nindicia of being a journalist.  A copy of the temporary restraining order is attached hereto as \nExhibit 11.   \n119.  The District Court entered the temporary restraining order on July 23, 2020 at \n5:00 p.m., and ordered DHS and USMS to provide notice of it to all their employees, officers, \nand agents deployed in Portland within 24 hours.  On information and belief, within hours of the \norderโs entry, Kenneth Cuccinelli, purportedly the acting Deputy Secretary of DHS, emailed a \ngroup of DHS officials, including Defendant Wolf, to inform them of the temporary restraining \norder.  Mr. Cuccinelli told them that the temporary restraining order is โoffensive, but shouldnโt \naffect anything weโre doing.โ  Mark Morgan, the head of CBP, concurred: โMy thoughts as \nwell.โ   \n120.  On information and belief, Defendant Wolf did not correct Mr. Cuccinelli or Mr. \nMorganโs belief that DHS could ignore the temporary restraining order and continue using force \nagainst journalists such as Mr. Smiff, nor did he order them or any other DHS official to ensure \nthat no DHS agent or employee in Portland used force against journalists going forward.        \n121.  The District of Oregon ordered that any willful violation of the temporary \nrestraining order would be considered to be a violation of a clearly established constitutional \nright and not subject to qualified immunity in any Bivens action brought against any individual \nemployee, officer, or agent of DHS and USMS.    \n122.  The federal officers that shot Mr. Smiff knew or reasonably should have known \nthat he was a journalist, and they lacked probable cause to believe that he had committed a \ncrime.  On information and belief, the targeting and shooting of Mr. Smiff was a willful violation \nof the temporary restraining order.  On information and belief, Defendants Wolf and Russell set \nin motion the use of force or knowingly refused to ensure that federal officials were complying \nPage 45  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 46 of 84\nwith the temporary restraining order, when they knew or reasonably should have known that \ntheir actions and omissions would result in the use of force against journalists like Mr. Smiff.  \nDefendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are therefore not entitled to qualified immunity against his \nclaims.       \n123.  As a result of being shot by the federal officers, Mr. Smiff suffered physical pain \nas well as anxiety that his concussion could leave him vulnerable to more serious adverse health \nconsequences if he were injured again.  This trauma affected Mr. Sniffโs ability to work in the \ndays following his injuries and the potential of repeated injury left him fearful of exercising his \nlawful right to peacefully protest during his recovery.  Although Mr. Smiff would like to exercise \nhis right to protest even after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is inaugurated as president on January 20, \n2021, he is concerned that he will be targeted by the federal government.  Mr. Smiff believes \nDefendants used unlawful and excessive force to intimidate peaceful protesters and, accordingly, \nfeels chilled in his ability to exercise his constitutional right to peacefully protest near and at \nfederal facilities. \n4.  Plaintiff Andre Miller.  \n124.  Mr. Miller, a Black Oregonian, attended the protests outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse on numerous occasions since they initially commenced in late May 2020.  Mr. Miller \nhas been involved in documenting the protests and providing volunteer crowd-safety and medic \nservices at the protests.  While at the protests, he has repeatedly witnessed the use of excessive \nforce by federal officers, including spraying peaceful protesters in the face with chemical \nirritants, hitting protesters with batons, and firing cannisters of tear gas indiscriminately into \ncrowds of individuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful manner.   \nPage 46  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 47 of 84\n125.  On July 22, 2020, he was personally subjected to such unlawful actions when an \nunidentified federal officer shot him in the head with a tear gas cannister, causing a gash in his \nhead that required seven stitches and a concussion that continues to have lingering effects.  At \nthe time he was injured, Mr. Miller was standing on the sidewalk in a crowd of individuals on \nMain Street, between SW Fourth and Fifth Avenues.  He was not on federal property and was \nnot engaged in violent or unlawful behavior or damaging federal property.  He did not see \nanyone around him engaged in any threatening or violent behavior or property damage either.  \nThe crowd was peacefully protesting when federal officers began marching up Main Street while \nfiring tear gas cannisters and impact munitions into the crowd without any advance warning or \ninstructions.  Mr. Miller did not hear the federal officers issue any dispersal order before they \ntook action against the protesters. \n126.  The crowd began to fall back in response to the tear gas and shooting.  Mr. Miller \nturned and began to move back as well.  As he retreated west on Main Street, he looked to his \nright and left and was then hit on the forehead.  He exclaimed, โI got hit! I got hit!โ to his fiancรฉe \nwho was standing next to him.  She said she had been hit as well, apparently with the cannister \nthat ricocheted off of Mr. Miller.  Mr. Miller looked down at his phone and saw that blood was \nstreaming from his head.  His eye closest to the wound then filled with blood and he could not \nsee.  He was deeply frightened by the volume of blood as he remembered the wound suffered at \nthe protests by Donovan LaBella and he was unsure how badly he had been wounded.   \n127.  Mr. Millerโs fiancรฉe applied pressure to his forehead to stanch the bleeding.  She \nthen led him in the same direction with the crowd, moving west on Main Street towards SW \nFifth Avenue.  Mr. Miller and his fiancรฉe then turned north on SW Fifth Avenue, at which point \nMr. Miller could not walk further.  He sat down and his fiancรฉe continued to apply pressure to \nPage 47  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 48 of 84\nthe wound on his head and called for an ambulance.  They then walked to try to locate the \nemergency vehicle, but Mr. Miller passed out momentarily and was unable to continue walking.  \nHe was then helped into a safe vehicle where he laid down and then vomited twice.  Eventually, \nhe was transported to the hospital where he received treatment, including the removal of metal \nfragments from his wound, seven stitches, and a CAT scan.  \n128.  As a result of his injury, Mr. Miller has suffered significant pain, emotional \ntrauma, memory loss and confusion, and irritability.  He has been unable to work and the \npotential of further injury has left him fearful of exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest \nduring his recovery.   \n129.  Mr. Miller would like to continue to participate in similar protests even after \nJoseph R. Biden, Jr., becomes president on January 20, 2021.  Mr. Miller, however, believes \nDefendants used unlawful and excessive force to intimidate peaceful protesters and, accordingly, \nfeels chilled in his ability to exercise his constitutional right to peacefully protest near and at \nfederal facilities. \n5.  Plaintiff Nichol Denison. \n130.  Ms. Denison attended the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse on several occasions \nin June and July 2020.  She witnessed the use of excessive force by federal officers, including \nthe use of impact munitions, pushing and shoving, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas on \nindividuals protesting in a peaceful and lawful manner.   \n131.  On July 24, 2020, she was personally subjected to such unlawful tactics when she \nhad a tear gas cannister hurled into her head, causing a three-inch gash to her forehead that \nultimately required 11 stitches.  Ms. Denison was not on federal property and was not engaged in \nviolent or unlawful behavior or damaging federal property; nor did she see anyone damaging \nPage 48  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 49 of 84\nfederal property before she was attacked by federal officers.  Ms. Denison had come to the \nprotests that evening as a member of the Wall of Moms, an unincorporated association with a \nmission to support Black Lives Matter, and to protect protesters supporting Black Lives Matter \nfrom being subject to excessive use of force by the federal government.  She wore a bright \nyellow short-sleeved tee shirt over a long-sleeved shirt, a respirator, and a bright yellow plastic \nhard hat with โBLMโ written on it in black marker. \n132.  Shortly before she was hit by the tear gas cannister, Ms. Denison was standing \nwith the Wall of Moms in the street outside the fence surrounding the Hatfield Courthouse.  The \nfence encroached on the public street and, on information and belief, the fence was not itself \nfederal property.  People in Ms. Denisonโs vicinity were chanting and yelling, and some were \nbanging on the fence, but there were no lasers, no fireworks, and no items being thrown at the \nHatfield Courthouse anywhere near where she was standing.  Ms. Denison herself did not engage \nin any violence or destruction of property.  She merely stood in a line of women with arms \nlinked, facing the fence, which was approximately eight feet in front of them.     \n133.  As she and others were chanting, Ms. Denison saw federal officers emerge from \nthe Hatfield Courthouse.  They made no announcement or order to disperse.  Instead, they simply \nbegan launching cannisters of tear gas at the peaceful protesters without warning.  Some of the \nprotesters who had leaf blowers tried to blow the gas back towards the federal agents.   \n134.  While this was occurring, approximately five additional federal officers dressed in \nblack with the label โDHSโ on their chests came out from the Hatfield Courthouse and rushed up \nto the fence line.  They had their weapons drawn and pointing directly at the women who were \nstanding in the line with Ms. Denison.  Without any warning, the officers then began firing at \nMs. Denison and the other women through gaps in the fence.  The weapons appeared to be \nPage 49  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 50 of 84\nshooting pepper balls or bullets the size of paint balls.  The officers were close enough that Ms. \nDenison could see them looking for people to shoot, including her.   \n135.  Ms. Denison was hit repeatedly and was then struck far more forcefully in the \nhead by a tear gas cannister that was, on information and belief, thrown or shot from a position \nwell above her in the Hatfield Courthouse.  Although she was wearing a yellow hard hat, the \nblow stunned her.  She tried to back away through the crowd, but the blow to her head made it \ndifficult to move.  As she removed her mask to check her injury, she was exposed to additional \ntear gas, burning her face and eyes.  As she touched her head, she realized she was bleeding \nprofusely.  Meanwhile, federal officers were discharging more gas cannisters at the protesters. \n136.  Ms. Denison then worked her way as best she could to a medic van where \nvolunteers were offering treatment to injured protesters.  When she removed her hard hat and \nrespirator to receive treatment, she found that she had a three-inch v-shaped gash that was \ngushing blood and was exposed to a significant amount of tear gas.  The wound was too severe \nto be treated on site, and Ms. Denison was taken to the VA hospital by some friends, where she \nreceived 11 stiches before being taken home.  A photo showing the wound on Ms. Denisonโs \nhead taken at the hospital is below: \n \nPage 50  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 51 of 84\n     \n137.  Once she was at home, Ms. Denison developed a black eye and major swelling \nfrom the injury.  Although she was exhausted by the incident, she was unable to sleep and \nsuffered extreme anxiety, reliving the event in her mind and finding herself unable to stop \ncrying. \n138.  As a result of her injury, Ms. Denison has suffered pain and ongoing anxiety and \nirritability consistent with having received a concussion.  She has also incurred medical \nPage 51  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 52 of 84\nexpenses, and suffered limitations on her ability to perform her daily tasks during her recovery \nand fear of repeated injury for exercising her lawful right to peacefully protest.  \n139.  Ms. Denison would like to continue protesting in the future on and near federal \nproperties.  For example, Ms. Denison would like to continue to protest near and at the federal \nICE facility in Portland.  Ms. Denison understands that protests near the Portland ICE facility are \nplanned to continue in the future, including after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., becomes president on \nJanuary 20, 2021.  However, because of Defendantsโ unlawful actions and because of the injuries \nshe incurred as a result of those actions, Ms. Dennison feels chilled from exercising her \nconstitutional right to peacefully protest at or near federal facilities, including the ICE facility, \nbecause she fears that federal agents will again employ excessive and unlawful force against \nprotesters near federal facilities and that she may again be injured as a result. \n6.  Plaintiff Maureen Healy. \n140.  Ms. Healy has attended protests supporting Black Lives Matter and opposing \npolice violence against Black Americans at multiple locations in Portland, including the Hatfield \nCourthouse.       \n141.  On July 20, 2020, Ms. Healy was among a large group of protesters in Lownsdale \nSquare in front of the Hatfield Courthouse who were peacefully protesting and chanting.  She \nwas not on federal property and was not engaged in any violent or unlawful behavior or \ndamaging federal property.  Just after midnight, she saw a small number of protesters trying to \nremove plywood from around the Hatfield Courthouse, but she did not engage with those \nprotesters, and the majority of protesters in Lownsdale Square were peaceful.   \n142.  Without warning or issuing a dispersal order, federal officers then appeared and \nbegan firing flash-bangs, impact munitions, and tear gas cannisters into the crowd.  The federal \nPage 52  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 53 of 84\nofficers were approaching the Hatfield Courthouse and the crowd from the south, either from the \nJustice Center or the Federal Building.  Ms. Healy was between Third and Fourth Avenues, north \nof the elk statue on Main Street.  The crowd began to fall back, and Ms. Healy heard other \nprotesters telling people to walk and not run to avoid trampling each other.  Many people, \nhowever, including Ms. Healy, began to turn and run.  Just as she did so, Ms. Healy was hit in \nthe head with a projectile that felt metallic and the size of a small can.  Although she was \nwearing a bike helmet at the time, the impact cut her face and gave her a black eye and \nconcussion as shown below: \n \n143.  Ms. Healy realized she had been hit and was bleeding profusely.  After calling out \nfor help, Ms. Healy was helped to some volunteer medics who sought to treat her injuries.  But \nfederal officers continued to fire tear gas into the area, forcing them all to move farther away to a \nPage 53  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 54 of 84\nvan where Ms. Healy was bandaged.  She was then driven to a location where her husband was \nable to pick her up and take her to the hospital for additional treatment. \n144.  The actions of the federal officers caused Ms. Healy to suffer pain, fear, and \nanxiety.  Ms. Healy has been forced to take time off from work owing to her concussion and \noutsource work to colleagues.  She has had multiple medical appointments and still does not \nknow what substance is trapped under her skin as a result of being struck by the metallic can.  \nAlthough she would have liked to continue attending protests while the federal officers were \ndeployed in and around the Hatfield Courthouse, she was afraid for her safety and did not do so.  \nIn other words, she has suffered a fear of repeated injury for exercising her lawful right to \npeacefully protest. \n145.  Although Ms. Healy would like to exercise her right to protest even after Joseph \nR. Biden, Jr., is inaugurated as president on January 20, 2021, she is concerned that she will be \ntargeted by the federal government.  She believes that the federal officers targeted the crowd she \nwas in on July 20 because they were exercising their right to peacefully assemble and protest.  \nMs. Healy believes Defendants used unlawful and excessive force to intimidate peaceful \nprotesters and, accordingly, feels chilled in her ability to exercise her constitutional right to \npeacefully protest near and at federal facilities. \n7.  Plaintiff Christopher David. \n146.  On July 18, 2020, Mr. David attended the protests at the Hatfield Courthouse for \nthe first time.  He decided to attend after seeing news and online video footage of protesters \nbeing attacked by federal officers, as well as the online video of an unknown person being \nabducted in an unmarked van by officers without any readily apparent identifying insignia.  He \nPage 54  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 55 of 84\nwanted to support the voices of the protesters in support of Black Lives Matter and against police \nviolence. \n147.  Mr. David arrived downtown at around 8:15 p.m. on July 18, 2020.  Mr. David \nwas wearing a sweatshirt that said โNAVYโ on the front.  He was also wearing a disposable \nsurgical cloth facemask, but he was not wearing a respirator, helmet, or any other protective \nclothing.  \n148.  At around 10:45 p.m., as he was about to leave the protest, Mr. David saw federal \nofficers emerging from the Hatfield Courthouse.  The federal officers did not issue a dispersal \norder before they attacked.  Mr. David saw them launch tear gas cannisters and rush a line of \nprotesters standing in the intersection, knocking several to the ground.   \n149.  Mr. David was standing in Lownsdale Square at the time.  He was not on federal \nproperty and was not engaged in violent or unlawful activity or property damage.  Mr. David was \nshocked by the federal officersโ actions and walked into SW Third Avenue to talk to the officers, \nas shown below: \nPage 55  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 56 of 84\n \n150.  Mr. David then attempted to ask the officers what they were doing and why they \nwere not honoring their oath to support the Constitution.  The officers did not verbally respond \nor instruct Mr. David to move, but one of the officers trained his firearm on Mr. Davidโs chest \nand then lowered it, after which another officer plowed into Mr. David to knock him back.  \n151.  Mr. David stumbled backwards in the street to recover his balance.  Two federal \nofficers then approached Mr. David, one after the other, and struck him with their batons while \none of them deployed a canister of chemical irritant spray directly into Mr. Davidโs face.  Mr. \nDavid was able to knock the cannister away in self-defense only to have another officer approach \nand spray him in the face again. \n152.  In addition to being sprayed twice in the face, Mr. David believes that he was \nstruck with a baton at least five times, including a blow to his right hand.  Mr. David tried to \nPage 56  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 57 of 84\nmove away, but the officers kept hitting him and spraying him with irritant.  An officer struck \nhim across the back with a baton after he had completely turned around and begun walking \naway.   \n153.  Each of those acts of violence were specifically targeted and directed at \nMr. David, who was standing away from other protesters (except for Mr. Obermeyer).   \n154.  Mr. David was unable to see or move freely as a result of the chemicals deployed \ndirectly in his eyes and face.  He moved away gingerly, walking through a cloud of tear gas, and \nsat down on a park bench, where a volunteer street medic helped him with his injuries before \nlocating an ambulance for him.   \n155.  The ambulance took Mr. David to Portlandโs VA hospital, where he learned that \nhis right hand had been broken in two places as a result of the baton beating from the federal \nofficers.  His ring finger required surgery.  Mr. David is still in pain every day from his hand \ninjury, which has adversely affected his dexterity and thus hampered his ability to perform his \nwork in the chemistry and toxicology section of the laboratory at the Portland VA hospital.   \n156.  Even Defendant Russell, after reviewing a video of the federal officers beating \nMr. David, concluded that it appeared they had used excessive force against him. \n157.  At the time of the incident, Mr. David did not know which federal agency \nemployed the officers who beat and gassed him.  Subsequently, however, Kenneth Cuccinelli \n(purportedly Acting Deputy Secretary of the DHS) indicated that officers involved in beating \nMr. David were USMS officers.72   \n \n72 Deborah Bloom, Navy Veteran Says He Was Beaten โLike a Punching Bagโ in Portland, \nReuters, July 20, 2020, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-portland-\nveteran/navy-veteran-says-he-was-beaten-like-a-punching-bag-in-portland-idUSKCN24L2CP; \nVideo, Navy Vet Says Authorities Beat Him at Portland Protest, CNN (July 21, 2020), \nPage 57  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 58 of 84\n158.  Mr. David would like to return to the protests but has not done so because of the \nbeating that he received and the concerns of his family members that he will be further injured if \nhe returns.  โ[S]ometimes I have to listen to better advice from other people,โ he was forced to \nconclude.  โI am 53 and am not indestructible.โ73  In other words, he is fearful of repeated injury \nfor exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest. \n159.  Although Mr. David would like to exercise his right to protest even after Joseph \nR. Biden, Jr., is inaugurated as president on January 20, 2021, he is concerned that he will be \ntargeted by the federal government or by right-wing domestic terrorists such as the Proud Boys.  \nHe believes that the federal officers targeted him because he exercised his right to peacefully \nprotest and speak to the federal officers.  Moreover, federal officials continue to target and \nretaliate against him.  After Mr. David was identified as a protester and spoke publicly about his \nparticipation in the July 18 protest, the White House directed the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(his employer) to put a note in his file chastising him for not wearing a face mask at the protestโ\nnotwithstanding the fact that there are numerous photographs showing him fully masked to \nprotect himself against COVID-19.  Mr. Davidโs superior at the VA successfully quashed the \nWhite Houseโs ploy.  \n160.  Mr. David believes Defendants used unlawful and excessive force to intimidate \npeaceful protesters and that they and other federal actors continue to do so, as described above.  \n \nhttps://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/07/21/portland-protest-chris-david-navy-vet-ken-\ncuccinelli-response-sot-vpx.cnn. \n73 Danielle Zoellner, โThey Just Started Whaling on Meโ: Veteran Speaks Out After Video of \nFederal Officers Beating Him at Portland Protests Goes Viral, The Independent, July 20, 2020, \nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/portland-protests-trump-veteran-\nchristopher-david-federal-officers-oregon-a9627466.html. \nPage 58  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 59 of 84\nAccordingly, Mr. David feels chilled in his ability to exercise his constitutional right to \npeacefully protest near and at federal facilities. \n8.  Plaintiff Duston Obermeyer. \n161.  Like Mr. David, Mr. Obermeyer attended the protests outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse for the first time on July 18, 2020.  He was motivated by press reports that federal \nofficers were using excessive force to suppress the protests.  He believed the protesters should be \nfree to express their views in favor of Black Lives Matter and against systemic racismโviews he \nsupported himself.  Mr. Obermeyer was dressed in ordinary clothes with a cotton mask on his \nface.  He was not wearing any protective gear.   \n162.  When Mr. Obermeyer arrived at the protests, he witnessed a large number of \npeople talking and chanting emotionally about Black Lives Matter, police reform, and more \ngeneral government reform.  The protests were generally very peaceful, and Mr. Obermeyer did \nnot observe protesters engaged in any actions that would appear to justify a harsh response from \nlaw enforcement. \n163.  At close to 11:00 p.m., as Mr. Obermeyer was standing in Lownsdale Square \nfacing the Hatfield Courthouse, he noticed a commotion on the right side of the front of the \nbuilding.  He was not on federal property and he was not engaged in violent or unlawful behavior \nor property damage.  Mr. Obermeyer then saw a phalanx of federal officers begin marching north \ntowards a group of protesters who were chanting in the middle of SW Third Avenue.  The \nfederal officers did not issue a dispersal order before they began to march.  Mr. Obermeyer did \nnot see any identification on the officersโ fatigues, but he did note that they were heavily armed, \nwith batons and automatic weapons.   \nPage 59  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 60 of 84\n164.  Mr. Obermeyer then saw the officers shoot tear gas into the crowd without any \nadvance warning and push a woman to the ground.  The woman was thrown to the ground with \nsuch force that she slid across the pavement.  Mr. Obermeyer saw no provocation for this use of \nforce by the federal officers.   \n165.  Mr. Obermeyer was shocked by what he saw and approached the federal officers \nin front of the Hatfield Courthouse.  While he was standing in SW Third Avenue with his hands \nup in a gesture showing that he meant no harm, Mr. Obermeyer heard a man to his leftโwhom \nhe did not know, but whom he later learned to be Mr. Davidโask the officers if they understood \ntheir oath of office.  They did not respond.  Mr. Obermeyer then repeated Mr. Davidโs question, \nand asked the federal officers whether they understood what an illegal order was.   \n166.  The federal officers did not respond verbally to the questions that either Mr. \nDavid or he had posed, but one of them came up to Mr. David and struck him with a baton.  The \nsame officer then tried to strike Mr. Obermeyer.  Other officers then approached, and one \npointed an automatic weapon in Mr. Obermeyerโs face while another shot him at point-blank \nrange with an orange chemical irritant.  One of the officers also struck Mr. Obermeyer in the face \nand chest with a baton.  A photograph of Mr. Obermeyer being sprayed in the face is set forth \nbelow: \n \nPage 60  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 61 of 84\n167.  Mr. Obermeyerโs eyes and nose burned terribly from the chemical and \nimmediately closed up.  The burning spread to every part of his body touched by the chemical.  \nHe was blinded, had difficulty breathing, and required the assistance of other protesters to guide \nhim away and flush out his eyes.  While medics attended to him, he listened to the sounds of \ngunfire, artillery simulation rounds, CS gas canisters being deployed, and protesters screaming.  \nTo Mr. Obermeyer, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it sounded like a combat zone. \n168.  The injuries Mr. Obermeyer suffered initially left him unable to walk.  After some \ntime, he was able to make it a block or so away from the scene where he continued to use eye-\nwash solution and water to flush his eyes and head.  After still more time, he was able to walk to \nhis car, but he still did not feel that he could drive and he called his wife who came and picked \nhim up.  When he got home, Mr. Obermeyer took multiple showers but was unable to completely \nrinse off the chemical that the officers had sprayed on him, which continued to burn his skin and \neyes, as well as the inside of his chest.     \n169.  Mr. Obermeyerโs injuries persisted, and it was three days before he felt well \nenough to resume his normal activities or to return to the protests, which he has only been able to \ndo on a limited basis.  Even in subsequent days, he has continued to have breathing problems and \nfelt pain in his chest and lungs.  He has had cognitive difficulties since the federal officers \nattacked him, which also trigged PTSD and rheumatoid arthritis.  Mr. Obermeyer, too, has \nsuffered a fear of repeated injury if he exercises his lawful right to peacefully protest. \n170.  As a result of Defendantsโ unlawful actions and the injuries that Defendants \ninflicted upon him, Mr. Obermeyer feels chilled from exercising his constitutional right to \npeacefully protest at or near federal facilities including after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., becomes \npresident on January 20, 2021. \nPage 61  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 62 of 84\n9.  Plaintiff James McNulty.  \n171.  Mr. McNulty attended the protests outside the Hatfield Courthouse on July 21, \n2020.  He went because he believed that the federal officers were preventing demonstrators from \nexpressing their legitimate grievances about systemic racism.  He wanted to be another voice to \nstand up and say that what was happening is unacceptable.   \n172.  Mr. McNulty arrived at the protests shortly after 9:00 p.m.  He saw no vandalism, \nno fires, and nothing being thrown.  The protests were peaceful.   \n173.  At approximately 11:15 p.m., Mr. McNulty was standing with other protesters on \nSW Third Avenue near the intersection with Madison Street when he heard flash-bang grenades.  \nNo dispersal order was issued.  Mr. McNulty was not on federal property and was not engaged in \nviolent or unlawful behavior or property damage.  Nor was anyone around him doing anything \nviolent or threatening or damaging to property.  When he looked towards the Hatfield \nCourthouse, he saw federal officers wearing camouflage uniforms marching up Main Street \ntowards the intersection with SW Third Avenue, launching tear gas cannisters and smoke \ngrenades.  The officers came without any warning, and Mr. McNulty did not hear them issue any \ndispersal orders of any kind.  The group of protesters standing next to him began to retreat, and \nMr. McNulty followed them as the federal officers advanced up Main Street.   \n174.  A flash-bang grenade then went off at Mr. McNultyโs feet, and the area began to \nfill with tear gas, which was blowing towards Mr. McNulty.  To escape from the tear gas, Mr. \nMcNulty moved through the intersection of Main Street and SW Third Avenue, crossing in front \nof the federal officers.  As he crossed the intersection, his eyes and face began to burn.  The \nfederal officers then shot Mr. McNulty four times: three times with rubber bullets and one time \nPage 62  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 63 of 84\nwith a pepper ball.  He was given no warning and was not disobeying any orders or engaging in \nany violence before he was shot in the back.         \n175.  Mr. McNulty was bleeding, in considerable pain, and unable to move easily.  He \nsought out volunteer medics who could assist him.  The medics provided Mr. McNulty with \nshort-term treatment and sent him to a hospital emergency room.  At the emergency room, Mr. \nMcNulty learned that one of the munitions that struck him in the back had not only gone through \nhis clothes, but had pierced his skin, fat layer, and at least one layer of muscle.  The wound was \nsevere enough that Mr. McNulty had to have a CT scan to confirm that it had not punctured his \nperitoneal cavity.  A photograph showing two of his wounds taken at the emergency room where \nhe received treatment is set forth below (with personal identifying information redacted): \nPage 63  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 64 of 84\n \n176.  Mr. McNultyโs injuries caused him considerable pain, suffering, and emotional \ntrauma, as well as medical expenses, and an inability to conduct his daily activities in a normal \nmanner during the period of his recovery.  In addition, they have made him fearful of repeated \ninjury for exercising his lawful right to peacefully protest.  \nPage 64  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 65 of 84\n177.  Mr. McNulty would consider attending future protests at or near federal facilities \nincluding after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., becomes president on January 20, 2021.  Because of the \nunlawful actions of Defendants, however, Mr. McNulty feels chilled from exercising his right to \npeacefully protest at or near federal facilities. \n10.  Plaintiff Black Millennial Movement. \n178.  On June 5, 2020, a group of younger Black citizens in the Portland area gathered \ntogether to create the Black Millennial Movement.  These individuals came together in response \nto the killings of George Floyd and so many other Black citizens at the hands of the police.  With \nnational attention finally being focused on racial justice, these individuals sought to uplift the \nconcerns shared by many Black Millennials, including student debt, economic opportunity, \nhousing and home ownership, and political representation. \n179.  The group was organized by Cameron Whitten, a 29-year old Oregonian, who \ncreated a Facebook group and invited several other young Black leaders in the Portland \ncommunity to join him, including Gregory McKelvey, Shanice Clarke, and Candace Avalos.  \nThe Black Millennial Movement originated in that Facebook group.   \n180.  Traditionally, the press has focused on only one segment of Black leadership; the \nBlack Millennial Movement seeks to provide an alternate voice and educate others about the \ndisproportionate use of force used by law enforcement towards largely nonviolent protestersโa \nperspective that has not traditionally received media attention.   \n181.  Portland-area media, such as television station KATU, have looked to members of \nthe Black Millennial Movement to understand the opinions on the Portland protests held by \nPage 65  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 66 of 84\nyounger Black leaders in Portland, including how the public pressure caused by the protests is \nforcing local leaders to be more responsive than they have been previously.74 \n182.  Members of the Black Millennial Movement were regular participants in the \nnonviolent protests outside of the Hatfield Courthouse.  While attending those protests, members \nof the Black Millennial Movement have been repeatedly tear-gassed when federal officers \ndeploy tear gas in an effort to disperse the largely peaceful crowds.  Members of the Black \nMillennial Movement have suffered injuries from the tear gas used by the federal officers, \nincluding vomiting, debilitating pain, and irritation to their eyes, skin, and respiratory systems \nlasting nearly a week after the respective protest in which they were inflicted. \n183.  Being subjected to tear-gassing by federal officials further adversely affected \nBlack Millennial Movementโs ability to engage in free speech and to raise its concerns about the \nracial violence and injustice faced by the Black community.  After experiencing the harm caused \nby the tear gas deployed by federal officers and seeing video footage of disproportionate \nviolence deployed against nonviolent protesters on a nightly basis, members of the Black \nMillennial Movement have been fearful of exercising their lawful right to peacefully protest at \nthe Hatfield Courthouse.   \n184.  Black Millennial Movement has been forced to use its limited financial resources \nto purchase safety equipment, including to protect against the tear gas deployed by federal \nofficers.  The diversion of its funds to purchasing protective equipment has impeded and \ncontinues to impede Black Millennial Movementโs ability to engage in its mission of advocacy \nand education. \n \n74 Lincoln Graves, Black Millennial Movement seeks to offer different perspective among Black \nleaders, KATU, July 30, 2020, https://katu.com/news/local/black-millennial-movement-seeks-to-\noffer-different-perspective-among-black-leaders. \nPage 66  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 67 of 84\n185.  Lingering health issues from the federal officersโ use of force and tear gas during \nthe demonstrations, as well as the chilling effects of the federal officersโ conduct, have created \nand continue to create more difficulty for Black Millennial Movement in recruiting and engaging \nin its advocacy mission.     \n186.  The effects of the federal officersโ use of tear gas and force during the summer of \n2020 continue to impede Black Millennial Movementโs current activities and its planned work \ngoing forward.  \n187.  The Black Millennial Movement plans to continue its activism and protests \nregarding racial, social, and economic justice issues, including after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., \nbecomes president on January 20, 2021.  The Black Millennial Movement regards the Hatfield \nCourthouse and the area around the Hatfield Courthouse to be an important location for their \nactivism and would like to return to that area in the future for events and peaceful protests.  The \narea surrounding the Hatfield Courthouse contains the Multnomah County Justice Center, \nPortland City Hall, other federal and local government buildings, and parks under the jurisdiction \nof both the City of Portland and the federal government that are used frequently as sites for \nprotests. \n188.  Because of the unlawful actions of the Defendants, the Black Millennial \nMovement and its members are fearful of returning to the area around the federal courthouse for \nevents and peaceful protests because they fear that law enforcementโboth local and federalโ\nwill again use unlawful, excessive force against them. \n189.  This fear has chilled the Black Millennial Movementโs and its membersโ exercise \nof their constitutional rights to peaceful protest at various locations, but particularly in the critical \narea surrounding the Hatfield Courthouse.  Defendantsโ unlawful actions, therefore, are \nPage 67  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 68 of 84\ninterfering with the Black Millennial Movementโs ongoing activism and protest activities, which \nthe Black Millennial Movement wants to continue into the foreseeable future, including after the \ninauguration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., as president on January 20, 2021. \n11.  Plaintiff Rose City Justice, Inc. \n190.  Rose City Justice, Inc. (โRose City Justiceโ) is a Black-led, BIPOC-supported, \ngrassroots organization committed to unifying local activism efforts in response to historical \nracial inequities by the justice system.  Although Rose City Justice initially operated as an \ninformal group following the murder of George Floyd, it incorporated as an Oregon nonprofit \ncorporation in June 2020.  Rose City Justice has organized peaceful protests in various \nneighborhoods in Portland, including ones in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center and \nadjacent to the Hatfield Courthouse, and participated in the Black Lives Matter protests outside \nthe Hatfield Courthouse.   \n191.  After the presence of federal officers and their use of excessive force against \nprotesters increased in early July, Rose City Justice focused its efforts on providing support and \nsafety equipment to protesters outside the Hatfield Courthouse, including helmets, goggles, and \nmasks.  Its members assisted protesters who were injured by the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, \nand concussion grenades by federal officers against peaceful protesters and were injured \nthemselves by the officersโ tactics.  Several members of Rose City Justice have bruises from \nbeing shot with rubber bullets and experienced the adverse effects of tear gas. \n192.  Being subjected to federal officersโ excessive use of force against protesters \ncaused Rose City Justice to utilize its resources to support the peaceful protesters and deterred \ntheir ability to organize and engage in other protest activities.  The federal officersโ presence in \nPage 68  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 69 of 84\nPortland also inhibited its ability to advocate for ending racial inequities, especially as it related \nto its efforts to divert funds from the Portland Police Bureau to other community activities. \n193.  Rose City Justice plans to continue its activism and protest activities in the future, \nincluding after Joseph R. Biden, Jr., becomes president on January 20, 2021.  The racial, \neconomic, and social justice issues on which Rose City Justice focuses stem from longstanding \npolicies, practices, and conditions in the United States, are not tied specifically to the Trump \nAdministration, and will not be resolved by Mr. Bidenโs election or inauguration as president. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Fourth Amendment Right Against Unlawful Search and Seizure โ Bivens \nClaim) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in Their Individual Capacities)  \n194.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 193 as though fully set forth herein. \n195.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in their \nindividual capacities.   \n196.  The actions of Defendants Doesโincluding (1) the use of unjustifiable and \nexcessive physical force against Plaintiffs Smiff, Miller, Denison, Healy, David, Obermeyer, and \nMcNulty in an effort to move them from public spaces in which they gathered to express their \npolitical opinion and/or in retaliation against Plaintiffs for their viewpoints, (2) the seizure of Mr. \nPettibone without probable cause or a judicially authorized warrant, or, alternatively, (3) the \nextraordinary manner of Mr. Pettiboneโs seizure (an abduction off a public street in the early \nhours of the morning without stated justification by unidentified individuals who emerged from \nan unmarked van, whose clothing did not identify their name or agency or government, who did \nPage 69  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 70 of 84\nnot identify themselves, who Congress had not authorized to make warrantless arrests in the first \nplace, and who were violating the express scope and terms of their ostensible designation)โand \nthe actions of Defendants Wolf and Russell in ordering or approving such actions deprived \nPlaintiffs of their rights to be free from unlawful searches and seizures secured to them under the \nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n197.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does acted in clear violation of well-settled law \nwith regard to standards for seizure of which a reasonable law enforcement officer in \nDefendantsโ positions should have been aware.  They are not entitled to qualified or official \nimmunity.   \n198.  The actions of Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does were intentional, malicious, \nand reckless and showed a callous disregard for, or indifference to, the federally protected civil \nrights of Plaintiffs.   \n199.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are jointly and severally liable to Plaintiffs \npursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 \n(1971).  Plaintiffs have no adequate alternative remedy. \n200.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful actions of these Defendants, \nPlaintiffs are entitled to recover damages from Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does, and each of \nthem.   \nPage 70  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 71 of 84\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of First Amendment (Violation of Freedom of Speech and Assembly))  \n(Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice Against Individual \nDefendants Wolf and Russell and Does in Their Official Capacities)  \n201.  Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice hereby reallege and \nincorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 200 as though fully set forth \nherein. \n202.  The actions of Defendants Wolf and Russell in ordering and/or approving the \nindiscriminate use of excessive force against Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose \nCity Justice and their members as set forth aboveโviolated and threatens to continue to violate \nthe First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and assembly of Plaintiffs Black Millennial \nMovement and Rose City Justice and their members.   \n203.  Defendants Wolf and Russellโs actions were based on the viewpoint being \nexpressed by Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City Justiceโs members.  \nDefendants would not have ordered the indiscriminate deployment of tear gas and other chemical \nagents, flash-bangs, and less-lethal impact munitions, which caused injury to Black Millennial \nMovementโs and Rose City Justiceโs members, but for their membersโ participation in the \nprotests at the Hatfield Courthouse in support of Black Lives Matter and against police violence \ntowards Black Americans.   \n204.  Defendantsโ actions of ordering and/or approving violence and/or deployment of \ntear gas and other chemical agents, flash-bangs, and impact munitions against protesters, \nincluding members of Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice, were in \nretaliation against Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City Justiceโs membersโ \nexpression of their viewpoints and exercise of their First Amendment rights.  Based on \nPage 71  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 72 of 84\nDefendantsโ past actions and the continued presence of federal law enforcement officials \ndeployed as part of โOperation Diligent Valor,โ Defendants are reasonably likely to take similar \nactions against Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City Justiceโs members in the \nfuture.   \n205.  By depriving Plaintiffs Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice of the \nopportunity to express their views and retaliating against them and their members on the basis of \ntheir views, Defendants have violated Plaintiff Black Millennial Movementโs and Rose City \nJusticeโs First Amendment rights and are imposing ongoing irreparable harm upon Plaintiffs.  \nPlaintiff Black Millennial Movementโs effectiveness as an organization will be irreparably \nharmed by its inability to generate participation at protest events because potential participants \nwill have been deterred from participation by the threat of unjustified use of violence and/or tear \ngas.  Rose City Justiceโs ability to advocate for racial justice and to advance its mission was \nirreparably harmed by forcing it to divert resources to protect its members and supporters at \nprotests in front of the Hatfield Courthouse and preventing it from engaging in free speech and \nassembly, in responses to Defendantsโ practices. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unlawful Agency Action Exceeding Statutory Authority Under  \n40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 โ 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 702, 706) \n(Plaintiff Pettibone Against Defendants Wolf and Russell in Their Official Capacities, and \nDHS and USMS) \n206.  Mr. Pettibone hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 205 as if fully set forth herein.   \n207.  The arrest of Mr. Pettibone was pursuant to the Policy adopted by Defendants \nDHS, USMS, Wolf, and Russell. \nPage 72  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 73 of 84\n208.  The Policy pursuant to which Mr. Pettibone was arrested is an agency action, \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 551. \n209.  The Policy pursuant to which Mr. Pettibone was arrested is a final action, ripe for \njudicial review, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 704. \n210.  Mr. Pettiboneโs arrest also constitutes a final agency action. \n211.  Federal government officials have issued statements approving of the Policy \nleading to the arrest of Mr. Pettibone.   \n212.  Defendants DHS, USMS Wolf, Russell, and Defendant Does, acting pursuant to \nthe Policy they had put in place, had no statutory authority to arrest Mr. Pettibone without a \nwarrant, for one or more of the reasons set forth below. \na.  There has been no valid designation of Defendants Does for duty in \nPortland in connection with the protection of property owned or occupied by the federal \ngovernment or persons on such property pursuant to 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(1) because \nDefendant Wolf and those purporting to exercise delegated authority on his behalf, \nincluding FPS Director Patterson, lacked the authority to make that designation and the \npurported designation has no force or effect.    \nb.  No DHS employees have been designated pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315(b)(1) to protect federal property in Portland. \nc.  Defendants Does who arrested Mr. Pettibone did so without having first \nreceived legal briefings provided by FPS legal advisors on 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 authorities \nand jurisdiction. \nPage 73  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 74 of 84\nd.  The arrest of Mr. Pettibone by Defendants Does occurred blocks away \nfrom the Hatfield Courthouse and was not โon the federal property assignedโ to \nDefendants Does. \ne.  The arrest of Mr. Pettibone by Defendants Does occurred beyond the \ngeographic limit of โareas outside the propertyโ within the meaning of 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315(b)(1).   \nf.  Defendants Doesโ patrol of the area where they arrested Mr. Pettibone, \nblocks away from the Hatfield Courthouse, was beyond โthe extent necessary to protectโ \nthe property or persons on the property within the meaning of 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(1). \ng.  Employees of DHS, including Defendants Does, do not possess any power \nunder 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2) to make warrantless arrests, let alone warrantless arrests \nwithout probable cause that a crime has been committed, while off the federal property.  \nh.  Mr. Pettibone did not commit a federal offense in the presence of \nDefendants Does. \ni.  Defendants Does did not have โreasonable grounds,โ within the meaning \nof 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2)(C), to believe that Mr. Pettibone had committed or was \ncommitting a felony under the laws of the United States. \nj.  Even assuming Defendants Does had โreasonable groundsโ within the \nmeaning of 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(2)(C), to believe that Mr. Pettibone had committed or \nwas committing a felony under the laws of the United States, such โreasonable groundsโ \ndo not constitute probable cause sufficient to justify an arrest. \nPage 74  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 75 of 84\n213.  The Policy that led to the arrest of Mr. Pettibone was an agency action (a) not in \naccordance with law, (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity, (c) in \nexcess of statutory authority, and/or (d) without observance of procedure required by law. \n214.  The Court should hold the Policy that led to the arrest of Mr. Pettibone to be \nunlawful. \n215.  As a direct and proximate cause of his arrest, Mr. Pettibone has suffered legal \nwrong and/or was aggrieved and is realistically threatened by a repetition of Defendantsโ \nunlawful acts.  \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Unlawful Agency Action by Deployment of Force Against Protesters Exceeding Authority \nUnder 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 โ 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 702, 706) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf and Russell in Their Official Capacities, and DHS and USMS) \n216.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 215 as though fully set forth herein. \n217.  As alleged herein, Defendants Wolf, Russell, DHS, and USMS ordered, \nsupervised and implemented the Policy, which authorized the deployment of excessive physical \nforceโincluding use of pepper spray, impact munitions, batons, chemical agents, and/or \nphysical โchargesโ by law enforcement officers against Plaintiffsโto forcibly remove them from \npublic spaces in which they gathered with others to lawfully express their political opinions, or in \nretaliation against Plaintiffs and other protesters for their viewpoints, purportedly pursuant to \ntheir statutory authority under 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315. \n218.  The Policy, pursuant to which excessive physical force was deployed against \nPlaintiffs, was an agency action, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 551. \nPage 75  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 76 of 84\n219.  The Policy, pursuant to which excessive physical force was deployed against \nPlaintiffs, was a final action, ripe for judicial review, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. ยง 704. \n220.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, Does, DHS, and USMS had no statutory authority to \ndeploy excessive physical force against Plaintiffs, as set forth below: \na.  There has been no valid designation by Defendant Wolf of Defendants \nDoes for duty in Portland in connection with the protection of property owned or \noccupied by the federal government or persons on such property pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315(b)(1), because Defendant Wolf and those purporting to exercise delegated \nauthority on his behalf, including FPS Director Patterson, lacked the authority to make \nthat designation and the purported designation therefore has no force or effect.    \nb.  No DHS employees have been designated pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \nยง 1315(b)(1) to protect federal property in Portland. \nc.  Defendants Does who used force against Plaintiffs did so without having \nfirst received legal briefings provided by FPS legal advisors on 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315 \nauthorities and jurisdiction. \nd.  Defendants Does used force against Plaintiffs while not โon the federal \nproperty assignedโ to Defendants Does. \ne.  Defendants Does deployed force against Plaintiffs while off federal \ngovernment property in a manner that was not โnecessary to protect the property and \npersons on the property,โ 40 U.S.C. ยง 1315(b)(1), often forcing protesters to move blocks \naway from the Hatfield Courthouse.  \nf.  Defendants Does deployed force to arrest Mr. Pettibone and others \nwithout the authority or grounds to make any such arrest. \nPage 76  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 77 of 84\n221.  The Policy pursuant to which excessive force was deployed against Plaintiffs was \nan agency action (a) not in accordance with law, (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity, (c) in excess of statutory authority, and/or (d) without observance of \nprocedure required by law. \n222.  The Court should hold the Policy, pursuant to which excessive force was \ndeployed against Plaintiffs, unlawful.   \n223.  As a direct and proximate cause of deployment of force against Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiffs have suffered legal wrong and/or are aggrieved and are realistically threatened by a \nrepetition of the unlawful acts of Defendants Wolf, Russell, Does, and DHS.  \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of Fourth Amendment (Right to be Free from Unreasonable Search and \nSeizures)) \n(Plaintiff Mark Pettibone Against Defendants Wolf and Russell in Their Official \nCapacities, and DHS and USMS) \n224.  Mr. Pettibone hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 223 as if fully set forth herein. \n225.  The actions of Defendants in (a) ordering and/or approving the arrest of Mr. \nPettibone and (b) the search of his belongings while in federal custody, both of which were done \nwithout probable cause or pursuant to any applicable exception under the Fourth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution, violated Mr. Pettiboneโs rights to be free from unlawful searches \nand seizures.   \n226.  This Court has inherent equitable power to issue declaratory and injunctive relief, \nincluding to enjoin violations of federal law by federal officials.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional \nChild Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320 (2015).       \nPage 77  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 78 of 84\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Ultra Vires Action) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Trump, Wolf, and Russell in Their Official Capacities, and DHS and USMS) \n227.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 226 as if fully set forth herein.   \n228.  To the extent any of Defendantsโ actions are unreviewable under any of the \npreceding causes of action, this Court has jurisdiction to review Defendantsโ actions under the \ndoctrine of non-statutory review.   \n229.  As alleged herein, Defendantsโ actions exceeded the authority conferred on \nDefendants by Congress. \n230.  As alleged herein, Defendantsโ actions were contrary to the United States \nConstitution. \n231.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that Defendantsโ actions were ultra vires.   \n232.  As a direct and proximate cause of Defendantsโ ultra vires actions, Plaintiffs have \nsuffered legal wrong and are realistically threatened by a repetition of Defendantsโ unlawful acts. \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3) (Conspiracy to Deprive Rights)) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in Their Individual Capacities) \n233.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 232 as if fully set forth herein.   \n234.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in their \nindividual capacities.   \nPage 78  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 79 of 84\n235.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does conspired together with the USMS, USMS \nofficers and agents, and officers of the City of Portland to deprive Plaintiffs of their civil rights in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3).   \n236.  The conspiracy included those involved in ordering and executing โOperation \nDiligent Valorโ and conducting law enforcement actions in connection with that operation, \nincluding Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does and USMS and its officers and agents and officers \nof the City of Portland.   \n237.  The conspirators engaged in overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, including, \nbut not limited to, using excessive force against civil rights activists outside the Hatfield \nCourthouse and in the surrounding area between July 4, 2020 and July 29, 2020, including \nshooting them in the head and body with impact munitions and pepper balls, spraying them \ndirectly in the face with pepper spray, shoving them to the ground, hitting and beating them with \nbatons, firing massive clouds of tear gas at them, and, in some instances, arresting and detaining \nthem without any lawful basis.  \n238.  The conspiracy targeted Black Americans and their supporters, who were \nprotesting on behalf of Black Lives Matter and in opposition to disproportionate police violence \nagainst Black Americans.  Both groups are protected classes under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3).  \n239.  Defendants Wolf and Russell directed the conspiracy to take these actions \nbecause of their adverse effects upon an identifiable groupโnamely, civil rights activists \nprotesting on behalf of Black Lives Matter and in opposition to Defendants Trump, Wolf, \nRussell, and Does. \n240.  The conspiracy targeted Plaintiffsโ protected First Amendment activities because \nDefendants held animus towards Plaintiffsโ viewpoints as reflected in, but not limited to, the \nPage 79  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 80 of 84\npublic statements of Defendants Trump and Wolf, USMS Director Washington, and Portland \nPolice Association President Turner.  The violent actions of the conspirators directly interfered \nwith Plaintiffsโ protected First Amendment activities. \n241.  The conspiracy violently interfered with Plaintiffsโ rights to use public \naccommodations, and therefore, their right to be free from the badges and incidents of slavery.  \nLownsdale Square, Chapman Square, SW Third Avenue, and the surrounding environs are \nplaces of public accommodation.   \n242.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are liable in their individual capacities under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3) for damages.    \n243.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does are liable for punitive damages due to their \nwillfully or recklessly depriving Plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws and/or equal \nprivileges and immunities under the laws. \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1986 (Failure to Prevent a Conspiracy to Deprive Rights)) \n(Plaintiffs (Excluding Black Millennial Movement and Rose City Justice) Against \nDefendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in Their Individual Capacities) \n244.  Plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 through 243 as if fully set forth herein.   \n245.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does in their \nindividual capacities. \n246.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1986 by failing to meet \ntheir duty to prevent or aid in preventing a conspiracy to deprive civil rights.   \nPage 80  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 81 of 84\n247.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does knew that a Section 1985 violation was about \nto occur or was occurring, had the power to prevent or aid in preventing it, and neglected or \nrefused to prevent or aid in preventing it. \n248.  As set forth above, the Section 1985 conspiracy consisted of using excessive force \nagainst civil rights activists outside the Hatfield Courthouse and in the surrounding area between \nJuly 4, 2020 and July 29, 2020, including shooting them in the head and body with impact \nmunitions and pepper balls, spraying them directly in the face with pepper spray, shoving them \nto the ground, hitting and beating them with batons, firing massive clouds of tear gas at them, \nand, in some instances, arresting and detaining them without any lawful basis, for the purpose of \ndepriving them of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, \nand Does knew such violence was planned and could have taken actions to stop or limit that \nviolence.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does willfully or negligently took no such action. \n249.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does could have and should have refused to issue \nor comply with unlawful orders, refused to use unlawful force against Plaintiffs, refused to order \nor allow officers under their command to carry out unlawful acts against Plaintiffs, and/or \nattempted to appeal to superiors to take a different course of action. \n250.  As a result of Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Doesโ failure to prevent the \nSection 1985 conspiracy, Plaintiffs were injured and their rights were violated. \n251.  Defendants Wolf, Russell, and Does acted with reckless or callous indifference to \nthe federally protected rights of Plaintiffs and are therefore liable for punitive damages. \n \n \nPage 81  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 82 of 84\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court:   \n1.

Issue a declaration that the Policy under which excessive force was \nindiscriminately deployed against Plaintiffs was an unlawful agency action (a) not \nin accordance with law, (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity, (c) in excess of statutory authority, and/or (d) without observance of \nprocedure required by law; \n5.  Issue a declaration that Defendantsโ unlawful arrest of Mr. Pettibone violated the \nFourth Amendment;  \n6.  Enjoin Defendants to inform Mr. Pettibone whether Defendants maintain records \nrelating to his unlawful arrest, including without limitation, photographs, notes \nPage 82  -  AMENDED COMPLAINT \n109205877.2 0099880- 01343 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-01464-YY    Document 18    Filed 01/08/21    Page 83 of 84\nand/or records of the arrest, and any information collected from Mr. Pettiboneโs \ncell phone;  \n7.  Enjoin Defendants to inform Mr. Pettibone whether Defendants disseminated \nrecords relating to Mr. Pettiboneโs arrest to other individuals and/or agencies;  \n8.
