    "summary": "<p>This case is about the adoption of American Indian children under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act. On July 6, 2015, an attorney representing two Indian children as their โnext friend,โ and two sets of foster parents of (other) American Indian children filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. They brought the case on behalf of themselves; all off-reservation Arizona-resident children with Indian ancestry; and all off-reservation non-Indian Arizona-resident foster, preadoptive, and prospective adoptive parents in child custody proceedings involving a child with Indian ancestry. The plaintiffs sued the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the Arizona Department of Child Safety. Represented by the Goldwater Institute and a private law firm, the plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. ยงยง 701-706; 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201-2202; and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The case was assigned to Senior Judge Neil V. Wake. </p><p>In general, the plaintiffs requested that the Court declare unconstitutional certain provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and the accompanying Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Guidelines and then enjoin their application. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that ICWAโs transfer, active efforts, burdens of proof for removal, burdens of proof for termination of parental rights, and placement preference provisions violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by treating Indian children and non-Indian adoptive parents differently than non-Indian children and Indian adoptive parents during child custody proceedings. The plaintiffs also claimed that ICWA exceeds the federal governmentโs power under the Indian Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment by regulating state court proceedings and abrogating state laws concerning foster care placement, pre-adoptive placement and termination of parental rights. Finally, the plaintiffs claimed that ICWA violates the associational freedoms under the First Amendment and that the BIA Guidelines represent unlawful agency action. </p><p>On October 29, 2015, the federal and state governments filed motions to dismiss. In their motions, the governments argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case because their alleged injuries were theoretical and speculative. Even if they did have standing, the governments argued, the plaintiffs did not state a valid claim for relief because ICWA is constitutional and the BIA Guidelines are not final rules and therefore not agency โaction.\" Several national child welfare programs and Indian rights organizations filed amicus briefs in support of the governmentsโ motions to dismiss, including the Casey Family Program, the National Indian Child Welfare Association and the National Congress of American Indians.</p><p>Before the Court could rule on the governmentsโ motions, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint. The plaintiffs were successful and filed their amended complaint on April 5, 2016. The amended complaint added Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000dโ2000d-7) as a basis for the Courtโs jurisdiction over the plaintiffsโ claims against the state government. The governments refiled their motions to dismiss immediately after the amended complaint was filed. </p><p>Shortly thereafter, the Judge Wake granted the motions to intervene of Gila River Indian Community and Navajo Nation, the tribes of the Indian children whose custody was at issue. 2016 WL 5464582. The Tribes immediately filed their own motions to dismiss, arguing (like the federal and state government) that the plaintiffs lacked standing, that their claims were foreclosed by existing Supreme Court precedent and that the Court lacked jurisdiction over non-binding agency action, including the BIA Guidelines. </p><p>On March 16, 2017, Judge Wake dismissed the case, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the case because they had not suffered a concrete and particularized injury. 2017 WL 1019685. Judge Wake held that the plaintiffs did not specifically show that the challenged ICWA provisions delayed the placement or adoption of the children whose custody was at issue or had otherwise harmed them.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, contending that the individual plaintiffs had standing to seek retrospective and declaratory relief and that the class had standing to seek prospective relief. However, as the appeal was pending, the individual Indian children whose custody was at issue were adopted. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the case as moot. 743 Fed.Appx. 823. The plaintiffs sought review in the Supreme Court, but the Court declined to take the case. 2019 WL 246401.</p><p></p>",

They filed this action in the United States District Court in Arizona\nagainst the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs for the Bureau of Indian Affairs,\nthe United States Secretary of the Interior, and the Director of the Arizona\nDepartment of Child Safety, seeking to challenge the constitutionality of various\nprovisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (โICWAโ), 25 U.S.C. ยง 1901 et seq.\nThe Gila River Indian Community and the Navajo Nation intervened to defend the\nconstitutionality of the Act.  The district court concluded Plaintiffs lack Article III\nstanding.  Plaintiffs appeal from this dismissal.  We hold this action is now moot. \nAdoption proceedings were pending at all times during the litigation in the\ndistrict court.  Defendants moved to dismiss the action, contending that Plaintiffs\nlacked Article III standing and could not state a constitutional claim upon which\nrelief could be granted.  The district court examined the complaint with respect to\neach of the challenged provisions and ruled that Plaintiffs lacked standing because\nnone had been harmed by any conduct traceable to ICWA.\n * * The Honorable David M. Ebel, United States Circuit Judge for the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n2\n\n  Case: 17-15839, 08/06/2018, ID: 10966701, DktEntry: 75-1, Page 3 of 4\nWe do not reach the standing inquiry, however, because a subsequent\ndevelopment has rendered this action moot.  Plaintiffs have never suggested they\nsuffered any economic damages.  Their original complaint sought only declaratory\nand injunctive relief relating to ICWAโs application to their adoption proceedings.\nWhile Plaintiffsโ appeal from the district courtโs dismissal was going forward,\nhowever, Plaintiffsโ adoptions all became final.  The relief Plaintiffs sought to\nredress their alleged injuries is no longer available to them.  \nAppellees argue, and we agree, that the case is therefore now moot.  The\nnamed plaintiffs are no longer subject to ICWA, and they do not allege that they\nwill be in the imminent future.  See Bayer v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 861 F.3d\n853, 864โ68 (9th Cir. 2017).  Plaintiffs counter that there will be members of a yet-\nto-be-certified class that have redressable claims, but this argument is unavailing. \nAt least one named plaintiff must present a justiciable claim unless an exception\napplies.  See OโShea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974); Lierboe v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 350 F.3d 1018, 1022โ23 (9th Cir. 2003).  None of these\nPlaintiffs do, and no exception applies here, cf. Pitts v. Terrible Herst, Inc., 653\nF.3d 1081, 1090 (9th Cir. 2011).\nPlaintiffsโ suggestion that their belated addition of a claim for nominal\ndamages saves the case from mootness fails.  While Plaintiffs were still in the\n3\n\n  Case: 17-15839, 08/06/2018, ID: 10966701, DktEntry: 75-1, Page 4 of 4\ndistrict court, they had seen the possibility that all their claims for injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief could become moot, so they filed an amended complaint adding a\nclaim for nominal damages under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act against the\nDirector of Arizonaโs Department of Child Safety.  The Supreme Court has\nadmonished this Court that โa claim for nominal damages . . . asserted solely to\navoid otherwise certain mootness, b[ears] close inspection.โ  Arizonans for Official\nEnglish v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 71 (1997). \nHere the claim does not survive such inspection.  Plaintiffs have never\nalleged actual or punitive damages.  They can cite no case supporting the\nproposition that a claim for nominal damages, tacked on solely to rescue the case\nfrom mootness, renders a case justiciable.  See id. at 68โ71.  Plaintiffs cite\nBernhardt v. County of Los Angeles, 279 F.3d 862 (9th Cir. 2002), where, in\naddition to mooted claims for injunctive relief, the original complaint alleged\nclaims for compensatory and punitive damages.  Id. at 872.  We said in Bernhardt\nthat the possibility of nominal damages avoided mootness of the entire case, see id.\nat 872โ73, but there was no belated claim asserted solely to avoid mootness as\nthere was in this case, and which the Supreme Court frowned upon in Arizonans\nfor Official English.  \nWe vacate the district courtโs judgment dismissing for lack of standing and\nremand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the action as moot.  \nVACATED AND REMANDED. \n4",

By honoring the moral imperatives enshrined in our Constitution, this nation \n2 \n \nhas successfully shed much of its history of legally sanctioned discrimination on the basis \n3 \n \nof race or ethnicity. We have seen in vivid, shameful detail how separate treatment is \n4 \n \ninherently unequal. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954). There can be \n5 \n \nno law under our Constitution that creates and applies pervasive separate and unequal \n6 \n \ntreatment to individuals based on a quantum of blood tracing to a particular race or \n7 \n \nethnicity. This country committed itself to that principle when it ratified the Fourteenth \n8 \n \nAmendment and overturned Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857), and when it \n9 \n \n10  abandoned Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).  \n \n11  2.  In 1994 and again in 1996, Congress recognized that race and ethnicity \n \n12  should play no role in state-approved adoptions when it enacted the Multiethnic Placement \n \n13  Act,  Pub.  L.  103-382,  ยงยง  551-553,  codified  at  42  U.S.C.  ยง  5115a  (1994),  and  the \n \n14  Interethnic Placement Act, Pub. L. 104-188, ยง 1808, codified at 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 671(a), \n \n15  674(d),  1996b(c)  (1996),  which  forbid  discrimination  in  adoptions  and  foster  care \n \n16  placements. \n \n17  3.  Children with Indian ancestry, however, are still living in the era of Plessy \n \n18  v. Ferguson. Alone among American children, their adoption and foster care placements \n \n19  are determined not in accord with their best interests but by their ethnicity, as a result of a \n \n20 \nwell-intentioned but profoundly flawed and unconstitutional federal law, the Indian Child \n \n21 \nWelfare Act (โICWAโ), codified at 25 U.S.C. ยงยง 1901-1963. \n \n22 \n4.  This civil rights class action is filed by Plaintiffs baby girl A.D. and baby \n \n23 \nboy C., by Carol Coghlan Carter, their next friend, and S.H. and J.H., foster/adoptive \n \n24 \nparents of baby girl A.D., and M.C. and K.C., foster/adoptive parents of baby boy C. They \n \n25 \nfile this action on behalf of themselves and all off-reservation Arizona-resident children \n \n26 \nwith Indian ancestry and all off-reservation Arizona-resident foster, preadoptive, and \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n2 of 29 \n\n \n1  prospective adoptive parents in child custody proceedings involving children with Indian \n \n2  ancestry. \n \n3  5.  They seek a declaration by this Court that certain provisions of ICWA, and \n \n4  Guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), both facially and as applied, \n \n5 \nviolate the United States Constitution. They also seek an injunction from this Court against \n \n6 \nthe application of certain provisions of ICWA and the accompanying BIA Guidelines. \n \n7 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n8 \n6.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. \n \n9 \n7.  This Court is authorized to grant declaratory and injunctive relief under 5 \n \n10 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 701 through 706, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Federal Rules \n \n11 \nof Civil Procedure (โFRCPโ) 57 and 65, and by the general and equitable powers of the \n \n12 \nfederal judiciary. \n \n13 \n8.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b), (e). \n \n14 \nPARTIES \n \n15 \n  9.

Carol Coghlan Carter is a citizen of the United States and the State of \n \n2  Arizona, and domiciled in the State of Arizona. She is an attorney licensed to practice in \n \n3  the State of Arizona. She has practiced in the area of family law for several decades. In \n \n4  the course of her legal career, she has represented during all stages of child custody \n \n5 \nproceedings children, including children with Indian ancestry as their court-appointed \n \n6 \nguardian-ad-litem;  birth  parents,  including  birth  parents  with  Indian  ancestry;  and \n \n7 \nfoster/adoptive parents, including foster/adoptive parents with Indian ancestry and those \n \n8 \nin child custody proceedings involving children with Indian ancestry. She is โnext friendโ \n \n9 \nto baby girl A.D. and baby boy C. and all off-reservation children with Indian ancestry in \n \n10 \nthe State of Arizona in child custody proceedings. See FRCP 17(c). \n \n11 \n12.  Plaintiffs S.H. and J.H., a married couple, are both citizens of the United \n \n12 \nStates and the State of Arizona, and are residents of and are domiciled in the State of \n \n13 \nArizona. Neither S.H. nor J.H. are enrolled members of a tribe or eligible for membership \n \n14 \nin an Indian tribe. S.H. and J.H. are the only family baby girl A.D. has ever known as she \n \n15 \n  was placed in foster care with them since her birth. Their petition to adopt baby girl A.D. \n16 \n  is pending before the state court properly having jurisdiction over the matter.  \n17 \n  13.  Plaintiffs M.C. and K.C., a married couple, are both citizens of the United \n18 \n  States and the State of Arizona, and are residents of and are domiciled in the State of \n19 \n  Arizona. Neither M.C. nor K.C. are enrolled members of a tribe or eligible for membership \n20 \n  in  an  Indian  tribe.  M.C.  and  K.C.  have  been  foster  parents  to  baby  boy  C.  for \n21 \n  approximately four years. M.C. and K.C. want to adopt baby boy C.  \n22 \n  14.  Defendant Kevin Washburn is the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of \n23 \n  Indian  Affairs  (โBIAโ).  He  has  primary  authority  to  enforce  ICWA  and  the  BIA \n24 \n  Guidelines at issue. He is sued in his official capacity only. \n25 \n \n15.  Defendant  Sally  Jewell  is  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  United  States \n26 \n \nDepartment of the Interior. The Department of the Interior is the cabinet agency of which \n27 \n \n28 \n \n4 of 29 \n\n \n1  BIA is a part and which is assigned enforcement powers under ICWA and Title 25 of \n \n2  United States Code. She is sued in her official capacity only. \n \n3  16.  Defendant Gregory A. McKay is the Director of the Arizona Department of \n \n4  Child Safety (โDCSโ). The Director has statutory duty under Ariz. Rev. Stat. (โA.R.S.โ) \n \n5 \nยง 8-451 et seq. to โprotect children.โ The Director is also required to โ[e]nsure the \n \n6 \ndepartmentโs compliance with the Indian child welfare act of 1978 (P.L. 95-608; 92 Stat. \n \n7 \n3069; 25 United States Code ยงยง 1901 through 1963).โ A.R.S. ยง 8-453(A)(20). He is sued \n \n8 \nin his official capacity only. \n \n9 \nFACTS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS \n \n10 \nI.  Baby Girl A.D. \n \n11 \n17.  DCS took baby girl A.D. into protective custody at birth as she was severely \n \n12 \ndrug-exposed due to her biological motherโs ingestion of several controlled substances, \n \n13 \nand placed her with S.H. and J.H. They have taken care of baby girl A.D. ever since, and \n \n14 \nalthough she has some developmental delays due to her exposure to controlled substances, \n \n15 \n  she has shown remarkable recovery from the deleterious effects of second-hand addiction \n16 \n  under the loving care of S.H. and J.H. \n17 \n  18.  A.D.โs biological mother named two possible birth fathers for baby girl A.D. \n18 \n  Paternity tests on both ruled out the possibility that they were A.D.โs birth fathers. \n19 \n  Consequently, the state court severed parental rights of the birth mother and the absent \n20 \n  birth father. \n21 \n  19.  S.H. and J.H., as foster parents, have taken care of baby girl A.D. since birth. \n22 \n  S.H. and J.H., along with their adopted son who has Indian ancestry, are the only family \n23 \n  that baby girl A.D. has ever known. The tribe has announced it will likely seek in state \n24 \n  court a transfer of the case to tribal court. If their case is transferred, it would force A.D., \n25 \n \nS.H. and J.H., who do not have any contact with the tribal forum, to submit to that forumโs \n26 \n \njurisdiction  over  them.  Such  transfer  and  the  resulting  exercise  of  jurisdiction,  if \n27 \n \nsuccessful, would be solely based on baby girl A.D.โs race. \n28 \n \n5 of 29 \n\n \n1  20.  But for ICWA, A.D. would have been very likely cleared for adoption by \n \n2  S.H. and J.H. If they are awarded adoption, they are willing to provide and encourage \n \n3  appropriate visitation and cultural acclimatization opportunities to A.D. \n \n4  II.  Baby Boy C. \n \n5 \n21.  DCS took baby boy C. into protective custody when he was less than one \n \n6 \nyear old when his biological mother was convicted of a non-drug related felony. His birth \n \n7 \nfather is unknown. The birth mother is on record saying she supports baby boy C.โs \n \n8 \nadoption by M.C. and K.C. \n \n9 \n22.  The relevant state court properly having jurisdiction over the matter has not \n \n10 \ndeclared baby boy C. as available for adoption because the Navajo Nation repeatedly has \n \n11 \nproposed alternative ICWA-compliant placements, all of which have turned out to be \n \n12 \ninappropriate for placement of baby boy C. Baby boy C.โs extended family members have \n \n13 \nexpressly declined to have him placed with them. Other ICWA-compliant placements the \n \n14 \ntribe has proposed have declined to have baby boy C. placed with them. The tribe has \n \n15 \n  repeatedly  asked  for  additional  opportunities  from  state  court  to  find  other  ICWA-\n16 \n  compliant placements. Consequently, baby boy C. has continuously remained in foster \n17 \n  care with M.C. and K.C. for four years. M.C. and K.C. cannot file a petition for adoption \n18 \n  until the state court declares that baby boy C. is available for adoption and that there is \n19 \n  good cause to deviate from ICWAโs adoption placement preferences. \n20 \n  23.  Each time the tribe proposes an ICWA-compliant placement, pursuant to a \n21 \n  court-supervised and DCS-supported case plan, M.C. and K.C. have to drive each week \n22 \n  with baby boy C., sometimes over 100 miles, to visit with the proposed placement to give \n23 \n  baby boy C. an opportunity to bond with the proposed placement until that placement \n24 \n  becomes unavailable for any reason. Baby boy C. instinctively wants to call M.C. and \n25 \n \nK.C. โmommyโ and โdaddy,โ but he is reminded by some proposed placements that M.C. \n26 \n \nand K.C. are not his โmommyโ and โdaddy.โ This has caused significant emotional and \n27 \n \npsychological harm to baby boy C. who, through no fault of his own, has to leave the \n28 \n \n6 of 29 \n\n \n1  security of his home and visit with strangers solely because he was born with Indian \n \n2  ancestry. \n \n3  24.  Due to the application of ICWA, baby boy C. has been languishing in foster \n \n4  care for approximately four years. But for ICWA, baby boy C. would have been very \n \n5 \nlikely cleared for adoption by M.C. and K.C. If they are awarded adoption, they are willing \n \n6 \nto provide and encourage appropriate visitation and cultural acclimatization opportunities \n \n7 \nto baby boy C. \n \n8 \nIII.  All Plaintiffs \n \n9 \n25.  But for ICWA, a strong likelihood exists that these families โ baby girl A.D, \n \n10 \nS.H. and J.H., and baby boy C., M.C. and K.C. โ would be allowed to become permanent \n \n11 \nunder race-neutral Arizona laws permitting individualized evaluation by state court of \n \n12 \nwhat is in baby girl A.D. and baby boy C.โs best interests. But under ICWA, these families \n \n13 \nare subjected to procedural and substantive provisions that are based solely on the race of \n \n14 \nthe children and the adults involved, which lead to severe disruption in their lives contrary \n \n15 \n  to the childrenโs best interests. \n16 \n  26.  In many instances, children subject to ICWA are removed from caring, \n17 \n  loving homes and forced into placements, which sometimes leads to abuse, psychological \n18 \n  harm, or even physical trauma and death. \n19 \n  27.  In many instances, prospective adoptive parents who otherwise would be \n20 \n  allowed to adopt children they have raised since infancy and grown to love are deprived \n21 \n  of the opportunity to form permanent families as a result of ICWA. \n22 \n  28.  In many instances, children are left in abusive or neglectful Indian families \n23 \n  where they are subjected to grave physical or psychological harm as a result of ICWA. \n24 \n  29.  Subjecting  these  children  and  families  to  ICWA  creates  delay  and \n25 \n \nuncertainty in the journey to permanent family status, and the prospect and reality of \n26 \n \ndisplacement from stable, loving families causes great harm to children and great distress \n27 \n \nto prospective adoptive parents.  \n28 \n \n7 of 29 \n\n \n1  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n2  30.  The named plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a class \n \n3  of  all  off-reservation  Arizona-resident  children  with  Indian  ancestry  and  all  off-\n \n4  reservation non-Indian Arizona-resident foster, preadoptive, and prospective adoptive \n \n5 \nparents in child custody proceedings involving a child with Indian ancestry and who are \n \n6 \nnot members of the childโs extended family. \n \n7 \n31.  The  Arizona  Department  of  Child  Safetyโs  semi-annual  Report  to  the \n \n8 \nGovernor for the period of April 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014, attached as Exhibit \n \n9 \n1 to this Complaint, and available at https://www.azdes.gov/InternetFiles/Reports/pdf/ \n \n10 \nsemi_annual_child_welfare_report_apr_sep_2014.pdf (last visited June 25, 2015), reports \n \n11 \nthat as of September 30, 2014 there were 1,336 American Indian children in out-of-home \n \n12 \ncare in Arizona. Id. at 43. The number of foster, preadoptive, and prospective adoptive \n \n13 \nparents of these children is similarly numerous. Their identities are easily ascertainable \n \n14 \nthrough DCS records that are not open for inspection to the public. This putative class is \n \n15 \n  so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. See FRCP 23(a)(1). \n16 \n  32.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class, namely, the facial \n17 \n  and  as-applied  constitutionality  of  several  provisions  of  ICWA  and  accompanying \n18 \n  Guidelines to the members of the class. See FRCP 23(a)(2). \n19 \n  33.  The circumstances of baby girl A.D., S.H. and J.H., and baby boy C., M.C. \n20 \n  and K.C., are typical of children with Indian ancestry and other foster, preadoptive and \n21 \n  prospective adoptive families of children with Indian ancestry. See FRCP 23(a)(3). \n22 \n  34.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n23 \n  class. See FRCP 23(a)(4). \n24 \n  35.  Plaintiffsโ attorneys are experienced in representing litigants before federal \n25 \n \ncourts. Plaintiffsโ counsel include nationally recognized constitutional lawyers who have \n26 \n \nlitigated extensively at every level of the federal judiciary. Plaintiffsโ attorneys are well \n27 \n \nqualified to be appointed class counsel by this Court. \n28 \n \n8 of 29 \n\n \n1  36.  Separate  actions by  individual class  members would create the  risk of \n \n2  inconsistent or incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants, and separate actions \n \n3  by individual class members would substantially impair their ability to protect their \n \n4  interests. See FRCP 23(b)(1). \n \n5 \n37.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \n \n6 \nthe putative class. Thus, final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \n \n7 \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole. See FRCP 23(b)(2). \n \n8 \n38.  Questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate \n \n9 \nover questions affecting individual class members as individual class members are denied \n \n10 \nequal protection under the law and deprived of their constitutional rights. A class action \n \n11 \nis  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient  adjudication  of  the \n \n12 \ncontroversy, inasmuch as the individual class members are deprived of the same rights. \n \n13 \nSee FRCP 23(b)(3). \n \n14 \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n \n15 \n  I.  Definitions \n16 \n  39.  ICWA defines โIndian childโ as โany unmarried person who is under age \n17 \n  eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in \n18 \n  an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribeโ 25 U.S.C. ยง \n19 \n  1903(4). โIndian tribeโ is also statutorily defined at 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(8). \n20 \n  40.  Most Indian tribes have only blood quantum or lineage requirements as \n21 \n  prerequisites for membership. See Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians Const. art. III, ยง 1; \n22 \n  Cherokee Nation Const. art. IV, ยง 1; Choctaw Nation of Okla. Const. art. II, ยง 1; Muscogee \n23 \n  (Creek) Nation Const. art. III, ยง 2; Gila River Indian Community Const. art. III, ยง 1; \n24 \n  Navajo Nation Code ยง 701; Guidelines for State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child \n25 \n \nCustody  Proceedings,  80  Fed.  Reg.  10146,  10153,  B.3  (February  25,  2015)  (โNew \n26 \n \nGuidelinesโ). Consequently, ICWAโs definition of โIndian childโ is based solely on the \n27 \n \nchildโs race or ancestry. \n28 \n \n9 of 29 \n\n \n1  41.  Some of the tribes consider individuals with only a tiny percentage of Indian \n \n2  blood to be Indian, even if they have little or no contact or connection with the tribe. See, \n \n3  e.g., Cherokee Nation Const. art. IV, ยง 1. \n \n4  42.  Thus, in many instances, children with only a minute quantum of Indian \n \n5 \nblood and no connection or ties to the tribe are subject to ICWA and relegated to the tribeโs \n \n6 \nexclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. See, e.g., Nielson v. Ketchum, 640 F.3d 1117, 1120 \n \n7 \n(10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Chapter 2, Section 11A of the Cherokee Nation Citizenship Act \n \n8 \nwhich automatically admits a child as citizen of the Cherokee Nation at birth โfor the \n \n9 \nspecific purpose of protecting the rights of the Cherokee Nation under the [ICWA]โ \n \n10 \n(brackets in original)). \n \n11 \n43.  The Guidelines for State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child Custody \n \n12 \nProceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10153, B.4(d)(3) (February 25, 2015), state, โIn the \n \n13 \nevent the child is eligible for membership in a tribe but is not yet a member of any tribe, \n \n14 \nthe agency should take the steps necessary to obtain membership for the child in the tribe \n \n15 \n  that is designated as the Indian childโs tribe.โ \n16 \n  44.  โAgencyโ is defined in the New Guidelines as โa private State-licensed \n17 \n  agency or public agency and their employees, agents or officials involved in and/or \n18 \n  seeking to place a child in a child custody proceeding.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10151, A.2.  \n19 \n  45.  ICWA  defines  โchild  custody  proceedingโ  to  include  โfoster  care \n20 \n  placement,โ โtermination of parental rights,โ โpreadoptive placement,โ and โadoptive \n21 \n  placement.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1). \n22 \n  46.  โFoster care placementโ is defined as โany action removing an Indian child \n23 \n  from its parent or Indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution \n24 \n  or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have \n25 \n \nthe child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated.โ 25 \n26 \n \nU.S.C. ยง 1903(1)(i).  \n27 \n \n28 \n \n10 of 29 \n\n \n1  47.  โTermination of parental rightsโ is defined as โany action resulting in the \n \n2  termination of the parent-child relationship.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1)(ii). \n \n3  48.  โPreadoptive placementโ is defined as โthe temporary placement of an \n \n4  Indian child in a foster home or institution after the termination of parental rights, but prior \n \n5 \nto or in lieu of adoptive placement.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1)(iii). \n \n6 \n49.  โAdoptive placementโ is defined as โthe permanent placement of an Indian \n \n7 \nchild for adoption, including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption.โ 25 U.S.C. \n \n8 \nยง 1903(1)(iv). \n \n9 \n50.  โChild custody proceeding,โ as defined, โshall not include a placement \n \n10 \nbased upon an act which, if committed by an adult, would be deemed a crime or upon an \n \n11 \naward, in a divorce proceeding, of custody to one of the parents.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1). \n \n12 \nII.   BIA Guidelines \n \n13 \n51.  The BIA first issued Guidelines in November of 1979. Guidelines for State \n \n14 \nCourts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed. Reg. 67584 (November 26, 1979) \n \n15 \n  (โOld Guidelinesโ or โ1979 Guidelinesโ). On February 25, 2015, the BIA issued new \n16 \n  Guidelines to โsupersede and replaceโ the 1979 Guidelines. Guidelines for State Courts \n17 \n  and Agencies in Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10147 (February \n18 \n  25, 2015) (โNew Guidelinesโ or โ2015 Guidelinesโ). \n19 \n  III.   The Jurisdiction-Transfer Provision \n20 \n  52.  ICWA  requires  state  courts  to  โtransferโ  โfoster  care  placementโ  or \n21 \n  โtermination of parental rightsโ โproceeding[s] to the jurisdiction of the tribeโ of โan \n22 \n  Indian child not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian childโs tribeโ \n23 \n  โin the absence of good cause to the contrary,โ and โabsent objection by either parent,โ if \n24 \n  the โparent or the Indian custodian or the Indian childโs tribeโ petitions for such transfer \n25 \n \nand the tribal court does not decline such transfer. 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b) (โjurisdiction-\n26 \n \ntransfer provisionโ); 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, C.2. The New Guidelines, however, state, \n27 \n \nโThe right to request a transfer is available at any stage of an Indian child custody \n28 \n \n11 of 29 \n\n \n1  proceeding, including during any period of emergency removal.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, \n \n2  C.1(c) (emphasis added).  \n \n3  53.  Whereas ICWAโs jurisdiction-transfer provision is available to transfer only \n \n4  foster care placement and termination of parental rights proceedings to the jurisdiction of \n \n5 \nthe tribe, the BIA, in the New Guidelines, extended the jurisdiction-transfer provision to \n \n6 \nall child custody proceedings. \n \n7 \n54.  โGood causeโ to not transfer a foster care placement or termination of \n \n8 \nparental rights proceeding to tribal court is not defined in ICWA. The New Guidelines, \n \n9 \nhowever, state:  \n \n10   \n  In determining whether good cause exists, the court may not \n11 \nconsider whether the case is at an advanced stage or whether \n \ntransfer would result in a change in the placement of the child \n12 \n  because the Act created concurrent, but presumptively, tribal \n13 \njurisdiction over proceedings involving children not residing \n \nor domiciled on the reservation, and seeks to protect, not only \n14 \n  the rights of the Indian child as an Indian, but the rights of \n15  Indian communities and tribes in retaining Indian children. \n \nThus, whenever a parent or tribe seeks to transfer the case it is \n16 \npresumptively  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Indian  child, \n \n17  consistent with the Act, to transfer the case to the jurisdiction \n  of the Indian tribe. [ยถ] In addition, in determining whether \n18 \nthere is good cause to deny the transfer, the court may not \n \n19  consider: (1) The Indian childโs contacts with the tribe or \n  reservation; (2) Socio-economic conditions or any perceived \n20 \ninadequacy  of  tribal  or  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  social \n \nservices  or  judicial  systems;  or  (3)  the  tribal  courtโs \n21 \n  prospective placement for the Indian child. \n22   \n \n80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, C.3(c)-(d). \n23 \n \n55.  Under uniform Arizona law, when deciding whether to transfer a foster care \n24 \n \nplacement or termination of parental rights proceeding to some other jurisdiction, an \n25 \n \nArizona  state  court  โthat  has  made  a  child  custody  determinationโ  has  โexclusive, \n26 \n \ncontinuing jurisdiction over the determination untilโ either one of the two options is true: \n27 \n   \n28 \n \n12 of 29 \n\n \n1. A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor \n1 \nthe child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as \n \n2  a parent have a significant connection with this state and that \n  substantial  evidence  is  no  longer  available  in  this  state \n3 \nconcerning the childโs care, protection, training and personal \n \n4  relationships. \n  2. A court of this state or a court of another state determines \n5 \nthat the child, the childโs parents and any person acting as a \n \nparent do not presently reside in this state. \n6 \n \nA.R.S. ยง 25-1032(A). \n7 \n \n56.  Thus, while Arizona law looks at the litigantsโ contacts with the forum in \n8 \n \ndeciding whether to transfer a foster care placement or termination of parental rights \n9 \n \nproceeding to some other jurisdiction, ICWA and the New Guidelines explicitly instruct \n10 \n \n11  courts to not take into account the litigantsโ contacts with the tribal forum.  \n \n12  IV.  The Active Efforts Provision \n \n13  57.  Further,  ICWA  states  that  โ[a]ny  party  seeking  to  effect  a  foster  care \n \n14  placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall \n \n15  satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and \n \n16  rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these \n \n17  efforts have proved unsuccessful.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(d) (emphasis added) (โactive efforts \n \n18  provisionโ).  \n \n19  58.  The New Guidelines state: โActive efforts are intended primarily to maintain \n \n20  and reunite an Indian child with his or her family or tribal community and constitute more \n \n21 \nthan reasonable efforts as required by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n \n22 \n671(a)(15)).โฆโActive effortsโ are separate and distinct from requirements of the Adoption \n \n23 \nand Safe Families Act (ASFA), 42 U.S.C. 1305. ASFAโs exceptions to reunification \n \n24 \nefforts do not apply to ICWA proceedings.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10150-51, A.2 (emphasis in \n \n25 \noriginal).  \n \n26 \n59.  DCS, under the active efforts provision, is required to โ[i]dentify[], notify[], \n \n27 \nand invit[e] representatives of the Indian childโs tribe to participateโ in the active efforts \n \n28 \n \n13 of 29 \n\n \n1  to  reunite  the  Indian  child  with  the  childโs  โfamilyโ  and  โtribal  community.โ  New \n \n2  Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at 10150, A.2.  \n \n3  60.  DCS, under the active efforts provision, is required to โ[t]ak[e] into account \n \n4  the Indian childโs tribeโs prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of lifeโ even in \n \n5 \nsituations where the child or the childโs parents have never been exposed to or followed \n \n6 \nthe tribeโs prevailing social and cultural conditions or way of life.

DCS is also required \n \n7 \nโto assure cultural connections,โ โ[s]upport[] regular visits and trial home visits of the \n \n8 \nIndian child during any period of removal,โ and โ[o]ffer[] and employ[] all available and \n \n9 \nculturally appropriate family preservation strategies.โ Id. \n \n10 \n61.  The New Guidelines provide details on when the requirement for active \n \n11 \nefforts begins and what actions an agency and State court must take in order to determine \n \n12 \nwhether a child is an Indian child and how to comply with the active efforts requirement. \n \n13 \n80 Fed. Reg. at 10152-153, A.3, B.1-B.2, B.4, B.8, D.2. \n \n14 \n62.  The New Guidelines require DCS to โtreat the child as an Indian child, \n \n15 \n  unless and until it is determined that the child is not a member or is not eligible for \n16 \n  membership in an Indian tribe,โ โ[i]f there is any reason to believe the child is an Indian \n17 \n  child.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10152, A.3(d).  \n18 \n  63.  The New Guidelines require DCS to engage in active efforts โfrom the \n19 \n  moment the possibility arises that โฆ the Indian child [will] be placed outside the custody \n20 \n  of either parent or Indian custodianโ and also โwhile investigatingโ whether ICWA applies \n21 \n  to a particular child. 80 Fed. Reg. at 10152, B.1(a)-(b). \n22 \n  64.  If a child is suspected to be an Indian child, DCS may be required to provide \n23 \n  โ[g]enograms or ancestry charts for both parents, โฆ maternal and paternal grandparents \n24 \n  and great grandparents or Indian custodians; birthdates; โฆ tribal affiliation including all \n25 \n \nknown Indian ancestry for individuals listed on the charts[.]โ New Guidelines, 80 Fed. \n26 \n \nReg. at 10152, B.2(b)(1)(i). \n27 \n \n28 \n \n14 of 29 \n\n \n1  65.  โIn the event the child is eligible for membership in a tribe but is not yet a \n \n2  member of any tribe,โ the New Guidelines require DCS to โtake the steps necessary to \n \n3  obtain membership for the child in the tribe that is designated as the Indian childโs tribe.โ \n \n4  80 Fed. Reg. at 10153, B.4(d)(3). \n \n5 \n66.  In emergency removal situations where DCS โknows or has reason to knowโ \n \n6 \nthat a child is an Indian child, DCS is required to โ[t]reat the child as an Indian child until \n \n7 \nthe court determines that the child is not an Indian child.โ New Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. \n \n8 \nat 10155, B.8(c)(1). \n \n9 \n67.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 671(a)(15), as amended by ASFA, the โreasonable \n \n10 \neffortsโ standard is pervasive under Arizona Law. See, e.g., A.R.S. ยงยง 8-513 (foster care \n \n11 \nplacement), 8-522 (dependency actions), 8-825 (preliminary protective hearing), 8-829 \n \n12 \n(same), 8-843 (initial dependency hearing), 8-845 (dependency determination), 8-846 \n \n13 \n(same), 8-862 (permanency hearing).  \n \n14 \n68.  Whereas โactive effortsโ are required not only to โmaintain and reunite an \n \n15 \n  Indian child with his or her familyโ but also with the childโs โtribal community,โ New \n16 \n  Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at 10150, A.2, โreasonable effortsโ under Arizona law are \n17 \n  required only to maintain and reunite the child with the childโs family. See, e.g., A.R.S. ยง \n18 \n  8-522(E)(3). \n19 \n  69.  Arizona DCS applies the active efforts provision to children with Indian \n20 \n  ancestry, and the โreasonable effortsโ provision to all other children. The New Guidelines \n21 \n  explicitly state that the active efforts provision is โmore thanโ the reasonable efforts \n22 \n  provision. Consequently, children with Indian ancestry  are singled out and afforded \n23 \n  separate, unequal treatment resulting in delayed resolution of foster care placement and \n24 \n  termination of parental rights proceedings of children with Indian ancestry, based solely \n25 \n \non their race.  \n26 \n   \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n15 of 29 \n\n \n1  V.  Burden of Proof in Foster Care Placement Orders \n \n2  70.  ICWA further requires that โNo foster care placement may be ordered in [an \n \n3  involuntary]  proceeding  in  the  absence  of  a  determination,  supported  by  clear  and \n \n4  convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued \n \n5 \ncustody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional \n \n6 \nor physical damage to the child.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(e).  \n \n7 \n71.  The New Guidelines state: โThe court may not issue an order effecting a \n \n8 \nfoster care placement of an Indian child unless clear and convincing evidence is presented, \n \n9 \nincluding the testimony of one or more qualified expert witnesses, demonstrating that the \n \n10 \nchildโs continued custody with the childโs parents or Indian custodian is likely to result in \n \n11 \nserious harm to the child.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, D.3(a). \n \n12 \n72.  Under Arizona law, to take a child into temporary custody, there must be a \n \n13 \nshowing that โreasonable grounds exist to  believe that temporary custody is clearly \n \n14 \nnecessary to protect the child from suffering abuse or neglectโ and that โprobable cause \n \n15 \n  exists to believeโ that, inter alia, the child is or will imminently become a victim of abuse \n16 \n  or neglect, or is suffering from serious physical or emotional injury. A.R.S. ยง 8-821(A)-\n17 \n  (B); ยง 8-824(F) (โThe petitioner has the burden of presenting evidence as to whether there \n18 \n  is probable cause to believe that continued temporary custody is clearly necessary to \n19 \n  prevent abuse or neglect pending the hearing on the dependency petitionโ); A.R.S. ยง 8-\n20 \n  843  (โreasonable  effortsโ  standard  in  initial  dependency  hearings);  A.R.S.  ยง  8-844 \n21 \n  (โpreponderance of the evidenceโ standard in dependency adjudication hearings). \n22 \n  73.   Thus, ICWA requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence whereas \n23 \n  Arizona law requires a showing of โreasonable grounds,โ โprobable cause,โ โreasonable \n24 \n  efforts,โ or โpreponderance of the evidenceโ at various stages of proceedings leading to \n25 \n \nfoster care placement of children. Consequently, ICWAโs higher burden of proof requires \n26 \n \nDCS to disregard to a greater extent the safety and security of children with Indian \n27 \n \nancestry based solely on the race of these children.  \n28 \n \n16 of 29 \n\n \nVI.   Burden of Proof in Termination of Parental Rights Orders \n1 \n \n74.  ICWA requires that โNo termination of parental rights may be ordered in \n2 \n \n[an involuntary] proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence \n3 \n \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the \n4 \n \ncontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious \n5 \n \nemotional or physical damage to the child.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(f). \n6 \n \n75.  The New  Guidelines state: โThe court  may not order a termination of \n7 \n \nparental rights unless the courtโs order is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable \n8 \n \ndoubt,  supported  by  the  testimony  of  one  or  more  qualified  expert  witnesses,  that \n9 \n \n10  continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious \n \n11  harm to the child.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, D.3(b). \n \n12  76.  Under  Arizona  law,  โArizonaโs  statutes  require  that  the  party  seeking \n \n13  termination of parental rights establish only the statutory grounds of section 8-533 by clear \n \n14  and convincing evidence and establish the best interests of the child by a preponderance \n \n15  of the evidence.โ Kent K. v. Bobby M., 110 P.3d 1013, 1018 (Ariz. 2005) (interpreting \n \n16  A.R.S. ยงยง 8-533, 8-537).  \n \n17  77.  Thus, ICWA requires a showing of beyond a reasonable doubt whereas \n \n18  Arizona law requires use of the clear and convincing evidence standard in termination of \n \n19  parental  rights  proceedings.  Consequently,  ICWAโs  higher  burden  of  proof,  which \n \n20 \nexplicitly does not take into account the best interests of the child, places greater burdens \n \n21 \non children with Indian ancestry than does Arizona law uniformly applied to all other \n \n22 \nchildren. This separate, unequal treatment of children with Indian ancestry is based solely \n \n23 \non the childโs race. \n \n24 \nVII.  Foster/Preadoptive Care Placement Preferences \n \n25 \n78.  Under ICWA: \n \n26   \n  In any foster care or preadoptive placement, a preference shall \n27 \nbe given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a \n \n28  placement withโ \n \n17 of 29 \n\n \n(i) a member of the Indian childโs extended family; \n1 \n(ii) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the \n \n2  Indian childโs tribe; \n  (iii)  an  Indian  foster  home  licensed  or  approved  by  an \n3 \nauthorized non-Indian licensing authority; or \n \n4  (iv) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or \n  operated  by  an  Indian  organization  which  has  a  program \n5 \nsuitable to meet the Indian childโs needs. \n \n6 \n25 U.S.C. ยง 1915(b) (emphasis added). \n \n7 \n79.  The New Guidelines state:  \n \n8   \n  The agency seeking a preadoptive, adoptive or foster care \n9 \nplacement  of  an  Indian  child  must  always  follow  the \n \nplacement preferences. If the agency determines that any of \n10 \n  the preferences cannot be met, the agency must demonstrate \n11  through clear and convincing evidence that a diligent search \n \nhas been conducted to seek out and identify placement options \n12 \nthat  would  satisfy  the  placement  preferences  specified  in \n \n13  sections F.2 or F.3 of these guidelines, and explain why the \n  preferences could not be met.  \n14 \n  80 Fed. Reg. at 10157, F.1(b) (emphasis added). \n15 \n  80.  Although โgood causeโ to not apply the foster care placement preferences \n16 \n  is not defined in ICWA, the New Guidelines state: \n17 \n \n \n18  (a) If any party asserts that good cause not to follow the \n  placement preferences exists, the reasons for such belief or \n19 \nassertion must be stated on the record or in writing and made \n \n20  available to the parties to the proceeding and the Indian childโs \n  tribe. \n21 \n(b) The party seeking departure from the preferences bears the \n \nburden  of  proving  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  the \n22 \n  existence  of  โgood  causeโ  to  deviate  from  the  placement \n23  preferences. \n \n(c)  A  determination  of  good  cause  to  depart  from  the \n24 \nplacement preferences must be based on one or more of the \n \n25  following considerations: \n \n  (1) The request of the parents, if both parents attest that \n26 \nthey have reviewed the placement options that comply with \n \n27  the order of preference. \n \n28 \n \n18 of 29 \n\n \n  (2) The request of the child, if the child is able to \n1 \nunderstand and comprehend the decision that is being made. \n \n2    (3) The extraordinary physical or emotional needs of \n  the child, such as specialized treatment services that may be \n3 \nunavailable in the community where families who meet the \n \n4  criteria live, as established by testimony of a qualified expert \n  witness; provided that extraordinary physical or emotional \n5 \nneeds  of  the  child  does  not  include  ordinary  bonding  or \n \nattachment that may have occurred as a result of a placement \n6 \n  or the fact that the child has, for an extended amount of time, \n7  been in another placement that does not comply with the Act. \n \nThe  good  cause  determination  does  not  include  an \n8 \n  independent consideration of the best interest of the Indian \n9  child because the preferences reflect the best interests of an \n \nIndian child in light of the purposes of the Act. \n10 \n  (4) The unavailability of a placement after a showing \n \n11  by the applicable agency in accordance with section F.1, and \n  a determination by the court that active efforts have been made \n12 \nto find placements meeting the preference criteria, but none \n \nhave been located. For purposes of this analysis, a placement \n13 \n  may not be considered unavailable if the placement conforms \n14  to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian \n \ncommunity in which the Indian childโs parent or extended \n15 \n  family  resides  or  with  which  the  Indian  childโs parent  or \n16  extended family members maintain social and cultural ties. \n \n(d) The court should consider only whether a placement in \n17 \naccordance with the preferences meets the physical, mental \n \n18  and emotional needs of the child; and may not depart from the \n  preferences  based  on  the  socio-economic  status  of  any \n19 \nplacement relative to another placement. \n \n20 \n80 Fed. Reg. at 10158, F.4 (emphasis added). \n \n21 \n81.  The standard applied to all other children in Arizona is markedly different \n \n22 \nfrom the standard applied to children with Indian ancestry. For foster care placements, \n \n23 \nArizona courts look at whether there was reasonable evidence to find that placing a child \n \n24 \nwith the foster family instead of an extended family member was in the childโs โbest \n \n25 \ninterests.โ Antonio M. v. Ariz. Dept. of Econ. Sec., 214 P.3d 1010, 1012 (Ariz. App. 2009). \n \n26 \nCourts in such situations also give weight to the fact that โthe foster parents wished to \n \n27 \nadopt [the child].โ Id. See also Antonio P. v. Ariz. Dept. of Econ. Sec., 187 P.3d 1115, \n \n28 \n \n19 of 29 \n\n \n1  1117 (Ariz. App. 2008) (analyzing what is in the childโs best interest in foster care \n \n2  placements and giving weight to the fact that the child had an โundeniabl[y]โ โlonger \n \n3  relationshipโ with one placement than with the other). \n \n4  VIII.  Adoption Placement Preferences \n \n5 \n82.  Under ICWA, \n \n \n6 \n  In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, \n7  a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to \n \nthe contrary, to a placement with \n8 \n  (1) a member of the childโs extended family; \n9  (2) other members of the Indian childโs tribe; or \n \n(3) other Indian families. \n10 \n  25 U.S.C. ยง 1915(a). \n11 \n \n12  83.  The  New  Guidelines  require  state  courts  to  follow  ICWAโs  adoption \n \n13  placement preferences. 80 Fed. Reg. at 10157, F.1(b) (โThe agency seeking a[n] โฆ \n \n14  adoptive โฆ placement of an Indian child must always follow the placement preferencesโ) \n \n15  (emphasis added). \n \n16  84.  Although โgood causeโ to not apply the adoption placement preferences is \n \n17  not defined in ICWA, the New Guidelines, as reproduced above, specifically state that the \n \n18  โgood cause determination does not include an independent consideration of the best \n \n19  interest of the Indian child because the preferences reflect the best interests of an Indian \n \n20  child in light of the purposes of the Act.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10158, F.4. \n \n21 \n85.  Due to the mandatory language of the New Guidelines, there is an inherent \n \n22 \nconflict between the duty of DCS, an โagencyโ within the meaning of the New Guidelines, \n \n23 \nto โprotect childrenโ and its application of ICWA to children with Indian ancestry.  \n \n24 \n86.  The placement preferences, as applied under the New Guidelines, do not \n \n25 \nlook to the interests-of-the-child factors that state courts have traditionally applied in \n \n26 \nentering foster care placement, preadoption and adoption orders, and thereby deprive \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n20 of 29 \n\n \n1  children with Indian ancestry of an individualized race-neutral determination that all other \n \n2  children enjoy under state law.  \n \n3  87.  States  cannot  disregard  a  childโs  unique  background  in  making  an \n \n4  individualized  and  race-neutral  foster,  preadoptive  or  adoptive  assessment,  and  in \n \n5 \nterminating parental rights. But the states cannot also turn a blind eye to the childโs safety, \n \n6 \nsecurity and best interests based solely on the childโs or the adultsโ race, for such action is \n \n7 \nnecessarily  based  on  inherently  demeaning,  stereotypical  assumptions  about  an \n \n8 \nindividualโs race or culture. Although the court did not reach constitutional issues, a core \n \n9 \npremise of the Baby Veronica decision, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, __ U.S. __, 133 S. \n \n10 \nCt. 2552 (2013), was that ICWA cannot force a child to create a racially-conforming \n \n11 \nrelationship and that a child should not be made to sever existing relationships in order to \n \n12 \ncreate new racially-conforming ones. \n \n13 \n \n \n14  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n15  COUNT 1 โ VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION GUARANTEE OF \n \nTHE FIFTH AMENDMENT \n16 \n  88.

The jurisdiction-transfer provision, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b), New Guidelines at \n19 \n \nยงยง C.1, C.2, C.3, is based solely on the race of the child and the adults involved. \n20 \n \n90.

The clear and convincing evidence burden of proof in foster care placement \n24 \n \norders under ICWA, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(e), New Guidelines at ยง D.3, that is applicable to \n25 \n \nchildren with Indian ancestry as compared to Arizonaโs demonstrably lesser burden of \n26 \n \nproof that is applicable to all other children is a legally required, unequal treatment of \n27 \n \n28 \n \n21 of 29 \n\n \n1  children with Indian ancestry. Government cannot treat the safety and security of children \n \n2  with Indian ancestry less seriously than the safety and security of all other children. \n \n3  92.  The beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof in termination of parental \n \n4  rights proceedings under ICWA, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(f), New Guidelines at ยง D.3, that is \n \n5 \napplicable to children with Indian ancestry as compared to Arizonaโs demonstrably lesser \n \n6 \nburden of proof that is applicable to all other children is a legally required separate, \n \n7 \nunequal treatment of children with Indian ancestry. Government cannot treat the best \n \n8 \ninterests of children with Indian ancestry differently and less seriously than those of all \n \n9 \nother children. \n \n10 \n93.

They also single out and treat differently the \n \n13 \nnon-Indian adults involved in the care and upbringing of children with Indian ancestry.  \n \n14 \n94.  The jurisdiction-transfer provision, active efforts provision, burden of proof \n \n15 \n  in foster care placement orders provision, burden of proof in termination of parental rights \n16 \n  orders  provision,  foster/preadoptive  care  placement  preferences  provision,  and  the \n17 \n  adoption placement preferences provision of ICWA, and New Guidelines, all subject \n18 \n  Plaintiffs to unequal treatment under the law based solely on the race of the child and the \n19 \n  adults involved and are therefore unconstitutional under the equal protection guarantee of \n20 \n  the Fifth Amendment.  \n21 \n  95.  Because the foregoing provisions of ICWA and the New Guidelines do not \n22 \n  serve a compelling governmental purpose in a narrowly tailored fashion, they violate the \n23 \n  equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. \n24 \n \n \n25  COUNT 2 โ VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS GUARANTEE OF THE \n  FIFTH AMENDMENT \n26 \n  96.

Defendant McKayโs compliance with and enforcement of these provisions \n20 \n \nsubjects Plaintiffs to unequal treatment under color of state and federal law based solely \n21 \n \non the race of the child and the adults involved and therefore deprives Plaintiffs of equal \n22 \n \nprotection of the law under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n23 \n \nSee 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n24 \n \n25  108.

By virtue of ICWA, the tribes make the primary determination whether \n \n14 \nchildren with a specified blood quantum will be brought within their jurisdiction and \n \n15 \ncontrol. \n \n16 \n116.  Many children who are subject to ICWA have few, if any, ties to the tribe \n \n17 \nupon which ICWA confers jurisdiction over them. Some but not all are members of the \n \n18 \ntribes but do not thereby consent to surrender their constitutional rights. Some are enrolled \n \n19 \nin the tribes as a result of the mandates of ICWA and the New Guidelines. Others are not \n \n20 \n  members and have virtually no connection to the tribes other than a prescribed blood \n21 \n  quantum. See New Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at 10153, B.4(d)(3). \n22 \n  117.  By operation of ICWA, Plaintiff children like baby girl A.D. and baby boy \n23 \n  C. are forced to associate with tribes and tribal communities and be subject to tribal \n24 \n  jurisdiction often against their will and/or contrary to their best interests. See id. at 10150, \n25 \n  A.2 (active efforts required to reunify an Indian child not only with the childโs family but \n26 \n  also with the childโs tribe). \n27 \n \n28 \n \n26 of 29 \n\n \n1  118.

Whereas ICWAโs jurisdiction-transfer provision is available to transfer only \n9 \n  foster care placement and termination of parental rights proceedings to the jurisdiction of \n10 \n  the tribe, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b), the New Guidelines state, โThe right to request a transfer \n11 \n  is available at any stage of an Indian child custody proceeding, including during any \n12 \n  period of emergency removal.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, C.1(c) (emphasis added). Further, \n13 \n  the  New  Guidelines  instruct  state  courts  that they  โmust  transferโ  all  child  custody \n14 \n  proceedings if the parent does not object to the transfer, the tribal court does not decline, \n15 \n \nand there is no good cause to deny transfer. New Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. 10156, C.2, \n16 \n \nC.3. \n17 \n \n121.

See 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1) (definitions). \n21 \n \n122.  BIA overstepped its authority by extending, in the New Guidelines, the \n22 \n \njurisdiction-transfer provision to all child custody proceedings. Such extension, which \n23 \n \ndirectly contradicts a Congress-enacted provision, harms children in cases where parental \n24 \n \n25  rights have been terminated.

BACKGROUND \n2  Plaintiffs filed this action on behalf of themselves and all off-reservation Arizona-\n3  resident children with Indian ancestry and all off-reservation Arizona-resident foster, \n4  preadoptive, and prospective adoptive parents in child custody proceedings involving \n5  children with Indian ancestry.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that provisions of the Indian \n6  Child  Welfare  Act  (โICWAโ),  specifically  25  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1911(b),  1912(d),  1912(e), \n7  1912(f),  1915(a),  1915(b),  and  the  2015  Guidelines  issued  by  the  Bureau  of  Indian \n8  Affairs, ยงยง A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2, B.4, B.8, C.1, C.2, C.3, D.2, D.3, F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4, violate \n9  the United States Constitution, federal civil rights statutes, and Title VI of the Civil \n10  Rights Act.  They seek to enjoin the Federal Defendants from enforcing these provisions \n11  and  the  State  Defendant  from  complying  with  and  enforcing  these  provisions.    In \n12  addition, Plaintiffs allege that ICWA exceeds the federal governmentโs power under the \n13  Indian  Commerce  Clause  and  the  Tenth  Amendment,  but  do  not  expressly  seek  a \n14  declaration that all of the provisions of ICWA are unconstitutional. \n15  Plaintiff C.C. is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation.  Parental rights of \n16  C.C.โs birth parents were terminated, and adoption of C.C. by Plaintiffs M.C. and K.C. \n17  was finalized by the state court in November 2015.   \n18  Plaintiff A.D. is an enrolled member of the Indian Community.  Plaintiff C.R. is \n19  eligible for membership in and is a child of a member of, or is already an enrolled \n20  member of, the Indian Community.  Plaintiff L.G. is C.R.โs half-sibling and is not eligible \n21  for membership in the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona.  Parental rights of A.D.โs, C.R.โs, \n22  and L.G.โs birth parents have been terminated by the state court, which is treating C.R.โs \n23  and L.G.โs cases as one.   \n24  The Gila River Indian Community (โIndian Communityโ) and the Navajo Nation \n25  are both federally recognized tribes and seek to intervene as of right as defendants in this \n26  case and, in the alternative, to intervene permissively.   \n27 \n28 \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 3 of 10\n \n \n \n1  II.  INTERVENTION OF RIGHT \n2 \nA.  Legal Standard \n3 \nOn timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who โclaims an \n4 \ninterest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so \n5 \nsituated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the \n6 \nmovantโs ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that \n7 \ninterest.โ    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  24(a)(2).    โCourts  are  guided  primarily  by  practical  and \n8 \nequitable considerations.โ  Arakaki v. Cayetano, 324 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir. 2003).   \n9 \nโ[A]n  applicant  for  intervention  as  of  right  must  demonstrate  that:    (1)  the \n10 \nintervention application is timely; (2) the applicant has a significant protectable interest \n11 \nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the disposition \n12 \nof the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicantโs ability to protect \n13 \nits interest; and (4) the existing parties may not adequately represent the applicantโs \n14 \ninterest.โ  Prete v. Bradbury, 438 F.3d 949, 954 (9th Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).  The \n15 \nrequirements are broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.  Citizens for Balanced Use \n16 \nv. Montana Wilderness Assโn, 647 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2011).  However, โ[f]ailure to \n17 \nsatisfy any one of the requirements is fatal to the application.โ  Perry v. Proposition 8 \n18 \nOfficial Proponents, 587 F.3d 947, 950 (9th Cir. 2009).   \n19 \nTimeliness.  Three factors are considered to determine whether an intervention \n20 \nmotion is timely:  (1) the stage of the proceeding when the motion is filed; (2) the \n21 \nprejudice to other parties; and (3) the reason for and length of the delay.  League of \n22 \nUnited Latin Am. Citizens v. Wilson, 131 F.3d 1297, 1302 (9th Cir. 1997).   \n23 \nInterest.  To demonstrate a related significant protectable interest, the applicant \n24 \nmust show an interest that is protectable under some law and there is a relationship \n25 \nbetween the legally protected interest and the claims at issue.  Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1084.  \n26 \nThe  โrelationshipโ  requirement  generally  is  satisfied  only  if  the  resolution  of  the \n27 \nplaintiffโs claims actually will affect the applicant.  Id.  The applicant may not inject \n28 \nunrelated issues into the pending litigation.  Id.  The applicant need not establish a \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 4 of 10\n \n \n \n1  specific legal or equitable interest, but an economic stake in the outcome of the litigation \n2  is not sufficient.  Greene v. United States, 996 F.2d 973, 976 (9th Cir. 1993). \n3  Potential impairment of interest.  โThe question of whether protectable interests \n4  will be impaired by litigation must be put in practical terms rather than in legal terms.โ  \n5  Akina v. Hawaii, __ F.3d __, 2016 WL 450186, *5 (9th Cir. Aug. 29, 2016) (citation \n6  omitted).    Where  the  applicant  remains  free  to  bring  a  separate  action  or  pursue \n7  alternative means of achieving its ultimate objective, the disposition of the action may not \n8  impair or impede the applicantโs ability to protect its interest.  See id.  โSpeculative \n9  possibilityโ of future impairment of an interest does not outweigh the interjection of \n10  unnecessary  and  distracting  considerations  by  an  intervenor.    United  States  v. \n11  Washington,  593  F.3d  790,  801  (9th  Cir.  2010)  (treaty  tribes  were  not  entitled  to \n12  intervene in recognition proceedings even though a newly recognized tribe might assert \n13  treaty rights in the future).  However, a court must consider whether factual and legal \n14  determinations made in the current proceeding, when upheld by an appellate ruling, may \n15  impair the applicantโs interest by a stare decisis effect in any parallel or subsequent \n16  litigation.  United States v. State of Or., 839 F.2d 635, 638 (9th Cir. 1988). \n17  Adequacy of representation.  โThe burden on proposed intervenors in showing \n18  inadequate representation is minimal, and would be satisfied if they could demonstrate \n19  that representation of their interests โmay beโ inadequate.โ  Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1086.  \n20  Three factors are considered in determining adequacy of representation by the existing \n21  parties:  โ(1) whether the interest of a present party is such that it will undoubtedly make \n22  all of a proposed intervenorโs arguments; (2) whether the present party is capable and \n23  willing to make such arguments; and (3) whether a proposed intervenor would offer any \n24  necessary elements to the proceeding that other parties would neglect.โ  Id.  The most \n25  important factor is how the interest of the prospective intervenorโs interest compares with \n26  the interests of existing parties.  Id.  If the prospective intervenorโs interest is identical to \n27  that  of  an  existing  party,  a  compelling  showing  is  required  to  demonstrate  that \n28  representation is inadequate.  Id.  โWhen an applicant for intervention and an existing \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 5 of 10\n \n \n \n1  party have the same ultimate objective, a presumption of adequacy of representation \n2  arises.โ  Id.   \n3  โThere is also an assumption of adequacy when the government is acting on behalf \n4  of a constituency that it represents.โ  Id.  โIn the absence of a very compelling showing to \n5  the contrary, it will be presumed that a state adequately represents its citizens when the \n6  applicant shares the same interest.โ  Id.; see League of United Latin Am. Citizens, 131 \n7  F.3d at 1305-06 (governor and state attorney generalโs vigorous defense of challenged \n8  initiative both in court and in the political arena demonstrated they were ready, willing, \n9  and able to protect prospective intervenorโs asserted interest in upholding the initiative).   \n10  To make a compelling showing that the government will not provide adequate \n11  representation in defending its statute, a prospective intervenor must demonstrate more \n12  than that it is a beneficiary protected by the statute, Stuart v. Huff, 706 F.3d 345, 353 (4th \n13  Cir. 2013), or that it has greater firsthand knowledge of the impact of legislation on \n14  private  individuals  than  does  the  government,  Prete,  438  F.3d  at  958  n.13.    But  a \n15  prospective  intervenor  may  make  a  compelling  showing  by  demonstrating  that  its \n16  interests are narrower than, and not subsumed in, that of the government.  Californians \n17  For Safe & Competitive Dump Truck Transp. v. Mendonca, 152 F.3d 1184, 1190 (9th \n18  Cir. 1998) (union membersโ interests were potentially โmore narrow and parochialโ than \n19  the interests of the public at large); Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. State of \n20  Minn., 989 F.2d 994, 1001 (8th Cir. 1993) (countiesโ and landownersโ interests in land \n21  value were โnarrower and more parochialโ than the stateโs interest in protecting fish and \n22  game).   \n23  Where a tribe requested that the government place certain lands in trust for its \n24  benefit, and the government had an obligation to represent the tribeโs interests, a โmerely \n25  theoretical risk of conflicting dutiesโ did not demonstrate that the government was unable \n26  to adequately protect the tribeโs interests in the litigation.  South Dakota ex rel. Barnett v. \n27  U.S. Depโt of Interior, 317 F.3d 783, 786 (8th Cir. 2003).  To establish inadequacy of \n28 \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 6 of 10\n \n \n \n1  representation, the tribe needed to identify specific tribal interests that could only be \n2  protected by the tribeโs intervention.  Id.   \n3  In  determining  whether  the  government  will  adequately  defend  a  statute,  the \n4  governmentโs willingness to suggest a limiting construction that is narrower than that of \n5  an intervention applicant may be considered.  California ex rel. Lockyer v. United States, \n6  450  F.3d  436,  444  (9th  Cir.  2006).    To  overcome  the  presumption  of  adequacy  of \n7  representation,  the  applicant  must  demonstrate  the  likelihoodโmore  than  mere \n8  theoretical  possibilityโthat  the  government  will  abandon  or  concede  a  potentially \n9  meritorious interpretation of the statute.  Id. at 444-45 (the presumption of adequacy of \n10  representation was rebutted by direct evidence the government would take a position that \n11  actually compromised protection of the proposed intervenorsโ interest); Freedom from \n12  Religion Foundation, Inc. v. Geithner, 644 F.3d 836, 842 (9th Cir. 2011) (presumption \n13  was not rebutted where prospective intervenor had presented no evidence the government \n14  actually  had  urged  a  narrow  interpretation  and  it  was  unclear  whether  a  narrow \n15  interpretation responsive to the constitutional challenge existed).   \n16 \nB.  Analysis \n17 \nTimeliness.  Both motions to intervene were filed at an early stage of this case; \n18 \nmotions to dismiss the amended complaint by the Federal Defendants and the State \n19 \nDefendant have not yet been decided.  The timing of intervention will not cause prejudice \n20 \nto other parties.   \n21 \nSignificant and protectable interest and potential impairment of the interest.  The \n22 \nIndian Community and the Navajo Nation have significant protectable interests in the \n23 \nwelfare of their members who are named as plaintiffs in this case and in laws that protect \n24 \ntheir  relationship  with  all  of  their  minor  citizens.    If  Plaintiffs  prevail,  the  Indian \n25 \nCommunity and the Navajo Nation would be unable to enforce the challenged provisions \n26 \nof ICWA.  State court child custody proceedings would be significantly affected by \n27 \ninvalidation of ICWA provisions that protect the Indian Communityโs and the Navajo \n28 \nNationโs interest in maintaining their relationship with their minor citizens, such as the \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 7 of 10\n \n \n \n1  requirement that active efforts be made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative \n2  programs to prevent the breakup of the Indian family before foster care placement or \n3  termination of parental rights; the burden of proof required for determining that the \n4  continued custody of a child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious \n5  emotional or physical damage to the child; and preferences that favor placement with a \n6  member of the Indian childโs tribe or foster home approved by the tribe. \n7  In addition, the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation have a legal interest in \n8  defining their membership requirements.  But there is no such issue in this suit.  As \n9  conceded at oral argument, none of the 22 recognized Indian tribes in Arizona has a \n10  membership requirement of less than one-quarter Indian blood. That is valid under any \n11  view of implicit federal law limits on tribal membership criteria for ICWA or otherwise.  \n12  Plaintiffs challenge as racially discriminatory specific provisions of ICWA regardless of \n13  the affected childrenโs quantum of Indian blood.   \n14  Adequacy of representation by existing parties.  A presumption of adequacy of \n15  representation arises because the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation share with \n16  the governmental defendants the same ultimate objective, i.e., to uphold ICWA against \n17  Plaintiffsโ constitutional challenge, and because the governmental defendants are acting \n18  on behalf of a constituency that they represent.  Although the Indian Community and the \n19  Navajo Nation have made arguments that the governmental defendants have not made, no \n20  one disputes that the governmental defendants are capable and willing to make those \n21  arguments.  No one contends that the governmental defendants are likely to suggest a \n22  limiting construction of ICWA or to concede a potentially meritorious interpretation of \n23  ICWA.  No one contends that the governmental defendants have conflicting obligations.  \n24  Although the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation each have a particular interest in \n25  maintaining its relationship with its individual members who are named as plaintiffs, \n26  their interest in protecting the tribal-child relationship for every Indian child is shared by \n27  the governmental defendants.  The fact that the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation \n28 \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 8 of 10\n \n \n \n1  have  information  regarding  specific  children  and  tribal  laws  does  not  rebut  the \n2  presumption that the governmental defendants adequately represent their interests. \n3  Therefore,  the  Indian  Community  and  the  Navajo  Nation  are  not  entitled  to \n4  intervention of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2).   \n5 \nIII.  PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION \n6 \nA.  Legal Standard \n7 \nOn timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who โhas a claim or \n8 \ndefense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.โ  Fed. R. Civ. \n9 \nP.  24(b)(1)(B).    To  obtain  permissive  intervention,  an  applicant  must  show:    (1) \n10 \nindependent grounds for jurisdiction, (2) the motion is timely, and (3) the applicantโs \n11 \nclaim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.  League \n12 \nof  United  Latin  Am.  Citizens  v.  Wilson,  131  F.3d  1297,  1308  (9th  Cir.  1997).    โIn \n13 \nexercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly \n14 \ndelay  or  prejudice  the  adjudication  of  the  original  partiesโ  rights.โ    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n15 \n24(b)(3).   \n16 \nB.  Analysis \n17 \nJurisdiction.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 \n18 \nand  1346  of  this  action  against  federal  defendants,  challenging  a  federal  statute  as \n19 \nviolative of the United States Constitution, federal civil rights statutes, and Title VI of the \n20 \nCivil Rights Act.  The Indian Community and the Navajo Nation seek to intervene only \n21 \nas defendants, not to assert additional claims. \n22 \nTimeliness.  The motions to intervene are timely. \n23 \nCommon question of law or fact.  The Indian Community and the Navajo Nation \n24 \nhave questions of law and fact in common with the main action.  They seek to defend the \n25 \nconstitutionality of the challenged provisions of ICWA, particularly against Plaintiffsโ \n26 \nallegations that these provisions create unequal treatment based solely on the race of the \n27 \nchild and the adults involved.  Indeed, the adequacy of the existing partiesโ representation \n28 \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 9 of 10\n \n \n \n1  of the Indian Community and the Nationโs interests, which the Court has already found, \n2  could not even arise if there were not common questions of fact and law. \n3  Undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the original partiesโ rights.  The \n4  Court finds that permitting intervention by the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation \n5  will not cause any undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the existing partiesโ \n6  rights.  During oral argument, counsel for the prospective intervenors stated they did not \n7  anticipate  making  discovery  requests  and  they  would  abide  by  any  limitations  on \n8  discovery that the Court may impose to mitigate possible burden on the existing parties.  \n9  Counsel  further  stated  that  Intervenors-Applicant  want  to  participate  in  this  case  as \n10  parties only for as long as their children members continue as named Plaintiffs.  Further, \n11  if the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation are permitted to intervene, other tribes \n12  likely will not be allowed to intervene in the future because other tribes will be doubly \n13  adequately  represented  by  the  governmental  defendants  and  by  these  two  intervenor \n14  tribes.  See Arakaki, 324 F.3d at 1087 (intervention by native Hawaiians denied where a \n15  group of native Hawaiians already had successfully intervened as party). \n16  Therefore, the Court will exercise its discretion to grant permissive intervention to \n17  the Indian Community and the Navajo Nation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n18  24(b)(1)(B).    If  the  Indian  Communityโs  or  the  Navajo  Nationโs  participation  as \n19  intervenors  should  evidence  the  kinds  of  problems  that  weigh  against  permissive \n20  intervention, such as expansion of issues or unwarranted burdens on existing parties, the \n21  Court may reconsider this order in the future. \n22  IT  IS  THEREFORE  ORDERED  that  the  Motion  of  the  Gila  River  Indian \n23  Community to Intervene as Defendant (Doc. 47) and the Amended Motion to Intervene \n24  by the Navajo Nation (Doc. 198) are denied with respect to intervention of right and \n25  granted for permissive intervention. \n26  / / / \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 216   Filed 09/29/16   Page 10 of 10\n \n \n \n1  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk is directed to file the Gila River \n2  Indian Communityโs proposed motion to dismiss (lodged as Doc. 47-1) and the Navajo \n3  Nationโs proposed amended motion to dismiss (lodged as Doc. 199). \n4  Dated this 29th day of September, 2016. \n5   \n6 \nNeil V.

Byhonoring the moral imperatives enshrined in our Constitution, this nation\n3 has successfullyshed much of its historyof legallysanctioned discrimination on the basis \n4 of race or ethnicity. We have seen in vivid, shameful detail how separate treatment is \n5 inherentlyunequal. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954). There can be \n6 no law under our Constitution that creates and applies pervasive separate and unequal \n7 treatment to individuals based on a quantum of blood tracing to a particular race or \n8 ethnicity. This country committed itself to that principle when it ratified the Fourteenth \n9 Amendment and overturned Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1857), and when it \n10 abandoned Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).\n11 2. In 1994 and again in 1996, Congress recognized that race and ethnicity\n12 should play no role in state-approved adoptions when it enacted the Multiethnic Placement \n13 Act, Pub. L. 103-382, ยงยง 551โ553,  codified at 42  U.S.C.  ยง  5115a  (1994),  and  the \n14 Interethnic Placement Act, Pub. L. 104-188, ยง 1808, codified at 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 671(a), \n15 674(d),  1996b  (1996),  which  forbid  discrimination  in  adoptions  and  foster  care \n16 placements.\n17 3. Children with Indian ancestry, however, are still living in the era of Plessy \n18 v. Ferguson. Alone among American children, their adoption and foster care placements\n19 are determined not in accord with their best interests but bytheir ethnicity, as a result of a\n20 well-intentioned but profoundlyflawed and unconstitutional federal law, the Indian Child\n21 Welfare Act (โICWAโ), codified at 25 U.S.C. ยงยง 1901โ1963.\n22 4. This civil rights class action is filed by Plaintiffs baby girl A.D., baby boy \n23 C.C., babygirl L.G.,and babyboyC.R., byCarol Coghlan Carterand Dr. Ronald Federici, \n24 their next friends, and S.H. and J.H., foster/adoptive parents of baby girl A.D., M.C. and \n25 K.C., adoptive parents of baby boy C.C., and P.R. and K.R., foster/adoptive parents of \n26 babygirl L.G. and baby boyC.R.They file this action on behalf of themselves and all off-\n27 reservation  Arizona-resident  children  with  Indian  ancestry and  all  off-reservation \n28\n2of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 3 of 108\n1 Arizona-resident foster, preadoptive, and prospective adoptive parents in child custody \n2 proceedings involving children with Indian ancestry.\n3 5.  They seek a declaration by this Court that certain provisions of ICWA, and \n4 Guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), both facially and as applied, \n5 violate the United States Constitution. Theyalso seek an injunction from this Court against \n6 the application of certain provisions of ICWA and the accompanying BIA Guidelines, and \n7 nominal damages under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. ยง 2000dโ2000d-7).\n8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n9 6.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331.\n10 7.  This Court is authorized to grant declaratory and injunctive relief under 5 \n11 U.S.C. ยงยง 701 through 706, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and 2202, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Federal Rules \n12 of Civil Procedure (โFRCPโ) 57 and 65, and by the general and equitable powers of the \n13 federal judiciary. This Court is authorized to grant nominal damages, and declaratoryand \n14 injunctive relief under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000dโ2000d-7).\n15 8.

Plaintiffs M.C. and K.C., a married couple, are both citizens of the United \n23 States and the State of Arizona, and are residents of and are domiciled in the State of \n24 Arizona. Neither M.C. nor K.C. are enrolled members of a tribe or eligible for membership \n25 in an Indian tribe. M.C. and K.C. were foster parents to baby boy C.C. for approximately \n26 four years. M.C. and K.C. adopted babyboyC.C. in November, 2015.\n27 17. Plaintiffs K.R. and P.R. are foster parents of baby girl L.G. and baby boy \n28 C.R.

Neither \n2 K.R. nor P.R. are enrolled members of a tribe or eligible for membership in an Indian \n3 tribe. K.R. and P.R. are the only family baby boy C.R. has ever known as he was placed \n4 in foster care with them since birth. K.R. and P.R. have been foster parents to baby girl \n5 L.G. and baby boy C.R. for approximately 1.5 years and want to adopt L.G. and C.R.\n6 18.  Defendant Kevin Washburn is the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs of \n7 the Bureau of Indian Affairs (โBIAโ). He has primary authorityto enforce ICWA and the \n8 BIA Guidelines at issue. He is sued in his official capacity only.\n9 19.  Defendant  Sally Jewell  is  the  Secretary of  the  Interior,  United  States \n10 Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior is the cabinet agencyof which\n11 BIA is a part and which is assigned enforcement powers under ICWA and Title 25 of \n12 United States Code. She is sued in her official capacityonly.\n13 20.  Defendant GregoryA. McKay is the Director of the Arizona Department of \n14 Child Safety (โDCSโ). The Director has statutory duty under Ariz. Rev. Stat. (โA.R.S.โ) \n15 ยง 8-451 et seq. to โprotect children.โ The Director is also required to โ[e]nsure the \n16 departmentโs compliance with the Indian child welfare act of 1978 (P.L. 95-608; 92 Stat. \n17 3069; 25 United States Code ยงยง 1901 through 1963).โ A.R.S. ยง 8-453(A)(20). He is sued \n18 in his official capacity only.\n19 FACTS COMMON TO ALL CLAIMS\n20 I.  Baby Girl A.D.\n21 21.  DCS tookbabygirl A.D. into protective custodyat birth as she was severely \n22 drug-exposed due to her biological motherโs ingestion of several controlled substances, \n23 and placed her with S.H. and J.H. They have taken care of baby girl A.D. ever since, and \n24 although she has some developmental delays due to her exposure to controlled substances, \n25 she has shown remarkable recoveryfrom the deleterious effects of second-hand addiction \n26 under the loving care of S.H. and J.H.\n27 22.  A.D.โs biological mother named two possible birth fathers for babygirl A.D. \n28 Paternity tests on both ruled out the possibility that they were A.D.โs birth fathers. \n6of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 7 of 108\n1 Consequently, the state court severed parental rights of the birth mother and the absent \n2 birth father.\n3 23.  S.H. and J.H., as foster parents, have taken care of babygirl A.D. since birth. \n4 S.H. and J.H., along with their adopted son who has Indian ancestry, are the only family \n5 that baby girl A.D. has ever known. The tribe sought in state court a transfer of the case \n6 to tribal court. The state juvenile court denied the tribeโs motion to transfer jurisdiction to \n7 tribal court and the tribe appealed. That appeal is now pending in the Arizona Court of \n8 Appeals Case No. JV16-0038. If the appellate court reverses the state trial courtโs decision \n9 and their case is transferred to tribal court, it would force A.D., S.H. and J.H., who do not \n10 have any contact with the tribal forum, to submit to that forumโs jurisdiction over them. \n11 Such transfer and the resulting exercise of jurisdiction, if successful, would be solelybased \n12 on baby girl A.D.โs race.\n13 24.  But for ICWA, A.D. would likely have been cleared for adoption by S.H. \n14 and  J.H.  If  they are  awarded  adoption,  they are  willing  to  provide  and  encourage \n15 appropriate visitation and cultural acclimatization opportunities to A.D. DCS has and \n16 continues  to  follow,  implement,  and  support  the  position  that  ICWA  and  the  BIA \n17 Guidelines control all aspects of the state court child custody proceeding of A.D., S.H., \n18 and J.H., including but not limited to the provisions challenged here. In A.D.โs child \n19 custody proceeding, all actions were taken and decisions reached because of A.D., S.H., \n20 and J.H.โs race.\n21 II.  Baby Boy C.C.\n22 25. DCS took baby boyC.C. into protective custodywhen he was less than one \n23 year old when his biological mother was convicted of a non-drug related felony. His birth \n24 father is unknown. The birth mother is on record saying she supports baby boy C.C.โs \n25 adoption by M.C. and K.C.\n26 26. The  Navajo  Nation  repeatedly proposed  alternative  ICWA-compliant \n27 placements, all of which turned out to be inappropriate for placement of baby boy C.C.\n28 Baby boy C.C.โs extended family members expressly declined to have him placed with \n7of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 8 of 108\n1 them. Other ICWA-compliant placements the tribe proposed also declined to have baby \n2 boy C.C. placed with them. The tribe repeatedly asked for additional opportunities from \n3 state court to find other ICWA-compliant placements. Consequently, baby boy C.C.\n4 continuously remained in foster care with M.C. and K.C. for four years. M.C. and K.C. \n5 were not able to file a petition for adoption until the state court declared that baby boy \n6 C.C. is available for adoption and that there was good cause to deviate from ICWAโs \n7 adoption placement preferences.\n8 27.  Each time the tribe proposed an ICWA-compliant placement, pursuant to a \n9 court-supervised and DCS-supported case plan, M.C. and K.C. had to drive each week \n10 with baby boy C.C., sometimes over 100 miles, to visit with the proposed placement to \n11 give baby boy C.C. an opportunity to bond with the proposed placement until that \n12 placement became unavailable for any reason. Baby boy C.C. calls M.C. and K.C. \n13 โmommyโ and โdaddy,โ but he was reminded by some proposed placements that M.C. \n14 and K.C. are not his โmommyโ and โdaddy.โ This caused significant emotional and \n15 psychological harm to baby boy C.C. who, through no fault of his own, had to leave the\n16 security of his home and visit with strangers solely because he was born with Indian \n17 ancestry.\n18 28.  Due to the application of ICWA, baby boy C.C. had languished in foster \n19 care for approximately four years. But for ICWA, baby boy C.C. would have likely been \n20 cleared for adoption by M.C. and K.C. \n21 29. M.C. and K.C. were not granted intervention in the dependency matter of \n22 C.C. \n23 30. In November 2015, after this lawsuit was filed, the state court properly \n24 having jurisdiction over the matter cleared C.C., with DCS and Navajo Nation consent, \n25 for adoption byM.C. and K.C. \n26 31. The Indian Child Welfare Act applied to all aspects of C.C.โs child custody \n27 proceeding. All actions that delayed or denied C.C.โs adoption by M.C. and K.C. were \n28\n8of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 9 of 108\n1 taken because of C.C., M.C., and K.C.โs race. DCS continued to follow, enforce and \n2 support the application of ICWA in C.C.โs child custody proceeding.\n3 III. Baby Girl L.G. and Baby Boy C.R.\n4 32.  L.G. and C.R. are siblings who have the same birth mother but different \n5 birth fathers. L.G. was born in August, 2012, C.R. in August, 2014. During C.R.โs \n6 pregnancy, the birth mother tested positive for several controlled substances. Baby boy \n7 C.R. was born nine weeks premature, was drug-exposed when born, and spent three weeks \n8 in a ventilator. He is determined to be medically fragile. In or about August 2014, DCS \n9 took baby girl L.G. and baby boy C.R. into protective custody and placed the siblings in \n10 the care of P.R. and K.R. Thus, DCS took L.G. into protective custodywhen she was about \n11 2 years old; DCS took C.R. into protective custody at birth. P.R. and K.R. is the only \n12 familythat babyboyC.R. has ever known; L.G., on information and belief, lived with her \n13 birth mother before she was placed in the care of P.R. and K.R. If they are awarded \n14 adoption, P.R. and K.R. are willing to provide and encourage appropriate visitation and \n15 cultural acclimatization opportunities to L.G. and C.R.\n16 33. Both L.G. and C.R.โs birth fathers are known. On information and belief, \n17 both are in federal prison on conviction for violent felonies. L.G. and C.R.โs birth mother \n18 and maternal grandmother were arrested on charges of shoplifting. On information and \n19 belief, the maternal grandmother was given a two-year prison sentence and the birth \n20 mother is currently on probation. \n21 34. L.G. and C.R.โs birth mother, on information and belief, is a member of the \n22 Gila River Indian Communitywith 25% Indian blood.\n23 35. After L.G. and C.R. were placed in the foster care of P.R. and K.R., L.G.โs \n24 birth father, on information and belief, tried to obtain membership in the Pascua Yaqui \n25 Tribe, a federally-recognized tribe, but was unable to obtain membership. Consequently, \n26 L.G. is not eligible for membership in, nor is she a child of a member of, the Pascua Yaqui \n27 Tribe. L.G. is also not eligible for membership in, nor is she a member of, the Gila River \n28 Indian Community.\n9of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 10 of 108\n1 36. C.R.โs birth mother and birth father are members of the Gila River Indian \n2 Community. C.R. is eligible for membership in, and is a child of a member of, the Gila \n3 River Indian Community. \n4 37. Initially, the case management plan for L.G. and C.R. was reunification with \n5 their birth mother. Due to C.R.โs low birth weight and medical complications due to in-\n6 utero exposure to controlled substances, DCS consented to, and the state court authorized, \n7 one weekly 4-hour-long visit with the birth mother that is supervised by DCS employees. \n8 In September 2015, the state court properly having jurisdiction over the child custody \n9 proceeding, changed the case management plan to severance. The parental rights of L.G. \n10 and C.R.โs birth parents have not been terminated. \n11 38. Foster parents P.R. and K.R. are not party intervenors in the state child \n12 custody proceeding of L.G. and C.R. Plaintiffs L.G., C.R., K.R. and P.R. do not have any \n13 contacts or ties with any tribal forum.\n14 39. The  Gila  River  Indian  Community has  and  will  continue  to  propose \n15 alternative ICWA-compliant homes for C.R. in the consolidated child custodyproceeding \n16 of L.G. and C.R. for the sole purpose of ensuring that C.R.โs child custody proceeding is \n17 subject to ICWA and the BIA Guidelines. DCS has and continues to follow, implement, \n18 and support the position that ICWA and the BIA Guidelines control all aspects of the state \n19 court child custody proceeding  of  C.R.,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  provisions \n20 challenged here.\n21 40. L.G. has Indian ancestry but is not an โIndian childโ within the meaning of \n22 ICWA.  However,  she  is  discriminated  against  in  her  consolidated  child  custody \n23 proceeding because her half-sibling, C.R., is an โIndian childโ within the meaning of \n24 ICWA. L.G. has known C.R. since birth, both share a strong sibling bond, and both\n25 consider K.R. and P.R. as de factoand psychological parents.Both call K.R. and P.R. their \n26 โmommyโ and โdaddy.โ\n27 41. Arizona state policy, mandated bystate law, is to place well-bonded siblings \n28 with the same foster and adoptive parents. See, e.g., A.R.S. ยง 8-513(D). But for ICWA \n10of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 11 of 108\n1 and the federal and state statutes and Guidelines that implement it, L.G. and C.R. would \n2 be placed together due to their bonding and attachment, pursuant to state law.\n3 42.  The relevant state court properlyhaving jurisdiction over the matter has not \n4 declared L.G. and C.R. as available for adoption. L.G. and C.R. have continuously \n5 remained in foster care with P.R. and K.R. for about one year and six months. P.R. and \n6 K.R. cannot file a petition for adoption until the state court declares that L.G. and C.R. are \n7 available for adoption and that there is good cause to deviate from ICWAโs adoption \n8 placement preferences.\n9 43.  Due to the application of ICWA, L.G. and C.R. have been languishing in \n10 foster care for more than one and a half years. But for ICWA, theywould likelyhave been \n11 cleared for adoption by P.R. and K.R.\n12 IV.  All Plaintiffs\n13 44.  But for ICWA, a strong likelihood exists that these families โbabygirl A.D., \n14 and her foster/preadoptive parents, S.H. and J.H., babyboyC.C., and his adoptive parents \n15 M.C. and K.C., and L.G. and C.R., and their foster parents, K.R. and P.R. โ would be \n16 allowed to become permanent under race-neutral Arizona laws permitting individualized \n17 race-neutral evaluation bystate court of what is in the childrenโs best interests. But under \n18 ICWA,  these  families  are  subjected  to  different  and  more  onerous  procedural  and \n19 substantive provisions that are based solely on the race of the children and the adults \n20 involved, which lead to severe disruption in their lives contrary to the childrenโs best \n21 interests.\n22 45.  In many instances, children subject to ICWA are removed from caring, \n23 loving homes and forced into placements, which sometimes leads to abuse, psychological \n24 harm, or even physical trauma and death.\n25 46.  In many instances, prospective adoptive parents who otherwise would be \n26 allowed to adopt children they have raised since infancy and grown to love are deprived \n27 of the opportunity to form permanent families as a result of ICWA.\n28\n11of 35\n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 12 of 108\n1    47.   In many instances, children are left in abusive or neglectful Indian families \n \n2  where they are subjected to grave physical or psychological harm as a result of ICWA. \n \n3    48.   Subjecting  these  children  and  families  to  ICWA  creates  delay  and \n \n4  uncertainty in the journey to permanent family status, and the prospect and reality of \n \n5  displacement from stable, loving families causes great harm to children and great distress \n \n6  to prospective adoptive parents. \n \n7    49.  All named children and parent plaintiffs, and the members of the class they \n \n8  seek to represent, have in the past been, are currently, or in the course of their constantly \n \n9  evolving state court child custody proceedings will surely be, subject to the separate, \n \n10  unequal and substandard treatment under provisions of ICWA and the BIA Guidelines \n \n11  challenged here: 25 U.S.C. ยงยง 1911(b), 1912(d), 1912(e), 1912(f), 1915(b), 1915(a); BIA \n \n12  Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146 (February 25, 2015), ยงยง A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2, B.4, B.8, C.1, \n \n13  C.2, C.3, D.2, D.3, F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4. Once a determination is made that a child is an \n \n14  โIndian childโ within the meaning of ICWA, all of the provisions of ICWA and the BIA \n \n15  Guidelines challenged here inexorably become applicable to that childโs child custody \n \n16  proceeding  beginning  with  DCS  taking  the  child  into  protective  custody  up  to  and \n \n17  including either the finalization of the childโs adoption or the childโs reunification with \n \n18  birth family. DCS has and continues to follow, implement, and support the position that \n \n19  ICWA  and  the  BIA  Guidelines  control  all  aspects  of  the  state  court  child  custody \n \n20  proceeding of Indian children, including but not limited to the provisions challenged here. \n \n21  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n \n22    50.   The named plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a class \n \n23  of  all  off-reservation  Arizona-resident  children  with  Indian  ancestry  and  all  off-\n \n24  reservation non-Indian Arizona-resident foster, preadoptive, and prospective adoptive \n \n25  parents who are or will be in child custody proceedings involving a child with Indian \n \n26  ancestry and who are not members of the childโs extended family. \n \n27    51.   The  Arizona  Department  of  Child  Safetyโs  semi-annual  Report  to  the \n \n28  Governor for the period of April 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, attached as Exhibit \n \n12 of 35 \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 13 of 108\n1  1  to  this  Amended  Complaint,  and  available  at \n \n2  https://dcs.az.gov/sites/default/files/SEMIANNUAL-CHILD-WELFARE-\n \n3  REPORTING-REQUIREMENTS-4-15-9-15_FINAL-Revised.pdf (last visited March 2, \n \n4  2016), reports that as of September 30, 2015 there were 1,506 American Indian children \n \n5  in  out-of-home  care  in  Arizona.  Id.  at  42.  The  number  of  foster,  preadoptive,  and \n \n6  prospective adoptive parents of these children is similarly numerous. Their identities are \n \n7  easily ascertainable through DCS records that are not open for inspection to the public. \n \n8  This putative class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. See FRCP \n \n9  23(a)(1). \n \n10    52.   There are questions of law or fact common to the class, namely, the facial \n \n11  and  as-applied  constitutionality  of  several  provisions  of  ICWA  and  accompanying \n \n12  Guidelines to the members of the class. See FRCP 23(a)(2). \n \n13    53.   The circumstances of baby girl A.D., S.H. and J.H., baby boy C.C., M.C. \n \n14  and K.C. and baby girl L.G., baby boy C.R., P.R. and K.R., are typical of children with \n \n15  Indian ancestry and other foster, preadoptive and prospective adoptive families of children \n \n16  with Indian ancestry. See FRCP 23(a)(3). \n \n17    54.   The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n \n18  class. See FRCP 23(a)(4). \n \n19    55.   Plaintiffsโ attorneys are experienced in representing litigants before federal \n \n20  courts. Plaintiffsโ counsel include nationally recognized constitutional lawyers who have \n \n21  litigated extensively at every level of the federal judiciary. Plaintiffsโ attorneys are well \n \n22  qualified to be appointed class counsel by this Court. \n \n23    56.   Separate  actions by individual class members would create the risk of \n \n24  inconsistent or incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants, and separate actions \n \n25  by individual class members would substantially impair their ability to protect their \n \n26  interests. See FRCP 23(b)(1). \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n13 of 35 \n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 14 of 108\n1 57.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \n2 the putative class. Thus, final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \n3 appropriate respecting the class as a whole. See FRCP 23(b)(2).\n4 58.  Questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate \n5 over questions affecting individual class members as individual class members are denied \n6 equal protection under the law and deprived of their constitutional rights. A class action\n7 is  superior  to  other  available  methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient  adjudication  of  the \n8 controversy, inasmuch as the individual class members are deprived of the same rights. \n9 See FRCP 23(b)(3).\n10 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n11 I.  Definitions\n12 59.  ICWA defines โIndian childโ as โany unmarried person who is under age \n13 eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in \n14 an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribeโ 25 U.S.C. ยง \n15 1903(4). โIndian tribeโ is also statutorily defined at 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(8).\n16 60.  Most Indian tribes have only blood quantum or lineage requirements as \n17 prerequisites for membership. See Miss. Band of Choctaw Indians Const. art. III, ยง 1; \n18 Cherokee Nation Const. art. IV, ยง 1; Choctaw Nation of Okla. Const. art. II, ยง 1; Muscogee \n19 (Creek) Nation Const. art. III, ยง 2; Gila River Indian Community Const. art.

Reg.  10146, 10153,  B.3  (February 25,  2015)  (โNew \n22 Guidelinesโ or โBIA Guidelinesโ). Consequently, ICWAโs definition of โIndian childโ is \n23 based solely on the childโs race or ancestry.\n24 61.  Some of the tribes consider individuals with onlya tinypercentage of Indian \n25 blood to be Indian, even if they have little or no contact or connection with the tribe. See, \n26 e.g., Cherokee Nation Const. art. IV, ยง 1.\n27 62.  Thus, in many instances, children with only a minute quantum of Indian \n28 blood and no connection or ties to the tribe are subject to ICWA and relegated to the tribeโs \n14of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 15 of 108\n1 exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction.

The Guidelines for State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child Custody \n7 Proceedings, 80 Fed.

ICWA  defines  โchild  custody proceedingโ  to  include  โfoster  care \n15 placement,โ โtermination of parental rights,โ โpreadoptive placement,โ and โadoptive \n16 placement.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1).\n17 66.  โFoster care placementโ is defined as โanyaction removing an Indian child \n18 from its parent or Indian custodian for temporaryplacement in a foster home or institution \n19 or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian custodian cannot have \n20 the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights have not been terminated.โ 25 \n21 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1)(i).\n22 67.  โTermination of parental rightsโ is defined as โany action resulting in the \n23 termination of the parent-child relationship.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1)(ii).\n24 68.  โPreadoptive placementโ is defined as โthe temporary placement of an \n25 Indian child in a foster home or institution after the termination of parental rights, but prior \n26 to or in lieu of adoptive placement.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1)(iii).\n27\n28\n15of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 16 of 108\n1 69.  โAdoptive placementโ is defined as โthe permanent placement of an Indian \n2 child for adoption, including anyaction resulting in a final decree of adoption.โ 25 U.S.C. \n3 ยง 1903(1)(iv).\n4 70.  โChild custody proceeding,โ as defined, โshall not include a placement \n5 based upon an act which, if committed by an adult, would be deemed a crime or upon an \n6 award, in a divorce proceeding, of custody to one of the parents.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1).\n7 II.  BIA Guidelines\n8 71.  The BIA first issued Guidelines in November of 1979. Guidelines for State \n9 Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, 44 Fed. Reg. 67584 (November 26, 1979) \n10 (โOld Guidelinesโ or โ1979 Guidelinesโ). On February 25, 2015, the BIA issued new \n11 Guidelines to โsupersede and replaceโ the 1979 Guidelines. Guidelines for State Courts \n12 and Agencies in Indian Child CustodyProceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10147 (February \n13 25, 2015) (โNew Guidelinesโ, โ2015 Guidelinesโ, or โBIA Guidelinesโ).\n14 III.  The Jurisdiction-Transfer Provision\n15 72.  ICWA  requires  state  courts  to  โtransferโ  โfoster  care  placementโ  or \n16 โtermination of parental rightsโ โproceeding[s] to the jurisdiction of the tribeโ of โan \n17 Indian child not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian childโs tribeโ \n18 โin the absence of good cause to the contrary,โ and โabsent objection byeither parent,โ if \n19 the โparent or the Indian custodian or the Indian childโs tribeโ petitions for such transfer \n20 and the tribal court does not decline such transfer. 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b) (โjurisdiction-\n21 transfer provisionโ); 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, C.2. The New Guidelines, however, state, \n22 โThe right to request a transfer is available at any stage of an Indian child custody \n23 proceeding, including during any period of emergency removal.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, \n24 C.1(c) (emphasis added).\n25 73.  Whereas ICWAโs jurisdiction-transfer provision is available to transfer only \n26 foster care placement and termination of parental rights proceedings to the jurisdiction of \n27 the tribe, the BIA, in the New Guidelines, extended the jurisdiction-transfer provision to \n28 all child custodyproceedings.\n16of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 17 of 108\n1 74.  โGood causeโ to not transfer a foster care placement or termination of \n2 parental rights proceeding to tribal court is not defined in ICWA. The New Guidelines, \n3 however, state:\n4 In determining whether good cause exists, the court may not \nconsider whether the case is at an advanced stage or whether \n5 transfer would result in a change in the placement of the child \nbecause the Act created concurrent, but presumptively, tribal \n6 jurisdiction over proceedings involving children not residing \nor domiciled on the reservation, and seeks to protect, not only \n7 the rights of the Indian child as an Indian, but the rights of \nIndian communities and tribes in retaining Indian children. \n8 Thus, whenever a parent or tribe seeks to transfer the case it is \npresumptively in  the  best  interest  of  the  Indian  child, \n9 consistent with the Act, to transfer the case to the jurisdiction \nof the Indian tribe. [ยถ] In addition, in determining whether \n10 there is good cause to deny the transfer, the court may not \nconsider: (1) The Indian childโs contacts with the tribe or \n11 reservation; (2) Socio-economic conditions or any perceived \ninadequacy  of tribal  or  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  social \n12 services  or  judicial  systems;  or  (3)  the  tribal  courtโs \nprospective placement for the Indian child.\n13\n14 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, C.3(c)โ(d).\n15 75.  Under uniform Arizona law, when deciding whether to transfer a foster care \n16 placement or termination of parental rights proceeding to some other jurisdiction, an \n17 Arizona  state  court  โthat  has  made  a  child  custody determinationโ  has  โexclusive, \n18 continuing jurisdiction over the determination untilโ either one of the two options is true:\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n17of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 18 of 108\n1. A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor \n1 the child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as \na parent have a significant connection with this state and that \n2 substantial  evidence  is  no  longer  available  in  this  state \nconcerning the childโs care, protection, training and personal \n3 relationships.\n2. A court of this state or a court of another state determines \n4 that the child, the childโs parents and any person acting as a \nparent do not presently reside in this state.\n5\n6 A.R.S. ยง 25-1032(A).\n7 76.  Thus, while Arizona law looks at the litigantsโ contacts with the forum in \n8 deciding whether to transfer a foster care placement or termination of parental rights \n9 proceeding to some other jurisdiction, ICWA and the New Guidelines explicitly instruct \n10 courts to not take into account the litigantsโ contacts with the tribal forum.\n11 77. The  clear  and  convincing  evidence  standard  is  applied  in  Arizona  to \n12 determine whether good cause exists to deviate from ICWAโs foster care placement \n13 preferences of 25 U.S.C. ยง 1915(b). Gila River Indian Community v. Department of Child \n14 Safety, 363 P.3d 148 (2015). The state trial court in baby girl A.D.โs case, however, \n15 concluded that the same clear and convincing evidence standard must be met in order to \n16 establish good cause to deviate from ICWAโs jurisdiction-transfer provision, 25 U.S.C. ยง \n17 1911(b). Contra Decker Coal Co. v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 805 F.2d 834, 839 (9th \n18 Cir.  1986)  (proponent  must  establish  personal  jurisdiction  or  lack  thereof  by \n19 preponderance of the evidence).\n20 IV.  The Active Efforts Provision\n21 78.  Further,  ICWA  states  that  โ[a]ny party seeking  to  effect  a  foster  care \n22 placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall \n23 satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and \n24 rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian familyand that these \n25 efforts have proved unsuccessful.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(d) (emphasis added) (โactive efforts \n26 provisionโ).\n27 79.  The New Guidelines state: โActive effortsare intended primarilyto maintain \n28 and reunite an Indian child with his or her familyor tribal community and constitute more \n18of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 19 of 108\n1 than reasonable efforts as required by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n2 671(a)(15)).โฆโActive effortsโ are separate and distinct from requirements of the Adoption \n3 and Safe Families Act (ASFA), 42 U.S.C. 1305. ASFAโs exceptions to reunification \n4 efforts do not apply to ICWA proceedings.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10150โ51, A.2 (emphasis in \n5 original). The  ASFA  exceptions provide  that  the  reasonable  efforts  provision  is \n6 inapplicable if there are โaggravated circumstancesโ such as โabandonment, torture, \n7 chronic  abuse,  and  sexual  abuse.โ  42  U.S.C.  ยง  671(a)(15)(D).  But  because  these \n8 exceptions do not applyunder the โactive effortsโ provision, active efforts are required to \n9 be taken to reunify children deemed Indian with their family or members of the tribal \n10 community even when the children were abandoned, tortured, chronically abused or \n11 sexuallyabused by those individuals.\n12 80.  DCS, under the active efforts provision, is required to โ[i]dentify[], notify[], \n13 and invit[e] representatives of the Indian childโs tribe to participateโ in the active efforts\n14 to  reunite  the  Indian  child  with  the  childโs  โfamilyโ  and  โtribal  community.โ  New \n15 Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at 10150, A.2.\n16 81.  DCS, under the active efforts provision, is required to โ[t]ak[e] into account \n17 the Indian childโs tribeโs prevailing social and cultural conditions and wayof lifeโ even in \n18 situations where the child or the childโs parents have never been exposed to or followed \n19 the tribeโs prevailing social and cultural conditions orway of life. Id.DCS is also required \n20 โto assure cultural connections,โ โ[s]upport[] regular visits and trial home visits of the \n21 Indian child during any period of removal,โ and โ[o]ffer[] and employ[] all available and \n22 culturallyappropriate familypreservation strategies.โ Id.\n23 82.  The New Guidelines provide details on when the requirement for active \n24 efforts begins and what actions an agency and State court must take in order to determine \n25 whether a child is an Indian child and how to comply with the active efforts requirement. \n26 80 Fed. Reg. at 10152โ153, A.3, B.1โB.2, B.4, B.8, D.2. The New Guidelines provide no \n27 details on when the requirement for active efforts ends; consequently, the active efforts \n28 provision remains applicable until the adoption is finalized. Additionally,  the  foster \n19of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 20 of 108\n1 placement preferences and adoption placement preferences require DCS to engage in \n2 active efforts everytime the tribe proposes a new ICWA-compliant placement.\n3 83.  The New Guidelines require DCS to โtreat the child as an Indian child, \n4 unless and until it is determined that the child is not a member or is not eligible for \n5 membership in an Indian tribe,โ โ[i]f there is any reason to believe the child is an Indian \n6 child.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10152, A.3(d).\n7 84.  The New Guidelines require DCS to engage in active efforts โfrom the \n8 moment the possibility arises that โฆ the Indian child [will] be placed outside the custody \n9 of either parent or Indian custodianโ and also โwhile investigatingโ whether ICWA applies \n10 to a particular child. 80 Fed. Reg. at 10152, B.1(a)โ(b).\n11 85.  If a child is suspected to be an Indian child, DCS maybe required to provide \n12 โ[g]enograms or ancestry charts for both parents, โฆ maternal and paternal grandparents \n13 and great grandparents or Indian custodians; birthdates; โฆ tribal affiliation including all \n14 known Indian ancestry for individuals listed on the charts[.]โ New Guidelines, 80 Fed. \n15 Reg. at 10152, B.2(b)(1)(i).\n16 86.  โIn the event the child is eligible for membership in a tribe but is not yet a \n17 member of any tribe,โ the New Guidelines require DCS to โtake the steps necessary to \n18 obtain membership for the child in the tribe that is designated as the Indian childโs tribe.โ \n19 80 Fed. Reg. at 10153, B.4(d)(iii).\n20 87.  In emergency removal situations where DCS โknows orhas reason to knowโ \n21 that a child is an Indian child, DCS is required to โ[t]reat the child as an Indian child until \n22 the court determines that the child is not an Indian child.โ New Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. \n23 at 10155, B.8(c)(1).\n24 88.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 671(a)(15), as amended by ASFA, the โreasonable \n25 effortsโ standard is pervasive under Arizona Law. See, e.g., A.R.S. ยงยง 8-513 (foster care \n26 placement), 8-522 (dependency actions), 8-825 (preliminary protective hearing), 8-829 \n27 (same), 8-843 (initial dependency hearing), 8-845 (dependency determination), 8-846 \n28 (same), 8-862 (permanencyhearing).\n20of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 21 of 108\n1 89.  Whereas โactive effortsโ are required not only to โmaintain and reunite an \n2 Indian child with his or her familyโ but also with the childโs โtribal community,โ New \n3 Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at 10150, A.2, โreasonable effortsโ under Arizona law are \n4 required only to maintain and reunite the child with the childโs family. See, e.g., A.R.S. ยง \n5 8-522(E)(3).\n6 90.  Arizona DCS applies the active efforts provision to children with Indian \n7 ancestry, and the โreasonable effortsโ provision to all other children. The New Guidelines \n8 explicitly state that the active efforts provision is โmore thanโ the reasonable efforts \n9 provision. Consequently, children with Indian ancestry are singled out and afforded \n10 separate, unequal treatment resulting in delayed resolution of child custody proceedings \n11 of children with Indian ancestry, based solely on their race.\n12 V.  Burden of Proof in Foster Care Placement Orders\n13 91.  ICWA further requires that โNo foster care placement maybe ordered in [an \n14 involuntary] proceeding  in  the  absence  of  a  determination,  supported  by clear  and \n15 convincing evidence, including testimonyof qualified expert witnesses, that the continued \n16 custody of the child bythe parent or Indian custodian is likelyto result in serious emotional \n17 or physical damage to the child.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(e).\n18 92.  The New Guidelines state: โThe court may not issue an order effecting a \n19 foster care placement of an Indian child unless clear and convincing evidence is presented, \n20 including the testimony of one or more qualified expert witnesses, demonstrating that the \n21 childโs continued custodywith the childโs parents or Indian custodian is likelyto result in \n22 serious harm to the child.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, D.3(a).\n23 93. The  clear  and  convincing  evidence  standard  is  applied  in  Arizona  to \n24 determine whether good cause exists to deviate from ICWAโs foster care placement \n25 preferences. Gila River Indian Community v. Department of Child Safety, 363 P.3d 148 \n26 (2015).\n27 94.  Under Arizona law, to take a child into temporary custody, there must be a \n28 showing that โreasonable grounds exist to believe that temporary custody is clearly \n21of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 22 of 108\n1 necessary to protect the child from suffering abuse or neglectโ and that โprobable cause \n2 exists to believeโ that, inter alia, the child is or will imminentlybecome a victim of abuse \n3 or neglect, or is suffering from serious physical or emotional injury. A.R.S. ยง 8-821(A)โ\n4 (B); ยง 8-824(F) (โThe petitioner has the burden of presenting evidence as to whether there \n5 is probable cause to believe that continued temporary custody is clearly necessary to \n6 prevent abuse or neglect pending the hearing on the dependency petitionโ); A.R.S. ยง 8-\n7 843  (โreasonable  effortsโ  standard  in  initial  dependency hearings);  A.R.S.  ยง  8-844 \n8 (โpreponderance of the evidenceโ standard in dependency adjudication hearings).\n9 95.  Thus, ICWA requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence whereas \n10 Arizona law requires a showing of โreasonable grounds,โ โprobable cause,โ โreasonable \n11 efforts,โ or โpreponderance of the evidenceโ at various stages of proceedings leading to \n12 foster care placement of children. Consequently, ICWAโs higher burden of proof requires \n13 DCS to disregard to a greater extent the safety and security of children with Indian \n14 ancestry based solely on the race of these children.\n15 VI.  Burden of Proof in Termination of Parental Rights Orders\n16 96.  ICWA requires that โNo termination of parental rights may be ordered in \n17 [an involuntary] proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence \n18 beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the \n19 continued custodyof the child bythe parent or Indian custodian is likelyto result in serious \n20 emotional or physical damage to the child.โ 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(f).\n21 97.  The New Guidelines state: โThe court may not order a termination of \n22 parental rights unless the courtโs order is supported by evidence beyond a reasonable \n23 doubt,  supported  by the  testimony of  one  or  more  qualified  expert  witnesses,  that \n24 continued custodyof the child bythe parent or Indian custodian is likelyto result in serious \n25 harm to the child.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, D.3(b).\n26 98.  Under  Arizona  law,  โArizonaโs  statutes  require  that  the  party  seeking \n27 termination of parental rights establish onlythe statutorygrounds of section 8-533 byclear \n28 and convincing evidence and establish the best interests of the child by a preponderance \n22of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 23 of 108\n1 of the evidence.โ Kent K. v. Bobby M., 110 P.3d 1013, 1018 (Ariz. 2005) (interpreting \n2 A.R.S. ยงยง 8-533, 8-537).\n3 99.  Thus, ICWA requires a showing of beyond a reasonable doubt whereas \n4 Arizona law requires use of the clear and convincing evidence standard in termination of \n5 parental  rights  proceedings.  Consequently, ICWAโs  higher  burden  of  proof,  which \n6 explicitly does not take into account the best interests of the child, places greater burdens \n7 on children with Indian ancestry than does Arizona law uniformly applied to all other \n8 children. This separate, unequal treatment of children with Indian ancestryis based solely \n9 on the childโs race.\n10 VII.  Foster/Preadoptive Care Placement Preferences\n11 100.  Under ICWA:\n12 In anyfoster care or preadoptive placement, a preference shall \nbe given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a \n13 placement withโ\n(i) a member of the Indian childโs extended family;\n14 (ii) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the \nIndian childโs tribe;\n15 (iii)  an  Indian  foster  home  licensed  or  approved  by an \nauthorized non-Indian licensing authority; or\n16 (iv) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or \noperated  by an  Indian  organization  which  has  a  program \n17 suitable to meet the Indian childโs needs.\n18 25 U.S.C. ยง 1915(b) (emphasis added).\n19 101.  The New Guidelines state:\n20 The agency seeking a preadoptive, adoptive or foster care \nplacement  of  an  Indian  child  must  always  follow the \n21 placement preferences. If the agency determines that any of \nthe preferences cannot be met, the agency must demonstrate \n22 through clear and convincing evidence that a diligent search \nhas been conducted to seek out and identifyplacement options \n23 that  would  satisfy  the  placement  preferences  specified  in \nsections F.2 or F.3 of these guidelines, and explain why the \n24 preferences could not be met.\n25 80 Fed. Reg. at 10157, F.1(b) (emphasis added).\n26 102.  Although โgood causeโ to not apply the foster care placement preferences \n27 is not defined in ICWA, the New Guidelines state:\n28\n23of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 24 of 108\n(a) If any party asserts that good cause not to follow the \n1 placement preferences exists, the reasons for such belief or \nassertion must be stated on the record or in writing and made \n2 available to the parties to the proceeding and the Indian childโs \ntribe.\n3 (b) The partyseeking departure from the preferences bears the \nburden  of  proving  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  the \n4 existence  of  โgood  causeโ  to  deviate  from  the  placement \npreferences.\n5 (c)  A  determination  of  good  cause  to  depart  from  the \nplacement preferences must be based on one or more of the \n6 following considerations:\n(1) The request of the parents, if both parents attest that \n7 they have reviewed the placement options that comply with \nthe order of preference.\n8 (2) The request of the child, if the child is able to \nunderstand and comprehend the decision that is being made.\n9 (3) The extraordinary physical or emotional needs of \nthe child, such as specialized treatment services that may be \n10 unavailable in the community where families who meet the \ncriteria live, as established by testimony of a qualified expert \n11 witness; provided that extraordinary physical or emotional \nneeds  of  the  child  does  not  include  ordinary bonding  or \n12 attachment that may have occurred as a result of a placement \nor the fact that the child has, for an extended amount of time, \n13 been in another placement that does not comply with the Act. \nThe  good  cause  determination  does  not  include  an \n14 independent consideration of the best interest of the Indian \nchild because the preferences reflect the best interests of an \n15 Indian child in light of the purposes of the Act.\n(4) The unavailability of a placement after a showing \n16 by the applicable agency in accordance with section F.1, and \na determination bythe court that active efforts have been made \n17 to find placements meeting the preference criteria, but none \nhave been located. For purposes of this analysis, a placement \n18 may not be considered unavailable if the placement conforms \nto the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian \n19 community in which the Indian childโs parent or extended \nfamily resides or with which the Indian childโs parent or \n20 extended family members maintain social and cultural ties.\n(d) The court should consider only whether a placement in \n21 accordance with the preferences meets the physical, mental \nand emotional needs of the child; and maynot depart from the \n22 preferences  based  on  the  socio-economic  status  of  any \nplacement relative to another placement.\n23\n80 Fed. Reg. at 10158, F.4 (emphasis added).\n24\n103.  The standard applied to all other children in Arizona is markedly different \n25\nfrom the standard applied to children with Indian ancestry. For foster care placements, \n26\nArizona courts look at whether there was reasonable evidence to find that placing a child \n27\nwith the foster family instead of an extended family member was in the childโs โbest \n28\n24of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 25 of 108\n1 interests.โ Antonio M. v. Ariz. Dept. of Econ. Sec., 214 P.3d 1010, 1012 (Ariz. App. 2009). \n2 Courts in such situations also give weight to the fact that โthe foster parents wished to \n3 adopt [the child].โ Id. See also Antonio P. v. Ariz. Dept. of Econ. Sec., 187 P.3d 1115,\n4 1117 (Ariz.

Adoption Placement Preferences\n8 104.  Under ICWA,\n9 In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, \na preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to \n10 the contrary, to a placement with\n(1) a member of the childโs extended family;\n11 (2) other members of the Indian childโs tribe; or\n(3) other Indian families.\n12\n13 25 U.S.C. ยง 1915(a).(emphasis added).\n14 105.  The  New  Guidelines  require  state  courts  to  follow  ICWAโs  adoption \n15 placement preferences. 80 Fed. Reg. at 10157, F.1(b) (โThe agency seeking a[n] โฆ \n16 adoptive โฆ placement of an Indian child must always follow the placement preferencesโ) \n17 (emphasis added).\n18 106.  Although โgood causeโ to not apply the adoption placement preferences is \n19 not defined in ICWA, the New Guidelines, as reproduced above, specificallystate that the \n20 โgood cause determination does not include an independent consideration of the best \n21 interest of the Indian child because the preferences reflect the best interests of an Indian \n22 child in light of the purposes of the Act.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10158, F.4.\n23 107.  Due to the mandatory language of the New Guidelines, there is an inherent \n24 conflict between the dutyof DCS, an โagencyโ within the meaning of the New Guidelines, \n25 to โprotect childrenโ and its application of ICWA to children with Indian ancestry.\n26 108.  The placement preferences, as applied under the New Guidelines, do not \n27 look to the interests-of-the-child factors that state courts have traditionally applied in \n28 entering foster care placement, preadoption and adoption orders, and thereby deprive\n25of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 26 of 108\n1 children with Indian ancestry of an individualized race-neutral determination that all other \n2 children enjoy under state law.\n3 109.  States  cannot  disregard  a  childโs  unique  background  in  making  an \n4 individualized  and  race-neutral  foster,  preadoptive  or  adoptive  assessment,  and  in \n5 terminating parental rights. But the states cannot also turn a blind eye to the childโs safety, \n6 securityand best interests based solelyon the childโs or the adultsโ race, for such action is \n7 necessarily based  on  inherently demeaning,  stereotypical  assumptions  about  an \n8 individualโs race or culture. Although the court did not reach constitutional issues, a core \n9 premise of the Baby Veronica decision, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, __ U.S. __, 133 S. \n10 Ct. 2552 (2013), was that ICWA cannot force a child to create a racially-conforming \n11 relationship and that a child should not be made to sever existing relationships in order to \n12 create new racially-conforming ones.\n13 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF\n14 COUNT 1 โ VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION GUARANTEE OF \nTHE FIFTH AMENDMENT\n15\n16 110.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt  and  incorporate  by reference  the  preceding \n17 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n18 111.  The jurisdiction-transfer provision, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b), New Guidelines at \n19 ยงยง C.1, C.2, C.3, is based solely on the race of the child and the adults involved.\n20 112.  The active efforts provision, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(d), New Guidelines at ยงยง \n21 A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2, B.4, B.8, D.2, creates a separate set of procedures for children with \n22 Indian ancestryand all other children based solely on the childโs race.\n23 113.  The clear and convincing evidence burden of proof in foster care placement \n24 orders under ICWA, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(e), New Guidelines at ยง D.3, that is applicable to \n25 children with Indian ancestry as compared to Arizonaโs demonstrably lesser burden of \n26 proof that is applicable to all other children is a legally required, unequal treatment of\n27 children with Indian ancestry. Government cannot treat the safetyand securityof children \n28 with Indian ancestry less seriously than the safetyand securityof all other children.\n26of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 27 of 108\n1 114.  The beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof in termination of parental \n2 rights proceedings under ICWA, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(f), New Guidelines at ยง D.3, that is \n3 applicable to children with Indian ancestryas compared to Arizonaโs demonstrablylesser \n4 burden of proof that is applicable to all other children is a legally required separate, \n5 unequal treatment of children with Indian ancestry. Government cannot treat the best \n6 interests of children with Indian ancestry differently and less seriously than those of all \n7 other children.\n8 115.  The foster/preadoptive and adoption placement preferences under ICWA, \n9 25 U.S.C. ยงยง 1915(b), (a), New Guidelines at ยงยง F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4, single out and treat \n10 differently children with Indian ancestry. They also single out and treat differently the \n11 non-Indian adults involved in the care and upbringing of children with Indian ancestry.\n12 116.  The jurisdiction-transfer provision, active efforts provision, burden of proof \n13 in foster care placement orders provision, burden of proof in termination of parental rights \n14 orders  provision,  foster/preadoptive  care  placement  preferences  provision,  and  the \n15 adoption placement preferences provision of ICWA, and New Guidelines, all subject \n16 Plaintiffs to unequal treatment under the law based solely on the race of the child and the \n17 adults involved and are therefore unconstitutional under the equal protection guarantee of \n18 the Fifth Amendment.\n19 117.  Because the foregoing provisions of ICWA and the New Guidelines do not \n20 serve a compelling governmental purpose in a narrowly tailored fashion, they violate the \n21 equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.\n22 COUNT 2 โ VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS GUARANTEE OF THE \nFIFTH AMENDMENT\n23\n118.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt  and  incorporate  by reference  the  preceding \n24\nparagraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n25\n119. The jurisdiction-transfer provision forces Plaintiffs to submit to the personal \n26\njurisdiction of a forum with which they have no contacts or ties.\n27\n28\n27of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 28 of 108\n1 120.  The jurisdiction-transfer provision, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b), New Guidelines at \n2 ยงยง C.1, C.2, C.3, disregards well-established Supreme Court pronouncements which \n3 require  minimum  contacts  between  the  forum  and  the  litigant  for  the  forum  to \n4 constitutionallyexercise specific or general personal jurisdiction over the litigant, and are \n5 therefore, unconstitutional under the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. See \n6 Intโl Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945); World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. \n7 Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 (1980); Helicoptores Nationales de Colombia v.

Every child and adult deserves an individualized, race-neutral determination \n10 under  uniform  standards  when  courts  make  foster/preadoptive  care  and  adoption \n11 placement decisions. Every child and adult has a right to be free from the use of race in \n12 their individualized foster/preadoptive care and adoption placement decisions.

Any determination regarding removal of a child from home, active efforts, \n26 termination of parental rights, foster care placement, or adoption placement must take into \n27 account the childโs best interests.

Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt  and  incorporate  by reference  the  preceding \n6 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n7 124.  Defendant  McKay,  pursuant  to  his  statutory duty to  โ[e]nsure  the \n8 departmentโs compliance with the Indian child welfare act,โ A.R.S. ยง 8-453(A)(20), \n9 complies with and enforces provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act in Arizona.\n10 125.  Defendant McKay complies with and enforces the active efforts provision, \n11 25 U.S.C. ยง 1912(d), New Guidelines at ยงยง A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2, B.4, B.8, D.2, in Arizona.\n12 126.

Defendant McKay complies with and enforces the beyond a reasonable \n16 doubt burden of proof in termination of parental rights proceedings under ICWA, 25 \n17 U.S.C. ยง 1912(f), New Guidelines at ยง D.3, in Arizona.\n18 128.

Defendant McKayโs compliance with and enforcement of these provisions \n22 subjects Plaintiffs to unequal treatment under color of state and federal law based solely \n23 on the race of the child and the adults involved and therefore deprives Plaintiffs of equal \n24 protection of the law under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n25 See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n26 130. Defendant McKayโs compliance with and enforcement of the jurisdiction-\n27 transfer provision, active efforts provision, burden of proof in foster care placements \n28 provision,  burden  of  proof  in  termination  of  parental  rights  proceedings  provision, \n29of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 30 of 108\n1 foster/preadoptive and adoptive placement preferences provisions under state law,ICWA, \n2 and New Guidelines, violate the substantive due process rights to be free from the use of \n3 race in child custody proceedings and to an individualized race-neutral determination in \n4 child custody proceedings of children with Indian ancestry, and those of adults involved \n5 in their care and upbringing who have an existing family-like relationship with the child. \n6 Defendant McKayโs failure to adequately consider the childโs best interests deprives the \n7 class of plaintiff children of liberty  without  due  process  of  law  in  violation  of  the \n8 Fourteenth Amendment. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n9 COUNT 4 โ THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT EXCEEDS THE FEDERAL \nGOVERNMENTโS POWER UNDER THE INDIAN COMMERCE CLAUSE AND \n10 THE TENTH AMENDMENT.\n11 131.  Plaintiffs  reallege, adopt  and  incorporate  by reference  the  preceding \n12 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n13 132.  ICWA exceeds the federal governmentโs power under the Indian Commerce \n14 Clause  and  the  Tenth  Amendment.  A  child  with  Indian  ancestry  is  not  an  item  of \n15 commerce,  nor  an  instrumentality of  commerce,  nor  tangible  personal  property the \n16 possession  of  which  by federally-recognized  Indian  tribes  promotes  โIndian  self-\n17 government.โ Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 555 (1974). Nor is a federal law dealing \n18 with child custody proceedings โtied rationally to the fulfillment of Congressโ unique \n19 obligation toward the Indians.โ Id.; Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495 (2000). Indeed, the \n20 BIA and the Department of the Interiorโs position is that โICWA and these regulations or \n21 any associated Federal guidelines do not apply to โฆ [t]ribal court proceedings[.]โ Notice \n22 of Proposed Rulemaking, Regulations for State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child \n23 Custody Proceedings, 80 Fed. Reg. 14880, 14887, ยง 23.103(e) (March 20, 2015); New \n24 Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at A.3(e) (same). See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, __ U.S. __, \n25 133 S. Ct. 2552, 2566โ2570 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring).\n26 133.  Congress  cannot  commandeer  state  resources  to  achieve  federal  policy \n27 objectives or commandeer state officers to execute federal laws. Printz v. United States, \n28 521 U.S. 898 (1997). ICWA impermissibly commandeers state courts and state agencies \n30of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 31 of 108\n1 to act as investigative and adjudicatory arms of the federal government or Indian tribes. \n2 ICWA impermissibly commandeers state courts and state agencies to apply, enforce, and\n3 implement an unconstitutional federal law. Dodds v. Richardson, 614 F.3d 1185, 1195โ\n4 1196 & n.3 (10th Cir. 2010); Ariz. Const. art. II, ยง 3.\n5 134.  Child custody proceedings and domestic relations matters are a โvirtually \n6 exclusive province of the Statesโ under the Tenth Amendment upon which the federal \n7 government cannot intrude. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404 (1975).\n8 135.  ICWA displaces inherent state jurisdiction over specified child welfare, \n9 custody, and adoption proceedings and therefore violates the Tenth Amendment. Adoptive \n10 Couple v. Baby Girl, 133 S. Ct. at 2566 (Thomas, J., concurring).\n11 COUNT 5 โ VIOLATION OF ASSOCIATIONAL FREEDOMS UNDER THE \nFIRST AMENDMENT\n12\n13 136.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt  and  incorporate  by reference  the  preceding \n14 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n15 137.  By virtue of ICWA, the tribes make the primary determination whether \n16 children with a specified blood quantum will be brought within their jurisdiction, custody,\n17 and control.\n18 138.  Many children who are subject to ICWA have few, if any, ties to the tribe \n19 upon which ICWA confers jurisdiction over them. Some but not all are members of the \n20 tribes but do not thereby consent to surrender their constitutional rights. Some are enrolled \n21 in the tribes as a result of the mandates of ICWA and the New Guidelines. Others are not \n22 members and have virtually no connection to the tribes other than a prescribed blood \n23 quantum. See New Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. at 10153, B.4(d)(3).\n24 139.  Byoperation of the provisions of ICWAand the New Guidelines challenged \n25 here, Plaintiff children like babygirl A.D. and babyboy C.R. are forced to associate with \n26 tribes and tribal communities and be subject to tribal jurisdiction often against their will \n27 and/or contrary to their best interests. See id. at 10150, A.2 (active efforts required to \n28 reunify an Indian child not onlywith the childโs familybut also with the childโs tribe).\n31of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 32 of 108\n1 140. Under the active efforts provision, DCS is required to โtake steps necessary \n2 to obtain membership for the child in the tribe that is designated as the Indian childโs \n3 tribe.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10153, B.4(d)(iii). DCS, thus, forces children deemed Indian to \n4 associate with and become members of federally-recognized Indian tribes.\n5 141.  This forced association violates Plaintiffsโ freedom of association, which \n6 encompasses the freedom not to associate under the First Amendment. Boy Scouts of \n7 America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000); Knox v. Service Employees Intโl Union, Local \n8 1000, __ U.S. __, 132 S. Ct. 2277 (2012).\n9 COUNT 6 โ UNLAWFUL AGENCY ACTION\n10 142.  Plaintiffs  reallege,  adopt  and  incorporate  by reference  the  preceding \n11 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n12 143.  Whereas ICWAโs jurisdiction-transfer provision is available to transfer only \n13 foster care placement and termination of parental rights proceedings to the jurisdiction of \n14 the tribe, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b), the New Guidelines state, โThe right to request a transfer \n15 is available at any stage of an Indian child custody proceeding, including during any \n16 period of emergency removal.โ 80 Fed. Reg. at 10156, C.1(c) (emphasis added). Further, \n17 the New Guidelines instruct state courts that they โmust transferโ all child custody \n18 proceedings if the parent does not object to the transfer, the tribal court does not decline, \n19 and there is no good cause to deny transfer. New Guidelines, 80 Fed. Reg. 10156, C.2, \n20 C.3.\n21 144.  BIAโs  enlargement  of  the  jurisdiction-transfer  provision,  25  U.S.C.  ยง \n22 1911(b),  New  Guidelines  at  C.1,  C.2,  C.3,  making  the  provision  available  during \n23 preadoptive  placement  and  adoptive  placement  proceedings,  clearly contradicts  the \n24 statutory provision. See 25 U.S.C. ยง 1903(1) (definitions).\n25 145.  BIA overstepped its authority by extending, in the New Guidelines, the \n26 jurisdiction-transfer provision to all child custody proceedings. Such extension, which \n27 directlycontradicts a Congress-enacted provision, harms children in cases where parental \n28 rights have been terminated. It gives tribes the โright to request a transfer,โ 80 Fed. Reg. \n32of 35\n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 33 of 108\n1 at 10156, C.1(c), in cases where Congress expressly did not give tribes a right to request \n2 transfer.\n3 146.

DCS receives \n12 federal financial assistance.\n13 149.

September 30, 2015 \n \nExecutive Summary \n \nThe Arizona Department of Child Safety (DCS) is pleased to publish this semi-annual report for \nApril 2015 through September 2015 in compliance with A.R.S. ยง 8-526.  In May 2014, the \nDepartment of Child Safety was created as a permanent, stand-alone agency with the express \nmission of safeguarding Arizonaโs abused and neglected children.  \n \nThe data within this Semi-Annual Report assists with identifying areas for continued focus by \nthe Department, stakeholders, policy makers, and advocacy groups. By working collaboratively \ntoward shared goals, targeted resources and strategies will be implemented in a coordinated and \npurposeful manner, improving safety, permanency and well-being outcomes for children and \nfamilies. \n \nChild Abuse Hotline and Investigations \n \nThe statewide Child Abuse Hotline received 26,455 calls that met the statutory criteria for a report.  \nOf these, 433 were within the jurisdiction of military or tribal governments and were referred to \nthose jurisdictions. The total number of reports represents a four percent increase over the prior \nreporting  period,  and  a  5.5  percent  increase  over  the  same  reporting  period  last  year.    The \nDepartment continues to experience an increase in neglect reports, while the other maltreatment \ntypes have remained steady.  \n \nIn addition to responding to all reports received in this reporting period, the Department closed \nmore reports (15,076) this reporting period than any other reporting period in the past four years.  \nThis was accomplished even though DCS received more reports than it did in any other reporting \nperiod in the last four years.  This total number of reports closed is limited to reports that were \nreceived during the reporting period and subsequently closed.  Reports that were received in \nprior reporting periods and closed within this reporting period are not included in this total. \n \nThe DCS Strategic Plan was announced in July 2015 and identified several goals with deliverables \nfor the Hotline and investigations.  To date, the Department has completed several deliverables, \nincluding, but not limited to: \n   \nโข  Instituted notification to callers to the Hotline about false reporting penalties; \nโข  Hired dedicated audit staff at the Hotline for quality assurance; \nโข  Completed policy analysis on the investigation/assessment of very low risk families; \nโข  Created a new Hotline screening decision-making tool that clarifies report and \nprioritization requirements; \nโข  Implemented a field guide that facilitates the collection and documentation of safety and \nrisk assessment information; \nโข  Created and implemented supervision guides for investigation and ongoing cases; \nโข  Created a review guide for Assistant Program Managers aligned with the safety; \nassessment model for use in considered removals; \nโข  Implemented Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) reviews of fatality/near fatality cases;  \nโข  Created a data dashboard to monitor open report volume and categorize reports by risk \nfactors; and \nโข  Created a dashboard to track overall investigation case management. \nPage 4 of 69 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 44 of 108\nChild Welfare Reporting Requirements                                    April 1, 2015 - September 30, 2015 \n \n \nChildren in Out-of-Home Care \n \nThe Department remains committed to working with the community to keep children safe and \nprevent  the  need  for  children  to  be  removed  from  their  homes.  Notwithstanding  this \ncommitment, the number of children in out-of-home care increased from 17,592 in the prior \nreporting period to 18,657 in September 2015.  \n \nThe Department continues to make efforts to place children who have been removed from their \nhome  in  the  most  family-like  setting  possible.  In  September  2015,  14,863  children  โ  or \napproximately 80 percent of all children in out-of-home care โ were placed with relatives, licensed \nfoster parents, or trial home visit with a parent.  Efforts to increase the number of licensed foster \nparents who are able to meet the needs of children requiring out-of-home placement resulted in 774 \nnew homes being licensed during the reporting period.     \n \nAs part of the strategic plan, the Department is striving to improve capacity to place children in \nfamily environments and fully meet the needs of children in care and their families.  During this \nreporting period DCS was able to accomplish the following: \n \nโข  Increased use of Placement Coordinators to identify available kinship placements upon \nremoval; \nโข  Expanded the use of software tools, e.g. Lexis Nexis, to find potential kinship placements;  \nโข  Established Fostering Inclusion Respect Support Trust Advisory (FIRST) Commission; and \nโข  Established the Building Resilient Families program to deliver in-home prevention services \nin Maricopa County for low risk families who have been the subject of a DCS investigation. \n \nThe state requires monthly face-to-face visitation with children in foster care.  The current report \nshows that 84.4 percent of the children in foster care received their visitation during the last month \nof the reporting period. There is a strong correlation between caseworker visits with children and \npositive outcomes for these children, such as achieving permanency and other indicators of child \nwell-being.  The Department continues to make efforts to improve our rate of visitation. \n \nPermanency for Children \n \nArizona  is  a  national  leader  in  the  number  of  finalized  adoptions.  The  Department  remains \ncommitted to work toward achieving permanency for children placed in out-of-home care as \ndemonstrated by increasing the total number of children achieving permanency through adoption. \nThis number increased by two percent, from 1,576 during this reporting period compared to 1,552 \nduring the same reporting period last year.   \n \nThe Department demonstrated a significant increase in the number of children safely reunified with \ntheir  families.    3,102  children  exited  DCS  custody  to  reunify  with  their  parents  or  primary \ncaretakers this reporting period compared to 2,636 during the last reporting period, which is an 18% \nincrease. \n \nAs part of the Strategic Plan, the Department continues recruitment efforts of foster and adoptive \nhomes.   Recently, the Department adjusted foster care reimbursement rates for families who are \nPage 5 of 69 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 45 of 108\nChild Welfare Reporting Requirements                                    April 1, 2015 - September 30, 2015 \n \nwilling and capable of providing a home for youth ages 12 to 18 years old and sibling groups in this \nage group.  \n \nStrategic Goals to Address Challenges \n \nThe Department continues to face both workload and process challenges in its efforts to ensure \nsafety and promote permanency for abused and neglected children. Examples of the more pressing \nchallenges the Department continues to pursue include the increased number of children in out-of-\nhome care, the significant amount of overdue investigations, and the need to improve the hiring and \ntraining  of  qualified  personnel.    The  Departmentโs  Strategic  Plan  represents  the  leadershipโs \ncommitment to refocus attention and resources on the safety, permanency, and well-being of \nchildren in Arizona.  Below are five strategic goals that address several of the most pressing \nchallenges faced by the Department:  \n \n1.  Improve objective decision-making at the Hotline and investigations. \n2.  Improve performance and quality of service through employee retention. \n3.  Reduce length of stay for children in out-of-home care. \n4.  Reduce recurrence of maltreatment by improving service delivery. \n5.  Improve capacity to place children in family environments. \n \nAs noted previously, the legislation enacted to create the Department included funding to increase \nthe number of child safety specialists. Hiring these specialists during fiscal year 2015 presented a \nsignificant challenge to the Department.  However, in September 2015 the Department had filled \nnearly all of its budgeted positions for child safety specialists, including staff at the Hotline.   \n \nThe Department continues to assess processes and program controls to identify ways to address \nthese challenges. Solutions will include partnering with the community and stakeholders to ensure \nthat the safety and wellbeing of the children is always the top priority.  The Department continues to \nwork in partnership with the federal government to meet the federal Child and Family Service \nReview (CFSR) standards to improve outcomes for the children and families it serves. \n \nThe Department previously included three charts that were not required by A.R.S. ยง 8-526.  In \norder to better align this report with the requirements of the statute, the Department is not \nincluding these charts anymore.  Information on the number of children in care by placement \ntype and by age is still included in Table 33 of this report.  \n \nPage 6 of 69 \n \n\nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 173   Filed 04/05/16   Page 46 of 108\nChild Welfare Reporting Requirements                                    April 1, 2015 - September 30, 2015 \n \nSemi-Annual Comparisons \n \nOct 2011  Apr 2012  Oct 2012  Apr 2013  Oct 2013  Apr 2014  Oct 2014  Apr 2015 \nthrough  through  through  through  through  through  through  through \nMar 2012  Sep 2012  Mar 2013  Sep 2013  Mar 2014  Sep 2014  Mar 2015  Sep 2015 \nNumber of Reports \n20,466  21,625  22,161  22,032  22,956  25,076  25,508  26,455 \nReceived \nNumber of Reports \n2,748  2,809  2,588  2,704  3,190  3,456  3,535  1,926 \nSubstantiated1 \nSubstantiation Rate  14%  14%  13%  12%  14%  14%  14%  7% \nNumber of Reports \n10,345  9,168  10,923  11,212  11,392  12,038  13,045  15,076 \nInvestigated & Closed \nNumber of Reports \n19,274  20,413  20,253  20,122  22,162  24,435  25,182  26,022 \nResponded to \nNumber of new removals  4,968  5,716  5,101  5,702  5,701  6,461  5,935  6,819 \nNumber of new removals \n150  116  97  118  90  189  131  154 \nwith Voluntary under 18 \nNumber of Children in \nOut-of-Home Care on the \n12,453  14,111  14,314  15,037  15,751  16,990  17,592  18,657 \nLast Day of Reporting \nPeriod \nNumber of Children in \nShelter for More than 21  713  764  792  824  802  868  900  878 \nDays \nNumber and Percentage of \nChildren Receiving \n9,728  10,404  12,101  12,997  13,818  14,846  15,323  15,746 \nVisitation In the Last \n(78.1%)  (73.7%)  (84.5%)  (86.4%)  (87.7%)  (87.4%)  (87.1%)  (84.4%) \nMonth of Reporting \nPeriod \nNumber and Percentage of \n2,725  3,707  2,213  2,040  1,933  2,144  2,269  2,911 \nChildren not  Receiving \n(21.9%)  (26.3%)  (15.5%)  (13.6%)  (12.3%)  (12.6%)  (12.9%)  (15.6%) \nVisitation \nNumber and Percentage of \n1,081  1,017  1,058  1,157  1,344  1,315  1,372  1,576 \nParents Receiving \n(57.1%)  (51.2%)  (50.9%)  (52.4%)  (53.8%)  (52.0%)  (55.7%)  (50.9%) \nVisitation \nNumber of Licensed \n3,480  3,748  3,516  3,900  4,329  4,397  4,497  4,551 \nFoster Homes2 \nNumber of Foster Home \n8,572  7,716  8,579  8,573  9,049  9,061  9,079  9,114 \nSpaces Available to DCS \nNumber of New Foster \n663  999  722  717  1,050  756   821  774 \nHomes  \nNumber of Foster Homes \n679  747  740  715  787  822  785  767 \nClosed \nNumber and Percentage of \nFoster Homes Receiving  3,132  3,095  3,316  3,491  3,689  3,949  3,881  3,925 \nVisitation In the Last Qtr.

This compares to two infants being \ndelivered to Safe Haven providers during the prior reporting period. \n \nCHILDREN ENTERING OUT-OF-HOME CARE \n \nDuring the current reporting period, 6,819 children entered care, which represents a 14.9% increase in \nchildren entering care over the prior reporting period and a 5.5% increase over the same reporting period \nlast year. As can be seen from Chart 18 below, the increasing trend of children entering out-of-home care \ncontinues. This increase in the number of children entering care is not unexpected as the number of \nreports of abuse and neglect has continued to increase (see Chart 1 for number of reports detail). It is \nimportant to note, however, that child welfare data is seasonal.  The trend in the data shows a higher \nnumber of reports and therefore a higher number children entering out-of-home care in reporting periods \nthat cover April through September.  This seasonality can be attributed to higher call volume to the \nHotline in April, Child Abuse Awareness month, and the close and start of the school year in May and \nAugust, respectively.    \n \n \nCHART 18 \nTOTAL CHILDREN ENTERING OUT-OF-HOME CARE BY REPORTING PERIOD \n7,000\n6,500 6,819\nen 6,000 6,461\ndr 5,702\nChil 5,500 4,968 5,716 5,701 5,935\nof  5,000 5,101\nber  4,500\nm\nNu 4,000\n3,500\n3,000\nOctober April 2012 - October April 2013 - October April 2014 - October April 2015 -\n2011 - March September 2012 - March September 2013 - March September 2014 - March September\n2012 2012 2013 2013 2014 2014 2015 2015\n \n \nCHILDREN ENTERING OUT-OF-HOME CARE โ VOLUNTARY SERVICES \n \nThe number of children entering out-of-home placement through voluntary foster care agreements for the \ncurrent reporting period was 154, which represents 2.3 percent of the children entering care this reporting \nperiod.

Reasons for this \ninclude,  but  are  not  limited  to,  licensing  restrictions  on  age,  bed  holds  for  youth  in  treatment  or \nhospitalization, foster parents' need for temporary reprieve from placements and corrective action plans.  \nIn addition, 975 spaces in available foster homes were unused spaces. This occurs when a match between \nthe available spaces and childrenโs needs was not possible.  Unused spaces may be, but are not limited to, \nthe result of a denial by foster parents and/or contractors to the Department's request for placement due to \nthe severity of child's needs, potential risk to other children in the home, the distance of a foster home \nfrom child's family and/or lack of unique services in the foster home's vicinity. \n \nLicensed foster homes include family foster homes, professional family foster homes (HCTC homes), \nrespite foster homes, receiving foster homes, and developmentally disabled homes with DCS children \nplaced in them. Foster home licenses specify the age range, gender and maximum number of children that \ncan be placed in a home. Foster parents, in consultation with the licensing worker, decide the type of \nphysical, behavioral, and psychological needs of children they can effectively parent based upon their \nown skill level, experiences, and desires. \n \nDuring the current reporting period, 774 new homes were licensed to provide foster care and 767 homes \nleft the system. This compares to 821 new homes being licensed and 785 homes leaving the system \nduring the prior reporting period.

S. Department of the Interior; \nGregory A. McKay, in his official capacity \n18 \nas Director of Arizona Department of Child \nSafety, \n19 \n \nDefendants, \n20 \n \nGila River Indian Community and the \n21 \nNavajo Nation, \n \n22 \nIntervenor Defendants.\n23 \n \n \n24 \nBefore the Court are motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint by the \n25 \nFederal Defendants (Doc. 178) and the State Defendant (Doc. 179), the Responses, and \n26 \nthe Replies.  Also before the Court are motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint \n27 \nby the Intervenor-Defendants Gila River Indian Community (Doc. 217) and the Navajo \n28 \n \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 2 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Nation (Doc. 218), the response, and the replies.  Amicus curiae briefs have been filed in \n2  support of and in opposition to the motions to dismiss. \n3  In this action the adult Plaintiffs and those who have undertaken to speak for the \n4  child Plaintiffs attempt to challenge parts of the Indian Child Welfare Act (โICWAโ) as \n5  unconstitutional racial discrimination.  They also challenge Congressโs power to enact \n6  laws regulating state court proceedings and ousting state laws concerning foster care \n7  placement,  termination  of  parental  rights,  preadoptive  placement,  and  adoptive \n8  placements of some off-reservation children of Indian descent.  More specifically, these \n9  are children whose parents elected to leave Indian Country and take up residence off \n10  reservation with the benefits of and obligations under state law of all other persons within \n11  the jurisdiction of the state and outside Indian Country.   \n12  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that certain provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act \n13  and of the Guidelines for State Courts and Agencies in Indian Child Custody Proceedings \n14  published on February 25, 2015 (โ2015 Guidelinesโ)1 by the Department of the Interior, \n15  Bureau of Indian Affairs (โBIAโ), violate the United States Constitution, federal civil \n16  rights statutes, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by requiring State courts to treat \n17  Indian children differently than non-Indian children in child custody proceedings.  They \n18  seek to enjoin the Federal Defendants from enforcing these provisions and the State \n19  Defendant from complying with and enforcing these provisions.  The Guidelines do not \n20  have the force of law.  They might be viewed uncharitably as avoiding the rule-making \n21  requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act but still having enough of the look of \n22  regulations that judges and others will follow them anyway. \n23  In ICWA, adopted in 1978, Congress responded to the increasing adoption by non-\n24  Indian families of Indian children resident off-reservation and subject to the exclusive \n25  jurisdiction of state courts.  Congress enacted ICWA: \n26  . . . to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the \nstability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of \n27 \n                                              \n28  1  80  Fed.  Reg.  10146โ10159  (Feb.  25,  2015)  (superseding  and  replacing  the \nguidelines published at 44 Fed. Reg. 67584โ67595 (Nov. 28, 1979)).   \n \n- 2 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 3 of 20\n \n \n \n1  minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their \nfamilies and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes \n2 \nwhich will reflect the unique values of Indian culture, and by providing for \n3  assistance  to  Indian  tribes  in  the  operation  of  child  and  family  service \nprograms. \n4 \n25 U.S.C. ยง 1902.   \n5 \nFrom the outset Plaintiffs have grounded sweeping challenges to ICWA and the \n6 \n2015 Guidelines on vague or narrow allegations of their own experience with ICWA.  \n7 \nThe motions to dismiss probe the jurisdictional specifics of each Plaintiffโs allegations. \n8 \nI.  REGULATORY BACKGROUND \n9 \nCongress authorized the Department of the Interior to make rules and regulations \n10 \nnecessary for carrying out provisions of ICWA.  25 U.S.C. ยง 1952.  The Department \n11 \npromulgated regulations to govern funding and administering Indian child and family \n12 \nservice programs as authorized by ICWA.  25 C.F.R. ยง 23.1.  The regulations also \n13 \naddressed notice procedures for involuntary child custody proceedings involving Indian \n14 \nchildren, but they โdid not address the specific requirements and standards that ICWA \n15 \nimposes  upon  State  court  child  custody  proceedings,  beyond  the  requirements  for \n16 \ncontents of the notice.โ  80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10147.  To supplement the regulations, the \n17 \nDepartment published guidelines for State courts to use in interpreting many of ICWAโs \n18 \nrequirements in Indian child custody proceedings.  Id.  In 2015, the Department published \n19 \nthe updated 2015 Guidelines to supersede and replace the guidelines published in 1979.  \n20 \nId.  Like the previous guidelines, the 2015 Guidelines are not tethered to regulations. \n21 \nThe 2015 Guidelines โprovide standard procedures and best practices to be used in \n22 \nIndian child welfare proceedings in State courts.โ  80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10147.  They \n23 \nstate, โIn order to fully implement ICWA, these guidelines should be applied in all \n24 \nproceedings and stages of a proceeding in which the Act is or becomes applicable.โ  Id. at \n25 \n10150.  Although the 2015 Guidelines are not binding, Arizona courts nevertheless have \n26 \nconsidered them in interpreting ICWA.  Gila River Indian Cmty. v. Depโt of Child Safety, \n27 \n238 Ariz. 531, 535 (Ct. App. 2015); Gila River Indian Cmty. v. Depโt of Child Safety, 240 \n28 \nAriz. 385, 389 n.12 (Ct. App. 2016).   \n \n- 3 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 4 of 20\n \n \n \n1  In June 2016, the Department added a new subpart to its regulations implementing \n2  ICWA, which โaddresses requirements for State courts in ensuring implementation of \n3  ICWA  in  Indian  child-welfare  proceedings  and  requirements  for  States  to  maintain \n4  records under ICWA.โ  81 Fed. Reg. 38778, 38778 (June 14, 2016).  The regulations in \n5  the new subpart โclarify the minimum Federal standards governing implementation of \n6  [ICWA] to ensure that ICWA is applied in all States consistent with the Actโs express \n7  language, Congressโs intent in enacting the statute, and to promote the stability and \n8  security of Indian tribes and families.โ  25 C.F.R. ยง 23.101. \n9  The new subpart became effective on December 12, 2016.  None of the provisions \n10  of  the  new  subpart  affects  a  proceeding  under  State  law  that  was  initiated  before \n11  December 12, 2016, but the provisions of the new subpart do apply to any subsequent \n12  proceeding in the same matter or affecting the custody or placement of the same child.  \n13  23 C.F.R. ยง 23.143.  For example, the new subpart does not apply to a foster care \n14  placement  proceeding  initiated  in  November  2016,  but  it  does  apply  to  an  adoptive \n15  placement proceeding initiated in January 2017 for the same child. \n16  In conjunction with the new subpart of ICWA regulations, on December 12, 2016, \n17  the Department published Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act \n18  (โ2016 Guidelinesโ), which replaced the 1979 and 2015 versions.  Under each heading, \n19  the  2016  Guidelines  provide  the  text  of  the  regulation  (if  there  is  one),  guidance, \n20  recommended practices, and suggestions for implementation.   \n21  The  Amended  Complaint  does  not  challenge  any  regulations  or  the  2016 \n22  Guidelines.  It challenges only certain provisions of ICWA and the 2015 Guidelines.   \n23  II.  THE AMENDED COMPLAINT \n24  A.  Procedural Background \nOn  July  6,  2015,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Civil  Rights  Class  Action  Complaint  for \n25 \nDeclaratory  and  Injunctive  Relief.    (Doc.  1.)    On  December  18,  2015,  during  oral \n26 \nargument  regarding  standing  issues  raised  in  motions  to  dismiss,  Plaintiffsโ  counsel \n27 \nindicated that Plaintiffs would like to amend their complaint to add additional plaintiffs.  \n28 \n \n- 4 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 5 of 20\n \n \n \n1  (Doc. 122.)  On February 22, 2016, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to file a status report \n2  stating  whether  and  when  they  planned  to  amend  their  complaint  to  add  additional \n3  plaintiffs.  (Doc. 145.)  On February 29, 2016, Plaintiffs reported they wanted to amend \n4  their complaint to add two children and their foster/preadoptive parents as plaintiffs and \n5  to update facts regarding pending State court proceedings.  (Doc. 149.)  On March 2, \n6  2016, Plaintiffs sought leave to file an amended complaint, which Defendants opposed by \n7  arguing, among other things, that both the proposed additional plaintiffs and the original \n8  plaintiffs lacked standing.  (Docs. 150, 160, 162.)  On April 4, 2016, the Court granted \n9  Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint and denied the pending motions to dismiss as \n10  moot.  (Doc. 172.)   \n11  On April 5, 2016, Plaintiffsโ First Amended Civil Rights Class Action Complaint \n12  for Declaratory, Injunctive, and Other Relief (โAmended Complaintโ) was filed.  (Doc. \n13  173.)  On April 22, 2016, the Federal Defendants and the State Defendant filed motions \n14  to dismiss the Amended Complaint.  (Docs. 178, 179.)  On September 29, 2016, the Gila \n15  River Indian Community and the Navajo Nation were granted permissive intervention, \n16  and their proposed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint were filed.  (Doc. 216.)   \n17  B.  Plaintiffsโ Claims for Relief \n18  Count 1 of the Amended Complaint alleges that 25 U.S.C. ยงยง 1911(b), 1912(d), \n19  1912(e), 1912(f), 1915(a), 1915(b) and ยงยง A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2, B.4, B.8, C.1, C.2, C.3, \n20  D.2, D.3, F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4 of the 2015 Guidelines violate the equal protection guarantee \n21  of the Fifth Amendment.  Count 2 alleges that the same statutes and provisions of the \n22  2015 Guidelines violate the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  Count 3 \n23  alleges that the State Defendantโs compliance with the challenged statutes and sections of \n24  the 2015 Guidelines violates the substantive due process and equal protection clauses of \n25  the Fourteenth Amendment.   \n26  Count 4 alleges that ICWA exceeds the federal governmentโs power under the \n27  Indian Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment and impermissibly commandeers \n28  State courts and State agencies.  Count 5 alleges that the challenged statutes and sections \n \n- 5 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 6 of 20\n \n \n \n1  of  the  2015  Guidelines  violate  Plaintiffsโ  associational  freedoms  under  the  First \n2  Amendment by forcing them to associate with tribes and tribal communities.  Count 6 \n3  alleges that the BIA exceeded its authority by publishing ยงยง C.1, C.2, and C.3 of the 2015 \n4  Guidelines, which expand application of ยง 1911(b) beyond its terms.  Count 7 seeks \n5  nominal damages of $1 to each of the named Plaintiffs and to each of the members of the \n6  class  they  seek  to  represent  under  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act,  42  U.S.C. \n7  ยงยง 2000d-2000d-7.2   \n8  C.  The Parties \n9  The Amended Complaint is filed on behalf of Plaintiffs and all off-reservation \n10  Arizona-resident children with Indian ancestry and all off-reservation Arizona-resident \n11  foster,  preadoptive,  and  prospective  adoptive  parents  in  child  custody  proceedings \n12  involving children with Indian ancestry.   \n13  Plaintiff  A.D.  is  an  enrolled  member  of  the  Gila  River  Indian  Community.  \n14  Parental rights of A.D.โs biological parents have been terminated by the State court.  \n15  Plaintiffs S.H. and J.H., a married couple, are foster/preadoptive parents of A.D. and have \n16  taken care of A.D. since birth.  Their petition to adopt A.D. was pending in the State \n17  court on April 5, 2016.  Neither S.H. nor J.H. is an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or \n18  eligible for membership in an Indian tribe.   \n19  Plaintiff C.C. is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation.  Parental rights of \n20  C.C.โs biological parents were terminated, and adoption of C.C. by Plaintiffs M.C. and \n21  K.C. was finalized by the State court in November 2015.  C.C. continuously remained in \n22  foster care with M.C. and K.C. for four years before the adoption was finalized.  Neither \n23  M.C. nor K.C. is an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or eligible for membership in an \n24  Indian tribe. \n                                              \n25 \n2 Section 2000d states:  โNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of \n26  race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \n27 \nfinancial assistance.โ  Section 2000d-7 provides that in a suit against a State for violating \n28  ยง 2000d, remedies are available to the same extent they are available in a suit against any \npublic or private entity other than a State. \n \n- 6 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 7 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Plaintiff C.R. is eligible for membership in and is a child of a member of, or is \n2  already an enrolled member of, the Gila River Indian Community.  Plaintiff L.G. is \n3  C.R.โs half-sibling and is not eligible for membership in the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of \n4  Arizona.  L.G. and C.R. were taken into protective custody when C.R. was born and L.G. \n5  was about two years old.  As of April 5, 2016, the parental rights of C.R.โs and L.G.โs \n6  biological parents had not been terminated by the State court, which is treating C.R.โs and \n7  L.G.โs cases as one.  C.R. and L.G. have continuously remained in foster care with \n8  Plaintiffs K.R. and P.R., a married couple, who want to adopt C.R. and L.G.   \n9  The Amended Complaint names Carol Coghlan Carter and Dr. Ronald Federici as \n10  โnext friendsโ to A.D., C.C., C.R., L.G., and all off-reservation children with Indian \n11  ancestry in the State of Arizona in child custody proceedings.   \n12  The Federal Defendants are Kevin Washburn in his official capacity as Assistant \n13  Secretary of Indian Affairs, BIA, and Sally Jewell in her official capacity as Secretary of \n14  the Interior, U.S. Department of the Interior.  The State Defendant is Gregory McKay in \n15  his official capacity as Director of Arizona Department of Child Safety.  Intervenor \n16  Defendants are the Gila River Indian Community and the Navajo Nation, both federally \n17  recognized tribes.   \n18  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n19  On  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6),  all \n20  allegations  of  material  fact  are  assumed  to  be  true  and  construed  in  the  light  most \n21  favorable to the nonmoving party.  Cousins v. Lockyer, 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. \n22  2009).  To avoid dismissal, a complaint need contain only โenough facts to state a claim \n23  for relief that is plausible on its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n24  (2007).  The principle that a court accepts as true all of the allegations in a complaint \n25  does not apply to legal conclusions or conclusory factual allegations.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n26  556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).   \n27  Under  Rule  12(b)(1),  a  defendant  may  challenge  the  plaintiffโs  jurisdictional \n28  allegations by either (1) attacking the plaintiffโs allegations as insufficient on their face to \n \n- 7 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 8 of 20\n \n \n \n1  invoke federal jurisdiction or (2) contesting the truth of the plaintiffโs factual allegations, \n2  usually by introducing evidence outside the pleadings.  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d \n3  1117, 1121 (9th Cir. 2014).  The first, a facial attack, is resolved by the district court as it \n4  would  be  under  Rule  12(b)(6),  i.e.,  accepting  the  plaintiffโs  allegations  as  true  and \n5  drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffโs favor, the court determines whether \n6  the allegations are legally sufficient to invoke the courtโs jurisdiction.  Id.  The second, a \n7  factual  attack,  requires  the  plaintiff  to  support  its  jurisdictional  allegations  with \n8  competent proof, under the same evidentiary standard applied on summary judgment.  \n9  Thus, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that \n10  each of the requirements for subject matter jurisdiction has been met.  Id.   \n11  IV.  STANDING \n12  A.  Requirements for Article III Standing \nโA  suit  brought  by  a  plaintiff  without  Article  III  standing  is  not  a  โcase  or \n13 \ncontroversy,โ and an Article III federal court therefore lacks subject matter jurisdiction \n14 \nover the suit.โ  Braunstein v. Arizona Depโt of Transp., 683 F.3d 1177, 1184 (9th Cir. \n15 \n2012).  โStanding must be shown with respect to each form of relief sought, whether it be \n16 \ninjunctive relief, damages or civil penalties.โ  Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 511 F.3d \n17 \n974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), \n18 \nInc., 528 U.S. 167, 185 (2000)). \n19 \nTo satisfy Article III standing, a plaintiff must show: \n20 \n(1) [he or she] has suffered an โinjury in factโ that is (a) concrete and \n21 \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; \n22 \n(2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; \nand (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be \n23 \nredressed by a favorable decision.  \n24 \nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180โ81 \n25 \n(2000).  โThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these \n26 \nelements.โ  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).   \n27 \nFor an equal protection claim, a plaintiff may show an โinjury in factโ caused by \n28 \ndenial of equal treatment: \n \n- 8 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 9 of 20\n \n \n \n1  When  the  government  erects  a  barrier  that  makes  it  more  difficult  for \nmembers of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another \n2 \ngroup, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the barrier need \n3  not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in \norder to establish standing.  The โinjury in factโ in an equal protection case \n4 \nof this variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition \n5  of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.  \n6  Ne. Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, \n7  666 (1993).  โ[E]qual treatment under the law is a judicially cognizable interest that \n8  satisfies the case or controversy requirement of Article III, even if it brings no tangible \n9  benefit to the party asserting it.โ  Davis v. Guam, 785 F.3d 1311, 1316 (9th Cir. 2015) \n10  (citing Heckler v. Matthews, 465 U.S. 728, 739 (1984)).  โUnequal treatment is an injury \n11  even if curing the inequality has no tangible consequences.โ  Id.   \n12  However,  even  in  the  equal  protection  context,  โa  plaintiff  must  assert  a \n13  particularized injury, rather than a generalized grievance.โ  Braunstein, 683 F.3d at 1185.  \n14  โEven if the government has discriminated on the basis of race, only those who are \n15  โpersonally deniedโ equal treatment have a cognizable injury under Article III.โ  Id. \n16  (finding  plaintiff  had  not  provided  any  evidence  the  governmentโs  racial  preference \n17  program affected him personally or had impeded his ability to compete for work on an \n18  equal basis). \n19  Ordinarily,  the  existence  of  federal  jurisdiction  depends  on  the  facts  as  they \n20  existed when the complaint was filed.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 569 n.4.   \n21  B.  Injury  in  Fact  that  Is  Concrete  and  Particularized,  Actual  or \nImminent, and Fairly Traceable to the Challenged Action \n22 \nThe  Amended  Complaint  challenges  25  U.S.C.  ยงยง  1911(b),  1912(d),  1912(e), \n23 \n1912(f), and 1915(b) and certain sections of the 2015 Guidelines on multiple grounds, \n24 \nincluding denial of equal treatment, due process, and associational freedoms.   \n25 \n1.  Section 1911(b):  Jurisdiction-Transfer Provision \n26 \nSection 1911(b) requires State courts to transfer any proceeding for the foster care \n27 \nplacement  of,  or  termination  of  parental  rights  to,  an  Indian  child  not  domiciled  or \n28 \nresiding within the reservation of the childโs tribe to the tribal court upon petition of \n \n- 9 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 10 of 20\n \n \n \n1  either parent, the Indian custodian, or the Indian childโs tribe, in the absence of good \n2  cause to the contrary, objection by either parent, or declination by the tribal court of such \n3  tribe.  The Amended Complaint does not allege that transfer of jurisdiction has been \n4  sought for any of the child Plaintiffs except for A.D.   \n5  In A.D.โs case, the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed the juvenile courtโs denial \n6  of the Gila River Indian Communityโs motion to transfer jurisdiction.  Gila River Indian \n7  Cmty. v. Depโt of Child Safety, 240 Ariz. 385, 379 P.3d 1016 (Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2016).  \n8  The court explained that ICWA defines four types of child custody proceedings:  foster \n9  care placement, termination of parental rights proceedings, preadoptive placement, and \n10  adoptive placement.  Id. at 390, 379 P.3d at 1021.  Section 1911(b) provides only for \n11  transfer of foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings.  The court \n12  explained that under ICWA the term โfoster care placementโ is limited to โwhere parental \n13  rights have not been terminated,โ and therefore ยง 1911(b) does not allow transfer to tribal \n14  court of State preadoptive and adoptive placement proceedings occurring after parental \n15  rights have terminated.  Id.  The court found:  \n16  In this case, neither A.D.โs biological parents nor the Community sought to \ntransfer  the  proceedings  from  the  juvenile  court  to  the  Communityโs \n17 \nChildrenโs Court before termination of parental rights.  By the time the \n18  Community moved to transfer, A.D.โs case had progressed to the point \nwhere the biological parentsโ rights had been terminated and legal custody \n19 \nhad been permanently placed with DCS [the Arizona Department of Child \n20  Safety], the juvenile court had found the foster parents were an adoptive \nplacement,  and  the  court  had  authorized  DCS  to  facilitate  permanent \n21 \nplacement of A.D. through adoption.  Further, an adoption petition had \nbeen filed.  By not moving to transfer jurisdiction before termination of the \n22 \nbiological parentsโ rights, the Community effectively waived its right to \n23 \nseek transfer of jurisdiction under 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b).   \n24  Id. at 391, 379 P.3d 1022.  Thus, the Gila River Indian Community did not seek to \n25  enforce  ยง  1911(b),  but  rather  it  sought  a  transfer  of  jurisdiction  not  authorized  by \n26  ยง 1911(b). \n27  It  can  be  inferred  that  A.D.  and  her  foster  parents  suffered  a  concrete  and \n28  particularized  injury  as  a  result  of  the  Gila  River  Indian  Communityโs  litigation.  \n \n- 10 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 11 of 20\n \n \n \n1  However,  their  injury  resulted  from  the  Gila  River  Indian  Communityโs  frivolous \n2  invocation of ยง 1911(b) for a proceeding it plainly does not authorize.  Their injury is \n3  fairly traceable to the Gila River Indian Communityโs groundless intrusion into their \n4  preadoptive and adoptive proceeding beyond the scope of ยง 1911(b), but not to ยง 1911(b) \n5  itself.3 \n6  Thus,  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  allege  facts  showing  that  any  of  the \n7  Plaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, actual or imminent, and fairly \n8  traceable to ยง 1911(b). \n9  2.  Section 1912(d):  Active Efforts Provision \n10  Section 1912(d) requires State officials to make โactive efforts . . . to provide \n11  remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the \n12  Indian familyโ and to show โthat these efforts have proved unsuccessfulโ before an \n13  Indian child may be placed in foster care or parental rights may be terminated.  Although \n14  ICWA does not define โactive efforts,โ ยง A.2 of the 2015 Guidelines defines โactive \n15  effortsโ as: \n16  Active efforts are intended primarily to maintain and reunite an Indian child \nwith  his  or  her  family  or  tribal  community  and  constitute  more  than \n17 \nreasonable efforts as required by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (42 \nU.S.C. ยง 671(a)(15)). \n18 \n80 Fed. Reg. 10146, 10150.  Section A.2 also states:  โโActive effortsโ are separate and \n19 \ndistinct from requirements of the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), 42 U.S.C. \n20 \nยง 1305โ  and  โASFAโs  exceptions  to  reunification  efforts  do  not  apply  to  ICWA \n21 \nproceedings.โ  Id. at 10150-51.4  See also 2015 Guidelines, ยงยง A.3, B.1, B.2, B.4, B.8, \n22 \nD.2. \n23 \n24 \n                                              \n25 \n3 Neither the Amended Complaint nor the appellate decision in A.D.โs case states \n26  that the Gila River Indian Community sought transfer of jurisdiction based on ยงยง C.1, \nC.2, and C.3 of the 2015 Guidelines, which fail to explain that transfer under ยง 1911(b) is \n27 \nlimited to proceedings for foster care placement or termination of parental rights. \n28  4  The  2016  Guidelines  expressly  avoid  comparison  of  โactive  effortsโ  and \nโreasonable efforts.โ  They do not refer to ASFAโs exceptions. \n \n- 11 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 12 of 20\n \n \n \n1  Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 671(a)(15)(B), in order for a State to obtain federal financial \n2  assistance for foster care programs, the State plan must require that โreasonable efforts \n3  shall be made to preserve and reunify families [] prior to the placement of a child in \n4  foster  care.โ    Section  671(a)(15)(D)  provides  exceptions  to  the  โreasonable  effortsโ \n5  requirement  if  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  has  determined  that  the  parent  has \n6  subjected the child to โaggravated circumstances,โ such as abandonment, torture, chronic \n7  abuse, and sexual abuse, or has committed murder or other specific crimes.   \n8  The Amended Complaint alleges that because ยง 1912(d) does not include ASFAโs \n9  exceptions, it requires โactive effortsโ to reunify families even when the children were \n10  abandoned,  tortured,  chronically  abused,  or  sexually  abused  by  family  members.  \n11  However,  ยง  671(a)(15)  applies  only  to  foster  care  placement,  and  the  Amended \n12  Complaint does not allege that any reunification attempts were made before foster care \n13  placement for any of the child Plaintiffs.  Moreover, it does not allege that attempts were \n14  made to reunify any of the child Plaintiffs with family members who had abandoned, \n15  tortured, chronically abused, or sexual abused them. \n16  The  Amended  Complaint  also  alleges  that  the  โactive  effortsโ  provision  of \n17  ยง 1912(d) requires more than the โreasonable effortsโ required under ยง 671(a)(15), and it \n18  delays  child  custody  proceedings,  thereby  depriving  Indian  children  and  their  foster \n19  parents legal recognition of their family status, resulting in uncertainty and great distress.  \n20  Section 1912(d) requires reunification attempts only before foster care placement and \n21  termination of parental rights, and the Amended Complaint does not allege that any \n22  reunification attempts were made before the child Plaintiffs were placed in foster care.  \n23  Therefore, the only possible particularized injury fairly traceable to ยง 1912(d) that any of \n24  the Plaintiffs could have suffered is delay in termination of parental rights.5 \n25 \n                                              \n26  5 The Amended Complaint also alleges that โactive effortsโ provision requires \nIndian children to associate with tribes and tribal communities, but it cites only to a \n27 \nsection  of  the  2015  Guidelines  regarding  designating  an  Indian  childโs  tribe.    The \n28  Amended Complaint does not allege that any of the child Plaintiffs was required to \nassociate with tribes or tribal communities during reunification attempts.   \n \n- 12 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 13 of 20\n \n \n \n1  The Amended Complaint alleges that C.R. and L.G. were placed in foster care \n2  with P.R. and K.R. at the time of C.R.โs birth.  It alleges that State officials initially \n3  attempted reunification with C.R.โs biological mother through weekly supervised visits, \n4  but changed the case management plan to severance in September 2015.  It does not \n5  allege that any reunification attempts were made other than weekly supervised visits with \n6  the biological mother.  As of April 5, 2016, the parental rights of C.R.โs and L.G.โs birth \n7  parents had not been terminated.  The Amended Complaint does not allege that parental \n8  rights for C.R. and L.G. would have been terminated more quickly if โreasonable effortsโ \n9  under ยง 671(a)(15) had been made instead of โactive effortsโ under ยง 1912(d).   \n10  The Amended Complaint does not allege that any attempt was made to reunify \n11  C.C.โs family or A.D.โs family before parental rights were terminated.   \n12  Thus,  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  allege  facts  showing  that  any  of  the \n13  Plaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, actual or imminent, and fairly \n14  traceable to ยง 1912(d). \n15  3.  Section 1912(e):  Higher Evidentiary Standard for Foster Care \nPlacement \n16 \nSection 1912(e) prohibits foster care placement โin the absence of a determination, \n17 \nsupported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert \n18 \nwitnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is \n19 \nlikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.โ  See also 2015 \n20 \nGuidelines, ยง D.3(a).  The Amended Complaint alleges that Arizona law requires only a \n21 \nshowing  of  โreasonable  grounds,โ  โprobable  cause,โ  โreasonable  efforts,โ  or \n22 \nโpreponderance of the evidenceโ at various stages of proceedings leading to foster care \n23 \nplacement of children.  It further alleges that โICWAโs higher burden of proof requires \n24 \n[the Department of Child Safety] to disregard to a greater extent the safety and security of \n25 \nchildren with Indian ancestry based solely on the race of these children.โ   \n26 \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that C.C. was taken into protective custody after \n27 \nhis biological mother was convicted of a felony.  It alleges that A.D. and C.R. were taken \n28 \ninto protective custody at birth.  L.G., who shares the same biological mother as C.R., \n \n- 13 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 14 of 20\n \n \n \n1  was taken into protective custody at the same time as C.R., and ICWA had no application \n2  to L.G. before C.R. was born.  The Amended Complaint does not allege facts showing \n3  that foster care placement for any of the child Plaintiffs was delayed or that any of the \n4  child  Plaintiffs  was  exposed  to  greater  risk  of  harm  because  of  ICWAโs  higher \n5  evidentiary standard.   \n6  Thus,  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  allege  facts  showing  that  any  of  the \n7  Plaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, actual or imminent, and fairly \n8  traceable to ยง 1912(e). \n9  4.  Section 1912(f):  Higher Evidentiary Standard for Termination \nof Parental Rights \n10 \nSection  1912(f)  prohibits  termination  of  parental  rights  โin  the  absence  of  a \n11 \ndetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of \n12 \nqualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian \n13 \ncustodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.โ  See \n14 \nalso  2015  Guidelines,  ยง  D.3(b).    The  Amended  Complaint  alleges  that  ICWAโs \n15 \nrequirement  of  evidence  โbeyond  a  reasonable  doubtโ  is  greater  than  what  would \n16 \notherwise  be  required.    Arizona  law  requires  that  the  party  seeking  termination  of \n17 \nparental  rights  establish  statutory  grounds  by  โclear  and  convincing  evidenceโ  and \n18 \nestablish the best interests of the child by โa preponderance of the evidence.โ  The \n19 \nAmended Complaint alleges that the parental rights of the biological parents of A.D. and \n20 \nC.C. have been terminated, and the parental rights of the biological parents of C.R. and \n21 \nL.G. have not been terminated.  It does not allege that the termination proceedings were \n22 \naffected by the evidentiary standard required by ยง 1912(f) in any way. \n23 \nThus,  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  allege  facts  showing  that  any  of  the \n24 \nPlaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, actual or imminent, and fairly \n25 \ntraceable to ยง 1912(f). \n26 \n5.  Section 1915(a):  Adoptive Placement Preferences \n27 \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that the foster care/preadoptive and adoption \n28 \nplacement preferences imposed by ยงยง 1915(a) and 1915(b) and by the 2015 Guidelines \n \n- 14 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 15 of 20\n \n \n \n1  ยงยง F.1, F.2, F.3, and F.4 โsingle out and treat differently children with Indian ancestry . . . \n2  [and] the non-Indian adults involved in the care and upbringing of children with Indian \n3  ancestry.โ  (Doc. 173 at 27, ยถ 115.)  It also alleges that ยงยง 1915(a) and 1915(b) โviolate \n4  the substantive due process rights of children with Indian ancestry and those of adults \n5  involved in their upbringing who have an existing family-like relationship with the childโ \n6  because  each  of  them  โdeserves  an  individualized,  race-neutral  determination  under \n7  uniform standards when courts make foster/preadoptive care and adoption placement \n8  decisions.โ  (Id. at 28, ยถ 121.)   \n9  Section 1915(a) requires: \n10  In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference \nshall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement \n11 \nwith (1) a member of the childโs extended family; (2) other members of the \n12  Indian childโs tribe; or (3) other Indian families. \nAlthough ICWA does not define โgood cause,โ ยง F.4 of the 2015 Guidelines states:  โThe \n13 \ngood cause determination does not include an independent consideration of the best \n14 \ninterest of the Indian child because the preferences reflect the best interests of an Indian \n15 \nchild in light of the purposes of the Act.โ  80 Fed.

It \n5  does  not  allege  that  A.D.โs  adoption  has  been  delayed  by  ยง 1915(a)โs  placement \n6  preferences. \n7  The Amended Complaint alleges that C.C.โs adoption was delayed by the Navajo \n8  Nationโs  repeated  efforts  to  find  an  adoption  placement  compliant  with  ยง  1915(a)โs \n9  preferences because M.C. and K.C. could not file a petition for adoption until the State \n10  court declared that there was good cause to deviate from ICWAโs adoption placement \n11  preferences.  It alleges that C.C. was repeatedly required to visit with strangers who were \n12  proposed as potential ICWA-compliant placements.  But it does not allege facts, rather \n13  than mere conclusions, showing that C.C.โs adoption would have been completed more \n14  quickly and C.C. would not have been introduced to strangers if ยง 1915(a) did not apply.   \n15  The  Amended  Complaint  alleges  that  the  Gila  River  Indian  Community  has \n16  proposed and will continue to propose ICWA-compliant adoption placements for C.R. \n17  and L.G. and that but for the application of ICWA, C.R. and L.G. likely would have been \n18  cleared for adoption by P.R. and K.R.  It alleges that C.R. and L.G. were placed together \n19  in foster care with P.R. and K.R., as required by Arizona law, because C.R. and L.G. are \n20  well-bonded siblings.  The Amended Complaint does not allege facts, rather than mere \n21  conclusions, showing that the consolidated adoption proceeding for C.R. and L.G. would \n22  have been completed more quickly if ยง 1915(a) did not apply. \n23  Thus,  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  allege  facts  showing  that  any  of  the \n24  Plaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, actual or imminent, and fairly \n25  traceable to ยง 1915(a). \n26  6.  Section 1915(b): Foster Care/Preadoptive Placement Preferences \n27  Section 1915(b) states: \n28  Any child accepted for foster care or preadoptive placement shall be placed \nin the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family and in \n \n- 16 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 17 of 20\n \n \n \n1  which his special needs, if any, may be met.

In any foster care or preadoptive placement, a \n3  preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a \nplacement withโ \n4 \n(i) a member of the Indian childโs extended family; \n5 \n(ii) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian \n6 \nchildโs tribe; \n7  (iii) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized \nnon-Indian licensing authority; or \n8 \n(iv)  an  institution  for  children  approved  by  an  Indian  tribe  or \n9 \noperated by an Indian organization which has a program suitable to \n10  meet the Indian childโs needs. \n11  The Amended Complaint alleges that A.D. was taken into protective custody at \n12  birth, A.D. was placed in foster care with S.H. and J.H., and they have taken care of A.D. \n13  ever since.  It alleges that C.C. was taken into protective custody when he was less than \n14  one year old and he continuously remained in foster care with M.C. and K.C. for four \n15  years before they adopted him in November 2015.  The Amended Complaint alleges that \n16  C.R. was taken into protective custody at birth and placed in foster care with K.R. and \n17  P.R.  At the same time, C.R.โs half-sibling L.G. was placed in foster care with K.R. and \n18  P.R.  The Amended Complaint does not allege any delay in, or effect on, the foster care \n19  placements of the child Plaintiffs caused by ยง 1915(b). \n20  Thus,  the  Amended  Complaint  does  not  allege  facts  showing  that  any  of  the \n21  Plaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, actual or imminent, and fairly \n22  traceable to ยง 1915(b). \n23  7.  Sections C.1, C.2, and C.3 of the 2015 Guidelines \nCount 6 of the Amended Complaint alleges that the BIA exceeded its authority by \n24 \nissuing ยงยง C.1, C.2, and C.3 of the 2015 Guidelines, which make transfer of jurisdiction \n25 \navailable  during  all  child  custody  proceedings,  including  preadoptive  placement  and \n26 \nadoptive placement proceedings.  (Doc. 173 at 32.)  Under 25 U.S.C. ยง 1911(b), the right \n27 \n28 \n \n- 17 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 18 of 20\n \n \n \n1  to request a transfer to tribal jurisdiction is available only in proceedings for foster care \n2  placement or termination of parental rights.7   \n3  Section C.1(a) refers to โeach distinct Indian child custody proceeding.โ  80 Fed. \n4  Reg. 10146, 10156.  Section C.1(b) states, โThe right to request a transfer occurs with \n5  each proceedingโ and provides an example involving only foster care placement and \n6  termination of parental rights.  Id.  Section C.1(c) states, โThe right to request a transfer is \n7  available at any stage of an Indian child custody proceeding, including during any period \n8  of emergency removal.โ  Id.  Section C.3(c) states:  โIn determining whether good cause \n9  [not to transfer] exists, the court may not consider whether the case is at an advanced \n10  stage or whether transfer would result in a change in the placement of the child . . . .โ  Id.  \n11  These provisions are inconsistent with ยง 1911(b)โs limitation to proceedings for foster \n12  care placement and termination of parental rights. \n13  However, the Amended Complaint does not allege that transfer was requested \n14  during a preadoptive or adoptive placement proceeding for C.C., C.R., or L.G.  Although \n15  the Gila River Indian Community sought transfer of A.D.โs proceedings after termination \n16  of parental rights, the Amended Complaint does not allege that the Gila River Indian \n17  Community contended that the 2015 Guidelines authorized transfer of preadoptive and \n18  adoptive placement proceedings.  Therefore, the Amended Complaint does not allege \n19  facts showing that any of the Plaintiffs suffered a concrete and particularized injury, \n20  actual or imminent, and fairly traceable to ยงยง C.1, C.2, and C.3 of the 2015 Guidelines. \n21  Therefore, all of the pending motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint will be \n22  granted, and the Amended Complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and lack \n23  of standing. \n24  Plaintiffs have not sought leave to further amend their complaint, and leave to do \n25  so will not be granted.  Although leave to amend a pleading should be freely given โwhen \n26  justice so requires,โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), courts should consider five factors:  bad \n                                              \n27 \n7 Consistent with ยง 1911(b), the 2016 Guidelines and 25 C.F.R. ยง 23.115 expressly \n28  limit  the  right  to  request  a  transfer  to  proceedings  for  foster  care  placement  and \ntermination of parental rights. \n \n- 18 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 19 of 20\n \n \n \n1  faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, futility of amendment, and whether \n2  the plaintiff has previously amended the complaint.  Johnson v. Buckley, 356 F.3d 1067, \n3  1077 (9th Cir. 2004).  Courts have โespecially broadโ discretion to deny leave to amend \n4  where the plaintiff already has had one or more opportunities to amend a complaint.  \n5  Ascon Props., Inc. v. Mobil Oil Co., 866 F.2d 1149, 1161 (9th Cir. 1989); Moore v. \n6  Kayport Package Exp., Inc., 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989) (โLeave to amend need \n7  not be given if a complaint, as amended, is subject to dismissal.โ).   \n8  Plaintiffs  initiated  this  action  on  July  6,  2015,  alleging  a  putative  class  so \n9  numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, but despite being granted leave to \n10  amend, they have not named any plaintiffs with standing to challenge any provisions of \n11  ICWA or the 2015 Guidelines.  Further leave to amend would cause undue delay and \n12  likely would be futile. \n13  The legal questions Plaintiffs wish to adjudicate here in advance of injury to \n14  themselves  will  be  automatically  remediable  for  anyone  actually  injured.    The  very \n15  allegations of wrongfulness are that such injuries will arise in state court child custody \n16  proceedings, directly in the court processes or in actions taken by state officers under the \n17  control and direction of judges in those proceedings.  Any true injury to any child or \n18  interested adult can be addressed in the state court proceeding itself, based on actual facts \n19  before the court, not on hypothetical concerns.  If any Plaintiffs encounter future real \n20  harm in their own proceedings, the judge in their own case can discern the rules of \n21  decision.  They do not have standing to have this Court pre-adjudicate for state court \n22  judges how to rule on facts that may arise and that may be governed by statutes or \n23  guidelines that this Court may think invalid. \n24  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Federal Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss \n25  First  Amended  Complaint  (Doc.  178),  the  State  Defendantโs  Motion  to  Dismiss \n26  Plaintiffsโ First Amended Civil Rights Complaint for Declaratory, Injunctive, and Other \n27  Relief (Doc. 179), the Gila River Indian Communityโs Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 217), and \n28  the Navajo Nationโs Amended Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 218) are granted. \n \n- 19 - \n\n \nCase 2:15-cv-01259-NVW   Document 244   Filed 03/16/17   Page 20 of 20\n \n \n \n1  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the First Amended Civil Rights Class Action \n2  Complaint for Declaratory, Injunctive, and Other Relief (Doc. 173) is dismissed for lack \n3  of standing. \n4  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  Clerk  of  the  Court  enter  judgment \n5  dismissing this action without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction and lack of standing. \n6  Dated this 16th day of March, 2017. \n7   \n8 \nNeil V.
