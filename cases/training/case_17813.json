Monday, May 25, 2020. Please plan accordingly. Complete information, including a checklist of actions regarding the WDPA NexGen CM/ECF implementation, can be found here. Preparing for NextGen is a two-step process. The first step is to upgrade any legacy PACER accounts. The second step is to link that upgraded PACER account with your WDPA CM/ECF account after the Court goes live with NextGen. To link your account, you will need your current e-filing credentials from our Court. If your CM/ECF login contains any special characters (anything other than a letter or number), you will need to change it as logins with those characters will be unable to link to PACER accounts. No later than Thursday, May 21, 2020, you should log into both PACER and the current version of CM/ECF to review and record your current e-filing credentials for both, as you will need to know them in order to e-file after May 23, 2020. Please consult the Court's administrative order for additional information on deadlines and alternative filing options during this period. (Administrator, ) (ADI)"

    "summary": "<p>The plaintiffs, four Pennsylvania counties and several Pennsylvania residents and business organizations, brought this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on May 7, 2020 against the Governor of Pennsylvania and the Secretary of the state's Department of Health. The suit was in response to a March 19, 2020 order that prohibited the operation of non-\"life sustaining\" businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that the shutdown order violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the Substantive and Procedural Due Process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the First Amendment's right to free association. The plaintiffs sought an injunction preventing further enforcement of the business shutdown order and the elimination of the waiver system. They also sought a declaratory judgment that the issuance and enforcement of the order is unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>On May 28, 2020, the court allowed the case to continue, despite an ease in restrictions. 2020 WL 2769105. The court found that declaratory relief for the plaintiffs could still be awarded even if injunctive relief was now impossible under their claims. However, the court did set aside plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment takings clause claims and their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claims regarding the state's waiver process. The court found that declaratory relief was not appropriate for either of these claims, but allowed the case to continue on all other claims.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 2020, the court dismissed the county plaintiffs from the case, finding. District Judge William Stickman IV found that the county plaintiffs were improper because they are not conferred constitutional rights under the U.S. Constitution. 2020 WL 5510690. Judge Stickman determined that the defendants' limits on gatherings violated the plaintiffs' right to free speech and their right of assembly because the limitations were not narrowly tailored to serve a government interest. The court also found that the defendants' orders violated the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, finding that broad and population and business lockdowns are nearly impossible under the Constitution. In addition, the court found that the business lockdowns violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since large retailers largely remained open while small specialty stores were forced to close.</p>\r\n<p>On October 1, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted a motion by the appellants for stay of the district court's order pending appeal. USCA Case Number 20-2936. The appeal is ongoing.</p>",

(Breth, Thomas) (Entered: 05/08/2020) \n05/16/2020    FINAL NOTICE: In preparation of the Court's conversion to \nNextGen, our Court's CM/ECF system will be unavailable from 12:00 \n\np.m. (Noon) on Friday, May 22, 2020, until 11:59 pm. Monday, May \n25, 2020. Please plan accordingly. Complete information, including a \nchecklist of actions regarding the WDPA NexGen CM/ECF \nimplementation, can be found here. Preparing for NextGen is a two-step \nprocess. The first step is to upgrade any legacy PACER accounts. The \nsecond step is to link that upgraded PACER account with your WDPA \nCM/ECF account after the Court goes live with NextGen. To link your \naccount, you will need your current e-filing credentials from our Court. If \nyour CM/ECF login contains any special characters (anything other \nthan a letter or number), you will need to change it as logins with \nthose characters will be unable to link to PACER accounts. No later \nthan Thursday, May 21, 2020, you should log into both PACER and the \ncurrent version of CM/ECF to review and record your current e-filing \ncredentials for both, as you will need to know them in order to e-file after \nMay 23, 2020. Please consult the Court's administrative order for \nadditional information on deadlines and alternative filing options during \nthis period.

Hon. WilliamS. Stickman IV \nTHOMAS W. WOLF, et al, \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM ORDER \nOn September 14, 2020, the Court entered an Order and Opinion granting declaratory \njudgment in favor of some of the Plaintiffs1 and holding that certain elements of Defendants' \nCOVID-19 mitigation orders violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution.  (ECF Nos. 79 and 80).  Defendants have moved for the Court to stay its judgment \npending appeal.  (ECF No. 84).  For the reasons set forth below, the Motion to Stay is DENIED. \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA district court may stay a judgment pending appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 62.2 Granting such a stay is committed to the discretion of a district court. !d.; Virginian \nRy.  Co.  v.  United States, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926) (citation omitted) (\"A stay is not a matter of \n1  The Court held that County Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert constitutional claims under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983. \n2  The plain language of Rule 62( c) refers to stays from the imposition of injunctions and makes \nno mention of declaratory judgment actions.  However, courts have held that Rule 62 and the \nanalysis  used to  determine  whether  a  stay  is  warranted thereunder  is  equally  applicable  to \ndeclaratory relief.  See  United States v.  Safehouse. ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2020 WL 3447775, at *2 \n(E.D. Pa. Jun. 24, 2020). \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 2 of 15\nright, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result to the appellant. It is an exercise of judicial \ndiscretion.\").  The '\"exercise of judicial discretion,' and 'the propriety of its issue is dependent \nupon the circumstances ofthe particular case.\"' Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418,433 (2009) (quoting \nVirginian Ry. Co., 272 U.S. at 672-73). \nThe party requesting the stay bears the burden of demonstrating that a stay is appropriate. \n!d. at 433-34.  The factors for determining whether a stay is appropriate include the following: \n( 1) Whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed \non the merits; \n(2) Whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; \n(3) Whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and \n( 4) Where the public interest lies. \nIn re Revel AC, Inc., 802 F.3d 558,568 (3d. Cir. 2015) (citing Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, \n776 (1987)).  District courts must \"'balance them all' and 'consider the relative strengths of the \nfour factors\"' !d. at 568 (quoting Brady v.  Nat'! Football League, 640 F.3d 785, 789 (8th Cir. \n2011)). \nThe most important factors are the first two.  !d. (citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 434).  As to the \nfirst factor, a strong showing of the likelihood of success exists if there is \"a reasonable chance, or \nprobability, of winning.\" Singer Mgmt.  Consultants, Inc. v. Milgram, 650 F.3d 223, 229 (3d Cir. \n2011) (en bane). \"[W]hile it is not enough that the chance of success on the merits 'be better than \nnegligible,' ... the likelihood of winning on appeal need not be 'more likely than not.\"' Revel, 802 \nF.3d at 569 (first quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 434, then quoting Singer Mgmt. Consultants, 650 F.3d \nat 229).  To satisfy the second factor, the movant must demonstrate that \"irreparable injury is \n'likely [not merely possible] in the absence of a stay.\"'  !d. (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 3 of 15\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)) (alteration in original). \"Likely\" is understood to mean \"more \napt to occur than not.\"  Id. (citation omitted).  To establish irreparable injury, the movant \"must \ndemonstrate an injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.\" Id. at 571 \n(quoting Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d 969, 975 (2d Cir. 1989)). \nUpon satisfaction of the first two factors, courts assess the harm to the opposing parties \nand weigh the public interest.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  In particular, district courts balance the \nharms by weighing the likely harm to the movant absent a stay, the second factor, against the likely \nharm to stay opponents if the stay is granted, the third factor.  Revel, 802 F.3d at 569.  District \ncourts also evaluate where the public interest lies, the fourth factor, which calls for gauging \n\"consequences  beyond the  immediate parties.\"  Id.  (quoting Roland Mach.  Co.  v.  Dresser \nIndustries, Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 388 (7th Cir. 1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nOur  Third  Circuit  Court  of Appeals  has  embraced  a  \"sliding-scale\"  approach  to \ndetermining how strong a case a movant must show.  I d.  (citations omitted).  Under this sliding \nscale, in essence, \"[t]he more likely the [movant] is to win, the less heavily need the balance of \nharms weigh in [its] favor; the less likely [it] is to win, the more [heavily] need [the balance of \nharms] weigh in [its] favor.\" I d. (quoting Roland Mach., 749 F .2d at 3 87) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (alterations in and to original).  In essence, all four stay factors are interconnected, and \nthe analysis proceeds as follows: \nDid the applicant make a sufficient showing that (a)  it can win on the merits \n(significantly better than negligible but not greater than 50%) and (b) it will suffer \nirreparable harm absent a stay? If it has, we \"balance the relative harms considering \nall four factors using a 'sliding[-]scale' approach.  However, ifthe movant does not \nmake the requisite showings on either of these [first] two factors, the[] inquiry into \nthe balance of harms [and the public interest] is unnecessary, and the stay should \nbe denied without further analysis.\" \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 4 of 15\n!d. at 571  (quoting Matter of Forty-Eight Insulations,  Inc.,  115 F.3d 1294, 1300-01 (7th Cir. \n1997)) (alterations in original). \nII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT MET THE REQUISITE SHOWING OF A MORE THAN \nNEGLIGIBLE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS. \nTo carry their burden to show that they are likely to succeed on the merits, Defendants need \nonly demonstrate that they have \"a reasonable chance, or probability, of winning.\"  Revel, 802 \nF.3d at 571.  The chance of prevailing on appeal must be \"significantly better than negligible,\" but \n\"need not be more likely than not.\"  !d. at 569, 571.  While Defendants contend that they have a \nstrong likelihood of success on appeal for several reasons, the Court holds that the record does not \nsupport their position. \nThe primary focus of the request for a stay is the Court's determination that the imposition \nof numeric congregate gathering restrictions violated the First Amendment.  It is critical to note \nthat the Court did not hold that Defendants were powerless to enact limitations on gatherings. \nRather, the Court merely held that the First Amendment will not permit a specific numeric cap on \nsome gatherings while imposing a limitation based on general occupancy on other gatherings. The \nCourt believes that, as to this issue, Defendants have not met their burden of establishing even the \nminimal showing of success on the merits required by the Third Circuit in Revel. \nFirst, it is important to note that the Court's judgment did not arise out of proceedings on \na temporary restraining order or even a preliminary injunction, but rather, the parties had the \nopportunity to  develop  a  full  evidentiary  record under  Rule  57.  Despite this  opportunity, \nDefendants did not proffer any specific evidence to differentiate between the danger allegedly \nposed  by  gatherings  governed  by  specific  numeric  limitations  and  gatherings  governed  by \noccupancy limitations. The appellate court will be bound by the same record upon which the Court \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 5 of 15\npremised its decision.  Despite Defendants having every opportunity to make a record, there is \nsimply no evidence that would justify, from a constitutional perspective, the disparate treatment \nof gatherings. 3 \nThe Court also notes that its decision on the First Amendment issue is not an outlier but is \nin concert with other federal courts that have struck down COVID-19 gathering limits that were \nmore restrictive than the occupancy percentage limits that were placed on commercial gatherings. \nThe Court's opinion examined the decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Kentucky in Ramsek v.  Beshear, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2020 WL 3446249 (E.D. Ky. Jun. \n24, 2020), which similarly struck down restrictions on \"mass gatherings\" to fifty or fewer people \nwhile permitting gatherings in some places \"namely, airports, bus stations and grocery stores.\" Id \nat *9.  Likewise, in Tabernacle Baptist Church,  Inc.  v.  Beshear, ---F.  Supp. 3d---, 2020 WL \n2305307 (E.D.  Ky.  May 8,  2020), the same judge held that numeric restrictions on religious \ngatherings similarly failed scrutiny and observed that \"[i]f social distancing is good enough for \nHome Depot and Kroger, it is good enough for in-person religious services which, unlike the \nforegoing, benefit from constitutional protection.\" Id at * 5.  In Marysville Baptist Church, Inc. v. \nBeshear, 957 F.3d 610 (6th Cir. 2020), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit \ngranted an injunction pending appeal in favor of plaintiffs challenging an order limiting parking-\nlot religious services where there was no limit to parking in retail establishments.  Id at 616; see \nalso id at 614 (\"The orders allow 'life sustaining' operations and don't include worship services \n3  Defendants' Brief in Support of Stay cites to several newspaper and magazine articles that \npurport to show the justification for limitations on gatherings.  Some of these articles predate the \nevidentiary hearing in this case, but they were neither discussed nor used as exhibits. Defendants \nnever moved to supplement the record to submit the articles to the Court (as Plaintiffs did on \nmultiple occasions).  These articles are not part of the record.  Defendants cannot rely upon them \nto buttress or supplement the record that was properly before the Court and which will be before \nthe Third Circuit on appeal. \n5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 6 of 15\nin that definition.  And many of the serial exemptions for secular activities pose comparable public \nhealth risks to worship services.  For example: The exception for 'life sustaining' business allows \nlaw firms, laundromats, liquor stores, and gun shops to continue to operate so long as they follow \nsocial distancing and other health related precautions.\"); Soos v.  Cuomo, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2020 \nWL 34887 42, at *7-14 (N.D.N. Y. Jun. 26, 2020) (rejecting on First Amendment grounds disparate \ntreatment of religious and commercial gatherings).  The Court believes that its decision is in \nconcert with this line of cases that recognize, on one hand, the authority of public officials to limit \ngatherings during a public health emergency while, on the other hand, finding that strict numeric \nlimitations on some gatherings while using a percentage of occupancy limits for others violates \nthe First Amendment. \nThe  lack  of record  support  for  the  distinction  between  the  numenc  and  percentage \nlimitations, as well as the consensus between the Court's decision and those of other courts facing \nthe same issue, lead the Court to hold that Defendants have failed to establish even a minimal \nlikelihood of success on the merits on the First Amendment issue.4 \nAs a final note on this factor, Defendants contend that the Court's decision created a split \nof authority  among  Pennsylvania  state  and  federal  courts  that  have  addressed  COVID-19 \n4 The Motion to Stay largely focuses on the impact of the Court's determination on congregate \ngathering.  As to the Court's determination that the components of Defendants' orders closing \n\"non-life-sustaining\"  businesses  and  ordering  Pennsylvanians  to  stay-at-home  were \nunconstitutional,  the  Court  agrees  that  its  decision  addressed  novel  issues  pertaining  to \nunprecedented  restrictions  imposed  by  Defendants  upon  the  people  of the  Commonwealth. \nAlthough the Court attempted to view those restrictions through the lens of existing cases, it agrees \nthat the comparisons may not be entirely congruent.  Thus, under the minimal requirement for \n\"likelihood of success on the merits,\" which does not even require Defendants to show that they \nare \"more likely than not\" to prevail, the Court finds that Defendants have established the first \nprong for  the  issuance  of a stay pending appeal  on the  Fourteenth Amendment issue  alone. \nHowever, as explained below, the record does not support a showing of irreparable harm if a stay \nis not granted on these issues. \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 7 of 15\nrestrictions and that that split of authority weighs in favor of finding a likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  Defendants' position compares cases that, while facially similar, are not procedurally \ncomparable.  In Benner v.  Wolf, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2020 WL 2564920, (M.D. Pa. May 21, 2020), \nthe district court addressed several of the same issues in his case.  But, procedurally, the decision \nin Benner was a denial of a temporary restraining order. There, the threshold question was whether \nthe plaintiffs had a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.  This case is a judgment on the \nmerits after the development of a full evidentiary record.  The Court was not predicting an ultimate \noutcome but, informed by a full record, made the ultimate determination. \nIn Paradise Concepts, Inc. v.  Wolf, 2020 WL 5121345 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2020), the court \nhad much narrower claims before it-challenging the denial of waivers under the defendants' \ndefunct waiver program.  !d.  at *1-3.  The district court granted-in-part and denied-in-part the \ndefendants' motion to dismiss.  !d. at *5.  While, in the context of the claims and arguments made \nin that case, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claim asserting substantive due process, it allowed \ntheir equal protection claim to proceed.  !d.  at *3-5.  No final judgment on the merits, with a \nrecord, had been rendered in that case.  !d. \nFinally, while the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in Friends of Danny De Vito v. \nWolf, 227 A. 3d 872 (Pa. 2020), addresses some of the federal constitutional issues presented in \nthis case, the Court reviewed the issue under its King's Bench powers, rather than through its \nappellate jurisdiction.  !d. at 876.  As such, it had no evidentiary record before it when it made its \ndecision.  This was in marked contrast to the fully developed record here.  In any event, while the \nPennsylvania Supreme Court is final on questions of Pennsylvania law, it does not bind this Court \non federal questions. \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 8 of 15\nB.  DEFENDANTS WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLY INJURED BY THE DENIAL OF A \nSTAY. \nThe Court is not convinced that the evidence of record supports Defendants' contention \nthat irreparable harm will result if a stay is not imposed.  To  demonstrate irreparable injury, \nDefendants must demonstrate \"'harm that cannot be prevented or fully rectified' by a successful \nappeal.\" Revel, 802 F.3d at 568 (quoting Roland Mach., 749 F.2d at 386).  Further, the possibility \nthat \"corrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation, weighs \nheavily against a claim of irreparable harm.\"  Id. (quoting Sampsom v.  Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 \n(1974)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The injury must be \"neither remote nor speculative, \nbut actual and imminent.\"  !d. at 571 (quoting Schlesinger, 888 F.2d at 975) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). Defendants must demonstrate that such injury is likely, that is, \"more apt to occur \nthan not.\"  I d. \nThe harms Defendants assert are highly speculative in light of the record-a record that \nthey had every opportunity to develop. Defendants contend that they \"are in the midst of managing \nand mitigating a global health crisis,\" and the Court's decision makes it \"difficult\" for them \"to \ndevelop ongoing mitigation efforts\" while at the same time creating \"uncertainty, confusion, and \ndanger for Pennsylvanians.\"  (ECF No.  85, pp.  8-9).  According to Defendants, the Court's \ndecision has stripped them of their \"ability to adjust to an uncertain future.\"  (ECF No. 85, p. 9). \nThey go so far as to posit that \"eliminating the congregate limits during the pendency of the appeal \nwill result in people's deaths.\"  (ECF No. 85, p. 9).  It is their contention that \"super spreader \nevents-events where large numbers of people gather-are driving the spread of this disease,\" and \nthey point the Court to information not entered into evidence during or after the declaratory \njudgment proceedings. (ECF No. 85, pp. 9-11 ).  The Court notes that the irreparable harm asserted \n8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 9 of 15\nby Defendants is twofold, encompassing the harm to them in managing a global health crisis and \nthe harm to the public that they assert will occur absent a stay. \nFirst, as to the primary thrust of Defendants' request for a stay-that the determination that \nthe  specific  numeric  congregate  gathering  limits  violate  the  First  Amendment  will  cause \nirreparable harm-their position is simply not supported by the record, a record that they had every \nopportunity to develop.  As mentioned above, it is critical to recognize that the Court's decision \ndoes not divest Defendants of any-and-all authority to impose restrictions on gatherings.  Rather, \nthe percentage restrictions imposed on certain businesses and activities remain in place (and, \nindeed, were not directly challenged by Plaintiffs in their submissions).  Under the May 29, 2020 \nOrder moving counties into the \"green phase,\" occupancy restrictions on businesses were set \nbetween 50% and 75% of\"the maximum capacity stated on the applicable certificate of occupancy \nat any given time.\"  (ECF No. 42-58, pp. 2-3).  Further, the Order provided that \"[b]usinesses must \nstill enforce social distancing requirements, which may limit occupancy below [the percentage] \nmaximum capacity.\"  (ECF No. 42-58, pp. 2-3).  The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that \neffective  September  21,  2020,  Defendants  have  issued  orders  increasing  the  indoor  dining \noccupancy limitation to 50% of the establishment's occupancy requirement.  Thus, the record \nshows  that  under  Defendants'  own  orders,  and  with  their  blessing,  the  people  of the \nCommonwealth may gather in workplaces, offices, stores, restaurants and other businesses limited \nonly to a percentage of occupancy.  They do not assert, and the record does not show, that those \ngatherings are categorically different than others covered by a numeric limitation. \nIndeed, despite having an opportunity to adduce testimony and exhibits in support of their \nposition, Defendants did not adduce any evidence that would explain and justify treating social, \ncultural, political and other similar gatherings differently from the commercial gatherings covered \n9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 10 of 15\nby a percentage of occupancy-based limitation.  Mr.  Robinson testified that there was concern \nabout large gatherings, like conventions, causing \"mega spreading events.\"  (ECF No. 75, pp. 55-\n56).  But neither Mr. Robinson nor any other witness proffered by Defendants explained the \nspecific need to limit size of some gatherings by a numeric cap, rather than a limitation on \noccupancy.  For example, nobody explained why hundreds may gather indoors to shop (the larger \nthe facility, the more people permitted), dozens may dine in a restaurant (again, the larger the \nrestaurant, the more will be permitted), but no more than twenty-five may attend an indoor lecture, \na speech or a wedding. 5  Defendants failed to adduce evidence that would explain why they made \ndistinctions between gatherings limited by number and those limited by occupancy.  Their \nsuggestion of irreparable harm because of the inability to impose set-number restrictions is not \nsupported by the evidentiary record.  They did not demonstrate why their limits on some activities \nby occupancy is reasonably safe but will pose irreparable and imminent danger for other activities. \nFrom a different perspective, not only does the record not support the suggestion of \nimmediate and irreparable harm if Defendants may not impose numeric limitations on certain \ngatherings, but their actions actually show the opposite-that they do not believe that gatherings \nexceeding their numeric caps will necessarily cause such harm.  For example, to avoid litigation \nin  the  Pennsylvania  Commonwealth  Court,  Defendants  entered  a  Confidential  Settlement \nAgreement permitting  a  large  event to  take  place  in Carlisle,  Cumberland County-Spring \n5 When pressed for details, Mr.  Robinson was unable to offer any actual examples of mega \nspreading events that occurred at any of the activities limited by numeric caps.  He was asked, for \nexample about weddings: \"[d]o you know of the existence of a single wedding reception or \nwedding celebration, a single one in Pennsylvania, that can be identified as a source of the spread \nof either COVID or the virus, of the SARS virus?\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 55).  He responded \"I am not \naware.  But again, that would be a question that might be better answered by my colleagues in the \nDepartment of Health.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 55).  Ms. Boateng, who testified for the Department of \nHealth, did not offer any more details. \n10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 11 of 15\nCarlisle, a large gathering featuring an automotive flea market and auction.  (ECF No. 64-1).6 \nDefendants agreed to allow the event to proceed with an indoor occupancy of \"the lesser of 250 \nindividuals or 50% of the maximum building occupancy.\" (ECF No. 64-1, Section 2a).  This limit \nis ten-times higher than the 25-person cap on gatherings imposed by Defendants' July 15, 2020 \nOrder.  Defendants  imposed  an  outdoor  limitation  on the  event of \"no  more  than 20,000 \nindividuals, which is 50% of its capacity.\"  (ECF No. 64-1, Section 2b) (emphasis added).  This \nis nearly 100 times the permissible outdoor gathering limit of250.  The Confidential Agreement \nalso  required the  event's sponsor to  \"enforce all applicable social distancing, masking,  area \ncleaning and hygiene requirements.\"  (ECF No. 64-1, Section 2c). \nThe protests that swept across the Commonwealth throughout the summer are another \nexample of where the record dispels Defendants' suggestion of immediate and irreparable harm if \nthey cannot impose specific numeric limitations.  While the plain language  of Defendants' orders \nmakes no allowance for protests, Defendants' own actions and the statements of their witnesses \nshow that they do not view that type of gathering as posing a risk of immediate and irreparable \nharm.  Governor Wolf, for example, personally participated in a large protest.  The photo of that \nprotest does not indicate that social distancing requirements were honored or enforced.  (ECF No. \n42-1 00).  Ms. Boateng averred that there have been gatherings that exceeded the numeric caps in \nDefendants' orders and that \"no official action was taken in regard to public entities holding board \nmeetings, town hall meetings, public protests or public rallies that exceeded these numbers.\" (ECF \nNo. 37, ~13). \"Rather, individuals attending such events were encouraged to wear a face covering \nand practice social distancing.\"  (ECF No. 37, ~14). \n6  The Confidential Settlement Agreement was made public through a FOIA request and was made \npart of the record via Plaintiffs' Second Motion Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201 \"Judicial \nNotice of Adjudicative Facts.\"  (ECF Nos. 60 & 61). \n11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 12 of 15\nDefendants'  treatment  of Spring  Carlisle  and  the  large  public  protests  across  the \nCommonwealth undermine their current argument that imminent and irreparable harm will occur \nabsent their ability to impose numeric occupancy caps.  On the contrary, for the Spring Carlisle \nevent, Defendants were content to impose the same percentage of occupancy limitation that they \nhave imposed to business gatherings (including an allowance of up to 20,000 people to gather), \nalong with required social distancing and masks.  Likewise, Ms.  Boateng acknowledged that \nDefendants  chose  not  to  enforce  their  orders  vis-a-vis  certain  meetings  and  protests,  only \nencouraging the participants to wear masks and practice social distancing.  The fully developed \nrecord offers no  explanation or support for Defendants'  argument that people can gather in \nrestaurants and businesses across the Commonwealth based on occupancy limitations, that Spring \nCarlisle can proceed based on occupancy limitations (recognizing it would draw numbers far \nexceeding the numeric caps) and that protests can occur with no limit (but encouraging masks and \nsocial distancing), but that the inability to cap some gatherings in some locations for some purposes \nwill cause the super-spread of COVID-19 and lead to immediate and irreparable harm. \nAlthough addressed above in relation to success on the merits, the Court will reiterate that \nthe articles Defendants cite in support of their Motion to Stay cannot support their claim that \nirreparable harm will occur absent a stay.  Although some of the articles predate the hearing, \nDefendants neither discussed them nor attempted to offer them as exhibits. Defendants never even \nattempted to supplement the record.  Again, Defendants had an opportunity to proffer any witness \nthat they  desired  and  any  evidence permitted by law to  demonstrate  why  the numeric  cap \nlimitations were necessary for some, but not other gatherings.  They did not do so.  They cannot \nnow rely on articles that were not part of the record to support their claim. \n12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 13 of 15\nThe focus  of Defendants'  argument vis-a-vis irreparable harm is upon the congregate \ngathering restrictions.  However, to the extent that their argument can be read to  claim that \nirreparable harm will result if a stay is not granted on the Court's determination that the business \nclosure and stay-at-home provisions of Defendants' orders violated the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthe Court will also reject that contention. Defendants' own Motion dispels any claim of irreparable \nharm absent a stay.  They assert that \"the Court overlooked testimony that the Administration \ndoes not plan to reinstate the business closure or stay at home orders.\"  (ECF No. 84, ~13). The \nCourt did not, in fact,  overlook this testimony, but rather recognized that those provisions of \nDefendants' orders remain in place, yet suspended, and testimony confirmed that they could be \nreinstated at will by Defendants.  But whether those components of Defendants orders remained \nbefore  the  Court  and  whether  failure  to  stay  the  Court's the  determination that they  were \nunconstitutional  will  cause  irreparable  harm  are  two  separate inquiries.  Defendants  cannot \nreasonably claim that absent a stay there will be irreparable harm when they, themselves, have \nsuspended the operation of the stay-at-home and business closure provisions and they, themselves, \nstate that they have no intention of reinstating them, at least at this time. As such, Defendants have \nnot established that irreparable harm will result unless the Court stays its Order relative to the \nbusiness closure and stay-at-home provisions of their orders. \nC.  BECAUSE DEFENDANTS HAVE NOT MET THEIR BURDEN ON THE FIRST TWO \nFACTORS, IT IS UNNECESSARY TO WEIGH THE THIRD AND FOURTH FACTORS. \nIn Revel, the Third Circuit observed that \"if the movant does not make the requisite \nshowing on either of these [first] two factors, the [] inquiry into the balance of harms [and the \npublic interest] is unnecessary, and the stay should be denied without further analysis.\" Revel, 802 \nF.3d at 571 (quoting In re Forty-Eight Insulations, 115 F.3d at 1300-01).  As explained above, \nDefendants have not met the requisite showing as to the first two factors.  There is no need, \n13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 14 of 15\ntherefore, for the Court to examine the final four factors-whether imposing a stay would harm \nPlaintiffs and an examination of general public interest.  However, even if the Court was required \nto give equal consideration of those factors, it holds that they, too, would weigh against a stay. \nThe record demonstrates that the congregate gathering limits caused harm to the Plaintiffs \nwho are candidates for political office, limiting their ability to fundraise and campaign. Moreover, \nthe  restrictions  imposed  an  unconstitutional  limit  on  the  freedom  of  assembly  of  all \nPennsylvanians. Imposing a stay would only perpetuate those unconstitutional limits during the \npendency ofthe appeal.  Likewise, as to the stay-at-home and business shutdown components of \nDefendants' orders, a stay would only continue the uncertainty that Defendants could, again, \nimpose those novel and draconian restrictions on the people of the Commonwealth. \nFinally, the public interest weighs against a stay.  Defendants' brief argument as to the \npublic interest factor largely mirrors their argument as to irreparable harm.  As explained above, \nhowever, the record does not support their contention on that factor.  Nor does the record support \na contention that the public interest will be harmed if a stay is not imposed.  Rather, the public \ninterest will be harmed if a stay is imposed. The public has an interest in constitutional governance \nand, more specifically, not being subject to unconstitutional governmental action.  See Dodds v. \nUnited States Dep 't ofEduc., 845 F.3d 217,222 (6th Cir. 2016) (\"[P]ublic interest weighs strongly \nagainst  a  stay  of the  injunction.  The  district  court  issued the  injunction to  protect Doe's \nconstitutional and civil rights, a purpose that is always in the public interest.\"); Victory v.  Berks \nCty, 2019 WL 2368579, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Jun. 3, 2019) (denying stay where district court found facts \nand  circumstances  favored  petitioner's  \"constitutional  right  to  be  free  from  gender \ndiscrimination\"); Halderman v. Pennhurst State Sch.  and Hospital, 451 F. Supp. 233, 237 (E.D. \nPa. 1978) (\"The public interest will never benefit from a failure to provide minimally adequate \n14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 91   Filed 09/22/20   Page 15 of 15\nhabilitation to its [intellectually disabled] citizens.  This Court's Order represents nothing more \nthan a judicial recognition that the [intellectually disabled] have constitutional and statutory rights \nwhich must not be denied.\"); N.C. Democratic Party v. Berger, 2018 WL 7982918, at *6 (M.D. \nN.C. Feb. 7, 2018) (\"There is a weighty public interest against enforcing laws a court fmds are \nlikely to be unconstitutional, especially in the election context where voters have a strong interest \nin participation in elections.\"); Miller v. Davis, 2015 WL 9460311, at *2 (B.D. Ky. Sep. 23, 2015) \n(\"If the Court granted Davis' Motion to Stay at this juncture, it would essentially allow her to \nreinstate her 'no marriage licenses' policy during the pendency of the appeal and likely violate the \nconstitutional rights of eligible couples.\"); Am. Civil Liberties Union Fund ofM  ich. v. Livingston \nCty., 2014 WL 12662064, at *2 (E.D. Mich. May 27, 2014) (\"The court is also satisfied that in \nbalancing the potential harms that may result in denial of this motion to stay, any claim of harm \nby [d]efendants is made less compelling by the fact that defendants' actions likely infringe the \nconstitutional rights of the inmates within their control.\").  After carefully considering the parties' \narguments in light of the extensive record, the Court declared that elements of Defendants' orders \nviolated the rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Constitution is the \nlaw of the land and protects the rights of all citizens.  The public interest would be ill served if the \nCourt would grant a stay allowing the unconstitutional measures to remain in place. \nIII.  CONCLUSION AND ORDER OF COURT \nAND NOW, this 22nd day of September 2020, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants' \nMotion to Stay (ECF No. 84). \nBY THE COURT: \n21u \n~ ~~v: \nWILLIAM S.

Skyview Drive-In, LLC, is a Pennsylvania Limited Liability Company, with an\naddress of P.O. Box 351, Carmichaels, Pennsylvania, 15320.\n22. Defendant Governor Thomas W. Wolf, named in his official capacity (โDefendant\nWolfโ), is the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is generally charged with\nenforcing the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and issued Executive Orders on March\n19, 2020, March 20, 2020, and easing up guidance on May 1, 2020.\n23. Defendant Rachel Levine, MD, named in her official capacity (โDefendant Levineโ),\nis the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Health and is generally\ncharged with enforcing the laws regarding the public health of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\nand its residents, including the COVID-19 Closure Orders at issue in this case. \nFACTS\n24. On March 19, 2020, Defendant Wolf and Defendant  Levine issued an Executive Order\nwhich prohibited the operation of all but โlife sustainingโ businesses throughout the Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania (โBusiness Shutdown Orderโ). A copy of the Business Shutdown Order is attached\nhereto as Exhibit โAโ.  The Defendants Wolf, Levine, and the Secretary of the Department of\nCommunity and Economic Development, Dennis M. Davin, have all issued Orders which are in their\npossession or have been posted to the websites of the Governorโs Office and the Office of the\nSecretary of Health and the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic\nDevelopment, all of which said Orders are in the possession of said Defendants and have been widely\ncirculated and are incorporated herein by reference thereto insofar as they are relevant to the facts set\nforth in this Complaint.\n-5-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 6 of 25\n25. Defendant  Wolf purported to rely upon several different sources, all contained in the\nBusiness Shutdown Order, in an effort to justify the action that he took in ordering the shutdown.\n26. Defendant Wolf, as set forth in the Business Shutdown Order, declared the ability to\ncontrol the movement of residents of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and to order that citizens\nof the Commonwealth not utilize their private property, without providing the citizens prior notice nor\nan opportunity to be heard, and without providing just compensation.\n27. The Business Shutdown Order also purports to delegate to Defendant Levine the\nauthority โto determine and employ the most efficient and practical means for the prevention and\nsuppression of disease . . . includ[ing] isolation, quarantine, and any other control measure needed.โ\n28. The Business Shutdown Order prohibited businesses that Defendant Wolf determined\nwere not โlife sustainingโ from operation at their physical locations. The Business Shutdown Order\nprovided, in part, โNo person or entity shall operate a place of business in the Commonwealth that\nis not a life sustaining business regardless of whether the business is open to members of the public.โ\n29. The Business Shutdown Order contained a list of businesses that Defendant Wolf\ndetermined were โlife sustaining.โ Defendant Wolf issued a revised list on March 20, 2020, and\nsubsequent revised lists.\n30. A business operating out of compliance of the Business Shutdown Order is subject\nto fines and penalties, and possible police action, including denial of government assistance and\ndisaster relief.\n31. The Business Shutdown Order did not provide for compensation to the affected\nbusiness owners as a result of Defendant Wolfโs Business Shutdown Order.\n-6-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 7 of 25\n32. The Business Shutdown Order did not provide for prior notice and an opportunity to\nbe heard relative to the mandated shutdown.\n33. On  May  1,  2020,  Defendant Wolf  announced  a  plan  to  begin  reopening  the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania (the โPlanโ).\n34. Defendant Wolfโs Plan involves a phased reopening of Pennsylvania, based upon a\nvariety of factors, but such Plan violates several provisions of the United States Constitution, as set\nforth herein.\n35. The County of Butler is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\nand is generally responsible for the governmental operation in its geographic area, including but not\nlimited to operations related to the health, safety, welfare, and economic well-being of its residents.\n36. The  County  of  Fayette  is  a  political  subdivision  of  the  Commonwealth  of\nPennsylvania and is generally responsible for the governmental operation its geographic area,\nincluding but not limited to operations related to the health, safety, welfare, and economic well-being\nof its residents.\n37. The  County  of  Greene  is  a  political  subdivision  of  the  Commonwealth  of\nPennsylvania and is generally responsible for the governmental operation in its geographic area,\nincluding but not limited to operations related to the health, safety, welfare, and economic well-being\nof its residents.\n38. The County of Washington is a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania and is generally responsible for the governmental operation in its geographic area,\nincluding but not limited to operations related to the health, safety, welfare, and economic well-being\nof its residents.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 8 of 25\n39. Plaintiffs Nancy Gifford and Mike Gifford operate a small hairstyling business\nlocated in Butler County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Although Plaintiffโs business is located\nwithin Butler County, many of Plaintiffโs customers and/or employees reside outside of Butler\nCounty. The Business Shutdown Order issued by Governor Wolf, under the color of state law,\ncontinued to restrict such Plaintiffsโ right to operate their business partly based upon the geographic\nlocation of the business, e.g. Butler County.\n40. Prima Capelli, Inc., operates a small hairstyling business located in Butler County,\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. Although Plaintiffโs business is located within Butler County,\nmany of Plaintiffโs customers and/or employees reside outside of Butler County. The Business\nShutdown Order issued by Governor Wolf, under the color of state law, continued to restrict such\nPlaintiffโs right to operate its business partly based upon the geographic location of its business, e.g.\nButler County.\n41. Honorable Mike Kelly, a member of Congress, is a candidate for re-election and is\naffected by the Orders aforesaid in that the Governor has prohibited door to door campaigning,\ncampaign rallies and other Constitutionally protected activities related thereto.\n42. Honorable Marci Mustello, a member of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania House\nof Representatives, is a candidate for re-election and is affected by the Orders aforesaid in that the\nGovernor has prohibited door to door campaigning, campaign rallies and other Constitutionally\nprotected activities related thereto.\n-8-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 9 of 25\n43. Honorable Daryl Metcalfe, a member of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania House\nof Representatives, is a candidate for re-election and is affected by the Orders aforesaid in that the\nGovernor has prohibited door to door campaigning, campaign rallies and other Constitutionally\nprotected activities related thereto.\n44. Honorable Tim Bonner, a member of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania House of\nRepresentatives, is a candidate for re-election and is affected by the Orders aforesaid in that the\nGovernor has prohibited door to door campaigning, campaign allies, and other Constitutionally\nprotected activities related thereto.\n45. Steven Schoeffel operates a small horse training and racing business located in Butler\nCounty, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and races at The Meadows in Washington County,\nPennsylvania.  Although Plaintiffโs business is located within Butler County, many of Plaintiffโs\ncustomers and/or employees reside outside of Butler County. The Business Shutdown Order\nGovernor Wolf issued, under the color of state law, continued to restrict such Plaintiffโs right to\noperate his business by virtue of the Governor closing all race tracks.\n46. Paul F. Crawford, t/d/b/a Marigold Farm, is a small market garden business that\noffers produce and seedlings to its customers.  Although Plaintiffโs business is located within\nWashington County, many of Plaintiffโs customers and/or employees reside outside of Washington\nCounty.  The Business Shutdown Order issued by Governor Wolf, under the color of state law,\ncontinues to restrict such Plaintiffโs right to operate his business partly based upon the geographic\nlocation of its business; e.g., Washington County, insofar as the Washington County Farmers Market\nwhere Mr. Crawford sells his goods was closed by virtue of said actions of the Governor and the\nDefendants.\n-9-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 10 of 25\n47. Cathy Hoskins operates a small hairstyling business known as Classy Cuts Hair Salon\nlocated in Greene County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Although Plaintiffโs business is located\nwithin Greene County, many of Plaintiffโs customers and/or employees reside outside of Greene\nCounty.  The Business Shutdown Order issued by Governor Wolf, under the color of state law,\ncontinues to restrict such Plaintiffโs right to operate her business partly based upon the geographic\nlocation of its business; e.g., Greene County.\n48. R. W. McDonald & Sons, Inc., a Pennsylvania Corporation, operates a furniture and\nsmall appliance store in Butler County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Although Plaintiffโs\nbusiness is located within Butler County, many of Plaintiffโs customers and/or employees reside\noutside of Butler County.  The Business Shutdown Order issued by Governor Wolf, under the color\nof state law, continues to restrict such Plaintiffโs right to operate its business partly based upon the\ngeographic location of its business; e.g., Butler County.\n49. Starlight Drive-In, Inc., is a Pennsylvania Corporation, operating a drive-in theater\nin Butler County, Pennsylvania.  The owners of the Starlight Drive-In, Inc., were denied the right\nto permit local churches to deliver Easter and Passover services at the drive-in theater.  However,\nthe said drive-in theater was advised that schools could hold graduation services at the drive-in\ntheater.  Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit โBโ is a letter from Ali Doyle of the Office of the\nGovernor. \n50. Skyview DriveIn, LLC, is a Pennsylvania Limited Liability Company, operating a\ndrive-in theater in Carmichaels, Greene County, Pennsylvania, and engaged in showing drive-in\nmovies as well as serving food, such as ice cream and pizza.  The drive-in theater is located across\nthe street from a Dairy Queen drive-in which was authorized to remain open and a pizza restaurant\n-10-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 11 of 25\nwhich likewise was authorized to remain open albeit on a limited basis.  At the same time, the Drive-\nIn theater was not permitted to be open whatsoever and was the recipient of disparate treatment as\nwell as the other constitutional violations asserted.\n51. In  an  arbitrary  and  capricious  manner,  Defendant  Wolf  has  issued  guidance\nconcerning an easing of stay at home restrictions for certain counties, which is inconsistent with  the\navailable statistical data and health precautions recommended by the United States Center for\nDisease Control (CDC).\n52. According to Defendant Wolf, Lawrence County, Mercer County, Venango County,\nand Clarion County, all of which border Butler County, are all to go โyellowโ, meaning an easing\nup of the stay at home restrictions.  It is clear that the Coronavirus does not stop at or respect\narbitrary boundaries such as County dividing lines.  Further, it is likewise clear that the virus does\nnot stop at State lines.  The County of Greene directly borders the State of West Virginia, which is\noperating under completely different rules and is widely reported to be operational.  The County of\nWashington, likewise, is in the immediate proximity of both the States of Ohio and West Virginia,\nand its citizens travel to and from said States for business, shopping, and necessities.  The edicts of\nthe Governor and Secretary of Health have no relation to nor bearing upon the conduct of business,\nliberty, and other constitutional rights with respect to the citizens of these counties when entering\ninto the States of Ohio and West Virginia.  That likewise the Plaintiffs, Paul F. Crawford and Cathy\nHoskins, are similarly affected due to their location in the Counties of Washington and Greene,\nrespectively.\n53. Plaintiffs Gifford, Prima Capelli, Schoeffel, Crawford, Hoskins, and R.W. McDonald\n& Sons, Inc.โs, Starlight Drive-In, Inc., and Skyview DriveIn, LLC, business operations are\n-11-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 12 of 25\nconsistent  with  similar  businesses  located  in  other  counties  within  the  Commonwealth  of\nPennsylvania, such as, Clarion, Mercer, and Lawrence Counties.\n54. However, Defendants Wolf and Levine will continue to prohibit the Plaintiffs from\noperating their businesses while permitting other similar businesses to operate in other counties\nwithin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and, in fact, allows competitor businesses to operate\nwithin the same zone.\n55. These Plaintiffs can implement the same safety precautions, policies and procedures\nthat similar businesses located inside or outside of Butler County, Fayette County, Greene County,\nor Washington County will be permitted to implement in order to resume business operations.\n56. The Business Shutdown Order issued by Defendants Wolf and Levine have been\nissued pursuant to their alleged authority as Governor and Secretary of Health under Pennsylvaniaโs\nEmergency Code, 35 P.S. 7301, et. seq. These Orders have not restricted or prohibited travel\nbetween counties within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Likewise, the actions of Secretary\nDavin are taken under alleged color of law and all of said Orders are enforced by the exercise of his\npolice powers by the Governor and the Secretary of Health through the Pennsylvania State Police\nand other agents of the Commonwealth.  In addition, the Governor apparently intends to exercise\nsuspects rights to โtraceโ or โtrackโ citizens of this Commonwealth by the use of Commonwealth\nemployees and to record and make a record of the whereabouts of Pennsylvanians in violation of\ntheir constitutional rights.\n-12-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 13 of 25\n57. These Plaintiffs have invested a tremendous amount of financial resources, time and\neffort into all aspects of their businesses, including, but not limited to, the purchase or lease of\nequipment, inventory and physical business facilities; advertising; training and hiring of employees;\nand, customer development, as well as other expenses such as rent or mortgage payments.\n58. In an arbitrary and capricious manner, Defendant Wolf, Defendant Levine, as well\nas Secretary Davin, have expressed an intention to deprive these Plaintiffs of the economic benefits\nand use of their property while permitting similar businesses to operate and compete against these\nPlaintiffsโ business.  \n59. Defendantsโ Orders have so deprived these Plaintiffs of the economic benefits and\nuse of their property that the resulting financial impact will adversely impact these Plaintiffsโ\nbusiness for an indefinite period and, unless immediately rescinded, threaten the future viability and\nsustainability of the businesses.\n60. There is no reasonable or substantial basis between Defendantsโ Orders permitting one\nbusiness to operate in a county while prohibiting a similar business from operating in an adjacent\ncounty (or even within the same county) when both businesses are capable of implementing the same\nsafety precautions, policies and procedures; are serving customers from multiple counties, including\nButler County, Fayette County, Greene County, and Washington County; are located within a short\ndistance of each other; and, are separated solely by the geographic county-lines established within the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n61. These Plaintiffs should not be forced to endure the destruction of their businesses\nwhile they are obligated to prove that Defendant Wolf and Defendant Levine have taken these\nPlaintiffsโ private property without the payment of just compensation in violation of the Fifth\nAmendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n-13-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 14 of 25\n62. Defendants have taken Plaintiffโs private property without due process of law.\n63. Plaintiffs County of Butler, County of Fayette, County of Greene, and County of\nWashington have standing in this action for the following reasons:\na. they have an actual injury in that they are not permitted to hold public\nmeetings in which all residents of the County may attend and be heard on\nimportant issues of the day;\nb. all counties will suffer a substantial loss;\nc. their interest is concrete and particularized in that the injury set forth herein\nabove is actual and ongoing;\nd. the Governorโs Orders, and guidance relative to the easing of the stay at\nhome restrictions, have directly caused Plaintiffs Butler County, Fayette\nCounty,  Greene  County,  and  Washington  County  to  suffer  the  harm\ncomplained of herein; and,\ne. the  remedy  requested  herein  will  be  directly  redressed by  a  favorable\ndecision. Taliaferro v. Darby Township Zoning Board, F.3d 181 (3d Cir.\n2006).\n64. Plaintiffs County of Butler, County of Fayette, County of Greene, and County of\nWashington have been damaged by the Defendantsโ Business Shutdown Order because of the impact\nto tax revenue, and reputation, and the impact upon their citizens as aforesaid.  Such citizens have\nno access to lawyers or law offices which are likewise closed and rely upon the Counties to protect\ntheir interests stated herein.\n65. Plaintiffs, Mike Kelly, Marci Mustello, Daryl Metcalfe, and Tim Bonner, have\nstanding in this action for the following reasons:\n-14-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 15 of 25\na. Mike Kelly is a United States Representative and Marci Mustello, Daryl\nMetcalfe,  and  Tim  Bonner  are  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania\nRepresentatives and as such have an obligation to report to their constituents\non matters of public importance;\nb. They are candidates for re-election to the office that they hold;\nc. They are individuals whose freedom to assemble, including their freedom of\nexpressive assembly, is being violated.\n66. These Plaintiffs have standing because the Defendantsโ Orders have caused the\nshutdown of Plaintiffsโ businesses and caused severe financial hardship and loss of the ownersโ\nlivelihood and use of property.\nCOUNT I\nPlaintiffs Gifford, Prima Capelli, Inc., Schoeffel,\nCrawford, Hoskins, and R.W. McDonald & Sons, Inc.,\nStarlight Drive-In, Inc., and Skyview DriveIn, LLC\nv.\nDefendants\nVIOLATION OF THE TAKING CLAUSE - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n67. All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein.\n68. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that private property shall not\nโbe taken for public use, without just compensation.โ U.S. Const. Amend. V.\n69. The Takings Clause generally bars the government from forcing some members of\nthe public from bearing burdens that should be borne by the public as a whole.\n-15-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 16 of 25\n70. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through Governor Wolfโs Business Shutdown\nOrder, took property from member of the public, and from some of the Plaintiffs herein, without just\ncompensation.\n71. The taking occasioned by the Business Shutdown Order worked to prohibit the use\nof citizensโ property and, therefore, caused a diminution or loss in value of that property.\n72. The taking in this case was so onerous as to work as a direct appropriation of the\nproperty.\n73. Property and business owners who were forced to close their businesses suffered a\ntaking  and  were,  therefore,  obligated  to  bear  the  cost  of  government  action  without  just\ncompensation.\n74. The Business Shutdown Order worked to deprive numerous residents, including \nsome of the Plaintiffs herein, of their property interests.\nCOUNT II\nPlaintiffs Gifford, Prima Capelli, Schoeffel,\nCrawford, Hoskins, and R.W.

The March 19, 2020, Business Shutdown Order compelled the closure of the physical\noperations of all business and entities that the Governor deemed to be non-life-sustaining, and\nthreatened criminal prosecution for those who violate the Executive Order.\n-16-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 17 of 25\n77. Governor Wolf established a waiver process to be administered by the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Community and Economic Development (DCED) though which businesses and\nentities could apply for a waiver to be excluded from the Governorโs list of non-life-sustaining\nbusinesses.\n78. On Wednesday, April 1, 2020, the DCED announced that it would cease accepting\napplications for waivers filed after 5:00 PM on April 3, 2020.\n79. In the approximate two-week time period that the DCED was accepting applications\nfor waiver from Defendant Wolfโs list of non-life-sustaining businesses, the DCED received some\n42,380 applications.\n80. Thousands of waivers have been denied or gone unanswered without hearing and no\nappeals process has been provided for.  Further, DCED erred in their initial determinations as to\nwhat were non-life-sustaining businesses having granted in excess of 7,000 waivers and having also\nchanged industry designations after the Business Shutdown Order became effective.  Evidence of\nthe arbitrary and capricious nature of these decisions (or the simply inappropriate nature of these\ndecisions) can readily be seen with respect to the waiver granted by the Governor and/or Secretary\nDavin to the Governorโs own family-owned business, Wolf Home Products, which was granted a\nwaiver, which waiver was revoked after the waiver was widely publicized in newspapers of general\ncirculation in this Commonwealth, and which business thereafter continued to operate despite the\nrescinding of said waiver following great publicity regarding the same.\n81. On April 24, 2020, Defendants announced a phased reopening plan using a three-\nphase matrix and announced that the Business Shutdown Order would be relaxed in some counties\nwithin the Commonwealth, not including Plaintiffsโ counties, beginning May 8, 2020 (the โApril\nAnnouncementโ).\n-17-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 18 of 25\n82. Four of Butler Countyโs neighboring Counties with similar population characteristics\nwill be allowed to partially reopen as of May 8, 2020, but the Counties cannot reopen as the\nBusiness Shutdown Order will remain in effect.  Further, as previously stated, the States of West\nVirginia and Ohio either border or are in proximity to the Counties of Greene and Washington and\nhave either reopened completely or have reopened in a disparate manner with respect to the rights\nof the citizens of said counties in Pennsylvania.\n83.   The Governor announced he is partnering with Carnegie Mellon University to create\na data-driven tool to aid in decisions to reopen counties.\n84. The Defendants do not set forth with particularity what factors are considered, and\nprovide citizens no means to challenge or appeal the Governorโs decision.\n85. The Defendantsโ classification of what counties may reopen on May 8, 2020, is\narbitrary and capricious.\n86. The Plaintiffs have a protected liberty interest in their right to live without arbitrary\ngovernmental interference.\n87. The Plaintiffs have a right to protection from arbitrary action of the government.\n88. Substantive Due Process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that\nโshocks the consciousโ or that interferes with the concept of ordered liberty.\n89. The Business Shutdown Order, and the April Guidelines issued by Defendants,\nconstitute arbitrary, capricious, irrational and abusive conduct that interferes with Plaintiffsโ liberty\nand property interests protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution.\n-18-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 19 of 25\n90.

The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids a state from\ndepriving anyone of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n96. None of the following due process protections have been afforded to Plaintiffs, or any\ncitizen of Butler County, Fayette County, Greene County, or Washington County as required by the\nUnited States Constitution: \na. the waivers are written and do not permit evaluation by a neutral arbitrator;\nb. the waiver determination does not provide for an opportunity to be heard;\n-19-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 20 of 25\nc. the waiver determination does not offer an opportunity to present witnesses;\nd. the waiver determination does not permit an opportunity to cross examine\nwitnesses;\ne. the waiver determination does not provide for a reasoned decision; and,\nf. the waiver determination does not provide for an opportunity for an appeal.\n97. The Business Shutdown Order, and subsequent April guidance on easing of the stay\nat home Order provided by Defendants, do not provide due process protections set forth herein.  The\nDefendants shut down of the appeal process with the DCED, without any explanation, which\nconstitutes an unexplained inconsistency and is arbitrary and capricious. \n98. All fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty, including, but not limited\nto, the rights to be free from bodily restraint, the right to contract and engage in the common\noccupations of life, the right to acquire useful knowledge, to worship God according to the dictates\nof ones own conscience, and to generally enjoy the privileges long associated with the rights of free\npeople are guaranteed substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n99. The Governor did permit citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to request\nan exemption to the closure orders through a waiver form.\n100. The waiver requests, however, do not comply with due process requirements in that:\na. the waivers are written and do not permit evaluation by a neutral arbitrator;\nb. the waiver determination does not provide for an opportunity to be heard;\nc. the waiver determination does not offer an opportunity to present witnesses;\n-20-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 21 of 25\nd.

The Business Shutdown Order deprives Plaintiffs, and residents of the Counties of\nButler, Fayette, Greene, and Washington of fundamental property rights without due process of law,\nbased solely upon discretion of Defendants, which discretion is not subject to appeal rights.\nCOUNT IV \nPlaintiffs \nv. \nDefendants\nVIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n102. All previous paragraphs are incorporated herein.\n103. The Equal Protection Clause requires governments to act in a rational and non-\narbitrary fashion.\n104. Defendantsโ actions in classifying businesses into โlife-sustainingโ and โnon-life-\nsustainingโ are arbitrary and irrational given that there has never been such a classification of\nbusiness activity and the Defendantsโ attempts to classify such categories is nothing more than ipse\ndixit.\n-21-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 22 of 25\n105. Defendantsโ actions are therefore a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n106. On May 1, 2020, Governor Wolf announced plans to begin easing stay at home\nrestrictions previously implemented. Said plan would ease the restrictions on some counties, and\nnot others.\n 107. The easing of restrictions in some counties, and not in other counties, is not rational\nand is an arbitrary exercise of Defendant Wolfโs executive power.\n108. The Defendantsโ plan is nothing more than an arbitrary decision-making tool that\nrelies on the speculations of the Defendants.\n109. Defendantsโ decision not to ease stay at home restrictions on all counties impedes\nPlaintiffsโ fundamental right to use their private property without the government imposing arbitrary\nor irrational restrictions on the use of the property.\n110. Defendantsโ actions will cause Plaintiffs to be completely deprived of the use and\ncontrol of their private property while businesses in other counties will be authorized to operate.\n111. As such, Defendantsโ intention to not ease the stay at home Order for the County of\nButler, County of Fayette, County of Greene, and the County of Washington, but to ease the stay at\nhome Order for other similarly situated Counties, will continue to cause harm to Butler County,\nFayette County, Greene County, and Washington County, and the residents thereof, as they will be\nprohibited from operating their businesses pursuant to the Governorโs Business Shutdown Order.\n-22-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 23 of 25\nCOUNT V\nPlaintiffs\nv.\nDefendants\nVIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n112.

The restrictions contained in the Business Shutdown Order limit public gatherings\nto ten (10) people, and in the next โphaseโ, twenty-five (25) people.\n114. The First Amendment provides protection for freedom of association in the context\nof expressive association.\n115. Expressive association includes, but may not be limited to, speech, assembly, press,\npetitioning government for grievances, and the free exercise of religion.\n116. The County of Butler, County of Fayette, County of Greene, and the County of\nWashington all hold, and are obligated to hold, public meetings in which the public is invited to\nattend, and does attend, almost always in numbers of more than ten (10) or twenty-five (25) people.\n117. Political representatives, and candidates for political office, often hold meetings,\ngatherings, town hall discussions, and similar events, in order to discuss matters of general\nimportance, including matters concerning the health, safety, and welfare of members of the\ncommunity.\n-23-\n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 1   Filed 05/07/20   Page 24 of 25\n118. Defendantsโ Business Shutdown Order limiting the number of individuals at public\ngatherings violates the freedom of association clause inasmuch as expressive advocacy cannot take\nplace because of the Business Shutdown Order, and it affects persons who pose no danger\nwhatsoever to others.\n119. Attending such events, such as political gatherings, public meetings, or similar events\nis a right protected by the First Amendment and is directly and completely prohibited and/or\ncurtailed by the Business Shutdown Order.\n120. It is of no moment that one might be able to attend these functions via technological\ntools such as video or audio conference, as not all citizens have access to or own such technology.\n121.

Hon. William S. Stickman IV \nTHOMAS W. WOLF, et al, \nDefendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER OF COURT \nWILLIAMS. STICKMAN IV, United States District Judge \nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Speedy Hearing of Declaratory Judgment Action Pursuant to \nRule 57 (ECF No.9).  Defendants filed a Response and Brief in Opposition opposing the request \nfor a speedy hearing.  (ECF Nos.  12 and 13).  On May 27, 2020, the Court conducted oral \nargument on Plaintiffs' Motion.  After carefully considering the parties' arguments, Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure  57  ~d interpreting  caselaw,  the  Court hereby  GRANTS  IN PART and \nDENIES IN PART Plaintiffs'  Motion for a Speedy Hearing consistent with the guidance set \nforth herein. \nI.  PROCEDURAL IDSTORY \nOn May 7, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment \nthat  Governor  Thomas  W.  Wolf (\"Governor\")  and  the  other  Defendants  violated  certain \nconstitutional rights through the issuance of executive orders designed to combat the COVID-19 \npandemic.  Plaintiffs are comprised of four counties located in Western Pennsylvania, a number \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 2 of 12\nof businesses located in those counties, and individuals who are business owners and elected \nofficials.  The Complaint asserts five counts, which are as follows: \nI.  Violation Of The Taking Clause-42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; \nII.  Substantive Due Process-42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; \nIII.  Procedural Due Process-42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; \nIV.  Violation Of Equal Protection-42 U.S. C. ยง 1983; \nv.  Violation Of First Amendment-42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n(ECF No. 1). \nCount  I  is  asserted  by  Plaintiffs  Gifford,  Prima  Capelli,  Inc.,  Schoeffel,  Crawford, \nHoskins, R.W. McDonald & Sons, Inc.,  Starlight Drive-In, Inc., and Skyview Drivein, LLC. \nThey argue that the Governor's business shutdown order was so onerous as to effectuate a taking \nof their businesses without just compensation. \nCount II is asserted on behalf of Plaintiffs Gifford, Prima Capelli, Schoeffel, Crawford, \nHoskins, R.W. McDonald &  Sons, Inc.,  Starlight Drive-In, Inc.,  and Skyview Drivein, LLC. \nThese Plaintiffs argue that the Governor's decision to compel the closure of\"non-life sustaining\" \nbusinesses was arbitrary, capricious and interfered with \"the concept of ordered liberty.\"  This \nCount  also  asserts  that  the  Governor's  orders  interfere  with  their  \"right  to  pursue  lawful \nemployment as they shall determine and be free of governmental interference.\"  Lastly, Count II \nraises issues with the manner in which Defendants operated a waiver program whereby a \"non \nlife sustaining\" business could receive permission to continue operating. \nCount III, asserted by Plaintiffs Gifford, Prima Capelli, Schoeffel, Crawford, Hoskins, \nR.W. McDonald & Sons, Inc., Starlight Drive-In, Inc., and Skyview Drivein, LLC, focuses on \nthe waiver process, alleging that it violated their right to procedural due process.  In short, the \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 3 of 12\nclaim alleges that the process of obtaining a waiver was unfair, not transparent and lacked any \nfair procedure governing the application for a waiver or recourse to challenge the denial of a \nwaiver.  Plaintiffs further assert that the process was completely arbitrary and subject solely to \nthe discretion of Defendants.  Importantly, Plaintiffs plead, and the parties confirmed during oral \nargument, that the waiver process is closed, and no new waivers are being granted. \nCount IV is brought by all Plaintiffs.  It argues that Defendants have violated their right \nto equal protection in two ways.  First, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' classification of some \nbusinesses as \"life sustaining\" and others as \"non-life sustaining\" was arbitrary and mere ipse \ndixit.  Second, Plaintiffs contend that in the course of Defendants re-opening plan, similarly \nsituated counties and, by extension, their residents, have been arbitrarily treated unequally-with \nsome being able to move to the \"yellow\" phase before similarly situated counties.  At argument, \nPlaintiffs noted that the same unequal phasing is occurring as some counties move to the \"green\" \nphase. \nCount V, brought by all Plaintiffs, raises violations of multiple liberties guaranteed by the \nFirst  Amendment.  Plaintiffs  assert  that  the  limitations  on  public  gatherings  imposed  by \nDefendants violate their right of assembly, freedom of association and free exercise of religion. \nSpecifically, they argue that the limitations on the size of assemblies-present at all stages of the \nDefendants' plan-impose an undue burden on their rights to hold and attend public meetings, \nreligious  worship,  political  events  and  other  gatherings.  Plaintiffs  also  reject  Defendants' \ncontention that the availability of certain alternative electronic means of communication facially \nprecludes  any  claim  of constitutional  violations  arising  out  of curtailing  actual  physical \ngathering. \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 4 of 12\nOn May 20, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their Motion for an expedited hearing under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 57.  Defendants filed their Response on May 26, 2020.  Telephonic oral \nargument was held on May 27, 2020.  The narrow question of whether it is appropriate for this \nCourt to expedite determination of Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief is ripe for review. \nIT.  ANALYSIS \nA)  The Court has broad discretion to expedite review of an  action under \nRule 57. \nThe Court has broad discretion to determine whether some or all of Plaintiffs' requests \nfor declaratory judgment should be entertained in an expedited fashion.1  Rule 57 provides, in \nrelevant part, that \"[t]he court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory judgment action.\" \nBeyond the general warrant for a district court to permit a speedy hearing, the rule does not \nprovide specific guidance as to the circumstances in which an expedited proceeding will be \nappropriate.  However, district courts have universally held that they have \"broad discretion\" in \ndeciding whether expedited proceedings are warranted and that this discretion stems from their \n\"inherent authority to manage their dockets and courtrooms with a view toward the efficient and \nexpedient resolution of cases.\"  Walsh/Granite JV v. HDR Engineering, Inc., 2018 WL 102283 91 \n(W.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2018).  See also Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc.  v. \nBNSF Railway Co.,  2008 WL 2465407 (D.  Ariz.  June 17, 2008) (\"[I]t is within the Court's \ndiscretion to order a speedy hearing on Plaintiffs' declaratory judgment claim.\"). \nDistrict courts have looked to various  factors  when considering whether to  expedite \nproceedings  under  Rule  57.  For  example,  they  have  considered  whether  expediting \ndetermination of the requested declaratory judgment \"will streamline  and narrow issues for \n1  A  district court has the discretion to  exercise jurisdiction over a request for  declaratory \njudgment on an issue by issue basis.  Henglein v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 260 F.3d 201, \n210-11 (3d Cir. 2001). \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 5 of 12\ndiscovery and trial, even if it will not entirely resolve the controversy.\"  Walsh/Granite JV, at *1; \nAllergan v.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals Int., Inc., 2014 WL 4181457, *3 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 21, 2014) \n(\"One factor that a district court may consider is whether declaratory judgment would 'terminate \nthe controversy'  or at least substantially narrow the issues.\" (citations omitted)).  Expedited \nproceedings on a motion for declaratory judgment are appropriate where the determination is \nlargely one of law, and factual issues (while expedited discovery is permitted and frequently \ngranted)  are not predominant.  See Summary proceeding and speedy hearing of declaratory \njudgment action, 10 Fed. Proc. L. Ed. ยง23:56 (2020).  Finally, as with requests for preliminary \ninjunctive relief, expedited proceedings are especially warranted where there areยท imminent or \nongoing violations of important rights.  See County ofM  orris v. Nationalist Movement, 273 F .3d \n527 (3d. Cir. 2001). \nA request for declaratory relief is not an appropriate avenue to challenge violations of \nrights that have already occurred.  Corliss v.  Obrien, 200 Fed. Appx. 80 (3d. Cir. 2006).  \"Nor is \ndeclaratory judgment meant simply to proclaim that one party is liable to another.\"  !d. at 84-5. \nSee also ACLU of Massachusetts v.  United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 705 F.3d 44, \n53 (1st Cir. 2013) (\"With limited exceptions, not present here, issuance of a declaratory judgment \ndeeming past conduct illegal is not permissible as it would be merely advisory.\").  The remedy \nfor examining allegations of past violations of constitutional rights and for determining liability \nand damages for the same is a traditional action for damages under 28 U.S.C. ยง1983. \nThe Court applied these considerations as it examined, on a claim by claim basis, whether \nPlaintiffs'  request for  an expedited hearing under Rule  57  is  appropriate.  First,  the  Court \nexamined whether Plaintiffs' claims lend themselves to declaratory relief, in general.  Next the \nCourt explored whether the claims which may lend themselves to declaratory relief should be \n5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 6 of 12\nafforded  an  expedited  hearing.  After  considering  the  allegations  set  forth  in  Plaintiffs' \nComplaint  and  the  parties'  respective  arguments  in  relation  to  the  request  for  expedited \nproceedings, the Court holds that expedited determination is warranted under Rule 57 on some, \nbut not all, of the claims for declaratory relief asserted in the Complaint. \nB) As an initial matter, the movement of the counties where Plaintiffs reside or \nconduct business from  \"red\" to  \"yellow\" has not rendered their  claims \nmoot. \nAs a threshold issue, Defendants suggested that many, if not all, of Plaintiffs' claims have \nbeen rendered moot by the movement, post-Complaint, of the counties where they reside or \nconduct business from the \"red\" to the  \"yellow\" classification phase of the Governor's re-\nopening plan.  They also argue that future, perhaps imminent, movement to the \"green\" phase \nwill certainly render moot whichever claims remain.  Plaintiffs contend that none of their claims \nrelating to  the  closure  of businesses  have  been rendered moot by their respective  counties \nmoving from the \"red\" phase to the \"yellow\" phase because of continuing restrictions.  For \nexample,  even under the  \"yellow\" phase  of re-opening,  Plaintiffs  in the  personal  care  and \nentertainment sectors remain closed or under severe restriction.  Indeed, Plaintiffs argue, and \nDefendants conceded during oral argument, that restrictions will remain even after their counties \nmove into the \"green\" phase. \nAfter carefully reviewing the allegations in the Complaint, the Court holds that merely \nmoving from one phase to another, less restrictive phase, will not automatically render moot \nPlaintiffs' claims relating to the business shutdown or re-opening requirements, nor will it moot \ntheir  First  Amendment  claims.  To  the  extent that  Plaintiffs  can plausibly  assert  that the \ncontinuing restrictions infringe upon protected liberties, they may continue to pursue declaratory \nrelief. \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 7 of 12\nC)  Declaratory relief is not an  appropriate avenue to  examine Plaintiffs' \nFifth Amendment taking claims. \nCount I of the Complaint claims that the Governor's business shutdown order was, and is, \nsuch a substantial interference with Plaintiffs' businesses that it constitutes a taking without just \ncompensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  While this issue may present a continuing \nviolation of Plaintiffs'  constitutional rights,  the  Court will nevertheless  decline to  review it \nthrough declaratory judgment proceedings. \nIn Knick v.  Township  of Scott,  Pennsylvania,  ---U.S.---,  139  S.Ct.  2162  (2019),  the \nSupreme Court held that plaintiffs may bring a takings claim for an illegal taking in federal court \nbefore  first  exhausting  state  remedies.  Under  the  Supreme  Court's  recalibration  of its \njurisprudence on the procedural posture of takings claims, \"a property owner has a claim for a \nviolation of the Takings Clause as soon as a government takes his property for public use without \npaying for it.\"  Id. at 2167.  This would, ostensibly, also apply to claims raising something like a \nregulatory taking, as the Complaint seems to assert.  But, the Supreme Court's decision expressly \ndisclaimed any possibility that a plaintiff could seek injunctive relief to prevent a taking, rather \nthan  a  claim for  just compensation.  Chief Justice  Roberts,  writing  for  the  Court,  stated: \n\"Governments  need  not  fear  that  our  holding  will  lead  federal  courts  to  invalidate  their \nregulations as unconstitutional.  As long as just compensation remedies are available-as they \nhave been for nearly 150 years-injunctive relief will be foreclosed.\"  Id. at 2179. \nHere, the declaratory relief sought by Plaintiffs-that the Governor's business shutdown \norders effectuated an unconstitutional taking-would be the functional equivalent of injunctive \nrelief.  The Supreme Court's decision in Knick forecloses such relief.  Again, Plaintiffs may have \na remedy for the takings that they allege, but declaratory relief is not the appropriate avenue to \npursue it. \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 8 of 12\nD) Declaratory relief is not appropriate for Plaintiffs' claims challenging \nthe waiver process. \nCount III of the Complaint claims that the process, or lack of process, governing waivers \nfrom the Governor's shutdown order violated their right to procedural due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  The parties agree that the process to request and receive a waiver is \nclosed.  No  new waivers are being granted.  Consequently, this issue is not appropriate for \nreview in a declaratory proceeding. Declaratory relief is simply not an appropriate avenue to \nchallenge violations of rights that have already occurred.  Corliss, supra.  That is what Plaintiffs \nare seeking here- a declaration from the Court that Defendants' prior conduct in the manner in \nwhich they gave, or withheld, waivers violated constitutional rights.  However, those violations \nare  in the past,  even if the damages  incurred from the  denial of a waiver may be ongoing. \nPlaintiffs are not without remedy to  challenge certain aspects of the waiver process.  But, a \ndeclaratory judgment is not the procedural framework to seek that remedy.  The Court will not \nreview the waiver issue through Rule 57. \nE)  Expedited  proceedings  are  appropriate  on  Plaintiffs'  claims  for \ndeclaratory relief challenging violations of their rights under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments. \nAt Counts II, IV and V, Plaintiffs assert existing and ongoing violations of their rights \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  As to the First Amendment, Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants have imposed limitations on gatherings that remain in place (although somewhat \nrelaxed) in the \"yellow\" phase and will continue to exist to some extent even in the \"green\" \nphase.  Plaintiffs  allege  that these  limitations  infringe  on their  First Amendment  rights  of \nassociation, free association and free exercise of religion. \nPlaintiffs also plead that the Governor's business shutdown order continues to deprive \nthem of substantive due process (including an asserted right to earn a living) and equal protection \n8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 9 of 12\nby imposing unconstitutional limitations on their business operations.  They allege that they \nremain  either  shut  down  or  severely  restricted  in their  operations  by  Defendants'  actions. \nFinally, as to the claims under both the First and Fourteenth Amendments, they assert that even \nunder the most relaxed \"green\" phase publicized by the  Governor, they will continue to be \nsubject to restrictions. 2  Thus, Plaintiffs' claims do not merely assert past deprivations of rights, \nbut they allege current and ongoing deprivations of rights.  Declaratory relief is an appropriate \navenue to seek a remedy for the claims asserted by Plaintiffs at Counts II, IV and V. \nHaving  determined  that  declaratory  relief is  an  appropriate  remedy  for  Plaintiffs' \nallegations of existing and ongoing constitutional violations at Counts II, IV and V, the Court \nfurther holds that expedited consideration is warranted as to these claims. The First Amendment \nenshrines the most fundamental  rights  held by a free  people.  Expedited review of alleged \nongoing infringement of those rights is certainly warranted. Moreover, violations of substantive \ndue process and equal protection that interfere with important or fundamental rights, including \nthe right to operate a legitimate business and/or earn a living, are serious deprivations that could, \nas Plaintiffs argue, cause continuing, ongoing and perhaps irreparable harm. Expedited review of \nalleged ongoing infringement of those rights is certainly warranted. 3 \n2  Plaintiffs'  counsel  argued that under the \"green\" phase,  billed as  the  least restrictive  of \nDefendants'  re-opening plan, restrictions will remain on operations  of businesses,  including \nsubstantial limitations  on occupancy.  Restrictions will also remain on public gatherings for \nsocial,  political  and  religious  purposes.  Defendants'  counsel  acknowledged  during  oral \nargument that these restrictions would remain in the \"green\" phase and was unable to identify \nany further phase of re-opening where such restrictions would not exist.  In other words, there is \nno current indication of when and under what standards the citizens of the Commonwealth will \nbe free of restrictions.  Those restrictions may, or may not, constitute violations ofthe Plaintiffs' \nconstitutional rights-that is  a question for  another  day-but there  is  no  question that the \nrestrictions complained of remain in place now and for the foreseeable future. \n3  Unlike proceedings on a request for preliminary injunctive relive, Plaintiffs need not establish \nimmediate  and irreparable injury to justify expedited review under Rule  57.  However, the \n9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 10 of 12\nBeyond the  interest in providing prompt review for the weighty constitutional issues \npresented by the Complaint, expedited review is warranted under the practical considerations, \ndiscussed above, frequently employed by district courts.  At argument, counsel for both sides \nacknowledged that they do not anticipate the need for extensive discovery and may not need any \ndeposition  testimony.  Further,  an  early  determination  of  whether  Defendants'  actions \neffectuated violations of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights could streamline the issues remaining for \nlater  discovery  and  determination.  Counsel  for  Defendants  acknowledged  that  expedited \nexamination of the issues presented by Plaintiffs could dispose of them once and for all. \nFinally, the Court considered whether an expedited determination would cause undue \nprejudice to Defendants and determined that it will not.  The parties agree that an expedited \ndetermination will require only limited discovery,  if any.  Defendants, through counsel,  are \nfamiliar with the issues in this action, have sufficient resources and are more than up to the task. \nWhile this case is distinct, there is overlap with other cases where Defendants and their counsel \nhave been able to mount a more than adequate defense on an even shorter timetable.  While \nDefendants  will  not  be  materially  prejudiced  by  expedited  proceedings,  if Plaintiffs  have \ncorrectly  alleged  constitutional  violations,  they  will  be  unquestionably  prejudiced  if these \nproceedings are not expedited. \npotential for  such harm is a consideration that a district court would be prudent to consider. \nPlaintiffs have argued that they are experiencing immediate and irreparable harm as a result of \nDefendants'  actions.  In addition,  federal  courts have long held that that the  deprivation of \nconstitutional rights-particularly rights enshrined in the First Amendment-is presumed to be \nirreparable.  See Elrod v.  Burns, 427 U.S.  347,  373  (1976) (\"The loss of First Amendment \nfreedoms,  for  even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"); \nTenafly Eruv Ass 'n v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 178 (3d Cir. 2002). \nt'o \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 11 of 12\nIII.  CONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Speedy Hearing of Declaratory Judgment Action Pursuant to Rule \n57  (ECF No.  9)  is  GRANTED  IN  PART  and  DENIED  IN PART.  The  Court holds  that \nexpedited proceedings to examine the claims at Counts II, IV and V of Plaintiffs' Complaint are \nwarranted.  The Court denies the Motion as to Counts I and III. \nHaving made this determination, the question remains as to the manner by which these \nproceedings will be expedited.  Contrary to a request for preliminary injunctive relief, the entry \nof a declaratory judgment is a complete and final order.  See Henglein, 260 F.3d at 211.  As such, \nthe parties are entitled to take the discovery and to create the record needed to support their \nclaims and defenses.  The Court has the authority to streamline, limit and shorten the discovery \nprocess in a manner best suited to the case at hand.  Balancing the need to obtain discovery and \nto create a record with the interest of expediting the proceedings is a process that works best with \ncollaboration between the parties and the Court.  To that end, the Court hereby ORDERS the \nparties to meet and confer on the following topics: \n1)  The type and extent of discovery sought by each party.  To the extent that \ndiscovery is necessary, the Court will issue a case management order with \ncondensed discovery deadlines; \n2)  Whether the parties are willing and able to create a stipulated factual record in \nlieu of discovery; and/or \n3)  Whether the parties prefer to  hold  an in-person evidentiary hearing  or to \nproceed on a record submitted to the court (either a stipulated factual record or \na record comprised of discovery materials  and  other evidence)  along with \nbriefing and oral argument; and, \n4)  Any other issue relating to the expedited management of these proceedings. \nThe parties shall file a Status Report of their meet and confer, outlining points of agreement and \ndisagreement, by Monday, June 1, 2020 at 5:00 p.m.  If necessary, the Court will conduct a \n11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 15   Filed 05/28/20   Page 12 of 12\ntelephonic status conference on Tuesday, June 2, 2020 at 9:30a.m.  The Court will then issue an \norder with expedited deadlines for  all events relating to the examination and adjudication of \nPlaintiffs' claims for declaratory relief at Counts II, IV and V. \nBY THE COURT: \nDated:  May 28, 2020 \nWILLIAM S.

Hon. William S. Stickman IV \nTHOMAS W. WOLF, eta!, \nDefendants. \nOPINION \nWILLIAMS. STICKMAN IV, United States District Judge \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every aspect of American life.  Since the novel \ncoronav irus emerged in late 2019, governments throughout the world have grappled with how \nthey can intervene in a manner that is effective to protect their citizens from getting sick and, \nspecifically,  how they  can protect their healthcare  systems  from  being  overwhelmed by  an \nonslaught of cases, hindering their ability to treat patients suffering from COVID-19 or any other \nemergency  condition.  In this  Country,  founded  on  a tradition  of liberty  enshrined  in our \nConstitution,  governments,  governors,  and  courts  have  grappled  with  how  to  balance  the \nlegitimate authority of public officials in a health emergency with the Constitutional rights of \ncitizens.  In this  case,  the  Court  is  required  to  examine  some  of the  measures  taken  by \nDefendants-Pennsylvania Governor Thomas W.  Wolf and Pennsylvania Secretary of Health \nRachel Levine-to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.  The measures at issue are: (1) \n1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 2 of 66\nthe restrictions on gatherings1; and, (2) the orders closing \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses and \ndirecting Pennsylvanians to stay-at-home. \nAfter  reviewing  the  record  in  this  case,  including  numerous  exhibits  and  witness \ntestimony, the Court believes that Defendants undertook their actions in a well-intentioned effort \nto protect Pennsylvanians from the virus.  However, good intentions toward a laudable end are \nnot alone enough to uphold governmental action against a constitutional challenge.  Indeed, the \ngreatest threats to our system of constitutional liberties may arise when the ends are laudable, \nand the intent is good-especially in a time of emergency.  In an emergency, even a vigilant \npublic may let down its guard over its constitutional liberties only to find that liberties, once \nrelinquished,  are  hard  to  recoup  and  that  restrictions-while  expedient  in the  face  of an \nemergency situation-may persist long after immediate danger has passed.  Thus, in reviewing \nemergency measures, the job of courts is made more difficult by the delicate balancing that they \nmust undertake.  The Court is guided in this balancing by principles of established constitutional \njurisprudence. \nThis action seeks a declaration that Defendants' actions violated and continue to violate \nthe First Amendment, as  well as  both the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses  ~f the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that numeric limitations on the size of \ngatherings violates the First Amendment.  They argue that the components of Defendants' orders \nclosing \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses and requiring Pennsylvanians to stay-at-home violated \nboth the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1 Pursuant to the July 15, 2020 Orders of Defendants, indoor events and gatherings of more than \n25  people  are  prohibited,  and  outdoor  events  and  gatherings  of more than 250  people  are \nprohibited.  (ECF Nos. 48-5, 48-6). \n2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 3 of 66\nTo examine the issues presented by Plaintiffs, the Court first had to determine what type \nof scrutiny should be applied to the constitutional claims.  As explained at length below, the \nCourt believes that ordinary canons of scrutiny are appropriate, rather than a lesser emergency \nregimen.  The Court next had to determine whether the question of the business closure and \nrelated stay-at-home provisions of Defendants' orders remain before it.  The record shows that \nthey do.  The language of the orders themselves, as well as testimony adduced at trial, show that \nthese provisions are merely suspended, not rescinded, and can be re-imposed at Defendants' will. \nThis, in addition to the voluntary cessation doctrine,  compelled the Court to examine issues \nrelating to these components of Defendants' orders. \nHaving addressed the necessary threshold questions, the Court proceeded to the merits of \nPlaintiffs' claims and, after carefully considering the trial record and the parties extensive pre \nand post-trial briefmg holds and declares:  (1) that the congregate gathering limits imposed by \nDefendants' mitigation orders violate the right of assembly enshrined in the First Amendment; \n(2) that the stay-at-home and business closure2  components of Defendants' orders violate the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) that the business closure components \nof Defendants' orders violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nPennsylvania saw its first presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in the early days of \nMarch 2020.  (ECF No. 40, p. 1; ECF No. 37, ,-r 6).  On March 6, 2020, Governor Wolf signed a \nProclamation of Disaster Emergency noting that \"the possible increased threat from COVID-19 \n2 Plaintiffs challenge only the business closure provisions which had designated every business \nin the Commonwealth as \"life-sustaining\" or \"non-life-sustaining\" and closed the later.  They do \nnot challenge components of those orders which permit the businesses to open subject to certain \nrestrictions, such as percentage occupancy limits.  As such, the Court's opinion does not impact \nthose components ofDefendants' orders. \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 4 of 66\nconstitutes a threat of imminent disaster to the health of the citizens of the Commonwealth\" such \nthat it was necessary \"to implement measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.\"  (ECF No. \n42-1). \nThe  Governor's proclamation of a disaster emergency vested him with extraordinary \nauthority to take expansive action by executive order.  Within the Governor's office, a \"group\" \n\"was formed to work on issues related to the pandemic\" both on the \"economic development \nside and pertaining to the business closures\" and \"on the health side, teams were formed to work \nto understand the progress of the pandemic.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 17).3  It was an \"interdisciplinary \nteam\" with \"individuals from the  [G]overnor's office and agencies being pulled together for \nspecific  tasks,\"  including  Secretary  Levine.  (ECF  No.  75,  pp.  17-18).  The  \"group\"  never \nreduced its  purpose to  writing,  although \"its stated purpose was  to  develop  mechanisms to \nrespond to that emerging threat [i.e. a pandemic] in a very quick period of time.\"  (ECF No. 75, \np. 26).  The names of its members remain unknown. \nPart of the \"group\" consisted of a \"reopening team\" and a \"policy team.\"  (ECF No. 75, \npp. 17-21).  None oftheir \"hundreds, if not thousands\" of meetings were open to the public, no \nmeeting minutes were kept, and \"formality was not the first thing on [their] minds.\"  (ECF No. \n75, pp. 21, 26, 28, 30-31, 89-90,  134).  The \"reopening team\" was \"working to develop the \nvarious guidance that was necessary to respond to the pandemic,\" and it \"published that on the \nCommonwealth's website and put out press releases.\"  (ECF No.  75, pp. 27-28, 32).  It also \nformulated the stay-at-home order.  (ECF No. 75, pp. 33-34).  The \"policy team\" was tasked \nwith creating the distinctions between \"life-sustaining\" and \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses as \nwell as preparing responses for the public on frequently asked questions.  (ECF No. 75, pp. 21, \n3  Throughout this Opinion, page citations are to pages of the applicable trial transcripts and \npleadings, and not the ECF document page number. \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 5 of 66\n35).  Its members consisted solely of employees from the Governor's policy and planning office, \nnone of whom possess a medical background or are experts in infection control.  (ECF No. 75, \npp. 22-25, 100-01). \nThe  Governor never attended meetings  of the  various teams,  but he  \"participated in \nregular calls and updates with members of his administration\" and he \"was briefed and consulted \non key matters.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 29).  Ultimately, without ever conducting a formal vote, the \nteams, by consensus when \"there [was] a favorite approach everyone agree[d] on,\" put together \nthe scope of an order and submitted it to the Governor through his Chief of Staff for approval.4 \n(ECF No. 75, pp. 45-47, 96-97).  All of the orders, according to the Governor, were geared \"to \nprotect the public from the novel and completely unprecedented pandemic\" and \"prevent the \nspread of the disease.\"  (ECF No. 75, pp. 136-37).  According to the Executive Deputy Secretary \nfor the Pennsylvania Department of Health, from a public health perspective, the intent of the \norders \"was to reduce the amount of interaction between individuals.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 209; ECF \nNo. 37, ~ 7). \nThe various orders issued by Defendants will be discussed with specificity in the analysis \nthat follows  as they relate to the particular legal issues in this case.  That said,  by way of \nbackground, the Court would note the following relevant events. \n4 For example, in regard to the July 15, 2020 Order that contained a limit of twenty-five percent \nof the stated fire code maximum occupancy for indoor dining, policy team members reviewed \nmodels from other states- Florida, Colorado, Texas, and California- \"and then made a decision \nbased on collective input of the policy folks, the legal folks, the Department of Health and health \nprofessionals as to what would be the best approach to move forward.\"  (ECF No. 74, pp. 49-51). \nAs to the provision in the Order that alcohol could only be served in the same transaction as a \nmeal, \"it was one of the features of the California order that we [i.e. the policy team] did look at \nand thought it made sense.\"  (ECF No. 74, p. 59).  At the end of this process, the proposal for the \nOrder was submitted to the Governor for approval.  (ECF No. 74, p. 51). \n5 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 6 of 66\nOn  March  13,  2020,  the  Governor  announced  a  temporary  closure  of all  K-12 \nPennsylvania schools.  (ECF No. 42-2).  On March 19, 2020, the Governor issued an Order \nregarding the closure of all Pennsylvania businesses that were \"non-life-sustaining.\"5 (ECF No. \n42-2).  Enforcement of the Order was to begin on March 21, 2020 at 12:01 a.m.  (ECF No. 42-2). \nSecretary Levine issued a similar order on March 19, 2020.  (ECF No. 42-14).  Defendants then \nissued stay-at-home orders for Allegheny County, Bucks County, Chester County, Delaware \nCounty, Momoe County, Montgomery County, and Philadelphia County.  (ECF Nos. 42-15 and \n42-16).  Enforcement of the Governor's Order was slated to commence on March 23, 2020 at \n8:00 PM.  (ECF No. 42-15).  Amended stay-at-home orders were issued by Defendants from \nMarch 23, 2020 through March 31, 2020 to include other counties.  (ECF Nos. 42-17 through 42-\n29).  On April1, 2020, Defendants ordered all citizens of Pennsylvania to stay-at-home effective \nimmediately  \"except  as  needed  to  access,  support,  or  provide  life-sustaining  businesses, \nemergency or government services.\"  (ECF Nos. 42-30, 42-31, 47-2).  Then, on April 9, 2020, \nthe Governor extended the school closures for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year. \n(ECF No. 47-5). \nThe Governor issued a \"Plan for Pennsylvania\" on or about April17, 2020, that included \na three phased reopening plan-moving from the \"red phase\" to the \"yellow phase\" to the \"green \n5  A  waiver  process,  whereby  businesses  could  challenge  their  designation  as  \"non-life \nsustaining,\" existed from March 19, 2020 until April 3, 2020.  (ECF No. 75, p. 226).  A team of \neconomic development professionals within the Pennsylvania Department of Community and \nEconomic Development was assembled to review the waiver requests.  (ECF No. 75, p. 214). \nOriginally, there were twelve team members and by the end of two weeks there were forty team \nmembers plus fifty members answering the telephones.  (ECF No. 75, p. 214). By the time the \nwaiver period closed, 42,380 waiver requests were received.  6,124 were granted, 12,812 were \ndenied, and 11,636 were determined not to need a waiver.  (ECF No. 38, ~ 14). \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 7 of 66\nphase\" -with corresponding \"work & congregate setting restrictions\" and \"social restrictions.\"6 \n(ECF Nos. 47- and 42-81).  The stay-at-horne provisions of Defendants' orders were extended \nthrough  June  4,  2020.7  (ECF  Nos.  42-48,  42-49,  42-50,  and  42-51).  On May  7,  2020, \nDefendants  issued  an  order  for  limited  opening  of businesses,  lifting  the  stay-at-horne \nrequirements  in  certain  counties  and  moving  them  into  the  \"yellow phase,\"  but  imposing \ngathering limits.  (ECF Nos. 42-52 and ECF Nos. 42-53).  Throughout May and June, various \ncounties were moved by Defendants from the \"yellow phase\" to the \"green phase.\"  (ECF Nos. \n42-54 through 42-61, and 42-63 through 42-75).  The final county, Lebanon, was moved into the \n\"green phase\"  effective  July  3,  2020.  (ECF  No.  42-74).  The  \"green phase\"  eased  most \nrestrictions with the continued suspension of the stay-at-horne and business closure orders.  (ECF \nNo. 75, pp. 36-37, 144-45). \n6 The phases were developed by members of senior staff in the Governor's Office who thought it \nwould  be  \"understandable\"  to  the  citizens  of Pennsylvania.  (ECF  No.  75,  p.  75).  The \nCommonwealth partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to review demographic and health \ndata for each county.  When considering the movement of counties from the \"yellow phase\" to \nthe \"green phase,\" the Department of Health relied on four rnetrics: \n(1) whether the county had stable, decreasing, or low confirmed case counts for \nthe  immediately  proceeding  14-day  period  compared  to  the  previous  14-day \nperiod; (2) whether the contacts of cases within the county were being monitored; \n(3) whether the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing positivity rate, meaning \nthe number of positive cases per 100,000 population, had been less than 10% for \nthe past 14 days; and (4) whether hospital bed use was 90% per district population \nin the county. \n(ECF  No.  37,  ~ 25).  As to  the  business  closures,  the  Governor's  office  based reopening \ndecisions \"upon whether a business created a high-risk for transmission of COVID-19.\"  (ECF \nNo. 39, ~ 17). \n7 While the Governor's representative testified that \"our approach throughout the pandemic has \nnot been to take an aggressive enforcement approach,\" the fact remains that Pennsylvanians were \ncited for violating the stay-at-horne and business closure orders.  (ECF No. 74, pp. 61-69; ECF \nNos. 42-102,48-7, 54-3). \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 8 of 66\nOn June  3,  2020, the  Governor renewed his proclamation of disaster emergency for \nninety days.  (ECF No.  42-62).  On July  15, 2020, Defendants issued \"targeted mitigation\" \norders  imposing limitations  on businesses  in the  food  services industry,  closing nightclubs, \nprohibiting indoor  events  and  gatherings  of more than 25  persons,  and prohibiting outdoor \ngatherings of more than 250 persons.  (ECF Nos. 48-5, 48-6, 54-1).  Most recently, on August \n31, 2020, Governor Wolf renewed his proclamation of disaster emergency for ninety days stating \n\"the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be of such magnitude and severity that emergency action \nis necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of affected citizens of Pennsylvania.\"  (ECF \nNos. 73, 73-1).  This disaster declaration allows \"based on the course and development of the \nvirus, that certain restrictions could be put back in place.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 37). \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint on May 7,  2020, seeking a declaratory judgment that \nDefendants violated certain constitutional rights  through the  issuance  of orders  designed to \ncombat the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Plaintiffs  are  comprised of three  groups.  The  \"County \nPlaintiffs\" consist of the Counties of Butler, Fayette, Greene, and Washington, Pennsylvania. \nThe \"Political Plaintiffs\" consist of the following individuals: Mike Kelly, an individual residing \nin the County of Butler and a member of the United States House of Representatives; Daryl \nMetcalfe, an individual residing in the County of Butler and a member of the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania House of Representatives; Marci Mustello, an individual residing in the County of \nButler and a member of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania House of Representatives; and Tim \nBonner,  an  individual  doing  business  in  the  County  of  Butler  and  a  member  of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania House of Representatives.  The \"Business Plaintiffs\" consist of \nthe following: Nancy Gifford and Mike Gifford, d/b/a Double Image; Prima Capelli, Inc.; Steven \nSchoeffel; Paul F.  Crawford, t/d/b/a Marigold Farm; Cathy Hoskins, t!d/b/a Classy Cuts Hair \n8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 9 of 66\nSalon; R.W. McDonald & Sons, Inc.; Starlight Drive-In, Inc.; and, Skyview Drive-In, LLC.  The \nComplaint asserted five counts under 42 U.S.C.  ยง 1983:  Count I - Violation of The Takings \nClause; Count II - Substantive Due Process; Count III - Procedural Due Process; Count IV -\nViolation of Equal Protection; and, Count V-Violation of the First Amendment.  (ECF No. 1). \nOn May 20, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Speedy Hearing of Declaratory Judgment \nAction Pursuant to Rule 57 and a supporting brief.  (ECF Nos. 9 and 10 ).  Defendants filed their \nResponse on May 26, 2020.  (ECF Nos. 12 and 13).  Telephonic oral argument occurred on May \n27, 2020.  By May 28, 2020 Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court held that expedited \nproceedings were warranted to examine the claims in the Complaint at Count II by the Business \nPlaintiffs, at Count IV by all Plaintiffs, and at Count V by all Plaintiffs.  The Court denied the \nmotion as to Counts I and III.  (ECF No. 15). \nA  Case Management Order was issued on June 2,  2020.  (ECF No.  18).  Expedited \ndiscovery commenced on June  12, 2020.  (ECF No.  18).  The parties agreed that all  direct \ntestimony for the Declaratory Judgment Hearing would be given via written Declarations and/or \nAffidavits and the parties filed those documents along with a Joint Stipulation of Facts and Joint \nExhibits.  (ECF Nos. 16, 19-34, 37-40, 42, 47, 48). Pre-hearing briefs were also submitted.  (ECF \nNos. 36, 40). The declaratory judgment hearing occurred over two days, July 17, 2020 and July \n22, 2020, with eighteen witnesses testifying.  (ECF Nos.  74 and 75).  Afterward, the parties \nsubmitted comprehensive post-hearing briefs and additional adjudicative facts.

THE COUNTY PLAINTIFFS CANNOT ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 1983 \nDefendants argue that the County Plaintiffs-Butler, Fayette, Greene, and Washington \nCounties-are not proper plaintiffs.  They contend that the County Plaintiffs lack standing to \nbring an action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  The County Plaintiffs argue that they have standing on \nboth an individual basis and as representatives of their citizens.  The Court holds that County \nPlaintiffs are not proper parties. \nThe County Plaintiffs focus their argument on general concepts of Article III standing, \npointing to areas where the Counties may be able to illustrate specific harm to them, as counties, \nresulting from Defendants' actions.  The alleged harm includes \"interference with the holding of \npublic meetings that can be attended by all residents of the Counties, negative impacts on tax \nrevenue,  negative  impacts  on reputation,  negative  impacts  on the  citizens  of the  respective \nCounties, and loss of access to lawyers and law offices in those Counties.\"  (ECF No. 56, p. 30). \nBut even if these allegations of harm could establish general Article III standing, they are not \nenough to confer standing under Section 1983. \nSection 1983 does not confer any substantive rights, but rather, merely provides a cause \nof action for the deprivation of constitutional rights under the color of state law.  Counties are \ncreatures of the state.  They do not possess rights under the Constitution.  They cannot assert a \nclaim against the  state-of which they are  a creation-for violating rights that they  do  not \npossess.  See  Williams v.  Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 289 U.S.  36, 40 (1933) (\"A \nmunicipal corporation, created by a state for the better ordering of government, has no privileges \nor immunities under the Federal Constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the will of its \ncreator.\"); see also Pennsylvania Professional Liability Joint Underwriting Ass'n v.  Wolf, 324 F. \n10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 11 of 66\nSupp.  3d 519,  530 (M.D.  Pa. 2018) (\"Counties, municipalities, and other subdivisions  owing \ntheir existence to the state generally cannot assert constitutional claims against their creator.\"); \nWilliams  v.  Corbett,  916  F.  Supp.  2d 593,  598  (M.D.  Pa.  2012) (same); Jackson  v.  Pocono \nMountain School District, 2010 WL 4867615, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 23, 2010) (\"[A] number of \nCircuits, including the Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh, have all held \nthat a political subdivision may not bring a federal suit against its parent state or its subdivisions \non n.g h t s ....\").  \nThe  County Plaintiffs have  attempted to  assert claims  in their  own right and  as  the \nrepresentatives  of  their  residents.  While  counties  may  undoubtedly  litigate  in  many \ncircumstances, as  Defendants aptly note, well established law prohibits the County Plaintiffs \nfrom bringing claims  of constitutional violations under  Section 1983.  As  such,  the  County \nPlaintiffs are not proper parties and cannot obtain relief in this case.  They are hereby dismissed \nas parties. \nB.  CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO DEFENDANTS' ORDERS \n1)  \"Ordinary\"  canons  of constitutional  review  should  be  applied  to \nDefendants' orders. \nBefore moving  into  the  substance  of Plaintiffs'  constitutional  claims,  the  Court will \nexamine  what  \"lens\"  it  should  use  to  review  those  claims.  In  other  words,  what  is  the \nappropriate  standard,  or  regimen  of  standards,  that  the  Court  must  use  to  weigh  the \nconstitutionality  of the  claims?  Plaintiffs  base  their  constitutional  arguments  on  ordinary \nconstitutional scrutiny, whereas Defendants argue that their actions should be afforded a more \ndeferential standard as emergency measures relating to public health. \nOver the last century, federal  courts have developed a regimen of tiered scrutiny for \nexamining most constitutional issues-rational basis scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny and strict \n11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 12 of 66\nscrutiny.  The appropriate standard depends on the nature of the claim and,  specifically, the \nnature of the right allegedly infringed.  In this case, Defendants point to the emergency nature of \nth.e challenged measures and correctly argue that they have broad authority under state police \npowers in reacting to emergency situations relating to public health and safety.  They contend \nthat the traditional standards of constitutional scrutiny should not apply, but rather, that a more \ndeferential standard as articulated in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 31 (1905), should \nbe used.  Defendants contend that Jacobson sets forth a standard that grants almost extraordinary \ndeference to their actions in responding to  a health crisis and that, based on that deference, \nPlaintiffs' claims are doomed to fail.  In other words, Defendants argue that no matter which \ntraditional level of scrutiny that the underlying constitutional violation would normally require, a \nmore deferential standard is appropriate. \nIn Jacobson, the Supreme Court upheld a Massachusetts statute empowering municipal \nboards  of health  to  require  that  all  residents  be  vaccinated  for  smallpox.8  Jacobson  was \nprosecuted for refusing to comply with the City of Cambridge's vaccination mandate.  Id. at 13. \nHe argued that the mandatory vaccine regimen \"was in derogation of the rights secured to [him] \nby the preamble to the Constitution of the United States, and tended to subvert and defeat the \npurposes ofthe Constitution as declared in its preamble.\"  Id.  at 13-14.  Jacobson also contended \nthat the measure violated the Fourteenth Amendment and the \"spirit of the Constitution.\"  Id.  at \n14. \nThe  Supreme Court rejected out-of-hand the arguments that the measure violated the \nConstitution's preamble or \"spirit,\" explaining that only the specific, substantive provisions of \nthe Constitution can give rise to an actionable claim of rights.  The Supreme Court, likewise, \n8  The statute provided an exception for children who had a certificate signed by a physician \nrepresenting that they were \"unfit subjects for vaccination.\" Id. at 12-13. \n12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 13 of 66\nrejected Jacobson's challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment.  It explained that the  States \npossess broad police powers which encompass public health measures: \n[a]lthough this court has refrained from any attempt to define the limits of that \npower, yet it has distinctly recognized the authority of a state to enact quarantine \nlaws and 'health laws of every description;' indeed, all laws that relate to matters \ncompletely within its  territory and which do  not by their necessary  operation \naffect the people of other states. \nI d.  at 25.  The  Supreme Court explained that \"the police power of a state must be held to \nembrace, at least, such reasonable regulations established directly by legislative enactments as \nwill protect the public health and the public safety.\"  I d. \nAlthough the Jacobson Court unquestionably afforded a substantial level of deference to \nthe discretion of state and local officials in matters of public health, it did not hold that deference \nis limitless.  Rather-it closed its opinion with a caveat to the contrary: \nBefore  closing  this  opinion  we  deem  it  appropriate,  in  order  to  prevent \nmisapprehension [of] our views, to observe-perhaps to repeat a thought already \nsufficiently  expressed,  namely-that  the  police  power  of  a  state,  whether \nexercised directly by the legislature, or by a local body acting under its authority, \nmay  be  exerted  in  such  circumstances,  or  by  regulations  so  arbitrary  and \noppressive in particular cases, as to justify the interference of the courts to prevent \nwrong and oppression. \nId.  at 38.  There is no question, therefore, that even under the plain language of Jacobson, a \npublic health measure may violate the Constitution. \nJacobson was decided over a century ago.  Since that time, there has been substantial \ndevelopment of federal tonstitutionallaw in the area of civil liberties.  As a general matter, this \ndevelopment has seen a jurisprudential shift whereby federal courts have given greater deference \nto considerations of individual liberties, as weighed against the exercise of state police powers. \nThat century of development has seen the creation of tiered levels of scrutiny for constitutional \nclaims.  They did not exist when Jacobson was decided.  While Jacobson has been cited by some \nmodem courts as ongoing support for a broad, hands-off deference to state authorities in matters \n13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 14 of 66\nof health  and  safety,  other  courts  and  commentators  have  questioned  whether  it  remains \ninstructive in light of the intervening jurisprudential developments. \nIn Bayley's Campground, Inc.  v.  Mills,_ F. Supp. 3d_, 2020 WL 2791797 (D. Me. \nMay 29, 2020),  a district court examined whether the governor of Maine's emergency order \nrequiring, inter alia, visitors from out of state to self-quarantine, was constitutional.  As here, \nbefore proceeding to its analysis of the substantive legal issues, the court examined how it should \nweigh the issues-according to a very deferential analysis purportedly consistent with Jacobson, \nas advocated by the governor, or under  \"regular\" levels of scrutiny advocated by the plaintiffs. \nThe district court examined Jacobson and, specifically, whether it warranted the application of a \nlooser,  more  deferential,  standard  than the  \"regular\"  tiered  scrutiny  used  on  constitutional \nchallenges.  It observed: \"[i]n the eleven decades since Jacobson, the Supreme Court refmed its \napproach for the review of state action that burdens constitutional rights.\"  Id.  at  *8  (citing \nPlanned Parenthood v.  Casey,  505 U.S. 833, 857 (1992)).  See also Planned Parenthood, 505 \nU.S. at 857 (citing Jacobson, 197 U.S. 24-30) (affirming that \"a State's interest in the protection \nof life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims.\").  The district \ncourt declined to apply a standard below those of the established tiered levels of scrutiny.  It \nstated: \n[T]he permissive Jacobson rule floats about in the air as a rubber stamp for all but \nthe most absurd and egregious restrictions on constitutional liberties, free from the \ninconvenience of meaningful judicial review.  This may help explain why the \nSupreme Court established the traditional tiers of scrutiny in the course of the 100 \nyears since Jacobson was decided. \nBayley's Campground, at *8. \nJustice Alito's dissent Goined by Justices Thomas and Kavanaugh) to the Court's denial \nof emergency injunctive relief in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v.  Sisolak, _  U.S. _, 2020 \n14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 15 of 66\nWL 4251360 (Jul. 24, 2020) (Alita, J., dissenting), also casts doubt on whether Jacobson can, \nconsistent with modem jurisprudence, be applied to establish a diminished, overly deferential, \nlevel of constitutional review of emergency health measures.9  In arguing that the Supreme Court \nshould have granted the requested injunction, Justice Alita stated: \"[w]e have a duty to defend \nthe Constitution, and even a public health emergency does not absolve us of that responsibility.\" \n!d. at * 1.  Justice Alit o pointed out: \nFor months now, States and their subdivisions have responded to the pandemic by \nimposing  unprecedented  restrictions  on  personal  liberty,  including  the  free \nexercise of religion.  This initial response was understandable.  In times of crisis, \npublic officials must respond quickly and decisively to  evolving and uncertain \nsituations.  At the dawn of an emergency-and the opening days of the COVID-\n19 outbreak plainly qualify-public officials may not be able to craft precisely \ntailored rules.  Time, information, and expertise may be in short supply, and those \nresponsible for enforcement may lack the resources needed to administer rules \nthat  draw fine  distinctions.  Thus,  at the  outset  of an  emergency,  it may be \nappropriate for courts to tolerate very blunt rules.  In general, that is what has \nhappened thus far during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nBut a public health emergency does not give Governors and other public officials \ncarte blanche to  disregard the Constitution for as long as the medical problem \npersists.  As  more medical  and  scientific  evidence becomes  available,  and as \nStates have time to craft policies in light of that evidence, courts should expect \npolicies that more carefully account for constitutional rights. \nId.  at *2.  Justice Alita found umeasonable the argument that Jacobson could be used to create a \ndeferential standard whereby public health measures will pass scrutiny unless they are \"beyond \nall question a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\"  Id  at *5. \nRather, he reasoned, \"it is a mistake to take language in Jacobson as the last word on what the \nConstitution  allows  public  officials  to  do  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  .  .  .  . It is  a \nconsiderable stretch to read the [Jacobson] decision as establishing the test to be applied when \n9  The Court is  aware that neither the Supreme Court's denial of review, nor Justice  Ali to's \ndissent are precedential, however, in light of the facts and circumstances in this case, the Court \nfinds Justice Ali to's dissent instructive and persuasive regarding the issues presented. \n15 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 16 of 66\nstatewide measures of indefinite duration are challenged under the First Amendment or other \n* \nprovisions not at issue in that case.\"  I d. at  5. \nThe district court in Bayley's Campground cited to a recent scholarly article examining \nthe type of constitutional scrutiny that should be applied to challenges to COVID-19 mitigation \nstrategies-Lindsay F.  Wiley  &  Stephen I.  Vladeck,  Coronavirus,  Civil  Liberties,  and the \nCourts: the Case Against \"Suspending\" Judicial Review, 133 HARV. L. REv. F.  179 (2020).10 \nThe Court has reviewed the professors' paper and finds it both instructive and persuasive.  There, \nthe  learned  professors  argue  that  Jacobson  should  not  be  interpreted  as  permitting  the \n\"suspension\" of traditional levels of constitutional scrutiny in reviewing challenges to COVID-\n19 mitigation measures.  Id.  at 182 (\"In this Essay, we argue that the suspension approach to \njudicial review is wrong-not just as applied to governmental actions taken in response to novel \ncoronavirus, but in general.\").  The professors highlight three objections to an overly deferential \n\"suspension\" model standard of review: \nFirst, the suspension principle is inextricably linked with the idea that a crisis is of \nfinite-and brief-duration.  To that end, the principle is ill-suited for long-term \nand open-ended emergencies like the one in which we currently find ourselves. \nSecond, and relatedly, the suspension model is based upon the oft-unsubstantiated \nassertion that \"ordinary\" judicial review will be too harsh on government actions \nin a  crisis-and could  therefore  undermine  the  efficacy  of the  government's \nresponse.  In  contrast,  as  some  of  the  coronavirus  cases  have  already \ndemonstrated, most of these measures would have met with the same fate under \n\"ordinary\" scrutiny, too.  The principles of proportionality and balancing driving \nmost modem constitutional standards permit greater incursions into civil liberties \nin times of greater communal need.  That is the essence of the \"liberty regulated \nby law\" described by the Court in Jacobson. \nFinally,  the  most  critical  failure  of the  suspension model  is  that it does  not \naccount for the importance of an independent judiciary in a crisis-\"as perhaps \n10  Lindsay  F.  Wiley  is  Professor  of Law  and  Director,  Health  Law  and  Policy  Program, \nAmerican University Washington School of Law.  Stephen I. Vladeck is the A. Dalton Cross \nProfessor ofLaw, University of Texas School ofLaw. Id. at 179. \n16 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 17 of 66\nthe only institution that is in any structural position to push back against potential \noverreaching by the local, state, or federal political branches .... Otherwise, we \nrisk ending up with decisions like Korematsu v.  United States-in which courts \nsustain gross violations of civil rights because they are either unwilling or unable \nto meaningfully look behind the government's purported claims of exigency. \nId.  at 182-83 (internal footnotes and citations omitted).  These objections, especially the problem \nof ongoing and indefinite emergency measures, largely mirror the concern expressed by Justice \nAlito in Calvary Chapel. \nThe Court shares the concerns expressed by Justice Alito, as well as Professors Wiley \nand Vladeck, and believes that an extraordinarily deferential standard based on Jacobson is not \nappropriate. The Court will apply \"regular\" constitutional scrutiny to the issues in this case.  Two \nconsiderations inform this decision-the ongoing and open-ended nature of the restrictions and \nthe  need  for  an  independent judiciary  to  serve  as  a  check  on the  exercise  of emergency \ngovernment power. \nFirst, the ongoing and indefinite nature of Defendants'  actions weigh strongly against \napplication of a more deferential level of review.  The extraordinary emergency measures taken \nby Defendants in this case were promulgated beginning in March-six months ago.  What were \ninitially  billed as  temporary  measures  necessary  to  \"flatten the  curve\"  and  protect hospital \ncapacity have become open-ended and ongoing restrictions  aimed at  a very  different  end-\nstopping the spread of an infectious  disease  and preventing new cases from  arising-which \nrequires  ongoing  and  open-ended  efforts.  Further,  while  the  harshest  measures  have  been \n\"suspended,\" Defendants admit that they remain in-place and can be reinstated sua sponte as and \nwhen Defendants  see fit.  In other words, while not currently being enforced,  Pennsylvania \ncitizens remain subject to the re-imposition of the most severe provisions at any time.  Further, \ntestimony and evidence presented by Defendants does not establish any specified exit gate or end \n17 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 18 of 66\ndate to the emergency interventions.  Rather, the record shows that Defendants view the presence \nof disease mitigation restrictions upon the citizens of Pennsylvania as a \"new normal\" and they \nhave no actual plan to return to a state where all restrictions are lifted.  It bears repeating; after \nsix months, there is no plan to return to a situation where there are no restrictions imposed upon \nthe people of the Commonwealth.  Sam Robinson, a Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor, \ntestified as much when asked if there was a phase of reopening beyond the \"green phase\" where \nthere would be no restrictions: \nQ.  You can't move from green to no restrictions whatsoever?  There's no \nway to do that under this system, right? \nA.  So  there  are  a  number  of options  for,  you  know,  what  post  green \npotentially could look like, and that could just be entirely removal of all \nrestrictions  or  replacement with other restrictions,  maybe  not  a  color \ncoordinated system.  There are certainly other options on the July  15th \norder that we've referenced from last week, certainly an approach that was \na  change  that  was  not  strictly  speaking  within  the  red/yellow/green \nframework as originally contemplated. \nAnd we are doing our best to respond to the pandemic nimbly and not \nbeing locked into a specific approach but to target areas where we see \nspread  and things  that  we  can do  to  balance  the  need  to  reopen the \neconomy and continue moving Pennsylvania back towards the new normal \nthat the governors and others have talked about while at the same time \ntaking targeted mitigation steps  to prevent the spread of the virus, which \nis what's embodied in that July 15th order. \nQ.  What is  the  new normal?  What  does  the  governor mean by the  new \nnormal?  What's that mean? \nA.  Well, we're still evolving into it, but obviously it's more consciousness \nabout steps to prevent the spread of COVID and ways that Pennsylvanians \nare having to be more conscious of those mitigation efforts and take steps \nto be responsible individually to protect fellow Pennsylvanians. \n(ECF No. 75, pp. 70-71).  Even when the existing restrictions are replaced, it appears to be the \nintent of Defendants to impose and/or keep in place some ongoing restrictions.  Mr. Robinson \ntestified that \"early on it was sort of just assumed that beyond green was no restrictions, and that \n18 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 19 of 66\nmay be ultimately where we get.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 75).  However, the position is now less clear \nin that Mr. Robinson hedged on whether any future period of no restrictions can be foreseen. \n(ECF No. 75, p. 76) (\"at the point that we are ready to remove all of the restrictions, we will have \na discussion about how specifically to do that.  It may be that the whole-you know, that whole \nsystem is replaced with just very limited restrictions.\") (emphasis added). \nCourts are generally willing to give temporary deference to temporary measures aimed at \nremedying a fleeting crisis.  Wiley & Vladeck, supra p.  16, at 183.  Examples include natural \ndisasters, civil umest, or other man-made emergenciesY  There is no question, as Justice Alito \nreasoned in Calvary Chapel, that courts may provide state and local officials greater deference \nwhen making time-sensitive decisions in the maelstrom of an emergency.  But that deference \ncannot go on forever.  It is no longer March.  It is now September and the record makes clear that \nDefendants have no anticipated end-date to their emergency interventions.  Courts surely may be \nwilling to give in a fleeting crisis.  But here, the duration of the crisis-in which days have \nturned into weeks and weeks into months-already exceeds natural disasters or other episodic \nemergencies and its length remains uncertain.  Wiley & Vladeck, supra page 16, at 184.  Faced \nwith ongoing  interventions  of indeterminate  length, 12  \"suspension\"  of normal  constitutional \nlevels of scrutiny may ultimately lead to the suspension of constitutional liberties themselves. \n11  See  generally  Moorhead  v.  Farrelly,  727  F.  Supp.  193  (D.  V.I.  1989)  (discussing  the \ndestruction resulting from Hurricane Hugo);  United States v.  Chalk,  441  F.2d 1277 (4th Cir. \n1971)  (discussing widespread  civil umest resulting  from racial  incident);  In  re  Juan  C.,  28 \nCal.App.4th 1093 (Ca.  1994) (discussing measures implemented to combat widespread looting \nand violence resulting from Los Angeles rioting). \n12  It is true that under 35  Pa.C.S.A ยง 7301(c), the Governor's declaration of emergency, and \nrelated measures, will expire after ninety days.  However, the Governor is able to sua sponte \nissue a continued emergency declaration.  In Wolfv. Scarnati, _A.3d_, 2020 WL 3567269 (Pa. \nJul. 1, 2020), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a vote of the legislature was powerless \nto vitiate the declaration, unless the governor signed off (as in normal legislation).  See id.  at * 11 \n19 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 20 of 66\nSecond,  ordinary  constitutional  scrutiny  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  independent \njudiciary's  role  as  a  guarantor  of constitutional  liberties-even  m  an  emergency.  While \nprinciples of balancing may require courts to give lesser weight to certain liberties for a time, the \njudiciary cannot abrogate its own critical constitutional role by applying an overly deferential \nstandard. \nWhile  respecting  the  immediate  role  of the  political  branches  to  address  emergent \nsituations,  the  judiciary  cannot  be  overly  deferential  to  their  decisions.  To  do  so  risks \nsubordinating the guarantees of the Constitution, guarantees which are the patrimony of every \ncitizen, to the immediate need for an expedient solution.  This is especially the case where, as \nhere,  measures  directly  impacting  citizens  are  taken  outside  the  normal  legislative  or \nadministrative process by Defendants alone.  There is no question that our founders abhorred the \nconcept of one-person rule.  They decried government by fiat.  Absent a robust system of checks \nand balances, the guarantees of liberty set forth in the Constitution are just ink on parchment. \nThere is no question that a global pandemic poses serious challenges for governments and for all \nAmericans.  But  the  response  to  a  pandemic  (or  any  emergency)  cannot  be  permitted  to \n(\"because H.R.  836 was not presented to the Governor, and, in fact,  affirmatively denied the \nGovernor the opportunity to approve or veto that resolution, H.R. 836 did not conform with the \nGeneral  Assembly's  statutory  mandate  in  section  7301(c)  or  with  the  Pennsylvania \nConstitution.\").  Thus, in practical effect, absent a veto-override, the Governor's orders can be \nreissued without limit.  Professors Wiley & Vladeck recognized that this situation could lead to \nthe  situation of the permanent emergency:  \"[a]t least under federal  law,  emergencies,  once \ndeclared, tend not to end; the President can unilaterally extend national emergency declarations \non an annual basis in perpetuity, and can be stopped only by veto-proof supermajorities of both \nhouses  of Congress.  And unless  courts  are  going to  rigorously  review whether the  factual \njustification for the emergency measure is still present[,] ... the government can adopt measures \nthat wouldn't be possible during \"normal\" times long after the true exigency passed.\"  Wiley & \nVladeck, supra page 16, at 187.  On August 31, 2020, the Governor renewed the emergency \ndeclaration, extending his extraordinary authority for an additional ninety days.  (ECF No. 73-1). \nAgain, absent an extraordinary veto-proofvote of the General Assembly, there is no limit on the \nnumber of times the Governor may renew the declaration and vest himself with extraordinary \nunilateral powers. \n20 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 21 of 66\nundermine our system of constitutional liberties or the system of checks and balances protecting \nthose liberties.  Here, Defendants are statutorily permitted to act with little, if any, meaningful \ninput from the legislature.  For the judiciary to  apply an overly  deferential  standard would \nremove the only meaningful check on the exercise of power. \nUsing the normal levels of constitutional scrutiny in emergency circumstances does not \nprevent governments from taking extraordinary actions to face extraordinary situations.  Indeed, \nan element of each level of scrutiny is assessing and weighing the purpose and circumstances of \nthe government's act.  The application of normal scrutiny will only require the government to \nrespect the fact that the Constitution applies even in times of emergency.  As the Supreme Court \nhas observed: \"[t]he Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency.  Its grants of \npower to the federal government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in \nthe light of emergency, and they are not altered by emergency.\"  Home Building & Loan Ass 'n. \nv. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 425 (1934).13  Ordinary constitutional scrutiny will be applied. \n2)  The gathering limits imposed by Defendants' orders violate the First \nAmendment. \n13 In a recent case brought in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, plaintiffs brought suit against \nGovernor Wolf and others, contending that their constitutional rights were violated as a result of \nthe Governor's Orders, and to that extent, requested the district court to temporarily restrain the \nenforcement ofthe Orders.  Benner v.  Wolf, _F. Supp.  3d __,  2020 WL  2564920,  at *1-3 \n(M.D.  Pa.  May 21, 2020).  The district court addressed,  inter alia,  whether the Governor's \nOrders  exceeded the permissible  scope  of his  police powers,  and  in doing  so,  applied the \ndeferential Jacobson standard of review.  Id.  at *6.  The district court held that the plaintiffs had \nfailed to  establish that the  Orders were not \"reasonably necessary\" or \"unduly burdensome\" \nbecause they could not provide evidentiary support to contradict the defendant's broad policy \ndecisions.  Id.  The immediate case, however, is readily distinguishable because the Court now \nhas  the  benefit  of a  developed  evidentiary  record,  which  includes  specific  reasoning  and \ntestimony from the parties.  The Court also recognizes that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's \ndecision in Friends of Danny De Vito v.  Wolf,  227 A. 3d 872 (Pa. 2020), addresses some of the \nfederal constitutional issues presented in this case and the court reviewed those issues through a \nmore  deferential  standard.  While the  Pennsylvania Supreme Court is  fmal  on questions  of \nPennsylvania law, it does not bind the Court on federal questions. \n21 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 22 of 66\nDefendants' July 15, 2020 Order imposes limitations on \"events and gatherings\" of 25 \npersons for indoor gatherings and 250 persons for outdoor gatherings.  The Order defines \"events \nand gatherings\" as: \nA temporary grouping of individuals for defined purposes, that takes place over \na limited timeframe, such as hours or days.  For example, events and gatherings \ninclude fairs, festivals, concerts,  or shows and groupings that occur within larger, \nmore permanent businesses, such as  shows or performances within amusement \nparks,  individual  showings  of movies  on a  single  screen/auditorium within a \nmultiplex, business meetings or conferences, or each party or reception within a \nmulti-room venue. \nThe term does not include a discrete event or gathering in a business in the retail \nfood services industry addressed by Section 1 [ofthe July 15, 2020, Order]. \nThe maximum occupancy limit includes staff. \n(ECF No. 48-5, Section 2) (emphasis added).  The Order has no end-date or other mechanism for \nexpiration, but rather, purports to remain in effect \"until further notice.\"  (ECF No. 48-5, Section \n8).  By its own language, the congregate gathering limitation imposed is broad-applying to any \ngathering  of individuals  on  public  or  private  property  for  any  purpose-including  social \ngatherings.14  The July 15, 2020 Order is an amendment to the May 27, 2020 Order setting forth \nthe parameters of the \"green phase\" of Defendants' reopening plan.  The difference between the \ntwo orders is that the May 29, 2020 Order did not include the 25 person indoor limit, but rather \nprovided: \"[a]ny gathering for a planned or spontaneous event of greater than 250 individuals is \nprohibited.\"  (ECF No. 42-58). \nThe  gathering  limits  specifically  exempt religious  gatherings  and certain commercial \noperations set forth in the Order and previous orders.  Section 1 of the July  15, 2020  Order \n14  For example,  the  Governor's  \"Process to  Reopen Pennsylvania\" classifies the  congregate \nlimits in the category of \"social restrictions.\"  (ECF 42-81, p. 4).  Mr. Robinson confirmed that \nthey apply to purely personal or social gatherings, like weddings.  (ECF No. 75, p. 54). \n22 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 23 of 66\nImposes  an  occupancy  limit  of twenty-five  percent  (25%)  of \"stated  fire  code  maximum \noccupancy\" for bars and, apparently, restaurants.  (ECF No. 48-5, Section 1).  The May 27, 2020 \nOrder permits businesses (other than businesses in the retail food industry, personal services, \nsuch as barbers and salons, and gyms-all of which are given other guidance) to operate at either \nfifty percent (50%) or seventy-five percent (75%) of their building occupancy limits.  (ECF No. \n42-58, Section 1).  Mr.  Robinson confirmed that the gathering limits do not apply to normal \nbusiness operations: \n[T]he 25-person restriction that we were discussing previously does not apply in \nthe  course  of general business  operations.  So  you could have more than 25 \npeople in that store.  There's no restriction of that sort that would be applicable, \nand  I  think we've  tried  to  clarify  that  in  many  different  forms,  the  sort  of \napplicability of the occupancy restrictions-sorry.  The discrete event limits. \nBut to the extent-and this is just to provide an overly full answer.  To the extent \nthat  a  store  had  a  special  sales  event  or  something  of that  sort,  a  product \ndemonstration, they would be limited to 25 people in that specific instance.  But \nin any other instance there would be no applicable limit within the store for their \ngeneral business beyond the kind of occupancy limits that would be in place. \n(ECF No. 75, pp. 139-40). \nThe record is unclear as to whether the orders limiting the size of gatherings apply to \nprotests.  The plain language of the orders makes no exception for protests, which seemingly run \ndirectly contrary to the plain language of the May 27,2020 Order that states, \"[a]ny gathering for \na planned or spontaneous event of greater than 250 individuals.\"  (ECF No. 42-58).  However, \nthe record unequivocally shows that Defendants have permitted protests, and that the Governor \nparticipated in a protest which exceeded the limitation set forth in his order and did not comply \nwith other restrictions mandating social distancing and mask wearing.  (ECF No. 42-101). \nFinally, Plaintiffs make much of the fact that Defendants have provided an exception to \nthe congregate gathering limit as applied to a major event in central Pennsylvania referred to as \n23 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 24 of 66\n\"Spring Carlisle,\" which is an auto show and flea market.  (ECF 64).  After being sued in the \nPennsylvania Commonwealth Court because of the impact ofthe congregate limits on the event, \nSecretary Levine settled the action by giving a substantial exception for the event.  Specifically, \nindoor occupancy was permitted up to an occupancy of 250 individuals or 50% of the maximum \nbuilding  occupancy.  (ECF  64-1,  p.  1).  Outdoor  occupancy  was  permitted  up  to  20,000 \nindividuals, which is 50% of the normal capacity.  (ECF No. 64-1, p. 2). \nPlaintiffs argue that the limits on gatherings imposed by Defendants violate their right of \nassembly and their related right of free speech.  Specifically, the Political Plaintiffs (Metcalfe, \nMustello, Bonner and Kelly)  contend that the gathering limits unconstitutionally violate their \nright  to  hold  campaign  gatherings,  fundraisers,  and  other  events.  Each  argued  that  the \ncongregate gathering limitations hindered their ability to campaign and limited their ability to \nmeet and connect with voters.  By way of example, Congressman Kelly stated: \nWe were also forced to cancel multiple fundraisers and dinners.  In the past, these \nfundraisers  have  financed a  significant portion of my  campaigns, yet for  this \nelection I had to entirely forgo holding them.  My campaign was also forced to \ncancel  a  political  rally  for  me  to  speak  to  constituents  due  to  both  travel \nprohibitions and congregate rules. \n(ECF  No.  27,  p.  2).  On  a  similar  note,  Representative  Mustello  testified  that  a  planned \nfundraiser had to be scrapped after the July 15, 2020 Order decreased indoor capacity to twenty-\nfive (25) people.  (ECF No. 74, pp.  166-67).  She testified that she intended to host it outside, \nbut she was concerned about the weather.  (ECF No. 74, p. 167).  Political Plaintiffs contend that \nthe  gathering  limits  unfairly  target  some  gatherings,  while  permitting  others-such  as \ncommercial gatherings or protests. \nDefendants contend that the gathering limits pass constitutional muster because they are \nlegitimate exercises of Defendants' police power in an emergency situation and are content-\n24 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 25 of 66\nneutraL  (ECF No.  66, p.  24).  They contend that \"[e]ven in a traditional public forum,  the \ngovernment may impose content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions provided that the \nrestrictions are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are \nnarrowly tailored to  serve a significant government interest,  and that they leave open ample \nalterative channels for  communication of the information.\"  (ECF No.  66, pp.  24-25)  (citing \nStartzell v.  City of Philadelphia, 533 F.3d 183, 197 (3d Cir. 2008)).  Defendants argue that the \nrestrictions  leave  open many different avenues  of campaigning and communication,  such as \ninternet, mailings, yard signs, speaking to the press, television and radio.  (ECF No. 66, p. 25). \nFinally, Defendants reject the contention that the stated (although not in the orders themselves) \npermission  to  attend  protests  constituted  impermissible  content-based  distinctions  on  the \napplicability of the limits.  They point to the fact that some of the Plaintiffs attended rallies and \nprotests against Defendants' measures and that neither they nor other protesters were subject to \nenforcement action, \"even when social distancing protocols are not adhered to.\"  (ECF No. 66, p. \n27) (citing Benner v.  Wolf, _F. Supp.  3d _, 2020 WL 2564920, at *8  (M.D. Pa. May 21, \n2020)). \na)  The Court will apply intermediate scrutiny to Plaintiffs' challenges. \nThe Court must first determine what standard of constitutional scrutiny to apply to the \ncongregate limits set forth in Defendants' orders.  The right of assembly is a fundamental right \nenshrined in the First Amendment:  \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of \nspeech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the \nGovernment for a redress of grievances.\"  U.S. CONST. AMEND. 1, in relevant part.  The right of \nassembly has long been incorporated to the States.  See DeJonge v.  Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 259-\n260 (1937).  Although the right to peaceably assemble is not coterminous with the freedom of \n25 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 26 of 66\nspeech, they have been afforded nearly identical analysis by courts for nearly a century.  See \ngenerally Nicholas S. Brod, Rethinking a Reinvigorated Right to Assemble, 63 DUKE L.J.  155 \n(2013).  See also DeJonge, 299 U.S. at 364 (\"The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate \nto those of free speech and free press and is equally fundamental.\");  Clark v.  Community for \nCreative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984) (applying speech analysis to a gathering on the \nNational Mall); Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 152-53 (1969) (While not \"speech\" \nin the  purest  sense  of the  word,  gathering,  picketing,  and  parading  constitute  methods  of \nexpression, entitled to First Amendment protection.). \nIn this case, some of the Plaintiffs seek to assemble relative to their campaigns for public \noffice.  This type of gathering is unquestionably expressive in nature and, therefore, neatly fits \ninto the practice of looking at right of assembly challenges through the lens for free  speech \njurisprudence.  This is the approach taken by the Eastern District of Kentucky in a recent case \nchallenging COVID-19 congregate limits.  Ramsekv. Beshear, _F. Supp. 3d_,  2020  WL \n3446249 (E.D. Ky. Jun. 24, 2020).15 \nRamsek, like this case, was a challenge to the congregate limits imposed by the governor \nof Kentucky as applied to protests.  Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the limits violated \ntheir right to gather to protest elements of the governor's COVID-19 mitigation strategy.  The \nRamsek court explained that content-based time, place and manner restrictions on speech and \ngatherings are subject to strict scrutiny.  Id at *7.  \"A content-based restriction on speech is one \nthat singles out a specific subject matter for differential treatment.\"  Id.  (citing Reed v.  Town of \n15  The congregate limits in question applied to \"any event or convening that brings together \ngroups of individuals,  including,  but not limited to,  community,  civic, public,  leisure,  faith \nbased,  or  sporting  events;  parades;  concerts;  festivals;  conventions;  fundraisers;  and  similar \nactivities.\"  Ramsek,  at  *8.  The  Order  was  subsequently  amended  to  permit  faith-based \ngatherings.  Id. at *8 n.8. \n26 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 27 of 66\nGilbert, Ariz., 576 U.S. 155, 157 (2015)).  Content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions, \non the other hand, are afforded intermediate scrutiny.  !d.  (citing Perry v.  Educ. Ass'n v.  Perry \nLocal Educator's Ass 'n.,  460  U.S.  37,  46  (1983))  (content-neutral time,  place  and  manner \nrestrictions on speech are permissible to the extent that they are \"narrowly tailored to serve a \nsignificant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\"). \nThe  Ramsek  court  ultimately  decided  to  apply  intermediate  scrutiny-holding  that  the \ncongregate  restrictions  were  content-neutral  because  they  applied  to  all  gatherings  for  the \npurpose of speech, protest, and other expressive gathering.  !d.  at 9.  In doing so, the Ramsek \ncourt rejected the argument that the restrictions were not content-neutral because people are \npermitted to gather in, for example, retail establishments, airports, and bus stations.  It held that \nthose activities were not apt comparisons because they do not constitute expressive conduct.  !d. \n(citing Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19 (1989)). \nThe Court questions whether the Ramsek court, perhaps, conflated viewpoint neutrality \nand content neutrality or over-weighed the need for expression for assembly to fall under the \nFirst  Amendment.  Moreover,  the  instant  Defendants'  restrictions  are  more  stringent  than \ntraditional time, place  and manner restrictions in that they apply to  all fora,  not just public. \nFurther, the Court wonders whether-in their breadth, the orders in question implicate the right \nof association-as a subbranch of First Amendment assembly jurisprudence.  However, because \nit is an established trend, if not the rule, to apply speech jurisprudence in assembly cases, the \nCourt will apply the same approach here. \nThe question before the Court is whether strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny should \napply  to  Plaintiffs'  challenge  to  the  congregate  gathering  limits.  Following  free  speech \njurisprudence, Plaintiffs' challenge what are akin to time, place and manner restrictions.  The \n27 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 28 of 66\nCourt must determine whether the restrictions are content-based or content-neutral.  To do so, the \nCourt must first determine whether the limits ban certain types of expressive gathering (political \nand community meetings, gatherings, etc.), while permitting others (protests).  To make that \ndetermination  the  Court  must  disentangle  the  language  of Defendants'  orders  from  their \ntestimony.  Sarah Boateng, the Executive Deputy Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of \nHealth, testified that protests are permitted under Defendants'  orders:  \"the governor and the \nsecretary  did make  some public comments about protests and religious  services, you know, \nsaying  that  they  have  made  those  limited  exceptions for  those  constitutionally protected \nspeech, such as protests, and the individuals had the right to protest and demonstrate.\"  (ECF \nNo. 75, p. 176) (emphasis added).  She was unable to specifically identify any specific statement \nor instrument amending the actual language of the orders.  Having reviewed the record, the Court \ndoes not believe that the orders do, in fact, make allowance for protests.  Their plain language \nmakes no mention of protests and makes no distinction between expressive and other gatherings. \nThe Court does not doubt Ms. Boateng's position, that the Governor and Secretary have made \ncomments seemingly permitting protests or justifying the Governor's  personal participation in \nthem, but even under their broad emergency powers, Defendants cannot govern by comment. \nRather, they are bound by the language of their orders.  Those orders make no allowance for \nprotests.  As such, the orders apply to all expressive gatherings, across the board.  To that end, \nthey are content-neutral. \nAs in Ramsek, Plaintiffs make much of the fact that certain gatherings are limited by a \nspecific quota, while people are free to congregate in stores and similar businesses based on a \npercentage of the occupancy limit.  Does permitting people to gather for retail, dining, or other \npurposes based only upon a percentage of facility occupancy, while setting hard-and-fast caps on \n28 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 29 of 66\nother gatherings, constitute content-based restrictions?  The Supreme Court has explained that \n\"the principle inquiry in determining content neutrality, in speech cases generally and in time, \nplace,  or manner cases  in particular, is whether the government has adopted a regulation of \nspeech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\"  Ward v.  Rock Against Racism, \n491  U.S.  781,  791  (1989).  \"A regulation that  serves  purposes  umelated to  the  content of \nexpression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages \nbut not others.\"  Id.  Based on that definition, Defendants' orders are content-neutral.  Limiting \npeople  by  number  for  the  gatherings  specified  in the  orders,  while  permitting  commercial \ngatherings based only on occupancy percentage, is not content-based in that it has nothing to do \nwith the \"message\" of any expressive behavior.  See Ramsek at *9 (citing Dallas, 490 U.S. at 25) \n(\"Unlike an individual protesting on the Capitol lawn, one who is grocery shopping or traveling \nis not, by that action, engaging in protected speech.\").  Because the restrictions are content \nneutral, Defendants' orders will be reviewed with intermediate scrutiny. \nb)  The congregate gathering restrictions fail intermediate scrutiny. \nUnder First Amendment jurisprudence, a non-content-based restriction is not subjected to \nstrict scrutiny, but still must be \"narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and \nleave open ample alternative channels of communication.\"  Perry, 460 U.S.  at 45.  Here, the \nCourt  credits  the  fact  that Defendants'  actions  were  undertaken  in  support  of a  significant \ngovernment interest-managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Commonwealth. \nThe congregate limitations fail scrutiny, however, because they are not narrowly tailored. \nThe Supreme Court explained that \"the requirement of narrow tailoring is  satisfied 'so \nlong as the ... regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less \neffectively  absent  the  regulation.\"'  Ward,  491  U.S.  at  799  (quoting  United  States  v. \n29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 30 of 66\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689 (1985)) (citing Clark v.  Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 \nU.S.  288, 297 (1984)).  Further, \"this standard does not mean that a time, place, or manner \nregulation may burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's \nlegitimate interests. Government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial \nportion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.\"  Id Additionally, \"a statute \nis narrowly tailored if it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the 'evil' it seeks \nto remedy.\"  Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485 (1988). \nDefendants' congregate limits are not narrowly tailored.  Rather, they place substantially \nmore burdens on gatherings than needed to achieve their own stated purpose.  This is not a mere \nsupposition of the Court, but rather, is highlighted by Defendants' own actions. While permitting \ncommercial gatherings at a percentage of occupancy may not render the restrictions on other \n* \ngatherings content-based, they do highlight the lack of narrow tailoring.  See Ramsek, at  10 \n(\"retail stores, airports, churches and the like serve as an inconvenient example of how the Mass \nGatherings Order fails at narrow tailoring.\").  Indeed, hundreds of people may congregate in \nstores, malls, large restaurants and other businesses based only on the occupancy limit of the \nbuilding.  Up  to  20,000 people may  attend the  gathering in Carlisle (almost  100 times the \napproved  outdoor limit!)-with Defendants'  blessing.  Ostensibly, the  occupancy restriction \nlimits in Defendants'  orders for those  commercial purposes  operate to the  same end as the \ncongregate gathering limits-to combat the spread of COVID-19.  However, they do  so in a \nmanner that is  far less restrictive of the First Amendment right of assembly than the orders \npermit for activities that are more traditionally covered within the ambit of the Amendment \npolitical, social, cultural, educational and other expressive gatherings. \n30 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 31 of 66\nMoreover,  the  record  in  this  case  failed  to  establish  any  evidence  that  the  specific \nnumeric congregate limits were necessary to achieve Defendants' ends, much less that \" [they] \ntarget and eliminate no more than the exact source of the 'evil' [they] seek to remedy.\"  Frisby \n487 U.S.at 485.  Mr.  Robinson testified that the congregate limits were designed to prevent \n\"mega-spreading events.\" (ECF No. 75, p. 56).  However, when asked whether, for example, the \nlarge protests-often featuring numbers far in excess of the outdoor limit and without social \ndistancing or masks-led to any known mega-spreading event, he was unable to point to a single \nmega-spreading instance.  (ECF No. 75, p.  155) (\"I am not aware specifically.  I have not seen \nany  sort  of press  coverage  or,  you know,  CDC  information  about  that.  I  have  not  seen \ninformation linking a spread to protests.\"). \nFurther, the limitations are not narrowly tailored in that they do not address the specific \nexperience of the virus across the Commonwealth.  Because all of Pennsylvania's counties are \ncurrently  in the \"green phase,\" the  same  restrictions  apply to  all.  Pennsylvania has  nearly \nfourteen million residents  across  sixty-seven counties.  Pennsylvania has dense  urban  areas, \ncommuter  communities  servicing  the  New  York  metropolitan  area,  small  towns  and  vast \nexpanses of rural communities.  The virus's prevalence varies greatly over the vast diversity of \nthe  Commonwealth-as  do  the  resources  of the  various  regions  to  combat  a  population \nproportionate  outbreak.  Despite  this  diversity,  Defendants'  orders  take  a  one-size  fits  all \napproach.  The same limits apply in counties with a history of hundreds or thousands of cases as \nthose with only a handful.  The statewide approach is broadly, rather than narrowly, tailored. \nThe imposition of a cap on the number of people that may gather for political, social, \ncultural,  educational  and  other  expressive  gatherings,  while  permitting  a  larger  number  for \ncommercial gatherings limited only by a percentage of the occupancy capacity of the facility is \n31 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 32 of 66\nnot narrowly tailored and does not pass constitutional muster.  Moreover, it creates a topsy-turvy \nworld  where  Plaintiffs  are  more  restricted  in  areas  traditionally  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment than in areas which usually receive far less, if any, protection.  This inconsistency \nhas been aptly noted in other COVID-19 cases.  As recognized by the court in Ramsek, \"it is the \nright to  protest-through the  freedom  of speech and  freedom  of assembly  clauses-that is \nconstitutionally protected,  not the right to  dine  out,  work in an  office  setting,  or  attend  an \nauction.\"  Id.  at *10.  In an analogous situation examining restrictions on religious practice, \nwhile permitting retail operations,  a court aptly  observed that \"[i]f social distancing is  good \nenough for Home Depot and Kroger, it is good enough for in-person religious services which, \nunlike the foregoing, benefit from constitutional protection.\" Tabernacle Baptist Church, Inc.  v. \nBeshear, _F. Supp. 3d_, 2020 WL 2305307, at *5 (E.D. Ky. May 8, 2020).  The same applies \nhere.  The congregate limits in Defendants' orders are unconstitutional. \n3)  Defendants' orders violated Plaintiffs' rights to substantive due process \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. \nPlaintiffs assert that the components of Defendants' orders closing \"non-life-sustaining\" \nbusinesses  and imposing  a lockdown violated their liberties  guaranteed by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Substantive due process is not an independent right, but \nrather, a recognition that the government may not infringe upon certain freedoms enjoyed by the \npeople as  a component of a system of ordered liberty.  Here,  Plaintiffs assert two  grounds \nwhereby Defendants' orders violated substantive due process-in the imposition of a lockdown \nand in their closure of all businesses that they deemed to be \"non-life-sustaining.\"  While both \nissues fall under the general ambit of substantive due process, they implicate different underlying \nrights.  As such, the Court will address Plaintiffs' substantive due process claims in two stages, \nfirst  examining whether  the  component of Defendants'  orders  imposing  a lockdown passes \n32 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 33 of 66\nconstitutional  muster  and,  then,  proceeding  to  an  examination  of the  business  shutdown \ncomponent. \na)  The stay-at-home provisions. \nGovernor Wolf issued the first stay-at-home Order on March 23, 2020, mandating in \nrelevant part: \nAll individuals residing in the Commonwealth are ordered to stay-at-home except \nas needed to access, support or provide life sustaining business, emergency, or \ngovernment services.  For employees of life sustaining businesses that remain \nopen, the following child care services may remain open: group and family child \ncare  providers  in  a  residence;  child  care  facilities  operating  under  a  waiver \ngranted by the Department of Human Services Office of Child Development and \nEarly Learning; and part-day school age programs operating under an exemption \nfrom the March 19, 2020, business closure Orders. \nA  list  of  life  sustaining  businesses  that  remain  open  is  attached  to  and \nincorporated into this Order.  In addition, businesses that are permitted to remain \nopen include those granted exemptions prior to or following the issuance of this \nOrder. \nIndividuals leaving their home or place of residence to access, support, or provide \nlife  sustaining  services  for  themselves,  another person,  or a pet must employ \nsocial distancing practices as  defmed by the  Centers for  Disease Control  and \nPrevention.  Individuals are permitted to engage in outdoor activities; however, \ngatherings of individuals outside of the home are generally prohibited except as \nmay be required to access, support or provide life sustaining services as outlined \nabove. \n(ECF  No.  42-15).  On April  1,  2020,  the  Order was  later  extended to  all  counties  in the \nCommonwealth.  (ECF 42-30).  Although the initial stay-at-home Order had an expiration date \nof two weeks, it was amended by subsequent orders to extend to later dates.  (ECF Nos. 42-48, \n42-50).  Ultimately, upon the moving of specified counties, and later all counties, into the \"green \nphase,\" the stay-at-home requirements were \"suspended.\"  The suspension is not a rescission, in \nthat Defendants may reinstate the stay-at-home requirements, sua sponte, at any time.  Finally, \nI \nthe currently applicable orders, which maintain the stay-at-home provisions, albeit in suspension \n33 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 34 of 66\nof operation, have no end date, applying \"until further notice.\"  (ECF Nos. 42-58, 42-59, 42-65 \nthrough 42-75, 48-5). \nPlaintiffs argue that the lockdowns effectuated by the stay-at-home orders violate their \nsubstantive due process rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.  They contend that the \norders do not impose traditional disease control measures, such as quarantine or isolation, but \nrather  involuntarily,  and  without  due  process,  confine  the  entire  population  of  the \nCommonwealth to their homes absent a specifically approved purpose.  Plaintiffs contend that \nthe lockdown violated their fundamental right to intrastate travel and their freedom of movement. \nPlaintiffs further argue that, while the power to involuntarily confine individuals is generally \nstrictly  limited  by  law,  Defendants'  lockdown  was  overbroad  and  far  exceeded  legitimate \ngovernment need and authority.  They conclude that even compelling state interests \"cannot be \npursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more \nnarrowly achieved.\"  (ECF No. 56, p. 14) (citing Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488 (1960)). \nDefendants  first  argue  that  the  suspension  of the  stay-at-home  orders  render  their \nconsideration in this case moot.  Moreover, Defendants argue that the stay-at-home orders were \nnot actually orders at all, but merely recommendations.16  On a substantive basis, they argue that \nthe stay-at-home orders survive constitutional scrutiny because they do not shock the conscience. \n(ECF No. 66, p.  12 et seq. (\"The Business Plaintiffs ... have not established a violation of a \nfundamental  liberty interest and the Business Closure Orders and stay-at-home orders do not \nshock the conscience.\")).  They contend that \"the touchstone of due process is protection of the \n16 The Court rejects out-of-hand any suggestion that the stay-at-home provisions of Defendants' \norders  were  merely  recommendations.  The  plain language  of the  orders  shows  that  these \nprovisions  were  mandates.  Further,  the  record  contains  evidence  of citations  issued  to \nPennsylvania residents for violating the orders. \n34 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 35 of 66\nindividual against arbitrary action of government\" and that \"only the most egregious official \nconduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense.\"  (ECF No.  66, p.  16) (citing \nCounty of Sacramento v.  Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845 (1988)).  Essentially, Defendants argue that \nboth the stay-at-home orders and the business closure orders were a legitimate exercise of their \nemergency authority in \"very quickly responding to a public health emergency, a pandemic, the \nlikes of which had ... never been seen in the Commonwealth or nationally, internationally, in \n100 years ....\"   (ECF No. 66, p. 17) (quoting ECF No. 75, p. 26)). \nIn examining this issue, the Court was faced with three major questions-!) whether it \ncan, and/or should, consider the constitutionality of the suspended stay-at-home provisions; if so; \n2) what a lockdown is, from a legal and constitutional perspective and what type of constitutional \nanalysis should be applied; and finally 3) whether a lockdown is constitutional. \ni.  The  Court  may,  and  should,  consider  Plaintiffs' \narguments about the stay-at-home provisions. \nDefendants argue that the question of whether the stay-at-home provisions of orders are \nunconstitutional is mootP  According to Defendants, stay-at-home orders have been suspended \nin operation.  As such, the citizens of the Commonwealth are free to leave their homes for any \npurpose.  Likewise,  Defendants  contend that their  reopening  plan has  permitted  nearly  all \nbusinesses to  reopen,  has  eliminated the  distinction between \"life-sustaining\"  and \"non-life-\nsustaining\"  businesses,  and  have  only  imposed  certain  operational  restrictions  on  ongoing \noperations.  Plaintiffs  counter that the  issues  remain ripe  for  review because,  according  to \nlanguage of the orders, the earlier, more restrictive, provisions are merely suspended, rather than \n17  There is no question that the ongoing restrictions on gatherings are ripe for review.  The \nmootness question is directed at issues surrounding the suspended \"stay-at-home' orders and the \nsubstantially amended business closure orders. \n35 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 36 of 66\nrescinded and Defendants retain the authority to reimpose any and all restrictions sua sponte and \nat any time. \nThe doctrine of mootness is rooted in Article III of the Constitution, which gives federal \ncourts jurisdiction over \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"  Federal courts can only entertain actions if \nthey present live disputes.  Summers v.  Earth Island Inst.,  555 U.S. 488, 492-94 (2009).  The \nplaintiff in a federal action has the initial burden of showing a ripe dispute, but the burden will \nshift if a defendant asserts that some development has mooted elements of the plaintiffs claim. \nHartnett v.  Pa.  State Educ.  Ass 'n,  963  F.3d 301, 305  (3d.  Cir. 2020).  \"If the defendant ... \nclaims that some development has mooted the case, it bears the heavy burden of persuading the \ncourt that there is no longer a live controversy.\" Id. at 305-06 (citing Friends oft he Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Environmental Services (TOC) Inc.,  528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000)).  Although a change in \ncircumstance may render a case moot, it will not always do so.  \"So, sometimes a suit filed on \nMonday will be able to proceed even if, because of a development on Tuesday, the suit would \nhave been dismissed for lack of standing if it had been filed  on Wednesday.  The  Tuesday \ndevelopment does not necessarily moot the suit.\"  Hartnett, 963 F.3d at 306. \nThe \"voluntary cessation\" doctrine may serve as an exception to mootness.  Friends of \nthe  Earth,  528  U.S.  at  189  (\"It is  well  settled that  a  defendant's  voluntary  cessation  of a \nchallenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the \npractice.\") (citation omitted).  As the Third Circuit explained, \n[o ] ne scenario  in which we  are  reluctant to  declare  a case moot is  when the \ndefendant argues mootness because of some action it took unilaterally after the \nlitigation began.  This situation is often called \"voluntary cessation,\" and it \"will \nmoot a case only if it is 'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior \ncould not reasonably be expected to recur.\"' \n36 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 37 of 66\nHartnett, 963 F.3d at 306 (citations omitted).  Thus, \"[w]hen a plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, a \ndefendant arguing mootness must show that there is no reasonable likelihood that a declaratory \njudgment would affect the parties' future conduct.\"  Id. (emphasis added). \nFederal courts have applied the voluntary cessation doctrine in COVID-19 litigation to \nexamine  issues  in  governors'  mitigation  orders  that  were,  seemingly,  rendered  moot  by \nsubsequent amendments to the orders.  In Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church et al.  v.  Pritzker, \n962  F.3d 341  (7th Cir.  2020), the plaintiffs challenged an order  of the  governor of Illinois \nrestricting  in-person religious  services.  After the  case  was  filed,  the  governor replaced the \noriginal  order with  one  lifting the  restrictions  (at least as  to  religious  organizations).  The \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that the superseding order rendered moot \nthe question of whether the revoked order violated the First Amendment.  It observed that the \ngovernor  could move back to  the  more restrictive measures  at will  and that the new order \nspecifically reserved the right to do  so.  As such, the voluntary cessation doctrine precluded \nfinding that the constitutional issues posed by the initial order were moot.  Elim Romanian, 962 \nF.3d at 344-45. \nIn Acosta v.  Wolf, 2020 WL 3542329 (E.D. Pa. June 30, 2020), the plaintiff challenged \nelements of Governor Wolfs emergency orders arguing, inter alia, that they hindered his ability \nto obtain the requisite number of signatures needed to appear on the ballot for United States \nCongress and seek an order placing him on the ballot.  The district court rejected the argument \nthat the promulgation of other, less restrictive orders rendered moot the claims.  It stated: \nThe  \"alleged  violation\"  alleged  today  is  the  Governor's  enforcement  of the \nCommonwealth's  signature  requirement  in  light  of the  executive  emergency \norders  to  mitigate  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  But even though the  executive \nemergency  orders  cease  on  Saturday,  June  5,  there  is  still  a  \"reasonable \nexpectation\" the Governor could reinstate the executive emergency orders or issue \nsimilar restrictive measures before the November 2020 election. \n37 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 38 of 66\nAcosta, at *2 n.7.  The district court, therefore, proceeded to examine the plaintiffs complaint, \nbut ultimately found that it failed to  state claim upon which relief could be granted and was \nfrivolous. \nHere, the application of the voluntary cessation doctrine precludes a determination that \nthe  loosening  of restrictions  in  subsequent  orders  renders  moot  Plaintiffs'  constitutional \nchallenges to elements of Defendants' March 19, 2020 Business Closure Orders and the March \n23,  2020  Stay-at-Home  Orders.  The  language  of all  subsequent orders  merely  amends the \noperation of those  orders.  It  does  not  completely  abrogate  them.  They  remain  in  place, \nincorporated into the existing orders and are  only \"suspended.\"18  Mr.  Robinson specifically \ntestified: \nQ.  As we sit here today, is there a stay-at-home order in place? \nA. There is-there is a stay-at-home order in place, but it has been modified by \nthe subsequent orders that have been put out. \n(ECF No.  75, p.  144).  He testified, regarding both the stay-at-home and the business closure \nprovisions of Defendants'  orders that \"it is possible that some of these [provisions]  could be \nreinstated.\"  (ECF No. 75, p.  38).  The language of the orders and the explanation offered by \nDefendants' witnesses makes clear that the people of the Commonwealth remain subject to a \nstay-at-home order.  Although that order is suspended in operation, it remains incorporated into \nthe most recent mitigation orders issued by Defendants and can, at their will, be reinstated to full \n18  Q.  So in the green phase, which all of Pennsylvania is in today-in the green phase \nhere is not an elimination of the stay-at-home order but, rather, a suspension of the stay-at-home \norder; is that correct? \nA.  That is correct. \n(ECF No. 75, pp. 36-37). \n38 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 39 of 66\neffect.  There is no question that under the voluntary cessation doctrine the Court can examine \nthe issue, which remains fully ripe for review. \nThe  Court is cognizant that the voluntary cessation doctrine may create some tension \nwith  a  principle  of judicial  restraint-that  courts  should  generally,  when  possible,  avoid \nconstitutional  issues.  However,  courts  have  a  duty  to  fully  examine  and  address  issues \nlegitimately brought to them by the parties and failure to do so in the name of restraint may very \nwell constitute a dereliction of duty.  See Citizens United v.  FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 329 (2010) (\"It \nis  not judicial restraint to  accept an unsound,  narrow argument just so  the  Court can avoid \nanother argument with broader implications.  Indeed, a court would be remiss in performing its \nduties were it to accept an unsound principle merely to avoid the necessity of making a broader \nruling.\"). \nHere, the Court cannot, consistent with its most fundamental duties, avoid addressing the \nissues raised by Plaintiffs relating to the stay-at-home orders.  The record is unequivocal that \nthose orders, albeit suspended, remain in place.  In other words, all of Plaintiffs and, indeed, all \nof the citizens of the Commonwealth continue to be subject to stay-at-home orders that can be \nreinstated at the will of Defendants.  Moreover,  the  specter of future,  reinstated lockdowns \nremains a concern for Plaintiffs and continues to hang over the public consciousness.  The Court \nis  compelled,  therefore,  to  address  whether  such lockdowns  comply with the  United  States \nConstitution. \n39 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 40 of 66\nii.  Broad  population  lockdowns  are  unprecedented  in \nAmerican law. \nTo determine whether Defendants' stay-at-home orders are constitutional the Court must, \nas in all cases, determine which level of scrutiny should apply.  To do  so, the Court has to \ndetermine what a population lockdown, the effect of the stay-at-home orders, is from a legal \nperspective.  This  is  not  necessarily  an  easy  task.  Although this  nation has  faced  many \nepidemics  and  pandemics  and  state  and  local  governments  have  employed  a  variety  of \ninterventions in response, there have never previously been lockdowns of entire populations-\nmuch less for lengthy and indefinite periods of time. \nOne term that has frequently been employed to describe the lockdowns is \"quarantine.\" \nQuarantines have been used throughout history to  slow the spread of infectious  diseases by \nisolating the infected and others exposed to the disease.  Statutes enabling quarantine in times of \ndisease  date  to  colonial  times.  See  Laura  K.  Donohue,  Biodefense  and  Constitutional \nConstraints,  4  U.  MIAMI  NAT'L  SEC.  &  ARMED  CONFLICT  L.  REV.  82,  94  (2013-2014). \nPennsylvania employed quarantine provisions from the time of William Penn-mainly directed \nat passengers and cargo from incoming ships. Id.  at 104-106.19  Following independence, the \nstates, including Pennsylvania, continued to maintain and, when necessary, employ quarantine \npowers.  Those  powers  are  currently  set forth  in the  Pennsylvania Disease Prevention and \nControl  Law of 1955.  The  statute  empowers  the  state  board  of health to  issue  rules  and \nregulations regarding quarantine and for the state,  as well as  local boards or departments of \n19  Interestingly, William Penn ensured that Pennsylvania's use of quarantine was less severe than \nhe  had  witnessed  in  London  where,  he  observed,  the  effects  of  quarantine  were \ndisproportionately harmful to  the poor.  !d.  at  104-06,  (quoting  CATHERINE  UWENS  PEARE, \nWILLIAM PENN: A BIOGRAPHY,  48-51  (1957)) (\"[In London] Families with plague cases were \nboarded up into their houses for forty days without sufficient resources.  Door upon door bore \nthe great placard with its red cross and the plea, 'Lord have mercy upon us!\"'). \n40 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 41 of 66\nhealth, to impose a quarantine, when necessary.  3 5 P. S.  52 1.3,  52 1.5, 5 21.16.  The  statute \ndefines \"quarantine\" as: \nQuarantine. The limitation of freedom of movement of persons or animals who \nhave been exposed to a communicable disease for a period of time equal to the \nlongest usual  incubation period  of the  disease  in such manner  as  to  prevent \neffective contact with those not so exposed. Quarantine may be complete, or, as \ndefined below, it may be modified, or it may consist merely of surveillance or \nsegregation. \n(1) Modified quarantine is a selected, partial limitation of freedom of movement, \ndetermined on the basis of differences in susceptibility or danger of disease \ntransmission,  which  is  designed  to  meet  particular  situations.  Modified \nquarantine  includes,  but  is  not limited to,  the  exclusion of children  from \nschool  and  the  prohibition  or  the  restriction  of  those  exposed  to  a \ncommunicable disease from engaging in particular occupations. \n(2) Surveillance is  the  close  supervision of persons  and animals  exposed to  a \ncommunicable disease without restricting their movement. \n(3) Segregation is the separation for special control or observation of one or more \npersons or animals from other persons or animals to facilitate the control of a \ncommunicable disease. \n35 P.S. 521.2. \nThe plain language of the statute makes clear that the lockdown effectuated by the stay-\nat-home orders is not a quarantine.  A quarantine requires, as a threshold matter, that the person \nsubject to the \"limitation of freedom of movement\" be \"exposed to a communicable disease.\" \nId.  Moreover, critically, the duration of a quarantine is statutorily limited to \"a period of time \nequal to the longest usual incubation period of the disease.\"  The lockdown plainly exceeded that \nperiod.  Indeed, Defendants' witnesses, particularly Ms. Boateng, conceded upon examination \nthat the lockdown cannot be considered a quarantine.  (ECF No. 75, p. 209) (Q: \"And you agree \nwith me that the governor's order and the secretary's stay-at-home orders are not isolation orders \n41 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 42 of 66\nand are not quarantine orders?\" A:  \"I would agree  with that.\").  Rather,  Defendants  simply \nclassifY the order as \"public health mitigation.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 209).20 \nDefendants  attempt to  justifY  their  extraordinary  \"mitigation\"  efforts  by  pointing  to \nactions taken to combat the Spanish Flu pandemic a century ago.  Ms. Boateng testified that, in \nresponse to the Spanish Flu, \"much of the same mitigation steps were taken then, the closing of \nbars, saloons, cancellation of vaudeville shows, as they called them, and cabarets, the prohibition \nof large events.  So some of these same actions that we're taking now had been taken in the \npast.\"  (ECF No.  75, pp. 203-04).  But an examination of the history of mitigation efforts in \nresponse to the Spanish Flu-by far the deadliest pandemic in American history-reveals that \nnothing remotely approximating lockdowns were imposed. \nRecords show that on October 4,  1918, Pennsylvania Health Commissioner B. Franklin \nRoyer imposed an order which closed \"all public places of entertainment, including theaters, \nmoving picture establishments, saloons and dance halls and prohibit[ ed]  all meetings of every \n20 Even if the lockdown effectuated by the stay-at-home order could be classified as a quarantine, \nit would nevertheless far  exceed the traditional understanding of a state's quarantine power. \nState  quarantine  power,  \"although  broad,  is  subject  to  significant  constitutional  restraints.\" \nWendy E. Parmet, Quarantining the Law of Quarantine: Why Quarantine Law Does Not Reflect \nContemporary Constitutional Law, 9 WAKE FOREST J.L. &  PoL'Y 1, 4 (2018).  The power to \nsubject  a  citizen  to  quarantine  is  subject  to  both  procedural  and  substantive  due  process \nrestraints.  \"At a minimum, these include the requirement that quarantine be imposed only when \nit  is  necessary  for  public health  (or  is  the  least-restrictive  alternative)  and  only  when  it is \naccompanied by  procedural due process protections,  including notice,  the right to  a hearing \nbefore an independent decision-maker either before or shortly after confinement, the right to \ncounsel, and the requirement that the state prove its case with clear and convincing evidence.\" \nId.  at  4  (internal  citations  omitted).  Defendants'  stay-at-home  orders  imposed  a  statewide \nlockdown  on  every  resident  of  the  Commonwealth  that  included  none  of  these  basic \nconstitutional safeguards. \n42 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 43 of 66\ndescription until further notice.\"21  The order left to local officials the decision on whether to \ncancel school and/ or religious services.  The restrictions were lifted on November 9, 1918.22  A \ncomparative study of nonpharmaceutical interventions used in various U.S.  cities in 1918-19 \nshows that  state  and  local mitigation measures  were  of similarly  short durations  across the \nnation.23  While, unquestionably, states and local governments restricted certain activities for a \nlimited period of time to  mitigate the Spanish Flu, there is no record of any imposition of a \npopulation lockdown in response to that disease or any other in our history .24 \nNot  only  are  lockdowns  like  the  one  imposed  by  Defendants'  stay-at-home  orders \nunknown in response to any previous pandemic or epidemic, they are not as much as mentioned \nin recent guidance offered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\").

No such measures were imposed during the 1957 flu pandemic, the next-deadliest \none; even schools stayed open.\"). \n43 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 44 of 66\npandemic planning and decision-making by providing updated recommendations on the use of \nNPis  [non-pharmaceutical  interventions].\"25  It recommends  an  array  of personal  protective \nmeasures (i.e. staying horne when sick, hand hygiene and routine cleaning) and community level \nNPI measures that may be taken by state and local authorities.  Id.  at 2.  The community level \ninterventions include \"temporary school closures and dismissals, social distancing in worifplaces \nand the community, and cancellation of mass gatherings.\"  Id.  There are no recommendations in \nthe document that even approximate the imposition of statewide (or even community wide) stay-\nat-horne orders or the closure of all \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses.  Indeed, even for a \"Very \nHigh Severity\" pandemic (defined as one comparable to the Spanish Flu), the guidelines provide \nonly  that  \"CDC  recommends  voluntary  horne  isolation  of ill persons,\"  and  \"CDC  might \nrecommend voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members in areas where novel \ninfluenza circulates.\"  Id.  at 32,  Table  10  (emphasis  added).  This is  a far,  far  cry  from  a \nstatewide lockdown such as the one imposed by Defendants' stay-at-horne orders. \nThe fact is that the lockdowns imposed across the United States in early 2020 in response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented in the history of our Commonwealth and our \nCountry.  They have never been used in response to any other disease in our history.  They were \nnot recommendations made by the CDC.  They were unheard of by the people this nation until \njust this year.  It appears as though the imposition of lockdowns in Wuhan and other areas of \nChina-a nation unconstrained by concern for civil liberties and constitutional norms-started a \ndomino effect where one country, and state, after another imposed draconian and hitherto untried \nmeasures on their citizens.  The  lockdowns  are,  therefore,  truly unprecedented from a legal \nperspective.  But just because something is novel does not mean that it is unconstitutional.  The \n25 Noreen Qualls et al., Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \nUnited States, 2017 2 (Sonja A. Rasmussen et al. eds., 2017). \n44 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 45 of 66\nCourt will next attempt to apply established constitutional principles to examine this unfamiliar \nsituat\\on. \niii.  The  stay-at-home  provisions  of  Defendants'  orders  are \nunconstitutional. \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  the  lockdown  implemented  by  the  stay-at-home  provlSlons  of \nDefendants'  orders  violated  the  substantive  due  process  guarantees  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Specifically, they contend that it infringes upon the right to intrastate travel that \nhas been suggested by precedent of the Supreme Court26 and specifically adopted by the Third \nCircuit in Lutz v.  City of York, 899 F.2d 255 (3d Cir. 1990).  In Lutz, the Third Circuit examined \na municipal ordinance regulating car cruising and unequivocally held that \"the right to move \nfreely about one's neighborhood or town, even by automobile, is indeed, 'implicit in the concept \nof ordered liberty' and 'deeply rooted in the Nation's history.\"' Jd. at 268. \nThe Third Circuit considered what level of scrutiny should be applied to the right to \nintrastate travel and rejected the argument that strict, rather than intermediate scrutiny should \napply: \nNot  every  governmental  burden  on  fundamental  rights  must  survive  strict \nscrutiny, however. We believe that reviewing all infringements on the right to \ntravel under  strict scrutiny  is just as  inappropriate  as  applying no  heightened \nscrutiny to any infringement on the right to travel not implicating the structural or \nfederalism-based concerns of the more well-established precedents. \nJd.  at 269.  By applying intermediate scrutiny, it allowed for the right to travel, like speech, to be \nsubject to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions.  Id. \n26 Williams v.  Fears, 179 U.S. 270, 274 (1900) (\"Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right \nto remove from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, \nand the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any state is a right secured \nby the 14th Amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution.\"). \n45 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 46 of 66\nThe Court wonders whether the lockdown effectuated by the stay-at-home provisions of \nDefendants' orders are of such a different character than the municipal car cruising ordinance as \nwould warrant the imposition of strict scrutiny.  There is no question that requiring all citizens of \nthe Commonwealth to stay-at-home unless they have a reason to go out approved by Defendants' \norders is a far greater burden on personal autonomy than the situation in Lutz.  In that case, the \ndrivers were not precluded from leaving home and driving around town, but they were merely \nrestricted from certain practices at certain times, not unlike many other traffic control policies. \nHerein, the stay-at-home orders strictly limited the right of movement, confining citizens to their \nhomes unless they had a specific permissible reason to leave enumerated in Defendants' orders. \nThus, the stay-at-home orders impacted liberties not merely limited to the act of traveling, but \nthe very liberty interests arising from the fruits of travel, such as the right of association and even \nthe right to privacy-i.e., the right simply to be left alone while otherwise acting in a lawful \nmanner.  Our Courts have long recognized that beyond the right of travel, there is a fundamental \nright to simply be out and about in public.  City of Chicago v. Morale, 527 U.S. 41, 53-54 (1999) \n(striking down an antiloitering ordinance aimed at combatting street gangs and observing that \n\"the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the 'liberty' protected by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\").  See also Papachristou v.  Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, \n164-65 (1972) (citing a Walt Whitman poem in extolling the fundamental right to loiter, wander, \nwalk or saunter about the community); Bykofsly v.  Borough ofM  iddletown, 429 U.S. 964 (1976) \n(Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"The freedom to leave one's house and move about at will is of the \nvery essence of a scheme of ordered liberty, ... and hence is protected against state intrusions by \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\") (internal citation and quotation marks \nomitted)); Waters v.  Barry, 711  F.  Supp. 1125, 1134 (D.D.C. 1989) (referencing Papachristou \n46 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 47 of 66\nand stating \"[t]he right to walk the streets, or to meet publicly with one's friends for a noble \npurpose or for no purpose at all-and to do so whenever one pleases-is an integral component \noflife in a free and ordered society.\"). \nWhile the Third Circuit applied intermediate level scrutiny to the limited time, place and \nmanner restrictions on the right to intrastate travel imposed by the ordinance at issue, there are \nsubstantial grounds to hold that strict scrutiny should apply to the stay-at-home provisions of \nDefendants'  orders.  The  intrusions  into  the  fundamental  liberties  of the  people  of this \nCommonwealth effectuated by these orders are of an order of magnitude greater than any of the \nordinances examined in right to travel cases, loitering and vagrancy cases or even curfew cases. \nDefendants'  stay-at-home  and  business  closure  orders  subjected  every  Pennsylvanian  to  a \nlockdown where he or she was involuntarily committed to stay-at-home unless he or she was \ngoing  about  an  activity  approved  as  an  exception  by  the  orders.  This  is,  quite  simply, \nunprecedented in the American constitutional experience. \nThe orders are such an inversion of the usual American experience that the Court believes \nthat no less than the highest scrutiny should be used.  However, the Court holds that the stay-at \nhome orders would even fail scrutiny under the lesser intermediate scrutiny used by the Third \nCircuit in Lutz.  A critical element of intermediate scrutiny is that the challenged law be narrowly \ntailored so that it does \"not burden more conduct than is reasonably necessary.\"  Assoc. of New \nJersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, Inc.  v. Attorney General New Jersey, 910 F.3d 106, 119 (3d. Cir. \n2018).  The  stay-at-home orders far  exceeded any reasonable  claim to  be narrowly tailored. \nDefendants'  orders  subjected  every  Pennsylvanian  to  a  lockdown  where  he  or  she  was \ninvoluntarily committed to stay-at-home unless he or she was going about an activity approved \nas an exception by the orders.  Even in the most recent, and currently applicable, iteration of \n47 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 48 of 66\nDefendants' orders, while the operation of the stay-at-home provisions is \"suspended,\" it is not \nrescinded and may be re-imposed  at  any time  at the  sole  discretion of Defendants.  Thus, \nDefendants'  orders  have  created  a  situation where  the  default position is  lockdown  unless \nsuspended at their will.  When in place, the stay-at-home order requires a default of confinement \nat home, unless the citizen is out for a purpose approved by Defendants' orders.  Moreover, this \nsituation applied for an indefinite period of time.  This broad restructuring of the default concept \nof liberty of movement in a free society eschews any claim to narrow tailoring. \nIn addition, the lack of narrow tailoring is highlighted by the fact that broad, open-ended \npopulation lockdowns have never been used to combat any other disease.  In other words, in \nresponse to  every prior epidemic  and pandemic (even more  serious pandemics,  such as  the \nSpanish Flu) states and local governments have been able to employ other tools that did not \ninvolve locking down their citizens.  Although it is the role of the political branches to determine \nwhich tools are suitable to address COVID-19, the 2017 CDC guidance highlights the fact that \ngovernments have access to a full menu of individual and community interventions that are not \nas intrusive and burdensome as a lockdown of a state's population.  Finally, the Court observes \nthat the suspension of the operation of the stay-at-home order highlights that it \"burdens more \nconduct than is reasonably necessary.\"  In other words, Defendants are currently using means \nthat are less burdensome to the rights of a free people. \nThe Court declares, therefore, that the stay-at-home components of Defendants' orders \nwere and are unconstitutional.  Broad population-wide lockdowns are such a dramatic inversion \nof the concept of liberty in a free society as to be nearly presumptively unconstitutional unless \nthe  government  can truly  demonstrate  that they  burden no  more  liberty than is  reasonably \n48 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 49 of 66\nnecessary to achieve an important government end.  The draconian nature of a lockdown may \nrender this a high bar, indeed. \nb)  The  business  shutdown  components  of Defendants'  orders \nviolate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe Business Plaintiffs further argue that the business closure orders violated the Due \nProcess Clause.  The Order states, in relevant part: \"[n]o person or entity shall operate a place of \nbusiness in the Commonwealth that is not a life-sustaining business regardless of whether the \nbusiness is open to members of the public.\"  (ECF No. 42-3, Section 1).  The Order attached a \nlist of \"life-sustaining\" businesses that were permitted to stay open.  Defendants also set up a \nwaiver system, whereby a business deemed to be \"non-life-sustaining\" could request permission \nto continue operations.  (ECF No. 38, p. 2).  Defendants decided to close the waiver process on \nApril 3, 2020, largely because of an overwhelming number ofrequests.  (ECF No. 38, p. 4; ECF \nNo. 75, pp. 227-31).  The record shows that Defendants never had a set definition in writing for \n-, \nwhat constituted a \"life-sustaining\" business.  Rather, their view of what was, or was not, \"life-\nsustaining\" remained in flux.  (ECF No.  75, pp.  97-98).  Finally, the record shows that the \ndefinition of \"life-sustaining\" continued to change, even after the waiver process closed.  The \nBusiness Plaintiffs argue  that all  of these  facts  highlight the  constitutional infirmity  of the \nbusiness shutdown. \nAs with the lockdown, Defendants' shutdown of all \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses is \nunprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth and, indeed, the nation.  While historical \nrecords  show that certain economic activities were  curtailed in response to the  Spanish Flu \npandemic, there has never been an instance where a government or agent thereof has sua sponte \ndivided every business in the Commonwealth into two camps-\"life-sustaining\" and \"non-life-\nsustaining\"-and closed all of the businesses deemed \"non-life-sustaining\" (unless that business \n49 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 50 of 66\nobtained a discretionary waiver).  The unprecedented nature of the business closure-even in \nlight of historic emergency  situations-makes its  examination difficult from  a constitutional \nperspective.  It simply does  not neatly fit with any precedent ever addressed by our courts. \nNever before has the government exercised such vast and immediate power over every business, \nbusiness owner, and employee in the Commonwealth.  Never before has the government taken a \ndirect action which shuttered so many businesses and sidelined so many employees and rendered \ntheir ability to operate, and to work, solely dependent on government discretion.  As with the \nanalysis of lockdowns, the unprecedented nature of the business shutdowns poses a challenge to \nits review.  Nevertheless, having reviewed this novel issue in light of established Due Process \nprinciples, the Court holds that the business closure orders violated the Fourteenth Amendment. \ni.  The challenges to  the business closures remain ripe for \nreview. \nAs  with  the  stay-at-home  component  of Defendants'  orders,  the  business  closure \nprovisions remain reviewable under the voluntary  cessation  doctrine.  The  business  closure \norders were never rescinded.  Rather, they are merely suspended.  Specifically, the May 7, 2020 \nOrder outlining the movement of certain counties from the \"red phase\" to the \"yellow phase\" \nprovides:  \"[m]y order directing the  'Closure of All Businesses That are not Life  Sustaining' \nissued March 19, 2020, as subsequently amended, is suspended for the following counties ....\"  \n(ECF No. 42-52, Section l:A) (emphasis added).  The language of the Order makes clear that it \nprovides no guarantee of permanence in that it states: \"[w   ]hereas, it is necessary to relax some of \nthe requirements of the aforementioned orders for a period of time as  part of a gradual and \nstrategic  return to  work.\"  (ECF  No.  42-52)  (emphasis  added).  Following  orders  moving \ncounties  into  the  \"green phase,\" likewise,  state  that the  orders  closing  \"non-life-sustaining\" \nbusinesses are \"suspended.\"  (See e.g. ECF No. 42-58, Section l:A).  Mr. Robinson confirmed \n50 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 51 of 66\nthat the  orders remain suspended and \"it is possible that some of these provisions could be \nreinstated.\"  (ECF No.  75, p.  38).  Thus, Defendants' orders closing all \"non-life-sustaining\" \nbusinesses, imposed by them sua sponte, suspended by them sua sponte, and susceptible to sua \nsponte re-imposition at any time are appropriately before the Court. \nii.  The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a citizen's right \nto support himself by pursuing a chosen occupation. \nThe Business Plaintiffs argue that the business shutdown orders violated their right to \nsubstantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Specifically, they contend that the \ndesignation of some businesses-including all of their businesses-as \"non-life-sustaining\" and \nclosing them violated their right to \"engage in the common occupations of life\" and to engage in \nthe pursuit of his or her \"chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference.\" \n(ECF No. 56, p. 7 et seq.) (citing McCool v. City ofP  hiladelphia, 497 F. Supp. 2d 307, 328 (E.D. \nPa.  2007)).  Defendants  counter  that the  Fourteenth  Amendment  does  not  guarantee  \"any \nfundamental right to earn a living.\"  (ECF No. 66, p.  15).  They argue that Plaintiffs read too \nmuch  into  precedent  that  generally  references  the  right  of citizens  to  pursue  their  chosen \noccupations, that mere economic regulation is given little scrutiny and, that Plaintiffs were not \ndeprived of any protected liberty interest, but rather, just temporarily prevented from operating \ntheir businesses. (ECF No. 66, pp.  14-16).  Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' substantive \ndue process claims should be rejected. \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment includes a substantive component \nthat bars arbitrary, wrongful, government action \"regardless of the fairness of the procedures \nused  to  implement  them.\"  Zinermon  v.  Burch,  494  U.S.  113,  125  (1990).  Contrary  to \nDefendants'  argument,  the right of citizens to  support themselves by  engaging  in a chosen \noccupation  is  deeply  rooted  in  our  nation's  legal  and  cultural  history  and  has  long  been \n51 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 52 of 66\nrecognized as  a component of the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Over a \ncentury ago, the Supreme Court recognized that \"[i]t requires no argument to show that the right \nto work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the \npersonal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the  [Fourteenth] Amendment to \nsecure.\"  Truax v.  Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41  (1915) (holding that a state anti-alien labor statute \nviolated both equal protection and due process).  Later,  in striking down a law banning the \nteaching  of foreign  languages  in  school,  the  Supreme  Court  observed  that  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment guaranteed the right, inter alia, \"to engage in any of the common occupations of life \n....\"   Meyer  v.  Nebraska,  262  U.S.  390,  399  (1923).  The  emphasis  given to  economic \nsubstantive due process reached its apex in the Lochner era, Lochner v.  New York, 198 U.S. 45 \n(1905), and was considerably recalibrated and de-emphasized by the New Deal Supreme Court \nand later jurisprudence.  Nevertheless, our Supreme Court has never repudiated the recognition \nthat a citizen has the right to work for a living and pursue his or her chosen occupation. \nThe Third Circuit has recognized \"[t]he right to hold specific private employment and to \nfollow a chosen profession free from umeasonable governmental interference comes within both \nthe 'liberty' and the 'property' concepts of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\"  Piecknick v. \nComm.  of Pa., 36 F.3d 1250, 1259 (3d. Cir. 1994) (citing Green v.  McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 492 \n(1959); Truax, 239 U.S. at 41).  However, \n[t]he  Constitution only protects this  liberty  from  state  actions  that threaten to \ndeprive persons of the right to pursue their chosen occupation.  State actions that \nexclude a person from one particular job are not actionable in suits ... brought \ndirectly under the  due process clause.  It is the liberty to  pursue a calling or \noccupation, and not the right to a specific job, that is secured by the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nId.  (internal  citations  and  quotation  marks  omitted).  There  is  no  question,  then,  that  the \nFourteenth Amendment recognizes a liberty interest in citizens-the Business Plaintiffs here-to \n52 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 53 of 66\npursue their chosen occupation.  The dispositive question is not whether such a right exists, but \nrather, the level of infringement upon the right that may be tolerated. \nAlthough federal courts have recognized the existence of a substantive due process right \nof a citizen to pursue a chosen occupation for over a century, there is little specific analysis on \nhow that right should be weighed and what sort of test should be applied to allegedly infringing \nconduct.  As a matter of general consensus, courts generally treat government action purportedly \nviolating the right to pursue an occupation in the same light as economic legislation and use the \ngeneral standard of review applied to substantive due process claims.  In reviewing a substantive \ndue process claim, the \"criteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it \nis legislation or a specific act of a government officer that is at issue.\"  Cty.  of Sacramento v. \nLewis,  523  U.S.  833,  846  (1998).  \"Specific  acts\"  are  also  known  as  \"executive  acts\"  in \nsubstantive due process jurisprudence.  The Third Circuit has explained that \"executive acts, \nsuch as employment decisions, typically apply to one person or to a limited number of persons, \nwhile legislative acts, generally laws and broad executive regulations, apply to large segments of \nsociety.\"  Nicholas v.  Pa.  State Univ., 227 F.3d 133, 139 n.1  (3d. Cir. 2000).  Substantive due \nprocess challenges to a legislative act are reviewed under the rational basis test.  Am. Exp.  Travel \nRelated Serv 's., Inc. v. Sidamon-Eristoff, 669 F.3d 359, 366 (3d. Cir. 2012).27 \n27  In recent years, a growing chorus of cases and commentators have questioned whether the \ngeneral  deference  afforded to  economic regulations  of the  right to  pursue one's occupation \nshould be reexamined,  and  that  governmental  action be  subjected to  greater  scrutiny.  See \ngenerally,  Rebecca Haw Allensworth,  The  (Limited)  Constitutional Right to  Compete  in  an \nOccupation, 60 WM. & MARY L. REv.  1111  (2019); see also Timothy Sandefur, The Right to \nEarn  a Living,  6 CHAP. L. REv.  207, 208  (2003).  The latest focus on governmental action \nimpacting the right to  earn a living centers upon occupational licensing schemes.  Professor \nAllensworth observed, \"[w]ithin the movement [to reinvigorate protections on the right to pursue \nan occupation] there is disagreement about what doctrinal changes are needed to resurrect this \nonce-vibrant right.  Some call for a revision of the rational basis test that would place a heavier \nburden on the government to justify economic regulation as 'rational.'  Others see the rational \n53 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 54 of 66\nBefore proceeding to applicable constitutional scrutiny, the Court will address the fact \nthat,  as  Defendants  point  out,  the  closures  of \"non-life-sustaining\"  businesses  was  only \ntemporary.  Defendants hold that this precludes a claim that the closures violated the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Although the closures were ultimately \"suspended\" after a period of approximately \ntwo months (for businesses in some counties and longer for businesses in other counties), the \nMarch 19, 2020 Order has no end date.  Rather, it is open-ended, remaining \"in effect until \nfurther  notice.\"  (ECF  No.  42-3).  Moreover,  even the  subsequent  orders  suspending  (not \nrescinding) the shutdown of \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses recognize only that \"it is necessary \nto relax some of the requirements of the aforementioned orders for a period of time as part of a \ngradual and strategic return to work.\"  (ECF No. 42-52).  A total shutdown of a business with no \nend-date and with the specter of additional, future  shutdowns can cause critical damage to  a \nbusiness's  ability  to  survive,  to  an  employee's  ability  to  support  him/herself,  and  adds  a \ngovernment-induced cloud ofuncertainty to the usual unpredictability of nature and life. \nEvidence of record shows that the impact of the shutdown, even though temporary, was \nimmediate and severe on the Business Plaintiffs.  For example, R.W. McDonald & Sons, a small \nbusiness, estimates that it \"lost approximately $300,000 in revenue[,]\" and that its business has \nbeen \"financially devastated.\"  (ECF No. 30, p. 2).  R.W. McDonald expressed ongoing concern \nthat  the  restrictions  may  be  re-imposed,  which  could  be  fatal.  Plaintiffs  Chris  and  Jody \nbasis test as beyond salvation and call for a different tier of review, such as intermediate scrutiny, \nfor economic rights such as the right to be free from umeasonable licensing laws.\"  Allensworth, \nsupra,  at  1128.  See  also  Alexandra L. Klein,  The  Freedom  to  Pursue  a Common  Calling: \nApplying Intermediate Scrutiny to  Occupational Licensing Statutes, 73  WASH. & LEE L. REv. \n411  (2016).  There is no question that occupational licensing requirements and other, similar, \nrestrictions on the right to pursue one's occupation are considerably different than a state-wide \nshutdown of all businesses deemed to be \"non-life-sustaining.\"  This is, perhaps, a case where \nthe level of interference with the citizens' right to earn a living was so immediate and severe as \nto warrant a heightened level of scrutiny. \n54 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 55 of 66\nBertoncello-Young explained that the losses to their small salon exceeded $150,000 and that they \ndepleted their entire emergency fund to pay expenses that came due when their business was \nrequired to remain closed.  (ECF No. 32, p. 3).  The Bertoncello-Youngs also expressed concern \nabout re-imposition of the restrictions.  (ECF No. 30, p. 4).  It matters little to a business owner \nor employee that Defendants intended for the restrictions to  be temporary.  They were,  and \nremain, open-ended and subject to imposition at theยท sole discretion of Defendants.  The fact that \nPlaintiffs'  businesses  were  only  temporarily  shutdown does  not preclude  a finding  that the \nshutdown violated their liberty interests.  The nature of a state-wide shut down of \"non-life-\nsustaining\" business is such an immediate and unprecedented disruption to businesses and their \nemployees as to warrant constitutional review. \nThe  Supreme Court has recognized that the \"core of the  concept\" of substantive due \nprocess is the protection against arbitrary government action.  Lewis, 523  U.S. at 845  (citing \nHurtado v.  California, 110 U.S. 516, 527 (1884)).28  Indeed, \"the touchstone of due process is \nprotection of the individual against arbitrary actions of government . . . .\"   !d.  Rational basis \nreview is a forgiving standard for government acts, but it \"is not a toothless one ....\"   Mathews \nv. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 510 (1976).  As a general matter, the rational basis test requires only that \nthe governmental action \"bear[] a rational relationship to some legitimate end.\"  Romer v. Evans, \n517 U.S. 620, 631  (1996).  Conversely, actions which are irrational, arbitrary or capricious do \nnot bear a rational relationship to any end.  Cty.  Concrete Corp.  v.  Town of Roxbury, 442 F.3d \n159,  169 (3d.

Even with this forgiving standard as its guide, \nthe Court nevertheless holds that the March 19, 2020 Order closing all \"non-life-sustaining\" \nbusinesses was  so  arbitrary in its creation,  scope and administration as  to  fail  constitutional \nscrutiny. \nThe record shows that the  Governor's advisory team, which designated the Business \nPlaintiffs and countless other businesses throughout the Commonwealth as \"non-life-sustaining\" \nand, thereby, closing them, did so with no set policy as to the designation and, indeed, without \never formulating a set definition for \"life-sustaining\" and, conversely \"non-life-sustaining.\"  The \nterms \"life-sustaining\" and \"non-life-sustaining\" relative to businesses are not defined in any \nPennsylvania statute or regulation.  Mr. Robinson explained that Defendants' policy team used \nthe  North  American  Industry  Classification  System  (NAICS)  as  a  component  of  their \ndetermination of how to classify businesses.  (ECF. No. 39, p. 2).  The NAICS is a manual used \nby federal statistical agencies in classifying businesses for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, \nand publishing statistical data related to the U.S. economy.  (ECF. No. 39, p. 2).  The NAICS \ndoes not classify businesses into \"life-sustaining\" and \"non-life-sustaining\" categories.  It does \nnot even use the terms.  Rather, it merely divides the economy into \"20 broad sectors and 316 \nindustry groups.\"  (ECF No. 39, p. 2).  It was the policy team that made the decision as to which \nbusinesses would be deemed \"life-sustaining,\" and which would be closed.  (ECF No. 75, p. 96). \nThe  record  demonstrates  that the  policy team's unilateral  determination  as  to  which \nclasses of businesses would be classified as \"life-sustaining\" was never formalized and the team \nnever settled on a specific definition of \"life-sustaining\": \n56 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 57 of 66\nQ.  Well, I'd ask you if you'd do me a favor.  Would you please tell me where \nI could find the definition of \"life-sustaining?\"  Because I couldn't find \nit-I looked-Judge, I looked in 956 pages of the NAICS document, I \ncouldn't find it there.  So where would I find it, Mr. Robinson? \nA.  I believe that it's driven by the categorization and the determination-J'm \nnot sure that we wrote down anywhere what \"life-sustaining\" meant.  It \nwas policy decisions that were made by our team as  to  whether they \nconsidered,  you  know,  an  energy  production  location  or  utility  or \nsupermarket to be life-sustaining as distinguished from others that they did \nnot believe.  We didn't I believe, write down a definition specifically hut \njust translated the sort of common understanding of life sustaining or \nnot into that business list. \n(ECF No. 75, pp. 95-96).  Mr. Robinson further testified about the lack of any set, formalized, \ndefinition for \"life-sustaining\": \nQ.  So there's nowhere-you can't point me to anywhere where I could read \nthe definition of life-sustaining? \nA.  I  do  not believe that we ever wrote down what the definition of life \nsustaining was.  It was,  again, just developed through the list.  So the \nmeaning is in some sense determined by what was on the list. \n(ECF No. 75, p. 97).  When further pressed, about a definition,  Mr. Robinson testified: \nA.  We-the policy team that developed the list spent time discussing for each \ncategory whether they believed that it was essential for life; and in cases \nwhere they made that determination, it was, yes, allowed to remain open. \nIn categories where they particularly did not believe that the classification \nof the business type was that level of criticality, it was no,  and those \nbusinesses were required to close. \nI don't believe that we spent a lot of time around the formality of kind of \nenshrining a definition somewhere.  We were working quickly to provide \nclarity to the public as to how to prevent the spread of the disease and \nprotect public health. \n(ECF No. 75, p. 98) (emphasis added). \nThe explanation for how Defendants' policy team chose which businesses were \"life-\nsustaining\" and which were \"non-life-sustaining\" is circuitous, at best.  Mr. Robinson said that \nthey used the NAICS system to determine which businesses were \"life-sustaining,\" although the \n57 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 58 of 66\nNAICS does not actually use that categorization.  He acknowledged that the team simply applied \ntheir common-sense judgment as to what was, or was not, \"life-sustaining.\" In doing so, they did \nnot confme themselves to \"the formality of kind of enshrining a definition somewhere.\"  So, \nwithout a definition, how can one determine which businesses can stay open and which must \nclose?  Mr. Robinson said that one should look to the policy team's list (of \"life-sustaining\" \nbusinesses).  Essentially, a class ofbusiness is \"life-sustaining\" if it is on the list and it is on the \nlist because it is \"life-sustaining.\" \nTo  add  to  the  arbitrary  nature  of the  list  of \"life-sustaining\"  businesses  being  the \ndefmition of what is, in fact,  \"life-sustaining\" is the fact that the list of what businesses are \nconsidered \"life-sustaining\" changed ten times between March 19, 2020 and May 28, 2020: \nQ.  Mr.  Weaver,  the  chart that we've  referred to  you've  indicated  is  the \ndefinition  of life-sustaining  and  non-life-sustaining.  That  chart  has \nchanged ten times; is that correct? \nA.  It has, yes. \n(ECF No. 75, p 226).29  Even though, however, the classification of \"life-sustaining\" was never \nformally reduced to an objective definition in writing and Defendants' list of business types that \nthey  considered  to  be  \"life-sustaining\"  remained  in  flux,  changing  ten  times,  Defendants \neliminated the ability of a business to obtain a waiver as of April 3, 2020.  (ECF. No. 38, p. 4). \nThe waiver process allowed a business that believed it had been mistakenly classified as \"non-\nlife-sustaining\"  to  submit information to  show that it  should have  been classified as  \"life-\nsustaining\" and, thus, permitted to operate.  Once the waiver process closed, a business that had \n29 The initial list was published on March 19, 2020.  Amendments to the list were published on \nMarch 21, March 24, April 1, April20, April 27, April 28, May 8, May 11 and May 28.  (ECF \nNo. 75, p. 226). \n58 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 59 of 66\nbeen wrongly categorized had no recourse-even though the list of \"life-sustaining\" business \ncontinued to fluctuate: \nQ.  So ifl have a business and I've changed my business operations and I was \npreviously  categorized  as  non-life-sustaining  but  I've  changed  my \nbusiness model, I've changed my way of doing business, I've got the best \nplan that the CDC has ever seen, I can't get my name changed-or I can't \nget reclassified as  non-life-sustaining (sic)  despite  the  fact  that you've \nchanged the  definition of life-sustaining post closing down the waiver \nprocess; is that correct? \nA.  Could you repeat that? \nQ.  Sure.  You've acknowledged that the definition of life-sustaining changed \nafter the waiver process was closed? \nA.  Correct. \nQ.  Based upon those changes, ifl looked at all those charts and I said, \"wow, \nI'm now life-sustaining\"  or \"I think I  can meet the  definition of life \nsustaining.\"  I don't have a vehicle for you to approve my waiver? \nA.  Correct. \n(ECF No. 75, pp. 230-31).  To add to the arbitrary nature of the entire situation surrounding the \nbusiness closures, Defendants closed the waiver process because the backlog of requests slowed \nthe process down.  (ECF No. 75, pp. 227-31).  Defendants decided to go \"from a slowed process \nto no process.\"  (ECF No. 75, p. 230). \nThe manner in which Defendants, through their policy team, designed, implemented, and \nadministered the business closures is shockingly arbitrary.  The policy team was not tasked with \nformulating a theoretical policy paper or standard to categorize abstract classes of business or \nNAICS codes.  Rather, it had the authority to craft a policy, adopted wholesale by Defendants, \nthat  had  an  immediate  impact  on  the  Business  Plaintiffs  and  countless  other  businesses, \nemployers, and employees across the Commonwealth.  Despite the fact that their decisions had \nthe  potential  (and  in  many  cases  the  actual  effect)  of destroying  businesses  and  putting \n59 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 60 of 66\nemployees  out  of work,  Defendants  and  their  advisors  never  formulated  a  set,  objective \ndefinition in writing of what constitutes \"life-sustaining.\"  The Court recognizes that Defendants \nwere acting in haste to address a public health situation.  But to the extent that Defendants were \nexercising raw governmental authority in a way that could (and did) critically wound or destroy \nthe livelihoods of so many, the people of the Commonwealth at least deserved an objective plan, \nthe ability to determine with certainty how the critical classifications were to be made, and a \nmechanism to challenge an alleged misclassification.  The arbitrary design, implementation, and \nadministration  of the  business  shutdowns  deprived the  Business  Plaintiffs  and  their  fellow \ncitizens of all three. \nAnother  layer  of  arbitrariness  inherent  in  the  business  shutdown  components  of \nDefendants'  orders  are that many \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses sell the same products or \nperform the same services that were available in stores that were deemed \"life-sustaining.\"  For \nexample, Plaintiff R.W.  McDonald &  Sons is a small appliance and furniture  store that was \ndeemed a \"non-life-sustaining\" business and required to close.  (ECF No. 30, p. 1).  But larger \nretailers  selling the  same  products,  such as  Lowes,  The  Home  Depot,  Wa lmart  and  others \nremained opened.  Mr.  McDonald stated that his business  \"lost approximately $300,000  in \nrevenue\" and that his business has been \"financially devastated.\"  (ECF No. 30, p. 2).  He also \naverred that he lost business to the big-box retailers that were permitted to remain in operation.30 \nPlaintiffs Mike and Nancy Gifford and Chris and Jody Bertoncello-Young, each in the salon \nbusiness, attempted to remain open to sell hair and other styling products, but were advised that \nas \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses they had to close. (ECF Nos. 31 and 32).  But those products \ncould be purchased at \"life-sustaining\" big box retailers and drug stores.  It is paradoxical that in \n30 R.W. McDonald & Sons applied for a waiver twice.  The first request was denied.  There was \nno follow up communication relating to the second.  (ECF No. 30; ECF No. 74, pp. 138-39). \n60 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 61 of 66\nan  effort to  keep  people  apart,  Defendants'  business  closure  orders permitted to  remain in \nbusiness the largest retailers with the highest occupancy limits. \nThe Court recognizes that Defendants were facing a pressing situation to formulate a plan \nto  address the nascent  COVID-19 pandemic when they took the unprecedented step  of sua \nsponte  determining  which  businesses  were  \"life-sustaining\"  and  which  were  \"non-life-\nsustaining.\"  But in making that choice, they were not merely coming up with a draft of some \ntheoretical white paper, but rather, determining who could work and who could not, who would \nearn a paycheck and who would be unemployed-and for some-which businesses would live, \nand which would die.  This was truly unprecedented. \nAn economy is not a machine that can be shut down and restarted at will by government. \nIt is an organic system made up of free people each pursuing their dreams.  The ability to support \noneself is  essential to free people in a free  economy.  The late Justice William 0. Douglas \nobserved: \nThe  right  to  work,  I  had  assumed,  was  the  most  precious  liberty  that  man \npossesses.  Man has indeed as much right to work as he has to live, to be free, to \nown property.  The  American ideal was  stated by Emerson ยทin his  essay  on \nPolitics,  'A man has a right to be employed, to be trusted, to be loved, to be \nrevered.'  It does many men little good to stay alive and free and propertied, if \nthey cannot work.  To work means to eat.  It also means to live.  For many it \nwould be better to work in jail, than to sit idle on the curb.  The great values of \nfreedom are in the opportunities afforded man to press to new horizons, to pit his \nstrength against the forces of nature, to match skills with his fellow man. \nBarsky v.  Board of Regents of University  of State  of New  York,  347 U.S.  442,  472  (1954) \n(Douglas, J, dissenting).  In a free state, the ability to earn a living by pursing one's calling and \nto support oneself and one's family is not an economic good, it is a human good.  Although \njurisprudence may not afford the right to pursue one's occupation the same weight as others in \nour hierarchy of  liberties, it cannot be given such short shrift as to allow it to be completely \n61 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 62 of 66\nsubordinated to an ad hoc and arbitrary regimen that cannot even be reduced to an objective, \nwritten definition-even where that regimen is based on good intent.  Here, Defendants took the \nunprecedented step of closing all businesses that they self-deemed to be \"non-life-sustaining.\" \nThe record shows that in doing so and in their manner of doing so, Defendants' actions were so \narbitrary as to violate the Business Plaintiffs' substantive due process rights guaranteed by the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n4.  The  business  closure  provisions  of Defendants'  orders violated  the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nFinally,  the  Court  examines  whether the  business  closure  provisions  of Defendants' \norders  violated the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the  Fourteenth Amendment.  The  Business \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants' orders violated equal protection in two ways.  They contendยท \nthat the division of the Commonwealth into regions (on the county level) wrongly treated them \ndissimilarly  from  businesses  in other  similarly  situated counties.  They  also  argue  that the \ndistinction between them and other businesses that were permitted to operate was arbitrary and \nfails equal protection scrutiny.  Defendants counter the first point by arguing that distinctions are \ncommonly  made  based  on  county  boundaries.  They  further  argue  that  their  decision  to \ndistinguish between \"life-sustaining\"  and \"non- life-sustaining\" businesses  (closing the  latter) \nwas rationally related to a legitimate government end, and, thus survives constitutional scrutiny. \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the states to \"deny to \nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"  U.S. CONST.  14th Amend. \nWhere a plaintiff in an equal protection claim does not allege that distinctions were made on the \nbasis of a suspect classification such as  race, nationality, gender or religion, the claim arises \nunder the \"class of one\" theory.  Village of Willowbrook v.  Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000).  To \nprevail on such a claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate: 1) the defendant treated him differently \n62 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 63 of 66\nthan others similarly situated, 2) the defendant did so intentionally, and 3) there was no rational \nbasis for the difference in treatment.  Hill v.  Borough of Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225, 239 (3d. Cir. \n2006).  As explainedยท above, the rational basis test is forgiving,  but not without limits in its \ndeference.  Distinctions cannot be arbitrary or irrational and pass scrutiny.  \"The State may not \nrely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the \ndistinction arbitrary or irrational.\"  City of Cleburne v.  Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, \n446 (1985) \nThe  Business  Plaintiffs  have  demonstrated  they  were  treated  differently  than  other \nbusinesses that are similarly situated.  For example, R.W. McDonald &  Sons is a retailer that \nsells furniture and appliances-so is Walmart, Lowes and The Home Depot.  The only difference \nis the extent of their offerings-Walmart, Lowes and The Home Depot are larger and offer more \nproducts.  However, in essence, they are the same-retailers selling consumer goods.  Likewise, \nthe  Salon  Plaintiffs  (in  their  role  as  retailers  of health  and  beauty  products,  rather  than \nperforming personal services) are similarly situated to the big box retailers and drug stores in that \nthey sell the same health and beauty products.  Again, the only distinction is size.  Nevertheless, \nDefendants' orders treated these retailers differently than their larger competitors, which were \npermitted to remain open and continue offering the same products that Plaintiffs were forbidden \nfrom selling.  The record unequivocally establishes that the distinction was made intentionally. \nThus, the fmal question is whether there was a rational basis for the difference in treatment. \nDefendants  are  correct  that  the  provisions  of their  reopening  plan,  which  made \ndistinctions between different regions of the Commonwealth, passes constitutional scrutiny.  It is \nwell established that states and local governments may impose requirements or restrictions that \napply in one region and not in others.  See Cty. Bd.  OfA  rlington Cty.,  Va.  v. Richards, 434 U.S. \n63 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 64 of 66\n5,  6-8  (1977).  The  Court holds  that Defendants had a  rational  basis  for  rolling  out their \nreopening plan on a regional basis based on counties.  Doing so recognized and respected the \ndifferences in popufation density, infrastructure and other factors relevant to the effort to address \nthe virus.  The Business Plaintiffs point to similarity between their area and neighboring counties \npermitted to open earlier, but rational basis does not require the granularity of a neighborhood by \nneighborhood  plan.  Distinctions  between  counties  are  a  historically  accepted  manner  of \nstatewide administration and pass scrutiny here. \nHowever,  the  manner  in  which  Defendants'  orders  divided  businesses  into  \"life \nsustaining\" and \"non-life-sustaining\" classifications, permitting the former to remain open and \nrequiring the latter to close, fails rational basis scrutiny.  The Court outlined at length above the \nfacts of record demonstrating that Defendants' determination as to which businesses they would \ndeem \"life-sustaining\" and which would be deemed \"non-life-sustaining\" was an arbitrary, ad \nhoc, process that they were never able to reduce to a set, objective and measurable definition.  As \nstated above in reference to the Business Plaintiffs' due process challenge, to the extent that \nDefendants were going to exercise an unprecedented degree of immediate power over businesses \nand livelihoods; to the extent that they were going to singlehandedly pick which businesses could \nstay open and which must close; and to the extent that they were picking winners and losers, they \nhad an obligation to do so based on objective definitions and measurable criteria.  The Equal \nProtection  Clause  cannot  countenance  the  exercise  of such raw  authority  to  make  critical \ndeterminations where the government could not, at least, \"enshrine a definition somewhere.\" \n(ECF No. 75 p. 95). \nFinally, the record shows that Defendants' shutdown of \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses \ndid not rationally relate to Defendants' stated purpose.  The purpose of closing the \"non-life-\n64 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 65 of 66\nsustaining\" businesses was to limit personal interactions.  Ms. Boateng averred: \"[i]n an effort to \nminimize the spread of COVID-19 throughout Pennsylvania, the Department [of Health] sought \nto limit the scale and scope of personal interaction as much as possible in order to reduce the \nnumber of new infections.\"  (ECF No. 37, p. 2).  \"Accordingly, it was determined that the most \neffective  way  to  limit personal  interactions  was  to  allow only businesses that provide  life \nsustaining services or products to remain open and to issue stay-at-home orders directing that \npeople leave their homes only when necessary.\"  (ECF No. 37, p. 3).  But Defendants' actions \ndid not rationally relate to this end.  Closing R.W. McDonald & Sons did not keep at home a \nconsumer looking to buy a new chair or lamp, it just sent him to Walmart.  Refusing to allow the \nSalon Plaintiffs to sell shampoo or hairbrushes did not eliminate the demand for those products, \nit just sent the consumer to Walgreens or Target.  In fact, while attempting to limit interactions, \nthe arbitrary method of distinction used by Defendants almost universally favored businesses \nwhich offered more, rather than fewer products.  As such, the largest retailers remained open to \nattract  large  crowds,  while  smaller  specialty  retailers-like  some  of the  Business  Plaintiffs \nhere-were required to close.  The distinctions were arbitrary in origin and application.  They do \nnot rationally relate to Defendants' own stated goal.  They violate the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThe Court closes this Opinion as it began, by recognizing that Defendants'  actions at \nissue here were undertaken with the good intention of addressing a public health emergency.  But \neven in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered.  The liberties protected by \nthe Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms-in place when times are good but able to be cast \naside in times  of trouble.  There  is no  question that this  Country has  faced,  and will  face, \n65 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00677-WSS   Document 79   Filed 09/14/20   Page 66 of 66\nemergencies  of every  sort.  But the  solution to  a national crisis  can never be  permitted to \nsupersede the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American \nexperiment.  The Constitution cannot accept the concept of a \"new normal\" where the basic \nliberties  of the  people  can be  subordinated to  open-ended emergency  mitigation measures. \nRather,  the  Constitution sets  certain lines that may not be crossed,  even in an  emergency. \nActions taken by Defendants crossed those lines.  It is the duty of the Court to declare those \nactions unconstitutional.  Thus, consistent with the reasons set forth above, the Court will enter \njudgment in favor of Plaintiffs. \nBY THE COURT: \nWILLIAM S. STICKMAN IV \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n66 ",
